i’ve shortlisted a few, would love if someone could just... sanity check them for me. or even just tell me which one sounds cooler, so the two names i keep going back to are:

**machiavellinet** (or Machiav3lliNet or even machiavelliNet,  still not sure on the casing lol)

and

**grimtides**

the first 3 are obviously kinda variations on the same thing. idea being like “machiavelli” + “net” ,  as in, like a neural net. i like that it feels cold and smart and sorta sinister in a good way? like if someone released an open-source AI model and named it that i wouldn’t question it. it also kinda reflects my personal philosophical ideologies as well,

problem is, it’s a mouthful sometimes. and i keep wondering if people will even pronounce it right or just see a mess of letters and leave. also not sure if the capital N in “machiavelliNet” helps readability or just makes it look like i’m trying too hard. “machiav3lliNet” is maybe too edgy? idk, feels very 2014-hacker-handle but i still think it looks cool,

plus this machiavellinet is free to use on Github and doesnt have no variants lying around there thats a big thing, hope the same for other platforms too.

then there’s grimtides which is like... a totally different vibe. shorter, easier to say in convos, sounds like a villain or a dark fantasy codename or something. no real meaning but it just rolls off the tongue nice. issue is, it’s kinda popular. but i found there are already a few users on github with variations of it (grimtides, grimtidex, grimtide, etc), maybe even some games or stories with similar names, so idk if that hurts the uniqueness

obv i will keep my actual name professionally but i keep trying to imagine introducing myself in a tech discord or on a project and being like “hey, i’m machiavellinet” vs “hey, i’m grimtides” and they both give different vibes. like one sounds like i’m building ai models in a basement with 10 coffee mugs around me and the other sounds like i draw pixel art at 2am and write cli tools just for the aesthetic. neither is wrong. both are kinda true.  
I also came up with some like TensorValak, TensorVandal, neuralchad and stuff but they didn't hit quite as these, or maybe idk.

anyway, sorry for the long post. i know it’s just a name and it’s not gonna make me a better dev or anything but it’s been in my head for too long and i need to just pick and move on. if anyone has thoughts or preferences, or if i’m overthinking this to hell and back (likely), pls help lol

1m51hy5,https://i.redd.it/7g9jbeioa3ef1.jpeg,"COMPLETE - FOOD STAT VISUAL GUIDE - Every single craftable food item that rewards permanent stat boost! All crafting Tables included. FOOD stats, ingredients, numerical values, fish locations, and other facts  included!","*TLDR You need 3 skills: BUBBLE NET, NOURISHMENT, and WORTHWHILE RESTORATION! Now make infinite stat boosting FOOD!*

# V. 2.5.1e. Due to the recent update you can become godlike in 4 stats: Defense, Mana, HP, and Spell Damage! This update also made most of the food in the game obsolete! :( 

The basics of this playstyle is to make as much money as possible while making specific foods that boost your stats infinitely. The cycle is simple: Spend Mana > Restore Mana > Get money for restored mana!  
***But we're not satisfied with just that……***

# Let’s start our journey to breaking this game and ascending to godhood... with the Bare Bones Plan!

1. Plant ALL OF THE Scallo-Papaya Tree Seeds. Hundreds of them!
   * Convert an entire Farm/Base to these trees only. You cannot have too many.
      * *ProTip.* Plant trees with zero gaps. Your character can still navigate through them.
      * *ProTip.* Placing floor tiles prevents weeds, stones, and random trees from spawning
2. Get a Juicer. Make as many Scallo-Papaya Smoothies as possible.
   * For the ice cream base you’ll need either a cow or to purchase milk from the bakery (yaass). Then convert it into an ice cream base at the Baker's Station.
      * *The Ratio: 1 Milk = 4 Ice cream bases.*
3. Now go to the Sun Haven Sewers. Use your skill Fishing Bubble to catch fish until your eyeballs can’t handle it anymore.
   * Your retinas should be *bleeding.*
4. Go to your Sushi Table / Fish Grill to start making the Flat \[#Value\] increase stat foods. *Roasted Squawkmouth Bass will give you a “small increase to health.”* ***HOWEVER. It also gives a FLAT +1 health independently. You can gain HP infinitely this way.***   

# Let’s streamline the fishing process. 

1. Fishing Skills. Your **entire existence** focuses around Bubble Net.

* Bubble Net Spell. Conjures a bubble to catch fish. The high mana cost is GOOD.
* Spawning Season. Increases all fish spawn rates.
* Advanced Fish Mapping. Increases legendary fish spawn rate. 
* Self Sustaining. Catching any fish restores mana.  *ProTip.* Bubble Net doesn’t award Museum fishing artifacts!

# I want to BREAK this game. Make my fruit trees more fruity. The most fruity fruit trees.

1. Exploration Skills.

* Horn of Plenty. Doubles the fruit dropped from trees. *The rest of the skills don’t benefit our masterplan for world domination.*

# Break it to pieces. Get more better FOODs more FASTER!

1. Cooking Skills.

* Nourishment. THIS IS WHERE IT’S AT. Why? Because **MONEY.** *See below!*
* Mana Recovery. Not as good as Nourishment but still worth it. *See below!*
* Leftovers. Gain a chance to make 2 meals instead of 1.
* Expert Chef. Reduces crafting times. 
* Artisanry Master. Reduces crafting times. *ProTip.* The skill Cuisine Master does NOT affect the FLAT# bonus. We don’t need it. Get the other listed skills first.

# BUT WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY?!??

1. Mining Skills.

* Worthwhile Restoration. Money for mana restored. This is the core to making us money!
* Industrial. Every single item you craft (or cook) will get you money! 
* Resourceful. Boosts Industrial. 

1. Combat Skills.

* Arcane Mastery. The juicy bit is after spending mana you recover % of mana spent.
* Deep Sleep. Helps greatly by recovering % of health and mana!

# Let's SHATTER this game. 

# The Nel'Vari Mana Infuser! Convert your mana straight to currency! Mana Orbs!

1. Do this in the morning before collecting your crafting/cooking stations! 

* You get two of these from the Museum Mana bundle. Otherwise use the ones located around the Nel’Vari town.
   * *ProTip1.* Mana Orbs can be converted into Doublooms at the ratio 1:10. Use those Doublooms to get even *MOAR* Scallo-Papaya Tree Seeds. 
   * *ProTip2.* 10 Doublooms exchange for either 1 mana orb, 100 gold, or 3 withergate tickets.

# Accessories to start!

1. General Rings 

* Basic rings like the Fisherman's Blessing or Ring of Quiet can help your fishing until you unlock the fishing skill Bubble Net.
   * Otherwise use anything that gives to Mana. 

1. Amulets

* The ONLY option is the Diamond Amulet since it gives 10% to mana regen.

1. Keepsakes

* You’ll start the game with either the Riches Keepsake (80 GPD) or the Romance Keepsake to help you get wedding rings faster! 

# Micromanage the utter destruction of the game economy by using ACCESSORIES!

1. Wedding Rings  (Gold Per Day= GPD, Gold Per Craft = GPC)

* Anne’s Wedding Ring. 700 GPD
* Claue’s Wedding Ring. 500 GPD
* Wesley Wedding Ring. 25 ManaOrbs PD
* Darius’s Wedding Ring. 500 GPD & 35 Tickets PD
* Xyla’s Wedding Ring. 50 Tickets PD

1. Keepsakes! Where the TRUE game breaking lies!

* Anne's Pearl Earrings. 180 GPD & 4 GPC
* Claude's House Key. 500 GPD
* Zaria's Doubloon. 150 GPD & 5 GPC
* Other Keepsakes that reward 10% to mana regen: Kai's Golden Necklace, Wesley's Woven Necklace, Catherine's Charm, Iris's Enchanted Totem, and Lucius' Moon Beads.
   * *ProTip.* Wear the biggest GPD accessories BEFORE bed and SWAP them out with the biggest GPC in the morning! Yay micromanaging! 

# Other minor stuff!

* Totems and Scarecrows. 
   * You can earn +2 Exp per crop harvested with the corresponding totem.
   * The Royal Totem gives +2 gold per harvest crop instead of Exp.
   * The Spring Totem gives a 4% chance to yield an extra crop when harvested.
* Skill: The Fruits of Midas.
   * All fruit trees have a % to have their Golden variant fruit.
* Skill: Golden Heart.
   * Animals can be over-capped on hearts. Small % to give Golden Variant products.
* Golden Trees (crafted via museum reward) can spawn ALL golden tree fruits, most animal products, and even **golden pomegranates.**
   * *ProTip.* All golden fruits are a Universally Liked Gift. So having a stack of 50 golden Apples on you will make gathering community tokens, keepsakes, and maxing romance with NPCs much easier!
   * *ProTip.* Convert your farms/bases. ONE for Golden Trees, ONE for Scallo-Papaya Trees, and ONE for farming/barns... or whatever else you wanna do!

This game style will eventually give you so much defense that armor will become useless. To make the MOST money while taking advantage of the absurd Def stat boost you could wear the Money Maker outfit from the Museum. Or you could wear nothing but a top hat. You do you! 

# Food that WASN'T made obsolete includes:

1. Movement Speed
2. Mana Regen
3. Health Regen
4. Attack Damage (physical)

1m51has,https://www.reddit.com/r/leftcommunism/comments/1m51has/how_would_a_lower_stage_communism_society/,How would a lower stage communism society calculate contribution?,"To my understanding in lower stage communism people are still expected to work in order to be able to sustain themselves, and the major difference in this regard is that they are compensated for the full value of their contribution(in labour vouchers). A question I have then is how would such society calculate the value of each contribution?   

To my understanding it would have to start with calculating the value of the labour power of each type of labourer. But it doesn't seem obvious how to even go about it. Do you just observe the average daily consumption of the necessaries of life for each type of labourer?

But food is one such necessary of life, and the value of the food varies greatly with the kind of diet. If it turns out that the average surgeon monthly consumes two high-quality steaks and a bottle of expensive wine and some high-end sushi, does that count as necessaries of life? What about coffee and other stimulants, I wouldn't consider coffee to be a necessary of life but without it my productivity at work visibly drops, therefore my productive potential is not sustained without coffee. How do you decide what is and what isn't included in this calculation? ",4,1753049041.0,leftcommunism,0,1.0,False
1m51h7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1m51h7m/please_help_i_need_advice_on_how_to_proceed_with/,Please help! I need advice on how to proceed with my parents.,"I (40f) really need advice with how to proceed with my family (parents mid-60s). This has been going on for years and I’m reaching a breaking point. My parents sweep things under the rug, especially difficult emotions. So, confronting them about my feelings regarding this and the mess it’s created has been extremely difficult. 

My husband and I got engaged in December 2022. My parents were so happy for us, and cried tears of joy as I had gone through a divorce years prior and they were happy to see me happy again and in a healthy relationship. They also loved my boyfriend.

Over the next couple weeks, my fiancé and I decided to have a destination wedding as we had both done the church and big wedding thing in both of our previous marriages, and wanted something more simple and fun. We decided Mexico would be the place and picked a date for January 2024 (13 months away). We made this announcement to our families. My husband (fiancé at the time) has children in their early 20s, whom were very excited about this. My parents…not so much. Their first excuse, in what would be a series of excuses, was they weren’t sure if they could get time off work. My mom is a hairstylist and owns her own salon, and my dad had been with his company for 25 years at that point. Not to mention, this was over a year’s notice. I was kind of taken a back by it. I briefly considered it may be an issue with finances, but they had recently paid off their house and had mentioned then, that it was nice to have the extra money each month.

A few weeks go by and my fiancé and I are at my parent’s house visiting and we bring up the wedding. My mom gets all serious and says she’s not sure she’ll be able to go, she has developed a debilitating fear of flying. I’m shocked by this, as she had recently gotten back from a trip to AZ with her sisters in which she had to fly. Never once mentioned it when I had asked her how her trip was. This is feeling like another excuse, but I try to be sympathetic and suggest talking to her doctor about this, maybe he can prescribe medication or we can look into meditation. I offered to help figure something out as we have lots of time. Then, later that evening, my dad suggests getting married in Hawaii. I looked at him with utter shock, informing him mom would still have to fly there. I’m getting a sense that Mexico is the issue. This is confirmed as the weeks go on and they explain to me that they don’t feel safe going to Mexico. My parents don’t do a lot of traveling outside of their little bubble. So, to me, this is a valid concern, especially with how Mexico can be made to look in the media. So, we have them over and go over where we are going, a nice resort town and gated resort. Explained safety of this area vs traveling to other areas in the US that can be just as bad, but aren’t perceived this way as it’s in the US. So, explaining to them the safety of where we are going while they are getting conflicting info from the media is proving to be difficult. At one point in a separate conversation with my dad, me mentions they are “afraid of the people”.

We are now a few months from the wedding. It’s fall 2023. My parents have actually agreed to go and booked their plane tickets and put down a deposit with the travel agent I had been using for all of this (travel agent confirmed this to me). But in all of this time, there has been no excitement on their part about the wedding. No questions asked about how wedding planning is going, what we are doing for this or that. But, I’m trying not to let it bother me.

A few weeks later, I brought my mom along to my wedding dress fitting where she will be seeing me in my dress for the first time and the only comment out of her mouth was how I “better not put on any weight”. What was supposed to be a meaningful moment has been ruined. I’m quiet on the ride back to drop her off at home.

At this point, I’ve had enough and I send a text to my parents explaining how I’m feeling and that it feels like they don’t want to go. They respond with “we see the world differently”, how it’s a dangerous place and “WWIII Russian Sleeper Cells are waiting” blah blah blah. I tell them they need to decide why to do, that I’m done begging them to go. A few weeks go by and it’s been radio silence. I text them asking if they made a decision. My dad’s text 6 weeks before we are supposed to leave:

“I have to inform you that we will not be going to Mexico.  We do not need any reimbursement for anything. I will call travel agent tomorrow.”

I never responded. I was devastated. My fiancé texted them asking week later asking them not to contact me, that I was heartbroken. He told them we’d reach out sometime after the wedding. I blocked them, so I don’t know if they ever attempted to contact me.

The wedding and trip was AMAZING. They missed out on something very beautiful and special. About 2 months after we get back, I unblocked them and ask if they want to come over and visit about things. My goal in this was to figure out the exact reason they didn’t want to go. I heard so many excuses and I was so lost. They told me it’s because they were so torn, they visited with their “therapist” aka pastor and he told them not to go. What?! Shocked again. I couldn’t even look at them during this visit. We sat around our dining table and I just looked at my husband or down at my coffee. I couldn’t bear looking in their eyes. I never got the sense that they regretted it. I feel like they regretted the outcome, but to me that’s different than regretting their actions. This visit made them feel like our relationship is good again and they started reaching out. Just mundane stuff, sending cute videos or telling me about so and so. I wouldn’t respond as I wasn’t ready. They’d notice the silence after a while and then ask what’s wrong. I’d explain I’m having a hard time moving on. They’d say nothing. This has been going on for months now. And in this time, we’ve had some extended daily issues that brought us all together. I feel like my presence during this gave them the feeling of “she’s back, we’re a family again” but it wasn’t like that for me, I was being supportive to the rest of my extended family. The cycle would then repeat.

I finally texted them and asked them what did they think would happen when they decided not to go to the wedding. My mom says:

“I never dreamt in a million years that it would cause such a heartache for you. To be absolutely honest I don’t think I ever thought past the not going.”

I responded saying that was shocking that she didn’t think of the results of her actions. Radio silence. Haven’t heard anything from her since May 6. My dad has texted randomly about unrelated stuff.

I don’t know how to move on. I am feeling incredibly guilty not having them in my life and missing out on little milestones or events in my and my new families lives. Not to mention what’s  going on in theirs. But I’m still so incredibly hurt by what they did. Clearly they just want to sweep things under the rug and pretend it didn’t happen and move on, but I can’t and I don’t want a surface level relationship with them. What do I do?!

TLDR: parents made excuse after excuse not to come to my wedding, not shocked that I’m having a hard time having a relationship with them. Feeling guilty about it and need advice.",1,1753049035.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

My army buddy steered me clear and as a result, I took therapy and became my best self ever 14 weeks after the breakup.  My exwife however have been on several failed rebounds and looks miserable. I can tell she has some tether to me. But she's still convinced that we don't belong together. And I'm convinced that I need to try and work it out with her.  Reconciliation takes on average 6 months to a year if the ex isn't interested. And there's no guarantee they will come back. But I know a little human psychology. Attraction usually returns after time and/or if some mental work is done.  I owe it to her since she gave me 10 years of her life to me and I was a horrible person to her in the last couple years. She's on yet another rebound (she doesn't know I know. Her brother told me).  But I'm making some progress.  Rebounds are volatile by nature and rebounds aren't gonna be OK with her still seeing her ex.  You may thing I'm crazy. But I'm taking accountability for my behavior.  I'm an asshole and it breaks my heart to know it took her killing a 10 year marriage and possibly putting our three girls in the wringer for me to finally understand. So I'm gonna give this a year. No pressing her for romance. Not talking about getting back together. Papers aren't even filed yet. Just living in the moment and showing her day to day that this change in me isn't just a trick. That way,even if I lost her permanently, I will go to my grave knowing I did all I could to save the marriage I myself have doomed. But I'm getting good signs.  Wish me luck!

# The 9 Prompt Frameworks That TRIPLE Your Results

Just pick one framework and fill in the blanks. My favorites are TRACE and COAST.

# 1. TAG (Task · Action · Goal)

**Template:** ""Task: \[what needs doing\]. Action: \[specific steps\]. Goal: \[desired outcome\]"" **Example:** ""Task: Audit my LinkedIn profile. Action: Review each section for clarity and keywords. Goal: 3x more recruiter messages.""

# 2. ERA (Expectation · Role · Action)

**Template:** ""Expectation: \[what you expect\]. Role: \[who ChatGPT should be\]. Action: \[what to do\]"" **Example:** ""Expectation: Brutally honest feedback. Role: Silicon Valley pitch coach. Action: Destroy my startup pitch.""

# 3. APE (Action · Purpose · Expectation)

**Template:** ""Action: \[what to do\]. Purpose: \[why it matters\]. Expectation: \[specific format/outcome\]"" **Example:** ""Action: Rewrite this email. Purpose: Get a 15% raise. Expectation: Confident but not arrogant tone.""

# 4. CARE (Context · Action · Result · Example)

**Template:** ""Context: \[situation\]. Action: \[what you need\]. Result: \[desired outcome\]. Example: \[reference point\]"" **Example:** ""Context: B2B SaaS at $50k MRR plateau. Action: Growth strategy. Result: Hit $100k in 90 days. Example: How Lemlist scaled.""

# 5. RACE (Role · Action · Context · Expectation)

**Template:** ""Role: \[who to be\]. Action: \[what to do\]. Context: \[background\]. Expectation: \[specific output\]"" **Example:** ""Role: McKinsey consultant. Action: Analyze this P&L. Context: Series A startup. Expectation: 3 cost-cutting opportunities.""

# 6. RISE (Request · Input · Scenario · Expectation)

**Template:** ""Request: \[what you want\]. Input: \[data provided\]. Scenario: \[use case\]. Expectation: \[format/detail\]"" **Example:** ""Request: Sales script. Input: Product features attached. Scenario: Cold calling CTOs. Expectation: 30-second pitch with objection handlers.""

# 7. TRACE (Task · Role · Action · Context · Example)

**Template:** ""Task: \[objective\]. Role: \[persona\]. Action: \[steps\]. Context: \[situation\]. Example: \[model output\]"" **Example:** ""Task: Write viral hook. Role: Twitter growth expert. Action: Create 5 variations. Context: AI productivity tips. Example: 'I spent $50k on courses...'""

# 8. COAST (Context · Objective · Actions · Steps · Task)

**Template:** ""Context: \[current state\]. Objective: \[goal\]. Actions: \[what to do\]. Steps: \[how to do it\]. Task: \[specific deliverable\]"" **Example:** ""Context: 1000 email list. Objective: 10k in 60 days. Actions: Content + paid ads. Steps: Week-by-week plan. Task: Complete growth playbook.""

# 9. ROSES (Role · Objective · Steps · Expected Solution · Scenario)

**Template:** ""Role: \[expertise needed\]. Objective: \[end goal\]. Steps: \[process\]. Expected Solution: \[what success looks like\]. Scenario: \[constraints/context\]"" **Example:** ""Role: Performance marketer. Objective: $10k ad spend, 5x ROAS. Steps: Campaign structure. Expected Solution: Day-by-day optimization plan. Scenario: Black Friday launch.""

# 8 Power Prompting Techniques That 10x Your Results

# 1. ReAct (Reason + Act)

**How it works:** Make ChatGPT think before acting **Example:** ""First, analyze why our conversion rate dropped 40%. Then, create an A/B test plan to fix it. Explain your reasoning at each step.""

# 2. Chain-of-Thought (Step-by-Step Reasoning)

**How it works:** Force logical progression **Example:** ""Is this startup idea viable? Think through: 1) Market size 2) Competition 3) Technical feasibility 4) Unit economics. Show work for each step.""

# 3. Tree-of-Thought (Multiple Paths)

**How it works:** Explore different solutions simultaneously **Example:** ""Generate 3 completely different marketing strategies for my SaaS. Compare effectiveness, cost, and timeline. Pick the winner and explain why.""

# 4. Self-Ask (Break Down Complex Questions)

**How it works:** Decompose big problems into smaller ones **Example:** ""Why did our best developer quit? First, list all possible sub-questions we need to answer. Then tackle each one systematically.""

# 5. Few-Shot (Learning from Examples)

**How it works:** Show 2-3 examples of what you want **Example:**

    Bad subject line: ""Newsletter""
    Good subject line: ""You're losing $50k/year (here's why)""
    
    Bad subject line: ""Update""
    Good subject line: ""Emergency: Your account expires in 24 hours""
    
    Now write one for my product launch:

# 6. Role-Play (Specialized Personas)

**How it works:** Assign specific expertise and perspective **Example:** ""You're Paul Graham. Roast my startup idea. Be brutal. Focus on: Why will this fail? What am I not seeing? End with one path to possible success.""

# 7. Reflexion (Self-Critique and Revise)

**How it works:** Built-in quality control **Example:** ""Write a sales page for my course. Then critique it for: Clarity, persuasion, and uniqueness. Rewrite fixing all issues. Repeat once more.""

# 8. Maieutic (Socratic Method)

**How it works:** Use questions to reach deeper truths **Example:** ""I think we should expand to Europe. Play devil's advocate. Ask me 5 hard questions that expose flaws in this plan. Then give your verdict.""

# The ""Hidden"" 95%: Core Features Most People Miss

This is where Plus/Pro subscriptions become worth 50x their cost. These aren't gimmicks—they're force multipliers.

# 1. Data Analysis

  
Turn a messy spreadsheet into a clean revenue forecast in 30 seconds. That's Data Analysis.  
  
Upload any CSV, Excel, or JSON file and watch magic happen:

* Instant segmentation and trend analysis
* Beautiful visualizations in seconds
* Complex calculations without formulas
* **Example:** ""Upload sales data → Find seasonal patterns → Predict Q4 revenue""

# 2. Deep Research (THIS IS INSANE)

The most underused feature that's worth the Pro price alone:

* Searches hundreds of sources
* Provides citations for everything
* Creates comprehensive reports
* Thinks through problems systematically
* **Example:** ""Research the competitive landscape for AI writing tools, include pricing, features, and market positioning""
* **Pro Limit:** 50 reports/month = $4 per PhD-level research report

# 3. Vision

Your visual AI assistant:

* Analyze screenshots instantly
* Convert sketches to code
* Extract data from images
* Explain complex diagrams
* **Example:** Take a picture of a confusing graph from a presentation and ask, 'Explain this to me like I'm five.'
* Example:  Screenshot any website → ""Code this in React""



# 4. Voice Mode

Not just speech-to-text—it's a conversation:

* Natural back-and-forth dialogue
* Brainstorm while walking
* Practice presentations
* Language learning companion
* **Tip:** Say ""Let me think out loud"" and just ramble. It organizes your thoughts brilliantly.

# 5. Canvas Mode

Real-time collaborative editing:

* Work on documents together
* See changes instantly
* Better than Google Docs for creative work
* Perfect for copywriting iteration
* It's like Google Docs but with a creative partner built-in. Write a line of ad copy, and your AI partner instantly writes five better versions next to it.
* **Power Move:** Start in chat, refine in Canvas

# 6. Projects

Your isolated workspaces:

* Upload context once, use forever
* No more copy-pasting background
* Team knowledge bases
* **Example:** Create ""Q4 Marketing Project"" → Upload all briefs, strategies, data → Every conversation has full context

# 7. Custom GPTs

Build your own specialized AIs:

* Train on your specific needs
* Share with your team
* Automate repetitive tasks
* **Examples:**
   * ""Email Responder"" trained on your writing style
   * ""Code Reviewer"" with your team's standards
   * ""Customer Success Bot"" with your playbooks

# 8. Agent Mode (Operator)

The future is here:

* Browses websites for you
* Fills out forms
* Conducts research autonomously
* Completes multi-step tasks
* **Example:** ""Find and apply to 10 relevant podcasts for me to be a guest""

# 9. Memory

It learns and remembers:

* Your preferences
* Past conversations
* Your business context
* Working style
* **Tip:** Tell it explicitly what to remember: ""Remember that I always prefer bullet points over paragraphs""

# 10. Custom Instructions

Set once, apply everywhere:

* Your tone and style
* Output preferences
* Background context
* **My Settings:** ""You're advising a growth-stage SaaS founder. Be direct, skip fluff, focus on actionable insights.""

# 11. Sora (Text-to-Video)

Create videos from descriptions:

* Product demos
* Social media content
* Training materials
* **Example:** ""Create a 15-second video showing a dashboard transforming from cluttered to clean""

ChatGPT isn't just a tool anymore. It's an intelligence amplifier.

Those using 5% of it are competing against those using 95% of it.

In 6 months, this gap will be insurmountable.

Which side will you be on?

The gap isn't about who's smarter; it's about who has better leverage. This is your chance to get that leverage. The playing field is leveling, and these tools are the great equalizer. The only question is whether you'll pick them up.

**Action Steps:**

1. Bookmark this guide
2. If on Free: Upgrade to Plus today
3. If on Plus: Try Deep Research immediately
4. Set a reminder to revisit in 7 days

**This is the cheapest AI will ever be so use it to the max today!  Lets push all these new data centers to their limits!**

We’re both in our late twenties and have started to narrow down our apartment search, but the process has been overwhelming. Nearly every building we’ve looked at seems to have mixed (or terrible) reviews, so we’re hoping to get some local insight.

We’re currently deciding between Uptown, Knox/Henderson (East of the 75), and Lower Greenville, but aren’t super familiar with the pros/cons of each neighborhood.

Here’s what we’re looking for:

* 2-bedroom apartment under $3K/month
* Within 10–15 minutes of SMU by car
* Walkability is really important to me since I work fully remote. I’d love to be able to walk to a coffee shop, get outside during the day, etc.
* Hoping to avoid anything that feels too loud or undergrad-heavy; we’re looking for something more elevated/mature but still lively.

We’ve also been reading about car break-ins and thefts from garages. Is this a city-wide issue, or does it depend on the specific building/neighborhood?

1m51467,https://www.reddit.com/r/namegames/comments/1m51467/quiet_coffee_shop_on_the_corner/,Quiet Coffee Shop on the Corner,"*Clara Gonzaga had always had an interest for names, which turned out surprisingly fitting given her work as a barista and only got more intense since then. Sometimes, when she isn't one taking the orders she likes to dream up full names of the more unusual customers. And in this exceptionally quiet evening, Clara is having an absolute blast*

**Table 1.** By the table closest to her, there sat a company of four, all teenagers with heavy-looking back-packs and loads of notebooks with extremely advanced physics formulae. The company's leader probably was the girl who was dressed all punk-y and had her hair in a Chelsea cut dyed bright hot pink. Right now, after ordering latte with a dangerous amount of espresso shots, she was furiously scribbling an equation with a glitter gel pen. Next to her a short and stocky yet obviously athletic ginger boy with americano in hand and ungodly amount of fandom and science-related pins on his jean jacket. In front of them was another boy, sitting with his spindly legs up on the chair, thick glasses perched high and eyes deep into a textbook. He definitely looked like some old-timey musician, though Clara couldn't place who exactly (or maybe that's what his 1960s mod moptop did with glasses not helping either). She wasn't the one taking his order, but judging by tone of his voice he was already heavily overcaffeinated. And last but not least that kind of kid who was constantly cracking everyone else up and seemingly hanged out there for company rather than for study. Everything about his look was reeking of ambition and generational wealth. Well except his demeanour and an Alice band with fuzzy cat-ears. He was very casually waiting for his cappucino.

**Table 2.** And there, it seemed, a date was taking place. She saw the first girl rushing to the coffeeshop with something wrapped in pack paper without even taking off her labcoat (not that surprising, stem majors and young research assistants from nearby college do this all the time). She seemed somewhat overworked and was definitely a ""reliable, serious but loosens up wildly"" sort which definitely mashed well with her nerdy yet artistic style. While waiting for her date who was a tad late she ordered herself an iced latte and started checking something in her phone. Then her date finally rolled in and turned out to be a young woman of about the same age and probably also either studying or already working in university. She had that rock star couldn't-care-less swagger going on. Having ordered and taken her doppio, she plopped into a chair in the most jaunty manner, poured there two packages of sugar and they started talking. Talking about everything but mostly about music and musical theatre rehearsal where they probably first met.

**Table 3.** This girl looking like she either time-travelled from 1970s music festival or was heading to a ren faire was sitting there with dices, a brick-thick book in an eye-gougingly colourful cover and a gaming laptop fully covered in AtLA stickers. She was typing something at lightning speed then deleting everything and heavily sighing, her bubble tea already half-empty. She was sometimes throwing her rainbow-coloured glittery dices or looking into window while almost zoning out, after which seemed to have a brand-new energy surge. Then after some time here came streamer level headphones, her keyboard gained a neon rainbow backlight and let here be minecraft.

**Table 4.** This was an unusual customer for a cafe mostly frequented by students and shoolchildren. A lady, quite old but visibly very athletic and stately, came to the coffeeshop, as she did often, with her two little granddaughters, the younger of whom, a girl of about eight years of age, immensely loves local hot chocolate and caramel apples and is (probably due to her childhood curiosity) one of those surprisingly rare people who actually read books and comics lining the walls of the coffeeshop. The older one, who probably tasted all their culinary variety at least once, is a bit of a tomboy and takes the keenest interest towards the piano (that also normally stands here mostly for the decoration). And given the tempo at which she already taps on something in her iPad, Clara could already feel that the kid will quite likely go far. Their gran? Usually takes one americano without sugar.

**Table 5.** And right in front of the table 3, there was happening another perfect brainstorm - another college-aged young man in an anime-patterned graphic t-shirt and a flanel plaid jacket was sitting there with a laptop and was sometimes answering seemingly incessant and stressful for him phone calls about his research for a conference while trying to be as quite as possible. In the meantime he was almost aggressively typing something on his laptop, stressing over his research, flipping over numerous pages and making a full-on barricade of various encyclopediae on his table.

Chapter One

The air was unnaturally still—no birdsong, no wind rustling through the pines, only the faint hum of cicadas drifting in from the south.
Ellen Brandt, a Ranger of the National Parks Service, based in Humboldt County, stood at the edge of the clearing; binoculars pressed to her face. The torn fence lay at her feet, splintered posts strewn like toothpicks.  She lowered the binoculars, her good eye catching the late-afternoon light glinting off something metallic. Squatting, she traced the largest print—a three-toed mark, each claw imprint more than three inches long. She slid her gloved fingers across the edge of the depression. It matched those she had encountered earlier in the day at a goat farm on the outskirts of Orick. They had numerous herds of Elk around here, but the sightings, and the damage, were certainly unlike anything caused by the resident Elk population. She had seen the mobile footage from further up the River Klamath; a dome-shaped animal, flared with bony knobs, white bones protruding like angry thorns. Fierce as hell. Not built for killing, not unless provoked. But unpredictable. Territorial. Wild. And now loose in the California wilderness.
 She had heard the dramatic accounts from the Lockwood Manor, some eight miles to the south, and the reports of numerous dinosaurs having been inadvertently released. The circumstances of that release were now subject to Federal Government investigation. 

At her waist, her radio crackled. She slapped the side of it until it spat out static. Ellen rose, shouldering her rifle. Each step towards the edge of the trees echoed too loudly in her ears. She paused, listening; a distinct crack of wood, a soft thud. Her heart kicked. She ducked under a low branch, the bristles scraping the back of her jacket. The tracks led uphill now, toward a shallow ravine cutting across the ridge. Ellen swallowed. She glanced at the slope above her. It was too steep for the Stygimoloch to climb easily, yet those tracks ascended as if the creature had vaulted from one ledge to the next.

A low snort reached her—brief, guttural. She froze, tense as a coiled trap. Then something shifted in the brush: a mass of mottled gray and brown, scuttling closer. She raised her rifle, finger hovering near the trigger, but didn’t take the shot. She wasn’t here to kill. Contain. 

The Stygimoloch burst from the undergrowth fifteen feet ahead, halting with jackhammer breaths. Its dome-head bobbed, nostrils flaring, eyes gleaming. Their eyes met: hers calm and measured, its wide and frantic. It trembled, back leg crooked. Either it was hurt, or terrified. Maybe both.

She took a careful step forward. “Hey, buddy. Easy.”

The creature chirped—a sound like gravel dropping into a tin can—and backed away. Its claws dug into the dirt, half in warning, half in pain. It was smaller than she expected — maybe five feet long, gangly in the legs. Its olive-brown hide was streaked with burrs and pine sap. Flanks thin. Ribs visible. 

The Stygimoloch hesitated, and then lowered its head and nudged under a rotten log with its horned skull, flipped it, and stuck its snout in deep. A quick lurch and the snap of mandibles: it surfaced chewing beetles. A few dropped from its jaw, crawling down its chin like living crumbs.

It sneezed once, shook its head, and returned to its rummaging. Ellen watched, eyes narrowing. It was behaving like a frightened, clever omnivore — not a monster. Not a threat.

Just a lost thing. She took one cautious step forward.

A twig snapped beneath her boot.

The Stygimoloch froze. It turned, eyes locking on hers. For a moment, neither of them moved. Then, the creature let out a soft chirp — questioning, confused — and backed a step, lowering its head as if uncertain whether to flee or charge.
Ellen didn’t raise her rifle. She whispered, “Easy, kid. I’m not your enemy.”
The Stygimoloch twitched its head, sniffed the air — and bolted. Gone in a blur of limbs and panic, crashing through the ferns and vanishing into the dark pines beyond the ravine. No hesitation. No fight. Just raw fear.

That’s when Ellen heard it.

Crunch. Bone and gristle. Loud. Close. Then came the smell — metallic, sour, and fresh. Blood.

She turned slowly. Emerging from the trees opposite where the Stygimoloch had fled was something far larger. Something that didn’t belong. At first, it was just a snout — reddish in colour and stout in shape — jaws clamped around the limp, bloody body of a goat. It’s box shaped head led to two fearsome eyes, leading further up to two protruding horns atop its head; one on either side. Then shoulders as broad as a truck. Sinewy legs, thick tail dragging behind. Reddish-brown hide mottled with darker patterns. Eyes like polished onyx.

Carnotaurus.

The predator paused, eyes scanning, nostrils flaring. The goat’s limp head bobbed with each movement, its neck torn open, entrails trailing like ribbons from the beast’s mouth.
Ellen didn’t move.

The rifle felt absurdly small in her grip. She knew the Carnotaurus by reputation: fast, brutal, with a head like a battering ram and jaws designed to crush bone.

She held her breath. The Carnotaurus took a step forward, goat still in its teeth, and paused — sniffed the air again. Its nostrils wrinkled.

 Eyes narrowed. Then it gave a low, rumbling growl, vibrating through the soil beneath Ellen’s boots.
It had her scent.
But it didn’t charge.

It turned — almost lazily — and lumbered back the way it came, vanishing into the trees as if she wasn’t even worth the effort.
Ellen waited a full thirty seconds before moving.

Only when the forest swallowed the last sound of its footsteps did she let her lungs refill. She looked toward where the Stygimoloch had vanished.

Then she raised her sat-radio. “Dispatch, this is Ranger Brandt in Sector Nine. I need immediate escalation. Confirmed Stygimoloch sighting, juvenile. But more urgent — I’ve got visual confirmation of a live Carnotaurus. Adult. Dragging livestock.” 

Chapter Two

Marin County Police Precinct, California — 9:32 PM, Two Days After the Incident

The rain had turned to a slow, steady drizzle, coating the precinct windows in blurred streaks. The kind of weather that made bad memories feel fresh again.

Lieutenant Don Jackson sat in the gloom of his office, the only light coming from a green-shaded desk lamp and the ember of the cigarette burning low between his fingers. The smell of old tobacco and damp carpet filled the room.

His desk was a mess — unfiled reports, half-signed warrants, a coffee cup crusted with yesterday’s sludge. He stared at a single photo propped beneath his monitor. A girl, about ten. Blonde. Smiling like she trusted the world.

His daughter. Gone for more than twenty years now.

A knock broke the silence. The door creaked open and Detective Ray Ferrarro stepped in, soaked through from the rain, jacket clinging to him like regret. His eyes were dark-circled and sharp, but his face was gaunt — worn thin by divorce hearings and weeks of sleeping on his brother’s couch.

“Boss?” he said. “You got a mo?”
Jackson didn’t turn around. “You look like hell.”
“Cheers,” Ray scoffed, “I’d say the same to you, but let’s face it, you know it.”
“Anything?” Jackson asked gruffly, not bothering to look up.
“We’ve got two Fed types in the interview room. Said they needed to see us personally. Wouldn’t say why.”
Jackson finally stood, exhaling smoke. “They show badges?”

Ray nodded. “But not FBI. Something else.”
Jackson reached for his coat, pulling it over his tired frame with practiced ease. “Let me guess — black suits, dry shoes, no names?”
“Close. One’s a Hollis. The other didn’t talk much. Called themselves BCTM.”
Jackson froze in the act of buttoning his collar. “BCTM? Never heard of it.”
“Biological Containment and Threat Management. Sounds like a horror movie department.”
Jackson grunted. “Sounds like something the government made up this morning. Let me guess? The situation in Orick?” 
“Lockwood Manor?” Ray frowned.
“The very same.” Jackson grunted. 

They found the agents in Interview Room 2, waiting.

Agent Hollis sat at the table, hands folded, expression unreadable. Silver-streaked hair tied tight behind her head, black suit crisp and spotless. Her eyes tracked Jackson and Ferrarro as they entered — not with interest, but with assessment.
Next to her stood Agent Wick, tall, broad-shouldered, and silent. He didn’t bother with introductions. Just stared at them like he already knew everything.
Jackson pulled out a chair slowly. “Lieutenant Don Jackson. This is Detective Ferrarro. Why are you in my house?”
Hollis gave a slight nod. “We appreciate your time. I’ll get to the point.”
Jackson shrugged, “I think we’d all appreciate that.”
Hollis eyed him suspiciously and then opened a slim laptop and turned the screen toward them. A security still: the face of a girl. Dark hair. Pale. Dressed in a dark red hoodie. Ten years old. Blue eyes wide, caught mid-step as she moved through a shattered doorway.
“This is Maisie Lockwood,” Hollis said. “She’s missing.”
Ray squinted. “That’s the kid from the news. The erm, well we call it the situation right?”
Hollis tapped the touchpad. The screen changed — surveillance footage. Maisie running down a marble hallway. Screams in the distance. Behind her, two adults whose faces weren’t fully evident on the recording.
“She fled the manor with these two, their identities we haven’t yet confirmed.” Hollis continued. “We have reason to believe they’ve taken her off-grid. Last sighting was northeast of Sacramento. Since then, nothing.”
Jackson frowned. “You’ve got every agency in the country sniffing around Lockwood’s corpse. Why come to us?”
“Because this isn’t just a kidnapping,” Hollis said, her voice flat. “Maisie is not Benjamin Lockwood’s biological granddaughter. She is the product of advanced, unregulated genetic engineering. She’s the first confirmed human clone.”
The silence that followed was absolute.
Ray stared at her. “That’s not— you’re not serious.”
“She’s genetically identical to Lockwood’s late daughter,” Hollis said. “Created without public knowledge. We believe this may have been a continuation of InGen’s early experiments. Off-books. Isolated.”
Jackson leaned back slowly, cigarette forgotten in his fingers. “So this girl isn’t just missing. She’s classified.”
“She’s proprietary,” Wick said, his voice deep and soft. “And now she is absent.”
“You mean missing?” Jackson corrected.
Hollis eyed him for a moment, then nodded, “Indeed, missing.”
Jackson sat forward slowly, eyes narrowing. “You’re saying this girl was never legally born. But someone had to be responsible for her. Parental rights, custody… Something.”
Agent Hollis nodded, unfazed. “Technically, yes. While Sir Benjamin Lockwood claimed her as his granddaughter in public records, the real legal custodian — based on internal Foundation documentation — was Eli Mills. He was named in a proprietary trust agreement filed through a holding company five years ago.”
Ferrarro raised a brow. “Mills was her legal guardian?”
Hollis replied evenly. “Only on paper. But yes — he had effective legal and biological authority over her under the guise of asset oversight.”
“Asset,” Jackson repeated bitterly. “Asset?” 
Wick finally spoke, his voice low and gravel-edged. “That’s what she was to them. A controlled genetic prototype. The papers don’t call her a person. They call her a recombinant intellectual property object.”
Ferrarro’s disgust was visible. “Jesus.”
Jackson tilted his head. “And Mills? What happened to him?”
Hollis exchanged a look with Wick — brief, unreadable.
“We believe he was killed during the breach,” she said carefully. “We recovered part of a corpse in the rear courtyard — a left leg, detached below the knee, still wearing a personalized loafer linked to Mills. DNA confirmation is… pending. The remains had been partially consumed.”
“Consumed?” Ferrarro said.
Wick clarified, flatly: “Bitten through. Large jaw radius. Serrated pressure damage. Likely from one of the more aggressive assets — maybe the prototype. Maybe something else. We don’t know.”
Jackson’s eyes narrowed. “So, he’s dead. So we can move on from that then so who else was there involved? And what of these two adults captured on camera?”
“We don’t know much about them yet.” Hollis nodded, “That’s why we need you two on this. It’s a federal case, but we need to also run this under the appearances of a genuine missing person investigation.”
“A genuine missing person investigation?” Jackson scoffed, sitting back in his seat. 
Hollis nodded, “Correct. This is a sensitive matter, but equally, we recognise the fact that the asset’s consciousness and –“
“Asset.” Jackson shook his head, “There you go again. This is a child we are talking about Agent Hollis.”
Hollis’s eyes didn’t waver. “We recognize that, Lieutenant. That’s why this is as much a humanitarian case as it is a security one. Maisie’s cognitive functions have been monitored. She exhibits emotional responses, memory recall, and complex problem-solving skills—far beyond what we expected for a prototype.”
Ferrarro leaned in. “So, you’re saying she’s aware?”
“Yes,” Hollis confirmed. “She’s aware. And she’s capable of making decisions. Which complicates matters. The Foundation can’t simply… reclaim her without due process. Not without risking exposure.”
Jackson ran a hand through his greying hair. “So, you want us to find her before anyone else does. Before she can make a move. Before she becomes a problem.”
Wick gave a tight nod. “Precisely.”
Jackson’s eyes flashed with anger. “And what about these two adults on the footage? What do they want with her?”
Hollis shook her head. “That’s still under investigation.”
Ferrarro glanced toward the rain-streaked window. “Kidnapping or rescue mission, huh? That complicates the narrative.”
Wick’s voice dropped lower. “Complicated enough to warrant strict operational secrecy. We can’t afford leaks—especially with the recent public exposure of dinosaur assets. If news of a human clone surfaced, the fallout would be catastrophic.”
Jackson’s lips tightened. “And that’s why you need two burnt-out cops to run point on a sensitive national security nightmare.”
Hollis met his gaze steadily. “Because you have nothing left to lose, Lieutenant. And because the truth is buried deeper than you realize.”
She paused, then added gravely, “And there’s more. This isn’t just about the girl. The breach at Lockwood Manor released multiple large dinosaurs into the surrounding wilderness. Carnivores and herbivores alike.”
Wick nodded. “We’ve had reports of at least fourteen major species on the loose. Including a Tyrannosaur. The environment around the estate is now a danger zone.”
Jackson’s brow furrowed. “So you want us to find a missing kid while avoiding bloody theme park predators running wild?”
“Exactly,” Hollis said. “Every step outside the estate is a risk. You’re not just hunting a ghost—you’re walking into a jungle of death.”
The room fell silent, the weight of unspoken consequences hanging between them like a dark cloud.
Jackson finally lit his cigarette, the tip glowing faintly in the dim light.
“Alright,” he said quietly. “We’ll find her. But make one thing clear—we’re not hunting a damn asset. We’re finding a kid.”
Hollis gave a curt nod. “Understood.”



Chapter Three

Ranger Ellen Brandt crouched low behind a fallen log, the rough bark digging into her palms as she scanned the thick undergrowth ahead. The forest was a tangle of towering pines and brambles, mottled sunlight flickering through the canopy. The scent of damp earth and crushed leaves filled her nostrils, mixing with the faint, musky odour that could only mean one thing: dinosaur.
The tracks were unmistakable—three-toed footprints pressed deeply into the soft soil, fresh and still moist. The size matched the Stygimoloch. Unlike the predators that haunted this forest, the Stygimoloch was an omnivore, more likely to root for insects and plants than hunt prey. But it was wild, scared, and unpredictable.
Ellen’s eyes caught a subtle movement near a patch of broken branches. She edged closer, careful to keep her weight balanced and her breath steady. A tuft of broken twigs and disturbed dirt marked where the creature had been foraging. There were faint, scattered bites on leaves—fresh and jagged—and the telltale scrape marks where the animal had been digging for insects beneath the bark.
The forest held its breath.
Then came a soft snuffling noise, like a huff of breath mixed with the rustle of leaves. Ellen tensed, gripping the strap of her worn rifle. The Stygimoloch was close.
Suddenly, it emerged—a curious and cautious figure stepping lightly through the underbrush. The creature’s small, muscular frame was covered in mottled scales, and its dome-shaped skull gleamed wet in the patchy sunlight. It sniffed the air, nostrils flaring as it pressed its snout into the ground.
Ellen exhaled slowly, raising her radio to whisper, “This is Ranger Ellen. I’ve located the Stygimoloch. It’s currently feeding on plants and insects. Appears scared but non-aggressive.”
A faint crackle responded over the radio, static filling the silence. Her eyes never left the creature.
A second voice responded sharply, steady but tense. “Roger that. I’m closing in. Hold position.”
Hearing this, the animal jerked its head up, snorted, turned and bolted once more through the trees. 
Ellen turned to see her partner, Marcus—a younger ranger with quick reflexes and an unshakable calm in the face of danger—emerging from the underbrush a few meters behind her. His tranquilizer rifle was slung over his shoulder, the weight familiar but daunting in these conditions.
“Easy,” Ellen cautioned, eyes narrowing. “It’s frightened, not hostile. We need to get close, but calm.”
Marcus nodded, fingers flexing around the grip of his rifle. “Right. No sudden moves.”
They moved carefully through the dense forest, stepping lightly over fallen branches and weaving between gnarled roots. The Stygimoloch’s tracks were faint but fresh, broken twigs and disturbed leaves marking its path. The creature was clearly disoriented—no longer foraging, but fleeing, scrambling to survive in a world turned upside down.
Suddenly, a flash of mottled hide caught their eye—a blur darting behind a thicket. Ellen froze, signalling Marcus to hold. The Stygimoloch’s dome-shaped skull appeared briefly through a gap, nostrils flaring as it snuffled the earth, searching for insects and roots.
“This is it,” Marcus whispered. “I’m going to try for a tranquilizer shot.”
Ellen’s breath hitched. “Wait—give it a second. Don’t startle it.”
But Marcus was already raising his rifle, steadying his aim.
The creature, sensing the movement, bolted. With a sudden burst of speed, it crashed through the undergrowth—branches snapping, leaves exploding in its wake. Ellen and Marcus gave chase, hearts pounding as they sprinted over uneven ground.
“Don’t lose it!” Ellen yelled, dodging a low-hanging branch.
The Stygimoloch twisted sharply, weaving through the dense forest with surprising agility. It was clear it just wanted to escape, not fight.
But then it stopped—abruptly, turning its broad head towards them. Its dark, intelligent eyes locked onto Marcus, nostrils flaring in alarm and fear.
For a moment, time froze.
Then the creature charged.
The Stygimoloch’s charge hit Marcus like a battering ram. The heavy, dome-shaped skull connected with brutal force, sending a shockwave through his body. He went down hard, a sickening crunch echoing through the trees as his pelvis smashed against a jagged root hidden beneath the leaf litter.
Marcus gasped, a strangled sound caught in his throat. His legs spasmed uncontrollably, one twisted at an unnatural angle. Blood seeped rapidly through his torn pants, pooling dark and sticky beneath him. The impact had shattered bones beneath the skin—pelvic fragments piercing muscle and tearing arteries.
His face contorted in shock and agony, eyes wide and glassy with pain. Every breath he took was ragged, shallow, as if the shock was stealing his very breath away. His hands clawed at the dirt, grasping blindly for something solid.
Ellen dropped to her knees beside him, her own breath hitching at the sight. “Marcus! Stay with me! Help is coming, hold on!”
But Marcus’s eyelids fluttered, sweat slicking his pale forehead. The pain was overwhelming—deep, searing, relentless. His fingers trembled, grasping at Ellen’s sleeve, a silent plea for mercy or relief.
A dark stain blossomed across his lower back as blood seeped beneath him. Ellen’s mind raced. He was bleeding internally, badly. If they didn’t get him help fast, he wouldn’t last long out here.
“Stay awake, Marcus. You hear me? We’re getting you out,” she said, voice tight with urgency.
His lips parted in a faint whisper, “Can’t… move… hurts too much…”
Ellen swallowed hard, pressing a makeshift bandage over the wound, the fabric quickly soaked crimson. She gritted her teeth and radioed for immediate medevac support, her hands shaking but steady.
Around them, the forest seemed eerily quiet, as if mourning the violence that had just erupted beneath its canopy. The Stygimoloch was gone—escaped—but the brutal reminder of its power lay broken and bleeding at Ellen’s feet.

The rain drummed a steady rhythm on the windshield as Lieutenant Don Jackson and Detective Ray Ferrarro wound their way through the narrow, forest-choked roads leading to Lockwood Manor. Mist curled between the trees like smoke, and above the canopy, thunder rolled low and distant. It had rained most of the morning, and the roads shimmered with wet leaves and streaks of mud carved by heavy vehicles.
At last, through the thinning fog, the estate emerged—a brooding silhouette atop a hill, like something out of a gothic novel. Lockwood Manor stood tall and unbowed by the chaos of recent days, its Victorian spires and ornate stonework seemingly untouched. But the chaos hadn't left. It had simply moved outside.
The grounds were alive with activity. Federal agents in black tactical gear moved in small, precise formations, radios crackling, fingers always near triggers. Rows of SUVs and unmarked armoured vans crowded the driveway, floodlights gleaming off their rain-slicked surfaces. A make-shift mobile command centre buzzed with tension, wires trailing like veins from its sides. “RESTRICTED AREA” signs lined temporary barricades, backed by camouflaged personnel carriers.
As Jackson slowed the aging brown sedan toward the outer checkpoint, a young agent approached, her Kevlar vest damp and her expression unreadable. She scanned their credentials in silence, checked her earpiece, and then wordlessly waved them through.
The gates groaned open, revealing the sprawling courtyard now transformed into a staging zone for federal containment and forensic teams. A faint metallic tang hung in the air, ozone and something more organic beneath it—blood, maybe, or fear.
Ferrarro whistled low. “Jesus. This place is like a war zone.”
Jackson kept his hands on the wheel, eyes scanning the perimeter. “Might as well be.”
They passed a forensics tent marked with hastily taped-over logos. Inside, a technician was photographing a ragged, three-toed footprint in the mud—nearly the size of a trash can lid.
Ferrarro leaned back in his seat. “You know, Don, I still can’t get over this Jurassic World fiasco.”
Jackson didn’t respond immediately.
“All that money. All that tech. And it collapses because some billionaire wants to play God,” Ferrarro went on, voice thick with sarcasm. “A super-rich theme park filled with genetically engineered monsters. Who greenlit that? Who thought it was a good idea?”
Jackson gave a dry grunt. “The kind of people who never have to clean up the bodies.”
“Exactly,” Ferrarro said, waving a hand toward the chaos outside. “They built their dreams on a damn island, and when it blew up, the fallout lands here—on real people. And who’s left holding the bag? Not the investors. Not the board. It’s us. As ever.""
Jackson pulled up near the front portico. Federal agents milled around, a few escorting biologists in hazmat suits toward the forest trails with tranquilizer rifles and long-range dart launchers. One of them wore an oxygen tank.
Ferrarro shook his head. “You know, Jess and Ralph begged me to take them. Jurassic World. Back when it first opened.”
“You didn’t go?”
“Couldn’t afford it. Do you know what they charged?! One grand a day, two grand a day. That place wasn’t built for people like me. It was a playground for the elite. Didn't even have a damn coupon day! People who thought a billion-dollar attraction full of apex predators was ‘safe.’” He turned his head, watching as a soldier adjusted a motion sensor on the manor wall. “And now they’ve let it all loose. Not just in the wild—but in our wild.”
Jackson let the silence sit. The pain in Ferrarro’s voice hung heavy, but there was nothing to say. The truth was, they were all dealing with the aftermath of someone else's dream turned nightmare.
They exited the vehicle, the rain now a light mist. They were quickly met by a junior agent and ushered inside.
The interior of Lockwood Manor was stunning—vaulted ceilings, mahogany banisters, marble floors—but it bore the scars of recent chaos. Mud had been tracked through the halls. Sections of floorboards had been removed for evidence. And the lingering scent of antiseptic couldn’t quite mask something more primal—like the musk of animals and the ghost of panic.
They were brought to a briefing room near the west wing. The lights were low, the windows covered. Maps and satellite imagery lit up a pair of wall-mounted screens. The hum of electronics blended with the muffled thunder outside.
Waiting for them was a woman in a dark field suit, early forties, her stance straight as a rifle barrel and her eyes sharp behind wire-rimmed glasses. She didn’t offer a handshake.
“I’m Agent Reynolds,” she said. “You’ll be working in coordination with Biological Containment and Threat Management.”
Jackson raised an eyebrow. “Catchy name. But we’re already acquainted with your office.”
“It’s not about branding,” Reynolds said flatly. “It’s about scope.”
She turned to the screen, tapping keys to bring up images: aerial shots of the manor and surrounding woodlands, thermal readings, and blurred security footage.
“Let’s be clear from the outset,” she continued. “This is a missing person’s case. That’s your remit. Nothing else. You do not engage any assets. You do not pursue leads outside the girl. You do not interfere with containment operations. Understood?”
“Understood,” Jackson said, though his tone wasn’t convincing.
Reynolds tapped again. A new slide came up: grainy footage of a young girl—Maisie Lockwood—running through a hallway, hand-in-hand with two adults whose faces were obscured.
“This was taken minutes after the breach,” she said. “Maisie Lockwood, age ten. Reported missing. Last seen exiting the premises with an unidentified man and woman—both adult, and likely experienced with field survival. We also have leads on them and –“
“We’ll need everything you’ve got on them.” Jackson folded his arms.
Reynolds paused, “Once we can confirm our intelligence.”
Jackson scoffed, “Look, Agent Reynolds, I don’t want to be rude here, but I’ve been in this game since before you were knee height most likely, if you want me to run this little investigation,, I need the intel.”
Reynolds nodded thoughtfully, “We will see it that you get everything you need.”
Jackson nodded, “And we need to know everything about family, associates, patent owners.”
“You will.” Reynolds replied. 
Jackson folded his arms. “And the grandfather? Lockwood?”
“Deceased. Found in his bed. We believe he was smothered with a pillow. There are signs of a struggle, but nothing conclusive.”
“Murdered,” Ferrarro said.
Reynolds didn’t deny it. “The nanny, Iris, was discovered mauled in the east conservatory. Blood pattern analysis suggests she was attacked by one of the escaped assets.”
“What kind of ‘asset’?” Jackson asked darkly.
Reynolds tapped again. The screen showed another blurry figure—low to the ground, long-limbed, its eyes gleaming in infrared. “We believe the prototype. It escaped containment during the auction.”
“Auction?” Ferrarro asked, frowning.
Reynolds turned to face them fully. “There was an illegal auction held beneath the manor— hybrids and original species, weaponized and sold to private military contractors and black-market buyers. That’s how this all started. That’s how the prototype got loose.”
Jackson’s brow furrowed. “And what is the prototype?”
“We don’t know. Not fully. But it’s larger than a raptor, smaller than a T. rex. Engineered with multiple predator traits. Highly intelligent. Killed at least five individuals during the breach. Confirmed dead.”
Jackson nodded, ""Well that's one down.""
Ferrarro exhaled slowly. “And we’re just looking for a little girl.”
Reynolds didn’t flinch. “Maisie Lockwood is not just a little girl. She’s a classified genetic asset. A human clone, created without oversight, with proprietary DNA linked directly to InGen’s earliest human genome experiments.”
Jackson shook his head slowly. “You’re asking us to find a missing child in a hot zone, wirh limited intel, and you are seemingly intent on being coy with the detail.”
“I’m asking you,” Reynolds said, “to bring her home before someone else gets to her first.”
Jackson pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket.
""No lights in here."" Reynolds scolded.
Jackson grunted and put them back in his pocket. 
Agent Reynolds straightened, her fingers pausing on the remote.
“One more thing,” she said, voice sharp enough to cut through the murmur of radio chatter leaking through the briefing room walls. “This investigation isn’t happening in a vacuum. Multiple external agencies and corporate stakeholders are trying to insert themselves into this operation.”
Jackson’s eyes narrowed. “Meaning?”
“Meaning the scent of proprietary genetics is drawing blood in the water.” Reynolds tapped another button on the screen, which shifted to show a heavily redacted dossier: corporate logos, satellite assets, legal memoranda flagged as ""URGENT"", and several embargoed court orders. “Most notably a company called Biosyn.”
Ferrarro glanced at Jackson. “Who the hell are they?”
“Think InGen’s more discreet and less ethical sibling,” Reynolds said coolly. “Biotechnology conglomerate. Deep ties to defence research. They’ve been circling Lockwood’s holdings for years, trying to get their hands on his private genome archives. Before the events in 2015, they tried to buy out InGen’s patent library but were blocked by Masrani’s legal team.”
“And now?” Jackson asked.
“Now they see an opportunity,” Reynolds said. “Maisie Lockwood isn’t just a missing child. She’s intellectual property. An undocumented human genome replication. The first of her kind — at least that we’re willing to admit exists.”
Ferrarro leaned back in his chair, disgust hardening across his face. “So, they don’t want to help. They want to own her.”
Reynolds gave a small nod. “And they’ve made overtures. Through unofficial channels. A private jet touched down three towns over yesterday — Biosyn registration, though the pilot filed a decoy route.”
Jackson exhaled slowly through his nose. “So, the clock’s ticking.”
Reynolds looked them both dead in the eyes. “This isn’t just a girl lost in the woods. This is a race. And if she falls into the wrong hands—hands with funding, lawyers, and no conscience—then it won’t just be one clone.""
Jackson nodded, ""She's a child for Christ's sake Agent Reynolds.""

So the question of the day? Cant we all just talk in microns to each other until the coffee grinder industry just gets it?

Is this a futile thing to be thinking about? Are there tools out there that help?

=========LATER EDIT===========

I want to clarify - I think you can sense that I am a newbie of sorts. Let me explain.

I have been at this for about 6 months now. And I am starting to draw some early conclusions with going down the rabbit hole. I have been making more and more decent brews and picking up more and more decent coffees. I went into the Reddit rabbit hole and started asking all kinds of things to learn more.

The frustration begins with talking in -

1. clicks or rotations on the.....
2. K6 vs P2 vs ZP *whatever* versus other codes for grinders......
3. what a person considered to be dialed in from one grinder to the next versus talking in a more of a single universal measure
4. then keeping in mind that the grinder setting for that ""recipe"" is related to a method of brewing. 
   1. And the method of brewing all on its own rabbit hole.

If you reach out to a head roaster at a local roastery for example and ask for what they considered to be dialed in for their coffee (and trust me - I get taste is a whole other layer) for the method of brewing, how should he/she/they talk to you to convey you what they believe is the best grind size?

I’ve been actively trying to meet someone good for the past 6 months—with no luck so far. Not just any man… but one who’s emotionally available, kind, and intentional.

I’m talking about the kind of man who:
	•	Calls at least once a day
	•	Checks in with thoughtful little messages during the day
	•	Asks how your day is going and genuinely listens
	•	Remembers the small things you tell him
	•	Offers emotional support without being prompted
	•	Shows up for you, even in small everyday ways
	•	Talks about the future with you in it
	•	Feels safe—like home, not a project
	•	Is consistent with his actions, not just words
	•	Doesn’t make you guess how he feels

Have any of you met someone like this? If so—where did you meet them? Was it online, through a friend, at work, a random coffee shop moment?

I’m starting to think good men are either hiding or already taken 😅
But maybe I’m looking in the wrong places? Is this too much to ask for? Why are men so underwhelming and nonchalant these days 😭😭 AIO

It’s been more of a friends with benefits situation as we are both in super stressful jobs with very little time to commit to a full of relationship. 

Over the years I’ve found myself falling for him little by little. Now a 2 months ago I saw on his socials that he now has a girlfriend. This came as a shock to me as we had been together a few nights before and he never mentioned anything about her. I stopped flirting with him, changed coffee shops so I wouldn’t have to see him and I tried to draw a line under it and move onto my life. 

He didn’t try to reach out at all until this week. He messaged asking how I was and if I was mad at him for something. Wanting to keep the peace I said I wasn’t mad at him and I was just super busy. He started getting all flirty and asked me to come over and when I mentioned that his girlfriend wouldn’t like that he said that he could keep a secret if i could. 

Now this came as a massive shock to me because I’ve known this guy since I was 10 years old and he’s always been the sweetest kindest person. I never thought he would ever be the kind of person to cheat. I decided not to go over out of respect for his new girl, but I feel like my heart is hurting thinking about it because he is the only person that has ever made me feel wanted and I don’t know what to do. 

He’s been suggesting hook ups and saying how much he misses me over the last few days  and I’ve been changing the subject but I know deep down that I really want to go and tell him how I feel. Part of me wonders though if he likes me enough to cheat with me then why wasn’t he making a move before he met this girl. The whole issue has me very confused, sad, hurt and a little bit angry with him. If anyone has any suggestions on my next move they would be much appreciated, am I a bad person for wanting to give in ? xx",2,1753047058.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1m50p1v,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1m50p1v/review_st_regis_bal_harbour_miami_fl/,"Review: St. Regis Bal Harbour, Miami FL","My first review, I'll do my best to get the detail down that I have appreciated so much from other people on this sub. I've attached some pictures of the room, but totally forgot to take pictures of the rest of the hotel! This was for a 2 night stay in July of 2025.

**Background**: I don't have a huge amount of experience with chubby levels of travel. I've done a stupid amount of travel for work, and have historically saved up all my points from work travel to stay at nicer Marriott/ Hilton properties for personal travel. So- I have a fair amount of experience with Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis, Waldorf Astoria etc., but have not yet 'graduated' to the level of Aman and the like. I'm very close to retirement, so researching properties outside of the Marriott/Hilton/Hyatt universe is one of my favorite things in the chubbytravel community.

**Room**: I had booked a standard room, and was able to use upgrade certificates which put us in an Imperial 1 BR suite. This was an amazing upgrade! The suite is over 1200sqft, with 2 bathrooms, a small but decently stocked kitchen, stackable W/D, and two ocean facing balconies. The furnishings (bed, couch, patio loungers, dining chairs) were all comfortable and in good condition. There were ample towels and toiletries. Florida in summer isn't everyone's cup of tea, but the room was a very comfortable and cool retreat.

**Hotel** **features**: we used some, but not all of the amenities. The tranquility pool was a great spot to spend hours relaxing and people watching. Service was genuine and helpful, and the pool menu had enough variety to keep everyone fed and happy. It wasn't hard to get beach or pool loungers, although shady spots were a bit harder to come by at peak sun hours. I didn't visit the main pool, but it seemed (understandably) noisier with plenty of young kids having fun. We didn't use the e-bikes, gym, or spa. There is really interesting artwork throughout the public areas of the hotel, which kept it from veering too far into bland territory.

**Restaurants**: We had breakfast at Atlantikos, dinner at BH Prime, and room service. The breakfast was fine, but nothing that will stick out as a highlight. I don't get super excited about breakfast though, so possibly a bias. Dinner at BH Prime was great in terms of food quality- we had oysters, steaks, some side dishes and cocktails. This is a newer restaurant for the hotel, replacing a more casual outlet. While the food was tasty, and the service was warm and unobtrusive, I got the sense that they are still working out if they are a steak restaurant or a burger restaurant (both are on the menu). A strange hybrid of gastropub, but with caviar and seafood towers. I don't necessarily think that's a bad thing- my kid and I agreed that it was kind of cool that you could order a $25-30 burger, or a $250 seafood tower. He got the smoked ribeye, and thought it was amazing while evoking fond memories of childhood camping. Room service breakfast was fine, nothing of note. We also had a cocktail and attended a cigar rolling experience- super interesting, and it was fun to bring some souvenir cigars home with us.

**Service**: We had some great service experiences on this trip. It wasn't high touch, but I felt like I was well taken care of. Ahead of the stay, I had email and text communication with the butler and concierge. We were celebrating a milestone achievement for my kid, and the St. Regis staff really made him feel special. We were treated to cake and champagne in the room on the first night, and fruit plates at the pool. I forgot some toiletries, and the staff promptly brought them up. Dinner reservations were made, and subsequently updated as my plans changed- all without fuss or errors. The complimentary coffee service, shoe shine and clothes pressing was handy before going out for dinner.

A couple of very minor **complaints**: I think that a Toto-style toilet would be a welcome upgrade to the bathrooms, and the shower water pressure wasn't anything to get excited about. Probably the thing that surprised me the most was that the espresso/coffee/tea amenities in the room included fake creamer instead of half-and-half or cream. It's a small thing to some people, but I think that chemical tasting International Delights 'creamer' is a travesty. I was able to get a pitcher of cream delivered, but even some Mini-moo pods would be an improvement.

**Summary**: This was a great way to use up some of the remaining upgrade certificates I have with Marriott. The stay was lovely- we felt appreciated and welcome at the hotel. I would very happily stay here again. I think the room rate for the Imperial Suite is about $2500 per night. Is it worth that? Honestly, I don't know! I don't have anything to compare it to as I've historically stayed at corporate hotels. For me personally, I think I would struggle to leap to that level of room rate (unless I miraculously win the lottery or something).

And- can I just acknowledge the time it takes for people to write these reviews? Thank you so much for taking time to share your experiences. I know my review is probably light in details and photos, and it still took a long time to write!! ",8,1753047043.0,chubbytravel,1,1.0,False

1m50myb,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1m50myb/the_lonesome_lover/,The Lonesome Lover,"Hello, I don’t really know how to start this cause I’m not that good on operating apps, but I just need to lift this weight off my back. My sister went missing on Valentine’s Day and so far there have been no leads. I’m really worried cause I’ve discovered things that might mean something really bad happened to my sister. Though the thing is, I know some things about her disappearance. Things that the investigators and my relatives don’t know. Though they don’t believe me cause the app that started this whole thing doesn’t even exist anymore. I’m putting this out there so that maybe someone can help me figure out what happened to her. So here’s the details about my sisters disappearance, to which I don’t believe she’ll return.

In February my sister started getting eager to get in a relationship, considering she hadn’t been in any since highschool and Valentine’s Day was coming up. While we were at her house hanging out together she came up with the idea to find a dating app considering she didn’t know any way else to get into a relationship.

When she left to go to the restroom, she asked me to look on her phone for some dating apps while she was gone, so I did.

I noticed that most of the apps with the most 5 star reviews required a subscription, and considering my sisters financial situation at the time, I decided to not recommend them to her.

I stumbled upon an app titled “Lonesome Lovers”. I looked at the reviews and they were all 5 stars, but I noticed there were only 9 reviews. One of the reviews were from a former friend of mine from high school who was brutally murdered on Valentine’s Day. I was surprised by it, as the last time I had even thought of her was after I saw her death reported on the national news. I ignored it though, as I tried to forget that period of my life where she was in it. I checked, and the app had no subscription fee. I shouted to my sister that I had found an app that seemed perfect, and she came rushing back from the bathroom in excitement. She proceeded to log into the app with joy, as the app seemed to have been exactly what she wanted. Thinking of it now, I should’ve never recommended that app to her.

Over a couple days she kept texting me about how she found a new guy that fit exactly into what she sought out in a man, only for them to be replaced by the next guy she found.

One day she sent me a photo of a guy she found named Mark. I thought he looked pretty cute, so I told her she should go for it. At this point she was getting very stressed due to the fact that Valentine’s Day was in 2 days, and she really wanted to have a date or even a boyfriend by then.

She told me that her and Mark were planning a date on Valentine’s Day, and she had asked me what place they should go to, so I recommended the local coffee shop.

On February 14th at 11:27 AM right before my sister left her house for her date with Mark she texted me, and thanked me for my support and help through her journey. That was the last time me and my sister communicated.

I texted my sister on Valentine’s Day at 3:41 PM, assuming that her date had ended. She didn’t respond. I texted her again at 7:54 PM. No response. I texted her over and over for the next 3 days and she didn’t respond. I decided to ignore it. As I thought maybe her and Mark went on a vacation or something because they realized their bond was incredibly strong. And plus, I’ve always been known as the cautious sister and I’ve overreacted and have gotten very worried over many situations that weren’t even remotely serious, especially when it came to my sister.

After a whole week of waiting for a text from my sister I gave in to my anxiety and went to her apartment. I used the spare key she had given me, and I opened the door. It was completely empty but nothing was odd, or out of place, and then I got a text. I looked at who it was from and it was from her. The text read “hey! me and my spouse have went on a wild vacation, don’t worry about me, we’ll be back soon, love you!”

The text gave me a sense of relief, but I thought the wording in the text was weird, like it was AI generated or something. I decided to ignore my suspicion and go home and just relax.

A couple days later I got a little curious. I remembered my friend who had died and decided to go back to the “Lonesome Lovers” app to see her review. Just to maybe get a little insight on how her life was when I wasn’t in it.

Her review felt so strange. The review was describing things about her life that had never even happened. Like it was AI generated. Then I looked through the other reviews, and they were the same AI generated seeming text. Just to see if maybe they were faking the reviews or just if something was going on, I decided to search up each reviewers name on google.

I was shocked to see an obituary for every single reviewer on the app. Every reviewer had something in common. They were all murdered brutally on Valentine’s Day.

I then saw my sisters review pop up suddenly on the app, it was the same AI seeming text just like the others. That’s when I reported her missing, though knowing the other reviewers fates, I don’t believe my sister will be coming back.",4,1753046891.0,shortscarystories,1,0.83,False

If anyone has any questions or comments, I’d love to hear from you!

Split
- Dinner: Zinfandel Food and Wine Bar (5/5 - special spot)
This is a Michelin recommended restaurant in the middle of the Split old town. Live music, excellent dishes, well presented all of the local Dalmatian cuisine. An excellent meal with excellent service. I had the Prawn Risotto  followed by the Octopus and both were perfect.

- Breakfast: Bokeria (4/5 - good spot)
This is a nice, central brunch spot serving well presented dishes. The menu is a bit small, but the food was lovely. I had the focaccia sandwich.

- Lunch: Roof 68 (2/5 - tourist trap)
We wanted to sit by the marina, so settled for a tourist trap. Overpriced mediocre food. I had the focaccia.

- Dinner: Roko & Cicibela (4/5 - good spot)
This is a really nice dinner spot, but we felt the dishes were good but not incredible. The price also felt a bit high for the quality. But overall I’d recommend. I had the Tuna Tartar, and the Seafood pasta.

- Breakfast: Picasso Pizza & Bar (2/5 - do not recommend for breakfast)
Really cool restaurant, excellent decoration, but not a good focaccia. Although, the portion was HUGE. It also doesn’t feel like split, so I wouldn’t recommend. 

- Dinner: Gudin Pigeria (5/5 - excellent casual spot)
This restaurant blew me away. Super casual outside dining (nothing indoors at all) but the guys really know their stuff. The pork belly and ribs were both amazing, with incredible sides too. The second best pork dish I’ve ever had. I had the pork belly and I regret only ordering 300g.

- Breakfast: Bepa (4/5 - cute little spot)
Cute little brunch spot with the best focaccia I’d had so far. Pretty expensive but in a really great spot for people watching. 

Hvar
- Dinner: Mediterraneo (5/5 - incredible spot)
This is one of the top 5 restaurants I’ve ever been to. Michelin recommended. Beautiful, romantic setting, 5* service, with some amazing food. I had the Octopus carpaccio, shrimp and crab bisque, and the turbot.

- Lunch: Coffee Snob (3/5 - just about good enough)
The focaccia here was okay and it took a while to come. Coffee was great though! Nice to get a lighter roast bean in Europe! 

- Dinner: Family Farm Brusje (2/5 - tourist trap)
We stumbled across this restaurant, and thought it was a local restaurant given its remote location out of Hvar. It’s not, this was an expensive restaurant (all be it with a great view) with very mediocre food. I had the Grilled Octopus which was pretty over cooked.

- Lunch: Toto Bar (3/5 - just about good enough)
We didn’t want a sit down full on lunch so ate at Toto bar instead of Toto restaurant. The burger was fine but (for Croatia) reasonably priced to reflect that. It’s on the beach so limited options.

- Dinner: Alviz Pizza (3-4/5 - just about good enough)
As a Londoner with access to great pizza, the pizza here is poor. But the seafood platter starter, and fried squid were both excellent! And, more reasonably priced than most in Hvar. The setting wasn’t anything special, and it’s very casual

Dubrovnik

- Dinner (Lapad): Maskeron (4/5 - great spot)
Maskeron came up in a number of my Reddit searches, and I was pleased to have visited! Good food, casual but nice enough. Would happily recommend. The starters weren’t very impressive, but I had the Octopus Gnocci for main which was great!

- Lunch (Lapad): Pull Over Bar (2/5 - tourist trap)
The food here was very average, but we wanted a spot on the way to the beach. Wouldn’t recommend. I had the fried shrimp and it was more bread coating than shrimp.

- Dinner (old town): Lucín Kantun (5/5 - great spot)
Another common Reddit recommendation. A bit on the fancy side, this restaurant was wonderful. Just off the busy Main Street in Dubrovnik old town, wonderful menu, excellent service, and probably the best sea bass I’ve ever eaten.

- Lunch (Lapad): Eden (4/5 - good spot)
This is a bit more tucked out the way than some of the others. We sat on the terrace which was nice, and the service was excellent. Unfortunately a good number of the mussels in one of the dishes hadn’t opened, but my dish (lobster and shrimp tagliatelle) was good, although the shrimps were on the small side. The burrata salad to start was lovely though.

- Dinner (Lapad): Vito Napoletana Pizzeria (5/5 - great spot)
As mentioned above, I’m a Londoner with access to great pizza. I’d say this was up there with London pizza, but not winning. This made a nice change to the constant Dalmatian cuisine of the trip. I had the burrata stracciatella.

For the longest time I had been in this state of almost aversion towards romantic and sexual relationships. 

Very recently, I moved back home and I was just in a better headspace to pursue something- not very serious but to just put myself out there and explore. Before this, I had never used dating apps. 

I met this guy (27M) on a dating app- on text he was charmingly funny, surprisingly kind and seemed interested in me. He also brought up taking therapy and seemed reasonable emotionally intelligent (which seems a rarity to me). So after a couple weeks of talking, I met him over coffee. It was super casual, and he mostly talked about himself, and his past relationship. He shared he cheated on ex girlfriend after he had a glow up because he wanted to not pass up on all the attention he was getting. Honestly, I checked out of the prospect of developing any serious romantic interest in him immediately. Cherry on the cake was when he very clearly implied that men don't really have a preference for sexual partners. For the rest of the coffee my attention span dwindeled and I was fidgety, and tired. Also, he paid and didn't let me pay him back. 

For some reason, I had a breakdown on my way back home. It was about the state of affairs of the dating pool, I just felt a bit defeated with the way he talked. Also it was very clear to me that I didn't want to see him again. 

But after I got back home, we got texting and it was surprisingly fun. With time, I realised that I just had such less respect for him that I had the luxury of a rare freeness to be a certain way without obsessing over consequences more than necessary. Also, I was only talking to him for some fun, and was thinking of exploring a very casual setup with him. 

The conversation went on about me taking him out next but because of incompatible schedules plans kept falling through. 

One recurring thing that kept annoying me was the number of times he would put up the disclaimer that he's only looking for something casual- despite me making it clear earlier to be so from my end too. There was a stupid you're not made for this and only for something super serious banter also that he brought up but I shut it down quick, and was supremely annoyed by it. The last time it happened again was my last straw, I felt so disrespected as if I was coming across as this obsessive naive girl who will get her heart broken by him. I made it clear that I didn't like it and brought up not wanting to talk to him further because of this. But he tried to talk me out of it- and I was convinced. The conversation ended into a random pivot to which I responded with an emoji and have been left on seen for a couple weeks now. I also didn't take the initiative of double texting him to just see what he pulls next- but as it turns out he didn't do anything. 

Now, the only thing I'm a bit upset about is that, somehow I've convinced myself that he was a good candidate to explore some low stakes inconsequential fun with because there is just no way I see myself developing any serious feelings for him- so I'm wondering if I should reach out to him after being left on read for weeks or just let it be. I honestly can't figure it out. ",1,1753046712.0,RelationshipIndia,2,1.0,False

1m50jy3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m50jy3,"How do you define what is a ""rave"" and what is not?","Just a curiosity I have. So, I throw parties, specifically rooftop parties in Seattle and Portland. There's DJs, speakers, usually between 100-250 people at them, there's plenty of folks dancing and so forth, but to me, they are just ""parties"". The vibes at them feel totally different than raves do, however I've noticed over the years, especially on social media when someone shares one of our posts there's often a reference made to them being ""rooftop raves"" and I don't bother to correct anyone or anything of course but - it just seems like the definition of a ""rave"" has changed in my lifetime (I did most of my raving in the late 90s and early 2000s for context).

 Now I see people throwing ""coffee raves"" which start at 10 am and take place in coffee shops, ""sailboat raves"" with folks just chilling on kayaks in a big cluster out on the water while a couple of DJs spin nearby on a small boat, a ""matcha rave"" just happened last weekend, started at 2 in the afternoon and it looks like some folks basically just set up speakers and a table in a matcha shop with a controller and played on a Sunday til around 7pm. 

To be clear: I don't have any kind of a ""problem"" with these at all, they all look like people are having a great time as far as I can tell and I like that people are trying out new ideas, for sure.

It just seems like the definition of what that word means has changed in the past 5-10 years - I'm okay with that but do these pictures at all look like a ""rave"" is happening to y'all? Because to me and my rapidly aging eyes, they look like parties to me. 

IG link: www.instagram.com/pacificskylyneclub got some videos up on the page to get a better idea of what they look like when you're there. 

Also - the average age range for these are folks between mid 20s to late 30s, we don't allow any illegal substances at them and we even get permits and Event Insurance for these. Heck, I sometimes even get catering.

I caught a little cold, so I haven't been able to taste coffee or do reviews. However, I was reminded of an idea I had about someone creating a coffee drink specifically for when you've come down with a cold or flu. Maybe you could call it ""cold coffee,"" still brainstorming the name, lol. For now, I'm just imagining a cold brew type drink. Essentially, a highly processed coffee you can drink when you're sick. I know most of the time when I get sick, my taste buds are messed up, so the flavor of these processed beans could cut through your cold and actually taste like an interesting coffee drink. I'd imagine it's an off-profile roast or bean (maybe even a robusta), the idea being that it's something affordable/cheaper you could buy and drink without going through your good beans. An interesting idea for someone and a potential market fit. 

Anyway... onto my review. 

**Date:** July 20, 2025  
**Coffee:** Manggarai, Flores Anaerobic Natural Kartika  
**Roaster:** Luminous  
**Producer:** Tuang Coffee (managed by Andre Hamboer)

**BREW DETAILS**

* **Method:** Pour Over
* **Roast Level:** Light
* **Grinder:** K-Ultra
* **Grind Size:** 0.8.0
* **Dripper:** D27
* **Water:** TWW 50% dilution
* **Water Temp:** 200°F
* **Ratio:** 1:17
* **Dose:** 10g
* **Total Brew Time:** 1:36

   * **0:00:** 52g
   * **0:30:** 91g (39g)
   * **0:50:** 130g (39g)
   * **1:10:** 170g (40g)

**TASTING NOTES**

The fragrance presents at medium intensity with tropical characteristics, reminiscent of getting a fruity alcoholic drink in Thailand. The aroma intensity is medium to medium-low and fruity, though surprisingly mild for an anaerobic natural process.

Initial flavor impressions center around black tea with subtle fermented notes that come across as somewhat muddy. There are gentle bitter and sour notes present, though they remain quite subtle. The cardamom spice becomes apparent on the aftertaste, adding an interesting dimension.

Sweetness sits at medium-low intensity. The acidity presents as dry with medium intensity, refined and well structured. The mouthfeel has good weight at medium intensity, with a oiliness that creates a rich texture.

As the coffee cools, the acidity spikes up noticeably, while the sour fermented notes become more prominent. The increased acidity helps balance these fermented characteristics, creating better harmony in the cup.

Despite the relatively coarse grind size and fast brew time, the flavor separation could have been better. Overall, this is a good cup without any significant flaws, but it lacks the excitement factor that would make it a standout coffee.

I just wanted to make a post here about some things that I've noticed that are becoming particularly harrowing within our community, and are, I believe, distracting us from advocating for our community properly.

The #1 issue I see as I peruse queer subreddits is all of the in-group fighting that seems to be pervasive in these spaces. It's disturbing that in the wake of trans men describing the patriarchy's impact on their experience, they are being met with so much reactive backlash and pushback from other members of the community. While this particular case is isolated to the transgender community, gay/lesbian/bisexual discourse seems to run rampant as well. Bisexual invalidation and biphobia has become a noticeable pattern on many gay/lesbian subreddits. These are of course not the only examples, I really have seen discourse about pretty much every letter of our alphabet, these two are just recently notable. In addition to these sexuality/gender discourses, I've also noticed a sharp increase in Islamophobia in many queer spaces in the wake of queer resistance to the atrocities occurring in Palestine, and the current situation with Iran. Do we forget that we have community members living and dying in these places? Why do we feel the need to paint everyone with the same brush, especially as a community that historically has been painted with the same brush over and over again by conservative media outlets?

I know that I'm not allowed to provide particular examples of the stereotyping I see going on in our community, and so I won't, but I would like to come here to bear a grim reminder: ***we are all going to be really fucked if we don't get it together quickly here.*** 

I think that many of us as individuals are accustomed to our victimhood, and I think in many ways we have tried to make peace with it by finding community among others with similar struggles, but in doing so, we have intertwined our victimization with our sense of identity and purpose. It seems lately that we can't simply *all* be struggling; there is always someone who has to be struggling *more*, who has to have been hurt *more*. I strongly urge everyone to please look at queer discourse through a critical lens. Do you feel yourself getting agitated? Take a step back. Walk away from your device and process your reaction. Go get a coffee, or go for a walk or talk to a friend, maybe even a friend who you don't always see everything eye-to-eye with. Decide: ""Is this worth my energy? Who benefits from my perspective? Who loses out if I don't say my piece here? Do I have anything to say that has not already been said? Who am I advocating for with my response? How much of my own perspective on this issue is a reactive response to feeling discomfort when faced with an experience that I do not understand?""   
  
Please remember that you are not immune to engaging with discourse in a reactive way, and nor am I. Reactivity is not isolated as a conservative issue. Advocacy is beyond important and I'm ***not*** suggesting that we do not make our voices heard and known, or that we neglect to discuss our personal struggles in online spaces. But please, *please* remember that in the end, the current world that we live in is coming for all of us equally, and if we lose sight of our goal (liberation for us ALL), now more than ever, our oppressors will bury us while we are distracted arguing amongst ourselves. We *must* be united. We cannot lose sight of the plot any longer, I'm sorry. We must become comfortable with discomfort. We must be willing to share spaces with people who we might not agree with on every single thing all of the time (and I hope that I'm clear here when i say that I don't mean on the basis of human rights issues, but rather, religions we may not believe in, gender expressions or experiences we might not understand, etc). We *must* lift one another up, and work to understand each other before it is too late.",2,1753045944.0,lgbt,0,1.0,False
1m508o2,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeHive/comments/1m508o2/which_keurig_model_do_i_have/,Which Keurig model do I have?,"As someone who's been using Keurig machines for years, I understand how confusing it can be to identify which model you own. I recently helped my mom figure out her Keurig model, and I realized many people face the same challenge. Let me break this down for you.

The easiest way to identify your Keurig model is to look at the serial number on the bottom or back of your machine. However, if that's worn off or hard to read, here are some simple ways to figure it out:

K-Classic (K50/K55)
- Has three cup size options (6, 8, 10 oz)
- Basic black design
- Water reservoir on the left side
- Simple button controls

K-Elite
- Five cup sizes (4, 6, 8, 10, 12 oz)
- Has an iced coffee setting
- More premium look with metallic details
- Temperature control feature

K-Mini
- Super slim design
- Single cup reservoir
- Under 5 inches wide
- Makes 6-12 oz cups

If you're thinking about upgrading your current machine, I've found some great deals here: https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers

K-Supreme
- MultiStream technology
- Dual position reservoir
- Modern design with curved edges
- Strong brew option

K-Cafe
- Built-in milk frother
- Makes regular coffee and lattes
- Large 60 oz reservoir
- Three coffee settings

I recently upgraded my old K-Classic to a K-Supreme, and the difference in coffee quality is noticeable. The newer models have better temperature control and more brewing options.

Common features to look for:
- Reservoir size
- Cup size options
- Special features (strong brew, iced coffee)
- Display type (buttons vs touch screen)

If you're still unsure about your model or thinking about getting a new one, check out the current models and deals at https://explorehomedeals.com/Keurig-coffee-makers. They usually have detailed descriptions and comparisons that make it easier to identify or choose a machine.

Remember to descale your Keurig every 3-6 months regardless of the model. This helps maintain coffee quality and extends the life of your machine. Also, most models are compatible with both K-cups and reusable filters, which is great for cutting down on waste and saving money.

Quick tip: Take a photo of your machine's serial number and model information when you first get it. This has saved me multiple times when ordering replacement parts or looking up specific cleaning instructions.

Hope this helps you identify your Keurig model and get the most out of your coffee maker!",1,1753045886.0,HomeHive,0,1.0,False

We had our first child last November and things have just seemed to fall apart. 

My husband always wanted to have kids, but started to flip flop on the idea after we were married. This was mostly after his mom dropped multiple bombshells of things he never knew, compounded by trauma he went through as an older child/young teen. He went to counseling for it after depression really started to take a toll on not only his daily life but also our marriage early on. I supported him where I could through these episodes and ""put out fires"" with family when he'd be going through one at family gatherings. Things began to even out after a few years and he started bringing up having kids again, which he knew I wanted to have 1 or 2 but it wasn't a deal breaker if we didn't. My reply was always the same ""Only if you feel like you're ready. I know you've been trying to get your mental health dealt with and I don't want the pressure of a child put on top of that.""

Fast forward to last year, he came home and said, ""I'm ready, to start a family. I've thought about it alot and I'm ready as long as you are."" I saw a spark back in him that I hadn't seen since the beginning of our marriage and was excited to start this new chapter. He was supportive and excited when we found out we were expecting about 2 months later. Even when at 36w 5d I found out I was going to need to be induced at 37weeks due to pre-eclampsia he was scared and panicked a bit but he was still supportive. 

We spent about 4 days in the hospital, and even with the induction everything went smoothly. But when we went to the recovery room things started to change. I wasn't able to get out of bed for several hours after birth due to having a magnesium drip and any effects from my epidural needing to wear off. I needed help getting my son out of the nursery cradle (forgive me I don't know the proper name for it) and many times couldn't wake up my husband so I'd have to call a nurse to help. Once I could move around things got a bit easier, but I noticed he really still didn't help me too much getting him out or changing diapers. I just thought it was due to him never really being around a baby and unsure of doing something wrong just as I was being a FTM. A couple days after bringing our LO home we found out we were going to have to take him back to the hospital due to needing treatment for jaundice. Even knowing it's a common issue, I was beyond anxious. When we got to the hospital we got him settled, and my husband proposed the idea he'll head home for a couple hours (i.e.feed our dog/let her out, and try to get some food/basics) and return around 8 or 9 with some dinner. I agreed and stayed by our LO's side making sure he ate, and was changed, primarily making sure he didn't pull his little goggles off. I stayed up almost all night keeping track of him even once my husband got back. He shortly after returning fell asleep while I ate. The next morning LO was good to go and we headed home. 

The first 3 months we split alot of the duties where we could, but once he returned to work is where things started to really fall apart. I was doing most of the childcare (which I expected, opting to be stay at home and quit my job) but where he used to be excited to feed his son around dinner turned into my role as well as bedtime routine. He would still play with him but other responsibilities slowly started to shift to me. One night no matter what I did I couldn't get our LO to sleep, and finally after 2 straight hours of attempts he was out. My husband came up to bed and woke him on accident. Needless to say out of exhaustion I snapped at him, in no way on purpose but just completely out of exhaustion. The next day I apologized for snapping but couldn't til later in the day because he avoided me most of the morning and early afternoon running errands or going on a bike ride. Even after apologizing it took him a couple days to kind of go back to norm. 

Our son just turned 8 months old, and we've and 2 times this happened. Another one being today.... our LO is teething and of course is having some trouble sleeping. It's been alittle over a week again of extremely broken sleep and taking care of his daily needs/household chores. Last night was the first night I was able to get him to sleep at his normal time with only a couple minor wake ups. That was until about 1:30 this morning, I was beyond exhausted... and he wanted a feed. I don't remember too much of the feed except the act of feeding him,and trying to soothe him. I do remember getting frustrated and trying to get my husband's attention to help me (who was sleeping on the couch where i normally feed LO). He did wake up and turned to TV off but then just nodded right back off again. I gave up and went to put our still awake and slightly less unhappy LO in his crib. After another 20 minutes our son settled and went back to sleep, and I collapsed into bed. 

When my LO woke up this morning I saw my husband had already left to run to the store to get some essentials. I was in the kitchen getting myself some coffee when he came home. Our dog was in his way with an arm full, so I called her back to me to get out of the way. He said not a word to me, tossed the rest in the house, unloaded some, said a half hearted hi to our LO, and laid down on the couch and went to sleep. He still has not said a word to me as of this evening or anything more to his son and has moved to the bed with a blanket pulled over his head. I don't remember saying anything out of frustration or snapping but if I did I honestly don't remember. If I did I would apologize... but I also don't know if it's just something else aggravating him because he will not talk at all. 

I know this is a long post but any advice in this situation would be appreciated....I know arguments happen, tempers can flair but to have a complete communication breakdown doesn't help either. Thank you, even if it's just me getting these thoughts out of my head... ",1,1753045180.0,family,2,1.0,False

In a relationship for 8 years. For the last 4 years (especially after our daughter has born) things are going south. And I need help - or at least some support.

The last 4 years was pretty hectic for both of us. To be frank she has been through a lot. Relocation to another country, loss of her father, fighting with her family in that meantime, seeing how they reacted to her father’s terminal disease, giving birth to my daughter. All was really difficult and I appreciate her strength.

I also stood by her and never left her alone in every way. Emotionally, financially, physically. She really had a lot of tough times with her family, one of her sisters even threatened me. Her father was cancer and other than one of her sisters and my wife, their behaviour to their dad was like sh*t. And that sister also dismissed us from her home so that is also not that good. In that time me and my parents were the ones supported her as it should be. They saw her as their daughter and prioritised her even more than me. In that time, even she was saying very bad things about her family, I never said any bad words or something even her family made our lives extremely difficult. Even she accused me of not standing by her by not doing that. This was what I have been taught to not to dive into their family business.

Now she is rebuilding that relationship. She is good with her mother and I guess not yet but soon she will also be ok with her sisters. I am genuinely happy for that, since holding grudge does not being any good. I also like to see a good loving family around her. But that also hurts me because after all the things they have done, she still offer them warmth and patience but treats me like piece of burden. I am feeling like that I was the safe house during the storm, and the storm is over and she starts to act weird.

Our current relationship was slowly degrading, first the sexual part disappeared after my daughter was born, then the intimacy is slowly vanishing. I mean, she thinks about me like daily things and she cares about those, like cooking or bringing coffee but the other intimacy (sexual and non-sexual) is vanishing. 

I have been through a lot in that meantime, she was not working when we relocate and I worked in two jobs, helped her in all the difficulties and showed almost endless patience and support when it comes to home chores and taking care of our daughter. She is a person that gets tired and then angry easily so mostly what I was doing is working, playing with my daughter after work and my wife was having a nap or something and then putting our daughter to sleep and I was working again. To get the house economy done. For the last year I also taken over and she was only going to the language courses she needs to go, and picking our daughter from school. My daughter goes to school from 9 to 4 so the time between she either was going to course or doing home chores or free time. So she had time to finish greys anatomy, to give you an opinion. I also stood by her, accompanied and nurtured (or at least I tried) her because I wanted her to be happy. But that had some consequences.

After all the problems we had and the storm in our lives, I also come to a point that I am also exhausted. Like a burnout, I slowly start to lose all the interest in the human interaction and other hobbies. Actually that started after I married. She sometimes got angry that I am spending too much time on those activities. But now she says I lost all my social skills.. how ironic, right? Nowadays after also losing her touch and interest in that, I was worried about the relationship, my future and also my expectations and what I deserve after all the effort I made for her and for the family. So for the last few weeks I was asking about some intimacy, not even sexual but some closeness.

She was complaining about those but recently even a small hug or kiss even becomes an issue, like she has no desire to touch or something like that. I also tried to talk and actually I sometimes feel really bad like some anxiety attack last 2 weeks since she looks cheerful and open for other friends or her family but not for me. She really brings her full self to those events. But for me, when I try to talk she always finds something that is worse that I feel. 

We had a discussion today about the anxiety attack I had last night and I tried to explain her in a smooth way “ I feel like I am going to lose you “ and she bursted out like “ I have been through a lot, Our daughter wakes up and smashes her head on me every days 6 in the morning. I lost my father, gave birth without no post partum. Maybe I am in depression but all you care about is yourself and you are not even saying what I have done. All you want is hug or etc. ı say I am ok, why are you asking that much?” BTW I am not asking that much. 3 times or shy for the last 3 weeks. I feel like I am the emotional trash bin and she is just stomping on my soul or just taking the love or relationship leftovers on the plate. She can cheer up with her friends but when it comes to me, my feelings, always diverting or dodging.

She also criticises me in micro level. Those are not bursts but a slow degradation. Then I slowly withdraw because that drains the energy from me. Or I sometimes being really tired from work and I need some time to decompress in my brain to come to a state that I can talk daily things but she complains about that I am bring too cold or I don’t talk. Mostly I am top tired or too criticised to have no energy left to talk.

If I try to explain how and why I feel, she gets defensive. Suddenly I’m becoming the problem again. And when we argue she brings my family to table. Or tells me to shut up and shuts down.

Financially, as I said it’s been not so easy. I picked up two jobs to fix the economy. The anxiety attacks started in that times when our economy is not that good. I’ve worked full days, sometimes cooked, handled bedtime of my daughter. I did that out of love and to keep my family happy. The economy is fixed, and that is the time I told her I had those attacks and she said “you have been through a hard time, you did not gave a hint”. Well, I did but you told me I am greedy.

She once went on a solo trip to visit her mother during that time. I stayed with my daughter, worked two jobs, and took care of our child. I didn’t say anything. I wanted her to rest and be happy. But later I heard her tell her friends, “I worked so hard in the language course, I deserved that break.” Well, good for you my love. But you still say you are not ok when it comes to discuss my feelings.

Sometimes I feel like I’ve been reduced to a child in her eyes. Not a partner. I still have hope but it feels like waiting for the flying cars that might never come.

I don’t think she’s cheating or any other person involved. But I can’t say that I am not afraid, just there are really no signs of that.

What I need was a proper, normal relationship. I love my family, I want this to work. But now I really don’t know what to do. I am in wrecked state mentally. I need support.

I’ve been diagnosed depression, anxiety (GAD), panic disorder and agoraphobia. I was on antidepressants for 4 years, been off them 11 ish months. This is a long one so sorry in advance for the rant, I just need genuine advice/support on what I can do. In the last year my mental health has gotten increasingly worse. I barely leave my house or my bed, I don’t look after myself and I avoid speaking to people. My circle has gotten smaller and even some days I just won’t speak to anyone including the people I live with. I’m really struggling to find reason or will, it would be much easier to just disappear sometimes. I’m constantly stuck in my overactive mind and don’t get a minutes peace from my inner monologue. I don’t enjoy things I used to love and every single thing in my life comes with the overwhelming fear of dread. I know I have to get back working at some point, I just never wanted my life to be like this. I really just can’t find the motivation. I feel as if I’m in fight or flight mode 24/7. I’ve limited the amount of things I could do until it’s left me at this stage which is nothing. I have events to go to in the next few months that I booked last year, before everything got massively worse and I can’t find it in me to want to go. I feel like what’s the point, I’m not going to enjoy it. I usually cancel plans, even stuff I used to enjoy that could be as simple as going for a coffee, I just don’t feel safe. It makes me feel worse, especially when I cancel plans last minute because of how I feel. I know my brain is lying to me, it’s as if I’m so self aware that I argue back and forth with my own mind and it drives me insane. I’ve been trying to look for the good in things but I’m struggling. Is it even possible to become one of those people that can admire everything about the world we live in, when I’ve been so pessimistic my whole life? I’m not even sure where to start or what I should do anymore. I’m disappointing myself and everyone around me. I need some success stories or advice from anyone who thinks they can help me. I don’t want to live like this anymore, I physically can’t, I just want to be better. TIA :)",2,1753045086.0,DecidingToBeBetter,1,1.0,False

Unfortunate. It truly was.
To look back on a man exiting his prime—his fears exposed, his vulnerability etched into everything he left behind. Infected by dread, uncertainty, and the looming shadow of death. Just 25. So much more to live for, cut tragically short.
He spoke about how “they wanna bury me,” how he was “fallin’ to pieces,” convinced he was “guilty.” So certain that his only escape was death.
Paranoia had taken root. He foresaw his own end, almost praying for it. Why? Because he felt trapped. By the world, yes—but even more by his own mind. Half the world against him, the other half silent.
He deserved more. He was an intellect, a voice for truth, mislabeled as just a “thug.” What’s often overlooked is how different he truly was—how much he did to fight for tolerance, justice, and equality. Like milk to coffee, he illuminated the bitter truths in society. And yet, his legacy is smeared, fractured by lies and misunderstandings.
When will we accept that no one is perfect? That truth should not be buried beneath reputation? Let Tupac Shakur’s legacy breathe—as the layered, flawed, and fearless force it was.
A brave man. A man I admire, without hesitation. He wasn’t perfect—of course not. But neither are we, the ones who sit in judgment.
I sit here now, listening to his music, tracing the shift in his voice from 1991 to 1996—the tragic year he was taken. To witness a mind spiral, a soul loses its trust in everyone, even itself… It's painful beyond words.
Five minutes with Tupac Shakur. That’s all I’d ask for. Just five—to thank him for the truth he carried, and the fire he never let die.

7/8 evening -- my throat was suddenly sore. I don't get sore throats (I don't get sick in general). I took home  Antigen test. It came back negative.

7/9 morning -- my throat was no longer sore but I just didn't feel ""right"". I took another home test. It came back Positive. Went into isolation in an outdoor office, seperate from my family. My wife sets my meals out on the porch and I then come get them, placing my dirty dishes back on porch after wiping them down thoroughly with wet wipe (I know, COVID is not a bacteria, but the wet wipes serve as a handy method for wiping things down in general). My wife makes me my morning coffee and sets it out on the porch. I set the empty mug back on the porch. I have my own separate bathroom.

7/9 - 7/12 -- Total exhaustion and a bad cold. I could be moderately active (walk around outside) for perhaps 30 minutes and I'd have to go lie down for a couple hours. Little appetite. Stuffed up nose. Very painful lower back (I have lower back issues). 

7/13 -- Feeling pretty good (but looking back on it, it was simply relative).

7/14 -- Really feeling like I was over it. Slightly stuffy nose which I attributed to my normal allergies. Energy was pretty much back.

7/15 -- Feeling well. Spoke with advice nurse and was advised that the rule to follow was simply ""If you feel no symptoms after 10 days from first positive test, good to go. Ignore any further positive tests"". That sounded great, yet also a bit fishy. The part about ignoring the results of home antigen tests seemed suspect.

7/16 -- Still feeling well. Spoke to another advice nurse to get a 2nd opinion on the bit about ""ignore test results"". I got the same advice. I asked the advice nurse to please check with superiors on the bit about ignoring home antigen tests, thinking maybe they meant the PCR tests. Same advice. Ignore the results of the home antigen tests. So I'm gearing up to ditch the mask and go party on 7/19 (ten days since first positive test) regardless of what any home antigen test indicated.

7/17 -- Woke up with the feeling in the back of my nasal/throat area like what I had on 7/9. Dang! It felt like my COVID was making a comeback. Still testing positive. Reality is that, I suspect, my symptoms never actually did go away. I simply felt so much better that is ""seemed"" like my symptoms were gone.

7/20 -- Here I am now, 12 days later. I've not tested again because I still have this nagging feeling of not being 100%. Kinda stuffy still. If I concentrate I think I can still sense something going on in the back of my throat. I'm quite certain if I test again it will be positive. I plan to test tomorrow, if I feel better.

Sooooo....my COVID journey has been twelve days (12) and counting. Probably the worst aspect of it is the isolation. Not being able to enter my house. Staying away from my wife and daughter and friends. Boredom and a feeling of uselessness as I watch my wife working away. The symptoms are like a bad cold at their worst. My back hurts, but I suspect that is more from poor posture as I lounge around all day every day.",5,1753044688.0,COVID19positive,0,1.0,False

Abipon is a nation located on the southern cone of South America and is a sub polar maritime based country. Visited by the French and settled by the English, the country has a history involving many nations however a relatively peaceful one. The region in regards to Apibon has its first settlement built at Sedan by the French Antarctic Expedition, in 1714. Following the end of the Napoleonic wars the area was claimed for the United Kingdom and the land was consumed by the Crown in 1844. The eastern portion has a mild oceanic climate and was settled rapidly. It is known for cash crops like mung bean in the north, whereas pastures in the south were ideal for sheep rearing and became the Shepreman agriregion in the south centred around Warkworth. The western coast is also mild, and follows a north south gradient transitioning from Köppen climates Cfb temperate to a Cfa Mediterranean. Its cool coastal waters were ideal for fishing and the industry developed rapidly. Later on after independence rare minerals would be discovered and mining would contribute alot to the economy. National parks became established round the country, and fitness is high among people and issues involving health are low. People report having a high quality of life, amongst the highest in the world. Cost of living is low compared to other high-income countries. Apibon produces enough food to sustain 90% of its population. Agriculture is focused on Mung bean, olive oil, rape linseed wine and sheep and goats. Areas between farm allotments in the east are free access to the public which boosts public health and encourages environmental awareness and regeneration. People like to ride horses rather than use cars in some places. There is a large formal public enrichment economy consisting of visits to tourism, national parks, visits to vineyards and horse riding. Sport is relatively insignificant in Abipon compared to other nations asides from Abipon rules football and cricket. Due to the discovery of rare Earth minerals in the country, after1970 there was an economic rise which exponentially increased the standard of living , and the Government awards its citizens with an extensive social welfare system and social safety net, as well as the usual Police, Ambulance and Fire services Coast Guard and Lost Persons Rescue. Getting lost is easy in Abipon because every place sounds the same. People like to enjoy a caffeinated beverage called Ilex which is prepared in the same manner as coffee or tea. People came from the British Isles originally, many English speaking Welsh following its independence, however there has been a change in migration in modern times. Now most people arrive from Africa and the Indian subcontinent, as well as Indonesia contributing to a larger variety of cultures being present. The region of Jasrong is named after a Minangkabau Auxiliary Sani Jasrong who was a monumental figure in the late Napoleonic wars, and saved Britain from capitulation. The first flag is the British Overseas Dominion flag used from 1888 until 1944, the Second flag is the Abipons’ Sun flag used after Independence. ",2,1753044589.0,imaginarymapscj,0,1.0,False

I was tired, so very tired. I wasn’t ready for this. I just wasn’t in the mood for more of the academy’s antics. Yet here I was, facing down the third miniboss of the night.

What followed was an intense staredown that I just wasn’t up for, especially at this hour. I realized however that it was very much a one-sided affair as my opaque, and frankly intimidating lenses, were carrying most of the weight in this impromptu standoff. I could see that the elf in question looked as tired as I was. Indeed despite her well kept attire, and the sternness that she conveyed in her voice, she exuded as much of an air of exhaustion as she did a domineering stance

Yet the fires of authority she carried had all but been doused by my height advantage. With a good two feet head start in the height department, the whole scene would’ve been rather one sided, if it wasn’t for the hulking mass of muscle that was the gargoyle standing behind her.

So after a good ten seconds of looking her up and down, I nodded. “Thanks.” I managed out, restraining myself from gesticulating too much so as to keep my intimidation factor in the game. “I appreciate you bringing it all the way up here. Must have been quite a journey hauling a cart like that up a maze of staircases am I right?” I attempted to defuse the situation with the age-old, tried and true method outlined several times in the SIOP manual: small talk.

The elf however, wasn’t having any of it as she remained completely silent, refusing to even acknowledge my question. Even the gargoyle refused to answer as he simply stared blankly into the room, his steely gaze was ever so slightly *off*, which when combined with his unflinching stature was more than enough to raise a few red flags.

I decided to expedite the conversation, now realizing that there was no point in prolonging this unnecessary standoff. “So… I’m assuming all my stuff arrived in one piece?”

*This* line of questioning was enough to prompt an answer. Although it was one that was far from what I had expected. “I am afraid it would be disingenuous of me to answer that question, Emma of Earthrealm.” The elf spoke cryptically, with a tired air of authority now imbued with an unwarranted addition of dismissiveness and superiority. Something that I was quickly discovering to be a trend amongst the elves and their various subspecies. With the exception of the blue-robed Vanavan, every elf I’ve met thus far seemed to always find themselves slipping into this very specific brand of cavalier arrogance.

Again, I just wasn’t in the mood to be playing games, not with an elf of all people. “Disingenuous, how?” I snapped back, making sure that my terseness came through loud and clear through my vocoders.

“I wouldn’t know if all of your luggage arrived successfully, Emma of Earthrealm. It is the responsibility of your own people to ensure that is the case. However, given the primitive nature of your transrealm portal methodologies, there is a high likelihood a few of your belongings may be missing somewhere in the ether between our realm and your own. It is to be expected of course, no realm does it well on their first try.” The arrogance began to ooze from this female elf, an arrogance that bordered on outright disrespect as it was clear what she was hinting at, or at least alluding to. Sure, on the surface it was just an off handed rude jab at our portal tech, but on the other hand, it was so clearly coded in such a way that it was referring to our *first* portal. The same one that led to the untimely death of the first human candidate.

This disrespect made my blood simmer, but I held it together all the same. It was fortunate that I’d released some of my rage on Ilunor just moments prior, because otherwise this elf would’ve found herself blown through the thick stone and brick mortar behind her. “This is why it would be disingenuous of me to speak on behalf of your realm’s own shortcomings. I simply wish to be as candid and earnest as I can in any discussions with our *esteemed* first-year peers.” The elf continued, which only prompted me to shrug dismissively in response.

“You know, you’d make for a great customer service agent for Trans-United Spacelines. I’m just waiting on when you’re going to push the extra baggage and handling insurance that inevitably comes after this spiel.” I jabbed back, causing the elf to raise a single brow in confusion as I sighed. “Fine, alright, let’s just get this over with.” I moved forward towards the bell cart, only to be stopped by the gargoyle who held a single arm between me and my supply crates.

“It would be rude of me to not have my *assistant* carry your luggage for you.” The elf interjected, a small smile curling up at the sides of her tired face.

*So this was* ***also*** *a power play thing*. I thought to myself. *Alright, let’s fucking go.*

I continued moving forward, ignoring the elf’s insistence as I pushed the gargoyle’s arm out of the way without much effort. It was only when I had wrapped both arms around one of the large crates did the gargoyle move back in, using one of his oversized hands to wrap around my wrist without warning.

“I *insist*.” The elf spoke again in that indignant tone of voice.

**Warning: Maximum pain threshold on \[RIGHT HAND\] exceeded, auto-disconnect of haptic feedback engaged.**

*You’re actually willing to* ***hurt*** *your students to satisfy your power fantasies? Fucking really?*

It was with this sudden transgression that I turned to face the elf with my helmet’s expressionless gaze. I made sure my point was known as I allowed the gargoyle to continue pinching down on my wrist. As the seconds ticked on, I refused to acknowledge the pain or even the discomfort that would have been felt if it wasn’t for my suit. This clearly began to bother the elf. Her once gleeful eyes of satisfaction evolved into concern, then into revulsion and abject confusion as I remained there, completely ignoring any and all afflictions that would’ve at this point caused any other student to be writhing and rolling around in pain.

“Are we done here?” I snapped back, ripping my hand from the gargoyle’s grip without any effort.

This demonstrated one of two things.

One: that I not only ignored the pain, but that I had the strength to make this musclebound bodyguard’s efforts at physically restraining me completely moot.

Two: that I wasn’t about to bend the knee or submit to whatever games this fucked up elf was playing at.

With a single flourish I lifted the cargo container up and into my arms; what amounted to a few metric *tons* of equipment that the elf *knew* was impossible for most creatures to handle. It was probably the only reason she brought the gargoyle here after all.

I made it a point to keep the crate held between my arms without even once flinching, holding completely still for an egregiously long time, all the while staring down at her as I cocked my head slightly. “I ask again, *ma’am*, are we *done* here?” I reiterated, causing the elf to do something she probably wasn’t used to.

“Lortal, leave the rest of the Earthrealmer’s belongings here and take the cart back-.”

""Wait where is my stuff? Is it coming later?"" Max interjected moving out from behind me into the elf's view.

This seemed to reinvigorate the apprentice reforming her smile. ""Unfortunatly the one box you had has not been delivered to us, it is a shame how your nations couldn't even deliver a *single box,*"" 

Max's demenor had quickly changed hearing that, leaving a silence for a good minute, before feigning politeness through gritted teeth. ""Oh well it is such a shame my stuff couldn't get here. It was a good thing I have my essentials in here."" lifting up the oversized jet black suitcase he walked through the portal with before putting it back down. ""Have a good day.""

With that she had the gargoyle place all of my crates on the stone tiled floor in front of the dorm, and left with a flourish you would expect from a mage.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 200% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

The pair vanished without a trace, probably using the same teleportation spell Mal’tory used in the Grand Hall.

I sighed in defeat underneath my helmet, with my small victory being lost along with Max's crate before I turned around to face my peers who had been watching the whole scene unfold with bated breath this entire time.

Their expressions were mixed. Thalmin slowly clapped for me with a look of worry for Max. Thacea on the other hand seemed much more concerned. Finally, Ilunor looked on with a sly grim until he looked at me changing into a terrified look. Perhaps seeing the container held so casually in my arms was even more proof of my perceived strength. Or perhaps it made his whole *theory* of me being nothing but a *golem* even more credible in his eyes.

Regardless of what it was, the whole room slowly resumed where we left off before the interruption, with everyone shuffling their possessions into their bedrooms. With both of my arms preoccupied by the oversized crate, and Max insisting on helping to carry some of the crates speeding up the process before leaving to his room slamming the door so hard I swear I felt it through the suit. I was just about ready to make use of the suit’s retractable mechanical arm, if it wasn’t for Thacea’s swift assistance in holding the door to our bedroom open. I nodded and thanked her, moving in and dreading the unpacking that awaited me.

I should’ve known however that worrying about *space management* in a place like this was like worrying about flight path restrictions in unincorporated space.

The single door didn’t give way to a bedroom, but instead another corridor. A corridor that while shorter than the one leading to the living room, gave way to a space I didn’t *dare* call a *bedroom*.

Down the 10 or so feet of corridor was an oversized luxury *loft* ***within*** what was already an oversized penthouse.

To say that the room was grand was yet again another understatement. Whilst the Academy certainly wasn’t the idealized magical school I’d made it out to be, this room *definitely* resonated *more* with that fantasy. It almost made me think that perhaps the Academy of old was in some way better than the one I was stuck with.

Because the room that I had just entered was literally the size of the entire living room, *and then some*. It was an apartment within an apartment. With that small corridor opening up to an expansive space that more resembled the open-plan lofts I’d seen featured in the popular home and life magazines my mom had been obsessed with. To give a more period-accurate example, I’d say that it resembled those weird open-plan two-story libraries that always found their way into fantasy epics and films, complete with the wrap-around second floor balcony that overlooked the first floor.

The *first floor* in this case was most certainly designated for everything else *aside* from sleep. With a space hosting several desks fitted with inkwells and quills, along with couches and a small coffee table, it seemed to comfortably serve as a combined living and study area. The space was certainly more than large enough to fit the furniture that already existed within it, which made it *perfect* for my space-sensitive needs. In fact, this was probably beyond the best case scenario for the square footage I needed to set up my tent and its various supporting systems.

The *second floor* was dominated by a space recessed into the wall that had two queen-sized beds positioned side by side, complete with bed posts and a canopy with curtains to boot. Flanking the two beds on either side of the walls were what I assumed to be doors leading further to a wardrobe or a full blown walk-in-closet. It was probably the latter, but I was too preoccupied with moving my cargo inside to really bother checking.

Within the span of a few minutes, I’d successfully transported each container into a relatively empty corner of the room. Each container was slightly different in size and shape, and in a way reminded me of the ancient game of Tetris as I stacked one on top of the other. It honestly felt quite therapeutic. After all that I’d experienced, I felt at least a *small* semblance of control returning to me as I organized everything into a neat, stackable pile.

I was just about to begin scanning and checking off each container from the manifest list I’d been given during my mission briefing, before my attention was immediately taken by a more pressing issue.

My side-view cameras detected a concerning scene, as I saw the princess struggling with some of the larger pieces of luggage she had. The poor avian was tugging, pulling, and practically throwing her back out with each and every step. This made me spring into action without hesitation as I leaped over, grabbing the oversized piece of luggage that would’ve honestly been quite at home in the vintage collection of one of those designer bag brands back on Earth.

“Here, let me, princess.” I spoke insistently, with both of my hands reaching for either end of her luggage. With a bit of reluctance she finally agreed, giving me that courtly headnod that only a royal could give.

“Thank you, Emma.” She replied, which prompted me to give my own, less graceful nod.

“Hey, you’re the princess and I’m the knight, remember?” I teased, harkening back to our first interaction a few hours back. “You did me a solid, saving me twice already. It's only fair that it’s time for your knight to do some of the saving.” I snickered, as I felt more and more of myself finally winding down with Ilunor promptly out of the question, and with the world condensing ever further into the privacy of these four walls.

This was something I was more than grateful for after a rapid-fire gauntlet of existential panic after existential panic.

I continued moving back and forth between the living room and my new bedroom, picking up the rest of Thacea’s luggage with ease. With a single piece of luggage under each arm, and a suitcase in either hand, I turned to face the avian without much fanfare to ask. “So, where do you want them, princess?”

“The suitcases can be placed next to the dressing room, the luggage containing the royal seal should be placed at the foot of my bed, of which I will take the left, and the other piece of luggage can be placed near the lounge chair-” Thacea stopped in her tracks as her avian eyes blinked rapidly. It was clear something was developing rapidly through her head, as she visibly winced in front of me and placed a single feathered arm against her chest, and another by her side, bowing ever so slightly. “My sincerest apologies Emma, I answered in a manner that was incredibly unbecoming and disrespectful of your rank and station. Please forgive me.” Before I could answer however, the princess stood back up with that immaculate posture of hers, and continued. “I… am not used to these kinds of questions and offers being asked by someone of equal or comparable rank, birthright, or station, not especially one of my peers. This is a question that is generally reserved for those that serve, and royal etiquette and manners overtook me, as I responded far too eagerly. Again, I do apologize, Emma. It has been quite an eventful night and it is clear that the stresses are starting to take their toll on my social etiquette. It is unbecoming of me, and disrespectful of you, and it should not have even happened and so-”

“Hey, you cut that out alright?” I interjected, still holding onto the avian’s luggage without breaking a sweat.

“E-excuse me?”

“Yeah, you heard me right, you cut that out right now, princess.” I reiterated, with a tone that was caught between caring, concerned, and empathetic, with a hint of exasperation.

“I don’t follow-”

“I get it, apologies accepted. You and I aren’t from the same cultural background, and it shows.” I started. However, whereas this would’ve led into a verbal assault if it were Ilunor, the conversation instead veered into a far more constructive and wholesome territory when it came to the princess. “You’re trying, and that’s what counts. Listen, I offered to help alright? So you can boss me around all you like. I appreciate that you backtracked on the whole talking-down-to-me aspect of things, and I appreciate that you see me as an equal, but…” *Fuck this is way more complicated than I thought*. “... but I’d appreciate it if you'd extend that same olive branch to those that you might not normally perceive *as* your equals.” I spoke with a genuine sense of optimism before I finished off my whole speech by moving up to pat the avian on the shoulder. “And honestly, don’t sweat it. We’ve both been through the wringer tonight, and you especially had to go through that public dressing down which for the record *wasn’t* okay. I want you to know that, at least within the walls of this room, there will be none of that crap. Here, we’re *true* equals. No taint stuff, no public stigma for those baseless accusations, no nothing.” I gripped the avian’s shoulder just a little bit harder, every word uttered through my vocoders emanating a real warmth to it that lacked any social filters as I gave the princess my most complete and sincerest thoughts.

The princess didn’t seem to respond at all as she stood there, utterly dumbfounded and shocked. Her eyes widened and her pupils dilated the same way an owl would in the middle of the night, where they would look like they were completely flabbergasted or indignant about something. I released my hand, and took a few steps back before finally the princess snapped out of her haze, and smiled. This time, it was genuine. There was something about it that just wasn’t like the polite, or courteous, or formal smiles that she’d put on before. There was something *raw* about this one, and I could tell by the look in her eyes that practically glistened with something resembling a look of epiphany. “Thank you, Emma. Thank you.” Was all she said. Yet despite those few words, I could *hear* a difference in her tone and cadence. It was slight, but it was there.

With a nod and an imperceptible smile, I began placing the bags as the princess had requested of me, and eventually turned my sights on my own belongings.

I made sure to scan each individual container, starting off with the most vital out of all of them, what was affectionately referred to as the *tent*. Whilst it bore this rather unassuming, and almost comically simple name, the contents within were anything *but* simple. Within this cuboid container the size of an oversized lounge chair was the key to my long term survival here in the Nexus. Whilst the suit was *technically* capable of being used long term if need be, with it being *theoretically* rated for a full year of complete and continuous use… the prospects of that were more than troubling to say the very least. Even during the theory section of SERE training I almost always lost the battle with the contents of my stomach anytime the discussion for what was known as *suit exclusive survival* came up.

The *tent* was the solution to that, a little piece of home forcefully carved out of the fabric of the Nexus’ reality. A pocket of safety that defied an otherwise death-filled reality that everyone else here inhabited without a second thought. The entire contents of the container held the bare minimum of what was necessary to facilitate this goal. Namely: the tent itself, the power supply system, and the mana filtration system that would be vital in establishing that pocket of mana-free environment I needed. It honestly surprised me that everything would even *fit* in a container of this size, what with the generator *and* filtration system being crammed in there. It wasn’t a surprise then that the fabric of the tent would be so fragile, given how thin and space-efficient it needed to be to be able to even *fit* in there.

With the most vital container squared away and ticked off my list, I moved on to the rest of the 9 containers on the list in order of their significance to survival and mission integrity. The next container held the highly experimental, yet just as vital Mana-Radiation Extraction and Desaturation Device, or the MREDD for short. Whilst shelter was already dealt with in the form of the tent and my suit, food and water still needed to be accounted for. The MREDD was the solution to the latter two issues. The device would be theoretically capable of removing every last scrap of mana-radiation from any matter placed within its extraction chamber. With its rate of extraction directly proportional to the density and permeability of whatever matter is placed within it. The scientists back at home gave me a whole manual on what foodstuffs were more conducive to the extraction process. Wet, airy foods such as whipped cream, souffles, scrambled eggs, and bread were preferable for instance. Whereas harder, denser foods such as pemmican, hardtack, and nuts were contraindicated as they would take not just more time but much more effort and energy to fully drain and purify.

The container for this device was just about as large as the tent’s. This was because the filtration unit itself was just about as large, if not larger. The justification for this was simple enough: in order to purify matter and not just air, there needed to be a higher rate of active extraction and energy expended. A continuous and intensive filtration process was needed, which was why the actual extraction chamber was just about the size of a large microwave, and the generator and extraction plus filtration unit was just about half a size larger than the tent’s. What’s more, when not in use, the generator for the MREDD would aid in the large suite of devices I had on hand to repair and maintain my suit, as well as to charge its auxiliary batteries.

Indeed, the entire manifest that had been prepared for me consisted primarily of redundancies on top of redundancies, as the third and fourth container would prove. The third was yet another generator, again, the same size as the tent’s at about 5 by 5 feet. This would prove vital in case any one of the generators was faulty or having issues which directly hampered its power generation.

The fourth container was far longer and more rectangular in nature, just about as long as a dining table. Within it was a furniture assembler’s nightmare, but it essentially held the framework for a workshop and workstation that was just small enough to fit in my tent. It was designed to hold up my armor, and allow me to easily perform a decent amount of repairs on any part of my suit. Whilst not a mechanic myself, both my manual and my on board EVI would be capable of making up for the gaps in my skill and knowledge.

Practically entering a zen-like state of therapeutic relaxation from the checking and cross checking of items on my manifest, a sudden realization would soon hit me that shattered what should have been a relaxing end to an otherwise chaotic evening.

The fifth item on my manifest, the container which held the experimental trans-dimensional communication device that I would use to communicate back to Earth with, was missing like with Max.

And that immediately put me on the clock to retrieve it, or else it and the cargo inside it blew up in my face… or more accurately, *someone else’s*.

I wanted to stay as Professor and teach, so I did, come to find out I was adjunct because my university doesn’t want to hire full time. I accepted it because I thought I’d at least make more than as a grad assistant. But in the Fall of 2024, I saw my first paycheck for 3 classes, less than as a graduate assistant. The next semester, Spring 2025 I was assigned two classes (at my university adjuncts can’t teach more than five classes a year). One got removed due to low enrollment so I only did one. Well I agreed to stay another year but asked if there’s full time, they said not right now. I saw that I was assigned only one class and only two students signed up. To no one’s surprise the class got removed due to this, but they’re offering me another class, they say it’s 80% full and not likely to get canceled. That said, it can also get reassigned to a full time professor, it said there are no guarantees. It’s also a red flag that last year I got 3 classes but this year only one, because enrollment and acceptance rates are down. So I’m debating if I need to accept this or just withdraw and find another career path. I also work at a coffee stand, and I’m not kidding, I make more there, in two weeks at the coffee stand I make double what I make in a month at the university. I’m also paying for my car insurance and note, the insurance is almost all my monthly paycheck. I love teaching but I can’t live off this, and the fact that I make more making people coffees, teas, energies, etc. really says a lot. So what should I do?

TL, DR; -My adjunct position is very shaky. -Two classes have been canceled due to low enrollment. -I make more at a coffee stand (no not Starbucks). -The pay is terrible. -I got car expenses. -Even with a potential new class, there’s no guarantee.",8,1753044335.0,Adjuncts,3,1.0,False

1m4zla5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4zla5,1985  —> 2025 Before & After,"Finally finished the last touches on our kitchen remodel and I am so thrilled with how it turned out. Bought the house earlier this year and the kitchen was in perfect on fine physical shape, just dated. Originally planned to keep it and wait but needed to re-do the floors throughout which led to a domino effect. 

Had my contractor gut it, and had the whole kitchen designed with Ikea. I was skeptical but so glad we went this way. It was the only way we could afford to do what we did and the kitchen is very high quality. I am very impressed in the end. Very solid and the hardware is top notch. Was great getting to have someone come out and measure everything to be able for to build a digital kitchen that we could design around. Loved getting to customize every inch of this kitchen - a few of my favorite things: built in dishwasher, primarily drawers throughout, and our hideaway coffee nook in the pantry (previously no pantry in the kitchen). All cabinets and appliances are ikea, quartz from a local place, lights from Menards.

1m4zk0f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4zk0f,"Retro color scheme with gray carpet, suggestions and advice?","This fall we will be repainting the living room, replacing the curtains and recovering or possibly replacing the couch and recliner (most likely recovering).  Currently the walls are white with gray trim, and the furniture and curtains are blue.  I am leaning toward a retro scheme, circa  late 70s / early 80s, (after the wildest 70s color combos, but before the 80s pastels) Basically grandma's house that hasn't been redecorated in 40 years, but without the florals and wood paneling, lol.

We want to keep our tables and other wood pieces, they are all  dark wood like the coffee table, and a vintage yellow and black tiger figurine that was  my grandmother's, it's the centerpiece of the room as far as I'm concerned. Yellow goes really well with the dark wood, adding a nice pop (have a few spreads on tables, for that retro look), but I can't figure out colors for sofa, curtains  and walls that tie it all together.  I've considered yellow curtains, but that still leaves the walls and sofa to figure out (the curtain color is just a thought, totally can be changed).

Unfortunately the carpet is not negotiable, (second photo is the accurate floor of the carpet,, for some reason it comes out darker when I try to photo the entire room) that's what's really throwing me off.  It has to stay at least a few more years, until I can justify replacing it, and that's what's throwing me off. Beige or brown or just about anything else I could work with no problem, but how to tie together yellow, dark wood, and gray, while maintaining a retro vibe has me stumped.",1,1753044196.0,interiordecorating,0,0.67,False

Can anyone recommend a good standalone tea?","I've always liked the idea of a good tea. Something warm, rich, flavorful, but in practice, I haven’t found one that doesn't just taste like slightly flavored hot water.

Lately I’ve been trying Barry’s Gold and Twinings Irish Breakfast. I know the Irish will probably have opinions about me liking Twinings better, but so far, I do. I brew it in a warmed mug with about 8oz of rolling-boiled water and 2 bags, steeped 7 minutes, stir at the start, squeeze the bags at the end. I add 1 tbsp of whole milk. It’s okay-ish, but still nothing to write home about.

Barry’s seems stronger, I can get about the same depth with one bag, but the flavor (such as it is) still mostly shows up in the aftertaste. On the surface level, it’s hot water with a hint of malt or tannin, but barely.  

I recently tried distilled water instead of our local hard tap water (which I read can dull tea), and that did make a slight improvement. But still... it’s underwhelming. I do see why people pair it with cake or biscuits, like a palate cleanser, but if that’s all it’s doing, I’ll probably just stick to black coffee, which has punch and body even on its own.

That said, I’ve had an oolong from an Asian market before (wish I remembered which brand), and that actually had a strong, delicate surface flavor that I really liked. Barry’s and Twinings remind me of that oolong, but watered down. I also like spiced Indian chais, but they tend to upset my stomach.

So, with all that said, where do I go from here?
I'm looking for something with flavor up front, not just an aftertaste, and ideally something I don’t need 3-4 bags of to get there (which is going to be my next experiments with what I currently have). ",2,1753044127.0,tea,14,0.75,False

1m4zg37,https://www.reddit.com/r/adjunctprofessors/comments/1m4zg37/should_i_take_this_class/,Should I take this class?,"I did my masters degree and started teaching my second and final year (2023). I wanted to stay as Professor and teach, so I did, come to find out I was adjunct because my university doesn’t want to hire full time. I accepted it because I thought I’d at least make more than as a grad assistant. But in the Fall of 2024, I saw my first paycheck for 3 classes, less than as a graduate assistant. The next semester, Spring 2025 I was assigned two classes (at my university adjuncts can’t teach more than five classes a year). One got removed due to low enrollment so I only did one. Well I agreed to stay another year but asked if there’s full time, they said not right now. I saw that I was assigned only one class and only two students signed up. To no one’s surprise the class got removed due to this, but they’re offering me another class, they say it’s 80% full and not likely to get canceled. That said, it can also get reassigned to a full time professor, it said there are no guarantees. It’s also a red flag that last year I got 3 classes but this year only one, because enrollment and acceptance rates are down. So I’m debating if I need to accept this or just withdraw and find another career path. I also work at a coffee stand, and I’m not kidding, I make more there, in two weeks at the coffee stand I make double what I make in a month at the university. I’m also paying for my car insurance and note, the insurance is almost all my monthly paycheck. I love teaching but I can’t live off this, and the fact that I make more making people coffees, teas, energies, etc. really says a lot. So what should I do? 

TL, DR;
-My adjunct position is very shaky.
-Two classes have been canceled due to low enrollment.
-I make more at a coffee stand (no not Starbucks). 
-The pay is terrible. 
-I got car expenses. 
-Even with a potential new class, there’s no guarantee. ",1,1753043932.0,adjunctprofessors,0,1.0,False

The Gritty Truth, The Hard Numbers, The Next Giant Step","**Should Restaurants Even Offer Soda? The Gritty Truth, The Hard Numbers, The Next Giant Step**

Picture this. It’s a Saturday night. There is a neighborhood steakhouse with fire in its bones. The GM wants to know why the restaurant feels flat. The menu shines, service hums like a well-oiled grill, but revenue’s stuck. A server delivers six sodas to a family of four. Each glass sweats with syrup and ice, the fizz catching the neon. The mother takes a slow sip. She glances at her children, who crunch on ice cubes. Laughter bounces off the varnished walls. The table glows with comfort and calories.

Everyone in this business knows that soda pop is profit. Margins sky-high. No mise-en-place, no spoilage, no angry sous-chef cursing over wasted product. But we all know what lies behind the shine. Soda’s grip on menus has always been about convenience and cash, not care.

**The Real Cost of Soda Pop**

Now for the number that haunts me. Americans remaining loyal to soda, more than half drink at least one sugar-sweetened beverage a day, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention¹. The rub is that each sip is a slow poison. Sugar-sweetened drinks are directly linked to higher rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and yes, early death². In a European study following over 450,000 adults for 16 years, drinking just two soft drinks a day raised all-cause mortality by 17%³.

You may think that a single glass means nothing, that a little fizz cannot harm. You would be wrong. Soda, in any form, brings trouble for your guests. It erodes teeth, damages bones, harms kidneys, and stirs up cravings, leading to an avalanche of bad choices⁴. Diet sodas, hailed as harmless, only replace one risk with another, more acid, more gut disruption, more heart strain⁴.

Fortify that with American Diabetes Association guidance, and you’ll see the line moving on the balance sheet, from the guest’s health to the future of your brand.

**The Winds of Change**

Look around. Applebee’s and IHOP stripped soda off kids’ menus nationwide last year⁵. The Harvard School of Public Health found that children who drink sugary drinks are at higher risk for obesity and less healthy future outcomes⁵. It’s not just the chains, either. McDonald’s, Wendy’s, Subway, and Panera have done the same. Pressure is mounting from shareholders and health advocates. Once known as family safe havens, these places bet on a different story, that menus can lead, not follow.

**Menu Overhaul, Revenue Reborn**

But what about the numbers? Restaurants push through menu overhauls with one hard truth. Menu engineering raises profits. Not in theory. In bricks, in payroll, and it’s not wishful thinking. With a focused menu redesign, profit increases of 10% to 15% are typical⁶. Remove sabotaged, low-value items. Elevate your best sellers, your value-adds, your unique flavor signatures. Substitute specialty, health-forward drinks that cost pennies and wow the crowd. Kombucha, cold-brew teas, and house-made sodas with fruit and herb infusions. The future is small-batch, craft, clean.

Modern industry surveys show 80% of restaurant customers now order specialty drinks multiple times per week. Price is less important than the experience or the story behind the glass⁷. Millennials and Gen Z want house-made, want unique, want the health angle more than ever⁷. Coffee remains king, but the quickest growth is in crafted, alcohol-free beverages⁷.

Drop soda, and you make a bold first cut. You instantly signal that the old rules are gone. Guest satisfaction scores rebound. Parents return. Word spreads. Your restaurant and bar stand taller.

**Case Study: From Sodas to Sparkle, A Shift Toward Health-Conscious Beverage Programs**

In recent years, a growing number of independent and fast-casual restaurants across the U.S. have made bold operational shifts by eliminating conventional soda offerings in favor of more innovative, health-forward beverage programs⁸. One example, a chef-driven burger joint, followed this trend by removing all corn syrup soda products from its menu. While initial feedback from regulars was mixed, the restaurant quickly found success with a refreshed beverage lineup featuring cold-pressed juices, house-made shrubs, zero-proof cocktails, and sparkling mineral waters infused with herbs like rosemary and thyme.

This pivot aligns with a broader national movement away from sugary drinks and toward wellness-oriented dining, a shift that has been embraced by both independent restaurants and major chains⁹.

**Real-World Examples**

Several notable restaurants and chains have undertaken similar changes:

* **Lyra (Chicago, IL):** This upscale Greek restaurant offers a full nonalcoholic beverage menu featuring zero-proof cocktails, tea infusions, and fresh juices, emphasizing wellness and creativity in drink pairings¹⁰.
* **Pineapple and Pearls (Washington, D.C.):** The now-closed Michelin-starred restaurant pioneered thoughtful pairings of nonalcoholic drinks with tasting menus, replacing soda service entirely with house-made juice blends and fermented drinks¹¹.
* **Tender Greens (Multiple Locations):** This California-based fast-casual chain eliminated traditional soda fountains years ago, instead offering house-made agua frescas and brewed teas. “We wanted better-for-you options that still taste great,” said CEO Erik Oberholtzer in a 2018 interview¹².
* **Roti Modern Mediterranean (Nationwide):** Roti removed mainstream sodas in favor of fresh juices and flavored sparkling waters that align with its health-centric brand. Sales of these beverages outperformed previous soda revenue, especially when paired creatively with food offerings¹³.

**Operational Benefits & Financial Performance**

According to industry data from the National Restaurant Association and Technomic, restaurants offering healthier and house-made beverage programs report positive outcomes, including higher margins due to lower production costs, reduced waste from eliminating syrup bags and single-use cups, and increased customer engagement and loyalty¹⁴. Health-first beverage programs are frequently cited in 4- and 5-star guest reviews. According to Yelp data, beverage quality is among the top five most mentioned attributes in positive restaurant feedback¹⁵.

**Conclusion and Challenge**

In the end, this is more than a drink. It’s who we are. It’s the shape of our tables and the stories we tell. Soda pop is an anchor of the past, not a promise for the future. Guests are asking for life. Your numbers will thank you. Your brand will stand for something honest.

So, here’s my call. Be the first in your market to pull soda from the menu. Replace it with something built for today. Watch the dialogue surge. Let your restaurant become a leader in health and taste. Drive profits not through shortcuts, but by caring for your guests in every glass you offer.

Let’s rewrite the story of dining out. Let’s break the chain. You set the pace. Now run with it.

## Core Benefits

The advancements in door switch technology translate into tangible benefits for users across various applications.

**Enhanced Security:** Door switches integrated with security systems provide real-time monitoring of door status, offering an immediate alert when a door is opened unexpectedly. This can prevent break-ins and provide homeowners or business owners with peace of mind. As an example, a door switch connected to a smart home security system can send a push notification to a user's smartphone the moment a door is opened while they are away from home, allowing them to promptly check on the situation and, if needed, contact law enforcement.

**Improved Energy Efficiency:** Door switches can be used to control lighting, HVAC systems, and other energy-consuming appliances. When a door is opened, the switch can automatically turn on lights or adjust the temperature, ensuring that energy is only used when needed. Consider a walk-in refrigerator: a door switch can activate internal lighting only when the door is opened, significantly reducing energy waste. This is particularly pertinent in commercial settings where refrigerators and freezers are commonly used.

**Increased Safety:** In industrial environments, door switches can be used to prevent accidents by disabling machinery or equipment when a door or safety gate is opened. Such as, a door switch installed on a machine guard can automatically shut down the machine if the guard is opened during operation, preventing potential injuries to workers. This enhances safety compliance and reduces the risk of workplace accidents.

**Automated Convenience:** Integrating door switches with smart home systems allows for automated convenience, such as automatically turning on lights, controlling music systems, or starting coffee makers upon entering a room. This makes daily life more efficient. For instance, a door switch can be programmed to trigger a series of actions when a front door is opened – turning on the foyer light, playing a welcome message through the speaker system, and adjusting the thermostat – all without lifting a finger.

Well as I walked to the line, I got behind a person like normal and waited and off to my left was a bar like seating area with several people sitting there. This one guy in particular, was sitting down and attending to his children which were running around everywhere like crazy, he even left the store only to come back to his seat while I was still in line. His kids eventually run off towards the escalators and he takes off to go get them but before doing so, he tells me ""Hey we were behind this guy"" and then goes to get his kids. Him saying that really pissed me off because I knew he wasn't standing in line before hand and never said anything when I walked up to begin with. So he runs to get them and comes back to try and get in front of me and I don't budge, then this conversation happens:

Him: ""Hey we were behind this guy, thanks""

Me: ""You left the line, you don't get to tell me what to do""

Him: ""What are you talking about, we were behind this guy. Are you serious?""

Me: ""You left, you weren't even in line when I walked up, you were sitting down""

Him: ""I left to go get my son""

Me: ""I seen that but not my problem, you weren't in line""

Him: ""Real class act""

Me: ""Good""

Then he tells his kids and his wife that he's gonna get behind me in line, fine with me. Next he proceeds to ask me ""Did you actually serve in the military or do you just like military shirts"" and I inform him ""Its a XYZ armory shirt, not a military shirt"" (Its a local gun store shirt but features a F-16 on the back). After that last interaction we had no more issues, I didn't cuss in front of his children but I felt like I needed to stand my ground. I hate conflicts like that but this guy seemed like he's never been told No and that he never left his Frat group even though he was in his late 30s early 40s.

1m4zbps,https://www.reddit.com/r/dentures/comments/1m4zbps/how/,How?,"Good evening everyone, apologies for the long text but please bear with me.

I am male 36 yo and i have horrible teeth mostly due to my constant smoking (40 a day) and high sugar diet mixed with constant coffee intake. I have suffered with bad health anxiety for years but managed to calm it down until recently and i also have severe dental fobia for 16 years due to a butcher dentist attempting to take out infected and swollen wisdom tooth and breaking the neighbouring molar in pieces all without anaesthetic as even after 4 injections it didn't work. Since I haven't visited dentist except for antibiotics and couple of extractions as no other way. February i lost my front tooth (just fell down) as it was severely decayed so i told myself its time to do something and went to a recommended dentist who asked me to use high florude paste for 3 months and then she was certain she could do 3 fillings (ur1) (ur2) (ul2) and do a small Maryland bridge for the missing (ul1). however in early june she attempted the filling on ur1 and ur2 that left me with massive sensitivity to cold in ur1. after emergency appointment her colleague said it needs to be redone so 2 weeks later she attempted to redo it and on the next day i started feeling constant pain so again emergency appointment and again her colleague said its now infected and i need antibiotics. took amoxicillin for few days and it didn't work, pain was getting unbearable so on Saturday i called for another emergency and was told they got none, called 111 and saw nhs emergency dentist who said i need urgent root canal and metronidazole, i cant swallow pills so she gave me liquid version but it was Saturday and the few pharmacies that were open didn't haf it, by afternoon i was severely swollen from nose to eye and cheek so i called 111 and got send to a & e where i was put on IV antibiotics and had a scan. by Monday i had no change although pain started calming a bit and saw my dentist who was ready to do root canal but since i was swollen and in pain i absolutely refused as i told her this was my biggest fear and very very similar situation caused my fobia. she wasn't happy but let me go and told me she has no idea when she'll be able to see me. At this point i wasn't going to allow her to touch me again, not after 2 attemptes filling causing all of this.

I am currently in the process of forming a case against that dentist as her failed attempts have caused me almost 2 months of pain and tons of other issues as well as likely lost tooth.

fast forward the infection is settled but the tooth needs to be taken out according to my new dentist and she's not giving me any other options besides dentures as she's saying i have a lot of gum disease even though i have no wobbly teeth (i have 4 molars on top  and they all need extraction and no molara on the bottom except right side wisdom tooth which is impacted byt doesn't cause trouble) my front teeth + 2 pre molars (1 up 1 down) is all i have for chewing and now that my front tooth can't be used in stuck at almost liquid diet and i cant function like this. 

After reading about dentures how do you get used to this? I've seen so many people saying they dont work you can't bute you can't talk normally and they're not stable. If dentures cause issues on normal people how would they ever work for me ? with my anxiety i can't imagine myself going through that and my smoking (apparently they fall when you smoke especially like i do) habits will make them fall out constantly, not to mention my food habits which will also be very incompatibile. unfortunately I'm a technician but i also face customers constantly and I can't do my job without my front teeth.... I'm stuck in a loop not knowing what to do... can't eat can't smile but  i also can't put myself up with these potential dentures problems as i know myself and j wont be able to. 

if anyone has any ideas or advice please share them as I'm at my wit's end at this point and i can't figure any way out of this... 

PS implants wont work due to bone and smoking and dentist saying bridges or anything like that is a no no.

1m4z97z,https://www.reddit.com/r/iwatchedanoldmovie/comments/1m4z97z/9_to_5_1980/,9 to 5 (1980),"The first half hour of 9 to 5 is a light comedy focused primarily on the ways that systemic male dominance in the workplace maligns and disrespects women workers. However, this becomes secondary for the remainder of the movie, as it shifts into a vehicle primarily for showcasing absurd comedic situations. Although the ending returns to the importance of elevating women's contributions and status at work, for the majority of the film that theme recedes into the background as we are taken through a series of outrageous scenarios. Not only is our attention removed from the plight of gender discrimination, these situations significantly decrease the viewer's sympathy and positive view of the lead women. The movie sincerely wants to make a profound comment on gender inequality, but instead pulls its punches, preferring to transform into a zany, ridiculous comedy. 

In the initial set-up for the film, we are introduced to Franklin Hart, the sexist, perverted, egotistical boss; Violet, a highly competent senior supervisor from whom Hart steals ideas and is passed over for a promotion in favor of a man explicitly because he's a man; Doralee, Hart's personal secretary and the victim of his sexual harrassment and desperate attempts at seduction; and Judy, a new employee learning of the various ways that women are mistreated and the resulting low morale. Soon after the three women bond over their shared sense of injustice and get stoned together in commiseration, we are suddenly taken into a lengthy sequence with each fantasizing about murdering their boss in different ways. Judy imagines hunting him down as he flees from disgruntled workers, following him into a bathroom stall and blasting him with a shotgun. Doralee's fantasy subjects him to the same disgusting harassment he has done to her, before roasting him alive on a spit. Violet transforms into Snow White and is accompanied by a cast of Bambi-esque animated animals to abet her as she delivers him a cup of coffee spiked with a toxin and, presumably unsatisfied with death by poisoning, pulls a lever to send him hurling out of his chair and out the window of his high-rise office, receiving an ""A-OK"" sign from one of her bird accomplices.

Why not a fantasy sequence in which they channel their justified grievances into something constructive and reflective of their intelligence, vision, and sense of equity? Perhaps foreshadow the changes that they were to make when had power at the end? Why fantasize about killing him, which would do nothing to improve their lot, as he would just be replaced by another man? Fantasies of worker solidarity are hinted at in Judy's dream sequence--as a blood-thirsty lynch mob--but since we're in the realm of fantasy, why not give us democratic worker's councils, in which each worker has an equal say about how the workplace should be organized and run?

It reminds me of people who are incapable of having a serious conversation for more than a minute or two without getting uncomfortable and needing to crack a joke, seeing their primary function in a conversation as injecting levity and randomness. This can interrupt and derail the discussion and inhibit important points from being made because now we're expending energy on laughing, or having to fake laugh. There's clearly a time for all that, but when it assumes central stage, everything else will, by definition, be peripheral. This is particularly the case when the joke undermines the point you want to make. For instance, say you want to make an important point about gender equality, but your heroines follow their murderous fantasies and nearly do poison their evil boss, then shove a corpse in their trunk thinking it was his body, intent on sinking it in the ocean to cover up their crime, then kidnap and hog-tie the boss, shoot a gun at him when he tries to escape, chain him to the ceiling, and keep him captive for weeks. One may be inclined to focus more on the bizarre and deranged behavior of the protagonists than the perversion of the boss or the gender pay gap and inequality in the workplace. 

I may sound like a stick in the mud, but it's disappointing that a film I've heard my whole life was an illustration of female empowerment at work was not much more than a ludicrous comedy. The sequence that should have been central was hurried along: when they have power to make changes at work. They forge his signature on memos to initiate pay equity, job-sharing, flexible hours, onsite daycare, inclusion of disabled workers, and allow family photos to be displayed on the desk (only women are shown enjoying that privilege). It would have been much more inspiring to see the three discussing the importance of these changes and implementing them with the help of other workers. 

The worst insults comes at the end. When Russell Tinsworthy, the Chairman of the Board returns to investigate all the transformative changes initiated by Judy, Violet and Doralee and the improved efficiency and morale in the office, Frank takes and receives all the credit for it while the women remain, for the most part, mum. A formerly disheveled and depressed alcoholic employee approaches him looking spruced up and vigorous, gushing with gratitude for instituting an alcohol rehab program and sending supportive notes of encouragement. The bewildered Frank accepts the praise as the true instigators of the program and encouraging letter writers simply smile. Violet makes a good impression on the Chairman by elaborating on the reforms, but is never explicitly recognized as the architect. How could she be, given she had Frank bound and gagged in order to carry them out? Russell heaps praise on Hart's creativity and vision and rewards him with a promotion, a bonus, and a posting to Brazil. It's ambiguous to me whether this is supposed to be seen as some sort of punishment; with mentions of ""the climate"" and ""the jungle,"" and the cringe-inducing fact we learn in the postscript he was kidnapped and disappeared by Amazonian natives. It's certainly not a satisfying ""just desserts."" He gets full credit for everything; Violet, Judy and Doralee get none. Furthermore, it is an order that Russell coerces the dismayed Hart into accepting as the Chairman, warning him that he ""doesn't take no for an answer."" Judy, Violet and Doralee beam with glee as the Chairman, with his cabal of male underlings following him, throws his weight around and forces his employees to take postings they don't want. 

We also learn in the postscript that Violet replaced Frank as Vice President; however, during his visit, the Chairman took Frank aside to let him know that they'd be reversing the gender pay equity policies. ""That equal pay thing, that's got to go. It's all right as an incentive, but we don't need to keep priming the pump."" This prompts a shocked look between Doralee and Judy, but no further word is said on it. Do we therefore understand that Violet accepted the promotion at a lower rate of pay? The movie concludes with the three protagonists drinking champagne in celebration, and my wife and I asking each other, what are they celebrating? 

One may argue, [as the BFI did here](https://www.bfi.org.uk/features/nine-five-feminism-jane-fonda), that the fact that they get no credit for their effort and the pay equity policy is reversed, ""reflects the frustrations of the time in which it’s set."" However, it actually reflects the constraints the film put upon itself by choosing to principally be an off-the-wall comedy with ridiculous scenarios. One could imagine an ending in which they exposed the truth: that they were the ones who instituted these reforms, that inhibiting women's voices at work is bad for everyone, and that Frank is a sick pervert who uses his jobs to try and get sexual favors. Then they could have formed an organization dedicating to spreading these reforms, following the real 9to5 movement. But Jane Fonda [stated](https://web.archive.org/web/20210430230929/https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/125651063) that they chose to make it a comedy instead of a drama because ""any way we did it, it seemed too preachy, too much of a feminist line...I'm just super-sensitive to anything that smacks of the soapbox or lecturing the audience.""  

""Show, don't tell"" sure; it's far less effective in film to ""lecture"" than to construct scenes and characters that carry messages in themselves. But the fact that they couldn't find a way to make a feminist film without being preachy, or deliver important messages without standing on a soapbox seems to be more indicative of a lack of imagination. Or, perhaps, fear of going against the mainstream party line in America: capitalism is good for everyone, just needs some light tinkering around the edges.

I'd like to think that I have my shit together... I am financially sound, debt free, my own place and vehicle, been told I'm good looking and I come from an intact family.

That said, any other guys like me also feel  Hoboken is a very unfriendly town?

Been living here for a while and love the walkability, the views, and the coffee scene. But sometimes I miss the simple “hello” or eye contact you get in other places. Everyone here is hustling, AirPods in, eyes down, and it can feel like we’re all living in our own bubbles.

Women - especially the more attractive they are - are not only unapproachable, but literally look like they're going to get sick if a man has the audacity to talk to them.. .they seem to ACTIVELY avoid it!

It's not like this in other parts of the country. It seems to be unique only to Hoboken and urban areas like this.

I’m not trying to hit on strangers in the street, but I do miss the small human moments—a nod, a smile, a “good morning.” 

Anyone else notice this? Would love to hear how others build community here beyond work and existing circles.

1m4z5yb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4z5yb,Four furious days in Oregon,"Four days of smashing through the Gorge and Central Oregon at a furious pace. I live in Oregon, but wanted to showcase it to a great friend of mine that has never spent time here except on the coast. 

Day 0: 
Fetching my buddy at PDX in the evening, then grabbing some late night slices at Baby Doll Pizza. On to Troutdale for the night so we can hit the gorge super early. 

Day 1: 
- Waterfall binge through the gorge very early in the morning to beat the crowds and a stop at the beautiful and interesting Bonneville Fish Hatchery 
- Lunch in Hood River at Grasslands BBQ
- Afternoon: stopped at some orchards for fresh fruit along the way down Hwy 30.
- Tamanawas Falls hike near Mt. Hood.
- Drove to Timberline Lodge and took a short hike up  Mt. Hood.
- Drive to Bend. Dinner at some taqueria that I would never return to. 

Day 2: 
- Smith Rock State Park early in the AM before it got hot. Did the 4-mile Misery Ridge and river trail. Gorgeous views.
- Lunch at the Pump House in Terrebone. 
- Afternoon drive to John Day Fossil Beds. Visited both Sheep Rock and Painted Hills. Temp was over 100F, so didn't do any extended hiking there.
- Evening, drove back to Bend and went to Summer Fest downtown. Grabbed dinner at Ken's Artisan Pizza. 

Day 3:
- Crater Lake. On the road by 5:45am and encountered very little traffic on our way to doing the boat shuttle out of Wizard Island at 9:00. 
- The lake was a perfect crystal glass sheen and just magical. Wizard Island felt like a otherworldly experience. Hiked to the top, witnessed a helicopter rescue or some idiot that illegally hiked into the caldera and fell. Even drank the water. I've never seen anything so blue before in my life. 
- Drove the rim road and had a leisurely lunch we brought with us at an overlook. 
- We probably could have squeezed in Tokatee Falls as well, but we headed back to Bend.
- Dinner at Rancher Butcher Chef steakhouse in Bend. 

Day 4:
- Morning hike to Tumalo and Double Falls. 
- On to Sisters for some breakfast and coffee at the Sisters Bakery.
- Onward up Highway 242 towards Dee Wright Observatory on McKenzie Pass. This place is a volcano wonderland, surrounded by volcanoes on all sides while you wind through ancient lava flows. 
- Proxy Falls. I've driven by the trailhead numerous times, but never bothered. Boy, have I missed out. Gorgeous waterfall that takes a little extra effort to get to. 
- McKenzie River trail. We stopped and walked a little bit of it before reaching Sahalie and Koosah falls. Easy but gorgeous 1-mile trail along the McKenzie River headwaters. 
- From there, 2.5 hour drive back to Portland to drop off my friend at the airport. Still had time to eat at my favorite Portland pizza spot, Apizza Scholls. 

I felt like we did the shit out of it, saw some incredible scenery, engorged ourselves on waterfalls and pizza, and had the experience of a lifetime at Crater Lake.

1m4z5lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1m4z5lg/mst_gone_but_not_forgotten/,"MST, Gone But Not Forgotten","There are people you encounter in life who are unforgettable, not because they were always kind or always right, but because they were always *real*. Matt Trout, or MST as most of us knew him, was one of those people.

# The First Encounter

Like many in the Perl community, I first met Matt and the cult of personality surrounding him in the early 90s on IRC. Back then, IRC wasn’t just a place to get help with Perl; it was the coffee shop, the lecture hall, and the colosseum. And MST? He was Caesar, the philosopher king, and the executioner rolled into one. Flanked by his loyal sycophants, Matt held court with the kind of smug self-assurance that either made you want to follow him into the fire or punch him in the throat.

We clashed. Subtly, then directly, and ultimately indirectly. I regarded him as a smug, pretentious, and self-aggrandizing Perl expert who built a cult-like following around himself. I think he regarded me as an idiot, largely clueless and inept, but with some intuition for creating good APIs. I think we were both right, in our way.

# The Borg Effect

There was a time when I failed someone I cared about because of Matt. A friend of mine, mistreated by Matt on IRC, and I didn’t speak up. I think that friend lost respect for me that day, and maybe rightfully so. I didn’t even see Matt’s behavior as egregious at the time. That’s the thing about proximity: get too close to a gravitational force, and your own compass starts to spin. Maybe I was becoming one of his drones. Maybe I *was* joining the Borg.

# The Work We Did

I worked on a few projects and ideas with Matt. Nothing grand. We didn’t build empires together, but we did tinker. Mostly, he’d loop me in to review or give feedback on projects he cared about. Again, I think he appreciated my ability to create intuitive software APIs. My favorite of those projects is [plx](https://github.com/shadowcat-mst/plx) which inspired my own attempt in [vns](https://metacpan.org/dist/Venus/view/bin/vns). The last thing we collaborated on was a Perl metalanguage he called [XCL](https://github.com/shadowcat-mst/xcl), his idea, my support. He wanted feedback. I think he genuinely respected my instinct for building intuitive APIs, even if he wouldn’t admit it publicly. I like to believe he saw *something* in my approach. And me? I respected his vision, even when I thought his software interfaces were complete trash.

# The Man Behind the Mask

Matt wasn’t easy to know. But for those who caught him offstage, outside the snark, outside the flamewars, he was someone else entirely. We had a few private, quiet conversations about politics and philosophy. That’s where the mask slipped. Matt seemed to hold a lot of “woke” beliefs, but he was also able to laugh at a lot of the silliness on the extreme ends of both the left and the right, as well as criticize (and be critical of) certain dogma. Oh, and yes, I also remember Matt as having the classic and cliched British snobbery, disdain, and condescension for all things American; but America is number one, so who gives a fuck *(, ... lol and winks at mst)*.

# The Final Word

I came to appreciate Matt. Not just the ideas, but the contradictions. I thought his ideas were often brilliant, his APIs often garbage. His leadership was tyrannical, and yet his fellowship and community involvement, benevolent. He was both cult leader and community builder. Critic and contributor. A walking contradiction, like most of us—but louder.

In the end, I think we were more similar than either of us was willing to admit.

The last few interactions that we had were overwhelmingly positive. I write this post to shout into the ether, **Matt, I remember you**.

The smoke curled wrong.

Caleb stood in the kitchen, watching the tobacco twist and flicker in the small clay dish he’d found at a thrift shop. The instructions had been clear: once a week, burn the leaves, let the smoke roll through the pine grain. Keep the book asleep.

But this morning, the smoke didn’t rise. It sank. Like mist on a grave.

Caleb frowned, nudged the dish, and tried not to think about whether he’d bought the right leaves. Or whether it mattered that he skipped the pine chips today because he was out and didn't feel like going to the hardware store.

He muttered to himself, “Smoke is smoke.”

He held his breath as he slid the pine box open just a crack—checking that the book was still there. Still dark. Still silent.

It was.

But it also *wasn't*. The air around it felt tighter. Denser. As if something were bracing.

Caleb shut the lid and stepped back, the bitter scent of tobacco clinging to his sleeves. He left the dish smoldering on the counter and opened a window, letting in a current of cool morning air. Ivy watched him from the windowsill, eyes narrow, tail flicking. She didn’t trust the box. He was starting to agree.

He glanced down at the Mark on his wrist. It didn’t burn. But it *tingled*. Like a nerve half-awake.





That night, he couldn’t sleep.

The dream from before lingered behind his eyes—Jonas’s hand, the warmth of the forest, the voice that spoke from the trees. *Return what was taken.*

But taken from where?

Caleb sat cross-legged on the floor, the pine box in front of him, his fingers drumming lightly against the latch.

He told himself he just wanted to look. Just to make sure it wasn’t… changing.

He unlatched it.

The Book of the Dead looked the same—bark-colored leather, runes shifting like oil on water. But the longer he stared, the more certain he became that the symbols weren’t random. They were almost legible now. One looked like the word “hush.” Another like “hollow.”

He reached for his notebook and started sketching them down. Just for reference. Just for—

He whispered one. Softly. Barely audible.

“Let stillness quiet the loud.”

A pulse shot through the room like a cold wind. The lights flickered. Ivy shrieked and bolted out of the room, knocking a lamp over in her scramble.

Caleb’s heart slammed in his chest. He stood, half-expecting the book to leap at him.

Nothing moved.

But the walls… *listened.*





At 3:12 a.m., he heard the knock.

Three slow taps.

From inside the pine box.

He sat frozen on the couch, eyes wide in the dark.

He waited. Held his breath.

Then moved.

The box was exactly where he left it. The latch untouched. The smell of old pine and charred tobacco filled his nose as he leaned in and opened it.

The book hadn’t moved.

But beneath it, laid neatly on the bottom of the box, was a feather. Black as soot. Singed at the edges.

He stared. He didn’t touch it. His wrist itched—the Mark glowing softly in the dark, faint as a dying ember.





By morning, Caleb had almost convinced himself it hadn’t happened.

But as he stepped outside for a coffee, the building’s handyman was speaking with a neighbor near the sidewalk, voices low and mournful.

“Just curled up and died,” the man was saying. “Vet said there was nothing wrong with him.”

“God, poor Scout,” the neighbor replied. “He was only seven.”

Caleb froze.

Scout. The friendly golden lab from the first floor. He’d just seen him the day before—tail wagging, tongue out, barking loudly in the courtyard.

*Let stillness quiet the loud.*

His stomach dropped.

He hadn’t meant it. He hadn’t meant *anything*.

But maybe that didn’t matter.





That evening, he tried to focus on anything else—cleaned the apartment, played music, scrolled on his phone without registering anything. But his reflection in the window kept pulling his attention.

The sun had just dipped below the trees. A soft dusk. The kind that made mirrors into doors.

He walked into the bathroom, splashed water on his face.

And then it happened.

The mirror fogged instantly, unnaturally, as though someone had exhaled from inside the glass.

And in the fog—**a figure.**

Seven feet tall, maybe more. Draped in what looked like fur and moss and shadow. Amber eyes gleamed through the vapor, steady and bright. A head crowned with bark or bone or both.

No movement. No words spoken aloud.

But Caleb *heard* it.

*You broke silence.*

The mirror cracked—just for a second. A hairline fracture down the center.Caleb stumbled back, heart pounding.

He blinked.

The mirror was fine.

Pristine.

But he wasn’t.





Later, he drove.

He didn’t know where he was going until he parked at Discovery Park again. The hill overlooked the water. The wind carried salt and pine in equal measure. He sat on the grass and let the quiet wrap around him.

It didn’t last.

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw movement in the trees.

Slow. Tall.

He turned fully, and this time—he didn’t question what he saw.

**The Watcher.**

At the treeline. Standing. Unmoving.

Fur and moss. Amber eyes. A body like a tree learned how to walk.

It wasn’t hiding.

It was letting him see.

Caleb stood. Took one step forward.

The Watcher didn’t react.

But the trees behind it *shivered*. A subtle tremor. The grass at Caleb’s feet went still.

Then, in a blink—it was gone.

Not vanished. Just… stepped back into where he couldn’t follow.

The bark on the nearest trees looked darker. Singed.

*It wasn’t just a warning anymore,* Caleb thought. *It was a countdown.*





That night, before bed, Caleb took a sticky note and wrote in black ink:

**DO NOT READ.**

He stuck it to the pine box. Stared at it. Tried to make it feel like enough.

Sometime around 3 a.m., he woke up again. No knocking. No dreams.

Just a feeling.

He walked to the box, peeled the note off, and crumpled it in his hand.

He didn’t throw it away.He didn’t put it back.

He just stood there.

Listening to nothing.

1m4z2v3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4wxx9,Antique Copper Water Still Restoration – Could This Have Been Used in Early Coffee Brewing Labs?,"— stumbled onto this old copper water still while cleaning out an old site. It’s a W. Still & Sons model (London), likely from the late 1800s to early 1900s, and it’s built like a tank.

It caught my attention because of how much it resembles old steam-era lab gear — and maybe even something you'd see in a Victorian coffee lab or distillation setup.


---

🛠️ What I’ve Done So Far:

Cleaned up the oxidized copper with ketchup + vinegar + Brasso

Preserved the manufacturer’s nameplate (didn’t over-polish)

Lightly buffed with 0000 wire wool to remove flaky oxidation without killing 

This is the kind of early lab-grade water distiller that may have been used in apothecaries or early cafés to purify water or steam heat

There’s a growing trend of vintage scientific gear being repurposed into coffee brewing stations, pour-over stands, or steam-brew displays

It’s a beautiful conversation piece — even if non-functional — and would look amazing in a roastery or espresso bar

Anyone here seen this used in old coffeehouses, cafés, or labs?

Know of UK-based collectors or baristas who display vintage equipment like this?

Any interest in restoring more of these for coffee décor or setups?coffeehistory #vintagecoffee #coffeelab #restorationproject #brassandcopper #rcoffee #steamgear #brewgear #coffeeaesthetic #coffeenerd

Usually, the first two dates are some sort of variation of coffee, pub, walk, board games and date #3 involves inviting the person over where I cook for them.

The pattern I’m noticing is that between the second and the third date, it feels that if I don’t text/arrange plans the other person pulls away. Which indeed sucks, but there’s not much that I can do about it. If people aren’t interested, I don’t really want to force anything nor be with them.

Other than the usual suspects like chemistry not building up, ghosting, people being uninteresting etc, I realise that unfortunately, I objectively don’t know anymore what to suggest after date #3.

Fortunately, that is something that I can act on and improve.

Everyone is different, I know, but ultimately my questions boil down to this:

1.	⁠How do you gauge whether someone is just maybe shy vs uninterested? Do you actively do something to facilitate chemistry or do you go with the flow?
2.	⁠What do you do after date three? Do you progress more towards stuff like exhibitions, dinners, cocktail bars, ? Genuinely trying to gauge for ideas
3.	⁠Do people still go out without needing dating apps? I feel that the only way to meet people open to dating these days is via apps.

While I was genuinely impressed with much it has to offer, there were a few things worth noting that might sway your decision, depending on your preferences.

**The Bold Flavor You Crave**

I have to say, the French Roast flavor delivered exactly what I love about dark coffee. It’s bold, full-bodied, and has a smoky finish that feels like a warm hug waking you up in the morning. These pods are made from high-quality 100% Arabica beans, handpicked and grown at high altitudes, and that attention to sourcing shines through in every sip. Whether I brewed these in the morning to jumpstart my day or in the afternoon for a pick-me-up, it never disappointed. If you’re someone who loves that deep, rich coffee taste, these pods are going to tick the flavor box for you. 

**Eco-Friendly & Compostable Design**

Another huge upside for me was the sustainable nature of these coffee pods. The OneCup pods and their packaging are made from plant-based materials and are certified commercially compostable by BPI. As someone who’s trying to be more eco-conscious, I appreciated being able to enjoy my coffee guilt-free, knowing it wasn’t piling up in landfills like many traditional coffee pods do. It’s honestly refreshing to see a company take sustainability this seriously.

The pods are specifically designed to work with most single-serve coffee makers, including K-cup style machines like Keurig 2.0, which I use daily. I’ve had issues with other off-brand pods in the past, where they didn’t quite fit properly or didn’t puncture correctly in the machine. Thankfully, these pods worked seamlessly, every single time. That kind of reliability when you’re half-awake and desperate for coffee can’t be overstated.

**Packaging & Coffee Freshness**

These come in an 80-count package, which is perfect for someone like me who drinks coffee every day. The storage bag is designed to keep the coffee fresh, and even weeks later, I noticed that that rich aroma was as strong as ever. However, one thing to keep in mind is that the packaging is plant-based, which means you’ll want to store it carefully to maintain optimal freshness. This isn’t a flaw, but more of a minor tradeoff for the eco-friendly design.

**Usability & Taste Testing**

Flipping between different coffee strengths, I tested these pods with variable water ratios—short, medium, and long pours. While the flavor was excellent with stronger short brews, the smoky notes started to dilute slightly with lighter, larger cups. Depending on your preferences, it might not be the ideal taste for those who enjoy a mild coffee feel. Personally, I liked it best on the medium setting for a balanced flavor.

**Benefits**

- The product’s rich French Roast flavor is robust and ideal for dark roast lovers.
- Made with environmentally friendly, compostable pods.
- Compatible with most single-serve coffee machines, avoiding mechanical issues.
- Thoughtfully sourced Arabica beans grown with care.
- Bold aroma and freshness in a large-count package.

**Caveats**

- The smoky finish may overpower if you prefer more nuanced, lighter coffee profiles.
- Packaging, though eco-friendly, requires careful storage to maintain peak freshness.
- Sustainability comes with added care—home composting may not be straightforward for everyone.

**Peer Products**

When it comes to coffee pods, direct competitors like Starbucks K-Cup Pods and Green Mountain Coffee Roasters enter the conversation. Starbucks often has those globally recognized, polished flavors, but they lack the eco-friendly approach these compostable pods bring. Green Mountain Coffee offers a wider flavor variety, but in my experience, their dark roasts just don’t hit the same bold notes. However, Green Mountain pods might appeal more if you like lighter or flavored coffees. If eco-friendliness and boldness are your priorities though, these French Roast pods win hands down.

**Worth Every Penny**

Here’s the big question: are these pods worth it for their features? Given how much coffee I drink, it’s not just the flavor and compatibility that matter, but also the long-term cost savings and the environmental impact. In terms of value proposition, I’d definitely consider this product as hitting that sweet spot. While some people may balk at eco-conscious pods because of the lesser familiarity with composting, the overall experience makes it worth stretching a little out of your comfort zone. 

For an overall eco-friendly, high-quality option that doesn’t compromise on taste, this product earns its place in your coffee rotation.

With endless options, slick marketing, and a sea of reviews, it's tough to cut through the noise and find genuinely **valuable products** that actually solve your problems and last.

If you've ever searched for ""best products to buy today"" and just gotten more confused, this post is for you. I've spent way too much time perfecting my online detective skills, and I'm sharing my actionable strategies to help you become a smarter shopper. Let's find those hidden gems and avoid the duds!

# Before You Click ""Add to Cart"": Define Your Needs

The first step to finding the *right* product isn't about searching; it's about clarity.

* **What Problem Are You Solving?** Don't just buy a gadget; buy a solution. Are you trying to save time, improve a hobby, or fix a recurring issue?
* **Essential vs. Nice-to-Have Features:** List out what you absolutely need and what would be a bonus. This helps filter out irrelevant options.
* **Set a Realistic Budget (and Stick to It!):** Knowing your price range narrows down choices immediately and prevents overspending.
* **Consider Longevity:** Are you looking for a quick fix or something that will stand the test of time (r/BuyItForLife style)?

# Become a Digital Detective: Where to Look & What to Scrutinize

Once you know what you need, it's time to dig deep.

# Beyond the First Page: Diverse Sources are Your Best Friends

Don't just rely on Amazon's top results or sponsored links. Expand your horizons!

* **Niche Forums & Communities (Like Reddit!):** Seriously, this is gold. Search specific subreddits (e.g., r/HomeImprovement, r/Frugal, r/GamingLaptops) for real user experiences, common issues, and long-term reviews. Often, you'll find direct comparisons and advice you won't get elsewhere.
* **Specialized Review Sites:** Think Wirecutter, RTINGS, The Sweet Setup, or specific tech/appliance review sites. These often do hands-on testing and in-depth comparisons.
* **Manufacturer Websites:** Go straight to the source for precise specifications, manuals, and warranty details. Don't rely solely on third-party listings for technical info.
* **Independent Blogs & YouTube Channels:** Look for content creators who actually *use* the products and offer balanced perspectives, not just unboxing videos.
* **Social Media (with Caution):** Instagram and TikTok can show products in real-world scenarios, but be wary of heavily sponsored content. Look for genuine users.

# Decoding Reviews: Spotting the Real Gems (and the Fakes!)

Reviews are crucial, but many are unreliable. Here's how to evaluate them:

* **Look for Verified Purchases:** On platforms like Amazon, this badge is a good start, though not foolproof.
* **Detailed Pros and Cons:** Genuine reviews offer balanced feedback, mentioning both positives and negatives. Vague or overly enthusiastic reviews (""OMG this is the BEST EVER!"") are red flags.
* **Check Reviewer History:** If a profile has only one five-star review for a single product, or dozens of five-star reviews for unrelated items posted within minutes, be suspicious.
* **Analyze the Language:** Watch out for repetitive phrases, poor grammar (unless it's clearly a non-native speaker), or ""scene-setting"" language that sounds like a marketing script.
* **Sudden Spikes in Reviews:** If a product suddenly gets hundreds of five-star reviews in a short period, it's often a sign of review manipulation.
* **Consider the Source:** Did the reviewer receive the product for free or at a discount? This doesn't automatically discredit it, but weigh it accordingly.
* **Use Third-Party Tools (Skeptically):** Tools like Fakespot or ReviewMeta can sometimes help identify suspicious patterns, but don't rely on them as gospel.

# The Power of Comparison: Side-by-Side Analysis

Don't buy the first product that looks good. Compare, compare, compare!

* **Create Your Own Comparison Table:** Even a simple bulleted list can help. Compare 3-5 top contenders based on your essential features, price, warranty, and customer service reputation.
* **Focus on Key Decision Factors:** What truly matters to you? Battery life? Durability? Ease of use? Prioritize these.
* **Look for Quantitative Measurements:** ""It's fast"" is vague. ""It transfers data at 100MB/s"" is useful.
* **Consider Long-Term Durability & Maintenance:** A cheaper product might cost more in repairs or replacements down the line.

# Don't Get Scammed: Verifying Products & Sellers

Even after research, you need to ensure you're getting a legitimate product from a trustworthy source.

* **Check Seller Reputation:** On marketplaces, look at seller ratings, number of transactions, and recent feedback. Stick to ""Fulfilled by Amazon"" or ""Shipped by Walmart"" when possible.
* **Official Brand Channels:** If possible, buy directly from the manufacturer's website or their authorized retailers.
* **Product Authentication Tools:** Some brands offer ways to verify authenticity via serial numbers on their website. Check if the product has a unique QR code or holographic sticker.
* **Examine Product Images Carefully:** Look for high-resolution images, consistent branding, and no obvious typos or low-quality graphics.
* **Trust Your Gut:** If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of wildly discounted ""luxury"" items.
* **Understand Return & Refund Policies:** Before you buy, know the seller's policy in case something goes wrong.

# Leverage the Hive Mind: How Reddit Can Help You Buy Smart

Reddit is a treasure trove of unfiltered opinions and collective experience. Here's how to use it:

* **Search Existing Subreddits:** Before asking, search subreddits like r/AskReddit, r/LifeProTips, r/BuyItForLife, r/Frugal, r/Productivity, or specific product communities (e.g., r/headphones, r/coffee). Someone has probably asked your question already!
* **Ask Specific Questions:** If you can't find an answer, create your own post. Be clear about your needs, budget, and what you've already researched. Provide context.
* **Share Your Research:** Even if you're asking for advice, showing you've done some homework (e.g., ""I'm torn between X and Y because of Z features..."") often leads to better, more detailed responses.
* **Engage with Comments:** Reply to users who offer advice, ask follow-up questions, and thank them. This builds community and encourages more interaction.

# Your Turn, Redditors!

Finding the **best products to buy today** isn't about blind luck; it's about smart, informed decision-making. By doing your homework, scrutinizing reviews, and leveraging community knowledge, you can make purchases you won't regret.

The whole history is wild. Coffee started as “qahwa” - a drink used by Sufi mystics for spiritual rituals. Then it spread to regular people and by 1511, some governor in Mecca was like “wait, is this stuff making people drunk?”

Thankfully they ruled it wasn’t actually intoxicating, just restricted public gatherings around it. Imagine if they’d banned it completely - no Starbucks, no morning coffee runs, humanity would be doomed.

Also TIL there’s something called “qishr” where they brew the coffee bean husks instead of the actual beans. Yemen still does this and apparently it tastes sweet and spicy. Might have to try making some.

Which is frustrating me because I was so thrilled to have coffee after not having anything to drink but water for the past 3 months because of exposure.

People were not exaggerating when they said the church was dying holy shit. Turnout was very low, it was a stark contrast to jummah prayers where parking spaces are like gold dust.
 I must’ve been the only one there under 30, apart from a couple children brought along by their parents. 80% elderly, however more ethnically diverse than I expected. Many came from other denominations or faiths entirely. Prots you need to get hunping.


They still do the old Lord’s Prayer and “also with you.” My catholic school-educated self completely fudged this up.

They take contactless offerings

Communion is now apple juice apparently?

They have tea and coffee afterwards which is cute. Maybe if they offered lost Mary’s they could entice young people back to the church?

The building was pretty, with mosaics, candles, stained glass windows and a Romanesque barrel vaulted roof. Turns out Catholics do not have a monopoly on beauty.

Despite this, it lacked a distinct aura.

There was no organist, rather the music was played over a sound system.

I’ll give them points for Eucharistic efficiency. Bang on an hour, but managed to fit in a lot of songs, gospel readings and sermons in that time.

I’m applying for a position to provide musical enrichment to aid in the cognitive development of preschool aged children, and would be bouncing between most likely 2 schools every day, with 15 separate elem. schools in the district. 
Trouble is, I have nearly 0 classroom experience. I say nearly because I’ve been working as a substitute custodian and have been allowed to play for the elementary school students in my free time. As well as the preschool students in their classrooms. 
I’ve really enjoyed playing for the preschool students and I’ve come up with several ideas for playing music for them. I had a meeting with the preschool director last week. She’s interested and wants to see if we can make it work. There is grant money from the state for music and arts enrichment. Now I need to rewrite my resume to include musical studies and performing experience. 

I’ve worked in the roofing industry for nearly 30 years until a recent injury forced me to end. Over the past 1 1/2 years, I’ve been a substitute custodian in my daughter’s school district. I’ve been playing music for 35 years now, mostly guitar, while I have no degrees or credentials, I’m mostly self taught, but did study flamenco with a teacher and played for the flamenco dance class at a community college several years ago (not a payed position but an added benefit of taking lessons with my ‘maestro’). And I’ve played in several bands throughout the years, mostly semi pro level where I was gigging from coffee shops and dive bars, to small festivals maybe 5x per month. Nothing where we had signed contracts or booking agents/managers. 

Currently my resume only reflects roofing experience and custodial. Any help on how to write my resume would be greatly appreciated

1m4ytqr,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4ytqr,"Even out of town, I still made sure the guys got their Saturday meals. Because showing up matters.","Every Saturday, I cook three meals for a group of guys in my town who don’t have much, some live in their cars, some sleep rough, a few just kind of drift. They’re all good people who’ve been dealt a tough hand, and I’ve been there myself. So I do what I can: food, conversation, consistency.

It’s not part of an organization, not a church thing, not a charity, just me, showing up in the best way I know how. Some weeks that means pancakes and coffee on a camp stove. Other times it’s bagged lunches and hot dogs on the grill. It’s not about perfection. It’s about showing up.

This past Saturday, I had to be out of town. My cousin had a jiu-jitsu tournament, and there was no way I was going to miss it. She’s young, she’s tough, and she’s trying to chase something better for herself, I’m so proud of her.

But that left me with a dilemma: how do I keep my commitment to the guys when I won’t even be in town for lunch?

So I woke up early and made a bunch of breakfast burritos, eggs, ham, bacon, sausage, cheese, wrapped in foil, and delivered them that morning. I told the guys I’d be gone but they wouldn’t go hungry.

Then I called in a favor. A good friend of mine, the kind of friend who *just gets it*, stepped up and bought them Mexican food for lunch. I don’t know what all he got them, but I heard there were full bellies and smiling faces.

When I finally got back into town, I met the crew in a parking lot for dinner. Someone I’d talked to recently, a manager at a local McDonald’s, had donated a bunch of hamburger patties after hearing what I do. So we fired up the little grill and made burgers. Nothing fancy, just patties, buns, a few condiments, and some good conversation.

There was this moment, sun starting to go down, a breeze rolling through, people laughing over melted cheese and ketchup, and I thought: *this is it.* This is what it means to be human. To be seen. To matter. To show up for each other, even when it’s not convenient. **Especially** when it’s not convenient.

It might not sound like much, but to them, and honestly, to me, it means everything.",103,1753042405.0,wholesome,5,0.96,False
1m4yt8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayUpgrades/comments/1m4yt8o/does_the_cuisinart_cmw100_microwave_truly_enhance/,Does the Cuisinart CMW-100 Microwave Truly Enhance Your Kitchen Experience?,"Testing out the Cuisinart CMW-100 was like inviting a new team member into my kitchen. I use my microwave constantly—sometimes to reheat leftovers, sometimes to cook specific dishes—and having one equipped with extra features is a game-changer. Right off the bat, the stainless steel build of the Cuisinart CMW-100 didn’t just scream durability; it also looked sleek and modern on my countertop. Combining form and functionality, it’s become a centerpiece in my kitchen.

**Build and Design**  
What caught my eye immediately was how premium this microwave feels. The brushed chrome finish and stainless steel interior not only make it visually appealing but also low-maintenance. You know those splatters that seem to cook themselves onto the walls of standard microwaves? The inner steel here wipes clean effortlessly. The large chrome handle is both stylish and sturdy, adding a touch of sophistication. At 20.5 x 15.25 x 12.8 inches, it’s compact enough not to hog the counter but still offers a spacious 1-cubic-foot capacity—enough room to handle casseroles or family-sized bowls.

**Ease of Use**  
Touchpad controls with an intuitive LCD are a lifesaver—no fumbling around to figure out how to defrost chicken thighs or reheat soup. I tested its 25 preprogrammed settings and 10 power levels on everything from popcorn to salmon. This device's user-friendly configuration makes it stress-free even for those who don’t love technology. And, its rotating 12-inch glass turntable ensures equal heating, something many microwaves struggle with.

[Check Cuisinart CMW-100 price on Amazon.](https://grillsbbq.com/p/b000iw9j20/)

**Cooking Performance and Features**  
Having 1000 watts of power really makes a difference. Food warms evenly, and I especially appreciated how the two-stage cooking feature transitions seamlessly from defrosting to regular cooking. It’s such a relief for someone like me who often forgets to pull food out of the freezer ahead of time. Additionally, the eight preset options with various serving sizes are immensely helpful. I tried everything from reheating coffee to steaming vegetables, and the results were consistent and satisfying. The defrost mode offers both weight-based and time-based settings—ideal whether you're thawing a small steak or an entire roast.

**Key Benefits**  
- Stainless steel interior absorbs no odors and is easy to sanitize.  
- Versatile features like eight preset cooking options and two-stage cooking.  
- LCD touchpad makes for smooth operation.  
- 12-inch turntable ensures even heating.  

**Critiques**  
While testing, I found that the LCD itself isn’t backlit. If your kitchen lighting isn’t bright, the display can be somewhat difficult to read. Additionally, it’s worth noting the microwave is slightly heavier (33.5 pounds) than some models in its class. Not a big deal unless you need to relocate it frequently.

- Lack of backlighting on the LCD can create visibility issues.  
- Heavier than some comparable countertop microwaves.  

**Product Comparisons**  
In comparison to the Toshiba EM131A5C-BS, a similar one-cubic-foot microwave, the Cuisinart CMW-100 holds its own with its all-steel construction, whereas the Toshiba features a partial plastic exterior. The Toshiba microwave does offer sensor cooking, which the CMW-100 lacks, but I found the preset options on the Cuisinart more than sufficient for everyday needs. Against a Panasonic inverter microwave, the Cuisinart has simpler controls, making it less intimidating for a general user. If durability and ease of cleaning are your top priorities, this product absolutely shines.

**Cost Efficiency**  
For what it offers, I’d say this microwave gives excellent bang for its buck. Stainless steel construction often comes at a premium, but here it feels like you’re getting a quality appliance without overpaying. The added features like preprogrammed settings and dual defrost modes make it a practical asset, especially for busy households. While there are cheaper microwaves, the performance and sleek design make the added expense worthwhile.
