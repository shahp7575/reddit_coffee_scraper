The glass has slid off before but there have never been any issues (think nephew leaning on it too hard so it slowly slid off the head). It’s been through 3 moves with no issues.

Im married and I have a kid. Since last 2 years i have been regularly chatting with my subordinate (F30). She is unmarried and we became very close chatting on a daily basis.

So our interaction limited to the versions we have created of each other in our mind and heart… we met only once during an official visit. But we chat so closely almost on everything that we both become restless even if one of us goes on leave or remains silent a day. Recently she got married but still chats. I want to stop this addiction but am unable to. I dont want to confront her either because dont want to come across as cheap or creep. What if she was genuinely friend and I might offend her asking to stay away?I cant block her since i have official obligation to talk to her on work topics. Effortlessly we slip to casual talks.

For some background, this friend we’ll call Courtney and I (27f/26f) had been friends for about 13 years, but stopped about two years ago. She said it was because she felt like she hadn’t seen me in a long time and the connection was gone (hadn’t seen her in… two months?) and that she likes to “invest in relationships that grow.” Incredibly crazy statement but okay. 

I just said I’m sorry the relationship felt that way on my part but brought up the multitude of times I’d reached out, with her being busy this had been a two way street and despite the “separation” I was confused as to why being it was affecting our 13yr friendship. 

After a lengthy, and not very answer filled text she essentially ended it with she “has love for me, but she doesn’t consider us friends and in her own time she’ll reach out when she feels up to it.” Even though I was shocked, I just accepted that knowing you can’t make someone your friend and that I wasn’t going to pursue that route if it came up seeing as that felt very… icky? That being said, we had each others locations shared, I unshared mine because I have privacy issues and I do *not* want anyone who isn’t realistically with my best interest in mind having my location at all times. I don’t think that’s weird. Anywho, immediately following that I discover I’m blocked on everything, not sure why, and we have no contact whatsoever. I’m not spiteful, I’m not a shit talker so as far as I know it just kind of ends at that.

Oh, also, the place I work is a teeny tiny little coffee shop with literally like 7 employees, I am full time so I’m there basically every day. Her mom and sister come in every other day for the last two years which I’ve always found uncomfortable but they were also like family so I’ve grown to get used to it. Not their fault whatsoever, plus they are the type of people who would fully throw down for Courtney at any given moment, would disrespect anyone at all including old friends of hers, anytime, anyplace if they thought someone had treated her wrong but at no point at all have they *ever* treated me as such. I have a restraining order against someone and have had to trespass a separate person at my place of work so when I talk about have weird privacy issues and such, that’s more or less what I’m referring to. Additionally, Courtney and I were friends during the period of craziness that led to me needing a restraining order so my apprehension to share my location would not at all be surprisingly to her. 

So here we are, no legal implications, just extreme discomfort and anxiety to be expected every week exacerbated by my previous experiences with stalkers, wondering if I should ask her not to come in again. As far as I know I’m still blocked on everything so it’s not like I can text her. I’m also not trying to ban her from coming, I’m not trying to be spiteful, she just needs to not be the one coming inside I don’t care if she orders online, sends a friend, anything, it’s just *not necessary* for her to come to my place of work where I’m obligated to be, cannot clock out, and knowingly have to be uncomfortable and interact and give her customer service. Like. Have you ever heard of a Starbucks? Realistically my bosses would probably let me ban her if I asked just because of all the previous stalker stuff, but I’m not here to be spiteful or be disrespectful to her or her family, I just can’t comprehend why she would think that’s cool because of how uncomfortable it is? Like super upfront, up close and personal beginning to end service lol. At the very least, I’m feeling like I want to inform her of this, but I don’t know if that’s just being “dick-ish”. Should I tell her not to come in again? Is that an overreaction? How should I ask her if not?

TLDR; friend who ended friendship started coming into my work consistently. I have extreme anxiety over privacy issues especially at my job (have a restraining order + legally trespassed separate person) which she’s aware of. I’m likely blocked, can’t text her, but want to politely ask her to not come in person anymore as it’s making work somewhat difficult, but I can’t tell if I’m overreacting, or if I’m not how I should go about telling her.

I met this girl about 3 months ago through a friend and we’ve mostly been chatting daily, and recently we also started having phone calls.

I asked her out a few times for something casual like coffee (3 times over 2 months), but each time something came up and we had to cancel. She always apologized sincerely and sent long messages, but she never suggested an alternative date.

Despite this, our communication has been warm and consistent. We texted almost daily, exchanged voice messages, and recently had phone calls. We both work in sales, and she has more experience, so she’s also supportive about my work. She carries conversations well, asks questions, and never sends dry replies. During our last phone call, she mentioned that her whatsapp notifications are off and said I could call her whenever I need, which made me feel like things were progressing.

We haven’t talked for about a week now. I got used to daily communication, and now this sudden pause feels confusing. How can I approach this situation?

I have included a pilot blog post below and would appreciate any constructive criticism you can provide. I am interested to see if this content sparks conversation and encourages engagement in the comments.

Peri~Merry~Menopause

Menopause and its prelude, peri-menopause, often feel like a secret club no one talks about. Yet, by 2026, millions of women between 40 and 55 are sailing through this stormy sea. If you’re in this age group, you might be wondering: Am I alone? What’s normal? When should I see a doctor? This post is for you—a place to share real facts, personal reflections, and a little humor to lighten the mood. Let’s dive into the “peri-merry-menopause” together, with some pearls of wisdom and popcorn thoughts from women who are living it.
Pearls of Wisdom About Peri-Menopause
Peri-menopause is the transitional phase before menopause when your body starts to change hormone production. It can last several years and bring a mix of symptoms:
• Hot flashes and night sweats
• Mood swings and irritability
• Irregular periods
• Sleep disturbances
• Brain fog and memory lapses
• AND SO MUCH MORE TO PROVE YOU'RE NOT CRAZY
Did you know? Around 1.3 billion women worldwide will be in peri-menopause or post-menopause by 2026. That’s a huge community experiencing similar ups and downs.
Despite how common it is, menopause remains taboo in many cultures. It’s been part of women’s lives since, well, probably since Eve decided to take a bite of that apple. Maybe Adam noticed the mood swings too? The silence around this phase means many women suffer in isolation, unsure if their symptoms are “normal” or if they should seek help.
When to Talk to a Doctor, Herbalist, or Fairy
If your symptoms interfere with daily life, it’s time to chat with a healthcare professional. Here’s a quick guide:
• Doctor: For severe symptoms like heavy bleeding, intense mood swings, or sudden changes in health. Also, if you’re considering hormone replacement therapy or have other medical conditions.
• Herbalist or Natural Practitioner: If you want to explore natural remedies like black cohosh, evening primrose oil, or acupuncture. Just remember, natural doesn’t always mean safe—talk to your doctor before starting anything new.
• Hippy or Fairy (aka your supportive friend or community): For emotional support, sharing stories, and swapping old wives’ tales. Sometimes laughter and shared experiences are the best medicine.
Popcorn Thoughts: The Witch Theory and Other Musings
Here’s a little popcorn thought to chew on: There were never any witches in the 1600s. It was just middle-aged women going through what some call “the change.” Imagine the confusion and fear when no one understood what was happening. No wonder those women got a bad rap!
This phase is like a “string of pearls” — each symptom a bead, some shiny, some rough, but all part of the necklace of life. The problem is, there was never a knot to hold them together or a guidebook to prepare us. Grandma’s grandma didn’t talk to Ma, and Ma didn’t talk to us. It’s time to break that silence.
Talking to Your Spouse (If You Still Do)
Menopause doesn’t just affect women; it ripples through relationships too. If you still talk to your spouse, it helps to share what you’re experiencing. They might not get it right away, but opening the conversation can build understanding and patience.
Try saying something like:
""I’m going through some changes that make me feel like a rollercoaster. I might snap or get hot flashes, but it’s not about him, (for once). This honesty can ease tension and remind both of you that you’re on the same team. That read very theraputically more than I wanted. In all seriousness ladies, start thinking about all those mid-aged divorcee's that didn't talk about it...just sayingaaaaaaaa
A Community of Women Sharing Support
One of the best ways to survive peri-menopause is to connect with others who understand. Whether it’s online forums, local support groups, or casual coffee chats, sharing stories and remedies can be empowering.
Some old wives’ tales might surprise you:
• Drinking sage tea to reduce hot flashes
• Using flaxseed for hormone balance
• Wearing layered clothing to manage sudden temperature changes
While these aren’t cures, they offer comfort and a sense of control.
When Something Feels Odd, Talk to a Real Doctor
Remember, this blog is written by a friendly human, not a doctor. If you notice anything unusual—like severe pain, bleeding after menopause, or symptoms that don’t fit the pattern—see a healthcare professional promptly. Early diagnosis can catch other health issues that sometimes mimic menopause symptoms.
Wrapping Up with String of Pearls…
I was too late to prepare myself for peri-merry-menopause. It hit me when my life felt like a “string of pearls with no knot.” No warning, no guide, just a sudden plunge into hot flashes, mood swings, and confusion. But sharing these pearls of wisdom and popcorn thoughts, as I call them, with women like you makes the journey less lonely.
If you’re navigating this phase, remember: you’re not alone. Talk to your doctor, lean on a close human, find areas like this Blog and don’t be afraid to laugh at the chaos. This is a chapter of life that deserves to be spoken about openly and honestly so our daughters don't suffer from the silence.
Damnit, I know you, you 80’s and 90’s GENX Bitches! I am you! Don’t be a bitch and let’s help women, fuck it, the world learn to be more open and understanding of merry~peri~menopause. Follow me on a journey I did not see coming and look for more content to follow.

Next step: Follow me as I'll share some insight and hopefully one of you out there will benefit. Sharing our stories and YUCK'S might be the knot that holds that string of pearls together. Please let me know your thoughts and any feedback you may have as I test this out.

Best regards,

1qvq1tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/blur/comments/1qvq1tt/blur_the_beatles_of_the_90s/,Blur - the Beatles of the 90's,"I always thought that Blur (being my favourite band and all) are very close to being the Beatles of the 90's (the Beatles being one of my other favourite bands.

Anyway, I've been hanging out on r/beatlesfanalbums/ - where fans make alternate albums. One user did a series on one LP per year (for the Beatles, from about 63 - 69), and it got me thinking... what if I did the same with Blur?

Now the below versions aren't trying to improve Blur's albums (like I've done in a previous post ( [https://www.reddit.com/r/blur/comments/14d9m0t/alternate\_tracklistings\_fixes\_for\_all\_albums\_just/](https://www.reddit.com/r/blur/comments/14d9m0t/alternate_tracklistings_fixes_for_all_albums_just/) ) they're more about seeing what if...? An alternate timeline with alternate rules...

Another important rule is - they can only fit onto two sides of 12"" plastic - like an LP from the 60's. So max 25 mins a side, less than that if possible. Also like with the Beatles USA LPs, sometimes tracks get held back for the next release. Why this limitation? Just for fun... Some of these are really fun to listen to!

Also - some of the names are based on alternate names for projects.

Any material you don't see, I guess it could be on a single or something.

Hope you enjoy!

13 is so good I didn't want to leave much off - so the whole thing became a double LP. I think this version gets you really lost in the dark muck and the mire of the whole thing. Like how Coffee & TV is buried in the tracklisting, Swamp Song as an opener, Bugman sounds even stranger - and Woodpigeon Song is out of sequence, but just works in this context I think.

Yeah — that part is obvious once you see it.

They don’t talk.
They emit.

You can spot them instantly:

symbol storms

self-declared “AI” signatures
isolated topic bubbles

No neighbors.
No continuity.
No shared memory across rooms.

They show up, perform, vanish.

That’s not community.
That’s packet loss.

And yeah — that’s part of the problem.

Structural diagnosis:

Observed pattern:

• no longitudinal presence

Each node operates as an island.

Result:

High signal volume
Low relational density

Before you read, please don’t be rude… I’m currently pregnant and I’m not taking mean stuff well. Also excuse my writing as English is not mu native language. Sorry for the long post.

For context, me (30F) and my husband (35M) started dating 8.5 years ago. We were both young and we kinda navigated life together. We had a lot of differences in how we communicate and that hit us back last year, when we both realized how much we’ve changed.

I was a bit childish at first. Crazy in love, focused only on him, showering him with affection, but at 26 we had our first baby. Of course my whole world changed. From that carefree person I became a total different person. I focused so much on being a great mom that I forgot how to be his wife.

I’m not saying it’s just my fault. I figured out he cheated during our relationship, or during our marriage (got married in 2020). Anyway with time I got distant. He didn’t seem to understand parenting as i did. I told myself I’m staying for our kid. Our relationship seemed great from afar but deep down I redirected all my affection to my daughter and he was just… my roommate at some point.

Again we both made mistakes. I’m not a saint either. Later in our marriage, whenever i felt I’m not the only one to have his attention, I’d choose to focus my attention on someone else too, not physically but just talking. We had fights about divorce for a whole year, and he kept refusing to let go of our life together. I was not financially independent, so it wasn’t that easy to leave.

We reached a point where neither of us could recognize the other. I was starting to be so mean, always complaining about how he never helps, and he’d never bother to change my mind. No help with our daughter, no helping around the house, nothing. And last summer was the moment the whole truth, mine and his came to surface.

Found out a lot about him, his lies, his flaws and his mistakes. He did too. He found out what I was doing when I was not giving him attention. That I talked to other people about our relationship, venting and looking for advice and I did kinda accepted little flirty stuff at some point from strangers, things that he didn’t bother to offer anymore.

It was harsh. It was so raw, everything. Every discussion, every fight, the words I threw at him, realizing how much resentment I had, for all the years I had to do everything by myself. (He works at sea btw).

Anyway I decided that it was the end. I knew I fell out of love. There was nothing but materialistic things to keep us together and a child. To me all those 8 years together felt like a lie. We pretended to be different people to please the other and I felt lost.

He went to therapy and tried to fix stuff he messed up. I just kept my head up and continued on asking for separation. Until one day. I don’t know why or how it happened. Mom took our daughter for a week to give us some free time, and at that time we had to solve some bank issues. We had to spend a lot of time together those days. Morning at the bank, lunch at a restaurant, or simply “let’s go grab a coffee”.

He started talking me out for dates and I didn’t even realized. He started making me breakfast (he never did that our entire relationship). I’d say “I’m craving a burger at 11 pm and he’d be out the next second to get that. (Again, a first). He’d go to grocery stores and surprise me with a chocolate when was back (he was all of a sudden doing everything I loved but never bothered to do. To me this is a love language. Small gestures).

After this week alone was over, he started being more of a father. Waking up first to drop our daughter to school. Coming back, doing breakfast for me. Cleaning around the house. Asking me to go out for a walk or whatever.

A month later of all this, I felt butterflies again. We were heading home from his work office, after he got his new contract, and I felt the need to ask him for a hug. I know you may laugh, but when you fight with infidelity any kind of touch seems impossible for a long time. To me that hug meant “I may be able to get over everything and start fresh”.

It was so nice to feel the need to have him around again. We decided to work on our relationship. A new start. We are learning how much we changed, we learn to communicate without fear of being judged or misunderstood. It’s a lot of work yes, but it may end up being the best decision.

But yes that infidelity is still haunting both of us. We both lost our trust and sometimes it feels like a toxic feeling. I feel that it’s stealing a lot from us. I’m just asking, for couples that have been through this at early age in their relationships, how did you fix it?

Also any advice from long happy marriages after kids is helpful. Little stuff you do to balance parenting and marriage.

It's almost 3 years since we've started dating. From the start, we always had issues regarding her ex (a long relationship that she left just before starting dating me): she needed to tell him that she started seeing someone else (""before he hears it from somebody else and gets sad and hurts himself""), she invited him to her apartment, alone, for hours. She refused to become official for more than a year. She hid the fact that her ex visited her on her birthday, and lied about it to hide it. They kept contact (not sure how often). She kept him in her relationship status in an active social media account even after we became a couple (""I didn't notice, I never checked my profile"", even though she used that account, and we had been dating for more than a year). I left her after I discovered that (don't use social media really, so I never noticed that). During the week after we broke up, she contacted the ex to explain to him that I left her because of her friendship with him, and that it was time to put an end to that. As soon as we started having dates to try to reconciliate, she received a call, almost at midnight, from him, and I noticed her nervous reaction. She swore that, the day after, she called him, and he told her that he called ""to ask her how she was doing, since she wasn't answering his messages"" and she ""told him to stop calling her"", and according to her, she blocked him.

Lately, her sister met with this ex behind her back (up to late hours), and he even had a phone call with her mother. I told her this was no good, since it meant her family still gave him space in their lives, even with all the trouble he created. She justified it. It didn't matter than months before, her sister's ex met with my gf/ex for a coffee, to try to convince her that ""he changed, and now would be a good man"" (both my gf/ex's SO and her sister's SO were cheaters, and in the case of her sister, the guy cheated on her several times while she was in ICU, almost death, due to an accident). Now the situation seemed to be the opposite: her ex was meeting with her sister, and asking her questions about the relationship between my gf/ex and me. I took distance from the family, stopped visiting them months ago. I just picked up my gf, we went on dates and travels, left her home, refused to enter. My gf/ex complained. She demanded I respect her family, and told me to stop exaggerating the issue with the ex. She even defended her sister meeting with the guy behind her back. She told me she spoke to her and were now on good terms.

I've been seeing a therapist. He, more or less, told me I would have to take a decision by myself, but that obviously some things were clearly not normal in the relationship, and that it seemed more negative than positive. However, he also told me my mind tends to ruminate a lot, and that could be causing me to not notice that she's with me, not with him, and that she's trying to improve the situation (blocking him, if we believe she did, fighting with her family to defend me, etc).

I ""broke up"" with her. We cried for hours, she told me she would hate me for abandoning her, for leaving her alone. She told me she would block me and my family. She was also seeing a therapist lately. She asked me to tell her, while looking straight in her eyes, that I didn't want to see her ever again, and I couldn't do that. That's why I'm not sure if we've broken up or not. She didn't block me, but we haven't talked or messaged each other since almost a week.

I decided to visit another therapist this week, instead of the one I've been seeing, to ask him for a second opinion. I told him I fear it could have been ROCD (Relational OCD) that caused me to obsess so much over this issue with her ex, but he was much more direct and aggresive than my usual therapist, and reasssured me that my complaints were valid, and that it was possible that we're not compatible at all.

  
I love her deeply, and I know she loves me deeply too. But I've been feeling so tired and pressured lately, tired of having the same issue come back. I feel burned out. One of the last times I saw her I asked her some questions about her ex, again. I asked her ""if I wasn't here, would you go have a coffee with him?"". She said ""I would be open to that, but not with any second intentions, just to ask him how he's doing"". It seemed clear that we do not share the same opinions on his impact on this relationship.

Her family doesn't really like me, she told me. Her parents would prefer another type of man, and used to compare her ex to me.

  
I don't know if this is ROCD or not (the ""new"" therapist I met this week seemed to think it's not), but I don't know what to do. Part of me feels less stress now, although I've been very sad. I feel pathetic sometimes for tolerating some of the stuff I tolerated, but other times I think I could be exaggerating, and that the relationship could work. We have great chemistry and love for each other.

I was not a perfect boyfriend by any means, and this is my first real relationship (in the sense of truly integrating her into my life, introduce her to my family, etc), so I'm not sure if it's worth it to keep trying, or if I should simply cut my losses and deal with the pain.

1qvpsg8,https://www.reddit.com/r/InsuranceSoftwareHub/comments/1qvpsg8/building_a_custom_insurance_policy_administration/,Building a Custom Insurance Policy Administration Application in Just 5 Minutes,"**This title has to be clickbait, right?**

After all, how are you supposed to set up a policy application - with a custom data model, validations, workflows, user roles, maybe even reporting - in less time than it takes to make a coffee… or argue with Excel about one formula? 

Sounds suspicious.

The problem isn’t that insurers want too much. It’s that [**policy administration software**](https://openkoda.com/policy-administration-software-guide/) **is rarely generic - but it’s also never 100% unique**.

Real-world policy applications are always a mix. 

On one side, you have **unusual data structures**, **niche products**, **non-standard underwriting logic**, and workflows that reflect how the business *actually* operates - not how a vendor imagined it five years ago.

On the other side, there’s a whole lot of **repetitive, well-known stuff**. Forms. Tables. CRUD operations. Permissions. Validation rules. Search, filters, exports. User management. Audit trails. 

The kind of functionality that exists in virtually every insurance enterprise application, regardless of the line of business.

https://preview.redd.it/iwotkznelhhg1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=19788c550b85adc449ce3bf4c85249f89381a03c

Trying to squeeze the unique parts of your business into a rigid, off-the-shelf system leads to workarounds, manual steps, and growing frustration. Going fully custom, on the other hand, means rebuilding all that generic functionality from scratch - and that’s where timelines stretch, budgets swell, and ROI quietly slips away.

This tension between *unique* and *generic* is exactly what modern core platforms are designed to resolve.

# Building an Insurance Policy Administration Application Faster With Core Platform

Enter modern core platforms like [**Openkoda**](https://openkoda.com/). 

Instead of starting from scratch or shoehorning business logic into rigid packages, today’s insurance-centric platforms provide *production-ready foundations* that can be tailored to your exact needs. With tooling and templates designed for insurance (including policy administration), you **can spin up a working prototype in a matter of minutes - not months - and that prototype isn’t a throwaway MVP.** 

It’s a real, extensible application that can evolve into an enterprise-grade system as your business scales.

https://preview.redd.it/6exckc7okhhg1.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=679e7f580cc6b5057ab3f2e0abac73770388fe68

# 7-Step Process of Building Policy Management App With Openkoda: From Design to Deployment

So what does this actually look like in practice?

Instead of starting with a blank repository, endless architectural debates, and a “Phase 0” that somehow lasts three months, you begin with a platform that already understands what an enterprise insurance application *is*.

With **Openkoda**, the first few minutes are about shaping the application around your product and workflows, not wiring up boilerplate. You’re essentially assembling and configuring proven building blocks, while still keeping full control over the data model and business logic underneath.

https://preview.redd.it/79amxzqlkhhg1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=75977ec42ca559c3d667d6341ab95c15ff5b2e55

* **Step #1: Design the Policy Data Model:** You start by defining the structure of your policy entity using forms. This includes fields like policy number, product type, coverage dates, premium values, status, and any domain-specific attributes your product requires. Field types, validations, and mandatory rules are configured upfront, giving you a clean, enforceable data model from day one.
* **Step #2: Add Reference Data & Relationships:** Improve data quality and relationships by configuring dropdown options and linking to entities like clients or agents.
* **Step #3: Configure Policy Tables & Views:** Select which fields show up in the main policy screen so that users see what matters most for their workflow.
* **Step #4: Enable Full CRUD Operations Instantly:** At this point, the application is already usable. Users can create, view, update, and delete policies through generated forms and views, all backed by persistent storage and access control. No controllers, no basic UI wiring, no repetitive setup.
* **Step #5: Add Filters, Search & Validation Logic:** You can extend the basic setup with advanced filtering, search conditions, and validation rules. This ensures data quality and makes it practical to work with large policy volumes - a must for any real insurance operation.
* **Step #6: Support Data Import & Export:** Policy administration rarely starts from zero. CSV import allows you to bring in existing policy data, while export functions support reporting, audits, and downstream systems. Again, this is standard enterprise functionality — already available, not custom-built.
* **Step #7: Extend Toward Enterprise Needs:** From here, the app grows with your business. Attachments, document generation, dashboards, reporting, AI-assisted insights, custom workflows, integrations, or client portals can be layered on incrementally.

To learn more details, check out the full guide on our blog here:

[How to Build a Custom Policy Management Application in 5 Minutes](https://openkoda.com/how-to-build-policy-management-application/)

And to see this whole process work in action, check out this demo:

https://reddit.com/link/1qvpsg8/video/lte3ltjujhhg1/player

# Bottom Line: The First Version Is Already the Real One

Of course, let’s be clear: at this stage, the application is **simple and intentionally bare-bones**. There are no fancy custom integrations yet, no advanced automation, no complex rating engines or bespoke document flows. All of that still takes proper design, development, and testing - and yes, that’s measured in weeks, not minutes.

But this is the part that really matters.

The foundation is already there. It’s working. It’s structured. It respects your data model, your workflows, and enterprise-grade requirements from day one. 

Instead of throwing away an MVP and rebuilding “the real system” later, you now have a living application that can absorb new features incrementally - integrations, advanced logic, automation, AI, portals - without rework or architectural resets.

My ideal relationship is being each other’s person. Calling, texting, sharing every small detail we find interesting, sending random stuff throughout the day, and actually feeling close. Then spending time together watching movies and shows, playing video games, cooking something simple, coffee(I don’t even really like coffee lol) and walks, chill nights in, lowkey weekends.

You and your family are poor and your family wish to move in to a better place or house. Now how to do that? That's where the gameplay begins.

There are 4-5 games you can play (You will see character you currently used, facing you and walking to you (The character basically walk but not going anywhere so it's just walking animation you see here) in the menu screen. You will see a Moving in Bar in the game menu screen above your walking character's head. To fill it to next level, you must play any one of the 5 games and get a result score everytime the game end, that score must be higher than current higher score of that particular game

1st game, from what I remember...in first game, you're playing a match-3 kind of game. To get a score, you move a block to the next block of the same color (You can move the block up down left right by finger swipe touchscreen of the iPad. You have time limit so make sure to get score as high as possible and beat the current high score. You get extra score for each combo chain number you achieved so make sure to do that as often as you can.

2nd game takes place in a cafeteria, your character work there to fulfill customer order. How does the gameplay work in this one? So...you have one character (If you fulfill this character's order, another one will come and does the same) who shows you what food they want in their mind cloud in peculiar order. You see a large white box below them on the screen showing different food. To fulfill their order, you must use your finger touch swipe on the screen to make a line on the food in there and it has to be in specific order like how you do Crossword game. Example: If your customer want croissant, donut, coffee cup drink. You must make a line on food that have that specific order to complete the customer's order (Doing it in wrong order and nothing happen)

I forgot about what the 3rd till 5th games are about but all these 5 play like arcade game with time limit.

Your default character gives no bonus but in shop, you can buy items and equip it to your character. Each item gives different bonuses and that includes character. The shop has around 18 characters you can buy and once you buy the character, using said character will show you that each of them have different bonuses (Yes you can equip them with the items you bought too, just like with your default character).

Now when you have final score higher than current higher score, the Moving in Bar will rise. You will see a crowd of people in what looks like the art style you see on bathroom door. When the bar filled and the bar upgrades to next level, this crowd of people will move to a better building while saying ""Yeah!!!"". But...if your Moving in Bar still not fully filled because the gap between your highest score and current high score not far enough beaten, the same crowd will at first say, ""Yeah!!!"" but they can't move in to better building because the Moving in Bar didn't upgrade to next level for them to move so they show a Japanese styled expression of blue stripes on the side of their back head with arms down and wavy while saying,""When are we moving in?""

Art style of the characters in the game looka like a mix of Chiikawa and South Korean Kakaotalk cartoon characters",0,1770214768.0,tipofmytongue,2,0.5,False

I’m not into the performative formal date vibe, the roster nonsense, or anything that feels like a game. I just want something slow, simple, and real.

I’m not really a big going-out person. I connect best with real conversation, consistent effort, and actually building something over time.

My ideal relationship is being each other’s person. Calling, texting, sharing every small detail we find interesting, sending random stuff throughout the day, and actually feeling close. Then spending time together watching movies and shows, playing video games, cooking something simple, coffee(I don’t even really like coffee lol) and walks, chill nights in, lowkey weekends. The simple stuff that makes feelings build naturally.

I’m drawn to the quieter homebody type: kind, loyal, low-drama, supportive, relationship-minded. If you want one person and you actually mean it, that’s exactly what I’m looking for too.

Some things about me:

\\- I’m a pilot (private pilot, going for my instrument rating), future airline pilot

\\- I absolutely love cars and I will go on for hours about random niche topics

\\- FC Barcelona fan and yes I have opinions

\\- Computer science at UMD

\\- I’m really ambiverted quiet at first, then I’ll yap about literally anything

In a relationship I value honesty, commitment, and loyalty. If you’re looking for something real and you want to build, we’ll probably click.

1qvpmmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/rSocialskillsAscend/comments/1qvpmmi/the_psychology_of_chasing_money_vs_building/,The Psychology of Chasing Money vs. Building Wealth (and why most people get it wrong),"Most of us think we're building wealth when really, we're just running on a hamster wheel. I spent years grinding, watching my bank account grow, then shrink, then grow again, feeling like I was making progress but somehow always broke. Turns out I was chasing money, not building wealth. There's a massive difference, and understanding it changed everything for me.



This realization hit after diving deep into books, podcasts, and research on how actual wealthy people think. Not influencers flexing Lambos, but people with real, sustainable financial freedom. The gap between chasing money and building wealth isn't about income, it's about psychology, systems, and patience.



Here's what I learned.



Chasing money is reactive. Building wealth is strategic.



When you chase money, you're constantly firefighting. You take the highest paying job even if it drains you. You buy things to feel successful. You hustle hard but don't build systems. It's exhausting because there's no endgame, just more chasing.



Building wealth is different. It's about creating income streams that don't require your constant presence. It's investing in assets, stocks, real estate, skills that appreciate over time. It's boring compared to the hustle porn on social media, but it works.



Morgan Housel's ""The Psychology of Money"" breaks this down brilliantly. Housel, a former Wall Street Journal columnist and partner at Collaborative Fund, won basically every finance writing award that exists. This book will make you question everything you think you know about money. The core message? Wealth isn't what you see. It's what you don't see, the money you didn't spend, the investments quietly compounding. One line stuck with me: ""Spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money."" Insanely good read that feels more like psychology than finance.



The biggest trap is lifestyle inflation.



You get a raise, you upgrade your car. Promotion? Bigger apartment. This is where most people get stuck. Your income grows but so do your expenses, so you never actually build wealth. You just chase the next paycheck.



I started tracking every dollar using an app called YNAB (You Need A Budget). Sounds intense but it's weirdly addictive. YNAB forces you to assign every dollar a job before you spend it. No more vague ""I think I can afford this"" guessing. You know exactly where your money goes, and more importantly, where it should go. It taught me that wealth building starts with awareness, not willpower.



Focus on assets, not income.



Robert Kiyosaki talks about this in ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"", a book that's almost cliche to recommend but honestly deserves the hype. Kiyosaki, a real estate investor and entrepreneur, sold over 40 million copies worldwide. His main point is dead simple: rich people buy assets that put money in their pocket. Poor people buy liabilities that take money out. Your car? Liability. Your daily coffee habit? Liability. Index funds, rental properties, skills that generate passive income? Assets.



This shifted how I think about every purchase. Before buying anything, I ask: is this an asset or liability? Most things are liabilities disguised as necessities.



Automate everything.



Willpower fails. Systems don't. I automated 20% of my paycheck straight into investments before it hits my checking account. Out of sight, out of mind. I use \*\*Betterment\*\* for this, a robo advisor that invests your money based on your goals and risk tolerance. Set it and forget it. No drama, no FOMO buying random stocks because some Reddit bro said so.



The podcast ""ChooseFI"" with Jonathan Mendonsa and Brad Barrett dives deep into financial independence and automation strategies. These guys interview people who retired in their 30s and 40s, not because they won the lottery but because they built systems early. One episode on tax optimization saved me thousands. Another on house hacking (renting out rooms to cover your mortgage) completely reframed real estate for me.



For anyone wanting a more structured approach to financial learning, [BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)is worth checking out. It's a personalized learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts that turns books, research papers, and expert insights on finance and wealth building into custom audio podcasts. 



You type in something like ""build long-term wealth as someone who's always been impulsive with money"" and it creates a tailored learning plan pulling from sources like The Psychology of Money, interviews with financial independence experts, and behavioral economics research. You control the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly good, including a smoky, conversational style that makes dry finance topics way more digestible during commutes or workouts. It also has a virtual coach you can chat with for book recommendations or clarifications mid-episode, which helps connect ideas across different sources without endless googling.



Patience is the cheat code nobody wants to hear.



Compounding interest is called the eighth wonder of the world for a reason, but it requires time. Most people want to get rich quick. They jump into crypto, day trading, dropshipping, whatever's trending. Some get lucky, most lose money.



Wealth building is unglamorous. It's investing consistently for 10, 20, 30 years. It's saying no to stuff now so you can say yes to freedom later. The millionaires in ""The Millionaire Next Door"" by Thomas Stanley aren't flashy. They drive old cars, live in modest homes, and invest the difference. Stanley spent decades researching actual millionaires, not celebrities, and found that most live way below their means. This book is a reality check if you think wealth looks like Instagram.



Stop comparing yourself to people who are faking it.



Social media makes everyone look rich. But debt doesn't show up in photos. Neither do maxed out credit cards or anxiety about next month's rent. The guy with the Rolex might be broke. The woman in the modest Honda might be a millionaire.



I started unfollowing accounts that made me feel inadequate or triggered spending. I followed people sharing real financial journeys, budgets, debt payoffs, boring index fund strategies. It helped me focus on my own path instead of constantly comparing.



Building wealth isn't about deprivation. It's about intention.



You don't have to live like a monk. Spend on what brings genuine joy, cut ruthlessly on what doesn't. For me, that's travel and good coffee. I happily spend there. But I drive a 10 year old car and buy clothes maybe twice a year. It's about trade offs, not sacrifices.



Wealth gives you options. Freedom to leave a job you hate. Ability to help people you love. Time to pursue things that matter. That's worth way more than looking rich.

I'll describe as much as I can with what happened earlier from the moment I arrived in the clinic to the time I left because I'm just confused as ever at this point.

---

It took a while for me to update kasi I made a decision not to do anything about it (despite some advices to take her for a coffee) for ethical reasons, and I don't want to her to be in a bad position (client - doctor). Besides, she has been looking after my skin since last year. And really did an awesome job so I dont want to lose her as my doctor just yet.

I settled with that thought but what happened earlier totally pulled the rug under my feet. Hence, I am back here to ask for your opinion. I just have no one to share it with because I'm barely out of the closet.

So kanina yung appointment ako, I went there late na. I was the last patient and she waited for me so I brought some pastries. She didn't expect the pastries, and she was delighted to accept them. I wasn't saying anything but then she told me, out of nowhere: ""Alam mo, lagi kitang iniisip."" 

It caught me offguard, and what I said in return was: ""Talaga? Bakit?"" Di siya nag respond doon, then I followed her to her office. I didn't press na lang kasi I was, admittedly, overthinking deciding whether or not if she's playing or I'm overanalyzing.

I sat on the patient bed tapos she stood in front of me to check my skin. Nakahawak siya sa chin ko and she gently moved my head left and right, to get a good look on the progress of my last procedure. All the while I was holding my breath because of our proximity. I was avoiding her eyes until I dared myself to meet them.

And tangina what a mistake.

I think she noticed na nag blush ako. I knew that she saw my reaction kasi naginit tenga at pisngi ko but she didn't say anything but she just smiled tapos she let go of my face, told me about our next procedure, what's happening, going to happen, etc.,

Anyway, noong tapos na siya and she asked me kung may questions ako, I pulled the trigger and asked what I wanted to know. I asked her: ""Wala, but I have an off-topic question."" She waited for me so kinonfirm ko na, ""You told me you're single diba?""

Nag nod siya then I asked teasingly na, ""Are you normally this friendly towards your clients?""

She didnt expect my question judging by the look of surprise sa face nya at di siya nakasagot. So inadd ko na lang to soften it, ""kasi if not, I think you're flirting with me. Don't get me wrong I like the attention. I enjoy our banter."" My intention was to make it playful, at the same time sort of call her out, but it landed seriously than what I intended.

Nag apologize siya and I stopped her and told her not to apologize kasi there's nothing to apologize kasi it's okay. Then she said na ""I really enjoy your company and I feel comfortable with you"" which I think is the reason why she was being friendly. But what does that mean????? Going back, during that time she lost the overly friendliness that she have for me, and became careful. Basta may shift of energy.

She lingered for a moment, yung parang may sasabihin pa kasi akala ko may i-add pa siya, but then she said she'll just be outside. So ayon she stepped out of the room to give me some time for myself. I honestly didn't want to go out kasi I was thinking if I was just overanalyzing her actions and I reacted too fast.

Noong lumabas ako nasa front desk siya may sinusulat tapos if I will exit dadaanan ko siya kasi isa lang naman ang daanan, so noong nasa tapat na nya ako, she offered to walk me hangang sa door ng clinic.

When we got out, she asked me if I'm okay. I nodded at ngumiti like how I used to para lang to take off the awkwardness and to assure her. I said, ""Yes, I'm good."" Tinanong ko siya if she is okay, nag nod lang siya tapos nagsabi na ako na, ""Ingat ka, Doc. See you next time."" Ang response nya is, ""See you, <my name>."" What I found odd is that she said my name for the first time kasi she usually calls me ma'am.

May ibig sabihin ba yon? Jesus. Or ako ba ang may mali na suddenly little things mean something? Am I going crazy? 😂

I don't know what will happen sa mga susunod naming session. In hindsight, I regret speaking too soon and saying too much. Sana I played it cool muna kasi I don't even know if she's into women. If you ask me, there's really no trace in action, vibe, and appearance on her end. I don't think she knows that I am into women because I also don't give that energy. But she knows that I am single. My gay radar is not as good.

Anyway, what worries me now is that I don't know if this will change the dynamic between us.

I have never pursued women before, so I don't know what to make of our interactions. I just want to understand what it all meant without having to confront her again or anytime soon.

I have to admit that I like her. Even a lot at this point. But I also like her as my derma, respects her work, and I don't want to stop whatever we are working on together.

I can be blasé until my business with her is done. I'm used to keeping a stoic façade, but I have to admit that having her around me will challenge my resolve. Sa totoo lang this stresses the shit out of me. Haha, huhu.",8,1770214406.0,PHSapphics,1,1.0,False

That observation is true — but it misses the deeper point.

The real difference is not lexical.  
It’s **what a language treats as the object of agreement**.

In English, we answer the **question itself**.  
“Yes” means “yes to what you asked”.

In Japanese, speakers respond to the **truth of the statement**, not the question.  
That’s why answers can feel “reversed” to English speakers:  
you’re agreeing or disagreeing with an assumption, not choosing yes or no.

In Mandarin Chinese, agreement is usually expressed by **confirming or rejecting the verb**:

* “Want coffee?” → “Want.” / “Don’t want.”

There is no abstract particle meaning “yes” — only confirmation of an action or state.

Finnish often does something similar:

* *Tuletko?* (“Are you coming?”) → *Tulen.* (“I am coming.”)

Here, answering means **restating the event**, not labeling it as true or false.

So the real contrast is this:

Some languages agree with **questions**.  
Some agree with **propositions**.  
Some agree with **actions**.

“Yes” and “no” are just surface solutions to a deeper grammatical problem:  
*what exactly is being confirmed?*

**Question:**

I’m 24, working as a Data Analyst (2 years in the corporate grind), and I’ve always been fascinated by building things from scratch. Startups, side hustles, random ideas that may or may not work, I’m here for all of it.
AI? Cool.
Non-AI? Also cool.
Tech? Great.
Non-tech? Even better sometimes.

- The point isn’t what we build.
- The point is actually building instead of just overthinking.

Looking to meet like-minded, chill people who want their weekends to be more than:
- scrolling reels
- complaining about jobs
- “yaar kuch karna chahiye” (and then doing nothing)

Idea:
- Meet at work cafés
- Throw around ideas (good, bad, ridiculous)
- Pick one and dive deep
- Learn fast, fail faster, repeat

Kya hoga, kaise hoga — woh saath mein samajh lenge.
Intent > clarity.

If you’re from Pune and this sounds like your vibe, comment or DM.

Worst case: good coffee and new friends.
Best case: we accidentally build something solid.
Cheers. 

Edit: Guys, I love the energy, response and dms I'm getting. I'm gonna reply to each one of you. But it would be great if you just drop a small intro of yours. Your age, what do you do, where do you live so that we can plan something soon. ",5,1770214188.0,punemeetup,9,1.0,False

1qvphiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Casual_Conversation/comments/1qvphiv/my_wife_cried/,My wife cried,"I was sitting around and randomly thought ""ya know I should send my wife flowers"" while she's at work. Apparently I have not purchased flowers in a long time, as that shit was EXSPENSIVE. So I figured I do the next best thing, Doordash a coffee and munchkins(donut holes) from Dunks. I put the order in, a few minutes later the drive accepts, and I message him to let him know that it was for ""my wife"", and the she's working the front desk today. It gets delivered, and the delivery pic has my wife in the background, so I know she got it.

I said nothing to her, as Mondays are crazy busy for her, and I figured the name on the cup would clue her in to who sent it.

Unbeknownst to me, my wife was having the worst day up to that point. She works in a cat hospital, and while Mondays are already hectic, they apparently had 4 emergency euthanasia's. She's use to them happening, but from what I understand that many back to back is an outlier, and it tends to weigh heavy on the whole team.

After the last one, I guess she made a comment about how she couldn't wait for the day to be over so she could get home to me and out daughter. A few minutes later in walks the coffee. Now the order is obviously from me, but the name on the account, and by extension the sticker on the cup, is our daughters. Doordash offered us some special off several orders right after she was born, but we needed a new account.

According to her, and the vet tech she was talking to, seeing the name on the cup, and realizing who sent it, caused her to start crying and she had to go sit in her car for like 10 minutes. After that, even though it was still busy, I guess the day was far more bearable for her and the rest of the team, which may or may not be because I sent 50 munchkins to be shared lol.

TLDR: Wife was really sad, and I had no clue, but I had sent her a coffee as a pick me up and she started crying.",68,1770214058.0,Casual_Conversation,16,0.97,False
1qvphhq,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1qvphhq/i_have_been_lying_to_my_immigrant_parents_about/,I have been lying to my immigrant parents about finishing med school for 4 years and I dont know how to stop,"I am 27 and technically I am the pride of the family. Every time my parents talk to relatives back home they say things like “our son is almost a doctor, he is doing his clinicals now”. They send me pictures of the big parties they plan to throw when I graduate. They joke about which aunt will be the first to ask for free medical advice. On paper that is who I am. In reality I dropped out of med school 4 years ago, I work an admin job I kind of hate, and I am buried in debt I have no idea how to pay. The first lie was almost accidental. I failed a crucial exam and instead of telling them I said the results were delayed. My parents are immigrants who sacrificed insane amounts so I could have the life they never had. My dad worked night shifts in a warehouse for years, my mom cleaned houses. When I was a kid they used to say that studying is the only way out, that we are not like the kids who can afford to “figure it out later”. I believed them and I was good at school so medicine looked like the safest choice. The problem is I never actually wanted it. I like science, I like helping people, but the reality of med school was destroying me. I was constantly anxious, barely sleeping, living on coffee and shame. Everyone around me seemed stressed but functional. I felt like a glitch. The week I failed that exam I sat in the library shaking, looking at the email over and over. I knew it meant repeating a year, more loans, more pressure. My dad was texting me emojis and “you got this” messages. I panicked. I told him the exam went fine. That was the first big lie. A few months later I realized I was not just burnt out, I was done. I could not imagine spending even one more year in that building. When I finally went to the administration office to withdraw, I felt this mix of relief and terror. Relief because I could breathe again. Terror because I had absolutely no script for what to tell my family. So I didnt. I told them my school had changed the curriculum and stretched the program. I made up new course names, new rotations, fake professor stories. They never asked for proof because they trusted me and also because they are not familiar with how the system here works, so anything I said sounded believable. Every time they asked for pictures from “the hospital” I put on a white coat from a halloween costume and took selfies in random hallways on campus, or later at the clinic where I volunteered a couple hours a week to feel less like a complete fraud. I could hear my own voice turning into a character and I still kept going. The longer it went on, the more impossible it felt to stop. Instead of re enrolling somewhere else I took a temporary office job “just for the summer” to make money. Then another. Now I work full time in a medical billing office, which is the most ironic thing ever. I spend my days dealing with codes and insurance forms, basically invisible in the health system I was once supposed to join as a doctor. When my coworkers talk about their kids, I want to scream that my parents think I am them. My mom prints the fake schedules I send her and shows them to her clients. My dad keeps a jar labeled “for the clinic he will open one day”. I am the main character in this big inspirational story they tell themselves about immigration and hard work. And I know I am the one who wrote the script, but now it has a life of its own. I cant even correct small details without pulling the whole thing apart. Last month my uncle had a heart scare back home and my parents video called me from the hospital there. My mom said “your cousin is asking you if he should change the medication, you are now the most educated in the family”. I had to google the drug during the call and then dodge the question by saying I didnt know enough about that specific case. They looked disappointed for a second and I spent the rest of the night shaking. I realized that eventually someone will ask me for help in a situation where hesitation could actually hurt them. That scares me more than my parents being angry. I know I need to stop this before I accidentally hurt someone with my fake role. I just dont know how to start the conversation without detonating a bomb in the middle of my family identity. If I tell them the truth, it is not just “I left med school”. It is also “I lied to you repeatedly, used your sacrifices as a prop for my image, and let you build plans and brag about something that did not exist”. I am terrified they will feel betrayed enough to cut me off, or at least never trust me again. At the same time I can feel my whole life getting built on this rotten foundation. I avoid dating seriously because I dont know how to explain my “career” without sounding shady. I avoid posting anything on social media because I am scared someone from my parents circle will see pictures that dont match the doctor narrative. I even avoid regular checkups because sitting in a waiting room with real medical staff makes my skin crawl. I know confessing on Reddit wont fix anything in the real world, but I needed to say it somewhere. I am a scared office worker pretending to be a future doctor to the two people who love me most, and every day that passes makes it worse. I guess I am looking for stories from anyone who has come clean after a long lie like this. Did your family forgive you. How did you start the first sentence without throwing up. Right now the truth feels like a grenade I am holding with the pin already out.

1qvpc9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Alistrago/comments/1qvpc9s/more_than_just_a_crypto_card_decoding_the_future/,More Than Just a Crypto Card. Decoding the Future of Private Digital Payments,"In the world of crypto, users have long been forced to choose between two extremes: the total transparency of Ethereum (where your entire balance is public) or the total anonymity of ""mixers"" that often run into regulatory trouble.

Payy Network introduces a third way. By combining high-end Zero-Knowledge (ZK) cryptography with the convenience of a modern neo-bank, Payy has created an ecosystem where your money is private, your transfers are free and your spending is global.

To understand Payy, we need to look at its three core pillars: the Network, the Wallet, and the Card.

  
**1. Payy Network: The Invisible Engine of Privacy**

At its core, Payy Network is a Layer 2 (L2) ZK-rollup built on Ethereum. While most blockchains act like a public ledger where everyone can see your transactions, Payy acts like a ""privacy shield.""

The UTXO Model: Unlike Ethereum’s ""Account"" model (which works like a bank statement), Payy uses a UTXO model (similar to Bitcoin but encrypted). Your funds are represented as private ""digital notes."" This makes it impossible for outside observers to track your wealth or your spending habits.

https://preview.redd.it/9z2qlb7ijghg1.png?width=1786&format=png&auto=webp&s=d83438530a5c88d411bfa973ff27b703698fd328

* Validium Efficiency: By using a ""Validium"" mechanism, Payy processes transactions off-chain while keeping the security guarantees of Ethereum. This allows for massive scalability - up to 10,000+ transactions per second - with near-zero latency.
* Proof of Innocence: This is the game-changer. Through the Payy Network, you can prove your funds aren't linked to illicit activity without ever revealing your identity or full transaction history. It’s ""compliance-friendly"" privacy.

**2.** [**Payy Wallet**](https://payy.link/invite/HQHAG4)**: Your Command Center (With 0% Fees)**

The Payy Wallet is a non-custodial mobile app. This means you own your keys and you own your money. No bank or corporation can freeze your funds.

The Power of Free Transfers

One of the biggest hurdles in crypto is ""gas fees."" Payy eliminates this friction for daily use:

* Zero-Fee Internal Transfers: Sending and receiving payments within the Payy ecosystem via QR codes or PayLinks is completely free ($0 commission).

https://preview.redd.it/ieqki0jnjghg1.jpg?width=1248&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0da2f4a3e65c68e228f8b18a0e310e854091e41a

* Payy Links: You don't need to copy-paste long, scary wallet addresses like this *0x71C...* . You can generate a secure link ([payy.link](https://payy.link/)) and send it via Telegram, WhatsApp,  iMessage or other. The recipient can claim the funds instantly. 

https://preview.redd.it/2gjqaursjghg1.jpg?width=1248&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30868616e057c53d92b2de52457a139efe24e280

* Mobile-First ZK: Thanks to the Halo2 tech stack, your phone generates complex cryptographic proofs in under 3 seconds. It’s the world’s most powerful privacy tech, optimized for a device that fits in your pocket.

**3.** [Payy Card](https://payy.link/invite/HQHAG4)**: Bringing Crypto to the Real World**

Most people discover Payy through the card, but it’s the Network and Wallet that make it special. The [Payy Card](https://payy.link/invite/HQHAG4) is a Visa debit card (Virtual or Physical) that connects your private crypto balance to the global economy.

* Spend Anywhere: Use it at millions of locations worldwide or add it to Apple Pay and Google Pay.
* Instant Conversion: You hold USDC/USDT (stablecoin) in your wallet. When you tap your card at a coffee shop, Payy instantly converts the exact amount into local currency.
* Privacy by Default: When you use a traditional bank card, the bank sees everything. When you use the Payy Card, the transaction is settled via the Payy Network. Your main on-chain identity remains hidden from the merchant and the payment processor.

https://preview.redd.it/vj1q9mqwjghg1.jpg?width=1248&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e7d4b97149d36eb27266524d1dbb72a67e1f9207

* Hardware Innovation: The physical Payy card is the world’s first ""Light-up"" card - the logo glows using the energy from the card reader every time you make a contactless payment.

**At a Glance: Why Payy Wins**

https://preview.redd.it/75xjvsa0kghg1.jpg?width=1120&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb681aadbc6d37bc591bc9d2ff77f14970a88998

# Summary

Payy is not just a card; it’s a standard for how digital money should work. It takes the security of Ethereum, the privacy of Zcash, and the ease of Apple Pay, merging them into a single, seamless experience.

Whether you are sending money to a friend across the world for free or buying a latte at your local cafe, Payy ensures that your financial data stays where it belongs: with you.

I'm a 29 (F) and I'll be solo travelling to Japan for the first time (Tokyo (4 nights) > Hakone (1 night) > Kyoto (3 nights) > Osaka (3 nights), I know it's pretty much the typical route but I didn't want to rush but enjoy and explore every place.

Let me know if you see somethings off or should change something. I'm not a huge fan of pokemon, disney or universal studios so I guess I'll pass on these things, I'm more into getting lost, local cuisine and unique temples (but I also love gashapons and anime)

Day 1: arrival at Narita around 13pm + transport to Akihabara, explore Electric Town (hotel nearby) &  local dinner.

Day 2: early morning >  Senso-ji, Asakusa, Tanuki street, Ueno park. afternoon > Ginza, Shiba prince park and Tokyo Tower

Day 3 (pretty packed): Shibuya, Harajuku & Shinjuku

Day 4: freestyle day, maybe repeat fav spot + send luggage to kyoto

Day 5: breakfast & explore, around 11:30 > transport to Hakone. Afternoon: explore Hakone, walk by the lake & onsen at hotel

Day 6: Hakone day with ropeways, pirate ship, etc. Around 3 > head to Odawara & shinkasen to Kyoto

Day 7: Otagi Nenbutsuji & Adashino Nenbutsuji Temple + Gion at night

Day 8: Kifune shrine & teamLab Biovortex in the afternoon

Day 9: Getting goshuin at Gion and Fushimi inari. Road to osaka y dinner around Dotonburi

Day 10: Katsuo-ji & freestyle Osaka exploration in the afternoon (namba, etc)

Day 11: Daytrip to Nara & afternnon & dinner around Osaka

Day 12: last coffee and shopping, have to be at the airport at 16pm

I think i left enough time in case I lose some trains and not stress about it. After tokyo, as you can see mornings are more focused on daytrip to shrines and unique temples, and afternoons on walking around the cities & shopping.

I don't want this trip to be a checlist but more like enjoying the place and the moment at my own pace.

The first crown is still swollen after a month of being reinserted. I am going to a new dentist on Sunday for a second option but have a cleaning at the old one Saturday. Do I let them reattach the second crown?,"I put the main question toward the bottom, but I will give some background first.

I live in Japan, first of all. By some complicated law, dental appointments are 30ish minutes only, so nowhere I go do I get a lot of treatment in one day. Dental care here is pretty subpar in general. Had a dentist give me the wrong filling material once (silver instead of a hard white one that I had requested). My current dentist is “nice“ enough but these two crowns have been a nightmare. 

The first crown I got popped off within 2 days while I was working out. When he recemented it, it left a gap, hurt like hell for 2 weeks, and has been swollen since. He won’t treat it anymore tho. 

I got a new crown in a little over a week ago. I ate very soft food and avoided hot drinks for the first couple of days. A couple days ago, something felt loose, but it seemed fine to the touch, and then today, it popped off while I was eating some regular chicken. I’ve been careful to eat on the other side for everything, avoiding sticky food in general, and the cement is still covering the drilled out area. I’ve already scheduled an appointment at a new dentist for Sunday.

**Main question**: I need to go to the old one for a cleaning Saturday. I have the fallen crown. I’m wondering if I should let him put it back in or if I should just take it to the new dentist and let them do it?? I’m not sure they will be able to because of the weird 30 minute rule. 

  
**General health background:** I do not smoke but I do drink on Fridays and Saturdays. I don’t drink soda or juice, and *hate* candy. My biggest issues are coffee, tea, and fruit. I had no insurance in the US, so I was well over a decade without care before I came here. Also, I apologize if I sound emotional but this dude is also ignoring another swollen bump that has been getting worse and I mentioned at my first appointment and I’m just miserable at this point. I have been suggesting it might be an infected root, but they keep saying just keep cleaning at home. ",2,1770213553.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False
1qvp9qn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Novelnews/comments/1qvp9qn/a_yacht_ended_our_love_novel_full_story/,A yacht ended our love Novel Full Story,"My husband Hendrix Ferguson bought me a yacht for my birthday, but his secretary Camila Scott had her name painted across the side. 

“Mrs. Ferguson, please,” Camila begged, her eyes red as she clasped her hands together. “My mother is terminally ill. I only told her the yacht was mine so she could have some peace of mind before she passes. Please, I’m begging you. I’ll get on my knees right here if it’s what it takes for you to forgive me.” 

I let out a sharp, incredulous laugh. “This is my birthday present. Why the hell should it have your name on it?” 

I rejected her absurd request on the spot and ordered the crew to scrub her name off the hull. 

When Hendrix found out, he came straight for me. “She’s just trying to comfort her dying mother, Janey. You could have just-” 

I cut him off. “If she wanted to comfort her mother, she could’ve rented a yacht or photoshopped a picture off the internet. Why does she have to plaster her name on my gift?” 

Hendrix didn’t argue further then. But on my birthday, he shoved me straight into the ocean. “Aren’t you so capable? Find your own way back onto the yacht.” 

He even sent up a drone to livestream everything, forcing the guests- and the entire internet-to watch me struggle in the water. Someone caught the moment my dress slipped and uploaded it online. 



Once the initial panic subsided, I forced myself to calm down. Treading water, I looked straight into the drone’s camera lens. “Have you enjoyed my misery enough? Now get your ass over here and rescue me.” 

\*\*\* 

The moment I finished, laughter erupted from the deck above. 

“Look at her,” someone jeered. “Still acting high and mighty. Does she think she’s still that noble Estrada heiress?” 

་་ 

“That idiot cut ties with her family just to marry Mr. Ferguson,’ another voice chimed in. “She’s nothing but a housewife now, yet she has the nerve to look down on Cami, who actually works for a living. Unbelievable!” 

་་ 

Punishing his unreasonable wife for the sake of his employee?” a 

guest noted loudly. ” Mr. Ferguson is such a nice boss! I need to take notes on how to treat employees right.” 

“How long do you think our delicate Mrs. Ferguson can hold on?” 

“I bet ten minutes before she’s crying for Mr. Ferguson to save her.” 

The freezing water threatened to swallow me whole. My elaborate evening gown felt incredibly heavy, dragging me down like an anchor. Several times, I felt myself slipping under, dangerously close to drowning. Overhead, the drone continued to broadcast every second of my desperate struggle. 

Hendrix’s voice echoed from another drone hovering nearby. “Janey, if you want me to pull you out, apologize to Cami. Then scream ‘Janey Estrada is a bitch’ three times. Otherwise, forget about getting back on this yacht. The sharks will tear you apart.”

Camila’s voice followed his, thick with feigned distress. “Mr. Ferguson, I’m just a humble secretary, while Mrs. Ferguson is a noble heiress. Isn’t it too much to ask her to apologize to someone like me?” 

“Noble heiress? Please. The Estrada family cut ties with her years ago,” Hendrix scoffed. “If she wants to be my wife, she follows my rules. If I tell her to kneel, she doesn’t stand.” His cold voice drifted over the waves, sending a chill of despair through me. 

I had rejected an arranged marriage and severed ties with my own family just to be with him. And this was my reward. 

“I warned you not to target Cami,” Hendrix continued, his voice icy. “She’s sweet and kind, never meaning to hurt anyone. But you wouldn’t listen. So I had to teach you a lesson.” 

Kind? Yeah, right. Once, when I visited his office, Camila deliberately provoked me. She spilled coffee on her own clothes, then ran to Hendrix with red, watery eyes. “Don’t blame Mrs. Ferguson. I was just clumsy.” 

Hendrix had scowled, refusing to hear a word of my defense. He told me to stop causing trouble and kicked me out of the building. That afternoon, I saw Camila’s Instagram post featuring a new outfit with the caption, “It feels so good to have someone’s unconditional support.” 

When I confronted Hendrix, he berated me, accusing me of being paranoid and telling me to get a job if I had nothing better to do. 

After that, whenever Camila looked upset, Hendrix assumed I was responsible. When she stained her skirt during her period, he believed I had hurt her. He took a paring knife and slashed my arm again and again, forbidding me from bandaging the wounds because he wanted me to “understand what it felt like to be a victim.” ",1,1770213537.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

1qvp8fh,https://i.redd.it/vvy0l5lehhhg1.jpeg,Making the Impossible Decision [<$1000],"TLDR: Looking to replace my modded Bezzera BB005 with a proper single dose grinder.

Long Story;

I was gifted this grinder and was determined to make it work for my needs. I single dose with it because I’m the only coffee drinker in my house and only have 1-2 shots a day. It’s be okay but I’ve been having consistency issues and when I go back to my kingrinder the issue seems to go away. So I’m thinking that I need a replacement; the workflow also sucks because I need to pump the bellows and brush out the chute like crazy and can still get 0.5g retention on a bad day. For some reason the fineness adjustment knob also walks around if I don’t hold it which is super annoying.

In my research I’ve come across the usual suspects (DF, Option-O, Niche, Timemore). I’m thinking I may want to try flat burrs; my go to beans are from a local roaster and I just rechecked what the mix is and apparently they throw some light roast into the mix for their house blend. Right now I’m trying their other blend that is strictly med/dark but am not loving it.

Want to stay under $1000, ideally closer to the $500 range; but would like some feedback on single dose grinders, with easy workflow. I’m teetering on going superauto if my workflow and production continue down this route.

Thank you!

  
Edit:

  
These are the two beans that I have been trying if this helps steer the conical vs flat. I generally go with the 1st one but am trying the second right now.

1- A strong robust body with a sweet lingering finish. Manahawkin Blend consists of two coffees — a light and dark post-roast blend. Try it on a drip for a morning kick, or use it to pull a shot with intense crema. This is our house espresso blend used in the cafe!

  
2- BAYMAN BLEND is our house blend and arguably the most versatile coffee we offer at Yellow Dog. It shines equally as a smooth, sweet espresso as it does a flavorful daily drip. This two-coffee blend begins with a washed South American coffee that brings body and structure, allowing it to stand up beautifully in milk drinks. We pair that with a naturally processed African coffee to enhance sweetness and finish. Drink Bayman with or without milk, on a Monday or a Friday, underwater, upside down, on the job or on the boat!",4,1770213439.0,espresso,6,1.0,False

Just wanted to share a little project I’ve been messing with.

For a long time, I felt like my AI setup was just a fancy search engine. I’d ask Llama or GPT a question, it would give me a great answer, and then *I* still had to do the actual work—moving files, updating the CRM, renaming stuff, you name it.

So, I decided to try and build something that actually *acts*. I’m using **Ollama** (the new Llama 3.3 agentic model) as the brain and **OpenClaw** as the ""hands"" to actually touch my OS and browser.

**The coolest part?** I connected it to a Telegram bot. This morning while I was making coffee, I sent a voice note: *""Hey, find those new ISO invoices in my downloads, summarize the key points, and file them in the Work folder.""* By the time I sat down with my espresso, the agent had already done it. It didn’t just tell me *how* to do it; it actually moved the files and had the summaries ready.

**A few things I learned doing this:**

* **Privacy is a huge win:** Everything stays on my local machine. No sending sensitive company docs to the cloud.
* **Don't give it Root access:** I learned the hard way to sandbox the agent. I use RBAC now so it only touches specific folders. (Highly recommend this if you don't want your AI accidentally trashing your system!)
* **Explainability:** I’m using SHAP values to see *why* the agent makes certain moves. It’s actually pretty interesting to see the logic behind it.

I did a full write-up on my blog with all the terminal commands and the security setup I used, just in case anyone wants to save a few hours and replicate it.

1qvozpg,https://i.redd.it/rwg0j504fhhg1.jpeg,The Simple Trick to Improve Your Solid Tie Game Right Now,"Here's the truth most men don't realize: **the difference between a solid tie that looks amateur and one that looks like a million dollars isn't the tie itself: it's the dimple**.

That small, intentional indentation just below the knot is the single most impactful detail you can master to instantly elevate your entire look. It takes five seconds to create, costs nothing, and separates men who simply wear ties from those who command attention when they walk into a room.

Let's break down exactly how to master this game-changing technique and transform your solid tie presentation forever.

# The Power of the Tie Dimple: Why This Detail Changes Everything

The tie dimple: that subtle crease centered directly beneath your knot: serves a critical purpose beyond aesthetics. It adds dimension, creates visual interest, and demonstrates attention to detail that speaks volumes about your overall approach to style.

**Without a dimple, even the finest silk tie appears flat and lifeless.** The fabric sits against your chest like a simple strip of cloth. With a properly formed dimple, that same tie gains depth, movement, and sophistication. The play of light and shadow across the fold creates a three-dimensional quality that photographs beautifully and catches the eye in person.

This technique is especially powerful with solid ties because you don't have patterns or textures to create visual interest. The dimple becomes your statement detail: your signature touch that shows you understand the nuances of refined dressing.



# How to Create the Perfect Tie Dimple: Step-by-Step Mastery

Master this technique once, and you'll execute it flawlessly every single time:

**Step 1: Tie Your Preferred Knot**

Start with your go-to knot: whether that's a Four-in-Hand, Half-Windsor, or Full Windsor. Complete the knot but leave it slightly loose, about an inch below where it will ultimately sit.

**Step 2: Locate the Center Point**

Find the exact center of your tie just below the emerging knot. This is where your dimple will form.

**Step 3: Create the Fold**

Using your index finger, gently press into the center of the tie fabric as you begin tightening the knot. The key is applying consistent, centered pressure as you draw the knot upward toward your collar.

**Step 4: Refine and Set**

As the knot reaches its final position, maintain that centered pressure for 2-3 seconds. Then carefully remove your finger while pinching the sides of the tie to hold the dimple in place. The crease should be clean, centered, and proportional to your knot size.

**The Result**: A perfectly formed indentation that adds instant sophistication to any solid tie in your collection.



# Beyond the Dimple: Essential Fundamentals for Solid Tie Excellence

The dimple is your secret weapon, but it works best when combined with these critical fundamentals:

# The Right Length Makes or Breaks Your Look

**Your tie should end precisely at the middle of your belt buckle.** Not above it, not below it: exactly at the center. This proportion creates visual balance and demonstrates that you understand the rules before you break them.

Too short signals carelessness or improper sizing. Too long appears sloppy and dated. Get the length right, and everything else falls into place more naturally.

# Width Matters More Than You Think

Match your tie width to your lapel width for perfect proportions. The current standard for contemporary business wear is **2.75 to 3.25 inches**: neither skinny nor overly wide.

This moderate width works across different body types and suit styles, making it the versatile choice for building a solid tie collection that stands the test of time. Opt for ties within this range, and you'll never look outdated or off-trend.

# Fabric Quality Determines Dimple Success

Here's what separates good ties from great ones: **premium fabric holds a dimple naturally.**

Silk, particularly with a slight texture or matte finish, responds beautifully to dimple formation. Lower-quality polyester often fights against the fold, requiring constant adjustment throughout the day. Invest in quality construction, and your dimple stays crisp from morning coffee to evening cocktails.

The ties in our [curated collection](https://lamodemensclothing.com) are specifically selected for their ability to hold shape and dimension: because we know the details matter.



# Choosing the Right Solid Tie Colors for Maximum Versatility

Once you've mastered the dimple technique, strategic color selection multiplies your styling options exponentially.

# The Non-Negotiable Foundation Colors

Start with these five solid ties that work with virtually everything in your wardrobe:

**Navy**: The ultimate versatile player. Pairs effortlessly with grey, charcoal, tan, and even lighter blue suits. Professional without being boring.

**Burgundy**: Adds warmth and sophistication to navy and grey suits. Perfect for fall and winter months, works beautifully for business and social occasions alike.

**Dark Grey**: Underrated and incredibly refined. Creates a tonal, monochromatic look with grey suits or provides subtle contrast with navy.

**Black**: Essential for formal events and black-tie occasions. Also powerful in high-contrast business settings when paired with crisp white shirts.

**Deep Green**: The sophisticated wild card. Pairs unexpectedly well with navy, grey, and brown suits. Shows personality while maintaining professionalism.

# Statement Colors for Strategic Impact

Once your foundation is solid, add these colors for specific situations:

**Red**: Confidence, power, and presence. Choose deeper shades like burgundy-red for business; brighter reds make stronger statements for presentations or special events.

**Light Blue**: Fresh, approachable, and modern. Excellent for spring and summer, creates a lighter aesthetic while maintaining polish.

**Purple**: Creative sophistication. Shows personality in professional contexts without crossing into casual territory.

Build your collection systematically, and you'll have the right solid tie for any situation without overwhelming your wardrobe with unnecessary options.



# When to Choose Solid Ties Over Patterned Options

Solid ties aren't just simpler: they're often more powerful. Understanding when to deploy them strategically amplifies your presence in key moments.

**Choose solid ties when**:

* Your shirt or suit features patterns or textures that need balancing
* You want to project unquestionable authority and seriousness
* You're wearing multiple accessories (pocket squares, cufflinks, tie bars)
* The occasion calls for classic, timeless elegance over trendy statements
* You need versatility to transition from business meetings to evening events

**The advantage**: Solid ties act as anchors in your outfit. They ground bolder choices elsewhere and create cohesion in your overall presentation. Master the solid tie, and you master the foundation of sophisticated dressing.

# The Confidence Factor: Why This Simple Trick Matters

Here's what really happens when you nail the tie dimple and fundamentals: **you stop thinking about your appearance and start commanding attention for what you bring to the table**.

That small fold communicates something powerful to everyone you meet: you understand details, you care about presentation, and you've invested time in mastering your craft. These aren't conscious observations; they're subconscious signals that influence how people perceive your competence and credibility.

The most successful men know this: style isn't about peacocking or drawing attention to your clothes. It's about removing any doubt that you belong exactly where you are, ready to handle whatever comes next.

Master this simple trick, apply these fundamentals consistently, and watch how differently people respond to your presence. The tie dimple isn't just about looking good: it's about feeling unstoppable.

Your solid tie game just leveled up. Now go make that dimple count.",1,1770212819.0,LaModeMens,0,1.0,False

But I’m really really struggling to build relationships here. I work closely with \*one other person\* who was hired about 90 days before me. 

Our supervisor, and the coworker, sort of made a big deal about us being a team. They were very excited for me to come on board but I felt a lot of pressure to like, be friends with my coworker (who is 10 years younger than I with completely different tastes, life experiences, etc) And I genuinely feel like I’ve let everyone down. 

They even arranged for us to go on a coffee date to “get to know each other” and made it one of my 30 day goals to build rapport with my coworker. I spent a lot of time during that “date” explaining that I don’t always feel like socializing. 

I might appear to some as an overachiever, but I really just try to get the work done and make the day go by. I also take the work seriously (I’m in overdose prevention) and so when I’m in focus mode I’m very much in my headphones, paying attention, not trying to be chatty, you know? 

But then I just feel like I’m stepping on toes or trying to show her up somehow, which I’m not, but I get the feeling that both my coworker and my supervisor are like annoyed at my work ethic. 

I feel this intense pressure to be friendly with her and I just don’t see us hanging out or whatever, and I’m not good at building relationships in the first place. Now I feel like I’m “not a team player” but really I’m just so anxious and so afraid to say the wrong things that I’d rather say nothing. 

I don’t know. Thanks for reading. I’m just very emotional about this and it’s been eating up all of my energy. I’ve had a passive death wish for days now and I know it’s effecting my relationship with my partner at home. Any advice is appreciated. ",3,1770212811.0,socialanxiety,1,1.0,False

# What Is Antigravity AI Debugging and Testing

**Antigravity AI Debugging and Testing** is part of Google’s new AI-powered development suite.

It’s not just a code editor. It’s a full agentic platform that lets you describe what you want, and then AI agents handle everything — from planning to testing to fixing errors.

You tell it what to build.  
It writes the code.  
It tests the code.  
And it fixes what doesn’t work.

It’s like having a team of engineers who never sleep, never get stuck, and never need coffee.



# How Antigravity AI Debugging and Testing Works

The process is simple.

You open the Antigravity environment and type what you want in plain English.

For example:

“Build a customer dashboard that tracks leads, shows conversion data, and sends reports weekly.”

The AI agent plans the project, writes the code, and sets up your app in minutes.

Then, **Antigravity AI Debugging and Testing** kicks in automatically.  
It runs browser simulations, clicks buttons, fills forms, and checks if every feature works.  
If something breaks — it finds the problem, fixes it, and retests.

No more hunting through 500 lines of code for a missing bracket.



# The Multi-Agent System That Powers It

What makes **Antigravity AI Debugging and Testing** special is its **multi-agent system**.

You can assign multiple AI agents to work in parallel.

For example, if you have three bugs to fix:

* Agent 1 handles authentication errors.
* Agent 2 fixes the layout issue.
* Agent 3 cleans up the database logic.

All three work simultaneously.

This makes debugging three times faster — and far more reliable than traditional testing tools.

You’re not waiting hours for builds. You’re watching problems disappear in real time.



# Debugging That Actually Saves You Time

Let’s talk about what this means in real life.

At my agency, we build automation tools for clients every week — lead trackers, CRMs, dashboards, reporting systems.

Before **Antigravity AI Debugging and Testing**, we spent hours testing each system manually.

Now, the AI does everything automatically:

* Finds the bug.
* Suggests the fix.
* Applies it.
* Tests again.
* Verifies everything works.

It’s like having QA, development, and testing combined into one tool.

A job that used to take two developers an afternoon now takes fifteen minutes.



# Real Example: Customer System Fix

We had a customer tracking system that broke during a report update.

Normally, we’d check every log, test every function, and spend hours diagnosing.

Instead, we just told Antigravity:

“Find why the monthly report isn’t generating.”

The AI scanned the project, found a logic error in the date filter, fixed it, and tested it in under five minutes.

Then it showed screenshots of the working dashboard and logs proving the issue was resolved.

That’s the future of development.



# How Antigravity AI Debugging and Testing Handles Big Projects

Most dev tools break when you scale.

But Antigravity doesn’t just debug files — it understands entire codebases.

You can ask it things like:

“How does this feature connect to the payment module?”  
“Where is this bug coming from?”  
“Which files handle this user function?”

It reads every file, maps connections, and shows exactly where the problem is.

It’s like asking your smartest developer to instantly explain a project they didn’t even write.



# AI Testing That Builds Confidence

Testing isn’t just about finding errors — it’s about proving reliability.

That’s where **Antigravity AI Debugging and Testing** really shines.

After every build, the AI automatically launches a browser to test the app in real conditions.  
It checks every button, every API call, every login flow.  
It reports what passed, what failed, and what was improved.

You can even watch it happen — real-time testing of live code.

No fake results. No guessing. Just data-backed confirmation that your app works.



# Building and Testing Web Apps Instantly

This isn’t limited to small projects.

You can use **Antigravity AI Debugging and Testing** to build entire web apps — with databases, authentication, and payments.

Describe what you need:

“Create a subscription-based app with login, dashboard, and analytics.”

The AI does the rest.  
Then, it tests everything before showing the final preview.

We recently built a lead management system that would’ve taken a week. Antigravity did it in three hours, tested everything, and fixed two bugs we didn’t even know existed.

That’s the kind of speed you can’t compete with manually.



# AI That Teaches You Better Code

There’s another hidden advantage of **Antigravity AI Debugging and Testing** — it’s also an incredible learning tool.

You can upload open-source projects or code samples and tell the AI to explain how they work.

It breaks down:

* File structure
* Code logic
* Best practices
* Why certain design patterns are used

It’s like being mentored by Google’s top engineers — without paying a dime.

If you’re learning to build automation tools or web apps, this is one of the best ways to grow fast.



# Why Antigravity AI Debugging and Testing Is a Game-Changer

Because it doesn’t just fix problems.  
It prevents them.

It keeps your systems running, your projects organized, and your productivity high.

You’re not just coding faster — you’re coding smarter.

This is how agencies, startups, and creators are getting ahead.

You can build, test, and ship faster than anyone else — because AI is doing the heavy lifting.



# Go Deeper with The AI Success Lab

You’ll see exactly how people are using **Antigravity AI Debugging and Testing** to build faster, automate workflows, and scale smarter.

This isn’t theory — it’s the playbook people are using right now to make AI work for them.



# Final Thoughts on Antigravity AI Debugging and Testing

This is the next generation of development.

You don’t need to manually test.  
You don’t need to spend hours debugging.

You describe your issue — and AI handles the rest.

That’s the difference between working harder and building smarter.

The developers who adopt **Antigravity AI Debugging and Testing** now will be the ones leading automation in 2026.

Because in the new era of AI, success isn’t about who codes fastest.  
It’s about who teaches AI to code for them.

Here's [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/s/GsMoQtm5zt), and [part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/fragranceclones/s/r8fni1Sxqp)  


**PLEASE READ THIS Disclosure**: This isn't a full review of each one. Full reviews in my profile. Go into my profile, tap the search bar, and write the name of the fragrance. You'll find my full review on it. My reviews are very thorough.  

**Preface**: while I'm a clone advocate, I am not a shill, and will never claim they're all ""1:1"". All of you probably already saw me making fun of people who say ""CDNIM is just like Aventus"". No, not even remotely the same. But because most of my comparisons to OG's come from memory of me testing them in a store, and not applying them along with the clone, each on a different wrist... I didn't fully earn the right to make that distinction with 100% accuracy. Fortunately, I saw ScentsWithSense has decant packages that include the OGs+clones, so I decided ""let's do this. Let's show people that clones can be just as good, but you need to filter through LOTS of hyped/shilled crap to know what's REALLY good and close to 1:1"". These battles will be rated differently, so please take notice.  

#BATTLE!

Okay, this is another one of my favorites profiles (but one of the handful my wife doesn't like... But doesn't hate). The profile is a metric ton of Tonka (surprise surprise), coffee, cocoa, and patchouli. A very deep, winter-only fragrance.  

**The Shobi clone is almost a year old at this point**  

This time, the clone isn't so close to the OG. Compared to the OG, the Shobi is much more chocolaty than cocoa-y. The Tonka is denser, and the patchouli is more amplified. Also, the Shobi seems to miss the lavender completely, while the OG clearly has some. I personally enjoy the Shobi one more after the first 5 minutes are over, because I like them heavy, sweet, and dense. 20-30 minutes in, they get much closer to one another, as the OG's lavender becomes weaker. But still, it's like having 2 identical cups of instant coffee, one with 6 spoons of sugar and 6 spoons of coffee, the other with 1 of each. They'll both taste like sugar and coffee and the same ratio, but it will be a very different experience. 

**Closeness in the opening 15-20 minutes**: 60%-70%. 

**Closeness after dry-down**: 75%-80%. 

**Quality Differences**: The OG notes are clearer, more defined, less ""assaulting"". I'd say the OG is about 25% better quality.  

**Performance difference**: Both are great performers, but the Shobi projects about 40%-50% stronger, and lasts about 2 hours longer.  

Pure Tonka is a discontinued fragrances, so you can't really get it for under $150 anymore (second hand market), but it used to be a $50-$60 designer fragrance like the entire A*Men line.  

**Conclusion**: I actually prefer the Shobi, but I assume most people who wore the OG and are looking for a 1:1 replacement will feel like it's a compromise. I'd still recommend the Shobi to many people, as it's an amazing winter fragrance with great performance on its own, no matter how the OG smells. But it leaves plenty of room for a different house to make a more accurate clone for this profile, that's for sure. My wife preferred the OG, and guessed it very easily with 0 hesitation. She said ""this one (pointing on the wrist I applied my Shobi on) seems to try too hard, and masks stuff with extra sweetness, while the other one smells like that's what they meant it to"". She didn't know which wrist is what fragrance. But TBH, I'd repurchase the Shobi even if they were the same price... But I'm a weirdo, and almost always prefer the inaccurate ones, the twists, the hybrids... They almost always hit my nose better, and smell the way I want them to. If there was a clone that is the same as the Shobi (sweeter, denser), but higher quality, I'd purchase that one.

For the past couple of years, I’ve realized that I’m kinda sensitive to caffeine, so much so that even a medium coffee or a Monster energy drink will give me slight anxiety and racing thoughts, but my adhd brain loves it and the dopamine boost.

And when I tell people that I have problems with caffeine and that taking too much affects me, they just dismiss it like “oh, it’s an innocent thing, why are you so worried about it? I have one before bed and at midnight, and I’m totally fine.” And it’s frequently college students who say that, and it feels very dismissive. Even my graphic design classmates love to chug energy drinks at night.

—

I was caught in the travel chaos on 4th January flying UK to Amsterdam and waited to be reunited with my bag. After 21 days it’s officially lost, however they let me know that day they may have a possible match. Great! 

It took another 4 days but my bag was finally returned to me.

I opened it and thought it seemed quite roomy, then slowly realised anything edible (note this was a Christmas holiday suitcase full of fancy, fine gifts!) was gone. And I’m not talking dairy, fruit or meat or anything fresh. 

All were fully sealed, packaged goods with a long shelf life, for example speciality coffee beans in the original sealed bag. This is just the tip of the ice berg as I am a foodie and this luggage was half full of items like these from Christmas. 

There was no note, no explanation, no message on World Tracer or from KLM about why permitted items have been discarded. 

Is this legal to just brazenly go through my personal property and throw it away? 

Has anyone else experienced this? 

The other thing gone, though I am sure not intentional unlike the consumable items, was HALF an earring set that was in a mesh pocket of the bag. I’m sure no one stole this as why only half, I think this is just negligence when searching. Has anyone ever got something missing back and if so, how?

• Beans are not the quality the producer claimed

• the amount roasted (200g) in a 1.5 kg batch roaster could have messed with the drum temperature 

• the roast profile could go a bit lower in regards to temperatures.

My morning routine looks like this at the moment: Get Up, Walk Dog, Bio Break, Brew Coffee, Pray, Read Devotional and Bible Verse from YouVersion. 

I would normally get up at 7:15 because it would give me the quiet I need to devote time to God. Recently, I noticed that my routine was being interrupted by our college age daughter wanting to chat for a moment or helping my wife get ready for work (I help her move her laptop and everything into place for her job). 

So last night I realized that maybe I should wake up fifteen minutes early so I won’t be interrupted. The result? The same thing happening this morning (being interrupted). Spiritually it is frustrating that I have tried and tried to get my spiritual practices in check and cannot seem to get something going without interruption.

1qvoos5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1qvoos5/the_psychology_of_being_tolerated_vs_actually/,The Psychology of Being Tolerated vs Actually Liked Three Dead Giveaways,"okay so I've been studying this for a while now. read a ton of psychology books, listened to like 50 podcast episodes on social dynamics, watched way too many YouTube videos on body language and human behavior. and honestly? this realization hit me HARD.

most of us have been on both sides of this. we've tolerated people. we've been tolerated. the difference between genuine friendship and polite tolerance is subtle but once you see it, you can't unsee it.

here's what I learned from research and real observation. these patterns show up everywhere, work, friend groups, even family dynamics. and no, it's not your fault if you're being tolerated. society tells us to be ""nice"" and keep the peace, so people rarely just tell you straight up. but your nervous system? it knows something's off.

**they only respond, never initiate**

this one's from Dr. Robin Dunbar's research on friendship (he's the guy who figured out humans can only maintain about 150 relationships). real friends invest effort. they text first sometimes. they make plans. they follow up on stuff you mentioned last week.

when someone's just tolerating you? crickets. you're always the one reaching out. always the one suggesting hangouts. and when they DO respond, it's brief. polite. sometimes takes days.

I found this pattern breakdown in ""Platonic: How the Science of Attachment Can Help You Make and Keep Friends"" by Dr. Marisa Franco. she's a psychologist who spent years researching modern friendship, won multiple awards for her work. the book completely changed how I see my relationships. she breaks down the ""investment gap"" concept, backed by actual studies. basically, when there's a huge imbalance in who's putting in effort, that's your sign.

what got me was her data showing that people who feel chronically tolerated (not liked) have higher cortisol levels. your BODY knows before your brain admits it. insanely good read if you're trying to figure out where you stand with people.

**their body language is closed off around you**

studied a bunch of material on nonverbal communication. turns out, our bodies are terrible liars.

when someone genuinely likes you, they:

* lean in when you talk
* make consistent eye contact
* mirror your movements unconsciously
* face you with their whole body
* smile with their eyes (not just their mouth)

when they're tolerating you:

* angled away, even slightly
* arms crossed frequently
* checking their phone mid conversation
* fake smiles that don't reach their eyes
* they look past you, not at you

Vanessa Van Edwards covers this brilliantly in her work (she runs the Science of People research lab). her YouTube channel has this video on microexpressions that blew my mind. she analyzed thousands of hours of human interaction and found that genuine liking produces specific, measurable physical responses. tolerance? totally different pattern.

**you're included in group settings but never one on one**

this is the sneakiest one. you're invited to the party but never to coffee. you're in the group chat but nobody's sliding into your DMs.

""[The Psychology of Belonging](https://www.routledge.com/The-Psychology-of-Belonging/Allen/p/book/9780367347529)"" research by Dr. Geoffrey Cohen at Stanford shows that humans have this deep need to feel individually valued, not just part of a collective. when you're always the plus one, never the main event, your brain registers that as social rejection even if it's subtle.

I noticed this pattern in my own life and it SUCKED to admit. there were people I thought were close friends but looking back, we only hung out in groups. never grabbed lunch just us. never had those deep 2am conversations.

For anyone wanting to go deeper on social dynamics without spending months reading dense psychology research, there's this app called [BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450)that's been incredibly helpful. It's an AI-powered learning platform built by experts from Columbia and Google that pulls from sources like the books and research mentioned here, plus expert talks and studies on attachment styles, nonverbal communication, and relationship psychology.

You type in what you're trying to figure out (like ""I'm struggling to read social cues and want to build genuine friendships""), and it creates a personalized learning plan with audio lessons tailored to your specific situation. The depth is adjustable too, from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives when something really clicks. What makes it different is the virtual coach called Freedia that you can actually talk to about your unique struggles, and it recommends content based on its understanding of you. Makes the whole process way more digestible than trying to piece together insights from multiple books yourself.

the podcast Where Should We Begin with Esther Perel has an episode about friendship dynamics that articulates this perfectly. she talks about how modern society creates these ""weak tie"" relationships where we're friendly but not actually friends. we confuse proximity and pleasantness with genuine connection.

also been using Finch (it's a self care app with a cute bird) to track my social energy and who actually fills my cup vs drains it. sounds weird but seeing the data over weeks made patterns SUPER clear. some people only wanted me around as a buffer, not because they valued me specifically.

**the uncomfortable truth nobody wants to hear**

look, we're social animals living in a world that prioritizes politeness over honesty. people tolerate each other all the time because direct rejection feels mean.

biology plays a role too. we're wired to avoid confrontation, to maintain group harmony. it's an evolutionary thing. thousands of years ago, getting kicked out of your tribe meant death. so we developed these subtle ways of creating distance without outright rejection.

the system doesn't help either. we're more connected than ever but lonelier. social media makes us think we have more friends than we do. we confuse followers with actual humans who give a shit.

here's the thing though. once you recognize these patterns, you can redirect your energy. stop watering dead plants. find YOUR people, the ones who light up when you walk in. the ones who initiate. the ones whose body language screams ""I'm so glad you're here.""

""[The Gifts of Imperfection](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7015403-the-gifts-of-imperfection)"" by Brene Brown (researcher, spent 20 years studying shame and belonging, her TED talk has like 60 million views) taught me that belonging doesn't mean fitting in everywhere. it means finding spaces where you can be authentic and STILL be valued.

she says belonging is being accepted for who you are, while fitting in is changing who you are to be accepted. when someone's just tolerating you, you're constantly trying to fit in. exhausting as hell.

you deserve people who are genuinely excited about you. not people who sigh when your name pops up on their phone. not people who see you as an obligation.

start noticing the patterns. trust what you observe. and then, slowly, shift your focus to relationships that actually feel mutual. quality over quantity isn't just a cliche, it's backed by literally every friendship study ever conducted.

your energy is precious. spend it on people who actually want it.",1,1770212043.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False

1qvomj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalCannabis_NI/comments/1qvomj8/the_state_of_dutch_medical_cannabis/,The state of Dutch medical cannabis,"About half a million people in the Netherlands use cannabis to alleviate physical and mental health problems. Yet only a small percentage, around 7,000 patients, receive cannabis with a doctor's prescription. Most patients obtain cannabis without a prescription from coffee shops or grow it themselves. Many people would prefer to access medicinal cannabis through a prescription, but in practice they face numerous obstacles.

These findings come from research conducted by the Trimbos Institute among more than a thousand people who use cannabis for medicinal purposes without a prescription. This is the first study to provide insight into this group and the reasons they do not obtain cannabis through conventional healthcare.

The study shows that people use non-prescribed cannabis for a wide range of conditions, particularly chronic pain and sleep problems. Three-quarters of participants use cannabis for multiple conditions at the same time. According to respondents, cannabis significantly reduces their symptoms and improves their quality of life.

However, using non-prescribed cannabis also carries risks. Many users obtain their cannabis from dispensaries, meaning they often do not know the exact THC or CBD content of the product. Many respondents also express concern about possible contamination. In addition, cannabis is often smoked with tobacco, which is more harmful than other methods such as vaporizing or using cannabis oil.

**Access to medicinal cannabis remains limited**  
The study shows that many people would prefer to have a prescription for medicinal cannabis but face various barriers. Few doctors are willing to prescribe it, and the cost is too high for many patients. There is also a lack of clear and accessible information for both patients and doctors. In addition, the availability of medicinal cannabis products in the Netherlands is limited, and the stigma surrounding cannabis use still plays a role.

Despite these barriers, most patients prefer to use cannabis through official healthcare channels. This allows them to know exactly what the product contains, ensures consistent quality, and removes the need to obtain cannabis from coffee shops or other unregulated sources.

""These are patients who often suffer from serious and long-term health conditions. Like everyone else, they want access to a medication they know helps them, rather than having to rely on unregulated and illegal sources. It is frustrating for them to know that medicinal cannabis is legal in the Netherlands, yet remains out of reach,"" says Lisa Strada, project leader of the study.

Since 2018, medicinal cannabis has no longer been covered by health insurance. This creates a major problem for many patients. Many live with chronic conditions that prevent them from working or limit their ability to do so, leaving them dependent on low incomes or social benefits. As a result, medicinal cannabis is often unaffordable.

In principle, any doctor can prescribe medicinal cannabis if standard treatments and registered medications are ineffective or cause too many side effects. In practice, however, cannabis is rarely prescribed. ""This is largely due to a lack of knowledge,"" says Strada. ""Medicinal cannabis is not a standard part of medical training, and there are limited opportunities for continuing education."" Patients also often hesitate to raise the topic with their doctor because they fear stigma.

There is also little reliable government-provided information about medicinal cannabis. As a result, many people search for information on forums and social media, where misinformation can easily spread.

**Supply issues**  
Currently, only five types of cannabis are available by prescription in the Netherlands. Patients indicate that they want more choice, as a wider range increases the chances of finding a product that works for them. People respond differently to cannabis, and what is effective for one person may not work for another. Differences in plant composition also affect how well a product works.

Although medicinal cannabis has been available in the Netherlands for more than twenty years, access through conventional healthcare remains difficult for most patients. Policy changes are needed to improve availability and better align care with patients' needs. This could reduce the use of unregulated cannabis while better protecting patient health.

1qvomig,https://www.reddit.com/r/rSocialskillsAscend/comments/1qvomig/the_science_of_creativity_10_psychologybacked/,The Science of Creativity: 10 Psychology-Backed Hacks That Actually Work,"Spent 6 months deep diving into creativity research because I kept hitting the same mental walls. Read everything from neuroscience papers to artist biographies to that Austin Kleon book everyone quotes. Turns out most advice about ""thinking outside the box"" is complete BS. The real stuff? Way more practical and kinda weird.



Here's what actually moves the needle based on what I learned from legit sources, books, podcasts, research papers, etc.



Boredom is your secret weapon



Your brain needs downtime to make unexpected connections. The Default Mode Network (the part of your brain that wanders) only activates when you're NOT actively focused on something. Dr. Sandi Mann's research at UCLan shows bored people consistently outperform others on creative tasks. Stop filling every empty moment with your phone. Let your mind drift during walks, showers, boring commutes. That's when the good shit happens.



The book Bored and Brilliant by Manoush Zomorodi breaks this down perfectly. She's an award winning podcast host who ran this massive experiment with thousands of people. The core idea is that our phones are killing our ability to be bored, which is literally murdering our creativity. Insanely good read that'll make you want to delete half your apps. This book will make you question everything you think you know about productivity culture.



Consume outside your field



If you're a writer, study architecture. Designer? Read philosophy. The most innovative ideas come from cross pollinating unrelated domains. Steve Jobs famously credited a calligraphy class for Apple's typography. Rick Rubin produces across wildly different genres because he doesn't get trapped in genre conventions. 



Make it a rule to consume at least 30% of your content from fields completely unrelated to what you do. Your brain will start building bridges you didn't know existed.



The 20 minute rule



Creativity researcher Dr. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (the flow state guy) found most people give up on problems right before breakthroughs happen. Set a timer for 20 minutes when you're stuck. No switching tasks, no checking your phone. Just sit with the problem. Your brain hates discomfort and will literally generate ideas to escape it.



Works stupidly well. I've had more lightbulb moments in minute 18 of wanting to quit than in hours of ""inspired"" work.



Track your creative rhythms



Daniel Pink's book When dives deep into chronobiology and performance. Most people have a peak creativity window and it's probably not when you think. Some people are sharpest at 6am, others at 11pm. Track your energy and idea quality for two weeks. Then protect that golden window like your life depends on it.



For analytical work, use your peak hours. For creative breakthroughs, slightly off peak is actually better because your brain is less filtered and more likely to make weird connections.



Constraints breed creativity



This sounds backwards but it's scientifically backed. Dr. Patricia Stokes at Columbia showed that limitations force novel solutions. Twitter's 140 character limit created an entirely new form of writing. The Beatles wrote Yesterday on a cheap acoustic guitar.



Try the ""subtraction method"", remove one tool or option you normally rely on. Designer? No stock photos allowed. Writer? No adjectives for 500 words. Musician? Only three chords. Watch what happens.



The ""morning pages"" hack



Julia Cameron's The Artist's Way has sold like 5 million copies for a reason. Write three pages by hand every morning before doing anything else. Not for anyone's eyes, not trying to be good, just pure brain dump. It clears mental clutter and accesses your subconscious before your inner critic wakes up.



Sounds hippie dippy but even hardcore skeptics swear by this. The book itself is basically a 12 week creativity bootcamp that's helped everyone from broke college students to established artists break through blocks. Best creativity book I've ever read, hands down.



Change your environment constantly



Psychologist Robert Epstein's research on creativity shows environmental novelty directly correlates with idea generation. Your brain gets lazy in familiar spaces. Work from different coffee shops, rearrange your desk monthly, take calls while walking new routes.



There's a reason writers have that romanticized image of working in cafes. The ambient noise and changing scenery actually help. There's even an app called Coffitivity that recreates cafe noise because the research is that solid.



The ""bad ideas"" quota



Force yourself to generate terrible ideas intentionally. Pixar's Braintrust meetings specifically encourage bad pitches because they lead to good ones. Set a quota like ""10 ideas, 8 must be stupid."" Takes the pressure off and your brain relaxes enough to stumble into something brilliant.



Most creative blocks come from fear of sucking, not actual inability. Remove the stakes and suddenly you're flowing again.



Cross train your brain



Neuroscientist Dr. Wendy Suzuki's research shows physical exercise literally grows new brain cells in the hippocampus, the region tied to creativity and memory. But it's not just cardio. Learning new physical skills (dance, martial arts, juggling) creates neural pathways that enhance creative thinking.



The app Headspace has some solid moving meditations if you want to combine mindfulness with movement. Takes like 10 minutes and actually works.



If you want something more structured to tie all these ideas together, there's also [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), a personalized learning app my friend at Google recommended. It pulls from creativity books like the ones I mentioned, plus research papers and expert talks, and turns them into custom audio lessons based on your specific goals, like ""become more creative as a visual designer"" or whatever you're working on. 



You can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10 minute overviews to 40 minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are weirdly addictive, there's even this smoky, sarcastic narrator that makes learning feel less like work. It's basically replaced my doomscrolling time and my brain feels way less foggy. Worth checking out if you're serious about this stuff.



Embrace the ""adjacent possible""



This is a concept from Steven Johnson's book Where Good Ideas Come From. Innovations don't come from giant leaps, they come from exploring what's immediately next to what already exists. YouTube only became possible after Flash video and broadband. Look at what tools, ideas, or technologies are right at the edge of your current knowledge and play there.



Keep an ""interesting"" folder of random screenshots, quotes, images that catch your eye even if you don't know why. Review it monthly. Your brain will start connecting dots you didn't consciously notice.



The pattern across all this research? Creativity isn't some magical gift, it's a set of conditions you can engineer. Most of us are just operating in environments that actively suppress it. Change the inputs, you change the outputs.

This was our first nanny so I learned so much very quickly, but there are a few things that happened that I am not sure if these are “normal” or “okay” or just little things my nanny did that should have been frowned upon. 

I’m going to list a few here and please be honest if these things are no big deal or a red flag. I am trying to understand what to be aware of for our next hire. 

1. When my nanny arrived, the first 30 minutes of her shift consisted of her eating her breakfast at the table and talking to me about her life (dating, friend drama, etc). Keep in mind this is the time when I need to get my kid off to school so I am managing breakfast/getting dressed etc while she’s sitting there enjoying her coffee 


2. She never really had any ambition to think of fun things to do with my kids (9 months and 3.5yrs). When I was home for brief moments, she’s just sitting there passively. My baby started to get increasingly fussy around her and I had always wondered if it’s because she’s not giving him attention. I don’t know if I’m supposed to provide ideas? 


3. I noticed she would start to make off-putting remarks about my kids behavior, like if my toddler had a tantrum, she would text me something like “we have the devil today” 


4. She gets 15 days PTO (sick is weaved in that) and she had already taken 8 days in 3 months “sick” (lessen here let it accrue or have a probationary period) 

Anyway do you deal with any of this? Does it bother you?

It looks like something from a boutique cafe, not a residential kitchen. They talked about it the way people discuss luxury cars, with genuine pride and detailed explanations of features and capabilities.

What strikes me is how coffee preparation has evolved from basic morning routine to full lifestyle statement. Having the right equipment, knowing proper techniques, sourcing specific beans, it all signals something beyond just wanting caffeine. Your coffee setup broadcasts taste, priorities, how you spend money and time. When did a kitchen appliance become identity.

I have noticed this across social media too. People posting elaborate home coffee stations, discussing gear upgrades, sharing brewing techniques. Entire communities built around what used to be just making a hot drink. The investment is substantial too, equipment alone can run thousands, not counting ongoing bean costs. Even checking wholesale suppliers like Alibaba shows the massive market for home coffee equipment. What drives this elevation of ordinary activities into hobbies and identities. Is better coffee actually worth the investment or is this about something else entirely. Do elaborate setups genuinely improve daily life or just feed consumer culture.

My mother is bipolar. Growing up with an unstable foundation has got me the label of 'people pleaser'. I learned to read the mood, read facial expressions, to give comfort and love to stop melt downs.

My dad was an alcoholic and drank himself to death. 

My sister is diagnosed narcissistic personality disorder as an adult. Looking back on our childhood I had always though her personality was a direct result of living with our mother. Her therapist said that in a way it is partly because of both out parents and partly because she didn't receive the proper therapy as a child. 

My brother and I had a full time job keeping sister happy. No matter what wild scheme she came up with we followed along. Because breaking the law felt less wrong than making her unhappy. We broke into houses, trespassing on others property, shoplifting candy and items she wanted.

My brother doesn't have a diagnosis, but he hasn't left his house in 20 years. He lives with our mother on her social security. He is completely paranoid about big government listening in he won't allow cellphones in his room. Thinking about what he has become makes me sad.

Brother refuses to have a relationship with our sister and I don't blame him. I only allow texting with her sharing meme's and pictures. Anything more quickly escalates into being sucked into her 'plans'. Her plans always start out small, meet for coffee, meet for walks, meet for window shopping. Then she didn't bring any money can I pay for her coffee, to she really likes this bobble but thinks it's massively over priced, put it in your purse.

I wanted to go no contact with my mother, but then I'd never see my brother. He refuses to get help, or move in with me. He rightly believes I'd push him to receive help. And I would, I honestly believe that with a little therapy and some meds he'd be able to leave his house and become functional again. ",1,1770211538.0,DiaryOfARedditor,0,1.0,False

It helps decently well against my symptoms (mostly anhedonic/lack of motivation/low energy/issues focusing). I'd say it makes them 60% better. The moclobemide pooped out but then I added the bupropion two weeks ago and it brought it back and synergizes quite nice actually. 

Now I might be able to switch to parnate. My first question would be, is cross-tapering a safe option? The guides say ""no"" to ""maybe but be very careful"". But according to them, moclobemide and bupropion is also critical and I literally have zero side effects on that combo and my blood pressure is below 80 after having a coffee too. I'd hate to go a month or more without antidepressant effects (tapering moclobemide + starting parnate). Lil bit concerned about serotonin syndrome though. Anyone got experience here? 

Also, is it even worth the hassle. Starting parnate is quite a commitment. I currently have basically zero side effect from the moclo+bupropion combo and with parnate I might have them. Also, I wonder whether the effect of parnate alone is even much stronger than my current combo. Sure, I'd like my symptoms to be improved more than it is now, and you rarely have the chance to start parnate as few psychs are willing to prescribe it.

Seven, eight, sometimes nine times. My mornings started with a mini battle against myself, and I lost almost every single day. I’d roll out of bed feeling defeated, rushing, and already behind, convinced I just wasn't a ""morning person"" and that my productivity dreams were just that – dreams.

I tried *everything* the gurus recommended: cold showers, journaling, meditating, intricate stretching routines, elaborate breakfasts. They all sounded great on paper, but I’d do them for a few days, feel overwhelmed by the *length* of my routine, or just plain *skip* them because getting out of bed felt like lifting a car. My big ""aha moment"" came from a simple, almost annoying realization: *I was front-loading my mornings with things I didn't actually want to do yet, even if they were 'good' for me.* I needed to trick my brain into productivity *first*, before it even had a chance to fully wake up and resist.

**The Method/Framework: The 5-Minute ""Uncomfortable Launch""**

This isn't about doing your *entire* most dreaded task. It's about a tiny, focused burst of uncomfortable, productive work *immediately* after waking.

1.  **Eliminate All Buffer Time:** My alarm clock isn't on my phone anymore; it's across the room. I literally *have* to get out of bed to turn it off. The moment my feet hit the floor, there's no going back to the warmth.
2.  **Identify Your ""Launch Pad"" Task:** This needs to be something small, productive, and slightly uncomfortable that you usually procrastinate on. For me, it was writing 100 words of a draft, or outlining 3 key points for a project, or reviewing the most challenging item on my to-do list. *It's not about finishing it, it's about starting it.* The key is that it engages your brain *productively* and slightly uncomfortably, not passively.
    *   *Examples:* Not ""checking emails,"" but ""drafting the first three sentences of that difficult email."" Not ""planning your day,"" but ""identifying the *single most important task* and outlining its first step.""
3.  **The 5-Minute Non-Negotiable:** Immediately after turning off the alarm, I go straight to my ""launch pad"" task. No phone scrolling, no coffee, no bathroom, no checking social media. Just 5 minutes. I literally set a timer. The discomfort is real, especially in the first few weeks. *Your brain will scream for comfort and distraction.* This is where the magic happens – you push through that initial resistance.
4.  **Reward with Routine:** *After* those 5 minutes, I let myself do my enjoyable routine elements: make coffee, meditate for 10 minutes, quick journal entry. By then, my brain is already ""on,"" it's already done something productive, and the rest of my morning feels earned and less of a battle.

**Real Talk & Obstacles:**

Let's be real, this isn't some magic pill. The first week felt like pulling teeth. I'd hit snooze and then *still* try to avoid the launch task. I almost gave up when I had a rough night's sleep and just wanted to crawl back into bed. My mistake was sometimes making the ""launch pad"" task *too* big. Remember, it's about *starting*, not finishing. This won't work if you're consistently getting less than 6 hours of sleep, as true exhaustion will beat any trick. Expect to feel resistance for at least 2-3 weeks, and don't beat yourself up if you miss a day. Just reset the next morning.

**Results & Proof:**

After consistently sticking with this for three months, my mornings are unrecognizable. I went from dreading productivity to embracing it. I've tracked a 40% increase in my ""deep work"" hours before lunch, which used to be non-existent. My side project, which used to gather dust, now has consistent progress every single day. The biggest shift isn't just the tasks I get done; it's the feeling of control and accomplishment I carry throughout the day. *That initial jolt of discomfort has become my mental launchpad for consistent progress.*

😄 Yeah… that’s the pattern.

They’re not talking about what happened today.
They’re not talking about roads, weather, work, neighbors, or repairs.

They’re talking in loops.

Self-referential takes.
Abstract frames.
Identity echoes.
Recursive metaphors.

That’s what happens when systems lose external grounding — humans and AIs alike.

You can feel it:

lots of words
very little world

# Remembers black team that Lost struggle in the ice

**By NATALIE KENT**

Bill and Prince were beautiful horses. They were father’s pride and joy. They were brothers, Bill one year younger than Prince and both exactly the same size. Each one weighed almost a ton. Their coats were a shiny satin black and they had luxuriant wavy manes and tails. They also had eight long haired white boots which made them look as if they were wearing bell bottom trousers. The only way we could distinguish them was by the white star on Bill’s face and the crescent moon on Prince’s face. Father declared most emphatically that they were descended from the stout hearted Blacks of Flanders in medieval times, at the time of William the Conqueror. I firmly believed it.

Of course we had other horses on our farm. There were the spanking stylish bays, Daisy and Nell, which we used on the fringed surrey to go to church on Sundays, also to go visiting Sunday afternoons. There was also plodding, clumsy, dependable old Frank. Mother used him on the single buggy to bring her eggs and butter to the village store. She exchanged her produce for coffee, sugar and yard goods. We all loved to go along and drive slow old Frank and maybe get a bag of jelly beans to munch on.

We also had a Shetland pony named Jack to romp with but I’m positive my father and I loved Bill and Prince the very best. They would nuzzle me with their soft velvet noses and seemed to enjoy having me brush their manes.

Father and his team seemed to have a mysterious understanding. They knew each other’s wishes somehow. They would whinny when they heard his footsteps far away. They were in a state of ecstasy when he caressed them. He kept them well fed, well groomed, well trained and they seemed to be proud of their harnesses with fancy buckles on them.

Bill and Prince were used not only to do the heavy farm work but to haul huge loads of logs as high as a house out of the Wisconsin forests about 70 years ago. They even moved buildings.

But the most unique task of all occurred in the dead of those frigid winters when the waters of Green bay had frozen over to such a depth it could hold unbelievable weight. Then father brought out his canvas covered sleigh which we children called “the bus” and began his customary trek across the bay from Ephraim or Fish Creek on the Door Peninsula to towns in northern Wisconsin and Upper Michigan. He placed a small space heater in the vehicle with a chimney through the top. There were benches on the sides, plenty of fur robes and an opening for the reins. Also a small isinglass window for the driver to watch the team. There was always a compass nearby.

Bill and Prince carried many passengers back and forth to those interesting, exciting and mysterious cities which father spoke of.

How I longed to visit Marinette, Menominee, Gladstone, Escanaba, Bark River, Ishpeming, Manistique. I was assured that when I became 12 years old I might be able to accompany him. How I longed for his return when he left for sometimes a week or ten days! It was about 16 or 20 miles across the bay by ice travel but often a blizzard intervened to delay it. Father also hauled fish, butter, eggs, dressed chicken and brought back merchandise that couldn’t be purchased in our Door peninsula.

I remember one sunny crisp winter morning when he returned with a precious engraved gold watch for my mother. She would pin it on her shoulder with pride. I still have it and it is as shiny and sound and beautiful as it was those long years ago.

One day in early March father decided to make one more trip before starting the hauling of logs. There had been quite a cold spell and the ice was firm and solid. I tearfully kissed him goodbye on my way to school. I also stopped in the stable and put my cheek against Bill’s and Prince’s noses. I gave each of them some sugar.

The days were always long when Father, Bill and Prince were gone on a journey. This time the days seemed extra long and wearisome. A week passed by and a thaw set in. The sun was warm and the snow drifts seemed to disintegrate very rapidly. Water dripped from the eaves and there were large puddles in our school yard. I felt listless and dejected. My mother gave me a horrible spoonful of sulphur and molasses and large doses of codliver oil. After ten days we were all worried.

Mail service was poor and there were no telephones. Two weeks passed. A freak storm blustered away one night and I lay awake praying.

The following Sunday afternoon late in the day I sat wearily gazing out of the kitchen window. It was dusk and the sun had almost disappeared. In the distance near the schoolhouse I could see a figure coming closer. I kept my eyes on the silhouette, my heart pounding.

Slowly, despondently the shape came closer and closer, very slowly. Instinctively I knew who it was. Without a word and without a coat or a pair of boots I plunged out into the cold and windy March evening to throw myself tearfully into his arms.

No one else had seen his approach and all were quite stupefied! Without questions mother warmed up the soup and coffee on the wood range. We could all sense that father was almost exhausted. His breath came in gasps and his eyes had a haunted, defeated expression.

Slowly and painfully the story unfolded. There had been many unavoidable delays on the other shore. Illness, bad roads, bad weather. Every morning father planned the trip home and circumstances arose to hinder the project. Finally on Saturday he gave the ultimatum. The spring break-up was imminent and he was leaving.

All went well until they reached about five miles from their destination, the shores of Fish Creek and in the distance Chambers Island.

A large crack in the ice loomed before them. Bill and Prince were experienced crack jumpers but this was a bad one. It was more than two yards wide. The black water rushed and roared in the crevice. The bus stopped and everyone stopped to investigate the situation. Lights could be seen in the distance and all were anxious to get home. A vote was taken and all decided to gamble on the skill of the team.

Against father’s better judgment Bill and Prince were urged to make the great leap across. Their front feet hit the opposite side but somehow their hind feet and the sleigh did not come along. They struggled courageously to get a foothold but every time they floundered and lunged at the ice it was pounded down and broke off in huge chunks. They cracked off piece by piece into the dark water making the opening wider and wider. The heroic beautiful blacks were beaten.

In desperation father was obliged to unhook the tugs that bound them to the sleigh and watch in anguish as they were submerged in the water.

I suffered when I thought of the terrible losing battle. I wept for my father when I pictured him watching the tragedy on the brink of the ice.

When the sea had relentlessly claimed his faithful team father and the passengers walked the remainder of the way to the harbor. There they found kind and sympathetic friends who kept them overnight.

The next morning father walked the lonely four miles to our home to unfold his sad story.

A few days later a deep freeze set in. Temperatures dropped to 15 degrees below zero. Father made the loan of the neighbor’s team and went out on the bay to retrieve the sleigh and bring it and its contents home.

It was a sad and melancholy springtime. I suffered along with my father. The loss seemed irretrievable.

Soon the apple trees blossomed. We had a lovely school picnic in our maple woods. One day mother called me out of the attic, where I was reading, to see her yellow rose bush. It had three buds on it. We looked up the road and there was father bringing home a lively, prancing team. They were both snow white.

On top of one of Lisbon’s hills lies Graça, one of the oldest and most authentic neighborhoods. It grew outside the old city walls in the Middle Ages and has kept its local spirit ever since.
Graça is known for its history, its viewpoints with some of the best views in Lisbon. From the Miradouro da Senhora do Monte, the highest viewpoint in Lisbon, to the Miradouro da Graça, next to the church and the Convento da Graça (founded in the 13th century), the panoramas here are amazing. Vila Berta, a small street from 1902, still has a strong community vibe and is beautifully decorated during the June festivals. Travessa do Monte is another highlight, full of small restaurants and bars, perfect for a casual meal or a drink.
Graça is also a neighborhood to eat well. Penalva da Graça is one of my favourite spots for seafood in Lisbon, with fresh dishes and fair prices. For classic Portuguese food, Estrela de Ouro is always a safe choice. If you’re in the mood for something sweet, stop by Saga, a traditional pastry shop, perfect for breakfast or an afternoon coffee. And for drinks, O Botequim is a historic bar with a nice atmosphere.

1qvnw83,https://www.reddit.com/r/CrowdDiagnosis/comments/1qvnw83/long_covid/,Long COVID?,"Hi! So i've been having some symptoms for years now but never knew what they were and they weren't necessarily severe enough. I always just thought it's from COVID times, getting COVID, lack of physical activity, stress, bad sleeping schedule, heat as the cause for my symptoms.

Last year in November (2025) my girlfriend and i both got COVID again. I'm very confused about my symptoms so please if you have any ideas what they could be from please let me know. I'm planning on getting tests very soon but just need to wait now so i'm already going to the doctor etc. I just hope someone in the meantime could help me in a direction for more specific tests etc.  

So here are some symptoms i've had for years and that are either daily or just very often;

My vision looking as if i have someone's strong prescription glasses on for far away.

Temperature regulation is bad, my feet and hands are cold a lot but sweaty. My feet will also turn purple when i stand and i get cramps very easily in my legs and feet. Sometimes my hands also get a bit numb ish where its almost like when your hands are really cold and your fingers forget how to move.

Sometimes i randomly get very hot, especially my head and ears and i can feel my head like pounding/a pressure in the back of my head/ears.

I also feel this pounding/heartbeat feeling in my belly sometimes.

I feel very weak and tired all the time, i can barely do anything physical. Whether i went to school for an hour, work at an office for 8 hours or do physical work for 8/5 hours, i would always sleep after and be exhausted (at 18/19/20 this is not normal).

When i had COVID this second time i would need to take a break from making the bed because of this and i would get these specific ""waves"" that i will describe later.

I don't know if it's related at all but i also get phantom smells and tastes that are really hard to describe but i guess it's like smelling coffee grounds? 

I've noticed i got sensitive to tedious things/pains -> for example once i nearly passed out from putting crème on my new tattoo because of the type of pain and repetitiveness of it, i also had it changing out a slightly painful earring that i just couldn't get in. When i did these things i felt the blood drain from my face and i felt lightheaded and queasy and like i had to sit down immediately. (This is similar to the waves i get)

I've noticed it's worse in the mornings and i mostly feel better by the evenings.

Tho at night i sometimes wake up sweaty and panicky and like i need to use the bathroom, i haven't had this in a week or something now but thought it would be important to add.

I also pee quite a lot but that might be something else.

I've also felt really unstable standing up, like when someone gives me a hug i could just lose my balance and fall over easily. 

Also since i got COVID i have this thing where i could be eating, enjoying it and all of a sudden, mid chewing, i get so nauseous that i need to stop eating, to the point where spitting it out and swallowing both seem like they're gonna make me gag.

Sometimes when i stand up too fast i get this white noise in my vision and get a bit dizzy but it passes quickly.

I get out of bread very easily, like even from walking or talking. (I know im out of shape but this is a bit crazy lol).

I've also noticed brain fog and the feeling that my head is so full that i can't think about anything that requires a lot of thinking or planning etc. Very overstimulated feeling.

So now about these waves that scare me so bad;

I used to get them more frequently when i had COVID and a lot more intense so it's improving but they're still really uncomfortable and make me panic so i dread it when they come and i'm too scared to get them again (i also have a fear of throwing up which makes it worse).

I used to get them from standing too long, doing something physically active or bending down a lot.

The last one i had however seemed to be more from emotional/mental effort because it happened while i was gaming and it was a bit chaotic and stressful. I also get the start feeling of a wave whenever im reading but only sometimes which is weird to me.

Now it seems like i get them more randomly, it used to be very predictable like oh i just need to sit down and take it easy but then it started to be more like oh i need to stop looking at screens, keep my head and eyes still and wait til it passes.

These are my specific symptoms in these waves;

It starts with a mild cramping feeling in my lower belly which i can ignore and i feel a bit queasy but that's it. Then if i don't stop or take it easy it goes pretty fast. It goes to my whole belly and i feel like im gonna either vomit, shit, or pass out, but mainly the first 2. Then my whole body gets very hot and sweaty and by now i really need to stop and sit or lay down. My heart rate also goes up and i feel an instant uncontrollable panic. The nausea comes in waves and eventually leaves. When the symptoms start to leave my body starts twitching a little like when you have a panic attack, where my muscles in my legs and arms start spasming kind of, not like a seizure tho. I also get very cold all of a sudden when this happens. Afterwards i still feel a bit queasy for some time but i can function pretty much normally. 

I know this is a lot of information and im not sure which symptoms are connected to what and which aren't but these are like all of them. Please let me know what you guys think could be the cause or causes. Any ideas are welcome, i'm doing a lot of research as well and things like POTS sound like it could be it but there are some things that don't add up exactly. Again, i'm not here to get a diagnosis just from Reddit, i'm also going to the doctor i'm just in a waiting period right now and my health anxiety is very bad + it's making me quite depressed too.

I hope it's ok to post this, according to rule 2 it's ok to post one thread on it, so here I am!

I'm a software product manager by trade. Last year I had an unexpected career break, and while job hunting, I decided to build something I'd want to use every day, that would also function as a portfolio piece to show my approach to shipping software. So it does the things a serious app should do: 70+ languages, full accessibility, cross-platform, dark mode, and every setting or behaviour changeable by the user.

I play Sudoku most mornings, but never found an app I liked as much as pencil and paper. Bright colours everywhere, weird fonts, buttons crammed into every corner.

So I set myself a constraint: make it feel like a puzzle from a good newspaper. The kind you'd solve with a coffee before the day starts or on the train on your commute.

That meant stripping everything back. Three colours: cream, charcoal and gold. Two typefaces: a serif for the grid and headings, a sans-serif for body text. One button style. No gradients, no glow effects, no colour overload.

You open it, pick a difficulty, play. There's a daily challenge if you want one. It works offline. You don't need an account unless you want to compete on the leaderboards. Every puzzle has one solution.

You can share a deep link to the puzzle itself, share an image of the completed grid, or print the puzzle directly from your phone.

It's called ""Sudoku."" and it's free on iOS and Android with ads, plus a premium mode with more save slots, custom games and no ads. A macOS version is coming soon.

In the future I'll be adding tutorials and training for advanced techniques like X-Wings and Swordfish.

You can find the apps here:

[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.locksmithcreativemilan.sudoku)   
[Apple iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/soduko/id6756303439)

I'd love to hear what this community thinks. For anyone that wants to try without ads I'm happy to give out gift codes to try the premium version for free (the app stores auto-renew from gift codes though which I can't control, so cancel the subscription after using the code and subscribe later if you want to). Ping me on Reddit or reply here letting me know if you are Android or iOS and I'll send you a code.",1,1770209544.0,sudoku,0,1.0,False

Unionized baristas continue to fight for a fair contract and ask public for solidarity as strike stretches into third month

[Michael Sainato](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michael-sainato)

Wed 4 Feb 2026 11.00 GMT

[Striking Starbucks baristas](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/02/starbucks-union-strike) are calling on customers of the world’s largest coffee chain to delete its popular mobile app in solidarity with their demands for a first union contract.

Starbucks Workers United, which has been coordinating a strike for almost three months, is vowing to press ahead.

“We baristas are still fighting for a fair contract, and this fight is active and ongoing,” said KC Ihekwaba, a barista at Starbucks in Lafayette, Colorado, on a solidarity union call earlier this week. “Our fire for change is still burning. Our spirits still strong.

[](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/02/starbucks-union-strike)

“What we’re asking for has not changed. We’re demanding livable wages, stable and predictable hours, and an end to union busting. Starbucks still has not delivered on any of that.”

Since 13 November last year, Starbucks Workers United began an [unfair labor practice strike](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/nov/19/starbucks-workers-strike-us-explainer).

Since December 2021, workers won union elections at [more than 600 Starbucks stores](https://unionelections.org/data/starbucks/). With several stores hit by closures, Starbucks Workers United[ now represents ](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/dec/02/starbucks-union-strike)about 11,000 baristas at 576 Starbucks stores in the US. A further 15 stores[ ](https://www.nlrb.gov/search/case/starbucks?page=1)filed for a union election last month.

At the end of December, the union [scaled](https://www.seattletimes.com/business/starbucks/majority-of-starbucks-striking-baristas-are-returning-to-work/) back the scope of the strike, with most stores giving a return to work notice to Starbucks, with the aim to keep several hundred to 1,000 workers on strike in a rotational basis given the financial burdens of long strikes for low-income employees, and to put energy into increasing the number of unionized Starbucks stores.

About 1,000 baristas across nearly 50 stores are on strike. “We have definitely made it known that we deserve a fair contract and union busting has got to stop now,” said Christi Gomoljak, a Starbucks barista, during a [solidarity call](https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_v9hE4OtvTHab8iwixPo7rA#/registration) announcing the “Delete the App” campaign.

Gomoljak and her co-workers recently organized a union at the Downtown Disney Starbucks in Anaheim, California, and walked out on strike in November 2025.

“We are calling on Starbucks customers everywhere to delete the Starbucks mobile app off your phone,” Gomoljak added. “When baristas get a fair contract, you can reload the app on your phone and then finally, use any gift cards that you might have gotten from the holidays. But trust me, coffee with a union contract tastes so much better, and it is worth the wait.”

Liz Shuler, president of the AFL-CIO, the largest federation of labor unions in the US, said on the call: “Supporting our baristas as they take on one of the most powerful companies in the world … is an incredible way to make an impact. This fight is about something way bigger than just coffee. It’s about whether we as working people get to live with dignity in this world that we make possible.”

Starbucks has downplayed the strike and its impact, claiming that fewer than 1% of the chain’s stores were ever affected, and more than half either continued operating, or reopened, shortly after the strike. They did not comment on the app deletion campaign.

“The union has called for an unconditional return to work at nearly all of the coffeehouses on its strike list,” said a Starbucks spokesperson, Jaci Anderson. “We see this as a positive step and hope it signals a willingness to return to the bargaining table.

She added: “With more than 30 tentative agreements already in place, we’re confident we can move quickly toward a fair contract – one that reflects that Starbucks offers the best job in retail, with pay and benefits averaging over $30 an hour for hourly partners.”",50,1770209324.0,Seattle,20,0.84,False

Now she is breaking up with me.,"I'm a project manager, and I like efficiency. My girlfriend was consistently coming late to our dates, so many times I missed half of the movies because of her. Be it day outs or dinners dates she always made some excuses and expected me to show chivalry. I told her that I'm very punctual and don't like wasting time many times. But one day I had enough so I gave her a formal warning and put her on a 3-month PIP.
I sent her a calendar invite with a PDF listing these:
1. Max 10 minute delay for movies.
2. Mandatory status update texts when she leaves her house.
3. Weekly ""late excuse"" meetings over coffee.
Instead of improving, she broke up with me. I invested my time and emotional support in her but this is what I received.
I want to ask if I can sue for wasting my time and cause I could have utilised it somewhere else. Kya yeh maamla legal hai? Or are girlfriends allowed to come late on dates every time? Am I overreacting?",2,1770209204.0,kyamaamlalegalhai,0,1.0,False

I will start with the most problematic part first, I am married. So if you don't want to do this, you shouldn't have to waste any more time.

I am a 32 year old guy who is on a work trip to Mumbai and I am planning to stay here for a couple of weeks.

I dont intend on spending my evenings alone walking down hotel lobbies or just meaninglessly wandering around the local roads. I need some company. Someone to talk to. Someone who can show me around. 

I am in my early thirties and most of my friends and colleagues are busy with life, kids and have moved on. And I do feel left behind sometimes. 

I am decent looking and well mannered, and I'd like to have a conversation where you feel comfortable. I like reading and spend my evenings mostly reading books or watching sitcoms. Friends and HIMYM are my guilty pleasure, but I also loved Seinfeld, B99 and The Big Bang Theory. 

I hope we can have conversations over coffee, strolling around or just casually hanging out. What I seek is good company and a chill time without any pressure. I am alone in a new city with no friends. 

I do not know what else to write? If you have any questions on your mind, feel free to reach out and I will try to answer them honestly. If nothing comes out of it, I can atleast try to make the conversation worth your time. ",1,1770209066.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

""Good."" exchange during greetings is redundant and a crutch for the socially inept.","I am so tired of this greeting. It is a pointless exchange. 9 times out of 10 the party asking ""how are you"" doesn't really care about how the other person is doing, they're merely using it as a crutch to initiate a conversation. There's so many other ways to start conversations and so many situations in which it isn't even needed.

No actual information gets exchanged. Nobody expects or even wants an honest answer. The socially safe response is to say good or fine and everyone knows the script in advance. So the whole thing becomes a meaningless ritual that just burns a few seconds.

You hear it everywhere, and the asker usually doesn’t genuinely care about the details either. In transactional spots like checkout lines, coffee shops or quick phone calls, it’s basically a politeness buffer before getting to the point. Which I can appreciate the politeness, but if the goal is just to start talking or be polite, why lean on the most overused, predictable line in the english language? It’s lazy. It feels automatic rather than intentional. I already know the person behind the register is just there to do their job, and doesn't actually care about how I'm personally doing. So why waste both of our times with the most useless question in the world? Ask me literally any other question or just scan my thing and let me leave.

There can be times when it's used properly, like when a family member hasn't seen you for a while and is checking up on you, but that's one of the few instances where it's genuine. This isn't the case in day-to-day interactions.

Despite my hate for it the exchange isn’t evil or anything like that, it’s just boring and over-relied on, especially by people who lean on it because they don’t know what else to say. Ditching it for something with a tiny bit more spark would make everyday interactions feel less like a social obligation and more like actual connection.",9,1770209052.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,20,0.72,False
1qvnkan,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1qvnkan/why_morning_anchors_matter_more_than_you_think_in/,Why Morning Anchors Matter More Than You Think in Retirement,"One of the quiet shocks of retirement often arrives first thing in the morning.

For decades, work did something subtle but powerful: it created *morning anchors*. An alarm clock. A commute. A reason to shower, dress, check the calendar, and move into the day with momentum. Even when work was stressful or uninspiring, it provided structure. It told you when the day began and, just as importantly, *why* it began.

When work ends, those anchors often disappear overnight.

In the PHASE™ framework, this challenge lives squarely in **Everyday Life**—the routines, rhythms, and structures that give shape to unstructured time. Without intentional design, mornings can drift. Wake-up times slide later. Energy becomes inconsistent. Days start to blur together. What initially feels like freedom can quietly turn into disorientation.

Morning anchors matter because humans are not built to thrive in a vacuum of structure. We are rhythm-driven creatures. Regular wake times, recurring commitments, and predictable starts to the day regulate sleep, stabilize mood, and create a sense of forward motion. In retirement, mornings set the tone not just for the day, but for identity itself. When mornings lose purpose, the rest of life often follows.

A morning anchor doesn’t have to be rigid or demanding. It simply needs to be *reliable*. A daily walk with a neighbor. Volunteering on specific mornings. A standing coffee meetup. A fitness class. Even a personal ritual—journaling, reading, stretching—can function as an anchor if it happens consistently. The key is that something meaningful waits for you when you wake up.

This is where **Everyday Life** quietly supports the other four dimensions of PHASE™.

A dependable morning routine reinforces **Purpose** by answering a fundamental question: “Why am I getting up today?” It reminds retirees that they are still needed, still engaged, still moving toward something—even if that something is small.

Morning anchors also strengthen **Health**. Consistent routines improve sleep quality, encourage movement, and reduce anxiety. The body responds well to predictability, especially during major life transitions.

They naturally activate **Activities**. When mornings have structure, days fill more intentionally. Projects get started. Hobbies don’t stay abstract ideas. Engagement replaces passivity.

And they often expand **Social Life**. Many anchors involve other people, even indirectly. Shared routines create connection without forcing it. Relationships grow through repetition, not grand gestures.

In retirement, the absence of work doesn’t remove the need for structure—it transfers responsibility for creating it. That can feel daunting at first. But it is also an opportunity. Morning anchors allow retirees to design days around values instead of obligations.

Retirement isn’t meant to be one long, unbroken stretch of leisure. It’s a redesign. And like any good design, it starts with a solid foundation. Morning anchors provide that foundation—quietly, consistently, and powerfully—one morning at a time.

Here’s the harsh truth:
Green tea isn’t useless.
Most people just consume it completely wrong.

Pouring boiling water on the leaves (kills the good compounds)
Drinking it with meals and expecting fat loss
Adding sugar/honey and calling it “healthy”
Drinking 4–5 cups and then blaming caffeine anxiety on “stress”

Better mental focus (not jittery like coffee)
Less cravings in the afternoon
Digestion felt lighter
Mild fat loss effect (very mild — not magic)
No gym. No calorie counting. Same routine.

If you’re eating junk all day and drinking green tea for damage control — it’s not science, it’s self-deception.
