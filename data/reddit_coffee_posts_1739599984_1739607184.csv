1ipwthl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CICO/comments/1ipwthl/caloric_restriction_and_sleep_quality/,Caloric Restriction and Sleep Quality,"I'm a male in my early 40's, 5'11, SW 192, CW 174, GW 170 (May reassess after hitting my goal and bring GW to 160-165).

I'm using the LoseIt app and a food scale, and the app tells me my 28 day daily average is 1634 calories. The app suggests a daily average of 1739 calories to lose an average of 1.5 pounds/week, so I've been coming in a bit under.

My activity level is set to ""Somewhat Active"" - I walk or hike a couple miles a day a few times per week and I do a half hour of core strength exercises a few days per week - nothing crazy, but I'd guess enough to not choose ""Sedentary"".

So a couple of questions - I've lost 18 pounds in 45 days. The consensus after a basic Internet search says that's too much too fast, but I'm new to CICO and am curious what those with more experience think. Is it safe/healthy?

Second, the last 2-3 weeks my sleep has turned to shit. I did have some work stress recently (which has abated), but the sleep issues started before that. Basically I go to bed around 10-11pm every night and then wake up anywhere between 2-3am, and then I'm up for 3 or 4 hours. I finally fall back into a light/fitful sleep and grab a couple more hours if I'm lucky for a total of maybe five hours a night. It sucks and it's catching up to me. 

I do drink a couple cups of coffee per day, and while I will grudgingly test phasing these out, I've read caloric restriction can increase cortisol levels, which in turn can affect sleep. My guess is this is what's happening since the biggest change in my life has been CICO. Does this level out, or am I simply not eating enough? For the most part I don't go around feeling hungry all day, I'm eating good food, just cutting back.

1ipwsrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Monitors/comments/1ipwsrx/using_oled_and_miniled_for_separate_scenarios/,Using OLED and Mini-LED for separate scenarios without conflict - The best way to have the best of both worlds?,"This is just me sharing my experience using both OLED and Mini-LED together for general computing and getting the best out of both of them despite their set backs.

My current setup includes a 34"" Ultrawide Mini-LED and a 32"" OLED 4K. I purchased both in 2024.

Burn in discourages me from daily driving an OLED however I still really wanted one. So I considered my options. I decided to buy a 16:9 monitor, even though I prefer 21:9, so that there's a major difference between each of their viewing experiences. This way I won't be at my desk thinking about the superior panel on the other side of the room.

The area the OLED would be going into I have it setup for low-light viewing. So its away from major lighting sources in a darker corner of the room.   
I arranged the area to have an arm chair and lift-top coffee table to function as a improvised computer desk. Only half of it lifts up to form a platform which is great, because I can put down static elements like a sound system on the non lifting side.  I have about 30 inches of distance because of the table size and the seat of the chair adds another 20 inches. So I can get about 4 feet of viewing distance from the back of the seat to the opposite end of the coffee table where I installed an extra-tall monitor arm. I also got an Xbox game controller too - I only use it with the OLED area to give it another distinct element.

Because of the distance I run scaled 200% and in games I use FSR, although 1080p at the distance I sit isn't all that bad FSR actually works just as good. I can't see minor details like I can at my desk. Its very enjoyable. 

Overall its a great relationship. I typically use this area for vaping and smoking weed or having a snack so I don't do it at my desk. Now I have a lot more reasons for being over here. Its real comfortable but i'd never get any work done though so its really good for consumption.

At this use rate burn in will take a really long time - I don't think ill even have to use my warranty. Its real enjoyable. Sometimes i'll just smoke a buncha weed and just run the OLED, play a game, black out the screen and relax with some music playing in the background. When I feel like looking at some 21:9 go back to my ultrawide. 

This is how I will be using OLED for the rest of my life. Its the best of both worlds. OLED as a main display for me is not profitable but as a secondary I love it absolutely. Whenever I wanna be extra comfortable I have my OLED. Whenver I want an unrestrained visage, ultrawide.

I really like reading romance novels, I like the whole concept about it, being able to immerse yourself in this fantasy world and falling in love with this mysterious man who treats you so well- better than anyone else can. 

I started reading slightly darker things, with the romances being on the villains instead of the hero’s, but still harmless stuff- until a couple years ago i read Haunting Adeline. 

I tried so hard to be into it because it was a book id heard recommendations about and this was a book genre i enjoyed right? But it literally made me so uncomfortable i had to take millions of breaks. 

the concept that this man- who helps women and children escape sex trafficking, someone who is supposedly a stout feminist and an incredibly aware man, STALKS her, and quite literally RAPES her. 

It’s not even the cute ‘oh i heard from a friend she was going to the coffee shop so i bumped into her’ it was the full on ‘ i used my money and intelligence to hack into cameras and follow you around town, i stalked you cuz you were hot, dressed completely covering my face, terrifying you, then i broke into your house, refused to speak to you and i had sex with you when the only thing you said was ‘no’’ 

I just can’t understand how that book was a ‘dark romance’ that’s not romance that’s abuse. she fell in love with him because he’s a decent man outside of the whole raping her. he didn’t woo her, he didn’t take her on dates, he rapes her and accidentally gets her kidnapped by a bunch of people who force her into sex trafficking. 
 
When he managed to find her again, she’d been raped and abused and her buyer enjoyed cutting her body. ok, so you’re expecting him to be super loving and caring right? 

No he literally grabs a knife and introduces cutting each other into THEIR sex. telling her to get over that form of torture cuz it’s actually ‘really fun’ and that she could cut him too! showing her where to cut to literally murder him

I don’t know how to describe how disturbing this book was, because this was a book written by a woman trying to come up with her version of the perfect man, and trying to entice other women into enjoying the same thing she enjoyed. So many people went online raving about how the cat and mouse routine was hot. 

How? literally what fucking part of that was hot. you can’t even say it’s like porn where the animalistic side gets turned on regardless of the context around it. this author literally wrote the context, introduced the context into sex, and literally wrote her as terrified of this stranger and asking him to please not have sex with her. how are people saying this book is anything but horrifying? 

how are we so far repressed by society that we can delude ourselves into believing this is hot. how we can then recommend this to our friends and random teenage girls on the internet.

Do you think Ice‑T ever comes home from a long day in the studio and says to his wife, Coco, “Hey, baby, check out this new record, this new song I worked on today”? And she’s just like, “I can’t right now, I have a million things going on. The grandkids are coming over, we have to watch Sophie, and we promised Uncle Jim—” Then her phone rings. She answers it, putting one finger up while tucking the phone into her shoulder. She turns back to Ice‑T. “Sorry, hun…”

She continues her conversation on the phone as she turns away from Ice‑T, her voice trailing off in the background. “We would stop by, and dinner’s almost ready… maybe later.” She glances back at him, mouthing, “I’m sure it’s great, hun,” barely audible as she disappears into the fog of the kitchen.

I bet they have one of those ’90s phones with a really long cord hooked to the wall—except this is the present day. And he’s just like, “Okay.” He turns his back and walks off in the opposite direction. But he’s actually kinda bummed because he really wanted her to hear it. How could she not wanna hear it. This song was a bout bitches and everybody luvs bitches. He walks away with his head lowered, her voice no longer reaching him.

He’s been married for, like, 30 years. I think that’s awesome. Can you imagine their 50th wedding anniversary? They invite a bunch of people over. It’s very formal. All the men gather in one room.

There’s a poster on either side of the walkway leading up to their house. On a stand on the left side is a blown‑up poster of the two of them—probably their senior prom picture from 1989 or something. And then, on the other side, there’s a more recent portrait. It’s a classic Sears‑style studio photo: Ice‑T sitting on a bench or a stool, Coco standing slightly behind him on a box or something, her hands folded neatly on his left shoulder. The background is black with neon lasers shooting through it, some stars, and probably a slight fog effect. It looks like you could roll it up towards the ceiling and swap it out for a different one. Maybe there’s even a plastic Roman marble column next to them with a big gold “50” on top.

That’s right—I’m describing their future anniversary photo. You thought I was still describing the one on the left, but no, I’m talking about the one on the right. The after. The one taken at a Sears studio during the year 2045. That’s right. I’m talking about the future.

And here’s the kicker—Sears Portrait Studio comes back. Ice‑T buys it. He becomes the CEO. He opens up 3,000,675 Sears stores nationwide and single‑handedly lowers inflation by pricing goods and services fairly. Regular people can afford to buy quality things again. Sears overtakes Walmart. His prices aren’t based entirely on corporate greed. Sears saves America. Ice‑T saves America.

I wonder if he ever does chores. Not in the future, but, like, now. Or does he just walk over to the couch, kick off his shoes, and sort of jump backward into it, landing in a relaxed, almost waterslide‑like position? His back pops, like, six times. He reaches for the remote. Can’t find it.

“This goddamn couch in my living room is 35 feet wide and 20 feet long. It’s made out of minks or something. Minks and eagles.”

He’s already lying down and doesn’t want to look for the remote. He strains his neck forward, scanning the coffee table. It’s a slab of 6,000‑year‑old tree bark, thawed out of a glacier. It’s covered in cereal bowls and random junk.

“Goddamn it,” he mutters.

He sighs, “Alexa, turn on my damn TV.”

She replies, “Okay, Ice‑T.”

And then, every TV in the house turns on at once.

“Fuck.”

A baby wakes up in the distance.

From another room, his wife yells, “Babe!”

He whispers to himself, “Goddamn it.”

But here's where it gets interesting - I've started to pay attention to what my mind gravitates towards during these moments. Sometimes it's a random task I've yet to tackle, and other times it's a creative idea that slowly unfolds. So, I'm curious, does anyone else do something similar?

She started a slanging match in our group chat when all I wanted is to tell her how I feel, but it got twisted round to her, long story short I ended up saying sorry first then an hour later she replied with a ‘sorry’ which was not good enough to me. As it was clear she had no idea why she had upset me.

I have been radio silenced for a week, she has been posting old photos of our dog asking if it is our dog and I didn’t reply. (1 because it obviously is our dog and 2 I’ve been on early shifts with no day off so I’m tired going to bed early) 

She also has been chatting in the group chat for things only relevant to my husband I don’t see the need to talk to her at all. 

Last week she is constantly ringing my husband for random stuff and then asking if I am still in a ‘huff’ with her.

Which proceeded in my husband telling her grow up and apologise properly. Husband also told her to stop getting so involved in the business, he doesn’t want to talk about it all the time etc.

She then asked if I am contributing financially to it, which I have no idea why it’s her business at all, but I’m not as I have a horse to look after and I’m saving for a new car for us both so no, I didn’t contribute or plan to contribute but I will help as much as I can, to do socials and graphic design etc.

Also told husband that she wouldn’t have dared speak to her MIL like that and husband replied saying she did not speak to you in any way it was all you. (Her old mother in law absolutely hates her btw) 

She messaged me yesterday, again saying sorry for things she obviously has no idea about, she thought flowers and cheap chocolates was enough for an apology and I once again told her why I was upset and she just replied ‘fine I’ll just but out it’s a kick in the teeth being told again why I have done wrong, you know where I am if you need help’ 

We will see how long she stops interfering with the business.

I am finally dropping the rope with her she might think she is forgiven but I am not making any effort to speak to her or reply her unless it’s really needed.

1ipwjcp,https://www.reddit.com/r/finishing/comments/1ipwjcp/rubberwood_desk/,Rubberwood Desk,"Hi guys! I’m refinishing my rubberwood desk soon. I originally bought the unfinished butcher block from Lowes a couple years back, used a wood conditioner, American walnut stain, and polyurethane. Admittedly, I don’t remember if the stain and poly were water or oil based. 

Over time, the finish was damaged in the spot where my arms rest to use my keyboard. The finish became gray, wrinkled, and gummy, if that makes any sense. 

If I had to guess, I didn’t wait long enough after the finish cured, and live in a humid area, so I probably should’ve given extra cure time. That, coupled with continued exposure to heat, skin oils, and sweat was a recipe for disaster. I use the desk to work from home and play games, so it gets a lot of stress on the finish. 


TLDR:
I want to refinish my rubberwood butcher block desk. It will be used daily. Here’s my goals:
1. A dark color, similar to American walnut stain 
2. Durable finish resistant to sweat, heat, and skin oils 
3. Ideally a low maintenance solution. I know some oil finishes require periodic touch ups. I’m not opposed to this, but obviously I love the convenience of a set-it-and-forget-it. 


Questions:
1. I don’t mind sticking with poly. If I do this, should I go oil or water given my use case and wood type? 
2. Should I consider something like Rubio or Osmo? I’ve used Rubio on my end table and coffee table with great results, but those don’t have the constant wear and tear of daily use. 

Sorry for the long read, but thanks for any advice!

I am the director of member education for a small chapter (60ish) at a small school. My best friend is our VP of member development and my governing counterpart. Right now we’re working on making big-little marches for our six newest members (COBs). The problem is with one of the potential bigs, G - she’s already got three littles!

G got her first and second little last fall, and her third little last spring. As of right now, two of the potential littles have been on coffee dates with her and have separately told us how much they want G as their big (they liked other girls too, but not as much as G.) We just cannot give G five littles as a chapter of our size, and honestly even four littles feels like it’d be pushing it. Not only would this be unfair to the other potential bigs who don’t have any littles at all, but I’m friends with one of G’s littles already, and she told me that she sometimes feels left out as a triplet because she’s just not into the same stuff that G is and that the other two littles are. She reassured me that G was absolutely not intentionally excluding her, but it’s still weighing on me.

Honestly, looking back on it, we probably should have said no to G when she wanted to be a potential big again this semester, but we were having a lot of trouble getting members to want to do it at that time. Now we have more bigs than littles, and most of the bigs don’t have a little yet. My friend and I really want to make this fair for everyone, and we understand that you can’t force a big-little connection. But I can’t see a way to make the new members who really want G happy without making things worse for the littles G already has, giving G possibly more than she can handle, & pissing off the other potential bigs.

- asks for my advice on his problems sometimes
- called me pretty once and tells me i’m kind all the time.

1ipwfj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/MortalKombat/comments/1ipwfj3/ice_t_i_have_a_question_about_him/,"Ice T, I have a question about him?","Ice T


Do you think Ice‑T ever comes home from a long day in the studio and says to his wife, Coco, “Hey, baby, check out this new record, this new song I worked on today”? And she’s just like, “I can’t right now, I have a million things going on. The grandkids are coming over, we have to watch Sophie, and we promised Uncle Jim—” Then her phone rings. She answers it, putting one finger up while tucking the phone into her shoulder. She turns back to Ice‑T. “Sorry, hun…”

She continues her conversation on the phone as she turns away from Ice‑T, her voice trailing off in the background. “We would stop by, and dinner’s almost ready… maybe later.” She glances back at him, mouthing, “I’m sure it’s great, hun,” barely audible as she disappears into the fog of the kitchen.

I bet they have one of those ’90s phones with a really long cord hooked to the wall—except this is the present day. And he’s just like, “Okay.” He turns his back and walks off in the opposite direction. But he’s actually kinda bummed because he really wanted her to hear it. How could she not wanna hear it. This song was a bout bitches and everybody luvs bitches. He walks away with his head lowered, her voice no longer reaching him.

He’s been married for, like, 30 years. I think that’s awesome. Can you imagine their 50th wedding anniversary? They invite a bunch of people over. It’s very formal. All the men gather in one room.

There’s a poster on either side of the walkway leading up to their house. On a stand on the left side is a blown‑up poster of the two of them—probably their senior prom picture from 1989 or something. And then, on the other side, there’s a more recent portrait. It’s a classic Sears‑style studio photo: Ice‑T sitting on a bench or a stool, Coco standing slightly behind him on a box or something, her hands folded neatly on his left shoulder. The background is black with neon lasers shooting through it, some stars, and probably a slight fog effect. It looks like you could roll it up towards the ceiling and swap it out for a different one. Maybe there’s even a plastic Roman marble column next to them with a big gold “50” on top.

That’s right—I’m describing their future anniversary photo. You thought I was still describing the one on the left, but no, I’m talking about the one on the right. The after. The one taken at a Sears studio during the year 2045. That’s right. I’m talking about the future.

And here’s the kicker—Sears Portrait Studio comes back. Ice‑T buys it. He becomes the CEO. He opens up 3,000,675 Sears stores nationwide and single‑handedly lowers inflation by pricing goods and services fairly. Regular people can afford to buy quality things again. Sears overtakes Walmart. His prices aren’t based entirely on corporate greed. Sears saves America. Ice‑T saves America.

I wonder if he ever does chores. Not in the future, but, like, now. Or does he just walk over to the couch, kick off his shoes, and sort of jump backward into it, landing in a relaxed, almost waterslide‑like position? His back pops, like, six times. He reaches for the remote. Can’t find it.

“This goddamn couch in my living room is 35 feet wide and 20 feet long. It’s made out of minks or something. Minks and eagles.”

He’s already lying down and doesn’t want to look for the remote. He strains his neck forward, scanning the coffee table. It’s a slab of 6,000‑year‑old tree bark, thawed out of a glacier. It’s covered in cereal bowls and random junk.

“Goddamn it,” he mutters.

He sighs, “Alexa, turn on my damn TV.”

She replies, “Okay, Ice‑T.”

And then, every TV in the house turns on at once.

“Fuck.”

From another room, his wife yells, “Babe!”

I say ok and repeat the order back to make sure it was correct and she says yes.

She keeps going off so I ask if she would like to cancel or get something else but she says no. 

When we handed her the drink she says she ordered an Americano with non fat milk, not an Americano Misto, so that's why she had to pay more. 

I offered to refund her or to make her a new one, she said no, that we should have given her what she ordered.  I explained that I did repeat back the orde and she said it was fine and that I could quickly make her a new one but she said that she was going to keep it but that we owed her a coffee on another day sometime during the week and i better give it to her or she will make a formal complaint.

1ipwcdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/engaged/comments/1ipwcdz/proposal_was_hard_for_me/,proposal was hard for me,"Hi guys. So my bf proposed today. We’ve been together for quite some time and we’re super happy and confident to be together. I knew it was coming, he was really bad at hiding so I caught on to the fact it was happening soon. He’s asked me what I envision, I’ve said somewhere private, out in nature, just him and us, and to see my family afterwards (they live out of state) So today it’s valentines we go get coffee, I start to feel nauseous afterwards, and I’m nauseous in the car on the way to our next spot which was a “hike” 
We get to these bluffs where we first told each other we loved each other, and I’m still feeling a bit sick, he insists we go out and walk to the bluff and get some fresh air, then he brings out his camera to take a self timer… I’m still feeling a bit nauseous at this point and am not really into the idea of taking pics lol. But he encourages it. ALSO, the night before - we were on a call together and I called to kinda sniff him out to see if he was doing it the next day (today, V day) and he goes “oh no, it’s just valentines tomorrow, nothing else” and I go “oh phew that’s what I wanted to hear, I really think my family should be around for it” 
Anyways back to the story, we end up taking self timer pics and in the last one he asks me to marry him. I’m bawling my eyes out - feeling so many emotions at once. 

Tbh I think I just feel a bit neglected and not considered in my feelings of nausea, and that my family wasn’t around to see after. He also left tonight to go back to his house (2 hr drive) and I’m just now alone at my house feeling bittersweet. I’ve literally felt it all today. So excited, obsessed, sad, confused, disappointed, worried he didn’t consider me. Idk I guess I just didn’t feel immensely taken care of in the little details of it, like it felt like he was so set on his plan, and kinda had tunnel vision. Like he felt like he had to do it or else he was letting himself down or people he told he was doing it that day down. When in reality I really wish he would have read the room, and not rushed it, and said to himself “hey this doesn’t feel right, she’s not feeling 100% and her family isn’t around and I have to rush back home tonight so let’s try for another day” 

I know he loves me deeply. I know I love him deeply. I know I sound very ungrateful and that I should just let it go and be happy someone wants to love me forever. But it’s hard to let go when this day will never happen again and those are the memories im stuck with. I wish I could go back in time and just tell him straight up “I don’t feel good and I want to go home” or was more firm on the fact that I wanted family near. 

I also just really wanted to feel so at peace during this sacred moment and leading up to it, but I didn’t due to nausea and anxiety about him not really hearing my desires / needs. Usually he isn’t like that. He’s usually super attentive to me. Agh it just hurts cuz it’s such a big moment. It’s so hard.

Feeling disappointed but won’t give up.,"Some backstory: I didn’t start regularly smoking until last November. My dad had been smoking before I was even born. I hated the smell of smoke and lit cigs, and never thought I would fall down the same path because of that. I felt because I made it through college without becoming a smoker that I was set for life but then life got hard lol.

I initially used smokes as a coping mechanism for whenever I was stressed. Then it became routine for me to smoke one when I woke up and had coffee, one after a meal, one before bed; It was like a ritual for me— conditioning myself into wanting a smoke after certain events. I know it’s silly but at times, I also smoked because I missed a smoker that I’m not friends with anymore. 

Anyway, this is crazy but I recently saw this Hatsune Miku joke infographic on the negative effects of smoking and was reminded of how horrible it is for you, so I resolved to quit. It’s not cool, smells like shit, makes YOU smell like shit, and makes you feel like shit. 

The first day was all right. The second day was harder than the first. I completed my third day and then saw a photo of someone smoking, and it just compelled me to want to. I didn’t think I could be so easily influenced but I just really wanted one, so I went outside and lit up an unfinished butt my dad littered in front of our house. It was relaxing. It was relieving. And then it was over, and now I’m here with the consequences. I’m not going to give up but it was a little discouraging and felt almost animalistic of me to do what I did. I do want to quit. I don’t want to become seriously addicted and risk my health and smell bad. It’s gross, even though I don’t judge. I understand everyone has their vices.

I didn’t have much more time because I know she’d ask why I’m not home yet (she doesn’t work, quit her job a few months ago and enjoying the time at home. I have some criticisms of this but it’s a different story) and I wanted it to be a surprise so I figured I’d get up earlier at Friday and get her the gift, as Thursday I physically couldn’t do that (had an important test at uni, and straight after that a wedding we both went to together). 

So comes Thursday evening, we come home from the wedding after having a great time, it’s 5:00 am, and I tell her that tomorrow morning im going to the gym, which is actually to get her the gift but I wanted to surprise her. She gets upset at that because she wants us to wake up together and have a coffee together and all that as we never do that because of work and that’s the only day we can, I try convincing her that I’ll be home before she even wakes up but I still see it upsets her so I say that fine I won’t go. I have a problem that I hate it when she gets upset at me, it really makes me feel terrible and I do anything I can, at my own expense most of the times to avoid that. 

I thought that in order to avoid her getting upset at me for ‘going to the gym’ I’d stay at home with her and get her the gift I wanted to get her the next day, and while it’ll be a day late it’ll go in smoother fashion and all good.

Well I’m a fucking dumbass. Such a fucking stupid way of thinking. Of course even when she’s upset that I left early she’ll be happy to see me come home with a gift for her. I didn’t think she even remembers Valentine’s Day so it won’t be an issue to get her the gift a day later. 

It’s Friday. I sleep a shit ton of hours as I barely sleep during the week, and I see her getting up so I want to get up with her, have some time in the morning together as I like it and I suppose she likes it too, just as I’m about to get up she asks me to stay in bed. I say I want to get up, she replies with ‘I want to get up alone’ which clearly offended me, because it basically means I don’t want you around. I get back to sleep and after a few minutes I try getting up she says that I should go to sleep as she wants her morning to be ‘calm’ I’m like wtf ? 

2 hours later I finally get up and she’s drinking her coffee (for 2 hours ?) and I ask her what was it about her not wanting me to get up? She says that she saw that I want to sleep and didn’t want me to get up because she did. I’m saying that I wanted to get up, she’s saying that I didn’t actually and that she didn’t want me to get up because of her which oissed me off because why would you decide when it’s the time for me to get up? 

Anyway I make my coffee and as soon as I’m about to sit down besides her she goes to bed which upset me even more, like don’t you wanna be around me at all? 

Anyway we have a huge fight over this as she keeps repeating that lame excuse of her not wanting me to get up just because she did.
I’m upset, she’s upset and now she comes saying that she hates the fact that she makes me upset and doesn’t like seeing me all sad and these stuff. I suggest we make some food and she agreees, meanwhile she hands me a nice gift she bought me, I say thank you hug her and explain to her why I haven’t got her anything yet… this is where shit hit the fan. 

She doesn’t like my ‘excuses’. Says that I wasn’t important enough for me and that I don’t care for her at all. I apologise over and over again. I acknowledge my fuck up and ensure her that I do care for her and it’s just been a stupid decision making on my part and I feel really terrible about it. It obviously doesn’t help and she’s upset and mad, won’t talk to me at all. I’ve tried apologising dozens of times and she says I shouldn’t apologise as that’s just who I am(as of a cold hearted fuck who doesn’t give a shit about her) which is not true. I always get her shit and always show her gratitude and compromise a shit ton of my life for her but I guess it takes a single mistake. 

I’ve tried explaining my thinking process over and over again. She still says I don’t care for her and I’d rather sleep than do something for her and it wasn’t important to me. Hours pass by and nothing. She doesn’t want to talk nor to communicate, nothing. 
While I did fuck up, I didn’t know the consequences were going to be so harsh. 

TL;DR: 
Didn’t get my gf a gift for Valentine’s Day because I thought me leaving the house would upset her, now she’s upset and won’t speak to me.

1ipw4mu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ipw4mu,The life I wanted to live,"As I sit here alone on valentines day, I reflect on my past and all my failures when it came to pursing women I was interested in. 

Back in my late teens to early twenties I would always get that *Love* feeling in my heart when meeting someone or seeing someone I found very attractive or that I liked and wanted to get to know more or pursue a romantic relationship with. Now that I’m older that feeling just doesn’t exist. Idk if it’s just age or if callousness from a lifetime of miserable failure and humiliating moments. I could tell you some brutal rejection stories. It’s not just a “no” at the bar. When it’s someone you know it can get way worse and you can end up with zero self esteem or sense of worth. That’s the long term effect of always trying to pursue relationships with people that are **out of your league** 

When I see people living the life I wanted to live in my early teens and twenties it hurts the most. I was so optimistic back then, I had such a drive because I wanted to achieve things and live the life I always wanted. That life wasn’t attainable for me though. The life I wanted is only given to the very handsome and very talented I now realize. That pretty girl at the coffee shop didn’t want me, she was dating a tall handsome white guy who was in a band. That girl in my class wasn’t feeling the same things I was when we were studying together. She was thinking about the other guy in her class. The tall good looking guy with green eyes. 

Growing up is realizing that your options are limited based on your genetics mostly. Most men just settle in life and just try to find someone nice that meets the bare minimum requirements. That drive you have when your young dies out and all that’s left are the memories of a dream that you never achieved and a life you never got to live. 

Ask any older rich man now, they would give up everything to go back and live life when they were young full of drive and hope. Before the weight of reality broke them. 

Imagine looking like these guys I posted and living the lives they had in their teens and early 20s, always being complimented by attractive women, never feeling like a fucking ugly unwanted piece of shit. 

You can go ahead and call me any buzzword you want or give me some anecdotal “actually I don’t like blah blah.” I don’t give a shit. I’m older than you and Iv lived through more, my experiences are real you haven’t lived them. So just shut your snout if you can’t relate. 

TLDR: meaningless vent from an old loser that never achieved what he wanted.

I have quite a lot of muscle to my frame so besides my neurologucal circus my body musr require a certain amount of food

Any time i eat i EAT unless im extremely dedicated not to but that is not sustainable because i have adhd and my brain craves dopamine all the time 

My brain is literally counting the minutes 24 hours a day.  So dieting is extremley difficult . I will fast throughout the day thinking im making progress then ill eat alot when i get the chance doesnt marrer if i eat small meals or nothing at all i will still have a big meal and over indulge in high calorie foods

This can create a spiral of overeating for days weeks and then i have to back track and try and lose some fat again 

I lost about 20lbs but it took me 8 months 

Despite the fact i have high t leveks and a somewhat mfast metabolism i cant ever get lean becase i have adhd and food is the spice of life at least it is for me i used to be a chef so despite being a cave man / animal i like good food.

I dont know how aome people do it they eat basically fuck all and stay lean all year round . Me i cant get below 20% without some very important goal like a gun to my head

Smaller meals 
Omad
More protein and fiber

More water
Chewing gym

1ipw04m,https://www.reddit.com/r/applestore/comments/1ipw04m/painful_apple_iphone_purchase_experience/,Painful Apple iPhone Purchase Experience,"I am a longtime (loyal) Apple customer - we're talking about being a new owner of a PowerBook 150 and then upgrading to a PowerBook 3400 with - and this was significant - a built-in 56k modem. Flash forward a couple of decades and I've come to terms that my ongoing love affair with my iPhone 8 Plus, going on almost 8 years, is coming to an end. Despite the Touch ID that I have come to love and appreciate, I can no longer depend on a phone which has difficulty providing mobile data service when not connected to wifi. Paying for a cup of coffee often takes a minute because I have to connect to the store wifi to pay with the Starbucks app. Enough! So I threw in the towel and decided to order an iPhone 16 Pro 512GB because why not have the newest thing? 

So I cobbled together some $1,500 in Amex points and put them in my online Apple account so I could just pay for it that way. It wasn't a good experience. Every time I got to check out I got some sort of issue that prevented me from completing the purchase. The website said I could pick it up at the Apple Store 3 miles from my house - the day I wanted to buy it. Just as I clicked purchase, I got notified that the item was not available but I could have it delivered same day for $9. OK, I agreed to this and paid for the delivery cost with Apple Pay. It didn't work. I tried a Chase credit card. It was declined. I tried my Apple Card. It was declined. I tried two American Express cards - all declined. At the same time, Apple was telling me to contact my bank. Huh? All my cards worked - just not on the Apple website. I tried the next day. Same. I tried again the day after. Same. I went to the Apple Store and asked if they had the phone I wanted in stock - they did. I tried to move my $1,500 in my Apple account into my iPhone wallet - it wouldn't work. I explained the issue, took out my MacBookPro M4 to demonstrate the issues I was having and they couldn't have cared less. They can't do anything they said, contact Apple support. So I did. 

I called them. The woman reassuringly told me they would help me buy the phone and that my problem with the Apple site and my online balance was being ""elevated."" I would, she enthusiastically told me, receive an email inside of 24 hours. I got it in an hour and it said to try again online. I did. It didn't work - at all. I reached out again, online. I spoke to two different people who tried to troubleshoot the problem. I was told to buy the phone with a credit card and they would work to have the money in my account transferred to pay for the purchase. Yes, I could have done that but I had - at the point - absolutely no faith that they could do what they said. As a lark, while chatting with an Apple representative, I tried to buy the phone again online. It worked. The site wouldn't let me pick up the phone at the store I had just been to 90 minutes earlier, where they had the phone in stock, so I had to have it shipped ""next day"" with free expedited delivery. OK, I chose to have it shipped to have it the next day. Nope. The screen told me the phone would take no fewer than 6-8 days to arrive. Today I got notified it had ""shipped"" from Pennsylvania and it will take, of course, 8 days from the time of the initial purchase - and from a whole 290 miles from where I live. And according to UPS, it will take them five days to get that phone from PA to me. How is that expedited delivery? Got to tell you, for all of Apple's supposed online retail prowess and the ridiculous number of personnel they have to help customers in their stores, they have some kinks to work out. I'm literally paying $1,400 for a phone and it has been a miserable experience.

Do you think Ice‑T ever comes home from a long day in the studio and says to his wife, Coco, “Hey, baby, check out this new record, this new song I worked on today”? And she’s just like, “I can’t right now, I have a million things going on. The grandkids are coming over, we have to watch Sophie, and we promised Uncle Jim—” Then her phone rings. She answers it, putting one finger up while tucking the phone into her shoulder. She turns back to Ice‑T. “Sorry, hun…”

She continues her conversation on the phone as she turns away from Ice‑T, her voice trailing off in the background. “We would stop by, and dinner’s almost ready… maybe later.” She glances back at him, mouthing, “I’m sure it’s great, hun,” barely audible as she disappears into the fog of the kitchen.

I bet they have one of those ’90s phones with a really long cord hooked to the wall—except this is the present day. And he’s just like, “Okay.” He turns his back and walks off in the opposite direction. But he’s actually kinda bummed because he really wanted her to hear it. How could she not wanna hear it. This song was a bout bitches and everybody luvs bitches. He walks away with his head lowered, her voice no longer reaching him.

He’s been married for, like, 30 years. I think that’s awesome. Can you imagine their 50th wedding anniversary? They invite a bunch of people over. It’s very formal. All the men gather in one room.

There’s a poster on either side of the walkway leading up to their house. On a stand on the left side is a blown‑up poster of the two of them—probably their senior prom picture from 1989 or something. And then, on the other side, there’s a more recent portrait. It’s a classic Sears‑style studio photo: Ice‑T sitting on a bench or a stool, Coco standing slightly behind him on a box or something, her hands folded neatly on his left shoulder. The background is black with neon lasers shooting through it, some stars, and probably a slight fog effect. It looks like you could roll it up towards the ceiling and swap it out for a different one. Maybe there’s even a plastic Roman marble column next to them with a big gold “50” on top.

That’s right—I’m describing their future anniversary photo. You thought I was still describing the one on the left, but no, I’m talking about the one on the right. The after. The one taken at a Sears studio during the year 2045. That’s right. I’m talking about the future.

And here’s the kicker—Sears Portrait Studio comes back. Ice‑T buys it. He becomes the CEO. He opens up 3,000,675 Sears stores nationwide and single‑handedly lowers inflation by pricing goods and services fairly. Regular people can afford to buy quality things again. Sears overtakes Walmart. His prices aren’t based entirely on corporate greed. Sears saves America. Ice‑T saves America.

I wonder if he ever does chores. Not in the future, but, like, now. Or does he just walk over to the couch, kick off his shoes, and sort of jump backward into it, landing in a relaxed, almost waterslide‑like position? His back pops, like, six times. He reaches for the remote. Can’t find it.

“This goddamn couch in my living room is 35 feet wide and 20 feet long. It’s made out of minks or something. Minks and eagles.”

He’s already lying down and doesn’t want to look for the remote. He strains his neck forward, scanning the coffee table. It’s a slab of 6,000‑year‑old tree bark, thawed out of a glacier. It’s covered in cereal bowls and random junk.

“Goddamn it,” he mutters.

He sighs, “Alexa, turn on my damn TV.”

She replies, “Okay, Ice‑T.”

And then, every TV in the house turns on at once.

“Fuck.”

A baby wakes up in the distance.

From another room, his wife yells, “Babe!”

He whispers to himself, “Goddamn it.”

She said she wasn’t feeling as invested as she would have liked at that point, but that we had a lot of fun, and she wished me all the best.

Even though it was still a new relationship, I was pretty hurt. We had both admitted that we really liked each other. I told her I thought she was ending things too soon and that she should give it more time. I saw so much potential for growth --- both individually and together. We challenged each other in meaningful ways, made each other laugh constantly, and I genuinely believed that, with time, it could have become something really special.

Two weeks ago, I sent a short voice message just saying that I was still dating but kept coming back to our connection. I felt like what we had was special, and I thought it was worthwhile to see if we could reconnect. I asked if she’d like to get coffee -- no response. A few days ago, I sent a short video (she loves sign language, so I included some signs) asking again if she wanted to reconnect -- still nothing.

I know the obvious advice is to move on, and I hear that. But it still stings, even six weeks later, because I truly felt like we had something exceptional and rare.

The main reason I’m posting is that she’s doing IVF on her own (which is badass), and she could either be pregnant now or getting pregnant very soon. I work in infectious disease research, pandemic preparedness, and public health policy, and I’m genuinely concerned about the current censorship of measles data. I’ve already spoken with people I care about, encouraging them to check their titers or consider an MMR booster, even if they were vaccinated as kids. The measles situation in the U.S. is serious, especially with the current anti-vaxx policies at the federal level. Given how much I care about this issue, I feel a responsibility to share it with her—for her and her future baby’s health.

That said, I don’t want to come across as intrusive or make her uncomfortable. She still hasn’t unmatched me on Hinge (which could mean nothing), but she also hasn't responded to my last 2 messages. I’m unsure if reaching out is appropriate.

Sorry for the unhinged rambling but I've been taste testing tea and coffee for two days after a 12 hours flight so I'm not at my full mental capacity.   
Tldr at the end to skip to the important stuff.   
I was in china for a month and I stocked up on tea (got something like 3/4kg of tea in total) since good cheap green tea Is hard to find I grabbed a lot of it and half a kg of ""ice mountain green tea"" ended up in my taobao chart.   ""Ice mountain"" umh cool name! Can't wait to taste it back in Italy!   

So I get my tea packages delivered to Shanghai and this tea gets delivered with insanely good packaging (aluminum bag+plastic bag+ice+insulation box+insulation+cardboard) but I think nothing of it because a bag of normal jasmine tea from the same vendor was in the same box with it and greens benefit from cold storage.   
I stuff everything in to the fridge and one week later I bring it back from china and open it: TFW the leaves are wet! Check the listing -> it's not «ice mountain green tea» it's «mountain green tea[frozen» aka green tea that gets steamed and frozen without drying and that I've basically thawed for 10 days.    

*TLDR [Start from here if you don't have time for my ramblings]:*.   
So I now own 500g of thawed frozen non dryed green tea, it tastes incredible but I'm concerned about it's storage. Can refreeze it after 10 days of it being thawed? Can I store it thawed in the fridge for a month? Can I dry it my self? (this one sounds very wrong).   
Before this I didn't even know that frozen fresh tea was a thing.   

Bonus question: I noticed that green tea temperature infusions seem to get out very little from the leaves (probably because I'm not starting from dry leaves) using boiling water gets out more but it feels wrong, is there a different way to brew this kind of tea?
Maybe I just need to use a lot more leaves considering the leaves are already hydrated.",5,1739603000.0,tea,2,1.0,False

I never really saw her as more than just a friend until this past year. She brings me coffee every day, she used to bring me food back every day on her lunch break, but now brings me food she makes at home. She literally wakes up early to make me lunch every day. She buys me clothes, and gives me really thoughtful gifts on holidays. She has gone out of her way to build a relationship with both my mother and my sister. She doesnt like being touched by anyone, but she will let me and often playfully touch me. On top of that is basically everything i could ever want and then some.
Shes a little different tho, but not in a bad way. She has a tendency of people pleasing, and is borderline overly generous to many people. I mention this because in any normal situation the aforementioned points are very obvious signs of attraction. However, due to her personality type i cant draw conclusions.
Id love any input from calling me an idiot for not acting on it (i dont want to risk ruining what we have as friends if im completely misreading this) or giving constructive advice.",1,1739602642.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

We haven't been exactly struggling financially but we just have enough for our needs and little dates here and there, nothing fancy.

A few months before, we planned to splurge a little this Valentine's - nice clothes, high-end restaurant, you get the gist. Unfortunately, we had unexpected expenses and we couldn't do that anymore. I was disappointed, but it was nobody's fault. He sincerely apologized for not being able take me out for Valentine's because I was really looking forward to it. I don't blame him for any of that. So instead, we decided  to move our celebration and to only give gifts when we're in a better place financially. 

Come yesterday, he went out to get something to eat. He came back home carrying flowers, coffee and a pastry, saying that was all he could get me for now. This sweet boy still apologized. I was crying (sorry iyakin). I didn't expect anything at all. 

The night went by and we just ate at the nearby cafe we always go to, and had midnight snacks delivered. We spent the night playing video games, reverse charades, rapping, and watching whatever we could find online. This went on for hours.

I know how money is tight for him but he really did his best to make me feel special, one way or another. I've never laughed so much and it made me realize how lucky I am to be able to love my best friend. I'm too shy to admit it to him but this was the best Valentine's day I've ever had. I just wanted to get this off my chest because I'm just so happy. 

He knows my reddit account but I'm not sure if he'll even catch on. However, on the off chance that he does see this:

Tell myself the same thing a year ago that nothing would ever be the same and I would never find love. I'm sensitive and I'm sweet and I'm kind. Sometimes too clingy but that's okay... Sometimes I need more reassurance when things get hard. I like to Enjoy my coffee and bagel in the morning. I play Xbox in my favorite games are Halo some call of duty.. monster Hunter world. I like to scroll memes..i. imagine things to be really beautiful in life... To have someone to experience all the moments that I wish I could cherish. I like photography and taking pictures. I'm creative and I like to draw. Sometimes it gets hard for me because I don't have any friends or family. But I work really well and I have a job. Sometimes I don't know where life takes me but I know I have a pure loyal heart that just gets hurt a lot. This Valentine's Day I would really like to change that. I know it's just a holiday but I believe anything is possible if I had to change my life I'd forgive all my mistakes . And if I could turn back time but I can't.  I'd like animals and pets.

For example, I go to the same coffee shop everyday, I know my barista girls there. They ask what I’m doing that day… I tell them and I get back in the car and i’m thinking to myself “WHY. You said too much.” I don’t really understand where that comes from because I know it’s not that deep and i’m sure it’s not something that’s going to be on their mind all day you know? It goes away but I feel like it just affects how I have conversations with people. I always just wish I kept to myself.
Another example, my friend is sharing an experience about her job that I’ve also experienced. We had similar jobs. I try to say how I feel about it, so she knows she’s not alone. But I just feel like I’m doing too much again. I’m trying to be relatable to have a conversation otherwise it would just be dry. Trying to share my experience so that we can talk about something we have in common… but it just gives me an ick bc in a way I feel like it’s invalidating her experience and that’s not what she asked for. And i’m just sharing too much…. but like what is that?

Am I too self aware? I just don’t know what’s going on. I’ve spent a lot of time by myself, I’m pregnant, been laid off, don’t really have a ton of friends in general but I enjoy my own company so most conversations feel so unnatural. I’m not used to a regular conversation anymore lol

Hello lovely people,

I know this isn’t Narnia, and this is a long shot, but hey it’s the internet so I thought I’d try my luck. I’m also an app user, not a desktop user here, so no fancy formatting! 

Me: I’m a well-educated, down to earth girl who loves nature, herself, and animals. I have a deep and rich inner world that is rooted in peace, beauty, and growth. Other core values are openness, growth, authenticity. I also enjoy music, poetry, and art. Health and wellness are important to me too. Not in a “Let’s go on a trendy retreat for a vacation to meditate, eat clean, and relax for a week” only to return to the daily grind without actually changing mindset, beliefs, or behavior. I’ve read the books, listened to the podcasts, and completed the personal development programs and actually applied them in my life for real tangible results — namely more alignment and flow, as well as being mentally, emotionally, spiritually, and financially sound and stable. I enjoy cooking, not enough as a hobby, but enough to not rely on takeout or meal deliveries. I also enjoy rest days at home where I sleep in, shower, make breakfast (eggs, pancakes, and pour over coffee). Getting some cleaning, tidying up done. Doing something outdoors and a quiet night in. I’m mindful of all things I consume including media and don’t have much a social media presence. I also don’t like horror, true crime, or anything with excessive violence or gore. And I don’t watch or listen to mainstream media or news outlets. 

Physically, I’m about average in height at 5’4” and hwp at 120 lbs. I’m active and have a lean/athletic body type. Long dark hair, dark eyes, nice smile, light tan skin tone. I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, skiing, SUPing and just tried pickleball! (though I used to play tennis in high school so it’s weird to me hitting a hard shell ball that doesn’t really bounce, lol) 

You: Also well-educated, active/athletic, self-motivated and enjoys learning and growth. Also mentally x financially sound and stable and emotionally connected and intelligent. More importantly, you no longer live out of fear, meaning you’re not doing things to fill the “not good enough” void or to “prove yourself” but instead practice intentional living. You are not simply surviving but are learning to thrive. You enjoy solitude and your own company as well as quality time with people you care about. You understand that your inherent worth isn’t tied to the matrix framework of meritocracy or consumerism and your self-esteem does not fluctuate based on external factors. You do not use kindness as a self-serving strategy whether to gain likability as a people pleaser or access to the gates of Heaven in hopes of salvation. If you’re maybe hoping for a romantic connection, I find myself leaning towards conventionally attractive men with unconventionally big, strong, gentle hearts and small egos. Caucasians and men of lighter skin tones (I’ve no idea why and the feminist in me is cringing a bit haha, but it is what it is) clean shaven to light stubble, (not a huge fan of beards), nice hair, a nice smile, about 5’9” or taller. I don’t like artificial fragrance so cologne or strong smelling hair product would be a turn off, as well as smoking, and routine consumption / usage of alcohol, cannabis, or other recreational substances (hard pass). I have some old fashioned values I guess relative to what’s considered standard and mainstream nowadays. I’m also a purist. I drink my coffee black and like my people clean and sober. 

If you’ve read this far, bravo! And if you think we might make good friends, I’d love to hear about something you always wanted to do, was scared to do, but eventually found the courage and conviction to do. Or a time where you put yourself outside your comfort zone. Or what self-care means to you.

1ipvgeu,https://www.reddit.com/r/dementia/comments/1ipvgeu/my_mom_has_chemo_brain_dementia_and_i_dont_know/,"My mom has ""Chemo Brain"" dementia, and I don't know what to do.","I don't know if this is the right place for this post, or if it is better suited for a cancer sub. But, I think you all may have more practical advice for me. If not, my apologies. (And I apologize in advance for nearly writing a novel.) 

TLDR: See Title

My (44F) mom (73F) was diagnosed with late stage ovarian cancer last fall. She had a different type of cancer about 10 years ago, so I thought I knew what to expect. I assumed she would be very sick and very weak, have a difficult time caring for herself, and need help with self care and housework. My husband and I live about 40 minutes from her, so we all agreed I would move in with my mom to help while she was going through her treatments. (Important note: I am an only child, and we don't have any close extended family in the area, and my in-laws live over 4 hours away.)

Well, this time has not been like last time. Physically, my mom feels good. She gets up, takes care of herself, eats well, doesn't have any pain, does light housework, and will occasionally go out for short periods of time (but only if and when she wants to) besides to her health appointments. The problem is her mental status. It has completely changed. Her doctor says it's ""chemo brain"" and will likely go away, or at least improve, when her treatments end, but it is manifesting like dementia, and I'm at a loss. 

Prior to diagnosis and treatment, my mom often had trouble finding or saying the right words while she was talking. She knew what she wanted to say, she just couldn't get it out. She was still sharp as a tack, and it was frustrating. She saw her PCP about it, and he wasn't too concerned, but he tried her on a couple different medications, neither of which worked. 

Now she's very confused and forgetful most of the time. She keeps forgetting I'm her daughter. She's forgotten I got married almost 9 years ago, and that my husband and I bought a house 5 years ago. She is completely disoriented to time. She has no idea what the date is, what day of the week it is, whether it's day or night, whether something happened earlier that day or a week ago. She doesn't remember her birthday. For 14 weeks, we've gone to the same room at the same hospital on the same 2 days of the week at the same time for the same procedures. But she doesn't remember any of it, and every time, it's like the first time we're going there. And there are other daily life things she struggles with too. She knows how to make a phone call on her cell phone, but she doesn't remember how to do anything else on it, even though she used to constantly read, listen to audio books, text, and play games. She doesn't know how to use the TV remote anymore. She doesn't remember what drawer the silverware is in, even though it's been in the same place for 30 years. 

And she does random weird things. One morning I woke up, went downstairs, and found my purse laying on the couch with the entire contents spread across a TV tray, an end table, and the dining room table. Apparently she was awake at some point during the night, but she didn't remember doing it. One day, she put a can of soda in the freezer, which I found (exploded) 2 days later. One morning she woke up before me and decided to feed her cat, which is a task I've taken over. When I got up, I found the cat's food in his bowl, mixed with an obscene amount of coffee grounds. Fortunately, it looked like the cat had the good sense not to eat much if any. And today, I took a brief nap, and when I woke up, I found her eating Brown Sugar Splenda out of the bag. She said she thought it was some type of cookie, because there was a picture of a cookie on the package. 

I'm trying to do the best I can to help her out. I bought her a big, easy-to-read clock that has the Time, Date, Day of the Week, and what part of the day it is (pre dawn, morning, afternoon, evening, etc) with a picture of the sun and moon that changes throughout the day to illustrate what part of the day it is. I bought a big white board that I write what we are doing today and tomorrow on it. I've labeled drawers. I drew a picture of the TV remote and labeled what each of the buttons does. Nothing has helped. I thought maybe she was having trouble reading or comprehending, but I tested her, and she still seems okay in that area. Maybe she just forgets to look? 

This is exceptionally frustrating for me because I'm the only one available to care for her. I have my own chronic health problems to deal with and doctor appointments to go to, and I work a part time job, which I need to keep to help my husband and me pay our bills. I haven't worked there long enough to have any FMLA, and they are being extremely understanding when I need to take a day off here and there, but I can't make that a habit. I'm always exhausted. All I do is work, take my mom to all her appointments, answer the same questions from her over and over again, and sleep. My husband and I talked about getting someone in a couple hours a week to give me a break, but half the weird stuff she does, she does at night when no one would be there anyway. I know 100% that none of this is her fault, and she's not doing any of this on purpose, but I still can't help feeling angry and frustrated and like I have no patience, and I hate feeling this way. 

I also miss my husband. We've been living apart for 3 1/3 months, and my mom's getting chemo for at least another 4 weeks. At some point, she's supposed to have surgery, but we don't know when, and she'll need me even more then, but then she's going to get more chemo after she recovers. But I want to go home. My husband drives down to my mom's house every night after work so we can have dinner together, but he's reaching a breaking point too. And we have no idea how long this will last. If we knew it would be permanent, I'd be looking at assisted living facilities. But I'm not going to move her out of her house if we don't know whether or not she'll get better. Plus, being so confused, she gets paranoid and slightly aggressive when she's not in her familiar surroundings. And for numerous reasons, her moving in to our house is, very unfortunately, not an option. 

I don't know really know what I'm looking for here. It's after midnight, I can't sleep because of all the stress, and I'm exhausted. This is literally taking its toll on my physical health in very measurable ways. Part of this is me venting, and part is looking for any ideas to help my mom, my husband, and/or myself cope and deal more effectively with the symptoms. (And yes, I know that I desperately need therapy, and I really want to go, but I have absolutely no time or energy to do it. And I am very well aware of ""caregiver fatigue"", but I don't know what else to do, and I don't feel like I have any other options.) If you read this entire post, thank you. My best wishes to all of you. ",7,1739600876.0,dementia,1,1.0,False
1ipvgcr,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1ipvgcr/calcium_what_am_by_i_getting_wrong_uk_based/,Calcium - What am by I getting wrong? UK based.,"So I am a woman in her early 30s, with two children. Obviously calcium intake is massively important for me. But I cannot figure out how to hit my daily recommendation for calcium without going well over budget for my calories. I need about 3 cups of milk a day, apparently. 

I guess the main problem is I cannot abide fat free yoghurt or reduced fat cheese. The artificial taste reminds me too much of my slimming world days, not to mention the texture. I also don't really like milk by itself and I don't drink tea or coffee. Method of choice would be in hot chocolate with proper melted chocolate, but obviously that's not helpful. I've considered taking a supplement, but my research seems to say there's not that much evidence they are absorbed properly. 

Do I just have to suck it up and deal with the low fat/reduced fat alternatives? Or is there a trick I'm missing. ",2,1739600871.0,loseit,3,1.0,False

His office is in Fairport, and we’re hoping to live within ~25 - 35 minutes of his work. East of the city in the burbs. We’re staying in temporary corporate housing for 30-60 days. During that time, we’ll be touring local apartments. Does anyone have a suggestion on places to rent from and places to avoid? We have 2 cats. :) 

Speaking of cats, does anyone have any recommendations for a veterinary? Is there a local emergency vet hospital? 

My husband and I are early 30s, married for 2 years, no kids on the horizon. We’re not big on going out necessarily. We do enjoy getting takeout. So I kindly ask for your favorite restaurants! We’re into Mexican, Italian, Japanese (not the biggest fish people), and American bar food is fine. We love local coffee shops and breakfast spots. 

Last few questions. 

What’s the grocery store situation like? Lol I like to cook, and wanna make sure I’m going to the right spots. 

How are the dispensaries? Do you have a preference? I mostly smoke cartridges and edibles. 

How’s the public transit? Boston’s is a mess, I avoid it as much as I can.

Lately as I brew my coffee, it makes my tummy hurt. It snaps me back to the turquoise handmade mug I got for her, which we both watched slip off the hood of her Subaru and crash into pieces on the cold grey cement garage floor. She felt awful and I laughed to let her know I didn’t mind.

I’ve had it for years. She brought it back to me as a thank you for watching her house while she was in Hawaii with the guy who eventually became the father of her children and who eventually drove us apart.

It’s also handmade pottery. One of those excellent mugs that hugs your bottom lip like someone cast the mold from your face. Like it was made especially for you. It’s always been in heavy rotation, and I have enjoyed it for more than a decade — nearly twice as long as our friendship lasted.

It’s carved in the texture of a pineapple, bright golden yellow with brown detail and a lovely imperfectly shaped kelley green lip. You can fit your whole hand in the handle. It’s perfect. But, for some reason, 7 years after she let our beautiful bright and empowering friendship bleed out without giving me a reason, now it stings to hold.

I imagine her stopping in a local artist’s studio, probably wearing a flowy linen dress, and picking it out just for me. Spending her hard earned dollars to make it mine. Wrapping it with care for the flight home. Feeling the joy of delivering the perfect gift when I opened it. And I imagine her later ignoring my incessant calls and texts, each growing more desperate for a return as the days turned into weeks and then months with no explanation for why I was dropped like the mug I brought home to her. Smashed to pieces. In silence.

It still hurts, all these years later. I still love her and I still can’t forgive her. Her explanation and apology arrived long after I’d finished laying the final brick on a massive wall around my heart. It was too late. I’d moved on from missing our daily chats. I was exhausted from heartache and couldn’t muster the strength to prioritize her feelings over mine. She even had her husband call me and apologize. I told him I hoped she’d stop being mad at him because he called. I told him he may have stuck the knife in, but she let it bleed out. And although I’d also considered him my friend, the thought that she didn’t care enough to pack the wound was too much to bare.

I have this mug that I loved for years because it was rare and cheerful. Now, in the peaceful quiet mornings, instead of warming my hands and lips with a jolt of welcome energy, it’s full of icey sharp reminders of one of the most painful heartbreaks I’ve ever experienced.

I wonder why now the mug is no longer mine to enjoy, but again hers to deliver pain. I think I’ll smash it on the garage floor.",1,1739600090.0,PoetryWritingClub,1,1.0,False
