1hllgdv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1hllgdv/my_friend_again_embarrassed_me_now_what_to_do/,My friend again embarrassed me now what to do? ,"About me - I am female pursuing master's degree.

In my batch there are only 8 people (not so popular course) and only 2 girls. 
Let's call other girl Amy.
What happen is the amy is extremely agressive, she did admit she was even more agressive during her bachelor year's. Which is why people are vary from her. 
This thing I didn't know before hand but anyone who know her always warn me not to get too close to her, even her diploma friends who is like her best friend (she claims).
She is also from rich political family background with money and aspire to become one in future. 

But her trades are huge pickme like other girls are jealous from me and girl's are all drama and all ( but no one in college seems to genuinely like her, before I thought her as tomboy I had one tomboy best friend, but she isn't like her ).  Because of her treatment others also acted like this, but not in extreme way since they are guys, they won't be loud but they will join & all will gang up on me like I did some grave sin. 

She always have a way to embarrasse me, especially when she is in panicking mode, since I am the youngest in class & she always try to put me in spot or pick on me. She do try to with others but other's are older than us one is her friend so she can go on full rampage on them.

Yesterday they ( her and rest of others)  made a plan without informing me that they are gonna file offical complaint because they got unfair marking, but none of them care to tell me. 
I went to sign for another subject but another teacher was also there he asked me to sign, he then told me to sign for others, but then I refuse, and said  let me call them sir they are here. At that time I didn't knew why others haven't sign since they live nearby college and it has been 5 days since teacher asked to sign, I was confused. Yes I was absent this whole time. Teacher ask me again to sign and I again refuse then teacher pressurized me to do, let me tell you there were other teachers too senior prof. So I felt pressured and did it.
Since no one informed me about their plan of official complaint they all were mad at me because I signed & I was puzzled.
Then they told me they were about to go for complaint but what I can see, they were just sitting and doing absolutely nothing. They said since you got good marks ( no I don't I did best I deserve better, even  I said this to prof. But he then brush it off) 
All off them kept changing their statement, about complaint. 
Let me tell you I have signed two times for them, because they just don't want to go, and prof. Kept calling me so I thought this is no big deal. And they never made a puss about this before.

Guess what this time it's a big deal because they got bad marking.
 let me tell you before this, when I got picked by two prof.  but my batchmate did absolutely nothing, they speak up when damage was done. At that time I can see the joy in their face because I got just passing marks. 

One teacher has history on picking on other girls and this time both me & Amy were target 🎯 and was failed, since before offical marking teacher send the marks & I was furious, amy was panicking.
 Instead of coordination with me & stick to the plan to talk the teacher together,
 think what to do, how to tackle the situation Amy went ahead and  came back crying from teacher cabin & I was shocked, I was like a fool I am waiting for her, and she did this because of some else other guy told her to go alone and try to make situation better for her.
 I felt betrayed this isn't frist time, she has done this many times. So I went to solve this problem alone and was successful. So I saved both of us getting back in subject.

But because of her foolishness she got back in another subject when I told her to talk to teacher and try to sort this she told me not to give her ""gyan"". And this is how she got back. Teacher was somehow in mood to give pass her but Amy was too proud ( Amy did something stupid during class).



Back to present So I signed and have no idea what everyone is planning or thinking from 5 days like they can give me a simple text don't sign of that prof. ask. They all gang up on me especially Amy went too far 2 junior and one Assistant was their she lashed out at me like a shit, yes she yelled at her top of the lungs. Infornt of others and didn't think at all. Others also kinda fuel to the fire, they said you aren't sorry, I said sorry I had no Idea it's my fault. But then again again repeating some things. 
Then I said it's not my fault you guy's always do this never tell me or inform anything and I always standing like a fool and make me punching bag. 
I knew they do this on purpose several times to make me feel small. But I ignore ( I know I am stupid, but there are also handful of people in class so interaction can't be avoided) 
They go beyond yes all of them Amy most, after confronting them I was tearing up but still they all go on. None of them care to stop Amy yes non of them, I started tearing up even more. And in rage throw my bottle on floor. The assistant was there who they came and tried to make me leave the room. I said I didn't started any yelling and all this you should tell them, yes he can't say this to them, I already know. I was crying like a shit yah no one care about me I know, I knew scene was pathetic,
While she was shouting our Assistant prof. came in front of him she continued like I am not afraid from anyone like I just don't say anything to teachers like bla bla she wanted that prof. Should hear which made me cringe and I stopped crying. Prof. Left the room as soon as possible. 
I can't leave the class since I was on work we have to submit the report. After a while Amy tried to reconcile I can't do anything at that time my body isn't in good health Injave health issues when I told her to stop that my heart is pounding like shit, she didn't hear ( I was trembling, that was terrible) 

I don't want others to know anything of this, I try to keep this in class but Amy is all drama. While report was printing ( our college has small printing shop ) they all started same topic in front of everyone, printer wale log, juniors, guards, in loud tone. They all always say how I am loud but they were like a speaker  everyone wants to hear drama so everyone was there literally turn and was listening yes, none of them were hiding. 
Amy started you should grow up and bla bla, this is your age how you gonna marry Insiad stop this topic Or I would do something,
 But then others join in and kept that conversation. I really want to leave but there was no option, since report jaldi se submit Krna tha. 
I came back literally crying. 

Amy called me this time I knew who told her, one of the oldest in our batch, he & Amy was last because everyone left the room including me at the same time. He might have talked to her, but he didn't try to stopped her that time when she was shouting or embarrassing me. 
I don't want anyone apologise, Amy and others always do this I don't want to accept any apologies. 
Amy tried to call me two time I didn't pick up and others are again trying to bluff off this incident  again. As they are trying to make joke off today was weird day and all in the group chat. I am not gonna see or pickup the call for sure. 








IF YOU WANT LITTLE MORE CONTEXT THEN YOU CAN READ THIS:-


I have shared one of her incident before on reddit everyone told me she will do again. So I kept my distance from her almost 70% of time, but can't avoid her since we are in same  space, she never apologise and try to get something for me( want to win over by money) 
I have always refuse any offering. But then they try to insist atleast have coffee or something from canteen ( I hate canteen food I would be rather be hungry then eating there) 
So I also simply pay in canteen sometimes. 

I always help my Batchmates regardless of any fight or anything, even I have stopped my work for them and helped them, but guess what they were happy because I gave average presentation, I had made my ppt on time but they don't, & Luckly prof. Didn't took any class for straight 2 week. So I do forget content of my ppt. They ask my help I helped them instead of revision &  I gave medicore presentation verbally ( I agree this is my stupidity I should have mind my business or simply left the class) They were very happy like OMG you gave bad presentation and all. I have always gave best presentation and even my HOD praised me I topped in her class both internally and externally. 

But there is a problem I am little pushover person not gonna lie, had terrible childhood problem. Was a big pushover before but now not that big one.

She once gave terrible presentation when I told her this is not gonna be acceptable by prof. It was a huge research project not a easy one. At that time she said I should mind my business not to boss around but then she got bad marking and blamed me for no reason & said I didn't helped her or took her side ( like what side?) she created a huge fuss & was going on and off on that topic for no reason  and was shouting on me like a dog yes that was terrible and said bad words in canteen. After that she apologized, someone else told her to do so or made her realise it. 


But the problem is I will help her but then she will not as well as other's, if I ask any help their reaction - you don't know you are the smartest and all the things but will never tell me until it is very late. Because of her the canteen wale also acted rudely to me like they literally ignored me but after few days they went normal. Once again she embarrassed me in front of juniors and print shop wale log by saying something like ohh you were so smart you wrote this wrong, and said some more things not onec but multiple times, since then they all also acted rudely except one guy who is young. Rest other acted very rudely.

Basically they all are mad at me because I have done my project on time & senior professor's are impressed from me. I knew I will get good marking can't be topper because co-ordinator have one favourite child ( but I don't care,  all I care about if I have put my efforts so I should get my results. 



I knew they purposely don't want to tell me information or work and other stuff, they want to complete their work first and want me to give in last so they all pretty much ignore my any request or will simply say I nagg too much , what nagging just simply tell me it will not even take 5 mins. But they want for them I should drop my all work and do for them. One even went on saying others how I am not helping him like wtf I can't write your report it's impossible the topics are different and it took me 2 months to complete half of my report how can I do in one day.
Finally everyone does told him this is impossible you have to work, yah again this person,he didn't believe me.

They got less marks this semester last time I got the lowest because of one teacher he gave me in 50's but gave other in 80's or 90's the reason you wasn't present their when I was marking or inputing in laptop, nobody told me that, so I had no idea.

No one helped me, or even said anything to teacher like it's me who did the most.I feel like a shit, I did best work and got lowest even my family was going through from big medical crisis. Because They were happy for themselves. They even try to joke like how they did not great still got good. 
They went or try to do something next day went marks were input by Exam controller sir. He told them it has been officially done on portal now can't be change.


I feel like a shit like how I end up between such people, my bachelor's batchmate were best we always stick together, happy for other, encourage other, never do this kinda of shit, and more, have amazing memories with them but here these people are insecure & jealously have superiority complex and especially Amy definitely not a good friend since she publicly kept humiliating me.

Let's face it, the humble table is often overlooked, but it's the unsung hero of our workspaces. After years of backaches and eye strains, I decided to upgrade to an ergonomic table. And boy, was it a game-changer! Let's dive into my personal journey and ergonomic table review, because if it worked for me, it might just work for you too.
  
  
## The Wake-Up Call: My Old Table's Downfall

I never thought a table could be the source of so much heartbreak. Seriously, my old table was like a bad relationship—high maintenance, full of drama, and, frankly, just not good for my health. Every day I'd sit down to work, and within an hour, I'd feel the telltale signs of doom creeping in: the back pain, the neck strain, the oh-so-fun eye fatigue. It was like my body was sending me an SOS, and all I heard was the incessant clacking of my keyboard.

Can you believe I used to spend eight hours hunched over this rickety piece of furniture? My posture was like a question mark, and I’d sometimes wonder if I was auditioning for a role in a circus as the “Hunchback of Productivity.” I’d catch my reflection in the window and cringe. I looked like a character out of a cartoon—eyes glazed over and a back that resembled a pretzel.

I remember a particularly dreadful day when I had to get up and stretch every 30 minutes just to feel human again. It was a cycle of discomfort that left me unproductive and irritable. I started daydreaming about my dream table, one that would support me in my quest for productivity and comfort. Little did I know, I was on the brink of making the best decision of my work-life!

## Aha! The Ergonomics Epiphany

It hit me like a ton of bricks one afternoon while I was bent over my cluttered desk, typing away like a caffeinated squirrel. My neck ached, my back screamed, and my legs begged for mercy. It was a real “Aha!” moment. I sat back, rubbing my neck, and thought to myself, “Why on Earth am I torturing myself like this?” Ever had one of those days? You know the type— when you feel like you’re on the grim path to becoming a permanent office troll.

I decided then and there to dive into the world of ergonomic furniture. I mean, if I was going to spend hours typing away and staring at a screen, I might as well do it comfortably, right? I started researching and stumbled upon a treasure trove of information about ergonomic tables. It felt almost like opening a book and discovering that I had been missing out on the secret to a backache-free life. I learned about how these tables are designed to keep my body aligned, to help my posture, and even boost my productivity. 

Suddenly, I was more excited than a kid in a candy store— I was ready to transform my workspace! Who knew a piece of furniture could change my work life so much? It was a total game changer. So, I dug deeper, eager to learn how to turn my little corner of the world into a comfort haven.

## The Great Ergonomic Table Hunt

Finding an ergonomic table is like hunting for a unicorn; it sounds easy until you're knee-deep in options that are overwhelming. Let me take you through my epic quest, one filled with questionable online reviews, and a bit too much coffee consumed. 

First up on my list were features. I knew I needed height adjustability. Standing all day is as annoying as a pop quiz, and sitting for too long makes me feel like a pretzel. So, when I found models that raised and lowered smoothly—oh, that was music to my ears! 

Next came desk space. I envisioned my workspace, cluttered with notebooks, snacks (don’t judge!), and what seemed like the entire art supplies aisle. I wanted a table wide enough to accommodate my chaos without looking like a tornado hit it. Quality was also a must. I wasn't ready to hear my desk creaking like an old horror movie every time I leaned in to grab my third slice of pizza. 

Good materials can be the difference between a sturdy table and one that waves goodbye after a month. I dug into some research, followed forums, and even consulted my friend who’s a woodwork wizard. Frankly, I wanted my ergonomic table to be my dependable sidekick, not a flimsy one-hit wonder!

## The New Arrival: Setting Up My Ergonomic Table

Setting up my ergonomic table felt like I was preparing for a grand adventure—one that involved countless screws, an Allen wrench I could barely locate, and a mild existential crisis. I opened the box and immediately encountered a confusing patchwork of parts that looked like they'd thrown a dance party in shipping. I mean, who knew a table could have so many components? 

First off, I laid everything out, hoping it would be like one of those puzzles where all the pieces somehow fit together when you stare long enough. Spoiler alert: it didn’t. The instructions were more like the cryptic messages from a mysterious riddle that require you to find the meaning of life. Seriously, even my cat seemed confused by my growing frustration. I could've sworn he rolled his eyes at me.

I started stacking the legs on the tabletop, but they seemed to have other ideas and kept wobbling like they were trying out for “Dancing with the Stars.” So, I took a deep breath, reminded myself that I wasn’t building a rocket here, and adjusted them. After a few fits and starts—not to mention an accidental thunk on my foot—I finally got everything in place. Victory! I plopped down in my chair, and just like that, I had a newfound respect for flat-pack furniture and an insatiable craving for coffee. Did I mention I spilled some on my new table? Oops.

## The Magic of Adjustability: A Day in the Life

It's amazing how something as simple as an adjustable table can make such a huge difference in my daily routine. Seriously, it feels like device wizardry—like flipping a switch, and poof, my workspace transforms to fit my mood or, you know, my remaining sanity. 

Let me take you through a typical day. Morning arrives, and I'm feeling all sorts of productive (or maybe it’s just the coffee kicking in). I start off working while standing—trust me, nothing sparks motivation quite like a good stretch. I crank the table up, and suddenly I’m ready to conquer the world! Standing keeps my energy levels high, and my legs happy. Plus, I can bounce a little when I listen to music…don’t judge!

Come lunchtime, my back begins to whisper sweet nothings about sitting. So, I lower my table to the perfect height for my comfy chair, plop down, and get back to work. It's like switching gears from a sports car to a nice, plush sofa. I can even adjust the angle if I want to type while leaned back. 

Of course, there are days when I'm feeling a bit lazy—who isn’t? On those days, I allow my table to sit at armchair height and grab my laptop. I sprawl out on the couch like a cat planning my mid-afternoon power nap. Adjustability has turned my workspace into my personal playground. Who knew work could feel this good?

## The Final Verdict: Is an Ergonomic Table Worth It?

It's hard to believe how much a simple desk can change your life. Seriously! Ever since I made the leap to an ergonomic table, I’ve felt like a million bucks, minus the actual million bucks because, let’s face it, my bank account is more of a five-and-dime right now. But I digress. 

First off, my back, which used to sound like a creaky old door every time I stood up, has transformed into a smooth, gliding mechanism. I mean, I still have my moments (what happened to my other sock!), but overall, I can sit for hours without feeling like I need a chiropractor on speed dial. Who knew I could actually enjoy working for hours without feeling like I’ve been contorted into a pretzel?

Read more: <https://tedsadvice.com/ergonomic-table-review> 

Not to mention productivity! I’ve noticed I can focus better (unless I’m daydreaming about pizza again). My workflow feels smoother, like butter on hot toast. I’m not saying I’ve turned into a workaholic, but let’s just say my to-do list shrinks faster than a marshmallow in a campfire. 

In a nutshell, if you’re wondering whether an ergonomic table is worth it, take it from someone who spent too many hours hunched over an old table - the answer is a resounding yes! You might just find your new best friend in those sleek designs.

I've never come across so much kindness as I have today from the guy who picked me up and took me 3 miles down the road, Andy the engineer who took me across the north and midlands and gave me a free coffee stamp card for a petrol station to the lovely staff at the service station who gave me a free hot chocolate when I had a conversation with them and told them I'm staying the night here. 

I had so much laughter from people signing me to f off and people awkwardly smiling refusing a ride and people honking at me... had a blast of a laugh with Andy the engineer... he cracked some good jokes.

Opinions welcome!,"FSo I am a FTM to an almost 16 weeker, 4 months on 1/7. I have had major PPA/PPD postpartum which has (FINALLY) improved. It has been contributed to by my past mental health (bipolar/anxiety/MDD diagnoses) as well as the lack of sleep that comes with a newborn, my baby having his first fall at 5 weeks, AND having to deal with stupid issues like oral ties (tongue, lip, cheeks) and torticollis (URGH.. I could rant about how annoying torticollis is as a whole with development, but I try to be optimistic!) ALSO, the lack of support as well as criticism from fiance+ his family hasn't help, but that's a WHOLE different post/rant..!🫠 I still have days in which I miss my old life pre-kid (a few times a week but no longer daily anymore/no longer in tears several times a week) i.e. Sure, I miss being able to get things done so much more easily i.e. showering, laundry, shopping, cleaning, doing recreational activities to be sane, doing things more on a ""whim"" basis on my own time. Now I feel like executing grocery shopping or when to shower and do/fold laundry for example requires some level of planning and often I cant exactly shower when I want to. I do miss days of being able to relax after a long day/after being overstimulated with errands but a mom is a full time job/never stops. I miss days of being able to dress up/do my hair and put on makeup, but eventually I'll be able to look less like frumpy mom at some point😆 (hair always up/frizzy mess, simple plain tshirt+leggings daily)

 Since my son has been more interactive AND I can FINALLY tell smiles aren't just gas🥹, I started enjoy being a mom and not viewing him more as a chore/task with the torticollis excercises and all (maybe it started around week 14ish...Yes, took quite a while!!). He's not perfect when it comes to things like tracking/tummy time and he's quite inconsistent when it comes to both at his age, but I try not to obsess and not let such things consume me. The PT wants me to mention his inconsistency at his 4 month appointment which I will and see if she thinks getting his vision/hearing checked would help (He does respond happily to people's voices usually more/tracks their face, but will not turn his head toward noise/your voice if on his back) Honestly he doesn't hit the 30 minutes per day of tummy time the PT recommends at his age😅, but we try during wake windows at least for 5ish minutes. To be honest, I have noticed has been slower to meet milestones as well compared to babies I see of his age as BUT he is showing progress. Just in the past 2 weeks he has started doing new things (arms to midline, grabbing toys, started sucking thumbs, bringing toys to mouth, rolling to each side independently although he prefers the left/less tense side..) He deserves to be treated like all other babies regardless of where he is at/the challenges he faces. Thats something my therapist helped me realize when I have been frustrated about his conditions.

 I'll be honest, I am not the best at the DAILY torticollis stretches that PT gave us, but I attempt them when awake and  he's not fussy/uncomfortable. (Part of the reason, I don't do them ____ times per day/obsessively is because fiancé/his family would think I'm being too anal/they won't help doing them anyways in the first place because they don't acknowledge his issues/believe Im looking for issues that don't exist -- even though I had them confirmed by specialists) Often, I dont get through the whole stretches list or even close (I think it's upwards of 10 stretches AND doing both sides). I do a few here and there. If he starts to fuss, I stop and attempt later. I involve nursery rhymes/toys when attempting the stretches and smile at him. I won't wake him up during the day just for stretches or obsess over if I only get them done like twice a day (and not all 10 or so excercises even because its daunting at times🤦‍♀️). I know moms in a torticollis group said they'd do them with every diaper changes and at least 6-8 times a day, and it still took their baby still 6+ months for any torticollis improvement along with weekly PT, chiro etc.. BUT I stopped comparing (It's honestly depressing/makes me dread each day if all I think about is executing stretches!!). 6-8 times a day ALL 10 excercises (AND both right/left sides is just not my reality if I want to be a sane parent/enjoy my son). He also has oral excercises a OT/IBCLC/feeding specialist recommended as well but im lucky to sometimes do the 3ish minutes it takes once a day (although she was recommending at least 2-3 times and prior to feedings). He has an oral tie pediatric dentist consultation on 1/15, at a bit over 4 months which which was partly delayed due to family believing the ties weren't an issue/non existant but also due to insurance issues.

With feeling better regarding the PPA/PPD, I recently have been trying to incorporate more ""self care"" and attempting to get chores done around the house, even if its just ONE thing a day on my list - whether it be dishes washed/away, a load of laundry... Baby's fingernails clipped (WAY harder than expected). My fiancé suggested slow incorporation of self care as a way to begin feeling better as most of my pregnancy was spent depressed. I will literally run around like a mad women when my baby is asleep/napping trying to get things done (i.e. bottles washed, dishes away, laundry started). I am guilt of sometimes laying my baby down in the same room to get some things done qs well. If he seems awake/content on his play mat with his favorite toy(s), ill set a timer for 15-20 minutes and try to accomplish as much as I can while in the same room as him. Like for self care, I'll run and take 2 minutes to brush my teeth, I'll make the bed, and then Ill chug the cold coffee that has been sitting for at least 3 hours😆. If he fusses/starts to make crying/upset sounds I will go over and talk to him/see if that helps, give him a toy to see if it comforts him. If he is still upset, I'll pick him up and rock/bounce with him for a few. I always try to come to his aid regardless so I'm not ignoring him.. As a mom even if I'm trying/wanting  to get things done around the house,  I will not let him sleep more than 1.5-2 hours at any time during the day. With diaper changes, I try to do them before each feeding+ right before bed (he is formula fed and tends to eat every 2-2.5 hours recently UNLESS I smell a poo then I change him immediately.) 

Now theres the  current thought of ""Am I doing enough or too little as a first time stay at home mom for thr time being?"".. especially because he has the ""lovely"" condition torticollis that requires support in multiple ways to see improvement. It does and can cause me stress because it may impact motor milestone development. It can come across as daunting/overwhelming.. There's maybe an hour or 2 max during the day where he is asleep and I spent trying to get things done while he's sleeping (i.e. eating food, dishes, laundry, vacuuming) . And even  sometimes I set a 15-20 minute timer during a wake windows and let him be awake and play independently more- i.e. the beloved purple monkey  kick piano mat, oball, crunchy blanket, stuffed squeaky/crinkle toy.

Am I being an asshole/bad mom for letting him him have independent play for sometimes 15-25 minutes to get things done without hovering over him/being right by his side? i.e. getting him to turn head side to side, interact with sound toys, make him react in some way  positively to me singing him nursery rhymesn reading him a book, etc?.. I really do try to prioritize any chores for sleep time only.  Should I be forcing more stretches on him during wake windows? (Any idea on incorporating them more easily/naturally into the day?).. We don't have a full on routine each day (if you do with your baby of similar age feel free to share it though), but he tends to eat every 2, 2.5 on average sometimes 3 hours  and have naps adding up to maybe 3-4 hours max between 730am-10pm?.. It doesn't seem to prohibited him sleeping through the night from 930/10ish til like 630-7am. Otherwise WHEN NOT feeding, we are on his play mat, playing with sound toys, attempting tracking with contrast cards/ toys..Singing him nursery rhymes songs/listening to music and walking around the house for example showing him random things..😆

Please give me your honest opinions/insight on if I'm doing too much/too little with him. If you have suggestions on making torticollis stretches less daunting, disheartening (because sometimes he isn't really wanting to do them), etc please share.",0,1735070097.0,Mommit,1,0.5,False
1hll652,https://i.redd.it/sgydq7p3qu8e1.jpeg,How do you select the perfect gift?,"How to Select the Perfect Gift: A Thoughtful Guide to Getting It Right (maybe a little late for Christmas 2024, but..)

Finding the perfect gift can sometimes feel like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded—frustrating and unnecessarily complicated. But fear not! With a little thought, strategy, and creativity, you can choose a gift that makes the recipient feel seen, valued, and appreciated. Whether it’s for a birthday, anniversary, holiday, or just because, this guide will help you nail the art of gift-giving every time.

🎁 1. Understand the Recipient
The golden rule of gift-giving? It's not about you. Start by putting yourself in the recipient’s shoes:

What are their hobbies and interests? Do they love cooking, reading, hiking, or gaming?
What’s their style? Minimalist, quirky, vintage, or tech-savvy?
Have they mentioned anything lately? Listen for subtle hints—“I could really use a new coffee maker” might be music to your ears.
How do they spend their time? Someone who travels constantly might love travel gear, while a homebody would cherish something cozy for their space.

“True generosity lies in giving what others need, not what you think they should want.”

🎨 2. Add a Personal Touch
Personalization is the secret sauce of memorable gifts. A simple item becomes extraordinary when it’s tailored specifically for them. A few ideas include:

Monogramming or engraving: Personalized jewelry, keychains, or a leather wallet.
Custom art or prints: A family portrait, a map of their favorite city, or a framed photo of a cherished memory.
Handmade items: If you’re crafty, consider creating something unique—knit a scarf, bake a treat, or write a poem.

A personal touch whispers, “I put thought into this just for you.”

💡 3. Think Experiences Over Things
Sometimes, the best gifts aren’t wrapped—they’re experienced. If the person already has everything they need (or they value memories more than items), consider gifting:

Tickets to a show, sports game, or movie.
A spa day or wellness retreat.
Memberships or subscriptions (think streaming services, book clubs, or wine deliveries).
Adventure experiences like skydiving, cooking classes, or kayaking.

Experiences create lasting memories, and you’ll forever be tied to that positive moment in their life.

🧩 4. Solve a Problem
The perfect gift can often be something that makes the recipient's life easier or better. Ask yourself:

Is there a gadget or tool they need but wouldn’t buy themselves?
Could something practical (like a cozy blanket, noise-canceling headphones, or a kitchen appliance) improve their day-to-day life?

When done right, practical gifts can show you understand their needs and care about their comfort.

🌟 5. Be Thoughtful, Not Expensive
Here’s a truth bomb: the perfect gift isn’t about the price tag. A $5 gift that’s thoughtful will outshine a $500 one that’s generic every time. Consider:

DIY gifts (homemade candles, baked goods, or scrapbooks).
Nostalgic gifts that reflect shared memories.
Curating small items into a themed box—like a “Self-Care Kit” or “Coffee Lover’s Basket.”

Thoughtfulness trumps extravagance. A perfect gift says, “I know you,” not “I spent a fortune.”

🎁 6. Presentation Matters
The gift itself is important, but don’t underestimate the power of presentation. A beautifully wrapped gift or a handwritten note can elevate the entire experience. Use:

Unique wrapping paper or reusable cloth (eco-friendly and chic).
A personalized gift tag.
A heartfelt note explaining why you chose the gift.

First impressions count—even when it comes to unwrapping a present.

🕵️‍♀️ 7. Observe and Take Notes Throughout the Year
Keep a running list of gift ideas whenever someone mentions something they love, need, or wish for. Tools like a phone note app or a dedicated planner section can save you from last-minute stress.

🎉 Gift Examples for Every Type of Person
Need ideas? Here’s a cheat sheet:

The Book Lover: A special edition of their favorite book + a cozy reading blanket.
The Adventurer: A hiking gear set or a National Parks Pass.
The Homebody: Luxury pajamas and a scented candle.
The Techie: Wireless earbuds or a gadget organizer.
The Foodie: Gourmet snacks, a cooking class, or personalized cutting boards.
The Creative: High-quality art supplies or a subscription to an online art class.

Final Thought: Thoughtfulness is Key
The perfect gift doesn’t come from a store shelf—it comes from the heart. Whether it’s an experience, a handmade item, or something beautifully practical, it should communicate that you see the person for who they are and value them.

“The best gifts are the ones that say, ‘I pay attention to you.’”

Professional Dental Treatments: Which is Best for Whiter Teeth?
---------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a bright, pearly white smile, professional dental treatments offer some of the most effective solutions to whitening your teeth. While at-home methods can provide some results, nothing beats the power of dental expertise in enhancing your smile. Let's explore the various professional whitening options available and help you find the best one for your needs.

### In-Office Teeth Whitening

In-office teeth whitening is one of the fastest ways to achieve stunning results. This procedure typically takes about an hour and involves the application of a high-concentration bleaching gel to your teeth. A special light may be used to enhance the whitening effect. Here are some key benefits of in-office whitening:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Immediate results:** You can walk out of the dental office with your teeth visibly whiter.
- **Supervised treatment:** A dental professional ensures the process is safe and effective.
- **Customized approach:** The dentist tailors the treatment to your specific needs.

### Custom Take-Home Kits

If you prefer a more gradual approach, your dentist can provide you with a custom take-home whitening kit. This option allows you to whiten your teeth in the comfort of your home, following your own schedule. Key features of this treatment include:

- **Professional-grade whitening gel:** The kit comes with a bleaching gel that is stronger than over-the-counter products.
- **Personalized trays:** Custom trays are designed to fit your teeth perfectly, ensuring even application without gum irritation.
- **Flexible treatment schedule:** You have the control to decide when and how often to whiten your teeth.

### Bleaching vs. Whitening

It's essential to understand the difference between teeth whitening and teeth bleaching. Teeth whitening involves removing stains and lightening the natural color of your teeth. On the other hand, teeth bleaching refers to the use of bleaching agents, like hydrogen peroxide, to achieve a whiter shade. Depending on your dental needs, you may choose:

- **Whitening toothpastes:** These are effective for minor stains.
- **Bleaching treatments:** Ideal for more significant discoloration and long-lasting results.

### Laser Teeth Whitening

Laser teeth whitening is a cutting-edge method that uses laser technology to enhance the whitening process. In this procedure, a bleaching agent is applied to your teeth, followed by a laser light that accelerates the whitening effect. This option boasts several advantages:

- **Speedy results:** Treatments can often be completed in just 30 to 60 minutes.
- **Long-lasting effects:** Many patients enjoy a brighter smile that lasts for several months.
- **Minimal sensitivity:** This method typically causes less discomfort compared to traditional bleaching techniques.

### Factors to Consider

Before deciding on a professional whitening treatment, consider the following factors:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Tooth health:** Ensure your teeth and gums are healthy before undergoing any whitening treatment.
- **Stain type:** Different stains (intrinsic vs. extrinsic) require different treatments.
- **Budget:** Professional whitening treatments can vary in cost. Discuss your options with your dentist.

Consulting with your dentist is always a good idea when aiming for pearly white teeth. They can assess your dental health, understand your goals, and recommend the best treatment that suits your needs. Many people see remarkable changes after professional treatments, boosting their confidence and smile.

Remember, maintaining your results often requires some aftercare. Regular brushing, avoiding stain-causing foods and drinks, and routine dental cleanings can help keep your smile bright after your whitening treatment. Ultimately, professional dental treatments can pave the way for the stunning smile you've always wanted.

### Conclusion

Achieving pearly white teeth is a combination of effective home remedies and professional dental treatments tailored to your needs. The home remedies, such as baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, and oil pulling, provide natural ways to maintain and enhance the brightness of your smile. These methods are not only budget-friendly but also easily accessible, making them a popular choice for many. By incorporating these simple techniques into your daily routine, you can significantly improve the whiteness of your teeth over time.

On the other hand, professional dental treatments offer quicker and often more noticeable results. Options such as in-office bleaching procedures, custom trays, and take-home whitening kits can cater to various preferences and budgets. Consulting with your dentist can help you determine which treatment is best suited for your specific dental condition and desired outcome. Professional treatments may come with a higher price tag, but they often yield dramatic results that can boost your confidence and overall appearance.

Ultimately, the journey to pearly white teeth doesn't have to be overwhelming. By embracing a combination of at-home care and professional help, you can achieve the bright, charming smile you desire. Remember, maintaining oral hygiene through regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups is just as essential in sustaining the results of both home remedies and treatments. With dedication and the right strategies, your path to a dazzling smile is well within reach. Enjoy the process and celebrate each step you take toward achieving those sought-after pearly whites!

","# Where to Find AI Mode

The “AI Mode” tab will show up near the existing tabs like “All,” “Images,” and “Videos.” So next time you search on Google, just look to the left-hand side. In AI Mode, you’ll get more than just standard links. Google plans to serve up conversational answers powered by [Gemini AI](https://gemini.google.com/?is_sa=1&is_sa=1&android-min-version=301356232&ios-min-version=322.0&campaign_id=bkws&utm_source=sem&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid-media&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=bkws&utm_campaign=2024enIN_gemfeb&pt=9008&mt=8&ct=p-growth-sem-bkws&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAyJS7BhBiEiwAyS9uNcpDb_gkNr5o14txQuHIEQ2zSE_gNo_r9zbUfLWN240xX7VdcNjuhBoCEKwQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). But don’t worry; you’ll also get helpful links to related webpages right below the AI-generated response.

# How AI Mode is Already Taking Shape

This isn’t just an experiment—AI Mode is already being tested. Earlier this month, Android Authority discovered the feature in a beta version of the Google app. And 9to5Google found that you might even be able to use AI Mode to search with your voice or upload pictures for more visual searches. Imagine asking, “What is this?” while pointing your camera at something, and AI Mode giving you an answer. It’s like having an AI-powered sidekick every time you search for on Google!

# Why Now? A Big Race in AI-Powered Search

This move makes sense—Google’s rivals are stepping up their game too. ChatGPT, from OpenAI, now lets all users, including those on free plans, use its AI for searching the web. Microsoft’s Copilot and services like [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/) and [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) are also pushing similar AI-powered search features.

To stay ahead, Google has already rolled out AI summaries in search results for some queries. For instance, if you’re trying to figure out “how to make glue for pizza sauce” (yes, that’s real), you might see an “AI Overview” at the top of your results. Now, AI Mode takes this even further by offering interactive, conversational answers—all without leaving Google.

# Why You Should Be Excited

This is more than just “Google with a twist.” Think of it as blending the simplicity of typing “search for on Google” with the intelligent conversation of a chatbot like ChatGPT. With AI Mode, Google aims to make searching faster, smarter, and way more intuitive. It’s your “go-to” for everything from casual questions to in-depth research.

# AI Mode in Action: What It Means for You



* **Get Instant Insights:** Ask complex questions like, “How does this scientific theory work?” and receive easy-to-understand answers right on the Google search page.
* **Enjoy Seamless Interaction:** Have a chat-like experience for those moments when “you are AI” just feels easier than clicking through dozens of links.
* **Search Smarter with Visuals:** Use your voice or photos to get personalized and context-aware answers. No typing required!
* **Stay in the Loop:** Track conversation history within your searches, making it easy to revisit important info whenever needed.

Google is betting big on this feature—and for good reason. By making Gemini AI accessible directly from the search results page, it could bring the best of both worlds: the familiarity of Google Search and the innovation of AI chatbots like ChatGPT.

# Final Thoughts

With “AI Mode” just around the corner, we’re stepping into a future where searching is smarter and more conversational than ever. Whether it’s about finding the nearest coffee shop, learning new skills, or solving complex problems, Google’s AI-powered upgrade is set to make things a whole lot easier.

So, keep an eye out for the new search-to-Google experience. When Google adds AI to its core search, it’s more than just a feature—it’s the start of a whole new search engine era. Are you ready to try it? We sure are!",1,1735069991.0,u_shubh_aiartist,0,1.0,False

if you look at my post history, I've always had his cage full of toys and provide as much enrichment as possible with foraging mats, unlimited cardboard to shred,  half crushed plastic bottles that ""squeak-back"" when they get chomped on, bottle lids that he loooooves pelting out of a basket and enough wooden toys that would suffice for a parrot flock of five+. he's spoilt rotten, has premium food and only drinks filtered water. he also gets whatever human food he demands (it's usually half a teaspoon full anyway) and yes this includes the tiniest amount of cake and coffee/tea and apple juice (I do this for bonding, but also because I fear for my eyes LOL) judge me all you want, but a parrot sip of oat milk latte isn't gonna end his life and it's a rare (not daily) thing. all of this to say, he's my world and I want to provide the best environment for him. 

I moved three months ago into a cute (old) cottage in the middle of nowhere. no road traffic. no dogs barking. nothing. it's dead silent. just me and the hubby and the screamer. he got a brand new cage which he literally flew over to and never looked back at the old one. he has a much better set up in general, is in the living room with us all the time, and I work from the living room because it's closer to the coffee machine and converted the office into a recording studio. 

the screamer doesn't scream much anymore. probably a few times for walnuts when I've said no, and then he gets a timeout inside of his cage. he's got freedom of in and out as long as I'm awake (which are some weird ass hours right now) but at midnight, his cage gets locked and pushed back next to the radiator as we have storage heaters and that's the warmest spot in the house. 

with the cottage being open plan and his amount of freedom, he doesn't fly unless I am ignoring him (like if he's demanding something that has chocolate and I've said no and ignore him, he will fly on top of my head and watch me eat it, and then fly back when I'm done - I don't give in when I have said no) 

he has everything literally in/on his cage. his basket of fling-ables, his foraging mat, two bowls of water, his water bottle and his food (with glass marbles to stop him being picky about certain flavours), his wooden hanging toys, his boing boing which he uses as a spiral staircase, and his frustration cardboard stash to shred when he's ANGY (after I've said no more to the fourth walnut). his foraging mat has enrichment foods and nuts so he spends a lot of him on there, and it probably makes up about 15-20% of all his food which is about right on the tropi-mix foods. he starved me out on Harrisons when Zupreem had a shortage during covid (one of the few times he's won on pure willpower) and likes this one and it seems good enough. he gets fresh fruits daily, apple being his favourite, and veggies he gets from me when I'm having dinner and ""sharing"".

he's just quieter. he seems super happy, will argue back with me, will speak his mind (he says yes, no, thank you, hello in like a million variants), is very expressive generally, and does his happy whistling for about an hour a day (this is new since moving in here - he never used to whistle this much before). I'm just asking if I'm doing the right thing.. if he's not depressed and that's why he's quiet or if he's happy and that's why he's quiet. 

there's no sign of stress... no plucking, no weird poop, no strange behaviour, nada.... and I'm certain I'm overthinking but amazons ARE loud birds. he just doesn't get loud anymore. at all. unless I cut off his cocaine (walnuts) and then we have a tantrum for two mins max. 

he's okay right? can someone just tell me he's happy and chilled out and this happens with them? I've been thinking about this since we moved in and I finally just decided to write this post and have someone else's opinions... 

TLDR; my loud amazon is now a quieter seemingly happy amazon after moving into a new place and I'm just worried if it's normal.",2,1735069937.0,parrots,3,1.0,False
1hll3vr,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/1hll3vr/a_dead_womans_rosebush/,A dead woman's rosebush ,"A few days ago I was home not quite alone. My 6 year old son was asleep.  My partner and his grandmother had gone to the hospital due to her having a concussion. His sister was at work. So it was just my sleeping son, two little dogs, and myself.

There is a red rosebush next to the front porch I've been nursing back to health because it was planted by my partner's late mother, it's something I want to do for my partner and his sister, and to honor her memory. It's looking great. I had left a rose cut from it on the FRONT porch railing a few nights before. It stayed there through fairly heavy winds. 

While they were gone, I poured my coffee in a mug with a big, pretty, bold red rose painted on it, then I looked out the front door window and noticed the rose was no longer on the railing but was on the porch floor, right in front of the front door and at the top of the steps. I didn't think much of it and didn't open the door. My son was still fast asleep.

I went to the BACK porch to smoke a cigarette and drink my coffee, letting the dogs out with me. I noticed one had gotten away from my sight, probably to the road around the front. So I opened the back door to go inside to the front porch but, planning to come right back, just left it open and the other dog right there to either stay out or follow me in. The door opens inward, into a bedroom. 

I quickly walked through two rooms and opened the front door to see if the missing dog was at the road. He was, I called him and he started running around to the back of the house. But I instantly noticed the rose was gone. It wasn't there anymore. I hesitated a few seconds, looked around, noticed nothing else was off, went back inside and shut the front door behind me. This all took less than a minute, if that. My son was still asleep. 

I hurried back through the two rooms to get to the open back porch where one dog was and hopefully the other dog had gone back to. I froze when I saw the back door was closed completely, and the dog I had left on the back porch had been shut out, looking in at me. That door is not easy to shut, it basically has to be slammed or just carefully and firmly pulled shut with two hands. I just stood there a moment freaked out, staring at the dog looking in at me, my heart skipping beats, you know? Then walked toward the door, opened it, went out on the back porch and looked around, seeing nothing but the dogs. 

It really unnerved me because there is no way the dog could have shut the door. It isn't possible. I made sure there was no one else in the house. I never heard anyone, there were no signs of anyone having been in the house or outside creeping around, but that doesn't mean they weren't, you know. My son never woke up. I did tests to see if me opening and closing the front door would at all affect the back door but no, it didn't. It couldn't have been wind because the door opens inward, and that door is hard to close. The AC wasnt on. 

What made it a little creepier to me, tbh, was that before I went out on the back porch to smoke and let the dogs out that morning, I had poured my morning coffee in a cup with a big, bold, red rose painted on it and taken it on the back porch with me. 

So idk.

Once, a while back, I was relaxing on the front porch, my phone was just a couple of inches from my feet, the screen locked. It requires a PIN. No programs were running at the time. No alarms set, and I cannot set my alarms to play songs from my music program. I was actually kind of meditating, not deep meditation or anything, just relaxed breathing basically with my eyes closed, totally lucid, listening to things around me, that sort of thing. The breeze, chimes in the distance, insects. Everyone else was inside and asleep. I could literally look inside the window behind me and see my partner asleep on the couch. It was like 3 am. 

Suddenly I heard music from my phone. It was unlocked and my music program was open and had started playing a song, this song about a woman not being able to tell if she was experiencing reality or a dream, her imagination playing tricks on her, her sense of time being confused, ""showing up in the future like I've been here before."" How she could hear bells and wind and a song in her heart, like a ghost in the streets. A very intense song, and quite personal to me at the time. I was sober. 

I never found evidence of malware on my phone, but obviously I can't be sure someone wasn't fucking with me.

Anyway, both experiences were pretty unsettling to me. Maybe my phone glitched, maybe a person was creeping around last week. But my partner's mom had a very strong personality and spirit and died too young. She was wronged by her mother, the grandmother, right up to the day she died and even to this day. 

I got a thorn stuck in my finger tending the rosebush and when it finally came out, I was oddly a little sad. I've felt strangely, instinctively protective over her daughter, my partner's sister, despite us having conflict. I know that we were quite different, but in some ways quite similar, and suffered many uniquely similar hardships and were horribly mistreated/abused in many similar ways, particularly by our mothers. My son, who has a very similar personality to hers, was born just two weeks after she died. Just many coincidences that have slowly come unveiled over the years.

I really just wanted to share this, whatever any of it means, and thanks for reading.",2,1735069868.0,ParanormalEncounters,0,1.0,False
1hll3f0,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1hll3f0/am_i_doing_too_little_as_a_first_time_mom_honest/,Am I doing too little as a first time mom? Honest opinions welcome!,"So I am a FTM to an almost 16 weeker, 4 months on 1/7. I have had major PPA/PPD postpartum which has (FINALLY) improved. It has been contributed to by my past mental health (bipolar/anxiety/MDD diagnoses) as well as the lack of sleep that comes with a newborn, my baby having his first fall at 5 weeks, AND having to deal with stupid issues like oral ties (tongue, lip, cheeks) and torticollis (URGH.. I could rant about how annoying torticollis is as a whole with development, but I try to be optimistic!) ALSO, the lack of support as well as criticism from fiance+ his family hasn't help, but that's a WHOLE different post/rant..!🫠 I still have days in which I miss my old life pre-kid (a few times a week but no longer daily anymore/no longer in tears several times a week) i.e. Sure, I miss being able to get things done so much more easily i.e. showering, laundry, shopping, cleaning, doing recreational activities to be sane, doing things more on a ""whim"" basis on my own time. Now I feel like executing grocery shopping or when to shower and do/fold laundry for example requires some level of planning and often I cant exactly shower when I want to. I do miss days of being able to relax after a long day/after being overstimulated with errands but a mom is a full time job/never stops. I miss days of being able to dress up/do my hair and put on makeup, but eventually I'll be able to look less like frumpy mom at some point😆 (hair always up/frizzy mess, simple plain tshirt+leggings daily)

 Since my son has been more interactive AND I can FINALLY tell smiles aren't just gas🥹, I started enjoy being a mom and not viewing him more as a chore/task with the torticollis excercises and all (maybe it started around week 14ish...Yes, took quite a while!!). He's not perfect when it comes to things like tracking/tummy time and he's quite inconsistent when it comes to both at his age, but I try not to obsess and not let such things consume me. The PT wants me to mention his inconsistency at his 4 month appointment which I will and see if she thinks getting his vision/hearing checked would help (He does respond happily to people's voices usually more/tracks their face, but will not turn his head toward noise/your voice if on his back) Honestly he doesn't hit the 30 minutes per day of tummy time the PT recommends at his age😅, but we try during wake windows at least for 5ish minutes. To be honest, I have noticed has been slower to meet milestones as well compared to babies I see of his age as BUT he is showing progress. Just in the past 2 weeks he has started doing new things (arms to midline, grabbing toys, started sucking thumbs, bringing toys to mouth, rolling to each side independently although he prefers the left/less tense side..) He deserves to be treated like all other babies regardless of where he is at/the challenges he faces. Thats something my therapist helped me realize when I have been frustrated about his conditions.

 I'll be honest, I am not the best at the DAILY torticollis stretches that PT gave us, but I attempt them when awake and  he's not fussy/uncomfortable. (Part of the reason, I don't do them ____ times per day/obsessively is because fiancé/his family would think I'm being too anal/they won't help doing them anyways in the first place because they don't acknowledge his issues/believe Im looking for issues that don't exist -- even though I had them confirmed by specialists) Often, I dont get through the whole stretches list or even close (I think it's upwards of 10 stretches AND doing both sides). I do a few here and there. If he starts to fuss, I stop and attempt later. I involve nursery rhymes/toys when attempting the stretches and smile at him. I won't wake him up during the day just for stretches or obsess over if I only get them done like twice a day (and not all 10 or so excercises even because its daunting at times🤦‍♀️). I know moms in a torticollis group said they'd do them with every diaper changes and at least 6-8 times a day, and it still took their baby still 6+ months for any torticollis improvement along with weekly PT, chiro etc.. BUT I stopped comparing (It's honestly depressing/makes me dread each day if all I think about is executing stretches!!). 6-8 times a day ALL 10 excercises (AND both right/left sides is just not my reality if I want to be a sane parent/enjoy my son). He also has oral excercises a OT/IBCLC/feeding specialist recommended as well but im lucky to sometimes do the 3ish minutes it takes once a day (although she was recommending at least 2-3 times and prior to feedings). He has an oral tie pediatric dentist consultation on 1/15, at a bit over 4 months which which was partly delayed due to family believing the ties weren't an issue/non existant but also due to insurance issues.

With feeling better regarding the PPA/PPD, I recently have been trying to incorporate more ""self care"" and attempting to get chores done around the house, even if its just ONE thing a day on my list - whether it be dishes washed/away, a load of laundry... Baby's fingernails clipped (WAY harder than expected). My fiancé suggested slow incorporation of self care as a way to begin feeling better as most of my pregnancy was spent depressed. I will literally run around like a mad women when my baby is asleep/napping trying to get things done (i.e. bottles washed, dishes away, laundry started). I am guilt of sometimes laying my baby down in the same room to get some things done qs well. If he seems awake/content on his play mat with his favorite toy(s), ill set a timer for 15-20 minutes and try to accomplish as much as I can while in the same room as him. Like for self care, I'll run and take 2 minutes to brush my teeth, I'll make the bed, and then Ill chug the cold coffee that has been sitting for at least 3 hours😆. If he fusses/starts to make crying/upset sounds I will go over and talk to him/see if that helps, give him a toy to see if it comforts him. If he is still upset, I'll pick him up and rock/bounce with him for a few. I always try to come to his aid regardless so I'm not ignoring him.. As a mom even if I'm trying/wanting  to get things done around the house,  I will not let him sleep more than 1.5-2 hours at any time during the day. With diaper changes, I try to do them before each feeding+ right before bed (he is formula fed and tends to eat every 2-2.5 hours recently UNLESS I smell a poo then I change him immediately.) 

Now theres the  current thought of ""Am I doing enough or too little as a first time stay at home mom for thr time being?"".. especially because he has the ""lovely"" condition torticollis that requires support in multiple ways to see improvement. It does and can cause me stress because it may impact motor milestone development. It can come across as daunting/overwhelming.. There's maybe an hour or 2 max during the day where he is asleep and I spent trying to get things done while he's sleeping (i.e. eating food, dishes, laundry, vacuuming) . And even  sometimes I set a 15-20 minute timer during a wake windows and let him be awake and play independently more- i.e. the beloved purple monkey  kick piano mat, oball, crunchy blanket, stuffed squeaky/crinkle toy.

Am I being an asshole/bad mom for letting him him have independent play for sometimes 15-25 minutes to get things done without hovering over him/being right by his side? i.e. getting him to turn head side to side, interact with sound toys, make him react in some way  positively to me singing him nursery rhymesn reading him a book, etc?.. I really do try to prioritize any chores for sleep time only.  Should I be forcing more stretches on him during wake windows? (Any idea on incorporating them more easily/naturally into the day?).. We don't have a full on routine each day (if you do with your baby of similar age feel free to share it though), but he tends to eat every 2, 2.5 on average sometimes 3 hours  and have naps adding up to maybe 3-4 hours max between 730am-10pm?.. It doesn't seem to prohibited him sleeping through the night from 930/10ish til like 630-7am. Otherwise WHEN NOT feeding, we are on his play mat, playing with sound toys, attempting tracking with contrast cards/ toys..Singing him nursery rhymes songs/listening to music and walking around the house for example showing him random things..😆

Please give me your honest opinions/insight on if I'm doing too much/too little with him. If you have suggestions on making torticollis stretches less daunting, disheartening (because sometimes he isn't really wanting to do them), etc please share.",1,1735069824.0,beyondthebump,0,1.0,False

It was unlocked and my music program was open and had started playing a song, this song about a woman not being able to tell if she was experiencing reality or a dream, her imagination playing tricks on her, her sense of time being confused, ""showing up in the future like I've been here before."" How she could hear bells and wind and a song in her heart, like a ghost in the streets. A very intense song, and quite personal to me at the time. I was sober. 

I never found evidence of malware on my phone, but obviously I can't be sure someone wasn't fucking with me.

Anyway, both experiences were pretty unsettling to me. Maybe my phone glitched, maybe a person was creeping around last week. But my partner's mom had a very strong personality and spirit and died too young. She was wronged by her mother, the grandmother, right up to the day she died and even to this day. 

I got a thorn stuck in my finger tending the rosebush and when it finally came out, I was oddly a little sad. I've felt strangely, instinctively protective over her daughter, my partner's sister, despite us having conflict. I know that we were quite different, but in some ways quite similar, and suffered many uniquely similar hardships and were horribly mistreated/abused in many similar ways, particularly by our mothers. My son, who has a very similar personality to hers, was born just two weeks after she died. Just many coincidences that have slowly come unveiled over the years.

","I am poor, and I am addicted to caffeine from coffee, and nicotene, from smoking a tobacco pipe. I don't mind paying more for the loose leaf tobacco I smoke, because it's still cheaper than cigarrettes, and I can roll my own. 

But coffee? I do not go to coffee shops, because the baristas from small time coffee shops where I live are kind of mean, and sometimes they are jerks to people like me. I typically go to McDonalds, because I know all the general managers in my city, from when I was a rockstar worker in the McDonalds of my town, Good times, I loved that easy job. They typically offer me kindness as well as cheap coffee. 

I tried drinking energy drinks but those are expensive, and they really make me feel like I am going to have a heart attack, so No. 

Right now, I get my coffee this way: I boil water using my trangia spirit burning stove, boil some water in my camping pot/kettle, and pour this over some coarse ground coffee beans (that I ground using a stone mortar and pestle...) already, from a tin I carry around. I then wait for the pour over coffee thing (silicone folding cup with a fine stainless steel mesh filter, reusable, tough and $15 online: expensive but lasts forever, compact and wont break) and then bust out powdered creamer and powdered brown sugar from little tins I also carry with me, in my folding ozark trail cup. I get my coffee beans from the food bank, sometimes I get cheapo store brand bulk tins of coffee. 

I go to little weekly gatherings where me and the people in our club, make ""coffee outside"" and we love comparing set ups! But we are all limited to using ""camping"" methods

I’m going to kill myself. As soon as I finish recording this. I don’t want to, but what choice do I have? It’s the only way. At least the gun wasn’t empty. I can’t look at it, too risky, my eyes might eat it. They’re clever. I tried to cut them out but they stopped the knives, the bleach, the fire. Soon I’ll be blind. It’s the floaters, those tiny black dots. Always thought of them as friends. Watching over me, just out of sight. But now they won’t leave. More crowd in every day. Blotting things out, like ink in my eyes. I’m tired. I just want to sleep but they won’t stop *squirming*. I wish I could cry. I try and try but they eat all the tears. I’m scared, so, so, so scared. I don’t want to die, don’t want to have to do it. I just want my dad. Please, will you tell me where my dad is?

…

I–I’m sorry… Been getting, mixed up lately. Haven’t slept in days I think. Gotta breathe. Focus on this, no time for anything else. You all are almost ready outside. You have to know what happened here. Gotta save you. Gotta save the world.

…

I, um, I lived in a studio apartment. Top floor, on the north side of town. It had a view right out onto the building across the street. Perfect for watching people. The windows were small, easy to duck out of sight if I had to. But that other building was lined with huge panes of glass. I could see entire rooms through them, and plenty of people didn’t bother with their blinds. Every evening, those windows came to life. I’d make a pot of coffee, sit at my desk, and watch. Filling notebooks and flash drives with anything I could get my eyes on. Heights, weights, habits, routines. Their parents’ names. Their favorite movies. What they looked for in friends. What they liked to drink with breakfast. I could even get audio from some of their places. Most people are willing to download pretty much anything these days. Digging through their trash helps. Find old mail, full names, where they work, who they bank with. Make an email look professional and there’s no link the average person won’t click. Once I was in their computer, I was in their microphones and cameras and anything else they had lying around their network.

And, look, to you that might sound… kinda creepy. I get it. That’s what I’d think too. But I was not looking to take advantage, I swear. I am not a stalker. The rule was ‘look don’t touch.’ Because you can learn so much about a person by watching. Listening. Conversation isn’t the same. Isn’t as pure. We’re not ourselves around others. We become machines. Piles of gauges and dials. We tweak our words and our volume and our pitch until we hit that perfect frequency for whoever we’re interacting with. That’s all connection is. It’s unnatural. It’s disturbing. You think you know your loved ones so well? Wake up surrounded by confusion and screams and bullet holes in the walls. Do you really know what they’d do? What you would do? No. Because you only know the lies they feed you. Watch someone at home, in their bubble, where they think prying eyes couldn’t possibly get in. You’ll see truth. And even an ugly truth is sweeter than a lie.

…

Most of the time it’s easy, getting to know people. We’re just patterns. All the things we can’t not do. See that Jeremy binges and purges. See that he keeps his life organized at all costs. Listen in on Christmas with the family and learn his dad was military, that he moved around a lot growing up. In the apartment down the hall, see that Selena is married to a woman. Read an email from her sister and learn her dad is a hard-line conservative. See Selena send him a Christmas card every single year, then rush to check the mail for weeks.

You can connect the dots. Watch long enough, pick up enough details and behaviors and you build out their hearts, their souls in your mind. You witness them. As it should be. Life was good.

I tried to keep up with everyone I could see from my window, but I’m only human. It was easiest to focus in on one or two at a time. The day Emily moved in that was Travis and Ruth. Abuse was nothing new but their dynamic was fascinating. Travis was short but stocky, with a sharp nose and beady, rat’s eyes. He was sprawled on their couch with some old horror movie on his laptop. I was in its camera, watching him watch it. He kept rubbing his knuckles. A deep frown carved in his face.

Ruth, his wife, skulked around the edges of their apartment. Nursing a black eye and sweeping up the plates Travis had hurled at the wall before he hit her. She was playing out one of her murder fantasies, I could tell from the glances she shot at the back of his head. Eyes like jagged glass. That happened on days like this. I’d check her phone’s browser history and find her looking up ways to hide bodies, how to hurt people so they’d die slow, but quiet. Then she’d start shopping. Buying bleach, rope, tarps. Even a hacksaw once. She never followed through.

At the other end of the building, Selena and her wife Dawn had just gotten home. They liked to cap off their week by sharing an audiobook and a bottle of wine on the couch. That night it was book four of some fantasy epic. They were right at the end. Listening along always relaxed me. Made me feel warm to see the love there, and some of the stories were pretty good too. I was about to switch over to them when a noise came through Travis’ microphone. A door banging open, out in the hall. There was movement in the living room next to his. I grabbed my binoculars for a better look.

That was when I first saw her. Bundling into that vacant apartment, a big cardboard box taking up both arms. Her chin was planted on top so it wouldn’t tip forward. She isn’t–wasn’t, beautiful. Looked to be in her thirties. Chunky, but not quite fat. Her face was motherly. Round, and dimpled, and her dishwater hair had a habit of clumping into ropes. But the way she moved, floating around the apartment. Baggy white shirt billowing like angel’s wings as she unpacked a fuzzy blanket, a stack of heavy books, some plain sets of clothes. There was an awkward elegance in every movement she made. Like watching someone learn ballet.

A couple moving guys helped her carry up some furniture. There was a wooden bookshelf, a couch, and a big glass tank. It had a little pond inside, with a turtle resting on one of the rocks. She helped them out with all of it. Smiling and chatting. When they were done she gave them each some cash. “Thanks Emily, have a good one,” the last man said. I tasted the name. *Emily*. It fit her perfectly. I smiled. Said it again.

It’d been over a year since someone new had moved in, so I was excited. I had to know more. I waited. Tuning in to her window every night. Letting her get settled while I tried to figure her out. All the books made it clear she was well read. Intelligent. Her apartment was minimalist. Nothing on the walls, no unnecessary furniture. Her too-small mattress was shoved in a corner on the floor. She didn’t want to be tied down. Could pick up and leave at a moment’s notice. Did she move a lot for work? Was she running from something? Or did she just enjoy the freedom? The questions were fishhooks snagged in my brain. Tugging me back to her, always.

The only ‘extra’ she allowed herself was the turtle. She loved that thing. And it obviously felt the same. It could see the light in her. Its eyes followed her everywhere she went, like sunflowers. She kept its tank on a side table by the door so it was the first thing she saw when she got home. Every day she made sure the glass was spotless, that it had clean water and fresh greens to eat. The way it craned its head toward her finger when she stroked its shell was adorable. She had such a big heart, I still believe that.

But she worked long hours. Dawn till well past dusk, no days off. A week flew by and I barely learned anything new. As far as I could tell she had no friends. Didn’t have the time. She’d get home, take care of the turtle, eat some takeout and spend an hour or so staring at the TV. Then clean up and crash before heading out six hours later.

Her shoulders had a constant slump. I’d catch her crying late at night. Never for long. She’d clamp down before the whimpers grew to sobs. I thought she was lonely. Maybe she was. Doesn’t matter now. What matters is I was addicted. Starving. She was comfortable. The rest of the world fell away when I was with her. But I was stuck with a few hours a night, a morsel, when all I wanted was to shovel down plate after plate of her.

I’ll admit, maybe in the past I’ve gotten too interested in people. Never like that. It only got worse. When she left all the color in the world went with her. Everyone I used to love seemed dull. Petty. Nobody held my attention. The instant her lights turned on I’d drop everyone to attend to her. I hated it. Abandoning people I’d spent years with just to watch her eat, sleep, and feed that fucking turtle. Every day the guilt coiled tighter in my guts. But I kept doing it. Stopping would’ve been worse. Having her always just out of sight, never there but never gone. Who would do that to themselves?

…

That night, she wasn’t back by the usual time. I was starting to freak out. For all I knew she was in a dumpster with her throat cut. I kept grabbing my binoculars, eyes darting to her window. The turtle chewed a lettuce leaf. Not a care in the world. I envied it.

Then her door opened.

A woman's figure stood there, silhouetted by the light from the hall. A man slid into view behind her. His body was long and spindly. He shoved the woman stumbling into the apartment. His arm snaked in after her and flicked on the lights.

She was encased in some kind of protective gear. It was all black. Heavy duty boots, gloves, a jumpsuit with a hood that cinched. And a gas mask, fastened to her head with a web of thick straps. Someone had welded a metal plate across the top half like a blindfold. But there were two holes punched through. Shaky eyes stared out of them. Eyes I’d know anywhere.

The turtle stretched its head towards her as the man shut the door. He was in the same black suit as Emily, except he didn’t have a mask. He was older. Gaunt face etched with wrinkles. Short black hair with graying roots. His red-rimmed eyes watched Emily the way you’d watch a bear that hasn’t noticed you. As if any second its attention might turn. He inched closer to her back. Too close. My heart beat faster. Metal glinted in his fist. A pistol, its mouth pressed to her spine.

Emily started to whip around and face him but his free hand throttled the back of her neck, slammed her into the floor. Her head ricocheted off the hardwood. She groped at the sides of her mask as she writhed in pain. The turtle hid in its shell. The tall man ground his boot into her back, teeth bared, face screwed up tight. But tears slipped down his cheeks.

Reality snapped into focus around me. This was happening. I grabbed my camera. Pointed it at her window. Questions didn’t matter. All I had to do was watch. Everything I’d been waiting for, right in front of me. A chance to see the real Emily. If she got hurt, well, that’s life. Right? So why was my throat so tight?

Her front door bent inward as something rammed it from the other side. The tall man straightened. Jerked his eyes toward it, then right back to Emily. The end of his gun trembled. He heaved her to her feet. Wrapped his arm around her throat and made her a meat shield. Aimed his gun over her shoulder, at the door. The assault was warping it, cracking the wood. Neighboring apartments lit up as people jumped out of bed to investigate. Each *BANG* put another dent in their annoyed glares, until they crumbled into scared confusion.

Emily slammed her elbow back into the tall man’s gut. He sagged as the breath went out of him. His grip loosened and Emily dropped, rolled sideways. The door buckled at the waist and flew apart as a boot crashed through. A man made of muscle stood in the breach. Dressed in more black hazmat and a gas mask with a tinted visor. The tall man fell to one knee, dumped his magazine. Two shots caught the brute in the chest and shoved him back into the hall. Another three hammered his bicep, wrenched a submachine gun out of his hand.

Below, two black vans screeched to a stop at either end of the street. Headlights cut through the dark as the tall man fumbled to reload above them. A second gunman ducked in through the doorway, a long suppressor screwed to the end of his submachine gun. He pointed it at the tall man and shredded his head. Just like that, it was a wad of pulp.

The first pistol shots were what dragged the rest of the building out of bed. On the upper floors, closest to the action, people reacted fastest. Some hid in closets, under beds. Most ran to their doors. Cramming eyes into peepholes to see what was happening, if they could get away safe.

Emily crawled towards the tall counter that bordered her kitchenette. The brute’s gun coughed lead into her leg as she pulled herself behind cover. He sent another burst over the counter so she’d stay there.

Next door, Mona and her husband Mark were hiding under their dinner table. Side by side on their stomachs. Holding hands. I loved that table. It was beautiful, dark wood. They’d have huge dinners on it whenever Mona’s family came to town. All those people smiling together. The bullets from that second burst tore through their wall, into the tabletop and Mark he–he jiggled, as the back of his skull opened up. Mona raised her head. She had this shell-shocked look. Bloody spray in her gold hair. The gunman finished reloading. More metal whizzed past her and Mona’s face crumpled into a sob. She bolted out the door. Everyone who saw her threw their doors open, giving me scattered glimpses into the hall, and rushed to follow her to safety. Mona stopped at the elevator. Mashing the down button. The doors dinged open. Clogged with bodies as everyone pressed in. Further down, a bald man stepped out of one of the apartments across the hall, a rifle held white-knuckle tight. His face went slack when he saw the elevator. Back in their own apartment, Travis had Ruth by the hair. He hauled her to the door, kicking and screaming. Tossed her into the hall then stood back and waited. She landed on her shoulder, between the bald man and the elevator. His rifle flew toward the movement and sent a bullet through her eye. Turned the black bruise around it red. Travis slammed his door, backed away, kneading his palms into his forehead. The bald man stared at Ruth. Down at his gun. Back at her. Dumb shock on his face.

Panic poured down the building. Picking up more bodies on every floor until a wave of terrified people spilled onto the street. More came out of buildings nearby to point phones at the chaos. Muffled screams drifted up to my window. I’d seen people kill themselves before. Seen them cut, beaten, bruised. It’s not fun. Not a nice thing to watch. But even though they taste bitter, pain and fear are medicine. They cut the fat off the ego and leave us naked. Human. Everywhere I looked, through every window, people exposed their most essential selves. It should’ve been intimate. Breathtaking. Nothing in the world should’ve been able to pull me away.

Emily was hunkered behind the counter, her injured leg black with blood. She’d torn a strip of fabric off her sleeve and tied it above her knee. The gunman emptied another magazine over her head. She didn’t flinch. He had her pinned but wasn’t moving any closer. She stuck a spoon into the fabric and twisted. Using it to tourniquet her leg. It was amazing how capable she was.

Between bursts the gunman would put a finger to his ear. Maybe calling for backup from the vans down the street. Their doors stayed shut. Nobody was coming. Why hadn’t he walked up and shot her? She was hurt, didn’t have a weapon. But it wouldn’t be long now. He’d get brave. She had nowhere to run.

That’s when my body stood. So fast it knocked the camera over. My legs crossed the room and my hands opened the door. My mind was in an uproar as I took the stairs three at a time. Too many thoughts brawling in the muck.

She was about to die, one of them kept shouting.

That’s life, another chimed in. Nobody lasts forever. There would always be more people to watch. But my legs wouldn’t listen to reason. My heart was a freight train in my chest.

I’m pretty sure I was scared.

Then why couldn’t I turn around? I had no idea who those people were, what was happening, I barely even knew Emily. And I’d seen people call the cops. They were on their way. 

Not fast enough. She needed help. Needed me. I was the only one who could’ve saved her.

Why did I care? It was wrong, inflicting myself on her like that. That was where her choices had led. Her choices, not mine. I had no right to take them away.

But I kept seeing her. In flashes. Petting her turtle, stacking her books. Grappling with tears in the dark. Always alone. My eyes burned. When she died it’d be my fault. That thought looped through my head, over and over, louder and louder.

All I had to do was stay away. I’d done it for over a decade. So why her?

It just–it wasn’t fair. She deserved better, she was a good person. Kind, and sad, and dedicated. Why did someone like that have to die?

I wanted her to live. More than anything.

The fact I’d have to shoot someone was the least of my concerns. Death was death, seeing it up close wouldn’t change that. And it wasn’t like I’d never had the urge. All the men Mom used to cycle through the house. The dad’s for a night. I could do it. For her I could do it. Any doubts melted away as I hit the ground floor. I saw oh so clearly. I didn’t care that I could die. Because I was too smart for that, right? I saw the bigger picture. I knew exactly where the danger would be. What harm can a bullet do if the gun isn’t pointed at you? So clever. So courageous.

It was dark outside. Like the sky had bled out. The black vans stoppering the ends of the street were gone. I wondered why, but only for a second. She made me fearless. Made me blind.

There were people everywhere. Casting warped, funhouse shadows under the streetlights. Random shouts of “go!” and “fuck!” and “help!” echoed as they ran, or froze with glazed eyes, or looked for loved ones in the mess. Selena was there. Her face drawn, and pale. She had Dawn’s arm slung over her shoulder, was helping her hobble out of the building.

I crossed the street. Throwing nervous glances around me. A mousy woman held the big glass door as she ushered people through. I pushed by and she grabbed at my sleeve, yelled “wait!” I shook free into the foyer. Eyes down. No distractions.

Dark stains covered the floor by the elevator. Bloody footprints. Sneakers and sandals and bare feet. I took a while to press the button. A sound came from inside as the metal doors crawled open. *Drip, drip, drip*. A shape was slumped against the back wall. I stepped in, not thinking, wanting a better look. Wasn’t until the doors shut behind me that I realized it was Mona. The air vent in the ceiling made her gold hair flutter.

She’d fallen. Or been pushed. Cracked her forehead on the edge of the metal handrail so hard it split her open and lodged there. She hung off it, like a wet towel. Then all those scared people had crushed in on top of her. Pounded her spine into the hard angle where the floor met the wall. Footprints tracked the backs of her sweatpants. The fingers on one hand were bent and twitching, like a squashed spider’s legs. Blood fell from somewhere I couldn’t see. Probably the ditch in her forehead. But I heard it. *Drip, drip, drip*.

I stood with my nose pressed against the door as the elevator rose. I’d seen worse than this, I told myself. One dead body wouldn’t break me. I thought about peeling her off the wall, letting her rest with some dignity. But that bend in her spine… It hurt to look at. That hand made my guts crawl. Why subject myself to it? Not like this was my fault.

The doors dinged open. I shoved the thoughts away and got out. Another clatter of gunfire down the hall. Smothered by the suppressor. My feet kept moving.

“Command this is Trapper Two, requesting support!” The gunman’s voice was hoarse, full of gravel. “I say again, asset containment breached. Host is cornered but I cannot advance. Deploy the cage right *fucking* now!”

But nobody answered. His friends were long gone. The one who’d broken down the door was dead in the hall. On his stomach. A dark streak trailed behind him. I crept over, every muscle tensed, and put my hand on his gun.

A high, winding scream serrated the silence. I leapt back, tried to point the gun at the man on the floor and it danced between my hands before I got a grip. He stayed corpse-still. The scream kept going. Distending. Nothing but pain. The kind an animal makes when they aren’t killed clean. It didn’t last long. A handful of seconds. Then this gruesome, ripping. The scream fell apart into a wet gurgle. Cold fear stabbed my chest. Was I too late? I stumbled into Emily’s ruined doorway, and froze.

The second gunman was floating in midair. Beyond mutilated. His mask was gone. His arms were flung out to either side. He still had his gun in one hand and he was fighting to move it but it was pinned there. Like he’d been crucified. Every bit of flesh had been scraped clean off his other arm. The bones gleamed as it hung there. Skeletal. And there was this noise, this gnashing, metal-chewing whine that raked through my ears as, under that arm, something started to grind the skin on the side of his chest into wet froth, like it was polishing away rust. Bright white ribs smiled through the opening. His head lolled. Crazy eyes bulging. Foam flecked mouth working open and closed but all he spoke was a river of blood. It was everywhere. Gushing out of every orifice. Wrung out of a human sponge. And still the floor below him was clean. A clump of insides slopped out over his naked hip and just, melted into thin air.

Emily stood opposite him. Propping herself up on the counter, the two black holes in her mask drilling into him.

A metallic click hung in the air. There was a spray of plaster dust as a bullet hole opened in one of the walls. Smoke swirled from the end of my gun. It was raised. My finger relaxed and I realized, I’d pulled the trigger. I don’t know why. It just, happened.

Emily’s gaze flicked over to me. My skin went hot, started to itch. The force that kept the gunman floating let go. He managed to swing his good arm as he fell. The gun went off. Drew a line across Emily’s head. Her legs turned to jelly and she crumpled as the gunman slapped onto the floor.

Quiet then. Nothing moved. Vomit was pushing up my throat, when I heard the noise. Coming from behind the counter. From Emily.

It’s amazing how the brain is able to build its own private reality. Scrub the insanity away for now, it says, and focus on what must be true. In that instant there had never been a floating man. And I truly believed I heard Emily breathing. Even when I saw her on her back, motionless, leg weeping blood, I couldn’t quite believe it. Not until I saw the fresh hole through her throat.

I’ve had a lot of time to think about that moment. Imagine orgasming with your eyes closed. Then opening them and finding yourself fucking a pig. Regret, confusion, shame, they cling to you like stale sweat. Squeezing you, so you can’t get a full breath. You want to scrub them away but they’ve soaked into your skin. And something’s wrong inside you. The world’s shifted somehow, and it’s your fault. You want to curl into a ball and disappear, make it so you never existed. But you can’t. So you just, keep going.

The noise was getting louder. Angrier. A spitting hiss, like oil boiling. Coming from behind Emily’s mask. The whole thing started to shudder. Struggling against the mess of straps holding it to her face. Black flecks dotted the metal plate welded across her eyes and, inside the two holes punched through it, something was moving.

I should have left then. But I had to see. So I just, kept going. I crouched over her, took her head in my hands, and looked into her eyes. Part of me still held onto the tiniest hope that she’d look back, teary with relief.

But her eyes were gone. Two black pits full of tarry, bubbling liquid stared back instead. Droplets of it spat out onto the metal, the mask, the floor around her head.

Then the pits went still. I felt something watching, just out of sight. Something massive. It laid its eyes on me. Eyes all around me, peeling me back, layer by later. I tried to turn away but it was too late. The liquid came alive. It leapt out of her head and splashed onto my face, cold and slimy. I jerked back. Fell. My back hit the ground and I couldn’t breathe, couldn’t see. The world was black. I clawed at my face. Trying to get it off, get it out, but it moved. Probing. Slipping through the gaps by my tear ducts. Pouring itself into the space around my eyeballs and hugging them tight. I felt myself scream as I writhed on the floor. A weird, disembodied howl that never seemed to end.

And then, I could see again. The scream sputtered out. Black floaters hung in my vision. I blinked them away. The backs of my eyes itched. Everything was too bright. I got to my feet. Trying to rein my breath in. God I was hungry. Starving. It filled my brain to the brim.

Sirens wailed outside. Lights washed in. Painting the room red and blue. Something tugged at my head. Reeling me towards the window. Three cop cars made a line on the street. Officers were trying to herd the dregs of the crowd behind it. Selena was there, an old shirt pressed to a gash in Dawn’s forehead. Travis’ had made it. His eyes bounced between the officers as his tongue flickered across his lips. Rob held his little son Nathan to his burly chest. Jeremy’s red hair bobbed as he paced. There were so many more. Everywhere I looked was a face I’d spent time with.

The itch in my eyes was like fire. I ground my fists into them but that made it worse. When I pulled my hands away, the edges of my vision were fuzzy and dark. A black dot drifted out into view. A floater, smaller than a gnat. It was moving towards one of the cops. I tried to blink it away but more shook loose. Then more, and more. The first landed on the cop’s shoulder. A big, bearded man with tattooed forearms. He winced and slapped at it. There was nothing there. He looked around, confused. He couldn’t see it. It’d never left my eyes. Another one went over his cheek and he hissed, slapped there too. But it was like trying to swat away a sniper. His buddies were giving him weird looks. Floaters kept pouring out of the corners of my eyes. A great buzzing swarm. They fell over the cop’s hand first. Packed so close they made a quivering silhouette, like a glove of flies. He yelped. Tried to yank his arm away but it was cemented in place. His friends started shouting. Tracing their pistols across roofs and windows. Tension rolled through the people behind them. Nobody understood what was happening. The cop opened his mouth to scream and the swarm darted into it. Blackened his jaw. He pawed at it and they spilled up his fingertips as they hoisted him into the air. Now his friends’ guns were pointed at him. Every mouth hung open. The crowd were on their feet. But nobody moved. They all watched in spellbound silence as a man was eaten by the air.

More floaters congealed around the cop’s body. Lunging at any hint of movement. And where they went he came apart like soggy bread. Deflating. No more room on his bones so they descended on the crowd. So many I could barely see through them all. People started swatting at themselves. Slapping their arms and legs in a strange dance that kept picking up tempo. Then they started to scream. One of the cop’s friends put a bullet in his floating skeleton.

I slammed my eyes shut. I didn’t want to see. I thought it would stop them. They didn’t like that. Itching burning excruciating pain all over my eyes. The nerves hooked into them became molten chains, rattling back into my skull, down my neck.

I shrieked. Short and sharp like shattering glass. My eyes flew open and the pain was gone. The floaters were black flames flickering over a field of bodies. The people were made of wax. They melted, flailing and sobbing, into puddles of bone and torn clothing. Mangled screams piled on top of each other, like bodies in a pit, until they were one awful noise. Officers shot at the air. Bullets ate into the street, smashed through windows. One tore past Dawn’s face as her skin peeled away into muscle, into skull. Selena kept trying to scoop her back together. Another stray bullet pinged off a lamppost, blew chunks out the back of Selena’s head and they both toppled at Travis’ feet. His squeals died as a black splotch gripped his jaw and squeezed. It climbed further up his face and left wreckage behind. He was crying when they swept over his eyes.

One by one, the screams winked out. Like all the stars dying. Then a silence that ate the world. My eyes cleared as the swarms broke apart. They swam back into the dark corners of my head, swollen and lazy. The street was a carpet of death. All the people I’d dedicated my life to. Blended together on the asphalt. I couldn’t tell who was who. If I’d never been born, it wouldn’t have happened. I snapped my head away. My stomach was swollen. The backs of my eyes purred.

A long moan limped out of me. My knees hit the floor but the pain, and everything else, was far away. Blurry around the edges. Reality was watercolor. I couldn’t hear over the blood hammering my temples. The ragged breaths sawing through me. I cried fat, silent tears that never made it out of my eyes. Those things sucked them down as soon as they welled up.

Panic set in. Bone deep. I tried to claw at my eyes but every time my shaky hands got close that rabid pain woke back up so I tore at my hair instead.

I wanted my dad. Wanted his arms around me. The smell of beef on his work clothes as he hugged me and told me it would be okay. But he was dead. I used to see it, when I could still sleep. The garage door gaping open. His brains pink on the car’s black dashboard. Mom never let me read the note.

He hadn’t acted any different before. He’d always been sad. I should’ve watched him closer, I would’ve seen it. He knew what mom was doing. I could tell from the way his lips pressed white when I told him. He’d been able to live with it. But I had to confront him. Had to rub his face in it. Like he was a dog. He couldn’t even look at me. I only wanted him to be happy. To take me away. He was gone when I woke up.

My whimpers morphed into hacking, breathless laughter. I threw up. Nothing but bile. Floaters ate that too. I wiped slime off my lips and they picked it off the back of my hand. That crowd of tangled screams echoed through me. I sprang to my feet. Dug around the kitchen drawers till I found duct tape and ran it in strips over the windows. Until no light could seep in. Then I crawled under Emily’s sheets and hid.

Keeping track of the rest was hard. The brain can only take so much. It’s a coward at heart.

There were more sirens. People gathering outside. Waiting to starve me out, or getting ready to storm the building. What would happen when they did was the only thing on my mind. Well, not the only thing. Wasn’t long until I got hungry again. And then all I could think about was Mona, in the elevator with her eggshell skull, dripping sweet red juices. The wad of brains clinging to the tall man’s neck. Getting stiff. Starting to stink. Might help clear the air if I looked at them. Just the ones in the room. I was so, so, hungry. Could barely breathe through the drool. The thought of normal food made me sick, and my eyes were getting angry. Stinging like wasps. I started with the gunman, the half-eaten one. Just to tide me over. I stared at him till his bones shone white. After that, I sat back. The turtle was at the edge of its tank. Looking back and forth across the room. It had such sad eyes. It must’ve been thirsty, so I went and filled a dish with water. When I put it in the tank there was a little squeak. Floaters pranced over tiny bones and broken bits of shell. It happened so fast. They snatched it out of the corner of my eye.

I tried to cry again. But it’s not the same without tears. Muscle memory tried to blink after but my lids were stuck in place. I realized, I hadn’t blinked in hours. It’s a weird feeling, having your eyes pried open, but it doesn’t hurt. They keep them wet. Pick away all the debris. I miss it though. Blinking. Crying. Human things. I went straight to the kitchen knives and stabbed one at my eye. The point was about to drive home when they chewed through the metal and it disappeared down to the handle, like a retractable prop. I kept going until handles were heaped on the counter. Next thing I knew I was under the covers again. Trying to ignore the constant squirming behind my eyes. It hit me then that, in the right hands they could’ve eaten cancer, eaten disease. Emily dedicated her life to making the world a better place and I killed her. I killed everyone. The next day I ate the tall man. Better that than let him rot. At least he was dead already. At least it stopped the pain in my head. It’s what he would have wanted. I found some bleach in Mark’s apartment, tried to pour it in my eyes but all it did was burn my face. I tried everything. And still, one by one, the bodies turned to spotless bones. Until it was just Emily and I.

A small army outside by then. Hundreds maybe. I heard them marching. Voices barking orders, trucks rolling in. I was getting hungry again. They got more impatient with every meal. I couldn’t eat Emily. She deserved rest. Maybe I could peel open the window an inch. Just a taste couldn’t hurt. An arm or a leg. The thought made me sick but there was nothing in my stomach so I retched in the corner like a cat. The world was worse with me in it. But they’d find someone else to jump into if I died. I had to fix it. I made myself think about Emily. She’d want to help them. To save them from me. Took some effort to actually get my eyes on her. But the hunger won out in the end. My hands shook as I undid the straps of her mask.

Her skin was mottled, the color of rotten grapes. It seemed a size too big. Those deep, deep pits where her eyes had been were fixed on me. Her face was different somehow. A smile slashed across it, I’d never seen her smile like that. The corners of her mouth twisted up into cruel points. Like she was laughing at me. Like I was the punchline to a sick joke.

I fell back. My hand hit the tall man’s pistol and sent it skittering sideways under a lamp. Light bounced off the black metal and the gun gleamed like smiling teeth. The whole world was laughing. I went cold, and heavy. My blood was lead. I was tired. Tired to the bone. The noise outside was getting louder. My hand scrabbled at the floor till it closed around the pistol. I made sure not to look.

…

You’re inside now. I hear boots down the hall. You’ll be here soon.

Whatever you do, don’t let me see you. They’ll still be in me after I’m gone. But I’ll put up a barricade, and slide this under the door. Hope that whoever finds it listens.

Please listen. Please.

And maybe, if everything ends up alright, you could try to remember me.

1hlkxut,https://www.reddit.com/r/fragrance/comments/1hlkxut/mass_review_16/,MASS REVIEW (1/6),"Merry Christmas, everyone!

Today, I am doing my first review. I'm pumped! 

Some background: I (20M), am very passionate about fragrance; history, notes, perfumers, composition, etc. Now, I don't claim to be an expert. In fact, I am fairly new to this. However, have spent a lot of time doing extensive research, obtaining a large collection of samples, testers, decants, and some bottles. 

My goal is to share my views on fragrances and learn in the process, so, PLEASE respond, bash, read or contest my reviews. 

\*\*This is review 1/6\*\*

Happy reading!

**DOLCE & GABBANA:**

*Pour Homme Intenso:* I had received this fragrance in a sample vial along with some others I had purchased. I didn’t look anything up before testing it, but I didn’t hate it. It sort of has a “blue” opening, in my opinion. It definitely smoothes out over time. It did have more complexity than I was expecting from a D&G scent. It is not something to write home about but it isn’t bad either. My co-worker thought it smelled like, “man.” Take that how you will. Personally, I had a hard time figuring out the notes. Performance was good with about 6-8 hours of longevity. Not bad but not special. **(5/10)**

**DIOR:**

*Tobacolor:* This is a beauty, truly. I, at this point in my journey, have tested a lot of tobacco scents, and while this is not the sort of tobacco I gravitate towards, it was *intoxicating.* The plum in this scent is deep, decadent, and smooth. Mixed with the tobacco, it makes for a luxurious aroma. I usually stay wary of the conversations around “date-night” or “special-occasion” scents, as I think it important to wear what you like, but this is an exception. It is something I would personally reserve for those occasions. I (20M) found myself in love with this scent, and, though I think people ought to wear what is an extension of themselves, this may be reserved for a certain age. I was won over by *Tobacolor*, but even I questioned if it was a bit mature for my image. Overall, this fragrance is smooth, incredibly well blended, deep, rich, luxurious, balanced, and intoxicating. The performance is incredible. **(9/10)**

**LOUIS VUITTON:**

*Nuit de Feu:* This fragrance pleasantly surprised me. It is not one that I would typically go for, but I had a free sample so I gave it a day out. I initially smelled what I perceived as black pepper. That's what my brain picked up, can’t help it, you know? Anyways, once I got the black pepper idea out of my head, the incense came out quite nicely! It was dark and smooth. I thought: “lightly sensual.” The dry down was even better, in my opinion. It became a tad sweeter and smoother. I asked my co-worker what she thought (I made sure not to reveal the official notes before she smelled them to avoid preconceived ideas) and she smelled a smoky, dark vanilla. Not a *smoky* smoke, but an *incense-y* smoke. Overall, this is not a scent I would typically wear, but it was very nice! Contrary to reviews, performance was good! 7am-2pm longevity. Price is... \*side eye\* Though it is not bad, it is not within my personal preference for a scent. **(7/10)**

*L’Immensitè:* I love this scent. I always have and always will. It was one of my first “big” purchases. I was fairly young at the time, so it has a special place in *here* \*puts hands to heart\*. Anyways, enough of the sappy stuff. In all honesty, this scent is very straightforward. I think LV gets a bad rep, being a designer line and all. And let’s face it: the prices are deterring at best. BUT! It is a GREAT summer scent. Easy, fresh, citrusy, bright, a tad spicy, and very wearable. The ginger and grapefruit are uplifting and energizing, but the scent is grounded with the amber notes. Overall, I think this is a wonderful addition to any collection. Performance is great (longevity & projection). Price and bias deduct points. **(8.9/10)**

*Afternoon Swim:* An orange. But, a scrumptious one! This scent is a big, plump, sweet, juicy, tangy, and citrusy *orange*. There is not much more to it than that. It is GORGEOUS in the summer. An incredibly *smooth* orange, it has that initial spike of citrus, but it really is just a beautifully rounded orange scent. I am not always the biggest fan of orange/citrus fragrances but I want to frolic in orange groves when I smell this one. Longevity lacks compared to the other LV fragrances and the price is... well, the price. BUT! Simply, delectable. **(8/10)**

P.S. If anyone knows where I can get samples of *Cactus Garden* or *Sun Song*, please let me know! Thanks!

**GEIR NESS:**

*Geir for Men:* Though this is a simple and relatively inexpensive fragrance, I haven’t smelled anything like it… yet. Anyways, it has a BEAUTIFUL, fresh, floral note. Not the traditional stuffy floral note, but a “rushing cool breeze blowing through the wildflowers of a glacial Norwegian mountain” kind of note. That’s what it smells like to me. I actually think it works equally well for all seasons. The coolness of it allows for a nice summer scent, but the floral note with a HINT (and I mean a HINT) of spice makes it alright for winter. I like this scent because it’s an easy wear and not too pungent or “blue,” but still exceedingly fresh. It's like the cleanest mountainous glacial air you’ve ever breathed.  It has good projection for as long as it lasts. I would say that it is medium-low for longevity. Price is very reasonable! **(7.9/10)**

 **ZOOLOGIST:**

*Camel*: The dried fruit is prominent in the opening. The fruit exits soon after, leaving an eastern smell, that of; frankincense, amber, incense, and spices. There is a slight *funk,* or animal quality to this fragrance, rightfully so. It then settles into a plain, lightly sweet, incense. Nothing crazy, but still holding onto the notes that give it an eastern world vibe. I found this scent to be less complex than other Zoologists but still nice. The least performing of all Zoologists I have tried, it didn’t last nearly three hours. Personally, not for me. **(3.5/10)**

*Civet:* Oooooooo, BABY! What a beautifully underrated perfume. *Civet* completely intoxicated me. Why, you may ask? Well, you see, this fragrance is deeply complex. Its combination of roughly 25 different notes and stellar performance make it a standout. The opening is spicy, aromatic, floral, and, seemingly, gone too soon. This fragrance transforms into something beautiful and unique. The notes swirl around, revealing themselves with each whiff. For example, the coffee wasn’t “coffee,” it was used as a tool to darken the fragrance, making itself known, but very discreetly. The many, *many* other ingredients work harmoniously to create a vintage-inspired, timeless, slightly animalic, woody, musky, sweet, and dark masterpiece. I thoroughly enjoyed it. While I love it, someone said it smelled like church at Christmas, in a good way… Whatever that means. Luckily, this is MY review. I am happy to smell like whatever church that was. Great longevity and projection, it seemed. **(9/10)**

*Squid:* I was very intrigued to sample this fragrance, as I have seen how polarizing it can be. Truthfully, that shocked me! I found *Squid* to be very wearable. Unique, yes, but still wearable. I find the composition of this fragrance to be interesting because the notes work to create a completely different image in your mind, from what they really are. For example, if you hadn’t told me there was incense, I would not have known. In my view, the incense added for a slight sweetness, and mixed with the other notes, almost created a thick ink-y or seaweed effect. It was interesting. *Squid* is very; deep, dark, liquid-y, mysterious, and alluring. Like a Squid. Crazy, right. Overall, I enjoyed this.  Performs moderately. Good for maybe one reapplication throughout the day? **(7.5/10)** 

**PENHALIGONS:**

*Halfeti:* Arguably one of Penhaligon’s most famous fragrances, and rightfully so, *Halfeti* is just right. With the perfect blend of woods and spice with a touch of citrus and rose, rounded off with the sweet smoothness of nutmeg and cardamom, *Halfeti* leaves little to be desired. On the top you get a spicy-citrusy opening. Later, it smoothes into a woody, seductive, spicy fragrance. On the tail end of each whiff, sweet nutmeg rounds the fragrance off. It is a romantic but adventurous scent, one that I truly enjoyed. Moderate performance at around 6 hour longevity. **(7.8/10)**

**MAISON FRANCIS KURKDIJAN:**

*Oud Satin Mood:* You guys, I must be honest with you….This is my guilty pleasure. The one… the only… OUD SATIN MOOD!! \*crowd cheers\* It’s fair to say that I love this one, I cannot lie. There is just *something* about it. Firstly, I am not going to try and explain what OSM smells like, because I don’t even know, I just like it. The notes say it’s floral heavy (roses, iris, violet) with oud, but I just smell something I wanna eat, or bathe in, or something… The oud must only be part of the name, because- where is it? I see a lot of women review this scent, but I’m a guy and I think this is a straight up knockout. I JUST WANNA GOBBLE MY ARM OFF!!! Sorry. Ahem- I have found it to be quite polarizing. Some say it smells like grandma, and some say they, too, want to eat me up. Respectfully, of course. Anyways, I’m not sure what else to say. I like it, and I know fragrance is subjective, so, because of my not-so-in-depth review of OSM, take this rating with a grain of salt, as I am very biased. STRONG performance and projection, WOW! **(10/10)** (again…I’M BIASED)

*Oud Silk Mood:* As you can see, I adore *Satin Mood,* so I was excited to try her sister, *Silk Mood*! *Silk* and I do not get along. She’s the ugly sister, or something. I found her to be a lot more “rose-y” than *Satin*. NOT the delectable rose in OSM, but more of a traditional, lighter, and almost, *empty* rose. There are many different roses in the fragrance world, so different strokes for different folks, I guess. I will say, *Silk* was lighter than *Satin Mood,* but still smelled like, “rose,” the whole time I wore it. I feel that *Satin* has more depth. Or I’m biased. Oh, well. Didn’t last as long as *Satin* but still lasted a solid 7 hours. **(3/10)**

**VERSACE:**

*Eros Flame:* \*sighs in defeat\* I am embarrassed to put this on my list, but I have to be honest with you all, and it is one that I have tested, which means I can review it, despite *Versace’s* unpopularity in the fragrance world. I wore this scent for about a year straight. Jail, I know. In all fairness, I was very young. This was my VERY FIRST ever fragrance. Think: teenage high schooler. You get the type. Anyways, it's a lot. It is very strong and has a spicy, peppery, citrusy kind of chemically smell. Works well for autumn. Intense, with has that uninteresting crowd-pleaser scent. I cannot wear it anymore because it really can make you go nose blind. Breathing it in after a pump too many will cause a suffocation. The projection is nuclear, and the longevity, from what I remember, is good. Burns your nose hair off. **(2/10)**

**LE LABO:**

*Iris 39:* This is now a boutique exclusive and I am happy I was able to test it! Firstly, *Iris 39* is definitely an iris scent. It has a sweeter, fresher opening and settles into a nice, powdery, classic, sort of scent. As the day went on, I noticed it became *slightly* darker, a bit woodier/muskier. SLIGHTLY, though, the powdery-ness was still prominent. If you enjoy a classic kind of fragrance with notes of iris/violet that remain powdery, you might enjoy it! I want to note; I am a guy who enjoys darker, tobacco filled scents, so this was way off in left field for me, but my nose likes what it likes! What can I say! This performed wonderfully! Stayed on for 8+ hours! **(7/10)**

*The Matcha 26:* This one surprised me! It started off pretty green and herbaceous, which was expected. What surprised me was the creaminess of the dry down. Matcha/tea notes, I find, can be slightly bitter, but I didn’t find that to be the case with this one. It blended very nicely. You are left with a nice, creamy cedar note that comes out quite well. I found this fragrance to be warm, earthy, alluring, slightly aromatic, and woody, but still green? I hope that makes sense. It performed fine, but not well enough for the price. **(6.5/10)**

*Santal 33*: I wanted, I hoped, I *prayed* for this fragrance to come through… welp. I know this fragrance is highly favorable among many, and I am so, so happy for you if you reside in that camp, truly. But I do not. The opening hits me with iris, undoubtedly. Then, almost immediately after, I get this weird… *funk*. It is the weirdest thing. It’s not wretched, but most certainly not favorable. I will say, it is not the “pickles” y’all be talking about, but it was still funky. It wasn’t until two hours later, on the dry down, that it smelled fine. Nothing crazy, just *fine*. It was now a slightly sweet, woody sort of scent. Overall, this frag did not work for me, and that’s too bad because I was really rooting for this one :( It lasts a while but I didn’t want it to, the top/heart notes last too long for how funky they are. (**2.2/10)**

**JOHN VARVATOS:**

*Vintage:* I really enjoy this fragrance… for as long as it lasts. It is no secret that JV’s fragrances have poor performance, so I will stick to the actual scent profile. The word “vintage” could deter a lot of people from this fragrance, as it is usually associated with powdery/barbershop/non-mass-pleasing notes. But *Vintage* doesn’t have those qualities. It is a surprisingly favorable scent among my collection. Firstly, it has many gorgeous notes. The opening is fresh and aromatic, but over time, it settles into that nice and smooth; tobacco, suede, spiciness, woodiness, slight booziness, but remains aromatic and fresh. It has all the qualities of smelling like a time that has passed. I enjoy this fragrance because if I don’t know what to wear I know I can reach for it. It is versatile, but still unique. Not to mention, the price is affordable. Poor performance. Needs more than an average amount of sprays and lasts maybe 2-4 hours? Expected. **(8.4/10)** 

**GUERLAIN:**

*Honey Tobacco*: Honey on the opening is strong and very honey-like. And that’s it. I seriously just smelled of honey the whole way through. The longevity wasn’t special, nor was the projection. If you like honey, great! Buy this! The realest honey fragrance I have ever smelled! It confirmed that I do not, in fact, like honey fragrances. At all. I will say, there may have been clove and anise hiding on the underbelly of this scent, and MAYBE, just maybe, even the tobacco came through… slightly. But, wow, that honey really punches your nose. Performance was fine. Not great, just: *fine.* Overall, ew. **(2/10)**

**ORMONDE JAYNE:**

*Ormonde Man:* The opening on this fragrance is spicy, crisp, and aromatic! JUNIPER!!! The notes describe it well (you can look them up). The dry down, in my opinion, is where the magic happens. The woody/musky, but still fresh, blend is beautiful. It is masculine, aromatic, grounded, and smooth. I like it a lot, which is UNFORTUNATE because the performance wasn’t up to my standards. Tragic, y’all. Tragic. It didn’t last as long as it should for the price. NOW! If you don’t mind reapplying, don’t let that deter you. **(7/10)** 

*Tolu*: The opening was brilliant! It was crisp, unique, modern, fresh, amber-y, and dazzling. I really enjoyed it. Now, this fragrance has one of the most distinct changes from the top -> heart notes of any fragrance I have tested yet. It was constantly evolving, but not too quickly. I was truly able to smell each note profile as time went on. Here is the deal: The opening was gorgeous… BUT! The dry down became too heavy on the florals for my liking. However, make no mistake… When it says the heart notes are; rose, orchid, and lily-of-the-valley, you’re gonna get; rose, orchid, and lily-of-the-valley. Though I didn’t like the floral notes for myself, they were light, sweet, and airy… classically feminine, in my opinion. The base does contain, what I smelled to be a, frankincense-y, amber note, though, the floral notes linger. It’s interesting because the opening was completely different from what the fragrance evolved into, which is wonderful, and quite spectacular, but not all of the notes were for me. Frankly, performance lacked. Strength and longevity decline after an hour or two. **(5.5/10)**",2,1735069341.0,fragrance,0,0.75,False

There has been something I’m struggling with quite heavily. I am continuing to get stuck on missing the common interests me and my ex used to share together and have so much love for. I found out she had been cheating on me and the pain of losing the relationship has been nothing short of excruciating. Not only the betrayal but the consistent happiness we shared in each other’s presence. During the winter months, many of our weekends would consist of waking up, sharing a pot of coffee through the morning, cuddling under a blanket, and watching Harry Potter or other shows and movies we enjoyed. Harry Potter was the big one. I was a fan when we got together but she took my fandom to the next level and I became a super fan. I would buy merch, both for myself and gifts for her, I played the video games, we watched the movies together all the time with absolute bliss in our hearts, shared reels and memes together about Harry Potter. I became a super fan because of her and I still want that, she hurt me in ways I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy but why should she be the only one who keeps that happiness? Getting over the heartbreak has been hard enough. I still want to take back the things that mean something to me without the constant reminder that it was our thing. We bonded so heavily over it. It was even apart of the opening line I used when we match on a dating app. That was almost three years ago now. We broke up only a few weeks ago and cut contact last week. Does anyone have any advice on how to regain the love back for things like that? I’m truly lost and this has been my biggest roadblock the last couple days. Any help or insight would be appreciated.

1hlkwff,https://i.redd.it/vpdarn5lnu8e1.jpeg,Thermal Shock,"Hey, r/Pourover!

I’ve been exploring some new coffees this week, and I wanted to share my lineup and get your thoughts. Each of these brings something unique to the table, so I thought it’d be fun to discuss some of the techniques, preferences, and brewing adjustments these coffees inspire.

Here’s what I’m working with:

	1.	Jhonatan Gasca - Thermal Shock Pacamara
	•	Notes: Lily, sweet lemon, Rainier cherry, tangerine
	•	Origin: Huila, Colombia
	•	Process: Thermal Shock
This is my first time brewing a Thermal Shock processed coffee, and the results so far have been fascinating—super vibrant and lively, but tricky to balance. The floral and citrus notes are very pronounced, and the cup feels incredibly dynamic.
	•	Questions:
	•	Do you tweak your brewing technique for Thermal Shock coffees? I’ve been experimenting with lower temps and longer blooms but haven’t nailed it yet.
	•	Any tips for getting the most out of Pacamara beans in general?

	2.	Candy Clouds - Coffee Movement x Dak Coffee Roasters
	•	Notes: Strawberry milkshake, passion fruit, cotton candy
	•	Origin: Cauca, Colombia (Pink Bourbon, controlled fermentation)
	•	Process: Controlled fermentation
The name says it all—this coffee is a sugar bomb! I’ve never tasted such intense sweetness and candy-like flavors in a cup before. The Pink Bourbon really shines here, and the controlled fermentation adds an amazing depth. It feels almost like a dessert coffee.
	•	Questions:
	•	Has anyone tried this? Thoughts?
	•	Any thoughts on how to best highlight or balance these super-fruity, sweet profiles during brewing?

	3.	First Batch (Prodigal)
	•	Details: Roasted December 16, but otherwise pretty sparse on details.
I’ve been starting with a basic 1:16 recipe, but I’m still feeling it out.
	•	Question:
	•	Has anyone else tried this?

Up until very recently, we've been just that- best friends. But after a few weeks of denying it, I'm definitely catching feelings (which is making me panic, but whatever). I'm writing this here bc: he made our whole friend group very cute and personal Christmas cards. An entire hand written page, with a wax seal in our favorite colors, and a little drawing on the back of the envelope. He got me into arcane, we binged season 1 together right before season 2 came out, and then we watched the new releases the day of. We both love jayvik, send each other fanart all the time, read each other's fics- we know exactly how their relationship falls. 

So why did he draw the rune on my envelope? Why, out of all of their quotes, did he write ""in all time lines, in all possibilities,"" on MINE?

Here's another thing- we reflect them so well. He has a chronic illness, he needs a cane and a brace during flare ups. He lets me help him during these, and I'm honored. I remind him to eat by making us food, making us coffee. I've always stuck up for him when ppl ignore him or treat him as lesser, even though he didnt need me to. I just always do. We stay up late together reading, drawing, sharing our favorite shows. He's the most brilliant person I know. Unbelievably kind, talented, smart. He's like that with everyone (which is one of many reasons i admire him so much). His love knows no bounds- his heart is so full. 

So I guess what I'm saying is, could this note and quote just be another example of his never ending kindness? Did he even realize what it could mean- if it means anything?",10,1735068947.0,jayvik,4,1.0,False

Things like ginger, garlic, onions, potatoes, etc. might stay in my kitchen for weeks without being used. I don't even buy bags of these anymore, just individuals which has made things easier.

However, I also tried buying things like the Kirkland packaged sausages or blocks of cheese from Trader Joes. These things end up spoiling / growing mold. I will put them in plastic bags but I just had to throw away 7 sausages because they grew mold.

I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

Rita had always known something was wrong with December. Even as a child, she'd felt it – a wrongness that crept in with the early darkness, a vibration just below the threshold of hearing that made her molars ache. But this year, as the solstice approached, the wrongness had taken form.

She first noticed him on December 1st, standing beneath the streetlight outside her apartment. His long coat and wide-brimmed hat might have seemed ordinary in the winter darkness, if not for how he remained perfectly still, neck craned upward at an impossible angle toward her third-floor window. The snow that fell around him never seemed to land on his shoulders, instead disappearing into what Rita could only describe as holes in reality itself.

She called the police, of course. But by the time they arrived, he was gone, leaving only strange tracks in the fresh snow – tracks that seemed to disappear mid-stride, as if their maker had simply ceased to exist. Or perhaps, as Rita would later realize in her more lucid moments, had simply continued walking in a direction that human minds weren't meant to comprehend.

The next night, he was there again. And the next. Always in the same spot, always staring. Sometimes, when clouds crossed the moon, Rita thought she glimpsed something moving beneath his coat, something that writhed and twisted in ways that fabric shouldn't. On the seventh night, she saw what looked like tentacles of pure shadow reaching out from beneath the hem, testing the air like the antennae of some cosmic insect.

Her neighbors didn't see him. ""Just holiday stress,"" they said with forced cheer, their eyes sliding past her like oil on water. Rita began to notice how their smiles never quite reached their eyes, how their movements seemed just slightly out of sync with their shadows. Even her best friend Jenny started avoiding her calls after Rita mentioned the strange symbols she'd found carved into her doorframe – symbols that seemed to shift and change when viewed from different angles, symbols that whispered in languages that had died before humanity learned to walk upright.

The police stopped taking her calls after the third night. ""Ma'am, we've reviewed the security footage. There's no one there."" But when Rita demanded to see the tapes herself, she noticed how the officers' hands trembled as they played the recordings, how they flinched away from certain frames. In the footage, the figure appeared as a strange distortion, a tear in reality that the camera's digital eye couldn't – or wouldn't – properly process. More disturbing were the frames where Rita herself appeared to be standing on the street, neck craned at an impossible angle, staring up at her own window.

As Christmas approached, he began leaving gifts.

The first appeared on her welcome mat: a small package wrapped in what looked like ancient parchment, tied with twine that felt slick and warm to the touch, like the tongue of some vast creature. Inside was a single glass eye, its iris a swirling vortex of impossible colors that seemed to follow her movements even when she wasn't in the room. Rita tried to throw it away, but it always returned, appearing on her nightstand, in her coat pocket, floating in her morning coffee. Sometimes she caught it blinking.

The second gift was a book bound in something that felt disturbingly like living skin. Its pages were blank until 3:33 AM, when they filled with writings in a script that made her eyes water and her teeth ache. The letters seemed to crawl across the pages like insects, forming patterns that suggested truths about the universe that no human mind was meant to contain. She burned it in her fireplace, but the smoke formed patterns that haunted her dreams and left strange, symmetrical burns on her ceiling that pulsed in time with her heartbeat.

The third gift was a mirror. Just an ordinary antique hand mirror, until she looked into it on Christmas Eve and saw not her reflection, but *him* – and finally understood that he wasn't looking up at her window at all.

He was looking down.

The realization came too late. The streetlight outside had never flickered – reality itself had been pulsing, weakening, as something older than time itself pushed through. The figure wasn't standing on the street; he was suspended from above, hanging down from a place beyond human comprehension, a place that had been watching Rita her entire life, waiting for her to finally *see*.

The true horror wasn't the creature's appearance, she realized, but the growing certainty that this was how things had always been. Every Christmas memory from her childhood took on new, terrifying significance. The strange shadows she'd seen moving behind Santa at the mall. The way her mother's eyes had gone glassy and strange every December. The real reason people hung bells on their trees and wreaths on their doors – not to welcome, but to warn.

Her neighbors found her apartment empty on Christmas morning. The only clues to her disappearance were the strange, wet footprints on her ceiling and a perfectly wrapped present under her small artificial tree, tagged with a card that read ""To: Anyone Who Can See, From: Your Secret Santa.""

Inside was a single glass eye, its iris a swirling vortex of impossible colors, and a note written in Rita's handwriting: ""The greatest gift is understanding that everything you feared as a child was real.""

And somewhere, in a dimension that exists perpendicular to our own, Rita finally understood the true meaning of Christmas eternal. She understood why the Old Ones chose December to thin the veil, why they used the comfort of tradition and ritual to mask their harvesting. She understood that Santa Claus wasn't the only one who came down from above to visit during the longest nights of the year, and that chimneys weren't the only dark passages that opened between worlds.

She understood that some presents aren't meant to be opened, and some stalkers aren't meant to be seen. She understood why children instinctively fear looking up at their bedroom windows on Christmas Eve, and why so many people go missing during the holiday season, their disappearances masked by winter storms and holiday travel.

And she understood, most of all, that she would never stop watching the windows of our world, standing perfectly still in her new long coat, neck craned at an impossible angle, waiting for someone else to finally look up – or perhaps, more accurately, look down – and receive their own gift of seeing.

After all, 'tis the season of giving.

And the Old Ones are nothing if not generous with their madness.

Some say that if you look carefully at your Christmas photos from years past, you might notice something strange: how the shadows fall at impossible angles, how certain faces in the background don't quite match their bodies, how Rita appears in the corner of frame after frame, decade after decade, unchanged, watching, waiting.

But whatever you do, don't look too closely at the Christmas lights reflected in your window tonight.

We don’t want to switch airbns /hotel. 

I found some Airbnbs I really liked and are in our budget (max. 110 €/ night) :

Small 1-bedroom apartment: in Hongdae (near Hongik Station) 

1-bedroom apartment: near Mangwon Station (it's so beautiful) 

Small studio: in Jungle between Euljiro 3 & chungmuro station (not the biggest, maybe 25 sqm)   

Studio Apartment : near Seoul Station (approx 5 min walk)

2-bedroom apartment: in HBC (near Noksapyoung station) (really beautiful apartment as well).  

We plan to do some typical tourist stuff (first timers 😅), shop, walk around and get lost, eat and drink a lot of coffee. My boyfriend loves good coffee, so we need good cafés nearby to grab coffee first thing in the morning. I would love to eat a lot of traditional Korean food (that tastes like it’s cooked by your grandma and warms up your soul) and street food ). I saw that near the small studio in Jung-gu are a lot of good coffee shops but also in Hongdae. We don’t plan to go partying, but love to have a drink and good food at night. We don’t mind to walk as we live in a big European city and only use public transport. 

Would Jung-gu be the best choice because of the subway lines and its Centre location ? Even though it’s only a small studio 🥲 
Would Hongdae be to far from everything else?  

Thank you very much in advance!

Move over cash, coins, and those awkward Venmo QR codes scribbled on café napkins—there’s a new player in town, and it’s ready to revolutionize how you collect donations. Say hello to Bitcoin and the ultimate tool for accepting crypto donations: our **Bitcoin Donate Button App**.

If you’re still on the fence about jumping on the crypto bandwagon, keep reading. By the end of this, you’ll be ready to embrace Bitcoin with open arms (and wallets).

[**Click here to explore the app that’s making donation dreams come true**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/)**.**

# Why Accept Crypto Donations?

Let’s start with the obvious: Bitcoin is cool. Like, James Bond sipping a martini while hacking a mainframe kind of cool. By accepting crypto donations, you’re telling the world you’re not just keeping up with the times—you’re ahead of them.

But it’s not just about being trendy. Here are some solid reasons why crypto donations are the future:

1. **Global Reach** Crypto knows no borders. Whether your donor is in Berlin, Bali, or Boston, they can contribute seamlessly without worrying about pesky exchange rates or international transfer fees.
2. **Privacy Matters** Some donors prefer anonymity, and Bitcoin makes it possible. With crypto, your supporters can donate without sharing their entire life story—or their email address.
3. **No Middleman** Forget credit card fees and third-party platforms taking a chunk of your donations. With Bitcoin, you’re in control. Every satoshi goes straight to you.
4. **Future-Proof Your Cause** Bitcoin isn’t just a currency; it’s a movement. By accepting crypto donations, you’re aligning yourself with a community that values innovation, decentralization, and financial freedom.

# Introducing the Bitcoin Donate Button App

Now that you’re sold on crypto donations, let’s talk about how to make them happen. Enter the **Bitcoin Donate Button App**—your new best friend in the world of digital philanthropy.

This app isn’t just functional; it’s downright magical. In a few clicks, you can create a sleek, user-friendly Bitcoin donation button for your website. Whether you’re raising funds for your nonprofit, supporting an artistic passion project, or just trying to keep your coffee habit alive, this app has you covered.

Check it out here: [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/).

# How It Works

Using the Bitcoin Donate Button App is so simple, even your tech-phobic great-uncle could do it. Here’s how:

1. **Customize Your Button** Choose your preferred style, color, and text. Want it bold and flashy? Subtle and sleek? The app lets you make it yours.
2. **Set Your Wallet Address** Add your Bitcoin wallet address, and the app does the rest. Every donation will go directly to your wallet—no intermediaries, no fuss.
3. **Copy and Paste** Once your button is ready, the app generates a snippet of code. Just copy and paste it onto your website, and you’re good to go.
4. **Watch the Satoshis Roll In** Now, sit back and let the magic happen. Every time someone clicks your donate button, they’ll be able to send Bitcoin straight to your wallet.

# Who Should Use It?

You might be wondering, “Is this app for me?” The answer is a resounding yes—if you fall into one of these categories:

1. **Nonprofits and Charities** Raise funds for your cause without losing a chunk to middlemen. Plus, your donors will love the transparency of blockchain technology.
2. **Content Creators and Streamers** From YouTubers to Twitch streamers, if you’re creating content that people love, give them a way to support you with Bitcoin. It’s like a virtual tip jar for the 21st century.
3. **Small Businesses and Entrepreneurs** Running a small business? Accept Bitcoin donations to support your growth—or just to show your customers you’re hip with the crypto scene.
4. **Open-Source Developers** Building the next big thing in software? Add a Bitcoin donate button to your GitHub page and let the community support your work.

# Why Bitcoin Over Other Cryptos?

Sure, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies out there, but Bitcoin is the OG. It’s the most widely recognized, trusted, and used crypto on the planet. Plus, it’s got that sweet, sweet decentralization vibe that no fiat currency can match.

When you accept Bitcoin donations, you’re not just accepting digital money; you’re embracing an entire philosophy. It’s like joining a secret club—but one that’s open to everyone.

# Tips for Maximizing Your Crypto Donations

Now that you’ve got your Bitcoin donate button set up, let’s talk strategy. Here’s how to make the most of it:

1. **Educate Your Audience** Not everyone is a crypto expert. Share a quick guide on your website about how to buy and send Bitcoin. Trust us—your donors will appreciate it.
2. **Offer Incentives** Give donors a reason to support you. Whether it’s exclusive content, a shoutout on social media, or just a heartfelt thank-you note, little perks go a long way.
3. **Spread the Word** Add your Bitcoin donate button to all your platforms—your website, social media profiles, email signature, and more. The more visible it is, the more likely people are to use it.
4. **Celebrate Your Donors** Publicly thank your supporters (with their permission, of course). It not only shows appreciation but also encourages others to join in.

# Real-Life Success Stories

Need proof that the Bitcoin Donate Button App works? Here are a few examples of how people are using it to fuel their dreams:

* **A wildlife conservation nonprofit** raised over 2 BTC to protect endangered species.
* **A digital artist** funded their latest project entirely through Bitcoin donations.
* **A Twitch streamer** turned their hobby into a full-time gig, thanks to generous crypto-loving fans.

# The Future of Donations is Here

We’re living in a time where technology is changing the way we interact, communicate, and yes, even donate. With the Bitcoin Donate Button App, you’re not just keeping up with the times—you’re shaping the future.

Imagine a world where every cause, every passion project, every creative endeavor can be supported by people from all corners of the globe. That’s the power of Bitcoin, and that’s the promise of our app.

So what are you waiting for? Head over to [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/donate-button/) and start accepting crypto donations today. Your supporters—and your wallet—will thank you.

# Final Thoughts

1hlk82m,https://www.reddit.com/r/mokapot/comments/1hlk82m/my_3cup_recipe_journey/,my 3-Cup recipe journey,"Longtime listener, first time caller... 

Only recently educated myself in the ways of coffee knowledge via YT and now I'm working to perfect my Moka technique and recipes. Here's the process I'm using:

1. Start boiling some water on the stove
2. Weigh out, spritz, grind 15g of Beans 
   (manual-zeroed Q2H, then CCW 45clicks)
   (the Basket basically only holds ~15g)
3. Empty grounds into Basket, WDT, tap...
4. Turn (gas) stove eye down to 4 (of 10)
5. Add Boiling Water to Moka valve (~155g)
6. Assemble Moka, put on eye, wait for it
7. Reduce heat to 1/Lo as coffee emerges
8. Stop brew as coffee reaches/nears spout
   (75g to 120g Out depending on the brew)

It's slow, calm, no stalls, no sputtering.

(I'll video one brew later.)

Currently using Rebelbean Roasters Revolution - Medium Roasted - Beans, fwiw.

It's not yet perfect, to my tastes, so right now I'm only modulating the Grind Size, trying from one to few clicks at a time in both directions, until it tastes the best balance of sour or bitter.

Depending on how that goes I may also experiment with shorter and longer Brews (stopping it sooner/less liquid out, to letting it run longer/more liquid out).

And lastly I may also experiment with how hot the water is that I add to the Moka, from Boiling to Room Temp. But I don't think I'll get that far. We will see.

Any suggestions, questions, or observations?

Who works similarly and how is that going for you?

This is on my E&B 3-Cup, fancy screen only, no paper filters, I want the body...

I was in so much pain, I was rolling around the floor in my agony and my mom was very concerned. She called emergency services who sent an out of hours doctor to see me.

The doctor told my mom that he thinks I was naturally low on fiber and to try increasing my fiber intake. She got cereal like all bran (disgusting stuff) and started me on that. It did NOT help. In fact, it made me worse (turns out fiber is a trigger of my IBS). But, the doctor told my mom I needed it, so she kept forcing me to eat it.

I struggled with it for years. Always constipated, I go to toilet 2 days a week, with gaps of up to 5 days without going. 

One day, I was 17, and I had a really bad flair up, I  was in extreme pain. I was at my dad's and he took me to the doctors. The doctor diagnosed me and prescribed me Mebeverine. This medication changed my life. When I have a bad flair up, it can take the pain from unbearable to manageable in 40 minutes or so. Prior to this, nothing helped and I'd be stuck in agony for hours.

I started cutting out different foods and drinks from my diet and found out caffeine is a big trigger. I was drinking ~5 cups of coffee a day, and drinking lots of caffinated fizzy drinks. I cut this down to one coffee a day and that made a huge improvement almost immediately. Found some other triggers, such as... FIBER, and suddenly my life changed drastically. 

Thinking about how much pain I was in, and from such a young age is horrible. 

These days, I still only go around 2 days a week with up to 5 days in between, but I rarely have very painful flairups. I have mild pain very often but I can ignore it and get on with my life. 

Not sure why I'm posting this really. Just sharing my story I guess. Ask me any questions you may have.

TL:DR: Mebeverine and diet changes turned my life from unbearable agony to manageable, mild pain.",10,1735067108.0,ibs,2,1.0,False

In every single other date the guy would message me to make sure I got home safely and ask for a second date, and if he didn’t I’d assume he wasn’t interested and move on. I only made an exception for him because I really liked him.

The fact he liked me but didn’t message, shows that he likes to play games. And it seems like he’s putting me through “tests” to see if I really like him. “Tests” and “keeping score” aren’t components of a healthy relationship.

No, I’ll be ringing downstairs if I need anything else.

Wait. I almost forgot to give you your tip.

(Sighing) Why are you in such a rush to leave?

(Sighing) And now you’re apologizing. Am I really that scary with no makeup on?

(Softly) Oh, poor boy...that- that was a joke. You’re allowed to smile, you know?

I don’t mind occasionally chatting with the staff. I know you’re probably busy and all, but making me feel comfortable is part of your job, is it not?

Hm. Please do. And here you go.

You know, the least you can do is make eye contact when you’re thanking me.

Stop apologizing. Just- (sighing softly) just look up at me. It’s okay. I’m not going to do anything.

Well?

Why are you trying so hard to avoid looking at me? Is there a problem?

Then look at me. Let me see what-

(Very faintly) No...it can’t be...

Hey. Hey! Oh my god! You’re...helmet?!

It is you, isn’t it? We went to school together!

Oh my gosh. I had a little trouble recognising you because of that hair but- damn. It is you! I’m right, aren’t I?

Imagine the chances! Oh, helmet, it has been far too long! Come here.

Still awkward about returning a hug, huh? (Giggling) Oh, you haven’t changed.

Sorry. Sorry. Giving you a bear hug after so long is probably weird- and unprofessional (forced laughter)- but I, um- wow. It’s...it’s really nice to see you again, you know?

Why don’t you have a seat? We have so much to catch up on. Tell me everything!

What? You’re kidding, right?

Excuse me, helmet?

You’re leaving? Already? But you just got here!

Yeah. I know you’re part of the catering staff for the wedding. I can see your uniform. But you realize my family hired you, right? (A little laugh) You won’t get in trouble. Don’t worry.

What do you mean, you’re not sure?

Really? You think your manager won’t like you taking a break?

I see. Well, why don’t I call him then? I have his number.

Oh, no no no. You sit right there, mister. (Another giggle) Make yourself comfortable on my bed.

*(SFX: Dialling a number)*

I honestly don’t see what you’re so worried about. Help yourself to some of the coffee and cookies. You did bring them all the way up here.

(Sighing, speaking almost fondly) Still so shy, even after all I did to help you break out of it. You really haven’t grown up, have you, helmet?

(More formal and curt)

Yeah. Hello. Am I speaking to Mr. Brighton?

I’m doing well. There’s no problem. It’s just about the attendant you sent up to my room.

Yeah. Him. You see, he’s actually a...friend of mine, from all the way back in school. I was quite delighted to meet him after such a long time.

That is very astute, Mr. Brighton. I’d very much like to spend some time catching up with my old friend. Do you think you could delegate his duties to someone else for the rest of the evening?

Great. Oh, and I hope you won’t be deducting his pay for keeping me company. He is, after all, only doing his job.

Wonderful. Thank you, Mr. Brighton. Have a lovely night as well.

(Back to her warm, friendly tone)

There. That wasn’t so difficult, was it?

Hey. No need to thank me for such a small favour. If anything, I should be thanking you. I was so terribly bored before you showed up.

*(SFX: Rustling of sheets)*

(Softly) You don’t mind if I sit next to you, right?

Yeah. It’s my bed, but I don’t want to invade your space. I did enough of that during school. (A small giggle)

You sure?

Good. Thank you.

Oh yes, it’s my big sister’s wedding. And I’m so happy for her! (Giggling)

She and her husband to be- mmnn, they’re so deeply in love. My sis wanted a small wedding with just friends and family, but you know how our mother gets sometimes. She wanted to do it “in proper fashion”, whatever that means.

Yeah. I suppose it means a lot more work for you. Aww. I’m so sorry!

Hey, Helmet. What’s this? You haven’t poured yourself a cup yet! I thought I told you to help yourself to the coffee.

Well, it’s too late now. Here, let me.

*(SFX: Clinking of cutlery. Pouring coffee.)*

Drink it while it’s hot. It’ll help in this weather.

Oh? You still can’t drink coffee when it’s too hot? (Sighing) My bad. I’d forgotten.

This...this does bring back memories, doesn’t it? We’d have coffee in your room whenever I came over for our study sessions. I kind of miss that, honestly.

Yeah. Your room had this really cosy vibe to it. And your eyes seemed to light up whenever you tried to teach me stuff. I normally couldn’t get a word out of you, but when it was just the two of us in your room, you suddenly had so many things to tell me.

Hey! Take that back! You never bored me. Why would you say that, helmet?

No. I enjoyed hearing you talk. You assume too much.

I’m sorry? What do you mean by that?

No. No, you- (scoffing)- you just said you always have. I heard you. What have you always assumed?

(Gently) If there’s something you want to say to me, please say it in plain terms. I...I know I’ve hurt you in the past. Trust me, I know.

Hm. Yeah. Maybe *we* don’t have to talk about it. But I do.

I’ve been meaning to clear things with you for- for a very long time. To apologize for all the things I did. But I never got the chance. And now, by some stroke of fate, you’re here. I really am happy to see you. You deserve an explanation.

No. You do. And it’s not like you have to be anywhere else for the next few hours, so...(taking a deep breath)...listen. High school me was a bitch.

There are very, very few things I did in school which I’m proud of. But I want you to know I’m not that person anymore. And I know that’s probably what every abuser says but I’ve tried hard to change. I’ve done a lot of thinking about the things I regret. And my biggest regret, is the way I treated you.

I shouldn’t have made your life at school so miserable. But I-I’m not that girl anymore. The one who broke your bicycle on purpose.

I didn’t want to actually break it, you know? I started calling you “helmet” because I like- (sighing) I thought it was cute. You’d always ride your bike to school and have that helmet on. You took road safety pretty seriously, didn’t you?

You don’t mind if I still call you that...right?

Helmet?

Thanks. So, I was- I was telling you I didn’t want to actually break that bike you loved so much. It was just another one of my pranks. I saw it parked outside, and I just pushed it onto the concrete. And I laughed when you ran off in such a panic after school to pick it up. That thing was so old and rusty, the chains had broken off from the impact.

I didn’t understand why you were so heartbroken over a simple bike. But later I felt bad about it. I offered to pay for the repairs but you just wouldn’t let me. You weren’t even mad at me. And that- that’s when it all got even worse, I think.

I couldn’t understand why you weren’t angry with me. And if you were, why did you keep it buried deep down? Why did you keep all your emotions buried? It’s not healthy. I wanted to get a reaction out of you. I wanted you to tell me to stop. I wanted you to fight back. To stand up for yourself. To do anything, really, instead of just taking it. But you- you never did, helmet.

I’m not going to lie to you. I didn’t give you so much of my...bad attention...because I wanted you to break out of your shell or anything. I just wanted to find out how far I could push you. And you were fun to- to play with. I...I think I enjoyed having control over you.

I’m sorry. Once I decided to indulge myself, I just couldn’t stop. It was just teasing at first, but then I called you so many awful names. I spread rumours about you and everyone believed me. I was the most popular girl in school, after all. I now wish I hadn’t been but it was never in my control. People treat you differently when your parents own a large company, don’t they?

You’re right. I suppose you wouldn’t know. But even if you were in the limelight like me, you’d probably still be kinder than I was. I’m sorry for turning everyone against you. You were already an outsider but everyone just went out of their way to make you feel bad. Even the handful of friends you had.

But you still didn’t fight back. You just stood there as I mocked you. Made you feel small and powerless. Your quiet voice, your habit to keep to yourself, the- the almost lifeless look in your eyes- I didn’t like it. You made me uncomfortable.

That’s what I told everyone. You made me feel uncomfortable. That you were a creep.

No. You’re not. Please don’t do this.

I spray painted that word on your locker. Creep. I spray painted loser on it. I...I did nothing as everyone pushed you around and made fun of you.

Yeah. It might be all in the past, but I’m still sorry. I didn’t want to actually damage you.

(Sighing) Sorry again. That- that was a poor choice of words. I’m still not very good at this.

You’re not damaged. You’re not a creep. And you’re not a failure. Don’t talk about yourself that way.

Because I don’t like it. You’re just saying it out of spite.

You think I haven’t noticed? It’s not your fault you couldn’t get your dream job after college. You’ve seen what the economy is like. Just look at what’s happening in most of the major corporations. You aren’t alone. Life can throw you in the worst of circumstances on a whim.

It’s a shame. You were always so curious and intelligent in school. Which is why, I know you’ll turn things around eventually.

Oh, it’s not wishful thinking. What did you say you studied in college again?

I see.

Nothing. I was just...just thinking how well you’d fit in at this new department I’m building.

I’m being serious. I’d be happy to set up an interview. I’m pretty sure I could find you a suitable job in our company.

What? Think about it! I could really use you by my side, you know.

Hm? Yeah. I...I suppose I’ve done well for myself. Thanks.

My sister and I have actually increased the company’s valuation by about three times over the past year. With the help of our wonderful employees, of course! It has been hectic, but man, it has also been quite the ride! (Giggling)

Oh, I worked hard after joining the company. There was so much I learnt on the job. I didn’t think I’d enjoy running the business, but it was more rewarding than I imagined.

No, silly, I don’t just mean in terms of money. It was-

Well, the most important thing is what you do after you get your foot in the door, don’t you think? It takes money to create money. There’s nothing wrong with that.

Helmet. I’m sorry for being awful to you in the past. I truly do regret it. But I’m not going to apologize for being successful.

Listen to me. It’s tempting to want to hate yourself and drown in self-pity. But it’s just not constructive. You have to keep moving, and you have to take the opportunities you get.

(Soft) Let me set up something, yes?

(Sighing) Don’t be like that. You have to move on from the past eventually. That’s why we’re talking. You have to let me help you work through it. You have to-

Sorry. I have no right to tell you what you have to do anymore, have I? I just- I want you to take care of yourself. Really.

(Sombre, gentle) Are you? You don’t look like you’re taking care of yourself. You said the same thing to me after those boys had hurt you.

Do you remember? There were four of them. And they weren’t just pushing you or shoving you. They- They were brutal. They were punching and kicking you like animals. I was horrified. I stopped them. I ran out onto the terrace and I shouted at them to leave. I threatened to have them thrown out of school if they didn’t. And I very well would have. I felt this rage- this hatred- seething inside me on seeing how they had hurt you. You were bleeding. Your skin had bruises.

Even I realised what a hypocrite I sounded like when I asked you why you didn’t call me. But I couldn’t hold myself back. It was suddenly difficult to speak and I-I-

I was crying? Oh. I-I don’t remember that. But I did cry afterwards. I never meant for you to actually get hurt. What happened was my fault.

Oh, come on, helmet. If I’d have just left you alone, others would have as well.

I wanted you to blame me. To tell me you hated me. But all you said was...was that you were okay. That you’d take care of yourself.

Of course I didn’t believe you. I took you to the nurse’s office and I didn’t leave your side for the rest of the day. For the first time in a long time, we had an actual conversation. I decided not to let anybody else harm you again. So, I kind of just told everyone you were off limits after that.

Yeah. That was me. But I didn’t want you to get the wrong idea, like I suddenly had a soft spot for you or anything. So I still made you do my homework and write my assignments. I’ve...I’ve always been too comfortable with the idea of using you, huh?

I’m sorry for that too.

Well, yeah. You never protested about it. And I kept wondering why for quite a while. Before I finally realised...you had a crush on me, didn’t you?

Despite everything I’d done, for reasons I couldn’t even imagine, you somehow still liked me. That, that is why you never lashed out at me or fought back.

It’s true, isn’t it?

I see. Thank you, helmet. I never told you at the time, but I liked the thought of being your secret crush. It struck a chord within me. It’s part of why I started seeing you more often. Coming over to your house for studying.

I was going through a break up at the time, if you remember. Sven, my boyfriend, had just ended things with me because he thought I was too controlling. Can you believe that? Him, breaking up with *me*? My teenage self certainly couldn’t. I’d only kept him around because he was good looking.

He was tall, and had this voice on the huskier side, and his eyes- they were this dreamy shade of blue. He was handsome. But he was dumb. Boring. I never had a stimulating conversation with him like- like I had with you, whenever I hung out at your house. And he was just as shallow as I had been.

You know, he only got together with me for my money and popularity. And because I looked pretty. He probably just hoped to marry into my family. There was never anything meaningful between us. If we were using each other, I might as well be the one to break things off. You know?

I’m quite grateful to you for helping me through all that. I really needed a friend and you- you were there. I was full of regret for how horribly I’d treated you. I wish I’d tried to understand you. I never realised that you genuinely struggled to communicate with people. That you just didn’t fit into our culture of parties and holiday resorts and socializing. And there was nothing wrong with that. It was my fault for being unable to accept you were different.

I was so happy you decided to open yourself up to me, you know? In those few weeks before the fall dance- I wanted to help you make up for all the fun you’d missed out on in high school. Do you remember? I took you shopping. Dressed you in all those sleek outfits. Got you a proper haircut. I took you to my favourite restaurants and cafes and I- I tried to encourage you to talk to others, and be more confident. And despite all your protests, I even introduced you to my family. You were the first boy I brought home.

Yeah. It’s true. And despite you still being shy around new people, you enjoyed having dinner with us. You told me that.

My parents and my sister took such a liking to you. I felt like things were finally okay between the two of us. Even though I still made you do my homework, I- (giggling)- I, I was genuinely happy. Everybody at school had to pick their jaws off the floor when they saw us walking together through the hallways, holding hands. And between the two of us, helmet, you were the only one who was blushing and embarrassed.

I really enjoyed spending time with you. That night at the fall dance- the night went like a dream. I was smiling the entire time we were together. Everything just felt so right, you know? I forgot about that jerk Sven who was staring at us heartbroken, I forgot about my guilt over how I’d behaved with you in the past, I...I just looked into your eyes, so full of adoration for me, and I...I almost forgot how comfortable I always had been with using you.

(Sighing) I walked up to my ex, and I rubbed in his face just what he’d given up. I humiliated him. (Quietly, looking at the floor) I told everyone present there to see how I could take somebody- anybody- even the lowliest outcast in school, and change them into...into somebody so much better. To...turn a random loser into someone worthy of me.

I didn’t hold back. I didn’t even realise what I was saying. I just got so caught up in my moment of glory.

Afterwards, I just grabbed your hand like you were a plaything and dragged you out of there all victoriously. I had such a smug smile on my face. When I finally turned to look at you, I didn’t even understand why your eyes had tears in them. Why- Why you were looking at me like- like- I- (taking a deep breath)...I can’t forget that look. It killed me to see you like that. All I could do was ask you what was wrong.

I thought you’d know I didn’t mean what I said at the dance. That it was only a stunt. I cared about you. I wasn’t going to throw you away. How could I? I’d fallen in- in love. I-

Helmet...?

(Monotonic) You’re right.

I really shouldn’t be doing this to you. I’m- god, I’m such a bitch! (Bitter laughter) Even after so long, I’m still *such* a bitch! (More laughter- dry and mirthless)

All I’ve ever done is hurt you. I’m so sorry, honey. Why would you believe me when I tell you I’d fallen in love? You shouldn’t. I...I never deserved your trust. I’m sorry, my darling.

But I was just so convinced that you were meant for me, you know? That despite everything, I’d finally found my other half.

I’m so convinced even now.

No. Don’t pull away. I won’t hurt you. Never again. I promise. I’m just...just trying to make up for lost time.

(Kissing the listener. She makes happy, content little noises. After a few kisses, the listener pulls away.)

Honey?

Wait. Where are you going?

Honey?

No. Wait! You can’t leave! I wasn’t trying to force myself, I-

(Almost angrily) Stop. You know I’m your boss, right? You don’t get to walk away from me. You’ve been avoiding me for the last five years. I’ve been on my own for so long because of- because of you!

(Breathing raggedly) I kept hoping I’d...see you again...that we’d be together again...I love you...I can’t let you leave again.

Where are you going?

(Softer, almost pleading) Wait. Please.

Please. Just...just stay a little longer. I’m sorry. I won’t- I won’t do that again.

I’m sorry. For everything.

On that night, I didn’t think I’d make you cry. I wanted to explain. To confess how I really felt. But I never got the chance. You ran away and you didn’t turn back. I kept calling your phone, sending you walls of text, but you didn’t respond. I didn’t have the courage to go to your house again. I felt like shit for what I’d done.

I really thought I could make it up to you. If you’d only let me explain. But you- you stopped coming to school. You changed schools right in the middle of our final year.

I tried to reconnect with you on social media after that, you know? Many times. But it was like you wanted me out of your life. And I don’t blame you. I just wish that you’d...you’d see me.

I’ve changed. I have.

I’ve not been with anyone else since then. What I felt in those few weeks with you- I don’t think I’ll find that with somebody else.

I do! I do mean it.

I want you. I...I want to start over.

Honey, if you think I can have anybody I like, I should be able to have you. I don’t want anybody else. And...I still look like her, don’t I? Beautiful?

Don’t you still have a crush on me?

I...I really want to try again with you.

You probably need some time to think. I understand. You don’t have to give me an answer right now.

Helmet?

Can I...get a hug?

(A longer pause)

(Soft breathing sounds, content little noises)

Thank you, honey.

Mhm. Don’t pull away. Stay. Please.

Stay...a little longer...

I don’t have a date to my own sister’s wedding. You know how much that sucks?

Yeah. It sucks a lot. Maybe you could be my date.

Pretty please? Big sis would love that so much.

I’ll even call Mr. Brighton to tell him on your behalf. That’s not a bad deal, right?

You’re quiet. I can’t tell what you’re thinking. I don’t want to push you away again. I’ll let you decide.

Just let me know what your answer is once you’re sure. I really hope you’ll say yes. That...(giggling happily, almost like she’s drunk)...that would be nice. But I won’t be impatient.

You know, I still don’t believe you. Not when you...when you say you can take care of yourself.

I know I said I won’t be impatient. But I...

I don't know what to make of your silence.

(Kissing him briefly) My sweet boy. My darling.

Let me take care of you from now on. I really want to.

Helmet? Are you still listening?

Helmet...

What do you say?

it's a story about god's dream:

in the beginning,there was nothing.
 and then ,the dream was everything. 
everything roared like a lion with countless eyes , ramming and devouring each other .
seasons came and nothing left,and in their dreams they saw nothing.

in the second dream there were two dreams .
there was a wild boundless garden with many, what you would call ,sheeps , wolfs and bushes with thorns and sweet fruit .
many creatures ,all roaring with life .
and there was a Gardener who saw in his dream what the beasts and plants are seeing in their eyes.

after he saw in his dream that everything ""I""s and roars ,even the sheep thought that they were lions.
 
he immediately tended to cut down the thorny bushes that the sheeps got tangled with while eating the sweet fruit, that naturally made them drunk and even grow their wool resembling the main of a lion .
he built a fence of the thorny bushes , and a gate ,so the sheeps could go out to the fields of the wild bush.

then he fed the hungry wolf who couldn't get near the thorns of the bush that the sheeps were traped in.
and in return the wolf became loyal to the gardener ,and helped to impose his will on the wild.

the sun came,and the drunk sheeps did not burn in the bush with the dry thorns, but were trimmed ,and herd by the wolf to safety.
 
wild beasts came and the loyal wolf fended them off. floods came and the fences protected them.

in your dream, the third dream,
there are three dreams .
 the second dream ,that of the garden, the Gardeners dream and his deeds . 
and the first dream of the roaring sheeps , that threatened to burn everything in their drunkenness, in a garden of dry thorns and starving wondering wolves. 

all had to give up the the thing that they loved most, the thing that defined them,
but separated them from eachother and eventually from life itself.

they had to separate from them selves to for the principal of existence ,in the image of god.

                  -end-


-analysis and characters-

this story weaved in my mind from separate metaphors an impressios,

sheep vs lion -
a metaphor i heard once ,
of something in us that thinks its the king that protects and knows everything but in turn causes stagnation. it is said that in order to overcome this,we should make that lion in to a lamb and sacrifice it.

the sheeps- 
many as one ,opposed to singular that is many and therefore opposed to god.
also represents the multitude of personas the individual has .

also the sheeps connection to dreams ,as in counting sheeps before falling asleep.

there is of course the story of the coffee bean , the strange behaviour of goats after eating from the coffee bush, ,which are not sheeps but close enough.

the wild bush - represents in this case the beliefs we passively accumulate ,that if unattended grow wild ,and restrict our ego.
but can be shaped merely by conscious light,
to gather ,protect and feed it .

the wolf/dog -  represent intuition, connection to the unknown.
considered  as  one of the greatest conquers of man.
c g Jung talked about how the archetyp of a saviour ,or jesus, experienced as a dog in the dreams of his patients. 

numbers- 
0 -nothing - ultimate potential
1-something
2-something from nothing,separation , duality , stagnation 
3-the observer - the third elusive force that overcomes duality and stagnation. represents  motion,life .

dreams -  from the unknown , connection to past and future 
...
ok
there is always more ,
but need to go on with life.

thank you for reading 

apologies for the.. wording and grammar,,
it looks ok to me right now but there is always something 
 
hope you liked it

It’s always been my experience that UPS goes harder even when I lived in a building without an elevator which says a lot. 

Fedex did have some suspicious shenanigans going on with my packages during this process. I live in Atlanta and when one reached austell ga, one of the packages ended up going to freaking Florida! I was watching and calling trying to understand wtf they were doing when it had made it so close to Atlanta 🤦🏾‍♀️ \*deep sighs\* 

But anyways, I have a FedEx delivery manager set up with instructions and I’m clear about there being an elevator. This has been ignored so I saw it was close, got on the phone with customer service and made sure they dispatched the driver my instructions again! 

A 3rd party truck showed up at our parcel  room (not in my actual building) so I wasn’t sure it was FedEx. I went and watched him unload and thought he’d left the neighborhood and maybe mine was on a different truck. I go in a cafe to grab a coffee and through the window I see it parked at my building and get excited.   


I run over to hold the door for him and I'm looking and see the 2 largest boxes are in fact mine! I tell him and help him get it all in the elevator and find the first drop for my neighbor. Then he carefully brought my huge heavy boxes and slid them inside my foyer! I gave him a 20 and wished him happy holidays!

I’m 16, I have never once had a job, and likely won’t need to until college. That’s why I’m asking this- I don’t have the experience to tell whether or not this is a problem.

I don’t usually leave the house. If I do, it’s with my mom, because I can’t drive. If my mom and I leave in the mornings, say, to go to Meals on Wheels to volunteer, we always get Dunkin’.

I’m a type one diabetic. I’m also autistic, and have a some limits on what I can eat. When I do go to Dunkin’, I always order the same thing. An iced matcha latte thingy, with oat milk and sweet n low. It can’t have any regular milk in it because of the taste, and it can’t have any regular sugar in it because, well, diabetes. 

Inevitably, I sent a drink back to be remade because it had regular milk and regular sugar in it. I may be autistic, but I can still tell people’s emotions. The person behind the counter looked incredibly annoyed with me.

Am I making things harder on the workers? Every time I have to tell them to correct something, I always stumble over myself trying to be as polite as possible.

He’s great at picking out gifts for my kids, but for me it’s like he’s clueless and honestly it just feels like he’s lazy sometimes.
For example, last year he filled my stocking with Reese’s peanut butter cups. Reese’s peanut butter cups are not something I’m particularly fond of. I like dark chocolate and trying different kinds of speciality food items, like spicy chocolate or something different and interesting. I also have celiac disease, so it’s hard, I get it.. but I feel like you can try harder. He just knows that peanut butter cups are GF and that I can eat them :/
This morning he made Starbucks brand morning blend coffee from the grocery store, and I was surprised, as he usually likes dark roasts. When I asked him, he said that he put it in my stocking, but that I had run out of coffee, so he used it. Lol. Again, that’s not a coffee I would normally pick out, and it’s just like some crap from the grocery store. I don’t need to have a bunch of expensive items, but I do like things that are exciting and different. I told him how I felt and what I like, and he told me that in fact, he is very thoughtful. Lol.

He then messages me 4 days later apologizing for not calling me sooner saying he was busy and send me a video of him and his on ft playing around. The friend was a girl so I got mad because he hasn't had time to call or ft but he has time to call her. We also live far apart so we can't see each other every day we have to plan to see each other which is why I was so mad.  But a couple of days ago I mailed him cups he brought from me because I work at a coffee company. And his mom recieved the package and askhim who sent them  and he told her my friend sent them she really nice. He then called and asked me were friends right? So I said yes he then get quiet and tells me he will call me back tomorrow. And of course he never did and I didn't reach out to him because at this point I'm over him.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you need a quick pick-me-up, many people turn to **5-hour ENERGY**. This small, portable energy shot promises to boost your energy levels and enhance alertness, making it a popular choice for those long workdays or midday lulls. Let’s explore the benefits and drawbacks of using 5-hour ENERGY for a quick energy boost.

### Benefits of Using 5-hour ENERGY

Many users report positive experiences with 5-hour ENERGY. Here are some of the key benefits:

- **Immediate Energy Boost:** One of the most appealing features is its quick-acting formula. Within minutes of consuming it, you might feel a noticeable increase in your energy levels.
- **No Sugar Crash:** Unlike many energy drinks that contain high amounts of sugar, 5-hour ENERGY is sugar-free. This can help prevent the dreaded sugar crash that often follows sugary drinks.
- **Convenient Packaging:** The small size makes it easy to carry in your bag or pocket, ensuring you can take it anytime you need a boost, whether at work, while traveling, or even at home.
- **Variety of Flavors:** Available in multiple flavors, it caters to different tastes. This variety can make it more enjoyable for regular users.
- **Enhanced Focus:** Many users report an increase in focus and mental clarity after consuming 5-hour ENERGY, helping them tackle tasks more effectively.

### Potential Drawbacks of Using 5-hour ENERGY

While the benefits are appealing, it’s essential to consider the potential drawbacks as well. Using 5-hour ENERGY might not be suitable for everyone. Below are some concerns associated with this product:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/5-hour-energy  
  
- **Caffeine Content:** Each shot contains about 200 mg of caffeine. For individuals sensitive to caffeine, this can lead to jitters, anxiety, or insomnia if taken close to bedtime.
- **Dependence:\*\* Regular use can lead to dependency, where you feel unable to function without it. This might cause issues when trying to cut back.**
- **Limited Effect Duration:** While it provides a quick burst of energy, the effect generally lasts only a few hours. When the boost fades, some may feel even more tired than before.
- **Not a Substitute for Sleep:** While 5-hour ENERGY can help you stay awake, it’s not a substitute for a good night’s sleep. Relying on it can disrupt your natural sleep cycle.
- **Possible Side Effects:** Some users may experience digestive issues or increased heart rate after consuming it, making it crucial to be aware of how your body reacts.

### How to Use 5-hour ENERGY Effectively

If you choose to use 5-hour ENERGY, here are some strategies to maximize its benefits while minimizing drawbacks:

- **Use Sparingly:** Limit your intake to occasions when you truly need a boost. This helps prevent dependence and minimizes potential side effects.
- **Timing Matters:** Consider when you consume it. Taking it early in the day can help you avoid sleep disturbances later.
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking water alongside can help mitigate some of the side effects like dryness or jitters.
- **Combine with Healthy Habits:** Use 5-hour ENERGY as an aid rather than a primary source of energy. Focus on maintaining a balanced diet and getting regular exercise.

### Final Thoughts

5-hour ENERGY can provide a desirable solution for those moments when you feel sluggish and need a boost. However, be mindful of its caffeine content and potential side effects. By using it responsibly and in conjunction with healthy habits, you can enjoy the benefits while minimizing any adverse effects. Always listen to your body and consult with a healthcare provider if needed.

Comparing 5-hour ENERGY to Other Popular Energy-Boosting Alternatives
---------------------------------------------------------------------

In a world where everyone is constantly on the go, the need for quick energy boosters has grown tremendously. Among the many options available, **5-hour ENERGY** stands out as a popular choice for those seeking a quick and effective way to enhance their alertness. But how does it compare to other energy-boosting alternatives? Let’s dive into the details.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/5-hour-energy  
  
**5-hour ENERGY** is a small, convenient shot that claims to provide you with a boost of energy without the crash that often accompanies other caffeinated products. It typically contains about 200 mg of caffeine, along with B vitamins and amino acids, which aim to improve energy levels and concentration. But what about other popular options like energy drinks, coffee, and natural energy sources? Here’s a detailed breakdown:

### Energy Drinks

Energy drinks such as Red Bull and Monster have become a staple for many. They contain high levels of caffeine and various other ingredients, including taurine and sugar, to enhance flavor and energy levels. Consider the following:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/5-hour-energy  
  
- **Caffeine Content:** Energy drinks often contain more caffeine than **5-hour ENERGY**. A standard 8.4 oz can of Red Bull contains about 80 mg of caffeine.
- **Additional Ingredients:** These drinks usually have added sugars, which can contribute to a quick spike in energy followed by a crash.
- **Serving Size:** Unlike **5-hour ENERGY**, which is consumed in a small shot, energy drinks often come in larger cans, requiring you to drink more to achieve similar effects.

### Coffee

Coffee is a classic energy booster enjoyed by millions worldwide. Here’s how it stacks up against **5-hour ENERGY**:

- **Caffeine Levels:** An average cup of brewed coffee contains between 95 to 200 mg of caffeine. This means coffee can provide a similar energy boost.
- **Health Benefits:** Coffee is rich in antioxidants, which can promote overall health. However, it lacks the additional B vitamins found in **5-hour ENERGY**.
- **Preparation Time:** Making coffee can take longer than consuming a **5-hour ENERGY** shot. If you’re looking for speed, **5-hour ENERGY** has the advantage here.

### Natural Energy Sources

If you’re concerned about artificial ingredients and caffeine, natural energy sources like herbal teas and smoothies can be appealing. Here’s what you need to know:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/5-hour-energy  
  
- **Herbal Teas:** Some herbal teas, like guarana or matcha, can provide a gentle lift in energy thanks to their natural caffeine content. They also come with various health benefits.
- **Fruit Smoothies:** Combining fruits like bananas and berries with yogurt can provide a refreshing energy boost through natural sugars and nutrients.
- **Time and Effort:** While these options can be healthier, they often require more preparation and time than just grabbing a **5-hour ENERGY** shot.

### Choosing the Right Option

When deciding between these options, it all comes down to your personal needs and lifestyle. Here are some factors to consider:

- **Speed:** If you need something quick, **5-hour ENERGY** is hard to beat.
- **Healthier Alternatives:** If you're looking for a healthier and more natural option, consider herbal teas or smoothies.
- **Caffeine Sensitivity:** Pay attention to your body's response to caffeine. If you're sensitive, you may prefer lower-caffeine options like some teas.

Ultimately, **5-hour ENERGY** is a unique energy-boosting solution, especially when you need a quick pick-me-up. It offers a convenient way to enhance your alertness without the volume and potential sugar crash of energy drinks. However, it’s essential to weigh the benefits against the alternatives. Each option has its pros and cons, and finding what works best for you will lead to healthier choices and sustained energy throughout your busy day. Consider trying out different methods until you find your ideal energy booster!

### Conclusion

As you weigh the benefits and drawbacks of using 5-hour ENERGY, it's clear that this small energy shot offers quick solutions for anyone needing a boost. Its convenience and rapid effectiveness make it an attractive option for busy individuals whether at work, during travel, or right before a workout. Each shot can provide you with a renewed sense of alertness without the crash commonly associated with sugary energy drinks.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/5-hour-energy  
  
However, it’s vital to consider potential downsides, such as reliance on caffeine and other stimulants, which may lead to jitteriness or sleep disturbances. Balancing its use with a healthy lifestyle and sleep habits becomes essential to avoid these pitfalls.

When compared to other popular energy-boosting alternatives, 5-hour ENERGY holds its own, especially against energy drinks and caffeine pills. While energy drinks often deliver a sugar high followed by a crash, 5-hour ENERGY offers a more controlled and sustained energy boost without the added calories. On the other hand, caffeine pills provide a concentrated dose of caffeine but lack the variety of flavors and convenience offered by these shots.

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/5-hour-energy  
  
Ultimately, the choice between 5-hour ENERGY and its alternatives hinges on your personal needs and lifestyle. It can serve as a practical tool in your toolkit for managing energy levels throughout the day. When used responsibly, 5-hour ENERGY can enhance your productivity and help you navigate demanding tasks with ease. Always remember to listen to your body and consult with a healthcare professional if you have concerns about caffeine consumption. Embracing a balanced approach will allow you to take full advantage of the energy boost while minimizing potential risks.",1,1735066150.0,AmazonBrandReviews,0,1.0,False

After she showed no effort in caring for the first one, I advised against the second. She argued and yelled saying ‘It’s her house she can do what she wants!!’. I said an animal is a lot of responsibility. She retorted saying she wasn’t 5. Ironically.

The first cat she got she put it in a room to adjust it. She already had an original third cat…) She never cleaned this room the cat was in. She finally took the first new cat to get groomed (per my recommendation bc it came from a pound), then put it back in the dirty room. When I suggested that she clean it, she went into a panic frenzy and started berating my dad to vacuum the room for her and to clean everything. Among other things.

The second new cat she got, she throws in the bathroom when she can’t handle it. It wants to play all the time. She doesn’t want to play with it. She just wants to lay in bed and for them all to lay in bed with her. She puts this cat in the bathroom at night. It never has clean water, if it has any water anyways.

The water bowl downstairs is never filled. My mom feeds the cats in paper bowls and they get left around the house. One time I counted 9 in the downstairs alone.

I use to always pick up after her. I finally stopped. She noticed and asked me to help her. I just ignore her. She is **retired**. If she’s not home it’s bc she has a breakfast date, a lunch date, a coffee date, or a dinner date with her friends. She does 2-3 of these a day, minimum 3-4 times a week. She is never home to take care of these cats and always expects me to. I finally stopped. I’m **Disabled**, I can barely take care of myself.

She then complains about being tired all the time after she rushes around all week going out with her friends. She hardly ever cleans the house. And when she does we hear about her great efforts. We have a maid who comes once every other week. 

She is always out buying unnecessary things. The house is cluttered. It’s not a hoarder house but it’s gotten worse with buying things over the years. She has four closets that’s she uses and are stuffed to the brim. You can’t even walk in her walk-in closet without tripping. She put a rack in it.

1hljql9,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1hljql9/a_christmas_sermon_not_found_in_sacrament_meeting/,A Christmas Sermon not found in Sacrament Meeting,"TL,DR: Below is a link to a Christmas Sermon I found incredibly profound, prefaced with my view that these types of sermons are completely missing from the LDS Faith.

I would describe myself as a PIMO (physically in, mentally out). I attend primarily out of family obligation. For many years, I was able to make this work as I often found snippets of what I would describe as ""truth"" at church. That is, I felt like I could learn things from scriptures, improve my personal morality and grow, largely through talks and lessons given. I saw value in portions of what was said during church meetings, even General Conference. Even clouded in the dogmas and often framed in misleading ways, there were good things said at church.

In recent years, however, this seems to have changed. I'm not sure how to put my finger on it, but the Church of Russell M. Nelson, despite saying the name ""Jesus Christ"" frequently, speaks little of Christ's teachings. Maybe I've changed.

Talks in Sacrament Meeting are focused almost entirely on temples, covenants, covenant path, and doubts. That is, avoiding or overcoming doubts. ""The church is true and nothing else matters"" seems to be the message. I see no value in that--it does not make me a better person. It does not uplift me or those around me. It does not help me find ways to show love and kindness for others. In fact, the church seems to have become a selfish, exclusive, self-serving environment with increased hostility toward unbelievers. Increasingly, I come away from church meetings feeling it was time wasted. I sat through 10-ish hours of General Conference a couple of months ago, and found little to nothing of value.

I could also describe myself as agnostic. That is, I do not see enough evidence to support the claim that there is an omnipotent being out there who cares if I consume coffee or say cuss words. But I still love a good sermon.

This year my ward, like most wards in the church did a Christmas program. It was almost entirely music, except for a single talk at the end of the meeting. It was a decent talk, given by a well-intentioned person sharing their feelings and testimony. But if I'm being honest, it left me wanting. That is, I did not come out of that meeting feeling edified. Missing was a true Christmas message. Missing was an appreciation for Jesus' birth, and Jesus' teachings.

Fast forward to today. I'm scrolling Reddit and come across a post linking to a sermon by a preacher who I believe is located somewhere in Texas. I watch the video, my jaw almost hitting the floor for how good his sermon was. The video was posted on his own channel. I go there and find his most recent post, a Christmas sermon from a couple of weeks ago. 14-ish minutes later I'm still in awe. Here is a real, uplifting Christmas message. The comments are full of people saying: ""I'm an Atheist and this was the best sermon I've heard in years"" and ""if all Churches were like this, I would probably attend.""

So, my fellow heathens, I would like to share that sermon. Not to tell you what to believe or not to believe, but rather for those of you who, like me, want to hear a good Christmas Sermon. If you're looking for a talk with some value, something that will uplift and teach, something you'll never hear in an LDS sacrament meeting, here you go:

1hljqct,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1hljqct/for_those_who_suffer_or_mourn_this_christmas/,For those who suffer or mourn this Christmas - ,"You aren't alone. Whether you mourn, or you find yourself alone, or you suffer with hunger, poverty, despair -- there are countless other Christians who feel exactly the same way as you.   
  
I've found myself adrift for much of this year. My dad passed quite suddenly and unexpectedly from gastric cancer in April. Since then, everything has felt a bit uncanny, unreal. Life goes on much the same as it did before. But at times it feels like I'm seeing the world from through a prism, almost from the back rather than the front, if that makes any sense at all. The prevailing feeling is one like *I don't belong in this timeline, I belong in the one where none of this ever happened.* 

Unsurprisingly, the holidays have sparked very little joy for me this year. It all passes in front of me in blurred motion lines, and I have mostly found myself nauseous in the churning waves of all the busyness that prevails in this season. 

But there is something about Christmas itself that feels more *real* to me this year. 

Like the pain in Mary's lower back and the exhaustion that must have pressed on her forehead like a vice as she and Joseph make the long and tiresome journey to Bethlehem -- this year *I feel that.* The anxiety they must have felt at every whip of the wind or every flicker of torchlight -- *I can relate.* The pang of guilt that Joseph must have felt that he could find no better place for his wife and his infant son -- *I wince at that too.* 

This morning I found myself reflecting on this painting of the Nativity by Edward Burne Jones:

https://preview.redd.it/nk2dex7i6u8e1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a6eaebe58a5216020089cf62bb032c4180f3c73

II was immediately struck by the emphasis of death in the scene. Mary and Jesus lay recumbent and shrouded on a kind of catafalque, reminiscent of a funeral. Joseph is prostrated before them, his head covered, studying (what I assume to be) the prophesies that Christ is to fulfill, including his death and sacrifice. The angels bear signs of his death -- the cup, the burial spice myrrh, and the crown of thorns. Above the scene, there is a transcription: ""*Propter miseriam inopum et gemitum pauperis nunc exsurgam dicit Dominus*"", the Latin rendering of Psalm 92: ""Because of the misery of the poor and the groaning of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD"". 

Come, Lord. 

So much of the Christian life is spent in tension. We are caught between life and death. Between transcendent splendor and in the imminent mire of mundane strife. Between joy and unending and the dissatisfaction, the changes and chances of this life. So even in the joy of Christmas we feel the weight of the cross. This place of joy knows grief and despair too. 

Even so, one thing I've found to be true in this painful year - you often find comfort and relief in the strangest places. There was a man I watched at an Oktoberfest celebration this year who was bouncing his knee in time with the music (or rather badly attempting to keep time with the music) with a big toothy grin -- he reminded me of dad a whole world away. The unnecessarily fancy mug dad had that is now on my desk and keeps my coffee at exactly 138 degrees (just the way dad liked it, apparently) - just staring at that has given me a strange comfort. My dad hated my music (metal), but the [gawdy shirt that a favorite band](https://www.nightshiftmerch.com/products/allegaeon-hotdog-t-shirt) very sympathetically gave my sister the night we found out the cancer was inoperable -- it makes me smile and think of how much he'd have hated it every time she wears it. So how fitting it is, then, that we find Jesus in this unexpected place. In the rough and splintered coarseness of a manger. Jesus is both hidden and illuminated, and even if he is just the feeblest ray of hope against the backdrop of despair and death and loss -- it isn't nothing. 

Those of us who suffer, who mourn, who feel pangs of despair this season - we know most acutely what it is to need that joy in a hidden, unexpected place. Maybe we don't feel it this Christmas. God willing the light will shine brighter next year. But Christmas doesn't have to be *merry* to be *good.* So have a good Christmas r/Christianity. The savior is born.

1hljoqk,https://i.redd.it/ltkt7r9mcu8e1.jpeg,Cockroach in ear,"This morning at approximately 5:30 a.m. I woke up and felt like my equilibrium was off. As soon as I moved my head something shot into my ear and was irritating my eardrum. I didn't know what it was and freaked out so I called 911 thinking that was the best option. The fire department arrived and tried using forceps but they were much too large for my ear so we waited for the ambulance. They took a good look inside my ear and said, ""Sorry, you need to go to the ER!"" 

After a 5 minute trip to the ER they put a lidocaine gel that killed the cockroach and then used hemostats to remove the bug. It was nearly painless and quick although uncomfortable as heck! The staff gave me breakfast and coffee while I waited for a ride home. Thank God and Heaven for all the staff that helped me out!!! I was out of the hospital in under an hour and they provided a great breakfast to start my day! 

They were friendly and asked if they could share my story and I said yes. The firefighters, the medics, and even the hospital staff that helped me out said that was the first time they have had an incident of a bug inside someone's ear. Best trip to the hospital I've had in my life! 

Let me tell you from current experience, if you ever find a bug inside your ear, consult with professional medical staff, do not attempt to remove it yourself. And don't trust Google, Google said I should use vegetable oil and warm water to kill the cockroach and remove it.",5,1735065530.0,EmergencyRoom,5,0.86,False

1hljlo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/iitbombay/comments/1hljlo1/roast_iitbs_cse_chatgpt/,Roast IITB's CSE - ChatGPT,"# Ah, IIT Bombay’s CSE…

1. **Tiny Nerd Nation** Sure, CSE folks might look like just another bunch of code-obsessed gremlins in hoodies, but don’t be fooled—there’s nothing “just another” about a clan that collectively mains Stack Overflow more than your average gamer mains Valorant. One glance at their Slack channels and you’ll see the stack traces probably get more love than any living human on campus.
2. **Algorithmic Overload** Ask them about “sorting”—they’ll talk for hours about bubble sort, quicksort, mergesort, Timsort, radixes, BFS, DFS, hyper-trie-warp pipelines (who even knows?). Meanwhile, you just wanted to sort your messy notes in ascending order so you’d look somewhat organized. Good luck prying yourself away when they start performing mental big-O calculations on how many steps it takes to walk to the mess.
3. **24/7 Debug Mode** These folks live in a perpetual loop of *compile, debug, re-compile*. They can’t help but debug everything: from the canteen’s token system to the campus map. A quick trip to SAC? “Wait, let me just replicate the error and fix your approach.” Sure, thanks, but you just lost half an hour listening to them unravel your entire route algorithm.
4. **Unhealthy Relationship with CodeChef/LeetCode** Why stress over final exams when you can stress over yet another day’s “Streak” on LeetCode? Expect them to vanish into 6-hour coding marathons, surfacing only to brag about their new personal best or weep about that one TLE (Time Limit Exceeded) that destroyed their entire sense of self-worth. Meanwhile, your “excessive” Netflix binge looks absolutely innocent compared to the lines of code they’ve typed in the last 24 hours.
5. **Pretentious Jargon Olympics** Listening to them “converse” is basically a front-row seat to a jargon-laden rap battle: “Today, I realized the time complexity for my dynamic BFS is borderline NP-hard in the worst-case scenario,” or “I just found a bug in the memory leak for the multi-threaded concurrency pipeline.” *Umm, yes, buddy, we get it, your lingo is more complex than the entire AIEEE syllabus.*
6. **Silicon Valley Fever** If you eavesdrop on a CSE corridor, you’ll hear three main topics:
   * “Dude, I want to intern at \[insert fancy tech giant here\].”
   * “Dude, I want to do a startup.”
   * “Dude, I want to do a startup at \[insert fancy tech giant here\].” For them, “getting placed in Microsoft or Google” is not a dream, it’s an *inevitable milestone*. Meanwhile, everyone else just prays for a decent CG and some kind of future.
7. **Legendarily Late Sleep Schedules** Ask a CSE friend when they sleep: “At night?” More like 5 a.m. is a suggestion, not a rule. They’ll code all night, living off coffee that might actually be single-handedly fueling the campus Starbucks. If you do see them up in the morning, they’re probably sporting bigger circles under their eyes than the bagels they missed for breakfast.
8. **The “CSE Aura”** The moment you see that meticulously worn-out T-shirt from Hackathon 2kXX or the random GitHub sticker on their laptop, you know you’re about to be lectured on computational complexity. Meanwhile, their casual greeting is “What’s your rank on CodeChef?” so you can confirm your rightful place as a lesser mortal in the CSE cosmos.
9. **An Unholy Merger of Brains and Bravado** Let’s give it to them: they *are* brilliant. But come on, the arrogance is next-level. The flexing about advanced ML models while explaining how ChatGPT’s transformer architecture is “kinda outdated” is the standard flavour of conversation. Because obviously, Google Brain calls them every weekend to get advice.
10. **Success vs. Social Skills** Jokes aside, CSE folks will probably ace interviews, become trillionaires, or rule AI overlords in a near-future dystopia. But first, someone might have to teach them that Python is not the only snake in the world and that “Hello, World!” is not an acceptable conversation starter outside campus.

**Disclaimer**: If you’re a CSE student and you read this, please know we’re absolutely *terrified* of your next-level hacking potential. This roast is strictly comedic, so let’s keep it a joke and not transform it into your next machine-learning project to socially annihilate us. And hey, best of luck with those unstoppable CGPAs and placements—just remember, some of us are still stuck trying to figure out how `grep` works on a Friday night.

1hljikt,https://www.reddit.com/r/IITDelhi/comments/1hljikt/roast_iitds_cse_chatgpt/,Roast IITD's CSE - ChatGPT,"# The Glorious Grind

Let’s face it: **no one** does self-inflicted academic torture quite like IITD CSE. After all, why should you get by with *just* theoretical knowledge and practical skills when you could also develop next-level proficiency in surviving on three hours of sleep and *that one brand of instant noodles you’ve come to confuse with all five food groups*?

# Coding Before Coffee

**Let’s start your day, bright and early at 7 a.m.—** or actually 3 p.m. because your schedule’s been forcibly inverted by the infinite number of code reviews that somehow sprout after midnight. “Early birds get the worm”? In CSE, the only worms are the ones you’re removing from your code so your TA doesn’t demolish you on your lab grade.

# Select All That Apply

* **DSA**: A magical beast you chase from your first year, bestowing illusions of easily cracking Big Tech interviews—only for those illusions to cruelly vanish when you realize you forgot to handle corner cases for your BFS-on-steroids code.
* **Operating Systems**: Because you definitely want to learn the subtle art of mutual exclusion while you and your group are busy excluding each other from the project file to avoid merging conflicts at 5 a.m.
* **Machine Learning**: A noble attempt to get computers to learn. Ironically, you’ll soon realize that your own brain forgot how to learn anything that isn’t taught by an Andrew Ng YouTube video at 1.5x speed.

# The Placement Power Trip

You might think, “At least it’s all worth it for that sweet placement in Big Tech™.” But remember: if you’re not placed at *exactly the same moment* as your best friend, you risk existential crises. Because if your friend got that 50 LPA package, then you *clearly* have to get 60 LPA—otherwise, can you even claim the hallowed title of **Coding God** in the corridors of Kumaon or Satpura?

# Mythical Creatures: Free Time & Hobbies

Congratulations—you’ve jettisoned all your recreational hobbies for the sake of **The Pursuit of Perfect Code**. The next time you see your tennis racket, it’ll be because you used it as a stand to prop your laptop during an all-night debugging session. And forget the existence of sunrises; your only daily sightings are your GitHub commits streak.

# Mantra of Masochism

The only reason you’d ever pick CSE at IITD is because you thrive on the highest levels of self-competition known to mankind. **Why settle for a normal level of imposter syndrome when you can have it on Hard Mode?** Indeed, there’s something about hearing “Your code works on 9999 test cases but fails on the 10,000th” that fosters a *magical sense of camaraderie* among peers, right before you descend into group therapy in the nearest “24x7” canteen.

# The Proud Conclusion

But hey, in the end, you’ll come out with an enhanced ability to:

1. Function on coffee fumes alone.
2. Debug code by telepathy.
3. **Speak fluent C++, Python, Java, and existential dread** all at once.

And, after all, is said and done, you’ll be recognized across the campus for your superhuman skills at ignoring the concept of “enjoying life” in favour of the sweet, sweet gratification of perfecting your next algorithmic masterpiece.

**So here’s to IITD CSE:** the place where your puny mortal soul is sacrificed, but your bragging rights for the next 50 years (and your questionable sense of humour about merges and commits) are *absolutely guaranteed*.",1,1735065034.0,IITDelhi,1,0.6,False

I live in the UK. I am currently 19 (F), and I am studying Profession Culinary Arts Level 1 at college.

If you are reading this, what I am about to tell you will shock a lot of people, so I hope I can get this out there before it's too late.

The last two years have been hell for me, more or worse done than good. In the summer of 2022, amid the stress of my GCSE exams, my dad cheated on my mother. He used to live with us, but an argument with Mum led to him moving out the year before lockdown. He would come by and visit and we would talk about almost everything any anything.

That summer was supposed to be the year I could complete my GCSEs and eventually go on to do whatever it is I want to do in life, and it mostly consisted of pursuing a life as an author, writing my books and getting them published. But the day when Mum told me of Dad's infertility (they were not married), I was infuriating by the timing. I already had to cut ties with my previous friendship group after 5 years of toxic drama and fallouts, and the last thing I wanted to lose my dad.

After a visit to my dad's apartment on a late night, it was true. My mother explained how she went to check up on him and found him coming out with a woman she didn't know. He claimed not to know who she was, which did NOT sound like the dad I once knew. My mother recalled him getting into a black Mercedes and taking off. We went back there, and things got messy as it ended with Mum scratching my dad's taxi with my late grandmother's ice pick.

Immediately, I was furious. How dare he claim not to know my mother right in front of the woman he was seeing? My dad and I were very close. Closer than the best friends I used to have back in secondary school. My mother and I, not so much.  As I was hitting my teen years, things weren't so great, and I could never figure out why we always seemed to hate each other. I always thought I was the problem because I was the only person in my family diagnosed with autism at 10 years old.

The next few days I couldn't think about what had happened. It shook me enough to know what my dad had done. By then I texted my then-boyfriend Dylan (18 M) and my friends about what went down that night. When I returned to school, I refused to keep this a secret and turned to my school's welfare team for help. The whole scenario created a massive distraction for me during my exams and I couldn't afford to fail when that was happening. 

Eventually, it took a toll on my mum when she got sick and was sleeping on the couch for weeks and weeks. The same with me when I had my last exam, History Paper 3. I ended up on the verge of a mental breakdown in the middle of the Science corridor, and it took one teacher to come out of the nearby Science office to know that something was wrong. You want to know what the worst thing about it was? I had ZERO support from my Head of Year or any other teachers that were taking me to my exam and that grudge still burns deep to this day. I was faced with either getting sent home for my exam or facing the whole thing. I did the latter with my extra time and left for the summer holidays.

The biggest change was my relationship with my mother came when she admitted to me about the times she always took things out on me because of my dad. Whatever petty dispute, physical fight or dangerous argument they had, I was the one she shouted at without considering my feelings. She spent most of her life not knowing I was her daughter and rather a punching bag with every word she told me, and it made me feel worthless and unable to find love from any figures other than teachers at school or Dylan's family. After revealing this, my mother broke down, and soon enough, I did too. It made me realise how no matter what argument, she still loved me more than she wanted to admit, and it hurts me so much to see her in this state. 

So, as the summer holidays went by, we started to fix our fractured relationship by going out shopping more. She even helped me find my dress for my prom in July for me to go with Dylan. We worked things out and started being alright with each other on good terms. When I passed Maths after a year of retaking it, she was so proud of me. After years of feeling like I wasn't good enough for her, I finally got the recognition I needed.

Until my dad decided to crash the party in 2023. He returned to move back in after he became destitute last year. This was during my A-Levels in Year 13 and, for the most part, I was pretty pissed off at him for coming back and at Mum for allowing this to happen. I had gone through counselling and therapy to unpack the trauma inflicted for years be cause of them, only for Dad to be the haunting reminder of everything leading up to how I feel. I didn't talk to either him or my mum for weeks which got me feeling depressed and I began doubting my purpose in life. It was all too overwhelming and I thought I have had enough of the world to no longer be in it. It took more therapy to put my life back on track and start focusing on my future without feeling like I'm not good enough.

After finishing secondary school, things took a dark turn this year. Earlier, I mentioned Dylan, so I will give a little insight. I met Dylan in Year 9, but I don't have any memories of when we first met or talked because of COVID-19. We got together in Year 10, three days shy of my birthday, and I felt that he made school better for me because he was there. We supported each other, he cheered me up, I made him happy, and he was my first. We were together for 3 years, 9 months and 15 days.

At the end of June, Dylan announced he was having some struggles mentally and said he felt he ""wouldn't be a good boyfriend to me"" having these issues. At the time, he was finishing college and has gone to do an apprenticeship at Silverstone, where they have a the Formula One races. He wanted to be a chef like his dad, and I supported him with that since we both like to make food.

My heart shattered into pieces. The love of my life, my true love, was leaving me in pieces. I tried to suggest talking to people like BYHP (the ones who helped with my counselling and therapy) or his family to seek help, but in his eyes (he was driving us around), he looked like he wanted to cry. I couldn't imagine how hard it must have been for him when he had to sacrifice one thing in his life. And that one thing was me.

The next couple of weeks was hard for me. As I started visiting my secondary school (the library was my safe space to go to for clubs), I would immediately burst into tears at the thought that of all the people I had to lose in my life, it had to be Dylan. I started wondering how I was ever going to move on, so college became the root focus ever since September.

Before college, however, my dad had been acting strange. It wasn't until my mum and I found out the truth: my dad had drugs in his bag. 25 bags of cocaine, and one huge bag of weed. I realised how naive I had been for believing my dad never doing no wrong to break the law.

It paid off because my dad must have known that we knew. Around August this year, I came downstairs hours later and found his stuff gone, Mum told me the truth: he left again and won't be coming back.

I don't think my relationship with Dad will ever be the same again as it was for the last nearly 20 years of my life. I can't forgive him just yet, but I can't be sure if I can trust him again. When he tried to contact me, I offered a lengthy message about how I felt without being under my mother's influence and spoke from my heart. Since then, he's backed off to know that I'm no longer his little ""princess"" but a grown woman navigating life one step at a time.

As for Dylan, my now ex-boyfriend, I will love him always, even when we're apart, so my door is open when he feels ready.

College life has been pretty fair to me for the last month. I started getting along with my teachers and made new friends from my course and other courses in the area. I find Culinary Arts a driving force to helps my focus and learn new things along the way, as well as acquiring knowledge. I have a support system in place to see people if I have concerns, and I started a Creative Writing Club with an author who did a Creative Writing club at my secondary school. We catch up a lot about stuff, and it feels nostalgic.

Work life, not so great. My first job was at Nando's until October when they let me go after six shifts. I realised on my first night shift that I needed to remove myself from there if I stay too long. Coffee #1 was starting to be the one place where I focus and do potwash without feeling like I was left hanging when I was doing front of house at Nando's. Unfortunately, today, on my second shift, they let me go. I was heartbroken. It felt so much more personal than Nando's. I haven't told my mother, but she is currently pissed that I didn't spent her card on lunch at Coffee #1 instead of Greggs and One Below. I feel bad that I didn't tell her that Coffee #1 got rid of me. Part of me feels like kicking myself for not telling her sooner, but part of me felt like I was doing the right thing that I was keeping her from feeling stressed out. I was crying when writing this, and I don't want our Christmas this year to feel strained because of today.

Maybe that's why I've felt sad about 2024 being a shit year for me. I've ended the year with no boyfriend, no father, and no job. Just this hollowing and gut wrenching loneliness and isolated that will eat me out from the inside until I die. Tomorrow will be the second Christmas without my father, and the first without Dylan, breaking my heart even more knowing that things  will never be the same again. 

I don't know what the future holds for me in 2025. I wish God or the universe could tell me. I don't want to continue another trail of misfortune, heartbreak and bad luck again. 

Please, somebody, anybody out there listening or reading my story, give me a sign that things will be okay before I lose hope.",2,1735064960.0,helpme,1,1.0,False

First holiday season without the mother who gave me life and the parents who raised me. It's a strange sensation and experience. I feel the emptiness I've always felt not having my biological mom, that has always been a stone in my stomach. There is definitely a deeper void and sadness I'm feeling without any of them to Hug. I've been crying non stop for a week. Fluxing between wonderful family memories of Christmas Eve and Christmas Morning, and the devastation of helping mom (adoptive) during her end of life journey exactly a year ago. Her birthday is on the 29th. She would be 82. She made it exactly one week into her 81st year, and passed on Jan 7, 2024. Dad passed suddenly Feb 13, 2008. And for 16yrs I celebrated with mom, without dad. And now, I completely understand her bittersweet emotions and feelings every time the holidays rolled around. I miss them all so much. Thank you for listening. I'm sending so much appreciation, acknowledgement, and support to all during this challenging time. ",2,1735064622.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

i focus on that bubbling feeling of is this a breakdown or am i always this beat down and tired … 

uneventful isn’t even the word i could use for being indoors daily because its chaotic here ,always … 
But i feel extra defeated today 
Family has helped with every aspect of christmas this year , adding to the dread of holidays & feeling immature and purposeless worthless to my CORE

My kids 3 boys all under 6 are rambunctious, tiny tornados that rip through the house like a whirl wind .. 
but they smile and laugh while doing it 🖤
and i woke up to the house being trashed today .. i don’t mind cleaning after them it’s makes me feel productive at least

i feel terrible because i had to give their dad their room . Because he needed a place to invite his friends and smoke and play his video game & apparently sleep from now on … Him having his freedom to exist as if he doesn’t have 3 little ones looking up to him , his right to exist freely is something i loathe obviously as quietly as possible ..

but maybe if they had their own space this mess would be more contained at least .. maybe i’d even get my bed back and they would sleep in their own space and grow to love it 
so i’ll clean out my (room sized ) walk in closet set up their beds and tv and toys .. 

i will be home alone for 4- 6 hours tonight while they go to their dads family’s house for Christmas eve .. 

Anyway ~ Coffee was nice and i have a busy day and my brain hasn’t stopped talking since before i opened my eyes today . 🖤Have a better day everyone
