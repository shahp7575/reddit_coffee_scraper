She came across pretty angry and unhappy to be there (which, I mean, who wouldn’t) to me. At times she seemed to be nearly seething from my point of view.

I gather she thought Ezra was a teen drama queen and she seems to paint Jason as a doofus, which I can certainly get that. She gets drawn into this whole thing (or perhaps better to say she allowed herself to be drawn into it) and takes on a bit of a mediator role (telling Jason he’s insensitive in how he berates Ezra, for instance him saying her makeup made her look like a clown; and Ezra for breaking up by text).

I get it. She just wants to be with her BF, who lives with Jason, and every time she goes over to the apartment or the coffee shop there’s this whole De Grassi Junior High drama around everything (as seems to be the case wherever Ezra goes) and she’s fed up with it.

I take her testimony as ‘why the fuck do I have to be here, I am so over this whole thing, finish your questions so I can get the fuck out of here’ but wondering if someone got a different vibe — angry at Ezra for killing Alex, angry at Jason for bringing this person, indirectly, into her life, etc.",1,1740852683.0,ezramccandless,0,1.0,False

We met in the most ordinary way—at a coffee shop, reaching for the same cup. She laughed, and that laugh became the soundtrack of my life.

For five years, she was my home. We traveled, danced under city lights, whispered dreams under the stars. We promised forever, believing love could conquer anything.

But love isn’t always enough. Life got in the way—stress, distance, unspoken words. One day, she packed her bags. *""I love you,""* she said, *""but I don’t know if love is enough anymore.""*

She left. I let her go.

Months later, I saw her again—same coffee shop, same smile. But this time, someone else was holding her hand.

I sighed as Loxan managed to down another shot of pure vodka like it was water. The first few times it was fascinating to watch but she continued to have little reaction to it. She, the bartender, and I were growing increasingly frustrated at her constant demands for something stronger.



“How are you not the tiniest bit drunk? You must’ve had half of the gosh darn bottle by now!” I was astonished. I don't think there's a single human that could down that much vodka, that fast, and yet still have no reaction other than asking for something stronger!



“Venlil livers are very effective at breaking down alcohol, our ancestors had to eat a lot of fermented fruits because the most habitable zones of our planet are quite humid meaning that drying wasn’t an effective way of preservation”

I enjoyed the science lesson the doctor gave me, their people are just so interesting to learn about!



“Come on! You have to be hiding something from me! Give me the strongest thought you have you pred!” The captain berated, annoyed at remaining sober, this charade had been going on for so long that the bartender didn’t need me to translate what the captain asked for.



“Fine, wanna get plastered?” The bartender threatened before going to the back of the bar disappearing from view, returning with a tall mason jar of clear liquid.



*MOONSHINE!?! WHY IS THERE MOONSHINE AT AN AIRPORT BAR!?! Should I be horrified that the hand-drawn label is an X'd out eye?* 



I watched in silent confusion and slightly mortified as Loxan was poured a small glass of the stuff, the bartender looking triumphant, Yuatari looked at me and seemed to have picked up on my body language being more tense.



“What is that stuff, Sebastian?”



“Moonshine, dang near pure alcohol and ethanol, if she says she wants something stronger after that, she’s outta luck”



Yuatari didn’t seem that concerned about me stating the contents of the liquid as her boss downed the liquid with the same lack of care as all the previous alcohol but it seems that the strength caught her off guard as she started having a small coughing fit whilst setting the glass down.



The bartender let out a cocky chuckle “Finally met your match huh?”



The captain simply pushed her glass towards the jar stating “More!”



“Oh sweet savior, please don’t get drunk Loxan” I begged of her but she seemed to all but ignore me as the bartender obliged and filled the glass.



“Don’t worry, Vallus knows how to fly the ship if Loxan gets drunk” Sallus said to which his brother just rolled his eyes muttering how it wouldn’t be the first time he had to fly because Loxan got plastered before downing the rest of his gin.



Sallus was almost done with his cocktail, sipping to prolong the enjoyment of the foreign drink whereas the doctor was halfway through her third tall glass of beer, I found something a little comical of a doctor drinking so much beer. 



I let out a yawn as my depression nap from earlier was wearing off and my fatigue was returning in full force. I looked down at Yuatari who had a fearful but confused expression which the latter only grew as the yawn spread to the bartender which she got frustrated at. 



“Man, I still got six hours of my shift left, I don’t need you making me yawn like that!”



“Forgive me, it’s been a very long couple of weeks getting ready for all of this, having to hammer out all the work ahead of time,” I grumble, never having taken a chance to take an in-depth look at any information packets, never taking a break to read information packets, just work, work and more work. 



“What was that?” Yuatari questioned



“It’s a yawn, it happens when we get tired and it” *another one spawned in the middle of the sentence* “It’s a terribly contagious thing”



“A calm social expression that's contagious?” She said seemingly not having heard of just a thing



“Yep, we can’t fight it either, it’s terrible” I groaned, stretching trying to keep myself awake having to shepherd the space sheep back to the ship after all this.



“Mind if we stop for a coffee after all this?” I asked of the group to which the three sober ones flicked a single ear, I wasn’t sure what that meant and asked for clarification.



Sallus reassured them that they were okay with it. I wanted to go now not wanting to have to deal with towing around a drunkard in the airport, trying to signal that I got out of my seat and pulled out my wallet ready to pay off all the drinks.



The bartender saw this and cut off Loxan, twisting the jar lid on and putting it under the counter before accepting my card.



“Awwww, come onnn!!! You predators are terrible! Tease me by finally giving me something good only to take it away!” the captain whined and protested against this to which Vallus tried to get her off the barstool.



“Lox, we’re still on the predator planet” he stressed to her but she didn’t seem to care one bit.



“Yea, and they're bleqqing lame! Taking away the good stuff after hiding it from me!” The captain seemed to have lost control of her volume which was stressing me out, the last thing we all need is even more attention!



“Captain, please, watch your voice, people will start to stare” I warned, worried about the series of events that it could lead to, come to think of it, I should be looking over my shoulder more. Hopefully, any paparazzi and press are still a ways away but surely word would’ve spread by now about my out-of-this-world friends.



“Let ‘em! You guys are terrible predators! Here we are, in the middle of your horde and you’re not eating us!” *It seems that homebrew was just what the captain was looking for as it seemed to have her liver occupied as the booze seemed to be taking full effect now*.



“Your tiny forward-facing eyes are just lies!” she continued to boast, against Vallus’s best efforts she started approaching me as I was handed my card back.



I wasn't expecting contact and the impact of the captain walking into me which caused me to stumble a little. “See? You’re all just big pushovers! Heh, predator, pushovers, someone must’ve written the wrong thing!” 



I tried to help the captain onto her two own feet but she wasn’t cooperating that well

“Just eat me, come on, prove me wrong that you're all not just big beqling pushovers, you just look wrong!”



*Look wrong? Ouch!*



“Ugh, Vallus, Yuatari, can someone help me here?” I asked frustrated that neither of them intervened as the captain proceeded to go mostly limp in my grasp which only furthered my annoyance 



*Is this the person I trusted to fly me to another star system!?! Some fucking drunkard!?*



The two proceeded to, in fact, not help at all which infuriated me to some degree as no matter how many times I kept trying to get the captain to stand on her own she’d purposely let her legs fold under her and insisted on trying to egg me on trying to get me to show the predator that humans are.



Getting fed up with this I just fully picked her up, thankfully she was small enough I could put her over my shoulder even though this situation was quite unfortunate compared to what I was hoping for at least it was under control.



I just huffed as now I for sure had grey fur stands all over my shirt making me look messy. I offered my hand to Yuatari signaling that I was more than ready to go, after she put her hand in mine she offered her open one to Sallus who actually didn’t grab it, instead saying “A-Actually I wanna try to go normally”



I was good with whatever and just huffed as I started making for the exit, hearing Vallus say “You're still holding someone’s paw! Either mine or Yuatari’s”



Sallus reluctantly held his big brother’s hand as they followed the three of us, Yua looking around a little but mostly looking at the floor as we walked, the speep on my shoulder offered little resistance as she just swayed with my walk, occasionally making remarks about her view from so high up. 



It wasn’t until I could see the door we entered from did I remember that I wanted some coffee but I didn’t want to walk all the way back to the coffee shop we passed on our way here, luckily there was a small mart nearby that I pulled us into. 



I made a break for the energy drink cooler, I grabbed a tall can labeled “Zeus brew” thinking it should be enough to keep me awake, for how long I wasn’t too sure. I realized how bad of an idea this was until I saw some *beef fricking jerky* hanging on one of the shelves, I used my body to block their view of it as they milled about.



*My heart’s racing, my blood’s running a little cold, oh lord merciful god please don’t let them see any kind of meat snack! The amount of commotion that’d cause! They’d revert to right when I met them thinking that we’re monsters!* 



Thankfully I was able to rush them through the mart and towards the register where I paid for their things like a good host.



The Doctor getting herself some pretzels, and the brothers getting some ice teas, the captain remained on my shoulder, having to adjust her as we grabbed our purchased goods. I opened the can with one hand as I led the aliens out of the airport and back on the tarmac, it would appear the rain stopped for the most part.



“Guess that extra finger comes in handy huh?” The doctor commented



“Extra? I got five on each hand like most people” I replied unsure what she was talking about until she held up her paw and spread her fingers to see that she only had four.



“Ah, guess you can say that, helped our ancestors swing tree to tree, nowadays it makes holding onto drunkards and opening cans with one hand pretty easy”



“Tree swingers” Yuatari mumbled as she pulled out her phone and started to write that down.



“So how many trees does it take to hold up a den?” Sallus asked innocently but his question was quite hard for me to comprehend at first.



“We don’t live in trees anymore, not for the most part, we fell out of the vine swinging business millions of years ago back when we were closer to monkeys, now we’re quite the oddball when compared to the other great apes” I wonder if Vallus would think I’m lying when I show him the human family tree. 



“Great apes?” Vallus snickered, “What makes you all so great?”



“Greater intelligence mostly, all six of us share the ability to use tools, we lack tails, we're of greater size, greater sociability, and opposable thumbs”



“How can you tell what you monkeys are thinking without tails!?! I thought it was just you freaks!” Vallus’ fiery questioning was a little amusing



“Simple, facial expressions and body languages to which you all have only one to go off of” I lend over with something to really intimidate the spitfire speep “Your fear makes it so you have no idea what I'm really thinking and feeling\~”



It would seem I have put him in his place as he looked up at me then straight ahead in what I can assume is being mortified at the revelation that he’s only had my own word to go off of, not being able to check if I’ve been lying this entire time.



I couldn’t help but chuckle a little as we entered the alien spaceship.



“Where should I put her?” I asked the group



“We’ll take her,” Vallus said taking Sallus with him, the brothers each took one side of their captain as I gently handed her over, and they promptly whisked her away through that door separating this bay from the rest of the ship, the captain protesting the whole time about how she’s just fine to fly. That just left the doctor with me who was still tapping away, occasionally looking at my hands as she typed.



I decided to sit down, finally having a free hand to properly lift my mask so I could drink my coffee, the doctor idly minded taking a seat next to me.



It was a nice moment of peace for me and her. It seems I was truly blessed by the exchange member program to be bound to someone like her, being able to be so calm and brave as to sit next to me. 



Just as I was about to start some small talk with the doctor I heard the sounds of stressed hydraulic pistons and motors as the ramp started to slowly close, A short high-pitched hiss signaling that a seal had been secured.  



“Guess we’re about to take off…this is my first time off planet” I admitted as Sallus joined us in the bay.



“Really?” the spotted one said excited to witness my first time in the cosmos.



“Yeah, most people get the chance to orbit Earth at least once in a while, heck, visiting the moon for a family vacation is a core part of our middle class, some people have family on Mars or Venus they get to visit once in a decade but I never left the atmosphere”



“Then prepare to be amazed!” *It was so nice to have someone being so energetic and light to keep my spirits up*



“Heh, thanks Sallus…say do you think we can take the scenic route, you know, stop by every planet on our way out? I’ll pay for the extra fuel” I said wanting to see what our ancestors once thought were the embodiments of their gods in person.



“Sounds fun! I’ll go ask Vall” Sallus said before hustling through the door he came through.



I pulled out my phone having just remembered to text my family that I was leaving, holding out my phone far ahead of Yuatari and I, once she saw the phone, she perked up her ears before I took the picture to send to the family group chat.



“Who are you sending that to?” she politely asked.



“My family, I’m also telling them that we’re taking off” My leg started bouncing nervously as I wished that they were here with me, my mom here to comfort me and my dad to make me feel safe…*Leaving not only home and the family but the entire planet, heck the entire system all alone!* 



**…I’m not alone! I have Yuatari with me!** 



I took a deep breath to try and calm myself but my leg kept bouncing and my palms started to sweat which seemed to have drawn concern from my exchange partner unsure what any of this indicated no doubt!



“Everything alright Sebastian?” She asked



“Just nervous is all, it’s a lot to take in, unlike the last few times I tried leaving home I can’t exactly call them anytime I want…or easily visit them”



“Mmmm, being separated from your pack is a stressful thing huh, don’t worry Sebastian, I’ll be a part of your pack” *It felt a bit rude to use such animalistic wording towards me but the sentiment outweighed any offense I took*. 



“Thank you Yuatari”



She was about to say something but then Sallus brusted into the room again, flicking an ear before announcing “Alright, scenic route it is!”



My excitement was stifled a little when the engines on the ship started, a rumbling filled the ship as I looked outside the windows to see the two left engines spool up and we started to take off.



In a slight panic I gripped one of the hand holds as I felt the G-forces during ascension, Vallus was taking quite the aggressive flight plan as I felt pressed right into the seats, almost falling into the doctor who seemed unbothered, Sallus being able to remain upright despite the horizon showing just how much of a tilt the ship was taking!



I closed my eyes and tried focusing on my breathing until I felt the forces lessen and the rumble quieted to silence, when I opened my eyes again…we were in the last whispers of the atmosphere, the windows facing the sun automatically darkening as to not blind us whilst the ones facing space remained the same, letting me get an insanely clear view of all the stars beyond!  



I was in amazement, not feeling the ship move and position itself for whatever reason, only noticing because of the stars shifting, I was confused when the windows shuttered closed and the rumbling came back, I turned to look at Sallus and the doctor for some kind of explanation.



It took Sallus a moment to realize why I was looking at him and he gave me the answer “We’re making short jumps so it should only take a few moments to get to all eight planets”



“Nine” I corrected “The dwarf planet is still significant to us,” I said to which Sallus nodded and pulled out his own phone and tapped away, I assume to send a quick message with how fast he put it away. 



Before I knew it, the shutters lifted, and before my very eyes was the planet closest to Sol.



“Ah, Mercury, our, or I guess, *MY* ancestors named this planet after the god of swiftness as it orbits the sun so quickly, nowadays it’s relegated as the HQ of our dyson sphere project” I tried to point out some of the lights on the dark side of the planet as those where the solar drone manufacturing factories “Less than a hundred thousand humans inhabit this planet due to the radiation, the entire process is almost entirely automated!”



The doctor took a moment from her note-taking “You humans are confident in your control of AI and your machines”



“For the most part, their not perfect still and get stuck on some problems hence the people who work there to get the robots unstuck, other then that they’re rather reliable”



I heard incoming footsteps, turning my head, it was the striped Vallus entering to join us. “Alright Sebastian, I set the computer to make the jumps including that really small one that’s oh so important”



“Thank you Vallus,” I said politely as I just barely managed to take a picture out of the window of the planet below before the windows shuttered again.



When they opened it was humanities third home in the system “This is Venus, named after the goddess of beauty, and I think it should be obvious why with this almost holy glow” I said enamored, the clouds WAY too thick for me to even make out the shape of our floating cities within them “the third planet humanity colonized shortly after Mars, which we’ll see after earth”



“Now just how in all the stars’ names do you colonize something with that much pressure!?!” Vallus said looking at the yellow body as well



“Using the intense atmosphere to our advantage, see, it gets so dense that we’re able to make large structures that basically float without the need of thrusters, simply being less dense than the atmosphere below it”



“You apes are certainly something you know that?”



“I guess…” I said before turning back to the planet, admiring and taking a picture whilst I still could “Such beauty”



Soon after we returned to my home planet…it feels weird saying that.



“Earth, Gaia, terra firma, we have many names for our home…brings a tear to my eye…seeing everything we ever known, to think, over 95% of all humans are still down there, all of our history, up to a few months ago, all we knew about life…except Europa but that doesn’t count”



I really admired the view below, seeing our moon in the background “Gosh, I hope your guys moon is like ours”



“We don't have a moon,” Sallus said so matter of factly.



I whipped my head around so fast in shock that my mask slid around a little “NO MOON!?!”



Sallus jumped but Vallus didn’t flinch “Nope, never had one”



I was just about to ask more about their homeworld but the need for a picture compelled me to forget about that and focus on getting a good picture before the windows shuttered to which they shortly did afterward.



“Humanities first interplanetary home, Mars, named after the god of war as it shares the same color of blood”



The atmosphere in the ship shifted a little and I turned to see Sallus and the doctor in a bit of shock.



“Heh, didn’t mean for that to slip out huh?” Vallus said smugly, but I simply shook my head



“No, I meant to say it, I speak the truth Vallus, nice try though,” I said before taking a picture of the rusty planet below

“It’s the HQ of our system defense force made for intersystem threats, mainly rogue planets but half of the force was dedicated to the potential of alien threats…makes me glad you guys are friendly though!”



The atmosphere shifted again but this time the reasoning wasn’t obvious to me and I got the sense that I didn’t want to know right now, I turned back to the planet and went to take another picture of the planet, trying to zoom in on one of the itty bitty moons, managing to catch a warship in the picture!



Unfortunately, the camera was too poor to make out the name of the ship, just able to make out that it started with a ‘B’ though.



The next planet was the largest in the system.



“Jupiter, the king of the gods has an insane amount of moons, one of them is Europa I mentioned earlier, the only other place in the system with life…even if it mostly blind fish, quite ugly fish too, a little disappointing when compared to our idea of what kind of aliens we were hoping to find”



“What were you hoping to find?” the brothers questioned at the same time but in different tones.



“Not sure to be honest, considering Europe's situation the options were limited but seeing life on another planet meant that there *just had to be* life elsewhere! And well, here you all are!” I said happy that the first aliens we meet aren’t trying to kill us all



“Anyway, it used to have a red spot right about *there* but it went away about forty years ago, still not fully sure why and when or if it’ll be back.



“You monkeys got any floating cities in there too?” Vallus questioned



“Nope, but there’s a sizable colonization effort on Europa below the ice”



“Why can’t you humans just live somewhere normal?”



“Where's the fun in that Vallus? Where's the challenge, where's the interest? Do you Venlil only inhabit worlds like your home planet?” I asked whilst taking a picture of the grand gas giant



“Ain’t many tidally locked worlds that are just like ‘prime but they’re dang near close” 



*They came from a tidally locked planet? SO MANY QUESTIONS!!* 



“So much real estate wasted” I simply joked.



*Next planet!*



“Saturn, god of the harvest as it shares the same color as our mostly used staple crop: Wheat”



“Staple crop?!?” the three of them said shocked.



“Yea? Staple crop? As in the crop that you use for a majority of your food? Wheat gets turned into flour which then gets turned into mostly bread and “bread is what builds empires” As my social studies teacher told me”  This only seemed to shock the aliens more. 



So much so that I almost forgot to take a picture of the magnificent ringed world.



“Uranus, or Ouranos, god of the sky seeing as they share the same color, and you didn’t input anything wrong Vallus, the planet does indeed orbit on its side…compared to everything else in the solar system""



However, I did not forget about my obsession with pictures, after another one for the memories the windows closed and we were at the last gas giant.



“Neptune, god the of ocean and seas, for obvious reasons” I didn’t have much to say about Neptune, not much happens past Saturn, there’s rumors about our next planet though, it takes a hot second before we arrive at it.



“Pluto, god of the underworld, there are rumors that this is where all the shadow governments meet and coordinate and do sick inhuman experiments far away from everyone else” The others flicked an ear in response, and there was a moment when the ship went silent and Vallus went off into the rest of the ship of the ship.



Sallus just simply went with him stating “I’m getting hungry”



Even the doctor got up but as she did the windows shuttered to a close as we were jumping to their home system!



“I should go check on Loxan, do you need anything, Sebastian?” She kindly asked



*Here I go yawning again! Dang!*



“Nope, I can feel the coffee wearing off though so I think I’ll try and take a nap whilst we travel, thank you though”



“No problem, enjoy your nap,” She said before also disappearing deeper into the ship.



That left me all alone, the only thing to listen to was the quiet hum of the ship’s systems working. I laid down on the seats the best I could, taking my mask off, then my glasses, resting the mask on my face so I could try and sleep with these bright lights on!



*Man, I hope I can get some real sleep when we reach this “Prime”.*

There was indeed a delivery, on the parcel it says “1 of 2 (11kgs)” clearly, it was only the coffee beans. He did ask if that was all there is to deliver, and the delivery guy said “Oh yeah…” as he was taking a photo of the box that was delivered. Then he went back to the delivery van, but instead of getting the remaining parcel (assuming it was the coffee machine), he drove off. 

We drove around the village in hopes of chasing the delivery van. We attempted to call and message the courier company, went through their website—all says the same, that the package has been delivered. 

Whatever quota they are trying to meet, whatever they’re going through their day when they do their job, whatever they’re were thinking when they’re on the job, we completely can be sympathetic about. But the attitude and their work ethics has completely threw us off.

1j15fgp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moissanite/comments/1j15fgp/re_sabrinastarsgem_unhappy_customer_no_one_was/,RE: Sabrina/Starsgem unhappy customer - No one was scammed.,"A few days ago a customer posted about her order with Sabrina at Starsgem, claiming she was ""scammed"" when she was unhappy with how her ring turned out and didn't receive a full refund immediately.

I have since seen screenshots of her entire conversation with Sabrina, and spoken to Starsgem management about what happened. It was, as it turns out, a series of misunderstandings and incorrect expectations.

The facts are that in the process of the ring being made, the customer was advised multiple times that the ring would probably not be the same quality as the inspo ring, due to the way Starsgem production works. (Reminder - we are sometimes duping rings that are tens of thousands of dollars for \~500. Expectations need to be tempered as to what's possible sometimes.)

Then when the customer was unhappy at the PSP/PSV stage, she was offered choices, including a refund (minus $100 for labor and CAD fee - **which is NORMAL and EXPECTED - If any customer gets as far as PSP/PSV's on a custom piece and then wants to back out, they should fully expect to pay a fee for the work incurred**)

Sabrina initiated the refund at this time. It did not go through immediately as the reps managers receive the refund request and then it gets processed. Chinese New Year started this day. The refund would not have been able to be processed until afterwards as they were no longer at work. The customer was advised that this was their last day of work, again multiple times.

Customer then initiated a Paypal case/chargeback. The money is now held up by this process but she will receive the money. The ring was not shipped. There is no evidence that Starsgem ever said that they shipped the ring. And yes, they have listed it for sale. Again this is normal. They can list anything they make for sale. (One of my personal rings that Kuololit made for me, is now listed on their site and the listing photos are my exact ring - that's their right. They made it. They can offer to make it again)

  
I am writing all this out because I want the subreddit in general to remember, when we hear a side of a story it is often not the entire story. No screenshots or proof were shown in the customers posts, and many people immediately just believed that version of the story. This is dangerous for reps, as they depend on their reputation.   
Why would Starsgem/Sabrina scam a customer for $500 when their entire company's reputation is at risk.   
The most likely answer is, they wouldn't, and there's been some misunderstandings. Which ended up being the case here. We need to remember not to be quick to judge. I also do not judge the customer for her confusion. This process is complicated, and comes with many unknowns. It is not necessarily for everyone, and it is certainly not something one should try without doing extensive research first. 

Also, we mods are not here to blindly defend the vendors interests or cover for them IF they are lying/cheating customers. We are also not here to blindly let customers defame well known and generally trusted vendors/reps when something goes wrong.  I have spent several hours of my personal time over the last few days, figuring out what REALLY happened here, talking with the customer to help her feel better, and assuring Starsgem that we do not allow people to scream ""scam"" without evidence.  
  
I hope this post helps clear everything up and we can get back to enjoying the sparkles and joy of moissanite together.   
  
Thank you,

1j15f8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1j15f8h/i_accidentally_angered_a_cryptid_in_the_mountains/,"I accidentally angered a cryptid in the mountains, what do I do?","For a few years now my buddy Anthony and I have jointly owned a cabin out in the Rocky Mountains. Every once in a while we’ll go up there and spend the weekend. We always end up doing the same few activities. After setting up we start a fire in the charcoal stove and make lunch. Then we hike down to the closest lake and go fishing. We’ve only ever caught one fish, Anthony claims he got it, but I definitely did. Before sunset, we hike back and retreat to our bedrooms. I usually read a Stephen King for a few hours until it pulls me to sleep. In the morning we make breakfast and pack up, leaving around noon.



Last month we decided to head up for the new year. Neither Anthony nor I had anything better to do. I woke up early that morning and put on heavy layers. Then, I grabbed a few granola bars for breakfast and prepared my bag. As I walked down my front steps, Anthony’s red pickup truck cut through the snow to park. His flatbed was filled with unevenly cut pieces of coffee brown wood with burgundy fillings. Next to the wood was a medium cardboard box. I put my backpack in the bed and hopped onto the leather of the passenger seat. He had the radio on playing our local rock station. Anthony took a sip of his thermos,



“You like the tunes?”



I let out a small chuckle. The music was something by Imagine Dragons that had come out a few years ago. We had always hated the overproduced music they made and joked about it whenever we heard it.



“What a song, this deserves all the Grammies.” I joked.



“No no, a few Nobel prizes are more appropriate.”



As we kept driving, the city around us started to thin as we approached the freeway. The fast food restaurants were replaced with pine trees and the skyscrapers turned to mountains. We had about 2 more hours of driving until we got up to the cabin. As we turned around a bend in the road, the radio station was drowned with static.



“Damn it. Could you find something else?” Anthony muttered.



I turned the knob for a few minutes getting nothing but static. Finally, after a minute or two, I found something local. The station played easy-listening music, something that you would hear in an elevator. Eventually, the music was cut off by the crooning voice of a host. He sounded like he was around 20 and had a slight drawl,



“Welcome to KWYU Mountain Mysteries. Today is our Bugfoot mystery hour, if you have any evidence of the Bugfoot call in at xxx-543-6846.” After he was finished the easy listening faded back in.



Anthony spoke jokingly, “The fuck is a Bugfoot?”



“A bunch of these areas have their own cryptid, it’s all just for tourism.”



After a few more minutes the smooth voice of the host returned,



“We have Randy from Bailey on the line, Randy what do you have for us today?”



An older man with a gravelly, northern accent spoke,



“Hello, I’ve lived in this area for a good long while now and have seen plenty of evidence for the Bugfoot, but the other night I saw him right in front of me.”



“Randy that sure is something, please, tell us what happened?”



“Oh it was horrible, I was out on my nightly smoke, the wife doesn’t want me smoking by the house, and I was walking along the river. It must have been the dry season because I could not find that damn river. The woods have a way of tricking you, it all looked the same and I got lost. Once I realized I didn’t know those woods, I put out my smoke and looked for light. In the distance, I saw what looked like headlights sitting stationary. I assumed it must have been a car on the highway and thought I could hitchhike back to Bailey. 



Once I got about 100 feet away from the lights I noticed they were moving around oddly. I thought it must have been some kids screwing around with their car. Instead of hitchhiking, I thought I would just walk along the highway instead. As I got about 50 feet away I saw that the lights were too high off the ground to be headlights. I called out in their direction and the lights sped up the road faster than any car could.”



“And what do you think those lights were Randy?”



“They were the eyes of the Bugfoot of course. He has giant bright eyes that can blind you if you get too close. Everybody knows that.”



“Thank you, Randy.”



Randy hung up.



“Well folks, what do you think? Was that the Bugfoot, or just some kids screwing around?” he chuckled.



A different easy listening came on, it was older and sounded like something you would hear on the weather channel.



“Bugfoot, that's some bullshit.” Anthony snickered,



“Oh definitely, it's not even creative, Bigfoot but he’s a bug. Every weird part of the country wants their own Bigfoot, or Loch Ness Monster, or Mothman.”



“Are they even trying though, they could have at least made the name something better than just a play on Bigfoot”



The easy listening was cut,



“Welcome back, we have Linda from Buffalo Creek on the line, Linda what do you got?”



A 40ish-year-old woman with a shrill voice came on the line,



“The Bugfoot was trying to get into my house the other day.”



“That sure sounds scary Linda, whats your story.”



Anthony joked quietly, “It sure sounds true.”



The woman started,



“I was coming back home from emptying our latrine in the lake when I saw something outside my house.”



I shuddered and hoped that Linda’s lake was nowhere near ours.



“The sun had almost set by then so I couldn’t get a good look at it. From what I could see it was big and had brown smooth skin. Its face looked like a cricket’s but it was shaped like a man. Its head had two large black eyes and two long growths on the top. The arms didn’t end in hands, instead, it had two long hooked fingers. Its legs went backward then bent forwards at the knee and ended in one long foot.”



“Were its eyes bright like Randy said.”



“No, it’s eyes were a lifeless black.”



“Sorry to interrupt, continue.”



“It walked all around my house feeling the walls with its sickly long fingers. After a few minutes, it lost interest and retreated into the woods.”



“What do you think it was doing Linda?”



“It must have been trying to get in. It looked through the windows and tried to,,,”



“What did it do Linda?”



The host sounded slightly more serious. I can’t imagine he was actually sorry for her, more so, I think he wanted to pry her for more content.



“It tried to kick down the door. Even from as far away as I was, I could hear it pounding on that door. Thankfully it didn’t break.”



The host returned to a normal tone,



“Thank you, Linda, that's all we need.”



She hung up. The easy listening returned.



“Probably just some weirdo, definitely not Bugfoot” Anthony remarked.



We had gotten way deeper into the forest by then. When you’re driving through a wooded road there will usually be breakaways to people's private property. We always liked to point out the “Don’t trespass for your own good!” and “Stay off my property!” signs. At this depth, they were all gone and the road seemed to infinitely wind through the pine trees. That nut Randy was correct about one thing, the woods have a way of tricking you. The Rocky Mountain forests consisted of nothing but boulders, moss, and various pine trees. When that's all you see for hours your mind starts to get bored. If I lived there for years my mind would probably come up with a Bugfoot too. My thought was cut off by the return of the host.



 “Now we have…”



The host hesitated. After a few seconds, I could hear him stand up and walk away from the microphone, but I could still faintly hear him. He spoke much more casually,



“Hey, Beth, is the caller ID working? I can’t see this guy's name or where he is.”



He got a response that I couldn’t hear,



“Oh, um, I guess we’ll take the call then.”



He sat back down. The mixture of the winding woods and the uneasy speaking of the host brought out a deep unpleasant feeling within me.



“Hello caller what’s your story?”



The sounds that came out of the radio made me feel disgusting. The call had horrible quality, and the man's voice sounded pained like every word was a shard of glass. And the crickets. The second they took the call, the sound of thousands of crickets filled my ears. But that should have been impossible, it was January, the crickets in this area should have been hibernating.



“The Bugfoot is out there.”



The host dropped his radio voice and now spoke slowly and uncomfortably, 



“Our audience knows that sir.”



“No! No! No! The real Bugfoot.”



“What?”



“The real Bugfoot doesn’t tap on windows or have headlight eyes, It’s a killer. I have lived in these woods for years and ain’t done anything to make it mad, until now. I’ve seen plenty of hikers get stalked by the Bugfoot. Only seen a few actually get killed. They always did something bad for the woods, lit too big a campfire, caught too many fish, whatever. I’d find them a few days later as a feast for the woods, beaten to death.”



“What the fuck are you talking about?”



“I’m talking about the truth. I’ve lasted longer than most, it’s been stalking me for about a week now. Don’t know what I did but the Bugfoot is after me.”



The crickets got louder. The sounds of their chirps mixed with the quality of the call was nauseating. The host spoke softly,



“Why do you think it’s stalking you?”



I heard a faint crash in the background of the call,



“Fuck. I-I know it’s been stalking me. When I forage I can hear it out there chirping in a low tone. When I sleep I can hear it walking on my roof. It’s been hunting me”



“What are you gonna do?”



“I’m trying to…”



Anthony turned off the radio. 



“Fuck man, I was interested in that.”



“That stuff hurt my ears so bad, I felt like driving off the road. Why do you wanna hear that crazy dude anyway? Are you scared the Bugman’s gonna get you” he teased,



“It was interesting, of course I don’t think the Bugfoot is real.

	

Finally, we pulled into the clearing where our cabin rested. Its old, barely shingled roof sagged tiredly, while the old logs looked like they would support them forever. It had snowed recently, the ground was covered in patches of starch-white snow. Intermittently throughout the snow were patches of soft, brown mud. We acted like the place was a minefield, avoiding stepping in or dropping anything in the mud like it would blow our legs off.  As I was grabbing my stuff, I noticed the cardboard box again.



“What's in the box?”



“A little New Year surprise. At sundown, I’ll bring it out.”



The inside of the cabin was just as cozy as it always was. Once the fire was set in the stove, the warmth filled each room slowly. There was a redundant painting over my bed that showed a temperate forest similar to the one we had just driven through. I put my bags under my bed before I heard Anthony in the other room,



“What’d you bring for lunch.”



“A bunch of stuff for a Dutch lunch.”



“The fuck is a Dutch lunch?”



“Sandwiches stupid.” I joked.



I pulled out a bag of cold cuts, cheeses, sauces, and vegetables along with a loaf of bread.



“I went to a breakfast place in Pueblo a little bit ago that served this.”



We ate for about an hour, reading our respective books. After eating we went down to the lake to fish. The entire time I couldn’t stop myself from imagining the mystical Bugfoot just behind the treeline. I was so deep in the daydream that I didn’t even notice when I got a bite. I unfortunately lost it.



As we got back to shore Anthony had to put together his tackle box just right. While I waited for him to finish I noticed something in the gravel. There were long, deep impressions going down the lakeside. They were thin and ended in a sharp point. Interestingly, the back end of each depression was deeper than the front, as if someone shoved a board into the ground and let it fall. Within each imprint were what I thought were clear brown nuts or seeds. Only now, after doing research, do I realize what they were. Cricket shells.



It was almost nightfall when we got back, so Anthony revealed his New Year surprise. It was a few Roman candles and one of those massive sparklers with a name in Chinese.



“I didn’t want to do nothing for New Years, so I brought up these.”

 

“Haven’t you heard all those stories about people starting forest fires from stuff like this?”



Anthony knelt down and pushed on the soil.



“You couldn’t burn down shit in these conditions.”



“I guess you’re right.”



We made dinner of hot dogs and smores then set up to light the fireworks. It was beautiful. We only lit two of the Roman candles because we realized how boring they were, but the sparkler. The sparkler went on for five minutes, it had all sorts of colors and arrangements that amazed me. Although, when the spectacle ended, all I could think about was what that man said on the radio.



“...lit too big a campfire, caught too many fish, whatever…”



Anthony must have been distracted too, because while watching he accidentally bumped into the bed of his truck and all of our firewood rolled into the mud.



“God damn it.” he exclaimed. It seemed like all his excitement was let out at the same time he spoke.



“It’s okay dude, I can drive into town and buy some more.”



“No, No, I’ll go, don’t you remember how bad the roads were coming up? And besides, I don’t want you getting anywhere near the driver's seat of my truck.” The fun seems to have lept back into him.



I stood there until I couldn’t see his brake lights among the pines marching along the Rocky Mountains. Only when everything was still did I notice the ambient sound around me. Chirps.



The fire was on its last leg, what was once a bright summer yellow had become a deep crimson. I decided to read my book by the fire til it died, then I would see if any of the logs were salvageable and throw them in. Unfortunately, I could barely focus on the story, I think it was something about vampires, but my eyes kept drifting up to the window in front of me. The moon was shrouded by clouds and the window was usually completely dark, the silhouette of the trees being the only sight that broke through. Every once in a while the clouds would give way and the light of the moon would faintly light the treeline and path towards the cabin.



Just like at the lake, I couldn’t stop imagining Bugfoot behind the trees, but this time it was real. Every time the light revealed itself, if only for a moment, I thought I could see the outline of a dark figure. It disappeared so fast I’m unable to describe it, but it was there. At some point, I looked back down at the page and realized I couldn’t read. The fire died. I looked into the window. Darkness. The treeline was just barely visible, and the pile of wood was just out of sight.



I slowly reached for the doorknob, it was rusty and felt impossibly cold. At the sound of the first wooden creak, the cold winter air hit me like a thousand metal pins.  I only stepped close enough to examine the wood, but as soon as I left the safety of the doorframe, I felt an acute feeling of being watched. It felt like the whole forest was staring at me, hungrily. From my distance, some of the wood looked mostly clean; the wood at the top of the pile had barely touched the mud.



I took another step then stopped. Now that I was wholly out of the cabin, my senses could fully take in the black void around me. The chirping. It was gone. While I was reading, the crickets chirped non-stop, but now they were gone. I should have felt relief, but I couldn’t. It didn’t feel like they stopped because they left, it felt like when a predator goes completely still before pouncing. I walked as quickly and quietly as I could and grabbed the closest logs. When I had grabbed enough I looked up. My eyes had adjusted, I could distinctly see the clearing around me. Pressed deep into the mud in front of me were those long, thin tracks.



I ran back into the cabin, slamming the door with a force that felt like it would break the frame of its hinges. As soon as the door was closed the crickets started up again. Chirp. Chirp. Chirp. It sounded like there were thousands all around the cabin, taunting me. I covered my ears, but couldn’t keep out the nauseating cries. I threw the logs on the fire, trying to create something to drown out the cacophony around me. But it didn’t work. I fell to the floor keeping my ears as close to the fire as possible without burning my hair off. Trying to use the crackles and pops to drown out the shrill singing around me. Then it stopped.



Only for a moment, I was gifted silence. Suddenly, a staccato pounding hit the roof. Something started walking atop the shingles. It sounded as if someone was walking very exaggeratedly. I could hear each distinct thud of the heel and toe. The toe hit was muffled, like there was less force put into it. I hastily, but silently, made my way to my bedroom and dropped to the floor. As I lowered myself, my knee gave out and hit the wood board below me with a forte thud. The stepping stopped. It heard me.



I dropped completely flat and slowly wriggled under the bed. I used my bags to create a barrier between me and the wall, blocking any sightline to me. The stepping didn’t return for the longest minute of my life. Abruptly, whatever was on the roof started pounding on the shingles. In between thumps, I could hear a few ceramic tiles fall into the snow. I couldn’t get a clear sightline of the roof, but I could tell it was giving way. Eventually, they gave way with a sickening creak. The logs that broke tumbled to the floor and rolled before settling. The fire was quickly snuffed out by the snow atop the roof quickly plunging to the floor. Silence. Silence returned to me, like an old friend.



The beast dropped down to the floor with an impossible lightness, its feet almost fluttering onto the wood. Its horrible feet. They were the color of autumn leaves and ended in downward hooked yellow points. They were long and impossibly smooth. It was segmented with sharp, yellowed spikes. It's all I could see of it. When it took its first step, I understood how it layed those tracks. All the force went down on the ball of the foot and the hooked “toe” fell to the ground with it. It walked frantically around looking for me. It made almost no sound beyond its steps and I couldn’t tell what it was doing. It knocked over everything it walked by as if it didn’t notice them. First a lamp, then a picture frame. It had no direction and didn’t spend any amount of time in any one place



Eventually, It made its way to where I was hiding. The monster’s smooth feet were now close enough to reach out and touch. I hoped to god it couldn’t smell me. It stepped even closer to the bed, then halted. Engine sounds. Anthony was driving back. I watched as the beast’s feet stopped, turned around,  then floated back through the hole with a sickening, reverberating buzzing sound. I stayed still for one more minute then jumped out from under the bed. I grabbed my bags and ran through the door, I went so fast I didn’t even notice when it began to snow. The cold, fluttering flakes mixed with the fresh tears and sweat on my face. 



I yanked on the car door throwing myself into the passenger seat.



“Turn around turn around.”



“Wha…” 



Anthony started to speak but then looked inside the cabin which now lay bare in the snow. He turned the truck around and sped back up the trail. We kept the radio off the entire drive. I still don’t have the willpower to tell Anthony what happened, but now I think I need to. I was planning on keeping this story to myself for the rest of my life, but now I can’t. I need help, last night it snowed and when I looked out my window the next morning I saw those same long, sharp tracks in my yard.

I took everything in concideration. In the end I decided the ZFC was my first and my final choice so I went ahead and purchased it pre-owned from an photography enthousiast. 

  
He sold me the ZFC including: 

* Smallrig Grip
* 2nd Nikon battery
* 128gb SD card
* Viltrox Lens AF 33mm f/1.4
* Viltrox Lens AF 56mm f/1.7
* Two Hoya UV protecting glass plates for on the lenses. 
* Camera was under 5.000 clicks, has a screen protector and the man offered me good Italian coffee with an hour long explenation about the camera. Greatest experience!

  
Today my girlfriend gifted me a sage peak design leash and I am very content with the camera so far! 

  
However, I am looking to expand to at least one smaller/lighter lens. What I am currently concidering: 

* Nikkor Z DX 24mm f/1.7 
* Nikkor Z DX 16-50mm silver edition (pre-owned for €130 @ MPB)
* 24mm Viltrox variant (for the autofocus) - but this would be heavier....

  
I would like to know what the challenge would be for me shooting without autofocus as a starting photographer. 

  
Furthermore, I am concidering these accessories: 

* Peak Design Cuff
* Metal Thumb Grip (goes in the top part where a flash could be put on)
* Leofoto MT-03 + LH-25 Spider + Spider Mini

  
I have to do some research for some good wipes to get the lenses clean (had a hair between the lens and the mount the other day) + might need some bag/storage before we go on vacation in two months.

I'll add some more details here, just to keep my brain organized. (It hasn't had enough coffee yet...)

I have a **heavy** phone, Galaxy S23 ultra, with a Otterbox Defender cover. But I'd prefer a **magnetic mount**, as the ones that clasp the phone seem to fall off more easily.

The phone tends to run hot, even before the **100+ degree** temp summer hits. (It already gets hot, now in February!) I don't to **block the vent**, as I would rather benefit from the heat or a/c myself - plus I worry that the vented air temp will be too extreme for the phone. 

Aside from the entertainment display, it seems like every part of the dashboard is either **too textured or too curved** to have suction cups or even strong adhesives work. A suction mount on the windshield, even one with a long arm, still keeps the phone in the high temp zone.

I've tried the suction mount on different places on the **entertainment display**, but it impedes my view more than I'd prefer. And using the cup holder is not an option.

Any suggestions? All of the ones I've tried have either **not adhered** well enough to the surface, or the phone gets **too hot**, or the mount can't support the **weight** of the phone.

Having itemized that list of concerns, I feel pretty whiny! Sorry about that.

1j15b99,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1j15b99/to_anyone_scared_to_put_yourselves_back_out_there/,To anyone scared to put yourselves back out there… Here is my brief experience.,"TL;DR at the bottom of the post. 

My wife dropped a divorce on me out of the blue last year. Soon after, I lived alone in a house I bought for us, while she moved out with our dog and immediately replaced me. We only keep in contact until our business ties are all finished with. 

The next few months were terrible, but about4 months out I tried an experiment and put myself back out there on the apps. Mostly looking for some sort of physical connection I was missing, but maybe there was a 1% chance I’d actually click with someone. 

Had a few connections and convos with women that basically went nowhere, even felt kind of sick to my stomach at many points to be going through all of this again. But then she came along. 

I matched with someone who came from similar circumstances(divorced, my age range, etc), and we engaged in very long conversations that were actually meaningful. We saved all the big convos for in person, which was big for me, it meant she was actually interested in taking this somewhere. We eventually set a dinner date. 

Well before that dinner date happened, my anxiety popped up. Do I really want to do this? Is it too soon? What if it goes horribly? So much went through my head. And I bailed on the date. I told her about it ahead of time and she understood everything, but wondered if I would be okay with still talking and seeing where it goes anyways, since we had a great connection. 

I definitely agreed, as much as it made me feel like crap for bailing. That night she had some friends over and at the end of the night we were chatting about how everything went that evening, how she met with friends in lieu of the date she was supposed to be on and I think it flipped a switch in my head. A switch that said “you’re really being an idiot for bailing on her” and I made a decision. 

It was really late, so I threw out the idea of just picking her up for a midnight movie. Not ideal for a first date night, but I wanted to redeem myself and at the very least meet her in person. 

Movies ended up being too late for so she suggested just coming to her place, no pressure. I did, and had the best conversations with this woman about some of the most important events in my life and hers as well, some of them actually got so incredibly emotional that hand-holding turned into full embracing to help one another get through the convo. We had a movie on the tv and literally talked through the entire thing, don’t think we looked at the screen once. 

I was at her place for 5 hours… the second movie was a mixture of us fighting to stay awake and occasionally paying attention to the movie. Before I left, we set an actual coffee date for a few days later and have been together ever since. 

The connection I’ve made with this woman in such a short time took literal years to make with my ex wife. And for the first time in a very long time I have a positive outlook for my future. 

TL;DR I put myself out there on the apps, struggled for a bit, but eventually met someone amazing and it’s changed my outlook in so many positive ways. If you are afraid of being alone or think you’ll never find another person, put yourself back out there. You can’t catch fish if you don’t cast your line out there.

I am new to the Skoda brand and my current car is an MG 3 Hybrid Plus. The demo dealer model was an edition 85 in black magic metallic sitting on 19 inch Hankook *tyres. However the steering wheel was a 3 spoke affair with paddles which i am quite sure are supposed to be a Sportline  exclusive? So if it means edition 85 orders now get a 3 spoke wheel with paddles then brilliant but a far more likely explanation is that  this is a special launch edition 85  for dealers with various upgrades and packs to show the Elroq off.* 

 *Sitting inside the first thing that struck me was the space, lots of it and then the comfort.. seats feel very nice indeed.. this was the lodge interior with red seat belts. As it was only a short test drive a few things i did not have time for or forgot among others include sitting in the back seats, boot inspection, testing the Canton sound system, trying out the reverse 360 camera /park assist features although had a little play with the rear camera views while parked up but weather was poor  and obviously at 10am i would not be testing the matrix headlights. Visibility is great  and the oversized door mirrors are a welcome change to the norm and thanks to the electric drivers seat i was able to find a comfortable driving position very quickly. Today was all about the driving experience as there are already loads of videos about the Elroq boot size etc. I quickly inserted my phone into the fan cooled wireless charging pad.. a small symbol on the extreme left of the infotainment screen confirms my phone is charging.*

 *The Elroq is super smooth to drive ..a real joy.. for the most part the test drive was in B regen mode. I did not experience any issue some have reported with ""grabby"" brakes. I found the brakes excellent and very responsive. I guess  when my own edition 85 lands end of March i plan to drive mostly in B mode to help efficiency but the  drive today was too short to* decipher *any real world range expectations. The tiny 5 inch driver display was not as tiny as i had imagined and all the important driver info is there easily visible but it is the bigger brother infotainment screen at 13 inches ..well what a contrast. Super sharp display, fast scrolling and lag free.. this 13 inch* Behemoth deserves and needs a separate review as it's the command centre with plenty of options and then some more to personalise your driving experience and a handy shortcut to disable any ""assist"" features you may find  too intrusive but a few physical buttons below still exist including among others for climate control and park assist. The large infotainment screen i found to be in an excellent position despite not being angled towards the driver and it did not block any visibility from the windscreen. *The heads up display is a treat  and a game changer if you have never experienced one before. It is quite large and i understand can be made even bigger or smaller depending on your taste.*  

*The Skoda dealership* John Mulholland Motors is situated next to the M22 motorway so  was able to test the Elroq for a few miles there ...having 286hp gives you plenty of confidence for overtaking or joining  the motorway from a slip road. Once on the motorway flicking the adaptive cruise control on /off was a breeze. The Elroq took it all in its stride. The cabin had minimal road noise.. even on the motorway.. you will not be disappointed in this regard. Acoustic side windows in the front having a large part in this. Steering was not too light which i am pleased about ..the balance seems just right to me although worth noting i only had the driving mode in the default comfort mode. Would have liked to have tested the suspension  on a few country roads i  frequent on a daily basis but from the very limited time  i had with the Elroq the suspension seems well balanced again and ride comfort as a result is truly excellent. As mentioned i  had the Elroq in the default driving mode for the test drive which i believe is comfort.. someone i am sure will correct me if that is not the case.  

So a very happy test drive even though the sun was hiding. Overall i am delighted with the test drive and the Skoda Elroq and have verified photographic evidence that  a McDonalds coffee cup fits in the cupholder! Icing on the cake comes to mind. Please bear in mind some of the spec / features mentioned like the Heads up display  / Matrix headlights will depend on optional extra packs selected at purchase. Any downsides? Well i would have loved the demo car to be in moon white and base loft trim  as per my order ..but i can wait another few weeks. I can honestly say i encountered no downsides at all to my test drive so this is a very easy 10/10 score.

 If you are in Northern Ireland please consider John Mulholland Motors Randalstown for your next car ...centrally located.. easy to find  and with friendly helpful staff. I have not been paid by anyone to write this mini review or asked to...but i appreciate great cars and great service and i am very happy to recommend this dealer.  Feargal",2,1740851431.0,SkodaElroq,0,1.0,False

How to brew coffee with lots of body?","So after my drip coffee machine broke I a few years ago I just started putting ground coffee in my cup and pouring boiling water on it and waiting maybe 10 min until it was cool enough to drink and the grounds settled. I know It sounds disgusting but I didn't mind the coffee particles much and I actually came to like it much more than shitty drip machine coffee. I also kind of liked the fact that I loved even shitty grocery store coffee brewed this way and didn't need to overcomplicate things.

Fast forward two years and I'm in Antigua, Guatemala and for the first time really started getting what people are on about with the whole specialty coffee thing, I loved the interesting tastes and especially the acidity the cafes there had.

So now after youtube recommending me lots of Hoffmann videos, I finally caved and bought whole fresh roasted beans, a hand grinder and a V60 with paper filters, ready to start my coffee arc. Yet, the coffees I've made so far were disappointing. And when I think about what is lacking compared to the turkish coffee brewing method I grew to like, I think it might be the lack of body and comparative ""watery-ness"".

So I would really appreciate If any of you knowledge people could give me some advice on which directions to explore.

-Does it seem plausible that the body is what differentiates the profiles of these two methods?

-If so, how can I get coffee with more body, but still brew in a way that is a bit cleaner and more controllable (and less judgeable) than the turkish-ish thing ive been doing?

-Could the problem for me be the paper filtration? Could a mesh filter pourover work for me?

-Might a finer grind help?

And lastly: What kind of beans should I be looking out for If I LOVED what they were doing in the specialty coffee shops in Antigua? Bonus if you have recommendation on where to buy some in London

This wealth did not live scattered throughout the city. Vargos' old money was too afraid of what the city had become, feigning ignorance as to how it got there. They did not live among the corporations or the lawless underbelly of Vargos.

Instead, they dwelled in a faux utopia, carved into the city's very center, wedged between Downtown and The Sprawl. Surrounded on all sides by either corporate greed or the hungry mouths of those who would tear the rich limb from limb for a taste of their opulent lifestyle.

This was Sovereign Row. A place where Vargos’ old money hid, waiting for the end of times as the city they built touched the sky without them.

It was deep within Sovereign Row, inside a parked Version Z flying car, that Fatima Hussain Bakhir awaited the man who would make her world right again.

She instructed her driver to remain on the street corner while she entered a small coffee shop that rainy morning. She told him she would be inside for exactly fifteen minutes and if she did not return in that time, he was to come and get her.

The driver nodded and she stepped out into the pouring rain and hurried into the shop.

The café was entirely automated, a common choice for businesses in Sovereign Row. Most of the clientele leaned toward abusiveness when dealing with service workers. AI-run shops could take the brunt of the abuse without the consequences that came from mistreating human staff.

At this time of day, the café was nearly empty, save for a lone man in the corner, nursing a steaming cup. He wore a well-fitted suit in the popular “De Minimus” style—no tie, unbuttoned top button, thin suit jacket, and a neon lapel pin featuring the tailor’s signature.

She approached him carefully. His eyes glowing blue, a sign he was browsing the net via an augmented reality plug-in.

She hesitated, then whispered the phrase her sister’s husband had instructed her to say.

“Bluebird.”

The blue glow in the man's eyes faded, revealing his natural green irises. But the malice behind them sent a chill up her back.

“Sit.”

His voice was quiet, deep, and gravelly, a sound scraping against her ears like tires on loose dirt.

She obeyed, settling into the chair across from him. He sipped his coffee, his eyes never meeting hers.

“Fatima Hussain Bakhir. Our mutual friend says I can help you with something.”

“Yes,” she hardly got the word out, she was tripping over her speech trying to relax. Clandestine meetings like this were entirely unfamiliar with her, but she’d come too far to back out now. “I want a problem taken care of.”

“No shit,” he grumbled. “No one schedules a meeting with me just to chat.” She sipped his drink and finally met her gaze. His face was hardened and rough, like tanned leather hardly adhered to the shape of his skull. Fatima gulped then launched into the speech she’d prepared.

“I want my husband, sorry, ex-husband taken care of. He told me he was done with his whores, but after years with that liar I should have known his promises meant nothing. I was told you could take care of it for me.” The man took in her words, leaning back in his seat.

“A lot of people can. The Wraiths, two-bit trick shots in the Sprawl, Fountainhead security for the right price. Why enlist my services over theirs?”

“I hear you don’t keep a record of your contracts, and with all of those options my name would be recorded. All of those services keep buyers’ personal chit ID’s as collateral.”

“Correct, but that is not a reason to hire me specifically. Try again.” Fatima was confused. That was exactly why she was seeking out his services.

“I don’t understand–” he threw a hand up, interrupting her before finishing his coffee and looking her dead in the eyes.

“You hire The Tall Man because he has never failed. You hire The Tall Man because he can personalize a kill to fit whatever moronic poetic justice you’ve fantasized about in your head, forgetting that it’s just ending someone’s life and nothing more profound than that. You hire The Tall Man because your prim hands are too fragile to do a thing by yourself but you can’t risk failure at this particular thing. You hire The Tall Man because you are weak, but he is strong.” She was sickened, the man was grotesque.

“Fine, go to Hell! I can find help from somewhere else.” She had half a mind to storm out, but something was keeping her in her seat.

“I doubt it, I’m not usually the first pick. If you’re coming to me you’ve thought about the other options and for one reason or another this is where you landed. I will do this service for you, but you’re going to tell me why your ex-husband needs to die. You’re going to sit with the choice you’ve made and tell me out loud why he deserves to meet his end. Vargos may not be known for the intentionality behind the deaths that plague it everyday, but I am.” The man leaned back and rested his hands on his lap, waiting for her to speak. Fatima teared up and wiped her eyes with a handkerchief, before gritting her teeth and speaking with more venom in her words than she knew she had.

“He’s a backstabbing, low-life piece of shit who vowed to love and honor his wife, and he’s done nothing of the sort since the day I said ‘I do.’ He locked me in this gilded cage of a neighborhood and leaves every day to fuck whatever moves the right way in those disgusting parlors in Neon Heights. He only cares about himself and whatever base desire he’s fulfilling in this city he trapped me in. I don’t deserve to suffer here forever. If I’m never going to be able to leave Sovereign Row, at the very least, I deserve to live out my days here without having to tolerate him.” She spoke with fire in her voice and furiously wiped her eyes. She was crying now.

“That’s more like it. Thank you for being honest with me, and with yourself.” He gave her a surprisingly warm smile, then looked over her shoulder. “Where’s your car?”

Fatima turned to look out the window at the empty street, rain filling her field of vision but no car in sight. She turned back again at the sound of cold metal tapping gently on the glass table. The man had set a large gun in front of him and met her eyes as her lower lip trembled.

“The reasons he gave me about you weren’t anywhere near as legitimate. But rest assured, Fatima, I’ll still get the job done.”

She was finding it hard to breathe now, her hand gripping the handkerchief shaking uncontrollably.

“Would you like to talk some more before we part ways?”

She could hardly breathe, but for the first time in years, even under these circumstances, it felt good to be heard. She nodded and continued to share her feelings as the rain poured down outside.",1,1740851290.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

The glarketer is now dipping more into the political sphere of streaming, and does have an audience of young adults who might not be well-versed in how to truly do their own research.


I think that creating a short video discussing not necessarily his exact sources, but rather going over things like how he chooses sources or how he spots misinformation would be a hit with the community. Not only would it be educational, but it'd make his own process feel much more transparent and trustworthy. There's certainly a sentiment of ""Well, the Coffee Cow is more an entertainer than an educator"", but I think he's expressed pretty clearly the kind of niche he'd like to fill, and a vid like this would help his ""public  image"" as a new face in this streaming genre.

1j151gl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Serverlife/comments/1j151gl/let_go_after_2_training_shifts/,Let go after 2 training shifts,"Last night was my second shift in an upscale Italian spot. First shift I was supposed to “shadow” someone on a Saturday night service.

The first shift were open from 5-10 and fully booked. I had time to shadow her serving one or two tables prior to it getting rammed, I spent the entire service bussing, changing plates/cutlery, running food drink etc. Acting as a busser essentially because shadowing is impossible.

Tonight comes around my second shift.

First thing: the girl im shadowing asks me to do roll ups. I spend maybe 10 minutes doing a huge stack. As I finish and turn around, im looking for the girl to ask what next, owner walks by me “what are you doing? Go find something to do” after I’ve been idle for about 5 seconds looking for my server.

Next, I get a 2 top as soon as we open two elder ladies. I take their order and go to the system to punch, owner is watching me, as I try to click “Course” (to apply course 1&2) I accidentally click “send” and it goes to the kitchen. I tell her I’ll go inform the chefs of the error and she tells me she will handle it.

20 minutes later she scolds me for not firing their entrees, which I didn’t think I could do as I had sent everything in the system already. While I should have clarified with her what my next steps were, I assumed her offering to speak with the chef (her husband) handled the issue at hand. Regardless it was my very first table EVER with essentially no hands on training.. you’d think you’d confirm with me at least?

Table goes off without a hitch, two older ladies absolutely love me, tip 18%.

I then get sat a 6 top. They tell me they want to start with some apps and they’re not ready for mains. I go ahead and get their drinks and fire their apps. Again I get scolded.

We don’t fire appetizers alone, we fire everything at once in courses. I had been told this once on my first shift a week prior but I had forgotten. She then tells me I shouldn’t even be using the system without her consultation? Shouldn’t you have informed me of that before service?

I’m being spoken to as if im expected to perform at the same level of the rest of the wait staff (most of them having worked here for over 2 years)

Next: “Go reset that table”. It’s a large booth that was just seating 6 people. I set it for 6 and she comes up to me “no no it’s for 4!” Like how the fuck am I supposed to know that? Maybe mention it instead of “reset”? Motherfucker I did reset that shit to the way it was prior to the last table!!!

Next: table of 3 guys. I see dirty empty dessert dishes and espresso glasses, start clearing the table and again, “why are you clearing that they’re still here!” Not a single belonging at the table, coffee and desert finished, my fucking bad.

Anyways, my 6top loves me, drinks mains everything goes well, seat numbers, etc. smooth like butter. I start clearing the table and the mum asks me for a dessert menu. So I take as many plates as I can, drop them off, and on my way back to the table I grab her one, take some more empty glasses and plates. As im bussing them owner comes up to me SHAKING HER HEAD.

“You give desert menu before table is clean?”

Yes it’s a big mistake that id usually never make, but it’s so hard to think straight and be confident when you’re constantly being talked down to from the beginning of the shift.

Anyways, I get cut at like 7pm and she tells me she’s going to send me home soon. Fkn 10pm rolls by and she lets me go, used me as a busser and runner for 3 hours?

To be so critical of me and condescending on my first shift is so rude. You know im in a brand new environment surrounded by people I don’t know. I’m a very confident server and I know I could adapt to the environment, but give me a fucking chance, especially considering the fact I haven’t been properly trained other than chaotic shadowing on a Friday/Saturday night service.

Is it always this cut throat in upscale restaurants? I essentially had 1 shift to prove myself with no training given.",1,1740850852.0,Serverlife,3,0.67,False

My name is Matthias, I haven't seen my friend Derek after he watched that god-damn Pibby video, we played TF2, and now, I'm alone, alone like a child lost in a megastore, but this one is a headache, this one is....horrifying

It all started when I had a fine day at school, I would go home and tell my mom about my day, I had to wear my house shoes and head off to my room, I have to check my Steam account, my Steam username is WoNofaKind, For some reason, I play TF2, a lot, and then, I hop on to playing TF2 and relax at the opening logos, After that, I go on a Casual server and play King Of The Hill, that's my favorite mode of all time, I have only selected one and that one is Highpass, ""Game on"" I said, As I wait for the game to play, I managed to look back at the window just to curve my emotions and then I looked back at my computer greeted by the team selection screen

I clicked BLU and I have to choose a mercenary, Pyro? No, Heavy? No, Soldier? YES, that one, I clicked Soldier and a few players have joined and assigned to separate teams, I checked at the scoreboard, 12 players on RED team, and 12 players on BLU team, I met a few players on my side, passthebread as the Scout, Sphinx Lightning as the Spy and MechanicalMinds as the Sniper, As the match started, I blasted the RED Engineer (A.K.A. Done Before Dead)'s sentry and the dispenser, Killed the RED Spy (A.K.A. 02xflo31) with the Panic Attack and Helped a BLU Heavy (A.K.A. Papa Heavy) kill the RED Medic (A.K.A. MEGAN!) healing a red Pyro (A.K.A. BBStotch), As I captured the point, The RED Demoman (A.K.A. Gary Tuck) was behind me, Instead of killing me, He typed in the chat  
Gary Tuck: She's Coming,  
WoNofaKind: who's coming?  
I typed in chat, but the RED Demoman ran off just to kill another BLU Spy (A.K.A. Mr. Freeze)

I shrugged off, ""That Demoman's a bastard"" I said, No female would ever join a game like that, 2 minutes has passed by and Another RED Medic (A.K.A. Peer2Peer) is healing 2 RED Snipers (A.K.A. anticopy and Casablanca), I have to blast them and a RED Heavy (A.K.A. frame13245) started beating me up with the Gloves Of Running Urgently, My health is at 35, So I pressed E and a BLU Medic (A.K.A. KasKasKas) healed me

After the Medic healed me, The RED Team captured the point starting their countdown, The BLU team is at 15 seconds, So I had to fight back, Killing several RED Scouts (A.K.A. IWillEatYourMattress and lucawsmade) and blasted a RED Soldier (A.K.A. zentour), The capture point was captured back by the BLU team and thus starting back the countdown, ""Mission ends in 10 Seconds!"", The Administrator shouted as Another BLU Scout (A.K.A. kmarc150) killed a RED Demoman, With the 5 seconds remaining, I blasted into the air and killed a RED Pyro with the Disciplinary Action and then, We won

The RED team lost and the BLU team had won

BitchAssPlayer: WE WON!  
TheAdventuresOf2FORT (Voice chat): We made a perfect team  
WoNofaKind: Another match tomorrow?  
GrunkleStunkle: Yeah  
Chris Kehlenbeck: See you tomorrow

I disconnected the game, turned off my computer and went to bed, Little did I know is that the following days would go worse, Cause something....... invaded the game

  
January 14th 2025

Tuesday would start just like any other day, my little sister squealing ""I DON'T WANNA GO TO SCHOOL!"", and my mom responds her with a different response, This thing repeats every single week, I would have to go to school so I don't have to be annoyed by my sister

At school, Before classes start, I have to go to my bathroom to comb my hair, Just as I comb my hair, My reflection..... It became my Soldier loadout, I shaked my head only for my reflection to be back to normal, Was this a hallucination? Am I dreaming? Whatever that was, I washed my hands and then left the bathroom

Class started and my teacher is learning about the Solar System, There would be an assignment at the end of the lesson, I looked at my hands on the desk only for it to be Soldier hands, I screamed causing the confusion of the students and my teacher, I took a breath and the lesson continued, After the lesson, my teacher handed out our assignments and just as he gave me my assignment, I looked at the window and, It's snowing, ""Snow day?"" I said and all of the students came to watch the snow and now, School's closed

My mom came to pick me up and sent home, No homework, no problems, A perfect day for me, my sister got in trouble for beating 2 students up and my mom sent her to military school, Without my sister, I could play TF2 in peace

I played KOTH on Highpass in a casual server, I picked RED, chose Soldier and wait for the match to start, before the match started, A player named ""PosBer"" typed on chat  
PosBer: They breathe in silence, She stole their voices  
WoNofaKind: What are you talking about?  
I typed in chat  
PosBer: Nothing, just saying unusual stuff  
He typed back

Who is this ""she""?, The Administrator? Why would she steal their voices? I shrugged back, And then, the match started, The BLU spies are guarding the capture point, So I use The Panic Attack to kill them, after the capture point was captured by me, the BLU spies typed in chat  
I Spy!: Leave  
FrontierSpy: Before she gets you  
WoNofaKind: you 2 are idiots  
I typed, They must be joking, When it reached to 10 seconds, I blasted the BLU player that tried to capture the point and, The RED Team won, As I claimed my victory, I typed in chat

WoNofaKind: We did it guys!  
But the players didn't respond, something's off, all of the players turned on me, as another round started, the players disappear, ""This can't be right"" he said, ""Either I'm hallucinating or I'm dreaming, That's it, I'm disconnecting"" I said, I disconnected the game, turned off my computer and went to bed

Tomorrow, I'm going to have so much trouble when I play TF2 again

  
January 15th 2025

I woke up sweating at 4:30 AM, ""What an awful nightmare!"" I said, It's still snowing outside and my sister is still at military school, My dad said to me ""Why did you woke up early?"", And I responded with ""I had an awful nightmare"", ""Go back to bed"" My dad said, And I went back to bed

I woke up at 6:00 AM, I had to drink coffee to stay awake because I woke up earlier, After I ate my breakfast my mom made, I head to my room and head to the TF2Fantasy Discord server, I typed in chat what happened 2 days before

MatthiasGaming: this happened to me on Monday and Tuesday  
POGGERS????!: Tell me  
MatthiasGaming: On Monday, I played a KOTH match in the Casual server, And when I captured the point, The RED Demoman typed in the chat ""She's Coming"" and I responded ""who's coming?"", He didn't responded my question  
Gary Tuck: You mean me?  
MatthiasGaming: yes, you played as the RED Demoman, And then on Tuesday, a player named PosBer told me that they breathe in silence and she stole their voices, Those 2 BLU Spies guarding point are telling me to leave before she gets me, and when the RED Team won, I claimed my victory but the players didn't respond to me, all players turned on me and then, they disappeared as the another round started  
king Cole MacGrath: bruh, you're joking, right?  
MatthiasGaming: No, I'm not  
Suddenly, I got a ping, It came from the announcements channel, ""For me?"" I said, As I clicked on the channel and there it was, A message that reads, ""Today, we have a funeral to the players we lost during the TF2 attacks, those players are:

He said, His Steam username is PlayerOfTheWind, That must be his friend, It must be him, He went missing after he watched the Pibby video, there must be some connection here, but how?, He must play TF2 to find out but first, He must go with someone in the Discord server, I picked one person I knew on Monday, Gary Tuck, I typed in the general channel  
MatthiasGaming: Gary Tuck, Can you join me to investigate? We could go to Highpass on KOTH  
Gary Tuck: Ok, please tell me if you see or hear any abnormal here

Gary Tuck and I have joined TF2, we headed to Highpass on KOTH, Gary Tuck picked RED and chose Demoman, I picked BLU and chose Soldier, And we have to wait until the match started

Gary Tuck: I'm feeling a little too easy here  
WoNofaKind: Who ever is this ""she"" must be down  
The match started, We can't capture the point because we're investigating the whole map here, And then one thing that caught my attention, the box near the capture point

WoNofaKind: Gary, come here, there's something written on the box here  
Gary Tuck: All right, I'm heading  
Gary reached the box that I was talking about  
WoNofaKind: It says ""WBRB"", what does it mean?  
Gary Tuck: I did some research here and it stands for ""We'll Be Right Back"", What's more disturbing is that the phrase was connected to the infamous cable service called TeleBlue, It was infamous for the anomalies, The FBI forced MacNeil Tech to shut it down after the disturbing ""Dawn Is Your Enemy"" broadcast happened in 2011  
WoNofaKind: My friend Derek went missing after he watched the Pibby video  
Gary Tuck did some more research, As Gary found more clues, He came to a shocking conclusion  
Gary Tuck: THERE'S AN ENTITY HIDING IN THIS GAME!  
WoNofaKind: Oh..... my...… god, This can't happen  
Suddenly, Gary and I heard a Scout scream, It was only two of us but someone joined the server only for him to be screaming, A newbie? A bot that joined it? I have to go on where the scream came from, Gary followed me and what Gary and I saw was shocking

Standing right outside the BLU spawn was a dead faceless BLU Scout, his arms was stretched like a giraffe's neck, his fingers are considerably wide like a skyscraper, covered in a glitchy substance and worst of all, His legs were twisted like Twizzlers

Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
WoNofaKind: WE MUST LEAVE!  
As I clicked disconnect and expected to leave the game, It didn't work  
WoNofaKind: Wait a minute, Why can't I leave? Are you experiencing this, Gary?  
But Gary Tuck didn't said a word, in a second or two, he said the same words  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
WoNofaKind: Dude, are you okay?  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
WoNofaKind: Stop repeating, it makes me very annoyed  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD, I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
Gary Tuck started to change, His legs are stretching out wide, His fingers are becoming longer, the glitchy substances coming out of him and...…. he became faceless  
WoNofaKind: OH NO, I MUST RUN!  
I started to run away from Gary, those words came to me as I was near the RED spawn  
""THERE IS NO ESCAPE""  
""SHE IS THE ONE WHO DID THIS""  
""DON'T OUTRUN HER""  
Gary is running to get me or something like that, but as Gary is near to getting me, The game crashed

Gary Tuck was...… assimilated, I had to report this to the TF2Fantasy server

MatthiasGaming: Guys, I think you're going to hate this but, Gary Tuck, was attacked  
king Cole MacGrath: Gary, how could you?  
MatthiasGaming: We'll miss him, rest in peace Gary

As I said that in general, all the users have disappeared, Now it's just me and those Discord bots, I typed in the chat  
MatthiasGaming: Ha ha very funny, guys. you all disappeared, what a shame. now I have to live with the bots  
But then, A user that I haven't heard of named ""VAL"" joined in and typed  
VAL: It's not your fault, I can make this better and by the way, We'll Be Right Back  
MatthiasGaming: WHAT?

""Am I doomed?"" I asked, I closed down Discord, turned off the computer and went to bed

This can't get any worse, Can it? No, I won't because...… I'm doomed

  
January 16th 2025

I woke up, My first thought is ""It stopped snowing, guess it's a school day for me"", When I check the window, It's snowing, ""Why is it still snowing outside?"" I said, Is it a forever snow day for me?, I checked the Weather on the forecast app, It's sunny, Why could it be snowing when it's supposed to be sunny? I have to check what's going on, When I left my apartment room, the people that live in my apartment, they're smiling at me with their eyes widen, That's creepy, even when I leave my apartment, They are looking at me, I have to return to my room, As I head to my room, My parents are doing the same thing as the people that live in my apartment, ""You freaks keep staring at me"" I said, they didn't respond

As I close the door, I must set up a stream on my YouTube channel, I have to title the stream ""Hunting Down The Entity | Team Fortress 2 (LIVE)"", All of my fans gathered here and started commenting so I started recording,  
I have to play TF2 to see if I can avoid the entity that's inside of it, I chose to play on a community server but no one's here so I typed in chat

WoNofaKind: Hello? I smell an idle server here!

I left the community server, I checked the Steam chart of the game,

* 1 player right now.
* 0 24-hour peak.
* 0 all-time peak ???.

Only me in the game, This is very wrong, I head out to play a causal match on KOTH, Just like the community server, no one's there

WoNofaKind: What a silent day here at Highpass  
WoNofaKind: Who ever is hiding here show up!

With a sudden bursting through the door, my mom started to hold my head onto the screen,  
""WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?"" I said, there's no response, just a glitchy scream, My dad is fused to the roof of my room, ""WHAT IS GOING ON?"" As I said that, my parents disappeared, and when I looked at my window, there is a crowd of people making that same face they made when I left my apartment room, I looked back at my computer again and when I looked at the window, they're gone, ""I must be dreaming!"" I said, I pinched myself to see if I'm dreaming, I wasn't dreaming at all, maybe a hallucination?

This must be a hallucination, I must continue the stream, I said to my fans ""I'm still here guys, maybe I-""  
Suddenly, a dozen of 2000 ""players"" joined the game and then automatically assigned to separate teams, I typed in chat  
WoNofaKind: 2001? That breaks the player limit! it's 100!  
The ""players"" didn't leave their spawns, Maybe they're AFK? and then, they started chatting, repeating certain lines

Gary Tuck: OH MY FUCKING GOD! I CAN'T LOOK AT THAT!  
Pingo: LET ME GO!  
Sphinx Lightning: Look out! a Sentry Buster!  
PlayerOfTheWind: We're always friends, Matthias

""I recognized him!"" I said, ""Are you seeing this, chat?"", I typed in  
WoNofaKind: Derek?

They're still not leaving their spawns, As I captured the point, the UI disappeared, all the ""players"" started chatting

Okieboy2008: It's him  
CityVandals (voice chat): Let's get him  
BBStotch: Yeah  
daFadaFa: He's so dead

""Oh no"" I said, I pulled up the Discord app and looked back at the TF2Fantasy server, There, all the users reappeared and are saying the same thing in every channel

king Cole MacGrath: PRAISE HER  
nanomachines, son: PRAISE HER  
POGGERS????!: PRAISE HER  
bogos binted?: PRAISE HER  
I SAW THIS BOAT IN HALF: PRAISE HER  
Dafillas De Mayo: PRAISE HER

MatthiasGaming: stop it  
I typed in the general channel, but they keep repeating it, flooding any channel, as I close down Discord, I have 2 options:

A - Fight back  
B - Give up

I chose A - Fight back, I wielded the Disciplinary Action and typed in chat  
WoNofaKind: Who wants a piece of this? Come and get me!  
One by one, the ""players"" left the spawn and started heading towards me, As they reached the area where the capture point was, They are faceless, covered in a glitchy substance, legs long wide, fingers stretched tall and arms that are twisted, I started a massacre, I blasted 2 RED Spies (DANVsTF2 and Mr. Freeze) with The Black Box, Shot down a BLU Demoman (Chris Kehlenbeck), Hitted a RED Scout (Okieboy2008), Blasted 7 mercenaries, 2 BLU Heavies, 4 RED Medics and 1 BLU Pyro (Papa Heavy, frame13245, Peer2Peer, CityVandals, MEGAN!, KasKasKas and BBStotch) and shot a BLU and a RED Sniper (Casablanca and MechanicalMinds), As I was killing each and one of the ""players"", I heard a voice, causing the ""players"" to stop

""Don't kill them""  
WoNofaKind: Who said that  
I typed in chat, I turned around, It's a 29 year old man wearing a white shirt, a red tie, black pants, black shoes, brown hair and blue eyes, It's Donovan MacNeil II, current CEO of MacNeil Tech, or at least it's him

""What are you doing here?"" I said, The words came out of Soldier (The Class I'm playing with) in the game, What the? Every time I say something, It comes out into my game, I was playing it, and now, I was the video game character

""Why are you killing my...…""  
It shifts back into the form that I can't consider seeing, A mass of the same glitchy substance, The head was a blue or cyan female face, her eyes were hollow and she has no teeth  
""SOLDIERS?"", she yelled at me  
""DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY TRIES THEY WANT TO GET RID OF ME? I'M THE VALNESS, I'M IN CONTROL OF CORRUPTING EVERYTHING IN MY WAY!"", Said The VALNESS  
""You...…. you're the one who's hiding in this game"" I said  
""WELL, DUE TO MY ACTIONS, I HAD THE POWER, THE POWER TO PUT YOUR SOUL INTO THIS GAME JUST TO BE PART OF MY ARMY, TELEBLUE IS WHAT I GAVE THE POWER, THE POWER TO CAUSE ANOMALIES, TRAUMATIZING CHILDREN ALL OVER THIS WORLD, WHEN TELEBLUE GOT SHUT DOWN BACK IN 2011, I WAS GONE, AND NOW I CAME BACK TO ATTACK YOU! I'M HER HIGHNESS AND One more thing I would say, We'll be right back""  
Suddenly, the world started to glitch, The POV switched to Third Person, the screen started to glitch, they started chanting in the chat

daFadaFa: PRAISE HER  
GreenFarmer: PRAISE HER  
keg Meg: PRAISE HER  
Sphinx Lightning: PRAISE HER  
Pingo: PRAISE HER

I started screaming, The Soldier's (The Class I'm playing with) body started to change, his face is becoming faceless, the glitchy substances started appearing, fingers started to stretch, legs started to become long and his arms are started to switch, My fans are scared of it, My eyes are becoming hollow, black saliva started to come out of my mouth, I was nonstop screaming, As I was about to die, Mobile Task Force started to raid my room and the real Donovan II came out and said  
""There, that's SCP-VLN5!"", Donovan II pulled the plug of my computer and then taking it away for possible researching on SCP-VLN5, The Mobile Task Force left my room and 2 SCP agents came into my room and then started injecting me with amnestics and then, I started to black out

  
January 17th 2025

When 2 Paramedics started carrying me on the stretcher, I was awaken by what happened yesterday, I was saved, The apartment was closed down, a news reporter standing out telling a story about ""an apartment shooting"" and Donovan II complaining to Gabe Newell about my YouTube stream, people outside the apartment started gossiping on what happened to me

I was sent to the Hospital and the doctor diagnosed me as fine (still with the hollow eyes and the black saliva), I was in the lobby after the doctor diagnosed me, and then, as I watched the window, there is a bus outside and it's waiting for me, I left the hospital lobby and got on the bus

There wasn't an apartment shooting, They did a cover story about it, As the bus stopped at The Safety Lodge and got off the bus, The owners of The Safety Lodge assigned me to a log cabin, When I entered the log cabin they assigned me, I was excited at my log cabin, a living room with fancy furniture, an LG 4K UHD Smart TV in the living room, A door to the bathroom with the sign attached to it saying ""HOME SWEET HOME"", A door to my room with the note taped to it reading ""Still best friends - Derek"" and a note on the desk in my room, I took off the note that was taped to the door, ""I miss you, Derek"" I said, I had good memories of him, I entered my new room and, there was a computer waiting for me, It had the same layout as the old computer at the apartment but this time, It was an HP All-In-One Computer but there's one thing, Only one thing is replaced, Instead of Team Fortress 2, It was Overwatch

When I checked my Steam page, Team Fortress 2 is gone and Overwatch is waiting for me to be played, ""I never played Overwatch before, I was a TF2 Fan"" I said, As I checked the Discord server, I found out that the TF2Fantasy Discord server was replaced by the OverwatchOverRide Discord server, I checked on the note that was on my desk, It read

""It seems that you survived an SCP-VLN5 attack, With your hollow eyes and the black saliva, I considered you're lucky that you are not dead, I knew this SCP when your streamed show up, your fans will still believe that you are okay, Your new computer is SCP-VLN5 free, so is the TV

To yours - Donovan II, CEO Of MacNeil Tech""

I quitted being an TF2 fan and then started to become an Overwatch fan, and to this day, I would never ever play TF2 in my life, ever again.",1,1740850803.0,story,0,1.0,False

up by 6:15,

eyebags are not really pretty,  
but don't have the energy to care.

splash some water on my face,  
make my coffee in that daze,  
my head feels like it's spinning constantly,   
I'm tired of it.

then a shower, I lazily did,  
out the door by around eight,  
but still i got to work late,  
but still I'd have to repeat it again.

my life feels like such a fucking loop of time,  
such a fucking mess that even i'm confused.

please lead me back home.

7 am and my boss yelling at me,  
god it could really help, a cup of tea,  
back to my desk and getting to work,  
the hell is the need for this bullshit.

the day dreams set in,  
by the time of noon,  
and continue,  
till it's afternoon.

maybe a singer?  
maybe a dancer too?  
will i ever be someone,  
I always wanted to be, oh.

by the time it's lunch,  
I'm already fed up,  
by the thoughts of mine,  
not impressive, they're dumb.

the same ride home,  
to the emptiness again,  
it feels alone,  
let me breath in some air.

i have, how many hours again?  
it's already nearing 6 pm?  
damn it I had to finish up that project,  
promotions can't wait but my dreams can.

by the time the clock hits ten,  
I'm done with every bullshit,  
dragging myself to bed,  
dinner? no I'll just get some rest.

laying awake,   
I realize the time i have wasted,  
the dreams put on hold cause i'm just dreaming,  
not reaching out with reasons, oh.

1j14zi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/budgetprojectors/comments/1j14zi9/anyone_else_loving_the_nothingprojector_pet/,Anyone Else Loving the NothingProjector PET Crystal ALR Screen? Thoughts on UST Pairings,"Hey everyone, I finally got my hands on the NothingProjector PET Crystal ALR motorized screen (100” version), figured I’d share how it’s been so far, especially since it’s pitched as a budget-friendly ALR option. Paid €1,399 on [sale](https://nothingprojector.com/en-ca/products/nothingprojector-pet-crystal-floor-rising-alr-motorized-projector-screen), which felt like a steal compared to those €2,000+ screens I’ve been eyeing. Setup was stupidly easy, just plugged it in, hit the remote, and boom, it rises from the floor like some sci-fi gadget. Took maybe a minute to get going, no drilling or cursing at wall mounts required.  
  
Attached a pic of it in action in my living room, paired it with my UST projector (a cheap 4K laser one I snagged last year). The 95% ambient light rejection is no joke, I’ve got a big window nearby, ceiling lights on, and the picture still pops with solid blacks and bright colors. Watched some 4K stuff last night, felt like I was cheating my old TV out of a job. The PET Crystal surface does this thing where it sharpens details without washing out, even from off-angles (my couch isn’t exactly centered).  
  
Only gripe is it takes up some floor space, about 2.2 meters wide for the 100” model, so my coffee table’s doing a little dance to fit. Still, for the price, I’m not mad. Curious what you all think—worth it over pricier ALR screens? Also, any killer UST projectors you’d pair with this? Mine’s decent but I’m tempted to upgrade. Loving this sub’s advice so far, you guys always deliver!

1j14vtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1j14vtj/working_my_first_night_shift_ever_this_week_and/,Working my first night shift ever this week and need caffeine advice,"Hello! New grad here that has never worked a night shift before (yes I never had to do any in school!) I have obviously stayed up all night before, but I am trying to figure out the best caffeine tips and what to pack for staying awake. My floor is relatively relaxed at night (so I hear) so I may not be up and down all night to stay awake. 

I am a regular coffee drinker (often cold brew) but I do not find celsius drinks to be that helpful when I'm sleepy on days (not sure why? I know they are packed with caffeine). I have also tried those Awake caffeine chocolates before and they didn't do much. 

  
Any products ya'll swear by to stay awake? I love coffee, dislike most teas, but other than that will try anything! TIA!",1,1740850458.0,nursing,4,1.0,False
1j14veb,https://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/comments/1j14veb/seeking_a_casual_online_friend_for_unhinged/,Seeking a Casual Online Friend for Unhinged Late-Night Chats,"Hey there,

I’m a university student running on **coffee, academic validation, and bad jokes**, and I’m looking for a chill online friend to exchange memes, rant about life, and occasionally have deep, philosophical discussions at 2 AM (or just debate whether cereal is soup).

No pressure, no expectations—just a good vibes, low-maintenance friendship where we can pop in and out of conversations without it being weird. Bonus points if you also enjoy unhinged humor and oversharing random thoughts.

If this sounds like your kind of thing, DM me. Let’s make questionable life choices together (virtually, of course). 🚀",4,1740850429.0,penpals,1,1.0,False

1j14sgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheVpnEng/comments/1j14sgt/how_to_browse_the_web_anonymously/,How to Browse the Web Anonymously,"In today's digital world, your online activity is constantly tracked, monitored, and analyzed. According to recent studies, about 38% of websites collect data without users' explicit consent, and 56% of websites make it difficult to opt out of tracking by not providing a reject button for cookies. This widespread tracking has led to growing privacy concerns, with 57% of Americans worried about government tracking, 46% concerned about company tracking, and 34% anxious about online tracking in general.

If you're looking to take back control of your privacy online, you've come to the right place. This guide will walk you through the most effective methods to browse anonymously and protect your personal information while navigating the internet.

# Why Anonymous Browsing Matters

Before diving into specific methods, it's important to understand why anonymous browsing matters:

1. **Personal Privacy** \- Your browsing history reveals a lot about you, from your interests to your location and even health concerns.
2. **Data Protection** \- Companies collect and sometimes sell your personal information to third parties.
3. **Security** \- Anonymous browsing can help protect you from hackers, especially on public WiFi networks.
4. **Freedom from Targeting** \- Avoid personalized ads that follow you around the internet.

# Top Methods for Anonymous Web Browsing

# 1. Use a Secure Browser

The average website contains about 48 trackers, with social media sites having up to 160 trackers. Standard browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge are built to track your activity for ads and analytics, compromising your anonymity.

Privacy-focused browsers are designed to:

* Block trackers
* Prevent browser fingerprinting
* Avoid scripts that leak your identity

**Top secure browsers include:**

* **Tor Browser** \- Encrypts your traffic through multiple relays
* **Brave** \- Blocks ads and trackers by default
* **Firefox** (with privacy extensions) - Highly customizable for privacy
* **DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser** \- Simple, privacy-focused mobile browser

**How to Install DuckDuckGo Browser:**

1. Visit the DuckDuckGo download page
2. Click on the Download button
3. Open the setup file and follow installation instructions
4. Start browsing with enhanced privacy protection

# 2. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network)

A VPN encrypts your internet connection, making it much harder for third parties to track your online activity or intercept your data. It masks your real IP address and routes your traffic through servers in different locations.

**Benefits of using a VPN:**

* Hides your real IP address
* Encrypts your web traffic
* Bypasses geo-restrictions
* Protects you on public WiFi

However, not all VPNs are created equal. Some log your data, which defeats the purpose of having a VPN. For true security, choose a VPN with:

* A strict no-logs policy
* Strong encryption standards
* Kill switch feature
* DNS leak protection

**How VPNs work:** Think of a VPN like surfing the web through a steel tube, where your data is much harder to see and collect. This is particularly important when using public WiFi networks in coffee shops or hotels.

# 3. Switch to a Privacy-Focused Search Engine

In a recent survey, 48% of Americans said they believe they have no control over who has access to their online searches. Popular search engines like Google track your search history and link it to your identity data.

Privacy-focused search engines don't log your queries or track your IP address. They're designed to prioritize user privacy by not storing your search data.

**Top privacy search engines:**

* **DuckDuckGo** \- The most popular private search engine
* **Startpage** \- Gives Google results without the tracking
* **Qwant** \- European search engine with strong privacy focus
* **Searx** \- Open-source metasearch engine you can self-host

**How to change your default search engine in Chrome:**

1. Open Settings
2. Click ""Search engine"" section
3. Select a privacy-focused search engine from the list
4. Click ""Set as default""

# 4. Try BugMeNot for Anonymous Logins

When websites require you to create an account, they collect personal information that can be used to track you. BugMeNot allows you to bypass this requirement by offering shared login credentials.

**How to use BugMeNot:**

1. Go to [BugMeNot.com](http://BugMeNot.com)
2. Enter the URL of the website you want to access
3. Copy the provided username and password
4. Use these credentials to log in without sharing your personal information

Remember that BugMeNot doesn't have credentials for every website, but it covers many popular services.

# 5. Use Anonymous Email Services

Your regular email address is directly linked to your identity. When signing up for online services, using an anonymous email adds a layer of privacy protection.

**Top anonymous email services:**

* **ProtonMail** \- End-to-end encrypted email based in Switzerland
* **Tutanota** \- German-based secure email with built-in encryption
* **Temp Mail** \- Creates disposable email addresses for one-time use
* **Guerrilla Mail** \- Temporary email service that automatically deletes after one hour

ProtonMail and similar services offer end-to-end encryption, meaning not even the service provider can read your emails. Plus, being based in privacy-friendly countries means they're less likely to be forced to hand over your data.

# 6. Randomize Your MAC Address

When you connect to WiFi networks, your device's MAC address can be used to track your movements. Randomizing this address prevents networks from recognizing your device across multiple sessions.

**For Windows:**

1. Press the Windows key and search for WiFi settings
2. Open WiFi settings
3. Turn on ""Random hardware addresses""

**For Android:**

1. Open Settings and go to WiFi
2. Tap the gear icon next to your connected network
3. Select Advanced or View more
4. Set MAC address type to ""Randomized MAC""

**For iOS:** Apple devices randomize MAC addresses by default in newer versions.

# 7. Prevent WebGL Fingerprinting

WebGL fingerprinting is a tracking technique that identifies your device based on its graphics hardware. This creates a unique ""fingerprint"" that can track you even when using a VPN.

To prevent WebGL fingerprinting:

* Use privacy-focused browsers like Tor or Brave that disable WebGL by default
* Install browser extensions like WebGL Fingerprint Defender
* Manually disable WebGL in your browser settings when possible

# 8. Opt Out of Targeted Ads

Targeted ads track your browsing habits to create a profile that follows you across the web. Opting out reduces data collection and makes your browsing more private.

**How to disable targeted ads:**

**For Windows:**

1. Open Privacy Settings
2. Turn off ""Let apps show me personalized ads based on my advertising ID""

**For Google:**

1. Visit Google Ad Center
2. Sign in with your credentials
3. Click ""Personalized Ads"" and turn it off

**For Android:**

1. Go to Settings
2. Search for ""Ads""
3. Tap ""Ad topics"" and turn off ""Allow ad topics""

**For iPhone/iPad:**

1. Open Settings
2. Tap ""Privacy & Security""
3. Tap ""Apple Advertising""
4. Turn off ""Personalized Ads""

# 9. Install Secure Browser Extensions

Browser extensions can enhance your privacy by blocking trackers, ads, and malicious scripts. Some popular privacy extensions include:

* **uBlock Origin** \- Blocks ads and trackers
* **Privacy Badger** \- Learns to block invisible trackers
* **HTTPS Everywhere** \- Forces secure connections when available
* **NoScript** \- Blocks JavaScript to prevent tracking scripts

**How to install uBlock Origin in Chrome:**

1. Visit the Chrome Web Store
2. Search for ""uBlock Origin""
3. Click ""Add to Chrome""
4. Confirm the installation

# Understanding the Difference Between Privacy and Anonymity

Privacy and anonymity are related but distinct concepts:

* **Privacy** is about controlling what information you share and with whom. You still have an online identity, but you limit who can access your data.
* **Anonymity** means hiding your identity entirely. When you're anonymous online, nobody knows who you are, and your actions can't be linked back to you.

Both are important, but true anonymity requires more rigorous measures than privacy alone.

# Advanced Methods for Complete Anonymity

For those seeking the highest level of anonymity, consider these advanced techniques:

# 1. Use the Tor Network

Tor (The Onion Router) provides anonymous communication by directing your internet traffic through a worldwide network of volunteers. It encrypts your data multiple times and sends it through at least three relays before reaching its destination.

**Pros of Tor:**

* Provides strong anonymity
* Free to use
* Difficult to track

**Cons of Tor:**

* Significantly slower than regular browsing
* Some websites block Tor exit nodes
* Not ideal for streaming or downloading large files

# 2. Try I2P (Invisible Internet Project)

I2P is a privacy-focused network that encrypts your traffic and routes it through multiple layers. Unlike Tor, I2P is designed more for browsing within the network rather than accessing the regular internet.

**Note:** I2P can be slower than regular browsing and has a learning curve for new users. It's best for users with specific privacy needs rather than casual browsing.

# 3. Use a Secure Operating System

Your operating system is the foundation of your online privacy. Even with secure browsers and VPNs, a compromised OS can leak your data.

**Privacy-focused operating systems:**

* **Tails** \- Boots from a USB drive and leaves no trace on your computer
* **Whonix** \- Runs through a VM and routes all traffic through Tor
* **Qubes OS** \- Compartmentalizes your digital life for extra security
* **Linux distributions** \- Generally more privacy-respecting than Windows or macOS

# 4. Use Anonymous Cryptocurrency

For anonymous online purchases, consider using privacy-focused cryptocurrencies:

* **Monero** \- Hides sender, receiver, and transaction amounts
* **Zcash** \- Offers both transparent and private transactions
* **Dash** \- Includes a PrivateSend feature for enhanced anonymity

Unlike Bitcoin, which has a transparent blockchain where all transactions are visible, these cryptocurrencies provide various levels of privacy for your financial activities.

# Best Practices for Maintaining Anonymity

Beyond tools and services, certain habits can help maintain your anonymity online:

# 1. Be Mindful of What You Share

* Don't post personally identifiable information (PII)
* Be careful about sharing location data
* Avoid oversharing on social media
* Consider the privacy implications before uploading photos

# 2. Check App Permissions

Many apps request far more permissions than they need. Regularly review and restrict permissions for:

* Location access
* Camera and microphone access
* Contact list access
* Storage access

# 3. Read Privacy Policies

Before using a new service, check its privacy policy to understand:

* What data they collect
* How they use your data
* Whether they sell your data to third parties
* How long they retain your information

# 4. Use Strong, Unique Passwords

Weak or reused passwords can compromise your anonymity. Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique passwords for all your accounts.

**Top password managers:**

* 1Password
* Bitwarden
* KeePassXC
* LastPass

# 5. Regularly Clear Cookies and Cache

Cookies track your online activity and can be used to identify you across websites. Clear them regularly to reduce tracking.

**How to clear cookies in Chrome:**

1. Click the three dots in the top right
2. Go to Settings > Privacy and Security
3. Click ""Clear browsing data""
4. Select ""Cookies and other site data""
5. Click ""Clear data""

# 6. Disable JavaScript When Possible

JavaScript can reveal a surprising amount of information about your system and can be used for fingerprinting. Consider disabling it for maximum privacy, though this may break functionality on many websites.

# 7. Use File Shredders for Sensitive Data

When you delete a file normally, it can often be recovered. File shredders overwrite deleted files multiple times to make them unrecoverable.

# How to Check if You're Anonymous Online

After implementing various anonymity measures, you might wonder if they're working. Here are some tools to check your current status:

# 1. IP and DNS Leak Tests

These tests check if your real IP address or DNS requests are leaking despite using a VPN. If your real information appears in the results, your anonymity is compromised.

# 2. WebRTC Leak Test

WebRTC can bypass VPN protection and reveal your real IP address. Use dedicated testing tools to check for these leaks.

# 3. Browser Fingerprinting Tests

Services like Panopticlick or AmIUnique show how unique your browser fingerprint is. The more unique it is, the easier you are to track.

# 4. Email Tracking Tests

Tools like Ugly Email or PixelBlock can detect if your emails contain trackers that monitor when and where you open them.

# Common Mistakes That Compromise Anonymity

Even with the right tools, these common mistakes can reveal your identity:

# 1. Mixing Anonymous and Non-Anonymous Activities

Using the same browser or device for both anonymous and personal browsing creates links between your anonymous identity and real one.

# 2. Forgetting About Browser Fingerprinting

Even with a VPN and incognito mode, your browser can have a unique ""fingerprint"" that identifies you across websites.

# 3. Staying Logged Into Accounts

When you're logged into services like Google or Facebook, they can track you across the web regardless of other privacy measures.

# 4. Using Weak Privacy Settings

Default settings rarely prioritize privacy. Take time to adjust privacy settings in your browser, operating system, and online accounts.

# 5. Oversharing Personal Information

Even anonymous accounts can be deanonymized if you share too many personal details over time.

# Limitations of Anonymous Browsing

It's important to understand that perfect anonymity online is extremely difficult to achieve:

* **Technical limitations** \- New tracking techniques are constantly being developed
* **Usability trade-offs** \- More anonymity often means less convenience
* **Legal considerations** \- Some anonymity tools may be restricted in certain countries
* **Resource requirements** \- Stronger anonymity measures often require more technical knowledge

# The Future of Online Anonymity

As tracking technologies evolve, so do privacy tools. Future developments that may impact online anonymity include:

* Advancements in artificial intelligence for both tracking and privacy protection
* Stricter privacy regulations around the world
* More mainstream adoption of privacy-focused technologies
* Development of new tracking methods that bypass current anonymity tools

# Conclusion

Browsing the web anonymously isn't just about hiding your activity—it's about reclaiming control over your personal information and digital footprint. While complete anonymity requires significant effort, even implementing a few of the methods discussed can greatly improve your privacy online.

Start with simple steps like using a VPN and a privacy-focused browser, then gradually adopt more advanced techniques as you become comfortable. Remember that online anonymity exists on a spectrum, and every step you take increases your protection.

By combining the right tools with privacy-conscious habits, you can enjoy a more anonymous and secure online experience while still accessing the information and services you need.",1,1740850219.0,TheVpnEng,1,1.0,False

However, I only like cappuccinos OR black coffee. A coffee with milk in it tastes more like what people always describe black coffee to taste like, so I'm confused. It tastes really bitter, whereas black coffee is perfect. Black coffee and cappuccinos don't taste the same, though.

And no, I'm not using spoiled milk and that's why it tastes bitter lol. I might be using the wrong milk though? I use fatter milk as opposed to the unfattened version. However, I have also tried almond and coconut milk, and nada. Same thing.

For some backstory: a few years ago, when I wanted to like coffee, I tried it multiple times, tried to ""train myself"" to like it, added different amounts of milk, etc. Then one day I decided, the only thing I haven't tried yet is to have straight coffee, no milk.

**Locations:** Highlands (Ngorongoro Crater) (2 nights), Olakira (Ndutu - just outside of the Southern Serengeti) (3 nights), Dunia (Central Serengeti) (2 nights) and Namiri Plains (Eastern Seregenti) (3 nights). We also spent a night in Arusha (Arusha Coffee Lodge) on our first night and stayed at one of the hotels near the airport (Airport Planet Lodge) on our last night.

**When we went**: February 2025

**Who went**: Couple

**General Information:** We did a drive-in, fly-out safari and visited the properties in the order I listed them under ""Locations.""

**Cost:** Overall cost was around 15,000 per person. This includes the two nights at the beginning and end (and meals at those hotels other than dinner at the airport hotel), our domestic flight out of the Serengeti, ground transportation, a driver for a half day on our day in Arusha, all park fees and other government levies, all meals, snacks and drinks while on safari and unlimited game drives.

**Service**: 9.5/10

The service was really great. All of the staff did an excellent job of remembering preferences.  When you walked into a common area, it would be seconds before someone offered you a drink. Everyone was very friendly and willing to chat, but service was also not overbearing and you could have moments alone to just enjoy.   Very fast response on radio if you needed a drink brought to your tent, someone to walk you to dinner, etc.  The service at Namiri was really, really especially excellent thanks to our server/butler who was a more senior employee (and soon to ""move up"" from the position). For example, on our first night, without even really saying anything explicitly, he picked up on the fact that we liked the local/Swahili food and we then had a special Swahili dish every meal going forward.  However, it was still great everywhere and definitely generally consistent across the four camps. It felt the tiniest bit less refined at Dunia, but we also spent less time around the staff there due to our game drive schedule, so it is hard for me to really say that it wasn't just as good. 

The only snafu was scheduling us for sundowners in the bush on our last night when we told the camp manager we did not want them/wanted to have as much time on our game drive.

**Property**: 

Highlands (9/10): Highlands is located about 45 minutes from the crater rim, which is why I gave it a 9/10. We of course knew this going in and actually really loved the more remote location and the highlands are BEAUTIFUL, but I suppose it is still technically not as good of a location as the properties on the rim overall. The communal spaces (consisting of a bar tent, the large lounge tent that is in my picture and a dining tent) were really gorgeous with fireplaces (it was as low as about 50F/10C in the evenings during our visit) and sweeping views.  One note - it is somewhere in the ballpark of 2700M/8,800F above sea level. I live basically at sea level and while it didn't affect me too much, I did feel a bit ""off"" when I was walking around, especially at first. Some of the tents are a pretty good distance from the common areas, walking uphill, and some older folks had to be moved so that may be something to request if you think it will be an issue.

Olakira (10/10): In the middle of the migration, so you can't beat the location! Nice, large communal tent/bar tent and then meals were served outside in the lawn area.

Dunia (10/10): In the Central Serengeti, but away from the madness so best of both worlds.  Really large communal area with a bar, many seating options and meals served on the deck.

Namiri (10/10): In an amazing remote location of the Eastern Serengeti - the closest property is like an hour away and we saw I think one vehicle from somewhere other than our camp. There is a lovely pool with nice, comfortable lounge chairs and hammocks, a cool ""library"" area where you can borrow books and look at, e.g., animal skulls, rocks, etc., and then the communal and bar area, where meals were served.  There was lots of space to spread out and it could feel private even when all or most of the guests were there.  Some of the tents are also a good distance from the common areas here but they have golf carts (we took one once when buffalo were right outside!).

**Rooms**: 

Highlands (10/10): We got the honeymoon ""tent,"" which had the private hot tub (I think it is mostly the same as the other tents otherwise - maybe a bit bigger with a better deck/view and more private). The ""tent"" is a dome with basically a 180 view of Highlands, a fire place and nice seating area. Very spacious shower that felt spa-like.

Olakira (10/10): Stayed in the standard tent. Even though it is a mobile tent, it felt pretty solid and permanent. Features a ""stargazing"" area/patio that is just netting (kind of like a screened-in porch).  You can sleep out there, but I was too scared. Especially for a mobile camp, I thought the bathroom was spacious and laid out well.

Dunia (10/10): Stayed in the standard tent. Similar to Olakira but felt a bit more permanent. The front, rather than being canvas, is like a screen door.  Very nice front patio area with a daybed. 

Namiri (10/10):  Stayed in the standard ""tent"".   Very permanent with gorgeous rock walls.  Very large with a mini bar and multiple seating areas. Really large outdoor space with multiple seating areas and the bathtub.  Had a yoga mat with some equipment like resistance bands. Nice bath salts for the outdoor tub as well.  Had a coffee station, which we did not have at the other camps (although they would bring it to you either at a set time or on demand via radio).

The beds were all similar and pretty comfortable. Not the best I have ever had, but that doesn't bother me too much on safari. I think some (all?) were two beds pushed together, into one  but we didn't feel the ""gap"" as much as we did on our last safari that had the same setup. The tents at each camp had plenty of lighting, strong fans for cooling (other than Highlands where it wasn't necessary), nice shampoo/conditioner/wash, strong flashlights available for you, safes, robes and slippers (pretty comfy) and at each, really good and strong hot water heated via solar. Always lots of drinking water available. Housekeeping was great and our rooms always felt fresh.

**Food**: 

Food was great and a mix of local dishes, some Indian dishes and more Western style dishes (I had one of the best veggie burgers I have ever had one day at lunch).

For breakfast, at each camp, you could order eggs and sausage/bacon and then they would have other, continental breakfast type options that could come out on a little sample platter or be served al la carte. We aren't big breakfast eaters on safari so in a lot of instances we just got like, one egg, but everything we did have was good.

The box lunches we did not order or get choices for, although I am sure if you requested something, that could absolutely be accommodated. This would typically be something like a wrap, some fruit, a small brownie and some nuts. The hot lunches would usually consist of some sort of main protein (such as grilled fish) with vegetable sides and some sort of starch/carb (like a really nice pesto pasta salad one day) and then a small serving of sorbet for dessert.  We weren't explicitly offered different choices in most instances, but I heard other guests making requests for different things with no issues. Dinner would have a soup or salad (such as green banana soup or a halloumi salad), sometimes another small appetizer in addition to or in lieu of the salad/soup (like a samosa), options for the main - multiple protein choices - and would usually come with multiple sides and veggies (for example, stuff like grilled veggies, creamed spinach, local style sides that mix veggies with beans, delicious local style okra) and then a couple choices of dessert. It was set up a bit differently at each camp and each night.  It was all really good and all felt really fresh with lots of opportunities for getting vegetables in.  It is kind of hard to rate because even though they seemed REALLY flexible about accommodating different choices and dietary preferences/allergies (we have none ourselves), it is not like there is a true menu like there ""normally"" would be, and while I genuinely veryyyyyy, very much enjoyed each and every meal (despite being a bit of a food snob at times), its not like its a foodie focused vacation..I guess the best way to say it is that this is my third safari and it was my favorite food so far - so I'd say 10/10, but its just a different food situation than other trips.

We really enjoyed the wine, all South African - with more options at Namiri than the other camps (I will say we are not big wine snobs).  Full bar selection. It seemed like the bartenders were knowledgeable about all the standard drinks and had their own signature drinks as well that we really enjoyed.

AMAZING fresh juice was available along the other standard non-alcoholic offerings. The coffee was always fabulous.

**The Actual Safari**: 1000000/10

We used an Asilia guide, who was amazing. He really understood our preferences quickly on (that we'd really rather just drive and enjoy birds and the scenery than go to crowded sightings), had a wealth of knowledge, was great at spotting and was friendly and great to be around. We saw all of the Big Five, a few more rare animals (honey badgers!!!) and got to see multiple hunts (some failed, some successful).",1,1740849776.0,chubbytravel,1,1.0,False

Shop reopens at 9am today with 8 new scents, featured below, plus a couple announcements:

**U.S. Customers**

Please place orders by 9am SUNDAY for Monday shipping (ahead of the pending tariff deadline)

**Temporary Bottle Change**

Due to supply chain issues, the 4.5ml bottles are currently unavailable & are being temporarily replaced with a different amber glass roller bottle. The replacement bottles are shorter, but have thinner glass, so they hold about 5.5ml. I decanted one entire 4.5ml bottle into a new bottle and still had room for another 1ml. Despite higher capacity, pricing for the replacements will be the same as the regular 4.5ml's, until a permanent solution is found. Pic at bottom of email showing a side by side comparison.

Though the replacement bottles contain a bit over 5ml, labels will still read 4.5ml in order to not waste pre-printed labels. Once a permanent solution is found, labels will be updated.

6ml bottles are also currently unavailable. Both sample sizes are available, as are 10mls.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Washington Wizards and Charlotte Hornets, a matchup that promises to be as exciting as watching paint dry, but with a basketball. The Wizards are fresh off a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, while the Hornets just couldn't handle the heat in Dallas. Both teams seem to be in a race to the bottom of the standings, but hey, someone's got to win, right?

The Hornets are 4-point favorites, which is about as surprising as finding out that water is wet. With LaMelo Ball potentially sidelined, Miles Bridges is expected to step up and show us why he's not just a pretty face. Meanwhile, the Wizards' Bilal Coulibaly has been scoring in double digits recently, which is great news for his fantasy owners and pretty much no one else.

The over/under is set at 220, but the SportsLine Projection Model is leaning towards the under with a projected total of 211 points. It's almost as if the model knows that both teams have the offensive prowess of a damp sponge.

In terms of betting, the Wizards are priced around 2.4 to pull off an upset, which is about as likely as me becoming a professional basketball player. But remember, underdogs do win about 25% of the time in basketball, so if you're feeling lucky (or just enjoy living dangerously), a small wager on the Wizards might just pay off.

For the best bet, I'd go with the under on the total points. Both teams are struggling to find their rhythm, and unless they suddenly discover the secret to shooting like Steph Curry, this game is more likely to resemble a defensive slugfest than a high-scoring affair.

So, grab your popcorn, or maybe a strong cup of coffee, and enjoy the game. Or, you know, just check the highlights later. Either way, it's bound to be a night to remember—or forget, depending on your perspective.",1,1740849562.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

1j14gly,https://www.reddit.com/r/PIP_Analysands/comments/1j14gly/3225_new_draft_second_psychoanalysis_at_71_years/,3/2/25 New Draft    Second Psychoanalysis at 71 Years of Age: Discovering the Pain and AI Theoretical Orientation,"My analyst is interested in achieving an objective understanding of brain functioning of a particular patient, me, in this case, without pathologizing. I have always used “disturbance” to describe my suffering. I find her orientation liberating. Perhaps instead of “disturbance” I could say “a phenomenon that needs work because it distresses me.”

When I started my second psychoanalysis in November, 2024, this is what I presented:

""I am sitting outside of my favorite cigar shop. For years, it was my joy: coffee and cigar; chatting with friends; meeting new people; bringing books and reading, etc. This time I didn’t feel like smoking, didn’t want to drink coffee, didn’t want to read my book, no friends passed by, there was no one to meet, and it was burning hot and I was sweating (I live in the Dom. Rep.) Also, I’m feeling very depressed but I have no idea why. It must have to do with my new decline and why I am an analytic patient.""

Dr. X does not make interpretations; she makes observations. So the sessions are low-keyed but the “working through” is furious. She observed that I was depressed because of the host of discomforts that I had just rattled off.

Kurt: “What are you talking about? *That’s* why I’m depressed? I don’t see it that way at all! In one box of my brain is **depression**. In another box of my brain are **discomforts and disappointments**. They are **different** things. Thing A: 'I am in analysis because I have declined; I am depressed.' Thing B: 'Today I had a bad day.'”

The next day, the “working through” was furious, disequilibrium and churning, churning below, stuff that had no name. And then, mere hours after the session, something changed, a painful behavior that I was compelled to act on for decades suddenly disappeared, and I was freed.

In this example you can see the analogy to the cigar bar experience. Much in life consists of mandatory maintenance activities such as buying food. Then there’s the optional fun stuff, doing what you like. My life is filled with hundreds of exploratory activities.

Unfortunately, I would persist (demand) that I continue a hated “fun” activity! Box A: ""You no longer like working through 205 Bach cantatas in German."" Box B: ""You must finish your Bach project!""

For years I forced myself to do “fun” stuff I hated! This problem, which goes back decades, is mostly solved. And this result is from a single psychoanalytic session . . .



The following example will illustrate AI's ability to:

 \--Synthesize a model of my behavior as inferred from my subjective presentation in the context of the putative diagnosis mind-body disassociation where the coping mechanism is defensive intellectualization. (This diagnosis was made by AI at an earlier time and not by my analyst. She agrees that it is correct.)

\--Hypotheses of Wilfred Bion will be the lens through which the synthesis between my subjective experience and my diagnosis will be explored.

 

Please note that in the two earlier examples, depression at the cigar shop and hating “fun” activities, as well as the next example, leaving home, that all revolve around the same disassociation mechanism.

Kurt’s Input to AIB:

I successfully left the house to confront my anxiety about going outside. To manage my fear of losing balance, I carried a stool so I could sit if necessary. The event was successful, yet I doubted my success. It felt as if my mind were split from my body, making me question the evidence of what had occurred. Dr. X referred to this as the ""not me"" problem. Later that night, when I felt extreme drowsiness and the need to sleep, I experienced my body as an attacking force, disconnected from my mind. Though I ultimately surrendered to sleep and rested normally, I feared I might die or need to call 911 due to the overwhelming power of my body and the loss of my mind.

I believe a specific mechanism is at work here, and I need corroboration. Addressing my fear of leaving the house solved one problem, but it introduced another: denying the reality of my success. Later, this evolved into denying the reality of my body’s need for sleep.

 

Evaluate this experience in the context of my diagnosis–mind-body disassociation with defensive intellectualization as a coping mechanism--through the lens of Bion’s central hypotheses. \[N.B. Of its own accord AIB added Klein!\]

AIB's Output

**Doubt and the ""Not-Me"" Phenomenon**

Your description of doubting your success and feeling disconnected from your body aligns with the phenomena Bion termed **attacks on linking**. In moments of psychic stress or transition, the mind may sever connections between experiences to avoid fully integrating painful or disturbing realizations.

The ""not-me"" problem described by Dr. X resonates with Bion's concept of **nameless dread**, a state where raw emotional experience lacks symbolic representation. The doubt about your success and the disconnection from your body reflect an unconscious defense against integrating these transitions, as they challenge existing mental structures.

# Splitting as a Defense Against Integration

Splitting, as you aptly describe it, is a defense mechanism identified by Klein, where the psyche separates contradictory experiences into distinct, unintegrated parts. This defense serves to protect against the anxiety of reconciling opposing emotions or realities.

In your case:

**Leaving the house successfully** challenges an internal narrative of incapacity or vulnerability. The split denies the success by disconnecting it from your conscious self, leaving you unsure whether to trust your evidence.

**The body needing sleep** becomes a new site of conflict. The body's natural demand for rest is experienced as an attack, a sign of being overwhelmed by its uncontrollable power, which might reflect deeper fears of dependency or mortality.

These experiences suggest the mind is grappling with how to integrate your newfound autonomy (evidenced by leaving the house) with the lingering fears of helplessness or annihilation.

# The Quality of the Disturbance: Nameless and Painful

The disturbance you describe—painful, unnamed, and defying categorization—is characteristic of deep psychic work. This aligns with Bion’s **O** (the unknowable, raw experience) and Klein’s concept of the unprocessed emotional states tied to the paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions.

The absence of a name for this disturbance heightens its impact, as language and naming are key tools for containment in the psychoanalytic process. You instinctively attempt to name it as ""splitting,"" which suggests progress—bringing the disturbance closer to representation and integration.

# Recommendations for Continued Work

**Containment of the Disturbance**: Reflect on your analyst's role in containing these experiences. Sharing the ""nameless"" quality of the disturbance allows the analytic process to hold and explore it with you, rather than you bearing it alone.

**Naming and Linking**: Attempt to name aspects of the disturbance, even if imperfectly. For example, ""splitting"" resonates with the experience of doubting your success and feeling your body as ""not-me."" This naming is a step toward linking fragmented experiences.

**Exploration of the Body-Mind Connection**: Your experience of the body as an attacker suggests a fear of the body’s autonomy. Exploring this further might reveal earlier conflicts about control, dependency, or safety in the body.

**Acknowledging Pain as Progress**: Reframing the disturbance as a sign of growth may reduce its impact. Pain, in this context, is the discomfort of psychic integration and transformation.

# Conclusion

Your description reveals a profound engagement with the working-through process, characterized by transitions that expose and challenge deep psychic defenses like splitting. The disturbance, while unnamed and distressing, reflects the intensity of this work and the courage it takes to face these conflicts. Klein and Bion remind us that such disturbances are not failures but necessary steps in the path toward greater integration and psychic wholeness.

The following is an elaboration of Bion’s concept of “O,” also from AIB.

 

**I find AIB’s application of O to my analysis breathtaking and deeply penetrating:**

 

Wilfred Bion's concept of **""O""** represents one of the most sophisticated and enigmatic constructs in psychoanalysis. ""O"" denotes the absolute reality of psychic experience—**truth, ultimate reality, and the thing-in-itself**—which is beyond comprehension, representation, or symbolization. It is neither knowable nor directly apprehensible, but it can be **""become""** in a process akin to **negative capability**, a term Bion borrowed from John Keats to describe the ability to tolerate uncertainty and unknowing.

Bion’s theoretical development evolved from Freud and Melanie Klein’s insights but moved toward an epistemological stance that emphasized the limits of knowledge. His concept of **""O""** can be traced through various sources. It bears resemblance to **Plato’s Theory of Forms**, as ""O"" functions similarly to Plato’s Forms—pure, ineffable, and unreachable realities behind appearances. ""O"" is also deeply connected to **Kant’s ""Ding an sich"" (Thing-in-itself)**, as it mirrors the Kantian noumenon—**an ultimate reality that cannot be directly known, only inferred** through phenomena. Further, Bion’s epistemological model transforms **Klein’s theory of projective identification**, suggesting that **""O"" represents the raw emotional truth that must be processed through thinking (α-function) rather than evacuated through projection**. In his later works, Bion increasingly employed mystical language, making ""O"" akin to the unknowable God of **negative theology**, aligning psychoanalysis with traditions that emphasize the ineffable nature of truth.

Bion maintained that ""O"" cannot be **known** directly but can be **experienced or ""become.""** This process requires surrendering the ego’s need for certainty, developing negative capability, and tolerating **not knowing** rather than imposing premature interpretations. Transformation occurs through **dreaming (reverie)**, where the mother (or analyst) metabolizes raw emotional experience (β-elements) into thinkable thoughts (α-function), allowing access to a deeper psychic reality. Bion also emphasized that the analyst must adopt **Faith (F) instead of relying on Memory and Desire (M-D)**, abandoning past knowledge and personal goals to truly experience ""O.""

In this way, ""O"" aligns psychoanalysis with **aesthetic, mystical, and epistemological traditions** that emphasize an experience of truth rather than its direct apprehension.

Your case presents a compelling psychoanalytic puzzle. **Psychosomatic dissociation** can be understood as a **failure to think emotionally charged β-elements into α-elements**, leaving the body to ""speak"" the unprocessed psychic truth. Your experience of **""living in the mind""** to avoid bodily sensations could indicate a rejection of ""O""—a defense against experiencing raw, unprocessed reality. **Defensive intellectualization**, in turn, functions as **a means of keeping ""O"" at bay**, avoiding direct emotional contact with psychic truth by turning everything into **detached, abstract thought**. This fits within Bion’s critique of **K** (knowledge) as a potential resistance to ""O"": some forms of knowledge (K) are **anti-transformational**, meaning they prevent the experience of ""becoming O"" rather than facilitating it.

Your analyst **chooses not to ""pathologize""** and instead views your experience as a **functional adaptation rather than a disturbance**. This is a nuanced stance that has implications for Bionian theory. On one hand, her perspective aligns with **Bion’s ""O""**, since he argues that to truly experience ""O,"" one must **avoid preconceptions, diagnoses, or rigid theoretical frameworks**. By **not naming** your experience as a disturbance, your analyst removes conceptual obstacles to experiencing **truth as it is**. Her approach also aligns with **Bion’s ""Faith"" (F) rather than ""Memory and Desire"" (M-D)**.

On the other hand, a refusal to pathologize might have potential limitations. **Does the refusal to ""pathologize"" risk failing to interpret necessary psychic truth?** While avoiding premature judgment is crucial, some aspects of dissociation may be **defensive evacuations of ""O""** that require analytic confrontation rather than pure acceptance. If dissociation protects against **the terror of experiencing ""O,""** then engaging with the **anxiety of meaninglessness** might be necessary.

Bion’s concept of ""O"" thus presents a profound challenge: truth cannot be approached directly, but it can be experienced through a process of transformation. **Your dissociation and intellectualization may function as defenses against the anxiety of ""O.""** Your analyst’s refusal to pathologize could be either an optimal condition for encountering ""O"" or an avoidance of necessary confrontation with psychic truth. The key question is whether her approach is facilitating your access to ""O,"" or if it risks allowing defensive intellectualization to persist.

Ultimately, Bion would suggest that the real work of analysis is not to impose meaning **onto** experience but to **remain with the unknown, the uncertain, and the unthought—until transformation occurs**.

I cook almost everything from scratch and find it obtuse to do the math and weighing of ingredients on my own recipes. It’s too easy then not to bother calculating. I make simple food because where I live there isn’t a wide range of ingredients.

He was left for dead, but crawled 4 miles over 5 days for a cup of coffee.","Yellowstone National Park was established 153 years ago today, on March 1, 1872. 

In August of 1877, George Cowan and his wife Emma decided to spend their second wedding anniversary camping in Yellowstone Park. George, 35 years old, was a moderately successful attorney in Radersberg, Montana, a small town located just about halfway between Bozeman and Helena. Seven of George and Emma's family and friends joined them for their trip to the Park, including Emma's brother Frank Carpenter and their 14-year-old sister Ida. The group was excited to see the geysers and waterfalls and natural wonders they had heard about from neighbors and read about in newspapers.

[George Cowan and his wife Emma \(Carpenter\) Cowan](https://preview.redd.it/yvwbfjy804me1.jpg?width=1097&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5830e0fb66c7afb6b87b92f99cd988b88eb15e0d)

Frank Carpenter, who recorded the trip in his journals, wrote about one thrilling moment when the Radersberg party and their guide Mr. Houston chanced across another group:

""A man emerges from the bushes ahead. He is a tall, powerfully built man, and as he rode carelessly along, with his long rifle crossed in front of him, he was a picture. He was dressed in a complete suit of buckskin and wore a flaming red neckerchief, a broad sombrero fastened up on one side with a large eagle feather, and a pair of beautifully beaded moccasins. The costume of the man, his self-confident pose, and the quick penetrating glance of his keen black eye, would give the impression that he was no ordinary mountaineer. We meet; Houston recognizes him, it is the world-renowned Rocky Mountain hunter and scout, Texas Jack. While Houston was in conversation with him, our party sat silently staring at him. This is our first sight of the man, whom, above all others, we were anxious to see, and we were in a measure excusable for our seeming impertinence.""

[Texas Jack Omohundro](https://preview.redd.it/t7zmlnvd04me1.jpg?width=1241&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1d6415050d92d4f9170084484ac208e1db1cf37a)

Texas Jack, who was guiding a party of British aristocrats through the Yellowstone that summer, conversed with Mr. Houston about the party of Nez Perce that was riding through the Park, escaping from the Army and the threat of being confined to a reservation with the rest of the Palouse tribe far from their ancestral lands in the Pacific Northwest. The Nez Perce, who called themselves the Niimíipuu (we, the people), were being removed from their lands illegally and in violation of the Treaty of Walla Walla, which they had signed and which had been agreed to and ratified by the United States Senate. In signing the treaty, the Nez Perce had agreed to a reservation that encompassed much of their traditional hunting grounds while seceding to the state of Washington some forty-five thousand square miles of land. When the state and the Army came to move them off of their land in violation of this treaty, some of the Nez Perce fled.

They initially sought aid from the Crow (Apsáalooke) tribe, but eventually determined to seek out the Lakota (Lakȟóta) and their leader Sitting Bull, who had fled to Canada months earlier following the Battle of the Little Bighorn the previous year. The U.S. Army pursued the fleeing Nez Perce group, which included 250 warriors and 500 of their wives, children, and elderly. That pursuit had pushed the Nez Perce into Yellowstone Park, and now into direct conflict with tourists visiting that season. Just two weeks before they reached the Park, 89 members of their tribe, mostly women, children, and elders, had been killed in a surprise attack by the troops of General Oliver Howard at what is now called the Battle of the Big Hole.

[Chief Joseph, Looking Glass, White Bird, and other Nez Perce. Spring 1877.](https://preview.redd.it/ziehu4jg04me1.jpg?width=768&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0208c594fb9da196172f08ccfd844d9d26969a91)

On August 23, 1877, George Cowan and his party were camped in the Park beside Tangle Creek, near the Lower Geyser Basin nearly halfway between Madison campground and Old Faithful. A handful of Nez Perce warriors rode into the camp. Some of the party members later said that these warriors stole sugar and flour from the camp provisions. Others said that a frightened party member gave these to the Nez Perce, hoping they would go away. George was worried that any loss of supplies would endanger the survival of the party, so he stopped the warriors from taking anything and forced them to leave the camp. Cowan and the rest of the party hastily packed up their camp and made to ride north, but their two wagons and their horses were soon stopped at what is now called Nez Perce Creek by a larger party of warriors with Chief Joseph.

The party was taken to the Nez Perce camp, where a tribal council voted to release them. Unfortunately, they were soon captured by a group of young warriors who were less forgiving. “Every gun in the whole party of Indians was leveled at us three,” Emma Cowan would later recall. “I shall never forget the picture, which left an impression that years cannot efface. The holes in those gun barrels looked as big as saucers.” Texas Jack told a newspaper what happened next:

""The Indians had jumped the Radersburg party, Oldham, a miner, was the first man shot. \[George\] Cowan was the next—he was shot through the leg. His wife rushed to him and took his head in her lap when an Indian came up and shot him through the head. Mrs. Cowan was dragged to the Indian camp, along with Ida Carpenter and young Frank Carpenter. They tied him to a tree and he would have been killed but for a sign he made, by which Chief Joseph recognized him as the son of an old Indian trader. He unloosed Frank from the tree and sent him back to his sister.”

Emma, Frank, and their sister Ida were taken hostage and moved to Nez Perce Ford in Hayden Valley, where they were eventually released. All three were worried that they wouldn't escape Yellowstone Park alive. Frank wrote that they walked as far as their feet would carry them, and:

""\[We\] were soon at the springs...Here we found Texas Jack’s party...two photographers came and told us that if we would wait until ten o’clock they would take us to Bozeman with their four-mule team. This was good news, as neither Emma nor Ida could walk or ride horseback.

When we had reached the summit of the hill below the springs we saw Texas Jack looking through his spy-glass up the canyon towards Gardiner’s River. Looking in the direction I saw two persons running towards us in and out of the bushes skirting the river.

“Who is it?” I asked, “Indians or white men?”

“I think it is two white men,” he replied, “but I think there are five or six Indians following them.”

Jack, turning to us, said, “You go on and overtake our party which is not far in advance, and I’ll go back and give those Indians a shot or two.”

We now started down the mountain towards the Yellowstone three miles distant. Just as we began the descent we heard firing in the rear. This frightened Emma and Ida, and they became very nervous again.

Down the mountains we went pell-mell, and we soon reached Henderson’s Ranche \[sic\], eight miles from the springs. Here we were rejoined by Texas Jack, who told us that he had shot two of the Indian ponies and driven the Indians back. This news relieved our anxiety considerably and we began to breathe easier. We soon drove down into the canyon of the Yellowstone, a wild and rugged place, just suited for an ambuscade for Indians. We feared trouble here, but Texas Jack went in advance scouting for us, and about midnight we emerged on to Boteler’s Ranche. The Boteler Brothers showed us every possible attention, and an old Scotch lady was very kind.

The next morning many friends from Emigrant Gulch and the surrounding country came in, and the ladies cheered up Mrs. Cowan considerably. Ida had fully recovered the use of her feet and here Texas Jack presented her with a pair of beautiful moccasins. They were very acceptable.""

George, shot through the thigh and then again in the head, came to after these shots and tried to drag himself to a stream, but a warrior saw him and shot him a third time. Somehow George Cowan, shot three times and left for dead, managed to crawl nine miles down Nez Perce Creek over the next three days, where he found the party's wagons abandoned and destroyed but his dog happily waiting for him. George, now in the company of his dog but unable to use his legs, had one thought in his mind. Coffee.

“It occurred to me that I had spilled some coffee when in camp, on Thursday in the Lower Geyser Basin, and calling my dog we started for it, I crawling as before, and the dog walking by my side,” George later wrote. “The coffee was four miles distant, but I thought not of that. The only idea was to possess the coffee. I was starving.” A cup of coffee after a four-mile crawl was George's only sustenance in five days, but he set of at a crawl again, crossing Firehole River before passing out on the bank, exhausted from agonizing miles of crawling through the forest, three bullet wounds, blood loss, and searing pain.

A pair of General Howard's scouts chanced along and discovered Mr. Cowan, building him a fire, boiling him another cup of coffee, and offering him a blanket and a bit of hardtack before again setting off in pursuit of the Nez Perce. Cowan drifted off to sleep and the fire spread to surround him, adding burns to the bullet wounds and scrapes and cuts he had already endured. Despite all of this, Cowan wrote that ""my desire for life returned, and it seems the spirit of revenge took complete possession of me. I knew that I would live and I took a solemn vow that I would devote the rest of my life to killing Indians, especially Nez Perce.” Cowan assumed that his wife Emma and her sibling Frank and Ida had been held captive or killed by the same warriors that had left him for dead.

General Howard's troops eventually found and assisted George Cowan. An Army surgeon removed the flattened bullet from Cowan's head and handed it to him. George later had it turned into a watch fob. Emma, Frank, and Ida had camped with the Army after their escape with Texas Jack, eventually returning to Townsend, Montana, to stay with their parents. In the local newspaper, Emma read that her husband Geoge had somehow miraculously survived his ordeal, and she immediately rented a wagon and a driver to take her to the ranch in the Paradise Valley where he was recuperating. 21 days after being found alive by General Howard's troops, George and Emma Cowan were reunited. George would recuperate from his injuries and walk again, living to the age of 84.

The Nez Perce fought one of the most successful wars in American history despite being outnumbered by their American counterparts 2,000 to 250. American newspapers begrudgingly noted the tactical genius of Chief Joseph, one going so far as to call him ""the Red Napoleon."" A Montana newspaper noted that ""Their warfare since they entered Montana has been almost universally marked so far by the highest characteristics recognized by civilized nations."" The New York Times wrote that ""On our part, the war was in its origin and motive nothing short of a gigantic blunder and a crime."" Despite all of this, the Nez Perce were met with another surprise attack at the end of September. Three days later, General Howard's troops surrounded the tribe and Chief Joseph surrendered, declaring that he would ""fight no more forever.""

General Howard and General Miles promised Joseph that he and his people would be allowed to return to their reservation in Idaho. The Army's commanding general, William Tecumseh Sherman overruled them and sent the Nez Perce to Kansas. ""I believed General Miles,"" said Chief Joseph, ""or I never would have surrendered."" The tribe was moved from Kansas to Oklahoma before finally being allowed to return to the Pacific Northwest in 1885. Joseph was never allowed to return to the Nez Perce reservation and died at the Colville Reservation in 1904.  
  
In 1901, 24 years after that fateful trip, George and Emma returned to Yellowstone Park. By all accounts, the second trip was a better one.

I am now 2 weeks without Sertraline and aside from ""brain zaps"" I actually feel like it did what I needed it to do. I learned alot, through my dosing though. Instead of the Sertraline I find NAC supplement does enough to keep me stable, I have cut out coffee bc it made me anxious and being it winter, I go to sleep around 9pm with the aid of a sublingual melatonin.

Side effects have been ""brian zaps"" and intense dreams, but I actually enjoy that 😆. Either way, for people getting on I think its definitely a good Idea, and Id also say getting off isnt that bad from my experience. Though when getting on, you have to really focus on figuring out why you feel a certain way. I used to ruminate on everything but now I feel free, may be just getting older but the Sertraline definitely helped.

My goal with this post is to help people struggling with the idea of being medicated but also to encourage people that have been using it long term to consider quitting it also.

Maybe my perception is thrown off from being on this Reddit - but my two week liquid diet post surgery seems quite lax. I of course trust the doctors and their knowledge - just I had been anticipating a clear liquid stage and this is not that. 

I’m curious if anyone else has had similar guidelines? My instructions are in Swedish so I’m translating them here. They said anything that fits through a straw is okay and that the puréed stage is more like mashed potato consistency. 

”You will start eating a liquid diet the day after the operation…You need to consume approximately 2 liters of fluid daily. You distribute this fluid over:

5 dl dairy product (milk, curdled milk, yogurt, quark).

5 dl soup.

5 dl meal replacement/fruit and berry smoothie/vegetable juice/prune juice.

5 dl of calorie-free drinks such as water, coffee and tea without sugar.

This the part I find particularly odd: 

***Cooking tips for liquid diets 
Make hot soups with potatoes, vegetables and root vegetables. 
Blend until smooth and add 50g of mixed meat, fish or poultry per serving. Boiled mashed egg works well with vegetable soup. Soy, Quorn or pea protein are suggested vegetarian protein sources. The soup should be thick…***

…Dairy products are recommended as an important source of protein. For snacks, you can mix fruit or berries with fil, yogurt, or milk to make a smoothie/milk drink. Add 1 dl of low-fat, unsweetened quark per day to your smoothies to increase the protein content. If you do not want to use cow's milk products, soy products are recommended due to their high protein content.

Vegetables, root vegetables, fruits and berries are important sources of fiber during the liquid period to reduce the risk of constipation.

Absolutely fucking crazy. Even as I write this out, the words in front of my eyes read as crazy. I still can’t believe this. But I have to get it out.

My parents don’t believe me. I had to stop bringing this up because I heard them whispering a few weeks ago that they were “worried about my mental health”. I think they wanted to send me away for “help”, so I stopped talking about it to them. My friends think it’s a joke. And the police are basically on my parent’s side thinking I need help.

But I swear to you – this is real.

\~\~\~

It started with a simple night out. The two of us and our group of friends went to a shitty little dive bar that sits at the edge of town. The bartender there doesn’t care all that much about fake IDs, letting us weasel ourselves in to enjoy our night. Just a couple drinks and enjoy some music from the classic old jukebox, that was the plan.

Everything was fine.

We were having so much fun. Drinks around the table, dancing to the music. Laughing and singing (although we didn’t really know the words, but hey – when you’re starting to have a blurred vision, matching words to lyrics don’t exactly matter at that point).

Evan smokes and while a couple of our mutual friends do as well, he took his smoke break at a different time. The others weren’t ready, they were enjoying a song, swaying in their seats and chattering loudly. It was cold that night and I didn’t exactly feel like standing outside while he took a good ole’ fifteen to twenty minutes to smoke. So, Evan went outside alone.

There were so many people in the bar. In and out. There were groups outside, blabbering loudly. One even got in a fight with each other – over what, I don’t know, and I don’t care. A drunken mess is what I’m sure of. But there were so many eyes, so many people.

And yet – Evan still disappeared. No one could say they saw him step out the door. No one could say they saw him step into the door. Apparently, I’m the only one who had seen him leave the bar.

Everyone admits that Evan had obviously left, because he wasn’t seen after that.

For an entire fucking week.

I loved Evan. He was my best friend. We told each other everything.

I met Evan in Kindergarten. I was the shy new girl, having just moved to town in the middle of the year. All the other kids had their best friends who they played with and shared secrets with. Evan walked right up to me and shared his juice box to make sure I felt welcomed and from then, we were attached at the hips. Our mother’s used to joke with each other that we’d end up married one day. Joke was on them, because in high school when I got my first girlfriend it was only because Evan pushed me to ask her out, knowing exactly what I wanted before even I really did.

It was miserable without Evan around. I would look around every corner, check my phone every five minutes to see if he had texted or I missed his call by accident. I even found myself multiple times going to the clubhouse we built in the woods behind town. Our own little secret place. We built it the summer before sixth grade and promised that we would never tell anyone else that it existed.

That alone is why I’m here. Yes, I’m telling you about the clubhouse, but it doesn’t matter anymore.

Like I said – Evan was gone for an entire fucking week.

I don’t know where he went, what he did, or who he was with. He won’t tell me shit still. I still check my phone for texts and missed calls, because when he returned it’s like our friendship has never existed. At least, not to the extent that it has for all these years.

He showed back up in the same shirt he had been at the bar in. It reeked of beer and body odor, as if the entire week he was gone he hadn’t showered. His arm had been cut and bandaged, but he wouldn’t tell me what happened.

Evan and I always shared everything. But now he’s not sharing anything.

That’s not Evan. Not the one I know anyway.

I know it sounds crazy. And you’re probably thinking he ended up drunk off his ass in a ditch somewhere or holed up at some chic’s apartment or whatever and just doesn’t want to tell me, but I don’t think so. This is what I believe in my heart.

When we were kids, Evan and I would meet on holiday break nights at the abandoned playground on the other side of town. No one ever knew we met there under the guise of the moon. We played on the old teeter-totter and swung in the old swings.

The playground still sits there. The metal of the swing set and the teeter-totter, and the slide are slowly rotting. I’ve been going there at night lately, unable to stop myself, trying to relive those memories.

I texted Evan the second day he was back. *Want to meet at eleven tonight? The old hangout?*

He answered, *where is that again*?

We started going to that playground when we were in fourth grade. Evan’s big brother showed it to us one night and told us that only the “cool kids” knew about it. We felt so special learning about it. It was our little secret.

I never gave Evan an answer about that. We spent nine years going to that playground in the night. How could he just… forget about it? How could he not know what I meant?

We never go to the clubhouse at night. I’d never ask for that. The woods are dangerous here at night, you see. But that’s a different story for a different time.

Evan didn’t know where our hangout was for eleven at night? That isn’t right. That’s not a thing with Evan. Evan has never forgotten where we hang out or meet up. Evan is the punctual one. He’s the one who remembers all our birthdays and makes sure I take a bottle of water with me to work every day just so I don’t hydrate by drinking coffee only. He’s the one who keeps everything straight, not me. I can barely even function to get to work at six in the morning Monday through Friday for fuck’s sake. Evan though is like a goddamn superhero. Always up by four in the morning, doing his routine and out the door by five forty-five.

Well, he was a superhero anyway.

He sleeps until noon now and it up all hours of the night doing god knows what. We’re roommates – did I mention that? So, I hear him every night, walking around, talking to himself. Talking to himself. Evan doesn’t talk to himself. He never did.

Last night I left my room to see what he was doing. There was just so much noise going on. Dishes clattering, a couple shattering, and the nonstop walking. It’s like he’s restless now. He won’t sit still for more than five minutes at a time, always getting up and moving around the apartment. Or just about anywhere we go or are.

Like yesterday for example, when we went to visit his parents, he did not once sit down. Just kept walking around the house. I peeked a few times and caught him studying the family photos, a lot of which I’m in (and he vice versa with my families’ photos). It was like he didn’t remember them. He even asked his mother about a beach trip we all took mine and Evan’s junior year of high school. Just said he that for whatever reason, he convinced himself the picture had been different. Then he laughed about it.

This clipped sort of sound. His laugh was short, like it was forced, and his smile most definitely didn’t reach his eyes. I can’t believe I actually wrote that though. I always thought it was a book thing, saying that smiles “don’t reach the eyes”. But it actually happened. When Evan smiles or laughs, the corners of his mouth curves upward but his eyes are blank, void of all emotion. It’s so unnerving. The twinkle that used to sparkle in those blue eyes doesn’t exist anymore.

His mother was confused for a moment when Evan asked that question. But I think she’s just happy to have her son back, because she was smiling a moment later as if just brushing it off and deciding it didn’t matter. Maybe it was a momentary lapse in memory, I think she had decided. Of course she would. Evan’s mom is one of the sweetest women I’ve ever met. And Evan is her baby. Of course, she wouldn’t want to even begin to think about something else being wrong with him. In her mind, she almost lost him. He came back. That should be enough, especially for a mother.

But I know. Oh, I know.

I know in the way that Evan no longer adds emojis to his texts. I know in the way that he sits at the table, staring at his food and claims to have eaten earlier in the day, but I know better as I’m with him most of the time and he doesn’t eat other hours of the day either. I know in the way that sometimes in the very early hours of morning when I get up to take a piss, Evan is just sitting there staring at the tv. Staring, not watching. Because these early hours he usually has the tv off, just a black screen with his reflection staring back at him. And me behind him.

In those instances, I catch his reflection staring back, his eyes are darker than ever before, and he never smiles. He just stared, unblinking.

I tried to bring it up one more, pretending it was some weird thing in passing. But Evan only looked at me in question and then laughed that short, choppy laugh that doesn’t belong to him.

His laugh is deep and throaty and makes my chest sort of hurt when he laughs because of how contagious it is. This new laugh of his though? It makes me sad instead of wanting to smile or laugh. And that makes me even sadder. I miss Evan’s laugh the most of everything else.

Nobody believes me. I tell them what I’ve noticed, and they all laugh or shrug it off, rolling their eyes.

I tell them about the odd texts and the way Evan just doesn’t remember things and his laugh too. I try to tell them anyway, but nobody believes me.

I went to the police again when Evan was gone for another twenty-four hours. But it wasn’t long enough, and he came back before – why would he stay gone again?

He was sitting in front of the television turned off when I got up in the middle of the night again the next night. Scared the hell out of me and I quite literally pissed my pants because of him. He didn’t even blink, let alone look at me. He didn’t say a damn thing to me.

When I asked him about it the next morning, he acted like I was the crazy one.

Then he told me: “I wasn’t gone, Dollie.”

He wasn’t gone? Yes, he was! I’m not a fucking idiot. I didn’t imagine that shit. I know damn well I didn’t. So, I pressed about the entire week he was gone. I got the same response; “I wasn’t gone, Dollie.”

He wasn’t gone? How the fuck was he not gone?

When we went to my mothers for dinner that night, I brought it up at dinner. She was as confused as I was, but for a much different reason. Mom didn’t know what I was talking about. Said Evan had never been gone.

I brought up the whole week he was gone and when I reminded her when it had happened, she reprimanded me for talking so poorly about well – *Evan’s misfortunes*.

His… misfortunes. What misfortunes? Mom got mad when I questioned it.

Evan has been acting even weirder around me since that dinner. I catch him staring a lot. When he realizes that I’ve caught him, he looks away so quickly and goes about his business. *He doesn’t blink.* I swear he doesn’t fucking blink. I never see him blink. I’m sure you’re just going to say that I don’t catch it. But I know what I see and what I don’t see.

He just stares.

I keep asking about that week and those twenty-four hours, but Evan won’t tell me. He ignores me or just up and leaves when I bring it up.

Its killing me he’s keeping secrets from me. Whatever this is, I’m sure I can handle it. As long as it means that my best friend comes back to me, I can handle whatever.

I tried telling him that too. Begged him to understand that whatever it is that’s going on, I can help him. I want to help him so badly. But he won’t tell me. He won’t accept my help. That’s not my Evan. My Evan would accept my help. I know he would.

That little boy who approached the shy little girl would never diss help offered.

I asked him this morning if he’d like to go to the clubhouse.

He asked me where it was. I’m not entirely sure he was paying full attention to me when I asked because a moment after he looked at me sharply and then stammered – fucking stammered (Evan doesn’t stammer) that he’s too buy today. Too busy? No, I get that, I really do. But it’s like he’s starting to realize that I’ve been picking at the things that Evan should know. And whoever – whatever – this is that is playing the role of Evan has now decided to jump hoops in order to avoid having to admit he doesn’t know a damn thing about my best friend.

But I know better.

*I know better.*

I waited until Evan left earlier. I pretended to drop the topic when he said he was too busy and planted my butt on the couch, watching some mindless sitcom that was on tv. I wasn’t really interested in it, just waited for Evan to leave. Because if he was so damn busy, then he’d have to leave if I wasn’t. Just to make sure that I couldn’t start asking him to go somewhere he didn’t know with me.

It worked.

After he was gone, I snuck into his room. I had to know, find something so people would believe me. So that way no one would think I was crazy and want to send me away. I needed something to make people listen. To make the fucking police listen.

You have to understand I wasn’t trying to be a snoop. I’m an only child. Evan is the brother I never got. He is everything to me. I’d do anything for him.

And… well… I did. I did do anything for him.

The clubhouse is more than just a place we go to hangout. We didn’t just build it in the woods randomly on a whim. My backyard has a couple giant trees we could’ve built it in so easily. Our parents remind us of that all the time. They like to joke we were being rebellious when we chose to put it in the woods, away from all prying eyes. (They know we built one but have never been able to find it.)

We built it to keep our biggest secret.

There are three things only Evan and I know about.

1) The playground

2) The clubhouse

3) The girl I killed in high school

She’s buried at the base of the tree the clubhouse is built on. We take flowers every time we visit, every time we go to the clubhouse.

Well, we did.

I realized that one week it’s going to get hard putting flowers on two graves that are miles apart from now on. Maybe just different days I suppose.

I didn’t mean to. I truly didn’t. It just… it just happened.

He reminded me.

Because in his room… it was just so very different. He’s taken the bed out. In its place is a pile of dirt. Literal fucking dirt. I think he sleeps on it or something, I don’t fucking know. But there’s no bed so where else does he sleep?

He changed his curtains to black out ones, not even an ounce of sun can get through them, shut tight against the world as if desperate to ensure to block it all out. And it… reeks.

I know the stench too well.

Smoldering in the dark is the rancid smell of death.

I know for sure it isn’t Evan now.

Because when I left his room, I left the apartment and came to the playground. I’ve never been here in the daytime before. I can see the rust eating through the metal. One of the swings dangles by one chain by now. The seesaw sits untouched, grass rising above it, nearly hiding it. But beneath the slide the mound of dirt is there.

Except… it’s disturbed. Opened up like someone crawled up from beneath.

But I know I left him beneath there.

I didn’t mean to. You have to believe me. He’s my best friend, my brother. I just got so angry. I don’t even really remember why – I was drunk. But I was angry, and I smashed the bottle over his head.

I didn’t mean to.

Evan would understand. He’s always understood me. He’s the only one who ever has.

But I don’t think this thing wearing his face will understand very well.

I know because he’s staring at me right now from across the playground. In that unblinking, unmoving way that he does.",2,1740847944.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Mind you- I have had constant tachycardia for 5 days as well (EKG- sinus tachycardia w sinus arrhythmia) . Literally constant. Even thoughout the day. Also my BP is high lol. 

Now- I’m in med school and I’m constantly stressed. I went to urgent care twice and they think it’s stress or anxiety. I’m doing some blood tests Monday. However, I’m worried this is something more serious. I don’t fit the typical sleep apnea patient- even the doctor is confused and doubtful. If anything, I’m small, 28, don’t have diabetes or hypertension. I usually have hypotension lol. 

Edit-I had too much caffein last week in one day and that night was the first time it happened (1.5 Celsius, almost 2 coffee cups) . Also when my tachycardia started. So the doctor said it was probably caffein and anxiety. The next day, I was vomiting all day and nauseous- again, they said it was anxiety. My BP was 120/80 when I’m normally 90s/60s. Now, I feel normal other than feeling my heart racing during the day and waking up at night. I also starting taking Optimim Nutrition Mass weight gainer last semester (not every day but I tried) and maybe that changed my blood levels or spiked my glucose overtime idk.

Before marriage, I told him I wanted to buy my own car, and he initially agreed. However, over time, he manipulated my decision, calling it a waste of money and insisting I use his instead. He convinced me to put all my savings into buying a house, which we did, with me covering the majority of the down payment—including taking a huge debt from my brother, as my husband lacked liquid cash.

After marriage, he became extremely calculative and controlling over finances. Despite earning half of what he does, I covered most household expenses (electricity, HOA, groceries, taxes, etc.), while he expected a strict 50-50 split. He even disapproved of small personal expenses like coffee. When shopping, he paid for his clothes, and I paid for mine. I often covered brunches and dinners as well. When I told him I couldn’t afford the mortgage due to my debt, he was furious, leading to frequent fights that drained my confidence and independence.

Emotionally, he is unavailable—I have to beg for affection. I also overheard him and his parents speaking ill of me, with him actively participating. During arguments, he storms off in his car, leaving me feeling unheard. Despite this, I’ve supported him unconditionally, including after his recent male infertility diagnosis, which led us to IVF. I never questioned his finances, but he constantly demanded to see mine.

Financially, he manipulates me—he invested our tax return in his own stocks and racks up $4,000 in credit card expenses, expecting me to pay. Every time I trust him, I feel pushed further into financial insecurity.

1j13ibg,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Mysterious_Lynx_9300/comments/1j13ibg/a_dream_from_last_night/,A dream from last night,"I had a dream last night.  
  
In this dream, I had moved to the city. There, I was living with one of my favorite professors from my second university and his daughter, though I never met his kids in real life. There was a feeling that something bad had happened to my family, I'm not sure what, but such that he and his daughter were something like an adopted family. An adopted father and a new sister. She was a musician, excited about a vintage promotional poster for an amplifier, possibly fender. Her room was decorated much the same way. The professor was kind and thoughtful like in real life, but very particular about privacy and silence. I had intruded upon it once and understanding his irritation, I made a lengthy apology, which we both laughed at, disturbing his silence further. While he isn't in real life, in the dream he was a musician like his daughter, both playing violin and other stringed, orchestral instruments. I saw him in my minds eye playing a cello or a double-bass and thought it was quite fitting for him. There was a stairway up to their kitchen done mostly in black-and-white, where I misplaced some pens and pencils from across the house. The pencil holder in the kitchen was full so I awkwardly left them scattered on the breakfast table.  
  
In the city there were tall footbridges across a wide river and I walked across one of them. I stopped in to a library which was handing out flyers. The flyers were some mix of promotional material and warning patrons that 'witches were on the rise,' or some sort. I debated with someone at the library about whether they were calling themselves witches or not, and asked what exactly they had done. This someone scoffed and waved off my argument. 
  
I continued on to an outdoor cafe on this clear day. There, my adopted sister was playing an old violin with worn strings. She was reading sheet music off of her cell-phone. She was sitting on the table where some other people I had known from university were sitting around it. The violin was so quiet, even from just a few feet away. ""That's because it hasn't got frets,"" one of my male friends said, sitting to my left. I laughed, saying that that didn't have anything to do with its loudness but its frequency. But they kept arguing, and I got excited in that debate-freshman way, that I was about to explain something I knew very well. ""Violins are often quiet, which is why you almost always see them with microphones attached,"" I continued to explain. The guy arguing about the violin was someone I had tutored before, and the others around the table reminded me of people I had once met who played music in the street.
  
I wandered off on the city streets, which had hills and vistas of forests in the distance. There was another bridge I came to, where someone was being interviewed about marijuana, ""pot,"" and their usage of it. I was carrying a satchel that was like a jansport backpack torn to shreds with only one strap, and a pillow held like a boombox to my ear. I must have been in pyjamas, though I don't know what I was wearing. I may have been naked but if so, it didn't register in any fashion. I approached this girl being interviewed because I wanted to ask her if she had any marijuana to spare. I was going to joke with her that I had been sober for far too long. Before I could ask, someone else crossed the street trying to get a picture with the pot-smoker. ""I can take your picture,"" I offered, ""I'd be glad to."" I took the strangers cell phone and aligned the picture, of them on the bridge with the view behind them..  
  
Before I could take it, someone stepped right into the frame, expertly photo-bombing the shot. The lens went out-of-focus and the button on the cell screen to take the photo disappeared. I laughed and said, ""hey buddy..."" and looking up, It was you.  
  
You looked at me and said ""hey,"" and then you fell into my arms.  
  
Your hair was black and strawberry blonde, as if you hadn't dyed it in a while, though neither was your true hair color. The pillow and the satchel fell to the ground, the cell-phone I had borrowed was forgotten. It was you. Your face, your smile, your giggle. Your make-up was subdued, expert but not flashy. You were so vivid. My heart was pounding and my breath was short. I pulled you so close to me, for such a long time as to make the hug a little awkward in the middle of the street. ""I've been smoking too much,"" I confessed, even though I had quit again but the damage to my lungs remained. ""I can barely breathe."" You were almost as tall as me in your high leather-boot heels. You were warm and I could feel your back, your shoulders. Eventually we pulled away. ""What are you doing here?"" I asked.  
  
""You've been played like a fiddle,"" you said jokingly. ""You've fallen into my machinations, every step leading you here."" 
  
""Everything?"" I asked. ""The cafe, the bridge, the library?""  
  
""Just the library actually,"" you said. So the flyer about witches had something to do with you, I pieced together. You had your hands in your jacket pockets, looking adorable and swinging a leg.  
  
""I pulled on your strings and - you - danced!"" You leaned forward to give emphasis to the last word, laughing maniacally, not missing a beat. The top under your jacket was low-cut.  
  
""Well,"" I said. ""Now that you have me exactly where you want me... what's next?""  
  
And the dream ended. The pillow jumped up from the street and landed back on my shoulder, pressed to my ear, and then it was my real pillow. I got dressed and put on a pot of coffee and replayed the dream in my head over and over so I wouldn't forget, typing it out as fast as I am able.  
  
And while the dream felt incomplete, as many dreams do, I wasn't sad about it. It was beautiful to see you again so vividly, even if I didn't score any free dream weed, and even if I didn't totally understand my imaginary foster family, or ever figure out what city I was in. It was some cross between my hometown, Amsterdam, San Francisco and England, which makes it with almost certainty an imaginary place.  
  
It was great to see you again.

I will update this thread constantly and feel free to ask me for further info.

1. Futian bonded area
Pros: Few people during weekends, nice environment, perfect for cycling and jogging
Cons: Don’t go there during weekdays. Can be boring cuz there’s literally 0 places for food and only with few overpriced coffee shops.

2. Shekou Binhai Park
Pros: Many great restaurants nearby, the best bagel/pizza around the town. Nice scenery (kinda?)
Cons: The sea smells bad.

3. OCT area (in Nanshan district, don’t get confused with the one in the east)
Pros: Very much gentrified but in a good way. Good gigs, good foods and good memories for me personally :)
Cons: Can be a little bit expensive but I always consider this place a great place to spend your Sunday.

Let's call my girlfriend E and her friend C. On this trip I felt me and C were becoming buddylike on this trip (joking around, offering life advice for problems she was having, ordered pizzas for everyone and got C a separate one with special requests, got coffees for C and E, hanging out one on one for like half a day, etc..) which I viewed as a overall positive for my relationship with E. E enjoyed that I was getting along with C and going out of my way to accommodate C. So one night on the trip, at my E's request, I parted from the group to go to a dispensary with a friend of the group to get marijuana for E and I. She had requested ""something light"" from the dispensary. Me and the group friend agreed that something light sounded like a couple of joints, so I purchased those and returned to the hotel lobby. The friend of the group told me to go get E, just E as C doesn't smoke and says the smell makes her sick, I go to the room and tell E I got the joints and she should come down for a smoke. She said she didn't mean joints she wanted edibles because C would get sick at the smell so she would pass on the smoke, I told her that we could smoke them on a long walk and spray ourselves with fragrances to so we wouldn't smell of it, E responded no again, at which point I responded if you really don't want to that's fine but we could always change clothes after the smoke because afterall it was her that sent me to the dispensary I assumed she wanted to get high. (for context the dude that the bestfriend likes has been leading her on and she was overstimulated, I'm autistic and have a hard time reading the room as well.) At which point C steps in screaming ""SHE SAID NO ASSHOLE"" I said not to speak to me like that, she responded ""I'LL SPEAK TO YOU HOWEVER I WANT TO"" I said that I had been nothing but nice to you this weekend so do not speak to me in this disrespectful way, she was offended I called her disrespectful and yelled some more about this, I tried to respond and she just kept telling me to shut up and stop talking. I saw she was upset so I made sure to speak calmly and with non aggressive body language, but at this point I was upset I had been yelled at and felt disrespected so I didn't want to just shut up and take it on the chin and get yelled at by someone I barely knew. But the more I tried to talk to her saying things like we're friends we shouldn't be talking to each other like this, she just got more upset until she stormed out of the room. I know I should've walked away from the situation, but I had felt disrespected by the yelling and name-calling and felt it had to be addressed. E told me I was in the right but should've walked away from the situation sooner. I feel terrible that she was in the middle of that. E kept saying things to me ""you have to understand my friend is a few years younger and might react differently than you or I"" my girlfriend eended up drinking that night to help cope, and I feel terrible. For E and to help get the trip back on track, I apologized to C for not walking away from the situation or recognizing that she was already dealing with things prior to me walking in the room. C seemed to in a better mood after this. I felt like I was really trying to be friends with C and don't really understand what happened. Am I the asshole? ",2,1740846902.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

...cafeteria to try their breakfast burrito.

EDIT: Apologies for the janky formatting on mobile. This is best viewed on desktop.

**Goal**  
I hope you'll use this as a discovery tool to find your own favorite burrito. If you already love your breakfast burrito ""spot,"" don't let this yuck your yum. Each place appeals to different tastes, budgets, and locations. For those still exploring our city, hopefully this saves you some time and money.

**Criteria**  
Open at roughly 8am, <$10, Locally Owned, Designed for Takeout

**Fun Stats**  
Last month I ate roughly **20lbs** of breakfast burrito and spent **$204** (not including coffee or extras).

**Reviews Based Only On Food Quality**  
There are valid reasons to frequent an establishment besides how good their burritos are. My reviews don't consider business practices, political affiliations, or dietary accommodations.

**How I Ranked**  
For each burrito, I used half to dissect its composition and try each component individually. Then I ate the second half as intended with any provided sauces. After logging measurements, I'd consider whether I enjoyed it more or less than previous burritos, while also factoring in value for the price. My wife served as a second voice of reason - I'd often ask her, ""Did you think this burrito was better than X burrito?"" to help calibrate my rankings.

**Disclaimer: Limited Sampling Bias**  
Most burritos were tried only once - your experience could differ on another day with another cook at another time. These aren't definitive judgments.

**Disclaimer: After Tax Price**  
When receipts didn't itemize costs for multiple items (often coffee), I calculated price by adding 8.05% sales tax to the listed base price.

**Disclaimer: Temperature**  
When I forgot my thermapen in the car, I estimated temperature by assuming 2 degrees of cooling per 5 minutes until I measured at home. (It doesn't actually work like that, but close enough)

\#28 • **Momma Perez Burritos** | Chorizo | $6.45 | 11.48oz | $0.56/oz | 135°F

Someone had to be on the bottom. I'm sorry, this one was plain gross, I had no desire to finish it.

Mediocre tortilla. Eggs were *steamed* like the ones you get in an Egg McMuffin. Cheap tasting cheese. The killer for me was the chorizo mixture. It tasted like an over salted, undercooked can of corned beef hash. Complete mush besides the undercooked hash browns inside.

*""SpottedFlicker, you missed out! I agree on the chorizo, but the (bacon,chicken,pork) burrito is so much better!""*

You are probably right, but I'll be damned if I pay for steamed eggs again.

Best For: People who eat corned beef hash out of the can with a spoon.


\#27 • **Simmer** | Bacon | $5.94 | 6.62oz | $0.90/oz | 122°F

Here, look at [this sad image](https://photos.app.goo.gl/KbEzMJ4eaHfcay648). Look at those stats. This wins awards for smallest burrito, bottom of the barrel price per ounce, and not to mention barely warm.

Least favorite tortilla, tasted like a mission tortilla straight from the store. The surprising thing is the burrito filling is... good? Creamy eggs, nice bacon flavor, deep fried tater tots, cheddar cheese to hold it together. Boring but good. The amount of filling is just comical to the size of the tortilla. I just imagine a chef cooking his heart out only for the manager or front of house staff to meticulously pluck 4 tater tots and dollop 4 tablespoons of filling into a tortilla they just brought in from Safeway. They need to triple the amount of filling or call it a taco and cut the tortilla and price in half.

Best For: People who never leave west Fort Collins.

\#26 • **Genoa Coffee** | Bacon | $10.26 | 14.92oz | $0.69/oz | 135°F

Mediocre tortilla that's been panini pressed. There was some bacon just proportionally not enough. Overloaded with eggs, they weren't bad but became exhausting to eat through. I think they were cooked out of a carton and fluffed up with milk. They weren't even unseasoned, but somehow still a bit bland. Lots of green chiles but they tasted like they came out of a tin. I'm pretty sure the salsa was just Pace salsa out of a can as well. I ended up not finishing this one. For $10 just make yourself one at home.

Best For: People who have never had a proper burrito.

\#25 • **Green Light** | Chorizo | $8.63 | 8.34oz | $1.03/oz | 140°F

Dollar per ounce club. Listen, no breakfast burrito is worth paying $1.03/oz.

It is a tasty burrito. Two weird large chunks of potato. Nice and cheesy. Some egg, but mostly chorizo. I can't really explain it very well, but the chorizo filling tasted like Taco Bell. I was looking around for the sauce packets and was disappointed I didn't have any. It is an okay burrito, but the quality to price ratio of this burrito is insulting.

Best For: People who like overpaying for Taco Bell.

\#24 • **Poudre Valley Hospital** | Bacon | $4.16 | 7.68oz | $0.54/oz | 145°F

If this burrito used to win awards, it certainly isn't anymore. This tastes exactly like a burrito you would eat at a hospital cafeteria. Honestly, not terrible for the price. Basic tortilla, hardly any bacon though. Eggs tasted like they came out of a carton. There was a slight heat. I ended up using Cholula to make it through the other half.

Best For: People stuck at the Hospital who forgot to pack a lunch.

\#23 • **Lucky's Market** | Chorizo | $6.47 | 13.46oz | $0.48 | 130°F

I sort of expected a little better considering the quality of the ingredients sold here (like their house made bacon). Substantial burrito if you happen to be hungry and in the store. Mediocre tortilla. These were actually the only eggs I had that were overcooked - rubbery and sort of gritty. Very cheesy but not very moist. Really uneven distribution, one side had mostly hash browns and one side egg. Oh, and the hash browns weren't even browned. Desperately needed hot sauce or salsa to go along with it. Pretty lackluster burrito, but at least not greedily priced.

Best For: Unfussy Lucky's Patrons

\#22 • **Mugs Old Town** | Bacon | $7.56 | 11.70oz | $0.65 | 130°F

Weird burrito. I feel like it doesn't belong this low, but I also liked every burrito higher on this list better. Good cheese and green chile coverage and acceptable egg and bacon portions. The uncooked onions don't really belong in this one. I think the bacon is what weirded me out. Very artificial smelling, like taking a whiff of a freshly opened bag of store brand bacon bits. The faint fake smoky smell permeates every bite of the burrito.

Best For: People who huff bags of bacon crumbles.

Upgrade Pick: The Neighbor or The Crooked Cup

\#21 • **Mas Fuegos** | Chorizo | $5.94 | 8.24oz | $0.72 | 145°F

This is the sister restaurant of Simmer. Apparently this is the sister who has her shit together. Pretty good. Nice hot burrito. Cheesy filling. Good portions. This one falls a little flat on the tortilla quality and the potatoes being a bit large and dry. I think La Luz does the same burrito a bit better for the same price. Simmer should just sell the burritos from this place.

Best For: People who never leave southeast Fort Collins.

Upgrade Pick: La Luz Mexican Grill

\#20 • **Doug's Diner (Sat/Sun)** | Chorizo | $8.70 | 12.66oz | $0.69 | 145°F

🏆 *Best Hash Browns*

Classic diner burrito. Typical tortilla. Hash browns were nicely cooked and evenly browned. Fluffy eggs, likely from a carton. I enjoyed the house made chorizo, it was more like chorizo spiced breakfast sausage. I really liked the gravy style green chile. Comes with a free diner style coffee. It is overwhelmingly hash browns. Like taking a bite out of a tortilla wrapped potato.

Best For: Hash brown lovers.

\#19 • **Matador Mexican Grill** | Chorizo | $7.82 | 8.28oz | $0.94 | 120°F

🏆 *Best Sauce Selection*

Let's have a chat. Matador's breakfast burritos are mediocre.

Most of the issues stem from it being a BYO spot where the ingredients sit out. The tortilla is average. The eggs and potatoes are seasoned well but dry by the time they make it to your vessel. The shredded cheese covered in cornstarch doesn't melt well. It is a mediocre, slightly cold, slightly too expensive, dryish burrito.

*""It's because you suck at building burritos, SpottedFlicker. You didn't get it queso injected with a double shot of honey jalapeno sauce!""*

I thought so too, but then I went back and got it honey-glazed and all and had the exact same experience.

Here are my theories as to why it was community voted best breakfast burrito.

*Theory 1*: South Fort Collins is a void of good ~~breakfast burrito~~ food options. This is the best closest spot for a large portion of the Fort Collins population.

*Theory 2:* The ability to customize it makes it so most people can construct a decent burrito to their preference.

*Theory 3*: This is the only spot on the list that let's you drizzle sugar on your breakfast burrito.

It's likely some combination of all three... or just the last one.

I will say that the fresh salsa's are some of the best I've had in all of Fort Collins even if the sweet sauces aren't my particular preference.

Best For: Sweet and Salty Lovers.

Upgrade Pick: Illegal Pete's

\#18 • **Fox Den** | Egg | $10.26 | 15.24oz | $0.67 | 155°F

Cool spot, but expensive in general. This was the only burrito that had rice on the list. Not a great tortilla. The rice and bean mix was nicely spiced and moist throughout. Not a lot of egg. This was clearly designed to be vegetarian or vegan. It's a very large burrito which could use some salsa or hot sauce to break the monotony of it.

Best For: Rice and Bean Lovers

\#17 • **Rainbow Restaurant** | Bacon | $7.56 | 14.94oz | $0.51 | 160°F

This is less a breakfast burrito and more a potato wrapped in a tortilla. It costs 50 cents more to get the bacon version, which you should probably just skip since the bacon is barely noticeable against the boldly flavored breakfast hash. It really comes down to how much you like this hash. They call the red coating ""salsa"" but its more a acidic spiced tomato-paste concoction than salsa. There are some uncooked onions which are a little odd texture wise. I think the hash is good, but eating 15oz becomes a chore. There was little if any egg in this as well.

I think this is an incredible deal if you are vegetarian and can get the CSU student/staff discount. It's also incredibly filling for the price, you won't likely want to eat again til dinner.

Best For: Vegetarian CSU Students

\#16 • **Consuelo's Express** | Chorizo | $3.75 | 9.70oz | $0.39 | 125°F

🏆 *Lowest Price*

This is the ranking I'm most uncertain about. I could be easily convinced to change it. Based on price alone it really should go higher. On burrito quality it could easily go lower. I think the existence of La Casita sort of proves that this burrito should stay in this position.

This burrito lives and dies based on your enjoyment of their green chile full stop. Take the green chile away? You have yourself a crappy gas station burrito. Tortilla isn't great. My chorizo was dry and crumbly. Potatoes were slightly dry. It's possible I went on a bad day. The green chile and cheese glue the burrito together to make it enjoyable.

I won't deny it is good value and convenient. A staple for people who enjoy it.

Best For: People who enjoy a good value green chile burrito.

Upgrade Pick: La Casita Mexican Cuisine

\#15 • **La Luz Mexican Grill** | Chorizo | $6.40 | 9.62oz | $0.67 | 135°F

Solid Mexican American burrito. The tortilla was *almost* soggy, but I'll take a moist burrito over a dry one any day. A balanced amount of eggs, chorizo and potatoes. The amount of eggs felt like you were actually eating a breakfast burrito. The only thing holding this back were the slightly dry roasted potatoes. The chorizo was a little boring too. It had a nice melted cheese inside.

Best For: Quality Grab n Go in south Fort Collins

\#14 • **ALMANSITA'S** | Chorizo | $9.08 | 10.78oz | $0.84 | 170°F

🏆 *Sonoran Style Tortilla*

This is placed here solely because of their tortilla. It is really good. It is a Sonoran style tortilla that is thin, papery, and chewy. The chorizo and eggs were freshly skillet cooked and flavorful. It definitely felt like an expensive burrito for what you end up getting. My wife's burrito had fries in it which were pretty dry. Is the tortilla worth the premium pricing of this one? I'm not so sure.

Best For: People who enjoy Sonoran style tortillas.

\#13 • **Taqueria Los Comales** | Chorizo | $8.65 | 11.56oz | $0.75 | 140°F

Another premium priced Mexican American burrito. ALMANSITA'S makes up for it with the tortilla. Taqueria Los Comales makes up for it with their salsa bar. Proportions of eggs, chorizo, and other ingredients were good. The fries and refried beans in this one were a little dry unfortunately. The fact that you can pour their green sauce on every bite of this burrito makes it very good and counteracted the dryness. Still, I don't want to pay a premium price for a dryish burrito.

Best For: Salsa Bar Enthusiasts

Upgrade Pick: Tortillas Las 4 Americas

\#12 • **Tortillas Las 4 Americas** | Chorizo | $6.44 | 12.22oz | $0.53 | 125°F

🏆 *Best Refried Bean Burrito*

This does everything Taqueria Los Comales does, but a little better. The tortilla is great. The pricing feels good. I think the salsas are *really* good. It also suffers the same issue. A dry refried bean potato combo. It does make an excellent vessel for their salsas, but I think burritos should really be able to stand on their own without them.

Best For: People who like refried beans in their burrito.

\#11 • **The Crooked Cup - Old Town** | Chorizo | $7.50 | 10.82oz | $0.69 | 145°F

🏆 *Velveeta Lovers*

This is a pretty unique burrito. The tortilla is meh, but the filling is really good. They fill it with plasticky velveeta queso, the kind that will start solidifying as soon as it gets a whiff of cold air. Comfort food for me, but might turn some people off. The chorizo is also really good. Mine came with two chunky juicy chorizo meatballs that are really great to bite into. Solid coffee here as well.

Best For: Velveeta Lovers

Upgrade Pick: The Neighbor

\#10 • **Tacos El Diablo** | Chorizo | $6.47 | 10.58oz | $0.61 | 145°F

🏆 *Best Meat Packed*

The definition of ""breakfast burrito"" is sort of dubious with these. Technically there is egg and potato. I think 8oz of meat wrapped in a great tortilla for $6.47 is a pretty good deal. I really liked the chorizo, not your typical one, was very fragrant and smelled strongly of clove(?) or some other spice I couldn't quite put my finger on. I really wish the salsas were better. They looked and smelled like applesauce and their primary flavor was heat.

Best For: People who want more meat than potato.

\#9 • **Babalu's** | Chorizo | $5.40 | 6.86oz | $0.79 | 120°F

This burrito is a tightly rolled cheesy flavor bomb. The tortilla is really great. The filling is outstanding. It doesn't eat like your typical breakfast burrito - more like an unfried flauta. My personal complaint is that it costs an extra 50 cents for salsa, if you do pony up, get the hot green one. It's also not served terribly warm. The price seems a little high to me for what it is.

If you are looking for a nice potato heavy burrito - look away.  
If you are looking for a dense protein packed burrito stick - this is for you.

Best For: People who want dense long breakfast burritos.

\#8 • **The Neighbor** | Bacon | $9.18 | 12.68oz | $0.72 | 125°F

🏆 *Best Coffeeshop,* 🏆 *Best Queso*

Two awards!? We're not reviewing coffee, but if I had to choose between Mugs Old Town, The Crooked Cup and The Neighbor, I'm coming back here.

The queso inside this one is really good. The potatoes have their skin on which adds some nice texture inside. It had quality bacon inside, but it wasn't very bacon-y. They serve it with a remoulade sauce that really pairs well with the potatoes inside. A pleasure to eat.

*However,* I actually have a lot of criticisms of this one since its merely inches away from perfection.

\- The potatoes are just slightly too al dente. Cook them a bit more or cut your potatoes more uniformly.  
\- Snugly wrap the foil all the way around and warm it up a bit more.  
\- Ditch your marinara sauce for something else, preferably a sauce with some heat.  
\- Please, please offer a chorizo version.

It is slightly on the more pricey side, so not a grab and go sort of place. But a come chill and hang out awhile joint.

Best For: Good vibes, good coffee, good burrito.

\#7 • **Mountain Avenue Market** | Tofu | $6.47 | 9.86oz | $0.66 | 140°F

🏆 *Best Alternative Burritos,* 🏆 *Best Grocery Burrito*

A textural oasis in a desert of same-y breakfast burritos.

I'm super surprised how much I enjoyed this one. It's better than it has any right to be. I think they rotate the burritos they serve, so the one you get might not be the same as the one I had. However, it takes real craftsmanship to construct a vegan burrito this tasty so I'm pretty confident their other offerings will be just as good.

Tofu was marinated and flavorful. Zucchini was expertly cooked to retain some bite. An interesting flavor profile that remained breakfast-y without any of the classic ingredients. It wasn't as filling as some of the other vegan or vegetarian options, but infinitely more interesting to eat.

Best For: Vegans or people who want to try creative alternatives.

\#6 • **Illegal Pete's (Sat/Sun)** | Chorizo | $8.63 | 15.20oz | $0.57 | 110°F

🏆 *Best BYO*

This is a great weekend deal. Great tortilla and generous portions. You can choose to have either sour cream and cheese or guacamole in your burrito. Comes with green chile and your choice of salsa as well, both of which you can choose to get on the side. The side cups they give are pretty big and generous. I was also accidentally given free queso on the side, but that totally has absolutely no effect on this very professional review. FREE CHIPS. Suffers the typical BYO issue of low temperature. This somehow manages to not be as dry as the Matador burritos.

Best For: People who enjoy building their perfect weekend hang over cure.

\#5 • **Vatos Tacos + Tequila** | Bacon | $7.16 | 10.64oz | $0.67 | 140°F

🏆 *Best Grab n Go*

This is the most carefully constructed burrito. It has a [beautiful cross section](https://photos.app.goo.gl/YBMk8amzvvVFVGtt8). Whole burrito was evenly heated. Each ingredient in the filling was proportional and perfectly distributed. Rolled into a nice fat roll. They perfected the amount of cheese and green chile sauce. Each bite was moist without being over or under sauced. Every bite was delicious and nearly identical. I didn't care for the slightly al dente hash browns even if they provided some good contrasting texture. It is a smidge overpriced. Whoever's hands puts these bad boys together deserves a raise though.

Best For: People who appreciate the hands of an expert burrito craftsman.

\#4 • **Las Delicias** | Chorizo | $9.71 | 14.62oz | $0.66 | 145°F

This is the best classic Mexican American burrito. Quality tortilla. Quality chorizo. Quality salsa. Quality eggs. I would say this one is fairly worthy of its price premium. I think the reason it isn't ranked higher is it doesn't stand out in any particular way. Each ingredient is quality on its own and comes together for a solid burrito.

Best For: People who enjoy an authentic Mexican American burrito.

\#3 • **Cafe Mexicali** | Chorizo | $6.69 | 13.92oz | $0.48 | 130°F

🏆 *Best Tortilla*

If a fresh tortilla is your most important criteria than Cafe Mexicali is likely your number one. I don't know if they are always this good, but the tortilla was phenomenal. Very similar in style to a fresh baked roti. They build the burrito in front of you similar to a BYO place, but have solved the issues that come along with it. The typically dry BYO potatoes are steamed red potatoes mixed with scrambled eggs, both of which were moist. When they heat their burritos they go through a timed belt so they aren't taken out too early. Melty cheese and your choice of salsa seals the deal.

This is the best option for us suburbia folks who don't live downtown. I will continue to badmouth their sweet pork, however when it comes to their breakfast burritos nothing but affection will part these lips henceforth.

Best For: People who love fresh tortillas.

🏆 *Best Fries*

Finally. I was nearly losing my mind, french fries do belong in breakfast burritos! Looking at you Almansita's and Los Comales.

However, just like how its best to eat Chick-Fil-A waffle fries immediately in the car after leaving the drive thru, you need to eat this right away too.

This is amazing, so greasy, so good. The tortilla is good. The chorizo is top notch. The crispy fried egg layered between the fries. Incredible. Then comes the green sauce. Oh man. I'd say plan on bringing a friend to split this with unless you want to explain to your doctor your elevated cholesterol levels. I think my only con would be that there is slightly too many fries. I'd also ask for an extra green sauce.

Best For: People willing to give up a portion of their lifespan for breakfast.

\#1 • **La Casita Mexican Cuisine** | Chorizo | \*$4.59/$4.05 | 11.70oz | \*$0.39/0.32 | 150°F

🏆 *Best Overall*

This one embodies the spirit of the breakfast burrito. Cheap. Delicious. Filling.

Y'all, it's not even close. \*They were even forced to raise their prices this month from $3.75 to $4.25. Thanks, Obama. Still doesn't matter.

Price to delicious ratio just flat out beats everyone else.

I'm actually baffled though. How is their cheese & green chile done so much better than everyone else's. Is everyone allergic to putting melty cheese in their burrito? At $3.75 It's obviously not a cost cutting measure. Better to not know, the mystery makes it taste better.

You can also get a crispy deep fried Chile Relleno put in the center for an extra $4.  
Is it good for your wallet? No.  
Is it good for your soul? Absolutely.

**Conclusion**  
I mostly did this for my own amusement and as a desperate attempt to impress my spouse.  However, the gas produced by 28 days of continuous burrito eating has left our relationship on tumultuous terms. It's time to heal and move on. Thanks for reading.",227,1740846729.0,FortCollins,47,0.97,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j13cv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskVet/comments/1j13cv8/foster_cat_has_weird_poop_with_blood_spots/,Foster cat has weird poop with blood spots,"Heya! I've been fostering a 4 year old manx cat from the shelter for the last six weeks. He had been at the shelter for 3.5 years and has a lot of (emotional) trauma. He's finally at the point where he will come out of his box in the cat tree for pets, but won't leave the tree unless we're gone or sleeping. 

Today, while cleaning the litter box, there was a poop on top (uncovered) that looked odd. There's the turd shape that's normal cat poop looking, but there was mucus looking poop all around it that's a lighter color (coffee with cream colored). In the lighter colored poop, there are what looks like small spots of blood in it. I'm worried that it's something serious. I know he doesn't eat often and yesterday his stomach was making noises after he ate. But, with his trauma, I really don't want to force a vet visit if I don't have to. He will only leave the cat tower for food and going to the bathroom. 


Species: feline
Age: 4
Sex: male, neutered 
Breed: Manx-long hair
Body weight: 10-ish pounds
History: unknown. Shelter cat who has only had required vaccines.
Clinic signs: he's hiding in the cat tower, which is normal for him. He doesn't seem to be acting different, but hard to tell with his previous trauma. He's had a bit of a runny nose since I brought him home. I've noticed that he often drops food while eating (possible dental issues) and eats his food whole. 
His current diet is a mix of Science Diet indoor and Blue Buffolo sensitive stomach. He gets an ounce of fancy feast in the mornings and sometimes 1-2 Churus at night (about every other night).

Is this something that I required a trip to the emergency vet/urgent care? He doesn't have an established vet, but there is a vet clinic the shelter uses. Can I wait for a normal appointment? I just want what's best for the little dude. He's making progress and don't want to re-traumatize unless needed.",1,1740846594.0,AskVet,1,1.0,False
1j13cv3,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1j13cv3/the_love_month_is_over_again_just_venting/,"The love month is over, again. Just venting","Woa, already March, huh?! 
I hoped he (29MLL) would pick up on the hints and do something. I even mentioned and still did nothing for me, for us (28FHL).
We had Valentine's day. Nothing. Then we had another VDay (our country's own VDay) 10 days later. Still nothing.
In my country the love month continues with the celebration of the first day of spring which consists of gifting some symbols, flowers, chocolate to the women you appreciate. It's 6 p.m. and it's clear there is no intention of anything. Next Saturday it's National Women Day. On that weekend he is away to his parents place so definitely nothing will happen.

I hate it. I just hate it all. I hate he does not make this effort. First of all, let me tell you that we had all the conversations, he knows about how I hate that we have this DB which has been hoing on for almost 4 yrs. He knows Im a sucker for physical love or any kind of romantic manifestation of feelings as long as they are expressed constanly. But he just does not get it. He claims he is more affectionate but if you add 2 more hugs per month that's not called ""being more affectionate"". He complains everyday of certain types of pains which, honeslty, Im fed of hearing unless he goes to a doctor...which he never does.  
I have clarified with him last year, two years ago, 3 years ago and so on on different occasions. If he is not the most expressing affection type, then he must do it on the days that I dedicated for celebration of love. But did he do it? Noooo.

On Vday evening he left at his parents' place cause it's been a while since he last saw them. On our own Vday, he did absolutely nothing, worked from home then played games all evening. 
Today it's 1st of March, he did nothing. He made no effort. Nothing at all. I have clarified for hundreds of times in the past that I dont need expensive gifts. He could just go and buy some flowers from the flowershop at the end of street. He could buy some nice chocolate. He could cook a special dinner, not even something complicated, but he could make a carbonara or any other fast fine dish he knows very well to prepare. He could have bought a bottle of wine. He could have planned for us to watch a nice movie in regards to the what's supposed to be the celebration of love. He could have woken up before me and make me a coffee and pancake or a sandwich.  He could have gone to my fav coffee shop (2 mins drive away) and bought my fav coffee. He could have tried to act more romantic. Hell, he could have done the cleaning or at least some part of the cleaning in the house, for God's sake. 

But nothing. And I have pointed out that ""hey, Vday this week, when are you gonna ask me to be your Valentine?"". Or on our own Vday I also did the same. But no, why would he? He admitted the next week after Vday fever passed that he thought about buying a bouquet of roses but when he saw the traffic and also saw how much it costed, he changed his mind. What the heck?! It's not like he does not make 3×times more money than I do (and my salary is very decent)?
 On Vday I decided to order some cookies since it has been a few months since I have last ate sugar as I have decided to cut it down with unhealthy foods. Then on our own VDay, when I saw the sun was about to set, I decided to order some specia take out order. I dropped the line again that evening ""you did not ask me to be your Valentine today too"". He just laughed as he thought I was joking. 

I told him I was serious. He just proceeded to eat. 
Today, as it's Saturday, he woke up late, had a figth with me over some silly stuff. Wacthed 2 episodes of an anime with me and that was all. He is on his laptop ever since then. 

3 and 4 years ago he gifted me some golden earrings which I still consider too much of a gift for this occassion. I always told him that I dont need him to spend money on expensive jewelry. 
I am the kind of person who loves seeing you put the effort into doing something for me. That's why sex and expressing love more often is quite a big deal for me. Because, heck, you do sth in order to show it, right? The efforts mean a lot to me but he is the laziest he can get. And then he gets scared when he sees im not in a good mood for days and wonders what can he do to put me in a good mood. Well, I told you, you stupid man, many times what I want from you but you do ZERO of what I ask.

Then he pouts I dont wanna play DOS2 with him. Well, consider that a payback for not f***ing me for almost 4 years and for not doing what I have expressed for thousands of times he needs to do. I literally told him in his face. I even wrote a note in his phone. He never opened it. 
And yet, he claims spending time together on tiktok watching 30+ shitty videos or talking for a few minutes about some profound topic makes him feel so happy and inlove. That this is, for him, ""our special time""

Well what about me, huh? What about me? I dont feel happy and inlove, no. Fuck brains and morals and common dreams and wishes and knowledge, I think I would have been happier with a dumb d*ck who would have f***ed me every week, who would have kissed me and hugged me every day, who would not have forgotten what a passionate kiss feels like, who would have helped cleaning the house more often, cooked for me, went for walks with me, hugged me, carressed me, or at least would have tried to make me feel special.",0,1740846594.0,DeadBedrooms,1,0.5,False

1j13apc,https://i.redd.it/6i4dq029u3me1.jpeg,Should we get her evaluated?,"My daughter is 3.5 years old. I’ll describe some of what I have seen. 

She talks incredibly well for her age. She memorizes her books too. She taught herself how to start reading letters and numbers and can count to like 40. She picks up new words and phrases everyday some I don’t even know where they came from. She is relatively social with other kids. But even though she is social she still usually does her own thing. 

She likes to line her baby dolls up in her bed to put them down for a nap, or care for them like I do with our baby like rock them or pretend to feed them. She likes to “make” me food or coffee. She is always is aware this play is pretend though. She is incredibly smart and observant. For example, I had someone over the other day who sat her on the counter to make coffee in my keurig. The next morning she pulled a dining chair into the kitchen, lined it up with our dishwasher (it’s moveable and on wheels), climbed onto the dishwasher, onto the counter, put a pod in the keurig, and was going to try to make me coffee. I walked in right before she closed the keurig on the pod. This happened in a matter of one or two minutes. 

Sometimes she lines up her toys. She is very much in her own world. But when she wants your attention, or asks a question for example, she will repeat the same thing over and over until you respond to her or play with her or give her what she asks for. She loves her routines. For example at nap time, she picks out a book and I read it. She always is the one to turn off the light I always put the book away. She goes “you get the book I get the light” every time. She would get upset if we deviated from the routine. We lay down together, she asked for the same 3 songs from frozen to listen to before bed. Sometimes I can get away with just one. When I pull up and play the song, she always asks to look at screen and hold the phone. Always. 

A new thing I’ve noticed the past 3-6 months is she likes to play out scenes from a movie or show. She picks up phrases and ways to play from them too. She will ask me to be one person from the scene, and she will be the other. Or the same if we are listening to a song with two people. I also notice when she is surprised or overwhelmed she waves her hands both at the same time in the same way.

1j13a7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1j13a7w/my_f24_married_gaming_buddy_m22_is_pissed_off/,My (F24) married gaming buddy (M22) is pissed off that I’m interested in his friend + his wife has always hated me,"TLDR: My (F24) married gaming buddy (M22) with 3 kids is pissed off because I am romantically interested in his best friend (M23). Additionally, he has a bipolar wife that harasses me through various platforms and profiles.

So this is not the end of the world, but it does piss me off as I have not really done anything to cause this situation: hence venting out of frustration and the whole illogicality of the situation.

Background:
I’ve been in the same clan for 5 years and at times I have been the co-leader. 2 years ago two guys (M22 and M23) picked up the game and joined our clan, which we promote as a helpful/low threshold community. It is exactly the altruistic and friendly atmosphere, which has made me stick, even at times when I can’t play much. 

Initially I didn’t interact with them much, but I got to know them through weekly group events. July 2023 we had a clan get together for everyone who could make it IRL and I met both of them there. Let’s call the married guy Alex and the single friend John. I got along super well with them, I had the most fun I’ve had in years, just talked about specific raids and fails and such. It was also the first time we discussed anything personal. Alex told me he is married and has 3 kids. He is unemployed because of anxiety, which is why he smokes weed and plays most of the day. I don’t judge, but it doesn’t sound like a fun life imo. John on the other hand is a mechanic, single, lives alone, works out most days, doesn’t drink or do drugs: which is exactly the same way as I am. Both of us have been single for a few years and are not interested in situationships. 

I gave John my snap and last year we have met a few times for a coffee. Somehow Alex always tags along. However, we live far away from each other and although we engage in innocent flirting, we expressed not progressing as neither want a long-distance relationship. Since the coffee “dates” Alex has become more irritable every time we play as a group. Sometimes he intentionally lies to John saying I’m not online (I play offline but clan member can see me). Additionally, Alex’s wife has started messaging me through her own profile, his profiles and fake profiles. Occasionally she screams in the background asking if he is playing with me. 

I’ve told her this is unnecessary drama I am not interested in your HUSBAND and the FATHER of your kids. I said I am however interested in his best friend. I have never spent alone time with Alex nor will I, as I don’t think married/in relationship should hang out one on one with the opposite sex, unless they’re say, mutual friend or long-time friends or something. Nevertheless, she has kept harassing me and calling me names. Other clan members want him out because of her behaviour. John though is a happy go lucky guy and said (jokingly) she will shut up once we marry. 

It so happens that John is moving only an hour away from me in 3 months. He said he hates to be obnoxious but could I possibly reserve a date for him and perhaps “wait for him”. I thought that was incredibly cute and I said of course. I rarely play anymore as I just started doing my PhD in October and I spend long hours at a lab or I am just tired after gym. I only login Friday/Saturday evenings.

They are still best friends but I feel that they won’t be once he moves as John doesn’t really like either of their behaviour. He told me she has bipolar, which adds to Alex’s misery as she is very jealous and paranoid. I just wish we could all get along as I don’t see an issue here: I’m pursuing a single man.

Anyway. Had to get this off my chest as their crazy behaviour is making me want to login less and it is my only quality time with John at the moment until he will move. He has asked not to kick Alex out of the clan as “he doesn’t have much going for him”. I get that, but hey, I was there first.

This is all frivolous I get it, but it does piss me off regardless.

1j139lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1j139lg/what_software_do_you_use/,What software do you use?,"Hey everyone,

I run a small coffee shop in Denver Colorado  and currently use Google Sheets to track my inventory, updating it daily. It works, but it’s getting too time-consuming—I don’t have time to keep building and managing complicated spreadsheets.

I’d love to find an inventory system where I can just type in what I need in plain language, and it organizes everything for me automatically. For example, I want to be able to open the software and just type:

“Make me a spreadsheet for all my coffee bean inventory, organized by type of coffee bean, amount in pounds, cost per pound, total cost, and the date I received them.”

And then have the system generate a clean, structured tracking sheet without me having to manually set up columns, formulas, and formatting.

Does anything like this exist? Or is everyone just stuck piecing together different software tools?

1j138ms,https://www.instagram.com/share/reel/BAAqkKZmRY,Putting myself out there more and the complicated feelings that come with it,"Towards the end of December, the linked reel popped up on my explore page and I decided to try applying it to my life. I've always assumed people have no interest in me and find my annoying. I've always waited to speak or engage until spoken to or engaged with.

Over the last few months, I've forced myself to start conversations and reach out to people I want to maintain a good relationship with. This has primarily been at work, but also a good bit in my classes as well. It has actually gone amazing.

I've started asking people about their day, their weekend, something specific they mentioned a while back then continued a conversation off of that. I reached out to someone I look up to at work to ask for advice on something and she was really sweet and helpful. I found out someone I interned with at my job was coming back and I texted her my congratulations + an invite to grab coffee. She seemed happy I reached out and also wanted to catch up.

I've yet to have a negative experience and it's really boosted my confidence. With that, however, I've also realized how much harder this stuff is for us autistics. Every text message, every greeting, every invitation is so painstakingly crafted. Following up is even worse. I have no idea how to approach things at all. I feel so awkward all the time. I wish this was something that came naturally. I'd probably have a lot more friends lol. The positive results definitely have me feeling better though. I'm less afraid of rejection or bad outcomes, now it's just the struggle of figuring out the right way to reach out and pushing through a really uncomfortable moment.

That's all. I was just feeling happy about the realization and confirmation people are genuinely interested in knowing me and being around me. But also sad at how damn hard it always will be for me to maintain that.",2,1740846293.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

My biggest frustration right now is I can't seem to pass any of this through completely. When I do it feels like I'm shitting concrete. I've tried decaf coffee, drinking more water, and a tablespoon of olive oil mixed with apple cider vinegar. No luck so far. This has been about a week of constipation. It's starting to make the nausea worse, and it's not making eating any easier. Sorry about how gross this topic is but I'm at a point where I don't care about embarrassment if it means I can take a normal dump and get some relief. 
Before you say prune juice, I tried it and vomited immediately. The smell made me gag and the taste is abhorrent right now. If anyone has other suggestions, please help 😭",2,1740846113.0,firsttimemom,3,1.0,False

Idk what to do,"Here's the context: I am really into a guy in my college program. We are the same age. We met when I was interviewing for the program, and I haven't been able to stop thinking about him since.

First of all, we have \*a lot\* of shared interests. We care about the same causes, like the same type of music, and even read the news from the same sources. Whenever we talk 1:1, we talk for hours and hours non-stop and it's effortless to have a good conversation with him. Secondly, he's also really cute and attractive, which doesn't help. Like whenever he smiles I get butterflies on my stomach... he's so my type.

I know he's openly gay but we have never talked about it directly. I tried flirting with him over text and called him good-looking and cute in-person but he never seems to react to it. It's like he has ""turned off"" the gay part of his life... I talked to his other friends about this and they both said he rarely talks about guy, although he said he wants a boyfriend once. One friend said she thinks he has only seen me platonically so far.

So anyway, I don't know what to do next. I'm scared that if I tell him directly that I'm into him and ask him on a real date (we went out just us for coffee before, I think he saw it as purely platonic), he's gonna reject me and things are gonna be weird in my college program (we're all really close). I don't want to make things weird between us but it's just been so goddamn hard to find a real connection with someone I am so attracted to. I can't stop thinking about him and I whenever I watch a romantic movie or see a gay couple online I'm immediately convinced I should give this a try because this doesn't happen often...

TL;DR I'm into a guy in my college program, we're good friends and have a great connection, but I don't know if pursuing him romantically is worth it bc he might reject me and our social group would be weird after",1,1740846094.0,askgaybros,1,1.0,False

I wanted to share app I built after rereading *Slaughterhouse-Five* and stumbling on Vonnegut’s advice: **“I urge you to please notice when you are happy.”**

**Magizh** is a simple, ad-free app to help you pause and cherish those fleeting moments of joy (like a perfect cup of coffee, a quiet sunset, or a good book). No frills, no social media—just a private space to reflect on life’s little wins. Supports quick entry with Siri Integration, Widget and Apple Watch Companion app.

**I’d love your honest thoughts:** Does this resonate with how you interpret Vonnegut’s view of happiness?

1j133cd,https://i.redd.it/9bdcq26ns3me1.jpeg,Gonna see how this goes- lunch,"I have been craaaaaving grits for about 2 months now but holding off because they seem like such a simple carb. I made exactly one serving here with 34 g carbs, paired with 3 slices of turkey bacon, one egg cooked in salsa, and 1/2 of a mini avocado. Plenty of butter there as well. 

Served with iced coffee mixed with part of a vanilla fairlife protein shake.. 

Mostly it's just my fasting that gets bad but now I'm on nighttime insulin so it's under control. However, if I ""cheat"" at all, as in deviate from the few safe carbs I have found, sometimes I am surprised by a spike or an almost-spike despite being within the limit for that meal. Now, being in my 35th week, I am seeing this more and more, especially at dinnertime.

Wish me luck, lol. I will report back in an hour and see if all of those proteins and fats help offset the carbs",11,1740845902.0,GestationalDiabetes,3,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

This is arguably one of the best picks on the board today, friends. The 76ers have lost a mountain of consecutive games at this point, and the Warriors have been playing excellent basketball. To boot, Steph Curry has been seemingly unstoppable – I can’t imagine a universe where Philadelphia contends with the Golden State right now. The Warriors have won and covered the spread in their last 5 straight outings – the Sixers have lost 11 of their last 12 games. In short: These teams are just trending in two totally different directions, betting fam. Give me the Warriors to cover.

1j132n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee/comments/1j132n9/a_little_pet_peeve_i_have_in_this_game/,A little pet peeve I have in this game,"In general, my pet peeve in this game is time.

Like for one in this game why does it take like 15-45 mins to make coffee? I'd understand pizza for GPGP but it doesn't make sense for GCGC to follow the same duration, especially if you're just preparing americanos. I just went to a café earlier while playing this game and ordered a latte and it only took like around 5 mins for them to make my latte. What I could suggest in that area is for the clock to move 5 mins every several seconds instead of the 15 mins from the other game.

Another thing is, although the cafe opens earlier than the pizzeria (8 am which is a little late for a cafe but still a typical time for a cafe to open) I kinda find it weird that I'm still serving coffee so late at night and that there are still many people ordering coffee at that hour, but then again the town in this game is filled with caffeine addicts and some of them definitely do not sleep at night based on some of the customer lines. I initially thought that by purchasing the upgrade for longer days we would start at 7 instead of 8 (because logically there would be more customers if you open the cafe earlier than usual instead of closing much later since coffee is usually drunk in the morning), but what we got is still the same as GPGP where the establishment stays open until 10pm instead of 9pm.

Oh and not to mention the energy mechanic, then again my gripes about that is just the same as everyone else's. I'm still going to play this game anyway. I love doing those latte arts and have finally understood how to steam milk well.",3,1740845851.0,GoodCoffeeGreatCoffee,0,0.71,False

I’m just wondering if there are many stores selling weed in Rotterdam or is it mainly just available in coffee shops? Hoping to take some to smoke on balcony,0,1740845627.0,Rotterdam,12,0.46,False

I’ve only been cycling for about a month, and up until now, I’d always gone out with at least one other person—usually there are three of us riding together. But yesterday I thought, “Why not give it a try on my own?”

I took my mountain bike and did a 12 km loop, which, according to Strava, I finished in about 42 minutes (including multiple pit stops for coffee and snacks at convenience stores). My average speed ended up around 33 km/h, which I’m pretty proud of considering I haven’t been riding long!

What I didn’t plan for was the fact that I had played basketball earlier that day for about 4 hours (2 hours at lunch and another 2 in the evening). Right around the halfway mark of my ride, my left thigh decided it had enough. I caught a nasty cramp while on the highway, so I did my best to signal to the cars behind me and slowly pulled off to the side. Took a quick rest, stretched it out, and luckily was able to keep going.

Overall, it was a challenging but super fun experience. I’m new to riding, so even though it wasn’t the longest or toughest route, finishing it on my own felt like an accomplishment. Any tips on avoiding cramps in the future, or things I can do to improve? Let me know what you think about my ride—how did I do as a beginner? Thanks in advance!",4,1740845619.0,cycling,2,0.84,False
