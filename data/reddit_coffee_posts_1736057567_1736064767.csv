Wednesday’s Scoop (In Case You Missed It)

It was announced last week that former US President, Jimmy Carter, had died at the age of 100. He just so happened to be a big fan of Dylan Thomas, and even made a visit to Swansea in 1995 (but it almost didn't happen).

Read the full story of when Jimmy Carter visited Swansea: [https://www.swanseascoop.com/p/when-president-jimmy-carter-came-to-swansea](https://www.swanseascoop.com/p/when-president-jimmy-carter-came-to-swansea)

1hu18eu,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1hu18eu/this_week_i_uncharacteristically_went_overboard/,This week I uncharacteristically went overboard helping strangers their cat. It helped heal a childhood wound I didn’t realize I’d still been harboring years later. ,"I met some folks on street on Christmas Eve. A strange car was driving slowly by my driveway as my husband and I loaded up side dishes to head to my parents. They rolled down the window and explained that they were looking for their cat — a big long haired black cat. They said he got out when they moved on December 15. He’s an indoor-only cat, and their young daughter misses him so much. They now live 30 minutes away, but they come back to look for him. They ask if I’ve seen this cat. The daughter peers out from her booster seat in the back, enveloped in a shiny pink winter coat. 

I hadn’t seen the cat — “No, but I’ll keep my eye out.” I ask how to let them know if the cat is found. They let me know  a neighbor is watching the neighborhood Facebook group for them.

Days go by. I think of the cat. And I hope the cat is found. When I walk the dogs, I look to the woods, pausing at every rustle. Just a squirrel. When my eyes drift from my monitor in a Zoom call, I find myself scanning the grass for movement. 

And then I spot another black cat — not theirs, short haired — and post it in the Facebook group. My first neighborhood Facebook post. But the neighbor watching the group for posts forwards on my message. The stranger from the street calls me on Thursday anyway. 

I bounce the initial unknown call to voicemail. I read it back. Then listen. I can tell in his voice — he’s sad.  I’m a sucker. I call him, he answers. We talk — and I let him know it isn’t his cat. He expresses all they’ve been doing, and how hard it is to search from afar. 

My mouth works faster than my brain: “I will try to catch your cat. I think I just need a couple of days.” What am I saying? So blasé. But I *do* catch cats sometimes, right? Like, no big deal, I guess. Except it is. 

There there are coyotes and other dangers. Big roads. So many cars driving too fast. I’m scared I won’t catch this cat. It’s entirely possible this cat has already met a bad fate. And I don’t even know this guy’s name. Or the cat’s name. Why am I committing? 

Sure, all of my cats, I plucked off the streets. Sometimes chasing them down. Barehanding a feral cat was no big deal when I was 22 and stupid. 

But I’m older now. I’m afraid of rabies. I’ve had cat scratch fever. And, i’m not fast. However, I have been referred to as a “prolific cat trapper” in the past. But that was many moons ago, back when I did a TNR project for some city community cats by my apartment. 

My one and only project— but I did catch 30+ cats in 72 hours. I got them all transported to be spayed or neutered and then drove them back again. And then I fed them, cared for them, and ensured that when I moved away this summer to the suburbs that they’d still be cared for. I still drive a half hour into the city to drop off bags of food and scratch chins and dispense flea and tick medication. 

And too, I guess, I have a cat-trapping ego complex to wrestle with. Will I be a one-hit wonder? Can my sophomore attempt succeed? I guess I have a track record to preserve. Something to prove. I would go John Wick for my cats — so for that reason mostly, I’ll stand by offering to pull a Taken for your cat too, random stranger man.

From there, it’s on. I’m resolved. I text this unknown number: “Send me a pic of the cat.” I write a search-engine-optimized description in the Facebook group. This is now a code-red all-points bulletin on this damn cat in this neighborhood Facebook group — where I am otherwise not a participant.

I am rather a nonparticipating member of suburban neighborhood life. Sure, I will wave to you. That’s kind of it. Do not expect to see me at the HOA meeting. I’ve got shit to do. Even if I don’t, I will literally do anything else to avoid being there.

But now I’m responding to comments. I’m heart-reacting. I’m requesting and watching footage from people’s cameras. I’m mapping sightings. Some other fellow neighborhood cat lady loans me traps. I go pick them up. She reminds me of the coyotes lurking nearby. She does not have faith. She sends her wishes but has two foster cats upstairs to care for. I depart.

Thursday night: I’m at my desk with a notebook, drawing goddamn cat pathway diagrams. I am thinking like a cat. If I’m an indoor cat who’s outside, what the fuck am I up to? I don’t recognize myself. Who is she, this cat-trapping persona of mine? She is motivated. She’s taking action. She is about that cat life. Little me would want to be her when I grow up. A good sign. But also, not really, because I am an adult with a mortgage and a job. I need to do that job, the one that pays me. But I’m never this motivated to work. Is this… passion?

Then it’s time to strategically place traps. There’s quite the radius to cover, but I have trust in my cat-trapping strategy. My cat-tegy, if you will. I bait the traps with stinky-ass sardines. My gut tells me to place them in a specific spot — blocks from the cats house. Doesn’t make much sense, but I’m going with it. My hands smell like stinky-ass sardines. I want to throw 👏 up 👏. Fuck sardines. I hate sardines.

Now I’m terrified of catching a skunk. What the fuck will I do if I catch a skunk? I will get skunked. Do I hose myself off outside in 20-degree weather? What is the protocol for having a pissed-off skunk stuck in a trap? For entering your house covered in skunk spray? I’ve lived my twenties as a city girl. Now I’m in my thirties and back in the suburbs that brush against the countryside. I am not prepared for this in so many ways. 

I decide not to think of skunks. Or tomato paste. Or frigid hose water and cold, water logged sweatpants. Or of my recent transition out of daily artisanal coffees and takeout to trips to the grocery store and rolling trash bins to the curb and smiling at neighbors (strangers) — for which I was ill prepared, too. 

Better pull the traps in for the night. It’s way too cold to leave a cat stuck in a trap pressed against cold metal bars.

After I wash the sardine smell off my hands, I get into bed. Sleep eludes me momentarily because I hear coyotes yipping too close for comfort. And I still smell sardines.

Now I lay in bed thinking of the cat. And I think of the missing cat’s young person. She doesn’t know where her cat is. I think of the cat’s owners — the girl’s parents — who have to explain all this to their young person. How do you explain it? And now I think of me because I have been this young person with a missing beloved cat. And I had no resolution. Just an empty cold spot on my bed where he used to lie, and years of eyes ever searching for a blob of gray among the trees. And nights of laying in bed with coyotes yipping. The yipping. 

I am determined to change the destiny of this cat. The destiny of this cat’s young person. There can be a better ending. I hope her eyes do not always search. Shut. Up. Coyotes.

Friday: I keep putting my coat on to check traps every two hours. I do not move the traps. I know this is the spot. It has to be. It is freezing. The sardine smell isn’t carrying enough. I trap some wrong cats. Sorry, wrong cats. You got some sardines for your troubles, at least. Be free. Be safe.

Saturday: I have refused to move the traps. I’m delusional, but I’m convinced I will catch this cat blocks from its home and that I know it’s path. Do I believe in some cat-higher-being that is telling me this will work? Who knows what the logic here is. What I do know is: Some serious cold is guaranteed coming. It is not a good time to be a cat outdoors. The earth is hard and cold. The trees are barren. The wind is whipping. The skies are the kind of clear and the stars are shining bright in the way they only seem to do when it’s too damn cold to spend more than that moment admiring them. 

At 10 p.m., I check the traps one last time, expecting to find them empty or to meet my fate of skunkification. I’m still not sure what to do if I get skunked.

Empty. Empty. Empty. And then, a closed trap. Upon approach, a black mass of fur. My heart skips: Did I get the right cat? Maybe; Let’s not be too hasty. There are black floofs galore, I’ve discovered.

I heft the trap into the garage where the space heaters are doing their damndest. Out of the wind, at least. I shine my phone flashlight into this black floof’s face. His pupils are the size of dimes. I’m happy to see him, and I have a wary sense of recognition. I think I know him, from the photo. From the footage.

But the feeling is not mutual. He hates me. Et tu, Brute? Why have I done this to him — lured him in with a ruse of snacks and imprisoned him in a metal confine? An inescapable prison where flight nor fight are effective options. A cat’s personal hell. Alas, I can tell he’s plotting my demise. This is normal cat behavior, though. Murderous glares. I’m used to it. I’m undeterred.

Eying him under scrutiny of my phone flashlight, I notice a dark streak across his seemingly ever-expanding void of a pupil. There’s a wrong, sick bend of light. His right cornea is badly scratched. He looks rough. And he looks sad. He has been silent this whole time. Just staring.

I take pics. I refer back to what was sent to me. I’m not sure it’s a match. My confidence is waning. I text the strangers. I stare at the angry black fluff in the trap. “Have you been lost?” 
The void stares back, silent. Unanswering. 

They come. It takes 30 minutes. I let the strangers into my garage. I’m sweating. Holy fuck, what if I’m wrong? The heartbreak for them. What do I do with the cat? I can’t let him back into the night. But I can’t very well leave him in a cage. 

But they announce, “Cheech!” and drop to their knees. And they coo. And they prod. And they fuss. And now I finally know the cat’s name. He’s Cheech.

Cheech was missing for 20 days. He is a little beat up, but he’s going home. His girl is waiting for him there.

With hate in his eyes, Cheech stared at me as I stood watching him be carried to the car, still secure in the trap. He was telling me he was for the streets. 

But I think not. His place is with the girl. Maybe he wanted to stay in the neighborhood. To finally roam the places he’d smelled and seen through windows. But I am glad to watch him go. And I won’t forget him. I’m thankful he gave me the opportunity to change the story. I did it for her: the little girl from a family of strangers that once were neighbors I never met.

And I can feel a little healing for the little me that lives on. But I know my eyes will always be searching for gray in the trees — even 20 years and 600 miles away from the woods where I first heard the coyotes yipping. But now I can remember it knowing I helped give someone else a different ending. That I put an end to her tear stained pillow nights — at least, when it comes to this.

I contacted the girl, told her and we confronted him. He begged both of us individually of course to take him back. I loved him and couldn't bear the separation anxiety but my morals wouldn't allow me to take back a cheater so I bargained with myself lol and ended up becoming FWB. After a while I heard he got back together with the girl he cheated me on with. I am shit and pathetic for this but I didn't end the FWB arrangement. The thing is his girlfriend was Long distance. Him and I worked at the same place and would hang out all the time. It wasn't just benefits. We would go on food dates, he would buy my gifts and we would stay for hours on calls. He would even bring me gifts and stuff from the way back whenever he flew to his gfs city. This continued for 2 years. When our contract came to an end, I ended things with him citing the fact that since there is no future for us, Its best we end this. It took every once of courage in me to say this to him. I loved him a lot and it killed me to abandon him. When he heard this, he started crying. Confused because I always thought he might have been fwb out of guilt since he loved his gf and thats why chose her over me, I asked what makes him cry over this ending. He told me he isnt happy with his gf  but his family loves her and thats why he cant end things with her. I tried convincing him to let both of us go and start afresh if thats what will make him happy since I genuinely prioritised his happiness over anything. Anyway, he wouldn't make a decision to do smth about it, so I let him go.
Every few months, he d pop a text asking me how I am doing and I d reply back.
One day I ran into him, and we went for coffee n caught up, ended up sleeping together. I told him its not a good idea and let this be the last time we do this. But he said he cant promise and since I loved him anyway, I was taken a back. A few weeks later, I came to know that he and his gf broke up. We continued hanging out and sleeping together. I tried talking to him about committing again and he said okay and to give him some time. But then said he wasn't in the right head space to commit. But he would buy me gifts , food, say stuff like there's no alternative to you, Only you understand me. I ll always be yours but cant say anything abt marriage since I just got out of a relationship. 
I came to know that he tried getting back with his girlfriend and offered to marry her if she got back. She said yes but then he ditched her later because he couldn't let go of me too. 
We were continuing to hangout and sleep until this one random morning he told me how he found out that I flirted with someone from my workplace after I cut contact with him like a year ago and that he never wants too see me again. I tried arguing saying why couldn't he see that I loved him for 6 years and that I entertained him for 6 years. And that even if I did flirt, it doesn't matter because you were with someone else and I was single. And to be honest, I rejected everyone of those coworkers because I couldn't get over my ex. Anyway, we fought it out and made a pact to see him until he leaves the country in a few months. Yesterday, our conversation got a littlr emotionally vulnerable when I asked him why did he do what he did? I jokingly said did he want to marry both of us to which he replied if the society wasn't structured like that he d have done it cause everytime he is with one of us, he misses the other. After this, he got teary eyed said he is fucked and needs to be left alone forever. I couldn't leavr him alone in that state and asked if there's anything I can do to make him feel better to which he said go and make the guy you flirted with feel better and dont ever call/msg me again and blocked me. I got infuriated and was like what the fuck. I had so much anger that I wanted to takr out on him for fucking up my life again. So I forced him to meet me. He verbally abused me saying that I fucked up his mind. And that he left his gf for me but now doesn't even want to look at me because I flirted with my coworker. I said you literally cheated on me to which he said atleast his gf didn't call him a cheater and that he wants to marry someone who will never make him feel disgusting. He said he finds it funny that he even thought about marrying me. Someone who flirts around for attention. I told him he was being selfish and that he was hurting me. To which he said that I fucked him up as much as one could. 
I am so sad and hurt now. Someone that I loved and cared for unconditionally doesn't even admit that I did so for him and thinks I fucked him up.
I know I am not okay emotionally and therefore want a third persons pov on this. What did he get out of all this? Did he do this so he can make peace with himself thinking I am the bad guy? What's the best way I get my revenge on him, block him or leave him on seem forever?

But he would buy me gifts , food, say stuff like there's no alternative to you, Only you understand me. I ll always be yours but cant say anything abt marriage since I just got out of a relationship. 
I came to know that he tried getting back with his girlfriend and offered to marry her if she got back. She said yes but then he ditched her later because he couldn't let go of me too. 
We were continuing to hangout and sleep until this one random morning he told me how he found out that I flirted with someone from my workplace after I cut contact with him like a year ago and that he never wants too see me again. I tried arguing saying why couldn't he see that I loved him for 6 years and that I entertained him for 6 years. And that even if I did flirt, it doesn't matter because you were with someone else and I was single. And to be honest, I rejected everyone of those coworkers because I couldn't get over my ex. Anyway, we fought it out and made a pact to see him until he leaves the country in a few months. Yesterday, our conversation got a littlr emotionally vulnerable when I asked him why did he do what he did? I jokingly said did he want to marry both of us to which he replied if the society wasn't structured like that he d have done it cause everytime he is with one of us, he misses the other. After this, he got teary eyed said he is fucked and needs to be left alone forever. I couldn't leavr him alone in that state and asked if there's anything I can do to make him feel better to which he said go and make the guy you flirted with feel better and dont ever call/msg me again and blocked me. I got infuriated and was like what the fuck. I had so much anger that I wanted to takr out on him for fucking up my life again. So I forced him to meet me. He verbally abused me saying that I fucked up his mind. And that he left his gf for me but now doesn't even want to look at me because I flirted with my coworker. I said you literally cheated on me to which he said atleast his gf didn't call him a cheater and that he wants to marry someone who will never make him feel disgusting. He said he finds it funny that he even thought about marrying me. Someone who flirts around for attention. I told him he was being selfish and that he was hurting me. To which he said that I fucked him up as much as one could. 
I am so sad and hurt now. Someone that I loved and cared for unconditionally doesn't even admit that I did so for him and thinks I fucked him up.
I know I am not okay emotionally and therefore want a third persons pov on this. What did he get out of all this? Did he do this so he can make peace with himself thinking I am the bad guy? What's the best way I get my revenge on him, block him or leave him on seem forever?

My wife aboslutely hate rats and can't stand them, she said that if we don't get rid of them she wont go into the basement ever again.
I found some old rat traps and set them up all around the basement area. They were the old kind that snaps a iron bow over the rats neck once it takes the bait, killing it. 
So a few days go by and we kill some of the rats that have gotten into the basement. 
Yesterday my wife was in the basement taking care of laundry when she started screaming like crazy, I ran down there and asked her what was wrong. Apperantly one of the rats hadn't died as planned. 
She pointed me into a nock where a pretty large rat was trapped, it had grabbed the bait and the metal bow had snapped over its neck but not in fact snapped the neck itself. 
The rat was very badly hurt but still alive, suffering.
It was screaching and clawing all around. My wife was shouting at me to do something so I camly went into the nock and stepped on the metal bow that was pushing on the rats neck. The trap went ""snap"" a second time and the rat was more or less decapitated in half a second.
My wife screamed as if I had done something terrible and ran upstairs. 
When I caught up to her she was very upset and told me that she wanted to take the rat to a vet, that we could have saved it.
I told her that taking a wild rat to a vet would have been illogical, even getting it out of the trap alive would have been a risk to my saftey.
I told her that I understand what she saw was horrible but the animal was suffering.
The point of the rat traps was to kill the rats?!
My wife is now talking about how cold I am and (once again) calling me a sociopath. 
We recently had a situation where I accidently killed a crow and she freaked out on me calling me a sociopath. 

Today she's not talking to me and she slept in the guest bedroom. The only words she has said to me was over morning coffee where she told me that she can still hear the sound of the trap snapping against the concrete floor. I told her that I cleaned the mess the rat trap/rat/me left down there but she just left the table.
Am I the asshole for killing a rat we wanted to kill?

Tldr: I snapped a wild suffering rats neck with my boot and my wife is upset that we didn't take it to the vet instead.",3,1736063079.0,AmItheAsshole,5,1.0,False

My old one broke (white ceramic Hario V60)

I cut one of the filter papers down the middle and used that as a pattern for the shape of the cone

Traced that onto a big copper sheet I bought

Cut it with metal snips, filed the sharp bits off

Carefully bent it into shape around various circular objects in my house -- drink bottle, plastic tube

Then I got a bit of hardwood kept on my balcony, bored a very large hole in it with a handbrace and antique augur bit

Whittled and filed away at the hole to give it an internal angle matching the cone

You rest the cone in the wood and that's that

\--

The above activities were at certain points generating sound

Not sustained

It was all hand tools and done mostly inside with the door closed

Sound travels if it can reach the courtyard

And I felt a lot of paranoia about how perceptible it might be

And then I got very uppity and enraged at all the fucking sound they have made over the years and the near-absence of meaningful control mechanisms being introduced when they ought to have been

So I stopped caring mostly

\--

It seems like certain types of sound carry cultural privelege

You are allowed to entertain on your balcony all day and play music

But the music can't be heavy metal or they will fall on you as a group

Your kid can bang a ball against a wall

A tradesman can bang a hammer at 7am

But no way you could bang a bongo outdoors here, nuh uh

You were allowed to kill someone for being gay or whatever, until not long ago

You were allowed to exploit this that or the other group

I contacted the girl, told her and we confronted him. He begged both of us individually of course to take him back. I loved him and couldn't bear the separation anxiety but my morals wouldn't allow me to take back a cheater so I bargained with myself lol and ended up becoming FWB.

He would even bring me gifts and stuff from the way back whenever he flew to his gfs city. This continued for 2 years. When our contract came to an end, I ended things with him citing the fact that since there is no future for us, Its best we end this. It took every once of courage in me to say this to him. I loved him a lot and it killed me to abandon him. When he heard this, he started crying.

Or maybe it is, or it’s enough anyway, and I’m just unhappy in life in general… still? Hm. I won’t make any career changes til I’m in a better place anyway, at least not any major ones. What would I even do? I have no real passions. I have no specific talent. I have no degree. I’m not a “personality hire” and I am absolutely not extroverted in any way, shape or form. So what does that leave? I also have no drive or ambition or whatever other word in that family, at least not now. I mean I think I do, I think my perfectionist self and want to be better is in there and clamouring to get out, but it’s all smothered by my inability to really *do* life right now. I don’t even have the drive to spend time on hobbies I enjoy, imagine trying to conjure up some career drive. But learning to separate myself and my personality from my depression and anxiety has helped me a lot, I mean I still struggle let’s be honest - I see myself as a lazy procrastinator who’s afraid of life - and I think I am those things, because I am those things, but I also think I can be better, I just need to get out from under this rainy cloud, yknow. At least that’s what we talk about in therapy and she says it in a way that makes me believe it. And one time, ages ago, Andy said how he thinks if it weren’t for my mental health issues I’d be quite successful or ambitious etc as he thinks I’m an overachiever trapped in a depressy box. I mean I’ve paraphrased the ever living hell out of what he said because it’s mostly the sentiment that stuck with me not his words but I think about it quite a lot. I don’t know if he just said it to be nice or what, but I also don’t see him as the kind of person to say things for no reason. In fact I know he isn’t that person. I’m sure I journaled about it, so if I trawled through my entries I’d find it but you best believe I ain’t doing that right now. But so sometimes I feel like maybe I’ll be a whole new person career wise once I get out from under all *this*. I hope. Maybe. Anyway. Back to work tomorrow. I think dad will go out and buy coffees from the cafe as a lil back to work great which will be nice, he also bought extra croissants but at this rate I’m going to turn into a croissant so I may have to sadly skip that. 

I haven’t done much today - 

* slept in a bit, *quelle surprise* 
* started a new book
* looked at stuff online on my laptop under a blanket on the sofa 
* did the crossword! 
* made some leek pies for dinner with mum
* played with pups and had lots of snuggles 
* missed my honey 

That’s about it…? Big day. Huge day. Colossal day. 

Annnnnnnnnd back to work tomorrow. UGH. 

I will aim to book a few days off again as soon as I can.

I loved him and couldn't bear the separation anxiety but my morals wouldn't allow me to take back a cheater so I bargained with myself lol and ended up becoming FWB. After a while I heard he got back together with the girl he cheated me on with. I am shit and pathetic for this but I didn't end the FWB arrangement. The thing is his girlfriend was Long distance. Him and I worked at the same place and would hang out all the time. It wasn't just benefits. We would go on food dates, he would buy my gifts and we would stay for hours on calls. He would even bring me gifts and stuff from the way back whenever he flew to his gfs city. This continued for 2 years. When our contract came to an end, I ended things with him citing the fact that since there is no future for us, Its best we end this. It took every once of courage in me to say this to him. I loved him a lot and it killed me to abandon him. When he heard this, he started crying. Confused because I always thought he might have been fwb out of guilt since he loved his gf and thats why chose her over me, I asked what makes him cry over this ending. He told me he isnt happy with his gf  but his family loves her and thats why he cant end things with her. I tried convincing him to let both of us go and start afresh if thats what will make him happy since I genuinely prioritised his happiness over anything.

Gained back about 30 lbs. Been rough since I got laid off at the end of the summer.  Started eating during the day, which put me back on the ""taking in too many calories thing"" that happens when I do that.

75 Hard is one plan I have.  Just finishing day 4. 

I decided to do a diet that slightly increases in difficulty as I progress and get better at eating well. I know myself fairly well by this point and I know that I cannot do things full tilt at the start because I tend to go all in and burnout pretty quick. The first phase of the diet will be more whole foods and no prepackaged convenience foods. I don't eat fast food but maybe once every couple of months now so that's not an issue for me. Pizza rolls, hot pockets, and the like are my downfalls when I am not paying attention. When I am on my game, I can have them fine and work them into whatever calorie range I'm shooting for. When I am off... I'll eat them all. Another rule for the diet is no food after midnight. I tend to snack and eat a lot of calories late at night, so that should be another decent addition. I know when I am overeating, so the final part is stopping before I do. Take less food at first, then go get a little more if I decide I am still hungry, instead of just LOADING UP the first time around. I'll add more

My daily 45-minute outdoor workout is walking my dogs around the block & my second daily 45-minute workout has been indoor VR workouts with beat saber, boxVR, or thrill of the fight.

The book I am currently reading for the challenge is Think & Grow Rich.  Not really liking it so far.  I'm not very into these kinda books (self-improvement) that try to say things using as many words as possible.

The gallon of plain water per day is the thing that is probably the hardest for me right now.  I drink a liter of coffee from my French press every day usually and that doesn't count, so I'm drinking lots later in the day. I'm very hydrated, so I'm going to put a good 8 or so lbs on my weight from all the water that's in me, lol.",1,1736062023.0,FitChallenge,0,1.0,False
1hu0gkw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1hu0gkw/non_stop_heart_palpitations/,Non Stop Heart Palpitations,"This is long, please bear with me.

I'm a 41-year-old female, and I've been dealing with persistent heart palpitations for over a year now. I know asking for medical advice on Reddit probably isn't the best idea, but at this point, I'm feeling pretty hopeless and thought I'd give it a try. If anyone has gone through something similar or has found something that helped, please, please share—I'd really appreciate any advice or insights.

**Background**

In December 2022, I contracted COVID-19. It was a severe case but did not require hospitalization, more like an extremely bad flu. I had received three doses of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, which may be relevant. About a month later, I began experiencing unusual heart palpitations that lasted for hours or even days. These episodes were accompanied by dizziness, lightheadedness, a heavy or tight chest (which was dull rather than sharp), nausea, and fatigue. Though I didn’t feel short of breath, I found I had to take deep, heavy breaths. The palpitations would persist for days or weeks, occasionally stopping for a few days, only to return for another week or two.

The palpitations felt like a vibration in my chest—hollow flutters as well as deep, painful thuds. They would often wake me from sleep, and the sensation occurred regardless of whether I was standing, sitting, or lying down. I did notice that the palpitations would subside temporarily if my heart rate went above 100 beats per minute, but once my heart rate settled, they would return.

I visited my GP, and after undergoing tests, all results came back normal. My doctor referred me to a therapist and prescribed Diazepam for anxiety, but it didn’t help. I was then referred to a cardiologist, who performed several tests. Aside from discovering that I have an ectopic beat (an extra heartbeat), which he assured me is normal, all my tests were clear, even though they witnessed the palpitations on my ECG. The cardiologist prescribed me propranolol and told me I was simply an ""anxious woman."" However, I don’t believe anxiety is the root cause—I do experience anxiety, but not to the extent of constant palpitations.

I went to the emergency room, where my troponin levels were normal, ruling out a heart attack, but the palpitations persisted. My GP then suggested seeing a gastroenterologist, which I did. I had an endoscopy and tested for H. pylori, both of which came back negative. I was cleared of GERD, acid reflux, or any digestive issues. The gastroenterologist suspected a psychological cause, but I remain unconvinced. If I were anxious, it would likely be because of the palpitations, not the other way around.

Frustrated, I returned to my GP and requested a second cardiology opinion. This led me to a new cardiologist, who conducted an extensive evaluation of my heart and diagnosed me with Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia (IST). To rule out any potential structural issues, he ordered a CT angiogram, which returned normal results—my heart is healthy, free from blockages, and functioning as it should. The cardiologist prescribed Ivabradine, which was a game-changer. For the first time in a long while, my palpitations seemed to subside.

However, after being on Ivabradine (5 mg twice a day) for the past 1.5 years, the relief has started to diminish. I am now experiencing the same palpitations again, much like before, and I fear the medication is losing its effectiveness. I am currently seeking a third opinion from a different cardiologist to explore further options and hope to find a lasting solution.

**Tests**

1. ECG (4 times)
2. Echocardiography/Ultrasound
3. Stress Test
4. 2 weeks Holter Monitor
5. 48 hours Holter Monitor
6. 24 hours Holter Monitor
7. CT Coronary Angiogram
8. Endoscopy
9. Blood Tests (Troponin, Iron, Vitamin deficiency, thyroid, and everything else)
10. Urea Breath Test (UBT)

**Medications taken**

1. Propranolol (Didn't work. HR is down to 58bpm but now I have a low HR with palpitations)
2. Metoprolol (Same as Popranolol)
3. Pantropazole (Didn't work)
4. Esomeprazole (Didn't work)
5. Ivabradine (Thank God for this!)
6. Diazepam (Aside from having a really good sleep, didn't help at all)

I'm a 41-year-old female, and I've been dealing with persistent heart palpitations for over a year now. I know asking for medical advice on Reddit probably isn't the best idea, but at this point, I'm feeling pretty hopeless and thought I'd give it a try. If anyone has gone through something similar or has found something that helped, please, please share—I'd really appreciate any advice or insights.

**Background**

In December 2022, I contracted COVID-19. It was a severe case but did not require hospitalization, more like an extremely bad flu. I had received three doses of the Pfizer COVID vaccine, which may be relevant. About a month later, I began experiencing unusual heart palpitations that lasted for hours or even days. These episodes were accompanied by dizziness, lightheadedness, a heavy or tight chest (which was dull rather than sharp), nausea, and fatigue. Though I didn’t feel short of breath, I found I had to take deep, heavy breaths. The palpitations would persist for days or weeks, occasionally stopping for a few days, only to return for another week or two.

The palpitations felt like a vibration in my chest—hollow flutters as well as deep, painful thuds. They would often wake me from sleep, and the sensation occurred regardless of whether I was standing, sitting, or lying down. I did notice that the palpitations would subside temporarily if my heart rate went above 100 beats per minute, but once my heart rate settled, they would return.

I visited my GP, and after undergoing tests, all results came back normal. My doctor referred me to a therapist and prescribed Diazepam for anxiety, but it didn’t help. I was then referred to a cardiologist, who performed several tests. Aside from discovering that I have an ectopic beat (an extra heartbeat), which he assured me is normal, all my tests were clear, even though they witnessed the palpitations on my ECG. The cardiologist prescribed me propranolol and told me I was simply an ""anxious woman."" However, I don’t believe anxiety is the root cause—I do experience anxiety, but not to the extent of constant palpitations.

I went to the emergency room, where my troponin levels were normal, ruling out a heart attack, but the palpitations persisted. My GP then suggested seeing a gastroenterologist, which I did. I had an endoscopy and tested for H. pylori, both of which came back negative. I was cleared of GERD, acid reflux, or any digestive issues. The gastroenterologist suspected a psychological cause, but I remain unconvinced. If I were anxious, it would likely be because of the palpitations, not the other way around.

Frustrated, I returned to my GP and requested a second cardiology opinion. This led me to a new cardiologist, who conducted an extensive evaluation of my heart and diagnosed me with Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia (IST). To rule out any potential structural issues, he ordered a CT angiogram, which returned normal results—my heart is healthy, free from blockages, and functioning as it should. The cardiologist prescribed Ivabradine, which was a game-changer. For the first time in a long while, my palpitations seemed to subside.

However, after being on Ivabradine (5 mg twice a day) for the past 1.5 years, the relief has started to diminish. I am now experiencing the same palpitations again, much like before, and I fear the medication is losing its effectiveness. I am currently seeking a third opinion from a different cardiologist to explore further options and hope to find a lasting solution.

2. Metoprolol (Same as Popranolol)
3. Pantropazole (Didn't work)

5. Ivabradine (Thank God for this!)

1hu0dyw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hu0dyw/i_took_a_night_shift_security_job_but_something/,"I took a night shift security job, but something isn’t adding up.","A few weeks ago, I started working as a night shift security guard for an old office building downtown. The place is mostly empty at night—just a few cleaning staff and the occasional late-working executive. The job seemed easy: check the cameras, do an hourly patrol of the building, and make sure everything stays locked up.

At first, the hardest part was staying awake. I’d sip coffee at my desk and glance at the cameras, which usually showed nothing but empty hallways. The building was quiet, almost too quiet. The kind of silence that makes you notice every little sound.

It was on my third night when I saw something strange. Around 3 a.m., the motion sensor in the west stairwell went off. The camera feed showed nothing—just an empty staircase. I figured it was a glitch. Sensors in older buildings can be finicky. But when I went to check it out, I found the stairwell door open. I was sure I’d locked it earlier during my rounds.

I shrugged it off and locked the door again. Maybe one of the cleaning staff had used it and forgotten to close it. But when I asked the cleaners about it, they swore they hadn’t gone near that stairwell.

The following night, it happened again. Same time, same stairwell. This time, I didn’t bother checking it out. I just locked the door remotely and made a note in my report.

On my fifth night, things got weirder. I was reviewing the camera footage from earlier in the evening when I noticed something odd. At 2:47 a.m., the west stairwell camera showed the door slowly creaking open. No one was there. The hallway was empty. But as the door swung wide, the lights in the stairwell flickered, just once.

I rewound the footage and watched it again, and that’s when I noticed it. Just before the lights flickered, a shadow passed across the bottom of the stairs. It was quick, like someone had darted just out of view of the camera.

That was the first time I felt uneasy.

The next night, I decided to do my rounds early, hoping to get ahead of whatever was going on. I started with the west stairwell, checking every door and corner. Everything was locked, exactly as it should be. But when I got to the bottom of the stairs, I noticed something on the wall: scratches. Long, deep marks running down the paint, as if someone had dragged their fingernails across it.

I reported the scratches to my supervisor the next morning, but he just laughed. “It’s an old building,” he said. “These things happen.”

Last night was my breaking point. Around 3:15 a.m., I heard a noise—not through the cameras, but with my own ears. A low, rhythmic tapping, like someone knocking on a door. It was faint at first, but it grew louder, coming from the direction of the west stairwell. I hesitated, my heart racing, then grabbed my flashlight and headed toward the noise.

When I reached the stairwell, the tapping stopped. The door was open again, swinging gently on its hinges. The air in the stairwell was freezing, much colder than the rest of the building. I stepped inside, shining my flashlight down the stairs.

That’s when I heard it—a whisper. Faint, almost inaudible, coming from the bottom of the stairs. I couldn’t make out the words, but the tone was pleading, desperate. I froze, listening, and then the whisper stopped.

The silence that followed was worse.

I turned and left the stairwell, locking the door behind me. I didn’t finish my rounds that night. Instead, I sat at the security desk, staring at the monitors, waiting for my shift to end.

- The Basics: I’m 21, morena, average build with belly fat, and around 5'1""
- Student Life: I’m currently in my final year of my degree. Balancing school and social life isn’t easy, but I make time for the right people
- Hobbies & Quirks:
    - I love trying new things. Whether it's a random hobby, new food, or binge-watching a show you recommend, I’m down
    - When I’m not in “student mode,” I’m walking and playing my hobbies out
    - I’m definitely low-maintenance but secretly a big softie. You’ll find me being clingy once we’re comfortable, like a puppy who just wants to hang out
- Love Language: Physical touch is a big one for me


About you:
- Age: Preferably between 22–28 y/o.
- Location: Ideally, you’re based in or around Manila area.
- Personality: You’re confident and know what you want. If you're the type who loves getting attention and giving it back (normal and not excessive level), that’s my vibe.
- Interests & Ambitions: Whether you’re figuring out what you want to do post-graduation or already have a plan, I’m looking for someone who takes the future seriously and is passionate about their goals.
- Politics: No BBM/Duterte supporters, please.
- Health & Vibes: I'm attracted to tall, average to lean, and confident guys. Don’t judge me for this, as we all have our preferences. Also, no kids and separated guys—I’m just not into it.


Let’s chat and see if we vibe. Who knows? Maybe we’ll make something great out of this, or at least have a good laugh along the way. 😊

Probably to encourage people to move so people who need this place can move in. But it could be soon too. I don’t know. 

For now I’m just pausing any big purchases I have planned (literally just a couch, shelves, cat tree and maybe a bed frame, actual dresser and a coffee table).

I have 2 people I have to contact to schedule moving help for items I can’t safely move downstairs so coordinating that isn’t going to be easy. Especially with their work schedules.

We ate together, she’s busy texting him and it’s gotta be the most awkward meals ever. But she bought me a lot of nice gifts that I really liked so I was happy.

for the last few months I've had pain in my anus when pooping, and some bleeding like when i wipe. assumed it was hemorrhoids, but it hasn't gotten better at all. my stool has been increasingly weird though, stringier, like finger thin, and i still have fullness in my bowels kind of feeling? and ive had more frequent diarrhea too, when I used to have more solid stool. chalked this up to coffee and poor  diet. 

today I got fed up with it and took a look in a mirror (tbh I was checking for worms because it was itching so badly at bedtime) and saw like definitely two fleshy lumps on/near my anus- they have never been there before, at least that I've noticed, and are like sensitive but not painful to the touch. I googled and did not like the answers. 

I do want to get this looked at but my primary care doctor is hard to book and also I am just uncomfortable with her style. she never listens to anything I say and is incredibly dismissive so I always hesitate to reach out to her.

1hu0086,https://www.reddit.com/r/AgencyRideAlong/comments/1hu0086/part_2_the_grind_finding_my_first_clients_and/,Part 2: The Grind - Finding My First Clients and Building Reputation,"Last post for the night! I will return tomorrow with a Part 3/4. \*\*  
  
When I was ready to find my first clients, I faced the harsh reality that knowing how to execute digital marketing and getting clients to trust you are entirely different things. Without a list of past successes to lean on, I had to prove myself in every interaction. But this stage wasn’t just about finding clients, it was about laying the groundwork for a sustainable agency.

This chapter of my journey taught me critical lessons: how to put myself out there, build trust, and deliver exceptional results. Below, I’ll guide you through how I did it and give you **resources below** to help you do the same.

# Step 1: Building Confidence and Credibility Before Approaching Clients

The first step is gaining confidence in your abilities and creating a solid foundation of credibility. This is especially important if you’re just starting and don’t have a portfolio of past clients.

# 1. Mock Projects to Build a Portfolio

Before pitching real businesses, I suggest practicing by creating mock projects. For example:

* I built an SEO-friendly website for an imaginary coffee shop.
* I optimized a fake Google Business Profile for a made-up med spa.
* I wrote blog posts targeting local keywords like “Best coffee in \[City\]” or “What to know before Botox.”

**Why This Works:**  
Mock projects help you apply your skills and showcase tangible work when pitching clients.

**Resources for Creating Mock Projects:**

1. [**Duda**](https://www.duda.co): The easiest platform for clients + mass scale imo.
2. [**WordPress**](https://wordpress.org/)**:** Learn website building and optimization.
3. [**Wix**](https://www.wix.com/)**:** An easy platform for beginner website builders.
4. [**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/)**:** Design visuals for your mock businesses.
5. [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com/)**:** Free, high-quality images to use in your mock projects.
6. [**AnswerThePublic**](https://answerthepublic.com/)**:** Find common search queries for blog topics.

# 2. Offering Free Work to Build Real-World Experience

I would approach small business owners I knew and offered to help them for free or at a low cost. My pitch was straightforward: “Let me optimize your online presence, and you can use my work for free. In return, I’d love a testimonial.”

**What I Delivered for Free Clients:**

* Local SEO audits and optimizations.
* Google Business Profile setup and optimization.
* Blog posts targeting specific keywords.

**Resources to Manage and Deliver Free Projects:** 7. [**Google Sheets**]()**:** Keep track of your tasks and deadlines. 8. [**Trello**](https://trello.com/)**:** Manage free projects with an easy drag-and-drop system. 9. [**Ahrefs Webmaster Tools**]()**:** Perform SEO audits on client websites for free.

# 3. Learning and Practicing with Online Courses

Before pitching clients, I deepened my knowledge by completing free and paid digital marketing courses. Here are courses that helped me build confidence:

1. [**HubSpot Academy**](https://academy.hubspot.com/)**:** Free certifications in content marketing, SEO, and inbound marketing.
2. [**Google Digital Garage**]()**:** Free certifications on digital marketing fundamentals.
3. [**SEMrush Academy**]()**:** Courses on SEO, PPC, and social media marketing.
4. [**LinkedIn Learning**](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/)**:** Comprehensive marketing courses (free with LinkedIn Premium).
5. [**Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org/)**:** Offers free courses from universities on digital marketing.

# Step 2: Finding My First Paying Clients

With some mock projects and free work under my belt, I felt ready to land paying clients. Here’s how I approached this critical phase:

# 1. Cold Email Outreach

I started with personalized cold emails to local businesses. A generic “Do you need help with marketing?” doesn’t work. Instead, I researched each business to understand their needs and pain points.

**Cold Email Structure:**

* **Personalized Opening:** Mention something specific about their business.
* **Value Proposition:** Explain how you can solve a problem for them.
* **Call-to-Action:** Offer a free audit or consultation.

**Resources for Cold Outreach:** 14. [**Hunter.io**](https://hunter.io/)**:** Find email addresses for businesses. 15. [**Snov.io**](https://snov.io/)**:** Another tool to discover emails and automate outreach. 16. [**Mailshake**](https://mailshake.com/)**:** Automate and track cold email campaigns. 17. [**Streak for Gmail**](https://www.streak.com/)**:** Manage your email leads directly in Gmail.

# 2. Leveraging Freelance Platforms

Freelance platforms gave me access to clients while building my reputation. I created profiles on platforms like:

* [**Upwork**](https://www.upwork.com/)**:** Best for long-term freelance work.
* [**Fiverr**](https://www.fiverr.com/)**:** Ideal for offering entry-level services like GBP optimization.
* [**Freelancer**](https://www.freelancer.com/)**:** Another platform for digital marketing gigs.

**How to Stand Out on Freelance Platforms:**

* Showcase mock projects and free work in your portfolio.
* Offer a “money-back guarantee” to minimize client risk.

**Resources to Optimize Freelance Profiles:** 18. [**Canva Resume Templates**]()**:** Create visually appealing portfolios. 19. [**ProBlogger Jobs Board**]()**:** Find blogging and content gigs.

# 3. Networking Locally

Attending local events helped me meet small business owners in person. I introduced myself as someone who helps businesses grow online and offered free audits to start conversations.

**Resources to Find Networking Opportunities:** 20. [**Eventbrite**](https://www.eventbrite.com/)**:** Find small business events near you. 21. [**Meetup**](https://www.meetup.com/)**:** Join networking and business growth groups. 22. [**BNI (Business Networking International)**](https://www.bni.com/)**:** Paid but highly effective networking group. (Blah I've yet to find this work but I still listed it)

# Step 3: Delivering Results

Once I landed paying clients, my priority was delivering exceptional results. This wasn’t just about doing the work, it was about showing clients the impact of my efforts.

# Project Management Tools

1. [**Asana**](https://asana.com/)**:** Track client projects and deadlines.
2. [**ClickUp**](https://clickup.com/)**:** All-in-one task and project management.
3. [**Google Drive**]()**:** Share reports and deliverables with clients.

# Client Reporting Tools

Clients love transparency. I created detailed reports to show progress and results: 26. [**Google Data Studio**](https://datastudio.google.com/)**:** Create free, visual performance dashboards. 27. [**AgencyAnalytics**](https://agencyanalytics.com/)**:** A paid tool for creating branded reports. 28. [**DashThis**](https://www.dashthis.com/)**:** Build easy-to-read client dashboards.

# Step 4: Scaling Beyond the First Few Clients

Once I had a few paying clients, I focused on scaling sustainably. Here’s how I did it:

# 1. Streamlining Workflow

I created Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for recurring tasks. For example:

* SEO audits.
* GBP optimization.
* Client onboarding.

**Resources for Creating SOPs:**   
  
29. [**Loom**](https://www.loom.com/)**:** Record video tutorials for team members.   
30. [**Process Street**](https://www.process.st/)**:** Document and share workflows.

# 2. Hiring Freelancers for Growth

As I grew, I hired freelancers to handle time-consuming tasks like blog writing and data entry. This freed up time for higher-value activities like strategy and client acquisition.

**Resources for Hiring Freelancers:**   
  
31. [**OnlineJobs.ph**](https://www.onlinejobs.ph/)**:** Affordable and skilled virtual assistants.   
32. [**Fiverr Business**]()**:** Find specialized freelancers.

1htzzq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1htzzq8/vietnam_holiday_from_perth_quick_summary_of_pros/,Vietnam holiday from Perth - quick summary of pros and cons,"Did a 3 week holiday with a large family group (13 people including 6 kids ranging from 2 to 12) from mid Dec to 3rd Jan.

Firstly, Vietnam is an amazing country and we will definately be coming back in the future so overall it was an amazing holiday. I'll recap the holiday below for future holiday makers going to Vietnam for their use.

Ho Chi Minh City. Amazing city. Stayed at Rivergate apartments. Pretty good accomodation with sufficient living space. There are a lot of other short stayers here and the ""host"" needs to give you access to the pool, because the building isn't supposed to be used as short stay acommodation, which is annoying. There is food and coffee in the alley street next and behind the apartment which makes breakfast easy. The Dong Tay Barber shop around the corner is also amazing for men's barber cuts. Best hair cut and service for $80k dong plus tip.

HCMC has a lot of shopping centres with indoor play centres which you pay per kid. This was handy for the kids we had with us as it kept them occupied for a while.

Food to try is Banh Mi, Bun Bo Hue, Cafe sua da, Bo Ne, Bánh Xèo. The Cafe sua Da is the best kick in the morning. . You can also just order Banh Mi with (deep) fried eggs for breakfast.  Lots of other food to try as well which is why just walking the streets and eating like a local is such an enjoyable experience. Pricing is unbelievably cheap. Fresh Juices go down well when you have been walking around in the humidity and heat. 

Ben Thanh Markets - Food inside is great but shopping is also decent too., numerous shopping centres. 

War Museum  - bit confronting but that's the reality of war, but it was still interesting to walk and read about it.

Presedential palace - interesting and quite vast especially in the basement. Locals and tourists take a lot of pictures there but it isn't too overcrowded.

Ben Nghe Street Food, down the road from the Presidential Palace has a good selection of food and juices to have after doing Presidential palace.

the Post Office. Interesting but not mind blowing. People bought post cards to send it back to their home country. The Church opposite was decked out in Xmas lights which was nice. 

Flew to Phu Quoc island for a few days.

We stayed at the Wyndham Garden Grandworld. (45min from the Intl' airport). Accommodation was clean and in good condition but they couldn't offer us one of our adjoining rooms so there was a bit of room shuffling after the 1st day to get it to work. The big water slides are not working even tho they are advertised. Rumour was it wasn't certified yet. There is a kids water feature but adults weren't allowed to go up which is odd. 

In general Phu Quoc has a Resort area which is to the North West of the island is a bit of a ghost town. The buildings are all european inspired which i find a bit odd and 80% of the shops are empty. only the shops around the main lake were busy at night. during the day when it is quite warm, noone is out. Bit sad to see a large area of this natural island cleared for a ghost town.

We visited Vinwonders, which is like a Disneyland, Water park, Aquarium and more, stuffed into one Theme park. We didn't even have enough time to do the whole Theme park. We hit some rides for the kids, then got a buffet lunch, then the aquarium which is inside a huge turtle building which was pretty cool then spent the afternoon at the water park. We prob only explored 50% of the park. It is pretty quiet so there were no queues for rides or very short wait times if there was a queue. We would come back in the future to hit Vinwonders again maybe over a couple of days. One thing to note is that Adults aren't allowed on the kids water splash area and slides in the water park, not even to walk kids up, even tho the structure is huge and could easily take several adults. Some i would consider adult slides. Also 140cm seems to be the limit for rides. Under 140cm ur a child and above is an adult. Consider this for tickets and rides. Another factor is Weight. They WILL weigh you on a scale to check your actual weight for the ride. Tickets were like $50aud per person so it really is bang for your buck. If you can't get to Disneyland, this is probably close enough.

The food in this resort part of Phu Quoc is very limited and probably overpriced. Tourists are the main target so it is priced accordingly. Tourists are mainly Russians, Khazakstans, Koreans and Japanese i think. There is no traffic here except the odd scooter and car, which adds to the ghost town description.

The beach was nice. The beach faces the west so the it can be pretty toasty in the afternoon. i recommend going in the morning as the trees will provide shade on the shore line.

We went to the Phu Quoc night market once and it was much nicer and livlier. Got dinner, dessert and drinks there and was priced more locally.

We hit the Vinsafari another day. Also another worthy attraction. enjoyed walking around looking at the exhibits. The Safari bus is also pretty good as you get to see grazing animals, tigers and bears. The condiitons of the enclosures were decent and i think the animals looked healthy enough.  In the Crocodile area, i think i noted a few dead crocodiles in the enclosure however. Also a big pet peeve were tourists feeding the monkeys and otters, next to the don't feed the animals.  There wasn't any staff in these areas. Overall it is worth checking out.

Flew to Hanoi after Phu Quoc. Hanoi is smoggy so bring masks. I personally didn't think the food in general was great here. nothing blew my mind. The food is different to the south in HCMC. However some food highlights are the egg coffee which is quite rich, coconut coffee & Banh cuon. 

Hanoi was also where we hit our first major issue. We booked, via [booking.com](http://booking.com), to stay at the Gatsby Central Hanoi Hotel. We wanted to check the rooms before paying full upfront payment to them. There was a disagreement about doing this but eventually they let us view the rooms. They also wanted us to cancel the [booking.com](http://booking.com) booking and just pay them cash direct for the full stay which didn't go down well. we were also missing an extra bed if we did stay. An argument was had and luckily we had a few native vietnamese speakers with us. The condition of the rooms was run down. The pics you see on the websites were the original photos from when they probably first built it. Everything is worn down. The bathroom tiles have large cracks in them. It did not look like the sink had been wiped down in a while. It is a bit of a bait and switch and try and get you to pay upfront with no recourse so just be careful.

We only stayed a night there because it was 10pm when we actually rocked up because of Vietjet delays (more about Vietjet later). We moved to Rose Garden Apartments which was further out but they were 1000x better and were serviced apartments so we had a living room and kitchen and dining table, unlike the Gatsby, which was just the main room with beds and a bathroom. So i can recommend Rose Garden apartments. There is local food around but not as much. Grab is your friend here to get back into Old Quarters.

We visited Hanoi Sky, but with the smog, you can't see exceptionally far. 

We checked out Toy street, but it didn't have as many stores as we thought. 

Shopping in general on the streets is actually pretty good. Picked up a couple of back packs and shoes for a great price. The shops north of the Ho Hoan Kiem were where we hit.

I did a foot massage with my partner in Hanoi. They advertised a price at the door 220k for 60min or something like that each. No issues did the massage and at the end the masseuses asked for tips. So this was a bit awkward as it wasn't mentioned at the door. So be aware some places ask for tips and some places don't so just be upfront at the start.

Hit a few shopping centres so the kids could go into the indoor play centres. Entertains them while the adults can do a few laps of the shops.

We also got some FRESH Salted egg Kopi bread just as it came out of the oven on the streets at the south end of Toy Street. AMAZINGGGG. there are other flavours like vanilla and mochi etc. So addictive. There are two stores, King Roti and another one just 2 shops up. check them out.

We hit Train St to do the tourist thing and wait for a train to come past. Firstly , you need to find out what times the trains come so you go before they arrive of course. Secondly, for you to view the train while it goes past you need to sit down and the vendors know this so you will have to buy a drink to sit at their chairs, which is fair enough. Get their early enough so you can walk along the tracks to choose a vendor you want to sit down before it becomes too late. Prices are slightly more but nothing crazy. We also got the freshest Banh Cuon as we were walking towards train st. This lady made them infront of us while we waited.

Checked out Book St. Interesting. Few photo opportunities here.

We wanted to check out Ha Long bay so you hav to book via a booking agent on the street. This is where we hit our next issue. The travel agent (who is located next to the Crepe store at the north end of Ho Hoan Kiem) showed us a glossy picture book of the Halong Heritage Luxury Cruise boat which would take us on the Ha Long cruise. Looked great and nice. The receipt/invoice did not note down the name of the boat. She called the tour guide to confirm and it was all good. We paid cash and it was all sorted. We also took our own private bus/taxi there. The next day our driver took us to the Jetty (2hr drive plus a stop off) where our boat was supposed to be. A person came out and confirmed who we were and said that is your boat. and we were like no, we are on the Halong Heritage. And he just stared blankly and said its the same. This boat was called Halong Sonata and looked different. We called the travel agent and she said ""the Jacuzzi is broken. This boat is the same"". The old bait and switch scam. The Sonata was fine. It was in good condition but it wasn't what we were sold. So be careful of the bait and switch on tours.

Halong bay cruise it self was fine however overcrowded. They will Jam as many boats and tourists on to the boats and islands as they can. the boats literally will squeeze inbetween other boats to dock so you can get back on to it. It is a constant queue of people. Suprising cave is just a queue at the start and spreads out a little as you get further into the cave. The Kayak and boating is just a hundreds of tourists trying to jump onto kayaks or the row boats. It moves quickly but there is a bit of queue cutting and shoving to get onto a kayak or rowboat. The whole feels is a bit over touristy and commerialised which is unfortunate. We did it, but wouldn't do it again. 

After Hanoi, we flew to DaNang. Overall it is an amazing city, unfortunately it was raining for most of the time. We hit Ba Na Hills and took the cable car up. The cable car system it self is amazing and as an engineer, quite amazed at how they built everything into the mountains. Unfortunately due to the rain, we essentially just moved into a cloud so our visibility eventually dropped to like 20m. We walked around the Ba Na hills but everything was wet, we couldn't even see the buildings so couldn't actually follow a map because we couldn't find reference points. oh well. We eventually got to the Golden hand bridge and took a few happy snaps in the clouds. The Castle is incredible that they built something like that in the mountain. I would go back just on better weather.

DaNang city itself is great. The Massages are even cheaper and INCLUDE a tip in the price so me and my partner did a 90min massage was awesome. The night market was really good

The dragon bridge and the fire and water show is worth waiting for. We waited in the rain!. 

We would go back and check out DaNang again in better weather. The beach was rough due to the wet weather and storms but they would entertain the kids if the weather was nicer.

We also did a trip to HoiAn to do the Coconut boats. That was a bit of a waste. The coconut boats was interesting. They take you out to an opening where there are other people that spin really fast and ask if you want to try. Also they expect a tip just for showing you how they spin really fast in a circle. Then the coconut boat rower takes you to a old men singing karaoke in coconut boats...it is def the most WTF moment. Then you are supposed to tip this old man who sings out of tune. WTF.  Would have prefered if they showed more traditional things like fishing and crab pot pulling or something. The coconut boat is relaxing except for the ""entertainment"" above.

We also visited a Japanese water park in Da Nang called Mikazuki Water Park 365. Pretty awesome as it is themed towards the Japanese so it is very clean and well maintained. There is a tide pool, a couple water slides and a water roller coaster. Also a lazy lake. Upstairs there is an outdoor Onsen which is AWESOME. The water rollercoaster is also a highlight but you HAVE to be 40kg. they will weigh you here. The tube slides only need ot be 30kg. You could spend a day here. Bring snacks as the food area is limited and very slow.

We also visited Hoi an for the night laterns. It was raining so wasn't great to walk around in ponchos. It was pretty and worth visiting for a few photos. The night market is decent with food options too.

That pretty much wraps up all the places we visited. 

We took Vietjet for our internal flights. Vietjet are a budget air line and it shows. Delays are pretty much certain and there won't be any communication abou the delay. The screens will say boarding but noone will be there for boarding. They will also park the plane at the end of the airport and shuttle you to the terminal which can be pretty average as you have to wait and sardined into the shuttle bus. Also when you are delayed, there is no one at the gate to tell you what is going on which i think is on purpose. They only rock up when boarding is about to start. It is a total shtshow. You can waste half a day essentially because of the delays as you will get to the airport early for the normal boarding but will get delayed another 2hrs or more while ur already waiting and checked in. Anyways done with my Rant. They are a budget airline so you get what you pay for.

Vietnam Airlines, which is what we took between Perth and HCMC, was great. Full service with entertainment screens. People at the gates to explain if there are any issues etc.

Other things to note while in Vietnam. Traffic is nuts, however it is organised chaos. Traffic just flows. If you need to cross a road, wait for a gap between the cars then start crossing at a smooth and constant speed. Just look towards the oncoming scooters but keep moving forward. They will avoid you if they know where you are going. Do not stop and you will be fine.

Think that is my wrap up of Vietnam. We would be going back in the future to hit HCMC, Phu Quoc and DaNang/Hoi An again.

Hopefully it helps fellow travellers to Vietnam. Amazing country, people and food!

We very slowly got to know each other, he started coming to my cubical to talk. All my co workers were like “I think he likes you!” but I didn't think he did. We get closer and hang out at work all the time for hours and have really deep philosophical talks but also play silly games with each other. We always made a 1 person job a 2 person job, got food together, ran errands, laughed a lot, and texted all day if we weren't together at work. He was also bringing me coffee’s all the time and my co-workers said he would come looking for me looking like a lost puppy when I wasn't there. We started texting more and more but I still had doubts he liked me. 

I leave for christmas holiday and he asks if he can just sit in my cubicle to feel safe when i'm gone and texts me texts me saying he missed me while i'm gone. I finally admit I am starting to like him. I rarely like people so I didn’t really know what to do.

We hang out outside of work but always in a group setting and thats what made me think he didn't like me more than friend. Our co worker always asked questions while i wasnt there and he basically tells her he would ask me out but didn't want to make it weird at work and he's still getting over his ex. I'm frustrated but can't help but still get closer to him.  

We start carpooling to work and make each other coffee’s the way we know each other likes multiple times a week. He starts just driving us to work instead of taking turns like we used to. We are very flirty with sooo much eye contact, we could have convo across the room. All my co-workers, even ones that dont see us very often started asking if we were dating. I finally get so annoyed I bring it up with him and he admits he's scared to date me and he's not ready to be a good partner. I say I understand but i feel like im going insane. 

THREE WEEKS later he goes out with a girl and i find out through a mutual friend. I bring it up with him and he says he doesn't remember saying all those things to me and starts to get very defensive when I bring out the receipts. He eventually kind of apologizes but things are weird between us but I choose to forgive him partially and ask if we can still be friends. We move forwards and a few months later this girl he went out with is now his girlfriend. 

Now they’ve been dating 6 months but things at work are back to how they used to be, we still hang out all the time and text all the time. We still have intense eye contact all the time but it feels so comfortable. He is a good friend and is there whenever i need him, but now we dont text on the weekends or hang out outside of work/check in with each other like we used ot and it hurts so bad. He’s planning on leaving to follow his girlfriend in the summer and I feel like I'm never going to see him again. 

He’s done me so wrong but I still have feelings for him and get so upset and its honestly preventing me from pursuing other people. I don't know how to let it go, I don't even feel like we would work in a relationship but he has so many qualities i was looking for i have never felt so comfortable with a man. 

I've tried to distance myself and suck so bad at it. I know him leaving will probably be good for me but i just want to not have these sad feelings anymore. I've talked about this way to much with my therapist and haven't gotten to feeling much better so please any advice.  

PS I  feel very stupid about the whole situation so please be nice

1htzpzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1htzpzs/i_was_accused_of_rape_and_cannot_forgive_myself/,I was accused of rape and cannot forgive myself - it’s ruining my life ,"*trigger alert* 

this is going to be a long one. Buckle up. 

My (F/40) once very close friend (M/36) that we will call “Brandon” completely destroyed my self image and made me believe I am a horrible person to my core. So much that I hide away from my once impressive social scene and cut myself off from the world and friends basically. 

Brandon and I spent every waking moment today. We were coworkers and clicked immediately upon meeting. Both spiritual, goofy, hard working, extremely sensitive, lonely, etc. I hosted a dinner party one night and he stayed after everyone left, until around 2am, smoking cigarettes and talking about very deep topics and life experiences as we discovered we were both Pisces and hate small talk. It felt like there was slight sexual energy but nothing happened, I didn’t think of it again. 

Then he came around almost daily after work (I lived by the office). Sometimes he came over before work. We went to lunch together. We texted every thought we had and emotionally grew very close, very quickly. I was starting to feel feelings but was so confused. He asked to stay the night a few weeks into this friendship, and slept on the couch. This happened often and suddenly he’s sleeping in my bed. Spooning me. Love bombs me and makes me feel like I’m seen and heard and loved for the first time. I feel safe and his presence calls my nervous system. I’m really feeling feelings now - but he has still never made a move. What the hell?

Eventually, my ex bf was randomly in town and we got together as friends (this wasn’t uncommon and we were close friends first) for dinner or coffee to catch up. I tell him the situation and he tells me this guy sounds like he needs something from me. I hear it but I second guess it since there could be some bias there. Brandon texts me 54 times “excuse me?!” while at this dinner. This is his childlike way of saying he needs attention but I read this as jealousy. 

A week or so goes by and I tell Brandon how I feel about him and I’m confused about what’s going on with us. He tells me he loves me as a friend but isn’t into me romantically, so I tell him I need space. I go on a vacation a few days later and he goes on a date that same weekend, which he tells me about in advance. She stays the night and they hook up, but he isn’t into her and asks if he can pick me up at the airport and hang out tonight. He tells me he’s not into her and would have rather hung out with me, then stays over and spoons me. 

During this time, I have started to become friendly with his sister and she’s asking me what’s up with us and why we aren’t together. I tell her that I told Brandon and he said he wasn’t into me. She tells me that he said to her that we were just friends, and she tells me everyone in their family thinks he’s in love with me and afraid to ruin our friendship by fucking it up. 


Additionally and tragically, I was kidnapped and raped around this time. Brandon became my support system immediately following and as I spent months begging the police to prosecute. My parents are across the country and couldn’t see how rapidly my mental health was declining, but they were grateful that I had Brandon to be there with me all the time. 

We go back to the same codependent relationship for about a year. I had never had such a best friend but I was sinking deeper into shock/depression and just wanted him to love me. 

About a year and a few months of this insane relationship, I begin to feel him pulling away. I feel that I am losing him and decide I’m going to make a move - because “he is in love with me and afraid to admit it so I must be the assertive one” like his sister and I had discussed multiple times. 

After his pulling away, I give distance and he comes back around and he wants us to plan a weekend trip to a neighboring beach town. We go for a weekend and begin the trip with drinks at the hotel. Then to a vineyard to wine taste. Then to dinner with more drinks. I have the liquid courage to make a move. 

We get back to the hotel room and (this is so hard to say and I hate myself for this part) and I lean into kiss him. He pauses but he doesn’t move away and says “no no, we can’t do this”. I read it as “we shouldn’t but let’s do it anyway” and began unzipping his pants to discover he is hard. I begin to give him head and he doesn’t fight me, he moans and finishes, the pulls up his underwear and go to the bathroom. Things are immediately weird next moment. We’re both drunk so I pass out. 

On our drive home the next morning, we get breakfast and hit a few shops- he says “wow that was really aggressive last night” “if it were anyone else I would have been afraid, but all good” “to be honest, it was incredible”. I am horrified but confused. I begin to understand what he is saying and cannot believe what I am hearing- “I thought he wanted it? He’s in love with me and everyone knows it. He was hard, he came, he was just playing hard to get. Why does he care when I’m on dates if he isn’t in love with me? Why did he just say it was good?”

We go back home and a day later he calls me to say “you sexually assaulted me”. I am so horrified- how could I do this to someone after what I just went through? I never meant to hurt him and I never viewed myself as forceful so I didn’t mean to, but, “he said no and I kept going- omg I am a rapist” comes to mind. And I never, ever, ever, let go of it.  The good person I thought I was has been destroyed and I am a rapist- the lowest of the low. We cut ties and I am devastated. How did I misread this when he clearly didn’t want to?

I finally get into therapy to help with this deep dark depression and I never tell her anything about that night, instead I unpack my own rape trauma. In these sessions we discover I am bipolar, and the antidepressants I’d been put on caused me to become incredibly manic and delusional. In hindsight, I had been manic and delusional for months before this happened. 

A few years later, he reached out to me and asked to get together. We had drinks and both apologized for our part in everything. He admits he led me on, unintentionally, and kept coming back because I made him feel loved. I tell him about my diagnosis and how I can see how delusional I was, now that I am medicated and clear headed. I tell him that I never meant to sexually assault him and how I cannot forgive myself. He tells me I need to release myself because he led me on and he let that blowjob happen. 

We went our separate ways after that. I feel he did me a favor to forgive me and let me forgive Myself, but still views it as rape. I learned that rape is not black and white. Regardless of my intention or reasoning, if he views it as unwanted, it is rape regardless. I then know that since be was raped, I have caused him deep trauma. I would give my life to undo that night. I never meant to hurt the person that I was the closest to, in the same way that I was trying to heal from. 

I’ve lived with this since 2020, and I’ve never told a soul. I can’t say it aloud. You’re the first to know. 

In every aspect of my life, this has affected me. My self image has never been worse, I constantly question who I am inside and if I am good or bad, and how I could be so stupid? In terms of relationships, I’ve not let myself date or get close to a man since. I isolate. I spend my life trying to make amends to the universe. I am unable to forgive myself. Regardless of what I thought was happening at the time due to my mania or mixed signals, he did not consent. I committed an unspeakable act. 

If you’ve made it this far, thank you. I wasn’t even sure if I would post it but the thoughts were flowing as soon as I started typing and it’s the first time I’ve vocalized it at all, so maybe even this will help me heal. 

Above all of my major traumas, this is the one that has caused the most damage to my life and self esteem. 

I’m open to any thoughts you might have. How do I forgive myself, stop self sabotaging, and move forward?",2,1736059082.0,offmychest,3,1.0,False
1htzosh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1htzosh/everyday_nausea/, Everyday Nausea ,"Hey guys i really hope someone sees this that has gone through similar.

Around July last year i was in a cafe with my family as my father came to visit. Out of no where after some chips and a sip of coffee i started feeling really sick. Had really bad nausea to the point where i could have thrown up. i ran to the toilet to take a breather as im truly afraid of being sick. luckily i didn't throw up. Obviously after that i was thinking maybe i ate something bad or have a stomach bug.

A week passes, still had this nausea feeling off and on out of no where. i started getting concerned. i tried reflux medications, i cut down foods that are fatty as well as cut down milk even though im a soy milk girly. Anyway i spoke with a GP she did a bunch of blood tests that would show concerns with my symptoms. Back to symptoms its not only really bad nausea at the top of my stomach its also alot of tiredness, weakness, soft stool mainly in the mornings. 

Once blood tests came back everything was clear and perfect which is surprising. my doctor was confused so she gave me medication that helps get rid of ulcers in the stomach but also helps slightly with reflux. i was on that for 2 weeks and im still on them. Mind you its been 7 months or more with me going through this with no answers, ive changed diet as well as taking vitamins. i feel my sickness is getting worse and more frequent definently after eating. Ill be finally going back to my GP to talk deeper about my issues and ask about scans to see the underlining issue. please has someone gone through this or knows someone who has.

I had a huge crush on her for the entire time I knew her, and she might have had a crush on me back then (emphasis on might) to me she was the perfect girl, and we just so happened to be next door neighbors, we were good friends because we went to the same elementary and middle school but we were never able to hang out a lot because we both had strict parents, plus I was always afraid my family would notice I had a huge crush on the girl Nextdoor, which I was already being teased for by my own family! Of course they would just joke but I felt worried deep down. In the end she had to move away and I never knew where, it was maybe around 7th grade I had no phone and neither did she due to the same situation of having strict parents, after a while I forgot about her.

But one day I was reminiscing on the good old days cus I found a old year book from middle school (she managed to be in the book even tho she didn’t graduate there idk how) after feeling nostalgic my curiosity got the best of me, I started a deep investigation using all my powers and memory, and low and behold I found her online! I quickly requested to follow on IG and she accepted the same night. 

And that’s when my world came crashing down, she asked me to remind her who I was because my name rang a bell?! I was devastated but didn’t take it personally, I send her an old picture of us and a recent one of me for comparison (she asked “can I see a picture of you”?) I sent both not knowing what she was referring too, by then she had already remembered me and was asking how I’ve been and how was my family, (the convo was much longer but too many details) in the end she told me she moved to a town an hour and a half away and was attending college, I ended the convo with a classic nice to hear from u take care/ we should chat another time or maybe if our paths cross in town. 

Since then, I’ve been dying to talk to her again and possibly ask her to meet up somewhere to drink coffee or something, to chat and get to know the new version of us and catch up on life (something chill and respectful…no other intentions)

 But I can’t gather the boldness to ask her due to the fact she’s very focused in school rn although we’re in holidays and she lives kinda far, plus we are both 2 different people now, and I dont want to make her uncomfortable possibly scaring her away, I don’t know what to say and how to say it, and to add on to that, she rarely posts on IG or shows any highlights, I don’t do so either, but the couple times I have in the past month we’ve followed each other she always sees the highlights but never likes, I might be overacting but I feel like she doesn’t trust me to even be a friend, she’s always had a very small friend circle, was never shy but just focused in school and never got into any trouble or drama, I was always the opposite, I don’t know what to do, somebody help please 🙏 😭

1htzogp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1htzogp/aitah_for_wanting_to_date_the_guy_my_sister_had_a/,AITAH for wanting to date the guy my sister had a crush on ,"I have no idea what to do. 
My sister (F22) had a crush on a guy (M23) (I’ll call him edward) who she was friends with and she really liked him. She confessed her feelings and they went on one date and it didn’t really work. They continued to be friends and we are in the same friend group. I am a two years older than my sister and the same age as her past crush. My sister has been talking to a guy for the last 8 months (also in the same friend group) and they are a thing. 

Edward is charming, outgoing smart and funny.  Since we are in the same friend group I see him in group settings but have never hung out with him one on one. As I’ve gotten to know him more and as we’ve had conversations I realize I kind of have a crush on him and he is exactly what I would like in a guy/ relationship. I didn’t tell my sister about my crush because I thought it was too soon/ not necessary and i didn’t want to hurt her feelings. Until recently when he started showing signs that he was interested in me. The other day at a party I told him that I think he is sweet and that I like talking to him. I expressed that I liked him and he said the same and that he would like to spend some time together and get to know me. 

I told him at the party that I wasn’t sure how my sister would feel about that but that I was interested in him back. I mentioned to my sister over the phone that Edward asked me out for coffee and I didn’t know what to do, she said “do you like him seriously? or is it just for fun?” and I told her that I am interested in at least going for a coffee and knowing him better because I enjoy talking to him. She said “I don’t know, it was just a big crush, one you don’t get over easily.” I told her okay. Later that day she told me “actually I thought about it more and it would make me feel weird if you talked to him” 

selfishly her telling me that this made me sad because that meant I could not pursue him. but as the days go by I’m feeling frustrated like I’m not allowed to listen to my feelings and like I can’t “live my life.” He is very sweet and kind and I don’t know I feel like we see eye to eye and like we kind of view life the same way. I have struggled with finding people who truly understand me in the past and it is frustrating to meet someone who checks the boxes and I can’t do anything about it. 

I am aware I sound like an asshole but I just wish my sister wasn’t a factor at all in this equation. of course I don’t want to hurt my sisters feelings but I also think sometimes two people are compatible and you should listen to that

1htzkin,https://i.redd.it/vrf3nak6d4be1.jpeg,Scentari Perfumes - Initial impressions and short review ,"Dapper Barber - It’s similar to Roja Danger and the most complex among all. It has room-filling projection initially. I’ve kept the bottle for maceration and will post its review soon. It’s my favorite from Scentari.


Time to Work - Typical blue DNA with a little minty feel and lots of ambroxan (good for safe office wear). It performs well too.


Tobacco Whisper - This is probably the safest tobacco blend. It feels very soft and light, and in the drydown, it smells soft and sweet. I didn’t like it initially, but yesterday I was wearing this, and I liked it. I was also getting whiffs of it throughout the day (projection is very soft).


Tropical Fantasy - Another fresh scent, but it’s fruity and juicy (without being overly sweet). I personally don’t enjoy these kinds of scents much, but it’s good for someone looking for a safe fruity fresh fragrance. I get decent performance with this one too.


Mandarin Drift - I only get a citrus mandarin smell from this one. (Today I’m wearing this, but the performance is poor.)


Phoenix Elixir - Again a citrus fresh scent, but it’s a little salty (like marine notes). It’s a bit more challenging than the other two, but I personally like this one the most and even got some compliments with this one.


Vanilla Chronicle - This is the worst. For the first time, I had to rub off a scent after applying it. It’s sweet and very annoying. Surprisingly, it lasts for a very long time—even after washing my hands, I kept getting whiffs of it, and it was actually inducing a headache.


Rosa Mocha - Perfect date scent. Check out my full review of this one - https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiFragranceAddicts/comments/1hr43nv/rosa_mocha_by_scentari_best_budget_coffee_based/


IMO, all these perfumes are high quality and well blended and offer great value for money. Also, the newer collection of Scentari perfumes is more challenging than these. Looking forward to trying more from this brand",20,1736058482.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,12,0.95,False

I know Chinese ATVs are not well liked, but I would like to get some help from people experienced with them for this issue I am having.

I own this Saga-Power 250cc water-cooled Chinese ATV. Its missing its fan for the radiator. I purchased a fan online, and now my issue is finding the correct wire from the wiring harness that the fan connects to. I found a brown and black wire that is not connected to anything, but I am curious if this the correct wire. I suspect it is because I found this diagram on Amazon, which indicates that the wire connection from the harness is brown (indicated coffee colour) and black. 

  
Any help is much appreciated.

I got really fed up with crappy food served at ""BREKKY"" places for crazy prices. Let's go through some of these questionable institutions:

* Popular BREKKY-coffee place, Sydney North West: it was recently purchased by a new owner so I wanted to check it out to see what's new. Ordered salmon benedict for $28, and what do you think? Two eggs lazy thrown on a soggy toast, with a bit of sauce and spinach on top that tasted like crap. HOW IS THAT FARKING **$28**??? And this place is quite popular amongst locals and has high ratings on google reviews. It's not some dodgy-looking greasy spoon on the back street of St Marys with $10 meals, so you'd expect some quality for the money.
* Popular high-rated BREKKY place in Central Coast: **$17** for salmon bagel. Soggy piece of 2-day old bread with a bit of white cream (cheese?) and salmon on top. A bit of dill and cappers, and it all tasted like it sat in the fridge for 3 days. Well at least it's $17, not $27.
* Popular BREKKY / bar in Nelson Bay: burger with dry bacon and tasteless egg inside. And a bit of aussie-favourite cheapass MasterChef BBQ sauce from Coles of course. How much? The whole **$22**! You could buy a better burger at train station for half a price, but it's a BREKKY FARKING PLACE SO YOU HAVE TO PAY DOUBLE!!!!

I could continue, but let's take a break from dry pieces of bacon mixed with uncooked mushrooms that are sold to us for **$24**, and look on the opposite side of spectrum:

* Korean restaurant in a shopping mall, Chatswood. For under **$13** I got a big bowl of tasty kimchi rice with tasty (!) stir-fried beef on top, with some green veggies. Took 30 seconds to prepare, I didn't even have time to walk to the table and it was ready. HALF A PRICE OF THE FARKING SALMON BENEDICT THAT I DESCRIBED EARLIER!!!! Two times more food, ten times better tasting, TWICE CHEAPER!
* Central Coast: Korean restaurant at the shopping mall. Same as above. **$13** big meal that tasted amazing. Kimchi fried rice that comes with ALL TIME AUSSIE FAVORITE FRIED EGG. Makes much better breakfast (and cheaper) than everything I listed above.
* Sydney North West, indian food take away. **$17** for two curries on rice plus cheese naan. It's not super high quality, but tastes good and a decent size meal.

I'm not proposing to have korean food instead of breakfast (although to me it's not a bad idea), that's just an example of quality and price difference. Again I can provide more examples, but you might get tired from my whining. Let's conclude.

**To conclude.** Am I the only one in the current economy who doesn't want to pay $25 for a poorly prepared meal? And that's the majority of highly rated \_\_BREKKY\_\_ places that I visited. What's so special about BREKKY that you have to pay so much for a piece of avocado on toast with scrambled egg on top that in most cases doesn't even taste good? THESE ARE SIMPLE DISHES THAT ARE SUPER EASY TO MAKE AND SHOULD TASTE GOOD, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU PAY $25+. Why buy overpriced food BREKKY place when you can buy a breakfast-like meal at Asian take away for half a price? What am I missing about BREKKY places? Is that some social thing that people are willing to spend so much? Or is it for reach people only who don't care about price? Or is having a BREKKY such a deep part of Australian culture that folks are willing to overpay just to have a BREKKY meal?

**FAQ**:

* **""Some places do make really tasty breakfast meals"".** I couldn't agree more. For instance, there's a well known cafe in Nelson Bay that is a part of a furniture store (don't ask me why it's like this), which make such a tasty salmon bagel that it completely blew my mind and made me forget I paid $26. It looked and tasted like a meal from expensive European restaurant. Problem is that in my expereince only about 1 in 5 BREKKY places make these kind of meals worth their money. But all of them charging 5-star restaurant prices.
* **""Cook it yourself, stupid"".** I agree and that's what I'm doing 29 days a month (funny enough my food tastes better than the places I described above). But my point stands: what if I want to go out for BREKKY once a month just to switch things up?

**TLDR**: most ""BREKKY"" cafes suck for what they offer at their price range and are easily beatable by most asian food takeaway. Prove me wrong.",51,1736058149.0,AskAnAustralian,71,0.77,False

So, my life's been a real rollercoaster the past couple of years. I graduated college with a bachelor's degree...but then realized I was trans. That journey completely knocked my life and career off course. Mostly bc my dysphoria became bad enough to give me amnesia and make me unable to function consistently. But also bc I live in a red state.

I ended up not looking for a job in my field bc I knew I wouldn't be able to handle looking for a job competitively, while making sure I also wouldn't be fired at said job for being transgender, and making sure I got insurance that covered everything. All on top of being forced to be around - at the time - transphobic family. So, I've been working at a coffee shop for the past 1.5 years. I can't really complain, bc I have private insurance, and good tips bc it's a busy store. Had a couple of transphobic coworkers and regulars, but other than that not treated like shit.

But...now that I'm passing and finalizing my legal changes, I know I'm outgrowing this place. Not just bc I'm overqualified. But bc I'm also tired of coworkers staring at me when they think I can't see, bc they still can't comprehend how much I've changed on T. I'm tired of being clocked as a gay man (which I am) and being treated like shit by male customers for it (I am treated worse by men as a visibly gay man, than I ever was when presenting as a cis woman, lol). The major upsides are my insurance, and working around so many other queer people.

I don't feel disappointed in myself. I have done my best given the circumstances. I even have some savings. But...fuck. How do I navigate trying to stealth at work in this massive wave of trans hatred, while in a red state? If someone does a background check, they're gonna know. If my marker gets reverted by the state, they'll know. And on top of that, I don't want to work a ton bc my mom is elderly and needs my help with stuff.

Idk. I'm just so tired. I honestly might just stick around here for my own peace of mind for the private insurance. And peace of mind, so I don't have the stress of job hunting while dodging transphobia, all while wonder how bad it's going to get here while I can't get out bc I'm a caretaker.

She doesn't need them to see.  Unless... she has a secret identity but I know that ain't the case because if she did have one, it's the worst kept secret in DC.
The nest issue she gets jumped by her villains in broad daylight while in civilian clothes so they all know who she is. 
So does she just like how the glasses look on her?


Glasses aside, WHY IS SHE LIVING IN AN APARTMENT BUILDING?!?!?!? SHE HAS NEIGHBOURS AND NO SECRET IDENTITY, WITH THE SOVEREIGN SQUADRON ON HER TAIL!!! Not to mention she is a political figure aswell. It seems kinda reckless. She should have her own private home(and it should be a good distamce from her nearest neighbour). It's not like she can't afford one. If your too broke for a home you should have a secret identity. What of her villains attack her apartment and her neighbours get hurt? It's not like her villains are some moral saints like Flash rogues. They would stoop that low.

If you say she needs a public identity for work, you are wrong. She doesn't. Diana Prince can still be an ambassador from Themyscira and a princess while Wonder Woman can be the symbol of the Amazon message and philosophy while also they are both separate people in the eyes of the public. Her job doesn't affect her superhero identity at all.


Her having a public identity is actually more detrimental to her professional, personal and superhero life. People she knows can get attacked by villains and terrorists and unless Diana has spared no expense to secure those people homes, transport and places of work, they are in danger.

Also if WW is seen being chummy around the civilian identities of other Superheroes, their identities are at risk too.

Princess of the Amazons had coffee with mild mannered daily planet reporter? SUPERMAN CONFIRMED! The headlines would go crazy.
So she can't hang out with friends unless they are all in costume. Which blows.

At the very least, give her a private home that's far enough away from neighbours that any attacks on her home would not affect someone else.

 Very few heroes can make public identities work and unless WW is putting her resources to damn good use she is not one of them, imo.

So give her back her secret ID

After turning down another invite, I broke down—I really wanted to go but was so afraid she’d give up on me. In a leap of faith, I sent her a text explaining that I get flares and apologizing, saying I’d love to still get coffee when I’m feeling better. Her response, though simple, made me cry.
