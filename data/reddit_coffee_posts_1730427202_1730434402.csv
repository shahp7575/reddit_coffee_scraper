1ggx9bs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ggx9bs,Delta One flights from JFK to LHR are incredible,"Delta has really upped their game. They now have a dedicated Delta One check-in area to private security lane that leads you straight to the lounge from the very start.

Then, the JFK Delta One lounge. Pumpkin cheesecake was the best thing I had all night (I found it it really cute how they decorated it like a slice of cheese).

Solid express meal service for the midnight departure that was done in under 30m, and honestly I could've skipped it and eaten more in the lounge instead for more sleep.

The Virgin Atlantic Revivals lounge to top it all off is what makes it so great. The food (bacon roll + chia pudding in the last pic) was excellent. And I would actually recommend skipping the inflight breakfast for extra sleep on the plane since East Coast flights are so short as well.

The service is what really nailed it though. The Virgin Atlantic lounge attendants were super friendly and thoughtful. They proactively offered to pack us to go food and coffee towards closing time as we were heading out.

My only minor gripe is the constant plane swaps from Delta and Virgin. They keep plane swapping and the seat configurations are very different in Delta One/Upper Class.",1,1730434267.0,delta,0,1.0,False

I have tried taking the maximum dose of stool softener two days in a row, I have tried chugging tons of water, I have tried eating pears, squatting, drinking hot coffee, massage for constipation, yoga for constipation and eating foods that usually make me urgently have to go to the bathroom but there has still been no actual output for 3 days now. I will be trying a hot bath (shallow of course) and a laxative as well as hot green tea but does anyone have any other suggestions that may b I haven't listed?

1ggx6yq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1ggx6yq/creditdebit_card_options_for_parent_with_dementia/,Credit/Debit Card Options for Parent with Dementia ,"Hello, I hope this is the right place to seek advice. I'm currently acting as the enduring power of attorney (EPOA) for my father, who has been diagnosed with dementia. He lives in a retirement home where are all utilities are included and all meals are provided, but still enjoys a relatively high degree of independence. The facility is downtown and he enjoys going out for coffee, the occasional meal, etc. Unfortunately, he has become increasingly prone to extravagant spending and is likely the target of elder financial abuse.

When I went to RBC to put the EPOA in place they told me that there two options were:

(1) Maintain the status quo, wherein in my father has total control over his credit card, savings, and chequings accounts and I have almost line of sight into his spending.

(2) Close all his accounts and create a single chequings account, accessed with a debit card under my name that reads ""Power of Attorney."" 

While we tried to maintain the status quo for a time, my father has become incredibly frustrated by even the slightest perceived incursions on his independence. He refuses to share the bank login information with me and actively blocks all efforts at setting up a cooperative arrangement. He is increasingly convinced that I have enacted the EPOA not to ensure his safety, but to access his money (despite not having touched a cent since this process began!) 

Does anyone have any experience handling something similar? Any useful resources they could point me towards? I want to ensure he is able to go out for coffee, buy books, and take taxis to necessary medical appointments, but his spending is out of control. Multiple medical professionals have highlighted that he lacks poor insight and judgment in decision-making. I know I should have taken action sooner, but he becomes enraged when I do take any kind of steps towards limiting his freedom.

Some important context, I live in another province. It is not feasible for me to move home to care for him. I am the only member of my family who lives in Canada. He has always been a difficult person and so does not have any friends I can call upon to assist him. I am reluctant to give him cash because the opportunity for him to be taken advantage of is quite high. Ideally, I would stay with RBC, because I think he would forget if I tried to switch to another bank.

Right now, I'm in a place where I can't quite find the girl I'm looking for. To say a bit about me, I'm a college student on the East Coast who loves reading, writing, and playing video games. I know way too much about the Legend of Zelda, but I balance that with a love of the outdoors. I'm a heavy coffee drinker who also loves running. I can get into pretty much any TV show and I love movies old and new (I have preference towards sci-fi and historical fiction). Some of my friends call me an ""old soul"", but I don't think I fit that mold perfectly. I've always appreciated working (I've had a fair amount of jobs that I've enjoyed), but like spending time with friends and loved ones more. As for physical characteristics, I'm 6'2, have black hair and green eyes (ok, they're hazel :p), and have an average build.

My last relationship ended in a somewhat rough way, but it's been a bit since then. Although I'm still confused myself on what I want, I'm mainly looking for the possibility of a relationship.

I'm not sure exactly what that looks like, but I'm looking for someone who isn't too much older than me and has interests that are somewhat similar to mine.

Over the last week, my peak was 113, min was 78. 


Does this even count as prediabetic? Does this warrant tracking? I’m looking for new doctors because I’m confused by the “yeah it’s probably not ideal but I think it’s ok” answers.

It had a Lynchian vibe to it, without being as overly abstract and surreal in the same way, I am just talking about how uncomfortable and wrong normal social situations feel in Lynch movies. It was quite minimalistic, the only characters in it are the troubled couple with nobody else ever appearing to exist in the world, there's a bunch of scenes where they're out in public places that are strangely unpopulated except for them (but not in a way where it's ever explained as part of the story, it's more of a surrealism thing). The whole thing feels very cold and miserable and the couple is physically distant from eachother, like they go to a coffee place together and then they sit weirdly far away from eachother.

God this movie really freaks me out for some reason but I can't explain why. I dunno, bad dream. I got some flashes of what the movie was supposed to be like in the dream and it was bad enough to wake me up, it's that fucking miserable, uncomfortable, and even scary.

I don't remember the number but I was shocked that the drawn down was much quicker than I used to have, so I watched the video again and in the end they show a ZP6 and talk about grinding finer... so I tried to go to 3, and was blown away, I never managed to get anything decent this fine with the ZP6, and this was probably the most intense home pour over I've had in the last weeks, I also tried to go even finer, to 2.5, but didn't liked the results, drawn down was still quite fast, below 3 minutes.

I've been grinding with the settings on 3, and as Matt said, got great consistency, the coffee have been tasting clean and delicious. If you have some kind of metal mesh , or even a smaller puck, give it a try.

1. In 2020, Luckin Coffee (LKNCY) admitted to account manipulation, paid a $180M fine, and stock traded from a high of $50 to $1.39 at its lowest, signifying a whopping 97% drop in stock.
2. The stock was delisted for 6 months, and the ticker traded in OTC market. Ironically, the name of the chairman for LKNCY was also called 'Charles'.
3. Since relisting in Dec'20, LKNCY has recovered from its $1.39 lows to $27.13 at the time of writing, showing a mammoth return of 1900% in 4 years. LKNCY is now trading roughly 30% from its ATH after approx 4 years.
4. During the delisted period, LKNCY's price traded from $1.39 to $4, projecting a 287% increase in 6-month OTC markets and a 660% increase upon relisting announcement.
5. This is a coffee franchise with negative P/E until 2022, not some profitable heated industry that could potentially power the future AI growth.

**Now, let's look into SuperMicro (SMCI)**

1. SMCI traded in the highs of $120, a logarithmic drop equivalent to Luckin's would bring SMCI's price down to $3.6. (Scary, I know) but this was when the news broke out, and with the shock at full impact. Personally, I think we've already priced in the news with the E&Y resignation.
2. Realistically, we can expect one more plunge when SMCI is proven and charged, accompanied by the announcement of delisting with a hefty fine. This, of course, is if SMCI is proven guilty.
3. If SMCI were to hit the lows of $3.6, its P/E would be slightly less than 1, 25x times lower than the industry standard, 4x lower now at the time of writing against industry standard.
4. Projecting from the trajectory of LCKNY, a 1900% increase from $3.6 would bring SMCI to $68, a 230% return from today's price (if you buy today) & outperforming the S&P by 170% in 4 years. Every purchase made at drops now will increase the gains, exponentially.
5. Some may ask, don't my shares get wiped out if SMCI goes OTC? We'd only need to look at SMCI's 2018  account manipulation charges. SMCI was delisted for 6 months and re-listed using the same ticker as 'SMCI'. The commons stocks were reinstated to its shareholders.

**So what does this all mean?**

Simply put, you were suddenly transported back to 2020, LKNCY's news broke out fresh, and the stock took a historic, massive plunge.

My school’s recruitment is in spring so i decided to cob and i got a bid from my sorority. I was so excited and I thought I was going to meet a group of girls that i can be friends with. It’s been almost 2 months now and i still feel so awkward. Some of the other cob’s already knew each other so they attend events together and i am friends with one other cob but she’s not that willing to hangout. I asked some girls on coffee dates and even if we have a great time nothing comes after that. I feel like everyone already have their friend groups. I thought getting my big would change this and i got a big that i didn’t even go on a date with. I asked her on a date but she said she was busy that week. I tried to keep an open mind and give her a chance but it’s just not working. Everyone’s bigs got them better baskets, made better reveal themes. I was still positive and thought that doesn’t mean anything but i started to feel like she just didn’t care. My bigs first little dropped and i feel like she doesn’t care about having a relationship with her little. She’s really nice but she’s just absent. On big little reveal day everyone’s whole sorority fam was there but mine. My gbig didn’t come and i still didn’t meet her. My big and i went out the next day with her friends and her friends were nice but they literally wouldn’t talk to me and it was so awkward. She never texted again and we still haven’t went on a date and i feel so unwanted. I made 2-3 ‘friends’ in my sorority but it’s always me who has to ask to hangout. I never get invited to anything, i can’t go to mixers because i don’t have anyone to go with, we don’t really have much sisterhood events. I’m just so stuck and i feel horrible. I feel like I’m paying all that dues just to go to the chapter and feel alone. Also our initiation was before big little reveal so if i knew it wasn’t gonna get better i maybe wouldn’t be initiated.

1ggwnhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/FATTravel/comments/1ggwnhw/review_nayara_tented_camp/,Review - Nayara Tented Camp,"Hi all! I spent a few days at Nayara Tented Camp (and also Nayara Springs and Nayara Gardens) last week so wanted to share an in-depth review :) I’m also a TA on u/sarahwlee’s team and got to spend a lot of time with the Nayara team while on site, happy to answer any questions in the comments!

**Location / Property**

Nayara Tented Camp is located in the Arenal region in Costa Rica, near the town of La Fortuna, it has become a popular destination known for its volcano, rainforest, hot springs, and outdoor activities. The property is stunning and it really feels like a secluded rainforest escape. It’s actually built on reclaimed farmland and they’ve brought back local wildlife with the ecosystem created through their reforestation work.

Tented Camp sits on the same Nayara property along with Nayara Springs and Nayara Gardens. You can think of it as one big resort as it’s all connected and you can hang out anywhere on the property (with the only exception being that Nayara Springs is adults only). Tented Camp is definitely the most luxe of all though, whereas Springs and Gardens lean more chubby. Tented Camp is also the newest, so facilities at Gardens and Springs will show a bit more age. 

Once you get to the property, you can walk around but you’ll rely mostly on the golf carts. The property itself is quite hilly. Carts will come pretty quick after you call, but there may be slightly longer waits during busy times like around dinner hours, I didn’t find it to be an issue during my stay though.

**Arrival**

Getting the bad stuff out of the way first… the drive to the property is tough, there’s no sugarcoating it. It’s around 3 hours one way, from either Liberia (LIR) or San Jose (SJO) airport, through winding mountain roads and you can get pretty carsick. I would recommend bringing dramamine and sitting in the front seat if you are usually prone to car sickness. You can also charter a flight to a nearby airstrip but it’ll still be a 30-45 min drive from the property.

The transfer itself is great though, the driver picks you up at the airport in a comfortable suv with water and wi-fi provided. They’re happy to accommodate any toilet breaks whenever you want just to break up that 3 hour drive a little bit. You can also request a packed lunch.

https://preview.redd.it/xhw09j4ll7yd1.jpg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ed1928869b3b4b319e75e006ca66c2b3378f7e4a

**Rooms**

They did a really good job with the tents here, it’s a beautiful room similar to those you’ll find at high end camps in African safaris. The tents are also fully climate controlled with strong AC. Each tent has a king bed and 2 day beds with a private outdoor terrace, plunge pool, and indoor & outdoor double showers. The plunge pool is filled with natural hot springs and they completely refill and clean the pools between each stay because there’s no chlorine in it. Every tent also has a view of the volcano.

There are 4 rooms types but generally the Nayara Tents all have the same layout. The Family Tent gets you 2 standard tents that are connected with an outdoor walkway. The Private Residences will get you 2 tents with 2 bedrooms each as well as a non-tented villa for a common space with a fully equipped kitchen. The Grand Tent means you're booking half of a private residence (usually avail during low season), so you get a 2-bedroom tent plus the villa common space.

There will be kids at Tented Camp because of their room layouts so if you want to be adults only, Nayara Springs is also a good option. You still get a private plunge pool with all the upgraded amenities that you get at Tented Camp (complimentary laundry service, complimentary mini-bar, etc.). Tradeoffs here will be no volcano view (but you do feel more private because of the vegetation) and no bathtub.

**Food & Bev**

Food & Bev in general is pretty good, but definitely $$$ for the area. There is a casual Costa Rican restaurant, an Italian restaurant, an Asian Fusion restaurant and a Mediterranean restaurant, so there’s good variety if you are spending multiple days at the property. My favs were dinners at the Asian Fusion and Mediterranean restaurants. Going into La Fortuna for food is also an easy option if you get bored of the options on property. You can get breakfast as in-room dining if you want to eat on your terrace with the volcano view, but the menu is slightly limited. 

There are also a few bars and a cafe spread throughout the property, so lots of places that you can just hang out at. Make sure to say hi to Josue at Henry’s bar and ask for his signature coffee highball 😀

**Excursions / Activities**

There are so many excursions and activities that you can do here, and the resort even maps daily on property sloth sightings. Some things are complimentary (e.g. yoga, bird watching tour, frog tour) and some are paid. I did the hanging bridges tour which I thought was fine but definitely do this with their guide if you’re interested in rainforest wildlife, we saw so many animals we otherwise would’ve missed without a guide. Also did the La Fortuna waterfall hike, the Sky Adventures ziplining and the night frog walk, which were all awesome.

Tented Camp also has their own spa and definitely has the nicest spa facilities compared to Springs and Gardens. The treatment rooms are open air and super relaxing.

**Service**

I loved the staff at Nayara, everyone I interacted with was attentive and kind. They have a big focus on hiring local and you can really tell that the people who work there are invested in the property and bring about a sense of natural hospitality. Fun fact, the frog pond was actually an idea brought to the owners by our guide, Ana, and is now such a cool space to see frogs and other wildlife right on property.

**Who is this for?**

* Families with kids - you’ll want to make sure your kids are old enough to do all the outdoor activities in the area
* Couples - also a great place for honeymoons or just a couple’s getaway
* People who want to do something else in addition to laying at a beach - this place pairs really well with FS Papagayo
* People who are interested in safaris and want to test a tented camp situation without committing to Africa yet

**When should you come?**

Dry season is December - April and this is also when most people come. However, if you are ok with rain, September/October is also a great time to come. The rates are lower, you’ll see more wildlife and these are the best months to fully see the volcano as clouds are always moving with the rain.

Bur does the Stranger cowboy also abide, but using another definition of ""abide""?

Dude abides in that he continues on, unchanged.  Despite having his head  stuck in a toilet, being tub-raped by a marmot, and having his rug peed on, he continues on, he abides, smoking weed and taking it easy, same as he did decades go in college.

The Dude Abides having a doctor (presumably) giving an unnecessary penis examination, as well as (possibly) having had his prostate milked for a sperm count.

The Stranger, cowboy, abides in a different sense of the word, ""abide"" for him means to be outwardly tolerant of things he probably finds patently  offensive.  The Stranger is obviously a conservative all-American midwesterner.   From the double take he does at seeing Lebowski, we know the Stranger does not like the drug addled countenance of Lewbowski, but he says nothing, the Stranger abides.

The Stranger says he likes the Dudes style referring to presumably unkempt long hair, unshaved face, and I'll fitting sweater.  But clearly the Stranger does not approve, he would not be caught dead in that sweater, would never grow his hair long, and the Stranger takes pride in his  his moustache and otherwise shaved face.  But he politely tolerates Lebowski.   The Stranger abides.

The Stranger drinks Sasparilla, like rootbeer; he tolerates Lebowski's Caucasian, but we know he must disapprove of the vodka milk concoction. The Stranger might not drink alcohol, but if he did it would be Jim Beam or Jack Daniel's.  But he glances at the Caucasian and Abides.

When Lebowski asks if the Stranger's  aphorism about bears is an ""Eastern"" thing, the Stranger almost  takes it as an afront, but instead gives a chuckle of exasperation, and says ""far from it"".   He feels his wisdom is authentic wisdom from the ranch, not some hoky Eastern Hindu or Budhist saying.   He chuckles quietly, ""have it your way"" and the Stranger abides.

And when Lebowski continues to say ""f*ck"" the Stranger tolerates the lack of respect, and  he abides, and  walks away with his sasparilla rather than express his true feelings.

And the Stranger, while visiting Los Angeles does not approve of L.A., ""it makes no sense"", but he abides and says that is why L.A. isn interesting.   He does not even approve of Dude calling himself ""Dude"" as the term ""Dude"" was once a disparaging term describing a city slicker visiting the countryside.  But the Stranger abides.   

If the Stranger did not abide, he would probably scoff at the Dude just on principle.

The Dude Abides, but so does the Stranger, just in a different sense if the word.

####
Who does not abide?

Walter, pulls gun over a perceived minor bowling rule infraction, does not abide.   Does not abide Iraqi soldiers or Nihilists.

President George H Bush.  , on a TV screen, says about Sadam Hussein's Kuwait invasion ""This will not stand. This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.""    Papa bear Bush did not abide that at all.

And the sheriff of Malibu throws a metal coffee mug at the Dude, he does not abide the Dude's slovenly appearance, ethnic name, or Dude's falling asleep while he (sheriff) is talking.

Cab driver does not abide the Dude's dislike of the Eagles.   

Bunny does not abide farm life and married the elder Lebowski to escape it.

But the Dude, he abides for all of us, and  that just might be enough.

And, my opinion, the Stranger abides as well.

Oh look at me, I'm rambling again.  Catch you later on the trail.

It started when Rancid Spawn played at The Pit, their riffs were so raw they shook the ground. The moment their first chord struck, my heart raced. I was supposed to focus on my calling.  

Smoke went up around The Pit. Just like the agreement.  I followed my calling.  One of the riffs moved me. So I lit the Black Fire.

Of course, the band had been told in advance what we were up to so they'd left the stage, nothing happened to them in case you are worried.  I know they are a popular heavy metal band with some people. Besides I am very careful.  

I only let flow one tiny toothpick tip worth of the Black Fire flow.  But that's all it takes to make the place have a slow smoldering smoke, perfect for on the sly.  People run out as fast as they can anyway.  Black Fire is basically theatrical smoke when used in micro quantities like I do.  Some people dont know this but the smoke is a mild drug.     

And listen, folks, it's smoke and mirrors.   

The Black Fire has many uses.  This is but one.  I just happened to find a way to market micro quantities of my Black Fire.  Rancid Spawn got lots of extra press from it, so dont be feeling sorry for them.  It helps their sales.  And the audience gets a story and who doens't love a good story so I helped them to find that divine spark.  And they got smoked on a mild stimulant because that is what Black Fire smoke is in micro quantities .  The effects of Black Fire are pretty much mild like a cup of coffee, but it really thrills the audience. Makes it more memorable for them.   

It's all done under the table too. Or maybe I should say on the table.  Made to look like an accidental fire.   

Just one more example of what is possible thanks to Black Fire.  I'm lucky I was one of those picked by Mop to sell Black Fire.

It's poetic stuff really.  It  can spreads like night, dragging everything into it's dark abyss.  In it's simple form it can help a band renew audience interest.  It's awakening for everyone.  

At first sight I felt it was divine. The way it ignited, burning everything in its path, purity through destruction was what Mop said and she's right. I thought of my enemies, the hypocrisy surrounding them. It whispered to me, filling my mind with visions of the warm fire that would even the slight. I am the hand of the Lord's judgement. I feel it too.  I know it. The Lord talks in strange ways, you know.   

No one knows it is you when you use Black Fire; no fingerprints, no evidence. Just ashes in the wind. 

I watch the flames rage, and my heart pounds with glee. This is divine inspiration at it's finest.

I will not go deep into madness, like some of the others that got into Black Fire.  The fire is just more my instrument. I use it where it will make me the most money back.  But  I admit, as the flames devour,  I feel this joy that can't be beat.  It's so strong in me, why else would I have this euphoria coursing through me from the flick of the flames?  The Lord intended it, that's why.  In chasing the divine flames, Black Fire has given me everything I was missing. I am alive now.  Who can tell me that is wrong?   And in the end, the ashes are just a chance for renewal.  Just like Mop said. ",1,1730431320.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

For background: My husband and I are looking for fixer uppers in our area as owner occupants. We found a house that we liked back in September. It needs a lot of work. We also met the neighbors and coincidentally we had a friend in common. We put in an offer a day or two after we saw the house and unfortunately the seller went with another offer. 

A few weeks pass and I run into the neighbor (wife) in a coffee shop and we started chatting about how my husband and I missed out on the house and she hinted that I shouldn’t give up hope- she’s not sure the sale is going to go through as she doesn’t think a bank will be willing to finance a mortgage due to the current state of the house. She also let me know that the closing date was going to be 10/25/24. We exchange phone number and keep in touch, meeting up to celebrate our mutual friend’s milestone. 

 10/25 passes and the house is back on the market. The seller was notified that the sale wasn’t going to go through the day before closing.

We went to another showing of the same property on Monday 10/28- the property was cleaned up a bit better than the last time we saw it and we decide we still want to try. We submitted a cash offer yesterday. As we were told by our agent that the listing agent was expecting another offer. 

The neighbor texted me last night to see where we stood in the offer- I replied that we submitted an offer and she responded that the seller doesn’t know about it.

Fast forward to today and we haven’t heard anything back within 24 hours of submitting the offer. My agent says that the seller intends to “Present the offer at 5pm today”by 8 pm we still don’t have any communication, I’m chatting with the neighbor and she says that the seller has no knowledge of an offer and is still offering showings in the property. 

My agent texts me that the selling agent is trying to get in contact with the seller but hasn’t gotten a response.

 After a little more chatting via text with the neighbor, my agent texts me to say that the seller apparently has the offer in her email. By now it’s after 9pm and it’s likely the seller is sleeping because she wakes up early for work. 
 
If it’s relevant both my agent (who is actually an acquaintance of mine) and the sellers agent both work under the same brokerage. 

Why doesn’t the seller know about our offer? Should I continue to sit tight, or should I call someone out about what is happening? Who would I even talk to about this?",0,1730430872.0,RealEstate,5,0.33,False

My ‘single issue vote’ goes towards denying Trump the opportunity to expand the powers of the presidency, sew tyranny and dissolution among the population, and make my country look foolish on the world stage. Fuck him.

What i want to discuss is this elephant in the room. Perhaps its not an elephant to you, maybe its just a rather smelly dog, or a mouse, maybe a fly on the wall. Its the talking point that “inflation is so terrible, oh goly its so bad people are suffering the inflation”

I agree with Destiny, and it is, in fact, imperically true that our economy is doing well. The fed is cutting rates, unemployment is low, people are buying and selling and building homes. So whats my hang up?

I remember a term that used to get thrown around alot when i wasnt even interested in politics: ‘Purchasing Power’. I believe it is true, if only anecdotally, that the ‘purchasing power’ or your average american has decreased significantly.

Its my understanding that this community comes from a wide variety of backgrounds, though many of you likely have middle class upbringings, so perhaps your experience is wildly different from mine.

However, i was born and raised very poor. My outcomes, as they are, can be traced back accurately to my upbringing. Ive been making about 38-42k a year, living on my own since i was 18 years old, so its been about 12 years ive been making the same income.

There have been windfalls and some emergency expenses that have kept it tight, but ive always gotten by just fine. Ive always enjoyed my work, had time for family and friends, relationships and pets; my credit score went up 42 points in the last 2 years. In my early 20s i struggled with a wide variety of addictions, now i only smoke 2 grams of weed a week! Im like, doing pretty good! So whats the issue?

Frankly, i just cant afford a god damn thing. I go to the gas station, and the gas aint bad, but a coke from the fountain machine is like $4.00 im like damnnmn… get an arizona? $1.87?! Boy wtf kinda shit is that?

Looking around on how to save some money, maybe get a new apartment, there is NOTHING cheaper than the unit im in nearby; and i live in a shoebox. I know i need to make more money and now that im older, im willing to learn any skill that would help me earn more, but i just feel stuck. How am i supposed to pay for school when buying brakes for my car is putting me into a 3 month hole of financial chaos?

Idk DGG, just feeling a bit strung out. As i poor white man, where i hear other poor white men complain about inflation, its cringe, but i also understand. As Destiny has said in the past, there are alot of different factors that contribute to someones outcomes, and no ones personal finances are dictated by the economy in a direct sense. 

But i do feel like low IQ, low income whites dont get any peace of mind from the democratic party, or from their pundits when they voice their concerns. Its always “stop drinking coffee/smoking meth.” For a moment i thought Pisco might tell an elderly woman to ‘learn to code’ during his twitter spaces a few weeks ago. Why would a fool listen to someone saying “actually, its your fault” when trump is lying and saying it will all get better when i remove the “Enemy Within”?

Democrats have to change up their strategy here. Gotta find a way to give these people a softer landing on the way they feel about the economy. I dont have the answers as im not educated in economics, most people arent. Most people are dumb as fuck and just want to feel better about themselves.",3,1730430604.0,Destiny,2,0.8,False

I was seeking friends to have a friendly chat over coffee to discuss  sports and politics. When she replied to my ad, I was able to recognize that it was her.  
  A few days prior, I picked her up from home and we drove to a nearby coffee shop to chat.
After I received my order after hers, she abruptly disappeared without me knowing or saying anything to indicate her alternative plans.

At first, I thought she was in the washroom, but after more than ten minutes of waiting, I became concerned. 
I called her cellphone number and she wasn't answering. 
Was she unconscious? She did tell me previously that she used to have an addiction problem.

Eventually after almost 1 hour of waiting, I see evidence that she is reading my text messages and not responding to them. 

So when she contacted me on my ad, I thought about my response carefully. First, I identified myself and expressed how I felt on that date. My attempt was to be gentle, but still leave the door open if she wants to see me again.

Instead, I got a message that was meant to personally attack me, but also filled with excuses on why she did it. 

Among the reasons she gave me include: 

.I didn't buy her coffee on our date. After she yelled at me on the phone when I went to the wrong address that she gave me, I wasn't going to buy her coffee. 

. my clean car wasn't clean enough.

. she felt that she carried the conversation too much. Yes, getting yelled at and going through the anxiety of finding her place made me feel gitterly. However,  sitting down and slowly talking to each other would have helped made me feel comfortable.

Overall, I learned people like her are everywhere; they don't take responsibility for their behaviour and everything they do is justified for self-serving reasons. 
 It was tempting to reply with something that could challenge her to be a better human being. Even in a gentle way, I am responding to someone that is allowing their emotions to guide their decision making.
Writing a rebuttal to her latest message wouldn't be helpful. I don't believe she would read it fully or appreciate what I am trying to say. It would be picked a part and laughed at to make me upset.

 Currently, at almost 40 years old, she isn't capable of communicating with any decency. She is always posting ads looking for friends and not having much success.
 
So, the only remedy left for me to do is avoiding further communication and let her figure it out for herself.
 
The first step is acknowledging a problem, and, right now she can't see that in herself.

So this was back in August, I had an optometrist appointment for new glasses and a new updated prescription at target. I went and I got it done, I got new glasses, they're much better. But a week after getting my glasses, it's on a Friday, I suddenly got a headache, it was really tiring, maybe it was the fact I got drank almost 3 cups of coffee that morning or maybe just a random headache, so after getting home around noon, I wanted to stay home and my dad was pending on making two different trips to pick up two different family members. Suddenly my dad doesn't leaves and suddenly doesn't pick up anymore so I have to go with my headache. It was a ROUGH two drives and that night I random was playing video games when suddenly I saw a spot around the center of my vision like an after image but it wouldn't go away  so I braces for impact thinking it was going to be an ocular migraine but nothing and this lasted like two hours so I obviously freaked and maybe in my little freak out I was becoming too hyperaware that I feel I started seeing more floaters or at least acknowledging the ones I always had but it was a horrible night mentally but they went away yet my eyes still felt like they were throbbing and shaking. That was August 24 and since then I've noticed my eyes have stayed feeling throbbing, shaking, vibrating, whatever the word is. My vision has this grainy aura around the bottom and top and sides. Not the type of aura that you get during ocular migraines mind you. That aura I personally feel you can't even see your hand in places under the aura. This is more like just film grain kind of. I've always been an anxious person so this has made my health anxiety sky rocket because I don't know if this started then or it's always been this way but hyperfixation has ruined me to see it always now. What I mostly notice is this flicker around the center. Things I stare at don't flicker in the light but the things around do. Like if there's a ceiling fan ruened on. That type of flicker. And when i close my eyes I feel I see twitches and faint flashes and lots of visual snow it's made ot harder to sleep. In general this has affected my mental health really bad and I feel so dissociated and depersonalizated at times. But there's moments where I'm so distracted that I don't notice it or remember it even when I'm driving I don't see it. Those moments make me realize it may not be serious. I did an MRI/MRV only because I had one scheduled from July since I had migraines all month and I'm seeing the results Nov 8 and a neurologist November 21. It's also been quite the year. Since March I've been with my mom since she was diagnosed with cancer and all the terrible changes and surgeries that come with it BUT she's cancer free as of now but going through a really rough chemo treatment which has taken a lot on us too so I'm stress and anxiety is definitely NOT off the table here. My shoulders and neck have been so stiff and painful. I freaked out a bit about my optometrist visit because she dilated my eyes and I left and I think she forgot to give me the visor because I never got one and that walk to the car and ride home made me feel so scared of eye damage from the sun but I kept my head down and eyes closed and covered the whole way but I stayed with the anxiety that it may have damaged me a bit but I know that can be silly to worry about so much. I just have terrible anxiety that I'll go blind or something. I just have a fear it's a tumor or I'm going blind but my opthalmologist saw me and didn't dilate my eyes but he didn't notice anything off except a bit of inflammation behind my eye which I've had and have been treated for with diamox a few years ago but he thinks it could maybe be IIH again but without the eye pains I had before when I first got diagnosed.

We tell each other everything, including our secrets, except for one: how I stalked him before I made my move.  Title: How I Stalked My Husband.A few years ago, I was sitting in my favorite café when I first laid eyes on him—let’s call him Jake. He was at a corner table, engrossed in a book, and I was instantly captivated. He had this charming smile that made my heart skip a beat, and I thought, “I have to know him.” At first, I didn’t plan to stalk him. I just thought I’d keep coming to the café and hope to run into him. So, I made the café my second home. I’d strategically choose a table near his, pretending to read or work while stealing glances. Every Tuesday and Thursday, like clockwork, he’d show up for his cappuccino.I did a little digging on social media. I found mutual friends and started following them to learn more about him. I discovered he loved hiking, so I joined a local hiking group that I knew he was a part of. I didn’t want to seem too obvious, but my excitement was building! Finally, during a group hike, I spotted him. I casually introduced myself, trying to act cool, but inside I was freaking out. We hit it off! After that, I started suggesting hikes and coffee outings with the group, hoping to spend more time with him.One day, I mustered the courage to invite him to grab coffee—at the same café, of course. To my delight, he agreed! As we chatted, I found out he was just as charming and funny as I had imagined. We shared stories, laughs, and before I knew it, we were spending more time together.Fast forward a few months, and our friendship blossomed into something beautiful. I never told him how I had stalked him but I think it made our story more interesting. Eventually, during a romantic dinner, he took my hands and asked me to marry him.I said yes, of course! Our wedding was a celebration of how a chance encounter turned into a lifelong love. So, while my initial approach might have been a little unconventional, it all worked out in the end.And that, Reddit, is how I went from secretly watching a cute guy at a café to marrying him!

I often work out of that coffee shop (for a couple years now - say 3-5/times a month). She’s always so sweet and always tries to hook it up (free drinks etc.). We’ve barely chatted in all this time; but I get her gifts as a thank you every so often. 

Unfortunately, I don’t seem to attract women my age. The majority of interest I get from woman is 18-25, and 40+. 40-25 is somewhat of a dead zone for me. I’ve never really figured out why. I don’t really entertain 40+, as they often have lifestyles that are not in sync with mine. Under 25 just feels strange, and I’ve limited the interaction unless the woman is really aggressive and I’ll give it a go.

With the barrista, I feel conflicted. We likely have nothing in common, but I just strangely feel drawn to her. It’s an energy that I don’t feel with others. But I can’t get over the age difference. Hence 2 years and no real convos. I also relate 0 to the TikTok generation; so it just feels like a dead end. On the hand, I won’t know unless I give it a shot. But I also would feel creepy being seen with her in public. I look a little younger; but no less than 35.

I just feel like I didn’t pass enough for it to be complete? My biggest fear is having an incomplete miscarriage and getting an infection or complications before my follow up in 2 weeks.

1ggvn34,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ggvn34/should_i_leave/,Should I leave? ,"Never used reddit but I'm sinking so here I go. Gonna give as much info as possible. My husband (35M) and I (34F) met when we were 18 and 19 and have been married 11 years. We used to party a lot and we were total stoners. Since getting married, I went to college, got a degree and kind of gave up the pot. I still smoke occasionally on weekends and am not a pot hater but we have two kids now so it's not a priority.  He is still a daily smoker. No problem except it holds him back from achieving anything and he spends about $60-$100 a week on it.  He has a decent job but no financial goals, no retirement, and no plan for the future. The job he works now he works strictly bc they don't drug test (he would never admit this). He is so smart and capable but he doesn't really seem to want to achieve anything further. I took a job over an hour away a couple of years ago and commute four days a week and work ten hour days. I took this job after he lost his job from failing a drug test. I was pregnant and we were trying to pay two mortgages at the time (another long story). I felt like I had to step up and take financial responsibility bc I couldn't depend on him. Over the years we accumulated about $12000 in credit card debt. About a year ago I decided I was done paying credit cards off and consolidated it. I've been paying $800/ month since then trying to pay it off. I pay all the bills, manage the house, and do almost everything for the kids. The man wont even make his own hair appointments. I. Am. Tired. Almost all of my check is gone as soon as it hits the bank from bills. About 1/3 of his monthly income goes to the sitter and he  pays for some of the groceries. I also buy groceries when I have anything left from my check. Just for reference he makes about $46000/ year and I make about $80000/year. Trying to pay the credit cards plus all the bills is pretty much all of my income. We have put a little money back on the cards that I consolidated, so that sucks, but he had one card in his possession. I just checked the balance on the one card that he has and since September it has increased by almost $1800. We did agree to put a gift for our son's birthday that was about $400 but almost everything else was him eating out for lunch and spending at the convenience store. I bring my lunch everyday, make my coffee at home most mornings and for the most part live pretty frugal. There are so many other things that I do to try to save money that he counteracts but it's too much to list.  When I checked the balance to pay the bill on the card that he had in his possession, I had to hold back tears. I have been working so hard to try to get us out of debt and was totally shocked that the balance had increased so much. To have someone who is supposed to be a partner spend so frivolously without any consideration of how it's gonna get paid back was the proverbial straw that broke the camels back. There are a lot of other things too, like us having a set amount of money that we have to share for the week and him spending 75% of it in 3 days. This leaves me with no money for gas to drive to my job and forced to put that on credit cards. He also still makes sure he buys weed as soon as one of our checks hits the bank before we even pay bills or buy groceries. In full transparency, I do drink beer more now instead of smoke but only on the weekends and I make sure I buy my beer at the grocery store bc the convenience store is a rip off. Thats cost about $20/weekend. We also both smoke cigarettes (gross I know) but i smoke about 1/2 a pack to his two packs daily. I also reload my Starbucks card every two weeks and put $20 on it. Pretty much everything extra I have is spent on the household or our kids. I just don't understand how he can constantly put smoking pot over getting a better paying job and spending $40/day at the store and on lunch. That proverbial straw that broke the camels back finally ended in me asking him to leave.  Part of me is excited at the possibility of having financial freedom one day and not having to take care of him like a third child.

Having said that, right now in my life I’m lacking that special someone, as cliche as it may be.

I’m a bit of a hopeless romantic and still kinda believe there is someone out there for me.

I’ve done the online dating apps and it’s not really for me. Browsing profiles and swiping left or right is a weird experience for me. 

“Ah yes this girl looks cute, likes coffee, gym, walking and movie/music, I’m sure we will be a great match based on allllll of this information.” 

L O L 

You get the point, so I’m here on Reddit, I’m sure some people at this point are rolling their eyes, but frankly put I’ve had many more great conversations on Reddit with people than I’ve ever had with people on dating apps. 

A little about me; 

My interest, creative writing, music, video games (don’t have much time as I used to for it ), going for walks/hikes/drives, beach combing, art and small art projects. Mental and physical well being. 

I work overnights, I’m up when people are asleep and asleep when people are normally up, probably another reason why I am choosing Reddit to look for romantic interest.

I stand 6’0, weigh about 195lbs, average body. Dark brown eyes, shaved head, beard that’s a mixture of black and grey. 

I pride myself on working hard and doing my best whatever it is I choose to do. I value honesty, loyalty, a great sense of humour and respect. You can expect the same from me.

1ggvds9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ggvds9/my_morning_commute_did_not_take_me_to_work/,My morning commute did NOT take me to work.,"Monday January 8th 2024 started out just like any other day. The only notable thing was that it was my first day heading back to the office after my employer had shut down company operations for 3 weeks as they did every year during the holidays. The seasonal depression was really starting to kick in now that all the fun was over and we just had another three months of freezing rain to look forward to before summer. Winter used to be my favourite season as a kid but due to climate change it's just become depressing. It hardly ever snows anymore here in the GTA so everything is just cold, grey and damp all the time, today being no exception. 

Traffic on the 404 was actually moving at a decent pace for once this morning despite the weather. I was torn between being happy that I wasn't stuck in the typical morning gridlock and being slightly disappointed that I would actually make it to work on time. As I approached the 401 interchange where the 404 turns into the Don Valley Parkway the rain began to come down a lot harder. The dump truck I'd been following began to slow down, as did the rest of the traffic around me. I could have sworn I heard thunder over the roar of the rain pelting my windshield. ""Thunderstorms in the winter time?"" I thought to myself. It didn't make sense but then again it was also supposed to be -10 and snowing this time of year not 6 degrees and pouring down rain so I guess anything is possible.

I began pressing down on the brake pedal to slow my car to the speed of the truck in front of me when suddenly my foot slammed into the floor. I immediately panicked thinking I had lost my brakes and I took my right hand off the steering wheel to reach for the emergency brake. When I'd first started driving my dad had taught me a trick where you can hold down the button on the emergency brake so it doesn't lock and you can feather it on and off to slow down if you ever lose your brakes. I was about halfway through executing this plan when I froze. I froze because I realized something. The hand I had taken off the steering wheel hadn't been holding the steering wheel at all, and neither was the other one. In fact I wasn't even in my car. My brain finally caught up to my surroundings and I realized I was sitting in a plastic classroom chair in the middle of what appeared to be a warehouse. I was sitting in the chair with my arms out as if I was a kid pretending to drive a car, except I was actually driving a car, or at least I had been just mere seconds ago. Had I just blacked out on the entire drive to work? I did work at a logistics company but this did not look like our warehouse.

I slowly stood up and looked around the room. All I could see around me were wooden crates and plastic Pelican cases that looked vaguely like military gear of some kind. The only other object of note was a big yellow forklift sitting near the end of the row of crates. I began to walk towards it thinking maybe I could find the operator and figure out just what the hell was going on. An electric hum came from the forklift as I approached it. I don't know a lot about heavy machinery but I assumed that meant it was running. ""Hello?"" I shouted out into the vast expanse of the building. Only an echo returned. I peaked inside the cab of the forklift and indeed it was on judging by the position of the key and the gauges on the dash being lit up. This meant someone had to be nearby because I'm sure it's gotta be a massive OSHA violation to leave a forklift turned on unattended. 

I called out a few more times but no reply came. Was everyone out for a smoke break or something? Surely a warehouse of this size would be crawling with workers, at least ours was back at the company I worked for. Figuring everyone was out for a smoke break or at the very least, given the early morning, it was probably shift change, I decided to see if I could find an office of any kind to see if anyone could tell me where I was. I had briefly tried to consult Google Maps on my phone but I couldn't get any signal, likely due to being inside a large steel building. I eventually spotted some windows high up on a wall on the other side of the warehouse and figured that must be the office. As I walked towards it I passed another forklift that looked like it had just been abandoned in the middle of putting a pallet of electronic equipment up on a rack. Just like the other one the electric hum and position of the key indicated that it had been left on. A little farther up the aisle there was a golf cart with a little orange blinking light on top of it. It had crashed into one of the metal support columns holding up the roof of the warehouse and front end was completely destroyed. It just sat there light still blinking as I walked past it. What the hell was going on here? Was there some emergency I was unaware of? I was beginning to get the feeling the staff of this place had abandoned it in a hurry.

Eventually I reached a set of metal stairs that led up to an enclosed mezzanine area that I thought had to be the office. I climbed the stairs and opened the door to find the room completely empty. It was indeed an office but instead of the loud atmosphere I was used to at work it was dead silent. I slowly walked through the rows of cubicles taking note of the steam coming off a coffee cup on one of the desks. People had been here recently. The most telling sign of all though was that every single computer was logged in and open on some excel sheets or software that I didn't recognize. I may not have known a lot about forklifts but I did know a lot about office computers. They time out after 5 minutes or so automatically and go to sleep. When you wake them up again you have to enter your password again. If these computers were logged in it meant that their users couldn't have gone far or been gone for long.

Figuring now that something must really be wrong I quickly scanned the room and found a door with a glowing red exit sign above it. I didn't know how I'd gotten here but the people who worked here had clearly left in a hurry and I wasn't going to stick around to find out why. I ran through the office and tore open the exit door revealing a long hallway. I ran down the the hallway towards another exit sign and just kept repeating the process through door after door until suddenly I was blasted with cold air and snow as I found myself standing in what appeared to be a parking lot. It had clearly been snowing heavily but the blizzard was starting to clear and the morning light was beginning to shine through the snow, although the light was extremely dim and I couldn't actually see the sun in the sky yet. Where the hell was I? It hadn't snowed like this anywhere near Toronto or my home in Newmarket since, well, ever that I can remember.

My awe of the snow was short lived however as I heard the door click shut behind me. My heart sank as I realized it was locked and it looked like it had a keycard reader to open it again. I was wearing a light winter jacket over my usual business suit but it was not sufficient for the weather I now faced. I could hear an engine running from around the corner of the building so I began trudging through to snow towards it. My fancy dress shoes and suit pants becoming instantly soaked as I made my way through knee deep snow. My feet stung with the cold but I didn't care, that engine sound meant someone had to be nearby and they could help me. Maybe it was a fire truck or an ambulance and they had come to deal with whatever disaster had befallen this frigid warehouse. Maybe I would find the office staff huddled around it. I should have known better.

As I came around the corner of the building I almost walked straight into a running snowblower. My efforts to stop myself caused me to fall backwards into the snow and I began to scramble backwards to get out of the way of the machine. Once I had gotten out of the way and gotten to my feet I realized that it wasn't moving. My heart sank again as I stared at the large John Deere tractor sitting in front of me. Much like the forklifts and golf cart I had seen inside the machine was just sitting there idling as if it had been abandoned in the middle of whatever its task was. In this case it looked like it was about halfway done clearing the parking lot. ""Great,"" I mumbled to myself. It seemed that everyone really was gone. At least if that thing had been running for a while the cab was probably warmed up and it could provide some shelter.

I approached the tractor cautiously as the large augers of the snowblower attachment were still spinning and I did not want to encounter those again. Once I was safely alongside however, I practically threw myself up the steps into the cab. The warmth of the heaters felt almost burning compared to the cold outside but I didn't care. It was better than freezing to death. I leaned back in the operator's seat and just lay there for a few seconds enjoying it. Then I noticed something peculiar. There were no footprints leading away from the machine. If the operator had abandoned it as recently as the rest of the complex had been abandoned then there should have been signs of them running away. The snow was also letting up and there was no way it had snowed enough in the 10 minutes or so I'd been in this strange place to fill in the footprints. Hell there should have been footprints everywhere if a large scale evacuation had taken place. Something strange was definitely going on here.

For the first time since my arrival however, I finally felt safe enough sitting in that tractor cab that I could survey my surroundings. The snow had now completely stopped and I could see that I was sitting next to a massive white building at the bottom of what appeared to be a giant open pit mining site. Rock walls rose up on all sides with a spiral roadway leading to the top. There was also a massive radio tower on top of the building that must have been at least 100 feet above the surface level. It appeared to be held up by cables running down to the rim of the giant pit. Seeing the tower I foolishly tried my phone again but there was still no signal. I stuffed it back in my pocket and continued to look around. From what I could tell it looked like this was some kind of research facility that had been built into an old diamond mine. My suspicions were quickly confirmed as I noticed a row of white pickup trucks with the words ""Summer Island Research Facility"" written on the doors and various departments such as security or maintenance written along the sides of the bed. Well at least now I knew where I was, just not where this place was.

As luck would have it there was a much more substantial winter jacket stuffed behind the seat of the tractor and inside one of the pockets was a keycard. With this maybe I could get back inside and formulate a plan to deal with my current situation. I put on the jacket and once again braved the cold and made my way back to the door I had come out of. The light on the door turned green as I tapped the keycard up against it and a loud clunk indicated it was now unlocked. I quickly stepped inside and furiously stomped my feet to try and get all the snow off my shoes and pants. I had a better coat now but I needed to find some boots and snowpants if I was going to go outside again. My new mission was now to find an employee locker room or something where I could find some gear. I wandered up an down the halls finding nothing but empty office after empty office. I was beginning to contemplate my situation more and I wondered if I had in fact rear ended that dump truck back on the 404 and died in a horrible car accident and if this was some kind of purgatory. Even though I had only been here an hour tops at this point my morning commute and even my life back in Newmarket seemed like a distant memory. Was all that even real? Or was this even real? I had no idea how I'd even gotten here and the more I thought about it the more questions I had.

Eventually I stumbled into a lab of some kind. I guessed that this was where the research at the Summer Island Facility took place. There was  lot of science equipment that I couldn't even begin to tell you what it was for scattered around the room and several computer desks all covered in papers. A large whiteboard in the corner of the room caught my attention. It was covered in what I guessed were mathematical equations but mixed in with the numbers were symbols I have never seen before. At the far end of the room was a large glass wall and on the other side of it was a device that slightly resembled a jet engine with the cowlings removed. ""Must be testing something for a new fighter plane,"" I thought to myself but as I drew closer I realized this was not an aircraft engine. The front end where the fan blades would be and the rear where the thrust would come out were capped off completely and what I initially thought were hoses turned out to be thick electrical cables. Every now and then sparks shot out of the machine but otherwise it was completely silent. Had thing thing malfunctioned somehow and that's why everyone left in such a hurry? I was fine so what could be so dangerous. Then a terrible thought struck me, what if this was nuclear and the whole place was irradiated?

I decided my best course of action at this point was to continue looking for the gear I needed then get as far away from this place as possible. While I knew that tractor was still running outside it was slow and I had no idea how to drive a tractor, I needed to find the keys to one of those trucks and get up to the surface and figure out where I was. Luckily for me the locker room was not far from the lab and by some stroke of luck there was a locker open. Judging by the same high-vis winter jacket I had found in the tractor that hung inside the locker this must have belonged to one of the maintenance workers. I took the matching snow pants, boots and gloves out and quickly put them on. Rummaging around a little more I managed to find a hat and some snow goggles as well. I probably looked like I was ready to climb Mount Everest but I guess in a way that's exactly what I was about to do. I found a set of car keys on one of the tables and quickly snatched them up looking them over and noticing the Ram Trucks logo on the side of the key fob. At least it wouldn't take long to figure out which vehicle these were for. So far I had only seen F-150s outside.

I pulled my goggles down over my eyes as I ventured back out into the cold. It was a little brighter out now but it still seemed way too dark for the time of day it should have been by now. I pressed the panic button on the key fob and heart a repeated car horn coming from around the opposite corner to where the tractor was. I followed the sound until I was around the corner of the building and looking at a big Dodge Ram dually truck with a camper in the bed. It was covered in all kinds of antennas and had some kind of radar system on the roof and a big moose bumper with a winch mounted on the front. It had the same ""Summer Island Research Facility"" lettering on the doors and the words ""Mobile Research Unit"" written on the camper that sat in the bed. I remember thinking of my coworker James who wouldn't shut up about his overlanding rig, an old Toyota 4Runner with a collapsible rooftop tent. This truck was his wet dream.

I silenced the alarm and unlocked the vehicle. Climbing into the driver's seat I noticed the interior of the truck looked like a police car. There was a laptop mounted to the center console and all kinds of radio and electronic equipment. There was what appeared to be a CB radio overhead which I turned on and quickly flipped through a few channels but heard nothing. I put the key in the ignition and while the big diesel engine wasn't happy about turning over in the cold it did start. I sat there and let the truck warm up for a minute or two before setting off out of the parking area. Thankfully although the tractor operator had only manged to clear the snow from half of the parking lot it appeared as though the spiral road heading up to the surface had been plowed. Even still it was slow going as I didn't want to slide off the edge and plummit back into the pit. 

It took about 15 minutes but I eventually reached the surface and stopped to survey the area. I put the truck in park and got out as if the windhshield was somehow lying to me about what was outside. For as far as I could see there was nothing but snow. Not a single tree in sight and although by this point it had to be at least 11AM and it was completely clear the sun was nowhere to be found in the sky. The only proof of its existence was the dim light coming from over the horizon that was allowing me to see. Was I in the fucking Arctic??? I let out a frustrated scream. What the hell was going on? I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Just hours ago I had been driving into downtown Toronto and now somehow inexplicably I was on the edge of a research facility at the North fucking Pole???

Off in the distance on top of a hill I could see lights in the direction that the road was heading. Maybe that's where everyone had gone and maybe I could get some answers there. I jumped back in the truck and took off down the bumpy road as fast as I could go in the snowy conditions. My excitement was short lived however as I arrived at the lights and realized they were landing lights for a small airstrip adjacent to the facility. I punched the steering wheel in frustration causing the horn to honk. I had heard there were places in the Arctic that were only accessable by plane. If this was one of them and everyone had gone then I truly was trapped up here. I shut the engine off and rested my head on the steering wheel. I'm a bit ashamed to admit it but I had a complete mental breakdown. I couldn't understand anything that was going on and now I was trapped in one of the most hostile places on earth with no way home.

My wallowing in self pity was short lived as I suddenly heard the sound of an approaching plane. I was overjoyed at the sound of this and immediately got out of the truck and began searching the skies for the incoming aircraft. Much like my self pity my feelings of joy were also short lived as I spotted the plane coming low on the horizon. It was moving far too quickly to be a commercial jet or military cargo plane. No there was only one thing that could be and it was a fighter plane. I don't know a lot about the military but they don't generally send fighter planes on rescue missions. At the same time as realization struck me that this was not the government coming to the rescue but rather a coverup for whatever happened here, the plane fired a single missile at the edge of the massive pit. From my vantage point on the hill by the airstrip I saw it collide with the rock wall and explode sending rock and ice flying into the air. Then what I had initially assumed was solid ground began to collapse into the pit revealing itself to be a frozen body of water. Within seconds the pit was flooded and the impact from the wave pancaked the building and sent the communications tower collapsing to the bottom of the newly formed lake. The plane circled around again heading for the airstrip. I dove back into the truck and hoped the white vehicle would blend in with the snow enough not to be seen by the pilot. It did, or at the very least the pilot didn't think it necessary to destroy a stationary vehicle. The plane fired off one more missile cratering the runway and then flew off again disappearing over the horizon. 

I peeked up over the steering wheel as the last few pieces of rock came down denting the hood of the truck. There was now no way for anyone to even land to come save me but that was the least of my problems. Whatever was going on the government clearly didn't want it getting out. If I was found I would probably be shot on sight even though I had nothing to do with it. My best bet was to get as far away from this place as possible and then try to seek help. My only problem was I still had no idea where I was and all I had was this truck. If there were no roads out of here I was screwed. There probably were snowmobiles in that facility somewhere and I was kicking myself for not trying to find one before the facility got destroyed. Out of desparation I opened the laptop mounted to the truck's console and found that shockingly it was not locked with a password. It seemed this latop served only for navigation but that was fine with me as that's exactly what I needed. Even more shockingly it did appear to have a connection to some kind of satelite system and from that I was able to pull up a map and finally saw where I was. 

I was indeed in the Arctic Ocean on an island roughly 30 kilometres from Tuktoyaktuk in the Northwest Territories. My heart sank upon this realization. If I was on an island then that airstrip really was the only way in or out. If the base hadn't been destroyed I might've been able to survive up here till spring and found a boat or something once the ice melted but it was gone now and I definitely couldn't survive in this truck. Wait a minute, the ice, that was it! The water was frozen over between here and the mainland if I could make it across then I might be able to find help in Tuktoyaktuk. It was a longshot but I had to try. I quickly took stock of the supplies I had in the truck then checked out the camper sitting in the bed. There wasn't much, just a bunch of unhelpful science equipment, a few basic tools, some shovels, and some extra fuel cans which were thankfully full. I tossed all the science equipment out of the back into the snow and tried to make the inside of the camper look as civilian as I could. There were still beds and basic living amenities in there under all the research stuff so I was hopeful I could make it look like just an ordinary truck camper. I then set to work peeling off the vinyl decals and truck numbers and anything else that could tie this vehicle to the facility. I also removed the patches with the facility's logo from all of the winter gear I had stolen. I needed the laptop and radar antennas for navigation but told myself I would ditch those too once I was in sight of the settlement. I had heard the Dempster Highway had been extended to Tuktoyaktuk in 2017 so it was finally connected to the rest of Canada's roads. I could drive south into British Columbia if I made it there but I had to be sure the truck couldn't be easily identified.

I was impressed with how well the truck handled the deep snow as I pushed my way towards the shoreline. I knew any minute I could get stuck and that would be the end but I kept going. It was nerve wracking pulling out on to the ice and I half expected to just immediately break through. I had seen enough Ice Road Truckers on the History Channel to know to take my seatbelt off and drive slow as to not create a pressure wave and crack the ice so I crept along barely going above 40 kilometres an hour. This was a lot different than Ice Road Truckers though. Ice roads are actually maintained it's not like they're just driving on untamed ice, like I was doing right now. It was bumpy and the I could hear the ice shifting and cracking under me as I crossed over the uneven sections. I was sure I was going to break through but after about 2 hours of driving over the uneven ice I saw the lights of Tuktoyaktuk in the distance. I stopped the truck and climbed onto the roof and ripped off the radar antenna then tore out the laptop mount from the cab and took off towards the town. I contemplated going to the locals for help but figured that would only get me arrested so I only stopped briefly for fuel then took off down the long lonely highway headed south. Bob, the guy who ran the gas station was confused as he hadn't seen me come to town but didn't ask too many questions.

I only made one other stop in Inuvik for more fuel but besides that I made it pretty much all the way to Whitehorse in the Yukon in one go. By this point I had been on the road for almost 24 hours straight and was exhausted and needed to rest. I decided to ditch the truck just outside Whitehorse and walk into town and find a room for the night posing as a tourist. Whitehorse had an airport and I could fly home from there the next day. I found an old logging road to hide the truck down. I contemplated setting it on fire but I knew that would draw too much attention so I just abandoned it in the trees, gathered my things and made the hour walk into Whitehorse. My night at the bed and breakfast there was the best sleep I had had in days but sadly I was woken up early the next morning by my phone ringing. I had forgotten I'd even had a phone since over the past few days it had been all but useless to me.

""Hello?"" I sad groggily into the phone. ""Mr. Richards this is Sargeant Powell with the Ontario Provincial Police we have been trying to reach you for the past 2 days."" Said the voice on the other end of the phone. I immediately stiffened up. ""What for?"" I asked, assuming I had been reported missing. ""About the accident you caused at the interchange of the 404 and the 401 on Monday, you rear ended a dump truck and then swerved into the other lane where your car was rear ended by a minivan causing a 50 car pileup. 11 people are dead and many more were injured. We could not locate you at the accident so you have been presumed to have fled the scene on foot which is a very serious offence."" The officer continued. I had almost forgotten that I had been driving to work before all this started. Part of me thought that maybe I had lost some memory or something but from what the cop was telling me it seemed like I had, no that's crazy... There's no way I somehow teleported from the GTA to the Canadian Arctic... But then again that did seem to be what had happened... ""Well I certainly hope you have the wrong person officer,"" I said into the phone trying to regain my composure. ""You see, I'm in Whitehorse in the Yukon right now, visiting my aunt,"" obviously I was not going to tell him why I was really up there, ""so if my car was involved in an accident then it must've been stolen."" ""Is that so Mr.Richards,"" the cop said in a tone that I could tell meant he didn't believe me. ""Well if you have any proof of this I'm going to need it as soon as you return.""

Upon landing at Toronto Pearson Airport I was immediately taken into custody by the police. They did not believe my story of visiting my aunt in the Yukon at all but had to led me go as it was a pretty rock solid alibi and all the receipts from my stay there and my flight home. I just claimed I lost my ticket for the flight there. After my release I fully expected my house to get raided by the SWAT team or something and I'd be hauled in for questioning about my involement in whatever happened at the mysterious base but nothing ever came of it. It seemed the police were really only interested in the car accident and the higher levels of government had no idea I'd ever been up there. My insurance reluctantly paid for a new car and everything went back to more or less normal. Somehow my job didn't even notice I was gone so I still got paid for those days and went back to work as if nothing had happened.

The only problem is, now I know that crazy stuff like this is possible. I don't know what the government was messing around with up there or what happened to all the people at that base, and I'm not sure I want to know. Either way knowing that it's possible to just get plucked out of existence and reappear in another place entirely often leaves me sitting awake late at night wondering if and when it might happen again.",5,1730427683.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Has the Markel case dropped off for most of my favorite YouTubers???,"I realize there is little to report on and the last minute dismissal of Rashbaum and Co. was a massive blow. 

Tallahassee’s DA has let the Markel family down yet again. What a travesty and embarrassment. The fact CA may get a retrial and the delay for convicting DA and letting WA continue to walk free is infuriating. 

Personally I was wrapped up in the Sarah Suitcase trial so following this sub and Markel-related YouTube content took a backseat. 

But I noticed today several regular personalities have dropped off the radar, most notably KatieCoolady, True Lifestyles & Society Page. Where did they go??? Kathy was always a favorite to watch, even when she wasn’t commenting on the Markel case. I hope she’s okay. I miss her morning coffee chats.",9,1730427476.0,dan_markel_murder,11,0.76,False

Their beans are always freshly roasted - the ones I got today were roasted last night, sabi ni Ate. Taste is about the same quality as Sibs (hit or miss), but the service is 💯.

Will still grab beans here kasi super convenient. After mo mag-grocery, amoy mo na agad yung sa stall nila. ☕",1,1730427282.0,CoffeePH,0,1.0,False
