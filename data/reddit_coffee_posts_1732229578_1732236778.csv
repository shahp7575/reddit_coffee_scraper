1gwvd09,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1gwvd09/coming_out_of_the_first_month_it_gets_better/,Coming out of the first month. It gets better.,"In two days is the one month mark of my breakup. The first week I was in shock, and oddly it felt easier than the second and third weeks. Those weeks I felt like I might go insane. I even upped my lexapro by 5mg and started taking trazodone to be able to sleep. I joined a pottery class and MADE myself go. I didn’t care if I cried there. I just needed to be around people. I cried everywhere. The grocery store, the coffee shop, in front of strangers. One day I had to pull over while I was driving and scream cry. I visited friends everyday, I called people everyday. This helps a lot! Call your people, be vulnerable. Tell them you need support. I kept showing up to clay class, I thought about how, if we were still together, he would probably be annoyed I was taking a clay class and not hanging out with him. I took pleasure in knowing I could do whatever the fuck I wanted now, even though I deeply missed him. I’m in the 4th week now. I didn’t need trazadone to sleep last night. I’m inching towards acceptance and starting to get angry at the fucked up way he left me and all the things I couldn’t see when I was in the relationship with him. I wrote them all down and I read the list daily. This helps you ground yourself in reality. I still wonder if/when he will come back, but I’m realizing it’s probably for the best if he doesn’t. I don’t want my nervous system to feel jacked up anymore.   
My brain still wants to ruminate, but I know I just need to let it do its thing and it will stop eventually. Listening to podcasts helps. I’ve been listening to some about a book I plan on reading- The Eden Project: In Search Of The Magical Other. It discusses why we attract the people we do and how our own personal self work will be a must in order to have a shot at a healthy relationship with ourselves and our potential future partner. I am going to be 42 soon, so this breakup hit me pretty hard and demolished my dreams. But I’m relaxing into a state of self work, feeling thankful my nervous system is finally regulating, and knowing that I will be okay no matter what. I even bought a new mattress so that only I have ever slept in it. I’m now going to explore shadow work with my therapist to understand why I keep attracting people that will hurt me and abandon me. I think it’s important that once we stabilize, we catapult ourselves into that self work to give us hope for the future and reflect on the reasons why this one didn’t work out. It’s never too late, friends. And you are not alone.

1gwvari,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gwvari/my_partner_never_has_my_back_when_it_comes_to_his/,My partner never has my back when it comes to his family. AITAH?,"Myself (29 f) and my partner (34 m) have been together for 3 1/2 years. He is an amazing partner and very supportive in every aspect of my life, he's a bit of a fixer of all things and a very logical thinker which balances me out very well.

I have a dysfunctional family background myself and a mental health issues just to be transparent. I get overwhelmed quite easily, have constant fear of rejection and essentially mask my feelings around others. I'm a bit of a people pleaser. 

When I met his family, they were so kind to me and welcoming I was honestly so surprised having been shown little of anything like that before. It took a while to believe I was accepted because of this. there have been a few bumps along the way. 

Partner's mum is a very intelligent and strong character. Her voice is the loudest in the room, she is blunt and can be quite patronising at times but also very funny with quite a dark sense of humour. We often meet up for coffee without my partner around because all in all I feel we have quite a good relationship. However, she has said quite a few things to me over time that have made me quite upset, but in the moment I laugh it off because I don't have the balls to defend myself.

 Last time I visited, she decided to fixate on her best friends daughter and how my partner probably would have ended up married to her if we were in 'arranged marriage times.' She kept digging up their childhood memories together and just wouldn't drop it. Then insisted on showing me photos of her. It's the second time she's said the same thing around me to him and I responded with that, and politely reminded her that I'd been shown a photo of her before now.  My partner said nothing other than jokingly saying 'no thanks'. She then apologised to me in a humourous way after ten or so minutes talking and said she just wasn't thinking. But it hurt me a little, as their opinion means a lot to me and it felt like a bit of a 'fuck you'. This was after finding out she was poorly and travelling an hour to cook them a nice dinner. She's indicated that it doesn't matter if appointments people make with me are cancelled two times in a row and to try to book again because I don't work and my time is less valuable than my partner's. She's said how vulgar she thinks tattoos are when I'm covered in them. When she comes over to our house she tries giving me tips on how to descale / clean things. She tells me off for having not maintained the garden 100% (I'm new to having such a large garden and she knows I'm not very experienced). She asks whether other people are 'educated' as a scale of their intelligence, knowing full well I'm not educated. There are just so many examples I could give of her making me feel like I'm not quite enough. All of which I've told my partner who insists she loves me and I'm just 'thinking too much into it.'

My partner's sister is lovely, but very full on. She talks at a million miles an hour and incredibly loudly, I get cornered into conversation involving her sex life, her daughter's sex life, who she's texting / dating and who she's recently discovered is a POS'. I don't ask for any of this information, it normally starts as a 'how are you' and then completely snowballs from there.

She comes to our house and sends pictures of our home to these men over various apps and it makes me really uncomfortable because I'm quite big on privacy as I have a history of DV which I have mentioned to her a few times. She views every one of my stories on socials within seconds of me posting them, and expressed she was angry at me and my partner for not telling her we were going for a weekend away for my birthday, literally two nights, all because my partner's brother found out before she did (the brothers work together). She's got serious FOMO and feels like she has the right to know everything. There have been so so many comments from her that have upset me, and I don't think it's intentionally to upset. Once she told me she was disappointed to find out i was joining them on a family holiday because her and my partner normally 'couple up' because everyone else is normally in couples. She's fallen out with family members before for them not including her and her daughter as much as she expected in their own weddings. I dread if we ever get married for this reason, I just don't think it'll be about us sadly.


The both of them have moaned to me about my partner's brother and his wife also, who I really like. Criticising everything they do, how they raise their children. Really quite derogatory sometimes. It makes me super uncomfortable because I seriously don't like it when people judge other parents so harshly. They are lovely people who work hard and do their absolute best. I worry it becomes me they criticise openly in the future also. I shouldn't even be worrying about that yet, but here I am.

I understand that families are always a little weird, lord knows mine is. But I'm used to only seeing certain family on my side months apart and not every weekend like my partner does his. I come home and get so torn up over some of the things that have happened with his family at times and it causes arguments between my partner and I. He never once has stepped in and said 'thats enough' when one of them is saying something a bit underhand or making me uncomfortable. I express that I feel anxious ahead of going there and do my best to explain why and he just accepts he will go on his own as a solution and doesn't talk about it any further.

We are trying for a baby and have been for a few months now, our first, and I'm currently on the sofa in tears because I can't bear to be next to him right now. I feel like our dreams are ruined because I can't imagine having a family with someone who simply doesn't know how to set boundaries with family members. I feel he will always just have their side no matter what is said to me. I can never win and feel like his attitude towards it is all wrong, a bit like 'here we go again'. He shuts it down and says his sister is the way she is and it's annoying but won't change and that his mum doesn't mean any offence when she says the things she does. So essentially I should just put up with it all.

The only reason I feel anxious about it is because I feel completely alone when I'm there, he often leaves me with them to talk to his dad elsewhere and I am defenceless. I hate upsetting people and causing arguments or issues but it's such a long list of things they've said and done. I just want the reassurance that I can happily spend time there and I've got a bit of support, that way if it occurs I don't have to go home and suppress it each time, even if it weren't him doing anything in the moment and just agreeing with me that the things they say to me are fucking mental at times and I'm right to feel a certain way would be nice. Just some support. But I get nothing when it comes to his family.

Is this a deal breaker? Am I overreacting? I know I take things to heart sometimes but I also have a bad habit of blaming myself for a lot of things that aren't my fault, and don't want this to be one of those times.",2,1732236443.0,AITAH,1,1.0,False

For so long

Seeing the seasons pass

*

When we were children

The days were endless

And our world was huge 

*

A backyard was a labyrinth 

A playground was a wonderland

*

Then we grew into angry thoughts

And rolling eyes

A walking cliche

Who would die if they realized

Just what a trope they are

*

Our world was massive

As we moved on from family

To friends

Experiences

Life...

*
Then comes the rat race

Coffee made

The route to work is the same

*

The world gets blurrier

*

If you're lucky you love it

If you're lucky you live everyday

*

But luck isn't always likely

*

And sometimes it feels like you're drowning 

*

And now your world is a little smaller

*

Co workers and spouses

""Friends"" whose middle names you don't know

*

It's sleepy Sundays 

Exhausted Thursdays 

And keeping track of the days as they slip away

You barely even notice

*

As your world gets a little bit smaller

*

Children leave

And eyes fade like water lilies

*

Memories are not even safe

Where will I run to

When Autumn changes to Winter 

*

I have never before feared the ice

*

But perhaps that's only because I know of spring

*

 I shudder

As my world grows smaller

It gets a little darker

Any ideas for rearranging or making better use of the space? I really want to make space for a small coffee nook

I was thinking about getting a small kitchen cart and some shelves from ikea for extra storage and counter space. I’d place it in the empty space (6.5’x16”) across from the stove and counters, but I’m worried it might feel cramped. Plus, there’s no outlet nearby, but i could run a cord from where the W/D are. I could also move the trash bin to that space, get rid of the green rolling cart and set up a coffee station back there. Not sure what would work/look best.

1gwv8tp,https://www.reddit.com/r/honeymoonplanning/comments/1gwv8tp/things_you_should_know_before_going_on_a_tanzania/,Things You Should Know Before Going on a Tanzania Honeymoon Safari,"When we decided to celebrate our honeymoon with a safari in Tanzania, we were excited and nervous all at once. It was going to be a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but we weren’t sure what to expect. After our incredible adventure, I’m here to share some essential things I wish I had known before heading to Tanzania for a honeymoon safari. Whether you’re a first-time safari-goer or a seasoned traveler, these tips will help you prepare for the most unforgettable honeymoon.

# 1. The Right Time to Go Makes All the Difference

We were told by many that timing is everything, and after experiencing it firsthand, we couldn’t agree more. Tanzania’s peak safari season is during the dry months, from June to October. We traveled in late September, and the weather was perfect—dry, warm, and clear skies. The animals were more concentrated around waterholes, so we had a better chance of seeing wildlife up close.

On the other hand, the green season, from November to March, is a bit wetter, but it has its own charm. We met some fellow honeymooners who had gone in March and said they loved the lush landscapes and the fewer crowds. It’s all about what kind of experience you want.

# 2. Pack Smart for a Safari Adventure

You might think you can just throw a bunch of clothes into your suitcase, but packing for a Tanzanian safari requires a little more thought. Trust me, I learned this the hard way. On safari, you’ll spend most of your time in the sun, so lightweight, breathable clothes in neutral colors are key. Think khakis, browns, and greens—these help you blend into the environment and don’t spook the animals.

Be sure to bring a good pair of binoculars, a wide-brimmed hat, and sunscreen—you’ll be amazed how quickly the sun can get to you. A scarf or shawl also came in handy during early morning game drives when it was chilly, but we quickly warmed up as the sun rose.

One of the things I wish I had packed more of was insect repellent. The mosquitoes in the evening were not shy, and it’s best to be prepared. You’ll also want a light jacket for the cool evenings in the Serengeti or Ngorongoro Crater.

# 3. Get Ready for a Bumpy Ride

We knew there would be some bumpy roads on the way to safari lodges, but nothing truly prepared us for the rough terrain. Tanzania's safari parks, especially places like the Serengeti, have dirt roads that can get pretty rugged. Our game drives were thrilling, but the ride to and from our lodges felt like a roller coaster at times.

If you tend to get motion sickness, bring some ginger or anti-nausea medication. But don’t let the rough rides discourage you—once you're on the game drive, it's all worth it when you're surrounded by wildlife.

# 4. Expect Early Mornings—And You’ll Love Them

If you’re anything like me and enjoy sleeping in, be prepared for early mornings. The best time to see animals is either at sunrise or late in the afternoon, so we were up before dawn every day. But, honestly, those early mornings became one of our favorite parts of the trip. The stillness of the savanna at sunrise, the cool air, and the anticipation of spotting animals made each morning feel magical.

Plus, there’s something incredible about watching the sun rise over the Serengeti, or hearing the first sounds of lions roaring in the distance while sipping coffee from the comfort of our private tent. If you're not an early riser, it’s worth adjusting to the schedule. These moments are a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

# 5. The Wildlife Is Spectacular, But Sometimes It’s About the Unexpected Moments

Sure, we saw lions, elephants, giraffes, and even cheetahs—but what really made our honeymoon safari unforgettable were the unexpected moments. The quiet time when we spotted a rare bird sitting in a tree, or watching a herd of wildebeest migrate across the plains in the distance. It wasn’t always the “big five” that made us go “wow,” but the little things that made us appreciate the raw beauty of Tanzania’s wilderness.

And let’s not forget the night safari! Seeing animals in the dark, with only the light from our vehicle to guide us, was surreal. We spotted nocturnal creatures like hyenas and bush babies, and it felt like we were in a completely different world.

# 6. A Good Guide Makes All the Difference

One of the best parts of our honeymoon safari was having an amazing guide who made all the difference. Our guide, Moses, was not only knowledgeable about the wildlife and the landscape but also knew exactly where to go to get us the best animal sightings. He shared stories about the land and culture, making every drive more than just a tour—it felt like an adventure with a friend.

When booking your safari, I recommend going with a reputable operator who offers private guides. They can personalize the experience and take you to less-visited areas where you can truly enjoy the wildlife in peace. Plus, having a private vehicle gives you the flexibility to stop whenever you want, making the experience even more intimate.

# 7. Zanzibar: The Perfect Honeymoon Finale

After our safari, we were ready to unwind. So, we headed to Zanzibar to top off our honeymoon. The contrast between the safari and the island paradise was exactly what we needed. Zanzibar’s pristine beaches, the spice tour, and the romantic sunset dhow cruise were the perfect way to relax after all the adventure.

You can also experience some culture and history by wandering through Stone Town, which is filled with rich history and local charm. Whether you’re lounging on the beach or taking a leisurely stroll, Zanzibar provides the ultimate end to an action-packed honeymoon.

# 8. It's the Experience, Not Just the Destination

I had always thought that safaris were all about the animals. But I quickly realized it’s much more than that—it’s about immersing yourself in the landscape, the sounds, and the overall experience of being in the wild. From the vastness of the Serengeti to the lush Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania is a place that makes you feel small in the best possible way.

But most importantly, it's about the memories you create together. Whether you're spotting lions from a distance or enjoying a quiet evening under the stars, every moment on a Tanzania honeymoon safari is about sharing those experiences with the one you love.

# Final Thoughts: Embrace the Adventure and Romance

Tanzania offers an unparalleled mix of romance, adventure, and breathtaking landscapes. From the vast plains of the Serengeti to the pristine beaches of Zanzibar, it’s a destination that delivers an unforgettable honeymoon experience. While it may seem overwhelming to plan at first, once you're there, the adventure will unfold in front of you, and you’ll be immersed in the magic of Tanzania.

So, if you’re thinking about a Tanzania honeymoon safari, trust me—you’re in for the trip of a lifetime. It’s worth every moment of planning, and the memories you create will last forever.

**Di suatu pagi yang indah bulan April**, di tepi jalan sempit di kawasan *fashionable* Harajuku Tokyo, aku berpapasan dengan gadis 100% sempurna.

>Sejujurnya, dia tidak begitu cantik. Tidak ada yang mencolok dari penampilannya. Pakaiannya biasa saja. Bagian belakang rambutnya masih lusuh bekas dari tidur. Dia juga tidak terlihat muda — pasti sudah hampir 30 tahun, sudah tidak cocok dipanggil “gadis” lagi. Tapi tetap saja, aku sudah tahu dari jarak 50 meter: Dia adalah gadis 100% sempurna untukku. Seketika aku melihatnya, dadaku bergetar, dan mulutku kering bagaikan padang pasir.

>Mungkin kau punya gadis favorit dengan ciri tertentu — pergelangan kaki yang ramping misalnya, atau mata yang besar, jari yang anggun, atau tanpa alasan yang jelas kau tertarik dengan gadis yang makan dengan pelan. Aku punya alasan tersendiri, tentu saja. Terkadang saat di restoran, aku menatap perempuan di meja sebelahku karena menyukai bentuk hidungnya.

>Tetapi tidak ada yang bisa memaksakan kalau gadis 100% sempurna miliknya harus sesuai dengan ciri tertentu. Meskipun aku menyukai hidung, aku tidak bisa mengingat bentuk hidungnya— atau bahkan apakah dia punya hidung. Yang bisa kuingat dengan pasti adalah bahwa kecantikannya biasa saja. Aneh sekali.

>“Kemarin di jalan, aku berpapasan dengan gadis 100% sempurna,” kataku kepada seseorang.

>“Oh ya?” dia bilang. “Cantik?”

>“Tidak juga.”

>“Tipe favoritmu, kalau begitu?”

>“Entahlah. Aku tidak bisa mengingat apapun tentang dirinya — bentuk matanya atau ukuran dadanya.”

>“Aneh.”

>“Iya. Aneh.”

>“Jadi,” dia bilang, sudah telanjur bosan, “apa yang kau lakukan? Mengajaknya ngobrol? Mengikutinya?”

>“Tidak. Aku hanya melewatinya.”

>Dia berjalan dari arah timur ke barat, dan aku dari barat ke timur. Hari itu adalah pagi yang sangat indah di bulan April.

>Andai saja aku bisa mengobrol dengannya. Setengah jam sudah lebih dari cukup: bertanya tentang dirinya, aku menceritakan diriku, dan — yang sangat ingin aku lakukan — menjelaskan kepadanya lintasan takdir yang menghantarkan kami bisa saling berpapasan di tepi jalan Harajuku pada suatu pagi yang indah bulan April tahun 1981. Momen ini pasti penuh dengan rahasia hangat, seperti sebuah jam antik yang dibuat ketika dunia penuh dengan kedamaian.

>Selesai mengobrol, kami makan siang di suatu tempat, mungkin menonton film Woody Allen, mampir ke bar hotel untuk minum *cocktail*. Dengan segala kemungkinan yang ada, kami bisa saja berakhir tidur bersama.

>Hatiku memberikan sinyal agar melakukan sesuatu.

>Sekarang jarak kami semakin mendekat menjadi 15 meter.

>Bagaimana aku bisa mendekatinya? Apa yang harus kukatakan?

>“Selamat pagi, nona. Bisakah kau meluangkan waktu setengah jam untuk mengobrol ringan?”

>Konyol. Aku terdengar seperti sales asuransi.

>“Permisi, apakah kau tahu jika ada tempat laundry yang buka 24 jam di sekitar sini?”

>Tidak, ini sama konyolnya. Lagipula aku tidak sedang membawa pakaian kotor. Siapa yang akan menanggapi pertanyaan semacam itu?

>Mungkin sebaiknya aku jujur saja. “Selamat pagi. Kau adalah gadis 100% sempurna untukku.”

>Tidak, dia tidak mungkin percaya. Atau kalaupun dia percaya, dia mungkin tidak ingin berbicara denganku. Maaf, dia bisa bilang, aku mungkin adalah gadis 100% sempurna untukmu, tapi kau bukan lelaki 100% sempurna untukku. Itu bisa bisa terjadi. Dan kalau aku terjebak di situasi itu, perasaanku pasti hancur lebur. Aku tidak akan pernah pulih lagi. Umurku sudah 32 tahun, dan seperti itulah rasanya menua.

>Kami berpapasan di depan toko bunga. Hembusan angin yang hangat menerpa kulitku. Jalanannya lembap, dan aku mencium aroma bunga mawar. Aku tidak berani menyapanya duluan. Dia memakai sweter putih, dan di tangan kanannya memegang amplop putih tanpa prangko. Aku menduga: Dia menulis surat untuk seseorang, mungkin menghabiskan waktu semalaman menulisnya, terlihat dari matanya yang sayu. Surat itu bisa saja berisi semua rahasia yang dia punya.

>Aku berjalan beberapa langkah kemudian berbelok: Dia sudah hilang di tengah keramaian.

>**Sekarang, tentu saja,** aku sudah tahu apa yang seharusnya kukatakan padanya. Namun itu akan menjadi omongan yang panjang, terlalu panjang bagiku untuk dapat mengucapkannya dengan jelas. Ide-ide yang muncul di kepalaku tidak pernah praktis.

>Yah, omonganku akan dimulai dengan “Pada suatu ketika” dan berakhir dengan “Cerita yang sedih, bukan?”

>**Pada suatu ketika,** hiduplah seorang anak lelaki dan anak gadis. Si anak lelaki berumur 18 tahun dan si anak gadis berumur 16 tahun. Si anak lelaki tidak begitu tampan, dan si anak gadis tidak begitu cantik. Mereka hanyalah seorang anak lelaki dan anak gadis biasa yang kesepian, seperti anak-anak lainnya. Tetapi mereka yakin dengan sepenuh hati bahwa di luar sana ada lelaki 100% sempurna dan gadis 100% sempurna untuk mereka. Ya, mereka percaya pada sebuah keajaiban. Dan keajaiban itu memang benar terjadi.

>Suatu hari mereka bertemu di suatu pojok jalan.

>“Mengagumkan,” si anak lelaki berkata. “aku sudah mencarimu seumur hidupku. Kau mungkin tidak percaya, tapi kau adalah gadis 100% sempurna untukku.”

>“Dan kau,” balas si anak gadis, “adalah lelaki 100% sempurna untukku, sama persis seperti yang aku bayangkan. Rasanya seperti mimpi.”

>Mereka duduk di bangku taman, bergandengan tangan, dan saling bercerita satu sama lain dari jam ke jam. Mereka tidak merasa kesepian lagi. Mereka telah menemukan dan ditemukan oleh orang 100% sempurna mereka. Betapa indahnya bisa menemukan dan ditemukan oleh orang 100% sempurna kita. Sebuah keajaiban yang besar.

>Selagi mereka duduk dan mengobrol, setitik keraguan mulai muncul di hati mereka. Apakah memang wajar sebuah mimpi bisa terwujud semudah ini?

>Maka, ketika ada keheningan sejenak di tengah obrolan mereka, si anak lelaki berkata, “Ayo kita buat percobaan — sekali saja. Kalau kita memang benar adalah pasangan 100% sempurna, maka pada suatu hari, di suatu tempat, kita pasti akan bertemu lagi tanpa halangan. Dan ketika itu terjadi, dan kita tahu bahwa kita memang pasangan 100% sempurna, kita akan langsung menikah di saat itu juga. Bagaimana menurutmu?”

>“Baik,” kata si anak perempuan, “itulah yang harus kita lakukan.”

>Kemudian mereka berpisah, si anak gadis menuju timur, si anak lelaki menuju barat.

>Percobaan yang mereka buat, bagaimanapun, sangat tidak diperlukan. Mereka seharusnya tidak perlu menyetujui percobaan itu, karena mereka sesungguhnya dan sebenarnya adalah memang sebuah pasangan 100% sempurna, dan keajaibanlah yang mempertemukan mereka. Namun tidak mungkin mereka bisa mengetahui ini, mengingat usia mereka yang masih muda. Untaian takdir memisahkan mereka dengan kejam.

>Pada suatu musim dingin, si anak lelaki dan anak gadis ini menderita influenza parah, dan setelah berminggu-minggu terombang-ambing antara hidup dan mati mereka kehilangan memori masa remaja mereka. Saat mereka sembuh, ingatan mereka kosong seperti anak yang baru lahir.

>Meskipun begitu, mereka adalah dua orang yang pintar dan tekun, dan dengan kegigihan yang tak pernah pudar, mereka akhirnya bisa memiliki pengetahuan dan insting yang membuat mereka layak untuk hidup lagi sebagai warga masyarakat pada umumnya. Mereka berhasil menjadi masyarakat yang patuh yang tahu cara pindah dari stasiun kereta yang satu ke stasiun lainnya, dan mereka juga mampu mengirimkan surat ke kantor pos. Mereka bahkan bisa merasakan cinta lagi, kadang-kadang sebanyak 75% atau bahkan 85% cinta.

>Waktu berlalu begitu cepat, dan sekarang si anak lelaki sudah berusia 32 tahun, sedangkan si anak gadis berusia 30 tahun.

>Di suatu pagi yang indah bulan April, saat mencari segelas kopi untuk memulai hari, si anak lelaki berjalan dari arah barat ke timur, sementara si anak gadis, bermaksud ingin mengirim surat istimewa, berjalan dari arah timur ke barat, keduanya berada di jalan sempit yang sama di kawasan Harajuku Tokyo. Mereka saling berpapasan tepat di titik tengah jalan tersebut. Secercah cahaya memori mereka yang hilang tampak hadir sekejap di hati mereka. Mereka merasakan getaran di dalam dada. Dan mereka tahu:

>Gadis ini adalah gadis 100% sempurna untukku.

>Lelaki ini adalah lelaki 100% sempurna untukku.

>Tetapi cahaya memori mereka terlalu lemah, dan pikiran mereka sudah tidak sejernih 14 tahun yang lalu. Tanpa berkata-kata, mereka saling melewati satu sama lain, kemudian hilang di dalam keramaian. Selamanya.

>Cerita yang sedih, bukan?

>**Ya, itulah,** itu yang seharusnya kukatakan padanya.

>**On Seeing the 100% Perfect Girl One Beautiful April Morning**  
  
**One beautiful April morning**, on a narrow side street in Tokyo’s fashionable Harajuku neighborhood, I walk past the 100% perfect girl.  
  
Tell you the truth, she’s not that good-looking. She doesn’t stand out in any way. Her clothes are nothing special. The back of her hair is still bent out of shape from sleep. She isn’t young, either—must be near thirty, not even close to a “girl,” properly speaking. But still, I know from fifty yards away: She’s the 100% perfect girl for me. The moment I see her, there’s a rumbling in my chest, and my mouth is as dry as a desert.

>Maybe you have your own particular favorite type of girl—one with slim ankles, say, or big eyes, or graceful fingers, or you’re drawn for no good reason to girls who take their time with every meal. I have my own preferences, of course. Sometimes in a restaurant I’ll catch myself staring at the girl at the table next to mine because I like the shape of her nose.

>But no one can insist that his 100% perfect girl correspond to some preconceived type. Much as I like noses, I can’t recall the shape of hers—or even if she had one. All I can remember for sure is that she was no great beauty. It’s weird.

>“Yesterday on the street I passed the 100% perfect girl,” I tell someone.

>“Yeah?” he says. “Good-looking?”

>“Not really.”

>“Your favorite type, then?”

>“I don’t know. I can’t seem to remember anything about her—the shape of her eyes or the size of her breasts.”

>“Strange.”

>“Yeah. Strange.”

>“So anyhow,” he says, already bored, “what did you do? Talk to her? Follow her?”

>“Nah. Just passed her on the street.”

>She’s walking east to west, and I west to east. It’s a really nice April morning.

>Wish I could talk to her. Half an hour would be plenty: just ask her about herself, tell her about myself, and—what I’d really like to do—explain to her the complexities of fate that have led to our passing each other on a side street in Harajuku on a beautiful April morning in 1981. This was something sure to be crammed full of warm secrets, like an antique clock built when peace filled the world.

>After talking, we’d have lunch somewhere, maybe see a Woody Allen movie, stop by a hotel bar for cocktails. With any kind of luck, we might end up in bed.

>Potentiality knocks on the door of my heart.

>Now the distance between us has narrowed to fifteen yards.

>How can I approach her? What should I say?

>“Good morning, miss. Do you think you could spare half an hour for a little conversation?”

>Ridiculous. I’d sound like an insurance salesman.

>“Pardon me, but would you happen to know if there is an all-night cleaners in the neighborhood?”

>No, this is just as ridiculous. I’m not carrying any laundry, for one thing. Who’s going to buy a line like that?

>Maybe the simple truth would do. “Good morning. You are the 100% perfect girl for me.”

>No, she wouldn’t believe it. Or even if she did, she might not want to talk to me. Sorry, she could say, I might be the 100% perfect girl for you, but you’re not the 100% perfect boy for me. It could happen. And if I found myself in that situation, I’d probably go to pieces. I’d never recover from the shock. I’m thirty-two, and that’s what growing older is all about.

>We pass in front of a flower shop. A small, warm air mass touches my skin. The asphalt is damp, and I catch the scent of roses. I can’t bring myself to speak to her. She wears a white sweater, and in her right hand she holds a crisp white envelope lacking only a stamp. So: She’s written somebody a letter, maybe spent the whole night writing, to judge from the sleepy look in her eyes. The envelope could contain every secret she’s ever had.

>I take a few more strides and turn: She’s lost in the crowd.  
  
**Now, of course**, I know exactly what I should have said to her. It would have been a long speech, though, far too long for me to have delivered it properly. The ideas I come up with are never very practical.

>Oh, well. It would have started “Once upon a time” and ended “A sad story, don’t you think?”  
  
**Once upon a time,** here lived a boy and a girl. The boy was eighteen and the girl sixteen. He was not unusually handsome, and she was not especially beautiful. They were just an ordinary lonely boy and an ordinary lonely girl, like all the others. But they believed with their whole hearts that somewhere in the world there lived the 100% perfect boy and the 100% perfect girl for them. Yes, they believed in a miracle. And that miracle actually happened.

>One day the two came upon each other on the corner of a street.

>“This is amazing,” he said. “I’ve been looking for you all my life. You may not believe this, but you’re the 100% perfect girl for me.”

>“And you,” she said to him, “are the 100% perfect boy for me, exactly as I’d pictured you in every detail. It’s like a dream.”

>They sat on a park bench, held hands, and told each other their stories hour after hour. They were not lonely anymore. They had found and been found by their 100% perfect other. What a wonderful thing it is to find and be found by your 100% perfect other. It’s a miracle, a cosmic miracle.

>As they sat and talked, however, a tiny, tiny sliver of doubt took root in their hearts: Was it really all right for one’s dreams to come true so easily?

>And so, when there came a momentary lull in their conversation, the boy said to the girl, “Let’s test ourselves—just once. If we really are each other’s 100% perfect lovers, then sometime, somewhere, we will meet again without fail. And when that happens, and we know that we are the 100% perfect ones, we’ll marry then and there. What do you think?”

>“Yes,” she said, “that is exactly what we should do.”

>And so they parted, she to the east, and he to the west.

>The test they had agreed upon, however, was utterly unnecessary. They should never have undertaken it, because they really and truly were each other’s 100% perfect lovers, and it was a miracle that they had ever met. But it was impossible for them to know this, young as they were. The cold, indifferent waves of fate proceeded to toss them unmercifully.

>One winter, both the boy and the girl came down with the season’s terrible influenza, and after drifting for weeks between life and death they lost all memory of their earlier years. When they awoke, their heads were as empty as the young D. H. Lawrence’s piggy bank.

>They were two bright, determined young people, however, and through their unremitting efforts they were able to acquire once again the knowledge and feeling that qualified them to return as full-fledged members of society. Heaven be praised, they became truly upstanding citizens who knew how to transfer from one subway line to another, who were fully capable of sending a special-delivery letter at the post office. Indeed, they even experienced love again, sometimes as much as 75% or even 85% love.

>Time passed with shocking swiftness, and soon the boy was thirty-two, the girl thirty.

>One beautiful April morning, in search of a cup of coffee to start the day, the boy was walking from west to east, while the girl, intending to send a special-delivery letter, was walking from east to west, both along the same narrow street in the Harajuku neighborhood of Tokyo. They passed each other in the very center of the street. The faintest gleam of their lost memories glimmered for the briefest moment in their hearts. Each felt a rumbling in the chest. And they knew:

>She is the 100% perfect girl for me.

>He is the 100% perfect boy for me.

>But the glow of their memories was far too weak, and their thoughts no longer had the clarity of fourteen years earlier. Without a word, they passed each other, disappearing into the crowd. Forever.

>A sad story, don’t you think?  
  
**Yes, that's it,** that is what I should have said to her.",2,1732236137.0,indonesian,1,1.0,False
1gwv6sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/WoodworkingGuild/comments/1gwv6sp/random_orbital_sanders_a_woodworkers_journey/,Random Orbital Sanders - A Woodworker's Journey Through Perfect Finishes,"*After 15 years of woodworking and countless hours in my workshop testing various tools, I've decided to share my comprehensive guide on random orbital sanders. This post compiles everything I've learned from refinishing furniture to building custom pieces, and all the mistakes and victories in between!*

# Understanding Random Orbital Sanders: The Game Changer in Wood Finishing 🤔

When I first started woodworking in my garage, I was overwhelmed by the variety of sanders available. Belt sanders, sheet sanders, detail sanders - the list seemed endless. But discovering random orbital sanders was truly a game-changer for my woodworking journey.

# The Science Behind the Swirl-Free Finish

Random orbital sanders combine two distinct motions:

1. **Spinning motion:** The pad spins on its axis
2. **Orbital motion:** The pad moves in small elliptical patterns

This dual-action movement prevents swirl marks and ensures a consistently smooth finish. Think of it like drawing tiny circles while spinning a plate - it's nearly impossible to create visible patterns.

*Personal Experience: I learned this the hard way when I ruined my sister's antique coffee table with a regular orbital sander. Those circular marks haunted me for years! The random orbital sander I bought afterward saved countless projects from a similar fate.* 😅

# Deep Dive into Features: What Really Matters 🔍

# Pad Sizes and Their Applications

|Pad Size|Best Applications|Pros|Cons|Personal Experience|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|5-inch|Furniture, cabinets, general woodworking|More controllable, widely available pads|Slower on large surfaces|Perfect for 90% of my projects|
|6-inch|Decks, large tables, quick stock removal|Faster material removal, larger coverage|More expensive, can be unwieldy|Great for my deck restoration business|
|Multi-pad capability|Versatile projects|Flexibility in pad sizes|Higher initial cost|Worth the investment for professionals|

# Advanced Usage Techniques: From Novice to Pro 📚

# The Perfect Sanding Sequence

*After ruining countless projects by rushing, I've developed this foolproof sequence:*

|Grit Sequence|Purpose|Duration|Pro Tips|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|60-80|Heavy material removal|Until level|Check progress frequently|
|120|Initial smoothing|5-7 minutes/sq ft|Look for consistent scratch patterns|
|180|Medium smoothing|4-5 minutes/sq ft|Crucial for most projects|
|220|Fine smoothing|3-4 minutes/sq ft|Don't skip this step!|
|320+|Ultra-fine finish|2-3 minutes/sq ft|For premium projects|

# Pressure and Movement Techniques 🎯

**The Perfect Pressure Formula:**

* Let the tool's weight do 80% of the work
* Apply only fingertip pressure
* Move at a steady pace (about 1 inch per second)

*Professional Secret: I draw light pencil lines across the surface before sanding. When they're gone, I know I've sanded evenly!*

# Common Mistakes and Their Solutions: Learn From My Failures! 😅

# 1. The Stationary Sander Syndrome

* **Mistake:** Keeping the sander in one spot
* **Result:** Uneven surface with possible gouging
* **Solution:** Keep moving in overlapping patterns
* *Personal Story: Learned this the hard way on my first guitar body project - ended up with a dip that took hours to fix*

# 2. The Grit-Jumping Crime

* **Mistake:** Skipping grit sequences
* **Result:** Hidden scratches that show up after finishing
* **Solution:** Follow the complete grit progression
* *Experience: Lost a $2000 commission because I tried to save time by jumping from 80 to 220 grit*

# 3. The Speed Demon Error

* **Mistake:** Running too high speed on soft woods
* **Result:** Burnt surfaces and ruined material
* **Solution:** Start slow, increase speed gradually
* *Lesson Learned: Ruined an expensive piece of bird's eye maple by being impatient*

# Advanced Maintenance Guide: Extending Tool Life 🔧

I'm a 22 y/o guy from the south of Spain and I'm here as a last resort ngl, I have a terrible work schedule and I don't really go out that much, just sometimes to drink some coffee with friends and talk about life and our interests. So meeting new people irl has been rough for me

About me, I'm 1.90m or 6'3 (I think?) aprox, I'm into videogames, anime, books and I'm really passionate about music, my biggest dream is to make a living out of it

Also I try to be as fit as possible, but with my work schedule it's really hard, but at least it's a physically demanding job, so I do some exercise on the daily, but don't expect a muscular thin body. I'm open to share pictures or my socials if you want to see what I look like

As for what I'm looking for, I'd say it'd be nice if you shares some interests with me and lived in a similar time zone, but don't be afraid to reach out even if you don't have those, loves knows no boundaries.
 
If we clicked, I'm open to travel or host you if you were the one coming to visit, but at first I'd like to maybe make calls and video calls and at some point meet.

I'm just looking for someone to be my best friend and my partner. Who I can enjoy life and share the little moments that matter the most

They are now saying to restore the machine to its original condition would cost more than a new machine and recommended we purchase a new one and that the transit damage reported impacts the warranty.

She’s in college, and I just turned 21. She’s really beautiful and seems sweet. I saw her two days ago, but I also saw her about three weeks ago, before I went on my birthday cruise two weeks ago.

We said ‘hi,’ and I asked, ‘How are you?’ and she replied, ‘I’m good.’ Fast forward to last Monday—I was in Walmart again, and she recognized me and started talking to me. We had a nice, short conversation, and I learned her name. Before I left, I said bye to her and told her it was nice to meet her.

As I was about to leave, she asked if I had Instagram. She said, 'Maybe we could message each other on it.' I told her I did, but my connection in Walmart was spotty, so she asked if she could put her number in my phone. I said yes, and she mentioned we could hang out as friends or something.

The day after that, I texted her and asked how she was. After that, I asked her if she had any fun plans for the weekend."" She then replied, saying, ""I might be free on X day. Why? I asked if, on one of those days, she’d like to go get coffee. She never responded, which is fine.

The next week, I texted her and said I hoped she was having a great week. She responded saying, ‘Hello.’ I asked her how she was, and she said she was good. She then asked me how I was, and I said I was good.

That text exchange was yesterday. Today, she texted me, but she said, ‘Who’s \[insert name\]?’ I guess she forgot my name. I texted her back, telling her who I was, and she hasn’t responded yet.

This is weird to me for a couple of reasons. We’ve texted before, and if she was responding to me, I’d assume she’d have my number saved on her phone. Another reason why I find this just a little strange is because she gave me her number, and I texted her the next day saying, 'Hey, it's \[insert name\] from XYZ.

Can you see why I might be a little confused? Reddit was the last place I wanted to go for advice, but I don't have many friends, and I just wanted to make sure my confusion was justified. I want to make sure I'm not going crazy.",1,1732235919.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1gwv2sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/greatpyrenees/comments/1gwv2sp/help_training_pyr_mix_to_not_steal_and_chew_stuff/,Help training Pyr mix to not steal and chew stuff?,"Sorry in advance, this turned out to be more of a long rant than just questions lol. Me and my family currently have an 8 month old Pyr/Golden Retriever mix and for the most part she's just acting like a typical puppy of her age and has slowly and steadily been getting better about the usual puppy issues. 

But one thing that's been driving my mom nuts is that our dog likes to steal stuff off of side tables, the coffee table, bedside tables, etc so that she can chew or tear up said stuff. For the most part, she's just stuck to stealing paper/mail, tissues, paper towels, other small items which are all things that I've repeatedly told my parents to pick up and keep out of her reach. Today she stole a pen and my parents new insurance cards, which she promptly tore up, and my mom is furious and pissed at me and the dog about it. 

I know pyr's are notorious for chewing up paper and I've explained that to my mom god only knows how many times at this point and told her repeatedly to not leave paper all over our family room or stuff within the dogs reach, but she won't stop. Today she said, and I quote: ""What, are we always supposed to keep paper up?? That's just not realistic! We can't just not leave paper in the family room! She has to learn not to chew up paper and steal stuff off the tables!"" 

Personally, I'm of the opinion that at 8 months old you're still playing roulette with most uncommon/ enticing things left within a dogs reach and if you don't want them touching it, it needs to be kept up and away from them. Once they're older you can start leaving stuff within their reach and expecting them not to steal it, but only once they're old enough they have some form of impulse control. For our last dog (Golden Retriever/Chow) that age was about a year, so it's not like our last dog didn't also get into stuff around this age. I keep all of my belongings put up and other than a few tissues she's stolen out of my trash, I've had absolutely no issues with her destroying my stuff.  

So is there any way to teach her to not steal stuff off of tables when it's left at her eye level? Or even to just leave paper alone specifically? Or is this really just a case of my family needing to learn to keep things up and out of the dogs reach until she's older? Or is it likely just a case of Pyr's being obsessed with shredding paper and her grabbing other things while table surfing for paper? Something else?

She's my parents dog, I'm just an adult living with them to save on rent and yet I'm somehow the only one really training or exercising her and so the dog chewing up paper is somehow my fault/problem to solve. I keep telling my parents that she's just at the crazy teenager age where she's just going to be exceptionally stubborn and bratty before she calms down somewhere around a year/year and a half of age and to just be calm and consistent with her, but apparently that's not a good enough answer for them.

Am I genuinely just not training this puppy well enough and do I need to find a dog trainer? Does my family just need to stop leaving their mail all over the place? Is there some kind of magical pyr training knowledge for this kind of stuff or this age that ya'll can bestow upon me? Please help a girl out lol",1,1732235813.0,greatpyrenees,0,1.0,False

1.   
New areas: Outdoors, tropical resort, Candy Shop, and Carnival and new Malls and Ocean Liners for turbo

New mains: Barbeque, Pancakes/ Waffles, Funnel Cakes, Smoothies, Assorted Candy, Crabs/Lobster, and Sushi

New sides: Syrup Topping, Berries and Cream, Caviar, Calamari, Popcorn, Cotton Candy, WATER, Mochi

New mode: Buffet, the candy shop and buffet both don't seat customers, but must retain stock of all goods or patience runs out

New layout feature: Drive thru, one in ever 5 customers orders drive thru, and pizza delivery where you give a driver pizzas to deliver

2. A card that introduces VIPs like celebrities, CEO's, influencers and don's, which take your priority, as well as inspectors that will fine you if you mess up food or have a huge mess, and food critics that tie into advertisements and effect your customer amounts

3. Events, you could introduce cards to theme your run after holidays or events, that could also tie into to your business type

4. Risks setting, allows problems to build overtime, such as cockroaches or rats from untreated messes, grime and mold, customers tell you of allergies after a delayed time, or dine and dashers during rush hours, and loiterers that just take space up and you can ask them to leave, appliances can break down and must be fixed

5. New appliances, like a sign that can be upgraded to a neon sign that warns of allergies and allows them to alert you faster, as well as themed based appliances that are available to specific areas like heaters for alpine, and display stand can be upgraded into different advertising utilities, that draw in customers, let you see their orders earlier, or allow you to put an item on sale. as well as a card that makes customers pay at a register

6. New reserved theme, only the absolute finest dine at your restaurant, which means they will pay extreme amounts, but have low patience and high expectations, and a quality theme where your food is so good people don't mind waiting for a table

7. A Christmas setting that serves hot cocoa and/ or sugar cookies; hot cocoa is like coffee but you add marshmallows, and for cookies you roll out dough, cut them in one of 3 shapes, and frost it based off the correct color for the shape",3,1732235338.0,PlateUp,0,1.0,False

Admin usually do a bigger gesture- breakfast one morning or our favorite snack and a drink, or an ice cream bar.

Three weeks before you moved in with her, the four of us were at your house. You, me, her, and Jay. Jay left early. You and her were drunk. We were watching music videos. I was sitting on the couch next to you, she laid down on the floor on the other side of the coffee table. A song came on that made you emotional and you put your hand on the couch, you gestured for me to take it. I hesitated, because she was in the room and I knew you two were sleeping together, and you and I hadn't been for over a month. But you did it again, so I put my hand in yours. You asked me to stay that night, and I did. You wanted to have sex, but I thought you were too drunk, so we only cuddled. Your alarm went off at 4 AM like it always does, and I woke up and rolled over. You pulled me into your chest the same way you used to. We went back to sleep. I left when we had to go to work, and I still remember the way you reached your hand out to touch my back when I got out of bed.

Two weeks before you moved in with her, you and I were at Jay's apartment. You were drinking bourbon. You were laughing about something dumb and you told me to hold your hand. You touched my leg. You put a blanket over me. You moved to sit closer. I have a picture of you sitting with your back against my knees. At the end of the night I drove you home, and in the car you started to talk about her. You were worried she'd be at your house when you got home. You talked about how you and her have been friends for a while and might be a good match, but you didn't want to be with her. I didn't know what to say.

One week before you moved in with her, you and I were on the couch watching hockey on your iPad and sharing food. She was on the other couch next to Jay. You started drinking moonshine. You get emotional when you drink moonshine. You sat there and told us all, her included, how you're single in part because you still want to spend your time with Jay and me. You said the two of us are your closest friends. I almost felt like you deliberately left her out. Later, you and I were messing with Jay, doing a card trick that he couldn't figure out. We did it over and over and sat there on the couch, almost crying with laughter. You grabbed my arm. You put your head in my lap. You told me how much fun you were having. Then you paused. You looked at me for a moment and said, ""I feel like we're-"" but then you stopped yourself. You started to talk again, you said, ""I love how much-"" but then you stopped yourself a second time. You shook your head and patted my arm instead. When you looked at me it felt like we were the only people in the room. I wish you'd have said what you wanted to say. 

One week after that night, you texted me and Jay and asked us to come over. I got a separate text from you saying that from now on, we'd be hanging out at her house on the weekends because you moved in ""about a week ago"" but you're ""keeping it on the down low"". I stopped in my tracks. I asked if you're dating. I thought about how her husband moved out a month before. I don't even know if she's divorced yet. You said ""Kind of? We're trying things out"". I don't know what the fuck that means. Sydnie listened to me sob in the car.

Four days after that, I got my necklace and my hair clip out of your room at your old place. I didn't tell you. Your mom let me in. They were still on your bedside table. 

Now it's been two and a half weeks since I got that text. I sent you one back telling you all the ways you were confusing me. I asked you for space. You gave it to me, sort of. We didn't hang out for two weeks. I told you not to ask me to. But you sent me at least four invitations to come over with Jay. Somehow I managed to turn them all down, even when you told me your daughters missed me. It hurt to not see them, and it hurt to not see you, but I'm proud of myself for not giving in.

We hung out on Saturday again for the first time. I had bought hockey tickets for me, you, and Jay months ago for my birthday. The game was fun. I *missed* you. Afterwards we went to your house and you guys gave me my birthday present. You give a little speech about how much ""grace and love"" I've shown you both. It was nice to hear that from you. She came home half an hour later. She poured a shot. You hid the tequila after that and told her she gets annoying when she drinks. She called you a ""punk ass bitch"". You told her to get out of your personal space. She went outside to smoke. I don't think either of you are happy. It honestly makes me sad that you aren't even happy. 

You know... sometimes I look at you and all I can I think is this big strong ex-Marine with his thick and curly hair, a voice you'd hear from a mile away, who walks around like he is God's gift to the world, is actually *so* fragile and so afraid. You have all these feelings you pretend not to have because maybe that would be weak, or maybe even more so because they terrify you. But just this once, I wish you'd be honest. To me, to her, to yourself. I wish you'd stop running scared.",1,1732234793.0,letters,1,1.0,False

\[Sound of a tape being inserted into a VCR and beginning to play, clamor as you jostle the camcorder and find a place to put it\] (*Mumbled*) Umm, let’s set you up right here. Is this table rotted? No, it should be fine. 



(*Clearly*) Hi, baby. I know, right? Can you believe it? An honest to god, working camcorder. Working batteries too- a little corroded but working all the same. It’s so… retro or vintage, I guess you’d say. 



\[Small laugh\] It reminds me of when I’d leave you those little voice messages you liked so much, when you were working or sleeping, the ones you said you loved to listen to like a podcast. I never really understood how they were different than a voicemail, but you know there’s nothing I wouldn’t do to make you happy. Those were the days before-



\[Laugh\] Before the fire nation attacked.



\[Pause\] (*Sobered*) Before the dead stopped staying dead. It’s insane how that’s something we used to take for granted like running water, electricity, cell phones that I’d use to send dumb voice messages about the new Frosty at Wendy’s.



I think that’s why I’m here doing this… besides the fact we decided tonight we’d stay up in shifts. You’re behind this door I’m leaning against, sleeping like a log, and I’m going to leave you one last message to wake up to, one where I say the things that matter. 



\[Rueful laugh\] A message I’m not sure you’ll even get. The playback on this thing is busted. Even if the camcorder doesn’t die on me, you won’t be able to watch the tape back on it.  I’ll probably end up lugging it around in my pack, and you and I both know every ounce feels like another pound just like the hikers used to say. There’s not really any point, but…



I want you to have this while I still have the time and opportunity to say it, before I’m gone… And I will be gone, my love. At some point, probably soon, probably to the zombies, I won’t get to be by your side anymore, and I just hope you’ll have this record of me to keep you company. 



\[Laugh\] (*Starting to get emotional*) Maybe I should have thought out what I wanted to say, but I’m afraid if I stop the recording, it won’t start again, so rapid fire- let’s go. 



Don’t drink too much of that instant coffee shit when I’m gone. I don’t ration you for my health; I do it for yours. If I let you have your way, those would kill you before the zombies could get a fighting chance.



If you forget your winter coat somewhere again, I’ll haunt you. I swear, you’re on number four, and even though we always find you a replacement, you always leave something in the pockets you miss. At least when I’m dead, I can stop hearing about Wilson the Rock and how I heartlessly abandoned him in Albuquerque. That wasn’t my fault, you brat, and you know it.



I know it’s too much to ask you not to pet every cat and dog we see; I just beg you to be careful. I don’t know how we’ve gone this long without needing a rabies vaccine, but we haven’t come across one yet, so please don’t push your luck. 



\[Laugh\] You’ll move on from me eventually, and don’t you say shit, because I know you will and I want you to. But please, when you do, if you ever truly loved me, don’t move on with that dickhead, David from California. I can’t stand him. Who struts around during the end times, the zombie apocalypse, without ever wearing a shirt? He’s such a goddamn show off.



\[Sigh\] Obviously, that’s a joke. You move on with whoever you want, whoever loves you, whoever makes you happy and protects you… Or whoever you love, I suppose. Because who couldn’t help but love you?



I love you. God, I fucking love you, and though this isn’t I expected how I expected our life together to go, there’s no one else I would have rather lived it with. For richer or poorer, in sickness and in health, for better or for worse, that’s what we said.



The date on the camcorder says it’s our fifth anniversary- can you believe it? I debated telling you but… I don’t know. I couldn’t bear not giving you a gift to celebrate, couldn’t handle the thought that this might be our last. 



But it was a good one. You befriended a chicken which was… strange but really cute. We got that rain which was good for our water supply. We found those twinkies that put a smile on your face and were weirdly good … And I spent it with you. Any day, even these awful, bloody days, is worthwhile and perfect if I spend it with you.



I guess I just wanted you to know that, to have a record of that for when I’m gone. I love you, and I’ll always love you. There’s a “til death do us part” joke in here somewhere, but we know death doesn’t mean much anymore, so no jokes. Happy anniversary, sweetheart.



\[Clamor of getting up, *click* of turning the camcorder off, pause\]  



(*Muffled*) Baby? Are you awake? 



\[*Thu-thump* of going up stairs\] I could have sworn I heard you up and about. If you’re rotting under the blankets, scrolling through Tiktok, I’ll-



(*Unmuffled*) Oh geez, are you watching this old thing again? No wonder you’re taking forever, you’ve been digging out the VCR. 



\[Kiss\] It’s not cute, it’s… Ugh, god, look how dirty I was. I know we were all dirty, but I was a proper pigsty. I’m lucky my stench didn’t do you in. 



Is this really what we’re doing? Are we going to watch this every year? Is this an anniversary thing along with pancakes and presents?



Of course there’s presents, you goof. It’s our tenth anniversary; what makes you think I’d not get you *presents*?



If you want to find out, we better get downstairs



Hmmm, a hint…



This one, for sure, doesn’t have rabies. 



(*Fading out*) Don’t run! You didn’t survive the zombie apocalypse just to slip on the stairs in your socks!



\[*Thunk* of the listener slipping\]

1gwu60i,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gwu60i/i_found_my_doppelgänger_on_the_dark_web/,I Found My Doppelgänger on the Dark Web,"A few months ago, I started dabbling in the dark web—not for anything illegal, just out of curiosity. I wanted to see if the stories were true: hackers selling government secrets, hitmen offering their ""services,"" and the unthinkable lurking just a click away. Most of what I found was scams or overpriced junk. Then I stumbled onto something that felt different. 
A forum called ""Reflections.""

The layout was simple—just a black screen with red text. The tagline read: ""Find yourself in others."" I assumed it was some philosophical nonsense or a creative writing forum, but one thread caught my attention: ""Doppelgängers: Post Your Match.""

Curiosity piqued, I clicked. The thread contained hundreds of pictures of people—random selfies, candid shots, even surveillance-style images—all with timestamps. And beneath each photo was another image: a match. 

Sometimes the resemblance was uncanny, like identical twins. Other times, it was... off. A person’s smile might be too wide, their eyes just slightly misaligned, or their skin a shade too pale. 

Scrolling down, I froze.  

There was ¿ my face ?.  

The first photo was a candid shot of me at a coffee shop. I recognized the hoodie I wore last week and the chipped paint on the chair I was sitting on. The timestamp was from five days ago.  

Below it was another photo: ""my match.""  

This version of me was smiling, but it wasn’t a normal smile. It was too sharp, stretched wider than physically possible, like someone had grabbed the edges of my mouth and pulled. My eyes were slightly sunken, and my skin looked... waxy. But it was me.  

My heart raced. I hadn’t shared that photo anywhere. Someone had taken it. I clicked back to the main page, panicked, but I couldn’t leave. Every time I hit the ""back"" button, I’d end up on another thread titled""Find Yourself.""

The screen glitched. A pop-up appeared:  

“Do you accept your reflection?”

Two buttons: YES and NO.

I slammed the “NO” button. My screen went black.  

For a moment, I thought I’d bricked my laptop, but then my webcam light flickered on. I panicked, slamming the lid shut, but not before I caught a glimpse of the screen.  

It was me—but I wasn’t sitting at my desk anymore. The room behind me was a basement I didn’t recognize, and the expression on my face wasn’t mine. It was the same too-wide smile from the photo.  

I unplugged my laptop and shoved it under my bed. That night, I barely slept.  

The next day, I got a text from an unknown number:  

""Why don’t you smile more? :) ""

Attached was a photo of me, sitting in my living room.  

I don’t go near the dark web anymore. Hell, I don’t even use my computer without a piece of tape over the webcam. But it doesn’t matter.  

Everywhere I go now, I see it: my face. Reflected in windows, in passing cars, in shadows that move just a second too late.  

It’s always smiling.  ",1,1732233279.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

As the Governor of Minnesota, Walz embodies qualities that resonate deeply with constituents, making him a beloved figure beyond party lines. In this essay, I will explore the attributes that define Walz’s persona and why they evoke admiration in many, including myself.

One of the most striking features of Tim Walz’s character is his relatable nature. He often speaks in a manner that feels familiar and genuine, effortlessly bridging the gap between himself and the everyday citizens of Minnesota. By sharing personal anecdotes—whether about his upbringing in a small town or his experiences as a high school teacher—Walz connects with people on a level that many politicians overlook. This authenticity not only fosters trust but also encourages open dialogue. In a world that often feels divided, his ability to share his story makes constituents feel seen and heard. This is precisely what one would expect from a quintessential Midwestern dad, whose warmth and sincerity create a welcoming environment for discourse.

Humor is another hallmark of Walz's persona that endears him to many. He skillfully uses humor to lighten heavy topics, making political conversations more palatable. Whether it is during a press conference or a public event, he often injects witty remarks that reflect a lighthearted spirit while still addressing significant issues. This blend of humor and sincerity allows him to navigate difficult conversations without alienating his audience. Midwestern dads are often characterized by their ability to find levity in life's challenges, a quality Walz possesses in abundance. His playful banter not only entertains but also reminds us that a sense of community can thrive even amidst adversity.

Approachability is perhaps the most significant aspect of Tim Walz’s Midwestern dad persona. Unlike many politicians who distance themselves from the public, Walz demonstrates a genuine commitment to accessibility. He is often seen engaging with citizens in various settings—be it town hall meetings, community picnics, or even local coffee shops. His open-door policy invites feedback and promotes participation in governance. In this way, Walz embodies the Midwestern principle of neighborliness, emphasizing that everyone’s voice matters. His approach encourages trust and fosters a sense of belonging among constituents, allowing individuals to feel that they can engage with their government without fear or intimidation.

Additionally, Walz's commitment to service mirrors the values instilled in many Midwestern families. His dedication to education, healthcare, and community service resonates deeply with a population that values hard work and community support. By prioritizing policies that aim to uplift all Minnesotans, Walz exemplifies the caring and nurturing qualities typically associated with a loving dad. This dedication to service is not only admirable but also essential in creating a cohesive and thriving society.

In conclusion, Tim Walz's Midwestern dad persona encapsulates qualities like relatability, humor, and approachability, which are increasingly rare in today’s political landscape. By embodying these traits, he not only connects with the people of Minnesota but also sets an admirable standard for leadership. Ultimately, Walz reminds us that politics need not be an arena for division; instead, it can be a space for connection and genuine care. His persona inspires hope and encourages a renewed perspective on what it means to lead—qualities that many, including myself, deeply admire.",0,1732232957.0,redscarepod,1,0.43,False

Commonly ignored are the downsides of too much Eugenol, this is quite serious as a eugenol overdose could damage your organs and does at too high of doses of clove. A little foreshadowing behind the the name of the Sub, most of you here are mostly likely aware of the Eugenol sub and the new Eugenol sub, I decided to avoid the name Eugenol for the name of the sub and actually the new Eugenol sub was created almost immediately right after I opened this sub and first shared the hyperlink to it for the first time. Since my idea for creating the sub was for discussion and understanding clove more in depth, we can't be entirely sure yet of the exact mechanisms of Clove and Clove is entirely exaggerated by the Mod of the new Eugenol who refuses to believe anything besides Eugenol has any influence on the experience, they're the only one to report delirium from Clove, I'm not throwing shade at such user but it is obvious they have been into drugs for awhile and nobody gets away from drug use without any altercations to their mind. They used their anecdotes to label clove a deliriant and convinced people it is great drug and a very strong one which is misleading and appears to be an attempt to bait people into joining his sub and you'll see promising reports from basically nobody but himself, at least nothing along the lines of delerium they claim. I share this simply as a warning to be careful about taking advice from that sub as it is wreakless get fucked up advice which probably won't actually get you fucked up but more than likely just harm your organs and you'll get nowhere close to delerium, the mod their is currently claiming it can cause delerium and that it is somewhat safe at high doses but in actuality that only applies to fatality, you're not going to die from a highish dose of clove but Organ damage is likely and I wouldn't' label giving yourself Organ damage as safe. To experiment with clove safely is simple, 8-20cloves with 10-20peppercorns blended in a Coffee grinder, add powder to a cup and add about half a cup of water, mix the powder in and toss it back, taste is less than tea and is easier to swallow then chewing as the bits are much more fine.

","Tanzania is hands down one of the most magical places for a honeymoon. It combines adventure, romance, and the breathtaking beauty of nature, all wrapped up in one unforgettable experience. 

From exciting safari adventures to relaxing beach escapes, Tanzania has it all. Let me take you through my personal experience of why a **honeymoon safari in Tanzania** is the [**ultimate choice for couples**](https://www.easytravel.co.tz/tanzania-safari-tours/honeymoon-safari/)

 looking to create lasting memories.

# A Romantic Safari Adventure: My Journey Through the Wild

# Game Drives & Big Five Safaris

As I set off on my safari, the excitement of what lay ahead was palpable. Tanzania’s national parks are some of the most famous in the world, and I couldn’t wait to see what wildlife awaited me. Imagine waking up in the early morning hours to the distant roar of lions and the chirp of birds as the first light of day gently breaks over the savannah. The Serengeti, Ngorongoro Crater, and Tarangire National Park were all on my list, and each one was as magical as the last.

The Serengeti was especially breathtaking. I witnessed the Great Migration firsthand, with millions of wildebeest and zebras moving across the plains, creating one of nature’s most dramatic spectacles. And the “Big Five” – lions, elephants, leopards, buffalo, and rhinos – were a daily sight, roaming freely in these beautiful parks. Watching them up close felt like a dream come true.

# Private Safari Options for Intimacy

For honeymooners like myself, private game drives are the way to go. It allowed me to experience the wildlife in seclusion, making the experience even more intimate. With just me and my partner in the vehicle, we could enjoy the beauty of Tanzania’s wildlife without the crowds. Whether on a jeep ride or a walking safari, I got to share these magical moments with my loved one, away from the bustle.

# Luxurious Stays: A Romantic and Comfortable Experience

# Stunning Safari Lodges & Camps

Tanzania is home to some of the most luxurious lodges and camps, and after a thrilling day of safari adventures, these places offer the perfect retreat. Picture this: after a long day of game drives, you return to a candlelit dinner under the African sky, surrounded by the sounds of the wild. The lodges here go above and beyond, offering honeymoon packages that include private dining, couples' massages, and champagne to start your stay.

What’s even better? Some lodges have private plunge pools, outdoor showers, and stunning views of the savannah. I could sip coffee on my porch while watching elephants wander by. This is what makes a honeymoon in Tanzania so special – every little detail is tailored to create unforgettable moments.

# Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Stays

One of the best things about staying at Tanzania’s safari lodges is their commitment to sustainability. Many are eco-friendly, using solar power and other green practices. So not only are you enjoying luxury, but you’re also supporting efforts to protect Tanzania’s wildlife and environment – something that made the whole experience feel even more meaningful.

# Zanzibar: Your Dream Beach Getaway

# Relax on Pristine Beaches

After an unforgettable safari experience, I headed to Zanzibar for the perfect post-safari relaxation. The beaches here are absolutely stunning—white sandy shores and turquoise waters stretching as far as the eye can see. Zanzibar is often called the “spice island,” and it certainly lives up to the name, with its tranquil beaches offering a perfect spot for romantic moments.

The beaches of Nungwi and Kendwa are among the most beautiful I’ve seen, with soft sand and calm, crystal-clear waters. Whether it was lounging on the beach with a coconut drink or having a romantic dinner by the sea, Zanzibar provided the ideal backdrop to unwind and enjoy the serenity.

# Snorkeling and Water Activities

Zanzibar’s waters are a paradise for snorkeling and diving. I spent hours exploring vibrant coral reefs teeming with colorful fish and even swam with dolphins! If you and your partner enjoy water activities, Zanzibar offers endless opportunities. The coral reefs and marine life make it a snorkeler’s dream, and you can even opt for a sunset cruise to end your day with a glass of wine as the sun sinks below the horizon.

# Explore Zanzibar’s Rich History

But Zanzibar isn’t just about beaches – it’s also a place rich in culture and history. I explored the historic Stone Town, with its winding alleys, traditional markets, and old-world architecture. The blend of African, Arab, and European influences here makes it an exciting place to explore, adding a little history to the romance.

# Exclusive Mnemba Island: A Private Paradise

# An Island Just for You

For total privacy, Mnemba Island is the perfect spot. This private island offers luxurious villas and an exclusive atmosphere perfect for honeymooners. There are only a few villas on the island, which makes it feel like it’s just you and your partner in your own little paradise. The private candlelit dinners on the beach and personalized spa treatments made this experience truly unforgettable.

# Perfect for Water Lovers

If you love water activities, Mnemba Island is a dream come true. Its surrounding reefs are perfect for snorkeling and diving. I kayaked through the crystal-clear waters, exploring vibrant coral and tropical fish. Whether you’re in the water or on the beach, Mnemba offers tranquility and breathtaking views that make for the perfect honeymoon.

# Unique Moments to Share: Create Lasting Memories

# Stargazing Under African Skies

One of the most romantic experiences I had was stargazing under the African skies. Tanzania’s night skies are incredibly clear, making it the perfect place for stargazing. I lay on a blanket with my partner, staring up at the stars and watching the Milky Way shine bright above us. It’s these intimate, quiet moments that make a honeymoon safari so unforgettable.

# Sunrises and Sunsets Over the Savannah

The beauty of Tanzania’s sunrises and sunsets is unmatched. Watching the sunrise over the Serengeti as the wildlife stirs and the plains come to life was a magical moment I shared with my partner. And the sunsets were just as breathtaking, with the sky turning golden and orange as the day came to a close.

# Shared Adventure

A honeymoon safari in Tanzania is not just about the wildlife but also about the shared adventure between you and your partner. From spotting lions in the distance to sharing moments of quiet awe, every part of the safari is a bonding experience. These moments bring you closer together, and they’re memories you’ll cherish forever.

# Planning Your Honeymoon Safari in Tanzania: Tips to Make the Most of Your Trip

1. **Choose the Right Time to Visit** The best time to visit Tanzania is during the dry season, from June to October. This is when wildlife is most concentrated around waterholes, making game viewing easier. Zanzibar enjoys pleasant weather almost all year round, making it a perfect beach escape any time.
2. **Mix Safari and Beach for a Perfect Honeymoon** Combining a safari adventure with a beach getaway is the ideal way to experience both excitement and relaxation. I recommend spending a few days in the Serengeti or Ngorongoro Crater, then heading to Zanzibar for a few days of pure relaxation.
3. **Private and Personalized Experiences** Many lodges offer private game drives, couples’ spa treatments, and special touches just for honeymooners. These personalized experiences make your trip even more special.
4. **Work with Travel Experts** Planning a honeymoon safari can be complex, so working with travel experts is a great idea. They can help you plan the perfect itinerary, ensuring you make the most of your time in Tanzania.

# Why Tanzania is Unforgettable for Honeymooners

Tanzania isn’t just a honeymoon—it’s an experience. From thrilling safaris to relaxing beach escapes, it offers adventure, romance, and luxury all in one place. Whether you’re watching the Great Migration in the Serengeti or enjoying the beaches of Zanzibar, Tanzania creates unforgettable memories. If you want a honeymoon as extraordinary as your love, Tanzania should be at the top of your list. Every moment spent there will bring you closer together, making it the perfect destination for a once-in-a-lifetime experience.",1,1732232895.0,honeymoonplanning,0,0.67,False

but ever since then she’s been a nightmare for me. she’s passive aggressive, yells about everything, and has even said that the abuse i went through ‘wasn’t that bad’ after i told them that i went no contact with my egg donor. 

like i asked her to please not yell as much because it does trigger me (my egg donor and her second husband loved yelling at me for the smallest things) and she said she was just trying to vent her frustrations and that i was being too sensitive. coffee literally yells so much that one of our neighbors filed a noise complaint on our house like ???? if that’s not a sign to find better ways to vent frustration then idk what is. 

and every time i’m having a conversation with one of the other roommates she comes in and makes it abt streaming and vtuber drama. like don’t get me wrong, i love drama as much as the next person but like its so rude to derail the conversation. and half the time when she uses us to vent abt her streaming career its literally just her bitching and crying because she isn’t pulling like 700-800 views a stream or having to clip her own streams or how her tiktoks don’t gain traction. 

like i used to do tiktok, not as a career mind you, but i had a rough idea of how the algorithm works. and i told her that her best bet was trending tags for the day. her response? “Oh that feels too… fake. I want people to find me organically.” and i warned her that doing that would work against her. but hey fuck me, i don’t know shit bc i’m not a streamer ig. 

and like i told her and the other roommates (there’s five of us in total) that i was engaged and she dead ass changed the subject to some streamer shit like ???? i literally just told yall that i’m getting married and moving countries????? that’s pretty fucking big news????

it sucks bc when we were just friends she was chill but now i genuinely fucking hate her. and lowkey i want her streaming career to fail and i feel bad about that because it’s something she cares about. 

i’m just so fucking sick and tired of every gods damned conversation being about her fucking streams. i just wanna have one conversation abt something other than streaming with her for the first time in two years.  and like ive tried asking her to maybe talk abt streaming less and she got so mad at me that i genuinely thought she was going to hit me.

so honestly, once i move to be with my fiance i will leave any shared server with her. because i don’t wanna hear her fucking shit anymore. ",1,1732232883.0,Vent,2,1.0,False

1gwtv3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/sick/comments/1gwtv3a/loss_of_appetite_and_pain_when_eating/,Loss of appetite and pain when eating ,"Hi everyone! So I have no idea if anyone can help me with what’s going on but I need some sort of idea of what’s happening. 

Around end of June/ start of July this year I started slowly loosing my appetite, I didn’t notice it at first but when I did I realised that’s not normal for me (I’m a big back I eat a lot 😭) and it’s slowly progressed to not eating for days at a time and now it’s gotten to the point where I physically cannot handle food and I’m in pain every time I eat. I don’t throw up but the more food I eat the more pain I’m in. There’s been a few times where I’ve had too much food and ended up crying and in the fetal position for hours on end just because I had one meal. 

I can tolerate liquids, such as juice, water, coffee and anything like that but any sort of solid food, even smoothies puts me in pain. Because of the loss of appetite I’m having to force feed myself and it’s getting really hard and I don’t know why this is happening. 

I have tried googling a few illnesses and doing symptom checkers but none of it fits what’s happening. The closest thing I’ve found is H. Pylori but the only symptom that doesn’t fit is pain when eating because apparently eating can take the pain away, so I’m not too sure about that 🤷‍♀️

I have a GP appointment coming up soon, but I would like some ideas I can bring to my gp so I’m not going in fully blind.

Thank you so much if you read this and if you have any possible idea of what could be going on, please comment or pm me ☺️

I wanted to wait for him to make the first move but I decided to cut the chase and after finding out we have a mutual acquaintance, I got his number and texted him.  No mixed signals in my message - ‘You look cool, would you like to go for a coffee someday?’. He replies immediately, super excited about me texting him and says yes, we talk for 3 days before we meet up, and then he mentions he has a girlfriend! 

I am super confused at this point but still proceed meeting for a coffee with him - which I then treated as a friendly interaction. There were no flirty vibes and he was super chill. Then he told me he is going out of town for 2 weeks to visit his girlfriend who lives in another country. 

So at this point my hypothesis is: bro is just super polite and friendly and agreed to get a coffee even though he understood I was asking him out. He then told me he has a gf and expects me to behave accordingly. This is exactly what I did and I did not text him after the meeting. 3 weeks pass by with no contact and I just received a message from him asking to meet for a coffee again. 

What’s that all about? I’ve been asking my guy friends about this too and we are all confused so thought it’s time I ask reddit. What are the options? Could he be in an open relationship? He just wants to make new friends? I find him really cool and attractive and I’m afraid hanging out as friends might be difficult for me.",10,1732232431.0,AskMenAdvice,54,0.81,False

1gwttvd,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1gwttvd/tired_of_judgment/,Tired of judgment ,"I recently just found out I’m pregnant, I’m 6 weeks along. Of course, after finding out I was super excited so I told my best friend a couple days later. She was super excited for me, surprised (not really sure why as I told her we were kinda trying), but excited nonetheless. Now, I love my best friend but she’s definitely my complete opposite. She’s dominant, loud, always speaks her mind and I love her for this. However, I’ve been getting the ick about it since I told her I’m expecting. 
For context, I’ve been vaping nicotine since I was 15 years old, I’m 24 now so it’s been almost 10 years that I’ve been reliant on it. To say it’s been hard to stop is putting it lightly, but I’ve significantly cut down on it & was even told at my ultrasound appointment that it was okay to gradually cut it out instead of going cold turkey. Every time she sees/hears (on the phone) me hit it, she makes a comment about how I’m smoking a battery & hurting the baby. Obviously, I know this, but I’m taking the steps to cut it out - it’s really my only vice. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke pot, I’ve stopped drinking soda & significantly cut my coffee intake down.  
It’s also important to note that my partner & I have more traditional values. When I have the baby, I’m going to quit my job to focus on raising the baby & my younger sister (that’s a whole other can of worms, you can see my past posts to get the idea if you care that much) while my partner continues to work. She made a comment today that once I have the baby, I better be the perfect little house wife & I can’t keep letting the dishes pile up in the sink. Now of course, once I stop working the housework will be easier to maintain. But I also know that I will have to get the hang of not only caring for a toddler but a newborn before it gets any “easier.” When I told her that, her response was “oh and does partner understand that?” Of course he does! Just because we have traditional values, doesn’t mean he’s a misogynistic piece of crap who only cares about his dinner being made & the house being clean. I explained that to her -nicely of course- and she said “is that something you both talked about or is that what you think?” Neither. It’s something I know in my soul, he’s a great guy, just not the type of guy she would date. 
I guess the point of this is I’m just tired of the little bits of judgement she’s been passing since I told her I’m expecting. Like I said before, she’s always been like this and I know this, but I think it’s just grating on my nerves since she’s not even sure if she wants kids & she’d already judging what I’m doing. Is this something I should ignore or should I try to talk to her about it? I don’t think she’s doing it to be ugly & I think it comes from a place of love… but it’s definitely bothering me a bit. I haven’t told family yet & partner works a lot so I don’t really have anyone but her that I can vent to & obviously I can’t vent about her to her. So… thanks for reading my vent, I already feel a little better getting it out haha. ",1,1732232352.0,pregnant,2,1.0,False

It all started when I was driving back home from vacation in a nearby city. It was nighttime and no one was outside. My headlights were on the whole time and were bright as they should be after replacing them last month. I wasn't tired since I had some coffee to help me stay awake during my drive. I was only 5 minutes away from my apartment when the incident happened.

I was going about 40 MPH which is the speed limit for the road I was on. Suddenly, a person in a black ski mask with an AR-15 jumped out of the trees along the road into the path of my car.

I panicked and slammed what I thought was the brakes. I was confused when the car began to speed up and as I realized I hit the gas, it was too late.

I plowed into the person and their body got under the car and the tires finished them off. I slowed down for a bit to think about what happened. I looked at the rearview mirror and saw a bunch of people screaming and wailing and gathering around where I hit the person. Without thinking straight, I hit the gas and drove away from the scene.

I arrived home and immediately put my car into the garage and closed the doors. I took a few deep breaths before I cried at what I have done. I think it was about a minute before I noticed my dashcam. It recorded the whole thing which made me scared of myself. I didn't want to have the cops get evidence on my wrongdoings so, I took the dashcam and hid it somewhere no one will ever find it. If I threw out the dashcam, my neighbors would see me do that and be suspicious.

It was around past 12am when I arrived home so, I decided to get some sleep before getting ready for work two days from then.

The next day, I awoke to a beautiful morning without the sounds of police sirens or knockings on my door. A peace came over me as I got ready for the off day and made myself some coffee and scrambled eggs.

My appetite vanished when I saw the news on my phone. I spat out the coffee in horror as I read the contents of the article.

PREGNANT WOMAN KILLED IN HIT AND RUN

A pregnant woman has died after being hit by a black SUV which fled the scene. The incident occurred along West Hazelnut Rd at around midnight. Police are currently investigating the crime and are asking anyone with information about the suspect. Witnessses claim the vehicle was a Black SUV.

If anyone has information about the incident, please call the Korland Police Department.

I shut off the phone and began to feel body aches and chills all over. I was thinking, 'oh my god, they're gonna get me. I'm fucked.' Until, I realized they got some information wrong. I won't post what my car is but, they're looking for the wrong car. I went back to the garage to inspect the vehicle.

My car had no blood stains despite the impact. It was a miracle no dents or dings formed anywhere in the front of the car. I think I might get away with this. But, I did have a few questions in mind.

Why was there no mention of a ski mask or the AR-15? Was I mistaken or did an earlier incident occur? What if those people are her acquaintances and are changing the narrative?

For now, I'll have to act like nothing happened. Hopefully, things blow over.",0,1732232156.0,stories,1,0.5,False

So, I graduated from properly the best engineering college in the country ten years ago and decided to work for the government. The man who interviewed me told me back then that you would earn much less here and that I don't get a lease on a car. But you will get other things in return: you get three months of vacation, you get two months for projects you have two weeks for in the corporate world, and you can work with the newest tech because of the big budgets we have.

So I had a heart-to-heart with my dad, and we eventually decided that the government was a better fit as I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) at twelve. I have not had panic attacks for a decade now, but I still have that constant worrying that is always there. So I decided to take less pay but get peace of mind in return.

I have been really happy with my choice. I still make around 110k a year, have about 1/4 of the year off, and can work from home four days a week. I also get to do some of the most fun projects most companies can't pay for, which got me in this mess.

Last year, I did a project that got some attention, and I was asked to dinner by a pretty big company. I was curious what they would offer, and it would be a free meal. So I won't go into details, but it was upping my pay to 195k, giving me a car of my choice, and giving me a healthy bonus at the end of the year.

When I returned, I told my fiancé, and she got super excited, thinking I would instantly accept. But I thought about it and didn't want to do it. I would cut my vacation in half, couldn't work from home anymore, and would have a one-hour drive to and from work. I also would get a lot less time for the projects and have to deliver, and I know it will increase my stress level and worsen my GAD. Knowing I can get up ten minutes before work starts, get a cup of coffee, and work in my pajamas is relaxing and precious to me.

I told her this, and she won't stop bringing it up. She tells me I'm just scared and should give it a shot and that we can use the money. I disagree with this. I already own my home and have ten years left on my mortgage. We have two cars and a healthy savings account. I also live in a pretty social country, so I won't ever have to pay for my kids' healthcare or education.

So now she won't stop bringing it up, telling me about vacations we can take with the money or a bigger house we can buy. It reached a point where even when we went out to eat, she would bring it up and tell me how much more often we could eat out, leading to a big fight.

This has been going on for two weeks now, and I'm at a point where I just don't think she will ever listen to me or my feelings. She won't see me for anything but this weak man who puts his comfort above everything and isn't ambitious.

I love her and don't want to break up with her, but I feel like no matter how many times I say no, she keeps bringing it up. So will I be an asshole if I end the relationship?",1,1732232116.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

I Uber home from work most nights and have often considered offering my driver a coffee from the kitchenette coffee machine. It's a nice coffee machine that makes a cup on demand at what many say is good quality, not like a pot made that morning that's sat all day.

That said I could see how this would be perhaps a bit forward. How would you respond to an offer like that? Welcome or nah? 

Thanks for the feedback. 

One last thought, this is in no way in place of a tip, I tip every ride and wouldn't change that if my driver took me up on a coffee. I just know things are tight for y'all and a free cup of coffee costs me nothing. 

Edit: after reading responses from a bunch of you I'm realizing the risk of causing someone concern over spiked coffee, causing an inconvenience of an extra bathroom stop, or other offputting reactions it's probably a bad idea.

1gwtpx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/bioware/comments/1gwtpx3/why_fans_are_rejecting_veilguard_from_a_longtime/,Why fans are rejecting Veilguard. From a longtime fan that also liked DAV,"Hi there,

I just finished Dragon Age: Veilguard at the start of the week, and despite its flaws, I really enjoyed the experience. It has its serious issues as a Dragon Age sequel, which I'll get into, but overall, I'd recommend the game to folks. I'm a huge Dragon Age fan, Origins in particular really played a big role in my life back in 2009. It's when I first became disabled and my uncle bought both of us copies so we could play and discuss the game together. So it's a series I would love to see do well. Here are my thoughts.

**Positives:**

First off, that ending is fantastic. Without giving spoilers, it’s a brilliant capstone to Inquisition. The character writing throughout Veilguard is strong, especially with Emmerich and Davrin—every moment with them made the game for me. Solas doesn't get a lot of screen time but every scene with him is absorbing. The emotional payoff from Inquisition here is incredible. Well Done Bioware.

The faction system is another big win. Being part of the Mourn Watch was super cool and made me feel like a light-side necromancer, especially when hanging out with my favorite death mage. There's a strong Doctor Who vibe if you go that route, and I highly recommend it.

Combat is decent and tactical enough, especially on the highest difficulty. Playing as a mage felt much more enjoyable and closer to previous Dragon Age games. It made me think about different status effects and dodge like a madman. Melee combat, on the other hand, felt very God of War 2018 which is obviously the inspiration for this entire game. Overall, combat was enjoyable but could've used more enemy types and opportunities to play as other characters.

Visually, the game is stunning. The character art style was a bit jarring at first, with half the models being realistic and the other half cartoony—probably due to the game being restarted three times. But the environmental design is top-notch. The devs really outdid themselves here. It’s also the least buggy and most optimized Bioware game I’ve ever played, which I appreciate as a disabled PC gamer with no extra bucks for an upgrade.

**Negatives:**

If I had to rate it, I'd give it an 8/10. It's a solid God of War clone with an MCU-style narrative and mostly strong character writing. However, it doesn't feel much like a Dragon Age game.

Dragon Age was known for tactical combat, moral gray choices, and worldstates that carried over. Veilguard lacks these elements. There’s almost no recognition of past games, no worldstates, and minimal player agency. The choice system is superficial, with dialogue options feeling like variations of the same response. Background choices, which provide lots of flavor text and unique companion interactions, offer few unique decisions, which was disappointing.

Speaking of companions, while there are a few well-written companions like Davrin, Emmerich, and Neve, the others mostly fall flat. Characters like Harding come off as holier-than-thou, Bellara is a know-it-all pixie manic dreamgirl, and Lucanis’ constant coffee references get old fast.

Which is why a character like Taash stands out even more than your typical sore thumb. The character is poorly written and comes across whiny. If you finished the game you know the idea was that this character would start immature and grow and find themself over the course of the game. However that maturation comes so close to the end of the title I don't think many people will see it and thus be left with that terrible taste in their mouths. And to be honest, the social politics from our real world injected into DA's are pretty blatant and because there is no player agency it feels like you the player is being forced to agree with the worldview of the writers.

Romances are week and I just hate how low quality the writing is. Like why is this game rated Mature, it doesn't make sense. And to say the less of those weak-butt consequence slides at the end of the game the better.

**Overall:**

I spent over 80 hours in Veilguard and enjoyed many aspects of the game, especially the characters and story. However, it feels too much like YA fiction and is tonally and systemically different from previous Dragon Age entries. With all these deviations, it’s Dragon Age in name only, which is disappointing.

I wish EA had let Bioware develop Dragon Age: Dreadwolf as originally planned. Finding my favorite fantasy franchise turned into an MCU YA Fiction look-a-like is depressing. While I enjoyed Veilguard, and recommend people play it, I'm still bitter about what could have been. I hope EA learns from this and brings back writers like David Gaider and some more of the departed old guard to help right this ship. Though considering the rumors around the poor sales for this title. Who knows when we'll see Thedas again?",7,1732232049.0,bioware,33,0.55,False

1gwtmcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1gwtmcd/how_to_directly_ask_if_a_guy_friend_has_feelings/,How to directly ask if a guy friend has feelings for me or maybe be more flirty first? Added a TLDR;,"Need Advice. I am F25, and I met a friend, M34, this September. We initially met playing Pickleball and played with some friends from a tennis group or just his different friends for about a month and a half until it got cold outside. I suggested we start playing indoor soccer now—just us two- and he suggested indoor skating with me. Before this, I sent a reel regarding cat yoga, and he suggested hot yoga and pilates.

The night before, at around 2am, he messaged me to cancel in a series of replies and never rescheduled another time to go. Furthermore, on social media, he would like my Instagram stories of pictures of myself or memes I post, but never anything I post on my feed—just an observation. He would remember details about me such as my favourite foods, city, pickleball court, restaurants, and cafes and send me pics or freq. make references to the following things just listed. Once or twice, he has asked me to go to a cafe with him, but we’ve never gone. He preferred only to want to go during the day. Our mutual friend is included in our group chat and has made us go to dinners all three together. He is introverted and likes things a particular way. We would discuss things like relationship shows or relationships in general. 

A few weeks ago, I sent reels of cafes we could go to, and he said, “Thanks, it’s near my work; I’m gonna take my boss.” then, I sent pics of the cafe and loved it. I think my hints of interest for him don’t actually reach him well. This week, while I was talking to him, I kept receiving what I consider mixed signals from him. One minute, he is super talkative in the messages (in person, he is fine), and then hours go by, and he doesn’t respond. So I talked to our mutual friend to ask him directly if he liked me. he replied to the mutual guy friend that nothing I am cool, and he sees me only as a friend, and that nothing is going on between us… therefore, one would assume to give up, right? However, I think he and his friend could possibly be in contact with me and that the friend is also talking to me about him. Triangulation vibes… so he simply wrote that but didn’t mean it. I say this because he would be flirty with me and continue to play activities with me that I am no good at (he could enjoy my company rather than focusing on playing seriously). He introduced me to his cousins and family friends the first time we went skating together, invited me to coffee with them afterward, and paid for my order. That day, he told me his cousins were getting married and spoke freely about the topic of marriage and his previous relationships. 

The week after, we played soccer, just us two, and usually, it’s free, but we went on a Saturday morning, and he offered to hold my bag and paid for the admission to play. It was a very sweet gesture. In-person, he has told me he has fearful avoidant attachment but has worked on it. In previous text messages, he mentioned that the last girl he dated, he never verbally told her he liked her but showed through his actions, and when she told him she didn’t feel an emotional connection with him, she left a week later after dating for 3 months. 

Thus, despite working on his attachment style, I believe he wouldn’t necessarily tell me his feelings, either. I am an anxious/ secure attachment, but because I like him so much, I am very anxious and confused about whether he likes me or not. I have become kind of protective of myself and anxious now, wanting to see him and talk to him more often than we do. 

Now, I am wondering if it seems like he likes me romantically. If so, how do I go about either being more flirty with him or directly asking him if he likes me?


TLDR: I (F25) met a friend (M34) in September through pickleball. We’ve done various activities together, and he remembers details about me, has introduced me to his family, and paid for outings. He gives mixed signals—sometimes flirty and attentive, other times distant. He told a mutual friend he sees me as just a friend, but I think he might be unsure due to his fearful-avoidant attachment style. I’m anxious because I like him and feel confused. Should I be more flirty, or directly ask if he likes me romantically?

CHAPTER ONE

ANGELA

The Fallen

*There are only six Lattice’s. This is a well-known fact among the islands. But why did the Progenitors gift us with only six? Why not five? Why not Seven? The answer to this question has innumerable answers, the most common among them being that 6 is something of an important number to the Progenitors. 6 Races, 6 true Mist-Eyes, 6 Islands, 6 obelisks. Another point of proof to the theory will require me to dabble in the slightest bit of Lattice Science. Firstly, is the fact that the 6 lattices are easily broken down into three groups of two as follows.*

|\*|Transmission|Transition|Translation|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Projection|Pair|Shield|Charge|
|Internal|Signal|Lift|Heat|

*Secondly, each of the groups can also easily be separated into internal or external. As in whether or not the lattice’s effect is projected outside the lattice, or entirely contained within. This proves at the very least, that the lattice table is filled out, and no more groups exist.*

*While some would see all of this as mere conjecture, I raise you the last sentence on the first obelisk. Carved there by the very progenitors themselves.*

*“The Six shall bring civilization back from the brink, and restore the former glory of True Humanity.”*

*This simple sentence is what prompted the first Tinker to construct the first Airship and begin the hunt for the Lattices, and what prompted Augustus Solar to declare the hunt ended after the Paired lattice was found. Because there are only six Lattices, and that is all that there ever will be.*

\---

Angela woke to the screaming of the mist alarm. The alarm was terrifying, a high-pitched pulsating wail that was designed to instill fear and panic into the minds of the uninitiated. To the sailor, it was not the alarm itself that instilled the fear, but what the alarm meant. Angela pushed aside her rack curtain and swung out of her bunk. The small room was filled with people scrambling to get their mist suits on as quickly as possible. She reached for her own and started pulling it on. A frantic minute passed, her hands doing up the seals and clasps nearly automatically after years of practice. She turned to her neighbor and started checking on their seals and clasps. She felt someone patting her own. It was reassuring to have someone to check and once it was done, her heart rate eased considerably. They at least had some protection against the mist now. She spent some time strapping her sheathed halfblade to her belt and strode out the door.

On the speakers mounted to the overhead in various places, she heard the muffled voice of the ship’s Executive officer. “Major Incursion, Major Incursion in the number five chiller room. The ship is sealed and manned for mist incursion. Time: 1 minute, forty-five seconds.”

Upon hearing that last part, Angela relaxed. She allowed her breathing to slow as she sheathed her blade that had appeared in her hand at some point. The ship was awake now. Angela could hear the muffled thumps of her officers getting dressed. Annoyingly, she wasn’t the first one out. The Navigator was across the hall, emerging from her own bunkroom.

The Navigator nodded, strapping her blade to her belt.

“Captain.”

Angela nodded in kind and they both began walking away from the officer battle bunkrooms.  The metal passageways of the ship were small, barely big enough for two people to pass shoulder to shoulder. Various pipes and electrical cables ran through the ceiling and walls. They went up one steep staircase and turned left. To the uninitiated, most ships were an insane warren of passageways and pipes. They often had to get escorted or risked becoming lost in one of the bilges somewhere. By contrast, a sailor could navigate their ship practically blindfolded. After passing through a mist-tight door, they arrived at the passageway to the ships forward Bastion. It was located in the center of the ship, well protected against any stray railgun rounds that made it past the shields.  Back in the day, the Bastion had been a place where sailors could relax and take off their breathing protection while traversing the mist. But over time as technology evolved, shipbuilders started designing ships with all compartments sealed against the mist.  Now the Bastion was the nerve center of the entire ship where most of the ship's functions were controlled. Set into the bulkhead at the end of the corridor was a massive metal hatch, easily 3 meters wide.  Situated on the bulkhead above the door was a steel placard.

The placard contained an image that was scribed into the bare metal by a deft hand. It depicted a grey and blue bird of legend, wings spread, flying up into the sky. Four bright trails of white fire followed after it. Below it was the ship’s name.

LTS *Phoenix*.

Under the name, the ship's motto had been carved with the tip of something very hot, and very sharp. The letters had been rubbed with a type of blue glowstone that made them vibrant against the bare metal of the placard.

 *“Ashes to Embers, Embers to Flame.”*

 Angela walked up to the hatch and pressed the intercom button mounted on the bulkhead next to it.

“Captain and the Navigator, requesting entry into the Prime Bastion.”

There was a ratcheting click, and the door started to ponderously swing open. Angela quite liked how thick the door was, one and a half meters thick. She shuffled through the door, bending herself almost in half to fit, and stood up on the other side.  The room was relatively small and entirely packed with equipment and people. It was a tiered stadium design, each subsequent tier having consoles that controlled different aspects of the ship's systems. At the front of a room was a massive VFD panel that displayed various information about the ship. The most important being the damage control board and engine room status. Dominating the center of the vertical panel was the Oculus a giant glass sphere that assisted with navigation and reference in the mist.

The lowest tier was the engineering tier, and the officers there controlled the ships steam powered generators, electric systems, trim, list, and the all-important Lift

The second tier contained the pilot's chair, directly in the center. On either side were sensors and weapons consoles. The upper tier contained the Conn, a raised circular section ringed with a railing with the commander's chair in the back. The chair was positioned to see most of the consoles and the Oculus easily. On the port and starboard of the conn were the Damage control console and the communication console respectively.

Behind each Console sat one or several members of her crew. They were the most senior on board, and well-equipped to handle nearly any circumstance the ship could throw at them. She knew them all by name, but in this room, names were secondary. The position of the person sitting in the chair was primary.

As Angela walked up the stairs on the starboard side of the room, she nodded to the officers she saw. Most of them were focused on their panels, but a few gave respectful nods. The Navigator walked to the sensor panel and sat down behind the operator. Angela reached the third tier and spotted her Executive officer, Davon. He was a tall man, and incredibly broad. His hands were gigantic. Easily twice the size of hers. His mask hid a short beard and braided hair. He spoke with a thick, gruff voice that occasionally dipped into the growl territory. Angela knew him enough to see the smile in his eyes behind his mask.

“Aye Captain, nice of you to join us.” He said, touching his brow in the approximation of a salute.

“Davon, When I said you could run drills anytime you wanted, I didn’t mean while I was asleep,” Angela said gruffly, walking over to his chair and crossing her arms.

Davon waved one massive, gloved hand. “Bah, anytime is a good time for drills.”

Angela smiled under her mask. “Just tell me next time”

“Aye, captain.” Davon stood from the chair and stretched, his head nearly touching the ceiling of the room, despite it being two and a quarter meters tall.

Angela walked up to the chair and sat down in it. She glanced over the different panels that showed her the condition of her ship.

Angela turned to her XO and saluted. “I relieve you. I have the Conn”

Davon saluted back, correctly this time, “Aye Captain. I stand relieved. You have the Conn.” He turned and walked down the steps. He was heading to the Secondary bastion, where he would take command if the Prime bastion was ever compromised for any reason.

“Comms, the captain has the Conn.” Angela called over her shoulder. The Communication nodded and grabbed a thick well-worn book from its holder. He opened it to a page and began carefully writing inside.

“Carry on,” Angela said.

The Controllers responded with a chorus of “Carry on aye” The room quickly filled with low-level murmurs as the officers under her command resumed talking quietly into their headsets.

 Angela turned toward the damage control board mounted on the forward bulkhead, directly above the Oculus. The panel displayed a drawn-out representation of her entire ship. Each of the many compartments on the ship was represented here. There were lights at the center of each compartment that indicated its status as well as a pressure gauge beside the light. Most of the lights were green, which meant that nothing was abnormal. One light, located in one of their chiller rooms, was white. It was a sight that sent an involuntary shudder through Angela. Even though it was a drill, the idea of mist getting into her ship was uncomfortable to say the least.

“Damage control, report status of the casualty,” Angela said, her voice falling into the tenor of command easily. The officer reported as if the mist was actually inside the ship, pretending that the indications that he was seeing were not inserted artificially for training purposes.

“Aye Ma’m. The Incursion has stopped. The emitters are on service, no signal leakage reported. There were no casualties. There was no damage to equipment. The incursion was from the port radiator hull valve. A repair plan is being conducted”

Angela nodded, approving. “How long until the compartment is safe?”

“Approximately 8 minutes.”

“Very well.” Angela said.

“Do I have an unlimited bell?” She directed this last question to the Pilot, situated directly in front and below her. The pilot himself was seemingly lounging, his hands lazily resting on his controls.

“The engine rooms are ready to answer all bells.” The Pilot said.

Angela considered performing a few rapid maneuver drills but decided against it. They were hunting, if they went to flank, there was a good chance that they would be seen by someone.

“Conn, Red contact! Bearing 300 Mark 23, range 52 miles! Designate Romeo Alfa!” The Sensor console belted out.

Angela turned to the Oculus. In the old days, navigation had been a lot harder. Representing a three-dimensional battlefield on a two-dimensional map was very difficult. The Oculus solved this problem using a glass sphere filled with transparent lights. When a ship was detected, the signal would automatically go to the calculators in the forward part of the bastion.  Eron’s machines would do whatever black magic they did, and a light would flicker into existence inside her Oculus. This light showed the approximate position of the contact relative to the Phoenix.  It allowed Angela to keep track of all the ships around the *Phoenix* and their relative positions and bearings with a glance, instead of wasting time trying to decipher maps.

The Oculus previously only contained a blue dot at the center that represented the *Phoenix*. It now showed a faint red cloud at the very edge of the sphere, slightly to the starboard side and up of where the *Phoenix* was pointing. Not quite blocking their path, but close.

The ship was leaking heat from somewhere. That’s how they had found it so far out. Angela scoffed. The idiots were trying to be stealthy with a leaky ship this deep into the mist.

“Sensors, Get the scope on it”

“Already done cap’n” The sensors console said. The man was intensely focused on his screens, and adjusting dials rapidly.

“Can they see us?” Angela asked, watching the contact closely.

The sensor officer shook his head. “Not a chance, Not unless they got a high-powered scope on that bucket and knew exactly where we are” He never took his eyes off of his panel.

“Pilot, All stop.” Angela said. “Secure from the drill. Weapons, Prepare a targeting solution on all targets.”

“Aye” The officers responded. The pilot brought the throttle lever to stop, and the quiet humming of the engines slowly wound down. On the Damage control board, the white light flickered back to green.

They couldn’t physically see the other ship from this distance. Not while this deep in the Mist. It was only in the upper layer of the mist that sight became a factor in ship-to-ship engagement. Most civilian ships preferred to stay up there, where they could see a pirate raid coming. But It was cheaper to fly deeper, where the lift lattices didn’t require as much heat. And if the civilian ships couldn’t see the pirates, the pirates usually couldn’t see the civilian ships either. Usually. The *Phoenix* was far from the nearest major shipping lane, so Angela had even odds on this contact being a pirate, cargo ship, or patrol vessel.

The seconds passed slowly. As it grew closer, the previously indistinct cloud grew more defined. It was clearly a ship, though it was moving slowly.

“Conn, Weapons reports they have a firing solution.”

Angela turned to the weapon’s console.

“Time?” She asked.

The weapons officer grinned “1 minute, thirty seconds.”

Angela nodded her head approvingly. Eron’s Machines and her crew’s sheer skill made an impressive combination.

“Conn, red contact! Bearing 300 Mark 23, range 45 Kilometers! Designate Romeo Bravo.”

The new contact was slightly behind and below Romeo Alfa, but moving at the same speed. It was probably the merchant that the leaky warship was trying to protect.

“Scope, do we have a designation on Romeo Alfa yet?”

The sensor officer shook his head. “Not yet Ma’m, it's still too far.”

“XO, what do you think?” Angela said to the empty air.

Out of the speakers mounted to the railing of the ring, the XO's gruff voice responded.

“Looks like a merchant and its escort, though why they would be this far down is a mystery to me”

Angela nodded. Merchants were built to use their heavy weight to go incredibly quickly, far quicker than any pirate ship could hope to match. For a merchant to be this far down, and moving this slowly, either something was broken, or the merchant was trying to hide illicit activities. Either way, the *Phoenix* would respond. The nature of the response would depend on a variety of factors.

“XO, how about we see if we can render assistance?”

Angela could hear the grin.

“I think that’s a great idea, Captain.”

Angela grinned herself and strapped into her chair. She manipulated controls on her chair, and the Oculus rotated around so she could better see the tactical picture.

“Pilot, All Ahead one third, come right 5 degrees rudder, steady course 047. Quartermaster, sound general quarters. Navigation, calculate a reciprocal course ending five kilometers behind Romeo Bravo. Weapons, load a firing solution on both targets. Keep it constantly updated as we change position. Damage control, set condition one throughout the ship upon muster confirmation.”

The ship’s alarm bell began to ring. All over the ship, sailors rushed to their battle stations. Masks, which had just been put away, were taken out and re-donned. After receiving confirmation that all compartments had breathing protection on, the DC officer turned a red dial to the left. Vents all over the ship opened and air rushed into them. Angela’s ears popped as the ship was rapidly depressurized. On the DC board, the air pressure gauges lowered steadily as all the air was pumped out.

The ship tilted up and steadily began increasing speed. Their hull was cold and when metal got cold, it got brittle. If they actually got into a fight, they would be at a heavy disadvantage. But if the *Phoenix* heated up, it would reveal their location. Better to get behind the target first.

Slowly, the ballet played out. The two ships ambled along, none the wiser that a predator had begun the hunt.

When gages at the DC board reached the lower red markings, the damage control officer turned the red dial back to the right and turned a black dial to the left. Nitrogen rushed into the ship, filling the void that oxygen had filled only moments before. The ship was pressurized above normal atmospheric pressure, and once the dials on the DC board had all reached the upper red marks, the DC officer stopped the flow of nitrogen.

As they drew closer, the dots on the Oculus grew to resemble the outline of a ship instead of an indistinct blob. Romeo Alfa was the classic flattened prism warship design. The very top and bottom of it were flat, while the sides slanted to form a sharp point. The front and back also slanted down to form a singular point on the bow. Viewed from above or the side, the ship would resemble a short rectangle that narrowed to long points on either end. Angela could also make out several railgun turrets festooned to its hull on the flat portions of the deck. The ship was leaking heat from various spots. Mostly from the propeller seals. Romeo Bravo was the standard merchant design, teardrop shaped, with massive engine pods on the back that were capable of moving the ship at speeds that the *Phoenix* probably couldn’t match.

The ships were trying to be stealthy, but they were doing a terrible job at it. They simply weren’t designed to be this deep in the mist. While their hulls were cold, they still radiated a small amount of heat into the mist, undoubtedly created by their engines and other support systems. Mist naturally concentrated near any heat source, and as mist concentrated, it gave off a signal that could be detected by the aptly named Signal Lattice. The greater the temperature, the greater the signal, and the greater the distance at which the ship could be detected. The two ships were essentially trying to sneak through a darkened alleyway, entirely forgetting they were wearing fluorescent vests with blinking neon signs attached.

The *Phoenix* didn’t have that problem. Her hull was actively cooled just at mist temperature. While this was exquisitely expensive, it provided the incredible benefit of rendering the Phoenix virtually undetectable to their Signal Lattices. A black wolf in a darkened night, invisible to all but the keenest of senses. And Angela had just found her some rather blind sheep.

“Conn, I have a designation on Enemy contacts.” The Sensors officer said.

Angela nodded appreciatively. “Report”

“Aye Captain. Romeo Alfa is a modified Eagle class corvette; Modifications include an extra railgun turret and two class B missile pods. The railgun turrets are the standard fifty millimeters, the missiles are class A. Romeo Bravo is a standard Cortez class merchant. No weaponry.”

The Eagle class was an old, but survivable design. They could be found everywhere, from island police patrols to pirate enclaves. Angela rated its chances against the *Phoenix* as slightly better than a fly’s chance against a flyswatter.

While they were talking, the sensors officer suddenly leaned forward and rapidly began to adjust dials with his hand to the headphones on his ear. After a moment, he cocked his head and leaned back.

“Captain- Uh. Conn, Reporting a gain and loss of a contact. Bearing 340 mark 1 range 6 kilometers. I put my scope right on the location, but I was unable to identify what it was. Possible spurious signal.”

Angela furrowed her brow. This close, the Scope would have been able to see a gnat in flight. It was most likely an anomaly or something that the merchant did to stir up the mist.

“Keep an eye on it, Report anything unusual.”

“Aye Aye.”

“Weapons, Standby all mounts and tubes. Give me a lock with the spinal on Romeo Alfa.” Angela ordered.

As the crew began working, the Sensor officer said “Conn, I have a reading on their lift Lattices. Romeo Alfa reads one twenty with 4 Lattices while Romeo Bravo reads one eighty with 6.”

Angela’s eyebrows rose.

With that small a number of Lift Lattices and a reading of that large, both ships were dangerously close to the Shatter point. If they went any deeper there was a good chance that they would have a Surge and break one of the Lattices. And unless they dumped ballast, the ship would go down. It looked like this particular convoy was willing to take the risk of running heavy close to the lower layer in order to hide.

The *Phoenix* took up station about 5 kilometers behind Romeo Alfa. They were directly behind it, and neither of the targets still showed any sign that they had detected the *Phoenix*.

“Conn, I have a lock with the spinal. Missiles are loaded.” The weapons officer reported.

Angela nodded. She turned to her communication officer. “Comms, broadcast the following. Attention Eagle class Corvette and Cortez class merchant, This is the Privateer LTS *Phoenix.* Identify yourselves and state your flag. We have you locked in. Do not attempt to mauver rapidly or you will be fired upon. End message.”

Davon chuckled from the Secondary bastion. “A little antagonistic there Captain”

Angela scoffed. “Well someone woke me up without my coffee today, so I have the right to be a little antagonistic.”

She thought for a moment and then internally shrugged.  “Weapons, charge all railguns. Heat the hull and charge the armor. Raise all shields, set to low ripple. Might as well show we mean business.”

The weapons officer seemed happy finally getting to do something. “Aye Captain!”

The shields would take several minutes to come up to full strength, as would the armor. But once they were, the *Phoenix* would be very hard to kill.

The two ships didn’t change their heading at all, merely kept moving slowly forward. About a minute after their message, the ships replied. The comms officer read out the message, “LMS *Phoenix,* This is the merchant ship *Varinski*, and its escorting corvette *Arenana.* We hail from Centauri, and are heading back after a successful trading mission in Solar. Transmitting transponder code to Centauri Tower now. Please do not shoot.”

Angela frowned. The name *Varinski* stirred something somewhere deep in her mind. But she couldn’t quite put her finger on it.

“Davon, does *Varinski* ring any bells?” She said into her helmet mic.

“Aye, it does, but I canna put my finger on what bell exactly. Give me a second.” There was a rustling of paper as he started leafing through a book.

“Conn, I have confirmation from Centauri, the code checks out.” The comms officer said.

Angela’s frown deepened. Something about this whole scenario seemed off. The merchant trying to be stealthy, the leaky corvette, the lack of reaction at their proclamation. Something was screaming at her, but for the life of her couldn’t quite figure it out.

“Pilot, all stop. Sensors, give me a general sweep of the area, and prepare for an active pulse. Weapons, standby to fire.”

Both officers nodded. The quiet humming of the engines slowly wound down, and the ship became oddly quiet. The only sound was the clicking of gears from the calculators and the background whirring of fans.

Davon exclaimed suddenly. “There it is! It was in the papers from a week ago. The Cortez class cargo ship *Varinski* failed to show up to port on time. It says here that they’ve been trying to raise them on comms for days now. It's odd though. The papers donna mention anything about an escort.” Angela could almost hear the raised eyebrows. “The owners have put a bounty out on her, but it's incredibly small. Barely ten thousand drams. Ships easily worth a hundred times that.”

Angela blanched. “Why would they-”

The Spurious signal.

They didn’t care about the *Phoenix* because-

Angela shot upright in her chair, the belts holding her in place.

“Sensors! Active pulse! NOW!”

The sensors officer hit the red button instantly, without hesitating. The Phoenix’s deep horn blasted out a single note at incredible volume. The Oculus went red as the sound wave propagated outward. Angela watched the wave closely, waiting for-

“Red Contact! Bearing 090 mark 0 Range 4 kilometers! Designate Romeo Charlie!”

Angela’s stomach dropped through the floor. Fat merchant, leaky escort, a third ship, hiding in the mist. The perfect trap.

“It's charging railguns and raising shields!”

“EMERGENCY DROP! All ahead flank! Right Full rudder!” Angela roared.

The *Phoenix* dropped from the sky as the lift officer put his fist on the red button in the middle of his panel. Angela’s stomach went into her throat and her body pressed against the straps holding her down. Somewhere, something clattered as it fell out of a holding rack. The Pilot furiously manipulated his controls, and the ship began to ponderously turn. Romeo Charlie fired its railguns. The three slugs traveled incredibly fast, and were visible on the Oculus as streaks of red arrowing toward their ship, looking to tear out its insides.

But the Phoenix had dropped in time. Two of the slugs flew past the ventral deck of her ship with barely three meters of clearance, but the last one glanced off the sloped composite armor there with a shower of molten sparks and the screech of tortured metal. The entire ship shook with the impact, ringing like a giant gong. The slug spun off into the mist, trailing heat.

“Impact!” Damage control said, clearly relieved. “No hull breaches! All systems remain at full capacity!”

Nothing was broken, nothing was shattered. Angela allowed herself to breathe.

Angela looked at the forward status board. Shields were still coming up, at least another minute until they reached full effectiveness.

“Pilot, Nose on Charlie! All up neutral!”

The pilot hauled on the control stick and the ship began to tilt upwards.

“Firing again!”

This time, the railgun shots were much better aimed. The first round missed only slightly, the second and third rounds both impacted the shields. The rounds broke apart, spreading their deadly energy in a cone of shrapnel that clattered on the hull like so much steel rain. Though weakened, the shields were performing as designed, taking the majority of the kinetic energy out of the slug and breaking it into fragments where it could impact the hull as a weakened cone rather than a single solid projectile. It was very nearly enough. The entire ship shook as the slug penetrated into the inner armor.

“Multiple impacts! Hull breach at Frame 110 deck two! Performing damage assessment!”

“Steam rupture in the Number two engine room!”

“Two alpha turbine tripped! Lift array two is cross-connected bravo supplying!”

“Breach is sealed, No mist incursion detected.”

The reports came in. Angela’s eyes flicked to the DC board. Several of the lights had turned red, and the pressure across the ship was falling. No white lights yet. She eyed her targeting panel. Almost there.

“Nose on Romeo Charlie” The Pilot reported calmly.

“Fire the Spinal” Angela said, a note of finality in her voice.

The weapons officer twitched his finger, which had been lying on the trigger for their massive meter-bore spinal mount railgun for the entire engagement. The entire ship jolted backward. The sound of a lightning strike heard from a few meters away came from directly below her as the gigantic weapon accelerated a four-ton tungsten slug from a resting state to Mach sixteen in an incredibly short amount of time.

A tiny hole in the frontal shields opened and the round shot out, much faster than the enemy slugs. Romeo two was directly facing them now, and warming up its railguns for another volley. The two-meter-long slug blew through the enemy’s shields and impacted the ship directly on the nose.

A ship’s armor was designed to take the impact of a railgun round and spread it out, lessening the penetration. The armor of the enemy ship was too cold, and the slug too powerful, for the armor to accomplish this task correctly. Instead, the entire outer hull of the enemy ship reached its brittle fracture point and shattered like so many panes of glass. Thousands of metal shards were ejected out at terrifying velocities. What was left of the ship was hollowed out by the railgun round, still traveling well over ten times the speed of sound. The ship still had oxygen inside it, and the compression wave blew apart compartments and started fires. The twisted wreck fell out of the sky like a stone, barely recognizable as a ship that had once held humans safely in its hull. One of its lift arrays, liberated from the ship from the incredible energies at play, shot up into the mist as it exhausted the remainder of its heat energy. When it reached its apex, the Lift Lattice inside shattered. The entire array exploded with the force of a tremendous bomb, sending fragments clattering against the Phoenix’s hull. The shattered pieces of the array joined what had been a ship falling into the dark.

“Shields High Ripple! All mounts, Hold fire!” Angela said, scanning the Oculus for the other two ships. The merchant ship was running. All eight of its massive engines were heated up and pushing the ship along slowly. It would take a while for it to get up to speed. The Eagle class had fully turned around now and was bearing down on them at an angle, aiming to gain the high ground. All three of its railgun turrets were aimed and charging. Its shields were fully up, though they were also set to ripple. What was a fly had become the flyswatter.

Or at least, that was what they were thinking. Its railguns fired, a measly four-shot volley that streaked across the distance in a second. The rounds impacted the Phoenix’s full power shields and were turned to shrapnel. Angela barely felt the shudder as they impacted the hull.

“Impact! No damage!”

Angela nodded once. The shields would hold now.

“Pilot, Full mount firing angle ten starboard. Target is Romeo Alfa. Execute.”

The pilot pushed the rudder pedals with his feet, and the ship slowly swung to the side. All five of the *Phoenix’s* 250mm railgun turrets were unmasked and ready to fire.

“Weapons, All mounts, continuous fire on my mark, the target is Romeo Alfa”

“Aye, captain!” The weapons officer said, his hands flying over the controls.

Angela felt the ship shudder as another five-round volley impacted. Ten-second reloads. An eternity in combat.

“Connn registering impact! No damage!”

It was Angela’s turn now.

“Weapons, All mounts! Commence continuous fire!”

The Weapons officer spoke into his mic, and the *Phoenix* began to shudder. The lights dimmed as the incredible energy requirement of the railguns began to eat into the ship’s electrical grid.

The railguns began firing. One mount after another, letting only a second pass between each successive mount firing. It wasn’t the most accurate of fire patterns, but it was not designed to be accurate. It was designed to put as much metal downrange as quickly as possible in order to disorientate and distract the enemy.

The Eagle’s shields were taking the brunt of the impacts, leaving the shrapnel of the shells to impact the armor and leave gouges and small craters. The shields would take a while to fail under such a barrage. Angela decided to end the fight quickly, just in case there were any more hidden ships around.

 “Sensors, do you have their Lift Lattices?” Angela asked, curling her hands around the arms of her chair.

“Aye Captain, Two Two Seven Five fand holding steady.”

“Weapons, Lock on and fire two missiles.”

“Aye! Ready on your mark captain!”

Angela’s eyebrows raised a hair, the crew had already anticipated her next order before it had even come out of her mouth. Having a competent and motivated crew was well worth the cost of their incredible pay.

“Execute!”

The ship shuddered as the two missiles shot out of the forward missile tubes with a blast of compressed air. These weapons were designed to use an enemy’s lift signature to track toward a target, and destroy it. The Phoenix’s forward shields flickered slightly and the missiles passed through only slightly slowed down. Once through the shields, the missile’s hydrazine engines kicked on, propelling the weapons forward at a breakneck pace.

Because the missile was much slower than a railgun shell, it would actually pass through the shields while they were set to Ripple. If the enemy wanted to, they could set their shields to Full. This would block the passage of the missile, but leave them vulnerable to railguns impacting the shield with full force. Instead of letting the slug through and reducing its speed and breaking it apart, the railgun round would be stopped entirely by the shield. This would quickly overwhelm the hydraulic shock absorbers of the enemy ship. It might even break the enemy’s Shield Lattice permanently. Of course, they could try to maneuver around the missiles, but they had acquired their lift signal, and were both homing in on their ship with unerring accuracy.

Angela had effectively given the ship only a few terrible options. They chose poorly.

“Romeo Alfa’s Lift signal is at zero!” the Sensor’s officer called out.

The pair of missiles swapped to heat tracking, but they weren’t able to reacquire the signal. Both weapons spiraled off into the mist.

“Cease fire! Pilot, Follow them down, All up one quarter.”

The *Phoenix* fell slower than the pirate. They had turned back on their Lift Lattices, but they were so heavy, and the Lattices were already at their capacity. Angela calmly watched their fall rate slow, waiting for the inevitable.

There.

Angela saw it in the Oculus. A great tendril of compressed mist spiked from the Dark, hitting the forward port corner of the enemy ship. Instantly, it began to tilt to one side as the Lift Lattice there was shattered. Angela saw a massive heat bloom come out the bottom of the pirate ship.

“Captain, they are dropping their ballast. Their shields are down.” The sensors officer said quietly.

Watching a ship spiral after a Surge was something that inspired empathy in most sailors, even if that ship was an enemy.

Surprisingly, the pirate ship recovered. It leveled out about 4 kilometers above the dark. Its propellers were still spinning, but very slowly now.  Now that the ship had no ballast, it moved much slower, and couldn’t support its shield's electrical power requirement anymore. The ship slowly drifted up, tilting forward and to the port side heavily. Angela nodded. The ship’s crew had done well in the recovery. Not everyone could recover from a spiral like that. Her thoughts then turned to the merchant. With its escort out of the scenario, it would be easy prey, all she had to do was-

“Enemy lift signal is at zero!”

The Eagle class ship fell. Angela watched, open-mouthed, as it hit the surface of the dark. It impacted the liquid, the several hundred-ton ship not even causing a splash. The ship was quickly devoured, the hungry liquid creeping over the surface of the ship with a supernatural speed. Soon, nothing remained of the ship. The only signs that it had even existed at all were memories and paper logs. None of which would tell the story of this ship, none of which would tell the stories of the people who had lived onboard.

Angela cleared her throat. In the dead silence of the bastion, the noise sounded like a gunshot.

“Pilot, make for the merchant, all ahead full.  Quartermaster, set condition two throughout the ship, and secure the ship from general quarters. Comms, make a note in the ship’s log and forward it to Landing and the Company. Sighted two pirate vessels, sunk same. In pursuit of a third.”

The officers murmured their acceptance. The bastion remained quiet. Angela sat back down in her chair. The Eagle could have survived, should have survived. She had no idea why the crew would work so hard at recovering the ship only to leave it for the Dark. It made no sense. She shook her head. That was a problem for later. For now, she had a ship to catch.

1gwtji3,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholism/comments/1gwtji3/i_am_a_senior_in_highschool/,i am a senior in highschool,"i’m barely 18, and i think i have a drinking problem. i started drinking one year before starting high school, it’s run of the mill in my country and up until last year, it was all good, i would drink on nights out or at parties and birthdays, a fast pregame with something strong shared between multiple people and i would be set, wobbly for the night but nothing bad. It changed last summer when they had to roll me out on a gurney from a music festival. i am transgender, and had gone through a tough breakup some time before, and on that night i was feeling especially shitty, so i just drank all i could get my hands on, from everyone who had to offer. i was 17. i don’t think my parents have trusted me since, they dont accept me either and i don’t think my habit makes sense to them, since they aren’t drinkers at all. i would go out with friends and drink against their wished even after the festival, where the doctors told me i had been in a coma. i didnt care, to some extent i still think i dont, in the circle of crash-outs, it’s actually seen as admirable to go through something like that…kids younger than me have told me how much they respect me for it, it’s truly messed up. 
The fact that I am in my final year of highschool, and that i am not particularly good at it is not helping. My gender identity has taken up most of my mental space for a while, it’s anguishing living in a body you dislike to such extent, and i feel like over the past year my brain has deteriorated greatly. I can’t really retain much information, so I can’t mantain acceptable grades, I almost failed math every year. I take private tutoring, but no matter how hard my teacher tries, it doesn’t stick. So, after school coffee runs became beer drinking hang outs. If there’s no one to hang out with, I just buy a few from the convenience store and drink them on a random bench in a playground. I come home drunk after school more often than i would like to admit. If i don’t drink for more than a week my friends start seeing changes in my behaviour, i become erratic. So i want to go out for drinks again.
Last month i came home from a halloween party blackout drunk, i couldn’t even walk, i kept falling, i dont even know how i got in my uber, all because i couldn’t not buy cheap liquor and chase it with a few beers afterwards.
I go to metal concerts where i get drunk and sweat it out in mosh pits, because i feel so worthless, stupid and like i was born broken, but drunk me is someone the guys wanna mosh with, someone girls find “fun” and who they don’t mind flirting with, someone who is outgoing and funny. I can say that i at least don’t do really embarrassing stuff when i’m drunk, but i do throw myself at girls, just to feel less lonely.
i started wanting to drink before school too, just to get through the day easier. sometimes i wonder if i even tried to have a good day when i woke up in the morning.
i typed this at 1:30 AM on a school night because i’m stuck on a math assignment that is due first thing tomorrow and i’m stuck on it, and i just wish i could have a beer.
i dont want to be stupid, and i dont want to be drunk. i want to be able to get a good grade to get into a university where i can be a student who goes to parties every once in a while, have a few drinks like everybody else and then call it a day, i don’t like who i’m turning into.",1,1732231571.0,alcoholism,1,1.0,False

Whether your OC is a noble steeped in tradition, a traveling merchant navigating mystical disruptions, or a wandering adventurer with secrets of their own, there's always a story waiting to unfold.

We have recently made new additions and lore updates!

**What Makes Us Unique?**

*A World Alive with Magic -* [*https://discord.gg/*NYJ8xnQE](https://discord.gg/NYJ8xnQE)

Dynastra's magic is woven into its fabric, but it comes with challenges. From arcane decay to dangerous magical outbreaks, your OC could be called to assist in restoring balance. Discover the truths behind these phenomena, form pacts with powerful entities, or delve into the mysterious world of pact-breakers who defy the rules of magic.

**Community-Driven Events**

Our server thrives on community and storytelling. Whether you're looking for small, everyday encounters or sprawling arcs, our events bring characters together:

\- Enchanting Festivals: Celebrate life and magic with seasonal gatherings, performances, and culinary delights.

\- Mysterious Mission\*: Investigate magical disturbances, unearth ancient artifacts, and confront dangerous creatures.

\- Elegant Balls & Spirited Gatherings: Form alliances, ignite rivalries, or simply enjoy a glass of wine with new friends.

**A Space for Every Character**

\- Build Your World: Set up your character's home, shop, or caravan. While channel ownership is limited to approved spaces, every OC can leave their mark on the server's world.

\- Adapt to Mystery: From arcane investigators to reluctant heroes, there's a role for every personality in Dynastra's ever-changing magic-scape.

\- All Are Welcome: Nobles, nomads, seasoned adventurers, and magical creatures alike are embraced here.

**Dynamic Magic and Pacts**

Magic isn’t just a tool—it’s alive and often unpredictable:

\- Pacts: Forge agreements with ancient beings, granting your OC unique abilities and connections at a cost. Will your OC honor their pact or walk the dangerous road of a pact-breaker?

\- Magical Outbreaks: Face the consequences of failing spells and crumbling enchantments. Your OC might find themselves saving a town—or causing an even bigger disaster.

\- Mysteries to Solve: Join others to investigate the Empire’s growing magical instability. What—or who—is causing this decay?

**Slice-of-Life with Depth**

At its heart, **Dynastra** is a place for the everyday moments:

\- Relax in the Hot Springs: Or sip coffee in a quiet café, enjoy a bustling marketplace, or visit the serene countryside.

\- Forge Meaningful Connections: Whether your OC seeks friendship, romance, or rivalry, their story matters.

\- Blend Ordinary and Epic: From tending a shop to uncovering ancient secrets, every action plays a part in Dynastra’s living world.

**Your Story Awaits**

Whether your character is seeking adventure, solving mysteries, or finding a home in a turbulent magical world, the **Dynastra Empire** offers an immersive space where their journey can unfold. With a blend of everyday charm, magical chaos, and endless opportunities for connection, your OC's story is only just beginning.",1,1732231347.0,DiscordGroupRP,0,1.0,False
1gwtg4u,https://www.reddit.com/r/fountainpens/comments/1gwtg4u/an_appreciation_post_for_lamy_safari/,An appreciation post for Lamy Safari.,"To provide a bit of context as to why I gained this appreciation for the Lamy Safari, I would need to start from my university days. The university I went to was a relatively 'safe' place. Many days I would forget my pen at my study table and come the next day to find it exactly where I left it; hence, my EDC pen was solely based on which pen I wanted to use that day.

Recently, I graduated and found a job. At the same time, I became wary of my forgetful nature. As a consequence, I decided to stick to a 'less valuable' pen as my EDC. This EDC pen turned out to be a violet Lamy Safari. In my mind, this Lamy Safari wasn't anything special. I bought it on a random day because I liked the color and never used it much, so I inferred that I would be able to get over the grief quite quickly, in case I lost it.

The first few weeks have been very busy for both me and my Safari. My new job proved to have a steep learning curve. It was only yesterday that I could finally have some time to sit down, sip a cup of coffee, and write an overview of a book I recently finished. I, of course, chose one of the fancier pens that I have, but one strange thing happened as I started writing: it didn't work! The pen had simply dried up from not being used, but in a moment of time, it was back in form.

But this incident made me reflect upon my experience with the Safari. In the last few weeks, my Safari didn't fail to write except for a handful of times, and those times I was certain that it didn't have ink. The pen is so reliable that the moment the nib touches the paper, you can be sure that it will leave a line. No matter what ink you put into it, it keeps working. I personally changed inks twice, without cleaning it, and yet it performed without any hiccups. On top of that, you can throw the Safari in the deepest corner of your bag or put it in your drawer and forget it, and still, it would refuse not to write. Even if you put it in your pocket, the clip will bite into it with all its might. It is admirable how much reliability and robustness this pen hides beneath its unappealing and austere plastic body.

Having said that, is the Lamy Safari a better pen than some of the fancier pens I have? No. I personally enjoy the part of the hobby where you pick a particular kind of ink to go with your pen, spend time taking care of it, and take enjoyment when the pen performs well after many years. The Safari, on the other hand, is made to be a workhorse pen. Its specific purpose is to keep working without much maintenance, and for that reason, I guess I won't pick the Safari as my favorite. On the other hand, if a veteran in this hobby comes up and says the Lamy Safari is their favorite pen, I would understand. Any of you folks have any such stories to share, for a particular pen that you began to appreciate?",6,1732231313.0,fountainpens,1,0.88,False

I’m looking for advice regarding a job application process that started in late August. I’ve gone through four rounds of interviews so far: an initial screening, two in-person interviews (one of which was an executive panel with a case study), and a coffee chat with team members last week.

During the executive panel, I was told to expect an answer within three weeks. However, it’s now been four weeks, and there have been delays. The recruiter initially mentioned the hiring manager was on vacation, and now they’re saying the delay is due to internal processes.

At this point, I’m wondering:

	•	Is this a sign that they’re considering another candidate and keeping me as a backup?
	•	Am I being strung along, and should I stop putting energy into this opportunity?

I’d love to hear your thoughts or similar experiences.

Work drained me, gym sessions were half-hearted, and by the time I got home, I just wanted to sit down with a show on while scrolling through my phone. A friend of mine who works as a pharmacist suggested I try this supplement called EndoPump that he uses. It's a natural aphrodisiac that's supposed to improve your overall energy as well. I looked into it and was a bit skeptical at first but saw all the supporting studies they had along with the money back guarantee so thought it was worth a shot.

A couple of weeks in, my wife started commenting on how I seemed “different.” At first, I thought she was talking about my mood or how I was doing things around the house. But she meant everything. Her words, I was more present, more engaged, and let’s just say, more confident in ways I hadn’t been for a while if you know what I mean.

That’s when it hit me, I really did feel different. My energy wasn’t just better; it was consistent. I wasn’t crashing mid-afternoon, and I wasn't getting my coffee cravings. My workouts improved, too, heavier lifts and longer sessions where I wasn't quitting on my self during sets. But the biggest win? Feeling like myself again, the version of me I thought was long gone due to age or the stresses of life.

The best part? It wasn’t just me noticing. My wife’s appreciation was proof enough that this stuff was working. Posting this for anyone else who's in the same position that I was, I don't know if it's a placebo effect or what but it works for me.

1gwtanh,https://www.reddit.com/r/tea/comments/1gwtanh/hojicha_appreciation_yap_session/,Hojicha appreciation yap session,"I don't see too many post related to hojicha tea so here's one

My tea hyperfixation actually started with matcha powder that I bought on a whim. Since that day I was making matcha lattes 1-2 times a day. Once I realized that I couldn't drink matcha past a certain time of day if I valued my sleep at all, I discovered hojicha (powder) as an alternative.

Due to many factors Including:
- High demand + social media trending was stressing the matcha supply
- online options domestically were expensive and ones internationally had high shipping costs, as well as long shipping times
- smallest available size of 20g doesn't make sampling affordable
- I literally had to cancel an order of two 30g tins ($56 total with shipping) that I had ordered a month prior that was being delayed due to shortages


I had decided to pivot to loose leaf teas which I had no prior interest in. But I figured hojicha would be a good place to start since it was something I already like the taste of, was affordable at 80g for $16, and was forgiving steeping wise.

Now I've fallen down the rabbit hole of Chinese tea and have a pretty modest collection including black, white, sheng, shou and oolong. The only ""green"" tea and Japanese tea for that matter i have is hojicha which stands out from the rest due to its coffee adjacentness and intoxicating aroma.

 I don't really have an interest in green teas in general except for matcha, mainly because I drink them as sweetened lattes, where as I drink tea as is. But hojicha is in it's own category flavor wise that I keep going back to.

Firstly, I wish they would stop making the characters talk like they’re be stabbed after every word. They talk so depressing with no expression. 

This game is basically about a girl who couldn’t vocally take up for herself so instead she shapeshifts and ruins people’s lives bc she can’t tell people how she really feels. 

I for one chose to save Arcadia Bay so I’m not in the group that was upset that the game chose that option, I do feel like they could’ve adjusted storylines based on what you chose. 

The scene where Lucas was outed at the turtle  was so underwhelming. I literally was waiting for him to get flamed, just for whole scene to be overstimulated with the background people talking. Vinh ran off of stage over a small threat? Oh yeah a girl kills herself just bc someone plagiarized her.. 

I didn’t even know Reggie was gay. Surprised me when he was upset I chose to kiss Vinh. 

Chapter 4 when they’re sitting in Max’s living room having the talk was a veryyyyyy long scene. 

I know what I’m saying is all over the place but so was this game 💀

Hmm what else.. yeah I zoned out in the last chapter at the scene where I kept going through the motel door. I can’t remember half of my choices I just know I was fed up by that point and didn’t choose to stand with Sofi. She got her book cancelled and made everyone else’s life difficult so I was over her at the end lmao. 

I realized there was an option to get Moses coffee for him and I didn’t realize I had to do that. He was at the coffee shop before I got there why didn’t he get his own fucking coffee 😂

I think they should work on the background characters conversations. There were a lot of conversations I was interested in but like I said the characters talk so damn slow even a turtle would be jealous. 

Ok.. I think that’s all…. Oh yeah wait the ending was horrible. And I hope to not see any of these soft ass characters again. 

This game is good to play if you have nothing else to do but if you’re expecting amazing…. This ain’t it. ",7,1732230652.0,lifeisstrange,4,0.63,False

The truth (which I learned a couple weeks later because something was bugging me) is that due to having different cultures, there was a part of her that could never come out with me.
I got mad at the fact that she lied to me. I understood her reason, but the fact that she lied really made me angry. Our relationship (6 months) was really good, she claimed to really love me, but all of a sudden she broke up with me and lied to me.

I was getting over her until 2 weeks later she sends me a text saying ""I miss you a lot"". I replied and she asked if I wanted to get coffee one day. I said yes and we texted a bit for a week, were she was being super nice, sending smiley faces and all that. The day before getting coffee she said she had a fever and she couldn't go, but asked to meet 2 days later because she ""really wanted to get coffee"" with me. I said ok, text me the day before... but she never texted.

I don't understand why she did that. Why she lied to me not once but twice, why she came back and then disappeared.

I went out again around 9:30pm. I was working with someone else (to whom I am not beholden) and hanging out (smoked a joint and came home around 11). On the way back, he and I were 100 meters from the betting shop. Suddenly, at the moment when I realized that we were close, I felt a slight twist in my stomach, for a second I felt it clearly, and then the ""dopamine"" went from my stomach to my head. At that moment I felt the need to gamble, which I argued that I didn't need to. I felt like a winner, I felt that I touched the opponent with whom I am fighting and over whom I achieved victory this time. The feeling is amazing. After that I didn't even realize that I had passed the casino (where I always played), after 100m I realized that I had passed it and then I didn't want to go back. I come back home and I'm in my bed ready for tomorrow's shift at work. Every day I am stronger and stronger. I am aware that I use everything with my head, I am aware that they answer, I already know about my every reaction in life, the only question is whether I am stronger than my opponent in my mind.

Because the good always gives an explanation why he is good, while the bad always show that the good was right. I believe that the man who listens well the more he is smarter, while the victory of the bad in you makes a fool out of you while you cheat while drunk. While you're drunk, you're making a fool of yourself.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

Hey y’all, just completed my run from Melbourne to Perth (Bunbury) on my cbr500r in 4 days.


Here’s what I took:
- Bag on my back full of clothes and a towel
- Swag with sleeping bag 

In my second bag;
- 5 litre jerry can
- Tyre repair kit and foot pump
- Chain lube 
- Basic maintanence tools 
- Canned fruit

Some notes on the trip;
- Took a small 5 minute break at each fuel stop 
- Didn’t fill the jerry until I reached Port Augusta to avoid extra weight 
- Didn’t see any cops or any animals, traffic itself was very light from Port Augusta to Collie
- My bike has a range of 370km on a full tank before reserve, but with the extra weight, only 320km


Monday the 18th, I left Broadford, Vic, at 5am, 
Stopped in at Inglewood cafe, got a big breakfast and coffee. Then I only took fuel stops until Renmark, where I stopped for 30 minutes to have lunch and properly stretch. 
Then there were no more food stops until I reached Echo holiday parks, Port Pirie, at roughly 4:30pm. 
a powered site there was only roughly $30-$40. The pub across the road has some great food.


Tuesday the 19th, left Port Pirie at 5am, then straight up to Port Augusta, and over to Ceduna. Due to how early I left, no food was available in Port Augusta, so I had my breakfast in Ceduna. Then the real trek began, it was long and dusty and dry, but thankfully not hot, from Ceduna I stopped at quite a few roundhouses over to Eucla. Never got close to running out of fuel, even when skipping a couple roadhouses. I arrived at Eucla at 2:30pm (Eucla Time) and decided to book a room to treat myself for my birthday, the room was $200, but off memory the camp sites were only $20. Food was great.


Wednesday the 20th, Left Eucla at 5am, I stopped at each roadhouse along the way, had some small bites and some canned fruit. Make sure you keep yourself entertained on this one, after Eucla it honestly feels worse than the Nulla, it’s essentially 700km of straight road until you hit Norseman. The puncture repair kit came in handy as on my way from Balladonia - Norseman, my tyre went flat, so here I was on the side of the road, pumping my tyre back up with the foot pump. Anyway got through it, made my way down to Esperance (2pm) for the night and stayed at the RAC caravan park (bday gift from a friend) it was $50 off memory. 

Thursday the 31st, 2900km down, only 600km left. Left Esperance at 4:30 in the morning, as soon as the sun was up. Plenty of fuel along the way, stopped twice for a small bite, but then gunned it the last bit of distance, made it into Bunbury by 12pm. Got lunch with my mate and lazed about for the rest of the day. 


Thanks to those who supported and gave advice, it all came in handy, and to those that told me not to, you fuelled my motivation more, so thank you as well. 

It was a surreal experience crossing the country on my 23rd birthday, definitely going to travel more this way, but maybe on a more comfortable bike. 

Thanks all. ",16,1732230167.0,AussieRiders,2,1.0,False

1gwsyym,https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1gwsyym/am_i_doing_this_wrong_or_expecting_too_much/,Am I doing this wrong or expecting too much? ,"Hi all, I’ve been doing BW workouts since late last year, gradually learning and sticking to a mostly stable routine based on Recommended Routine but not 100% the same (3x a week, relatively consistently except for 2 longer 3-6week breaks around vacations and some illness).
I’m a 30F, short and skinny (started at 51kg) with a hard time gaining weight or visible muscle.

>>> Goals
- Gain weight (target: 60kg, mostly lean muscle, especially arms and abs).
- Get stronger, mainly to improve my climbing performance.

>>> Progress So Far
- I gained ~7-8kg, mostly in my legs/butt (a bit awkward since my routine is mostly upper-body-focused, nvm). I think it’s mostly fat, but I don’t feel/look fat, so that’s okay.
- Abs are stronger but less visible due to some belly fat gain. Arms look no bigger when relaxed but are toned when I flex.
- I went from 0 pull-ups to ~4 with good form and improved my hanging leg lifts (almost straight legs now, compared to barely doing bent knees before).

>>> Issues
- Climbing Progress:
Despite BW strength gains, I see little improvement in climbing. Specifically, my grip/forearm strength hasn’t improved much. Even with a lot of hanging in my workouts, my grip doesn’t feel stronger. Overall strength seems even lower given the fatigue mentioned below. (yes I realize the most obvious answer will be climbing more but I kinda thought I would feel some kind of improvement)

- Forearm Pain:
I experience quite strong forearm pain when doing dips on horizontal bars (focusing on good form), especially during the lowering phase of my last rep. This subsides quickly but limits my ability to do dips. I’ve been told I have hyper-mobile elbows, so I try to avoid overextending, but it doesn’t help. I stopped doing those altogether but I'd like to have them in the routine.

- Fatigue:
For months, I’ve felt extremely tired, even though I only work out 3x a week (+ 1 run or climb occasionally, not even every week). I sleep 8.5-9 hours a night, eat a lot (mostly healthy, supplementing protein, BCAAs, and creatine), and drink 2 coffees daily. I’ve also been quite anxious/mildly depressed lately, which might play a role.

>>> Questions
- Does this seem like reasonable progress for ~1 year?
- What should I focus on to improve strength and climbing performance (especially grip/forearms)? 
- How do I deal with constant fatigue? Why does 3x/week feel like too much?
- Should I swap one BW workout for climbing, or climb more and do BW less?
- Should I switch to dumbbells to target forearms better, or combine them into one routine?
- Forearm pain during dips—what could be causing this, and how do I fix it?

She told me that is very patient and is totally okay to wait.","Hi guys, I'm in a very confused situation right now. I matched with this amazing girl on Hinge (we are the same age, 30). We hit it off right away and we texted, and flirted non-stop for the next couple days, until I started my 6 weeks trip out of the country. I tried to see her before I left but the timing didn't work and she said she didn't wanted to rush. She also told me that I'm her strongest connection and she is very patient, she said she will wait for me.

In the beginning, she was all over me, waiting for my text, as me random questions (which I loved), complimented me, and teased. But since I began my travel, I went cold almost immediately, she said she didn't want to rush things as we haven't met each other yet but we acted like we already started. Said said that we must slow down, but to me it's like suppressing feelings. She told me this before but it's more like flipping a switch to me so I was really confused, also concerned because she was exhausted (we both have anxiety because we want to be out of the dating scene). She didn't text me the entire day after, and the day after that just a couple of one-liner.

Because of this sudden switch, I was confused but I didn't want to ruin my one of the lifetime opportunity to travel this long, so I confronted her (selfish, I know). And she said she didn't want to fall too hard too quick, which I understood. But after this, the dynamic totally shifted in my opinions. I told her that either we go 100 or 0 (pause our talk until I get back from my trip, and whatever happens in between doesn't matter to me, if she hit it off with somebody else, I will also very happy for her), cause I want us to focus on other things as well... Before I confronted her, I deleted all of my dating apps cause I felt like I will have to go over this again unless my trips are over, I also told her that as well. 

Now I felt like the conversation is kind of forced, I was always the one who started, she no longer asked me questions, or complimented me, the tease are also gone. I don't have any materials to work with despite I tried to tell her my current travel stories, ask her questions, jokes, and what not. Since I'm traveling, I'm almost always available to reply, and I understand she's working. This might be the reason why I affected strongly by the dynamic shift. I don't know what to do, I view this as a fire slowly going out because I lost my traction since she flipped the switch. She said she still wanted us to talk and get to know each other, and she still wanted to meet me. There are 5 weeks left and I felt like I already at loss.

She's still going on dates and what not be she kept assuring me that she wanted to meet me. I suggested we tried some Covid style dating, like showing her around the town that I will be at or some sort of movies night, virtual coffee dates, etc. but they won't be the same.

Am I overthinking because I have so much free time? I haven't gotten any connections this strong before, so I didn't want to lose my chance but this is making me very miserable. I am counting days... I don't enjoy my trip as much anymore. (I did 2 months trip prior to this and it was the best time of my life). 

What should I do? I'm very anxious and confused right now. Hopefully somebody can put some sense in me. (Please call me out and ask questions if needed)

A brief summary about this, is nakilala ko siya sa isang bpo company somewhere in south. Actually wala talaga akong plano na magkagusto sa kahit na kanino kasi broken din ako that time(on a no label rel), he was my support during my stay doon sa company na yon. I can describe him as matalino, process wise and mabait (medyo masungit nga lang ).

Maybe the reason why I had a crush on him eh, noong panahong, binubully ako sa team namin kasi naman mahilig ako mag overshare, he was the one who protected me , about sa bullying he was the one who reached out. At ayun hanggang sa gumaan ang loob at nakikipagbiruan na ako sa kanya. From being our support naging supervisor sya , from that small win lagi ako nasa likod nya. Bago pa yan mahilig na ako mag treats sa friends ko kahit di sa work. From buying him coffee, burger and noong napromote sya binilhan ko sya ng bento cake.

I didn’t even realize that I was really falling hard na pala, una nag confess ako na may crush ako sa kanya wayback in July 2023 noong andun pa ako. And until the last conversation we had last September 2023. He unfriended me after I left the company noong December last year. So ang ginawa ko nirestrict ko sya sa messenger pero di pa rin sya nawala sa isip ko, kaya ibinaling ko sa ibang bagay.

Hanggang sa napanaginipan ko sya nitong taon na to, ayun nag message pala talaga sya, sobrang iyak ko noong nabasa ko yun February 2024 yung last na message from him, nabasa ko March 2024 na 

Hanggang sa nagkita ulit kami ng personal nitong April para makamusta sila (kasama nya yung friend niya na co-TL nya din), grabe tumatalon ang puso ko sa tuwa. At doon inamin ko na sya pa rin hanggang sa mga panahon na yun. Mga ilang buwan lang din , may di kami napagkasunduan, doon na lumamig . Hindi ko na rin pinilit kasi baka mag-away lang kami.

Pero sa puntong yon, sasabihin ko na dapat na kung gaano ko sya kamahal eh. Kaso di naman na ako biglang kinausap. Sana lang sinabi sakin bakit umiiwas.

Sana alam mong minahal kita “eco” sa paraang alam ko sana alam mo yun. Hanggang ngayon sya pa rin e. Sumubok na ako makipagusap sa iba pero wala talaga.",2,1732229611.0,MayConfessionAko,0,1.0,False
