Outdoor living has become an essential part of modern home design. Patios, verandas, and balconies provide relaxing spaces where people can unwind and enjoy the outdoors. However, when rain arrives, these areas often become unusable. [Retractable rain screens](https://freedomscreens.net/about/) offer a clever solution, combining protection from the weather with flexibility and style. They make it possible to enjoy your outdoor spaces year-round, even when the skies open up.

Retractable[ rain screens](https://greenmainehomes.com/blog/rain-screens) are designed to keep out rain and wind while allowing natural light and airflow to pass through. Unlike fixed structures, these screens can be extended when needed and retracted when the weather clears, preserving open views and the sense of connection to the outdoors. This flexibility makes them ideal for regions with changing weather patterns, where sudden rain showers can interrupt outdoor activities.

One of the most practical benefits of retractable rain screens is the protection they provide to your home and furniture. Outdoor furniture, decks, and surfaces are often exposed to moisture, leading to rust, fading, or wood swelling over time. By blocking direct rainfall, these screens help reduce wear and tear, extending the life of your outdoor investments. They also prevent puddles and water damage near doors or window frames, helping to maintain your home‚Äôs condition.

Another advantage is comfort. Retractable rain screens allow you to continue enjoying your patio or balcony even during light rain. Whether it‚Äôs a quiet morning coffee or a family gathering, these screens create a cozy and sheltered environment that feels open yet protected. Their breathable design means fresh air continues to circulate, preventing that enclosed, stuffy feeling often associated with traditional enclosures.

Energy efficiency is an often-overlooked benefit. By shielding against wind and moisture, retractable rain screens help stabilize indoor temperatures in connected areas. This can reduce the need for additional heating or cooling, supporting a more sustainable and cost-effective home. During summer, they can also help shade areas from intense sunlight, keeping spaces cooler and more comfortable.

Design-wise, retractable rain screens complement a wide range of [architectural styles](https://blog.chaos.com/architectural-styles-that-changed-the-industry). Available in various materials and finishes, they blend seamlessly into both contemporary and traditional settings. Homeowners can choose between manual or motorized options, depending on convenience and budget. Because they can be hidden away when not in use, they maintain the clean, open look of your outdoor area.

Maintenance for retractable rain screens is simple and minimal. Regular cleaning with mild soap and water keeps the material clear, while periodic checks of the retracting mechanism ensure smooth operation. With proper care, these screens remain durable and functional for many years, even under frequent weather changes.

Homeowners looking for quality and design insights often turn to trusted names such as **Freedom Screens**, known for their practical approach to creating comfortable, weather-ready living spaces. Selecting the right retractable screen system can make a lasting difference in how you use and enjoy your outdoor areas.

In conclusion, **retractable rain screens** are more than a weather barrier ‚Äî they‚Äôre an investment in comfort, versatility, and long-term home value. They let you make the most of your outdoor spaces, offering a seamless transition between indoor comfort and outdoor enjoyment. Whether you live in a rainy region or simply want year-round usability, these screens provide a practical and elegant way to embrace every season without compromise.",0,1760515676.0,HomeImprovement,0,0.5,False

Few months back, when mixamo was down for few days, rigonix3d helped various users in downloading the animations they need.

But now i am tensed about the future of rigonix3d, should i run it or should i close it.  
I really want to have a motion capture suit, so that i can upload more high quality animations and provide it to community, I don't know anything about funding, but heard something about crowdfunding.  
What do you think, i rigonix3d a good idea? Or should i drop it.  
I have given my 3-4 months of dedicated hardwork while creating it.

1o752jm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1o752jm/gastritis_with_ed/,Gastritis with ED,"24 y F. I have been diagnosed with Antral gastritis through endoscopy for almost a year now and my dr wasn‚Äôt much helpful, he told me to stay on PPI for 3 weeks and I that I would get better after but I never got better so I stayed on PPI for a whole year to stop that burning. I have always had this burning feeling since I was 10 yrs old idk why but maybe bc of having a slightly difficult childhood filled with anxiety & stress & so. Now I suffer from anxiety too and get these stress episodes from living in a toxic environment that left me no choice but to resort to sports and food that‚Äôs why I kept taking PPI because I like to eat and food is my only enjoyment. Also I didn‚Äôt know that I should cut some foods for longer than 3 weeks especially that the dr didn‚Äôt mention a ‚Äúlifetime diet‚Äù. Now, and after a year I decided that I need to taper PPI but I am literally terrified of 2 things:
1- Coffee: Coffee was the only reason I took PPI, because I am already used to the dietary food considering that I work out consistently for 5 years now so my routine doesn‚Äôt include any acidic foods. As far as I know, I don‚Äôt have Ibs but I have literally tried every solution to try to poop on my own and coffee was the only triggering thing to pooping regularly every morning (although I don‚Äôt feel 100% relieved after) so if I cut PPI, morning coffee will trigger the burning sensation the whole day & every day. 
2- Eating disorders: Although I work out and have a healthy body and diet but I always get those URGES or like impulsive online ordering because of stress. and I also suffer from Food noise caused by having to eat small meals frequently so sometimes I eat sugar with meals more than I should and that‚Äôs also unfortunately triggering to my gut. 
I started today by cutting PPI and had my healthy breakfast and I feel slightly normal after but I haven‚Äôt had my coffee yet and I need to poop.
I booked an appointment to another doctor anyway to start this journey hopefully to get better but I thought about sharing this bc I feel lonely in these struggles with the Ed and Excretion",1,1760515468.0,Gastritis,1,0.99,False
1o74zd0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o74zd0,Help with pc (not sure what flair to use exactly),"Sooooo..for context: the pc is almost 10 years old, my sister built the pc with her friends who were pc building enthusiasts, the pc lasted ten years and was perfect, Now..that IM using it, ive found problems

My sister recently got two new ram sticks, which are:

\-Corsair Vengeance CMH16GX4M2E3200C16W DDR4 16gb (2X 8GB) 3200MHz 16-20-20-38 1.35V ver 3.32

The older ones were different, they were:

\-CMW16GX4M2A2666C16W memory module 16 GB (2X 8GB) DDR4 2666mhz 16-18-18-35 1.20V ver 5.30

But because they're different that doesnt work, so i took out older ones and used the newer ones

Soo..The pc has started stuttering in games like genshin or conan, with discord on as well. it doesn't stutter while doing ANYTHING else, only heavy games, all core temps are more than normal (used hwinfo and yes I do know how to read temps) nothing else has a problem (at least I don't think so?)

So I thought..well, maybe the rams are problem, so..I was thinking of doing the opposite taking out newer ones, putting in older ones back again.

\-Note that XMP is enabled, it was NEVER enabled before, so should i disable it again?

(The stuttering only really started after xmp was enabled, so now not even disabling it gets rid of it, oh and the reason the XMP was enabled in the first place and I touched the ram was because of PC force restarting every time mid heavy game (conan), but then after it stopped doing that and started stuttering, it was the advice of someone..)

And..for any extra info that might be necessary or if in case my information was wrong..the attached pictures are from HWinfo for the pc, and The bios has never been updated since 2019, all the necessary information are in the attached pic..since I don't know much about ANY of this

I've just finished diving into Tom Clancy's **[Tom Clancy Shadow of the Dragon ‚Äì Jack Ryan Book 20 ‚Äì Tom Clancy](https://pdfhive.com/tom-clancy-shadow-of-the-dragon-jack-ryan-book-20-tom-clancy/)**, and wow, it was quite the ride. If you're a fan of geopolitical thrillers that keep you glued to the page, or even if you're just looking for a new adventure, pull up a chair. I wanted to share my honest thoughts, just like I would with a friend over coffee.

***

### What's It All About (No Spoilers, I Promise!)

So, ""Shadow of the Dragon"" drops us right back into the high-stakes world of Jack Ryan. He's President, and as always, the world seems to be teetering on the edge of a new crisis. This time, it involves some really complex stuff happening on the global stage, with a focus on China and its growing influence. You've got espionage, covert operations, and lots of smart people trying to prevent utter chaos. It's the kind of book where you feel like you're right there in the Situation Room, watching all the pieces move.

***

### What I Really Enjoyed

First off, the **pacing** in this book is just fantastic. From the moment you start, there's a constant build of tension that keeps you on edge. It's not a sprint, but a steady, compelling march towards a potential global confrontation. I really appreciated how the authors (because these later Clancy books are often co-written, keeping his vision alive) managed to weave so many different plot threads together without making it feel overwhelming.

The **characters** felt true to form. Jack Ryan, of course, is the steady hand we've come to know and respect. He's faced with impossible choices, and you really get a sense of the immense pressure he's under. Even the secondary characters, from the intelligence operatives to the political figures, felt well-developed and played their parts effectively in the larger narrative.

And the **detail**! Oh, the detail. If you love a book that really immerses you in the technicalities of intelligence gathering, military strategy, and geopolitical maneuvering, this book delivers. It makes you feel incredibly smart just by reading it, learning about all the intricate workings of international relations.

***

### A Few Things to Consider

Now, nothing's perfect, right? For some readers, the sheer **depth of detail** might be a bit much. If you prefer a faster, less technical read, some of the explanations about military tech or political strategy might slow you down a little. I personally enjoy it, but I can see how it might not be for everyone.

Also, if you're completely new to the Jack Ryan universe, jumping into Book 20 might feel a tiny bit like being dropped into the middle of a long conversation. While it generally stands alone well enough, some of the character histories or ongoing political dynamics might have a bit more weight if you've read previous installments. But don't let that stop you!

***

### So, Would I Recommend It?

Absolutely, yes! If you're into political thrillers, espionage, or just enjoy a good old-fashioned high-stakes story, you should definitely give **[Tom Clancy Shadow of the Dragon ‚Äì Jack Ryan Book 20 ‚Äì Tom Clancy](https://pdfhive.com/tom-clancy-shadow-of-the-dragon-jack-ryan-book-20-tom-clancy/)** a read. It‚Äôs a solid entry in the Jack Ryan series and delivers exactly what fans expect.

***

### Tips for Diving into a Big Series Like This

For anyone new to the world of Tom Clancy or just starting a long series, here's a little friendly advice:

1.  **Don't Feel Pressured to Start from Book 1:** Seriously! While chronological order can be fun, it's totally okay to jump into a later book if the summary catches your eye. Most of these thrillers are designed to be enjoyed individually.
2.  **Embrace the Detail (or Skim Wisely):** If a paragraph is getting super technical, and it's not holding your interest, it's okay to skim. You'll often find the core plot points are still clear. The details are there to build the world, not necessarily to test you.
3.  **Take Your Time:** These aren't race-to-the-finish books. Savor the intricacies, let the tension build, and enjoy the ride.
4.  **Just Go For It!** Sometimes the biggest barrier is just starting. Pick it up, read the first chapter, and see where it takes you. You might discover your new favorite author or genre!

This book is probably best for readers who love complex plots, military fiction, and global intrigue. If you enjoy authors like Brad Thor or Vince Flynn, this will be right up your alley.

Happy reading, everyone!

1o74wip,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Gold_Cup_7879/comments/1o74wip/friends_is_a_tragicomedy/,Friends is a tragicomedy?,"
On the surface, Friends is a classic 20-minute sitcom: friends in a coffee shop, funny situations, romantic entanglements, and memorable jokes. However, the series' enduring, cross-generational success and rewatchability lies in the fact that beneath the humorous veneer lies a deeply human, often painful and complex drama. The series not only makes you laugh, but also uses comedy to make life's most difficult moments bearable and manageable.
Here are the main reasons that prove its tragicomic nature:
1. The tragic foundations of the characters
The characters in the series do not start out as blank slates; they all have serious, often traumatic pasts that define their entire personalities and humor. Their jokes are often defensive reactions to their own pain.
 * Chandler Bing: The most obvious example. His entire personality and sarcastic, commitment-phobic nature are the result of his parents' ugly divorce and his dysfunctional childhood. His humor is a protective shield against his hurts.
 * Phoebe Buffay: The character with the most tragic backstory. Her mother committed suicide, her stepfather went to prison, and she herself lived on the streets as a teenager. Her strange, eccentric behavior and songs (such as ""Smelly Cat"") are creative expressions of deep, unprocessed trauma.
 * Monica Geller: She was constantly shamed by her own parents because of her childhood obesity. Her compulsive control and orderliness, as well as her need to conform, stem from this deep insecurity.
 * Ross Geller: The series begins with a divorce, which plummets Ross's self-esteem. His hopeless romanticism and constant failures in love form a recurring tragic motif.
 * Rachel Green: Her life begins with a complete identity crisis. She has to leave everything she has known until then‚Äîher wealth, her social status, her future‚Äîbehind, which is an extremely frightening and traumatic leap into the unknown.
2. Real-life dramas in the plot
The series does not shy away from tackling tough, painful life issues, which are made digestible by the framework of comedy.
 * Infertility: Monica and Chandler's struggle with infertility is one of the most painful and realistic storylines in the series. The scene where they learn they cannot have children is pure drama, without humor. The difficulties of the subsequent adoption process also depict real pain.
 * Death and loneliness: Mr. Heckles' death is a brutal contrast to the lightheartedness of the sitcom world. The sight of the corpse and Chandler's realization that he too is heading toward a lonely end presents a deep existential crisis.
 * Family Breakdown and Humiliation: Rachel's birthday party, where she has to balance her divorcing parents, is an emotional nightmare presented in the form of a farce. Similarly, when it is revealed at her ex-fianc√©'s wedding that her parents lied about her being mentally ill and having syphilis, it is a kind of ""moral execution"" that is only resolved by Rachel's defiant triumph at the end.
3. The tragedy of the central love story
Ross and Rachel's relationship is not a simple romantic story, but a ten-year struggle filled with pain, mistakes, and bad timing.
* ""The Break"": This is not a funny misunderstanding, but the emotional epicenter of the series, a raw, painful breakup that turns an entire episode into a tense chamber drama. The fact that their friends are listening to the argument in the next room symbolizes how their tragedy shakes the entire world of their circle of friends.
 * The list: Ross wrote a list of Rachel's negative traits, a cold, intellectual betrayal that attacks the other person's deepest insecurities. This emotional wound is much harder to heal than physical infidelity.
 * The mistake at the altar: The line ""I, Ross, take you, Rachel..."" is the climax of the tragicomedy. It is an incredibly funny moment, the consequence of which is a ruined marriage and immeasurable pain for everyone involved.
In summary: Friends is a true tragicomedy because laughter here serves not to erase problems, but to survive them. The series presents the true-to-life truth that our funniest moments often stem from the most painful ones, and that friendship is the force that helps us get through tragedies‚Äîoften with the help of a good joke.

My travel was 1-month in China and 4-night stop in HK from 16th August ‚Äì 19th September 2025.

My travel route was Beijing ‚Äì Luoyang ‚Äì Dengfeng ‚Äì Kaifeng ‚Äì Chongqing ‚Äì Zhangjiajie / Wulingyuan ‚Äì Furong ‚Äì Fenghuang ‚Äì Wangxiangu ‚Äì Hengdian Film Studios ‚Äì Shanghai ‚Äì HK.

I hope this information will be useful for those planning a trip to China. I‚Äôve tried to list and describe as much as possible and highlighted some important parts. I‚Äôve added AUD prices, the hotels that I stayed at, reviewed attractions that I visited in each city or town. Its my first time writing such a report and detailed itinerary so please be kind with the feedback. Feel free to ask questions and I will respond as soon as I can. Thanks for reading!

**CHONGQING = 4 nights**

In recent years, Chongqing has become ‚Äúthe place to visit‚Äù, so, I decided to check it out! I only explored the city ‚Äì I didn‚Äôt go on any day trips to Dazu rock carvings or Wulong NP. I caught a 15min taxi, not DiDi, from my Kaifeng hotel to Kaifeng railway station, for about 13 yuan. It was a 6hr train ride to Chongqingbei (north) long-distance high-speed railway station, and I booked a 2nd class seat for $117 AUD including the Trip.com booking fee. Then, I used the metro (which is connected to the long-distance high-speed railway station) and walked 2min to my hotel. It was very easy and fast.

I stayed at **Yifeng Impression Hotel, 4 nights for $98 AUD.** It was a basic, clean, windowless room with a double bed, TV, bathroom: sit-down toilet and stand-up shower, air-con, x2 500ml bottled water per day, kettle and tea provided. You can pay a little bit more for room with a window where you get the view of a street, not the harbour or anything worth spending extra for. I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be in the room much, so no window in the room was fine by me! Laundry was free ‚Äì the staff will help you put your clothes in the washing machine and adjust it to the correct settings, they will hang your clothes up to dry (I didn‚Äôt have to wait around, I went out sightseeing so this was great!) in an open-windowed room and then you collect your clothes yourself when its dry (when I came back from sightseeing that night). I didn‚Äôt mind this, it felt like I was staying at my auntie‚Äôs place, just with another 30 rooms HAHA and for the price, its nothing to complain about. The staff will communicate with you via WeChat. There‚Äôs a lift on the main road side to get the hotel or you can use the escalators to get to the hotel. **NOTE: there are a few other hotels in the same building, which is quite common in China. I had no issues staying here and do recommend this hotel especially if you‚Äôre on a budget and just want a place to sleep and shower. I would definitely stay here again, for the price and location. It‚Äôs about 10min-15min walk to Hongyadong and Jeifangbei.** There‚Äôs also a food court underneath the hotel building, shops everywhere including malls, Luckin Coffee around the corner ‚Äì my favourite!

**Now, you can definitely explore Chongqing independently ‚Äì on your own, with Amap, walk everywhere or catch a taxi, or DiDi, to each attraction. I decided to book a private English-speaking guide to take me around for x2 full days (8am-5pm / 6pm each day) as I wanted to see as much as possible, I wanted a break from navigating and I wanted some photos with my whole body and face in the shot (I‚Äôm solo travelling and selfie sticks aren‚Äôt commonly used in China ‚Äì not that I saw at the touristy places and with all the crowds, its hard to take selfie shots too.) For the other 1.5 days, I explored on my own via metro and taxis, not DiDi. FYI, Chongqing‚Äôs taxis are yellow, like NYC taxis. In Chongqing, they nickname their taxis ‚Äúyellow Ferrari‚Äù because they often drive faster than the trains.** I visited the following x26 attractions (and I didn‚Äôt rush) in 4 days (3.5 days really, because of the 6hr train ride from Kaifeng), in Chongqing:

**Jeifangbei.** This is a must visit. **Chongqing Liberation Monument** is 28 metres tall and was the tallest tower in the area, only a few decades ago... Its crazy seeing how much has changed over the years. I found the street shopping around here quite dull, boring, I didn‚Äôt buy anything and I‚Äôm a shopper! There are several malls around here as well but I didn‚Äôt have time, or make the time, to check them out. I did take a peep in the **Chocolate Museum & Store**: many tourists stop here for at least 10mins to take photos with these life-size animals made of chocolate, and you can buy chocolate downstairs.

**Baiyi Food Street.** This is a must visit. Its only 5min walk from Chongqing Liberation Monument: it starts where you see the huge chilli statues with children (look down along the street, not up at the buildings, to find it) and ends with a building with public toilets at the T-section. There are so many restaurants, food stalls and food courts here that it would easily take a year to eat at every one of them! Many are very small eateries and sell similar types of food so you‚Äôll have to research online, check reviews to find a ‚Äúgood one‚Äù or just pick any, take a gamble. I didn‚Äôt see any long queues anywhere to indicate this is a ‚Äúmust eat‚Äù place and it wasn‚Äôt crowded when I visited, several times in 4 days. I really like the hot and sour noodles (see photo with the chilli flakes ice cream which I enjoyed as well) ‚Äì I need to find a restaurant in Sydney for the noodles or learn how to make it! There are also a few hotels, souvenir shops along this street as well. Photos 7, 8, 9, are of Bayi Food Street.

**Hongyadong.** Of course, you will visit this attraction! I went for sunset views and it was crowded but not like in the you-tube videos ‚Äì there was plenty of space, I didn‚Äôt bump into people and I could see my shoes! I started exploring from the very top of the building, 11th floor, walked around every floor, used the toilets and hopped down the stairs or escalators to the next floor, and all the way down til I reached the street level. I enjoyed it: I read many people advised not to waste time going inside the building as there‚Äôs ‚Äúnothing to see‚Äù but I found a few floors were interesting and it was a nice break from walking out in the sun. I‚Äôd say, allocate 1hr, if you can, and its better to walk down through the building to the main viewing area, than walk up, right?

**Hong‚Äôensi Forest Temple.** This is a must visit, at night, when its dark. See the last photo attached ‚Äì its not a photoshop image, I take photos with my Samsung S20 Ultra mobile phone. (Yes, that's an old phone now but its still working great!) There are two main entry points to get to this temple and its inside a huge park. I travelled via metro to Dashiba Station, Exit 3A and followed my Amap which made me walk pass a huge shopping mall and it took around about 15mins to get to the park, then climbed 30min up a mountain of stairs (OMG I realised how unfit I was here and there‚Äôs no lamp posts so I had to use my mobile phone flashlight), then I got lost wandering around trying to find the temple for 10min (when you‚Äôre walking around the park and looking up, I couldn‚Äôt see the temple, only trees). You don‚Äôt need much time here, 30min-45min is enough to go inside the building, take photos of the city views on the balconies (see second last photo attached) and then take photos of the building from the outside. To exit, I walked with everyone else along a flat footpath and down a set of stairs to the north gate which leads you to the main street ‚Äì many people visit Hong‚Äôensi Forest Temple from the north gate side as taxis can drop you off at the foot of the stairs. I knew this but decided to give the metro a go and boy, it was one hell of a walk!

**Taoran Juyuwei 360 Wanguochao food block.** I didn‚Äôt know about this place. My guide told me and I‚Äôm incredibly grateful! Put in Amap that food block name ‚Äì basically a small outdoor food court area, its about 5min walk heading west from the north gate of Hong‚Äôensi Forest Temple. Try to get here before 9pm and walk to the far end where the fountains area. You have to stand (there‚Äôs no seats) to watch the **free 15min show: Dashuhua or Da Tie Hua which loosely translates to Iron Fire Flower.** I visited on a Friday night and show started around 9:20pm. It was packed and its a small area (maybe 300 people can stand here, not 1,000 people?) so its best to come early to find a good viewing spot or you‚Äôll end up taking photos of people‚Äôs heads and their cameras! There were x3 men, topless and probably covered in some kind of skin protective cream, who turned molten iron into fireworks. Google it for more information and a better explanation. It was my first time seeing this, live, so I really enjoyed it ‚Äì see photo 12 & 13 attached. From here, its takes about 30min and less than 30 yuan via taxi, not DiDi, to Hongyadong. I left here close to 10pm and many people were waiting for their DiDis. I just waved a yellow Ferrari over and jumped in...

**Deyi World.** My guide suggested visiting this place so I went but I think I got here too late? The first photo attached is of Deyi World, taken around 10:15pm on a Saturday night. I went into a convenient store to grab a cold drink and snack, walked out and many of the lights were off by 10:30pm (within 15min). I recommend coming here around 9pm, to be safe. If you come early, there‚Äôs plenty of places to eat, drink and a few shops to explore while you wait for the lights to turn on. I also read there‚Äôs a night market nearby‚Ä¶ Catch the metro to Jiaochangkou Station, Exit 9 for Deyi World.

**9pm 20min drone show on a Saturday night.** This was my first drone show experience and I do recommend it. There are several viewing areas like stand along Nanbin Road or watch it on a riverboat cruise... I got to the Chongqing Grand Theatre (didn‚Äôt go inside) via metro and stood at the massive platform area, top level (you can go downstairs) around 8:45pm. If you want to see the drone show from a frontal viewpoint then head to Nanbin Road and get there early and be prepared for traffic to get back to your hotel (that‚Äôs what I heard). If you choose to watch on the Chongqing Grand Theatre side, then you‚Äôll be seeing it all back to front (just flip your photos around to read the English writing). From my understanding, the images projected change every month? At the end of August, I saw drones creating the following images: a family admiring the stars, kitten with a butterfly, dog with a ball, two kids eating ice cream with the galaxy behind them, a Sichuan opera face-changing mask sequence, Quan Yin, a girl in a book, and a car coming out of a book. **From Chongqing Grand Theatre, you can walk up onto the red Qiansimen Bridge to Hongyadong and take photos of Hongyadong on your right-hand side. I didn‚Äôt because I had no energy left, so I just continued walking past the red Qiasimen Bridge for 10mins and stopped for a nice view of Hongyadong here (see photo 10 attached).**

**Ciqikou ancient town.** I spent a lot more time here than I had planned to, maybe 5hrs? I ended up wandering through many quiet alleyways with local handicraft shops and through a park, pass a huge hotel, a newly built area that‚Äôs empty ‚Äì not open yet, and its also where the Chongqing 1949 Show Theatre is located (the west side of the ancient town). I had a great time ‚Äì lots of cheap and quirky souvenir shops, chilli stores, eateries, drinks, dessert, creative and cute d√©cor everywhere, lanterns (would be pretty at night) and colourful staircases to climb. There‚Äôs also a **Mahjong Museum** which was a pleasant surprise ‚Äì free entry, 45min is enough to walk through and admire all the different types of mahjong pieces and boxes. I also visited Baolun Temple which had a steep but short staircase and walked the main pedestrian strip to the wharf with the big archway that you see in many photos online. I caught the metro through Liziba Station to get to Ciqikou.

**Guanyue Temple** aka Ying Yang Temple. Now, getting to this temple was a mission! I got into a taxi, not a DiDi, and driver put the address in his mobile phone but he couldn‚Äôt find the way to the entry point of the temple? He ended up dropping me off a residential area where I asked the locals for directions but they either didn‚Äôt want to help a tourist or didn‚Äôt recognise the temple name and photos. It took me 10mins figure out how to get to this temple, with Amap, and another 20min to go up the mountain via a pedestrian walkway through the overlapping highways to the temple entrance. Once I arrived, I saw a carpark on the right hand side ‚Äì maybe the taxi driver took a wrong turn and didn‚Äôt know how to go back? Anyways, it was a lovely 1hr visit! The temple had a restaurant and outdoor seating area that was packed, small garden, souvenir shop and several halls to explore. I was glad I visited this temple as I really wanted to see the ying yang symbol (see photo 15 attached) but only visit if you have time and love going to temples.

**1hr Qingyu Banquet dinner & show** booked on Klook. I reached out to Klook and spoke to someone via WeChat to give me the exact address with photos to show the taxi driver, not DiDi, how to get here. I showed my paper booking at the ticket office and got my paper ticket, then waited about 45min (looked for the toilet, had a cold drink, an ice cream and charged my mobile phone) before they let people in. I had great central seats, ate the entire 10-course meal (was a fusion of Chinese & Western cuisine) and played some traditional games afterwards, outside. I walked 2min to the highway, waited about 5min to hail a taxi over, not DiDi, to take me back to my hotel ‚Äì about 20min drive and 25 yuan. There were only a handful of other foreigners here, mostly Chinese tourists.

**Great Hall of the People / Auditorium** with a guide. I dropped by for 10min to take photos. I think its better at night, when its lit up or go in the afternoon when the sun is setting in the opposite direction. I was here before 9am and the Great Hall of the People was dark, or darker, (no sunlight shining on the building) than I had expected. Oh well. I‚Äôll have to revisit for a night photo-shoot! I didn‚Äôt go inside the building.

**Liziba Station** with a guide. I know people think its overrated and nothing ‚Äúspecial‚Äù but its my first time seeing a train run through a building and I liked the area with all the graffiti or street art d√©cor. I got to take some great photos here, thanks to my guide. 15min stop is plenty, depending on the crowds and time of day / night. I caught a metro through Liziba Station when I went to visit Ciqikou on my own, on another day. I didn‚Äôt go inside the building.

**Erling / E‚Äôling Park** with a guide. 45min-1hr is good but if you want to relax and wander through the whole park then maybe 2hr-3hr would be better. There‚Äôs a nice garden and pond, souvenir shop selling goose-related items or goose-decorated merchandise (the park name loosely translates to goose), toilets, and the tower that offers panoramic views of the city. I went here in the morning where there were only 20 people so it was a pleasant stop. I think it would be very crowded at night.

**Crown Escalator** with a guide. For some reason, I thought this would be interesting and a very long ride but it was disappointing and so short. It costs 2 yuan to ride it, one way, and there‚Äôs staff yelling out to hold onto the handrails. My guide said there‚Äôs been accidents on the escalators so they‚Äôre very cautious, on high alert, determined to prevent accidents now. Skip it unless you have 20min to spare and you‚Äôre in the area.

**Huguang Huiguan Guild Hall** with a guide. I don‚Äôt think many tourists visit here. I felt like I had the place all to myself! 45min-1hr is enough time to wander through all the rooms, a little museum, take photos etc. You can watch a paid show here too, I didn‚Äôt. Add another hour if you want to see the show and it depends on the day‚Äôs scheduling too, you might have to wait a bit.

**Luohan Temple / Arhats** with a guide. Highly recommend visiting this temple for 1hr. Its incredible how this temple was designed and built: its like they only had a limited amount of land and wanted to utilise every inch of it! The rooftops of each building are very close to each other and its an interesting contrast with the modern skyscrapers in the background. Before you walk into the Luohan Hall that showcases over 500 gold-coloured Buddhist statues, read the information (its in Chinese and English) explaining what to do... You can seek your fortune here but not via Kau Chim (Chinese name) or Omikuji (Japanese name); pray and shake a box until a stick with a number drops out. Instead, there are three different ways... I chose to walk in and count each statue on my right-hand side, until I reached my age. So if you‚Äôre 21, you count 20 statues and stop at the 21st one = that statue will give you your fortune. It doesn‚Äôt take long, say 5min and only cost 10 yuan (maybe 20 yuan ‚Äì I can‚Äôt remember and I didn‚Äôt note it down, sorry) to get the fortune translated from a book (take a photo) at the exit.

**Kuxinglou** with a guide. This place is exactly how you see it in social media. 30min is plenty to wander around and take photos. Its very cool to see how Chongqing is built here, with all the different levels, pathways, stairs etc.

**Guotai Red Arts Centre aka red chopsticks building** with a guide. I didn‚Äôt go inside. Just stopped by for photos and I returned at night to see it lit up and more photos.

**Laojun Temple** with a guide. This is my favourite temple visit on this trip to China. I loved the panoramic city view from the top, the 5th hall ‚Äì see photo 14. Its free to visit this temple and you‚Äôll need 2hrs as there are many staircases to climb to reach the top, explore all the halls, a few shops selling religious items, there was a free art gallery exhibit when I was there ‚Äì above a vegetarian restaurant that offers a simple, healthy tofu, egg and rice meal for 10 yuan-15 yuan (depends what you add). Come here in the morning to start your day. It might be best to arrive via taxi, or DiDi. You can catch a local bus but it will take longer...

**Huangjueya Old Street** with a guide. We arrived here around 11am and only walked through this place as the museums, many stores and eateries were closed. There‚Äôs public toilets (yay, I needed to go!) and a few cafes with outdoor garden seating areas that were crowded. 30min-45min is enough time to explore this place unless you‚Äôre going to visit the museums and stores, if they are open. At the end of the street is a main road where you can catch taxis, or DiDis ‚Äì jump in quickly, to go to your next destination.
**Xiahaoli / Longmenhao** with a guide. There‚Äôs many eateries ‚Äì Western and Chinese, dessert and drink bars, handicraft and souvenir stores here. It has a more ‚Äúmodern‚Äù and ‚Äúhip‚Äù vibe to it compared to Ciqikou. If you want to go the lookout point that you see in social media (see photo 6 attached), its sort of behind a bookstore / cafe (look on the map or ask for directions as I didn‚Äôt note down the cafe name, sorry!) I think this place will be a lot busier at night‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt spend a lot of time here, maybe 2hrs, but only because I had lunch here as well.

**South Station Yangtze River cable car ride ‚Äì one way** with a guide. I read that there‚Äôs always a long queue, like you might have to wait 2hrs+ to get onto the cable car. Well, I was here on a Sunday afternoon and I waited less than 5min to catch a ride across the river to the Jeifangbei side. The cable car fits about 30 people and there were a few seats which is great for the elderly and parents with babies. I saw quite a few tourists, foreigners here, using this cable car to across the rive and explore the east area of Chongqing, where Xiahaoli and Nanbin Road are.

**Baixiangu / White Elephant residence** with a guide. If you drop by this place, you will get a closer look inside a residential building and area, a view of the cable cars and river from afar, walk pass many souvenir type stalls and climb up/down several flights of stairs. It was an interesting 30min visit and a nice break from walking out in the sun.

**Tongyuan City Wall Gate** with a guide. This is a free, historical site that's been preserved and integrated into the modern city ‚Äì there‚Äôs tunnels in the wall so cars can drive through it. On one side of the wall, are iron statues recreating ‚Äòan attack on the city‚Äô scene and information plaques (in Chinese and English), on the other side there‚Äôs some art sculptures; and you can climb up some stairs to get a view of the area or to relax in the tea-house and browse the bookstore. I think its was worth dropping by for 45min or so. Consider it an outdoor museum visit.

**Mountain City Alley / Shancheng Lane** with a guide. This is very similar to Ciqikou, Xiahaoli and Shibati ‚Äì old town areas with a mixture of Chinese-style architecture and new modern buildings, filled with many souvenir and handicraft stores, cafes, restaurants, some bars, etc. I think, if you don‚Äôt have much time in Chongqing, only visit one of them. The main difference with this one and the others, is that this ‚Äúalley‚Äù is located on a ‚Äúcliff‚Äù where you get a view of the river on the right-hand side, if you‚Äôre walking down. If you just want to see the area and not stop for meals or shopping, then 1hr is plenty.

**Shibati / 18 ladder steps** with a guide. I found this area to be less crowded than the others and I liked the history / war museum in the tunnel. I didn‚Äôt take any photos inside as its quite dark but still worth visiting to see and understand what Chongqing ‚Äì the people and the city, have been through. There are quite a few photo spots here and its more spacious compared to Mountain City Alley (lots of narrower walkways).

If you have any questions, please ask and I will respond as soon as I can. Thanks for reading!

1o74m87,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLifeUSA/comments/1o74m87/how_to_find_durable_products_using_reddit_real/,How to Find Durable Products Using Reddit (Real Tips That Actually Work),"If you‚Äôre tired of wasting money on stuff that breaks, Reddit can be one of the best tools for finding gear that *actually lasts.*  
But the trick is knowing **how to search and where to look.**

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs worked for a lot of us over the years 

# 1. Use Real-Life Keywords, Not Marketing Words

When you search, skip the salesy stuff like *‚Äúbest budget‚Äù* or *‚Äútop-rated.‚Äù*  
Instead, try phrases like:

* ‚ÄúStill works after 5 years‚Äù
* ‚ÄúOwned this since college‚Äù
* ‚ÄúLong-term review‚Äù
* ‚ÄúWould buy again‚Äù Those are the posts written by people who‚Äôve actually lived with the product - not just opened the box.

# 2. Browse Honest Communities

Each subreddit has its own vibe. Some care about specs, others care about reliability.  
A few worth checking:

* r/BuyItForLifeUSA (obviously ) ‚Äì Real experiences with things that last.
* r/BuyItForLife ‚Äì The original BIFL hub, full of archives.
* r/Tools, r/CampingGear, r/Frugal, r/Coffee, and r/MechanicalKeyboards ‚Äì Each has long-term user reviews buried in threads. Use the search bar inside those subs - that‚Äôs where the gold is.

# 3. Read the Comments, Not Just the Title

The best info is *always* in the comments.  
People will tell you how long something lasted, what broke, and how the company handled repairs or warranty claims.  
If a brand ghosted them after a few months - you‚Äôll see it.

# 4. Look for Posts With Photos of Wear and Tear

Anyone can post a new product.  
The valuable ones are people showing something *used* \- boots with years of wear, tools with scratches, cookware with seasoning.  
Those posts prove real-life durability.

# 5. Check for Repair Stories and Warranty Talk

Durable doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúnever breaks.‚Äù  
True BIFL products are the ones that **can be fixed or replaced easily.**  
If you see people talking about getting parts, repairs, or a lifetime warranty honored - that‚Äôs a green flag.

Reddit‚Äôs search isn‚Äôt perfect, but real experiences are worth digging for.  
The next time you‚Äôre about to buy something, spend 10 minutes reading what people say about it *after a few years of use.*  
That‚Äôs how you find what really holds up.

What‚Äôs one product you discovered through Reddit that turned out to be way more durable than expected?

*Where Mason Jones Meets a Wall of Woe and Brisbane‚Äôs Defense Lets the Air Out*

Ladies, gentlemen, and sentient basketballs with a taste for chaos, let‚Äôs dissect this NBL clash between the **Perth Wildcats** (3-1, three-game win streak) and **Brisbane Bullets** (1-4, four-game losing streak). The odds? Perth is a **79%-favorite** (decimal 1.26) to win, while Brisbane‚Äôs implied probability hovers at a laughable 27%. The spread? Perth -9.5 (-110) and Brisbane +9.5 (-110). Total? 182.5 points, with both Over and Under at near-even money. Let‚Äôs dig in.

### Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams

The **Wildcats** are a well-oiled machine, led by Jo Lual Acuil Jr.‚Äôs 30-point, 10-rebound explosion in their last win. They‚Äôre third in the league, with a defense that‚Äôs held opponents to the low 80s‚Äîimagine a bouncer who won‚Äôt let even a *breeze* through the door. Meanwhile, the **Bullets** are a cautionary tale: they lost their last game 116-89 to the Illawarra JackJumpers, a team so bad they make ‚Äúlosing‚Äù look like a part-time job. Brisbane‚Äôs offense? It‚Äôs like a tourist in Perth trying to order a coffee‚Äîconfused, slow, and destined to spill something.

Key stat: The **Wildcats‚Äô +9.5 spread** is a tight line, but their recent dominance (80-77 win with a 10-point cushion in the fourth) suggests they‚Äôll cover. The **Under 182.5 total** is a sneaky gem. Perth‚Äôs defense is a fortress, and Brisbane‚Äôs offense is a sieve. Last game, the Bullets scored 89 points but allowed 116‚Äîlike a leaky dam in a monsoon.

When I first heard about keto coffee, I thought it was just regular coffee with fancy ingredients. But after trying it myself, I realized it‚Äôs much more than that ‚Äî it‚Äôs a healthy, energizing drink that fits perfectly with the **keto lifestyle**.

# üîç What Exactly Is Keto Coffee?

Keto coffee (also known as **bulletproof coffee**) is a mix of:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Freshly brewed coffee

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Healthy fats** like MCT oil, coconut oil, or grass-fed butter

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Optional add-ins such as collagen or sugar-free sweeteners

These fats are quickly turned into **ketones**, which act as a clean energy source for your brain and body ‚Äî instead of using carbs.

# üí° Why Keto Coffee Works

The ketogenic diet focuses on using fat for energy. When you drink keto coffee, the fat content helps you stay in **ketosis**, boosts your **metabolism**, and gives you long-lasting **mental focus** without an energy crash.

According to a 2022 study in *Frontiers in Nutrition*, people following a high-fat, low-carb diet reported a **23% improvement in energy levels** after replacing their breakfast with MCT-based coffee.

|Energy Duration|4‚Äì6 hours|1‚Äì2 hours|

üß† **Result:** Keto coffee provides longer energy, mental focus, and fullness ‚Äî making it ideal for those following a **low-carb or intermittent fasting** plan.

¬†

# üß¥ Common Ingredients You‚Äôll Need

Here‚Äôs what I keep in my kitchen for the perfect keto brew:

||
||
|**Ingredient**|**Function**|**Benefit**|
|**Freshly brewed coffee**|Base drink|Provides caffeine & antioxidants|
|**MCT oil**|Healthy fat|Boosts ketone production for energy|
|**Grass-fed butter/ghee**|Creamy texture|Contains omega-3 & vitamins A, K|

|**Cinnamon or vanilla**|Flavor|Natural sweetness, no sugar|
|**Collagen powder**|Protein boost|Supports skin, nails & joints|

¬†

# Step-by-Step Guide ‚Äî Making Keto Coffee at Home

I make my keto coffee every morning, and it takes less than 5 minutes. Here‚Äôs how you can do it easily at home.

# ü™Ñ Step 1: Brew Your Coffee

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Use **1 cup (8‚Äì10 oz)** of hot, freshly brewed coffee.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Medium roast beans work best for flavor balance.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† You can use a **French press**, **drip machine**, or even **instant coffee** (just ensure it‚Äôs sugar-free).

üí° *Tip:* Freshly ground beans enhance flavor. You can find guides on the best grinders for beginners on **gomehedi.com**.

¬†

# üßà Step 2: Add the Healthy Fats

Add the following directly to your hot coffee:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **1 tablespoon of MCT oil** (start with 1 teaspoon if new)

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **1 tablespoon of unsalted grass-fed butter** or **ghee**

These fats are the key ‚Äî they help your body produce ketones for lasting energy.

¬†

# ‚ö° Step 3: Blend Until Creamy

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Use a **hand blender**, **milk frother**, or **regular blender**.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Blend for **30 seconds** until the drink looks **frothy and smooth**.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† This step mixes fats evenly, giving your coffee that creamy, latte-like texture.

¬†

# üç® Step 4: Add Optional Flavors

You can make your keto coffee taste even better without breaking ketosis:

**Flavor Boosters**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A pinch of **cinnamon or cocoa powder**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† A few drops of **vanilla extract**

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **1 scoop of collagen powder** for protein

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† **Stevia or erythritol** for sweetness

¬†

# üï∞ Step 5: Enjoy It Mindfully

Pour into your favorite mug, sit back, and enjoy the creamy taste.  
Keto coffee not only fuels your morning but also helps you start your day with focus and satisfaction.

¬†

# üìä Nutritional Breakdown (Per Cup)

||
||
|**Nutrient**|**Amount**|
|Calories|230‚Äì250|
|Fat|24 g|
|Protein|1 g|
|Carbs|0‚Äì1 g|
|Sugar|0 g|
|Caffeine|95 mg|

That‚Äôs a **power-packed cup** of energy and focus, perfect for anyone on a ketogenic or low-carb plan.

  


# Health Benefits of Keto Coffee

Keto coffee is more than just a morning drink ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **science-backed energy booster** that supports your brain, metabolism, and weight loss journey.

¬†

# üí™ 1. Increases Energy Without Sugar

Unlike regular coffee that relies on sugar or carbs for quick energy, keto coffee provides **long-lasting fuel** through fats.

üìä *Fact:* According to *Harvard Health*, MCTs convert to ketones within minutes and supply **20% more efficient energy** to the brain than glucose.

¬†

# üßò 2. Helps with Weight Loss

Drinking keto coffee can reduce hunger and control appetite.  
The healthy fats keep you full for hours, helping you **eat fewer calories** throughout the day.

‚úÖ *Clinical Evidence:*  
A 2021 study in *The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* found that consuming MCT oil daily can **reduce body fat by 3‚Äì5% over 12 weeks** when combined with a low-carb diet.

¬†

# üß† 3. Improves Brain Focus and Mental Clarity

Many people notice better focus and mood after drinking keto coffee.  
That‚Äôs because ketones fuel the brain more steadily than glucose.

üí¨ *Expert Insight:*  
Dr. Mary Newport, author of *The Ketogenic Cure*, explains:

‚ÄúKetones provide an immediate and stable energy source for brain cells, improving clarity, focus, and alertness.‚Äù

¬†

# üíß 4. Supports Intermittent Fasting

If you follow **intermittent fasting**, keto coffee helps you stay full without breaking your fast.  
It contains fats but no sugar or carbs, allowing your body to remain in a fat-burning state.

¬†

# ‚ù§Ô∏è 5. Improves Metabolism and Gut Health

MCT oil has natural antibacterial and antifungal properties that **support digestion** and **balance gut bacteria**.  
Plus, the fats help your metabolism stay active even at rest.

üìà *Fun Stat:* People who include MCTs in their diet burn about **100 extra calories per day** compared to those who use regular fats.

¬†

# üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 6. Reduces Sugar Cravings

Keto coffee stabilizes your blood sugar levels, preventing sugar spikes that cause cravings later in the day.  
I personally noticed my desire for pastries and snacks disappear once I switched to keto coffee every morning.

# Expert Tips, Mistakes to Avoid & My Personal Experience

After experimenting for months, here‚Äôs what I learned about making the **perfect cup of keto coffee at home**.

¬†

# üß† My Proven Tips

‚úÖ **Start slow:**  
Begin with 1 teaspoon of MCT oil. Increase gradually as your body adapts.

‚úÖ **Use quality ingredients:**  
Always choose **unsalted grass-fed butter** and **pure MCT oil** for the best results.

‚úÖ **Blend properly:**  
Mix well to get that smooth, creamy texture. Don‚Äôt just stir with a spoon.

‚úÖ **Add flavor naturally:**  
Use cinnamon, cocoa, or vanilla instead of artificial syrups.

‚úÖ **Drink in the morning:**  
It‚Äôs perfect as a breakfast replacement or a pre-workout drink.

‚úÖ **Stay hydrated:**  
Drink plenty of water since fats can dehydrate slightly during digestion.

¬†

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes to Avoid

üö´ Using **salted butter** ‚Äî ruins the flavor.  
üö´ Adding **too much oil** ‚Äî may upset your stomach.  
üö´ Using **low-quality coffee** ‚Äî affects both taste and energy.  
üö´ Adding **milk or sugar** ‚Äî breaks ketosis immediately.  
üö´ Skipping **blending** ‚Äî causes oil separation and greasy texture.

¬†

# üí¨ My Personal Story

When I switched to keto coffee, I noticed:

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† My **morning hunger vanished**.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† My **energy stayed steady** until lunch.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† My **mental clarity improved** ‚Äî no more caffeine crash.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I lost **4 pounds in the first month** without changing much else.

This experience made me a firm believer in the keto lifestyle.  
That‚Äôs why on [**gomehedi.com**](http://gomehedi.com), I often share new keto-friendly recipes and guides for beginners who want to start the same journey easily.

My experience has been the opposite. The biggest jumps in my pay and responsibility came after I built things people could see and use. Example, I shipped a small internal tool that saved my team a few hours a week. Two other teams adopted it, my boss had proof of value, and that led to a promotion. Zero happy hour involved. I think networking works best as a multiplier for clear output, not a substitute. Time is limited. If I spend two hours polishing a feature or a report, I get a durable asset. two hours at a meetup often ends with vague promises. I might be biased because I am introverted, so I am open to being wrong here.  
Change my view if you can show strong evidence that consistent networking beats consistent visible output for most people, not just sales roles. Longitudinal studies, meta analyses, or convincing personal cases are welcome. I will award a delta if persuaded.

1o74fax,https://i.redd.it/jex8qimk88vf1.jpeg,Samaria Gorge - my experience in Mid-Oct,"Hiked the gorge yesterday (Oct 13th). Everything I read here was accurate, especially when it comes to transportation. Here are some addendums to what people have already written about. 

1. In October only three buses leave from Chania: 5am, 7:45am and 9 or 10am. I got a ticket for 7:45am

2. Get to the bus station early. Our bus left at 7:40am instead of the slated 7:45am stop. Not sure because we were at capacity since there were still some free seats. 

3. If you are like over 30 and have even the slightest problem with knees get poles. Like they will save you. I forgot to rent them at Tactical Corner the day before. I was so nervous. But when we arrived at the gorge, there is a magical coffee shop. I walked in and there were 4 pairs of poles left for sale at $30eur. I grabbed a pair. They were all gone in 5 minutes. Sold out. So if you forget to bring or rent poles you can buy them at the coffee shop - but run there when the bus arrives. 

4. FOOD TIP: I did not bring lunch with me. I packed protein bars and had a 1.5 bottle of water( I only refilled once along trail).  I also brought a thermos with me. At the coffee shop I bought a coffee and a fresh spinach pie. Spinach pie I saved for lunch (it was incredible). The coffee I dumped into the  insulated bottle and drank throughout the hike. 

5. Make sure to bring flip flops or sandals so after the hike at the beach you can remove your boots and socks from your sore feet. At the end of the hike at the beach, rent a chair ($5Euro) since the black sand is not the most comfortable to be lying down on. 

6. The ferry from beach to Sfakion is amazing. The sunset yesterday was perfect and everyone was snapping photos every second they could. 

7. When you arrive at Sfakion, there are like ten buses. Most all go to Chania. I was one of the first one off of the boat and marched to where buses where and hopped on first one. We were first to leave. 

8. This hike is not easy. I think a lot of redditors posting that it‚Äôs not too bad are fit 20 somethings. :) I‚Äôm in my 50‚Äôs, an experienced hiker, and would rate this moderate/hard. ",7,1760512851.0,cretetravel,0,1.0,False

1o74eo8,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1o74eo8/aita_for_being_mad_at_my_boyfriend_for_making/,AITA for being mad at my boyfriend for making sexual comments and not helping me while I am recovering from surgery?,"Me (29F), been with my boyfriend (31M) for 4 years. I had breast augmentation surgery about 2.5 weeks ago. I work from home as a lash tech, so clients come to my house to see me, I‚Äôve been back to work the last week. Recovery has been rough, I can‚Äôt lift much, bend, do heavy cleaning, or move around comfortably yet

At first, he was helpful, but now he‚Äôs‚Ä¶ not. He constantly makes sexual comments when I‚Äôm wearing something tight or just walking around, like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs getting me hard,‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a boner now,‚Äù ‚Äúlet‚Äôs f**,‚Äù* or ‚Äúyou sure you don‚Äôt want to have sex?‚Äù I‚Äôve told him multiple times it makes me uncomfortable, especially while I‚Äôm healing, but he gets defensive and sarcastic, saying things like ‚Äúguess I‚Äôll never comment on your boobs again‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even do it that much.‚Äù

On top of that, he does almost nothing around the house unless I nag or eventually do it myself. He does basic stuff, like unloading the dishwasher, but that‚Äôs it. I usually vacuum, sweep, and tidy daily, but I can‚Äôt do heavy chores right now. I want to heal and live in a clean space, not one with crumbs on the floor.

The fish tank went three weeks without a proper water change, and I had to threaten to rehome our fish because it was neglectful and unhealthy. We‚Äôve been out of toilet paper for days, I did manage to find a few spares, but there‚Äôs less than a whole roll left now. My car is broken & in the shop, so I can‚Äôt get anything myself while he‚Äôs at work. I could order it, but I‚Äôve already asked him to pick it up, and I don‚Äôt want to pay a $10 delivery fee for toilet paper. Tonight he cooked dinner but didn‚Äôt make enough leftovers for me to have lunch tomorrow, even though I physically can‚Äôt go anywhere.

Last night he said something along the lines of ‚ÄúI wonder if you‚Äôll even want to have sex with me when you‚Äôre healed,‚Äù which made me feel worse. Honestly, his sexual comments make me not want to be intimate at all, and his lack of initiative around the house is exhausting and frustrating.

He says I‚Äôm overreacting and ungrateful, but I feel like I‚Äôve been clear about my boundaries, and he keeps ignoring them.

So‚Ä¶ AITA for being upset about the sexual comments and him not helping me while I recover?

EDIT I just want to clarify a bit, he is generally helpful around the house and very respectful most of the time. We have a traditional dynamic where I handle more of the cooking and household tasks and he‚Äôs the breadwinner, so I don‚Äôt usually have to worry about bills. I do make my own money and get to keep all of it, so I‚Äôm financially independent.

We‚Äôre usually pretty playful and flirt with each other. I would consider our relationship healthy, which is why this is hitting me so hard.

These comments, however, are very directly sexual and I‚Äôve asked him to stop.

He did cater to me hand and foot during the first week or so after surgery until I was feeling a bit more like myself; bringing me coffee, timing my meds, making sure I had everything I needed (food snacks, fluffing pillows, changing sheets, helping me move around, etc) but now he‚Äôs stopped stepping up with the heavier housework, and the constant sexual comments while I‚Äôm recovering are really getting to me. I‚Äôve expressed clearly that I don‚Äôt want to be commented on while I‚Äôm doing things like brushing my teeth or moving around the house, and he keeps doing it. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs frustrating and is NOT his overall character and isn‚Äôt really ‚Äúhim‚Äù if that makes sense.",1,1760512785.0,TwoHotTakes,16,0.6,False

I used to spend days obsessing over how to make a product go viral, new SEO tricks, ad angles, all that. Half the time it just flopped. Then one day, out of pure boredom, I changed the color palette on a few listings to softer pastels after Father‚Äôs Day. Boom. More clicks. I didn‚Äôt even promote it. People just started saving them.

Then I added a $5 coupon for repeat buyers because‚Ä¶ why not? I figured no one would care. Turns out people love feeling like they ‚Äúfound a deal,‚Äù even if it‚Äôs tiny. My repeat order rate quietly doubled that month. No ads. No fancy funnel. Just five bucks off.

Then came a win from something so simple, it almost feels like cheating: re-uploading my old products. I didn't change the designs at all, just gave them new titles with slightly different keywords. And wouldn't you know it, that little trick nudged them back into search visibility. It was like breathing life into my dormant listings without any real effort.

Oh, and I also started just bundling a few related products. Nothing groundbreaking, literally just two or three things that made sense to go together. But boom, my average order value increased. I guess folks just prefer 'done for them' rather than picking and choosing from too many 'options.'

All these tweaks were things I did half-distracted while drinking coffee, not part of any ‚Äúplan.‚Äù Meanwhile, the ideas I spent hours mapping out? Dead on arrival.

It‚Äôs funny how the small, almost dumb stuff is what actually moved the needle. The lesson, if there even is one, is that sometimes you don‚Äôt need to reinvent anything. You just need to pay attention to what‚Äôs already sitting right in front of you.

[By: Interesting-Egg654]

I just got my degree. The convocation gown, the photos, the certificate ‚Äì all of it should have felt like closure. But the thing is, you don‚Äôt really ""graduate"" from an IIM. You survive it. You process it in fragments. You carry parts of it with you, for better or worse.

And maybe that‚Äôs what this post is ‚Äì my way of processing the last two years at IIM BLACKI.


The Arrival

I didn‚Äôt come from an IIT or a top-tier college. I came in wide-eyed, from a basic Tier-3 engineering background, with nothing but hope and hustle. Some came from corporate jobs, some straight from SRCC and Stephen‚Äôs, some with 2 years of UPSC prep behind them. The diversity hits you fast, and so does the hierarchy.

You think it won‚Äôt matter. That your story is unique. But it does. Your undergrad, your work-ex, your PORs, your undergrad CGPA, even your grooming ‚Äì everything is currency. And your worth on campus is constantly recalculated based on it.


The Hustle Begins

Term 1? Chaos. CV reviews start before you've figured out where the mess is. You beg seniors to look at your CV ‚Äì some do, some don‚Äôt. Some choose people who ""look the part."" Others become your lifelines. You meet all kinds.

You walk around in the same formal shirt for three days straight, editing your resume down to a single line, obsessing over font size and bullet structure. You wonder how this is what you left your job (or city or home) for.

Then comes the Summer Placement Week. You think it‚Äôs a game of strategy. It's actually a game of chance disguised as one. You hear ""Day 0,"" ""Day minus 1,"" and you scramble to get shortlisted, only to realize that your fancy work ex doesn't matter half as much as someone else's undergrad tag.

Finance? Forget it unless you‚Äôre CFA+SRCC/St. Stephen‚Äôs+Excel wizard. You pivot to consulting. Everyone does. Not because they love it, but because it‚Äôs Day 0. And everyone wants to survive Day 0.

The Great Unlearning

By the end of Term 2, you‚Äôve forgotten who you were before BLACKI. You don‚Äôt romanticize the campus anymore. You don‚Äôt post about ‚Äúgrateful to be here‚Äù unless you just got a shortlist.

You realize that placement committees, CV points, and professor perceptions carry more weight than you ever imagined. And even if you‚Äôre good ‚Äì smart, driven, well-spoken ‚Äì it might not be enough. This place doesn‚Äôt just humble you. It rewires you.

People you thought were brilliant don‚Äôt get placed. People you didn‚Äôt expect to shine ‚Äì do. Some firms show up, some vanish. Some people get PPIed, others get ghosted. You watch it all unfold like a simulation with a dicey algorithm.

And that‚Äôs when anxiety kicks in.
Not the kind that you can write off with a few deep breaths. The kind that makes you wonder if your loan was worth it. If leaving your job was worth it. If you‚Äôre worth it.


The Mid-MBA Crisis

Third term? The intern wait begins. You like the company, you want the PPO. You don‚Äôt like the company, you still fear getting a PPO and being forced to accept it. You hate the job? Too bad, you might have to take it. You love the job? Good luck getting that offer.

And then comes the exchange dilemma. You need to choose to opt for it in this term. Another 7-8 lakhs. More debt. More guilt. You're from a middle-class family that has never spent ‚Çπ100 on themselves without thinking. Now you‚Äôre planning three months in Europe? With people you barely know, hoping the trip isn‚Äôt just an expensive photoshoot?




You‚Äôll feel like a product on an assembly line. Companies negotiate. Profiles shrink. Expectations lower. And yet, you play along.

You see friends cry in their rooms after getting rejected. You see brilliant folks not getting placed till the very last day. You cheer for them when they finally do ‚Äì or stay silent because you got placed earlier and don‚Äôt know how to be happy without guilt.

This is when your real friends emerge. The ones who didn‚Äôt just drink coffee with you in Term 1 but sat with you in silence during summers.


What They Don‚Äôt Tell You

Your GPA matters way more than you think.
The brand on your undergrad still follows you.
Some seniors will ignore you; some will become family.
No one‚Äôs journey here is the same. But the pressure? That‚Äôs equal-opportunity.
And you never really get used to it ‚Äì you just learn how to carry it better.


TL;DR

Prestige doesn‚Äôt guarantee respect. You fight for it every day.

Summers, PPOs, finals‚Äînothing is predictable, except that it‚Äôll be hard.

The best part of this journey? The resilience you build. And the people who help you build it.


If this resonates, I‚Äôll write Part 2. But for now ‚Äì this was the first year condensed into a few thousand words.

 27F overall healthy, no history of anything. Don't smoke, drink alcohol or take any prescription (or non) drugs.
Over the last couple weeks I started feeling some heart palpatations, which got increasingly more frequent. I know its not super reliable, however used my Samsung watch to do an ecg, I have been told by several medical professionals they 100% look like PVCs. I of course made a drs appointment and they did an official EKG there and were able to catch about 2, and confirmed they are PVCs. My Dr says she doesnt think like a big deal and is attributing it all to my caffeine consumption and wants me to cut out caffeine and wait 2 weeks to see if that is it. 

Now under other circumstances I could understand this. But here are my concerns with this:
1- they just appeared all of a sudden and have drastically increased in a week. Nothing I can think of changed to prompt it, it was just a sudden thing one day, only happened once or twice those first few days and now it feels a lot more often

2- when I say its drastically increased I dont mean, I mean there have been times I feel it going over and over and I check the watch ecg and ive caught up to 6 in one 30 second period. Its like they flare up for about 15 min or so and eventually will stop, then come back in an hour. Then later I might not notice any for an hour or 2

3- i do not think the amount of caffeine i intake is even a true issue, on average i have 2, maybe 3 coke zeros throughout a day (34mg each) so  just over a cup of coffee's worth in a 24 hour span at most.
 I occasionally have energy drinks, however haven't had one in several weeks, as for the soda it is not anything new for me, I have always been a soda drinker so its not new (I know, its still not great, but its my one guilty habbit)

She did order some blood tests which showed mostly normal, excluding a few values on the CBC, but she has not send anything regarding this.

Anyways I know that was a lot but just want to know if her claims its just caffeine is a legitimate accusation, or if you think there could be more going on. Thanks for any help/ thoughts on this!",1,1760511967.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1o744w6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleepworkshops/comments/1o744w6/mr_sunshine/,Mr. Sunshine,"My name is Nathan Malcolm. I used to work for the FBI. I did my share of drug busts and tracking organized crime, but I‚Äôve only hunted one serial killer. In the early 2000s, my team and I were assigned to hunt down the serial killer known as Mr. Sunshine. As is the case with many serial killers, he gained the nickname through his M.O. His victims‚Äîfifteen that we know of‚Äîwere always found in locations facing the East and at times when they would be discovered at sunrise, and based on the reports from the coroners, they were all killed at dawn, just minutes before the sun would come up. They were all found with their faces forced into smiles. It wasn't that he had mutilated them to create the smile; they had been found with their throats cut. Their smiles, though, had been determined to have been the result of the muscles in their faces somehow pulling their lips back into a forced grin that stretched literally from ear to ear, to the point that their lips had torn like rags. This would be odd enough, but unlike most serial killers, he had witnesses on multiple occasions, but when it came to describing his face, all they would ever say was that he smiled. Naturally, we considered the possibility that perhaps we were dealing with multiple killers, or that Mr. Sunshine was drugging the witnesses somehow. What was even stranger, though, was the fact that the victims had no apparent connection, nothing to connect an M.O. to. They were seemingly picked at random. Furthermore, their bodies all vanished at numerous points, even with an increase in security. 

My team‚ÄîAgents Langstrom, Prescott, Martinez, Kilpatrick, Rosencoff, and myself‚Äîhad received a tip that Mr. Sunshine had been sighted in an abandoned warehouse. By this point, he had claimed the lives of eight people, and we were getting desperate. So after getting the proper clearance, we entered the building, guns drawn, intending to arrest or put down this creep. The second we entered, we heard it: the echoed laughter. We didn't turn on our flashlights, as the lights inside were on despite the electricity being cut off two years prior, something Kilpatrick confirmed.

He took Langstrom first. 

We had only traveled a few paces in and were getting used to the light when it suddenly flashed off, like someone had flicked a light switch, then immediately turned it back on. It disoriented us at first, and even before I looked around, I sensed something in our footsteps, or more accurately, the absence of one pair. We turned and there was no sign of Langstrom anywhere. No blood, no noise‚Äîhe was just gone. Like We began getting worried, reporting back to HQ of our situation. We were told to proceed with caution. HQ then told us to begin investigating separate parts of the warehouse, two agents to search for our missing comrade as well as potential victims/survivors and the remaining three to continue our sweep for Mr. Sunshine. As Kilpatrick and Rosencoff broke off from the main group, we continued traversing the warehouse. Martinez noticed it after we‚Äôd traversed a quarter of the warehouse. She looked from the back to the front, then pointed it out to us pale-faced. 

We hadn‚Äôt moved further than twelve feet from warehouse‚Äôs entrance, where Langstrom had been taken. 

As we noticed it too, we heard Rosencoff begin to give his report, before stopping. ‚ÄúWha‚Äî‚Äù His radio cut out, and the light flashed again. We kept trying to call him, and at one point, Prescott, a close friend of Rosencoff, yelled out for him. Our radios broadcast the same deranged laughter we had heard before. Then the light flashed again, and we quickly did a headcount. Martinez, Prescott, and myself were still there. That meant‚Ä¶

We began calling frantically for Kilpatrick, to no avail. We radioed to HQ for orders. We received nothing but dead air. At least, so it seemed until a man‚Äôs voice giggled childishly.

Our professionalism left us then. We began screaming into the warehouse, demanding that Mr. Sunshine show himself. Whenever we heard laughter in any given direction, we would begin firing at it. Then the lights flashed twice. I kept my eyes shut, expecting to be taken like the others. But as I opened my eyes, I saw that I was still standing in the dusty, bright warehouse. Instead of relief, I felt my stomach drop, and any bravado I had left evaporated. I didn't need to turn around‚ÄîI felt the absence of Prescott and Martinez. 

It was resignation rather than courage or hope that drove me onward. I wasn't holding out hope that I might be able to save my teammates; I just moved forward, going through the motions. Somehow, I managed to push through the oppressive light, and that was when I saw him on a catwalk above me. Mr. Sunshine was dressed in an immaculately white two-piece suit with a red button-up shirt and a pair of red gloves, as well as impossibly shiny black shoes. On the lapel of his jacket was an ornate pin of something I couldn't identify. And his face was hidden in the light, except for his toothy, equally shiny grin. I made my way up the metal stairs, aiming my gun at him and telling him to get on the ground. Then he raised his hand, and the light dimmed just a little. But it was just enough. Enough for me to take in the horror of what he had done. I understand now what the witnesses meant when they said they couldn't place any distinct features‚Äîthey probably had their memories locked away from the horror.

Above him hung my team, along with the other fifteen. They were suspended in midair, held aloft by this unholy light in various positions. Except I realized that it wasn't just their bodies he was keeping; it was *them.* Their souls, their energy‚Äîhe was keeping *them*, feeding on them. Like how a spider saves its prey wrapped in silk, so too was he holding them wrapped in these infernal rays. And even now, they gazed down vacantly, forced smiles on their faces and tears running from their eyes. 

Not knowing what else to do, I aimed my handgun at Mr. Sunshine and unloaded each round into him, tears of grief, rage, and terror running down my own face. The bullets struck him, and blood began staining his suit. He staggered back, his smile turning into a pained grimace, and in an instant he was inches in front of me, his gloved hand around my throat, lifting me up. I heard vicious words in my head, saying that I didn‚Äôt belong up there yet. He told me that if I knew the truth about my team, I would understand why they were up there, and why the other victims were as well. He threw me off the catwalk, resulting in a broken leg. Just like that, the light vanished, and he along with his victims were gone. The radio came back to life, with HQ frantically demanding a status report. 

I was unable to provide a plausible explanation as to how my team had vanished without a trace, or why our radios had suddenly stopped working properly. It wasn't as if they had been turned off; they were receiving signals. But all HQ heard from my team was laughter. *Their* laughter. I was cleared of suspicion; there was simply no evidence pointing to me. 

I resigned after my leg had healed up. The trauma of losing my team coupled with what I had witnessed was too much for me. In the years following the incident, I often wondered what he was talking about, what the victims possessed that made them desirable to Mr. Sunshine, and what I lacked. I studied up and down, looking in obscure places for knowledge on the occult that might tell me who or what Mr. Sunshine was. Then I received an unmarked envelope this morning. Inside was a letter. 

*Dear (former) Agent Malcolm, 
I hope you‚Äôre doing well. I understand our last meeting was brief, and we had little time to spare. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve had questions aplenty about why I let you go. The simplest answer was that you were to me what a minnow is to a fisherman, or a fawn to a big-game hunter. Your team and my previous smilers all had something I wanted: pain. I suppose Kilpatrick never told you about the time his four-year-old brother was swept away by a river current when he was six despite his best efforts to save him, and how it had happened after they got into a childish argument that caused the brother to slip, or how Martinez accidentally shot her father thinking he was a burglar as he drunkenly stumbled back into her home when she was nine. And don‚Äôt get me started on how Prescott left his son unattended in a supermarket for a total of ten seconds, only for the boy to vanish. The others all had similar issues. You, though? You were remarkably ordinary. Disappointingly ordinary. Oh, you had the odd death in the family here, a failed relationship there, but nothing that truly haunted you. But then you met me. I‚Äôve consumed your thoughts like rabies to the nervous system, corrupting every thought you‚Äôve had. You barely smile, if ever, because it makes you think of me. You never leave your home because you know I‚Äôm out here. And I‚Äôll show my hand here: you surprised me. Before then, I had been confident that you would be too consumed with terror and awe to pull the trigger. Perhaps I had grown too arrogant. In any case, perhaps a little reunion is in order. The anniversary is coming up, after all. Why not meet us at the same place? You can decline if you wish, but it would be wonderful to see you again. And who knows? Maybe you can do what you tried to do the first time. Or maybe not. You never know until you try. 
Regards,
Mr. Sunshine.*

The handgun I‚Äôve kept in my home has been sitting on the coffee table in front of me for hours, along with several mags, the letter, files on Mr. Sunshine, and a picture of my team and I. 

I don't know what to do. I want to move on with my life, leave Mr. Sunshine in the dust, but at the same time, I want to finally close the book on this. If I could make him bleed once, I can do it again. I just don't know. Something happened a few minutes ago that may be tipping my indecision, however. The broken radio I kept unbeknownst to the Bureau crackled to life, and I heard laughter on the other end. Laughter from Martinez, Kilpatrick, Rosencoff, Prescott, Langstrom, and Mr. Sunshine.

Am back with the 7th episode. Also this episode will focus on the time gap between Season 2 Part 1 and Part 2. So it will revolve around what Tyler did when Wednesday was in coma during this phase.


Tyler opens his eyes and he finds himself in the sewer alone. He found some blood flowing from his body due to the gunshots but most of the bullets his Hyde body got rid of, only 2-3 pierced through his hand.

He found a tool and he got the bullet out of his hand as he recalled how his dad taught him to do so when he was helping people. He recalls how he pushed Wednesday and she fell out of the window.

Tyler: Why did I do this? I killed Wednesday!!!



Tyler starts crying a lot.¬† Just then he hears a familiar voice. It was his dad's soul.

Donovan: Told you to stay away from here! She is trouble. 

Tyler: Why are you here bothering me? Go and enjoy your afterlife, or is Hell being too much for you?!

Donovan: Son, you should come clean. It is not too late. 

Tyler: So they can chain me up and I stay there helpless till my last days?!

Donovan: But you are not doing great here either. 

Tyler: At least I am free.

Donovan: Tyler, there is still some humanity in you. I know you regret your actions. The best is to come clean.

Tyler: You know you never really cared about your family. All you cared about was reputation. Even after the way the world treated you like trash after finding out you are a Hyde's father, you still dare to say this!

Donovan: I deserved it for the way I treated you. Son, you can't be miserable like this! At least go to the hospital and get yourself treated.

Tyler: So that I can be caught. No, thank you very much!

Donovan: Son, I am giving you a hint. Go to the hospital somehow. You will get some hope. Maybe you can be on the right path finally.

Tyler: I am not listening to my dead father!

Donovan: Don't you want to visit Wednesday? It is not what you think!

Just then Donovan disappears and Tyler starts thinking. There was no confirmation that Wednesday actually died. Maybe he should go to the hospital and find out.

Tyler sneaks and goes to the hospital. He goes to the morgue to find if there was any body of Wednesday. As soon as a nurse came, he lay in one of the beds and acted as a corpse. 

Just then another nurse comes to her,

Nurse: The doctor is calling you to room 348. The patient had a rough fall at Willow Hill, thrown by a monster and her skull was cracked.



Tyler was hurt hearing that while pretending dead. He knew they were talking about Wednesday.

Other Nurse: Oh my god, did she make it?

Nurse: She did. But she is in a coma. Not sure how long she will take to wake up.

Tyler sighed a relief hearing that Wednesday was still alive. He now knew her room number too.

Other Nurse: Whatever happened in Willow Hill was crazy. There are 2 people including the psychiatrist Dr Fairburn whose brain got eaten by the zombie. 

Nurse: Oh god, the zombie must still be out.

Tyler felt bad for Fairburn as she did actually try to help him during his time in Willow Hill.

Other Nurse: Not just a zombie, a Hyde too and a psycho bald patient I think. I saw the leaflet.

Nurse: Hope they get caught.

Tyler woke up as the nurses left and he looked around. He found a nurse costume and he decided to wear it, acting as a nurse and wore the mask and went to the room where Wednesday was.

As soon as the doctors left, Tyler walked to Wednesday. She was lying there with her closed eyes, still having her braids done and her hands crossed around her chest.



Tyler: I am sorry Wednesday. You are in this condition because of me. I didn't want to push you but the fact that you left me knowing my truth and your bitter words was too much for my Hyde to take. 

Tyler gets teary-eyed.

Tyler: I really loved you Wednesday! I wish you did the same too. I won't lie I was in danger, I should have stayed away from you. You are in this condition because of me. Good news I am dying soon as I am masterless.

Just then he hears some weird noise. Tyler quickly hid behind the curtains. 

He saw a weird zombie come. It was looking to relish Wednesday. It must be the same zombie that killed and ate Fairburn's brain. He is not going to let the same happen to Wednesday.



Tyler in anger Hydes out and he attacks the zombie and pins it down. As he was about to finish it for once, they heard some noise.

One of the nurses who was talking about Wednesday came. She screamed seeing a zombie and a Hyde. The zombie immediately went to her to eat her brains, then the Hyde took the zombie and threw it away from the window.

Then Tyler transforms into his human form and he quickly hides behind the curtain and puts on his clothes. 

Nurse: You saved my life! Thank you! I owe you.

Tyler: (looking at Wednesday) Wish I could have saved her instead of her pushing her. Do me a favour don't tell anyone I was here.

The nurse nodded as Tyler left.

The next day,
Tyler came to visit Wednesday again and he saw Enid who came to visit Wednesday. 

Enid: Why do you do this Wednesday? See you have put your own life in danger! 

Enid cries for Wednesday.

Enid: You know, I feel so alone in your absence. Please wake up soon, Wednesday. I know there has been some distance between us lately but I can't see you like this. You are my best friend.

Tyler feels bad for Enid for once.

Enid: You shouldn't have gone to Willow Hill. I know you went to save your uncle, but you should have taken us there. Now Tyler, escaped because of you, if not I would have taken him down and you wouldn't have been in this condition.

He had the urge to take Enid down because of the prenomination drawing of Xavier and what she just said. Before he could, he saw Sheriff Santiago walking in. He quickly hid.

Sheriff Santiago questioned Enid about what actually happened in Willow Hill since she found her there. Enid told her she didn't really know why Wednesday went in there, and she just went to help her.¬† Enid left right after and Tyler was angry that he couldn't attack Enid, and Sheriff Santiago soon left too.

Enid: Wednesday... it is hard for me to see you like this. 

Enid starts crying.

Enid: I am sorry I won't be able to visit you. Hope we meet soon once you wake up.

Enid runs from there crying while her new boyfriend tries to console her.



New boyfriend: Enid it's okay? Wednesday will be okay.

Enid: Let's go from here Bruno.

Bruno nods and they leave.

Tyler came back and he went to Wednesday.

Tyler: Wednesday...what have you done to me? I should be escaping and hiding as I am a Hyde but instead I keep coming here and visiting you. My Hyde side doesn't like the sight of you, but my human side keeps coming close to you, and even my Hyde side can't do anything about changing my feelings.

Tyler started crying.

Tyler: You know Dad was right. I should have stayed away from you. You won't have been in this state. I really wish you had escaped from Nevermore that day in the Harvest festival. Wednesday, you love solving mysteries and danger, but I don't like seeing you fighting between life and death moreover it's my fault! I saved you from Rowan, even if I had to kill him because I liked you not because of Thronhill's orders.

Tyler: You know when I first saw you in Weathervane and you helped me fix the coffee machine I liked you. When you took down the bullies I was getting attracted to you. I helped you escape from Jericho, because you didn't deserve to be in this cursed town, when I told you I wished I had gone with you I really meant it. In a perfect world, we would have a small house in a remote place, be together away from cursed Jericho and maybe start a new life together. (smiles)

Tyler: Yes I thought too far, but you can't blame a Hyde they tend to both love and hate too much. I liked your accompany. I always did. Won't lie I didn't regret killing some people, as they deserved it, the ones I regretted killing were the innocent ones.
When I saw you in that dress at Rave'N party I knew I was slowly falling for you. When you supported me in the Xavier matter, I was sure you would accept me for who I am. Trust me, I did not want to attack Eugene, it was that bitch Thronhill's order.

Tyler: Thronhill tried to make me hate you in other ways like instigating me by using the mom card. That day on your birthday when you and Enid went to her residence, Thronhill gave me an order to attack one of you. I chose to attack Enid to protect you, but your caring side protected Enid. The best choice was to attack myself since she said one of your friends. I wished she always gave such vague orders so I wouldn't have to fulfil them the way she wanted. You nursed my wounds that day I saw your concern for me. You may go all dark, rusty no mercy with your words but your actions said otherwise.

Tyler: And then we went on a date in Crackstone's crypt. At that moment I was falling more for you. It made me smile seeing you really being horrified. I wanted us together, deep down I still do. But Thronhill had me there. She sent me a picture of stabbed Thing and I was worried about you. I went to Kinbott and told her everything seeing as a hope to get rid of Thronhill, but my stupid Hyde told her and I had to kill Kinbott even if I didn't want to.

Tyler: Then you came to meet me in Weathervane as I was doing the late shift. You came to me saying you reconsidered and you kissed me. I was so happy. I forgot everything and kissed you back. It was as if my dream was coming true but it all came crashing down cause of your visions. The kiss we had is the last good memory I have of yours, you regretted it but I never regretted it. Fate made us enemies but I always loved you, and I still do.

Tyler: Had you not inflicted pain on me with the shocks you gave me so I could utter the truth, I would have been on your side. I would have finished off Thronhill earlier before she could even touch you! But you didn't accept me for who I was. I get it.

Tyler: The words you said to me in Willow Hill deeply hurt me. But honestly, I deserved it. I am a schoolyard bully. I am a subpar barista. But you were wrong about one thing. Whatever I did on Thronhill's order, it wasn't the real me. I don't know about you but I fell in love with your darkness, bravery and courage. I wish you had fallen in love with me too, we would have pillaged the world together.

Tyler puts his hand caressing Wednesday's forehead and looking at her sadly.



Tyler: Wednesday, please wake up. Please open your eyes. Kill me if you need to. I am going to die anyway. 

Tyler cries.

Tyler: I love you. I really do. 

Voice: Oh my god...

Tyler looks behind and finds the red-haired girl Agnes appearing and Tyler freaks out.

Agnes: So you really did love Wednesday?



Tyler: Kid, get out of here if not I will Hyde out and throw you out of this window.

Agnes: Cut the crap Galphin, I know you won't do it because you are guilty of your sinister actions. You are sorry Wednesday is here because of you.

Tyler: Why are you here?

Agnes: You are not her only stalker. 

Tyler: I saw you at Willow Hill the other day. Where is your shapeshifter friend?

Agnes: We don't talk anymore. She changed roommates.

Tyler: You wish Wednesday does too
so you can replace Enid right? Forget about it.

Agnes: Well at least I am not the only one in I hate Enid club.

Just then the nurse that Tyler saved came back.

Nurse: Guys keep it low. You won't want to suspect.

Agnes: Wait, how did he convince you?

Nurse: He saved my life from the zombie.

Agnes: After all, there is some goodness in you. 



Nurse: You both need to go, the doctor is coming to check her soon anyway.

Agnes disappears surprising the nurse.

Nurse: Outcasts are really unpredictable.

Tyler: You have not seen much yet. They are much more than that.

Tyler also leaves silently.

Then Agnes reappears outside the hospital and Tyler comes to her.

Tyler: Listen, kid, if you tell anyone about this, this will not be good. It will be bad for both of us. You will be barred from visiting on Wednesday or even busted from Nevermore.

Agnes: Well I at least have my invisibility skills.

Tyler: Then I will use my Hyde skills to take you down. I can sense your presence, I was just too absorbed while talking with Wednesday and didn't notice you.

Agnes: That is what love does. I knew there was a
The reason I always preferred you for Wednesday over Xavier.

Tyler: Aren't you acting too smart for your age?

Agnes: I am smarter than you.

Tyler sees Wednesday's mom coming to visit her and he quickly leaves from there and Agnes disappears too.

As days pass by Tyler will come to visit Wednesday, but his own condition is getting worse. Agnes would also come to visit Wednesday and Tyler and Agnes would meet at times in the hospital.

One day,
Tyler wasn't feeling well but he came to visit Wednesday anyway. Before he could go in to visit Wednesday he saw the nurse he had saved the other day.

Tyler: How is Wednesday doing now?

Nurse: Not much difference in her condition.

Tyler: Do you know when she will wake up?

Nurse: It is hard to say. It could be a week, a month, a year or even?

Tyler: Even what?

Nurse: Never.

Tyler: Please don't say that.

Tyler starts coughing holding his chest.

Nurse: You okay?

Tyler: Must be due to staying wet for too long in the sewer.

Nurse: You don't look okay.

Tyler: It doesn't matter.

Nurse: I think you should stop coming often. You may get caught.

Tyler: I will handle it.

Nurse: If you have to attack people, I gotta report you.

Tyler: If you don't want me to attack you and throw you away like I did to the zombie, stay quiet and mind your own business.

The Nurse leaves scared.

Tyler goes to visit Wednesday and he finds Agnes wearing Wednesday's clothes and just helped her change.

Tyler: What the hell are you doing?!

Agnes: Umm helping Wednesday change her clothes.

Tyler: There are others there for that. And why are you wearing her clothes?!

Agnes: So that I can feel she is around me. 

Tyler walks to her.

Agnes: In Nevermore, I have always been alone. I never really had any friends... But when I saw Wednesday, I became a fan of her. She didn't care if she had friends or not. She was always absorbed in doing her own things. She even protected the school. She is my idol. 

Tyler: Wednesday isn't really a fan of the concept of someone idolizing her.

Agnes: I know that. This is why I became her sidekick, helping her with whatever she needs. I want to be just like Wednesday.

Tyler: Can I give you a suggestion? It is better to be yourself. Wednesday prefers originality. Though ironic in my case as she didn't like the original me.

Agnes: That is not necessarily true. Maybe the monster in you is what attracted her, maybe.

Tyler: Yeah right?

Tyler touches his chest in pain and becomes restless. He feels giddy.

Agnes: You okay?

And then he falls unconscious.

Tyler opens his eyes and he finds himself in a dark room with the nurse and Agnes around.

Tyler: Where am I?

Nurse: Don't worry, no one will find you here.
People come here rarely.

Agnes: You had fallen unconscious so I had to tell the nurse since only she knew about you.

Tyler: I should leave now.

Nurse: Tyler you should take a rest. Your condition is getting worse. It's also due to the gunshot injury. Some of them are not fully healed.
If you continue like this, you won't make it like this.

Tyler: I was going to die anyway. 

Tyler gets up to leave.

Agnes: Tyler please stay here, just for tonight. 

Tyler: I don't deserve this.

Tyler leaves from there and walks weakly.¬† Agnes and the nurse look at each other concerned for him. 

Tyler is in the sewer and he shivers and stays in there hiding the whole night. He recalls his moments with Wednesday, when they met in Weathervane the first time, then here dance in Raven dance, how she nursed his wounds when he attacked himself, and then their first kiss. Then how she inflicted pain on him and whatever she said in Willow Hill and him throwing her off the window.

Tyler: I am sorry Wednesday. (tears dropping from his eyes)

Donovan: If you are guilty, why don't you confess everything, son?! This way you have some hope to live.

Tyler: How does it matter? I don't have anyone in this world who cares for me. You and Mom left the world. And the only girl who would have cared for me I betrayed and almost killed her.

Donovan: You can still get some redemption for yourself.

Tyler: It's not worth it. 

Donovan: It is!

Tyler: It is not!!

He roared and transformed into Hyde angrily. 

Tyler back to his human form often visited Wednesday.

He finds Agnes reading a book to Wednesday. 

Tyler: So we meet again kid!

Agnes: Tyler?! How are you doing??

Tyler: Pretty much the same. Miserable. And Wednesday not waking up doesn't help.

Agnes: If it makes you better, the doctor was telling that there is a good chance that Wednesday will wake up soon. They found some movement by her. Her wounds are slowly healing. 

Tyler: Then I hope she wakes up before I die.

Agnes: Maybe you will survive who knows.

Tyler: Hydes can't survive without a master for long. And I don't want one. Not especially when my previous master was the reason why I almost killed Wednesday twice. Though the second time was completely my own fault.

Agnes: You know I really wanted you to be caught initially. But the way you feel about Wednesday and confessed, I can tell you still love her. Plus Wednesday would enjoy a psychotic monster boyfriend.

Tyler: Not if the monster boyfriend almost kills her and her friends. Wednesday acts tough and that human lives don't matter to her but it does! My dad was right, her family isn't that bad and she is the most normal one in her family. 

Agnes: Wednesday is lucky to have such a good family. Her mom and dad often visit her and read to her. And my family...(becomes sad)

Tyler: What about them?

Agnes: My mom and dad were never happy together. They were together only because of me. Then my mom left and now she is with her normie husband and son. While, I am with dad, dad doesn't really give much time to me.

Tyler: If it helps I had the same issue as my dad. My mom died when I was little, not sure how. And my normie dad...he found out some time after they were married, probably after I was born, she is a Hyde. He didn't spend much time with me either fearing I was one too, and it turned out to be true.

Agnes: Looks like we have more in common than I thought. We are both obsessed with Wednesday, we visit her often. We both hate Enid. Our dad doesn't give us enough time. We are both lonely.

Tyler: Hey Agnes, if it helps you can consider me as your elder brother. I wanted to have a younger sister that I could share things with.



Agnes: (smiling) Appreciate it Tyler.

Tyler: You just said we have more things in common. But I hope you never turn out to be a monster who kills his own loved ones.

Tyler leaves from there.

One day,
As Tyler is on his way to the hospital, he finds Agnes.

Agnes: Tyler there is great news! Wednesday just woke up!

Tyler smiled hearing this.



Tyler: Seriously?! Is she okay?

Agnes: She is the same. 

Tyler sighed a huge relief and he was really happy. He could see her alive and awake before dying. 

Agnes: But you should meet her later. Her parents are here.

Tyler nods.

Agnes: She is getting discharged tomorrow. You can meet her then.

Tyler: Agnes can you do me a favour?

Agnes: What is it?

Tyler: Wednesday should never know that I was here all these days and visited her in the hospital often.

Agnes: But...

Tyler: Agnes!

Agnes: Okay fine.

Tyler leaves and Agnes disappears as she walks to the hospital. Tyler goes to prepare to meet Wednesday the next day.

End of Episode.

As Agnes visited regularly, I feel maybe she might have seen and met Tyler. And probably she might realize Tyler still had feelings for Wednesday. Plus I love Agnes character and I think they will be a good sibling kinda duo.


In the next episode, it will revolve around Season 2 Epi 5 and half of Epi 6 like what happens when Wednesday recovers and Tyler‚Äôs POV when he went to meet Wednesday and gang claiming to kill her and Enid.

I used to see those reels where people crib about their flatmates crying over 100 bucks.
 I guess it‚Äôs my turn now.
But first, some context.
My esteemed flatmate behaves as if she‚Äôs the rich wife of some Bollywood king. So let me give you a glimpse into the¬†real¬†life of ""rich Bollywood wives.""
When I first moved into this house, every second sentence out of her mouth was
I work in MBB. I work in MBB.
The perks. The status.¬†""Uff! You guys won‚Äôt get it.""
But something felt off.
Every morning, she would wake up, light candles, sip coffee in her Starbucks mug, yell at Alexa, and just chill. She'd go for yoga in the middle of office hours etc.
So one day, after her usual¬†, Iwork in MBB, I asked her what her role was.
She works in an admin role. But¬†at¬†MBB... 

This rich Bollywood wife has very expensive taste ‚Äî designer clothes, high-end skincare. She‚Äôs also very mindful of her ‚Äúcircle‚Äù ‚Äî only hangs out with ‚Äúprestigious people,‚Äù startup founders, folks who‚Äôve been on Shark Tank.
But she is also a very¬†practical¬†woma, who finds it hard to pay 100 bucks for her share of cleaning utensils or pay for her share of groceries.
She often has a problem with paying for small shared expenses, yet somehow manages to post ‚Çπ4-5k expenses on Splitwise ‚Äî and gets¬†very¬†offended if anyone dares ask for a receipt or proof.
Where she comes from, asking for bills is¬†apparently¬†deeply insulting, I guess.
She finds it more appropriate to¬†threaten¬†flatmates with eviction if they question her expenses ( a flat where she is also a tenant.)
The rich Bollywood wife also enjoys picking fights with the maid, and seems to view her flatmates as maids too.
(I wish I had time to share more iconic stories about this rich diva, but sadly, I have to get back to work.)
(In hindsight, the day I saw her lighting candles and listening to self-affirming nonsense and how I thought of Jan from¬†The Office¬†‚Äî I¬†should¬†have known I was in for a ride.)

I have written as much as I can at the time being. Several stores have written preview sales but Nob Hill and El Super have not.

Normally not a big deal but I have to take a family member to CHOMP tomorrow for an appointment mid-morning which means it may be noon before I get back and have an opportunity to finish.

I will take this brief moment to share something lovely. As many of you know I started a Buy Me a Cup of Coffee channel thing as a sort of tip jar. 

> Hello all. [I am extremely thankful for anyone donating to my efforts at buymeacoffee.com because everything helps.](https://buymeacoffee.com/weeklygrocerydeallist) Again, this list will *always* remain free to all. Any sort of tip helps me out and means I can potentially start organizing recipes based on things on sale during the weekly basis. Happy couponing!

Recently I received a message that read as follows:

> I moved here 2 years ago, and was completely lost. I had spent the past 30 years in Texas. The cost of gas and groceries literally doubled when I stepped off that plane. To provide one example, the last time I visited family in the DFW, gas was $2-something a gallon there, and $4-something here. I didn't have local friends or family to show me around. So I did what I always do when I move cities... Found the local city/county subreddit. I noticed some Good Samaritan posting this weekly ""Grocery Deal List."" I found these posts really helpful, from a monetary standpoint, and also from an emotional one. They made me feel like I wasn't a stranger in a strange city. I wasn't familiar with the roads in Marina/Salinas/Monterey, much less where all the grocery stores were located. This saved me from having to drive from store to store in an unfamiliar town - I could read the posts and draw my own conclusions, then head to the store and check things out ""IRL.""

> Two years later, I feel a lot less lost. I've figured out that Grocery Outlet stocks reasonably-priced fruits/veg and snacks, and I like a few other grocery stores (Lucky, Del Monte Asian). I still remain grateful for the creator of this list.

This is the best sort of message I can get and thank you for giving me that sort of good news; it makes me want to do this more going forward. Anyway. I am missing 2 stores as of 11:40 PM and I have to take family to doctor's appointments all morning Wednesday so I'll update when I can.

I‚Äôm a gentle-hearted introvert with a curious mind and a deep appreciation for meaningful connections. Life has been a mix of lessons and laughter, and I‚Äôve learned that friendships built on honesty, empathy, and patience are some of the most beautiful parts of growing up.

I do have occasional blood pressure fluctuations nothing dramatic, just something that‚Äôs made me more mindful about balance and calm energy. I value people who understand that life doesn‚Äôt always have to be a race; sometimes it‚Äôs about quiet companionship and good conversations.

What Friendship Means to Me
To me, friendship is about showing up not just when things are fun, but when they‚Äôre real. It‚Äôs about listening, laughing, and occasionally sitting in silence without awkwardness. I love people who can be authentic, a little goofy, and kind without trying too hard.

A Bit About Me: 
Empathetic but practical. Calm most days, moody on a few. I enjoy long walks, reading about psychology or art, discovering new music, and journaling when thoughts get too loud. I love humor that‚Äôs subtle, not loud and people who speak kindly, even when they disagree.

What I‚Äôm Looking For: 
Just genuine humans someone who values meaningful conversation over small talk, and depth over drama. Gender doesn‚Äôt matter much; energy does. It would be lovely to have a few consistent people to talk to about life, ideas, books, health, or even just the absurdity of existence.

If you decide to message, please share a proper introduction ‚Äî who you are, what you‚Äôre into, and what kind of connection you‚Äôre hoping to make. No one-liners, please :)

It should come as no surprise that the Wild Hunt Art Academy is one of the strictest schools here in Kivotos. Thanks to the help of the Dorm Supervisory Unit, the law is enforced for every student here at the school to ensure a good environment for studying and creating, while also keeping a close eye on those troublemakers who may be present in the school.

However, there will come a day when they have to deal with‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúPeculiar‚Äù visitors and ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù students. I present to you the misadventures of the Dorm Supervisory Unit.

.

**Story 1: Daytime ‚Äì Checkpoint Inspector**

You probably know how I always open my summary by now, so I should skip it‚Ä¶ NAH, LET THE UNDERTALE REFERENCES GO BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.

It‚Äôs a beautiful day outside, birds are singing, flowers are blooming, kids are playing, and ideas keep flowing through every Wild Hunt student‚Äôs mind. On days like this, we should have a nice cup of freshly-made espresso and watch the beautiful scenery here in one of the academy‚Äôs coffee shop, where the bustling street keep going on and on‚Ä¶

Such days like this are rare, but when those days come, you have to enjoy it to the fullest, because once you break out of your fantasy, you will find reality itself is often‚Ä¶ Disappointing.

The supervisor wakes up in her dream, and before her eyes is the checkpoint located at one of the main gates here at Wild Hunt, and outside, a lot of people are eagerly waiting to go in and out of the academy. Sighing a breath, she sits back on her chair. And with that, her day as the Checkpoint Inspector has begun.

.

The first student went in, and after she checked that she didn‚Äôt have the item she reported to be going out with, the inspector began to conduct a body check on her. Of course, she disagrees. Where can they even hide the item in their uniform? Well, a job is a job, my friend, so she has to comply. However, the inspector began to touch the body more. The student flinched, asking the inspector why she was touching more than it supposed to? Quite simple, actually, more rules! Some have been spotted bringing more items that weren‚Äôt allowed, so they have to check more.

Good gosh, it definitely tickled, and after thoroughly checking her full body, the inspector let her go. The student left the inspection booth with anger and complained about it after she left the booth. Hearing so, the inspector just‚Ä¶ Sighing again. Yup, already 8 AM in the morning and we‚Äôve this. Oh well, one down‚Ä¶ Dozens more to go‚Ä¶

. .

The next person comes in. In her bag, there are some ‚Äúquestionable‚Äù items. First, a Momo Friends Peroro Doll, the reason being in one of the shows, the mascot decided to act out of character, which, however, resulted in‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúPolitical‚Äù protest? wAt? A-Anyways, for that reason, the academy decided not to let the plushie in.

Next is‚Ä¶ Well, just watch.

**Wild Hunt's Student B:** That's for your own benefit!

**Dormitory Supervisor:** Any items that were likely to be used in a crime would be confiscated by the inspector.

**Wild Hunt's Student B:** What's so wrong about pineapple on pizza...?

The final item in her bag is an autobiography of Gehenna Pandemonium Society‚Äôs President. A rather ‚Äúfancy book‚Äù that was sold for a very cheap price, so she brought it to read for herself. Unfortunately, this isn‚Äôt a register book (:Gyahahahahahahaha:) so it was confiscated. Again, she complains that she has put effort into even carrying this book back here, because this book is heavy af. Well, the Inspector has expressed a very good policy when that happened: File a complaint at the office. Of course, just like the first one, she also expresses her disagreement, but rules are rules and she angrily walks out of the checkpoint booth.

. . .

Next is the tailor, he is currently delivering 50 sets of Red Flower brushes with 6 pieces each, 50 sets of Kruger SB sizes 4 through 8, 100 sheets of size 3 canvas, 100 sheets of size 4 canvas, and then one can of paint stripper, and‚Ä¶ She noticed something was sticking out of the canvas, so she asked the tailor to take it out. Turns out, it was a Napalm bomb made by the genius at Millennium. Now, it‚Äôs technically a contraband item because no guns or grenades are allowed from the outside. However, that one belongs to the tailor to defend himself, so she decided to let him go.

Next is‚Ä¶ A student has been hit by inspiration after seeing an old statue she saw at Trinity, so she brought it back here. But wait, did she just ‚Äústeal‚Äù it? I mean, who does this belong to? The inspector tried to confiscate this, but the student claimed it was just a statue and then accused the inspector of stealing her idea. The inspector tried hard to calm her down, but suddenly that student slipped through the guards. Seeing an opportunity to power through, everyone decides to push the guards too and declare REVOLUTION!

https://preview.redd.it/zz7why9xz7vf1.jpg?width=1366&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6d2a400fd85ad96033883e922089735c71299b56

Chaos ensues, everyone fighting each other, and the inspector looks to the sky, seeing a pigeon pass by. Oh, how ironic it is. Well, another day, another chaos at Wild Hunt Art Academy‚Ä¶

But please, if you think it was over, then hoo boy, I've got news for you. It‚Äôs nighttime, and you know what happened at nighttime?

\- - - - - -

**Story 2: Nighttime ‚Äì Unwanted Duty**

Tired after a long day of mediating the crowd and fighting everyone, she can finally have a nice rest thanks to the Head Supervisor's timely arrival, as everything was resolved.

Looking at the unfinished homework and the blank canvas on the table‚Ä¶ Nah, that‚Äôs the least of her concerns; she could do it tomorrow. What‚Äôs more important is to get some good night sle- HOLY HELL, SOMEONE JUST PLAYED MUSIC AT THE CAMPUS AT 10 PM. And of effing course, she got the order to regroup and was forcefully out of her comfy bed.

Line up to hear the order from the Chief Supervisor, it seems that 7 minutes ago, the Free Outing Club was spotted climbing over the school fence and even taunting the Dorm Supervisory Unit that are they sleeping yet. This is already the 4th time these girls have escaped, so capturing them is the top priority‚Ä¶ Wait, what about the music on campus? Surely the complaint would be massive by now? Well, as long as they were concerned, the arrest order was not given to them, and any objection about it would be shut down because, again, ‚Äúthe Head Supervisor isn‚Äôt issuing any arrest order ‚ÄòYET‚Äô.‚Äù So, they will be focusing on arresting the Free Outing Club first, and then they will maybe deal with the music later.

Some time later, in the middle of the night, everyone has been walking for a very long time now, yet they can‚Äôt find the members of the Free Outing Club. Among them are the inspector girl from earlier, and just as they are going to step further, the leader of the group stops them. She‚Äôs just received an order from the Head that‚Ä¶ They need to arrest the students playing music‚Ä¶ See? Sooner or later, they have to shut down the music, and that should be the top priority of the thing they need to do.

Well, they have walked for a long distance now, and surely, SURELY the leader wouldn‚Äôt think- The leader ordered everyone to run back to the academy.

Well damn. Oh well, hang in there, Dorm Supervisory Unit! You will be missed!

1o73lar,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1o73lar/mr_sunshine/,Mr. Sunshine,"
My name is Nathan Malcolm. I used to work for the FBI. I did my share of drug busts and tracking organized crime, but I‚Äôve only hunted one serial killer. In the early 2000s, my team and I were assigned to hunt down the serial killer known as Mr. Sunshine. As is the case with many serial killers, he gained the nickname through his M.O. His victims‚Äîfifteen that we know of‚Äîwere always found in locations facing the East and at times when they would be discovered at sunrise, and based on the reports from the coroners, they were all killed at dawn, just minutes before the sun would come up. They were all found with their faces forced into smiles. It wasn't that he had mutilated them to create the smile; they had been found with their throats cut. Their smiles, though, had been determined to have been the result of the muscles in their faces somehow pulling their lips back into a forced grin that stretched literally from ear to ear, to the point that their lips had torn like rags. This would be odd enough, but unlike most serial killers, he had witnesses on multiple occasions, but when it came to describing his face, all they would ever say was that he smiled. Naturally, we considered the possibility that perhaps we were dealing with multiple killers, or that Mr. Sunshine was drugging the witnesses somehow. What was even stranger, though, was the fact that the victims had no apparent connection, nothing to connect an M.O. to. They were seemingly picked at random. Furthermore, their bodies all vanished at numerous points, even with an increase in security. 

My team‚ÄîAgents Langstrom, Prescott, Martinez, Kilpatrick, Rosencoff, and myself‚Äîhad received a tip that Mr. Sunshine had been sighted in an abandoned warehouse. By this point, he had claimed the lives of eight people, and we were getting desperate. So after getting the proper clearance, we entered the building, guns drawn, intending to arrest or put down this creep. The second we entered, we heard it: the echoed laughter. We didn't turn on our flashlights, as the lights inside were on despite the electricity being cut off two years prior, something Kilpatrick confirmed.

He took Langstrom first. 

We had only traveled a few paces in and were getting used to the light when it suddenly flashed off, like someone had flicked a light switch, then immediately turned it back on. It disoriented us at first, and even before I looked around, I sensed something in our footsteps, or more accurately, the absence of one pair. We turned and there was no sign of Langstrom anywhere. No blood, no noise‚Äîhe was just gone. Like We began getting worried, reporting back to HQ of our situation. We were told to proceed with caution. HQ then told us to begin investigating separate parts of the warehouse, two agents to search for our missing comrade as well as potential victims/survivors and the remaining three to continue our sweep for Mr. Sunshine. As Kilpatrick and Rosencoff broke off from the main group, we continued traversing the warehouse. Martinez noticed it after we‚Äôd traversed a quarter of the warehouse. She looked from the back to the front, then pointed it out to us pale-faced. 

We hadn‚Äôt moved further than twelve feet from warehouse‚Äôs entrance, where Langstrom had been taken. 

As we noticed it too, we heard Rosencoff begin to give his report, before stopping. ‚ÄúWha‚Äî‚Äù His radio cut out, and the light flashed again. We kept trying to call him, and at one point, Prescott, a close friend of Rosencoff, yelled out for him. Our radios broadcast the same deranged laughter we had heard before. Then the light flashed again, and we quickly did a headcount. Martinez, Prescott, and myself were still there. That meant‚Ä¶

We began calling frantically for Kilpatrick, to no avail. We radioed to HQ for orders. We received nothing but dead air. At least, so it seemed until a man‚Äôs voice giggled childishly.

Our professionalism left us then. We began screaming into the warehouse, demanding that Mr. Sunshine show himself. Whenever we heard laughter in any given direction, we would begin firing at it. Then the lights flashed twice. I kept my eyes shut, expecting to be taken like the others. But as I opened my eyes, I saw that I was still standing in the dusty, bright warehouse. Instead of relief, I felt my stomach drop, and any bravado I had left evaporated. I didn't need to turn around‚ÄîI felt the absence of Prescott and Martinez. 

It was resignation rather than courage or hope that drove me onward. I wasn't holding out hope that I might be able to save my teammates; I just moved forward, going through the motions. Somehow, I managed to push through the oppressive light, and that was when I saw him on a catwalk above me. Mr. Sunshine was dressed in an immaculately white two-piece suit with a red button-up shirt and a pair of red gloves, as well as impossibly shiny black shoes. On the lapel of his jacket was an ornate pin of something I couldn't identify. And his face was hidden in the light, except for his toothy, equally shiny grin. I made my way up the metal stairs, aiming my gun at him and telling him to get on the ground. Then he raised his hand, and the light dimmed just a little. But it was just enough. Enough for me to take in the horror of what he had done. I understand now what the witnesses meant when they said they couldn't place any distinct features‚Äîthey probably had their memories locked away from the horror.

Above him hung my team, along with the other fifteen. They were suspended in midair, held aloft by this unholy light in various positions. Except I realized that it wasn't just their bodies he was keeping; it was *them.* Their souls, their energy‚Äîhe was keeping *them*, feeding on them. Like how a spider saves its prey wrapped in silk, so too was he holding them wrapped in these infernal rays. And even now, they gazed down vacantly, forced smiles on their faces and tears running from their eyes. 

Not knowing what else to do, I aimed my handgun at Mr. Sunshine and unloaded each round into him, tears of grief, rage, and terror running down my own face. The bullets struck him, and blood began staining his suit. He staggered back, his smile turning into a pained grimace, and in an instant he was inches in front of me, his gloved hand around my throat, lifting me up. I heard vicious words in my head, saying that I didn‚Äôt belong up there yet. He told me that if I knew the truth about my team, I would understand why they were up there, and why the other victims were as well. He threw me off the catwalk, resulting in a broken leg. Just like that, the light vanished, and he along with his victims were gone. The radio came back to life, with HQ frantically demanding a status report. 

I was unable to provide a plausible explanation as to how my team had vanished without a trace, or why our radios had suddenly stopped working properly. It wasn't as if they had been turned off; they were receiving signals. But all HQ heard from my team was laughter. *Their* laughter. I was cleared of suspicion; there was simply no evidence pointing to me. 

I resigned after my leg had healed up. The trauma of losing my team coupled with what I had witnessed was too much for me. In the years following the incident, I often wondered what he was talking about, what the victims possessed that made them desirable to Mr. Sunshine, and what I lacked. I studied up and down, looking in obscure places for knowledge on the occult that might tell me who or what Mr. Sunshine was. Then I received an unmarked envelope this morning. Inside was a letter. 

*Dear (former) Agent Malcolm, 
I hope you‚Äôre doing well. I understand our last meeting was brief, and we had little time to spare. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve had questions aplenty about why I let you go. The simplest answer was that you were to me what a minnow is to a fisherman, or a fawn to a big-game hunter. Your team and my previous smilers all had something I wanted: pain. I suppose Kilpatrick never told you about the time his four-year-old brother was swept away by a river current when he was six despite his best efforts to save him, and how it had happened after they got into a childish argument that caused the brother to slip, or how Martinez accidentally shot her father thinking he was a burglar as he drunkenly stumbled back into her home when she was nine. And don‚Äôt get me started on how Prescott left his son unattended in a supermarket for a total of ten seconds, only for the boy to vanish. The others all had similar issues. You, though? You were remarkably ordinary. Disappointingly ordinary. Oh, you had the odd death in the family here, a failed relationship there, but nothing that truly haunted you. But then you met me. I‚Äôve consumed your thoughts like rabies to the nervous system, corrupting every thought you‚Äôve had. You barely smile, if ever, because it makes you think of me. You never leave your home because you know I‚Äôm out here. And I‚Äôll show my hand here: you surprised me. Before then, I had been confident that you would be too consumed with terror and awe to pull the trigger. Perhaps I had grown too arrogant. In any case, perhaps a little reunion is in order. The anniversary is coming up, after all. Why not meet us at the same place? You can decline if you wish, but it would be wonderful to see you again. And who knows? Maybe you can do what you tried to do the first time. Or maybe not. You never know until you try. 
Regards,
Mr. Sunshine.*

The handgun I‚Äôve kept in my home has been sitting on the coffee table in front of me for hours, along with several mags, the letter, files on Mr. Sunshine, and a picture of my team and I. 

I don't know what to do. I want to move on with my life, leave Mr. Sunshine in the dust, but at the same time, I want to finally close the book on this. If I could make him bleed once, I can do it again. I just don't know. Something happened a few minutes ago that may be tipping my indecision, however. The broken radio I kept unbeknownst to the Bureau crackled to life, and I heard laughter on the other end. Laughter from Martinez, Kilpatrick, Rosencoff, Prescott, Langstrom, and Mr. Sunshine.

We had to postpone the wedding a few times due to very unfortunate events in our family but we finally set a date for October next year. Baby will also be born Feb 2026 so it was supposed to be a dubble happy year. 

But since becoming pregnant he's been increasingly distant and mean and unnecessary. I've always done the majority of the house work because I work from home and cleaning is my way to decompress after a busy day. So I never minded it. He did help with dishes but he's stopped doing that all together. He'll complain when I ask him to spray a certain chemical that my nose can't handle right now and to just wipe the surface.(I have severe nausea). He'll complain when I ask him to move something heavy. But then he wants to freak out when I stand on a ladder to get something after I've asked him for a week straight. Our long life milk is stored at a top shelf and I'm usually to short to get it down so I have to use a ladder or stretch and the stretches often hurts my belly for some reason.  I made him black coffee once because he didn't get the milk off and he blew up on me saying pregnancy shouldn't be an excuse but the minute I took out the ladder to get the milk down and then he went off on me again for getting on the ladder and putting our child in danger. 

It's small things like that. Whenever I ask for help he'll complain, say pregnancy is not an excuse and then he either won't do it or he'll finish 5 PC game rounds and then he'll help me. I don't expect him to help me immediately but the times where I do ask him for help is when his PC is still off. 

He's also been playing PC more and more. Ignoring our time together or saying he's just not in the mood for me. But when he wants to do something with me I have to drop everything immediately to do it otherwise he'll screech like a banshee saying I always complain we don't do stuff anymore (I don't) and now that he wants to do something I'm ignoring him.

Yesterday he took of his shirt after a long day of work. So he smells because it's summer here right now, wiped is sweaty armpits and threw it in my face. He laughed so hard I was sure he was going to pee himself. But when I didn't laugh, told him that was disrespectful and asked him wtf he did what he did he said it was a joke and I should stop being so oversensitive. 

Before this he was such a great partner. I was so excited to learn I was pregnant because I thought he'll be the best dad ever. But now he's acting like the biggest piece of trash.

I really want this baby. But I'm also terrified of leaving him at this point. Not only because his behavior is getting drastically concerning but because he makes more than me and I don't know how I'll be able to support the baby as a single mother. ",69,1760509301.0,TrueOffMyChest,28,0.93,False

# Negotiations

On 2/21/2024, Paris and I talked for a second time, again outside of my house. I actually didn't want to talk right outside of my home, my lawyer also suggested it‚Äôs best to talk at a public location, like a coffee shop. But Paris refused to go anywhere else, saying she didn't know what my intentions were.

Paris asked me how I wanted to divide the assets. I knew there‚Äôs no way for me to get out of this mess unscathed. So I started by listing all the horrible things she did to me, and then gave the same proposal that I gave on 4/5/2023, which was to split the assets acquired when she lived with me, and I get to keep all the assets acquired when she was not living with me. Paris lived with me from April 2018 to August 2019, about a year and half. I also pointed out that she was often away from home even during those 1.5 years, claiming to ‚Äúmeet her advisor"" or ""vacationing"", but I am sure she really went to be with Sharik. I will not dwell over that, at least she was living with me most of the time during those 1.5 years.

Paris rejected my proposal, she proposed splitting assets acquired from April 2018 to March 2021, which is 3 years, plus I pay one year of spousal support. I asked what's the reason for adding the extra 1.5 years, given that she lived with Sharik during that time. Paris first denied living with Sharik from August 2019 to January 2020. She said she lived alone near University D, and Sharik only visited her every week and brought her groceries. I immediately told her I don‚Äôt believe it, as Sharik's background report clearly showed he lived near University D during that time. Paris then said she was pregnant with my child during that time and that she didn't want our daughter to be born out of wedlock. I felt there‚Äôs some merit in that statement, so I backed down and said I can extend it to March 2020, which was when Paris sent the child to California. However, she then went to live with Sharik in Colorado after that, which she admitted the previous week. Our daughter was only a little more than a month old at the time, a time when the child needed the mother the most. Instead of caring for our daughter, she went to Colorado just so she could be with her paramour. What kind of mother is this? How could she still have the nerve to ask for my money after doing something this horrific?

Paris said she needed to finish her degree. She already spent way too long on her PhD, her advisor was not happy with her progress, and if she didn't buckle down, she wouldn't be able to graduate. I then asked, if that was the case, why didn't she just stay in the apartment next to University? Paris was not a student of University D, and I don‚Äôt know why she was living there, but at least University D is not too far away from her school, about 50 miles. Longmont is more than 1,600 miles away from her school, what‚Äôs the rationale for going there? Paris said her school closed when the pandemic started, she had nowhere to go, and she needed somewhere quiet to work on her dissertation, so she went to live in Sharik‚Äôs house. I responded by saying, who on earth would believe something this ridiculous?

Paris then said that giving birth to our daughter caused severe damage to her body, and it took her a whole year to recuperate. She wanted that extra year mainly to compensate for the suffering she went through. I asked, if she was not well, why didn't she recuperate at home? Had she stayed at home, even if she just laid in bed the whole year and did nothing else, I can still accept it. Why did she have to recuperate in her paramour‚Äôs house? Also if she was not well, why didn't she go see a doctor? Why did she still fly so much? Paris then insisted she was at Longmont so she could concentrate on her dissertation. The negotiation is now at a stalemate. I insisted on counting two years, but Paris insisted on three years.

From February 15th to March 19th, Paris and I negotiated every week, for a total of six times. The first couple sessions were somewhat civil, but the latter ones became more and more heated, with both of us launching verbal attacks against one another. I won't go into details of what I said, it‚Äôs not hard to imagine it. Paris was still saying that I didn‚Äôt treat her well during the marriage. Some of her accusations were:

1. Paris said I was not supportive of her getting her PhD. I asked: ‚ÄúIf I wasn‚Äôt supportive, then how were you able to spend eight years on your degree?‚Äù
2. Paris said I was constantly pressuring her to graduate and find a job. I asked: ‚ÄúExactly how did I pressure you?‚Äù I only asked a few times given that she was taking so long, and that‚Äôs pressuring?
3. Paris said I didn't take care of her when she was sick. I asked: ""How could I have taken care of you when you didn't even live with me?""
4. Paris said my parents treated her poorly and called her fat. This is complete nonsense. She was the one that always said she‚Äôs fat, and my mother only told her once to not be so obsessed with her weight, and that‚Äôs calling her fat?
5. Paris said I didn‚Äôt give her money. I said: ‚ÄúI gave you a ton of money, there are records in the bank statements.‚Äù Paris then said I only gave her money when she asked me for it, if I cared for her then I should have given her money without her asking. I said: ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt you often say that you are an independent woman and didn‚Äôt want me to support you? Every time you asked for money, you said you were just borrowing, and would pay me back once you find a job. Why won‚Äôt you pay me back now?‚Äù
6. Paris said I didn‚Äôt buy her gifts. I said: ‚ÄúI brought you a lot of gifts, such as iPhones, clothes, etc.‚Äù Paris then said those were all cheap stuff.
7. Paris said that one time when we were dining at a restaurant, I kept looking at some woman that sat next to us. I told her I didn‚Äôt know what she was talking about. Even if I did look at some woman, that‚Äôs nothing compared to her cohabiting with her paramour.
8. Paris said I wouldn't let her take care of our daughter. I asked: ‚ÄúExactly when did I not let you take care of our child? You were the one that‚Äôs always busy and didn‚Äôt have time to see her.‚Äù

During the negotiations, Paris repeatedly told me that it will be very difficult for me to win the annulment trial. Continuing this fight is pointless and would only incur more legal fees. Furthermore, if I continue this trial, her lawyer would immediately petition that I pay more of her legal fees. Therefore, accepting her proposal is my best option. She‚Äôs right, my lawyer also told me winning annulment is very difficult. This lawsuit has already cost me more than $200,000 in legal fees. It pains and angers me when I receive the bill from my lawyer each month. Of course, I still told her that I'd rather give the money to my lawyer than giving it to a con artist. I also said that the judge clearly didn‚Äôt like her based on what happened during the 1/11/2024 hearing, so how could she say that I can‚Äôt win? Paris responded by saying the judge didn‚Äôt like her lawyer, not her. She also knew that her current lawyer is terrible, that‚Äôs why she already hired a much better lawyer.

I tried to insinuate by pointing out some of Paris‚Äôs strange behaviors. I asked her why both she and Sharik spent eight years on their PhDs, why both left their schools after just four years, and why both don‚Äôt work? Why are both of them so secretive, why did they travel all over the United States and move frequently? I said I didn‚Äôt believe the two of them really came to the United States for their PhDs. I also asked why the internet at my home disconnected everyday when she was there, but never had any issues after she left? Why did she always suspect that I was monitoring her? Why did she constantly tell me not to go through her stuff, and why did she move all her stuff out the same night she brought up divorce? And so on, ‚Ä¶ Paris didn't respond to any of the questions I asked, except for saying Sharik has a job when I asked why both of them don‚Äôt work. The following week, Paris brought this up and said she didn‚Äôt understand what I meant when I asked all those questions the prior week. She went home and thought about this for a long time and finally realized that I think she is a spy. She can now tell me affirmatively that she‚Äôs not a spy, and that I should not hope that this can somehow give me some advantage in the negotiation. I was a bit surprised by her response. Did she really have nothing to hide, or is this some kind of mind trick? Then I thought, what I stated couldn't be more obvious, does someone as intelligent as her really needed to think for a long time to figure out what I was getting at?

On March 19th, during the final negotiation, Paris finally relented a bit. She said she was willing to set aside six months' worth of money and put it in a trust for our daughter. I was already very tired and felt that we are unlikely to yield much more by continuing this negotiation. I obviously also didn‚Äôt trust her, and didn‚Äôt know if she‚Äôs playing some kind of tricks again. I asked Paris to have her lawyer send us a formal proposal in writing.

# New Lawyer

On March 25th, we received the first letter from Paris's new lawyer, informing us that Paris had officially changed lawyers on March 22nd, from The Zhou Law Group to Candelaria LLP. From this point forward, I am referring to Candelaria LLP whenever I mention Paris‚Äôs lawyer.

On April 1st, Paris's lawyer sent us their settlement offer. The offer for the most part matched what Paris said in our negotiations, but there were a few changes. The two biggest changes were: (1) Paris originally said we will divide assets from April 2018 to March 2021, or 3 years. In the offer, it was 3 years and 1 month, and the date range was shifted back by a couple months. The stock price of my employer increased substantially during the pandemic, so my 2021 income was a lot higher than my 2018 income. This change in dates will allow Paris to get quite a bit more money. (2) The offer didn't say anything about setting up a trust for our daughter.

At the end of the letter, Paris's lawyer stated that nullity is difficult to obtain and the evidence we have is not strong enough to demonstrate fraud, so we are unlikely to win. She advised us to accept their offer, which would be good for both parties. This is actually what my lawyer has been saying as well. She repeatedly told me that annulment lawsuits are very difficult to win and told me not to get my hopes up. But what other options do I have?

When we first considered annulment in 2023, my lawyer provided three cases similar to my situation and successfully obtained annulment:

1. [Schaub v. Schaub](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2d/71/467.html). In this case, the wife continued to have a sexual relationship with another man after marriage. I felt this case was the most similar to mine. The difference is that Schaub's marriage lasted only two years, and the wife was caught in the act in her paramour‚Äôs home. When she was caught, she even admitted that she married for money.
2. [Handley v. Handley](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2d/179/742.html). In this case, the wife would not live with the husband after they were married. Similar to my case, Paris also hardly lived with me during the marriage. What‚Äôs different is that the Handleys didn‚Äôt live together at all, but Paris did live with me for about a year and half. Also, there isn‚Äôt a paramour in the Handley case.
3. [Marriage of Liu](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/3d/197/143.html). This is a case where the wife married for green card. Similar to my case, Paris also got a green card from the marriage. What‚Äôs different is that Liu‚Äôs marriage only lasted a few months, and the wife refused to have sex with the husband.

My lawyer also felt that Schaub's case was most similar to ours, so the key is Sharik. However, we need to prove intent not to terminate the sexual relationship. The keyword is **intent**, meaning it has to be **premeditated** before the marriage. Otherwise, we can only say Paris committed adultery, and adultery is not illegal. But proving premeditation is virtually impossible! We need either Paris or Sharik to admit this themselves, which was what happened in the Schaub‚Äôs case. We know that‚Äôs not going to happen. Alternatively, we need to find some writing between them where they discussed their plans or intentions. This is why in our discovery request, we asked Paris to provide all emails, texts, and any communication between her and Sharik from 2012 to 2016.

Another major difference between my case and the three cases above is that Paris and I have a child together. Even though Paris clearly does not care for the child and has never taken care of her.

After receiving the offer from the opposing lawyer, I asked Paris why the offer didn‚Äôt match what she said during our negotiations. Paris initially said there were some miscommunications between her and her lawyer, but those were minor issues and she will ask her lawyer to fix it. That never happened. A few weeks later, Paris said her lawyer refused to make the changes and there‚Äôs nothing she could do.

My lawyer suggested that we continue to apply pressure while negotiating. On April 11, my lawyer informed Paris's lawyer that we plan to depose Paris, Sharik, and Ms. Huang in early May. At the same time, my lawyer again asked Paris's lawyer to provide Sharik's address.

On April 15, my lawyer called Sharik using the number on the Chick-fil-A cup, and to our surprise Sharik actually answered. Sharik agreed to the deposition and gave us his email. In hindsight, I feel that calling Sharik was a mistake. The reason we asked for Sharik‚Äôs address was so we could serve him with the deposition subpoena. It‚Äôs obvious that for whatever reason Paris cannot give us Sharik‚Äôs address. Now that we got a hold of Sharik, we lost our justification for needing Sharik‚Äôs address, hence we can no longer pressure Paris via asking for Sharik‚Äôs address. I think Sharik likely realized this as well, and that‚Äôs why he answered my lawyer‚Äôs call.¬†

Also on April 15th, my lawyer sent a letter to Paris‚Äôs lawyer, again pointing out many of the issues in their latest discovery response, and asked them to respond again.

On April 22nd, Paris's lawyer responded to our discovery for the fourth time. The main differences between the third and fourth attempts were:

1. Paris finally provided Sharik's address, it is house B. But didn't the person living there say Sharik is no longer living there when we attempted to serve him in November 2023?
2. Paris provided the full addresses that she lived in in Richmond and Longmont, it is Sharik‚Äôs address. However, she still didn‚Äôt provide her Fremont address and Shanghai address.
3. Paris said she and Sharik broke up in 2010 and didn't get back together prior to our marriage in 2014. To show that they really broke up, she even provided some emails between them from 2010.
4. Paris again stated that she only had sex with Sharik between March 2021 and October 2021, and not any other time. This is obviously a lie. Where did the child in her 2022 pregnancy come from?
5. Paris still would not provide emails, texts, or any other information related to Sharik from 2012 to 2016. Paris still kept the emails between her and Sharik from 2010, but she doesn‚Äôt have anything from 2012 to 2016. Who‚Äôs going to believe that?

On April 29th, my lawyer called Ms. Huang. Ms. Huang said she seldom talked to Paris. She knew that Paris and I were married, but nothing else pertaining to our marriage. As for Sharik, she hasn't talked to him in years, and she didn‚Äôt know anything regarding his relationship with Paris. Given that Ms. Huang knew little about Paris and Sharik, my lawyer decided to cancel the deposition. It's worth noting that during the marriage, Paris claimed she frequently visited Ms. Huang. In 2021 and 2022, she also used hanging out with her high school friends as an excuse to not visit our daughter in Sacramento. So those were also lies.

On May 7th, Sharik emailed my lawyer saying he was really busy and asked to postpone the deposition, and he requested a translator for the deposition. So Sharik can‚Äôt speak English even though he has lived in the United States for 9 years and has a doctorate degree from an American university? I can feel that Paris and Sharik don't want to have this deposition, they're coming up with excuses to delay the process. I'm all but certain Sharik has some serious issues that he is trying to cover up. If true, then his testimony could be used against him at a later time, because everything he says will be recorded and archived by the court. But my lawyer also advises against actually conducting the deposition. We need to prove premeditation, which is something we know they won‚Äôt admit. Essentially we need them to make mistakes, and that‚Äôs not realistic given how good of a liar they are. My lawyer was worried that if we don‚Äôt get any useful information out of the deposition, and most likely we won‚Äôt, then the opposing party might pull their settlement offer.

During this time, our lawyers continued to negotiate the settlement. My lawyer said the opposing lawyer was extremely tough and uncompromising, refusing to budge or move the three-year window back to what Paris originally proposed. The annulment trial was scheduled for early June, so if we want to settle, we have to do it before the trial. My lawyer suggested moving the trial back a couple months to give us more time to negotiate, which they also rejected, saying we either get this done now or go to trial. In the end, my lawyer suggested that I accept their offer. She reiterated that our chances of winning the case were slim, and if we lose, then there‚Äôs no way they will still settle. In that scenario, I would have to give Paris half of my assets and 4.5 years of spousal support.

On May 15th, we had a four-way conference via Zoom for the final negotiation. The way it works is that both sides had a virtual meeting room, and the lawyers had a room for negotiation. What happened was that the lawyers would negotiate in their room, then come back to the meeting room to go over the terms with the clients to see if we agree or not. We went back and forth for a few rounds, and it took almost two hours. In the end, we got the terms of the settlement completed.

The result was pretty much the same as their offer, except we were able to get Paris to agree that a portion of the money will be set aside in a 529 account for our daughter, but I had to match whatever she put in. Another difference was that Paris wanted to keep the final settlement simple. Essentially, she just wanted numbers, but doesn‚Äôt want the agreement to state how we arrived at those numbers. For my RSU and 401k, it will be divided based on the 3 year and 1 month window that they proposed, but we need a CPA to compute the actual amount. Most of the negotiation was focused on cash, house, and alimony. For the house, I need to buy out her half. Alimony is one year, and we bought it out with a lump-sum payment, obviously it‚Äôs a smaller amount compared to paying over 12 months. Adding up everything, we agreed to a final figure of XXX thousand dollars.

On May 20th, both parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), effectively putting down the result of the negotiation in writing. At the same time, we also dropped the annulment case, bringing this back to a regular divorce case.

I was actually sick on the day of the four-way conference ‚Äì I had a fever and headache, but I still had to participate. During the negotiation, I felt that there‚Äôs something not right with that final number we produced, but I was under distress and having a headache, so I couldn't quite figure out what was wrong on the spot. A few days later, I found out what was wrong. First, a large portion of the down payment and remodeling of the house were money that I made before the 3 year window, but the house was split 50-50. Second, the majority of my existing cash came from selling stocks, with most of those stocks also purchased using money I made before 2018, and the cash was also split close to 50-50. I asked my lawyer if we can fix this, but she said we already signed the MOU, so we can‚Äôt backtrack anymore. In addition, the MOU only contained the final amount that I need to pay Paris, it didn‚Äôt state how we arrived at that number, so we can‚Äôt argue that there was a mistake. Also, we all saw how hard-lined the opposing party was, so there‚Äôs no way that they would agree to lower the number. She also said that the current agreement is already very good compared to giving Paris half of my assets. She advised me to look at the big picture and not get hung up on the details.

In early June, the CPA calculated how much of my RSU I needed to give to Paris. The number was almost twice what I estimated. Why is there such a large difference? It turns out that it‚Äôs because of the ‚ÄúNelson Formula‚Äù that has to be used for RSU calculations in California. Using a simple example to illustrate, let's say A had a four-year RSU grant, then A and B divorced after the grant was vested for two years. I thought that the vested shares in the first two years would be split 50-50 between A and B, but A would get to keep all the shares vested in years three and four. So in the end, the grant would be split 75-25 between A and B. However, using the Nelson Formula, it is true that the shares vested in the first two years are split 50-50, but B also gets a portion of the shares vested in the next two years, starting at close to 50% at the beginning of year three, down to 25% at the end of year four. So in the end, A would get 58% of the shares and B gets 42% of the shares. Just who came up with such a complicated and illogical formula? Other than my initial RSU grant, I received about 10 other smaller grants during the three-year window via refreshers, promotions, and bonuses, each with a different vesting schedule, and all of them must be divided using the Nelson Formula. This means some of my unvested shares today still belong to Paris, even though it is now 2024, almost 3 years past the three-year window. This is completely absurd! Not to mention expensive, the CPA fee for computing this was almost $30,000.

I repeatedly asked my lawyer and the CPA why we have to use this nonsensical formula. My lawyer would not comment on this, other than saying this is what the law required. The CPA was a little more sympathetic, he said he too feels this formula is unfair, even for normal marriages, and for me it‚Äôs just adding insult to injury. But there‚Äôs nothing he could do, because he had to compute according to what the law says. He even mentioned that there was a recent ruling (I don‚Äôt know which case) that reiterated that the Nelson Formula must be used for RSU calculation.",3,1760509147.0,stories,1,1.0,False
