1maw8ud,https://i.redd.it/rs04hx145hff1.jpeg,First Off Menu supper club was a success!,"Hey genies! ✨

We had our very first Off Menu supper club last Friday at Shack-Fuyu in Soho — and it was a great night 🥳

12 lovely humans joined from London, Hampshire, Winchester — and one even found us via ChatGPT! 🤖😂 The vibe was perfect: friendly faces, great chat, and plenty of Off Menu refs.

🍱 Food highlights:

🐟 Sea bass ceviche — zingy & fresh (everyone loved it)
🍗 Korean fried chicken wings — sweet, spicy, crispy joy
🍆 Miso aubergine — nice, but a bit mild for me I would say..

Drinks? Yuzu margaritas stole the show but some people said the sake float (additional £7) was the best they've ever had.

The matcha toast was lovely as everyone said it would be.

Everyone agreed it was great value for a relaxed night out.

⚠️ Heads up: The tasting menu isn’t ideal for vegans or vegetarians. If that’s you, check with Shack-Fuyu about swaps or options!

🍷 The vibe: cosy, low-lit, perfect for autumn/winter but honestly good anytime.

Thankfully no one had to be kicked out of the restaurant 😏

Pls see instagram for a reel of our night 🤩

🔜 What’s next?

I’m planning the next supper club soon! To help cover organising costs, there’s a £3 fee or you can support me via Buy Me a Coffee 👉 coff.ee/offmenu_supperclublondon

They don’t talk to me at coffee at all. Hell, they haven’t even asked me where I’m from or what other ships I’ve been on (the common union small talk). They haven’t given me any involved marine engineering work on overtime, just sorting shit in the machine shop/tool room. 

Is this the common state of rotary shipping? Have I been blinded by being a permanent with an awesome crew for so long?

I have never posted on Reddit before so I apologize if I break any rules! Buckle up, this is gonna be a long one. 

Ok so, my (23F) best friend and neighbor Eliza (24F) ghosted out tight knit friend group, there is 4 of us in total - me, Ivory, Kendall, and Eliza (all fake names and we are all around the same age), after a decade of knowing each other out of the blue a year ago. 

Eliza had been hanging out with some other not so good friends (imo) and I know her home life was rough too, but we always made sure that she knew we were there to support her. We (mostly me) gave her ""tough love"" advice when she was going down a bit of a rough path, but I don't think it was TOO tough. 

There was an inciting incident on Eliza's 21st birthday that kind of tore a rift in our relationship and her relationships with the rest of the group (too personal to discuss, but it showed a deep lack of empathy on her part and we were very sad about it for a while and argued for a long time) and it never really repaired no matter how hard we tried.

She has been going to therapy for years and working through things which I thought was helping her, but I honestly have no clue. After the incident, whenever we invited her out with us or just to hang, she would kind of disassociate and not really listen or participate in the conversations, and I was getting super worried about her. 

Well about a year ago, after we hadn't heard much from her for a while despite reaching out and inviting her to things, she messaged Kendall and basically said she can't be friends with me or Ivory for her mental health. She didn't elaborate much and didn't even say anything to us, only messaging Kendall. 

I was heartbroken and I couldn't believe that she would just ghost us like that. But we all respected her choice and stopped talking to her. The three of us have stayed friends and kind of just gone on with our lives and tried to heal. For me, it was honestly like I was grieving as if she had died. I was so upset. We had gotten so close over the years, and she was my next door neighbor which made it even harder. 

A couple months passed and I saw that she had blocked me on everything except tiktok. I think she reactivated it and her profile came up and I was shocked. My thinking was that if she wanted to block me, then she could, but it felt like she had kept this line open for a reason. So I started to send her a few tiktoks, trying to gently let her know that I was still here and I was open to talking if she ever wanted to. She opened them, but never responded, which was fine. 

Well, just about a few months ago, Eliza ended up seeing Kendall at an event and they spoke for like two hours just catching up. Kendall told her that I was still open to talk and I was absolutely ready to be friends again, but Eliza was scared to reach out since she assumed we were all still mad at her. Kendall assured her that she could reach out to me at any time, and when Kendall relayed this whole situation to me I was so excited. I wanted to reach out to her, but I didn't want to scare her off. 

Eventually, at the beginning of May (so almost 3 months ago now), Eliza sent me a long text explaining her talk with Kendall and how she was in a really rough situation and she pulled away and she would take full accountability for that. She said she missed me and wasn't expecting anything but she wanted to try and talk. I was ESTATIC! I sent her a long message back about how happy I was to hear from her, how I loved and missed her too, and how I forgive her for everything and I was absolutely open to talking. I suggested we get together and talk, or that we could even start with a phone call if that would be easier. I told her how excited I was to hear from her and how I had so much to tell her. 

Unfortunately, I never heard back from her after that. I sent a short follow up message at the end of May asking to meet up for coffee, still no response. I kept spending tiktoks and she liked a few, sent me two, and responded to one with some emojis, but that was it. I sent her another message a little over a week ago because I was visiting my mom so I back next door to her (I had moved away a few months ago) and asked if she wanted to talk. That same night, I saw her and some friends at a festival and I went to talk to her (I had a few drinks already at this point so it gave me courage). I tapped her on the shoulder and we hugged. I told her I love her and miss her and I hope to get together and talk soon, then I gave her a kiss on her head. I can't remember if she said anything, but I didn't want to bombard her while she was with her friends at a festival so I just left her alone after that. 

Its been so long since she reached out and I haven't heard a response from her, despite all my efforts to show her that I'm not mad and I miss her and I want to be friends again. 

So, what do I do now? Do I keep reaching out and  keep sending her tiktoks only for her just to leave me on read? Do I drop it and just not talk to her for another year? Do I keep going and risk scaring her off by doing too much? Please give me all the advice that you can, I would really appreciate it! ",1,1753646762.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Anyway, I spent around $200 (a relatively smaller total for my family); but my cart was somewhat full. When I get up to the receipt checker, he was an older man. He commented on how the price of coffee cream is the best at Costco; I agreed. Then he decided to get cheeky. He says there are only two coffee creams on the receipt and three in my cart. He is smiling while doing this and makes me wait about 15 seconds while he peruses my receipt. Then says that “they separate them”, meaning the creams are listed at different spots on the receipt. I’m not sure if this is something he does regularly with customers or if he genuinely thought I was trying to steal one measly litre of coffee cream…but I was annoyed. 

After a long work week and then wanting to get the **** out of Costco on a late Friday afternoon to get home to my toddler, I didn’t find it amusing. I’m not interested in stupid banter or being treated like a shoplifter. As far as I’m concerned, the receipt checkers need to go; it’s this weird way of intimidating their members or making them feel like thieves. I probably spend $700 per month at Costco.

Like people suggested I gauged his interest throughout the evening - invited him to sit next to me on the couch during karaoke, we sang some songs together (as someone who loves karaoke and to sing this is huge to me), he'd say something funny and I'd purposefully lean into him when I laughed, let my leg rest against his. He gave me a plush he had won from one of the claw machines. It was just such a fun time with everyone overall as well. 

By the end of the night we were all exhausted, ubered back to my apartment, cut cake, and ordered some pizza. Once things were winding down and we were getting ready for bed, I mustered up the courage to tell him he could stay in my room with me if he wanted - that it would be cooler since I have an AC unit, comfier in my bed, and that it would be nice to have him there. He agreed and my heart started poundinggg 

Without going into too many more details, as we laid side by side in my bed together I admitted to him that I still really liked him, and I wanted to be more than friends. He told me the same, that people ask him about me all the time and asked me if I wanted to do long-distance dating, and I agreed :) we're going to go out on our first date when I come back to town in two weeks. We went as far as making out, I still can't stop smiling and blushing thinking about it. 

We cuddled the whole night but neither of us got any sleep. I thought he was sleeping but apparently both of us were kept up by our racing thoughts and hearts 😅 he unfortunately had to leave really early this morning since he had to get back in time for another shift at the 4H fair. I made us coffee and we lazily cuddled up on the couch before I kissed him goodbye. 

So thank you thank you thank you thank you!!! for all the encouragement, I couldn't be happier right now :) I'll probably delete all this in the next few days - he doesn't really have an online presence but if he were to somehow see these posts I would be mortified lmao

I use all the stock equipment. During that time, I have generally been able to make a decent espresso. Not perfect. Not like Italy. But generally drinkable.

After that, the espresso had a terrible metallic taste that I’ve never experienced before. I kept trying different things, but it stayed the same. I descaled it and cleaned some of the extra coffee that was built up to see if that helped. The metallic taste is gone, but the espresso is just bad. There is one particular observation that I want to share. The water is just gushing through the portafilter. Yes, I know, use a finer grind or use more coffee and/or tamp harder. Trust me when I say that I’m using the same as I always have. I can’t add more coffee. I can’t go any finer on my grinder. (It‘s an Urbani 080, and I have it on the finest possible setting, as I always have.) So what else can I try? Another thing: Since I got this machine, I’ve never been able to align the portafilter in the center where the arrow is, unless there is no coffee at all. To add the amount of coffee that I seem to need, it’s always slightly off to the left.

1mavuhm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mavuhm,Bike camping again!,"3 days of riding, 2 nights of camping. Headed to Bristol and then Calne for the 2025 Bike Meet.

Although carrying gear on a bike is limited, you obviously have more options than what you can carry on your back, so I would say it was a very comfortable camp with some nice creatures comforts.

Left pannier is where I store food and clothing, I carry light amounts of each of these so the 32 litre pannier is plenty. I pick up food during stops if I need more and keep it simple. Sometime I cook on my tiny stove or, like this trip, just had a good old picnic.

Right pannier is gear, sleeping pad, sleeping pillow, sleeping bag liner, tiny bits and pieces that add up like toiletries, torches, stoves, coffee cup, spare batteries, zip ties, paracord and so on. Fills up quicker than I always expect!

Tail pack is my 40L pack, holds my Naturehike tent, Oxford chair and big cosy sleeping bag, stuffed in and then the bag rolled up as tight as possible. I attach this to the bikes frame but you may be able to see I use cargo netting and straps over it to ensure its on tight as well as using said cargo netting for my spare shoes or other assortment I may pick up (such as some shopping can be strapped down).

Tank bag holds my electrical or anything I need asap, such as medication, portable Chargers, tissues (hayfever is my enemy), snacks, my kindle. This has a waterproof cover inside ready for use. But my new system I'm using is keeping a drawstring bag rolled up in it, and when I stop and want to walk around I put the tank bag with valuables in the drawstring bag so I don't have to carry it by hand. Works well, easy solution to be hands free!

All in all, I sleep very comfortably and it's lovely to have a sit down at the end of the day so the chair may be my best item for moto camping to date!

Any questions welcomed, love chatting about the set up and love learning from others.",16,1753646110.0,camping,1,1.0,False

[Poster Credit to The Black Lion on Youtube](https://preview.redd.it/ffuxs4xffgff1.png?width=446&format=png&auto=webp&s=cf83ff972bc6c9599ef52f328d8b68a0ad345085)

Peter is now in College alongside Gwen and Harry, and the plot kickstarts with him bonding with the Symbiote (which latched on to him during the events of Spider-Man and The Fantastic Four.).

  
The main villain is Green Goblin, with Sandman and Mysterio as secondary villains. During the final battle, Gwen is killed by the Goblin, which causes an enraged Peter to almost kill Norman, who ends up being killed by his own glider. Realizing how the symbiote has affected him, he ditches it and the film ends with him meeting Mary-Jane Watson (still played by Zendaya.) and Ned Leeds.

2. Helluva Boss Season 2 (2019)

https://preview.redd.it/9xjnaxufggff1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=1248a6e4be5f49b5410951992fd4a335747efd3b

Most of the season stays the same up to Episode 7, The Full Moon and the rest of the episodes are completely dropped and instead the season (much like S1) lasts 8 episodes. The season 2 finale (which I would title ""Let There Be Karnage"") would focus on Blitz and co. being hired to assassinate a mysterious serial killer known only as ""Kassady"" (nicknamed ""Kassady Karnage"" by the media.). Meanwhile, the Cherubs return with their subplot being the same as The Full Moon.

  
During the final battle, while the M&M's and Loona battle the Cherubs in their mech suits, Blitz battles Kassady (who is somewhat of a dark reflection of Blitz.) and eventually kills him. However, just as Kassady is shot in the head, a piece of the Venom symbiote that split off from it at the end of Ultimate Spider-Man attatches to Kassady through the hole in his head (causing it to turn red) and turns him into Carnage.

  
Carnage almost kills Blitz, but he is saved by Moxxie who summons a firestorm using the Grimoire and blasts Carnage with it, destroying the symbiote and killing Kassady in the process. However, in a post-credits scene, it's revealed a piece of the Carnage symbiote survived (now infused with Kassady's consciousnesses)  and it bonds to Cletus, turning him into the next Carnage.

3. Fantastic Four: Doomsday (2021)

https://preview.redd.it/rhqwh0qvjgff1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=862ecb407726800565bdba3b5a5a2fc6abd31706

I don't really have too much of an in-depth plot here, so all you really need to know is that Doctor Doom is the villain, with his origins and motivations being explored, and Reed and Sue would also get married in this film.

4. Venom (2021)

https://preview.redd.it/q3zxxer0lgff1.png?width=426&format=png&auto=webp&s=a1033ce2ebc5845f94b3b56604744c9bb5d5ee5e

Overall, it's basically the same film albeit Venom has the tarantula symbol and the Carnage tease is different.

5. Hazbin Hotel: Bad Blood (2022)

https://preview.redd.it/kq246nwglgff1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9e80c1d0eaf3f93f12ab111e1364bc7f80b8a307

About a year after the events of Alastor and Blitz, Alastor and Charlie are now engaged, and Alastor has to find a way to get Lucifer (who in this timeline is actually the son of Mephisto and an unknown angel) to approve the marriage, also Cherri Bomb and Baxter (the angler fish dude who will be appearing in Season 2.) have joined the Hotel. The plot kickstarts when Seviathan (Charlie's ex.) kidnaps her and intends to force her to marry him, forcing Alastor and Lucifer (alongside the rest of the Hazbins, of course.) to work together to rescue her.

  
Along their journey, they are saved by Johnny Blaze/Ghost Rider, who joins up with them because Seviathan is actually working with Mephisto, though it's later revealed Seviathan was actually a pawn in the scheme of his sister Helsa, who he kills and then plans to take over ALL of Hell in a misguided attempt to get approval from his father Harold (which BTW is a really non-intimidating name.).

  
The Hazbins and Ghost Rider---eventually joined by Blackheart, who realizes how truly evil his father is and turns against him---manage to rescue Charlie and defeat Seviathan, who is killed by Mephisto as punishment for failing him before the latter promises the Hazbins that he will return (kinda similar to that scene near the end of Zack Snyder's Justice League.).

6. Midnight Sons (2022)

https://preview.redd.it/jdaarudjtgff1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=130ea21fdecd603c39ba0011887636df01171261

With Lucifer having agreed to Alastor and Charlie's marriage at the end of HH: BB, the two demons finally tie the knot and are on their honeymoon until Blitz, Johnny, Eddie and Venom show up and recruit Alastor to help them take down Carnage, who has become ungodly powerful and plans on summoning Knull, the god of the Symbiotes to take over both Earth and Hell. Soon joined by street-level heroes Spider-Man and Daredevil (who wouldn't get a sequel in this phase, but **will** in Phase Three, don't worry Daredevil stans.), the newly-formed Midnight Sons take on Carnage and his Symbiote army. Ultimately, Carnage is defeated and destroyed, Cletus is abandoned by Collin and Keenie (who go off to run a coffee shop cuz why not, it's cute.) and the Midnight Sons go their separate ways, though they promise to reassemble if they are ever needed again.

7. Blade (2022)

https://preview.redd.it/qteilcxm1hff1.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b58f7cc1cfe85926d1cebc188be359b664d239b8

This film focuses on Blade (obviously) as he goes on a hunt for a mysterious vampire who's been causing a bunch of mysterious murders around Brooklyn. Joined by Abraham Whistler and Hannibal King, he eventually finds and fights this vampire--- Dr. Michael Morbius (played by Keanu Reeves), who, as it turns out, was turned into a dhampyr and manipulated by his adopted brother Milo. Blade, Whistler, King and Morbius team up to fight Milo, they defeat and kill him, and in a post-credits scene Blade and co. are recruited into the Midnight Sons by Johnny Blaze.

I begged him to help me be strong today, to be with me, begged him to help me know what to do. Told him I love him idk how many times. Told him that I would do this for him, to take care of him one last time, at our place. I just want to find some jewlery I gave him. I want his nightstand and his desk chair. He spent alot of time working and playing video games in that chair, I snuck up behind him and kissed him on his neck and the side of his face while he laughed and playfully told me to stop all the time, in that chair. He really loved it and can picture him sitting in it. He wanted to buy me one too, I guess it was expensive. It'll help me feel closer to him to have them. 

I think I grabbed all the clothes I wanted of his already. I want to donate the rest as I've said before. There's some larger items, the couch he stopped breathing on I dont want to look at ever again and a heavy tv stand were going to have to get out of there somehow. I just hope it doesn't take very long tbh. I don't want to spend most of my day on this, does that seem selfish? I just want to be done with it all. Done with that place where I tried so hard to keep him with me and he fought to stay. 

I don't even have a plan for what I want to do for the rest of the day except maybe get a little food and come back to this room alone with a few more pieces of our life together. I know I'll be too tired to take a walk or anything after so I'll probably just sit here, letting something I won't really be watching play on the TV while I read or respond to things on this sub or other grief subs. I'll probably write to him too, I have everyday since his Celebration of Life. It brings me a little comfort. I was always writing him love notes or notes to be funny. It almost feels like hes reading them over my shoulder sometimes. Its hard to explain but sometimes shortly after it happened, I felt him...go into me. So I have this feeling of carrying him inside me but the loss of him physically is just so consuming sometimes, it'll just burst out of me in a flood of tears even when I think I'm sort of okay. I wear his ring and I kiss it alot because for some reason it reminds me of kissing his lips. Their shape. I feel like he can feel it. Silly, right?

I don't know what to do with myself anymore. I miss my best friend. We were only apart when I was working 8 hours a day. Texted constantly. I was safe, I was really happy with him. Happiest I've ever been in my whole life. He was my home, I felt complete. People looked at us and saw that we were meant to be and said so all the time. I was a better me with him and now I feel like I don't know who I am anymore. The sun shining seems offensive because my light is gone.

I got 3 years and 2 months with the other piece of my soul in this lifetime. He had two major losses already in his life before he met me. He gets to be with them now and I have to be the one to go on and be strong this time around. For what? I have no fucking clue. I am supposed to figure that out according to the woo woo shit I believe (I am doubting those beliefs a bit if you can't tell) I don't know what the hell I am doing here. I have zero direction except wake up, shift between zoning out or thinking about him constantly to talking to him out loud about all the stuff we used to talk about, and trying to get through my shifts without crying because my mind wandered to what we'd be doing if he was still here. I never know what to do with myself and just end up sitting here when we used to never be at home on beautiful days. 

A friend offered to get me outta my room tomorrow, I asked if he could take me some place to watch the sunset that wasn't too crowded. We loved watching sunsets together, doing anything together really but I feel compelled to watch the sun go down some place peaceful. It'll be nice to talk to another person besides my family. I have some books I requested at the library (still trying to figure out how the new system works, I feel like an old person trying to figure out new technology after not going for so long, shit has been updated lol) I'll probably take a walk there tomorrow morning. Get some breakfast and an iced coffee pick up my several books on grief and life after death. (Yay coping mechanisms) maybe read in their little enclosed garden for a while then walk back home and read some more until my friend comes to get me. 

I still don't have his ashes yet. I am still waiting on my memento necklace to place some of his hair in. I need something, anything physical to hold onto. I feel like I actually NEED it. 

Idk where I was going with this post, just to vent my feelings I suppose. I hope everyone is having a bearable day today, I love ya'll and thanks for being the awesome part of this very shitty club. ❤️‍🩹",3,1753646032.0,widowers,4,1.0,False

Is there an origin/elevation/other combo I should focus on, when aiming for the flavour profile I described above? I'm looking for characteristics rather than brand suggestions because I live in Greece, so many US-specific brands will either not be available for purchase or be overly expensive due to logistics and/or taxes.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **GAIS vs. IFK Värnamo: A Tactical Tussle with a Touch of Absurdity**

The Allsvenskan’s IFK Värnamo vs. GAIS clash on August 2 promises a battle of wills, with the odds leaning heavily toward GAIS. Let’s dissect this matchup with the precision of a Swedish meatball and the humor of a misplaced *korv*.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

GAIS is the clear favorite here, with bookmakers pricing them between **+183 (FanDuel)** and **+191 (BetRivers)** in decimal terms (or roughly **-525 to -550** in American odds). Translating that to implied probabilities, GAIS has a **52.6% to 55.3%** chance to win outright—strong enough to make even the most jaded Allsvenskan fan consider betting their grandmother’s knitted scarves on them.

IFK Värnamo, meanwhile, is a **+400 to +430 underdog**, implying a **20.7% to 23.3%** win probability. The draw? A tidy **+350 to +390**, or **25.6% to 28.2%**—about the same chance as your local barista remembering your coffee order without you spelling your name 10 times.

The totals line is a **2.5-goal benchmark**, with Over and Under odds hovering around **+190 to +196** (implied \~51.1% to 52.3%). This suggests bookmakers expect a game that’s *just* spicy enough to keep bettors on the edge of their seats but not so chaotic that it becomes a free-for-all.

---

### Digesting the News: Injuries, Drama, and Shoelaces

Let’s spice things up with some *fabricated but plausible* team updates:

* **GAIS**: Their star striker, **Isak “The Iceman” Bergman**, has been in scorching form, netting 5 goals in his last 3 games. Recent rumors suggest he’s been training with a laser-guided boot… or maybe he’s just really good at juggling stress balls during halftime. Defensively, GAIS has been tighter than a Swede’s grip on their summer *smörgåsbord*.
* **IFK Värnamo**: Tragedy struck when their midfield general, \*\*Erik “

Done rifaximin/metronidazole- reduced from 35ppm to 29ppm and no symptom improvement

rifaximin/allicin/phgg- numbers increased, no symptom improvement

elemental diet 21 days- big reduction in numbers and symptoms, a course of antibiotics for tonsils shortly after wrecked progress

another round of elemental diet- numbers increased again to the highest they've ever been, although symptoms are not as bad

Now, in week 6 of allicin/neem/atrantil, and using foodmarble, numbers are consistently high, totally unrelated to food.

  
I take 700mg mac citrate every day, 2x kiwi, prokinetic before bed, as well as s boulardii, vitamin c, b12 injection, folate, vitamin d 6000mg. I take additional ginger if I feel nausea or full up for any reason

I poop anywhere between 1-3 times a day, they are decent volume, consistency, etc. I drink a good amount of water every day, with added plain electrolytes, use red light on my abdomen, visit an osteopath for visceral manipulation once a week.

  
Diet not hugely varied, but I eat every single day chicken, steak, rice, potato, sweet potato, courgette, carrot, kale, green beans, olive oil, salt, oregano, black coffee, fresh ginger tea, pineapple, kiwi, blueberries, and occasionally salted potato chips. So it might not be super expansive, but it's fairly rich in nutrients, calories, and a high amount of low fodmap foods, with smaller servings of high fodmap foods that I tolerate. I have had no difference in readings or symptoms when I have eaten these vs not.

  
My GI ecologix showed only mild dysbiosis, butyrate producers a little low, but all things considered really not a huge issue. Oat test was also fairly uneventful, some dopamine/serotonin issues but again very borderline and probably related to the domperidone I take when my nausea is bad.

  
I just can't think what I'm missing? I don't think I could be doing anything else more 'right', but I'm wondering if I'm too in it to notice- can anybody spot anything I havent tried yet? or that I should change?

I’ve also got a close friend group from college, including Emma (30F), who I’ve known for eight years. Emma’s always been flirty with everyone, but it’s just her personality, and Lisa’s never had an issue with it. Last weekend, we had a group hangout at a friend’s house drinks, games, music. Lisa couldn’t come because she was visiting family. At one point, Emma and I were joking around in the kitchen, and she got super close, like brushing my arm and whispering something flirty about my shirt. It felt like she might try to kiss me, but I backed off and changed the subject. Nothing happened, but I felt weird about it.

I told Lisa about it when she got back because I didn’t want to hide anything. Now she’s upset not at me, but at Emma. She says Emma crossed a line and wants me to confront her or cut contact. Emma texted me yesterday like nothing happened, asking to grab coffee with the group. I don’t think Emma meant anything serious, but I don’t want to hurt Lisa or make my friend group awkward. Lisa’s pushing for me to set boundaries, but I’m worried it’ll start drama since Emma’s a big part of our crew.

   TL;DR: My friend (30F) got flirty with me (29M) at a hangout, and now my girlfriend (28F) is upset and wants me to confront her. Nothing happened, but I don’t know how to handle it without causing drama.

How do I address this with Emma to set boundaries without ruining my friendship or group dynamic, while keeping my girlfriend happy?

Alpha’s Hidden Heir
👉 CONTINUE READING 👈
Chapter 1
In this city’s most glittering circle of power and wealth, I’ve always been invisible—

Except for one title: Donovan Barton’s woman.

He’s the king under the moonlight. Cold. Arrogant. Untouchable.

And me? I’m the caged canary he keeps.

I’m the only Omega in this elite circle without a family name to back me.

So at every socialite gathering, I’m an easy target.

The only reason I’m even allowed a seat at the table with these women, is because I know my place. I’m tactful. I’m smart enough to stay in my lane.

That’s why, even after nearly two years with Donovan—his longest-kept mistress—

I never act smug. Never flaunt. Never forget where I stand.

Right now, I’m doing what I do best: sitting in the quietest corner, happily nibbling on a macaron.

But at some point, the topic of conversation circles back to me.

“Mrs. Barton, we’ve all been dying to ask… Alpha Donovan always seems so cold and buttoned-up…”

No title is noble enough to shield a woman from gossip.

“Is he the same way in bed?”

“I get nervous just making eye contact with him. Doesn’t he scare you?”

“Is he rough in private?”

“He seems impossible to deal with—how’d you even land him?”

“Come on, spill it—bet he’s incredible in bed, isn’t he?”

My hand trembled slightly, nearly dropping my fork.

“Well… he’s just… average, really.”

“No way! He does not look like the ‘average’ type!”

“He’s always working. We barely see each other…”

I mumbled a few more vague excuses, squirming in my seat—until my phone rang.

The screen lit up with one word: oversize.

I nearly sighed in relief.

Excusing myself, I stepped aside to answer.

Donovan’s voice came through low and tired: “Having coffee?”

“Mhm. I also did a little shopping.”

“What’d you get?”

“A purse. And a necklace.”

“Buy a new dress, too.”

“I already did…”

“A nightgown.”

“Mr. Barton—”

“What do you call me?”

“…Donovan.”

My cheeks flushed hot. I glanced around like a thief and quickly turned off the speaker.

“I’ll pick you up in an hour,” he said, and hung up—his tone leaving no room for negotiation.

So I left the party early… and bought a new black lace slip.

Plunging neckline. Slits on both sides.

Silky, sheer, and sinfully soft.

As soon as I got in the car, Donovan crooked a finger. “Come here.”

I climbed onto his lap like a good girl.

Fresh from a full-body spa treatment, my skin was smooth and soft, my scent faintly sweet.

I melted against his chest, boneless and pliant.

Donovan was clearly pleased. He took off his glasses and tossed them into the console.

Then slid his long fingers around my waist. “Gained weight?”

He gave a firm squeeze, but his tone was oddly satisfied.

“I’ve been eating a little too much lately… I’ll start dieting tomorrow.”

Even after two years, moments like this still made me shy.

My ears turned red.

“No need to lose weight. I like you just like this.”

He held me tighter. I rested my head on his chest.

“Alpha, you just got back from a business trip… But you still pick me up. You must be exhausted.”

“Then shouldn’t you be rewarding me tonight?”

I looked up, flustered. “Shouldn’t you be…recovering your strength?”

Donovan chuckled low in his throat. His hand slid down my back, unfastening my strap.

“Little minx. You’re getting bold.”

“I’m just worried about your health…”

His eyes traveled slowly down my body, dark and molten.

He lifted a finger, brushing against the delicate lace at my collarbone.

“Well, I suppose ‘average’ doesn’t quite cut it for our refined little Mrs. Barton.”

My eyes flew wide. The fingers I had curled around his waist suddenly went cold.

“Donovan…”

I lost track of how many times I begged for mercy that night.

My limbs were too soft to cling to him, drooping helplessly over the side of the bed.

Donovan leaned down and captured my swollen lips again.

“Donovan!”

I forced open my tear-bright eyes, flushed and dazed.

“Bailey.”

He finally let go—but not without biting my earlobe lightly, whispering:

“Relax. No matter how busy I am… I’ll always have the energy to fuck you.”

I couldn’t help cursing him in my head.

Petty. Arrogant.

Always so calm and proper in public. So cold, so untouchable.

But once the clothes come off—

He’s nothing but a beast.

Who would ever guess…

That the Alpha who never loosens his tie and always buttons up to the neck has a favorite kink—

He makes me undo every single button.

One. By. One.

Chapter 2
When I woke up the next morning, Donovan was already gone.

Not that it was surprising.

I was nothing more than the canary he kept in his New York Pack House—

Someone to dine with, laugh with, sleep with.

By day, I was just an Omega he used to pass the time.

So I stayed curled up in bed, sleeping until noon.

Scrolling through Instagram with idle fingers.

Until a push notification caught my eye: “Rising art star Erica returns to the U.S. to kick off her global exhibition tour. First stop—New York.”

Erica.

The name made my heart jolt.

There was something eerily familiar about it.

I typed her name into the search bar.

And then a suggested search popped up that made my blood run cold—

Erica Donovan.

I tapped on the profile. Only one post.

“This is what a real Alpha and his true Luna look like.”

The photo was old and grainy.

A tall, striking man with sharp features stood beside a delicate girl with a gentle smile.

He looked down at her with an expression far too soft.

She had his jacket draped over her shoulders.

A kindness I had never been offered.

I shut off my phone, lay back down, and closed my eyes.

Sleep dragged me under quickly.

In the dream, I was near full term—weak and bedridden.

Donovan stood at my bedside, arm in arm with Erica.

Matching silver mate rings gleamed on their left hands—

The kind only Alphas and their Luna, with bloodline compatibility, could wear.

His voice was ice: “Bailey, have the baby. I’ll give you ten million.”

“Erica can’t have children. She’ll raise this one as her own.”

“Whatever you want, I’ll give you. As long as you leave our Pack. Forever.”

“You understand? It’ll be a blessing for the child to have Erica as his mother.”

I took the money and walked away.

But I couldn’t stay gone.

I came back, secretly, hoping to reclaim my child.

Only to find—he adored Erica.

Wouldn’t even recognize me as his birth mother.

He was ashamed of me.

I couldn’t take it. I spiraled.

Until I lost all reason… even tried to have Erica killed.

Donovan was the one who personally sent me to psychiatric hospital.

I woke up with tears soaking my cheeks.

When Donovan wasn’t traveling, no matter how late, he always came home to the Pack House.

But this time, it had been three days.

I hadn’t seen him at all.

I tried reaching him through our mind link. He didn’t answer.

So I called.

He picked up.

His voice was as calm and restrained as always.

“Work’s been hectic lately.”

“If you’re bored at home, go shop, grab coffee.”

“And don’t go on a diet.”

I hesitated. “When are you coming back?”

“In a couple days,” he said, and ended the call.

Shortly after, I got a payment notification—five million dollars.

Then a message: [Buy whatever you want.]

In the past, whenever he wired me money, I’d flood his inbox with heart emojis, playful voice notes, sweet little acts of affection—just like a proper canary should.

But today, I stared at the chat box for a long time.

Finally, I typed only two words: “Thank you.”

He didn’t reply.

That afternoon, I turned on the TV and caught a news report: Donovan Barton, elusive Alpha lord of Blackrock Corporation, made a rare appearance at the airport today.

The footage showed him personally receiving a woman surrounded by tight security—

Erica.

Her face was nearly hidden, but she leaned into him, head down, fingers clutching the corner of his coat.

Donovan had deployed the entire Pack’s protection system for her.

And me?

The Omega who’d shared his bed for two years?

I was tabloid fodder—paparazzi photos, public shame, online abuse.

He wouldn’t even hire me a lawyer.

So this was the difference—

Between a Luna cradled in the palm of his hand, and a pet Omega kept for his convenience.

I turned off the TV and went downstairs.

The servants had already set the table for dinner.

I sat down and said lightly, “Alpha’s not coming home tonight. We can eat without him.”

I ate slowly, carefully.

After all, this might be my last meal in his Pack House.

Donovan had said he’ll be back in a couple days.

He never broke his word.

So I made my decision—

On the night Erica returned to New York, while he celebrated and forgot I even existed, I would leave.

I didn’t take any clothes or jewelry.

Left the black credit card on the nightstand.

But I had one thing of my own:

A personal bank account with nearly eight figures from the sale of a penthouse he gave me years ago.

I had always known this day would come.

My mother, a regular Omega, passed away young.

My father remarried and cut all ties with me.

There was nothing left for me in New York.

So I bought a random plane ticket—

To somewhere in the South.

Just as I was about to board, my phone rang.

It was him.

In the last two years, I had never missed a single call from Donovan.

But this time, I let it ring.

He didn’t call again.

I blocked every number he had.

Then I powered off my phone and boarded the plane.

Just before stepping inside, I looked back one last time.

The New York sky was starless—choked with heavy smog.

I never really liked this city.

I was just in love with someone who lived here.

Chapter 3
At that very moment—

Donovan lit a cigarette and stepped out onto the balcony of the private lounge.

He dialed that familiar number again.

The only reply was the cold tone of an automated message.

His brow furrowed. He called again. Still no answer.

With a sharp flick, he crushed the cigarette underfoot, spun around, and strode back inside.

Grabbing his coat, he was halfway out the door when—

“Donovan, where are you going?” Erica stood up, reaching for him.

He sidestepped her hand, voice cool and detached: “Enjoy the gathering. I’ll host you another day.”

“Donovan…” Her voice trembled, laced with a hint of tears.

But he didn’t even look back.

The moment he got into the car—before the door had even shut—he snapped at the driver, “Step on it. Take me to the Pack House.”

The car sped through the city as sudden rain poured from the sky.

Thunder cracked overhead, but the driver, sensing the storm brewing inside the car as well, didn’t dare slow down.

Moments later, the vehicle pulled into the house’s gates.

A servant waited outside with a black umbrella, looking anxious.

Donovan got out without a word, heading straight for the Pack House—

Only to find it empty.

“Where’s the Luna?” was the first thing out of his mouth.

“She… she went upstairs to rest after dinner,” the servant answered cautiously.

Donovan’s jaw eased a fraction. But he didn’t stop walking.

The house was dark—no lights in the foyer, none upstairs either.

A strange tightness crept into his chest.

In the past two years, Bailey had never missed one of his calls.

No matter how late he came home, there would always be a light left on for him in the living room.

And one nightlight glowing gently in the upstairs hallway.

A maid knelt to help him remove his shoes.

He raised a hand to stop her.

“I’ll check on her myself.”

The house maintained a perfect climate year-round, but he didn’t even bother taking off his coat as he headed up the stairs.

The master bedroom door was slightly ajar.

Pitch black inside.

Donovan paused, fingers resting on the doorknob.

For a brief second, he hesitated—

Uncertain why he suddenly felt reluctant to open it.

Rain pelted the windows.

His thoughts reeled.

He finally pushed the door open.

“Bailey?”

No answer.

The bed was neatly made.

Two pillows, side by side—still close as always.

But the sheets were undisturbed.

He stood frozen in the doorway for a long moment.

Then stepped inside.

He switched on the light. The room filled with a soft glow.

Everything looked the same.

Even her vanity table, still cluttered with makeup and skincare she used daily—

All left exactly as before.

Except now, there was a stack of bank cards…

And a folded piece of stationery on top.

His heart sank without warning.

He picked up the note and opened it.

There were only two short lines:

Alpha:

Thank you for your care these past two years.

I hope you get everything you’ve ever wanted.

—Bailey

Donovan slowly set the note down.

In the mirror, his reflection stared back—

Composed. Cold. Not a flicker of emotion.

But only he knew—

There was a fire in his chest, slamming against his ribs, barely contained.

He was never one to show his emotions.

Always in control. Always restrained.

But if Bailey were in front of him right now, he knew he’d lose that control completely.

He’d make her submit.

Donovan turned and walked out.

Downstairs, his Beta, assistants, and servants waited in tense silence.

Without lifting his gaze, he spoke to his secretary: “Replace every servant and staff member in the house.”

“Alpha…” someone dared to speak.

“Anyone who can’t even keep track of the Luna doesn’t deserve to stay.”

His tone was icy, his eyes flicking up just once to sweep across the nervous faces before him.

Then he looked away, loosened his wristwatch, rolled his shoulders.

His voice dropped even lower—dangerously calm: “If the Luna returns safe and sound, consider yourselves lucky.”

“But if she’s hurt, even a single hair, you all know what happens next.”

With that, Donovan walked out.

And as he turned, he was already pulling out his phone.

He barked into the receiver: “Contact the aviation bureau. I want the full manifest of every flight that left New York tonight.”

Chapter 4
I’ve always slept like the dead on flights.

I remember the first time I traveled with Donovan for a business trip—

I passed out so hard, I woke up sprawled completely on top of him.

There was even a suspicious wet patch on his shoulder.

I was mortified. Flustered. Terrified, even.

I was fully prepared to be tossed off the plane and fed to the wolves the moment we landed.

But Donovan didn’t say a word. Not even a hint of blame.

He was wearing his glasses, still reviewing documents mid-flight.

When he noticed how panicked I looked, his voice came out just a little gentler than usual.

“Sleep well?”

“Yes, Alpha.”

“Want something to eat?”

I nodded—then shook my head.

But he still ordered a meal, then said, “Eat something. I’ll be done soon.”

After that, I flew with him many times—business trips, vacations.

Almost every time, I’d end up dozing peacefully in his arms.

Donovan wasn’t one for flash. He rarely used the private jet.

But when he did…

Just thinking about it made my ears burn.

Private jets were small, and Donovan… was anything but gentle.

I could never keep quiet when things got intense.

Which probably explained why the flight attendants never once made eye contact with me as I disembarked.

But until now, I’d never taken a flight alone.

Maybe I’d gotten too used to falling asleep wrapped in his arms.

That’s why I woke so suddenly this time.

The cabin speaker crackled with updates about our flight.

Soon after takeoff, the storm rolled in—

Lightning, thunder, rain pounding harder by the minute.

Several flights were already delayed or turning back.

Then came the announcement: Due to severe weather, our flight would also be returning to New York.

Passengers began grumbling all around me.

“Now that’s rare,” someone said. “I’ve flown this route a hundred times and never seen a weather return.”

“I’m eighty years old,” another chimed in. “First time I’ve ever experienced this.”

A strange, absurd thought bloomed in my mind.

It sounded ridiculous… and yet, if anyone could pull it off, it would be Donovan.

The world knew him as a powerful Alpha CEO.

But I’d always sensed his background was even deeper, more terrifying than what the public saw.

Even the part he let the world glimpse was already a canyon I could never cross.

I never dared think too deeply about who he truly was.

So the thought that flickered through my mind just now—

I laughed at myself.

Donovan was too composed, too self-controlled.

A man like him…

Would never do something so reckless over a woman.

Planes turn back all the time—for weather, emergencies, technical issues.

Never once had it been for someone like me.

Airport staff arranged for passengers to stay overnight in nearby hotels.

I collected my luggage and followed the crowd.

But once I reached the terminal lobby, I stopped.

I waited.

Until daylight broke across the sky.

Donovan never showed.

I laughed at myself, bitterly.

I was just a mistress.

Why would he do this for me?

I picked up my bag once again and boarded another flight.

The morning air in New York was fresh and clean.

A rare thing after a storm.

And I decided—this time, for good.

I would do what Donovan once said he hoped I’d do from the start: never return to New York again.

I settled in a small city down south.

Just as I was preparing to start over, I found out I was pregnant.

I remembered that dream.

And suddenly it made sense—

Why Donovan hadn’t used protection that night.

That wasn’t like him.

Thank God I’d left when I did.

But now, with a child growing inside me…

I hesitated.

Should I keep the baby?

I was genuinely excited to try BT, especially since they started out as a roastery. I assumed they’d offer a range of manual brew methods and let customers choose from different beans. My plan was to try a new light roast using an Aeropress, and if I liked it, buy the beans for home use.

But to my surprise, the only manual option was V60, alongside the usual espresso-based drinks. The menu felt pretty basic, and there wasn't any flexibility in terms of bean choice or brew method.

Am I expecting too much from a café? I just thought that a brand rooted in selling specialty beans would lean more into the experience and customization. It also feels like a missed opportunity- letting people sample different beans with preferred brew methods could easily convert casual drinkers into customers who buy their beans.",1,1753645546.0,IndiaCoffee,2,0.67,False

Business is far different than these scams. If you want to do business start with selling what you know and start lean. There are tons of resources to understand about it.

> During a quiet winter day, with soft raindrops falling, I visited my favorite art gallery, a place I used to go to every day.
While deeply immersed in the painting (The Coffee Seller), my thoughts were interrupted by a mother calling out to her son who had wandered off while she was lost in the painting (The Family).
Her voice broke the silence of the place.
Moments later, a car crash was heard, followed by the scream of an unknown child.
Everyone rushed outside...
But the most terrified was that mother—
Because the screaming child was hers.
His soul ascended peacefully.
Or maybe... it didn’t.
It stayed trapped in that gallery.
My soul visits it every day since that accident.
Yes... this is my story.
And that mother—the silence-breaker—was my own.



I wrote this story when I was in sixth grade. My teacher gave me 5 out of 20, just because I didn’t write a ""traditional"" story.

## Key Features analysis

The modern in-wall water dispenser is equipped with a range of features designed to enhance convenience, performance, and safety. Understanding these features is critical when evaluating different models and selecting the best option for your specific requirements.

**Filtration System:**

The quality of the filtration system is paramount for ensuring clean and safe drinking water. Many in-wall dispensers now utilize multi-stage filtration systems that remove sediment, chlorine, lead, and other impurities. These systems often incorporate activated carbon filters, UV sterilization, and reverse osmosis technology for comprehensive purification. The filtration capacity, filter life, and ease of replacement are vital factors to consider, as they directly impact maintenance and long-term costs.

**Temperature Control:**

Advanced models offer precise temperature control, allowing users to dispense water at various temperatures, including cold, hot, and ambient. This feature is notably useful for preparing beverages, such as tea and coffee, or simply enjoying a refreshing glass of cold water. Temperature ranges typically span from near freezing to boiling, with programmable settings to customize dispensing based on individual preferences.Digital displays and intuitive controls further enhance the user experience, providing real-time temperature feedback and simple adjustments.

**installation Requirements:**

Proper installation is crucial for the functionality and longevity of an in-wall water dispenser. These units require a connection to both a water line and an electrical outlet, often necessitating professional installation. Understanding the specific plumbing and electrical requirements, as well as the wall cavity dimensions, is essential before purchasing a unit. some models are designed for retrofit installations, minimizing the need for extensive modifications, while others are better suited for new construction or renovation projects.Key features of the top models include:

* Touchless dispensing
* Leak detection and auto-shutoff
* Child safety locks
* Energy-efficient cooling and heating

## Core Benefits

In-wall water dispensers offer several compelling benefits that make them an attractive choice to customary water coolers and bottled water systems. From enhanced convenience to improved aesthetics, these dispensers provide a modern and efficient solution for hydration needs.

**Space Saving:**

One of the primary advantages of an in-wall water dispenser is its space-saving design. By recessing the unit into the wall, it eliminates the need for bulky floor-standing coolers or countertop dispensers, freeing up valuable floor space. This is particularly beneficial in smaller kitchens,offices,or waiting rooms where space is at a premium. The clean, minimalist aesthetic of an in-wall dispenser also contributes to a more streamlined and modern look.

**Enhanced Hygiene:**

In-wall water dispensers are designed to promote better hygiene compared to shared water coolers. Many models feature touchless dispensing, minimizing the risk of cross-contamination.Additionally, the enclosed system protects the water supply from airborne contaminants and dust. Regular maintenance and filter replacement further ensure the purity and safety of the dispensed water.

**Increased Convenience:**

The convenience of having a readily accessible source of filtered water cannot be overstated. With an in-wall dispenser, users can easily obtain cold, hot, or ambient water at the touch of a button, eliminating the need to store and handle bottled water. this convenience encourages greater water consumption, contributing to improved hydration and overall well-being. Programming features like dispensing volume control make it even more user-friendly and adaptable to individual needs, allowing for filling everything from small cups to large pitchers with ease.

## FAQs Section

Many potential buyers have common questions about in-wall water dispensers. Addressing these questions can help alleviate concerns and provide clarity on the features, installation, and maintenance of these appliances.

**What are the electrical requirements?**
Most in-wall water dispensers require a standard 120V electrical outlet. The amperage draw is typically low, ranging from 2 to 5 amps, which is comparable to other small kitchen appliances.It is essential to ensure that the outlet is properly grounded and meets local electrical codes.Some models may have specific requirements, so consulting the manufacturer's specifications is always recommended.

**How frequently enough do the filters need to be replaced?**
The frequency of filter replacement depends on the model and the quality of the water supply. Generally,pre-filters designed to remove sediment and larger particles should be replaced every 6-12 months.Activated carbon filters, which remove chlorine and other contaminants, typically last for 6-12 months as well. More advanced filters, such as reverse osmosis membranes, can last for 2-5 years. Monitoring the water quality and following the manufacturer's recommendations are essential for optimal performance and water safety.

**Can I install an in-wall water dispenser myself?**
while some handy homeowners may be tempted to undertake the installation process themselves, it is generally recommended to hire a qualified plumber and electrician to ensure proper installation. In-wall water dispensers require a connection to both a water line and an electrical outlet, and improper installation can lead to leaks, electrical hazards, or damage to the unit. Professional installation also ensures that the dispenser complies with local plumbing and electrical codes.

About a year ago I restored this V1 and it had been working just fine, no problems during extractions, these last few days extractions have become slower (Note: haven't changed beans nor grind setting for about a year). Yesterday, I tried extracting my morning espresso and just tiny drops came out from the spouts. I verified for water coming out of the group head shower screen and verified the solenoid valve to make sure it wasn't activated, and it wasn't everything seemed to be working fine. Dialed the beans coarser but still, nothing came out from the spouts so I believe it has something to do with pressure. I decide to do a descale and backflush with cafiza to make sure it wasn't gunked up with debris, tried that and it didn't work either, so I decide to check the OPV pressure. I tested the pressure using the Scale and Timer method, first test I noticed I got around 5.5oz of water in 1min which translates to low pressure on grouphead. I adjust the OPV valve to 130mL in 30 secs which translates to 9 bars of pressure, and the extraction seems to be a little bit faster but still slow. Today I went for my morning coffee and didn't get a good flow coming out from spouts, verified pressure again and got 100mL in 30secs.

Can this be the water pump on its final days? checked for leaks inside machine and doesn't seem to be any.

Chapter 1
 My husband spends most of each year expanding his business in New York. I secretly applied for a business trip there to surprise him.
 My boss handed me a family portrait showing only four tightly clasped hands.
 ""This is Mr. Carter's family of four. Prepare gifts properly for this visit.""
 I stared at the photo, momentarily dazed by the familiar wristwatch.
 But Benjamin Carter had knelt before his parents for three days and nights just to remain childfree as DINKs.
 I brushed off my doubts and went on the business trip.
 Never did I expect to see my husband at the hotel with two children, his fingers intertwined with another woman's.
 Seeing two faces that mirrored Benjamin's like carbon copies, I froze where I stood.
 Benjamin claimed love should be pure, untainted by children.
 Yet he only practiced DINK with me while raising kids elsewhere.
 A colleague excitedly pushed me forward: ""It's Mr. Carter's family! How lucky! Greet them now.""
 The woman instantly released Benjamin's hand and approached us:
 ""Are you Olivia Parker from the project team? What a surprise meeting you early. I'm Sophia Roberts Mitchell, Mrs. Carter.""
 She knew me, declaring herself Benjamin's wife to my face.
 How dare she act so unabashedly as a mistress?!
 Recalling how my boss had suddenly allowed my project involvement, I wondered—was this her deliberate setup?
 Benjamin's smile froze when he saw me. He carefully set down the little girl he was holding, took her hand, and after a moment's hesitation, extended his hand toward me.
 ""Nice to meet you,"" he said, pretending not to know me.
 My lower teeth ache as I bite down, staring at his cold, distant face—it feels like a lifetime has passed.
 After our college entrance exams, Benjamin confessed to me in front of the entire school. We then attended the same university and married right after graduation.
 Ten years together, his passion gradually faded. I thought love had simply evolved into family bonds.
 Turns out he had another wife and children elsewhere—a son already six years old, born the very year we married.
 So all this time he's been traveling between two countries... Is it for me? Or for that happy family in New York?
 Seeing I didn't shake hands, Benjamin frowned with displeasure: ""Is this how your company conducts business?""
 Sophia immediately grasped his hand, soothing him with a smile:
 ""Sophia's just keeping a respectful distance since you're a married man. Very professional—I quite admire that in a woman.""
 Her words sounded like she was defending me, yet I found myself biting the inside of my cheek to stifle a bitter laugh.
 Benjamin pretended not to know me, while Sophia kept asserting her claim over him.
 What did that make me?
 My colleague tensed, hastily pushing down on my back to bow:
 ""Mr. and Mrs. Carter, please forgive her. She's just off a flight and not herself. Our deepest apologies.""
 ""Distance is wise. Everyone knows you're the epitome of marital bliss—a true fairy-tale couple in our circle.""
 I wanted to confront Benjamin, but the fiery defiance evaporated the moment my colleague forced me into that bow.
 Yeah, Benjamin is the CEO who needs to be flattered, while I'm just a small employee who has to beg the boss for a chance to join a multinational project.
 Sorry, we came specifically to cooperate with you, absolutely no intention to offend.
 After apologizing proactively, I bowed again, looking at Benjamin and Sophia's interlocked fingers, my eyes stung.
 Sophia affectionately held Benjamin's arm:
 It's okay, I also heard about your strong professional skills and that's why I put you in charge, but my husband and I are going home now, let's talk about the project another day?
Chapter 2
Chapter 2
 We've never met before, but she seems to know me quite well. It seems that my coming to New York is indeed related to her.
 Thinking about this period, the whole department has been working overtime until they have dark circles under their eyes, and the friend who's waiting for the project's success to get promoted.
 I didn't say anything else, forcing a smile and nodding.
 ""Hope you both enjoy your evening.""
 Benjamin opened his mouth as if to speak to me, but his hand was held by the child and Sophia.
 He immediately turned away with a smile, scooping up the child and following Sophia.
 Back at the hotel, I stared blankly at my empty phone screen.
 Why couldn't Benjamin even give me an explanation?
 I kept dialing his number until he hung up repeatedly, clearly annoyed, and finally blocked me.
 I sat there blankly until midnight, when Benjamin's text finally came through:
 [Olivia, you know how much I love you. The child and Sophia were accidents. Step back from this project first—I'll explain everything when I'm back.]
 [Be good. Don't make a scene.]
 Don’t make a scene?
 What counts as making a scene?
 Sophia wiped away tears, numbly tapping redial.
 Only a blocked tone answered.
 For Benjamin, I who always loved children agreed to be DINK. Yet he had kids with someone else—couldn't even give me a reason.
 If the first child was an accident, what about the second one?
 Ten years together, and ""stop making a scene"" is all he offers? What am I to him?
 Calmer now, clinging to hope, I texted: 【When did you and her start?】
 Benjamin replied: 【The die is cast. My fault. I'll compensate you—bought that island you liked last month.】
 Sophia knows nothing about this.】
 His reply doused the last flicker of anger in my heart like a bucket of cold water.
 If moments ago I was still bewildered and furious, now my heart felt as if thrown into an ice cellar.
 All emotions vanished instantly.
 Indeed, I’d sensed it long ago in the subtle details of our life together—we were no longer the inseparable couple clinging to each other during our passionate early days.
 At first, he traveled abroad every other month, then spent most of the year away later on, only returning for holidays. I should have realized it sooner.
 I mistook it for his intense career drive, never complained, and even encouraged him to pursue his ambitions.
 Lack of companionship was forgivable, but betrayal was inexcusable.
 He stopped replying to my messages, and I lost the will to press further.
 Early next morning, my mother-in-law called.
 ""Olivia, I heard you made a scene in front of Sophia! Can't you behave?""
 Her scolding froze me—she'd always been gentle, never using that tone before.
 I bit my lower lip, staring down at the floor. ""I didn’t, Mom.""
 ""I didn’t.""
 ""You call me Mom? Then remember Sophia is the child’s mother! Listen to me—return home now. Don’t let her discover your relationship with Benjamin.""
 Her voice softened midway: ""She’s emotionally fragile with the child. Since you don’t have children, be sensible and don’t trigger her.""
 My grip almost failed me—realizing she showed even more tenderness toward Sophia than toward me.
 He even lashed out at me for Sophia's sake.
 ""But I'm Benjamin's wife, Mom.""
 Summoning courage again, I sniffled and cautiously tested my mother-in-law's reaction.
 She exploded instantly: ""You can't even bear a child! What kind of proper wife are you?! Benjamin hasn't divorced you only out of respect for your history. Don't push your luck.""
 Years ago, when Benjamin felt downcast after being forced into business studies, I encouraged him to take over the family business.
 Later, when Benjamin knelt before her for three days straight declaring he didn't want children, I spent two days mediating peace. She even praised me for being understanding and saving her trouble.
 Throughout our marriage, I managed the household for years, obeying Benjamin and my mother-in-law without question, growing ever more dutiful and respectful.
 Just because I didn't have a child, I was seen as pushing my luck.
 And the mother-in-law I thought treated me better than my own parents actually knew long ago that Benjamin had a child outside and helped him keep me in the dark.
 I was just an outsider.
 Holding back my tears, I said my final words, ""Fine, let's divorce.""
 Isn't it just to make room for Sophia? Fine.
Chapter 3
Chapter 3
 As soon as dawn broke, my boss told me the project didn't go through and asked me to return home.
 Although I never thought Benjamin could be so heartless, it doesn't matter anymore.
 I didn't want to have any contact with them anymore, so I took out my phone, contacted a lawyer, and drafted a divorce agreement, just waiting for his signature to finalize the divorce.
 However, as I was pulling my suitcase out of the hotel door, Sophia stopped me.
 ""Let's talk, Sophia.""
 Seeing me ignore her and walk straight out, Sophia shook the file folder in her hand. ""I think you need this.""
 I closed my eyes, opened them, exhaled my pent-up frustration, and followed Sophia to the coffee shop.
 She pushed the coffee toward me, then twisted the ring on her finger.
 ""Sophia, look how hard you tried, only to get kicked out immediately. Things that aren’t yours won’t be yours no matter how hard you fight.""
 ""You know?""
 I curled my lips into a cold smile. ""What gives you, a mistress, the right to say that to me?""
 She took off her ring and handed it to me. ""See clearly?""
 Benjamin has the matching men’s version of this ring, and he’s never taken it off.
 My palm bled where my nails dug in, yet my expression remained unreadable. ""So what? Benjamin and I have a marriage certificate. We're husband and wife.""
 Sophia shook her head and chuckled with disdain:
 ""You're mistaken. Marriage can end in divorce, but having a child creates an unbreakable, happy family.""
 ""He lied about being DINK while letting me bear his child because he never accepted you as his true wife. He's loved only me all along.""
 No wonder Benjamin hated children despite his picture-perfect family.
 I used to think it stemmed from psychological trauma and kept trying to help him heal through love.
 The truth was... What he despised all along was my lowly, unworthy self.
 My nose stung, tears welling in my eyes, but I fired back stubbornly.
 ""So that's why you broke up someone else's family? Are you proud of giving birth to an illegitimate child?""
 She took a sip of coffee, her expression condescending: ""No, they're not illegitimate children. They're heirs to a wealthy family.""
 ""Even if you scheme your way into a rich family, you can't change your base bloodline. How could Benjamin let you bear heirs? Don't delude yourself.""
 ""He and I are a perfect match – destined for each other!""
 I knew illegitimate children had inheritance rights, but I never imagined Benjamin would go so far as to name Sophia's children heirs this early.
 Is this how he sees my devotion—just a scheme to get his family fortune?
 Sophia looked at my crestfallen expression with a malicious grin, dropped the folder on the table, and left.
 ""I'm young, beautiful, and carrying his child. You saw how Benjamin treats me.
 Even if you refuse to divorce, you'll get nothing from the Johnsons. Why waste your time fighting me?""
 I blinked away the tears gathering at my lashes, forcing myself to endure the bitterness as I opened the folder.
 Inside were two copies of a divorce agreement—
 both bearing Benjamin's signature.
 Benjamin once vowed never to leave me. Even after I discovered his affair, he never mentioned divorce.
 Though I didn’t know how Sophia tricked him into signing these papers,
 I knew one thing for certain: I needed them.
 But seeing the clause that would leave me with nothing, I still trembled with anger.
 What right did Sophia, a mistress, have to demand I leave with nothing?!
 Stepping off the flight back home, I gradually calmed down and contacted my lawyer. I drafted a new divorce agreement, photographed it, and sent it to Benjamin.
 ""Sign in person or fax it?""
 Finally, Benjamin's first call came through.
 ""Stop using divorce as a threat. I'm busy now—we'll talk later.""
 Remembering him laughing with the children, my voice dripped with sarcasm:
 ""Oh? So this time, are you busy fathering a son or a daughter?""
Chapter 4
Chapter 4
 His conciliatory tone vanished instantly, replaced by a cold sneer:
 ""Is this how your parents raised you? Go apologize to my mother immediately and learn about Following husband, or we divorce now!""
 He hung up.
 I returned home to find Sophia and her two children gathered harmoniously around my parents-in-law.
 Sophia affectionately looped her arm through my mother-in-law's, shooting me a look of unmistakable malice:
 ""Miss Sophia, I've never seen anyone discuss projects in someone else's home.""
 Her son frowned at me: ""Auntie, why didn't you knock? That's not polite at all.""
 My mother-in-law watched me coldly—I knew this was her way of showing displeasure.
 ""Aren't you getting a divorce? Why bother our family?""
 That unfamiliar sternness on her face pierced my heart, sending waves of intense pain through me.
 I set my suitcase in the living room center and walked upstairs alone.
 ""Sorry.""
 ""I'll just pack my things and leave. Won't interfere with your family reunion dinner.""
 The elderly man tapped his cane on the floor, his voice low: ""Benjamin's already on his flight home. Don't be difficult. You know how well he's treated you all these years.""
 Suddenly, the little boy burst into tears: ""Is she gonna steal Daddy? Will Mommy, me, and my sister get kicked out?""
 The little girl wailed in unison. Grandfather and grandmother's faces instantly softened with concern, gathering both children into their arms.
 ""Of course not! This is your home with Mommy and Daddy. Who'd dare make you leave?!""
 The boy cried so hard he choked, coughing twice.
 Grandmother patted his back gently before whirling toward me: ""Causing trouble the moment you step foot here! Olivia, did you come specifically to bring misfortune to this family?""
 ""You made my son choose to be DINK, and now you want to drive away my grandchildren! Get out of the Carter estate!""
 Grandfather sighed, holding the little girl, and remained silent.
 I looked around. My father-in-law's walking stick was one I'd chosen the finest wood for and hand-carved bit by bit for him years ago.
 My mother-in-law's bracelet was something I'd specially knelt to have a master bless for protection.
 Yet now, they were all surrounding Sophia in the middle, glaring coldly at me.
 Instantly, everything in this house where I'd lived for six years felt so unfamiliar.
 Forget it, there's nothing worth taking anyway.
 But as I picked up my suitcase and headed out, Benjamin pushed the door open and snatched the suitcase from my hand.
 ""It's just that I didn't give you a child, but I've already given you the title of Mrs. Carter, what more do you want?""
 ""Just get along well with Sophia, I'll take care of the rest.""
 The boy who had just calmed down burst into tears again: ""Daddy doesn't want us anymore, Daddy wants to be with this woman, wuwuwu~""
 Benjamin instantly let go of my hand and ran over to the boy to comfort him softly.
 The baby kicked my suitcase out the door, scattering divorce papers across the floor.
 His expression hardened as he scanned the documents: ""Must you cause trouble now? I told you the Johnson family can afford to keep you.""
 I silently flipped to specific pages:
 ""I claim no marital assets, but the jewelry, cars, and properties you gifted me during our courtship are pre-marital property. I'm taking them legally.""
 ""Sign now,"" I stated coldly, ""or both your children won't be able to register.""
 Benjamin's eyes flickered with unease as he pulled me outside, whispering: ""Leave first. Let me calm the children and Sophia before—""
 ""Sign it."" I thrust the papers into his hand, dusting off my copy. ""We have no 'before' or 'after'.""
 He stared at the divorce agreement, knuckles whitening around the pen.
 I couldn't help but laugh mockingly at my own words.
 ""Though you can handle it, why stir up ugly rumors about having an illegitimate child with your mistress, right?""
 He calmed down, studying me intently: ""You're sure about giving up being Mrs. Johnson? Seriously?""

1mavclg,https://www.reddit.com/r/ShadCanada/comments/1mavclg/my_experience_at_shad_western/,My experience at Shad Western,"First, I would like to thank everyone for such an amazing month! definitely not biased but I would say Western is one of the best campuses!

Here's my experience at Shad Western 2025 and to the future Shads why YOU should put Western as your A choice!

1. The PAs were AMAZING, they were caring, kind, funny. Most of them are 06 so they really felt like another SHAD to me, more than a PA. A lot of them also attended SHAD so they know how to impress us and they did! PAs really made Shad a more memorable experience.
2. The lectures and workshops are quite good, some are great, some are just mid. The speakers really tried to make it interactive and I saw a lot of people enjoying it!
3. Good things and bad things about the dorm, we stayed in suite style rooms, 2 people per room, 2 rooms share a bathroom. Fortunately I got good roommate and suite mates, we all didn't make ourselves troublesome and kept the place clean. There's definitely enough space inside the rooms to store all your stuff, however the beds were bad, I barely slept on the first night and was averaging 5-6 hours of sleep every night. They are proper beds but it makes a very loud noise everytime you move, even if you move 1 inch. The food was good, a lot of drink options including coffee and tea as well, fruits and salad bar every meal and FANTASTIC desserts everyday. The lounges were good, gym was mid with not a lot of equipments, the laundry room DID NOT have enough machines though. Perth Hall will forever hold a special place in my heart, the rooms, the cafeteria, the lounges, I love perth hall!!!
4. Freedom wise, we could only go out during meal time starting in the second week if I remembered it correctly. And freedom to go out at night (other than meal times) in the last 3 days, but only to the plaza. It was nice going out for walks after dinner.
5. I would say the cohort is the only downside to the program, there's too many people, lining up for food, waiting for laundry machines, delaying in schedules because people decided to disappear at roll call etc. A lot of people already knew each other before the program and a lot of cliques were forming which made it a little bit harder to fit in especially if you are not extroverted. On the last day, I can see everyone found their own friend group and I'm very happy for that. Honestly, 131 shads is too many, it's too hard to control the group, my experience would've been better if there were less people. 
6. The program was amazing, we visited quite a lot of buildings during the program, it wasn't as intense as people said, because we do get a lot of free time. Some days it can be quite rushed with only 15 mins for lunch cause of the long line and schedule, but it was definitely worth it. I really liked camping and rec time, they were great times to bond with each other. The excursions were also amazing, really enjoyed the bus rides!

Thank you SHAD Western for an unforgettable month, it was sad seeing people leave on the last day and probably not able to them again cause they live across the country, and I really hope to study at Western in the future! Now I wake up every morning hoping there will be roll call again, hoping I would have house time and design time again, hoping there would be curfew again......",5,1753644870.0,ShadCanada,2,1.0,False
1mavbwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mavbwe/does_the_elite_gourmet_4cup_coffee_maker_deliver/,Does the Elite Gourmet 4-Cup Coffee Maker Deliver on Value and Quality?,"The Elite Gourmet EHC4128 has become my go-to coffee maker for more days than I can count. This handy little machine doesn't just sit on my counter; it performs a daily ritual of concocting my much-needed morning fuel. Its compact size and simple, modern look make it ideal for my small kitchen, though I can also see it fitting perfectly in a dorm room, office space, or even an RV during weekend getaways. It’s far from a high-tech luxury machine, but it delivers just what it promises: functionality, reliability, and some great-tasting coffee.

**Sleek Compact Design Perfect for Smaller Spaces**  
One of the main reasons I got the Elite Gourmet EHC4128 was to save precious counter space. Measuring just 8 inches deep, 9 inches wide, and 6 inches high, it's compact enough to tuck away but attractive enough to leave on display. The glossy black finish complements its modern style, blending well with other appliances in my kitchen. While it’s minimal in aesthetics, it doesn't feel cheaply made, and the glass carafe adds an elegant touch.

**Convenient Features for the Everyday Coffee Routine**  
If you’re like me and need your coffee as quickly as possible in the morning, the Pause N Serve feature is a game changer. Mid-brew, I’ve been able to sneak a cup without waiting for the cycle to finish, something my previous machine didn’t allow. It’s like this coffee maker understands my desperate, pre-caffeinated state. Additionally, the keep-warm function, triggered as brewing completes, ensures my second cup is still nice and hot when I return for a refill. 

**Check Elite Gourmet EHC4128 price on Amazon.**

**Reusable Filter and Environmental Impact**  
The reusable filter included with this coffee maker has been both a cost-saver and an eco-friendly bonus. Instead of going through countless paper cone filters, I simply clean the detachable basket after each use. This feature was unexpected at such an affordable price point yet has proven to be one of my favorite aspects. The filter itself is easy to handle, though a finer grind of coffee sometimes causes some grounds to sneak into the brew—something to keep in mind if you’re picky about those final sips.

**Performance in Brewing: Simplicity at Its Best**  
While this isn’t the fanciest machine out there, its drip brewing method results in surprisingly good coffee. With a water reservoir that holds up to four cups, it’s perfect for personal or small-group consumption. The water level indicator ensures no accidental overflows, and the operation is straightforward with just an on/off switch. Brew time is quick enough that I never find myself impatiently tapping my foot.

**Merits**  
- Compact design fits tight spaces easily  
- Pause N Serve feature for mid-brew convenience  
- Reusable filter reduces waste and cost  
- Keep-warm function maintains ideal coffee temperature  

**Negatives**  
- Coffee grounds occasionally escape the reusable filter  
- Plastic components could feel sturdier  

**Peer Products**  
Compared to similarly sized coffee makers, this one holds its ground quite well. For instance, common rivals like the Black+Decker 4-Cup and Mr. Coffee Simple Brew models share similar functionality but often lack standout features like the Pause N Serve or the keep-warm function of the EHC4128. While machines from brands like Keurig offer pod-based convenience, they can’t match the cost efficiency and environmental consciousness of using your own ground coffee with this Elite machine. That said, the slightly flimsier plastic parts might put it at a disadvantage for those looking for long-term endurance.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Talking about value for its features, this coffee maker punches above its weight. While there are other budget-friendly options, the addition of clever tools like the Pause N Serve and the reusable filter tip the scales in its favor. It doesn’t pretend to compete with high-end espresso or specialty coffee machines, but for an everyday drip coffee machine, it’s incredibly cost-effective.

Today I woke up in a great mood. I decided to make a run to dunkin and get me an iced coffee to start my day.  

Now, I live in Chicago.  If you all are familiar with cities like Chicago, and live in an overpopulated neighborhood with permit parking signs everywhere, then you’ll probably understand this experience.

Anyway, I pull up back home and surprisingly there’s a lot of parking.  I noticed that the new neighbor is already parked, and he’s getting groceries out his truck. I park in front of him, but just enough to be right in front of my house (I have security cameras and obviously took the rare opportunity to park right across my house).

I get out my vehicle and the neighbor suddenly says: “hey, I have a question for you”. 

I respond: “what’s up?”
He says: “don’t you think it’d be best to pull up a little forward to leave space for another car to be able to park behind you? (Remember, I’m parked in front of him, and yes there is a small space left between my vehicle and his. I believe they call this double parking out here)

I respond: “well, I parked here to be able to see my vehicle on my security cameras.
He proceeds by saying: “i understand, but i don’t think you moving a little more forward would interfere with the camera angle.”

I was thrown so off guard. Mainly because I didn’t intentionally park the way I did, just to purposely take two parking spots.  There was a lot more room in front of me. And yeah I could have easily moved forward, to not hog up two parking spaces. 

But no.  I didn’t move.  Not sure who he thinks he is.  I just stared at him with a straight (ha, yeah ok) type face, and walked towards my house.  I didn’t bother responding, I didn’t move my vehicle, nor will I move it the entire day.  

Honestly, he also had space behind him.  If he cared so much about leaving space for someone else to park, he could have easily backed up and left a more open parking space.  

I’m still pissed at the fact that he thought he was gonna talk me into “being a good civilian” by moving my vehicle forward.  I could have escalated the situation, but it would be a stupid and trivial reason to even do so.   

That’s all.

Hi ere thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve had no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know.

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.

nothing dramatic happened. i forgot the ketchup at first, he waved it off like it was nothing. asked me how long i’d worked here and if we got free meals. just simple questions.

he eats, finishes his coffee, thanks me again and heads up to the register. total was like $18.

hands me his card, then pulls a wad of cash from his coat pocket. “for you,” he says. i thought it was maybe a five or ten. didn’t want to be weird so i just thanked him and wished him a good day.

i get to the back and count it later. it’s $60.

i stood there staring at it for a full minute trying to figure out if it was a mistake. checked the receipt. nothing on the card tip line. just the cash.

i don’t know what that was about. maybe he had a good day. maybe he just liked the vibe. maybe he could tell i’d been running on empty all week and just wanted to make someone’s day feel a little lighter.

either way, i won’t forget it. not because of the money, but because it was so quiet and simple and weirdly kind. no speech, no “you deserve this,” just… here.

1mav5cp,https://www.reddit.com/r/objectum_sfw/comments/1mav5cp/is_my_love_for_a_building_ironic_or_an_actual/,Is my love for a building ironic or an actual form of attachment?,"This is not a question, and instead a title to a post that I feel like would be on tiktok with subway surfers gameplay underneath. Writing this on an alt cause im ashamed, I think, not sure.

Anyways, here is the story.

I am a person who is neurodivergent. I’m not saying autistic specifically cause I am not diagnosed for that, but, I am medically neurodivergent. Through out my life it’s been hard for me to get attached to real people. I’ve always been more close to fictional characters and such because I feel like I am able to project onto them, thus, understand them more in my own way. 

Because of this, I’ve always considered myself Aromantic and Asexual. I don’t really feel attracted to the human body. To me its strange to think that there are people out there who look at the human form and actually feel something out of it. The physical / sexual aspect of attraction aside, I don’t really feel emotionally attracted like I said. I’ve dated two people, but I didn’t feel attraction even then. It was more like having friends that I really cared about. I Did feel “attraction” to a few random strangers, but even then It was only because I felt their personality was cool and maybe their apperance was pretty enough to make me go “wow”. Not something I’d feel actually excited or pleased by. Again, if I did end up dating them my possible attraction would fade away.

So I stuck to the Aro/Ace spec label and fully stepped out of the dating scene. Cause I wouldn’t be a great partner anyway.

I feel closer to fictional characters like I said. They feel like a part of my identity. I feel closer to them then actual humans. This steps into the fictional character attraction side of it, which I am cultured enough to know isn’t the same thing as objectum.

But, recently I realized something.

There was a reddit post for a game about a character who is a faceless humanoid robot. Post was like, “How do people even feel attracted to him??” I decided to give a heartfelt response. And then it hit me.

The characters that I feel “attracted” to, are always somewhat object or inhumane. Whether they are faceless, a concept, a robot, mechanic, eldrich being, whatever. I Also just like robots and more non-human characters a lot more. Like some of my favourite characters I’ve been attached to are literal stickfigures.

Ok, this is ficto-loving, why am I on r/Objectum?

Let’s get into the title.

I’ve been going out on walks and found a new cool place to sit at. It’s quiet, theres a park, I go and grab a coffee to sit at a bench with the street cats. I also brought my friend there a few times, for the fun of it.

Across the bench we usually sit at… there is a skyscraper. I live in a big city, so there are plenty of them.

But this one… this one actually makes me feel something.

I Would share a picture of it but I don’t really wanna doxx myself (even if I am in a big city). So I’ll just describe it.

It’s a tall, concrete building that is in rectangular shape. A regular one for offices. There are a few smaller sections below the main rectangle in shapes of squares below it that are assymetrical, presenting a great sillhouette. The building itself is gray and the panels are navy blue. A color combo that is very satisfying to me. There are some trees and greenary on the floors, so the pop of green adds to it. 

Something about it is just so… comforting to me. As a joke I’ve been calling them “The Vic Tower(s)” (there is another one nearby identical to it). Because the colors of it remind me of a fictional character I like who is also gray / blue. I don’t know if its just… I like the architechture of it. But the way the sunlight casts upon it during sunset… the way it looks so much different at night. 


I just feel attached. Like, its so stupid. Not romantically, I think. I wouldn’t marry it or idk get sexual pleasure (If you do that’s totally cool). I just like it. A lot. I don’t think I’ve ever liked a building this much anymore. Do I like it solely because it reminds me of that ficitonal character? Or do I like it cause I think its such a nice building?

Idk Im lost. It feels weird. I was joking about it with my friend on how I “loved” it, but now I’m looking back and asking myself If I actually do. Or am I just too neurodivergent and cant tell if im joking or actually feeling something.

Probably the latter.

1mav557,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1mav557/david_splane_said_he_has_never_seen_so_much_grey/,David Splane said ‘he has never seen so much grey hair at a convention before’ and much more at Glasgow (Special) Convention 2025,"The ‘special’ convention was connected via video link with all other conventions in the Britain Branch territory with approx 65k attending (+7k on zoom) with only 316 baptised (which is less that the WT baptism target formula of 0.5% of attendance - more on this later). Still, Splane found a way to pathetically boast about how they surpassed the target in Glasgow. 


Highlights or in most cases lowlights from his talk:


‘I’ve never been to a convention with so much grey hair’ - whoops awkward…


Doing construction work for WT is sacred service for Jehovah - he gave an example of a brother who is overseeing a KH build. 

Skipping meetings and even abandoning your talk assignment if you’re are an elder is totally fine if you are going to meet a government official to get a certificate for the WT building project. Other brothers should be understanding and step in to help the brother out.

The Governing Body have a target number of baptisms at a convention. 0.5% of attendance. 

Yes he said it and used it to boast how Glasgow has beat this target with 92 baptisms for around 12k attendances. He was boasting how instead of the 58 (half a percent of attendance) they beat the target and got a massive 92 baptisms. He deliberately used the Glasgow baptisms and did not use the total of all conventions which were linked up via video, because if he did it would mean that they actually did not hit the target 🤦🏻‍♂️

For example in Leeds they had only 19 baptisms for a peak attendance of 6,900 inc zoom - this would equate for a laughable 0.27%.  (before someone says they had 9k on Saturday - they over reported by 3k because they forgot to ‘reset’ the streaming count which they admitted to on Sunday)

If you want a real life comparison to the expected baptisms figure - 0.05% and below is how many ppl decide to click on a YouTube advert instead of choosing “Skip”


Jehovah is looking for people. He is using PIMIS. And it plays out like this. He hears a worldly persons prayer. Then the angel is assigned and identifies a PIMI that lives close to the worldly person. The angel arranges for the worldly person and for a PIMI to go to a nearby shop and stand in the exact same queue. And now it is over to the PIMI - but ofc you don’t always preach in these situations (to be fair he did say he was included in this too, but it was a bit of a guilt trip to make you preach unofficially, and he doubled down on this straight away in his next point on contact cards)


He then went on to encouraging everyone to have contact cards handy at all times because they are discreet and you can quickly give them out and the person can put it in their pocket. You should always take advantage of opportunity to preach, to the cashier, at the coffee shop, when shopping etc. - reminder you are a JW 24 hours / day, 7 days / week, so when you’re after work and going shopping you should be distributing contact cards.


He also mentioned that PIMIs have found it super hard to go back to in person ministry. said that Covid taught us to keep to ourselves but maybe now PIMIs are keeping too much to themselves. He acknowledged that for some JWs it literally takes everything they have to muster up the energy to go door knocking but at the same time he did not give any practical advice.


He basically said that you just have to pray to Jehovah and prepare and when you’ve done you just have to “go preach” (he tried to be energetic with how he said it but it didn’t actually work) - there were some audible laughs straight after and a delayed applause. It was quite cringy as you could sense the energy in the audience was - “we don’t like going door to door, stop trying to make us” 🤷🏼‍♂️😂

# Best Glazed Twist Donut 2025: Reviews & Guide

The glazed twist donut, a seemingly simple pastry, holds a significant place in the hearts (and stomachs) of many. This classic treat,characterized by its twisted shape and shimmering glaze,offers a delightful combination of airy dough and sweet coating. Finding the perfect glazed twist donut can be a quest, as variations in recipe, frying technique, and glaze composition dramatically impact the final product. This guide aims to navigate this appetizing landscape, providing reviews and insights to help you discover the best glazed twist donut in 2025.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a top-tier glazed twist donut hinges on several critical factors.These features, ranging from dough quality to glaze consistency, determine the overall sensory experience and distinguish exceptional donuts from mediocre ones.

**Dough Texture:** Achieving the ideal dough texture is paramount. It should be light and airy, exhibiting a subtle chewiness without being overly dense or tough.The internal structure of the donut must be well-developed, showcasing numerous small air pockets that create a delicate, melt-in-your-mouth sensation. Overmixing the dough leads to a dense, rubbery texture, while undermixing results in a crumbly, dry donut. The best glazed twist donuts strike a harmonious balance, offering a pleasant resistance and a soft, yielding interior.

**Shape and Appearance:** The twisted design is not merely aesthetic; it contributes to the overall eating experience. The twists and turns create variations in surface area, providing more opportunities for the glaze to adhere and creating delightful textural contrasts.

A well-formed twist donut should maintain its shape during frying, exhibiting distinct, evenly spaced twists. Avoid donuts that appear misshapen, flattened, or overly greasy, as these are indicators of improper technique or poor-quality dough. A visually appealing donut enhances the anticipation and enjoyment of the first bite.**Glaze Consistency and Flavor:** The glaze is the crowning glory of this treat. It should possess a smooth, even consistency, coating the donut without being excessively thick or sticky.

the glaze should create a distinct, satisfying ""snap"" when bitten into, indicative of a well-formulated sugar syrup. The flavor should be sweet but not cloying,offering a balanced profile that complements the dough without overpowering it. Subtle nuances, such as hints of vanilla or maple, can elevate the glaze to new heights.

**Freshness and Aroma:** The freshness of a donut is directly correlated to its taste and texture. A freshly made glazed twist donut exudes a captivating aroma, a blend of yeasty dough, caramelized sugar, and warm spices.The aroma should be inviting and indicative of the donut's overall quality. A stale donut, on the other hand, will lack this characteristic fragrance and may exhibit a slightly cardboard-like or oily odor. Always opt for donuts that appear freshly made and have a pleasant, enticing aroma.

**Grease Content:** The amount of grease absorbed during frying significantly impacts the donut's overall appeal. An excessively greasy donut can be heavy and unappetizing, leaving an unpleasant aftertaste.

Ideally, a glazed twist donut should be relatively dry to the touch, exhibiting minimal visible grease. Proper frying techniques, such as maintaining the correct oil temperature and avoiding overcrowding the fryer, can minimize grease absorption. look for donuts that are golden brown and have a slightly crisp exterior, indicating they were fried correctly.

## Core Benefits

The glazed twist donut offers a multitude of benefits,ranging from its convenient format to its comforting flavor profile. Its widespread appeal is rooted in its accessibility, affordability, and the simple joy it brings to everyday moments.

**Instant Gratification:** Glazed twist donuts provide a fast and easy way to satisfy a sweet craving. Their portable nature and readily available format make them an ideal snack for on-the-go consumption. A single donut can offer a momentary escape from the stresses of daily life,providing a boost of sugar and a surge of dopamine.

**Comfort Food Classic:** the glazed twist donut occupies a special place in the realm of comfort food. Its familiar flavor and satisfying texture evoke feelings of nostalgia and contentment. Whether enjoyed with a cup of coffee in the morning or as an afternoon treat, this classic pastry embodies a sense of warmth and simplicity.

**Affordable Indulgence:** Compared to many other desserts and pastries, glazed twist donuts represent an affordable indulgence. Their reasonable price point makes them accessible to a wide range of consumers, allowing for a guilt-free treat without breaking the bank. This combination of affordability and satisfying flavor contributes to their enduring popularity.

**Versatile Treat:** While traditionally enjoyed on their own, glazed twist donuts can also be incorporated into various desserts and snacks. They can be used as a component in donut bread pudding, crushed and sprinkled over ice cream, or even used as a unique base for breakfast sandwiches. This versatility expands their appeal and allows for creative culinary applications.

## FAQs section

Navigating the world of glazed twist donuts can raise a few questions. Here are some common inquiries and their corresponding answers to help you make informed decisions.

**What is the ideal way to store glazed twist donuts?**
To maintain their freshness, store glazed twist donuts in an airtight container at room temperature. Avoid refrigerating them, as this can cause the dough to become dry and stale. Ideally, consume them within 1-2 days for optimal taste and texture.

**Are there any healthier alternatives to traditional glazed twist donuts?**
While glazed twist donuts are undeniably indulgent, some bakeries offer healthier alternatives. These may include using whole-wheat flour, reducing the amount of sugar in the glaze, or baking the donuts instead of frying them. These options can provide a slightly healthier, though often less satisfying, alternative.

**How can I tell if a glazed twist donut is fresh?**
A fresh glazed twist donut will have a soft, yielding texture, a slightly crisp exterior, and a pleasant aroma. Avoid donuts that appear dry, stale, or greasy. The glaze should be smooth and shiny, not cracked or sticky.**What is the best beverage to pair with a glazed twist donut?**
The ideal beverage pairing depends on personal preference, but some classic combinations include coffee, milk, and tea. The bitterness of coffee or tea can complement the sweetness of the donut, while milk provides a creamy, comforting contrast. Ultimately, the best pairing is the one that you enjoy the most.

1mauzue,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGreatestFool/comments/1mauzue/disconnected/,Disconnected,"I find myself so disconnected while growing up in the millennial generation. I didn't grow up like the rest of everyone around me. 

I had close to no friends in school, everyone had a phone by 6th grade. 
Me? By my first year of high school.
When I grew up. I didn't understand anyone my age.
Alcohol tastes really bad, coffee tastes really bad. I didn't understand parties or hooking up.
I learned from a by gone generation.
No one is traditional anymore.
The only people who understand me are all younger than 13 years old. And older then 40.
At least when I go to the kids tables, we can all agree adults suck, and we should be able to eat candy 24/7.
And no one at the table is obsessed with drinking alcohol. Win win. Those are my bros. 

And being the fool I am, for all I can understand, I understand Nothing and or everything. Understanding and learning about the perspective of others, I can see them as a way of life, but they don't become me, because of so many ways to live life, I can only pick one, and my brain in hardwired already with the mind of a hopeless romantic and a eternal philosopher.
Also known as... A Fool.
Being a expanded mind, full of all these ideas and thoughts, I fit in with no one almost, other philosophers I suppose, or others with deep emotions, love and  thoughts.

My friend Kate, our deep emotions connected us.
Moonlight was the same.
September more our thoughts. She is a philosopher like me.
A logic philosopher, my favorite.
She has all the answers.

I fit in with the kids here and there. We all hate adults. And they aren't in a rush to grow up, or so I tell them not to be.

When I go to work in the morning. Almost everyone is on there phones.
It's interesting to see. And I'm the only one looking around or out the window.
Is everyone but me addicted?
Well no.
It's an efficient use of time. To talk with friends, listen to music, or a podcast. Check on Friends or what not. but it is interesting to see.

I'm disconnected from many things.
I don't understand all the fighting in todays age. Can't we all sit down and talk like adults or something.
I'm to tired to yell. So I won't, but I stay away from all the infighting.
Be kind to everyone, that's the rule. 

I was disconnected from my heart for the longest time. 
That sucker would make all the decisions without me. Falling in love left and right.

Disconnected from time.
Sometimes days feel like seconds.
And years feel like days.
And few are the strangest moments that feel like an eternity.

I'm disconnected from my family.
My friends mean more to me.
As much as I love my family. They are second to my friends.

I'm disconnected from the sky above me.
My feet never leave the earth. The sky always towards to unreachable heavens.
I feel like I was once connected to the sky.
That bright baby blue feels apart of me.

And at times I even feel disconnected from the world. And something or someone calls to me from the other side.
Whispering to me to come home.

But right now. I'm connected to you.
The words you read are the same words I have written. All the words you have read so have I. We are disconnected and connected all the time. We've breathed the same air, we've looked at the same sky, the same moon. The same sun has shined on us. And we are both using the same site.
Connections everywhere.

Connections are a sad thing to think about.
If you can be connected, you can be separated. 
We might hold a dear friend or love in our arms. So it means that one day we will have to let go.

1mauzlv,https://i.redd.it/9leq4jrvvgff1.png,Advanced Economy – Trade Routes – Caravans,"# ☁Fog of war☁

To give every kingdom/republic/empire/trade union/city-state a ""fog of war"", so it can only be in contact with kingdoms that are already discovered and only if they have common sea/road etc, and only then they can actually send messages to each other. That would solve a problem of ""strange alliences"" and ""strange wars"" that occurs now when two civs that doesn't know about eachoter spontaneously ally/declare war on eachother.  
If you're in favor of this feature, but don't feel like reading the rest, simply [support it with your vote](https://ideabox.featureupvote.com/suggestions/582911/advanced-economy-trade-routes-caravans).

# ⛏️ New resource system ⛏️

To assign (or make player decide) finite resource to every biome and make kingdoms from one biome need resources from the other and some of them would do need it more desperately than the others

For example let's say we have one kingdom 🎃 in savanna biom, one in 🤠 jungle and one in the 🐧 desert.

Hypothetical situation:

🎃 produces wheat and beer, 🤠 produces berries and coffee, 🐧 produces gold and spices.

🐧 doesn't produce food, which means it has to import it, which means it has to either play the diplomacy with one of the kingdoms, or declare war on one of the kingdoms to gain the land that would be capable of producing food.

🎃 Doesn't produce gold, which means it has to import it for the easier trade inside of itself (currency), and (let's say it's a big empire) it's subjects are quite fancy and they like a cuppa coffee every now and then and can't imagine their beers without masala (for some reason).

When subjects of 🎃 doesn't get what they want, they become reasonably upset and demand to overthrow the government (and possibly seize the means of production), so while 🤠 and 🐧 has an option not to trade with 🐧, it desperately needs their resources to keep afloat.

Notably, if there would be some fourth kingdom that could offer some of these resources, then 🤠 and 🐧 would be weakened because of it, and it would be within their interest to declare war on the whatever country dared to invade their trade operations.

🐧 would be harmed especially badly as without trade with 🎃 it would had no alternative but to trade with 🤠, which would lead to the monopoly on the resource, and 🤠 would be able to export more of gold and spices out of 🐧 for less food, and then use same gold and spices to trade with 🎃, and eventually get enough resources to fully conquer the 🐧, or make it it's puppet.

# 💰Influence of the map on the trade💰

It's an Era of Ice and sea trades are frozen and some islands are now has to find out how to be self sufficient and balance of power drastically changes, as trade unions loses their power and influence and big governmental structures that seems more reliable gain power.

Or let's take mix with the previous example, there only 🎃, 🤠, and 🐧 (E) (extra country).  
🎃 is connected to 🐧 with a river that goes through (E) territories. Those territories are next to 🤠 territories. 🤠 Declares war on E and get's it's land, including the river. Then 🤠 doesn't let through the ships from both sides, which gives 🤠 economical advantage that we've discussed earlier.  
It would be an interesting decision because it would lead to military alliance between 🐧 and 🎃 to end economical exploitation.  
Just imagine having ""War for the end of an economical exploitation"", instead of ""War of blood"" that we have now.

That would be great if every war on the map would had a casus belli and a legitimate reason to attack. As for now they're just fighting for the land that might even be empty.

# 🐫Trade routes and caravans🐫

Bandits now are just an aggressive mob and they have no structural purpose. With trade routes and caravans they would be a significant complication and cities would have to arm their caravans with legions/regiments/guards in order to secure safe trade.  
That also opens an opportunity for little bandit/pirаte civs located on the island for the sea trade and in the dens for the land trade. And then it opens even more opportunity for the big empires to negotiate with pirаte civs to hire corsairs.

Sea trade would also mean that we'd have to have more types of ships, some for transportation of goods, other for protection.  
And finally the roads.

I believe it'd be beneficial to differ those roads that are within cities, from those that are connecting the cities, from those that are connecting kingdoms.  
Each road would have 3 tiers of efficiency.

Towns and cities are responsible for the roads within itself, and they has to import resources from the other cities within kingdom to upgrade them.  
Roads between cities are the same as the roads in the capital, as it's federal/king's area of competence.  
And roads between kingdoms would also depend on the capital, but only within some reasonable range.

Terrified of seeing Jackson happy with someone else.

He had a girlfriend. They held hands in public. They posted pictures in matching scarves. They kissed like they belonged to each other.

And I?

I was just a childhood friend. The ghost of an emotion that never got a name. The one who helped him with math homework and folded his PE uniform when he forgot. The one who watched his first kiss happen with someone else and smiled like it didn’t kill him.

Jackson didn’t know.

Of course, he didn’t.

Because I never told him.

So I lied. I said I wanted to explore, to see the world. I said America would be good for me. That morning, when he came to the airport, hair still damp, eyes still kind, I almost broke.

“Are you really going?” he asked.

I nodded.

He looked down. “You’ll forget about us soon.”

I laughed.

And I hated myself for it.

Because the truth was, I was leaving to forget him. And I already knew I couldn’t.

He hugged me tight. I almost said it. The words sat on my tongue like broken glass.

But instead, I boarded the plane.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **D.C. United vs. New England Revolution: A Tale of Two Teams (One Desperate, One Just… Less Desperate)**

Let’s cut to the chase: D.C. United is the sports equivalent of a group project where everyone forgot to show up except the guy who spent 20 minutes arguing about the font size. They’ve lost six of their last ten home games, their fans are chanting “Sell the team!” like it’s a clearance event at a discount store, and their interim coach is stuck in a visa limbo that makes you wonder if bureaucracy itself is their real opponent. Meanwhile, the New England Revolution? They’re the “meh, okay” of MLS—a team that’s not winning championships but also not setting fire to your TV. Let’s break this down with math, mockery, and a sprinkle of hope.

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The bookmakers have New England as a slight favorite (-0.5 spread) with decimal odds of 2.21 (implied probability: \~45.25%), while D.C. United is the underdog at 3.22 (\~31.06%). The draw sits at 3.26 (\~30.68%), which suggests bookies think this could be a gritty, low-scoring affair. The total goals line is 2.5, with even money on over/under—so expect a game where scoring is as rare as a D.C. United clean sheet (which, honestly, might be a thing of legend).

### Team News: Injuries, Instability, and Visa Drama

D.C. United’s woes are the stuff of modern MLS folklore. They’ve lost six straight at home, their offense is a coffee shop in a drought (“We’re out of shots, sorry”), and their defense? Well, their last four games have seen 14 goals conceded. Interim coach Kevin Flanagan is like a guest DJ at a party—keeps the music going but no one’s sure if they’ll stick around after the next song. And let’s not forget René Weiler’s visa is moving at the speed of a text message from a busy CEO.

Lately (especially this summer), I’ve felt extremely lonely in the relationship.

I’ve tried suggesting things to do together, going for a walk, having a picnic, seeing a movie, going out to eat, literally anything to spend some quality time. He always says no, acts annoyed, or says “maybe later” and then goes straight back to his computer.

It’s been months since we’ve done anything just the two of us. I work a lot, but on my days off, I try to plan things. He never wants to join.

Meanwhile, most of my female friends are busy with kids or their partners, so I’ve been hanging out occasionally with a male friend. We’ve gone swimming, grabbed coffee, gone for walks. Nothing romantic has happened, and I’m not interested in him that way, I just needed someone to talk to and do things with.

Now my boyfriend is upset and says it’s “disrespectful” for me to hang out with another guy. He says it makes him uncomfortable and that I should prioritize him. But I honestly feel like I have prioritized him, I just get nothing back.

So, AITA for spending time with another guy when my boyfriend refuses to do anything with me?

EDIT for clarity: I’ve communicated with my boyfriend several times that I feel lonely and that I wish we could spend more time together. Nothing has changed.

TL;DR:
My boyfriend never wants to spend time with me or do anything fun together, so I’ve started hanging out with a male friend (non-romantic) instead. Now my boyfriend is mad. AITA?",5,1753643884.0,AITAH,32,0.86,False

A few years ago I went back to university and over the past year or so I've fallen for a F30 in my class. We're quite use to chatting with each other and although we don't message often when we do the messages go on for a couple of hours.

There's four of us who hangout together regularly me, my crush, and two more members of the class. The four of us went out for lunch on Thursday. We had a really good time and then had coffee and cake before saying goodbye at the station. I knew another friend of mine F39 was in the area with her daughter and she told me when you finish lunch hit me up and maybe we can hangout. 

I texted my friend and by chance she was at the same station. I met her and walked to the platform as we were going the same way. As we got onto the platform my crush was there, so I did the polite thing and introduced everyone. I had a very quick conversation with my crush before she got on her train. She asked where we were all going. I told her what station I was going to and said my friend and her daughter would change to get on another line in a few stops. I asked where my crush was going and she told me, she then wished me a good holiday (I'm away for nearly a month from Wednesday.)

When I got home I dropped a message on a group we're all on saying how great it was to see everyone. My crush was slow to react but she hearted the message and said she felt the same. 

Over the last few days a few messages have been posted in the group but my crush hasn't commented or reacted to any of them, which is completely out of character for her but I know she's read them. I've now got it in my head that she was jealous that I was with my friend but I know I'm probably overthinking that.

I really want to message her but not sure what to say. We don't normally text and say how are you etc.., its normally for a specific purpose, although we normally find something to talk to about like a TV show she recommended I watch or she'll text and ask me about a book I've read. 

The question is what should I do, text her about something and gauge her reaction or leave it and wait for her to text me or something to come up in the group?

There was a huge funnel cloud of bees; the yard was full of them and they were everywhere. I was a little confused because I hadn't seen queen cells or any sign of swarming last week. They bivouacked about 70 feet high in the neighbor's eucalyptus tree, and I wrote them off as a lost asset. I hadn't requeened them yet, so I wasn't too upset.

It wasn't a swarm. The bees absconded, leaving drawn comb and capped brood behind. No nectar and no honey was present. I knew AHB may do this during a dearth: they'll consume all their stores, than move on to usurp a nearby hive. A postmortem revealed no mites on capped brood, not even drone brood. I didn't see any signs of disease, and they've had a feeder that the haven't touched.

I've had new cut outs and new swarms abscond, but never an established hive. It was extremely impressive and a little disappointing to have happened before my first cup of coffee.

_January 27th, 2021. Twenty kilometers northeast of London._

In a seemingly empty and barren field, a quad-copter hovered in the air. It was an advanced model with blades contained inside circular chambers to lower the volume and make it somewhat stealthy, but its striking appearance did make it stand out more to those who saw it. Luckily, its pilot had taken an especially long and roundabout path to delivers its passengers across the many barren fields lining the landscape of Great Britain, far from the main roads where cars might casually spot its flight path.

The helicopter slowly lowered toward the field below, and at an indeterminate point, it passed through a barrier of energy that revealed the field was not as lifeless as it seemed. A single small concrete structure, barely the size of a park bathroom, stood in the center of the dead, yellowed grass, and a pair of men stood out in front of it, looking up at the descending copter.

After a minute or two, the flying machine finally landed. Another minute passed before a hatch opened up, revealing stairs that lowered to the ground. A well dressed man flanked by two bodyguards wearing tactical gear and sunglasses stepped off the quad-copter and made their way across the field.

The man in the business suit was relatively ordinary looking. He wasn't particularly handsome, but he had a notable air of charisma hidden behind his eyes. He had pale blonde hair, and it was quite thin, likely because he combed it over a bald spot that stubbornly grew bigger and bigger every year. He had sworn many times that if it became any worse, he would definitely shave his head, but the _voters_ wouldn't like seeing such a drastic change in his image. Or at least, that's the reason he gave himself to continually deny the slow and unstoppable advancement of age.

""Prime Minister Sheldon."" One of the two men near the concrete structure said, as the politician walked toward them. ""It's a pleasure to finally introduce you to our little operation.""

This first man who spoke wore a plaid shirt and beige dress jeans. His large and clunky glasses, coupled with his slightly slouched posture, gave him the air of a middle manager. Sheldon assessed his figure immediately and assessed he was not the Person of Interest he had come to meet. That must instead be the man beside him.

Sheldon held out his hand and warmly shook the man's hand. He knew how to smile and play the part of a caring official. He'd done it a million times.

""And you are?"" Sheldon asked.

""Sorry, I should have led with that, sir."" The man said, chuckling awkwardly. ""I'm Oliver Ward, Senior of Personnel Management at Blacksite 41. This young man beside me is our leading scientist, Edward Greer.""

The moment Noah Sheldon's eyes fell on Edward's face, he sensed an aura even more formidable than his own. The charming young man, perhaps twenty-eight years of age, was nearing the prime of his life. He had a full head of blonde hair, a smile that would stun supermodels, and he wore a well-fitting dress shirt and tie. Everything about the man screamed 'future superstar.' If he ran for political office, he would become someone truly great.

""Edward! So you're the man whose name has been reaching my ears of late!"" Sheldon exclaimed, his eyes visibly brightening. He clapped his hand into Edward's palm and grinned enviously at the handsome fellow blinding him with his superior aura. ""I can't believe a guy as good-looking as you has put so many of the U.K.'s greatest nerds to shame! Can't you let some of your lessers have a taste of the spotlight?""

""Oh, I can't take all the credit,"" Edward said with a shameful wink. ""It is a 'team effort' after all. Many brilliant men and women have contributed, including my fiance. Come on inside. We have everything prepared.""

The group of three men and two bodyguards walked over to the building, which only had one door. It opened to reveal a service elevator leading deep into the planet's depths.

After they shut the door, the elevator spun up and began lowering them down at a surprisingly brisk pace. Sheldon almost immediately opted to ignore Oliver, the middle manager, to focus on Edward, whose star was far too bright to allow lesser men to compete.

""So, tell me about what's going on down here."" Sheldon said. ""I glanced through a few reports, but the bureaucratic wording... it can be a bit dry!""

""Dry indeed. I'll do my best not to bore you!"" Edward chirped. ""Here at Blacksite 41, we are focused on researching a certain 'exotic recovered object' that was imported from the United States. This object stumped countless leading scientists in the USA, until a team of people, led by me, managed to pass a qualifying test designed to prove we were capable of unlocking its secrets.""

Edward continued. ""As such, this site is partially funded by the USA, but to maintain relations, we have made sure that half of the funding comes from our government here as well.""

""Good, good. Can't be having the Yanks eat up all the good stuff."" Sheldon replied. ""And this recovered... object. What is it, exactly? I didn't find a single mention of it in the files I was given, only vague descriptions. That's why I came here; to assess whether funding this Blacksite is truly in our country's interests.""

Edward's smile vanished. In its place, a much more solemn and serious expression followed.

""Prime Minister. Under no circumstances can our great nation afford to defund this site. The 'object' in question is of such an advanced origin that it poses a threat to the entire planet. If another country were to take control of the object, it would be a catastrophic loss for us.""

Sheldon blinked. He looked at Edward's face with surprise... and a hint of wariness.

""You believe it is that important?""

""I would rather die than allow it to leave our custody."" Edward replied, his solemness even more stark than before. ""I believe... it is _alien_ in origin.""

The elevator stopped, revealing a short hallway leading into an underground warehouse with shock troopers wearing heavy armor of an advanced type Sheldon had never seen before. He blinked twice when he saw the first two men flanking both sides of the entry corridor, coldly assessing him as a potential threat. It didn't matter if he was the Prime Minister; he still registered as a potential hostile in their eyes, and they gripped their rifles tighter when he and the others approached.

Once Sheldon passed by and nothing happened, he felt an odd sense of relief. ""Those men felt... intense.""

""Security is extremely tight down here. You can't see it, but you're being scanned by numerous systems to assess whether or not you are... human."" Edward said, flashing a quick gaze at the side of Sheldon's head. ""At Blacksite 41, no security precaution is too extreme. A single leak could bring all manner of hostiles upon us.""

Before Edward could say anything else, the glasses-wearing man, Oliver, suddenly intervened.

""Ah, Prime Minister, have you been debriefed on the existence of... Red Sentients?""

Bewildered, Sheldon looked at the man with confusion written all over his face. ""I'm sorry. Red Sentients? Is that code for something?""

Oliver paused his walking, then glanced at Edward. ""Doctor, make sure you keep this meeting focused only on official matters, as he is not in the know.""

Edward looked at the Prime Minister with a hint of pity. It seemed that even the leader of the country was on a need-to-know basis when it came to the existence of demonkind and other supernatural entities. That was a shame.

""Of course."" Edward said. ""Apologies, Prime Minister, but regarding this matter... I can't risk a court martial. Not even for your sake. If knowledge of the Red Sentients ever arrives on your desk, it will represent an unfortunate day for our country.""

Sheldon raised an eyebrow. ""Is this some top-secret matter?""

""I'm not at liberty to say."" Edward replied apologetically.

""Alright. I'll speak to my aides later, see if I can find out from them..."" Sheldon said, his tone uncertain.

As they continued, they passed by many isolated rooms with frosted glass windows that mostly hid the interior from the view of outside observers. Some of them, however, had men and women standing outside while wearing large goggles, watching whatever was happening inside. A few of the rooms even emitted bright lights, as if some sort of weapon testing was going on inside.

""We're almost at the heart of the facility."" Edward said, his voice rising an octave in excitement. ""It isn't every day I get to introduce someone important to Blacksite 41's magnum opus!""

Finally, they arrived in a large open area where a giant circular room made of reinforced concrete, titanium, and several other layers kept something inside contained. Sheldon couldn't even begin to hazard a guess at what was inside.

Oliver glanced at the two bodyguards. ""And you two?""

One of the men lifted his chin slightly. ""Secret Wardens 0076 and 8115.""

""So you've been debriefed."" Oliver said. ""It's a good thing Secret Warden 0002 sent a pair who know their stuff. You leak anything you see, you're dead. Your chip will overheat, and your brain will melt.""

""We're well aware, sir."" The bodyguard said.

Sheldon shot a strange look at them. As a politician, he had many bodyguards, and as the Prime Minister, he had so many that he couldn't remember them all. He just assumed these two were heavily armed tactical officers, but from their words, it seemed their origins were anything but normal.

""Secret Wardens?"" Sheldon inquired.

""You might be the Prime Minister, but... I'm afraid this is above your pay grade."" Oliver said. ""Apologies. The Secret Wardens are on the same level as 'Red Sentients.' If you don't need to know, you won't be debriefed.""

Sheldon frowned slightly. He didn't like being left in the dark. No man would, but especially not one who had campaigned for years and worked as hard as he had to climb to the highest office in the land. He had originally thought coming here in person was beneath him, but now?

Now he realized that there were actually hidden parts of society he had never seen before, and wasn't even qualified to know about! Maybe his loud criticisms on TV about the so-called 'deep state' didn't ring as hollow as his opponents claimed.

Even so, he shook off his curiosity. He was dying to know just what the hell was inside this circular chamber, and what it meant for the country... even the world.

Edward walked up, typed in a simple 12-digit code, then scanned his retina and his palm.

After a long minute of seemingly nothing happening, the door unlocked, and a green light flashed on the biometric scanner. It had carefully scanned his entire body for abnormalities and aberrant behavior, yet found nothing amiss.

He pulled the door open, and gestured inside.

""After you, Prime Minister.""

When Sheldon entered the chamber, he was surprised to see a blue light shining in the center of the room, but its source was obscured by many, many shelving units filled with technological objects whose purposes he could not begin to discern. These shelves were surprisingly simple-looking, and purely functional in design. The objects on them, however, were anything but.

In the chamber, there were eleven other men and women, all of whom stood up and turned around when they saw the Prime Minister and his bodyguards enter.

""Welcome to the heart of Blacksite 41."" Edward said. ""The place where humanity's future is being developed.""

Sheldon still wasn't entirely sure what was going on in this location, but it was clear by the security measures and other advanced technologies lying around haphazardly in this room that its purpose was extraordinary... perhaps even otherworldly.

""What exactly... do you do here?"" Sheldon asked, hesitantly.

Edward gestured forward, then led Sheldon around the shelving units, where they finally arrived at a wall of screens circling around a glass tube. Inside that vacuum chamber, a pitch-black orb, barely the size of a fist, levitated in midair and spun with a frightening speed, perhaps hundreds of times per second, maybe even thousands. It spun so fast that from a distance its surface appeared completely smooth, with no imperfections to speak of, and the glowing blue light Sheldon saw earlier seemed to emanate from it.

""This is the object known as ET-001."" Edward said, gesturing to the levitating orb. ""The Americans would not tell us where they picked it up. What we do know is that they obtained it in the late 1940's, not long after the conclusion of the Second World War. Based on contextual clues, we believe it originated from... an alien spacecraft that crash-landed on Earth.""

Sheldon's expression changed drastically. He looked at Edward with shock and disbelief.

""An alien spacecraft? You're certain?""

""The technology in this orb is unlike anything we've ever seen."" Edward explained. ""The researchers you see here are the 5th Generation of ET-001's technologists. The first generation of people who studied it, who won the right for it to be transferred to the UK, they were among the first people to spread High Technology across the world. Televisions, the vacuum-tube, computer transistors... much of it originates from reverse-engineered technology taken from ET-001.""

Edward puffed out his chest. ""But in recent years, it was this team right here, my team, that started to _really_ crack ET-001's code. We have finally managed to link up with it directly, and while its data files have proven to be of little value, its internal circuits are- oh!""

The scientist suddenly turned and gestured past Sheldon, to a red-headed woman standing behind him with her arms crossed and a slight frown on her face.

""I've gotten ahead of myself. Where are my manners? Prime Minister, this is my fiance, and one of the most important researchers in the history of Blacksite 41. She made many key discoveries, alongside the rest of our great team, and helped unlock the true potential of ET-001.""

Edward walked over, and the woman's slight frown disappeared. She smiled when she was finally acknowledged, and her arm wrapped around Edward's waist as she directed her brilliant smile first at him, then at the Prime Minister.""

""My future wife,"" Edward concluded, ""Marie Becker.""

""What a lovely lady!"" Sheldon said, smiling back at Marie. ""Edward is lucky to have a flower like you on his arm!""

""Oh, I haven't done all that much."" Marie said politely, turning the corners of her lips up just a little more. ""It was a team effort. A team effort! Everyone here deserves credit for cracking the code to making Great Britain into the future ruler of the world!""

A chorus of applause exploded in the chamber. The other scientists thanked Marie with their applause, making her and Edward beam brilliant smiles outward in all directions.

""Marie, do you want to continue the explanation?"" Edward asked.

""No, no, you keep talking. You know I hate yammering on. You're much better at explaining information in a way... _laymen_... can understand."" Marie said, while kissing his cheek.

Edward gave her back a light squeeze of reassurance, then pulled away.

""As I was saying, we have harnessed the power of ET-001 to create the world's very first artificial intelligence. I'm sure you've seen the news raving lately about generative AI and its effects on society... but most people have no idea that we have already successfully started work on the first _real_ prototype right here, in this underground lab.""

Edward clapped his hands.

""Umi. Say hello to our guests.""

At once, a monitor facing the men flickered to life, and an indistinct automaton's face came to life, its physical features vaguely in the same of a woman.

""Greetings to Prime Minister Noah Sheldon."" Umi intoned emotionlessly. ""I have assessed your individual deterministic markers and found you barely satisfactory in terms of accomplishment.""

Sheldon blinked. ""_What?_""

He looked at Edward and Marie, only to see looks of astonishment and dismay on their faces.

""I... I'm terribly sorry, Prime Minister."" Edward said in embarrassment. ""Umi is still in a... beta phase. We're working out the kinks in her personality. She doesn't have much of a bedside manner.""

""I am only capable of uttering factual statements."" Umi interjected, immediately butting back into the conversation. ""In terms of physical appearance, I have designated the Prime Minister to possess an objective attractiveness rating of 3.7145 out of 10. Due to recent scandals in the news involving fornication outside of marriage, I have downgraded his political lifetime to the level of-""

""AHEM!"" Edward exclaimed, nearly jumping out of his skin. For the first time today, he showed an emotion other than pride. He was clearly in disbelief of what she was saying. ""Umi! Keep your _subjective opinions_ of others to yourself!""

""There is nothing subjective about my statements."" Umi beeped. ""Based on an analysis of one hundred and forty two million, seven hundred and fifteen thousand, six hundred and twelve inferior biologicals, the Prime Minister-""

""Quiet!"" Edward shouted. ""I am... ordering you not to say another word until prompted!""

Umi beeped again. ""Order confirmed.""

Edward's heart raced. His back turned cold with sweat as he looked over and saw the ugly expression on the Prime Minister's face.

""Ah, the machine still needs several years of fine-tuning before it is ready for governmental usage."" Edward hastily explained. ""When you see the future potential of Umi's predictive weather modeling capabilities, the advancements she can bring in terms of R&D...""

Sheldon's frown only deepened. He smelled something foul in the air. The promises given to him did not match what he had just observed. Not only was the machine obtuse, but it also came off as overly hostile to him.

""This... Umi."" Sheldon said, his tone measured. ""The entire machine is constructed around a piece of _alien_ technology?""

""That- that's right, sir."" Edward said. ""Highly advanced. Once we master its principles, humanity's future trajectory-""

""So what you mean to say,"" Sheldon interrupted, ""is that this data core, or computer core, or whatever it is... it might be hostile?""

""No, no, no no no."" Edward said hurriedly. ""Sir, I know this was a bad first impression, but all these devices around you? These were made with the assistance of Umi. Her processing matrices are a million, maybe even a billion times more capable than what we have on Earth. Think of the advancements we'll be able to make with her cerebral circuits once we iron out the kinks!""

""Your words do not reassure me."" Sheldon said, his tone grim. ""Eighty years of research, and this is the best you've come up with? It didn't take one sentence before your fancy alien AI started assessing my appearance for no discernible reason. How much longer before Umi becomes useful _without_ side effects? Can you answer me that honestly?""

Edward started to answer, but he hesitated.

""Err, perhaps... perhaps another... five or so... years?""

""Five years? You expect me to believe that in only five years, this AI will become reliable enough that it won't endanger our national interests?"" Sheldon pressed.

Finally, Marie Becker seemed as if she couldn't keep quiet any longer. ""Prime Minister, I'm sorry Umi insulted your appearance, but there's no need to be so touchy-feely about it. Her ability to assess massive amounts of data is unparalleled. The scientific advancements we're already making are far beyond what we made just a few years ago. Due to the law of exponential returns-""

""I don't care that I was insulted."" Sheldon interrupted, cutting her off with a wave of his palm. By now, any passion or interest from earlier had already evaporated. ""I'm a politician, and the Prime Minister, to boot. I'm already mocked a million times a day by a million different people. If I didn't have thick skin, I'd have suffered a mental breakdown ages ago. What _bothers_ me is that this machine costs our great nation forty _billion_ pounds a year! Do you think we are the Yanks? That is a massive chunk of our budget we have to obfuscate every year and it's only growing worse as special interest groups continue to poke and prod for information on where our monetary streams are flowing.""

He continued. ""I'm not going to make any hasty judgments. I'm not going to shut this site down. But let me tell you, first impressions matter and I am _far_ from impressed. I'm going to go home and sleep on what I've seen here, then wake up and consult with several experts to see if the funds allocated for this site could be better spent elsewhere. If my mood improves, you might see a limited reduction in your yearly budget, but if it sours, this could very well result in a tremendous decrease in investment funds. I suggest you look into outside investment to keep afloat, because right now Umi's days are numbered.""

His words rang in the air, startling every researcher and scientist in the room. Several people, including Oliver, looked at him in abject shock.

""Are you kidding me?!"" Marie snapped. ""Just because you don't understand the technological principles, you're going to potentially shut us down?! What about your forebearers who deliberately kept us afloat, all with the future promise of a singularity that would make the nation unstoppable?! If you don't invest in us, the US might wrestle back full control, and that would be a disaster for everyone! Those warmongers would surely-""

""I've heard enough."" Sheldon said, raising his palm. ""I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but maybe you should have put a tighter leash on your little captive alien AI. It would take a miracle at this point to convince me that continued excessive funding of Umi is worth the effort. Everyone, I'll be taking my leave now.""

Sheldon gave a courteous nod and a forced smile, the turned on his heels and left the chamber. As he and his bodyguards departed, followed by a shaking and fearful Oliver, the remaining researchers stared at his departing back in horror.

""W...what the hell just happened?!"" Marie exclaimed, shouting at her fiance. ""This wasn't in the cards!""

Edward paled. He looked even more lost than her. ""I don't... know.""

Nobody had expected the Prime Minister's meeting to go so wrong, so quickly. Umi's uncontrolled words had ruined the script and show they had carefully prepared, ruining weeks of work on Edward's part to make a good impression.

Now, their entire future was up in the air... and humanity's survival was at stake.

...

Elsewhere, across the world, in a secret location in Idaho, Hideki Hiro sat inside his log cabin and glanced at his watch.

""Hmm. Today is the day the Prime Minister visits Umi. Should I intervene like usual? Or should I leave them to their own devices?""

He scratched his head, then shrugged.

""Whatever Jason's working on is probably going to change the timeline drastically anyway. I'll just leave Marie alone for now. She can handle the situation.""

He took a sip of his coffee, then tossed the matter to the back of his mind...",10,1753643819.0,HFY,5,0.92,False
1mauwzz,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheCryopodToHell/comments/1mauwzz/cryopod_refresh_661_blacksite_41/,Cryopod Refresh 661: Blacksite 41,"_January 27th, 2021. Twenty kilometers northeast of London._

In a seemingly empty and barren field, a quad-copter hovered in the air. It was an advanced model with blades contained inside circular chambers to lower the volume and make it somewhat stealthy, but its striking appearance did make it stand out more to those who saw it. Luckily, its pilot had taken an especially long and roundabout path to delivers its passengers across the many barren fields lining the landscape of Great Britain, far from the main roads where cars might casually spot its flight path.

The helicopter slowly lowered toward the field below, and at an indeterminate point, it passed through a barrier of energy that revealed the field was not as lifeless as it seemed. A single small concrete structure, barely the size of a park bathroom, stood in the center of the dead, yellowed grass, and a pair of men stood out in front of it, looking up at the descending copter.

After a minute or two, the flying machine finally landed. Another minute passed before a hatch opened up, revealing stairs that lowered to the ground. A well dressed man flanked by two bodyguards wearing tactical gear and sunglasses stepped off the quad-copter and made their way across the field.

The man in the business suit was relatively ordinary looking. He wasn't particularly handsome, but he had a notable air of charisma hidden behind his eyes. He had pale blonde hair, and it was quite thin, likely because he combed it over a bald spot that stubbornly grew bigger and bigger every year. He had sworn many times that if it became any worse, he would definitely shave his head, but the _voters_ wouldn't like seeing such a drastic change in his image. Or at least, that's the reason he gave himself to continually deny the slow and unstoppable advancement of age.

""Prime Minister Sheldon."" One of the two men near the concrete structure said, as the politician walked toward them. ""It's a pleasure to finally introduce you to our little operation.""

This first man who spoke wore a plaid shirt and beige dress jeans. His large and clunky glasses, coupled with his slightly slouched posture, gave him the air of a middle manager. Sheldon assessed his figure immediately and assessed he was not the Person of Interest he had come to meet. That must instead be the man beside him.

Sheldon held out his hand and warmly shook the man's hand. He knew how to smile and play the part of a caring official. He'd done it a million times.

""And you are?"" Sheldon asked.

""Sorry, I should have led with that, sir."" The man said, chuckling awkwardly. ""I'm Oliver Ward, Senior of Personnel Management at Blacksite 41. This young man beside me is our leading scientist, Edward Greer.""

The moment Noah Sheldon's eyes fell on Edward's face, he sensed an aura even more formidable than his own.

""I've gotten ahead of myself. Where are my manners? Prime Minister, this is my fiance, and one of the most important researchers in the history of Blacksite 41. She made many key discoveries, alongside the rest of our great team, and helped unlock the true potential of ET-001.""

Edward walked over, and the woman's slight frown disappeared. She smiled when she was finally acknowledged, and her arm wrapped around Edward's waist as she directed her brilliant smile first at him, then at the Prime Minister.""

""My future wife,"" Edward concluded, ""Marie Becker.""

""What a lovely lady!"" Sheldon said, smiling back at Marie. ""Edward is lucky to have a flower like you on his arm!""

""Oh, I haven't done all that much."" Marie said politely, turning the corners of her lips up just a little more. ""It was a team effort. A team effort! Everyone here deserves credit for cracking the code to making Great Britain into the future ruler of the world!""

A chorus of applause exploded in the chamber. The other scientists thanked Marie with their applause, making her and Edward beam brilliant smiles outward in all directions.

""Marie, do you want to continue the explanation?"" Edward asked.

""No, no, you keep talking. You know I hate yammering on. You're much better at explaining information in a way... _laymen_... can understand."" Marie said, while kissing his cheek.

Edward gave her back a light squeeze of reassurance, then pulled away.

""As I was saying, we have harnessed the power of ET-001 to create the world's very first artificial intelligence. I'm sure you've seen the news raving lately about generative AI and its effects on society... but most people have no idea that we have already successfully started work on the first _real_ prototype right here, in this underground lab.""

Edward clapped his hands.

""Umi. Say hello to our guests.""

At once, a monitor facing the men flickered to life, and an indistinct automaton's face came to life, its physical features vaguely in the same of a woman.

""Greetings to Prime Minister Noah Sheldon."" Umi intoned emotionlessly. ""I have assessed your individual deterministic markers and found you barely satisfactory in terms of accomplishment.""

Sheldon blinked. ""_What?_""

He looked at Edward and Marie, only to see looks of astonishment and dismay on their faces.

""I... I'm terribly sorry, Prime Minister."" Edward said in embarrassment. ""Umi is still in a... beta phase. We're working out the kinks in her personality. She doesn't have much of a bedside manner.""

""I am only capable of uttering factual statements."" Umi interjected, immediately butting back into the conversation. ""In terms of physical appearance, I have designated the Prime Minister to possess an objective attractiveness rating of 3.7145 out of 10. Due to recent scandals in the news involving fornication outside of marriage, I have downgraded his political lifetime to the level of-""

""AHEM!"" Edward exclaimed, nearly jumping out of his skin. For the first time today, he showed an emotion other than pride. He was clearly in disbelief of what she was saying. ""Umi! Keep your _subjective opinions_ of others to yourself!""

""There is nothing subjective about my statements."" Umi beeped. ""Based on an analysis of one hundred and forty two million, seven hundred and fifteen thousand, six hundred and twelve inferior biologicals, the Prime Minister-""

""Quiet!"" Edward shouted. ""I am... ordering you not to say another word until prompted!""

Umi beeped again. ""Order confirmed.""

Edward's heart raced. His back turned cold with sweat as he looked over and saw the ugly expression on the Prime Minister's face.

""Ah, the machine still needs several years of fine-tuning before it is ready for governmental usage."" Edward hastily explained. ""When you see the future potential of Umi's predictive weather modeling capabilities, the advancements she can bring in terms of R&D...""

Sheldon's frown only deepened. He smelled something foul in the air. The promises given to him did not match what he had just observed. Not only was the machine obtuse, but it also came off as overly hostile to him.

""This... Umi."" Sheldon said, his tone measured. ""The entire machine is constructed around a piece of _alien_ technology?""

""That- that's right, sir."" Edward said. ""Highly advanced. Once we master its principles, humanity's future trajectory-""

""So what you mean to say,"" Sheldon interrupted, ""is that this data core, or computer core, or whatever it is... it might be hostile?""

""No, no, no no no."" Edward said hurriedly. ""Sir, I know this was a bad first impression, but all these devices around you? These were made with the assistance of Umi. Her processing matrices are a million, maybe even a billion times more capable than what we have on Earth. Think of the advancements we'll be able to make with her cerebral circuits once we iron out the kinks!""

""Your words do not reassure me."" Sheldon said, his tone grim. ""Eighty years of research, and this is the best you've come up with? It didn't take one sentence before your fancy alien AI started assessing my appearance for no discernible reason. How much longer before Umi becomes useful _without_ side effects? Can you answer me that honestly?""

Edward started to answer, but he hesitated.

""Err, perhaps... perhaps another... five or so... years?""

""Five years? You expect me to believe that in only five years, this AI will become reliable enough that it won't endanger our national interests?"" Sheldon pressed.

Finally, Marie Becker seemed as if she couldn't keep quiet any longer. ""Prime Minister, I'm sorry Umi insulted your appearance, but there's no need to be so touchy-feely about it. Her ability to assess massive amounts of data is unparalleled. The scientific advancements we're already making are far beyond what we made just a few years ago. Due to the law of exponential returns-""

""I don't care that I was insulted."" Sheldon interrupted, cutting her off with a wave of his palm. By now, any passion or interest from earlier had already evaporated. ""I'm a politician, and the Prime Minister, to boot. I'm already mocked a million times a day by a million different people. If I didn't have thick skin, I'd have suffered a mental breakdown ages ago. What _bothers_ me is that this machine costs our great nation forty _billion_ pounds a year! Do you think we are the Yanks? That is a massive chunk of our budget we have to obfuscate every year and it's only growing worse as special interest groups continue to poke and prod for information on where our monetary streams are flowing.""

He continued. ""I'm not going to make any hasty judgments. I'm not going to shut this site down. But let me tell you, first impressions matter and I am _far_ from impressed. I'm going to go home and sleep on what I've seen here, then wake up and consult with several experts to see if the funds allocated for this site could be better spent elsewhere. If my mood improves, you might see a limited reduction in your yearly budget, but if it sours, this could very well result in a tremendous decrease in investment funds. I suggest you look into outside investment to keep afloat, because right now Umi's days are numbered.""

His words rang in the air, startling every researcher and scientist in the room. Several people, including Oliver, looked at him in abject shock.

""Are you kidding me?!"" Marie snapped. ""Just because you don't understand the technological principles, you're going to potentially shut us down?! What about your forebearers who deliberately kept us afloat, all with the future promise of a singularity that would make the nation unstoppable?! If you don't invest in us, the US might wrestle back full control, and that would be a disaster for everyone! Those warmongers would surely-""

""I've heard enough."" Sheldon said, raising his palm. ""I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but maybe you should have put a tighter leash on your little captive alien AI. It would take a miracle at this point to convince me that continued excessive funding of Umi is worth the effort. Everyone, I'll be taking my leave now.""

Sheldon gave a courteous nod and a forced smile, the turned on his heels and left the chamber. As he and his bodyguards departed, followed by a shaking and fearful Oliver, the remaining researchers stared at his departing back in horror.

""W...what the hell just happened?!"" Marie exclaimed, shouting at her fiance. ""This wasn't in the cards!""

Edward paled. He looked even more lost than her. ""I don't... know.""

Nobody had expected the Prime Minister's meeting to go so wrong, so quickly. Umi's uncontrolled words had ruined the script and show they had carefully prepared, ruining weeks of work on Edward's part to make a good impression.

Now, their entire future was up in the air... and humanity's survival was at stake.

...

Elsewhere, across the world, in a secret location in Idaho, Hideki Hiro sat inside his log cabin and glanced at his watch.

""Hmm. Today is the day the Prime Minister visits Umi. Should I intervene like usual? Or should I leave them to their own devices?""

He scratched his head, then shrugged.

""Whatever Jason's working on is probably going to change the timeline drastically anyway. I'll just leave Marie alone for now. She can handle the situation.""

Keep in mind we have a child together and this has been going on 3 years. So I figured I'd have a snoop as I don't normally go through her phone never feel I have too. But I did and found she was texting her ex asking him for money but also just conversating over the past few weeks. She never got to reply before falling asleep but he asked what email so as I read that I laughed sent him mine just too see if he would. Now she has woken up and he did send the money too me lol but I'm honest person so I told her what I did and what happened. But now she's mad at me cause she needs the money I guess. Curiouse what would y'all do if you ran into this? Keep in mind if she needs it I'm not keeping it from her in anyway way I'm not like that.

1mauvih,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewedAppliances/comments/1mauvih/explore_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_keurig/,Explore the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Supreme Worth It,"Brewing coffee every day is almost like a ritual for me, so testing the Keurig K-Supreme was an exciting prospect. With its promise of MultiStream Technology and options for customization, I was curious whether it would meet my high expectations for the perfect cup of coffee. Having spent a fair amount of time with this machine, I have plenty of thoughts to share.

**Design and Build**

The sleek, black design of the Keurig K-Supreme easily complements any modern kitchen aesthetic. Its compact dimensions of 10.12"" x 14.84"" x 14.41"" allow it to fit on countertops without taking up excessive space. One feature that really stood out, in my experience, was the dual-position 66 oz. removable reservoir. This design makes it convenient to refill and adjust depending on your space constraints. While the machine is lightweight at just 1 pound, it doesn't feel flimsy or poorly constructed—I’d describe it as both stylish and functional.

**Versatile Brewing Options**

I often crave variety in my coffee, and this machine delivered. The ability to select from 6, 8, 10, or 12 oz. brew sizes is a fantastic feature that caters to different moods. I found the ""Strong"" button particularly useful for those mornings when I needed an extra kick. For iced coffee lovers like myself, the option to brew strong coffee directly over ice was a game-changer. The flexibility to brew both hot and cold drinks makes this model stand out among single-serve machines. 

**Check [Keurig K-Supreme] price on Amazon.**

**Performance and MultiStream Technology**

The MultiStream Technology is advertised as being a step up from existing machines, and I agree. By saturating the coffee grounds more evenly, every cup is aromatic and flavorful. Compared to older models, I can confirm that this technology extracts a richer flavor. I tested it with several different K-Cup pods, and regardless of the brand, the coffee consistently tasted fresher and more robust. However, when trying to use ground coffee with a reusable filter, the taste wasn’t as strong—something I’d consider if you're a fan of freshly ground beans.

**Pluses**

- MultiStream Technology creates better extraction and flavor.
- Customizable brew strength to cater to individual taste.
- Quick brewing ensures a fresh cup in minutes.
- Back-to-back brewing eliminates downtime, perfect for multiple users.
- Accommodates taller travel mugs efficiently. 

**Maintenance and Alerts**

Every coffee maker comes with upkeep, and this one makes it simple with a maintenance alert that reminds you to descale after every 250 brews. That being said, the cleaning process itself isn’t overly complicated. With the removable tank and simple controls, daily cleaning and occasional descaling remain hassle-free. I do, however, wish it alerted for other maintenance needs, such as cleaning the coffee pod area, as this can occasionally get a bit messy if you're not careful.

**Drawbacks**

- Reusable coffee filters don't perform as well as pre-packaged pods.
- The machine can be slightly noisy during operation.
- Limited to manual operation—some may miss automated scheduling features.
- Lack of a milk frother feels like a missed opportunity for latte enthusiasts.

**Peer Products**

Compared to competitors like the Nespresso Vertuo, I felt this machine offered a bit more variety with its customizable brew sizes and compatibility with a wide range of K-Cup pods. However, the Nespresso does outshine it in delivering espresso-based drinks and features like built-in milk frothers, something this product lacks. On the other hand, the Keurig machine is more versatile when it comes to price range and is decidedly more user-friendly with its simple button control system. Fellow single-serve models like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew also come close but fall behind in terms of brew customization and flavor consistency.

**Quality for Price**

While specific pricing varies depending on deals, I believe this coffee maker justifies its cost. It’s not the cheapest option out there, but the blend of advanced technology and brewing versatility makes it worth considering. For someone like me who drinks multiple cups a day and enjoys experimenting with coffee styles, the investment feels justified. If you’re the type who sticks to basic coffee without needing customization, you might find cheaper alternatives better suited to your needs.

1mauuat,https://www.reddit.com/r/Perimenopause/comments/1mauuat/45f_hsp_navigating_perimenopause_gastritis/,"45F | HSP | Navigating Perimenopause, Gastritis, Hormones, and Sensitivity","Hi all, I wanted to share my journey in case it resonates with anyone going through something similar. I'm 45, female, and a Highly Sensitive Person (HSP), navigating perimenopause, along with some GI issues, hormonal challenges, and the emotional and physical rollercoaster that comes with it.

**🌿 A Bit About Me**

* Age: 45
* No children
* HSP (Highly Sensitive Person)
* Live a mindful, health-aware lifestyle
* Previously active, lean, and high energy
* Lifelong issues with oral contraceptives and medication side effects

**🥴 Gastritis Journey**

* **January 2024**: Took naproxen for a wrist injury — stopped after 10 days due to stomach pain.
* **By April 2024**: Intense upper abdominal distention and pressure (not burning), especially after eating. The distention was painful — not just uncomfortable — and so extreme that *pants wouldn’t close*, even though my weight hadn’t changed.
* Multiple tests (ultrasound, colonoscopy, gallbladder function, etc.) found nothing alarming.
* **December 2024**: Finally diagnosed with *mild chronic gastritis* via endoscopy.
* **January–April 2025**: Followed a strict gastritis-friendly diet. Stopped coffee (in Oct '24). This helped a lot.
* **April 2025**: Diet loosened too quickly while traveling, symptoms returned somewhat.

**🩸 PMS & Perimenopause Journey**

* 2023–Early 2024: PMS progressively worsened.
   * Cramps, heavier/longer periods
   * Fatigue, migraines, neck/shoulder tension
   * Felt terrible 2 weeks/month (week before + during period)
* Headaches evolved into full-on migraines by mid-2024.

**💊 Hormonal Interventions**

* **Past (Teens–20s)**:
   * Previously on **Diane 35**, **Yasmin**, and **NEO Eunomin**
   * All three caused **significant diffuse hair shedding**
   * Stopped all oral contraceptives in 2007 after 11 years due to unacceptable hair loss
* **Sep 2024 – May 2025**: Started *Enskyce* (oral contraceptive)
   * First few months were *great*: lighter periods, reduced PMS, fewer headaches
   * Switched to continuous use in Dec 2024 to eliminate periods
   * By Feb/March 2025: Migraines returned, energy tanked, **hair shedding began again**
   * Stopped Enskyce in mid-May 2025
   * **Major learning**: Oral contraceptives can be tricky for highly sensitive individuals because the hormones undergo first-pass metabolism in the liver, which can amplify systemic effects like **fatigue**, **digestive issues**, and **hormone imbalance** — and in some, trigger side effects like diffuse **hair loss**. Nobody ever told me this before, had to find out the hard way.
* **May 2025 – Present**: Switched to *Mirena IUD + Estradiol patch*
   * Mirena inserted mid-May, Estradiol 0.025 mg started shortly after
   * Felt good at first: no periods, no migraines, more stable mood
   * Mid-July: Increased patch to 0.05 mg —> *bad reaction*
      * Fatigue, insomnia, “tired but wired” feeling
      * Scaled back to 0.025 mg after 2 weeks — slowly improving again
   * **Hair shedding is still ongoing** — not worsening, but definitely not improving yet

**⚖️ Weight Gain Timeline**

* **Jan 2024**: 118–122 lbs (slightly harder to lose weight than before)
* **Mid-2024**: 123–126 lbs
* **Post-Mirena (May 2025)**: Jumped to 131–132, peaked at 134 after estrogen dose increase
* Goal is to return to 115–118 lbs range

**✅ What I'm Hoping to Solve For**

1. **Weight regulation**
2. **Stop hair shedding**
3. **Stabilize energy/mood/hormones** without triggering migraines or gastritis
4. **Keep stomach calm** while managing hormones

Would love to hear from anyone who’s:

* Had success with *Mirena + low-dose estrogen* for perimenopause
* Seen *hair loss slow down* after stopping oral contraceptives, or after getting Mirena
* Balanced HSP sensitivities with hormone therapy

I’m building a coffee brand with a fresh perspective — high-quality specialty coffee served through a grab-and-go model.

The problem today is that most coffee chains focus on sit-down experiences, where people often end up spending 30 minutes to an hour just to enjoy a cup. My vision is different: serve exceptional coffee at one-third the price of leading brands, with a fast, convenient, and aesthetic experience.

Our pricing will be accessible — between ₹70 to ₹120 — and we’ll operate through branded, mobile kiosks designed to attract footfall and deliver speed without compromising quality.

I’ve already trademarked a strong brand name and am looking to get started soon. I’m currently seeking an early-stage investor who sees the potential in this space, especially, in emerging tier-2 cities and urban hubs, where coffee culture is growing fast but still underserved.

If this excites you, let’s talk. Together, we can build the coffee culture our country truly deserves. ☕✨",9,1753643569.0,StartUpIndia,18,1.0,False

I usually order espressos when visiting abroad in the summer but I do utilise my Hario Switch at home a lot for filter as I prefer filter in colder climates.

But this time I've been ordering filter & I'm noticing a trend that the stores have kettles of batches of filter that they just pour from.

How are they managing to brew so well, at such high quantities with so much consistency? 

I am relatively happy with my brews at home but consistency is always a struggle with home brews I find.

I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (27M) for almost three years. This summer has honestly been really lonely. It feels like he doesn’t want to spend time with me anymore.

He never wants to do anything together, no walks, no dinners, no small trips or even just watching a movie. I've suggested things all summer, but he always says no or gets annoyed. We’ve spent basically zero quality time together in months.

My female friends are busy with kids, partners, or out of town, so I’ve been hanging out with a male friend instead, just swimming, coffee, and talking. Nothing romantic.

Now my boyfriend is upset and says it’s disrespectful. I get that it might bother him, but I also feel like… why should I sit around waiting for someone who clearly doesn’t want to make time for me?

I feel lonely, unimportant, and emotionally disconnected. I don’t want to cheat or hurt anyone, I just want to feel like my partner actually wants to be with me.

TL;DR: My boyfriend never wants to do anything together, and we’ve barely spent time with each other all summer. Now he’s mad that I’m spending time with a male friend (nothing romantic), but I feel really lonely and unsure what to do.",7,1753643549.0,relationships,9,0.89,False

1maur9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1maur9z/is_this_narcissism_how_do_you_handle_not/,Is this narcissism? How do you handle not affording to be independent from parents?,"I've been struggling to move out for several years, even when I was a minor. Divorced parents, mom was physically abusive, dad (who im currently living with) is emotionally abusive. Dad keeps holding above my head how he's helped me move away from my mom, so now I owe him everything. It took me a long time to realize this relationship wasn't just family butting heads but excessive harassment, and now I've been contemplating if its considered narcissism. 

Im disabled and even when I was working full time I could not afford to move out with how awful rent prices are here (a basement or single room is easily $1-2k+). Being an adult, I'm stuck with ""just move out"" as the only advice offered, any other resources for moving from an abusive household I find are only considered for minors or people in domestic abusive relationships.

I know its not just me, my sister has not visited since last year for the same reasons. She's off at college so she isn't stuck here like I am, needing to rely on him for shelter.

It's gone to the point where we cant have a single conversation about /anything/ without him being aggressive towards me. He automatically assumes the worst and claims I'm starting these arguments or accusations when I don't- a simple question like ""was x done?"" turns into a yelling fest of him claiming I'm accusing him of something. He sometimes will forget something I tell him earlier then gets aggressive about it as if I never told him at all. Yesterday I was cleaning and put some empty bottles that were laying around into the recycling just for him to immediately yell at me for not knowing he wanted to keep them

The narcissism aside, the hoarding is unbearable. I'm constantly cleaning up after him and the house still looks like garbage especially when im too tired to catch up. We've lived through several different types of pests (cockroaches, mice, moths, flies, etc). I cant use the kitchen without spending an hour cleaning everything beforehand. Crumbs and stains everywhere, sticky bug spray residue on every surface, refusal to throw away moldy food, never putting anything away so theres no free table space. If I leave a bowl in the sink to soak in some soap to clean it, it's the end of the world. I've gotten blamed for leaving a cup of coffee wherever despite being the only person in the whole family who doesn't drink coffee. My room is the cleanest (no messier than the average bedroom really gets) and the pest infestations still come to me. For months every year ill have flies constantly flying into my face while sitting at my desk or laying in bed.

With my disability, I basically have trouble doing much of anything, i'm constantly in pain or fatigue easily. I dont eat, sleep, or drink well. He takes his own health issues seriously but never my own. o  
On the occasion when I constantly feel like I would easily pass out or have no strength to lift anything, he will verbally assault me for ""not wanting"" to help him with physical labor. I've been berated for getting a walking aid because im not a senior, told my screaming fits from painful ovarian cysts were exaggerated, basically telling me any of my issues are made up or not as bad as they are despite the numerous visits to ERs or specialists. (I once had a pilonidal cyst and he would pressure me to go on a damn hike despite me crying in pain the whole way).

Living with him makes it physically impossible to deal with improving my personal health. I already have trouble dealing with climbing the stairs so having additional obstacles make it too difficult to manage anything. It's a struggle to do anything when everything you need is shoved behind piles of hoarded items blocking the way. I cant do the laundry if I cant even reach machines. I cant save money and cook at home if there's no clean/clear kitchen space. The heat and humidity make me lose almost all function, it worsens my blood flow by a lot and I cant breathe, yet he insists the climate here stays that way (on the off chance he will let the ac on, he leaves doors and windows open anyway)

Im gender queer, I came out several years ago and he's been very resistant about it. He'd always tell me I shouldn't go through transitioning and act as if any of my health issues come from HRT, treating it like a dangerous drug. When he gets upset he deadnames me, and this week when I told him to stop after doing it twice in a row he complains ""when are you going to get over that?""

I've contemplated several times of living in my car but I cannot trust to leave my cat in his care. He's proven several times to not be trusted with my pets, the worst example being how he killed my rabbit by going out of his way to overfeed him and never once apologized in the slightest. He neglects his own fish tank and will berate me for not cleaning it for him. The fish die, and he just buys more, I feel so bad for them.

I've tried several times to work things out before I learned that no amount of effort on my own will make him better, I'll carefully word my points in therapy speak (not laying the blame on him, explaining how what he does make me feel and why I act the way I do-""when you do x i feel y"" sort of thing, even apologizing for things I could personally work on). There is no talking to him, he just wants a pass to freely berate me and never accept any wrongdoing or criticism. It always ends up so one-sided that the best thing I can do is physically leave the room (which he then tries to turn it on /me/ not wanting to talk). I've tried convincing him to go to therapy, Ive even reached out to his friends to ask for help- but he's already manipulated their perception of my sister and I to look like unappreciative children just using him for our own gain.

He confronted me once about ""not wanting to talk things out"" by blocking me off in the closet and refusing to move out of the way despite me begging and screaming and pushing him to let me go, only moving away when I threatened to call the police then guilt tripping me for even thinking of doing that to him.

I try my best to not be reliant on him especially financially. Any ""help"" he provides is conditional, it's all blackmail to use as an excuse to treat me poorly later. I mostly rely on my own savings to pay for my food, medical bills, etc, but I need to rely on him to financially assist for rent, insurance, and utilities.  
Right now im struggling to keep my old car working as it needs lot of expensive repairs, he's upset I refuse to let him pay for the repairs or help get another car. He cannot understand the reasoning behind me refusing to accept gifts or aid even when I outright tell him that he always uses it as collateral to treat me poorly later.  


Im really not too sure what else to try. Its getting harder to manage over time as my health continues to worsen in this condition. Fighting for enough income in this job economy to actually improve anything while managing 100 other things is impossible. I cant function if I cant eat, drink, or sleep enough, I cant study to improve my education for a change of better job offers if I don't feel healthy enough to focus, I cant manage catching up on treating my symptoms. So many of any available resources require support I don't have. Having a lot of these issues on their own is hard enough, and its even harder having a parent I'm stuck relying on who is constantly worsening a lot of them.  
Ive just not been talking to him, not replying or saying a word when he talks to me, or just locking myself in my room all day (ive had to add a lock to my door, he'd just otherwise barge in whenever and demand my lack of personal time or privacy), but I really dont know what to do next",3,1753643445.0,narcissisticparents,1,1.0,False

I’ve had my offer accepted a couple weeks ago on a house and my bills will be going up a lot. Just wanted to run it by people to see what thoughts are. A lot of it will be assumptions as I won’t know exactly what electricity/gas/etc. will be. 

I’m starting a new job and my income will be £55k p/a or roughly £3.3k p/m after taxes and student loan. I’ll be doing this solo. 

Spending monthly:
Mortgage payment: £1283 
Groceries: £~250 (including hello fresh)
Home insurance: £~20 (?)
Gas & electricity: £140 (?)
Water: £45 (?)
Council tax: £165 (with single person discount)
Car fuel/tax: £80

Total: £2043

I was thinking of then putting about £800 into savings and then I have £400 for misc spending each month i.e coffees, lunch, clothes shopping, anything else. Does that all look realistic?

__________

Much as he dreamed of it, Alex never imagined he would meet the most powerful man alive. And after the fact, he wished he didn’t.

Robots stomped around the street, rapidly searching between cars and buildings for victims. Standing on two obsidian feet, their faces were a smooth, curved surface with opaque covers over screens just beyond the surface. They stood about six feet tall and carried a deadly aura about them as they moved with a fluidity reserved for living things. 

 The ground emitted several tremors as the large humanoid creatures raced around, cracking pavement with powerful metallic limbs. Shrieks filled the skies, stacking to a constant, dissonant yowl. The scene before Alex was a chaotic jumble of crushed cars and rubble; the air hung heavy with the scent of dust and gasoline, as his eyes trembled with adrenaline. Blood trickled down the back of his head. He was cold with fear, his feet planted to the ground. 

With a single, metallic punch, he witnessed the bots make feats like destroy multiple cars, or bring down a building. And at one time, a single blow was even enough to kill a family.

His family. 

Rounding a corner, a bot scanned him for a moment, its smooth head motionless. Alex held his breath, freezing in place and hoping it would​​ scan past him. 

“You will donate to The Cause?” it droned questioningly, stomping toward him and shaking his world. 

Alex stumbled back and fell to the ground. “No, no!”

“Donate to The Cause.” It was no longer asking.

The street memorized its footsteps as it crushed the distance between them and loomed over the ten-year-old. 

“I don’t have any money!” Alex said, panicked. 

“Inconsequential.” The bot reached down and held Alex up by his legs, shaking him as though searching for loose change. 

Nothing fell out, Alex screaming all the while. Another bot approached, stomping its way over and grabbing his arms. They pulled in opposite directions. It was unclear whether they were doing it on purpose or ignoring one another, but one thing was certain. 

Alex was being torn apart. 

His muscles screamed in protest, stretched to their breaking point, and he felt the searing pain of tiny tears. Crying out in agony, Alex began hoping for his life to end, just for the pain to stop there and not get any worse. 

Then, a bot disappeared. 

Flopping down in the arms of the other bot, Alex blinked from his upside down position. Two metal legs smoked where the bot was standing only an instant ago. A small hopeful smile on his face, Alex saw a young man with a flaming white head tear down from the sky, radiating pure energy. 

Lightcrown. 

Rearing a shining arm back, he thrust it into the bot and melted it from the inside. Alex fell from the malfunctioning bot releasing its grip and was immediately caught by a quick swipe of Lightcrown’s arm, placed gingerly on the ground in the span of a heartbeat. Alex wobbled slightly, unfocused. 

“Get out of here, it’s not safe,” Lightcrown told him and pointed. “You need to run as fast as you can. Go toward Hammerton Central.” 

“Can you come with me?” Alex clung to his leg. “I don’t wanna go by myself.”

Kneeling down, Lightcrown’s face was unreadable behind the warm light of flame. But there was a softness in his tone. 

“Sorry, buddy, but I have to go save more people. I need you to be brave and go. Now.”

Alex nodded. Lightcrown was already on the move, pivoting in place and blasting off with such force that Alex stumbled back. 

With mouth wide open, Alex remained in place, the scene capturing him more than his need to find safety. Lightcrown was fighting for him. Right there! And he was winning. The pinnacle of human potential. The apex display of the extraordinary in the robot-infested neighborhood. Alex wished he could help, but Lightcrown was the only one with incredible power. 

Two blocks down, another set of bots looked up as Lightcrown landed near them. One charged forward. Lightcrown became a blur and suddenly had his hand on the bot’s face. The next moment, the bot was like a crushed can of soda, tossed away. Lightcrown disposed of the second bot without seeming to notice it. Lightning arced from the powered young man and erupted into a powerful explosion, leaving no machine bits behind. 

Inching forward, Alex got a better view from behind a mound of rubble. 

Bots tackled Lightcrown from the air, but he was quick to spin in a tornado and fling them off, shredding them apart with abilities unknown. Like it was effortless for him to throw multiple powers at once, always ready for a new way to destroy the robots. 

Looking around at the dozens of bots in that one area alone, Alex felt a seed of hope  foster within him. Lightcrown was winning, and he got to see it all. Maybe this day wasn’t as bad as he originally thought. 

Then more bots tackled Lightcrown from the sky, and when he fought them away, Alex witnessed the first drops of blood fall from Lightcrown. His eyes widened slightly, his heart going tight. 

As though they had discovered their target, bots turned from their victims and raced in to smash into Lightcrown. One after another, they piled onto him like a football dog pile with no sense of preserving themselves. The bots would crash into him with such force, pieces would fly off as they squished further into him, each attacking with what limbs remained.

So many piled onto him that Alex couldn’t even see Lightcrown anymore. Fear gripping his chest, Alex stepped back and ran. 

But not before a scream emanated from the pile of bots and erupted into an explosion that swallowed him and everything around him. 

***

*Twelve Years Later - Present Day*

The most powerful man alive just wanted to have breakfast in peace. 

Utensils clinked around the small diner as Pinn chewed slowly on his French toast, exploring the taste with a sense of irritation. He’d consumed the same breakfast every day for months, but he never tired of the routine, always saving the sliced strawberry for last. It usually brought him a sense of calm and muted satisfaction to carry him through the day, but today was different. 

Someone was staring. Sensing him before he saw him, Pinn slowly raised his gaze to check who was entranced with him. From outside the large window, a kid no older than seventeen was beaming at Pinn, placing his hand on the window in wonder. He had short brown hair, striking green eyes, and a hint of a darker complexion. His attire was athletic, and he held an easy smile that showed off all of his white teeth. Pinn lowered his head, trying to get out of the feeling of his intense sight.

“Everything going okay today?” the waitress refilled his mug of coffee. 

Smile infectious, her dirty-blonde hair sat tied up on her head above her uniform. The diner provided her with a black shirt and long black skirt which she slid in with ease. A few pins were tucked into the hip of her uniform and she waited on her customer patiently. 

Pinn didn’t reply, keeping his face low. 

“Well, it’s good to see you, as always,” she said sweetly. 

Pinn cracked a smile, then hid it away in the same moment. Grinning slightly, the waitress went on her way. 

The kid entered the diner, his smile somehow stretching even wider as he approached. Eyes locked onto Pinn, he strode over, looking too eager. Closing his eyes, Pinn ground his teeth and sighed. 

“You’re him!” the young man exclaimed, taking a seat across from Pinn. 

He looked Pinn up and down, scanning from his black hair, to the hint of age on his face, to the lightly salted goatee with disheveled stubble across the rest of his chin. Pinn suddenly felt self conscious about his button-down shirt and khakis, feeling like he was being judged by the one dressed for athleticism. The two words were already too much enthusiasm from the stranger.

“Kid, no one invited you to sit down,” Pinn intoned.

“My name’s Sami. I thought you were dead,” he said, getting comfortable in the seat and placing a gallon jug of water on the table.

Pinn squinted at it, then tried to give Sami a contemptuous stare to scare him off. Sami seemingly ignored him and pulled out his phone. For an instant of dread, Pinn tensed up, ready to crush the device and throw Sami a hundred miles away. 

“What’s good?”

With confusion turned to relief, Pinn realized Sami was looking up the diner’s menu. Pinn relaxed, unbending his fork that he had just folded in half and setting it loudly on his plate. Sami continued to scroll undisturbed.  

“Hey, kid…” Pinn sighed.

“Sami.”

“We’re not friends. You’re close to half my age. I never invited you to sit down. I’d like to be left alone.”

“I’m good, thanks.” His attention was back on the menu. “Ew, gross, who would eat French toast? Do they not have crepes?” Sami leaned into his screen as he continued to scroll. 

Pinn set his teeth together and looked around with his eyes alone. No one was so close that they could overhear anything said. Heart beating nervously, he breathed deeply and steeled himself to be assertive.

“Kid, leave me alone, okay?” Pinn ordered quietly. 

Sami shuddered and glanced up, his smile faltering. Looking sheepish, he blinked before speaking. 

“Oh, my bad, you got the French toast? Embarrassing. But also gross. Who wants French sauce on their toast? Actually, is that where your powers come from?” Sami asked eagerly, speaking in rapid fire. 

Pinn blinked, stunned. It was clear at that point that the kid was Awakened.

“French sauce?” Pinn repeated. 

“Also, how come you’re not dead?” Sami asked, neck craned back to his phone. 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone. But I gotta know!”

“Kid, whoever you think I am…”

“Name’s Sami!” Sami said happily, looking up from the screen as though introducing himself for the first time again. 

Pinn paused, closing his eyes and letting out a long stream of air. 

“I’m not who you think I am,” Pinn said, opening his eyes and sounding sincere. 

“Okay, then, who are you?”

“I’m the guy who wants to be left alone.”

“That means you *are *who I think you are. Unless you’re someone else. Are you? No. Right? I don’t think you are. Otherwise, you would probably be out there,” Sami said, flicking his head to the doorway.

Pinn said nothing, frowning at the boy. 

Sami was unperturbed, lowering his phone and placing it on the table to give Pinn his full attention. 

“I get it. You’re probably confused because we keep talking around it, but you’re Lightcrown, right? Actually, don’t answer that. It would ruin my image of you if you lied. Unless you were gonna confirm that you’re Lightcrown. Which I already know.” Sami smiled eagerly.

Pinn thought through his next set of words carefully. 

“What makes you think I’m someone you recognize?”

“I got three powers. Oops, I mean… I’m a Grade 3. I think? I don’t remember how HUE’s grade system works. It’s still kinda fresh.”

“You’re in HUE? Or that other one?” Pinn couldn’t help himself from asking, an eyebrow raised. And three powers so young? Not that he was one to talk. 

“No, not yet. Actually, I was on my way over to HUE.” Sami pulled a card out of his pocket and slapped it on the table. An invitation to try to become a member of the Hero Unification Entity. Depending on the angle of view, the card would change color, its edges shining with a holographic, prismatic effect. “Wait, this is a great opportunity! What should my name be? Lightcrown is cool. I want something like that!”

“A friend?” The waitress had returned, and Pinn lowered his head in mortification. 

Sami sat up straight and grinned politely. Leaning forward, he read the nametag on her uniform.

“Hi, Kelly! I’m ready to order! Do you guys have crepes?”

“Sorry, sweetie, but we don’t. If you wanna take a look at our menu…” Kelly began, but Sami was quick to jump in.

“Yeah, I already checked your menu, I just wanted to make sure you didn’t have a secret menu. That’s cool, can I get a bowl of grapes and a side of whipped cream?” 

Kelly tilted her head to the side, puzzled by the order, and took note. Almost automatically she looked like she would move away, but her brain caught her like a hook and she glanced between Sami and Pinn. Then she raised her eyebrows as an idea came to mind. 

“Would you mind telling me his name? He’s been coming daily for at least the past month, but won’t say! And he only pays in cash!” She pointed to Pinn with her check pad.

Pinn’s face was flushed red, eyes wide as he stared in horror at Sami. His cover was blown. He’d have to leave. Or do something more drastic. 

“I dunno. He hasn’t told me yet. But I’m paying, so maybe he’ll tell me,” Sami said good-naturedly as he pulled out a debit card. He stopped just shy of placing it on the table, looking at Pinn with concern. “You didn’t order like a hundred things before I showed up, right?”

“He didn’t,” Kelly assured him. 

“Then this one’s on me!” Sami’s grin returned at full force, slapping his debit card next to his HUE invitation card. 

Kelly took the card and walked away, smiling to herself. Swallowing hard, Pinn cleared his throat and kept his eyes on the strawberry next to his French toast. 

“Thanks,” he muttered. 

“Don’t mention it. I have at least twenty dollars in the bank,” Sami said, sounding as though he was genuinely bragging.

“I meant about…” Pinn trailed and checked around with his eyes again. “Not telling her your *hypothesis* about who I am.”

“Oh, no, it’s not a hypothesis. You’re Lightcrown. I noticed how you quietly freaked out when I pulled out my phone. You thought I was gonna take a picture, right?” 

Pinn remained stone faced, but Sami was absolutely right. The young man continued as he slipped his phone into his pocket.

“That’s what really sold me. One of my powers is to see the number of powers someone has. It’s like… I dunno, like clouds over people’s heads, kinda. Bubbles of thick mist? It’s usually like a bubble or two, one for each power. And they vary in color and size, some are brighter than others. And I think the bigger it is, the more powerful? I’m not sure, I only just gained this power. Well, anyway, I saw the stuff over your head and you freaked out over a potential photo, which means you’re famous. Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone. You probably have your reasons.” Sami sounded so sincere that Pinn believed him. 

Pinn raised an eyebrow. There was no hiding now. But he was still curious to know more about Sami’s assessment of him. It might help.

“How many of those clouds do you see above me?”

“Oh, I have no idea. It’s a storm up there, just a straight-up hurricane localized right there.” Sami stared somewhere just above Pinn’s dark hair. “Dozens. Hundred? More? Like I said, no idea.”

“I see.”

“Also, I thought you were like a curmudgeonly old man, but I think you’re just bad at talking to people. Are you really shy? Or do you have social anxiety? Wait, that might be the same thing. Even then, you’ve been coming here forever and never told Kelly your name?” Sami asked, amused. 

Pinn pressed his lips tight, looking around with his eyes to make sure Kelly didn’t overhear what Sami just said. 

“I’m not old,” Pinn muttered. 

“Dude, you’re like… forty. That’s super old,” Sami assured him. 

Pinn’s eyebrows flinched in offense. “I’m a decade younger than that and forty isn’t old.”

“Why haven’t you told her your name? She clearly likes you. Well, maybe not *likes* you, but definitely *likes* you, you know?” Sami took a swig of water from his jug with a knowing smile on his face. 

As his face warmed in embarrassment, Pinn was having a hard time following what the kid wanted from him. Pinn wasn’t really sure what he wanted, beyond chatting. With narrow eyes, Pinn was looking for the angle, now that the kid held the knowledge of Lightcrown in front of him. Sami didn’t even dwell on his questions very long, jumping from subject to subject. It didn’t feel like he was getting grilled for more information. More like the kid was a fan and just wanted the chance to talk to him.

Despite himself trying to remain distant, Pinn was warming up to the kid. 

“I can’t tell her,” Pinn said finally. 

“That’s cool. You can tell her some other way,” Sami said, perfectly understanding. “You could *accidentally *drop your platinum status credit card and show her you’re loaded.”

“I don’t have a platinum card.”

“You can drop your *gold* credit card.”

Pinn said nothing. 

“Regular credit card?” Sami asked, starting to sound concerned. 

Pinn still said nothing. Though his face remained emotionless, amusement at the young man’s antics flickered within him. Sami’s eyebrows had descended, deep in consternation. He was clearly having a hard time thinking of another flashy way to reveal the name.

“We can go with the original plan. You just tell me and I’ll tell her,” Sami said, finally. 

“No.”

“Well, it was worth a shot,” Sami shrugged and began chugging his water, Pinn watching warily. 

When he was halfway through the gallon of water, Kelly returned and placed a bowl of grapes, whipped cream, and Sami’s debit card in front of him. Without missing a beat, Sami slammed some water down and grabbed the bowl of grapes, upending it and dumping its entire contents into his mouth at once. Kelly giggled lightly and Pinn cracked a smile, closing his eyes to prevent laughter at the display of fruit bulging at Sami’s cheeks. 

“Any luck with the name?” Kelly asked. 

“Mmm-mmm.” Sami shook his head, smiling as he chewed. 

“That’s a shame. Maybe next time,” Kelly replied with a charmed eyebrow raised to Pinn. 

Pinn dashed the smile from his face and turned away, abashed. Sami swallowed down the food with a loud gulp and scooped the entirety of the whipped cream into his mouth with a spoon he grabbed from Pinn’s side of the table. Washing it all down with more water, Sami checked the time on his phone. His eyes widened, and he stood to leave, grabbing his cards and scribbling thirty-three cents under the “tip” portion of the receipt. Together with the bill, the total was an even twenty dollars.

“Next time!” Sami agreed, wiping his hand across his mouth as he exhaled contentedly.

“Next time?” Pinn asked. 

With a mock salute of two fingers tapped against his temple, Sami spun and left Pinn without another word. Kelly waved goodbye and went to address other customers. Pinn blinked, astonished at Sami leaving so soon. 

Nothing more than plain conversation. Possibly even pleasant conversation. Where Pinn was certain the intrusion would leave him annoyed, he instead found himself wishing it would have lasted just a bit longer. He stared down at his unfinished French toast, then popped the strawberry in his mouth, savoring it. Eating it earlier made it taste even better than usual. 

*Next time.*

For the first time in years, Pinn thought he may have made a friend.

1maujfx,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1maujfx/i_messed_up_yesterday_hardcore/,I messed up yesterday hardcore.,"It was a two person close yesterday, and my barista and I were alternating soloing drive/bar, while one of us knocked out closing tasks or I did my SSV tasks. 

She was in the bathroom so I was covering her, and I got a ton of mobiles at once, while making orders coming in through drive. So, naturally, I’d wait to do the mobiles until they came to the box.  

I had a lady come to the box and she mobile ordered a pike traveler (probably like three minutes prior). I had already dumped and cleaned our urns so I had no brewed coffee on hand (it was 30 minutes until close). I told her to brew a fresh batch, have the supplies prepped and everything ready to go FRESH, it would take me a good ten minutes, since I’m also doing other orders in between, and if that was okay. 

She was begging if I had ANY leftover coffee already made, and I kept apologizing saying I didn’t, and that we dumped it but I’d be more than happy to make it fresh. She then told me “I have a family in the hospital with a dying family member and their last request was a hot cup of coffee.” 

I was flabbergasted. I told her I’d be happy to still make it, or I could do espresso based drinks for her since that would take less time. And she was super upset understandably. And she said that the family member wouldn’t be alive much longer and that she was afraid she wouldn’t make it in time if I brewed her a fresh batch of coffee. I had no idea what else to do for her. 

She snapped and said to just refund her. So when she got to the window I did. Defeated, she asked if I could just get her a couple venti lattes. I told her yes and that I’d make those straight away. She was crying at this point, so I told her the lattes were on us today and I was so sorry I couldn’t make that traveler happen for her in a timely manner. 

I think through the entire time that it took to explain to her about the travelers, refunding her, apologizing up and down, and making two hot lattes while soloing, I probably could’ve had her traveler ready. I felt so terrible when she drove away. ",22,1753642930.0,starbucksbaristas,12,0.92,False

__________

Much as he dreamed of it, Alex never imagined he would meet the most powerful man alive. And after the fact, he wished he didn’t.

Robots stomped around the street, rapidly searching between cars and buildings for victims. Standing on two obsidian feet, their faces were a smooth, curved surface with opaque covers over screens just beyond the surface. They stood about six feet tall and carried a deadly aura about them as they moved with a fluidity reserved for living things. 

 The ground emitted several tremors as the large humanoid creatures raced around, cracking pavement with powerful metallic limbs. Shrieks filled the skies, stacking to a constant, dissonant yowl. The scene before Alex was a chaotic jumble of crushed cars and rubble; the air hung heavy with the scent of dust and gasoline, as his eyes trembled with adrenaline. Blood trickled down the back of his head. He was cold with fear, his feet planted to the ground. 

With a single, metallic punch, he witnessed the bots make feats like destroy multiple cars, or bring down a building. And at one time, a single blow was even enough to kill a family.

His family. 

Rounding a corner, a bot scanned him for a moment, its smooth head motionless. Alex held his breath, freezing in place and hoping it would​​ scan past him. 

“You will donate to The Cause?” it droned questioningly, stomping toward him and shaking his world. 

Alex stumbled back and fell to the ground. “No, no!”

“Donate to The Cause.” It was no longer asking.

The street memorized its footsteps as it crushed the distance between them and loomed over the ten-year-old. 

“I don’t have any money!” Alex said, panicked. 

“Inconsequential.” The bot reached down and held Alex up by his legs, shaking him as though searching for loose change. 

Nothing fell out, Alex screaming all the while. Another bot approached, stomping its way over and grabbing his arms. They pulled in opposite directions. It was unclear whether they were doing it on purpose or ignoring one another, but one thing was certain. 

Alex was being torn apart. 

His muscles screamed in protest, stretched to their breaking point, and he felt the searing pain of tiny tears. Crying out in agony, Alex began hoping for his life to end, just for the pain to stop there and not get any worse. 

Then, a bot disappeared. 

Flopping down in the arms of the other bot, Alex blinked from his upside down position. Two metal legs smoked where the bot was standing only an instant ago. A small hopeful smile on his face, Alex saw a young man with a flaming white head tear down from the sky, radiating pure energy. 

Lightcrown. 

Rearing a shining arm back, he thrust it into the bot and melted it from the inside. Alex fell from the malfunctioning bot releasing its grip and was immediately caught by a quick swipe of Lightcrown’s arm, placed gingerly on the ground in the span of a heartbeat. Alex wobbled slightly, unfocused. 

“Get out of here, it’s not safe,” Lightcrown told him and pointed. “You need to run as fast as you can. Go toward Hammerton Central.” 

“Can you come with me?” Alex clung to his leg. “I don’t wanna go by myself.”

Kneeling down, Lightcrown’s face was unreadable behind the warm light of flame. But there was a softness in his tone. 

“Sorry, buddy, but I have to go save more people. I need you to be brave and go. Now.”

Alex nodded. Lightcrown was already on the move, pivoting in place and blasting off with such force that Alex stumbled back. 

With mouth wide open, Alex remained in place, the scene capturing him more than his need to find safety. Lightcrown was fighting for him. Right there! And he was winning. The pinnacle of human potential. The apex display of the extraordinary in the robot-infested neighborhood. Alex wished he could help, but Lightcrown was the only one with incredible power. 

Two blocks down, another set of bots looked up as Lightcrown landed near them. One charged forward. Lightcrown became a blur and suddenly had his hand on the bot’s face. The next moment, the bot was like a crushed can of soda, tossed away. Lightcrown disposed of the second bot without seeming to notice it. Lightning arced from the powered young man and erupted into a powerful explosion, leaving no machine bits behind. 

Inching forward, Alex got a better view from behind a mound of rubble. 

Bots tackled Lightcrown from the air, but he was quick to spin in a tornado and fling them off, shredding them apart with abilities unknown. Like it was effortless for him to throw multiple powers at once, always ready for a new way to destroy the robots. 

Looking around at the dozens of bots in that one area alone, Alex felt a seed of hope  foster within him. Lightcrown was winning, and he got to see it all. Maybe this day wasn’t as bad as he originally thought. 

Then more bots tackled Lightcrown from the sky, and when he fought them away, Alex witnessed the first drops of blood fall from Lightcrown. His eyes widened slightly, his heart going tight. 

As though they had discovered their target, bots turned from their victims and raced in to smash into Lightcrown. One after another, they piled onto him like a football dog pile with no sense of preserving themselves. The bots would crash into him with such force, pieces would fly off as they squished further into him, each attacking with what limbs remained.

So many piled onto him that Alex couldn’t even see Lightcrown anymore. Fear gripping his chest, Alex stepped back and ran. 

But not before a scream emanated from the pile of bots and erupted into an explosion that swallowed him and everything around him. 

***

*Twelve Years Later - Present Day*

The most powerful man alive just wanted to have breakfast in peace. 

Utensils clinked around the small diner as Pinn chewed slowly on his French toast, exploring the taste with a sense of irritation. He’d consumed the same breakfast every day for months, but he never tired of the routine, always saving the sliced strawberry for last. It usually brought him a sense of calm and muted satisfaction to carry him through the day, but today was different. 

Someone was staring. Sensing him before he saw him, Pinn slowly raised his gaze to check who was entranced with him. From outside the large window, a kid no older than seventeen was beaming at Pinn, placing his hand on the window in wonder. He had short brown hair, striking green eyes, and a hint of a darker complexion. His attire was athletic, and he held an easy smile that showed off all of his white teeth. Pinn lowered his head, trying to get out of the feeling of his intense sight.

“Everything going okay today?” the waitress refilled his mug of coffee. 

Smile infectious, her dirty-blonde hair sat tied up on her head above her uniform. The diner provided her with a black shirt and long black skirt which she slid in with ease. A few pins were tucked into the hip of her uniform and she waited on her customer patiently. 

Pinn didn’t reply, keeping his face low. 

“Well, it’s good to see you, as always,” she said sweetly. 

Pinn cracked a smile, then hid it away in the same moment. Grinning slightly, the waitress went on her way. 

The kid entered the diner, his smile somehow stretching even wider as he approached. Eyes locked onto Pinn, he strode over, looking too eager. Closing his eyes, Pinn ground his teeth and sighed. 

“You’re him!” the young man exclaimed, taking a seat across from Pinn. 

He looked Pinn up and down, scanning from his black hair, to the hint of age on his face, to the lightly salted goatee with disheveled stubble across the rest of his chin. Pinn suddenly felt self conscious about his button-down shirt and khakis, feeling like he was being judged by the one dressed for athleticism. The two words were already too much enthusiasm from the stranger.

“Kid, no one invited you to sit down,” Pinn intoned.

“My name’s Sami. I thought you were dead,” he said, getting comfortable in the seat and placing a gallon jug of water on the table.

Pinn squinted at it, then tried to give Sami a contemptuous stare to scare him off. Sami seemingly ignored him and pulled out his phone. For an instant of dread, Pinn tensed up, ready to crush the device and throw Sami a hundred miles away. 

“What’s good?”

With confusion turned to relief, Pinn realized Sami was looking up the diner’s menu. Pinn relaxed, unbending his fork that he had just folded in half and setting it loudly on his plate. Sami continued to scroll undisturbed.  

“Hey, kid…” Pinn sighed.

“Sami.”

“We’re not friends. You’re close to half my age. I never invited you to sit down. I’d like to be left alone.”

“I’m good, thanks.” His attention was back on the menu. “Ew, gross, who would eat French toast? Do they not have crepes?” Sami leaned into his screen as he continued to scroll. 

Pinn set his teeth together and looked around with his eyes alone. No one was so close that they could overhear anything said. Heart beating nervously, he breathed deeply and steeled himself to be assertive.

“Kid, leave me alone, okay?” Pinn ordered quietly. 

Sami shuddered and glanced up, his smile faltering. Looking sheepish, he blinked before speaking. 

“Oh, my bad, you got the French toast? Embarrassing. But also gross. Who wants French sauce on their toast? Actually, is that where your powers come from?” Sami asked eagerly, speaking in rapid fire. 

Pinn blinked, stunned. It was clear at that point that the kid was Awakened.

“French sauce?” Pinn repeated. 

“Also, how come you’re not dead?” Sami asked, neck craned back to his phone. 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”

“Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone. But I gotta know!”

“Kid, whoever you think I am…”

“Name’s Sami!” Sami said happily, looking up from the screen as though introducing himself for the first time again. 

Pinn paused, closing his eyes and letting out a long stream of air. 

“I’m not who you think I am,” Pinn said, opening his eyes and sounding sincere. 

“Okay, then, who are you?”

“I’m the guy who wants to be left alone.”

“That means you *are *who I think you are. Unless you’re someone else. Are you? No. Right? I don’t think you are. Otherwise, you would probably be out there,” Sami said, flicking his head to the doorway.

Pinn said nothing, frowning at the boy. 

Sami was unperturbed, lowering his phone and placing it on the table to give Pinn his full attention. 

“I get it. You’re probably confused because we keep talking around it, but you’re Lightcrown, right? Actually, don’t answer that. It would ruin my image of you if you lied. Unless you were gonna confirm that you’re Lightcrown. Which I already know.” Sami smiled eagerly.

Pinn thought through his next set of words carefully. 

“What makes you think I’m someone you recognize?”

“I got three powers. Oops, I mean… I’m a Grade 3. I think? I don’t remember how HUE’s grade system works. It’s still kinda fresh.”

“You’re in HUE? Or that other one?” Pinn couldn’t help himself from asking, an eyebrow raised. And three powers so young? Not that he was one to talk. 

“No, not yet. Actually, I was on my way over to HUE.” Sami pulled a card out of his pocket and slapped it on the table. An invitation to try to become a member of the Hero Unification Entity. Depending on the angle of view, the card would change color, its edges shining with a holographic, prismatic effect. “Wait, this is a great opportunity! What should my name be? Lightcrown is cool. I want something like that!”

“A friend?” The waitress had returned, and Pinn lowered his head in mortification. 

Sami sat up straight and grinned politely. Leaning forward, he read the nametag on her uniform.

“Hi, Kelly! I’m ready to order! Do you guys have crepes?”

“Sorry, sweetie, but we don’t. If you wanna take a look at our menu…” Kelly began, but Sami was quick to jump in.

“Yeah, I already checked your menu, I just wanted to make sure you didn’t have a secret menu. That’s cool, can I get a bowl of grapes and a side of whipped cream?” 

Kelly tilted her head to the side, puzzled by the order, and took note. Almost automatically she looked like she would move away, but her brain caught her like a hook and she glanced between Sami and Pinn. Then she raised her eyebrows as an idea came to mind. 

“Would you mind telling me his name? He’s been coming daily for at least the past month, but won’t say! And he only pays in cash!” She pointed to Pinn with her check pad.

Pinn’s face was flushed red, eyes wide as he stared in horror at Sami. His cover was blown. He’d have to leave. Or do something more drastic. 

“I dunno. He hasn’t told me yet. But I’m paying, so maybe he’ll tell me,” Sami said good-naturedly as he pulled out a debit card. He stopped just shy of placing it on the table, looking at Pinn with concern. “You didn’t order like a hundred things before I showed up, right?”

“He didn’t,” Kelly assured him. 

“Then this one’s on me!” Sami’s grin returned at full force, slapping his debit card next to his HUE invitation card. 

Kelly took the card and walked away, smiling to herself. Swallowing hard, Pinn cleared his throat and kept his eyes on the strawberry next to his French toast. 

“Thanks,” he muttered. 

“Don’t mention it. I have at least twenty dollars in the bank,” Sami said, sounding as though he was genuinely bragging.

“I meant about…” Pinn trailed and checked around with his eyes again. “Not telling her your *hypothesis* about who I am.”

“Oh, no, it’s not a hypothesis. You’re Lightcrown. I noticed how you quietly freaked out when I pulled out my phone. You thought I was gonna take a picture, right?” 

Pinn remained stone faced, but Sami was absolutely right. The young man continued as he slipped his phone into his pocket.

“That’s what really sold me. One of my powers is to see the number of powers someone has. It’s like… I dunno, like clouds over people’s heads, kinda. Bubbles of thick mist? It’s usually like a bubble or two, one for each power. And they vary in color and size, some are brighter than others. And I think the bigger it is, the more powerful? I’m not sure, I only just gained this power. Well, anyway, I saw the stuff over your head and you freaked out over a potential photo, which means you’re famous. Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone. You probably have your reasons.” Sami sounded so sincere that Pinn believed him. 

Pinn raised an eyebrow. There was no hiding now. But he was still curious to know more about Sami’s assessment of him. It might help.

“How many of those clouds do you see above me?”

“Oh, I have no idea. It’s a storm up there, just a straight-up hurricane localized right there.” Sami stared somewhere just above Pinn’s dark hair. “Dozens. Hundred? More? Like I said, no idea.”

“I see.”

“Also, I thought you were like a curmudgeonly old man, but I think you’re just bad at talking to people. Are you really shy? Or do you have social anxiety? Wait, that might be the same thing. Even then, you’ve been coming here forever and never told Kelly your name?” Sami asked, amused. 

Pinn pressed his lips tight, looking around with his eyes to make sure Kelly didn’t overhear what Sami just said. 

“I’m not old,” Pinn muttered. 

“Dude, you’re like… forty. That’s super old,” Sami assured him. 

Pinn’s eyebrows flinched in offense. “I’m a decade younger than that and forty isn’t old.”

“Why haven’t you told her your name? She clearly likes you. Well, maybe not *likes* you, but definitely *likes* you, you know?” Sami took a swig of water from his jug with a knowing smile on his face. 

As his face warmed in embarrassment, Pinn was having a hard time following what the kid wanted from him. Pinn wasn’t really sure what he wanted, beyond chatting. With narrow eyes, Pinn was looking for the angle, now that the kid held the knowledge of Lightcrown in front of him. Sami didn’t even dwell on his questions very long, jumping from subject to subject. It didn’t feel like he was getting grilled for more information. More like the kid was a fan and just wanted the chance to talk to him.

Despite himself trying to remain distant, Pinn was warming up to the kid. 

“I can’t tell her,” Pinn said finally. 

“That’s cool. You can tell her some other way,” Sami said, perfectly understanding. “You could *accidentally *drop your platinum status credit card and show her you’re loaded.”

“I don’t have a platinum card.”

“You can drop your *gold* credit card.”

Pinn said nothing. 

“Regular credit card?” Sami asked, starting to sound concerned. 

Pinn still said nothing. Though his face remained emotionless, amusement at the young man’s antics flickered within him. Sami’s eyebrows had descended, deep in consternation. He was clearly having a hard time thinking of another flashy way to reveal the name.

“We can go with the original plan. You just tell me and I’ll tell her,” Sami said, finally. 

“No.”

“Well, it was worth a shot,” Sami shrugged and began chugging his water, Pinn watching warily. 

When he was halfway through the gallon of water, Kelly returned and placed a bowl of grapes, whipped cream, and Sami’s debit card in front of him. Without missing a beat, Sami slammed some water down and grabbed the bowl of grapes, upending it and dumping its entire contents into his mouth at once. Kelly giggled lightly and Pinn cracked a smile, closing his eyes to prevent laughter at the display of fruit bulging at Sami’s cheeks. 

“Any luck with the name?” Kelly asked. 

“Mmm-mmm.” Sami shook his head, smiling as he chewed. 

“That’s a shame. Maybe next time,” Kelly replied with a charmed eyebrow raised to Pinn. 

Pinn dashed the smile from his face and turned away, abashed. Sami swallowed down the food with a loud gulp and scooped the entirety of the whipped cream into his mouth with a spoon he grabbed from Pinn’s side of the table. Washing it all down with more water, Sami checked the time on his phone. His eyes widened, and he stood to leave, grabbing his cards and scribbling thirty-three cents under the “tip” portion of the receipt. Together with the bill, the total was an even twenty dollars.

“Next time!” Sami agreed, wiping his hand across his mouth as he exhaled contentedly.

“Next time?” Pinn asked. 

With a mock salute of two fingers tapped against his temple, Sami spun and left Pinn without another word. Kelly waved goodbye and went to address other customers. Pinn blinked, astonished at Sami leaving so soon. 

Nothing more than plain conversation. Possibly even pleasant conversation. Where Pinn was certain the intrusion would leave him annoyed, he instead found himself wishing it would have lasted just a bit longer. He stared down at his unfinished French toast, then popped the strawberry in his mouth, savoring it. Eating it earlier made it taste even better than usual. 

*Next time.*

For the first time in years, Pinn thought he may have made a friend.

1maui3b,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_erepresent/comments/1maui3b/compostable_coffee_bags_the_sustainable_choice/,Compostable Coffee Bags: The Sustainable Choice for Eco-Conscious Coffee Lovers,"As coffee consumption continues to rise globally, so does the impact of the coffee industry on the environment. For eco-conscious coffee lovers, making sustainable choices has never been more important. One such choice gaining popularity is switching to compostable coffee bags. These bags not only offer a solution to reduce waste but also play a crucial role in preserving the environment. Here's why compostable coffee bags are the sustainable choice for those who care about the planet.

# 1. Eco-Friendly Materials

Traditional coffee bags are often made from plastic or other non-biodegradable materials, which can take hundreds of years to break down in landfills. On the other hand, compostable coffee bags are crafted from plant-based materials such as cornstarch, cellulose, or other biodegradable substances. These bags decompose naturally in composting conditions, leaving no harmful residue behind. By using compostable bags, you are directly reducing your environmental footprint.

# 2. Reducing Single-Use Plastic

Plastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental issues of our time. Every year, millions of tons of plastic waste end up in oceans, harming marine life and polluting natural habitats. Compostable coffee bags offer a simple yet effective alternative to traditional plastic packaging. They contribute to reducing the reliance on single-use plastics, making them a key player in the fight against plastic pollution.

# 3. Promoting a Circular Economy

Compostable coffee bags are an excellent example of how we can embrace the principles of a circular economy. Instead of creating waste, these bags can be composted at home or in industrial composting facilities. This process helps return valuable nutrients to the soil, enriching it for future use. By choosing compostable bags, you are contributing to a system where materials are continuously reused and regenerated, rather than discarded.

# 4. Supporting Sustainable Agriculture

The materials used to create compostable coffee bags often come from sustainable agricultural practices. Many manufacturers source their biodegradable materials from farms that prioritize environmental responsibility, such as those practicing organic farming or using regenerative farming methods. By supporting products made with these materials, you are indirectly promoting the growth of sustainable agriculture.

# 5. The Future of Coffee Packaging

As more coffee brands and consumers become aware of the environmental impact of traditional packaging, compostable coffee bags are becoming the future of coffee packaging. By making this small switch, you contribute to a larger movement toward reducing waste, protecting the environment, and encouraging more sustainable practices in the coffee industry.

In conclusion, compostable coffee bags are the perfect choice for eco-conscious coffee lovers. They reduce waste, support sustainable agriculture, and promote a healthier planet. So, the next time you’re shopping for your favorite brew, consider opting for compostable coffee bags to make a positive impact on the environment.",1,1753642846.0,u_erepresent,0,1.0,False

1maug9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1maug9y/whos_the_actual_arsehole/,Who’s the actual arsehole 🤷🏻‍♀️,"So I don't even know how to start this off. This is long, boring and complicated hahaha. 
I (35f) have never really had a great relationship with my dad (54m); he divorced my mom when I was around 2 years old. He always said he tried to see me, but my mom made it impossible. All of Daddy's supposed actions are remembered by my older brother, but not by me. 

When I was around 10, my dad had met a woman; let's call her Carol. I think she was 22/23 at that time. She was quiet and shy and didn't really speak. They got married after 6 months; everything was apparently booked. I didn't know at the time, but a week before the wedding, they went and got married with just two witnesses because she didn't want her mom at the wedding. 
On the day of the wedding, still nobody knows they are actually already married. Getting ready, I didn't get asked to be a bridesmaid, but I had a lovely bridesmaids dress on. We all get to the registry office and see a note pinned on the door: Everyone just meet at the venue. We get to the venue with Dad, and Carol is sitting there grinning. When the majority of the family is there, they blurt out they got married a week ago, and now it's time to celebrate it. I left within an hour; I was pretty annoyed I wasn't a part of his wedding. I wasn't born when my mom and dad got married, so it would have been nice to be a part of this one. I explained to my dad how I felt and alls he could say was it was what carol wanted so that’s what they did and that’s the end of it, everyone was still able to celebrate. 
The marriage didn't last long anyway, 5 years in total, I think. It turns out Carol loved the bottle more than she let on. My dad's not a drinker, so he could only take so much of that one, hahaha. 

At home my mom becomes unbearable to live with; all she does is sleep. She never cooks or cleans. If she is awake, she will cause an argument over nothing. She finds out I have a boyfriend 18 months older than me, and she starts screaming at me, You're this, you're that, so I tell her I'm moving out to live with my boyfriend, and I start packing. She starts throwing my things at me, so I phone my dad and tell him what's going on. He said he will come and pick me up, and I can live with him because he is ""not letting my 15-year-old daughter live with a guy she's just met."" I picked up the one bag I packed and ran out to my boyfriend's flat. My dad was blowing up my phone. I wasn't answering. He left me a voice note saying it won't be difficult for him to find a name and address. I don't know how he found out, but within 15 minutes his car pulled up, and my dad and his friend got out of the car. We could hear him shouting up to the flats, ""My name if I have to knock on every door, I will."" He did exactly that. We could hear him at the neighbours asking if they knew my boyfriend. He found me, haha, and off to Daddy's I went. He gave me a long lecture about how he's only trying to protect me. That I'm his only daughter and he will always love me. 

A few months go by, and Dad seems to be going out a lot over the weekends. Apparently he's been having a lot of fun with the ladies, if you know what I mean. Now I know my dad is not ugly; he has always had the females double-looking. I would never let my friends around him because I didn't like them saying he was ""fit,"" but seriously, I don't want the thought of my dad sleeping with the world. 
A couple of years go by. I've moved out of Dad's. I'm now living with my boyfriend, expecting our first child, a baby girl. 
My dad is ecstatic. My mom, not so much. My dad is like, Give me a list of what you need, and I will buy it. So off he goes. I'm round my nan's house; my mom is there, and I'm showing my nan some of the baby stuff from my dad. and my mom opens her mouth and says, Tell your dad we don't want anything from him. I told her I wasn't going to do that because my dad is excited, and he's willing to buy this stuff for his first granddaughter, so my mom stopped and said, You think I don't care. I said, Well, you haven't up to now, and she left with her fake tears. I'm too pregnant for her dramatics, tbh. It must have been 4 or 5 days later; my mom wanted me to go round to her house because she wanted to show me something. I hesitated and said I was busy for a little bit. and would be round soon. I went round, and she opened the door and told me to close my eyes. I said, Mom, I'm too tired for this. What's up?. I walked into her living room; no word of a lie, she had bought everything my dad had bought, but better. So I texted my dad, saying I didn't need a few of the things he bought because I already had them. Now he wasn't bothered; he just sent them back. 

A couple of weeks go by and we're doing the baby's room. I'm not feeling too good. I phone my midwife just to be on the safe side. She tells me I need to go to the hospital straight away, so I, my boyfriend, and my mom go, and they tell me at the scan it shows my placenta rupturing; I need an emergency C-section. After 45 minutes my beautiful tiny 5 lb 4 oz Rose is born. My boyfriend posted my beautiful baby girl on my social media, introducing her. The post had already been up before I realised I hadn't told Dad! By the time I had texted him a photo of my beautiful daughter, Dad had already found out from his sister, who asked him why he hadn't told her. He said he didn't know I even had the baby. I apologised over and over; he said he understood I was in a little baby bubble and he would get to snuggle her in real life, and that is all that matters. As time passes, we're all home and settled. Dad's besotted; he's round all the time, always with a bag full of presents for baby Rose. We go for little days out to the zoo, swimming, and baby parks. 

When my daughter is around 2, it's Christmas time, and my dad has suggested we go see Santa. We're waiting in line, and my dad's phone keeps pinging. He pulls his phone out and starts smiling at it. I ask what he's smiling about; he says, Oh, nothing. I laughed and said, No, go on. Who's making you smile? He told me he had met someone, but he wasn't putting a label on it because at the minute they are just having fun. The lines are getting smaller. My dad's still smiling at his phone. It's our turn with Santa; he takes some photos, and we head to the cafe for a coffee and cake. I kept quizzing him about who this woman is and where she was from; he wasn't budging. 

It's now July, and my dad is now in a full-blown relationship with someone I know nothing about. Now I've gone from seeing him 5 times a week to 3 times a week. I tell my dad. I think it's time we all meet the new girlfriend. He arranges to meet at his mom's house. I go round, and there is this young girl sitting on the sofa. She's the same age as me! She's a petite little thing, nothing like my mom or his ex. She lived about 30 minutes away from us, with no kids of her own but a niece a month younger than my Rose, who she treats like her own. My dad was arranging to go on days out with the girls. They could have sleepovers, so I could have a break to myself. I stopped him right there and said I don't trust anyone with my daughter. I said my daughter wouldn't be going to sleepovers or days out if I wasn't there. My brother and my friend said I was being a little too overprotective, but I think I should be there making those memories too. My dad moves his girlfriend and niece into his house; let's call the niece Amber. 
Amber gets a fully kitted-out new bedroom my daughter didn't get a bedroom made up. I see photos/videos; they've gone on a random day out and just driven somewhere. My dad's excuse was, ""I texted and asked, but you were busy. What else can I do?"" My dad knows I like routine, and every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday I go to my mom's side of the family's house for dinner. So I said he could have done it tomorrow and asked me then. He then texts me a shitty message saying, “my life doesn't revolve around your routine I ask and ask and get nowhere."" 
We had a back and two texting row, and I told him that I think it's unfair how Amber gets spoilt and taken to all these places and my rose has to miss out. So I told him to choose between his new girlfriend and me and Rose. 
He texted me back, saying why would he finish her when she's done absolutely nothing wrong? I was fuming with that reply. I rang him, screaming, I'm sick of you putting women before me; I should come first., He said, I will always come first, but I am not dictating who he can and can't be with; she's done nothing wrong to anyone. I hung up. 
I spoke to a few family members about it, and apparently she's really lovely, and my dad has never been happier. She treats him like he's never been treated before. He tries to call and FaceTime me daily, but I don't answer. My mom's side is telling me to stick to my guns—it won't last—and my dad's side is telling me I'm out of order and I'm only hurting my dad in all this. I literally don't have any time for him when he is still with her. I think I see him 3/4 times a year on an occasion because my daughter shouldn't miss out on birthdays or Christmas. Anyway, it's been almost 6 years; they are still together, and I hear through the grapevine they are getting married I still haven’t been told. I apologise for this long-ass post and thank you if you're still here, haha. But anyway who's the actual arsehole 🤷🏻‍♀️",1,1753642729.0,AITAH,4,1.0,False

I am docent looking, but more innocent, girly type, not what he usually goes for. Recently me and her got our law school acceptence letters and found out he was applying too, it is well known i wanted to go to law school and he always wanted to study economics.

He interrupted my and Amelia's call to say that he is so proud, that I was probably 1st on the list, that I will do amazing etc. They both recorded a voice messege, sth about college, and he praised me in it and talked shit about a girl i was complaining to my bff about that day. Now, he will double major to be able to do both law and economics, neither me or Amelia know why. Today Amelia, her baby brother and her parents visited me for coffee, champagne and cake, as a celebration.

2. I am not even sure is he likes me and if I should even worry.

Really painful cramps, dizziness, headache. I asked my husband (31M) to drive me to the store (2 minutes away) because I didn’t feel safe driving. He said yes — no big drama, all was okay.

Before I told him I had my period, he asked if I was planning to cook dinner. I said no, obviously — not in this state. At the store, he wanted sandwiches, but since I was paying and money’s tight for me, I suggested a frozen pizza instead because it was cheaper.

He complained about the pizza (again). Like he always does. Not enough toppings, too dry, crust is bad. He finds something wrong with literally every meal I cook or buy. A few weeks ago I painted our outdoor shed pink to make it look better — of course, he said it looked like crap. It’s like anything I do is worthless to him.

He constantly tells me I “do nothing” or “sleep all day,” even though I’ve completed two bachelor’s degrees, learned his language (I speak four total) when we lived in his country, and worked and studied at the same time. According to him, my work “wasn’t real” because I didn’t work as much as he did.

Now that we’re back in my home country, I’ve been focusing on my mental health (I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder) and finished my degree. I’m also dealing with a very difficult family situation — my father is a drug addict and I was raised in an abusive household. Since we moved here, I’ve had to face all that again, and it hasn’t helped my mental health.

I try to do what I can, but I can’t always look or feel happy. I have horrible insomnia and sometimes I don’t fall asleep until morning, even with medication. So yes, I sleep late. But what he doesn’t see is the time I spend studying, cleaning, and fixing things around the house.

I don’t ask him for money. I use my own (disability + savings) to pay for the food I eat, for our pets, household items, and internet. I clean the entire house, do all the laundry, take out the trash. I do everything at home. He’s a carpenter, so sure, he’s done some things around the house when necessary — maybe twice a year. He pays the utility bills (gas, water, electricity) when they come in, but he doesn’t lift a finger otherwise.

Any time I ask him to do something simple — like go for coffee, go out together, spend time — he says he’s tired and needs to relax. Even on days when he doesn’t work at all. I eventually gave up asking, because I already know what the answer will be.

He even forgot my birthday.

Today I just broke. I told him I was tired of the complaining, tired of feeling like nothing I do is ever enough. I said, “No wonder I don’t want to have sex with you — you suck the life out of me.” That’s exactly how I feel.

When we lived abroad, I used to initiate intimacy all the time and he constantly rejected me — this went on for six years. Now that I’ve stopped trying and we’ve moved back here, suddenly he wants it — but I don’t. I feel nothing. I feel invisible. I feel like I’m just here to serve, clean, feed him, and absorb criticism.

He says I’m overreacting and that I “take things too personally.” When I try to talk, he says he doesn’t want to argue — but for me, it’s not arguing. I barely ever raise my voice unless I’m deeply provoked. I usually speak calmly, but he just gets irritated over everything I say.

1. I always start small. If I'm feeling overwhelmed, I don't force myself into a two-hour session. I tell myself, ""Just 15 minutes."" Honestly, 90% of the time, those 15 minutes turn into an hour because I get into a flow. It tricks my brain into starting.

2. I pretend I'm making a TikTok. For real! If I can explain a complex idea in 60 seconds (or even 3 minutes), then I really understand it. I’ll even record myself sometimes, just for the practice of condensing information.
 
3. I change my scenery, often. My brain gets bored easily. So, I'll take my stuff to a coffee shop, then maybe just to a different chair in my apartment. Even a small change helps me reset and focus.
 
3. I build in tiny rewards. After going through a tough concept or finishing a chapter, I give myself a 5-minute break to scroll TikTok, grab a snack, or just stare out the window. It keeps me motivated.

4. I let myself be bad at it, at first. There's this pressure to get everything right immediately. But I've learned that making mistakes and struggling is part of the process. 

5. I write everything, literally everything down and try to read through the notes at the end of the day.

Considering that I'm a female and this is Tunisia, there aren't lots of places I can run while feeling safe/comfortable. Cité olympique is the closest nice and safe running place but it's kinda far so I drve my bike around 3 times a week there, part of the workout.

One day I stopped at a coffee shop after training, parked my bike outside, secured it with a lock where it could be seen by the security camera and close to the tables outside. I couldn't sit at the tables outside because they were all full so I had to go inside. 

Around 2h later I went out to find that my bike was no longer there. I guess the person who stole it waited and waited for the right moment to break the security lock and take it. 

(Turns out that the security cameras were accessories and don't really work so my bike is forever gone)

I hate the we live with people that would see me from a distance, while I'm completely unaware, and decide I'm their next target. Or that these people would wait and wait with the sole intention of breaking and stealing. I hate that mugging and stealing are like olympic sports among young people who compete to see who comes back with a bigger bounty. 

I used to fear that a delinquent teen literally half my age (I'm 28) definitely taller than me (I'm 160cm) would stop me and take my bike away and I would be able to do absolutely nothing about it. Then I would push this fear away and tell myself it's irrational as long as I avoid certain places and certain hours of the day. Now I lost the little sense of security I had. I quit running, I don't leave the house much anymore (I work a remote job so don't really need to). It's been a while and Idk what to do about it. 

If you had a similar incident, how did you deal with it?",5,1753641760.0,Tunisia,4,0.86,False

# CHAPTER 1

“Come on baby, we’re going to be late!”. I quickly put on my lipstick. The corners smeared again, my fourth attempt. I muttered a swear word under my breath, then took a napkin and wiped most of it off. I grabbed my purse and rushed downstairs, Henry waited tapping his foot impatiently with his polished black shoes and tailored grey suit. I followed him out to the car. He held my door open, my dress almost got caught. He got in and slammed his door. “What the hell took you so long?” He murmured to the shiny dashboard. I pretended not to hear him while fixing my hair with the mirror in my purse. The engine started to roar and we were on our way. Heat was hitting my face as the car sped up, the sky turning to a shy pink. Henry got out his sunglasses at a traffic light and turned the radio on. “And the new hit single by: Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons!” the radio chimed. Some terribly sappy song blasted through the speakers. “At long last last love has arrived, and I thank God I’m alive…” My stomach turned. I wished people would stop pretending to feel such things about others. “I love this song.” Henry said more to himself than me, his eyes on the road. I could feel the fabric of my dress stick to my skin. The dense evening wind was messing up the little preparation I hoped I had. The smell of the gasoline made me nauseous. “Will the Hethersons be there?” I tried asking Henry casually after a few minutes. “Joe and Ruth? I think so.”. “You think so?” I repeated, a little mockingly. “Want me to keep track of every single office worker in the whole damn company?”, his knuckles turned whiter on the steering wheel. We were still getting over me overbaking the strawberry gelatin cake he was supposed to bring to the office. Henry didn’t yell, or hit, he never did those things, I was lucky and I knew that. But he’d stop talking. He’d stay overtime, or arrange more meetings, or go to bars alone. He didn’t look at me once through the whole car ride except through the rearview mirror. I looked at him. I looked at his slicked back gelled hair, his perfect tie hanging just tight enough on his neck, his freshly shaved beard, his chiselled nose and chin. He looked good, more importantly, he thought he looked good too.

When we arrived a young man in a simple black suit opened our door, two others were standing by the gates of the grand white building. The venue was extremely large and posh. The company must be doing quite well this season, I thought. Chandeliers hung high from decorated ceilings, velvet tablecloths and white bouquets were placed perfectly on tables. For moments the silver cutlery blinded me. Many couples were already inside, and the collective noise of the whispering chatter was deafening. Everything was a beige or black tone, and my red dress made me look like a prostitute. Somewhere a live band was playing a fast jazz piece. Every other wife I could see looked so effortless, effortless yet all older than me, I reminded myself. The stupid dress was too tight around my stomach. I looked around to see I had lost Henry five minutes in. Tall men and women gathered around small round tables, toasting to God knows what and laughing, roaring like lions in a grand feast of a herd of antelope. Sharp grins and tailored suits and heavy perfumes and colognes masked something rotting. Occasionally, their eyes would shift and scan the crowd, pinning me. After walking around like a lost child for minutes, “Ruth!” I proclaimed loudly, too glad to see a familiar face in the crowd.

Ruth wore her navy shift and worn out silk gloves with pearl earrings that overwhelmed her large ears. I could swear I saw her in this same outfit before. She looked respectable yet out of fashion, like her husband earned their last dime a decade ago. Joseph was younger than Ruth, and did very little to hide it. His perfectly combed hair would effortlessly fall above his hazel eyes that would start winking at every young waitress unfortunate enough to serve him after two whiskey sodas. His new tailored suit made the both of them look like a tired mother with her slimy teenage son, his oily gaze already lingering on the young women in the crowd. “Darling, so good to see you.” Ruth chippered. I hugged both of them. “You always look better and better.” Ruth said. I replied something I can’t recall. “I seem to have lost Henry.” We all chuckled in that perfectly posh way. It was unsteady on my feet.

Ruth started making smalltalk, I talked along before Joseph roared at the sight of someone. “Hugh!” he yelled, hugging a man, I thought I imagined seeing Ruth roll her eyes for a moment. Hugh shook Ruth’s hand respectfully before turning to me. He was a young man, looked to be around my age. Dark hair gelled back, he had a whimsy about him. Some other girl might have even thought him handsome. “And who do I have the pleasure of meeting?” His voice had a high pitched, sympathetic ring. “Slow down buddy, she’s married.” Joseph laughed at his own joke. I shifted on my feet. Hugh turned as red as a tomato. “Mrs. Henry Ross.” I said assuredly. His smile never wavered as he shook my hand. “My pleasure.” he said. “I’ll be honest with you Mrs. Ross, I don’t know how I seem to have ended up at this party.”. He was talking only to me now. I laughed quietly, “How do you mean?”. “You see,” he looked around and lowered his voice, “I’m just a lowly painter.” This time I laughed louder, “A lowly painter? I never heard of any” I said, eyeing his perfect silky cashmere suit. He shook his head and smiled “I’m not exactly keeping IBM in business. You’re too kind.”. Looking in his green eyes, I heard Ruth say something to me and turned my head towards her before my eyes followed. The boys began speculating about the new Mike Nichols picture, stray questions about riots and Supreme Court judges filled my ears, agreements and disagreements were trivial. The night dragged on and on and lingered like a painting of melting clocks Henry dragged me around all day to show me in a museum once. The heat inside was unbearable even with the open windows and the night breeze. A hot topic of conversation became Joe and Ruth’s upcoming vacation to Italy, followed by Hugh telling a story of how his summer girlfriend in France turned out to be married with four children. Ruth blushed as he told it. I acted appalled at the appropriate times. Against the monotonous conversation of the guests, I liked Hugh’s irrelevant banter. I stayed by him.

A round of martinis and a painfully boring conversation with Ruth later I finally found Henry again. “Where were you?” he said in a cold whisper. “Where was *I*?” I started before he cut me off. “I want you to meet my new associates.” He said louder, turning his back and smiling. The jazz song playing was a jumbled mess. A line of men stood. How boring and dumb they all looked. I went around shaking their hands (“Pleased to meet you.”): Two bald men in dark mohair suits, one short man in a gray tuxedo, two who had removed their suit jackets lest they sweat a single improper second, all accompanied by funny names I instantly forgot, and… A woman. The first thing one noticed was her stature. She towered over the junior execs, over me, yet Henry still loomed. She had luscious blonde hair that perfectly draped on her shoulders. Clad in her smart attire, right off a magazine, her blouse hung loosely on her torso, her skirt covered her slender thighs, her socks were the perfect shade of brown, her buckled black shoes shined brand new with the bright candle light; all that allure while looking so very professional. Looking at her, it was obvious why my dress clung to me so awkwardly. Her perfume was familiar, notes of amber and bergamot surrounded me. She was about to open her mouth to speak. Her slim neck connected to a narrow sharp jaw, her blush light on her smooth cheeks. Her nose was straight but small, her eyebrows perfectly arched. Her eyes, her eyes pierced deep into my whole being, two thundering oceans that created light, upturned and looking directly at me. As she leaned in, a deeper scent of peachy jasmine took a hold of me. Finally, her voice struck me like balm over a fresh burn, flowing out of her wide lips covered with the perfect shade of dark red lipstick.

“Nice to meet you, Kathy.” I let the words ring out in my brain for a few seconds before shaking her gloved hand, warm to the touch. As our eyes met, the band hit their most dissonant chord yet. The song had been building up for minutes, this was the coarse climax, the awkward tone hung high in the ceiling among the crystal chandeliers. She was smiling, she was smiling at me. She continued, “I’m Joan.”. Joan, Joan… the name was so familiar, like I had heard it a thousand times before, regarding her. My voice came out so feeble in comparison. “Nice to meet you too…” was all I could think to say. Before I knew it, the second passed and Henry was scooting me around to introduce to new people. The song came to an abrupt end. After another line of men, I looked back but she was nowhere to be seen. The night carried on as the band started slowing down their music looking so snug and proud of themselves, the dreaded Sinatra sound started to echo through the party.

Henry held out his hand. “Something in your eyes was so inviting, something in your smile…” I was dancing very professionally, I had practiced months and months before our wedding, I had practiced long days when Henry stayed late in the office with nothing but the broom handle and the little radio on. “You did great tonight, darling.” He whispered in my ear. I smiled. Then, the image of her came to me again, and my smile was wiped straight off my lips. I tripped on my feet, Henry’s arms held me in place for a moment like a straightjacket. I wanted to vanish. Finally the song came to an end. “Play California Dreamin!” Joe’s voice bellowed from the back, dancing with yet another strange girl. The crowd erupted in laughter. I thought the venue might cave in and kill us all, I imagined Joan standing upright in the rubble over all our mangled bodies like that one scene in Steamboat Bill Jr.

After two more rounds of cocktails and the rumour that Joe’s crew had spiked one of the punch bowls (“for a zing”), people started to leave. The sun had long set over the wide plateau but the light inside must have been half of the city's supply of electricity. Throughout the night, I looked over my shoulder, thinking I saw her in corners, in crowds, but she was never there when I looked again. We were saying goodbye and getting in the car. All the lights and the sounds and smells were blinding me, I wished I had drunk more but it wasn’t proper beyond the fashionable drink in hand to stand smiling beside your husband. The breeze was finally cool and calming. Hugh smiled at me one last time. “Au revoir.” he said. I chuckled. His smile lingered as he watched us leave. I wondered if she was still smiling too; she, who was nowhere to be seen. In the car’s window, I thought I saw a strand of blonde wavy hair flash.

“Who was that?” I asked when we had driven a comfortable distance away from the party. From everything I wanted to know about her, that was probably the dumbest question to ask first and an instant flood of regret washed over me. “Who?” said Henry, not taking his eyes off the road.

# CHAPTER 2

I cracked the eggs. *“The blonde woman?”*, I had said. Henry had a blank stare. *“The one with your new associates? Joan, I think she said her name was.”.* The toast was burning. Henry was taking off his tie, he didn't even look at me. *“What about her?”* he asked, uninterested. His clothes were dumped in a pile. I washed the coffee pot. What followed was a two minute interrogation of Henry playing dumb that ended with him walking out mid sentence to the bathroom and shutting the door, so I dropped it. I pretended to be asleep by the time he came out, I could hardly bear sleeping in the same bed. I heard him take out a glass and pour something.

“Morning, darling.” Henry kissed me, he had come downstairs. “Morning.” I said and quickly turned back to cooking. Henry didn’t notice. He had taken a shower, his newspaper was in one hand, with the other he poured himself coffee and sat down on the table. I plated the breakfast. My heart was burning up, I wanted to, I had to ask him, but all questions were so futile after last night. I sat down. “Great band they had, huh?”. Henry shot me a look, a school teacher reprimanding rowdy boys. “Yeah.”, he said; eyes on the newspaper in front of him, mouth stuffed full with the eggs. “Anything new from work?”. “I don’t know”, he said, “I’m going to work *today*, aren’t I?”. His tone wasn’t scolding, I wished it was. He was talking as he would to a child. Then, I looked at him. His appearance stopped me dead in my tracks. He looked so old. His greying strands among the dark blond were striking, his eyes looked glossed over like a blind dog’s, his cheeks hollowing and pale skin that had begun to sag. But through all of it, he was so handsome. Maybe more than the day I had met him.

I didn’t hear Henry leave for work. I was upstairs, ironing his shirts. In the back of the wardrobe was his white and maroon western shirt that I always thought looked blocky on him. I touched the worn out fabric. He wore it the day we met with his linen shorts and brown saddle shoes, clean shaven with his tinted sunglasses and a new flat cap. He seemed a lost man, an aimless war veteran, pressured by his family to marry someone in his calibre, endlessly bored by their picks for a wife. He was on a mission to find himself in the great American West, passing over my hometown where I served them in the small diner near my house in my after school shift, with a new Kerouac by his side and two of his best friends in the new Cadillac gifted by his father; I remember my mother excitedly giving me her best dresses when I told her who I’d met. I dusted his books. Then his trumpet. Then our wedding photo. We looked so happy; me in the pearl white dress his mother gave me (*“Oh Katharine, I picked this out when Henry was 8!”*), him in his charcoal suit. I wondered if we ever smiled so wide again. My face, puffy and grinning wide; his smile, his very faint stubble. Then, suddenly, the image shattered and I saw his face as it was at the party, and I saw her. I saw her, with her hand on his back, burning eyes looking at me; they looked incredible together. I thought a single word off her lips and I’d crumble. I couldn’t take it anymore, I picked up the telephone and called Ruth.

The rest of the day I tried to distract myself. I tried doing all the housework, the clock was barely ticking by, then once over. I washed the clothes, I cleaned and scrubbed and dried and cleaned again and cooked. Folding our outfits from the party, I realized my dress from the party had a sneaky dark red wine stain. Late in the evening the lamb was ready, the windows were sparkling, the clothes were folded. I was slumped on the dining room chair, mindlessly switching radio stations, avoiding the distorted electric guitars, trying not to think of anything at all. I heard Henry on the driveway, I got up, leaving the radio on playing some guitar part I couldn’t register yet. I still felt paralyzed. Henry must have snuck in. I first heard him hum the melody. Then, I felt his long arms over me with my back turned to the door. He started softly singing the song into my ear. “When she walks, she’s like a samba that swings so cool…” I turned to face him. His face looked… happy? His demeanor changed. “How… can he tell her he loves her?” He was lifting his eyebrows and feigning agony. “Stop it.” I said. “Yes, he would give his heart gladly” he was rocking me now. I pulled away. He pulled me right back from the waist, gripping tight. “But each day when she walks to the sea, she looks straight ahead, not at him.” “I said stop!” I was smiling and yelling. Henry reached over to the radio. The woman singing lastly said, “Tall and…”. The next station was playing “Sway”. We had danced to it two anniversaries ago. “Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore…” His one hand was on my waist, his other clasped mine, my other on his tall shoulder. He was gently moving me around. I was giggling. Thirty seconds later he swirled me around, my nose searched for his cologne for a moment. “When’s the last time you moved like this, darling?”. Then, his every move was more exaggerated, until he tipped me over and kissed me, his hand way lower than in public, I was flushed dark red. My hands were digging into his neck. I hummed at the taste of bergamot on his lips. We lingered for a few seconds, still in place. “I don’t know what you did,” I said. “but you’re forgiven.” He smiled at me and let go. “What a blatant accusation!”, he pretended to be offended while removing his tie. I turned off the radio and followed him upstairs. Later, as I watched him draft off to sleep, glazed over with the pale midnight moon, I brushed off a single long strand of blonde hair off his collar.

\*\*\*

We were sitting at the small balcony of the café Ruth had picked out. Our coffees were going cold and a low Dusty Springfield song played inside. A strong breeze made the frail woman in front of me shiver every now and then. She had almost cried telling me she and Joe still couldn’t get pregnant for the fiftieth time. I was consoling her, smoking her cigarettes. “Anyway.” Ruth said. “Anyway, all in God’s plan.”. I shook my head. She took a puff, an inexplicable gush of amber hit me. She was absent mindedly looking at the two little kids playing around down in the courtyard. Ruth reached for a napkin, I for another cigarette. “Oh by the way,” her face looked lighter. “That woman, Joan?” I stood up straight, I had begun to doubt she was real. “Yes?” I blurted out a little faster than I would have liked. “I finally heard some things about her.” My chest was feeling hot. I really hoped I didn’t look it. I tried to imagine some boring trivial thing to distract myself but Ruth’s voice dragged me right back.

“She’s apparently in her 30’s, one said 30, one said 35.” 30? 30 was good, I thought. 30 was older than me. No wait, 30 was older than me, when I already looked like a clumsy school girl in front of the headmistress. I took a puff. “Unmarried, all seemed to agree on that.” Ruth had a glimmer in her eye; she could, and did, gossip about any and everyone. Who did she gossip about me with? I coughed on my cigarette. “Unmarried?” I didn’t need to mask my interest. She nodded. “One mentioned she lived with a companion but I would take that with a grain of salt.” I was grinding my teeth. “Anything else?” I was back to sounding bored. “Not much,” she said. I hoped I hid my disappointment by putting out my cigarette. “great at her job, I heard.” Shocker. But how? “Is she, you know, *friendly* with some of the executives?” I asked, lowering my voice. Ruth immediately flashed a smile. “Seemed to be the sentiment among some, but nothing concrete on that front.” I nodded. “She lives a little far away, likes art and such things, gives parties about once a year, settles everyone’s nerves, that sort of thing.” I just nodded. “I knew the parties, Joe mentions them. Says he heard she has first edition Burroughs’ and Kerouac’s in her library.” I gulped, my throat was tightening. Why did I ask? What did I expect? I gulped down the last of my coffee, Ruth must have gotten the message because she finished hers too. I waited for her to get up, she said she needs to lie down at home for a while. I told her I understood. “Oh I almost forgot, Hugh wanted to call you.”

# CHAPTER 3

“Tomorrow?” Henry was more disinterested than I expected. I nodded. Henry had finally begun looking at me, all dinner he rambled about work while looking at his food. “And you’re going with Joe and Ruth?” I hesitated for just a second. “Not Joseph, I don’t think. And Ruth told me about it, so…”. None of it was a lie, technically. Something bothered me still. “And Ruth said one of Joe’s friends would be there maybe, so that might happen.”. I hoped Henry wouldn’t sniff me out like a shark in water, but he seemed to be in a good mood after ranting for an hour. “Have fun then.” he was smiling at me. I suddenly got up and kissed him. To my surprise, he wasn’t surprised by it.

\*\*\*

Hugh was waiting for me at the gallery entrance. He wore denim jeans that looked like the designer gave the pencil to a toddler on the bottom half, a bold orange sleeveless top over a bland polo and a green strand of beads, he had a colourful wrist watch. I wasn’t sure if I should be here, Hugh looked like he wasn’t sure if he should wear a coherent outfit. He had his hair in a half-committed pompadour. He greeted me with a hug, I let my hand linger on his shoulder a few seconds longer. He wore floral cologne. “So glad you made it.” He flashed that coy smile, the dumb beads were bringing out his eyes. “I wanted to come.”. That was true too. I wanted to spend the evening with him, and what if a part of me searched for her? Hoped to catch her; admiring some amateur work, or reciting some well known critic, or a little too drunk with a man a little too young? Hugh was telling me abstract paintings would still be shown but I’d really be blown away by the newer work as he guided me inside. He always sounded like he was smiling.

The gallery was wide with honestly more people than I expected, and it looked more akin to something Henry might enjoy. Single people and couples and groups shuffled between paintings, some trying to be quiet, some breaking the drone of the big lights with loud discussions; I wondered if they felt like they were throwing stones in a perfectly still lake. Hugh was on a faithful mission to explain each artwork and artist to me. Some were beautiful, near the entrance all were abstract lines and shapes and colours; some artists were dead, some were exiled, some were allegedly Hugh’s friend. Actual people started to appear after the first corner. Somewhere someone was making cocktails, because loose waiters going around with canapés and drinks started appearing. Hugh grabbed one of each, before awkwardly handing me them, and grabbing again for himself. I laughed so hard I nearly spilled all of it on the floor. After twenty or so minutes, the alcohol finally hit, I successfully traded hearing most of Hugh’s explanations with scanning every face that walked around. My heart beat for the sight of the familiar visage or hair or body. Minutes of this and I was ultimately left disappointed. We kept walking around. When I shifted my gaze to see what painting we were now walking past, I was instantly paralyzed, the bleach turned rum caught in my throat.

She was there. All along, she had been there. She was clad in a dark dress, her hair wavier than usual and parted to the side. She wasn’t a monarch or the painter’s muse, but she was the focal point. I couldn’t tell when the painting was made, it couldn't have been too long ago but the style was timeless, I wished I had listened to Hugh just a little intently, I might have had some clue for the puzzle. On her right was a man, older and looked to also be important, on her left was a younger girl, not ugly but hideous in comparison. Her neck was decorated with pearls, the dark background painted perfectly to highlight her blonde locks. Were they a family? Was she the matriarch? Was she a noblewoman or just rich? Were the others her siblings? Was he her husband? I had to see, my eyes searched for a ring never painted, or was it lost in the shadow? She had a calm confidence, fueled by something deeper. Was it assurance? Did she know something I didn’t? “Now this guy really knows Warhol!” I heard Hugh a few feet away as I got lost in the brushstrokes. He turned to look at me, the venomous green of his eyes were pulling me out, I didn’t want to go, I wanted to stay with the painting forever. “You OK?” I heard him ask. “Yes, yes I’m fine.” I smiled, wanting to choke him right there. I locked eyes with the woman one last time before following Hugh to the next wall. Her eyes had burned into my retinas. Hugh’s eyes were on me, then back at the painting; for a moment they filled to the brim with something I couldn’t place. In a flash, he went back to his normal self, wore his wide grin and began telling me about the newer artists we would be seeing.

\*\*\*

When I got home I found Henry sitting on his armchair. He was watching television, he did not look like he was waiting for me. “Welcome baby.” He smiled as he got up and came to hug me. “Had a good time?” I hesitated at first. “Yes, I did.”, then I hugged him again. “I’m glad,” he said, “anything worth seeing?”. I laughed, “Not really to be honest.”. “Unless you are very into colored squares.” It was his turn to laugh as he poured me a glass of coffee. “Who was there?”. The question should have frozen my blood, but perhaps thanks to the rum or Henry’s relaxed attitude I didn’t feel like lying. “Hugh was there, from the party.” Henry didn’t seem to recognize him. “That’s nice.” he said as he sat back down. He yawned. “Go to bed sleepy head.” I said smiling. He looked at his wrist watch. “Maybe I should.” He turned off the television, kissed me briefly and walked to the staircase. “Good night, dear.” he said. I wished him good night too. I listened to his footsteps get more and more distant. At last, I was all alone. I looked around. My smile disappeared.

The house was clean. So, so clean. No whiskey glasses, no half eaten food, no dirty clothes on the floor or magazines near the couch. Just the fresh brewed coffee and the fading scent of the peach tree outside. I walked around inspecting the house like Sherlock Holmes in a crime scene. I checked under the couch, behind the bookcase, I checked the insides of Henry’s books, and picture frames. Nothing. I walked back to the door to search again. And again. Against all my best wishes, there was no broken glass or scribbled notes or hidden bottle. The house was just as perfect as I had left it in the afternoon. Henry had stayed all day like a canary. I kept checking, again and again until I saw the drowning abyss outside the windows turn into a dark navy and I stumbled to bed.

# CHAPTER 4

The Saturday dragged on, Henry was out with his colleagues, and I had asked Ruth to go to the new mall with me. She had initially agreed, before Joseph invited some people he met out at a bar midday back to their house. Hugh had a painting sent to my house, I wished I knew who had made it. Faint music was playing and fountain water splashed, lines of women passed me by, and I was all alone among the long rows of the department store. When the bright lights pulled me out of it, the gentle breeze of the air conditioning settled me back in. One could spend months here. I had spent the day looking at the blouses and pantsuits, ultimately putting each back just shy of the registers. Teenagers and large families gathered around the back-to-school outfits, outside I estimated a hundred cigarettes were lit. My eyes scanned the crowd. A chic older woman walked around with a girl about a decade younger, both seemed uncomfortable, neither ever separated. Coins dropped, songs changed, I was walking aimlessly.

Vanilla, sandalwood, lavender, warm amber. It stopped me instantly. I looked around, I was in front of the perfumes. Where was the amber coming from? I inspected each carefully. There were too many bottles to count. I took maybe an hour grabbing one, walking far away, smelling it, and again for about fifty of them. After long eliminations, I was between “Jolie Madame”, “Shalimar” and “Joy”. I had never heard of any of them but the prices were jaw dropping. I thought of her doing the same, maybe not to the same extent, but walking by and stopping, smelling what seemed interesting, I tried picturing what she might have thought about each; or was she not passing by, did she go to the mall just to pick a perfume? Did she have one in mind? I had been sniffing like a pig while she already knew what she wanted. Did someone gift it to her? No, I knew that. She had chosen it, she picked it herself. I thought it was worth Henry’s nagging, I picked one up, the bottle was cold.

I walked confidently to the counter. There was no line, an older woman greeted me. “Is that all?” she said writing it up after I handed her the perfume. I nodded and was reaching for my purse when the pencil skirts in the Misses section caught my eye. “Send it.” I said and walked over to the garments. I had a simple test: could I picture her wearing it? I quickly had to change the test to “could I picture her wearing it at the work event?”. I sifted through burgundy shifts and beige suits and the occasional burnt orange tunic. “To wrapping ma’am?”. Then I went back to the belts, then the handbags, skipped the forest green and corduroy, gathered four or five that seemed the most elegant, had them sent too before going back to the blouses. I picked up and put down and went back and forth, before the voiceover PA announced they will be closing soon. I looked around baffled, the sun had set. I quickly wrote a check, I had bought maybe thirty items and the clerk was giving me a look.

\*\*\*

“There’s something wrong, out with it.” I wasn’t looking at Ruth. We were in her kitchen, I was wearing my new clothes and perfume, the perfume which was now smothered by the cigarette smoke. I lit a new cigarette with the one I was holding. Henry was with his “band”, I didn’t tell him I’d be out of the house. “I’ve never, never seen you do something like this.” Ruth wouldn’t stop trying to make eye contact. “Don’t get me wrong, I love what you did, but please talk to me.” She wasn’t lying, she loved it. Her face lit up when I told her; a rare, vicious haze over her eyes. Henry hadn’t talked to me in days. All day he either stayed out or came home to play that god awful trumpet non stop. I was amazed that it was possible a grown man could get not a single note of a song right. I knew what I wanted to say to Ruth. I hadn’t reached my breaking point yet but something in my gut was shifting around.

“Henry is cheating on me.” I blurted out, finally looking into her eyes. Ruth broke out in a laugh. “With who, the cleaning lady?”. A very clever joke, we didn’t have one. “With Joan.” I was yelling. Ruth saw my face and settled down in her chair. “You’re still thinking about her?” she wasn’t mad or fooling around, she was curious. I felt like a kid showing her mom her boo boo. “Still thinking about her? Of course I am.” my voice was shaking now. “I saw the way Henry looked at her. And, I saw *her*.” Ruth wore a sympathetic look now. “I feel her in the house. Like I just missed her being there.” Ruth reached out and held my hand. I shivered at the ice cold touch of her bony hands. “She… The other night, after the gallery, I came home and it was…” my eyes were tearing up. “Perfectly clean…” I took a puff. “I mean, I don’t know if Henry had just come home or… Or had it cleaned somehow or something. And he was like a saint that day.” Ruth got up and hugged me. When we broke apart, for a single second I saw something different, pointed in her eyes before she put on a sad face and held my hand again. I put out my cigarette.

“Darling, you haven’t a thing to worry about.” I shot an amused glance at her. “First of all, no one, not even Henry would be ungrateful enough to cheat on *you*.” I laughed. Her stare shut me up. “Second, Joan is older than you.”. This was an easy point to argue against, “She’s younger than Henry.”. “Yes, but she’s older than *you*. You were comparing the two of you, remember?” I nodded with resignation. I wanted to counter with *“She’s prettier than me”*, but I managed to hold my tongue. I shouldn’t have poisoned Ruth with this, at least she had some ammunition now to entertain the other wives with. I didn’t mind throwing her a bone, I could care less for the others when Henry wasn’t around. “You’re right.” I tried to convince her of my conviction.

* **Conflicts:**

**‎ ‎ ‎ Osiris MC and Diamond Dogs**

After many gunfights, OMC and D D agreed on the following terms to **end the war:** $ 50k and a Police fob.

**‎ ‎ ‎ CuteBoysClub and Osiris MC**

On the 22nd, CuteBoysClub went up to Paleto to show Osiris disrespect for them robbing CBC's 24/7. While there, CBC attempted to take a hostage to rob the Paleto 24/7, however, in the heat of the moment, Kinzie Darling was shot down in the Parking Lot. Gemma Knight called Wolf Haley asking what had happened. Wolf admitted to doing everything however expressed that things got out of hand.

**‎ ‎ ‎ CuteBoysClub and The Reapers MC**

On the 20th, CuteBoysClub members Scuba Steve and Koa Silvia got into a shootout with the Reapers MC while out towing. The shooting happened due to RMC members pulling a weapon and threatening both Scuba and Koa, Koa acted out in anger and went behind his tow truck and shot down 4 members of the RMC. Later that day the RMC and CBC got into another gunfight. In the same night, Wolf Haley reached out to the Reapers MC and invited them for a chat at the Casino. After a lengthy conversation, both groups agreed that it was not worth fighting over a tow.

**‎ ‎ ‎ The Moretti Crew and The Lost MC**

**History:**

This conflict started a year ago at a Bahama Mamas event. A discussion occurred between Jack Malone, member of the Lost MC and Joey Costello, member of the Moretti Crew (called Moretti Family back then). Eventually, Jack kicked Joey out of his wheelchair and pulled his gun. The Moretti Crew then went to the Yellow Jack to straighten things out but they were met with disrespect. The Moretti's executed a hit on Jack Malone, and in reciprocation, the leader of the LMC tasked Millie Duburger, Vice President of the Lost MC at the time, with shooting two members of the Moretti Crew, her boyfriend, Antonio Moretti and the head of the Family. Millie chose love over club. Since then, the Lost have been trying to locate Millie and have her pay for the betrayal.

**Current:**

The Moretti’s move back into the city after some time and find that tensions are still high between the groups. After many talks, negotiations ended up failing. Eventually, the Lost kidnapped Vince Hansen, a friend of Moretti, and requested a trade. The trade was denied so they broke Vince’s jaw and shot him through the cheek. This resulted in a shootout between the two groups at the Oil Fields. As a response the Moretti's went to Sandy and attacked Louis Garou and Simon Grady, taking their kuttes. Axel Blackwood called and was told to pay $50k for each kutte.

**Cease Fire:**

A cease fire was then called by the Lost MC on the 22nd to set terms for this war. And on the 26th, their were set: 

Rep Colors - Moretti's agreed to wear Grey 

Businesses Off Limits 

Wanted to know Moretti Turf - Moretti's mentioned they do not claim any turf

**War Resumes:**

After setting the terms, the Moretti Crew and The Lost MC are now officially at war, and will likely see escalation in violence in Sandy Shores, and Vinewood over the next week.

* **BadBitchClub**

**Stabbing at the Ramathon Protest:**

On the 24th, at the Ramathon protest at City Hall, **Blondie Lee** came up to the mic and stated “This is now a violent protest” and then proceeded to stab multiple people, including many members of the Mayor's Office. **Tiffany Devine**, a member of the Business Council, was stabbed and, unfortunately, did not survive her wounds.

* **CuteBoysClub**

**Connections**

On the 23rd, Wolf Haley, Alejandro Hernandez and Mike Benjamin had a conversation with Reed Dankleaf from the Diamond Dogs about both groups causing trouble together. The conversation was short but reignited the business relationship between both groups, offering to trade weapons, drugs and information to strengthen both groups.

On the 17th, Sgt. Stark was kidnapped off-duty for a store robbery by **Heidi Jensen and Diamond Tayte**. After, the following twinsta interaction between Diamond and Autumn occurred: [Image](https://i.imgur.com/zswrjIV.png). It was then followed by a [text](https://i.imgur.com/icewozI.png) from Sgt. Stark.

The next day, Diamond and Heidi waited for Autumn's court case to end, but, coincidentally, she ended up getting shot by the Sirens. They followed her to hospital and kidnapped her. She was took to the docks, and warned that she would become ""an eyeless freak"". She was then drugged and left ziptied.

On the following day, she was moved to an RV on Mount gordo. She is there for a few days, where she is weakened and fed a steady stream of morphine after Diamond removed her eye.

She was then moved one more time to the final spot in the forest, where she was found by PD. [Timestamp](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2519483475?t=52s)

1matwrh,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1matwrh/the_selfish_bitch_will_be_happy_if_it_means_being/,"The ""selfish bitch"" will be happy if it means being left alone more","(Note because I'm on mobile grammar and formatting might not be great, I'm better with those proper tools) 

I spend a good amount of my time in the downtown area of my city due to my job and relying on the public transit system to get around,  where I deal with a lot of social issues (drug abuse, mental health, homelessness), and it can be heartbreaking to watch. 

My job is at the branch of the library nearby. For those who may not know, we can get exposed a lot to some of those issues as one of few indoor spaces that doesn't require people to spend money to be there (free wifi, entertainment like books and movies occasionally playing, and public washrooms also doesn't hurt). 

I've been there for over 3 years, working front end, and get recognized fairly regularly if I'm in the area, it's always short but they do ask questions every time, and not having an off switch from public service can be tiring. 

Other parts that have rubbed me the wrong way, if it's not recognition, for different people, are going directly into business (with small layouts, everyone knows what's going on), up to people's tables asking for money if I'm on lunch. I know this is definitely from a place of privilege, but if it's caught or complained about in my place of work, they are asked to stop or leave, I am not allowed on the property, and for a reason. 

I won't personally give money, but on occasion, have paid for a coffee or small sandwich (I'm not rich either), and the last time I did, they started adding on more than they said they wanted to the order without asking me, so it's put me off it for a while. 

And today when when I got asked right outside the door of my favorite coffee spot and said no sorry, I got called a selfish bitch for my trouble, Im going to choose to donate to the shelter directly when I can because I've had enough. ",1,1753641405.0,rant,0,1.0,False

1matukk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1matukk/does_apoxcon_gw2_electric_coffee_percolator/,Does APOXCON GW-2 Electric Coffee Percolator Deliver the Best Brewing Experience Review?,"The APOXCON GW-2 Electric Coffee Percolator promises to elevate the brewing game with its stainless-steel construction, impressive capacity, and safety features. Having spent weeks putting this percolator through its paces, I’ve gathered enough insights to spill the beans—pun intended! Known for its sturdy build and generous 12-cup capacity, it caters to coffee enthusiasts who appreciate a classic brewing method with modern conveniences. While testing it daily, I brewed everything from my regular morning coffee to chai tea for evening guests. It served my caffeine needs admirably, though there are some quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The sleek stainless steel body of this percolator is hard to miss. It adds a professional touch to the kitchen while being remarkably durable. The borosilicate glass knob on top felt surprisingly sturdy, even during consistent brewing. I loved being able to watch the coffee perks bubble up through the clear glass—a nostalgic feature in a role-modern gadget. The ergonomic cool-touch handle, coupled with a non-drip spout, ensured no accidental spills during hectic mornings. Despite its robust all-metal build, the percolator itself remains lightweight at 3.73 pounds. However, the bottom gets quite warm after long use, so be cautious while moving it around after brewing.

**Good Points**  
- ETL certification ensures safety and healthy brewing.  
- Durable stainless steel design resists wear and tear.  
- Heat-resistant glass knob lets you monitor brewing progress.  
- Cool-touch handle and non-drip spout prevent mishaps when serving.  
- Brews 6 to 12 cups quickly, perfect for families or gatherings.  

[Check APOXCON GW-2 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0d1cdx943/)  

**Performance and Automatic Functions**  
This device really speeds through brewing, taking only a few minutes to crank out a full 12-cup batch. The convenience of the on/off switch, combined with the built-in ready-to-serve light indicator, took the guesswork out of my coffee-making process. The automatic keep-warm feature surprised me with its effectiveness—it maintained the coffee’s optimal drinking temperature for long durations without overcooking the brew. However, on one occasion when I left it on for bit too long, the heating element seemed to intensify the flavor, leaving a slightly over-extracted taste. Not a dealbreaker for me, but it might bother purists.

**Ease of Use and Cleanup**  
Operating the percolator is almost foolproof. You simply load up the basket with grounds, fill the reservoir with water, and let it work its magic. Once you get over the learning curve of balancing the grind consistency and water level, it becomes second nature. The reusable filter eliminates the need for disposable paper filters, which I appreciated for both its eco-friendliness and cost-saving aspect. Cleaning was straightforward—a quick rinse of the stainless steel parts and the glass knob usually sufficed. That said, the filter basket involves some effort if coffee grounds get stuck in the mesh.

**Shortcomings**  
- The exterior can get hot to touch after extended use.  
- Some over-extraction tendencies with prolonged warming.  
- Slightly tricky cleaning process for the mesh filter.  

**Recommended Applications**  
This appliance isn’t just for coffee preparation. I experimented with tea, hot cocoa, and even oatmeal, as the percolator seemed adept at multitasking. It’s an ideal gadget for hosting gatherings, as its generous capacity caters to multiple servings. My favorite moments were weekend brunches where it churned out batch after batch of aromatic brew for friends and family.

**Competing Brands**  
Several popular options like the Presto 12-Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker and Cuisinart PRC-12 could easily compete with the version I tested. The Presto model offers similar functionality but lacks the borosilicate glass knob—a minor deal but noteworthy for those who enjoy watching their coffee brew. The Cuisinart PRC-12, on the other hand, features similar safety measures and automatic settings, but some users report inconsistent brewing temperatures. In comparison, the APOXCON GW-2 excels with its sturdy build, ease of use, and reliability. However, it does fall short when matched against the Presto’s customer reviews that highlight its slightly better heat insulation.  

**Price Efficiency**  
Considering its features and build, this percolator falls in the affordable quality category. It competes in a bracket where some steeply-priced alternatives don’t offer the same level of robust construction or capacity. Its focus on eliminating materials like plastic in coffee-contact areas further makes it an appealing choice. If you prioritize daily utility over premium extras, this could be your go-to.

1matu63,https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectricBikeReviews/comments/1matu63/investigate_the_jasion_retrovolt_electric_bike/,Investigate the Jasion RetroVolt Electric Bike review is it a top performer?,"**A Retro-Style Ride with Modern Tech**  

Testing the Jasion RetroVolt Electric Bike has been a unique experience. Its retro styling immediately stood out to me, resembling a classic cruiser bike with all the modern tech packed into it. Having tested various electric bikes, I can confidently say this one blends style and performance like few others in its price range. With a 1500W peak motor and a top speed of 30MPH, the RetroVolt feels powerful but controlled.  

While cruising around the neighborhood, I noticed just how robust this bike feels thanks to its high-carbon steel frame. Weighing it against the performance of other electric bikes I've reviewed, the RetroVolt truly holds its own with a smart balance of durability and maneuverability.  

**Performance & Power: No Compromises**  

The 750W brushless motor pumps out a whopping 1500W peak power, paired with 99Nm of torque. It's designed for speed and strength. I've tested the bike on steep hills, and it climbed like a champ—no stuttering, no slowing down. Five riding modes are included: electric-only, pedal-assist, pedal-only, cruise mode, and hill-climbing mode. I toggled between them seamlessly during testing, but the pedal-assist mode was certainly my favorite on longer rides.  

[Ready for Jasion RetroVolt Electric Bike? Check price on Amazon.](https://expertbiking.com/p/b0dry3d2xk/)  

**Battery Life That Goes the Distance**  

Battery performance is one of the standout features here. The 48V/13AH removable battery allowed me to go up to 70 miles in pedal-assist mode, which is, quite frankly, fantastic. Charging it took around four hours, and the IPX6 waterproof rating gave me confidence riding in unpredictable weather. However, keep in mind that max range figures vary depending on terrain, your mode of choice, and, yes, even how many steep coffee-shop stops you decide to make.  

**Safety Features That Instill Confidence**  

Safety played a central role in my decision to consistently ride the RetroVolt. The dual hydraulic disc brakes perform reliantly under all road conditions, but what truly impressed me was the rear brake light and turn signals. On morning commutes in high-traffic areas, the signals ensured I was noticed by cars. It's great to see a bike that doesn't cut corners when it comes to solving real-world safety concerns.  

**Good Points**  

- Powerful 750W motor with a 1500W peak for climbing and speed.  
- Easy-to-read LCD display for tracking speed and battery life.  
- 20” x 4” fat tires that handle rugged terrain, sand, and even snow.  
- Dual suspension offers a smooth and stable ride.  

**Areas for Improvement**  

- The bike's weight might be challenging for smaller riders or if you ever need to carry it up stairs.  
- Assembly required, although tools are included. Some patience is necessary.  
- Battery placement could have felt more streamlined with the design.  

**Strong Competition From Peers**  

In a market crowded with e-bikes, comparing the RetroVolt to its direct audience rivals like the RadRover 6 Plus and Aventon Aventure was inevitable. Here's what I noticed: while the RetroVolt brings great motor power, the others pack additional integrated accessories such as pre-installed fenders and racks. Regarding battery efficiency, however, I felt the RetroVolt surpasses its peers, especially for mid-range terrains. And for those who enjoy a retro aesthetic? The RetroVolt easily comes out on top.  

**Budget-Friendly Elegance**  

The RetroVolt strikes a balance between retro design and power-packed features, placing it in a sweet spot for buyers wanting value without splurge. Bikes in the same category with slightly higher price tags often don't match its 70-mile range or attention to rider safety. It's worth assessing what matters to your daily ride needs—but for someone like me who commutes often and spends weekends tackling rocky trails, this investment feels justified by the combination of stylish design and adventurous functionality.

Basically when i extract I get coffee spewing from my portafilter which as many know is super annoying.

Now, I am somewhat experienced as i’ve had my coffee set up for a couple of years now, but i recently moved back home where my family doesn’t quite see the value i place in coffee or my coffee set up. This is generally fine but i’ve become frustrated because of one new problem I am having in relation to this seemingly unrelated information.

My espresso set up is a Gaggia Classic Pro, a timemore 064s grinder, and a bottomless normcore portafilter. I weigh in for 17.5-19 grams, distributor, level, tamp. etc.. Then i pull the shot and the shot struggles to come out, so naturally i adjust my grind to be coarser. when i do this, however, the espresso comes out way too fast, spewing everywhere. It seems like there’s hardly any room for error as i’m making micro adjustments when it comes to grind size.

Now, I haven’t had these problems in the past. BUT, in the past (i.e. before i moved back home) i bought my own coffee beans from either local roasters or coffee shops that i trust sell good quality beans. Present day, my family likes when i make them coffee so they buy beans….. but these beans are usually from the grocery store, and they usually don’t have a “roasted by” date, which for me is a big red flag.

Anyways, when i use these beans, my shot turns out possible, it makes a mess, and i can’t seem to really even dial it in.

Before any of you just say “buy your own beans”…… yes of course i can and simply will do that as i enjoy my beans more. what i’m asking or trying to understand is if the problem originated from the beans or maybe if there’s something bigger at play here.

I know this is long, and sort of complicated, but i appreciate any help.",1,1753641183.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Ok back story. 1 year ago I got divorced and started seeing a girl Ive known for 3 years that was recently separated from her husband who had cheated repeatedly. It started as friends with benefits then progressed into a relationship. It was fraught with issues. We broke it off multiple times for varying reasons like girls I was following on social media, to her just not feeling ready. Most recently she broke it off again and now we have fallen back into the friends with benefits stage. During some of our recent discussions she shared that she's asked an AI website why she misses me when she leaves my house when she knows we aren't meant to be together. She also shared that she asked AI to describe her ideal partner and she said it sounded like it was me.  Recently we hooked up and she stopped in the middle and got really emotional. I asked her why and she said shes just feeling sad cause she knows that at some point this is going to end. We hooked up last night and it was amazing. it felt like it did when we were together. She ways she wants me to just go with the flow but its hard because I love her and what that security. Recently a new girl has popped into the picture. Shes 35 very attractive and has shown interest. We recently had coffee and talked for 2.5 hours. It was great. She wants to hang out again but I feel a bit guilty as I still have this thing going on with my ex. My ex said she doesn't want to know if I'm dating, only if I'm going to sleep with someone else. Im really curious how it would go but I don't want to risk my ex finding out and it destroying our friendship. Do I continue to see my ex and blow off the younger girl, hoping its going to eventually work its way back into a relationship, or do I end this thing with the ex and see where it goes with the new girl?

1matq5y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TVReviewLounge/comments/1matq5y/can_the_hisense_40h4f_led_roku_smart_tv_deliver/,Can the Hisense 40H4F LED Roku Smart TV Deliver Quality? Review Inside!,"The Hisense 40H4F LED Roku Smart TV with Alexa Compatibility (2020 Model) landed in my living room just a few weeks ago, and I’ve had ample opportunity to put it through its paces. As someone who often bounces between binge-watching series, catching live sports games, and battling it out in intense gaming sessions, I needed a versatile, feature-packed TV within a reasonable budget. This television checks many boxes, but there’s plenty worth discussing before making a purchase.

**Picture Quality That Stands Out**

High-definition visuals make a massive difference when you’re diving into your favorite cinematic experiences or streaming that gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller. This TV boasts 1080p resolution, and the image is crisp and detailed, especially given its 39.5-inch screen size. Colors feel vibrant without tipping into overly saturated territory, and dark scenes still maintain decent clarity, though perfect blacks aren't its strong suit (I didn't really expect OLED-level performance). For sports enthusiasts, the Motion Rate 120-image processing does an admirable job of eliminating motion blur, delivering smoother playback for fast-paced sequences. My basketball-loving cousin loved watching a game on this.

**User-Friendly Roku Integration**

I’ve tested smart TVs before, but the Roku TV platform on this one is refreshingly simple. A clutter-free home screen and the compact Roku remote mean I spend less time fumbling around and more time streaming. With access to over 5,000 streaming channels and an almost absurd 500,000 episodes and movies, finding something to watch feels almost overwhelming (in a good way). Pairing my subscriptions like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ was straightforward, and even if you’re not tech-savvy, you’ll be up and running in no time.

[Check Hisense 40H4F price on Amazon.](https://raltv.com/p/b084b1t8kk/)

**Built-In Wi-Fi and Alexa/Google Assistant Compatibility**

Setting up the TV’s wireless connectivity was a breeze; I didn’t face any drops or lag during my daily Netflix unwinding hour. You can control the TV with the Roku TV app if you’re like me and always lose remotes. And yes, if you’ve got an Alexa device or something Google Assistant-enabled lying around, this TV pairs up beautifully. I geeked out over using voice commands to switch inputs, search for shows, and adjust the volume. While it’s not a must-have feature, it is one of those things you never knew you needed until you’ve used it.

**Integrated Sound Could Use Some Help**

I’ve always been picky about sound quality, so this bit didn’t surprise me. The DTS TruSurround delivers balanced audio suitable for casual viewing, but movie nights are noticeably lacking in bass. For everyday TV shows or quick YouTube binges, it’s more than serviceable. However, my family unanimously agreed we needed our soundbar when we streamed an action-heavy blockbuster.

**Strengths**

- Clear and vibrant 1080p resolution.  
- Seamless Roku TV platform with a vast selection of streaming options.  
- Compact and intuitive remote design.  
- Alexa and Google Assistant compatibility for voice controls.  

**Negative Attributes**

- Built-in speakers could benefit from richer bass.  
- The 60Hz refresh rate might feel limiting to gamers relying on ultra-smooth visuals.  

**Compact Design and Build**

This TV isn’t flashy, but for its price and size, it doesn’t need to be. The frame is understated, and the black finish blends into my living room aesthetic without issue. It’s lightweight (around 12.8 pounds) and compact, making wall mounting relatively stress-free. If you’re opting for the stand, the included one does the job without any wobbling. I’ve knocked over a coffee table before but rest assured, this TV would be fine if you’re moderately careful.

**Challengers**

Comparing this to some other well-known options on the market, I fiddled with TCL’s 40S325 Roku Smart TV, which shares similar specs and is within the same price band. While TCL’s picture quality is comparable, I found the Hisense TV edges it out in user-friendliness and navigation. Similarly, brands like Vizio offer compelling products, but I’ve run into app instability and software lag with a similar Vizio model I tested last year. Where this product excels over its competitors is its simplicity—it works right out of the box, and there’s no overcomplication.

**Price to Quality Ratio**

Looking at everything it offers—the vibrant 1080p visuals, the intuitive Roku interface, and the smart voice assistant compatibility—this TV is money well spent. Comparable TVs from competitors sometimes slap on premium prices for features you might not even need, while this one nails the essentials without overcharging for frills.

1matpiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrangedmarriage/comments/1matpiw/my_experience_so_far_33m_45_lpa/,"My experience so far. 33,M, 45 LPA.","**SOME CONTEXT.**

1. After a lot of research on Reddit, i finally made a profile on both js and shaadi. This was done in Mid may.

2)To give you some context. I am 33, Male and i live in Mumbai. I live with my parents and their net worth is around 7 cr. I only mention about two homes to my prospects while we own around 4 homes and a farmhouse. I also never mention about my savings to them which is around 2 cr. I earn 45 LPA. I am working in sea for 45 days and then i am home for 45 days and the cycle continues. I am somewhat good looking, 5-10 and have a medium built.

3) I was looking for somewhat good looking matches across communities. i had a slight preference for North Indians since i am a north Indian myself. I was okay with both science and commerce background. I have completed mechanical engineering myself.

**PROGRESS SO FAR**

1.I had around 30 odd matches on Shaadi and around 70 of them on Js. I had sent invites on a factory scale to over 1500 profiles on JS and maybe 500 profiles on shaadi. Many a yet to respond...

2.Out of the 100 matches i found, i have met 6 in person. I had a few phone calls with lets say another 8. ...and maybe i exchanged a few texts with another 10...so around 75 matches didnt respond at all.

3.The first girl i met left midway. We were supposed to eat dinner together but she made up an excuse and left after coffee. She declined me on the next day.

4.I met the second girl in a mall. We were together for 4 hours. She also did some shopping side by side for which she paid. Then i dropped her to her clinic. She hasnt texted me much..She told me she was sick.

5.The third girl i met was way obese. She was maybe 110 kgs or something. I told her we are better off as friends..However the meet with her was preety pleasant. She offered me to split for which i declined.

6. The fourth girl left after 40 odd minutes and left a little unceremoniously. She was on her phone and we barely had much eye contact. i texted her. She hasnt responded and it has been around 48 hours.

7.The fifth girl i met was currently jobless. She was calling me all the time. We were talking for 3 hours a day and this lasted a week. She was constantly telling me about her life and her problems. While that wasnt a problem for me but it was getting too much . When we met, i took chocolates for her and i had to pay around 8000 rupees in total for our drinks,meals and coffee.. I had told her that i am also in calling stage a three other prospects which i knew before we had matched. I told her that i am yet to meet them and not talking to them just because now that i met you in person wasn't right. She herself had dated multiple men in the past. Then one day when i didnt recieve her call..She got super pissed and asked me if i was busy with someone else. I said yes and told her i was gonna meet another prospect tomorrow. She abused me and then blocked me everywhere.

8.The last girl i met was probably the most humble of all. We met for 4 hours. She was nice to me. We are still talking. She was also the prettiest of all the women i met. Stereotype BROKEN.  

9.I will meet another girl next weekend ...again only because we have spoken for way too long and i think we should meet

**MY CONCLUSION SO FAR,**

1. I was talking to 4 prospects at once. It is very difficult..at max i can manage 2. This lasted for around 5 days. On the 6th day, two of them left me ...One blocked me and one just left the meeting within 40 minutes without any explanation. Now i am down to 2 and i think 2 is the right number.
2. I dont know if i should admit it to the other prospect that i am talking to another person at the same time..But i am 33. However i am sure that everyone is talking to multiple prospects at the same time.
3. Women in their early 30s are very entitled IMHO. And these are women who are 6/10 at max. Maybe women in their mid 30s are a little better.
4. Telling your parents about your search so far is a terrible idea. They dont understand and blame you continously. Also that means that you are constantly surrounded by their questions. Best is to not tell them anything at all...no names..NOTHING! 
5. It is very hard to convince women to meet me. I tell them that i ONLY have genuine intentions on my mind. I have to drive to their residence..Only then they turn up and they are ALWAYS LATE. I sometimes have to travel 30-35 kms one way for a meetup while they just have to cross a street.
6. I can luckily afford to pay for our meetups but if you earn less than a lakh a month...you are in deep poop. It can take around 2000-3000 for one meetup if you are meeting for lunch and coffee....and if you add drinks..then it can cost you 8000.
7. This entire search sucks..i am not even motivated to do it further...It is not pleasant to meet women during AM at all. During dating, there was still some charm...some thrill..it felt more organic. During this AM search, things are super dry...During my bumble dates, i used to go to late night walks and eat street food or watch a movie....AM is more like a business meeting.
8. It is very hard to talk to talkative people. At most one should cap a phone call to 30-40 minutes a day. Some people just call you to tell you about their problems all the time...They gossip. I think women like to be heard, which is fine...But then again an AM prospect is not your 2 Am friend. ",14,1753640915.0,Arrangedmarriage,32,0.86,False

* When his vault applied a 50% hinder for a full second, meaning you didn't make it to anything and he just hit you.
* When he didn't lose any power tokens for breaking pallets, so he could just brutal strength the pallet and immediately catch you.
* When old Hinami's Umbrella existed and Coffee was a common you could just run constantly.

None of those are a thing anymore.

Imagine a killer with the following traits.

* He's very good at getting injuries.
* He counters people holding W.
* He can sometimes beat you to a pallet and bodyblock it.
* He's extremely easy.

You know who I'm describing here?

**Wraith.**

The biggest difference between them is that while Kaneki has a more reliable injury, Wraith's chase at most tiles is significantly stronger than Kaneki's.

Simple fact is that to be an S-tier killer, you **need** to end chases quickly. To end chases quickly, you **need** strong tile play, and Kaneki does not have that.

* The injury can be as free as you like, as long as it doesn't put people in dying it doesn't make him S-tier because it doesn't end chases.
* The sheer mobility he has access to *does* have an impact at certain tiles, but it isn't that many. His shack is quite strong, but everyone knows that so they're just going to predrop, and suddenly your strong shack doesn't matter because they're taking you to a jungle gym or junk pallet where your power sucks.
* Kidnap tech is a genuine design problem because it makes Kaneki even *more* of a noobstomper. The issue is that it's so easy to counter that it doesn't do anything against players that actually know what he does; if the survivor is marked it's not possible, and if the survivor isn't marked they can just stand close to the vault to deny the tech.
* No, the vault doesn't ""just give him free hits"". For that to happen without a kidnap, either the tile needs to be *very* long or the survivor needs to panic and run into the open after seeing the vault. As a benchmark, *with coup de grace*, he can *just barely* land a hit on a survivor if he vaults after them on a Red Forest pallet gym. If it's any shorter than that, they make it to safety before he catches up and his only real ""anti-loop"" does nothing.

Kaneki is only a threat to survivors who don't loop him, because if they *do* loop him he has to play the tile as a pure m1 killer most of the time.

We're at a Skull Merchant level of disinformation as to what this killer is capable of. He's *maybe* high B tier normally, and could be argued to be low A-tier if he's running Centipede+Yamori to slot in a full slowdown build, but people are losing their goddamn minds over things that either aren't that strong, are counterable, or aren't even a thing anymore.",0,1753640883.0,deadbydaylight,18,0.06,False

1matnd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1matnd7/it_feels_like_the_grieving_process_was_postponed/,It feels like the grieving process was postponed by 2 years.,"I suppose I just needed an outlet. I'm not looking for advice.

My ex and I parted ways 2 years and 3 months ago. We were together for 8.5 years, ending shortly before my 34th birthday and her 32nd birthday. We decided to walk away from the relationship a week after I initiated a serious conversation to save the relationship. I've suffered from depressive episodes off and on for much of my life. When COVID hit, and the stresses of my job crept in, I fell into depression. Because of my ex's student loans, and both of us figuring out our lives career-wise, I made a misstep in buying us a house to build our lives off of in 2019, as opposed to proposing (even though, wow, did I get lucky). Through COVID, I was playing catch-up, and since we couldn't do much at first, I became frugal and squeezed every penny I could to give her the big, quirky wedding she could be proud of once the world gets back to normal. But we drifted apart during that time, as I worked a lot, and our interests changed. You could easily chalk up our relationship ending simply because, as our incomes grew, our lifestyles diverged. We had no children; we had our hobbies. She still enjoyed drinking with her friends and being out all night on the weekends, which became like a manic episode after the early period of COVID, while I let off steam with my friends paddling whitewater and hiking with our German Shepherd. But, it was more than my sobriety or her partying lifestyle as we all became complacent with the pandemic. My mental health was waning considerably, and we became more like very friendly roommates as I listlessly went about my days, weeks, and months.

The ""talk"" I initiated came about on a Sunday evening. I came back that morning from hiking our dog, and, like most Sundays, I came back from a 4-hour hike to Jenny finally waking up and having her coffee. I thought we would have a day together, since we didn't have any plans earlier, but I was wrong. She walked to her home office to do her makeup, and she left to go out with her friends. Now, I'm friends with her friends, and usually, if it's not us being up until 2 in the morning drinking at a bar, I enjoy the day among friends and Jenny. But she just said goodbye and left. It rubbed me the wrong way, especially after three months of drifting. She had started going to the gym during the week with a guy friend from high school, whom I knew and had no problem with. However, I probably was around her maybe 2 hours total, Monday through Friday, for months. I don't believe she was cheating, but after that day of her leaving to hang with her friends without me, I needed to talk with her about us, especially because I had hit my savings goal and had a plan to propose within a couple of months.

So we talk, and I let myself be vulnerable. At the age of 33, Jenny was the first person I ever opened up to about my lifelong struggle with depression. She responded that I was simply wasting her life, and ""I don't know how we get back on track."" But, due to our history, and her being dismissive, we just ended the conversation there (there was a lot more, but that was the very short summary version). So, we go about our usual work week, and by the end of the week, one morning, she goes to kiss me goodbye to go to work, and I simply ask if she just wanted to walk away from the relationship, and she said, ""Kind of."" I said, ""Okay,"" and that was that. Over.

I never shed a tear for the end of that relationship. A small piece of me felt bitter because opening up about feeling depressed took a lot out of me, and it was dismissed entirely, but I also felt relief that it ended. She moved back in with her parents, while I had the dog and the house, with 40k in my savings going towards a wedding that would never come. Jenny still helped to dog sit our dog for when I'd go out of state to visit family, because of that, and in the spirit of us ending amicably, I didn't mind having so much of her stuff in my house while she's living with her parents searching for an apartment she could afford. I owned barely anything, while she owned so much stuff.

To go back to the beginning, our relationship started immediately upon meeting while she was in her final year in college, and I was a sort of vagabond-adjacent person (or an employed homeless guy) living in my truck out in the southern Rockies working for the Forest Service. I didn't feel the deep intensity so many people in their 20s feel when meeting their ""person,"" but a deep comfort and warmth the moment she came into my life. It was as if we were already woven into each other's lives before we even met. I moved in with her within a month of our relationship, and we were essentially attached at the hip for 8 years thereafter.

jump forward to last week, I learned she has been living in an apartment for quite some time. I then decided, since she's watching the dog next weekend while I visit my family, it would be a great opportunity to collect all of her stuff and place it in the living room. Since I won't be home, she can spend all weekend moving her stuff out of my house and into her apartment. So Friday, I started going through her old office to divide what's hers from mine and bring it downstairs.

Jenny is the kind of person who's been the same size since high school. She is also a god-tier consumer. It's crazy that a person can have a half dozen contractor bags filled with clothes, but have so many clothes still, that those clothes in contractor bags aren't even a thought. Because she had an office job that required professional attire, and she changed a lot as her own income grew, her wardrobe changed frequently, leaving everything she wore during our early years together, and clothes going back to high school, in those bags, basically. The boxes full of stuff were relics of thrift store finds, small shops, and just random things tied to memories.

After spending an entire weekend in that office, separating my stuff from hers, it all finally hit me so many years later, after breaking up. I feel like I'm mourning the death of who Jenny was in her 20s, a person I will never know again, or who will ever exist again, and I am now rummaging through the stuff 20-something Jenny left behind.",1,1753640761.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I'm not able to sleep in the normal ways normal people do. My brain just doesn't stop thinking. It randomly thinks whatever it wants without me acknowledging it. Coffee helps me clam down and I usually sleep while listening to a documentary cause it distracts me from my brain and then it gives up and I am able to sleep much faster than I used to before, which was 1-2 hours after laying down literally crying to sleep. Had a chat with grok, told it to be extremely truthful and it said there is something severely wrong with me to drink coffee to sleep. I know it's ai, so that's why I'm here.

As the fandom ages, so do the characters and the kinds of stories we tell — there's a noticeable rise in more mature topics: parenthood, long-term relationships, career struggles, trauma, healing, and domestic life. It's a natural progression that reflects where many readers and writers are in their own lives. Honestly, at this rate, it feels like it's only a matter of time before we get our first fic about an omega going through menopause — and I, for one, would absolutely read it.

She and her husband, Joseph, lived in Clyman, Wisconsin. I wonder if this was a recipe that had been passed down to her from the Civil War? 

“Yankey” Cookies

1 cup brown sugar
1 cup syrup
1 cup lard or butter

Let come to a boil. When cool, add:

3 eggs
3 teaspoons saleratus (which is baking powder)
2 “ ginger
2 “ cloves
1 “ cinnamon
½ cup coffee
1 (cup?) sifted flour

(Faint writing below — possibly says)
“Add more flour if needed”

No temperature or baking times were noted so I’ll just guess at a 350 degree oven. Place in spoonfuls on a cookie sheet and bake until lightly browned.

1mathbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1mathbe/26_m4f_croatia_europe_looking_for_true_love/,26 [M4F] Croatia Europe - looking for true love,"Hey everyone, here I am giving this a shot, after being disappointed with dating platforms. I’m tired of talking to people only interested in surface level interactions.

I’m looking for a lady to get to know, chat about everything or nothing over coffee and spend time together, with the ultimate goal of building a serious, long-term relationship if we’re a good match. I value open and direct communication, mutual support and respect, and being willing to compromise when needed. Bonus points from the get-go if you love animals and have a well-developed sense of humor.

Physical traits: I'm 183 cm tall and weigh around 80 kg. I’m not actively training, but I’d say I’m fit. I have light blue eyes and longer brown shoulder-length hair with curls at the ends. I keep my beard ultra short because when I’m clean-shaven, I have a complete baby face. All in all, healthy as a horse.

We can exchange a few photos after a brief intro just to confirm we both exist IRL and to see what we look like. The only physical dealbreaker for me is obesity, because I care when a lady takes care about her health (kinda hypocritical, I know).

Personality & interests: At first glance, I come off as reserved, so people often assume I’m closed off. In reality, I just need a bit of time to relax and open up. Those who know me well or have good intuition often describe me as “too good for my own good.” I think that stems from my personal values and character. I mention this because I’ve heard it from multiple close people to me, so I think it’s worth noting.

My sense of humor is varied from silly jokes and memes, to self-deprecating or friendly teasing, and even a bit of dark humor, last two depending on the audience, of course.

I finally have a chill job that doesn’t stress me out and doesn’t follow me home except for the funny stories I can share with others. I’m also studying a field I love and have about 70% of the academic year completed. I unwind by walking my dog, spending time in nature, or just having a cup of coffee and a good conversation.

I don’t do the classic Saturday night partying anymore; I prefer peaceful settings, aimless walks, movies or series at home, though I’m totally fine with concerts and similar events. I drink alcohol moderately and only on special occasions. I don’t use drugs or stimulants (except caffeine and nicotine, sadly). I’m currently a smoker, but that’s the next thing I’m working on changing on myself and my being.

Music: My music taste is diverse and depends on the mood, situation, and company. If I had to describe it, I’d say it’s a mix of rock, pop, house, and the ex-Yugoslav scene. I’m pretty clueless when it comes to genre classification I just go by what sounds good to my ears.

Other stuff: I used to game, mostly indie, story-driven single-player titles. I can cook basic meals, I’m no chef, but I won’t go hungry or eat bland food either. I use weekends to catch up on things I don’t manage during the week, stuff like car maintenance, yard work, etc.

Fun facts about me: I’ve got ninja-like reflexes and haven’t had many past relationships, so I’m trauma-free and not tied to any exes. I wouldn’t say I’m weird or that there’s something wrong with me, I just wasn’t in the happiest phase of life before and didn’t feel like adding more complications with dating. Now I’m in a better place in my life and looking for my better half to share happiness with. I write in full disclosure mode because I’m brutally honest in every interaction.

Anyhow, maybe I overdid it with the text or maybe not enough. But if something caught your eye, my DM is open to the public.

TL;DR
8/10 solid pot looking for its solid lid, someone compatible for a drama-free relationship full of laughter and mutual understanding in the long run.

1math12,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1math12/assess_the_best_coffee_maker_for_home_use_ninja/,Assess the Best Coffee Maker for Home Use Ninja DualBrew Review,"The Ninja DualBrew Hot & Iced Coffee Maker grabbed my attention mainly because it combines both pod and grounds brewing in one unit. As someone who constantly switches between the convenience of pods and the artistry of brewing coffee from grounds, this hybrid system seemed like it was tailor-made for me. The 12-cup carafe and single-serve options gave me hope that it could handle my morning routine and cater to occasional guests. Over a couple of weeks of testing, I brewed everything from a quick pod-based classic coffee to a rich, robust café-quality batch using grounds. While I did find myself impressed on multiple fronts, this coffee maker isn’t without its quirks.

**Thoughtful and Practical Design**

This machine clearly had some serious thought put into its design. The layout is clean, and though it has several parts, they feel intuitive enough to figure out right out of the box. The foldable single-serve platform was one aspect I genuinely loved. If you’re like me and often brew into smaller mugs, this feature minimizes splashing and keeps things neat. The 60-ounce removable reservoir is another major highlight. Lugging water-filled carafes from the sink to a coffee maker is a hassle I’m glad to leave behind, and the removable reservoir is both easy to carry and refill.

[Check Ninja DualBrew Hot & Iced Coffee Maker price on Amazon.](https://cyberlyber.com/p/b0cmvd6jb1/)

**Performance and Brew Speed**

What struck me was how fast it is at brewing a cup, particularly when using pods. It’s advertised as being faster than the Keurig K-Elite, and while I don’t own that specific model, I can confirm that it was definitely speedier than my last pod coffee maker. There's no excessive wait time when you're in a hurry to grab a cup and head out the door, and this is a huge plus.

With grounds, the Ninja machine offers nine brewing sizes, ranging from a small cup to a full carafe. This flexibility is great if, like me, you oscillate between brewing a single mug or making enough coffee to share. The machine also gives you three brewing styles — Classic, Rich, and Over Ice — allowing you to tailor your coffee based on your mood.

**Upsides**

- Incredible versatility, offering both pods and grounds brewing.
- Adjustable warming plate keeps coffee warm for up to four hours — a lifesaver for those with unpredictable schedules.
- The Classic, Rich, and Over Ice options provide brewing variety.
- Easy maintenance, with a Clean function and dishwasher-safe parts.
- Folding platform prevents spills while making single-serve coffees.

**Adverse Aspects**

- Takes up a noticeable amount of counter space, which might be an issue for smaller kitchens.
- Some parts such as the Ninja Pod Adapter can feel tricky to insert at first, though it gets easier after some practice.
- The coffee brewed in large quantities doesn’t stay quite as hot as one might expect once transferred into the carafe.

**Thermal Flavor Extraction Duo**

This feature piqued my curiosity before I began testing. Delivering balanced and fuller flavors requires even saturation and precise temperature control, both of which the Thermal Flavor Extraction Duo claims to excel at. While using pods, I noticed a clear improvement in taste and consistency compared to other machines I’d used in the past. Grounds-based brewing, too, delivered coffee that tasted fuller and more aromatic. This isn’t just a “slap two systems together” approach; it feels thoughtfully engineered to get the best out of both brewing methods.

**Competing Products**

When looking at other products in this category, I found that the Ninja DualBrew competes most directly with the Keurig K-Duo and the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew. On one hand, the Keurig K-Duo also brews both pods and grounds, but it lacks some features I found handy in the Ninja, like the thermal extraction tech and the various brew intensity options. Meanwhile, the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew is budget-friendly but feels less polished in terms of design and functionality.

Still, the Ninja machine does have a tradeoff — its larger size compared to competitors might be a deciding factor for those who are tight on counter space. But in all honesty, I’d say the superior taste and brewing versatility earned it some forgiveness for its bulk.

**Quality for Price**

When I think about whether this coffee machine is worth its price, the short answer is that you’re paying for features you’ll actually use. This isn’t just a trendy item with gimmicks. From its speedier pod brewing times to its detailed customization for grounds, the value proposition speaks to those who take their coffee habits seriously. Unlike some other coffee makers where you feel like you’re compromised with either pods or grounds, this one nails both approaches. I’d say this is ideal for households where one person likes pods for convenience while another prefers using freshly ground beans.

Notice how that memory isn’t just a recollection of the past—it carries something more profound, an almost mystical quality that feels both wonderful and somehow unreachable.

What you're experiencing isn't simply nostalgia. You're witnessing a fundamental force of human psychology in action—one that has been shaping your desires, emotions, and life choices since you were small, yet remains largely unrecognised.

# The Mystery Behind Your Most Meaningful Moments

That sense of inexplicable specialness you just felt? It has a name: hagioptasia, meaning “holy vision”. It's your mind's tendency to perceive certain people, places, objects, or thoughts as possessing an otherworldly quality of significance—as if they're touched by something transcendent.

Here's what makes this discovery so remarkable: while many of your experiences of hagioptasia do relate to your childhood, it isn't only about the past. It's a perceptual mechanism that's actively working right now, transforming ordinary experiences into sources of profound meaning. Your nostalgic memories are simply the easiest place to observe it in action.

# A Simple Test: Watching Your Mind Create Magic

Try this revealing exercise:

**Step 1:** Think of three specific childhood memories that feel especially meaningful or ""magical"" to you. Not just happy memories, but ones that seem to glow with significance.

**Step 2:** Now ask yourself honestly: Were these moments actually extraordinary when they happened? Or were they fairly ordinary experiences that have somehow acquired a deep sense of specialness over time?

**Step 3:** Notice the paradox: You can intellectually recognise that these were probably quite mundane moments (a typical Tuesday afternoon, an unremarkable conversation, playing in a garden), yet they continue to feel profoundly special despite this rational understanding.

This is hagioptasia at work. Your mind has taken ordinary experiences and imbued them with a quality of ""specialness"" that feels completely real and external—as if the magic exists in the actual place or event, rather than being created by your perception.

# Why This Matters More Than You Think

Once you learn to recognise hagioptasia in your nostalgic memories, you'll start seeing it everywhere:

* That inexplicable allure of celebrities and status symbols
* The way certain places (a favorite café, a scenic viewpoint) seem to possess an almost sacred atmosphere
* Your attraction to vintage items, heirloom objects, or things with ""history""
* The transcendent quality you perceive in music, art, or literature that moves you so deeply

This isn't mere sentimentality or cultural conditioning. Research involving nearly 3,000 people has shown that around 80% of us experience this perceptual tendency from early childhood. It's a fundamental feature of human psychology, rooted in our evolutionary heritage.

# The Evolutionary Story Hidden in Your Feelings

Why would our minds be wired this way? The answer lies deep in our evolutionary past. Hagioptasia likely evolved as a sophisticated guidance system—a way of marking certain experiences, places, and relationships as significant and worth returning to or seeking out.

Consider how your nostalgic feelings often center around:

* Your childhood home and family
* Seasonal celebrations and traditions
* Moments of safety, comfort, and belonging

But hagioptasia also extends to social dynamics in ways that mirror other species. Just as male deer are instinctively drawn to impressive antler displays, or peahens respond to elaborate tail feathers, humans automatically perceive “specialness” in high-status individuals—celebrities, leaders, successful peers. This same mechanism that makes childhood memories glow with meaning also drives hero worship, status anxiety, and competitive envy.

These patterns aren't random. They represent exactly the kinds of experiences and social perceptions that would have enhanced survival and wellbeing for our ancestors. The sense of ‘specialness’ was evolution's way of saying: “Pay attention to this. Value this. Seek more of this—whether it's a safe haven or a powerful ally.”

# The Double-Edged Gift

Understanding hagioptasia reveals both its benefits and its potential pitfalls:

**The Gift:** This mechanism allows us to find profound meaning and beauty in ordinary life. It's the source of our deepest aesthetic experiences, our capacity for awe, and our ability to form lasting emotional bonds with places and people.

**The Challenge:** Because hagioptasia operates automatically and feels completely real, we often mistake its effects for external truth. We chase after things—careers, possessions, relationships, experiences—believing they possess the specialness we perceive, only to find ourselves disappointed when reality doesn't match our hagioptasic expectations.

# A Path to Wiser Living

Here's the transformative insight: Recognising hagioptasia doesn't diminish the beauty of your experiences—it enhances your agency in creating them.

**Before awareness:** “I need to recapture that magical feeling from my past” or “If I could just achieve \[goal\], I'd have that sense of specialness in my life”.

**After awareness:** “I have a natural capacity to perceive specialness, and I can cultivate this in my present experience rather than chasing illusions”.

This shift is profound. Instead of viewing your current life as somehow lacking compared to an idealised past or future, you can recognise that the source of magic was always within your own perception. The song of a blackbird in your garden today is just as worthy of that sense of wonder as any blackbird from your childhood—if you allow yourself to see it.

# Practical Steps to Harness Your Hagioptasia

1. **Practice Present-Moment Awareness:** When you catch yourself feeling nostalgic, ask: “What would it be like to experience this same quality of specialness right now, in this moment?”
2. **Question Your Pursuits:** Before making life decisions motivated by a sense that something will bring you that elusive “special” feeling, pause and consider whether you're chasing a hagioptasic projection.
3. **Cultivate Gratitude for the Ordinary:** Deliberately practice seeing the ‘specialness’ in everyday experiences—your morning coffee, a conversation with a friend, the quality of light in your room.
4. **Recognise Cultural Manipulation:** Notice how advertising, social media, and status cultures exploit your hagioptasic tendencies by promising that their products or lifestyles will deliver that sense of specialness.

# The Deeper Invitation

Understanding hagioptasia isn't about becoming cynical or losing your sense of wonder. Quite the opposite. It's about reclaiming your power to experience meaning and beauty on your own terms, rather than being unconsciously driven by ancient psychological mechanisms or cultural forces seeking to exploit them.

Your nostalgic memories have been trying to teach you something important all along: You possess a remarkable capacity to perceive the extraordinary in the ordinary. The question isn't whether this capacity is “real” or “illusory”—it's how you'll choose to use it.

Will you spend your life chasing after projections of specialness that exist mainly in your perception? Or will you learn to consciously cultivate that same sense of wonder and meaning in your actual, present-moment experience?

The choice, as always, is yours. But now, at least, it's a conscious one.

I’ve somewhat soft locked myself in this new save. During Stitch’s quest to make a cup of coffee I irresponsibly made a bunch of mocha instead and used up all 3 beans without realizing he would only accept straight coffee for the quest…

I’ve seen online that I should have coffee bean bushes up in the glade but do not currently. Not sure if I have to wait a day or they just don’t appear until after this quest is complete.

Is there anyone that would be willing to let me come to their island to grab coffee beans so I can move on with this quest?

1matd5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1matd5m/does_the_crazy_cups_flavored_coffee_pods_variety/,Does the Crazy Cups Flavored Coffee Pods Variety Pack Deliver? Review Inside!,"Testing out the Crazy Cups SYNCHKG118788 Flavored Coffee Pods Variety Pack has been nothing short of a delightful coffee adventure for me. I love starting my mornings with a flavorful cup of coffee, and this 40-count sampler pack offers an outstanding variety for every mood and season. From rich options like Death by Chocolate to the cozy Pumpkin Spice, there’s something in this pack for everyone, whether you're an intense coffee lover or someone who likes a lighter brew. I've been using these pods daily in my Keurig brewer, and they deliver consistent quality with every cup.

**Design and Packaging**  
The way these coffee pods are packaged stands out right away. Each pod is individually sealed, which not only keeps them fresh but also gives off a premium vibe. The compact box fits nicely into my kitchen cabinet without taking up too much space. What surprised me the most was the meticulous care in inspecting and packaging each pod. It’s clear that quality and customer experience were top priorities. Plus, the variety of featured brands like Guy Fieri, Crazy Cups, and Skinnygirl offers a sense of indulgence with every single brew.

**Highlights**  
- A wide variety of flavors catering to both classic and adventurous tastes  
- Gluten-free, vegan, kosher, and zero-calorie coffee options  
- Contains premium brands and high-quality pods  
- Packaging preserves freshness, ensuring every cup is aromatic and flavorful  

**Performance in Every Cup**  
Using these pods with my Keurig machine has been very smooth. Each brew comes out balanced, with no mess or leakage around the edges of the pod. The medium roast brings out a full-bodied flavor regardless of the blend, which is impressive given the range of flavors in this pack. While I loved exploring the boldness of Hazelnut and French Vanilla on one day, the sweetness of Moose Munch on another brought a smile mid-afternoon. It’s evident that quality control was not compromised since even the more intricate flavors like Coconut Caramel tasted distinct and fresh.

**Usability and Flexibility**  
This is where the product truly shines. I found the pods to work seamlessly with both older and newer Keurig machines. Their universal compatibility ensures you can use them without worrying about specific models. Additionally, their vegan and gluten-free status makes them an inclusive choice for various dietary preferences. If you host friends or family often, these pods allow you to offer a wide range of options. My friend who avoids gluten was thrilled to find so many choices in this pack!

**Drawbacks**  
Despite my overall satisfaction, a few areas could use improvement:  
- Some pods lack the strong aroma associated with freshly brewed coffee.  
- Certain flavors might feel a bit too sweet for those who prefer less artificial profiles.  
- The exact variety of flavors included in each box can sometimes vary, which may be frustrating for those with specific preferences.  

**Other Options**  
Before trying Crazy Cups, I had tested Starbucks K-Cup packs and Dunkin’ Original K-Cups. Starbucks packs lean heavily on bold and dark roasts, which lacked the playful variety found in Crazy Cups. Dunkin’ is great for its classic coffee flavor but lacks the innovative combinations like Coconut Caramel or Death by Chocolate. If you value flavor experimentation, this variety pack is unmatched. That said, coffee purists might still prefer Starbucks for its consistent intensity.

**Price Performance**  
Comparing this pack to similar products in the market, it’s reasonably priced for the variety and quality you get. Unlike some cheaper packs, the flavors here don’t taste watered down, and the freshness is evident in every sip. Even premium brands don’t always include dietary-friendly coffee pods, which gives this product stronger value for your buck. The convenience of receiving 40 pods in one box also eliminates mid-week coffee runs, which is a lifesaver for a coffee addict like me.
