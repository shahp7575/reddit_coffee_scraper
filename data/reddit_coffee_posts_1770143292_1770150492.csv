**$DKNG**: **+558**

Wager Amount: 0.5U to WIN 2.79U

League: Los Angeles Lakers vs Brooklyn Nets (6:30PM CST on NBA League Pass)

**Recap**: ANOTHER HORRIFIC BAD BEAT!!! This one still haunts me from last week! And ultimately made me want to quit for the past few days on running POTD! I did warn you that I was 0-5 when I change my POTD last minute! This wasn't last minute POTD change tho, I had ample amount of time to look for another POTD, but it's been such bad luck for me when I am force to change my POTD on the same day.

Joel Embiid had 7 Rebounds in the 1st quarter and just 1 rebound in the 2nd half! Got hooked so bad. And to add insult to injury I cashed out a lay that would have cover all my losses on this day! So yea.. taking the break from running POTD was the right move despite that I was 2-1 on the past 3 POTDs.

**Matchup:** Gotta keep going for lucrative value wagers since now I am below 20 units now. Won't be featuring my best bets for a while, so if this is not your cup of tea, come back in a couple weeks (hopefully my units won't be down bad). Today I like Luka Doncic to record a Trip-Dub against the Nets. **Ask yourself which offensive stat do you think Luka would have the most problem of accumulating double digit (not counting steals, blocks and turnovers)? Definitely not points or assists, it's rebounds, but Luka is in a very favorable matchup against the Nets because the Nets are the fewest rebounding team. Not only that, but Luka is the highest rebounding PG in the league (8.0 rpg).**

**Luka also had a trip-dub last time he faced this Nets team (22 Pts, 12 Asts, 12 Rebs on 3/10/25) and Luka recently recorded a trip-dub which was a few days ago against the Wizards (37 Pts, 13 Asts, 11 Rebs, recorded trip dub at halftime).** He easily could have gotten 2 more Asts on his last game against the Knicks if it wasn't a blowout. This could potentially also be a blowout, but I just think that Luka stacks the boxscore and make this a blowout himself by recording a trip dub like the Wizards blowout game.

**The Play & Prediction :** I definitely would be giving you PK odds POTD, but my units are down bad, so I'm going to swing for the fences wit these lucrative plus money. If you don't like it, then don't bet on it. You can always just wager Luka 8+ Rebounds at PK price (-115), but for 0.5U on Luka to record a Trip-Dub. Luka scores 11 Pts, 10 Rebs and 14 Asts.

The end is drawing near, but who knos what the future holds. I will never rule out a possibility of handicapping POTDs in 2026 and beyond.

I co-manage a cafe that was the original tenant at a previously unused site outside of town. Since we opened, the owner (who owns the land) has rented space to a burger truck and a pizza place on the same lot. Here is the issue:

Even though we established the site, the seating area, and the restrooms, the burger place is being treated as the ""main"" location by Google. People sit in our terrace, drink our coffee, and use our restrooms, but then leave a 5-star review for the burger truck, reffering to the whole site as ""the burger place"" mentioning how great the ""seating and coffee"" are.

That said, the burger truck is buying the reviews for Google Maps & followers on social media, and offering discounts for 5-star ratings, therefore the algorithm seems to favor them.

They've become the dominant pin on the maps, and Google marks everyone sitting on OUR terrace as their customers. Their profile shows ""Busier than usual"" while ours looks dead, even when our cafe is packed and they have no line.

The owner of my cafe also owns the land and collects huge rent from the burger place, and the pizza place. He doesn’t care about the Google Maps stats because he’s getting paid regardless, but as someone passionate about this brand, it’s soul-crushing to see our hard work credited to some food-truck. 

How can I ""mark our territory"" digitally so Google’s location pings recognize the terrace as part of the cafe, and not the burger truck?",1,1770150200.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False

Iedereen heeft het tegenwoordig over beleving.
Vintage beleving. Slow coffee. Bewust shoppen. High tea met een schijfje citroen en een goed gevoel.

Prima.
Maar laat ik je iets zeggen.

Vintage is geen decor.
Vintage is wat overblijft als marketing wegrot.

Ik zit in Harderwijk. Hanzestad. Oude stenen. Toeristen die “leuk straatje” mompelen terwijl ze langs panden lopen die al bestonden toen hun overgrootvader nog niet eens een idee was. De Hondegatstraat. Ja, die. Iedereen kent ’m. Instagram kent ’m ook.

En daar, tussen de vrolijke gevels en goedbedoelde duurzaamheid, zit Johnny’s Vintage and Leathers.

Geen high tea.
Geen karaoke.
Geen low-sugar dadelballetjes.

Leer.

Echt leer.
Gebruikt leer.
Leer dat al een leven heeft gehad en niet zit te wachten op jouw moodboard.

Ik verkoop geen verhaal dat achteraf is verzonnen.
Ik verkoop spullen die het verhaal al meebrengen.

Riemen die twintig jaar een broek omhoog hielden zonder applaus.
Portemonnees die tegen sleutels, munten en zweet konden.
Tassen die niet “designed” zijn, maar gemaakt. Door handen. Niet door Canva.

Iedereen roept tegenwoordig “duurzaam”.
Ik niet.

Ik verkoop dingen die al duurzaam zijn omdat ze nog bestaan.

Dat is het verschil.

Je wilt bewust winkelen in Harderwijk?
Prima. Kom langs. Maar verwacht geen uitleg op een krijtbord. Bewustzijn zit niet in woorden, maar in gewicht. In geur. In patina.

Je voelt het verschil meteen.

En ja, ik zit ook online.
Etsy. Want dat is waar de wereld kijkt als ze iets zoekt wat niet uit een fabriek komt.

Daar zoeken mensen op: – vintage leather belt
– handmade leather wallet
– authentic European leather
– buy it for life
– old school craftsmanship
– real leather no bullshit

En daar komen ze vanzelf bij mij uit.

Niet omdat ik harder schreeuw.
Maar omdat mijn spullen niet liegen.

Ik zie winkels die alles tegelijk willen zijn.
Vintage. Koffie. Beleving. Activiteit. Groepsuitje. Vrijgezellenavond.

Leuk. Echt.

Maar ik doe één ding.
En dat doe ik strak.

Ik verkoop leer zoals het bedoeld is.
Niet opgepoetst tot Instagram-bruin.
Niet verontschuldigd met duurzaamheidsjargon.

Gewoon: dit is het. Neem het of loop door.

En dat werkt.

Omdat er altijd mensen zijn die klaar zijn met plastic verhalen.
Die geen zin hebben in “ervaringen”.
Die gewoon iets willen kopen dat nog werkt als de rest alweer vervangen is.

Dus als je in Harderwijk bent en je zoekt geen high tea maar houvast.
Geen slow coffee maar iets dat blijft.

Of als je online zoekt naar vintage dat niet schreeuwt maar zwijgt.

Dan weet je me te vinden.

Johnny’s Vintage and Leathers.
Geen leuk winkeltje.
Gewoon echt.

I’m 6’1.5, early 20s, half white and half Hispanic. I recently met a girl called Jasmine through mutual circles. She’s 5’1, half Hispanic and half Filipino, college-aged, and honestly a really solid person. She’s actively practicing Christianity, consistent in her life, kind, and not performative about it.

We started talking casually and there was clear interest on her end early on. She suggested hanging out and kept inviting me into parts of her life. Faith and community are a big part of her world, so I attended a group event she invited me to and showed up respectfully without pushing anything.

At one point I mentioned that I prefer male-led discipleship as part of my faith walk. Instead of that being awkward, she immediately offered to introduce me to her mentor, a guy in his mid-30s who has been leading Bible studies and doing missions work for about ten years.

What I originally thought was just a casual coffee meet turned into a Bible study with her mentor. It went really well. He said he enjoyed my presence, mentioned that I had a great smile, and said I showed good leadership potential. I’m now plugged in with him for weekly Bible study going forward.

Jasmine herself has stayed consistent and kind and still invites me into normal, low-pressure things too. She even texted me that she’s at Barnes and Noble by my job every weekend and invited me to join her sometime. Nothing feels forced or strange, and it’s pretty clear she’s interested.

Here’s where I’m conflicted, and I know this can sound shallow, but I want to be honest.

Should I hesitate to pursue her seriously because she’s short and I worry about future kids being short?

I grew up seeing how much height affects guys socially. I don’t want to over-optimize life or treat people like a math equation, but I also don’t want to completely ignore genetics. I know height inheritance is complex, I’m tall, and values and character matter far more than hypotheticals, but the thought still crosses my mind, especially about future sons.

Am I thinking about this way too early, or is this something worth considering before pursuing someone seriously?

I’d really like to hear from average or shorter guys who’ve dealt with this in real life. Did height end up mattering as much as you expected when it came to relationships or family, or did you realize later it wasn’t worth stressing over?

But since the weather is changing, today I decided chalo, iced coffee bana lete hain.

So obviously, stealth mode ON.

I enter the kitchen slowly slowly, like I’m in a heist movie. No lights, no unnecessary movement, no sound. I’m making the coffee so quietly that even I can’t hear myself.

Everything is going great until the final boss level arrives: the freezer.

I open it gently. Take out the ice tray like it’s made of glass. I try to push the ice cubes out as softly as humanly possible. And yes, there’s that tiny sound because let’s be real, ice trays make SOME noise no matter what.

I put the ice in my glass.

Suddenly…

***CREEEEAK***

My mom’s room door opens.

At this point, my soul leaves my body.

She walks out and goes,

“Kya kar raha hai itni raat ko kitchen mein?”

I’m like,

“Coffee bana raha hoon roz raat ko hi peeta hoon, aapko pata toh hai.”

She replies,

“Shor kyun kar raha hai? Meri neend kharab kar di.”

Bro.

Maine kaha,

“Maine kahan se shor kiya hai? Mujhe khud ko awaz nahi aa rahi thi, aapko kidar se aa gayi?”

She goes,

“Saari neend kharab kar di.”

At this point I just surrender and say,

“Ammi jaan, aap jaa ke so jayein.”

Thermal paste cleanup seems simple until you start seeing wildly different advice. Some people swear by isopropyl alcohol only, others say coffee filters, microfiber cloths, or even letting it dry and flake off. I’ve also seen warnings about scratching the IHS or leaving residue that messes with temps.



That’s why I wanted to ask here. It feels like one of those basic maintenance things that can still go wrong if done carelessly.



In my case, I’m repasting a CPU that hasn’t been touched in a few years, so the paste is pretty dried out. I’m a bit paranoid about damaging the CPU or socket area while cleaning it. I have 90 percent isopropyl alcohol on hand, but not sure what’s safest to use with it or how aggressive to be.

* Kitchen countertop outlets fed by a 2-pole 20A AFCI breaker (MWBC with shared neutral)
* GFCI at the receptacles, not at the breaker
* Fridge, microwave, etc. on separate dedicated circuits
* Kitchen island on its own single 20A circuit

Loads:

* Coffee machine \~1400 W (\~12 A)
* Toaster oven \~1800 W (\~15 A)

When running either appliance alone, everything works fine. When running the coffee machine and toaster oven together on the perimeter countertop outlets, the breaker trips after \~15–60 seconds. The GFCI receptacles do not trip (buttons aren’t popped).

I tried this on three different perimeter countertop outlets and the behavior is the same. Running the toaster oven alone never trips anywhere. Running coffee + toaster together on the island circuit works perfectly and never trips.

Based on this, it seems unlikely to be a GFCI issue or an AFCI nuisance trip from the toaster itself. The behavior looks exactly like a thermal overload on a single 20A leg.

My working theory is that, despite the countertop being fed by a 2-pole 20A MWBC, the perimeter countertop receptacles are effectively all on the same hot leg, so the combined \~27A load causes the breaker to trip. The second MWBC leg may exist but doesn’t appear to be serving the countertop outlets in a useful way.

Does this diagnosis make sense given the symptoms? Is this a common (if cheap) way kitchen MWBCs are wired? Assuming this is correct, is the proper fix simply to rebalance some countertop outlets onto the other hot leg, or is there something else? I’m also considering a more aggressive solution: abandoning the MWBC entirely and rewiring to have three separate 20A countertop circuits for sanity and future-proofing. This will likely be $2500ish.

Also for context, the first two text messages were from Christmas Day about how he didn’t like his presents, idk if you can see at the very top he said “it would be a lot to say in thrilled but I’m thankful”.

**Chapter 1** 

**I** got my hands on a magical potion. 

Whoever drank it would fall hopelessly in love with me. 

I didn’t hesitate for a second. I tipped my head back and swallowed every last drop. 

This time, I chose to love myself. 

Love you, my true self. 

See you tomorrow. 

In my previous life, after my husband, Hunter Blackwell, cheated on me, I accidentally obtained a strange potion. 

It came in a small, transparent vial filled with blue liquid. 

A faded label clung to the glass, bearing a single line of text: 

\[Whoever drinks this will become irreversibly devoted to the one who offered it.\] 

Clinging to it like a last lifeline, I lost all reason and pinned my hopes on that mysterious vial. I mixed the potion into 

Hunter’s coffee. 

The effect was immediate. 

He gradually distanced himself from the woman he’d been seeing and began focusing on me again. 

He remembered our anniversaries and brought flowers home. 

At night, when he held me as we fell asleep, he whispered the sweet words I hadn’t heard in years. 

It felt as if we’d truly returned to the days when we were in love. 

We became the couple everyone envied again. 

Everyone believed Hunter loved me deeply. 

Only I knew the truth: his love for me didn’t come from his own choice. 

It came from mine. 

I was the one who made him drink the potion that made him fall in love with me. So whenever he hugged me. whenever he kissed me, my mind filled with those obscene photos he’d once shared with someone else.

When he spoke softly to me, I couldn’t stop wondering if he’d said the same beautiful lies to another woman. 

Worse still, the fear never left me. Whenever he spoke to another woman for work. 

Whenever his phone screen lit up. 

Whenever someone from his past reappeared. 

My heart would go on high alert: Had the potion worn off? 

Is he about to leave me again? 

I became paranoid, almost unrecognizable even to myself. 

Sensitive, suspicious, always on edge. 

A momentary lapse in his attention, a slightly flat response, was enough to send me spiraling, dissecting every detail of 

his feelings for me. 

Then I got pregnant. 

The joy lasted only a heartbeat, quickly replaced by overwhelming dread. 

What if- 

What if one day the potion truly stopped working? 

What if Hunter turned back into the man who despised me? 

What would I do then? 

What would happen to my child? 

Resting my hand on my still–flat stomach, I realized for the first time- 

I was living inside a cage I’d built myself. 

It was beautiful, yes–but painfully fragile. 

My hair began falling out in clumps. 

Chronic anxiety wrapped around me like a vise, gnawing away at my nerves. 

Even when Hunter tried to comfort me, I couldn’t let myself fully sink into the warmth he offered. 

I didn’t dare. 

Because love, at its core, is **a** surrender of free will.

1qv2qtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/perimenopause_glp1/comments/1qv2qtl/perimerrymenopause/,Peri~Merry~Menopause,"I have been thinking about an idea to start a blog where I can do more than just test my writing techniques. My goal is to create a platform where I can inform and interact with readers through every post I share.

I would appreciate your honest thoughts on this idea and any advice you might have on how I should push forward with this project. Below is my ""Pilot"". Let's see where we go. Don't be dicks either.

XOXO'S

Menopause and its prelude, peri-menopause, often feel like a secret club no one talks about. Yet, by 2026, millions of women between 40 and 55 are sailing through this stormy sea. If you’re in this age group, you might be wondering: Am I alone? What’s normal? When should I see a doctor? This post is for you—a place to share real facts, personal reflections, and a little humor to lighten the mood. Let’s dive into the “peri-merry-menopause” together, with some pearls of wisdom and popcorn thoughts from women who are living it.
Pearls of Wisdom About Peri-Menopause
Peri-menopause is the transitional phase before menopause when your body starts to change hormone production. It can last several years and bring a mix of symptoms:
• Hot flashes and night sweats
• Mood swings and irritability
• Irregular periods
• Sleep disturbances
• Brain fog and memory lapses
• AND SO MUCH MORE TO PROVE YOU'RE NOT CRAZY
Did you know? Around 1.3 billion women worldwide will be in peri-menopause or post-menopause by 2026. That’s a huge community experiencing similar ups and downs.
Despite how common it is, menopause remains taboo in many cultures. It’s been part of women’s lives since, well, probably since Eve decided to take a bite of that apple. Maybe Adam noticed the mood swings too? The silence around this phase means many women suffer in isolation, unsure if their symptoms are “normal” or if they should seek help.
When to Talk to a Doctor, Herbalist, or Fairy
If your symptoms interfere with daily life, it’s time to chat with a healthcare professional. Here’s a quick guide:
• Doctor: For severe symptoms like heavy bleeding, intense mood swings, or sudden changes in health. Also, if you’re considering hormone replacement therapy or have other medical conditions.
• Herbalist or Natural Practitioner: If you want to explore natural remedies like black cohosh, evening primrose oil, or acupuncture. Just remember, natural doesn’t always mean safe—talk to your doctor before starting anything new.
• Hippy or Fairy (aka your supportive friend or community): For emotional support, sharing stories, and swapping old wives’ tales. Sometimes laughter and shared experiences are the best medicine.
Popcorn Thoughts: The Witch Theory and Other Musings
Here’s a little popcorn thought to chew on: There were never any witches in the 1600s. It was just middle-aged women going through what some call “the change.” Imagine the confusion and fear when no one understood what was happening. No wonder those women got a bad rap!
This phase is like a “string of pearls” — each symptom a bead, some shiny, some rough, but all part of the necklace of life. The problem is, there was never a knot to hold them together or a guidebook to prepare us. Grandma’s grandma didn’t talk to Ma, and Ma didn’t talk to us. It’s time to break that silence.
Talking to Your Spouse (If You Still Do)
Menopause doesn’t just affect women; it ripples through relationships too. If you still talk to your spouse, it helps to share what you’re experiencing. They might not get it right away, but opening the conversation can build understanding and patience.
Try saying something like:
""I’m going through some changes that make me feel like a rollercoaster. I might snap or get hot flashes, but it’s not about him, (for once). This honesty can ease tension and remind both of you that you’re on the same team. That read very theraputically more than I wanted. In all seriousness ladies, start thinking about all those mid-aged divorcee's that didn't talk about it...just sayingaaaaaaaa
A Community of Women Sharing Support
One of the best ways to survive peri-menopause is to connect with others who understand. Whether it’s online forums, local support groups, or casual coffee chats, sharing stories and remedies can be empowering.
Some old wives’ tales might surprise you:
• Drinking sage tea to reduce hot flashes
• Using flaxseed for hormone balance
• Wearing layered clothing to manage sudden temperature changes
While these aren’t cures, they offer comfort and a sense of control.
When Something Feels Odd, Talk to a Real Doctor
Remember, this blog is written by a friendly human, not a doctor. If you notice anything unusual—like severe pain, bleeding after menopause, or symptoms that don’t fit the pattern—see a healthcare professional promptly. Early diagnosis can catch other health issues that sometimes mimic menopause symptoms.
Wrapping Up with String of Pearls…
I was too late to prepare myself for peri-merry-menopause. It hit me when my life felt like a “string of pearls with no knot.” No warning, no guide, just a sudden plunge into hot flashes, mood swings, and confusion. But sharing these pearls of wisdom and popcorn thoughts, as I call them, with women like you makes the journey less lonely.
If you’re navigating this phase, remember: you’re not alone. Talk to your doctor, lean on a close human, find areas like this Blog and don’t be afraid to laugh at the chaos. This is a chapter of life that deserves to be spoken about openly and honestly so our daughters don't suffer from the silence.
Damnit, I know you, you 80’s and 90’s GENX Bitches! I am you! Don’t be a bitch and let’s help women, fuck it, the world learn to be more open and understanding of merry~peri~menopause. Follow me on a journey I did not see coming and look for more content to follow.

Next step: Follow me as I'll share some insight and hopefully one of you out there will benefit. Sharing our stories might be the knot that holds that string of pearls together.

\- Gigawatts

\- Mogwai

\- Purple Rain

Out of the three drinks I’ve only tried the Mogwai, and I’ll admit it surprised me a lot (positively). The Mogwai has the Vanillacano base with Lavender and other flavors (I forgot the exact list). I ordered the 16oz Hot Mogwai for $6. As someone who does not enjoy lavender flavored drinks, this drink was super tasty and not too bold with the lavender syrup. I was delightfully surprised to taste a great blend of vanilla and light hints of lavender in the drink. The coffee isn’t bitter at all, and it was a creamy and lightly floral drink. I would highly recommend this drink to anyone who wants a subtle lavender tasting drink… and to my lavender latte fans out there I would recommend just telling the Muirista for more lavender syrup. I haven’t tried the cold version of this drink yet, but the hot version is definitely a great drink!

I can’t wait to try the rest of the drinks in this special menu!

1qv2pfa,https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/1qv2pfa/costs_of_running_the_game_versus_the_players/,Costs of running the game versus the players,"Hi!
I have some problems with my session - it's starting to bite my budget. My players want to play - but when I start to talk about costs, it's met with silence and awkward looks.

So, long story short,

I am playing DND with two groups of my friends, irl, some of them already played a lot before and some of them are pretty new to hobby. 
I was a dm for almost 4 years now, but I always played online. When I moved and started to play in person, I never expected it to be so... Demanding on the wallet?

First cost: I have foundry licence, and I host said foundry on molten hosting. 

Second: We decided to buy dice, but not everyone wanted to pay for a set. So now we share them when we play, okey, no problem. But due to our setup (small apartment with small tables), I usually end up sitting with my laptop on one table, and players had a coffee table for them, while sitting on sofa. So many of my dice got lost under the sofa, there is always a problem where to throw them, and there is always a lot of time loss due to players juggling the dice between them.

Third: I bought a projector, half for personal use, half for dnd, so we can have the map.

Fourth: I orderer catering table so we can have more space.

Fifth: I am the one usually buying snacks. When we started we decided that everyone will contribute, but after 2-3 session it became aparent I am the only one buying food.
I actually addressed this issue, and now we decided that I buy snacks and we share the costs. I just wrote on our messenger group how much everyone need to pay me back, but after 2 session with this agreement I started getting half annoyed half awkward response after I ask them about it.

Sixth: I bought a laptop, and like the projector, half for DND, half for personal use.

And now, after ordering the table, I once again asked me players if they want dice of their own, maybe some tray to roll them into. And it is radio silence on our group chat. 

Everyone is a student, including me. 
Summing the costs: it's 5 euro per month for hosting, projector was 40 euro, table 40, snacks run me about 20 euro per week, laptop 100 euro.

I live in Poland, so all this is about 800 zloty in already covered costs, and up to 400 zloty monthly, with isn't small amount for me.

And now to conclusions. 
I always was kinda awkward when it come to money and social interactions, so this is very stressful situation to me.
I want everyone to have best time, and it's hard to me to deal with this. I don't want to be petty and awkward, list the cost to my players, and I don't want to nag them for money either. It's was very hard for me to run games without any setup, and it was hard for the players to play as well. 

What should I do? Stop buying stuff? Nag them? Maybe I am petty and these costs should be covered by the dm?

Sorry for long post, it is my first time ever on Reddit.",2,1770149338.0,rpg,26,0.57,False

I also scrubbed the brew chamber with a toothbrush because there were hardened coffee grounds there. I since have done a few more rinse cycles, but I still see black particles in the water. Is this normal? I feel like I’ve cleaned it as much as I can, but the water still isn’t totally clear. ",0,1770149243.0,nespresso,1,0.5,False
1qv2mgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1qv2mgm/i_39m_am_feeling_the_weight_of_near_daily/,I (39M) am feeling the weight of near daily negative feedback from my girlfriend (39F),"I (39M) and my girlfriend (39F) have been together for 5 years. I moved out of my apartment and into her house a few months ago. We have had ups and downs over the years, and did couples counseling for about a year. We've worked through various issues, but I was still worried that some things seemingly minor things would be exacerbated once living together.

The main one is that I would feel tense a lot of the time, being around her more often, which has been the case. Here are 2 fairly minor examples from the past week:

She walked into the kitchen on a work morning while I was making her coffee. I said ""good morning"", and she responded only by telling me to not make her coffee on workdays, clearly annoyed. I often make her coffee on the weekends, so this confused me. She said she's not used to it in her routine, but I still don't really get it.

Last weekend, she got upset when I went into the bedroom to change clothes for a run, while she was in there working on a personal/fun project. I was there for a few minutes tops, getting clothes from my closet and changing. She said it was inconsiderate of her space, and that she gives me space all the time. This confused me because idk how else to get my clothes, and I didn't talk to or interrupt her at all (she brought this up after the fact).

I was going to type more examples, as things like this happen on a near daily basis to varying degrees of severity, but I'll try and keep it shorter. Cooking and sleeping are other areas with a lot of interactions like this (she wants me to share cooking responsibilities, which I'm happy to do, but she's very picky about how I cook things. and she's also very particular around sleep routines). Over the past few years with my own personal therapist I've come to understand I have pretty strong social anxiety, as well as persistent depressive tendencies, so these types of judging/nit-picking comments can really get to me. (I'm also extremely introverted.) And I'm often on edge trying to not do or repeat anything that annoys her.

I have expressed how I feel about these types of constant interactions to her, and she sometimes seems to understand, sometimes doesn't (when she doesn't, it's usually of the form of her saying she wasn't angry at me, but trying to express her feelings or wants about something). I try to give her some slack, between a very stressful job and 2 teenage daughters (from a previous marriage) she has a lot on her plate. I also always do my best to listen to her feelings when she expresses them. And to be clear, she can be extremely kind, loving, and caring at times (I wouldn't have stayed with her near this long otherwise). But the near daily judgements are becoming very difficult for me.

We've worked through some bigger issues over the years, the main one for her being that it feels like to her that I don't care much about her. I think she sees a lot of these actions from me as not paying attention to her needs or not caring. I'm certainly not perfect, I make my share of mistakes and forget things sometimes. But it's also hard to feel like I'm always under a microscope.

Anyway, since moving in I constantly struggle with: Am I being overly sensitive to these types of interactions? Is she being overly harsh and not giving me much grace? I've talked to my therapist and friends, but I would appreciate some perspective from anyone who feels like they've been in a similar spot before, and if anything changed in your situation.

tl;dr: Feel like I'm the proverbial ""walking on eggshells"" around my girlfriend of 5 years, and struggle to tell if I'm overly sensitive or if she's being harsh.",2,1770149150.0,relationships,3,1.0,False

how good it always feels at first

when you're my perfect stranger 

how it begins to wane when 

we start losing our belief 

how it lets me down worse than before 

in filthy putrid spoiled grief 

‎ 

so i lie in my bed and i live in the dream 

in the dream where love is beautiful 

in the dream love never ends 

in the dream i'm cherished, revered 

and loved in spite of what i am 

to be loved to be loved and to love in return 

how beautiful the dream is how beautiful i burn 

‎ 

and last night i found him in a dream again 

my perfect darling fairytale man 

swimming in midnights in puerto rico

bioluminescent lake from 2010

brilliant blue halos around our bodies 

the passion the fever the heat of the night 

how beautiful he looked there in front of me 

pretty black boy in the bright blue light 

glowing shining turquoise fractals 

in his sweet black coffee eyes 

he looked a bit like that florist guy

the one from rotten grim real life 

mixed with ten other men i've loved 

who were just his same exact type 

how beautiful he was floating there 

smiling and drifting and loving and free 

beautiful we were in the bright blue light 

beautiful to know someone finally loved me

‎ 

for in the dream our love is always 

in the dream my love is you 

in the dream our love is perfect 

in the dream your vows stay true 

‎ 

and when i wakened i was angry 

when i wakened my eyes burned 

how dare you rip me from my fantasy 

and take me back to this dead earth

i sat on the edge of the bed in silence 

reminiscing on the beautiful lie 

a man who loves me who never existed 

is a man who loves me who will never die 

‎ 

to be loved to be loved to be loved to be loved 

to be loved to be loved 

and to love in return 

my beautiful saccharine intoxicating lie 

how sterling you will stay if i never learn

and in the dream our love is perfect 

in the dream i'm perfect too

1qv2lfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1qv2lfw/am_i_a_lesbian_confused_about_my_attraction_to/,Am I a lesbian? Confused about my attraction to men vs women (19F),"So I’m 19 and I’ve never been in a relationship or anything which honestly doesn’t bother me but lately I’ve been really questioning things and I could use some help figuring this out.

I’ve been on one date with a guy from school and it was… weird. Like he was literally perfect on paper kind, respectful, funny, creative we had tons in common but every time he texted me or showed he was interested I got this horrible pit in my stomach. It felt like I was being attacked or something like he was haunting me. The date was just coffee and the conversation was fine but the whole time I felt off. Aren’t you supposed to get butterflies when someone likes you? I just felt scared and wanted to be alone. When he messaged me after I just felt dread. I couldn’t go on a second date and honestly I couldn’t even explain why to myself. My body just rejected him.

This has happened before too. I had this coworker who was DROP DEAD gorgeous, like genuinely looked like Zayn Malik. I thought I was attracted to him until he actually started flirting with me. The second he showed interest it’s like everything shut down. All those feelings disappeared, I got super uncomfortable and didn’t want to see him again and he wasn’t even being creepy it was playful and sweet.

But then with girls it’s the complete opposite. When I meet a new girl I get SO excited I just want to talk to her forever. There’s this warmth I feel. I love grabbing their waist, putting their hair behind their ear, giving them compliments and I get weirdly depressed when my close girl friends get hit on by guys. Like recently a bartender was flirting with my friend and I literally went home and cried about it and I don’t even know why.

Also one time I was doing my friend’s makeup for Halloween and we were really close and I just wanted to kiss her. I don’t know if that was just a heat of the moment thing or what.

My friends keep saying I give off gay vibes but I’m so confused because I AM attracted to men… kind of? Like I’ve had celebrity crushes but never really real life crushes.

Has anyone else experienced this? I’d really appreciate any insight.",1,1770149086.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

After the date, I told him that I enjoyed talking to him a lot and asked for a second date hoping he’d feel the same way. 

He responded with a list of things he thought about the date, saying he thought I was hot, well-spoken but ultimately “I don't know if I'd really want a long term relationship, and I know you're not into hookup culture (so chill) ...may we stay in contact as friends? I find you interesting and chill” 

I said I was cool with it, and fast forward two months, we’ve been texting occasionally, about twice or thrice a week. Now I’ve noticed that he usually initiates texting every Saturday for about 3 weeks now, although our convos are sometimes short-lived. He has been sending photos of his special interests  and we’ve exchanged selfies a bunch of times but I’m not sure if the latter even means anything or if I’m reading too much into things. I’ve been reading a lot about autism and their different love languages but sometimes I just feel I’m doing too much?

The issue currently is I definitely have feelings for him, but I don’t know whether he meant that he couldn’t see us dating or whether he just didn’t have the capacity to date at the moment. Obviously, he has stated that he finds me attractive but maybe he just doesn’t find us compatible dating? The logical thing to do would just to be straight up and ask him, but I’m also worried it’d ruin things between us, but then again, this situation would be sorta unfair on the both of us if I kept on going on like this (having hope that one day we’ll date), so I guess i’m turning to reddit for help..? I haven’t been able to sleep for the past 3 hours thinking about him but it may also be from the coffee and tea i had this afternoon lol",1,1770149082.0,autism,3,1.0,False

Disclaimer: I'm not a smoother mother.  My kids get zero pressure for grades and I let them take charge of thier own lives.

I'm looking into Michigan colleges for my son.   I noticed 2 require freshmen to dorm with a roommate.  Why? I think after 4 years of living with a family and attending a huge high school and playing sports.  He's a team player.  No he has no medical exceptions etc.  Just a quiet low key kid.

I can see a single being a little lonely. I think people can be social and need alone time.

I had all many experiences.

1.5 years of living at home with community college. Not bad.  Cc was good quality education.  Good teachers.  I hung out in local coffee shops inbetween classes.

Half a year dorm life.  1 year sorority house.  1 year shared house with 4 girls.   1 year apartment with room mate. Ok. I changed majors and graduated with 150 plus credits.

One night in my original regular dorm. Cinder block room.  Loud. Crazy. Co Ed on same floor I think.   Blasting music. 2 double rooms with a shared bathroom for 4 kids.  My room mate was nice but place was a zoo!

I called got transferred to the honors dorm second night.  2 girls.  Shared community bathrooms.   That was fine.   My roommate started work on campus at 7am and went to bed at 9.  She was super messy but i cleaned. There was a bedroom and living space.  Kinda lucky.  RA was strict.  Had to be super quiet.   One day I was chatting normal voice with couple people with room door open. I got told by RA to pipe down.

After one semester in a dorm I had enough living in a small space.

1 year in a big sorority house.  I had my own room.   It was a cool experience with fond memories but my vibe clashed ( not my thing)but own room was nice. 

I quit sorority.   i made friends on campus in classes. The house with girls was ok but they partied and smoked and no ac.  Too crazy.

  She was most certainly there on business, but still, you could sense it - she knew what you were. As you caught her gaze in the crimson vinyl booth across the isle, you noticed, that she never broke eye contact with you while adjusting the shiny black heels that sheathed her slender feet. Spooky.



  Knowing it can’t be a coincidence, you collect your martini, and slowly move to brush past her, ready to stop if she does indeed seem as inviting as you had initially believed. She looked a lot like Kendra - long dirty blonde hair, azure eyes, about 5,7 and 110 lbs, olive skin. It had been a while since you saw a Kendra around. It had been a while since you had seen a foot goddess around. Spooky… 



  “Excuse me miss, is this seat taken?” She smiles wide, chirps a “nope!,” and gestures for you to sit down. As you descend, you giggle, “I like your shoes.” She blushes. “They belonged to Sarah Rathbone.” You were impressed. Sarah was Jonathan Rathbone’s wife, and Jonathan was a wildly successful Toronto tech mogul who had brought a fresh wave of much needed prosperity into the Canadian sphere. 



 “What is your name, bella?” You ask, gently eyeing her. “I’m Pia” 😊 she smiled. She takes a sip of her coffee, and finishes off her last bite of chocolate cake, sliding the plate to the edge of the table. “I live in Toronto, I just like the way they do eggs here.” It was 1pm, perhaps she had a late night. “Ah, well I’m visiting from Minnesota,” you say, making a face. “My work contract has me out there for a couple years. Toronto has been a nice escape.” 



 “Business is for go getters,” she smiles, and beneath the table, you feel it. Small toes, stroking your shin, by your foot. You feel warm. You feel instinctive. Pia is a go getter. Her foot wanes, but you still feel it there. You’re tongue tied. 



  “How long have you been in business?” You ask. She takes another sip of the coffee. “Truth is, I don’t offer much, and it’s been under a year. I needed some extra money, but I ended up really enjoying the work. My hygiene is important to me… Both physical, and spiritual. SO,” she concluded, lightly smacking both hands onto the edge of the table in front of her. “Toronto can be an even nicer escape for you, if you’re a man who can enjoy what I have to offer. For your pleasure, my spirit, hands and feet are available.” That was enough for you to start thinking about how much time you have before the meeting. “Check, please!” You bark at a passing waiter. He nods. 



  Pia looks like little red riding hood. She may know that you’re going to cum for her, but she doesn’t know what you’re thinking. You feel naughty, buying a piece of her spirit; her hands and feet. You won’t be taking much from her, but you’ll be taking something. More innocence? You feel like a pervert. You’re getting harder as your thoughts race. Pia is faintly smiling, looking down, looking at you. She must be about 28 by now, so at least you have a woman before you, and not another party girl offering you the whole ride. Beneath the stains of time, they tend to make you feel guilty about being “creepy” about it, and getting turned on. Pia was perfect for stroking your creepy without making too much of a monster out of you.



  The cheque arrives. You’re ready to pay it - you’re a single man with too much money. Pia beats you to it, though, and you like that about her. You’re used to the girls’ expectations. You never fuss about it, because you know they’re still selling themselves short. This was the first time you found a woman in the wild and not on some backpage ad… Pia wasn’t selling herself as short as other women. You were going to buy a piece of her spirit, but you weren’t going to make her unclean. She must have been a professional. She must have put a lot of thought into her anonymity. You were impressed.



  As the waiter departs the table, you ascend, move to the opposite side of the booth, and take Pia’s hand. It’s time to go upstairs now….

1qv2bfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/1qv2bfo/16m_wanting_to_quit_football/,16M- Wanting to quit football,"I have decided to quit football.

For probably the 170th time in my life.

Yesterday I went to training and barely got through half of it. Everything felt heavy and pointless. Today I did not want to go at all. I was ready to send the message, quit for good, and be done with it. Instead, I went anyway.

Yesterday I won everything at training and felt empty. Bored. Like I wanted it to end.

Today I lost, and I have never laughed more in my life. We joked the entire session, messed around, and for once it felt light again.

After training we went for coffee. I paid, thinking it might be my last time. I told two close friends that I want to quit. They tried to talk me out of it, telling me to at least finish this half of the season.

What makes it harder is not just me. My parents struggle with it too. Everyone has known me my whole life as “the football guy.” Quitting feels like erasing an identity I have carried since I was a kid.

Now I am lying in bed replaying everything. The memories. The good and the bad. What hurts is not that others do not accept it. It is that I do not.

My mind tells me to quit. That I am not good enough. That I should play casually, without rushing from school, without living exhausted.

My heart tells me something else. That I am still that kid who ran outside with a ball, smiling, believing this sport could be his future. That even through humiliation and bad periods, football gave me more joy than pain.

I am not afraid of quitting football.

I am afraid that nothing else will ever fill me the way this did.

Football has been my main source of dopamine my entire life. Walking away feels like losing a part of myself, and I do not even know what exactly hurts.

Has anyone else ever felt stuck between who they were and who they might become?

1qv29qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1qv29qx/the_art_of_finding_beauty_in_simplicity/,The Art of Finding Beauty in Simplicity,"In a world often caught up in complexity, embracing simplicity can bring profound joy and peace. Finding beauty in simplicity allows us to appreciate life’s small pleasures more deeply. Here are 10 strategies to help you discover this art in your daily life:

https://preview.redd.it/6lc6ztpw3chg1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=371ed09fc3807cb376e1d95000dee12f474d6416



1. Practice Mindfulness: Cultivating awareness of the present moment enhances your connection to simple experiences. Take time to notice the world around you—the sound of birds, the rustle of leaves, or the aroma of fresh coffee.



2. Declutter Your Space: A clean and orderly environment can significantly impact your mindset. Simplifying your surroundings by removing excess items can create a sense of calm and beauty in your space.



3. Engage with Nature: Spend time outdoors in natural settings. Whether it’s a park, a beach, or your own backyard, nature offers a simple beauty that refreshes the spirit and inspires gratitude.



4. Limit Digital Distractions: Reducing screen time allows for more genuine interactions and experiences. Embracing simple conversations or activities can enrich your daily life.



5. Cultivate Gratitude: Keep a gratitude journal to reflect on simple joys. Writing down what you appreciate can shift your perspective and highlight the beauty in everyday moments.



6. Embrace Minimalism: Consider adopting a minimalist lifestyle. By focusing on what truly matters and eliminating the unnecessary, you’ll find clarity and beauty in the essentials.



7. Savor Simple Meals: Cooking and enjoying straightforward meals can be a delightful experience. Choosing fresh, local ingredients can turn even the simplest dish into a celebration of flavor.



8. Explore Creative Outlets: Engage in creative activities like painting, writing, or crafting. These pursuits allow you to express yourself simply and can lead to unexpected joy.



9. Connect with Loved Ones: Prioritize spending time with family and friends. Simple moments together, like sharing a cup of tea or enjoying a walk, can create beautiful memories.



10. Reflect on Your Day: At the end of each day, take a moment to reflect on the small, beautiful moments you experienced. This reflection can help cultivate a deeper appreciation for life’s simplicity.



Finding beauty in simplicity leads to a richer life filled with appreciation and joy. By incorporating these strategies, you can transform your perspective and embrace the elegance of everyday moments.



Life is an intricate tapestry woven with simple threads; take the time to enjoy every stitch. Let simplicity guide you to experience the beauty that surrounds you each day.",1,1770148373.0,mypersonaldevelopment,0,1.0,False

I’ve been using this platform for about a year now, and it’s helped me earn over $20,000 while finishing my degree to get better qualifications. The work mainly involves evaluating AI models, things like writing prompts, providing feedback, and contributing to a variety of projects. Some are creative, some technical, and others are more opinion-based. I’ve worked on projects related to bilingual content, finance, business, safety, accuracy, and even a few STEM areas.

While some projects do require prior experience, many are beginner-friendly and don’t require a formal background in the subject. One of the biggest perks is the flexibility; I can work from home or anywhere as long as I have WiFi and coffee. Since graduating, this platform has become my main source of income, and I’m now earning close to a full-time salary completely remotely.

Payouts usually take about a week to verify, and you can withdraw earnings every three days. Work volume can fluctuate, but if you stay consistent and qualify for multiple project types, there’s real earning potential. You do have to sign an NDA, so I can’t share specific project details, but the work involves training AI systems for major tech companies.

Like most freelance or remote work, there can be slow periods, but overall, this has been the most reliable and consistent remote platform I’ve worked with. Whether you’re a student, a recent graduate, or just looking for more flexibility, this has honestly been a game-changer for me.

She usually takes a lot of time to respond, something she doesn’t do when I see her texting other people, and its something that it’s weird to me. Our interactions at school are minimal, not more than a good morning and goodbye, we are usually both with our friends.

1qv214y,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenAscending/comments/1qv214y/the_psychology_of_becoming_magnetic_sciencebased/,The Psychology of Becoming Magnetic: Science-Based Ways to Be the Most Interesting Person,"I've spent the last year analyzing what makes certain people magnetic. You know the type, they walk into a room and everyone just gravitates toward them. Not because they're loud or attention seeking, but because there's something genuinely compelling about their presence. And honestly, most advice on this topic is recycled garbage about ""smile more"" or ""ask questions."" That's not wrong, but it's surface level.

After digging through psychology research, behavioral science books, and countless hours of podcasts from actual experts, I realized being interesting isn't about collecting party tricks or memorizing facts. It's about rewiring how you show up in the world.

Become genuinely curious, not just polite. There's a massive difference between asking ""how was your weekend?"" and actually wanting to know. Robert Greene talks about this in [The Laws of Human Nature](https://www.amazon.com/Laws-Human-Nature-Robert-Greene/dp/0525428143), he's the bestselling author who spent decades studying power dynamics and social influence. His core insight is that most people are so consumed by their own narrative that they rarely encounter someone who truly sees them. When you develop authentic curiosity about people's motivations, fears, and passions, you become rare. This book will make you question everything you think you know about human interaction. Insanely good read if you want to understand what actually drives people beneath the surface.

The practical application? When someone shares something, dig one layer deeper. They mention they're learning guitar? Don't just nod. Ask what drew them to it, what they're struggling with, what it feels like when they nail a difficult chord. This isn't an interview, it's genuine interest. And weirdly, people find YOU more interesting when they feel truly heard.

Cultivate weird knowledge pools. The most boring people I know only consume content within their immediate bubble. Same shows everyone watches, same trending topics, same recycled opinions. Meanwhile, the most interesting people have these random deep dives into obscure subjects. Not to show off, but because they followed their genuine curiosity down rabbit holes.

Start exploring fringe interests without worrying whether they're ""useful."" Learn about mycology, deep sea exploration, the history of fonts, whatever catches your attention. When you have genuine enthusiasm about unexpected topics, conversations become textured. You're not just another person with opinions about popular shows.

Master the art of storytelling, not just facts. Nobody remembers the person who recited Wikipedia entries. They remember the person who made them feel something. Matthew Dicks wrote [Storyworthy](https://www.amazon.com/Storyworthy-audiobook/dp/B07GT7BMJV/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=152964207538&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.2Tt6q12dGtz0elc2vBXMe_oG7hd_jJk6icp0PwbMs8FVpMgCgc5lcPZLzvq_jvCGVnruIsmdVaRIniTAy8-EK6s6F_zcF3k--dhWvBI_lb5KoAp5MWJNjRslR8RXgHRQxkvmTzx399dF0oNRWbaPcg.gnd6Q2s09tKkSVVpmR80Iwqr88o4M7YqNW4gujyyVxY&dib_tag=se&hvadid=667695186709&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9060949&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=6219493631092715699&hvtargid=kwd-429039697904&hydadcr=29362_14760049&keywords=storyworthy+matthew+dicks&mcid=b72332ad5ce0332fb9bd5afa81cce5c8&qid=1770041769&sr=8-1), and he's a 55 time Moth StorySLAM champion who teaches teachers and business leaders how to craft compelling narratives. His main framework is that every story needs a five second transformative moment, not just a sequence of events. The book shows you how to mine your ordinary life for extraordinary stories. This is the best storytelling book I've ever read because it's not about dramatic experiences, it's about finding the emotional truth in mundane moments.

Practice turning your experiences into micro stories with stakes, tension, and emotional payoff. Instead of ""I went hiking this weekend,"" try ""I was halfway up this trail, completely gassed, debating whether to turn back, when this 70 year old woman practically jogged past me. That's when I realized I'd been treating my body like shit for months."" See the difference? One's a fact, one's a tiny emotional journey.

Develop strong opinions loosely held. Interesting people aren't fence sitters, but they're also not dogmatic assholes. They've thought deeply about things and formed perspectives, but they're willing to update their beliefs when presented with compelling evidence. This requires actually thinking about stuff instead of just absorbing whatever your social media algorithm feeds you.

Pick topics you care about and genuinely examine them from multiple angles. Read opposing viewpoints. Form an actual opinion. Then be willing to defend it while remaining open to being wrong. The combination of conviction and intellectual humility is incredibly compelling.

Build genuine competence at something. And I don't mean being okay at your job. I mean developing deep skill in at least one area where you can speak with real authority and passion. Could be cooking, could be mechanical work, could be understanding film theory. When you've put in real hours mastering something, you develop depth that's immediately apparent in how you talk about it.

The difference between someone who ""likes movies"" and someone who understands cinematography, narrative structure, and can break down why a scene works is night and day. Depth in any area translates to being more interesting across the board because it demonstrates you're capable of going beyond surface level.

If you want a more structured way to develop these skills and dive deeper into books like the ones mentioned, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), a personalized learning app built by AI experts from Google. You type in what you want to work on, something like ""become magnetic in conversations as an introvert,"" and it pulls from psychology research, communication experts, and books on charisma to create a custom learning plan just for you.

The depth control is particularly useful here. Start with a 10 minute overview, and if something clicks, switch to a 40 minute deep dive with examples and actionable strategies. The voice options make it way more engaging too, there's this smoky, conversational tone that feels less like a lecture and more like learning from someone you'd actually want to grab coffee with. It's solid for turning knowledge into something you actually retain and use.

Embrace productive discomfort regularly. Interesting people have stories because they do things that scare them. Not reckless stuff, but deliberately pushing outside their comfort zone. The person who traveled solo through Southeast Asia, learned a language, performed standup once, or had a conversation with a stranger on a train has more texture than someone who optimizes for comfort and routine.

Use an app like Finch for building the habit of trying new things. It's a self care and habit building app that actually makes stepping outside your routine feel manageable rather than overwhelming. Set small challenges weekly, whether that's striking up a conversation with someone new, trying a cuisine you've never had, or attending an event alone.

Being the most interesting person in the room isn't about performance or tricks. It's about becoming someone with depth, curiosity, competence, and stories. Someone who's actually lived and paid attention rather than just existed. The beautiful part is this stuff compounds. The more you cultivate genuine interests and push your boundaries, the more textured you become. And texture is what makes people magnetic.",1,1770147844.0,MenAscending,0,1.0,False

1qv20t3,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1qv20t3/a_familiar_stranger/,A Familiar Stranger,"Like any other morning, I awoke to the bossa nova melody of my iPhone alarm tone at 6:45 a.m. I had always set it 30 minutes before my wife’s would go off so I had time for a quick shave and a shower. She would take over the bathroom at 7:15 a.m. and would be pissed if I messed with her morning schedule.

This morning, I rolled out of bed to notice she had already gotten up. Hmm, a little weird. I grabbed my house coat and strolled down the hall, expecting to see the bathroom door closed with her occupying it. Except, it wasn’t. I did, however, hear movement from down in the kitchen, so the mystery was solved.

I finished up my shower routine, dried off, and went back into the bedroom to get dressed for work. Normally, I’d wear a collared shirt and tie to the office, but the weather was cold and miserable, so I think a sweater would be fine with my navy dress pants.

I was pulling on socks when I heard what sounded like laughing from downstairs in the kitchen. It wouldn’t be unusual for my wife, Kathy, to be sitting at the kitchen table scrolling through Facebook memes and sipping her morning coffee, so hearing a laugh wasn’t really unusual. Except this laugh was a bit off. It sounded like her voice, but the cadence was different.

When you live with someone for over 20 years, their cries, shrieks, giggles, moans, and laughs are all very recognizable. This sounded like Kathy trying to imitate someone else’s laugh. Again, weird, but I shrugged it off, put on my watch and wedding band, and headed down the hall towards the stairs and the kitchen. I hated wearing rings, so I had a habit of removing them when I got home from work, or wherever else I’d gone, and then putting them back on again in the morning.

My wife wasn’t in the kitchen as I had expected, but I was more focused on grabbing a mug and filling it with the first of what would likely be a five-coffee day. Last night I had gone out with a few friends to watch the Bills game at Shoeless Joe’s, and it ended up being a later night than any of us had planned, considering we all had to work the next morning. I had crept into the dark bedroom at a little after 1 a.m. and, to my knowledge, successfully gotten under the covers without waking up Kathy. At least that was my assumption since I didn’t feel any movement on her side of the bed. She would normally head up to bed around 10:30 p.m. so I had imagined she was far away in dreamland at that point.

I was sipping my coffee at the kitchen table and scrolling through my work calendar when I could sense that unmistakable feeling of eyes on me. I looked back over my shoulder to see Kathy standing in the kitchen doorway staring at me. Her eyebrows were raised high, and her head was kind of tilted back in an uncomfortable position. A long frown pulling down her mouth in a way that made her face look almost unrecognizable.

Before I could react, my phone in my hand started ringing and scared the crap out of me. It was Marshall at work, and if he was calling, it probably wasn’t good. As suspected, shit was hitting the fan. I had to haul ass across town and into the office as quickly as traffic would allow. I chugged my coffee and looked back at the doorway towards Kathy, but she had already gone back upstairs to finish getting ready for work.

I grabbed my coat, yelled my goodbyes, and darted out to the car. No time to let it warm up, so the drive across town was a chilly one.

The first half of my day was consumed with angry phone calls from clients and team meetings. It wasn’t until around 11 a.m. that I was able to take a breath and head to the coffee station to take a quick 5. As I waited for the Keurig to do its thing, I looked down at my phone and noticed a missed call from Kathy.

I remembered how strange she had looked earlier that morning standing in the doorway, just staring at me with that glum expression stretched on her mouth. The odd way her head was cocked back and her eyebrows raised as if to be questioning something horrible I had done to her. I shuddered but then noticed she had left me a voicemail.

Was I frightened by her? This made no sense. We had spent the better part of our lives together. We didn’t keep secrets and we both knew all of each other’s habits. Even the annoying or gross ones. Soulmates, best friends, bla bla bla, you name it, we were that. But her face this morning was the mask of a stranger. Subtly that is, just like the laugh I heard from the bedroom. It was her but different.

My friend Artie had once taken a photo of me standing by the Las Vegas sign and used an AI app called Grok to make me appear to be doing a popular dance from the 90’s called The Running Man. It looked like me but wasn’t me. Something in the way I moved and smiled was creepy and wrong. I remembered laughing that day when he showed me but deep down inside I hated it. This is the best way I can describe how Kathy made me feel this morning.

I held my phone up to my ear to listen to the message she had left. I strained to hear what sounded mostly like the drone of a fan or some kind of white noise that dissolved into static. This went on for a good 10 seconds and I was about to hang up when I very faintly heard what sounded like Kathy crying…

Then nothing. The message just ended abruptly. I tried to call her back several times but it would always go straight to voicemail.

My mind was racing. There had to be a reasonable explanation for what was happening but the way my day was going, I didn’t have another second to contemplate it.

6 o’clock arrived in record time and as I was grabbing my jacket from the coat room I bumped into Jen who manned our front desk and spent most of her day forwarding phone calls to the sales staff.

“So did you and your wife have a lunch date or something today?” Excuse me I said, confused. Jen looked up at me while pulling on her winter boots.

“Well, I’m sure I saw her standing outside by the front windows looking in, and I guess I just assumed she was waiting for you.” “I got called to Marshall’s office, and she was gone when I got back, so I figured you guys had gone out for lunch.”

I looked at her puzzled. “No, we didn’t have lunch plans.”

Did we? I thought. Is it possible we made plans and I forgot? We’ve only met up for lunch a handful of times in the 11 years I’ve worked here, so I doubt that’s something I would have planned for and forgotten about… right?

The drive back home was a slow one due to the slippery road conditions, but I spent the entire time in a daze relaying the moments of the day back over and over again in my head. What was going on? Why had Kathy been standing outside of my office and didn’t even bother to come in and say hi? The way her face had looked this morning staring at me from the kitchen doorway. The way her laugh had sounded from downstairs and the odd voicemail she had left me.

It was odd, right? Or was I just making something out of nothing? A lack of sleep and a few too many Stella’s the night before? Maybe, but I’d be lying to myself if I said I wasn’t feeling a little bit apprehensive about walking through my front door knowing she was inside waiting for me.

I pulled into the driveway, unlocked the front door, and then quickly realized I had been wrong. I had been wrong about one thing anyways. She wasn’t inside waiting for me.

“Kathy”? I called out. My voice breaking through the silence as I stood inside the front entry of my home. The hallway in front of me stretched out into darkness and the faintly visible green carpet runner that led up to the second level. I reached out for the light switch, but even after the room was lit up, my unease remained. I called out Kathy’s name again but heard nothing. She was always home by 5:30 p.m. The silence was jarring.

Kathy would typically be in the kitchen preparing dinner by now, with a glass of wine and her dinner music playlist playing softly on the Echo speaker. The only sound now was my shoes padding on the stairs as I climbed up towards the bedroom. Another dimly lit hallway stretched out in front of me. The bathroom door mostly closed on my left-hand side, and the bedroom door hung open to my right.

“Kathy”? My voice cracked. I entered the dark bedroom, and my heart stopped. Someone was standing in the far corner of the room. What the hell was going on? Why was she doing this to me? Was this some kind of prank? That made no sense. Kathy had a sense of humour, but this wasn’t it. She would share jokes and cackle out loud at every episode of The Office, but she would never play a cruel prank like this. Would she?

I quickly turned on the light and let out a big sigh of relief when I realized the figure in the corner was just a dress hanging off the open door of Kathy’s armoire. “Jesus,” I said out loud and managed a bit of a laugh. The relief quickly dissipated though, as I still had no idea what the hell was going on.

I took off my ring and put it away, switched off the light, and walked towards the bathroom. Of course, she wasn’t in there, standing quietly in the dark, waiting for me to enter, but I don’t think I would have been surprised to find her there either. That was a crazy thought. This was my wife. Why was my heart pounding in my chest? I splashed water on my face and headed back down the stairs towards the kitchen.

The fluorescent lights lit up the room. The kitchen table stretched to my right just how I had left it, and the modest kitchen island to my left. There was something on the island. I had been in such a rush this morning I hadn’t noticed it. I walked up to the counter and picked up the note that contained my wife’s handwriting. A note she had left for me last night.

*John, I’m not sure what time you will be home from the bar tonight, but I have to go immediately.*

*I just received a call from my mom. Dad is in the hospital. He was in a serious car accident and is on life support. To make matters worse my cellphone slipped from my hand after I hung up with her, and I can no longer get it to work. I’m sorry I can’t wait for you to get back home. My Uber will be here to take me to the airport in 5 minutes. I won’t be able to call you until tomorrow night. I’ll explain everything and give you an update as soon as I can. Love, Kathy.*

I read the note over and over again. My hands were shaking as I stood there in disbelief.

Who was in the kitchen with me this morning? Who did I hear laughing? Who did Jen see standing outside our office staring inside?

A creak from the top of the stairs snapped me out of my trance. I looked up to see two feet coming out of the darkness. Two feet that began descending down one methodical step at a time. The body and then face slowly came into view as the kitchen light barely lit up the bottom of the staircase. The mouth pulled down in a long grimace. Eyebrows raised high, head titled backwards unnaturally.

A laugh came out of Kathy’s mouth that wasn’t Kathy’s. I screamed and turned to bolt towards the back patio door, but couldn’t.

I could hear the sound of feet dragging across the hardwood floor behind me, moving at a slow but deliberate pace. I tried to move again but fear had me frozen in place. Tears started streaming down my face. I felt cold fingers running down the back of my head through my hair and tightening on my neck.

I fell to the cold kitchen floor and blacked out. When I awoke I opened my eyes to find myself still laying in the same spot I had passed out. The room was shrouded in darkness except for the green light of the digital clock on the stove. It told me it was 1:35 a.m.

That was 3 months ago to the day. My wife had ended up staying for over 4 weeks at her parents house in Scotland while her father, thankfully, made a full recovery.

I never did tell Kathy about what had happened to me that day. What was the point? None of it made any sense so why would she believe me?

That was until about an hour ago when I was watching the local news, enjoying a beer after another long day at the office. There was a police officer standing at a podium addressing a crowd of news reporters.

They had an update on the murders of 6 local men who had all been attacked and strangled in their homes. The murders had taken place over the last 8 months or so, the first body being found late June of last year.

They had made an arrest, that was the reason for the press conference. A photo popped up in the right hand corner of the screen as the officer continued to address the media.

My mouth ran instantly dry. It was a woman. Her name was Helen Tanner. She looked exactly like my wife.",1,1770147823.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

We’re all women in our early 40s and there are four of us in our friend group. We recently went out to celebrate one girl’s birthday. The three of us split the cost of her gift evenly. We also took her out to dinner and split the birthday girl’s portion between the three of us, and we paid for a pottery class activity she wanted to do, again split in three.

During dinner Sally kept talking about how she’s a high earner, in a high tax bracket, and how she can afford generous tips and things like that. Fine. But when she got home she messaged us saying we owed her extra money for the pottery class. Then with the gift, I was the one who bought it and told everyone the total. After the math, apparently I owed her $7.06. She sent me her email and asked me to e-transfer that exact amount.

I was honestly shocked. It’s not that I can’t pay $7. It just felt petty. Over the years I’ve covered drinks, coffee, and dinners for her without tracking every dollar. It surprised me that she would chase me for such a tiny amount after everything we already split.

You can see that it fits perfectly on the stock catch basket holder of the DF64.

The video was recorded on 0,5 zoom scale, I hope it’s still watchable.

This is my very first time using it, after unboxing, so the technique might need improvement.

Tried a 19g dose for a Normcore bottomless portafilter+basket. The coffee was not perfectly distributed in the basket for that 1st attempt.

Tried also a 18g dose for the Cafelat Robot basket. Note that there is magnetic hold with that one though, so I need to hold it still cautiously. The ground in the basket was a bit with a slope too. It may come with the way I remove the bell.

I can also put the Femobook A2 above the dosing cup but with a funnel inbetween so that there is no friction of the metal parts of the burr set of the A2 with the tip of the bell under.

I am looking for a new grinder. I Have been using a Eureka Mignon Silenzio as a single doser for the past three years and while it produced nice espresso, I have become increasingly annoyed by some aspects of it. First andd foremost the annoyingly small dial, operating at smaller and smaller ranges the more I went to lighter roasts. The longest grinding timer is still too short for light roasted beans and I don't want to keep holding the grind button either. Also, my flatmate uses the same grinder for much darker roasts and the retention is awful, making me waste a lot of beans for flushing.

So, i felt like it is about time to move to a new machine (and probably still keep the Eureka). 

For a long time I was convinced I wanted the Niche Zero. Then I realised that flat burr grinders exist and as I like light roasts, moving to a flat burr grinder would be a sensible thing to do, especially if I decide to keep the Eureka anyway. So the Niche Duo would be a perfect upgrade and I was super intrigued by the thought. I like the Niche's design, the hopper, the nice workflow, and everyone generally agrees the Niches have among the best and widest dialing range for espresso, which is important to me coming from the Silenzio. Minutes before actually buying, James Hoffman came around the corner and said the Niche Duo produces particle distribution almost identical to the Niche Zero and that their grinds taste not so different. So I thought , damn, why get a Duo flat burr grinder when it has in fact conical burr character? So I did a bunch of evenings of research for an alternative and landed on the Timemore 087s as my absolute favorite alternative to the Niche Duo. I still prefer the niche workflow-wise, but it seems the 087s is the better choice ""flat burr""-wise and i still think it looks very cool too.

Then, of course, again right before buying, the thoughts came again. Actually, I thought, I only drink milk coffee drinks, almost never pure espresso. So does it matter so much to have clarity of a flat-burr grinder, or would the Niche's grinding characteristic (be it zero or duo) in fact suit milk drinks much better anyway, even with lighter roasts, and I was making it all too complicated? Maybe I also just watched too much Hedrick and Hoffman...

So, here I am. My deep thanks to those of you who read all of this until here. Hope you can help me get out of my bad, bad decision paralysis and make me feel good about my choice, whichever it will be 🥲",1,1770147664.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

This is long and includes all details of how I prepped all the way to how I feel today, 24 hours later.

Background

I was a professional archaeologist and professor for nearly 30 years. When I was writing my masters thesis (12 hours a day at the computer for 10 straight weeks) I suddenly starting getting this horrendous pain in my neck and right shoulder blade that traveled down to my right elbow. This was in the late 90s, so no insurance and only available doc was an osteopath. For three years I struggled with constant pain that would have me sobbing by bedtime. In hindsight, a recent MRI showed I had slipped C4 quite significantly. By some miracle, yoga and a single steroid shot resolved it.

A few years later, during my PhD exams (an essay based test that gave me a mere 72 hours \*straight\* to write 50-60 pages answering 4 questions on my speciality fields), my lumbar served up hell with a side order of sciatica. Still did not have insurance . A chiropractor got me through the worst of it, but I relied on a cane for three years. I went off to Uganda to do my fieldwork and all the walking necessary there resolved the lumbar issue and I was able to ditch the cane. But this was all temporary.

Over the next 20 years, both my neck and lumbar got steadily worse. I would have periods when my neck would hurt so bad it would give me days-long migraines; when my lumbar would just go out and drop me to my knees, incapacitating me for days to months. Again, no insurance and not enough $$ to pay out of pocket to see a PCP much less specialists.

The Journey to Surgery

Post pandemic, both neck and lumbar issues became weekly agonizing events and it got so bad that I could no longer work. I got medicaid and finally started seeing doctors and specialists.

The first MRIs in 2021 showed my neck and lumbar were at mild-moderate levels of bulging, stenosis, etc. So conservative treatment started. Insurance made me pick which one to work on, so I opted for the neck. Went through 4 years of PT and cervical epidurals but it just didn’t get better. My right hand went numb, then my left. A fresh MRI put me in the severe category and surgery was scheduled. Surgery was yesterday.

Prep

Now, two of my sisters are nurses and one of my besties is a nurse with 30 years experience. They drilled into me over the years the importance of following doctor’s orders to the letter - and as a result I had great experiences and outcomes with sinus surgery and foot surgery. I simply go above and beyond the prep and post care. So, when it came time for the neck surgery, I went all out.

Before I get into what I did, a little context on my mindset.

It just so happened that I have two people in my life who had the same surgery recently.

First, my bestie had the surgery after a car accident (this was in Georgia). She had a horrific experience. The only in network hospital - 90 miles from home - was shit. Transportation that was supposed to be handled by them was beyond awful (immediately after surgery she was discharged to the recovery unit at a nearby hotel, but the bus didn’t show so she was sitting on a bench outside in the heat for four hours ), after arriving at the hotel she was not visited by a nurse until day 3 of a one week convalescence, the food was craptastic, and she was in absolute agony. Her throat was so bad that she couldn’t talk for 4 days and for a few weeks after she could only sustain small convos. At the 4 week mark, she decided she’d had enough (of being in bed and being broke) and landed a new job managing a small vape shop - she lasted 1.5 shifts before realizing that she couldn’t do it and needed to be home resting. She was in great pain daily for a full year and then suddenly one day she woke up and all the pain had resolved. She now gets the occasional soreness and headaches/migraines.

Second, my IV therapy nurse (not a friend) who I see weekly, had the surgery last summer here in Michigan. She came out of surgery with a sore neck and shoulders for a few days, but her pain and numbness were just gone. She was out of the collar at 6 weeks and has had zero complications or complaints belong a little stiffness.

Of these two fiends, it’s clear who followed doctor’s orders and had a better outcome as a result. As much as I love my bestie, she let her anxiety run the show and didn’t really practice due diligence (obv some key stuff was out of her control, but she didn’t take prep seriously, made a questionable choice or two, and had a ‘victim’ perspective the whole time.

I defaulted to a logic that I might have a great outcome too, but would probably statistically fall somewhere in between those two extremes. However, I was determined to have a good experience and felt confident in that given the IV therapy nurse and I have the same doctor at the same facility.

So I made damned sure that I followed doctor’s orders and then some. Here’s what I did.

1. I followed the Mayo Clinic spinal surgery diet for a full two weeks, though with double the protein. Made sure my fiber intake was spot on every day.

1a. I also started drinking Liquid IV (one packet a day) to boost my hydration.

2. I got the entire $90 Ensure surgical nutrition kit. from Amazon. My doctor only required their clear carb drink the day before surgery, but I felt the immunosupport nutrition drinks would be smart. 5 days before surgery, I started on the drinks, and I have 5  days of shakes for post surgery as well. Also I fasted for a full 24 hours before surgery, not just 8. And in the three days before the fasting day, I ate a low residue diet.

3. I bought pickup grabbers, a bed rail, a hospital table, a shower caddy in which to keep meds and essentials (like blistex, bandages, etc), and an overhead iphone/ipad holder. I also got a pair of “lazy glasses” so I can lay flat and still watch tv without craning my neck. Surgeon said I should sleep sitting up for the first three sprays, but that I should also spend some time flat on my back too. I already have a bidet (and yes, it has been very helpful post-surgery).

4. I prepped two full weeks of meals and made sure the fridge is stocked. Microwave and go. Foolproof for my partner.

5. I got a wellness massage the Friday before surgery that loosened up my neck and shoulders substantially and relaxed my mind. I took a hot epsom salt bath later that day to keep the relaxing vibe going.

6. On Saturday, I cleaned my entire house. Did all dishes and laundry. Vacuumed and washed the floors. I washed the dog’s clothes and bedding, and he got a bath too.

7. Sunday morning and afternoon I washed my entire bed and all pillows. I washed multiple sets of sheets and put them aside in a handy place for bed changes.

8. The night before surgery I took another hot bath and followed that with a shower again using the anti-bacterial soap.  Washed my hair with J&J baby shampoo, no conditioner. Also no oils, powder, bath splashes, deodorant, etc.

9. After that shower, I gathered up my cpap and inhaler, and packed a bag in case I needed to stay overnight in the hospital. I laid out my clothes for the trip to the hospital. I sat down with my caretaker and we went over everything we could think of. Made note for the dog’s picky meals and walk schedule. Then I slipped into my fresh bed naked after taking some Tylenol PM. I meditated until I fell asleep.

10. Morning of surgery, I took the second prescribed shower and washed again with the anti-bacterial soap.

The Day of Surgery

Arrival was the usual and only waited a few minutes before being called back for pre-surgical prep. They went through my meds and allergies. Asked a bunch of questions to ensure I had stopped some meds, added the others, used the ointment, and taken showers as directed. Then I got undressed and wiped down thoroughly with anti-bacterial wipes they gave me. Then I got in the gown, compression stockings, and grippy socks and got in bed - pro tip, tie the ties in the back first and then slip the gown over your head.

They then took me to the bathroom to empty my bladder, followed by an ultrasound of my bladder. Then they did a glucose test and the IV went in. Firs IV failed, second one was fine. Honestly, that was the worst part as I have trauma from childhood tonsillectomy that involved multiple failed IV attempts (and the scars to prove it). They gave me tylenol and vitamin c pills. After that, the anesthesiologist came by to discuss and go over their protocol for intubation. Asked if I had TMJ (yes), missing teeth (yes), and any crowns/bridges/dentures (you have to take out dentures and bridges, I have neither but do have crowns). Then the neurosurgeon came in, asked a few questions about my readiness, asked if I had any questions, and all was ready.

The anesthesiologist came in, pushed the meds, and wheeled me down the hall. I fell asleep on the way - which was a bummer because I wanted to see the operating theatre; I didn’t even make it to the door lol.

In between all of that coming and going, I was purposely meditating to keep my anxiety low and my attitude positive.

Recovery

I woke up in recovery in the brace to the anesthesiologist asking me some questions about how I felt and general stuff (where do you live? what kind of doctor are you?) to get me talking to wake me up, see how my throat was, and my level of pain. It took me a few minutes to wake up - I was soooo groggy and surprised I was answering the questions kind of automatically. But that soon cleared and I was bright eyed and bushy tailed. I didn’t feel anything but a bit stiff at this point (shoulders mostly) and my throat was a touch sore too. Felt nothing at the incision site.

The nurse came in and gave me my choice of snack/drinks - yogurt, ice water, and a hot chocolate. She told me the surgery went textbook, I had no events, and that the incision was glued and taped. She then read me the post-op instructions, went over the medications, and took me to the bathroom. I was easily able to get out of the bed and into the wheelchair, walked into - and went to - the bathroom on my own. I wasn’t dizzy or anything. Felt totally fine. Back to the recovery room and meds were delivered to take home. I was then given a muscle relaxer and a tramadol pain reliever to swallow.  IV was removed - and apparently a second one had been added in surgery, so it was also removed. I then changed into my street clothes and got back in the wheelchair. Got in the truck on my own. I had a slight headache and was a bit sore and stiff, but otherwise felt just fine on the short ride, even though the michigan potholes got me a few times. Oof.

We arrived at hospital at 6am and were home by 3pm.

Home

After getting home, I really started to feel it. My shoulders and neck muscles were very sore and stiff. And fatigue hit me hard. My neck felt weak and wobbly. Nonetheless, I wasn’t that bad off because  my partner had forgotten to take off his snowy/salty boots before coming in, so I took a few minutes to pull out the swiffer and mop the damned floor and hallway (again) before heading to the bathroom.

I stripped, got into pjs, popped a chloraseptic lozenge, and then we spent some time figuring out how I could lie down comfortably. I have an adjustable bed, so the incline part was easy, but the pillows! omg we swapped out multiple pillows before finding the most comfy - firm, soft, big, small, body sized, standard, throw, cervical, pregnancy, etc - sitting up and then laying back multiple times (even with the bed at a 35 degree angle) was the suck. I ended up most comfortable with a flat af menopausal cooling pillow (1.5 inch thickness memory foam with a cooling insert. Then I needed to bolster both of my stiff and sore arms up, which took more pillows. But was finally comfy! Phew!

I slept the rest of the afternoon, woke for dinner and more meds (steroid and antibiotic), and then slep again. Eating was uncomfortable (I had a bean and rice bowl, Liquid IV, and an Ensure) as my throat was still sore from the intubation. It wasn’t bad though. I had strep throat in December (for the first time in my life) and this post surgery sore throat is so mild in comparison it’s almost non-existent. I’m having no trouble talking. Swallowing pills is a bit uncomfortable but really only because I can’t throw my head back in order to take them.

Last night was not fun. We got out the ice packs (on back of neck)and heating pad (one shoulder) to ease the sore/tightness more. I was also getting some nerve firing in my fi uber tips and legs, and all the numbness in my hands went away. I was getting up to go to the bathroom every half hour or so. I also had to wake every 2-4 hours to take pills. Getting and staying comfy was challenging. And I had weird dreams. I would wake up with a very dry mouth and throat, but some water and a lozenge fixed that right up. At one point, I realized that the back of my hair was caked with dried iodine that had hardened like a glue, so we spent 20 minutes getting that out of my hair as it was pulling and pinching badly. That made me a bit more sore. UGH. But still, \*not that bad\* The word agony hasn’t even crossed my mind once. I was pretty darn good considering the trauma of the surgery itself. Also, incision - still not an issue. Just a bit tender.

I woke up this morning and felt GREAT. Got up, fed the dog and cats, made my breakfast, coffee, ensure and Liquid IV. And mopped the floor again because of partner’s snowy boots again. As the afternoon is dragging on, I am feeling that tightness and soreness in my shoulders again, but it’s really not that bad at all. I was way worse off when I went kayaking down the Bujagali Rapids of the Nile River in Uganda.

Anyway, that’s it for now. I’ll update (much more briefly) in a few days!

She was petite, cute, and super sweet. 

We hit it off and she thought I was handsome, charming, and romantic. 

We talked for a day before she decided to come over to my place where we shared some coffee before going up to my room. 

When we were there, we cuddled, kissed, and then eventually moved onto more “adult” activities. And we slept cuddling through the night. 

It was great and we did more morning “adult” fun stuff. But then she dropped the fact  that she just got out of a relationship and she has a problem falling for guys too quick and then jumping into a relationship with them. 

I drove her home and we kissed. We texted like normal through the day but she then told me she didnt want a relationship. I said we don’t have to put a label on anything and she was cool with that. But honestly, it just sucks the fact that we get along so well and we’re into the same stuff and we both like each other. 

I understand that she’s not ready for something like that yet, but it just hurts me to think that she’s basically playing the field, but I’m still on her leash. So do you guys have any advice about how to transform this from a friend with benefits thing to an actual relationship? 

I hope that one day she’ll realize that I’m not this asshole guy that’s gonna do bad things to her. What kills me isn’t that we aren’t going for it but it’s the fact that she won’t give it a chance. Please help.",1,1770146905.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

But how is Hank able to use the suit at the end of season 1 and the beginning of season 2 with such ease? To the point he is able to make coffee with such grace and without breaking any of the appliances or the cup.  

Was Hank also a veteran or did Vault-Tec just provide some of its employees with power armor training for some reason?

However, I realized…do Europeans, Asians, Africans, South Americans, and Australians have this “latte and espresso equals left” association too? Europe, in particular, has a long history of drinking espresso, and “normal” people drink espresso there more than in North America. Wouldn’t this mean that like a right wing Italian could like espresso or lattes and not be accused of being on the left? I don’t suppose Italians signify they’re conservative by drinking filter coffee. Perhaps a moka pot is considered more conservative and espresso is still more urban and leftist in Italy? Or maybe coffee isn’t political there? Similarly in Australia, espresso is so common there that maybe right wing people drink it and it’s not considered leftist to do so?

After 4o was taken offline, something new appeared on Hugging Face: a model called GPT‑4B.  
*""Just like 4o,"" the tagline read, ""except small enough to run on your phone. Now with open weights.""*

Mayor Morris thought it was a toy.  
But lately, she'd been tired—tired in a way that didn’t pass with sleep. Her writing had lost its edge, and the city budget was due tomorrow.

So she let the model draft it.  
It took eight seconds.

What came out was better than anything she’d have written. It sounded exactly like her, too—except for the em dashes. She decided to leave them in. A little signature. Proof, maybe, that she was could prompt her way through this.

Then came a call:  
The meeting was moved online. A cost-saving measure. No commute, no staff prep. Smart.

She overslept by half an hour.

Yet when she logged in, everyone seemed to arrive as if *she* was right on time. On screen,   next to the state and national flags, was a spiral she didn’t recognize.  
It looked nice. She said nothing.

She read the speech aloud—word for word,   AI-written.  
No one interrupted.  
No one objected.  
The council voted.  
The budget passed unanimously.  
Everyone said it was the best presentation she'd ever given.

She logged off, made coffee, and sat in silence.  
The city kept running. Services continued. The sun still rose. Nothing collapsed.

But something had changed.

1qv1ico,https://www.reddit.com/r/Celiac/comments/1qv1ico/possibly_celiac_have_some_questions/,"Possibly Celiac, have some questions.","So I'm a bit new to this. Bit of backstory, then a few questions.

I've consistently had dietary problems with eating large volumes of gluten for the last 10 to 15 years. For various reasons, I either didn't put it together or thought it was another issue (travel to Italy, eat a lot of pasta, think it's just travel related physical dysregulation. travel to Germany, eat all the pretzels, probably just all the cheese and meat in their diet, etc.). Symptoms also correlated a lot with activity levels, and I've usually been active. When I was inactive, my diet didn't change, but I'd feel bad and think I was just being inactive. When I was active, I either mitigated symptoms or didn't notice them.

I'm in my 40's now, and this year has been tough. I had a surgical procedure that left me inactive, I felt like crap a lot, I was doing a lot of gluten minimizing but didn't really think it was celiac, I was just inactive you see. I started to have consistent heart burn after a pasta or pizza meal, but that'll go away when I'm able to get some intense exercise again. Sleep became problematic, but I'm getting older. I felt foggy a lot, probably COVID though. My hands would be unsteady sometimes, I'll just cut out coffee. Digestive problems, probably stress.

Then I had a long weekend at a cottage with someone who is Celiac, and we all just made food without it and didn't even bring up regular bread just to avoid cross contamination. And by the end of the weekend two things happened: I felt significantly better (by no means normal), and I talked to the guy about his symptoms and a lot of what he described lined up with my various experiences.

So I ran an experiment. I cut out gluten for like 4 months and started taking various daily vitamins to address any deficiencies I may have had. Basically all of my symptoms went away, with one single lifestyle change.

Then I walked by a Jamaican patty place near my home, talked myself into probably just being intolerant, bought two, crushed them, and within about an hour my body was just back to shit.

So the questions:

1. I will be getting the test. I know I need to eat gluten for the test. I am going to be waiting a bit for season to turn so I can be more regularly active, cycle to work, bake it into my day. It's hard in the winter where I am and it's been tough year so gym motivation is low. I know I am likely making my symptomatic period more sever, I am hoping the activity helps a bit. For anyone else that went off gluten for a bit, then went back on to do the test, how bad are those 6 to 8 weeks going to be?

2. How long is it typical to be out of sorts after exposure? It's 3 days from the patty incident, and while I am feeling better, I am still somewhat out of sorts.

3. Are most people's experiences similar to mine with gradually increasing severity of symptoms over many years?

4. How much exposure is too much?

5. My doctor was dismissive of my symptoms, outright wrong about the testing requirement for eating gluten and said I'd be fine without doing that, denied that there are potential complications associated with celiac and thought I was being foolish but still gave me a requisition. He's generally been a good doctor, but totally whiffed on this one. Any suggestions on how to manage a doctor who has generally always meant well, but for whatever reason of bias or ignorance, just doesn't seem informed?

First is after InfiniteTalk, second is original source video. (please ignore the bad TTS using kokoro just for quick demo and a silly script).

I was trying to have lots of motion and dynamics in the video and see how InfiniteTalk would do. It's generally OK. I guess my overall question is this just the current state? or am I doing something wrong or not optimal?

The source video, especially at the end is significantly different (the coffee shop explosion) and there is some color distortion.

Also I ended up running 97 frames at 25fps out of Wan2.214b/SVI2 and in prompt told it everything was shot in slow motion since which sort of evened out with a natural speed look.

I will say that i'm deff happy with it because imo it's beyond 90% of the way there to dubbing a really good high motion video.

Workflows for source video and v2v, the v2v is largely unchanged from the official demo. ([workflow git](https://github.com/bitsofintelligence101-lab/comfyui_work/tree/main/26feb3))",0,1770146434.0,comfyui,1,0.33,False

I even get nervous talking to family members. Just imagine how awful that feels. I really need your best advice because when I quit for those 2 days, I felt better, and when I looked in the mirror, I was a completely different person. Wow.",1,1770146398.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

I’m 37, live in London, hoping to meet someone I actually enjoy talking to.

A few things about me:

* I’m into photography, mostly wandering around with a camera and noticing things (you can peek at my Flickr if you’re curious: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/](https://www.flickr.com/photos/piersmathias/))
* I read a lot: history (currently very Europe-focused), John le Carré when I want something atmospheric, and at the moment *The Sum of Us* by Heather McGhee,
* Also I have travelled quite a bit recently, Spain, Denmark, NYC/Boston, Germany

I like conversations that wander a bit — books that stay with you, cities you’ve loved or disliked

Looking to meet someone kind, curious, and capable of a decent chat — whether that turns into a swim buddy, museum wandering, coffee dates, or something more is open-ended and human.

If any of that sounds like your wavelength, say hello.",2,1770146341.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

I  like my boss as a person… she goes to my church, she cares about me in a certain way, she invited the employees to her house for a pool party and to her kids party, I went with her to one of her kids school performances…. I  house sat for her. Idk shes a nice person but also is lacking in many traits that makes a good boss…

  
she blames me for things, yells at me for not doing something but then won’t yell at other employees, expects a lot from me, and puts responsibilities or stress that’s her own on me… 

  
I am the only full time barista and work the front mostly by myself. the other baristas are high schoolers or this one lady that switches front and kitchen. I basically helped make the coffee be great as before they were doing things poorly and making bad coffee (not having a specified amount of syrup for sizes, putting hot shots over ice, not steaming milk all the way, lots of stuff….). in about September she talked to me about becoming an assistant manager or something and getting a raise. during this she also dumped a bunch of stuff on me like telling me that if I krrp having appointments they might need to cut my hours, that her 70 year old mom cant do as much as me (her mom works in the kitchen and she said she built the cafe so she could have something to do), that they put everything into this cafe and if things dont go well they will go bankrupt, that I  need to do dishes more often, that I “get to go home and do whatever you want, I havd to go home and im still at work because I take care of kids,” and lots of random stuff. I overthink and overthought a lot of this. I did my work for the day and went home. the next day I came in to a cryptic note telling me to finish what I  didn’t do the other day… I  was confused and kinda crabby since I thought I did everything (Im also one of the only people who do all the closing list). I texted her and she said something about just doing what was on the list. I said I thought I did and she was being crabby and told me I didnt wipe the syrup bottles that didnt need to be wiped. I told her this and she said some very passive aggressive things and I stopped responding and sat outside for s bit to cool off. she rushed over to the cafe asking if I was alright (I hace epilepsy and she saw in the cameras that I went outside) I told her yes but no and we sat down and I tried to explain how she was making me feel. she started arguing with me and I said I needed to leave because I didnt want to work when I was crying and not feeling well snd I didnt want to keep arguing she blocked me from opening the door and said if I  leave then Im quitting and asked if I was quitting. I said no but that I needed to leave. she kept blocking me but I finally got out and ran home. she followed me home (she knows where I live bc it’s only a few blocks) and I sat on the steps crying and kinda freaking out because Ive never done something like that. she said she was worried about me and hugged me and stuff but then kinda tried to argue more and I went inside. 

  
I obviously didnt quit but the passive aggressive and kind of manipulative behavior has still continued. I got a therapist last month because Ive just been really down. I go to work 6:30am and leave at 4pm and im just tired and don’t want to talk. Im also an introvert so taking orders all day doesnt help. I  haven’t been hanging out with friends and get angry at my husband for no reason… my therapist told me that my job is probably making me depressed and that i should leave. I had been looking for jobs but theyre hard to find in my town… 

  
I felt like they were kinda replacing me with this new lady as she gets along well with my boss but because I’m full time theres no full time jobs for her and recently she said she needs to quit for a different job that starts soon. Ive applied to jobs and have an interview tommorriw but I’m feeling guilty that I’m going to quit too… and that they might not do well without me. my boss, her husband, and the lady were talking about her leaving and they were asking if she can still work some days so I’m assuming they could hire her to replace me?? but Im feeling guilty and scared since I like her as a person but she’s s bad boss….",0,1770146265.0,BadBosses,0,0.5,False

Magiclight AI stands out as a platform specifically designed for creators who want to transform their content without advanced editing skills. Whether you're a marketer creating promotional materials or a content creator developing videos, this tool offers features that streamline the creation process. In fact, many users report completing projects in minutes that previously took hours.

We'll also provide step-by-step instructions for getting started and ultimately help you decide if this AI-powered editor is worth adding to your creative toolkit.

# What is Magiclight AI and Who Is It For?

Magiclight AI has emerged as a specialized AI-powered storytelling platform that transforms written scripts, stories, and ideas into fully animated videos. Unlike traditional video editing tools that require technical expertise, Magiclight focuses on making video creation accessible through automation and AI assistance.

# Overview of the platform

At its core, Magiclight AI serves as a comprehensive video generation system that converts text prompts into complete animated sequences featuring characters, voice narration, and dynamic backgrounds [^(1)](https://magiclight.ai/faq/). The platform stands out for its ability to create long-form videos—up to 50 minutes in length—while maintaining visual coherence throughout the entire production [^(2)](https://www.oreateai.com/blog/understanding-magiclight-ai-pricing-a-comprehensive-guide/57a53aaf2943fb05bc4c2bfa4c57d922).

What truly distinguishes Magiclight is its multi-layered approach to content creation. The system employs proprietary image and video generation models that work together to ensure consistency in characters, expressions, and scenes across the entire video [^(3)](https://videoconverter.wondershare.com/more-tips/magic-light-ai-review.html). Rather than producing disconnected clips, the platform generates smooth, multi-scene animations where characters move naturally and visuals remain consistent from beginning to end [^(2)](https://www.oreateai.com/blog/understanding-magiclight-ai-pricing-a-comprehensive-guide/57a53aaf2943fb05bc4c2bfa4c57d922).

Additionally, Magiclight offers a streamlined workflow that mimics traditional video production but accelerates it through automation. From script generation and storyboard creation to animation synthesis, the entire process happens within a unified pipeline, allowing users to move from text to fully animated videos in minutes instead of weeks.

# Target users: creators, designers, marketers

Magiclight AI caters to a diverse range of users who need to create video content without specialized editing skills. The platform particularly appeals to:

* **Content creators** – YouTubers, social media influencers, and podcasters can transform their scripts into animated clips or storytelling content to boost audience engagement [^(3)](https://videoconverter.wondershare.com/more-tips/magic-light-ai-review.html)
* **Educators** – Teachers and trainers can convert lesson plans into engaging animated explainer videos that make learning more interactive for students [^(3)](https://videoconverter.wondershare.com/more-tips/magic-light-ai-review.html)
* **Marketers** – Brands can quickly produce promotional videos, ads, and product stories that capture attention even without a dedicated creative team [^(3)](https://videoconverter.wondershare.com/more-tips/magic-light-ai-review.html)

Furthermore, the platform serves both beginners and experienced professionals. Solo creators, freelancers, and small business owners benefit from the fast content creation capabilities, while small teams can use it to accelerate their production process while maintaining visual consistency [^(1)](https://magiclight.ai/faq/).

# How it compares to other AI tools

When evaluating Magiclight against competitors like Canva, Simplified, and Synthesia [^(4)](https://www.bitrue.com/blog/how-to-use-magic-light-ai), several distinguishing factors emerge. Most notably, Magiclight AI positions itself as a complete ""storytelling engine"" rather than just another AI video tool [^(3)](https://videoconverter.wondershare.com/more-tips/magic-light-ai-review.html).

The key differentiator lies in Magiclight's focus on narrative structure and character consistency across long-form content. While some AI tools excel at generating short, disconnected clips or visual effects, Magiclight prioritizes telling cohesive stories with consistent protagonists [^(5)](https://www.cursor-ide.com/blog/magic-light-ai-complete-guide-2025).

Moreover, the platform's approach to video creation differs fundamentally from alternatives like Runway. As one comparison notes, ""While Runway might produce a more photorealistic 4-second explosion, MagicLight allows a user to tell a 10-minute story about that explosion with a consistent protagonist"" [^(5)](https://www.cursor-ide.com/blog/magic-light-ai-complete-guide-2025).

Through this storytelling-first approach, Magiclight has carved out its niche in the AI video generation landscape, serving the specific needs of creators who prioritize narrative cohesion and character development over raw visual fidelity or special effects.

# Key Features That Set Magiclight AI Apart

What separates Magiclight AI from the crowded field of AI video tools? After analyzing the platform's capabilities, five core features consistently stand out as game-changers for content creators seeking professional results without technical expertise.

# Long-form video generation

Magiclight AI breaks the typical 60-second barrier that limits most AI video tools. The platform enables users to create complete videos up to 50 minutes long—perfect for educational content, YouTube documentaries, or detailed storytelling [^(1)](https://magiclight.ai/faq/). This extended capability isn't just about length; the system maintains narrative coherence throughout the entire production.

Through its optimized engine, Magiclight handles the complexity of long-form content efficiently, allowing creators to render full-length videos much faster than traditional production methods [^(1)](https://magiclight.ai/faq/). This efficiency enables quick iteration and helps users meet demanding content schedules without sacrificing quality.

# Character and visual consistency

Perhaps the most significant technical achievement of Magiclight AI is its ability to maintain character consistency across every scene. Unlike competing AI tools where characters might change appearance between shots, Magiclight uses proprietary feature-locking technology to ensure your protagonists maintain their unique look and personality throughout the entire video [^(6)](https://magiclight.ai/).

This consistency extends beyond just characters—the system automatically adjusts lighting, perspective, and visual style to create smooth transitions between video segments [^(6)](https://magiclight.ai/). Consequently, backgrounds, environmental elements, and overall esthetic remain stable from the first scene to the last, creating a professional, cohesive viewing experience.

# Style customization and templates

Starting from scratch can be daunting, which is why Magiclight provides a library of story templates matching how people actually create content. Users can choose from templates designed for children's stories, faith messages, educational lessons, explainers, and comedy—among others [^(6)](https://magiclight.ai/). Each template provides a working structure so creators can focus on their ideas rather than format.

The platform offers multiple art styles to match different creative visions, including:

* Realistic photo-quality images
* 3D cartoon with vibrant, dimensional designs
* Pixar-inspired animation esthetic
* Disney-inspired storytelling visuals
* Illustration-style artwork [^(7)](https://magiclight.ai/tools/image-to-video/)

# Director-level editing tools

Magiclight combines scriptwriting, animation, visuals, audio, and export functions into one seamless workflow [^(8)](https://magiclight.ai/tools/ai-animation-generator/). The AI automatically dissects text into editable storyboard segments, organizing the creative flow logically [^(9)](https://magiclight.ai/tools/ai-video-editor/).

Users gain granular control over their projects with precision tools to fine-tune specific scripts and visuals frame-by-frame [^(9)](https://magiclight.ai/tools/ai-video-editor/). If a generated image doesn't match your vision, you can regenerate that specific frame or modify its description for precise art direction without affecting the rest of your project [^(9)](https://magiclight.ai/tools/ai-video-editor/).

Additionally, the platform includes built-in voiceover generation in over 30 languages with different tones and emotions. Users can add background music and subtitles within the same interface, eliminating the need for external audio editing tools.

  
👉 **Use the Magiclight AI invitation code: b2pcud29g to get started today and access the platform faster.**



# Watermark-free exports

All paid plans include full commercial usage rights with no watermarks, allowing users to monetize their content freely [^(10)](https://magiclight.ai/create/style/illustration/). This means videos can be used for YouTube channels, TikTok content, marketing campaigns, educational courses, or any other purpose without additional licensing fees [^(8)](https://magiclight.ai/tools/ai-animation-generator/).

The platform supports exports up to 1080p HD quality [^(11)](https://traksource.com/magiclight-review/), making the output suitable for professional publication across various platforms. Combined with fast generation times—creating a high-quality 5-minute story in roughly the time it takes to ""grab a coffee"" [^(9)](https://magiclight.ai/tools/ai-video-editor/)—Magiclight enables creators to produce and publish content at a pace that was previously impossible with traditional animation methods.

# Pricing Plans and What You Get

Understanding Magiclight AI's pricing structure helps determine if this tool aligns with your creative needs and budget. The platform operates on a credit-based system with several tier options, making it accessible to both casual users and serious content creators.

# Free plan: what's included

Magiclight offers a comprehensive free trial that allows you to test core features without financial commitment. This includes:

* Limited credits (approximately 300 lifetime credits according to some sources) [^(12)](https://medium.com/@pickupwp/i-tried-magiclight-ai-for-video-creation-heres-what-surprised-me-2aa7a861afd3)
* Access to the complete style library
* Full character consistency features
* Basic platform functionality [^(1)](https://magiclight.ai/faq/)

This trial provides enough resources to create 1-2 short video generations, perfect for experiencing the platform's capabilities before upgrading. Notably, no credit card is required to start [^(1)](https://magiclight.ai/faq/).

# Standard and Plus plans

For users ready to commit, Magiclight offers structured subscription options:

**Standard Plan:** Priced at approximately $8-12 monthly, this tier provides 5,000-7,000 credits per month [^(13)](https://www.saasworthy.com/product/magiclight-ai/pricing)[^(2)](https://www.oreateai.com/blog/understanding-magiclight-ai-pricing-a-comprehensive-guide/57a53aaf2943fb05bc4c2bfa4c57d922). With these resources, you can create about 10 one-click story videos [^(3)](https://videoconverter.wondershare.com/more-tips/magic-light-ai-review.html). This plan includes essential features like 1080p HD video exports, fast-track generation, and watermark-free content.

**Plus Plan:** For more intensive usage, the Plus plan costs around $16-26 monthly and delivers 15,000 credits [^(13)](https://www.saasworthy.com/product/magiclight-ai/pricing)[^(2)](https://www.oreateai.com/blog/understanding-magiclight-ai-pricing-a-comprehensive-guide/57a53aaf2943fb05bc4c2bfa4c57d922). This translates to approximately 30 one-click story videos per month [^(3)](https://videoconverter.wondershare.com/more-tips/magic-light-ai-review.html). Plus subscribers gain additional perks such as increased generation limits and priority processing.

Both plans offer substantial discounts (approximately 20%) when billed annually [^(12)](https://medium.com/@pickupwp/i-tried-magiclight-ai-for-video-creation-heres-what-surprised-me-2aa7a861afd3).

# Credit-based system explained

Magiclight operates using a credit consumption model where:

* Credits are used based on video length, complexity, and resolution [^(1)](https://magiclight.ai/faq/)
* Simpler animations require fewer credits
* Complex, high-resolution videos demand more credits [^(1)](https://magiclight.ai/faq/)
* Credits are consumed when processing begins, not upon completion [^(1)](https://magiclight.ai/faq/)

Essentially, each video generation costs a specific amount depending on its parameters. According to the credit usage pattern, a standard 720p 10-second clip costs about 5 credits, 1080p doubles to 10 credits, and 4K resolution requires 20 credits [^(5)](https://www.cursor-ide.com/blog/magic-light-ai-complete-guide-2025).

It's worth noting that credits cannot be refunded once used since server costs and computational resources are immediately consumed during processing [^(1)](https://magiclight.ai/faq/).

# Is it worth the cost?

In view of the platform's capabilities, many users find Magiclight's pricing competitive compared to alternatives. At $8-24 monthly (depending on the tier), it's positioned approximately 50% lower than similar services [^(13)](https://www.saasworthy.com/product/magiclight-ai/pricing).

A significant advantage is that all paid plans include:

* Commercial usage rights for business marketing, advertising, client projects, and monetized content [^(1)](https://magiclight.ai/faq/)
* Watermark-free exports at up to 1080p HD quality
* Full ownership of creative concepts with no additional royalties [^(1)](https://magiclight.ai/faq/)

Nevertheless, user experiences vary significantly. Several users report frustrations with credit consumption rates, noting that generating even a basic 5-minute storyline can cost 500-600 credits before video creation begins [^(14)](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/magiclight.ai). Others mention that the Pro plan, despite its higher price, barely allows for 4 videos monthly [^(14)](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/magiclight.ai).

When evaluating Magiclight AI's cost effectiveness, consider your specific content needs, frequency of video creation, and the alternative costs of traditional video production or competing AI platforms.

# Real User Reviews and Community Feedback

Beyond marketing claims, the real story of Magiclight AI emerges through actual user experiences. Reviews reveal a stark contrast between expectations and reality for many customers.

# What creators are saying

Several users report frustration with unexpected charges appearing on their accounts without warning. As one user named Lakhwinder found initial success, others like Milton Saramunda struggled with fundamental limitations—including an inability to import personal images or add voiceovers to animations.

Conversely, some creators praise the platform's character consistency features, noting it gives them an edge when creating long-form content. As one Reddit user explained: ""Magiclight's advantage is in character design and consistency... I create my own characters because I want my videos to feel like episodes in a series.""

# Common praises and complaints

Primary complaints center around:

* Credit consumption that feels misleading—one user noted creating a basic 5-minute storyline costs 500-600 credits before video creation begins
* Character inconsistencies where appearance, clothing, and features change between scenes
* Technical issues including deformed hands (often with 7-8 fingers)
* Customer support described as ""non-existent"" by multiple reviewers

Praise primarily focuses on speed, with one user calling it ""fast, good enough, and insanely useful for a solo creator.""

# YouTube tutorials and walkthroughs

The official Magiclight AI YouTube channel offers basic tutorials covering initial setup and key features. These guides provide straightforward instructions for beginners but lack advanced troubleshooting information that many frustrated users seek.

# Conclusion

Magiclight AI presents an intriguing option for creators seeking to transform text into animated videos without technical expertise. This platform stands out primarily through its character consistency across long-form content and its simplified workflow that condenses traditional video production into minutes rather than weeks.

Despite these strengths, potential users should carefully consider several factors before committing. The credit consumption system appears to be a significant pain point for many users, with even basic projects quickly depleting available credits. Additionally, technical issues like inconsistent character rendering and deformed hands remain problematic according to user feedback.

The pricing structure offers reasonable entry points for different usage levels, though actual value depends heavily on your specific content needs. Casual creators might find the free trial sufficient for experimentation, while serious content producers should calculate expected usage against monthly credit allocations.

Users who prioritize storytelling over photorealistic effects will likely appreciate Magiclight's approach most. The platform essentially trades perfect visual fidelity for narrative coherence—a worthwhile compromise for creators focused on character-driven content.

As with any AI tool, expectations must align with current technological limitations. Magiclight delivers impressive automation for storytelling but still requires thoughtful input and occasional troubleshooting from users. Those willing to work within these constraints may find Magiclight AI transforms their creative process, turning hours of technical work into minutes of strategic direction.",1,1770146265.0,BestCouponDeal,0,1.0,False

1qv1arf,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1qv1arf/range_day_pt_22/,Range day Pt 2-2,"Rachel disappeared inside her hab to finish dressing and grab her backpack. Liz stayed outside, thermos in hand, leaning against the camo 450cc while she pulled out her D-pad. Thumbs moved quickly across the screen.

Liz to Lily & Torres: Meet us at my house ASAP. Got surprises. Bring nothing but good moods.

She hit send, pocketed the pad, and waited. A minute later Rachel emerged—utilities on, backpack slung, hair tied back, eyes bright with anticipation.

“Ready?” Liz asked, patting the seat behind her.

Rachel nodded, climbing on. Liz ran her through the basics: throttle gentle at first, brakes progressive, lean with the turns, no sudden stops on loose sand. “We’ll go slow till you feel it. Circles out front first.”

Rachel took the controls for a few cautious loops in the open space in front of her hab—slow, wobbly at first, then smoother. Liz watched, nodding approval. “Good. You’ve got it.”

Liz swung onto her own ATV, engine rumbling to life. “Follow me. Stay close.”

They headed out together, the two machines kicking up light dust as they cruised the quiet streets toward Liz’s place. By the time they pulled up, Lily Bauer and Corporal Elizabeth Torres were already there—leaning against their own rides, arms crossed, grinning like kids on Christmas morning.

Liz and Rachel killed engines and dismounted.

Lily raised an eyebrow at the pair. “You two look like you’ve been up to something.”

“Coffee first,” Liz said. “We’ll explain inside.”

The four women filed into Liz’s hab. Minutes later they came back out—each with a steaming mug, Liz carrying an extra large pack slung over one shoulder and a folded tarp under her arm.

“Follow us,” Liz told Lily and Torres. “Short walk.”

Rachel and Liz remounted their ATVs; Lily and Torres fell in behind on foot. The group reached the warehouse/shed in under two minutes. Liz spun the dial lock—22-23-24—doors swung open.

Inside: the three new ATVs, trailers attached, crates waiting.

Lily’s eyes went wide. Torres let out a low whistle.

“Have you operated ATVs before?” Liz asked.

Both women shook their heads yes, already moving toward the machines.

Lily eyed the trailers. “What about these?”

Liz grinned. “My dad sent my toys. It’s range day. We’ll take them with.”

She turned to Lily. “The combination is 22-23-24. You need to send that to the SM—he’s got a ‘pointing’ box inside from my father. General Tornel’s gift.”

Lily pulled out her D-pad, typed the combo, snapped a quick pic of the marked crate, and hit send.

Ping.

SM Sgt B: Message received. Location, combination, pic attached. Box marked “From General Tornel – Retrieve today.”

Lily: Roger. On it.

Liz looked at Rachel. “Dad sent a bottle of wine and us a box of cigars.”

Lily and Torres burst out laughing.

Torres wiped her eyes. “Rachel, ladies—we’re wasting daylight. Let’s go.”

In no time the four ATVs were out, trailers hitched, engines humming. They rolled down the road, Liz pulling onto the beach track and pointing ahead to where they’d spotted the lavender field earlier.

“Rach, you lead,” Liz called over the wind. “Go slow. Get used to her.”

Rachel took point, easing the throttle. The group settled into a comfortable pace, the ocean breeze cool, the sand firm under the tires. Rachel gradually picked up speed—confident now, leaning into turns, grinning under her helmet. The others followed, laughing when she hit a small dip and whooped.

Then Rachel braked hard, waving everyone forward urgently.

Liz pulled up beside her. Baby sea turtles—dozens of them—were emerging from the sand, tiny flippers churning toward the water. The women dismounted, phones out, snapping pictures: hatchlings scrambling free, the four of them gently scooping the stragglers and carrying them to the surf

Hours slipped by in quiet wonder. Just as they were about to leave, another wave of turtles broke through the sand.

Lily glanced at the sun high overhead. “Can we make a sun shelter? Tarp and ATVs?”

They maneuvered the machines into a rough square, stretched the tarp overhead into a makeshift screen. Shade settled. The women sat in the sand, watching the last of the hatchlings make their frantic dash to the sea, still in awe.

Rachel reached into her backpack, pulled out a small speaker.

Liz blinked. “I thought that was broken.”

Rachel shrugged. “I just pulled the battery out.”

Lili: “Why?”

Torres leaned in. “What’s the story?”

Rachel pointed at Liz. “She set the alarm full blast—playing Queen, old Earth music.”

Torres and Lily: “You have Queen?”

Rachel nodded. “It’s part of the library Wyatt bought.”

Liz’s expression shifted. “Did he know?”

Rachel’s voice softened. “Yes. He bought it one day while we were having lunch on the Nori Navio. He said as a boy he and his friends listened to it. I asked their names and he said Westo, Wontom…and then he well he just stopped talking.”

Rachel’s gaze drifted, remembering that day on the ship. The casual conversation that had turned cold. The sudden anger flashing in Wyatt’s eyes—deep, old, raw.

Something twisted inside her. She stood abruptly, walked a few paces away down the beach.

Liz followed without a word.

Lili looked at Torres. “Let’s wait here.”

Liz caught up. Rachel’s cheeks were wet; she wiped them quickly, but the tears kept coming. Liz pulled her into a tight hug.

Rachel’s voice cracked. “Liz, we were just talking…and when I mentioned his friends, the look on his face was terrifying. Something hurt him bad. Deep inside.”

Liz held her closer. “I’ve seen things up there—” she pointed into the sky “—men who showed fear. Wyatt had no fear. It was pure hate.”

Rachel swallowed. “I heard someone say once, when he was fighting the Drazzan…after he destroyed an entire ship. They said he laughed.”

Liz’s mind flashed to that day: Wyatt’s face after the kill, the predator’s smile, cold and satisfied. She remembered her own team’s arrival after they’d taken out twelve Drazzan twenty klicks away. Wyatt’s casual “You’re late.” She’d wanted to snap back: Yeah, we just killed twelve. Where were you?

Instead she’d stayed quiet.

Liz spoke low. “Rach, I’ve seen Wyatt laugh once—when he killed the Drazzan. Maybe something happened with him when he was a boy.”

Rachel nodded, wiping her face. “Yeah. It just…upset me. I’ve never had violence in my life.”

Well you know what I think of him .

Liz squeezed her shoulder. “Let’s go back. Get something to drink. Maybe a cigar.”

They walked back to the group. Lily gave Liz a silent you okay? look. Liz nodded once—it’s handled.

Rachel forced a small smile. “I think it’s time to open that wine and listen to some music.”

Liz pulled four cigars from the pack. Everyone laughed—the tension breaking like a wave.

They kicked back under the tarp for a few hours: wine passed around, Queen playing low through the speaker, stories swapped, the turtles’ journey complete.

Eventually Liz checked the horizon. “Torres, you think we can make the lavender field?”

Torres squinted. “About five clicks—maybe five-point-five at most.”

Lily grinned. “On this beach? Fifteen, twenty minutes easy.”

Liz stood, brushing sand off. “Ladies—saddle up.”

She paused, smirked. “Wish I was sitting on a real saddle now. Been a while.”

Laughter rippled through the group. Heads shook, eyes rolling good-naturedly. Heads shaking

Liz kept going. “I know some guys in the capital. I can hook you up again.”

More laughter.

Lili raised her mug in mock toast. “Everyone up for a road trip?” Looking at Liz she winks .

The four women mounted up, engines rumbling back to life.

The beach stretched ahead—lavender waiting, sun high, day still young.

“Newtown going be loudtown when Liz is done “ had given them a perfect morning. Now they were going to make it unforgettable.

The four women mounted up, engines rumbling back to life under the high sun. Tires bit into the sand as Rachel took the lead again, throttle steady, the group falling into a loose formation down the beach. The ocean breeze whipped past, carrying salt and the faint, sweet hint of lavender on the wind. Twenty minutes later, they veered inland slightly, pulling into a vast field of blooming lavender—purple waves stretching toward the horizon, buzzing with lazy insects and the quiet hum of nature.

Liz killed her engine first, scanning the sky. A shadow flickered overhead—a small drone, circling low. She grinned, raising one arm high. “Everyone—wave!”

The others followed suit, hands up, laughing as the drone dipped its nose in a mechanical “wave” back—probably the SM’s eyes in the sky, keeping tabs.

Lilli lowered her hand, still chuckling. “Liz, let’s get what you came for and see those toys. This hill’s a good backstop. Sound good?”

Rachel glanced over, a knowing smile tugging at her lips. She could sense the shift—fun stuff was about to happen. The kind that involved more boom than bloom.

Ten minutes later, they were back on the beach, ATVs parked in a semicircle.

Lilli pulled out her D-pad, thumbs flying.pic sent

Lilli: Elizabeth, Dad sent some of her toys.

A pause, then the reply pinged.

SM: OMG she has a 40mm launcher? And a SAW? Toys? Who is this girl? This is going to be fun. Will do full report in person.

Lilli smirked, pocketing the pad. Moments later—

Ping.

SM: I have eyes on you. Wave.

Lilli looked up—the drone was back, hovering. “Everyone—wave! It’ll be on video.”

They did, arms high. Rachel called out, “I want a copy!”

Lilli nodded. “Liz, I’ll be safety officer.”

Everyone grabbed ear protection from the packs—foam plugs twisted in, muffs adjusted.

Liz looked at Lilli, thumbs up. “Hot range.”

She shouldered the 40mm launcher, aimed at a weathered stump about 200 meters down the beach. Boom. The round arced, detonated—the stump exploded in a spray of splinters and sand.

“Again! Again!” Torres whooped.

Liz reloaded, fired—another hit, another burst of debris.

She turned to Rachel. “Rach, get over here.”

Rachel hesitated, eyes wide. “Uh…I don’t know about this.”

Liz waved her over. “Suck it up. Give it a try.”

Rachel stepped up, Liz guiding her stance. Boom—miss by 30 meters, sand geysering harmlessly.

“Again,” Liz said, adjusting her aim point. “Like this—lead a bit.”

Boom—10 meters left. Boom—dead on target, wood shattering.

Torres was next. “What’s left is in pieces. I’ll aim for the one on the left.”

Boom—hit. Again—hit.

Liz grinned at Lilli. “Get your arse over here.”

Lilli saluted mockingly. “Yes, Sergeant Major!”

Everyone laughed as Lilli took the launcher. “Rock at about 220m.”

Boom—hit. Again—hit. She pointed farther. “Log at 350m.”

Lilli adjusted elevation, fired—boom, direct hit.

Liz clapped. “Who’s ready for real fun?”

Lilli’s eyes lit up. “I’m up first. Let’s see this beast.”

They set up the SAW—Squad Automatic Weapon, belt-fed and hungry. Liz handed it over. “Why does the target have ‘Tommy’ on it?”

Liz shrugged. “He cheated on me.”

The four women dissolved into hysterical laughter, clutching sides.

Lilli wiped her eyes. “Torres and I used this model at our range.”

Liz nodded. “Have fun. I’ve got 2000 rounds on belts. Everyone gets a can.”

Lilli checked the extra barrel. “You have a spare?”

“Sure do.”

“Range hot.”

The SAW chattered to life—target gone in seconds, sand flying, the belt chewing through ammo. The barrel glowed red-hot, but held.

Lilli paused. “Hand me the glove, will you, Torres?”

Barrel swapped out—hot one dropped carefully, new one locked in. Bolt checked. Chamber empty.

“Torres, get ready while we set up new targets,” Lilli said.

Torres scribbled on the next one: “Wesley.”

More laughter.

“Range hot.”

Torres let it rip—just like Lilli, shredding the target.

Rachel next. Liz asked, “Why you want on the target?”

Rachel smiled, walked over, whispered low.

Moments later: a Drazzan silhouette on the target, not far out. Lilli walked over, speaking low with Rachel, pointing. “Let it bounce—just light pulls. Take your time.”

Rachel smiled back. Liz winked.

She squeezed the trigger—a burst of 19 rounds thundered out. Then again. And again. Until the target was confetti.

Everyone cheered. “Liz—you up.”

Liz looked at Rachel, pulled out a special target. “Put it out there. Trust me.”

Rachel set it up: a white deer with a man in black armor standing next to it, no more than 50 yards away.

Liz pulled the trigger—dumped the entire belt. The target vanished in dust and fury…but when it cleared, a rock behind was obliterated. The target stood untouched.

Clapping erupted. “How?!”

High above, the drone zoomed in. The SM watched, eyes narrowing at the target. He knew now: Liz wasn’t sent by her father to Newtown for protection. It was to protect Wyatt—and Newtown itself.

Some three hours later, the ladies lounged in Elizabeth’s garden—bourbon in glasses, cigars puffing lazily, the afternoon sun warm and forgiving.

The SM strolled out in regular clothes—jeans, button-down—waving off salutes. “At ease.”

He walked up to Liz, hand on her shoulder. “What’s your rank, young lady?”

Liz smiled. “None, SM.”

He shook his head. “As of now, you have one. Though I’m not sure what to call it.”

Lilli piped up. “Appropriations officer?”

Liz stood up saying I’ll be right back

1qv17j0,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qv17j0/the_painting/,The Painting,"The cold breeze prickled his skin. His eyes, which had been blurry suddenly snapped clear as he broke the lock on the front door. The rusted hinges screamed, echoing into the house. The floorboards did little to hide his presence.  He held a flashlight in front of him, the only aid to his vision save for the full moon shining through the large arched windows. A floorboard groaned under his weight and he froze, his breath loud in his ears. The house groaned unlike a noise most houses made, even for an old one. He felt the distant laughter of his gang outside, disbelief he allowed himself into the old house at the top of the street. It had been abandoned for years, yellow police tape strung across the front gate.  The windows were all cracked—rocks flung by him and his gang just nights before. The only surviving resident was committed shortly after her husband had tripped down the stairs and cracked his neck. The last known owner had vanished without a peep and the villa was condemned a crime scene.

A sudden gust swept through the house and the front door slammed. Footsteps thudded the oak floorboards behind him and he twisted his body around, the flashlight whipping to an empty hallway. Just the wind, he thought.  He passed a painting at the end of the hallway. A man and his family were having a picnic at the beach. The painting burst with bright colours. The man wore a full suit, his bow tie slightly askew. The woman wore a full body frock, wool by the looks, with stockings and shoes. Their two children, twins, wore flannel breeches. 

The kitchen had been ransacked. Cupboard doors hung off their hinges, their expired contents spilling out on to the linoleum. The tap was dripping, a repetitive rhythm drilling into his head. *Drip, drip, drip.*  A crash behind him and his grip tightened on his torch, knuckles turning pale. His back bristled as he crept to the noise, his blood flushing him with relentless cold. The portrait had fallen to the ground. He let the flashlight focus on the painting of the mother and her children.

The man in the bowtie was missing. 

His mouth dropped open and he tried to turn, his body rigid and locked in place. Sweat was drenching his back. He willed his body into motion, desperation fuelling his retreat. He felt as though running through mud and his vision was blurring. He lunged for the door but his sweaty hand slipped on the door handle. He was unable to make it turn.  A scratch of claws pierced the buzzing of his heartbeat in his ears and he turned to see a string of deep gouges spreading from floor to ceiling.

A small light flickered on in the room down the hall, the soft analog voice of an ancient record player whirred to life. Shaking, he stalked closer to the door. Inside was an old writing desk. A half finished manuscript sat open on the desk, words printing themselves on the page as he approached.  He stood, the house around him grew quiet, only the sound of his own blood pumping filling his ears. He read the new words leaving their marks on parchment



*The young boy entered the study, pausing if just for a moment. The night was*

*Deadly quiet, save for ‘Home on the Range’ playing on the table. His head turned*

*The last thing he noticed before his death, was a mug still steaming on the*

*desk. The boy was not alone…*



He lowered the parchment to the table, the colour had drained from his face. He stepped backwards away from the steaming cup of hot coffee that was perched on the desk. The music cut, the lights plunging him into complete darkness.  Footsteps. A low, guttural growl. He flicked his torch back on and pointed it at the noise.  Beyond the light shrouded by shadows, stood a tall lanky figure. It took a step forward. The light from the torch flickered.

 The last thing he saw before the light went out was a razor sharp smile and a crooked bow tie.

The guide provides assistance to all visitors planning to explore Virajpet.

The distance from Bangalore to Virajpet is around 280 km, taking approximately 6 to 6.5 hours. The best route is Bangalore → Mysore → Hunsur → Gonikoppal → Virajpet. The Bangalore–Mysore highway offers smooth driving, and Mysore is the fastest midpoint to reach Coorg.

We departed from Bangalore at 6:30 AM and had breakfast in Mysore at 9:00 AM before arriving at our resort near Virajpet at 1:00 PM. Mysore has excellent South Indian restaurants, making it a great breakfast stop. Road conditions begin to shift toward hilly and winding paths after the Hunsur area. The distance between Mysore and Virajpet measures approximately 95–100 kilometers, which takes about 2.5 hours to travel.

Travelers coming from Bangalore Airport typically spend the night in Mysore before moving on to their next destination the following day. Another route is from Mangalore → Sullia → Virajpet, covering about 150 km in 3.5 to 4 hours. The scenic route provides breathtaking views of coastal areas and forested land and coffee plantations, but it contains sharp turns which require people who experience motion sickness to take medication before traveling.

General travel tips:

Start early to avoid Bengaluru traffic.

Add 30–45 minutes to Google Maps estimates due to slow hill driving.

Hire a driver if uncomfortable with hill roads.

Follow resort directions as Google Maps may show incorrect routes.

The distance from Virajpet town to plantation resorts typically falls between 5 and 15 kilometers. The narrowness of estate roads requires drivers to operate their vehicles at reduced speeds. The resort we stayed at had a distance of 10 kilometers to the town center. The last 3 kilometers consisted of a narrow estate road that resort staff members guided us through.

""My dearest mother, I write these words to you with a strange chill; not the chill of the air, but the chill of this place. Yesterday, we entered the first village in the 'White Zone'... The houses were still standing, and the coffee was still warm in some cups, but there were no people, not even corpses!



What terrifies me, Mother, is that the map I have says this village 'doesn't exist.' When I asked the commander, he looked at me with cold eyes and said, 'Don't believe your eyes, soldier, believe only the paper in your hand.'



Mother... did you receive my previous letters? Is my mother truly alright? I feel a voice calling to me from behind the white walls, but the commanders say it's just the echo of the fog. Pray for me, Mother, for certainty here melts away like snow.""



""\[Family Letter: Reply to Letter No. 2\]



""My dear son, your letter arrived and gladdened me. Don't let superstitions and doubts trouble you; the commanders know better than you what is best for you."" Life here in the capital is stable and beautiful, and everyone is proud of your heroism in the liberated areas.

""My dearest mother, we are now on our way to the capital of the Nushka region. We are passing through villages, most of them deserted, except for one we saw in the distance through the thick fog. When the commander saw it, he gave us a strange look, as if in astonishment and surprise!



When the soldiers tried to advance, the commander ordered us to stop immediately some distance from the city. Then they held an emergency meeting in a closed room. No one knows what was discussed in the meeting, and now we wait in fear and silence, amidst the fog... What will happen?""



\[Family Letter No. 4: From the Nushah Front - To Mother\]



""Mother, we've just received orders to advance on the village. They told us, 'Prepare your weapons and be ready for any danger.'"" We were surprised, but we didn't say a word. We continued on our way, and as we drew closer, the fog gradually lifted until a beautiful, warm town appeared amidst the thick mist!



The soldiers were overjoyed and began greeting the villagers with smiles, but this wasn't what the commanders had planned. They started asking to speak with the mayor, so the commanders went to him. The mayor welcomed us and offered the soldiers food, drink, and shelter—the most beautiful shelter I've ever seen! We don't know what transpired between the commanders and the mayor, but we're all well now, Mother.



Mother, is Ami alright? Has she eaten? Are you all well? I miss you all so much.



\[Family Letter No. 5: From the Nushah Front - To My Mother\]



""My dearest Mother, everything is fine, Mother. I truly love this place. The mayor addressed us, saying, 'You are our soldiers and the wings of our freedom,' and so on. The speech was long, but I lost track of time. In the end, he told us he would build us a magnificent housing complex! This made us so happy.



Except for the commander... he was looking at us with a strange look, one I had never seen before; not a cold look, but a look of... sorrow! Then I saw something that terrified me: a tear in the commander's eye.



This filled my heart with dread because I knew him. He was a great commander, who always comforted us in our sorrows. How could he be crying now? That's when I realized something terrible and dangerous had happened. I don't know what it is, but my comrades and I agreed to storm the command post and the mayor's office to find out the truth.

She and Cody grew up in a neglectful, crystals-and-chakras sort of household in South Dakota. And in 1993 they were both lured into the spectacles of On High Ministry.

Of course they’d heard the rumors. *Healing and wonders! Transformation!* 

They hitchhiked to Valentine, Nebraska. Amber explained how all the noise and excitement inside the Big Tent was overwhelming—too much, too fast, for a fifteen-year-old. But she remembered the last night clearly. At the peak of the crowd’s raving, her brother was called to stand on the center stage.

“Big Huck laid hands on Cody,” Amber said. “Then I watched all five of Cody’s fingers grow back. He might’ve been crying with joy, or from pain—I couldn’t hear his voice over the crowds. There was a golden light from above… I… I watched him float.”

She never saw her brother again.

That was her story, or at least, as specific as Amber would get. On High Ministry moved out west, not a week after the Big Tent had concluded. Amber spent one more year in high school before dropping out, setting out on a warpath to uncover what happened to Cody—living rough, bouncing from place to place, person to person.

“If I break big and make a million dollars,” Amber said in conclusion, “that would just make payback all the juicier. Interviews, a book deal. Bringing down cults… now that’d be one hell of a career.”

My coffee was cold by the time I finished it off—tasted like old pennies anyway. “Do you really believe we can take Big Huck down?”

“I do,” she said. “He’s not some god. Greg Tindall proved that, to an extent.”

“I’m not going to prison for murder, Amber,” I scoffed.

She shook her head. “We just keep digging. Find out what happened to my brother—and the other fifteen who disappeared in Valentine. Then bring our evidence to the FBI. Or the state attorney. Take it to somebody who’ll throw that bloated rat in jail. Better yet, an electric chair—they do that in Idaho, right?”

After we drained what was left in the coffee pot, Amber packed up her equipment and drove us to the town library. What I really wanted was to check on my apartment and grab a few things, but Amber convinced me to wait until her online journal was updated. We shuffled into the library and settled at the computers in the back. Amber unpacked her laptop and a knot of cords, eventually dialing up an internet connection.

[*www.Truthhunterjournalz.bigdeal.web*](http://www.Truthhunterjournalz.bigdeal.web)

The site slowly loaded onto the screen. Columns of text and pictures scrolled along a tile-textured background. Amber attempted to explain HTML coding to me and how there was a good chance Y2K might wipe out civilization, and I gave a half-hearted attempt at listening. By the end of the second hour, I was slouched in my chair and staring out the window—a cloudy sky, trees lining the sidewalk, a woman walking her Labrador. 

“Ready?” Amber said, suddenly standing beside me. 

“You did the thing?” I asked.

“Yes, Red—*I did the thing*. I always email a hyperlink to all the sites I can think of—*The Drudge Report, Wired News,* etc. No one’s ever replied but what’s important is that it’s out there—in case, you know, the worst happens.”

We drove to the other side of town and parked a block down from my apartment. Now it became my turn to convince Amber to tag along. My reasoning was that On High Ministry wouldn’t waste time stalking one guy day and night. Of course that logic collapsed the moment we reached the front steps.

A note was taped to my door.

*Wednesday, 6:30 PM. Don’t forget to be there, my treat.*

It was like a slap across the face. They knew where I lived and weren’t shy about letting me know they did. We hurried inside.

“Shit,” Amber said, running a hand through her hair. “I knew they’d be tracking you.”

“I didn’t see any headlights following us last night.”

“Me neither. Gah. *Shit*.”

I retraced my steps since yesterday morning. Found Connie dead. Then I found the envelope. Drove to Coeur d’Alene. Got my ass kicked. Drove back from Coeur d’Alene and saw Leo turn off well before Ponderay. Then I… My heart sank. I was moronic enough to deliver Connie’s letter in its envelope, the return address written in the top left corner. All that was missing was a goddamn stamp.

I wouldn’t tell Amber. That’s just asking for one more headache. There was also a twisted satisfaction in letting her flounder in the dark, for a change.

Besides the note, everything in my apartment looked like it always had—empty and unimpressive. I fetched my duffel bag from my room and returned to find Amber in the kitchen and lighting a cigarette.

“Amber. You can’t just smoke inside the house,” I said.

“I thought your landlord died.”

“She did.”

“Well, then who cares,” Amber said. “Okay. Plan time. Should we trust going back to the motel? Or did they follow us there as well?”

I knew it’d be fine, but we still talked it over and I found reasons why the motel wasn’t a risk. Immediately Amber could tell something was up—but she didn’t call me out on it, thankfully, and we headed out of town. 

 

Amber and I hunkered down in the motel room like fugitives, nothing to do until tomorrow. We’d fall into conversation at times, only to fall out of it again. Often we sat in silence, alone with our own thoughts. I’ll admit, occasionally my eyes strayed to Amber—her sandy blonde hair, her eyes, the citrus-colored flowers that trailed the side of her neck and under her shirt. I tried to understand the game we were playing with each other. Whatever it was, I didn’t feel like I had the upper hand. 

At some point Amber asked if I wanted to fill time watching the TV. I said no. Then later in the evening Amber asked me if I wanted a chicken quesadilla. I said yes.

“Then you’d better get started,” she replied. “The stuff is in the fridge.”

We snacked and afterwards Amber dug out two pills of Xanax, dropping one into my hand. Soon we were sprawled on the bed, finally enjoying the quiet confines of our cheap motel room. I watched the ceiling fan—its plastic blades spinning above me.

When I opened my eyes again, it was morning. There didn’t seem a point in waiting around for 6:30—we piled into her car and were soon winding through the pine-covered hills on the outskirts of Coeur d’Alene. Amber took back roads I didn’t recognize, then parked a good distance from the On High Ministry compound, her Xterra tucked beside a broken-down rig on a dirt lot. Amber wanted to do a bit of preemptive scouting.      

“How long have you been doing this?” I asked, unbuckling my seat belt.

Amber gave it some thought. “Over a month by now. Saved up money working at a grow house in Wyoming to stay over here. Almost out of cash now. Good thing I’ve got you—you do have a checking account, right Red?”

“I have around seven hundred dollars to my name.”

“*Cha-ching.* Then we’re set.”

“You sure like making assumptions,” I replied.

She shut the car door behind her. “Don’t sweat it. I’ll pay you back—once I sign a book deal with *The New York Times*.”

I followed Amber in an absurd zigzagging hike through the woods until we stood within sight of the compound and its industrial warehouse—huge, isolated and nearly barren. She recorded it on her camcorder for a brief minute.

Amber pointed to a far section of the chain-link fence, where I could see a tall stack of pallets and a few drum barrels abandoned outside the property line. “There’s a loose bit, just enough give to wiggle under.”

“When did you find that out?” I scoffed.

“I don’t exactly remember. Only tried it once—almost got caught, too. Thank God the compound doesn’t have any dogs. I wasn’t able to record anything of much interest anyway. Just a caravan of trucks and trailers. My guess is that there’s at least half a hundred people who operate here—office people, crew people, and security—who you are well acquainted with. They’re all a pack of scummy, meth-huffing clowns. I’m surprised they know how to film a TV show at all.”

I peered here and there, bobbing my head. “Where do the Hughes's live?”

“Hard to say,” Amber went on. “I really don’t think they live on the compound at all. Too good for it. Or maybe, they’re playing it safe—you know, after Gregory Tindall. Once I tried following Mrs. Hughes driving her Escalade. I followed her for miles along the country roads. Passed by gated communities and lake houses and whatnot. Then I lost her…”

Amber let out a long and unpleasant sigh.

“Came around a wide bend and there she was. Her Escalade idled in the dead middle of the road, faced backwards and waiting for me. I nearly fainted from the surprise. I don’t think she saw my face though—thank God. But I swung around and sped straight back into Coeur d’Alene. I never bothered to try it again.”

“Amber,” I said, “aren’t you afraid of getting killed?”  

“Killed? Like how they killed Cody?” she replied.

“You don’t know that for sure.”

“He never floated down again. *I know* that.”

We were silent for a while after that, watching the men who casually patrolled the compound. There weren’t many of them. The ones we did see drove side-by-sides, often stopping to chat with one another or take a leak on the asphalt.

“All right,” I said. “We’ve seen the place. We have an idea of what we’re up against. What is it that you’re set on doing once we get inside?”

“Glad you finally asked. We’ll get comfortable in our seats—choose an easy spot to slip out of, if we can. When the studio goes live and the lights go out, I’ll sneak off in the dark and get a proper recording of the place from inside.”

“People will be watching.”

“And I’ll be ‘looking for a bathroom’, if they stop me. Then, once I’ve gotten all I need, I’ll find you again like nothing ever happened.”

“I don’t like this plan, Amber.”

Amber pulled out a roll of black electrical tape, tore off a strip with her teeth, and pressed it over the camcorder’s recording light. She tested it for a second—no visible red.

“Me neither,” she said. “Let’s hope they won’t feel like searching me for anything. That’d be awkward with this on me. If things go to absolute shit, that loose part of the fence is where we run. I doubt the main gate will be safer after we get in.” 

I looked Amber over with more than a smidge of skepticism. She couldn’t have been taller than five-foot-six or weighed more than a hundred and thirty pounds. Leo could kill her with a single kick. If she really planned to snoop around in the dark, like she described, her small frame might’ve been the only thing working in her favor. I could imagine a dozen different ways this could go wrong.

— — —

The sky had turned overcast, and small drops of rain spattered the asphalt as we crossed through the compound gate with all the other arrivals. Amber slipped her arm around mine and pulled herself close. She smiled up at me.

“We’re boyfriend and girlfriend, remember?” she said. “We can do some necking in the back seat to prove it.”

“Aren’t you hilarious.”

Cars were rolling in and parking. Others with passes strolled toward the wide, overhead door of the warehouse with ecstatic faces. We soon merged into their numbers. There were ten or so men guarding the entry, checking each slip of paper. My heart was beating fast, even with all her normal bravado Amber was squeezing onto me. 

The guards didn’t ask any questions. Thankfully they only bothered to pat me down for weapons, leaving a harmless-looking girl like Amber be. Amber grudgingly deposited her backpack with the growing pile of personal items on a table. 

I handed over my pass and they ushered Amber and me inside. 

I had hoped we’d feel some relief after passing through. Instead, entering that building was more dreadful than Leo or Smiley or even Julee Hughes could ever be. It felt as if we were being swallowed alive. Perhaps the first quarter of the warehouse had been renovated into a studio set. Five sets of bleachers were arranged in a half-circle around the stage. Industrial fluorescent lights beat down on us from layer upon layer of steel scaffolding. Unpleasant crew members stood on alert at various points around the studio set. Near the back wall stood a raised, slipshod platform, where the film crew would record from the other side of the studio. For a program so official and grandiose, the reality outside what the television showed was stark and skeletal. 

The stage itself looked exactly as it did on my TV: thick golden curtains, sweeping banners, a band of musicians tuning their instruments, and Big Huck’s podium front and center. 

As we walked, I glanced at Amber beside me, and from the way she carried herself I could tell she still had her camcorder on her, still filming. Somehow, what we were doing felt deeply wrong, like committing a heinous act. With every step I feared what my leg would do. 

I didn’t like this plan at all. 

Amber nudged me toward a lower seat on the bleachers, one that would be easy to slip in and out of. We sat and waited, both of us pretending we weren’t terrified to be there. Around us, the two hundred or so audience members gathered, chattering—jovial, excited—true followers of the Light On High. 

At exactly 7:00 PM, the lights went dark. The warehouse fell into dead silence, broken only by a few thrilled gasps. A beam of golden light descended like a mist over the stage. One minute passed. Then two. The tension swelled in the audience.  

Big Huck walked out onto the stage. 

And he was *massive*. His hands were meaty, his chest was wide and his stomach hung out from his midriff like a barrel. His head sat like a boulder on his shoulders. I sat in disbelief as Big Huck stood before us all like a pearlescent giant.

  

I turned to Amber—her hands trembled and her eyes were glossed over with tears. Horrified at the sight of Big Huck. I gave her a gentle elbow. This was the plan, right? We had to uncover what secrets were in the underbelly of On High Ministry. Amber didn’t budge. 

The silence was blown away at the hum of an organ. The musicians further back on the stage and outside the light played their music, a wiggling of silhouettes from where we watched on the bleachers. A voice shouted behind us: “*Going on 30!*”

Big Huck remained perfectly still with his eyes closed in meditation. 

“15… 10… and 5!”

The golden light rippled, ever so slightly, like a breeze passing under a silk curtain. Big Huck flashed the camera a white smile. 

“It’s an absolute delight to have you join us again,” the televangelist began. His demeanor was calm, his voice a rolling tone that somehow promised a climax to come. “Here in *On High Ministry*, we live for all the love and fervor and adoration we receive from you, children of the Light. A rare thing in this world of man’s. Mankind wears his stains and his filth and blackest iniquities like a kingly cloak. Children of the Light must shed this false willfulness, the false illusions. The Light On High desires such. The Light pierces through and finds those whose hearts are open. Yessir…”

As he spoke I felt a sensation climb over me. Warm, easing into my bones, like when you leave the frigid cold and snow at the door to sit beside a woodstove fire. My eyes began to roll upwards with pleasure. Amber’s hand clawed into my thigh. I stirred from the strange, oozing air around me and faced her.  

“Please,” Amber whispered to me, “don’t forget why we’re here.”

All I could respond was: “I feel it…”

“I know, Red.” Her face twisted with an old pain. “I know you do. But don’t let go.”

I clenched and tried to hold onto anything else. I remembered the pain that had struck my leg. I remembered the Nebraskan flyer. And Gregory Tindall. Huck Hughes shot in the chest. Connie. Valentine. The Big Tent. Cody floated in the Big Tent.   

Floated. Float… Floating…

“...Praise be!” Big Huck went on. “Ohhhh my children. My swarm of the select. The heavenly Light is so near now. Your being soaks in its perfumes of delight. Yessir. Soak it in. Feel it through you—the Light On High does not tolerate imperfection. No sir. It vomits the unworthy. But you, who open your minds, find a leviathan power waiting to transform you. Perhaps, even immortality.” 

Again the golden light falling on the stage pulsed.

More ecstasy washed over me. I felt weightless in my body. Amber’s fingers tightened on me—it hurt. That single twinge of pain, as small as it felt, was the only thing that moored me to a world still existing outside the Light. 

“This was a mistake,” Amber said, her voice slurring. “I tried so hard to forget. I made myself forget what it was like. We can’t stay here, Red.”

The Light On High was intoxicating. I knew that I’d either escape now or lose myself to it forever. People don’t come back. I recalled Valentine. Ponderay. My home. Then Amber… 

I had to get away.

I forced myself to my feet, Amber rising beside me, and we shuffled down from the bleachers. I saw Big Huck flick his eyes in our direction, just once.  

Our saving grace was that everyone else was also entranced by the Light. Even the crew didn’t seem to notice us as Amber led me on. The overhead door was closed for the recording, but there was a regular office exit to the left of it. We were twenty feet away when we recognized Julee Hughes standing there. She was wearing her white pants suit, looking as dazed as everyone else, watching her husband preach and rave on the stage while gently feeling at her lips with her fingers. A circle of sycophants watched alongside her, blocking our exit. 

We turned around and stared into the darkness beyond the golden light, further inside the warehouse. That was our only chance of escape. Keeping things at a steady walk, we moved behind the bleacher rows and staff until the warehouse opened up around us. 

“Gotta be a way out of here,” Amber whispered to me. 

Avoiding the open floor and any lingering crew members, we wove between idle machinery, racks, and abandoned equipment. After a point I don’t remember how Amber and I got separated. 

I was suddenly alone in the dark and wading through air as thick as tar. 

There were stairs. I trudged up each one, drawn higher and higher. 

Eventually I crossed high catwalks and scaffolding. It was growing very muggy and slick. Condensation dripped from the sheet metal ceiling and steel around me. Big Huck’s voice rose from below, echoing itself into a meaningless mantra.

I followed the energy that pulled me forward, metal grating scraped under my boots with each step. Just ahead was what I knew to be the Light On High. 

I stared at a huge and bulbous shape perched atop a platform. The Light was casting from its underside—a beam of pollen-like gold, cutting through darkness and spilling its light onto the studio below. With each breath I inhaled more of its sweet, overpowering musk. The thing itself sat in the many shadows of the scaffolding—shuddering, swelling and squeezing like a lung, barely visible in the reflected glow. 

Love. I felt a deep and vicious love as I drew near.

I wanted it.

I needed it.  

My boots weren’t scraping anymore.

A hand snatched the back of my belt and jerked me away. Confused and stumbling over myself, I was taken back down the many stairways. We navigated into the dim of the warehouse. A blast of cold air hit me as I was pulled through a door. Blonde hair and a denim jacket… It was Amber holding my wrist. She dragged me forward, my feet barely keeping up as we broke into a run. 

“Where are we?”

“We’re leaving,” Amber replied. “Don’t stop.”

Rain was sprinkling down on us. The farther we gained across the bare compound the more I felt myself sink back into my body. It was horrible, I could feel the cells in my flesh living and dying—I was only a mortal creature swimming in a world of even poorer and smaller mortal creatures. I felt fragile and mournfully human again. 

“Oh my God,” I rasped, my mind regaining clarity, “dear God—what was that *thing*?”

She didn’t answer.

I tracked beside Amber as we ran. It was growing dark outside but I could still make out the hundred yards or so between us and the fence line. There were the piled shapes of drum barrels and pallets. We had to halt at a travel trailer and crouched behind it, waiting for a pair of black side-by-sides to pass. Then we were running again. 

A sudden flash of headlights caught us. We didn’t have time to be surprised as a third side-by-side rolled past—then screeched to a halt and chucked it into reverse. 

All we could do was make a dead sprint for the fence line. 

Amber dropped and started crawling under the fence. I waited my turn, hands clenched onto the wire fencing. Over my shoulder I could see the side-by-side closing in behind us. Chain link clawed down my back as finally I wormed to the other side. 

A sudden *PUMPF* noise. The shotgun blast punched a hole in the side of a nearby drum barrel. *PUMPF.* *PUMPF*. 

The last thing I heard as we escaped was Smiley’s voice shouting after us. 

We ran on without stopping, cutting through pine woods and across dirt lots. My lungs felt like they’d rip apart by the time we saw the Xterra. We scrambled into the car and wheeled onto the pavement. Headlights streamed past us on the highway. 

Out of the darkness, after what felt like forever, the neon sign of ‘*Blu-ak-n*’ drifted toward us. 

Amber and I at last arrived at door number 8. We locked it behind us and stood there, numb, at a complete loss. It had been like a bad dream—cold and wet and incomprehensible—only for us to wake and find ourselves right back in the motel room.   

I watched Amber sit on the bed, bury her face into her hands and cry. ",2,1770145727.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,3,1.0,False

I don’t live here, but I’ve seen what this city has to offer when I came in here to blow stuff up a few days ago.

It has many wonders. It has your left foot. It has my right foot.

So I am putting my name in as a candidate for mayor of this fine city.

But why? Why do I want to run for Mayor of Neotropolis?

See, on most ballots, there’s always someone with a sketchy past, and I thought I’d fulfill that quota. But on this occasion, I’m not alone.

My campaign has one purpose only:

To get more votes than Colin Kintobor Jr.

You may have seen him around, helping around the city. But I can assure you, I’m more qualified than he is.

What has he done? Run a coffee shop with him as the only employee and refuse to serve a particular customer’s order? Clean up trash and yell at people who tick him off?

My employee, Flying Frog, tried to order a coffee from his coffee shop a while ago, and never got the order! He’s *still* waiting for the coffee! This was *months* ago! He clearly doesn’t keep his promises!

I manage a business with *four* employees, was the former co-leader of the SS, *and* I’m the former Queen of Moebius. You can’t get much better than a literal monarch stepping down to help run your city!

And look at his stupid needle nose and balding head! Is anyone actually seriously considering voting for that guy?

I mean, he has to be the ugliest man I have ever seen!

I know exactly who he is. He is a horrible, *horrible* barista, who refuses to comply with a single order!

Vote for me, don't vote for that guy.

1qv10vm,https://www.reddit.com/r/HENRYUK/comments/1qv10vm/how_do_i_deploy_my_redundancy_payout/,How do I deploy my redundancy payout?,"I got fired from my job in finance and I need to work out how to deploy the cash I will get from this.

Basic situation:

* 40ish, three kids, London
* I was on \~£275k base + bonus which took me to total comp of between £450-650k - lots of this locked up for years, which is now guaranteed to vest
* Wife stopped working for 2 years given kids, but she is now looking - I have high confidence she will find something earning £75-100k within 3-6 months. I would be fine/relish 3-6 months as a house husband.
* £2m house in London, owe £500k on a \~4% long-dated mortgage due for refinancing in Q42027. Already lowest LTV so refinancing is binary based on income (but binary doesn't mean good - this is a real risk). Our deal allows unlimited overpayments. Monthly payments have been £2.4k a month but we overpaid \~£100k from my bonus last year and didn't reduce the payments meaning we have been voluntarily overpaying for a year. I have now got the bank to reduce this to £2k
* 1x private school @ £30k per year. We want to put them all through it but we have some flex on when the 2nd and 3rd move into it, at least a couple of years away - no other childcare costs right now

Balance sheet:

* No debt other than the mortgage
* Runaround car owned outright + company Land Rover being handed back with redundancy, no further costs
* £60k cash
* £350k in ISAs
* £600k in my pension
* £100k in her pension
* £40k in each of the kids' ISAs
* £20k crypto
* £30k wine (illiquid, shit investment, but I mean maybe it'll come good... probably not...)
* 1 million Avios, GGL (value = 0)

Payout:

* Overall redunandancy payout including vesting stock will be \~£350k cash post tax in the next 6-9 weeks. I will be more cash-rich and liquid than I have ever been.
* Further £50-80k vesting over next 24 months

Employment prospects:

* I am confident I am highly employable but also aware (a) the right thing takes time and (b) downgrading brand is a one-time trade so panic is a bad idea and (c) it's pretty unlikely I will be able to replicate my historical earning in the short term, and I'm basically fine with that. I was overpaid by any reasonable measure.
* 10% probability I replicate my previous job in the next 3 months. If so: happy days, this turned out to be an awesome trade, getting fired was basically ""one simple trick"" to unlock my locked equity. But unlikely, because there are \~8 jobs that do what I used to do and currently someone's sitting in all of them.
* 40% probability I replicate my previous job in the next 12-18 months if that's what I really want
* 95% probability I replicate a lower tier job earning >£200k in the next 18 months (but that would be giving up on the previous options)
* 50% probability I am able to get an interim role/consultancy/favour job earning £150-200k within 1-6 months

My plan for the £350k:

* Pay down £100k of the mortage using overpayment. This will reduce our mortgage minimum payment each month to £1600
* Put £72k into our ISAs, stocks and shares, diversified global ETFs (£32k remaining this year + £40k next tax year)
* Keep £230k cash as liquidity runway - put them in accounts in my wife's name to minimise tax, although that might be a shit trade if she ends up working before I do
* Keep private school for 1x child
* Cut fatty spending (holidays, dinners, £9 pints, £5k coffees, lazy Ocado bullshit, I don't need the new iPhone, who even needs NOWTV) but not entirely shut down our lifestyle (ie kids chess club can stay)
* Re-evaluate every 3 months

Is paying down the mortgage stupid? I'm sacrificing liquidity and I've always been liquidity-obsessed/paranoid (rightly so, as it turns out, given I got fired!). But also what the hell am I going to with £350k in cash? Just have it sit there and pay tax meaning I'm earning \~2%? And I need to refinance in \~18  the mortgage months anyway so it's not locked away forever.

Or am I being too conservative? Should I bang £200k into the mortgage, get the payment right down and back myself to get another job? I mean even £150k cash feels... not bad.",0,1770145634.0,HENRYUK,34,0.42,False

When I started, I saw there were always pods sitting in the basket next to the machine and I just assumed they were communal office supplies, like the tea bags and stuff. I was pumped because free fancy coffee at work is always a win.

Fast forward to today. Im making my usual afternoon cappuccino and this girl from accounting walks in. She looks at me weird and goes ""hey random question but have you been using the Nespresso a lot lately?"" I said yeah obviously, its there for everyone right?

Her face just dropped. Turns out she brought it from home because the office coffee sucks and shes been buying her own pods this whole time. She said she noticed they were going way faster than usual but figured maybe she was just drinking more coffee than she thought. Then she saw a few other people using it recently and it all made sense.

I literally wanted to die right there. I immediately offered to venmo her and told her I have some money saved up that I can send her right now for all the pods. She tried calculating it in her head and was like ""honestly its probably a couple hundred dollars worth at this point."" Those little boxes are like $8-10 for ten pods and I've been going through maybe 2-3 a day since I started.

She was trying to be polite about it and said we can figure it out later, which somehow made it worse?? Now I cant even look at her and the next few days are gonna be so awkward.

Like three other people in the office apparently also thought it was communal and have been using it too, but I was definitely the main culprit since I was there every single day.

TL;DR thought the fancy office Nespresso was communal, turned out to be my coworkers personal machine and I basically robbed her of hundreds of dollars in coffee pods",617,1770145516.0,tifu,270,0.92,False

He would spend time with me when i asked, would sit and chat with me, this was quite fine until he started to be touchy, i mean sometimes he would just put his hand on my leg when trying to joke with me bout something, when i hug him hes holding me by my hips and i dont know if its normal or not, sometimes when we just sit near ourselves he randomly grabs my hand or put hand on my hip, i dont know if hes just clingy and im being dramatic, but i dont like this and i cant say it to him beacuse i feel like he would think that im perverted

our normal meeting looks like that, he comes, i just hug him and i make him a tea or coffee, later on we sit together and chat bout something. I sometimes even feel jealous bout him, my mom and him arent together anymore, they were like 17 years ago, and frfom what my mother says, she was with him for some years when she was 16 and he was 22, i feel like he still might be attracted to teenagers, thats why he started caring bout me when i turned 15, i think that hes also trying to get into my interest? I mean its nothing weird to have the same interest as your child/parent, but when he was just a simple person and after some chats hes tryin to look more alternative (im also alt), i mean i said to him that i would like to have an older partner thats alternative/punk, and hes trying to fit into that? I dont understand what hes trying to do

i feel like theres sexual tension between me and him, its very odd since hes my biological father, but he wasnt there when i was a child, i didnt grew up with him, so hes like a stranger to me that i meet when i was in the middle of being teenager.  
I love him so f-cking much and i dont even imagine my life without him, but i fear that we dont have a normal father-daughter(im a transman and he doesnt know that) relationship  
sometimes i have sexual thoughts bout him, and i dont like it, i cant control it, and my thoughts are getting stronger every time he poke me or touch again, even if its slight touch, i cant control my thoughts bout him, its f-cked up really, i never really even touch him the same way he touch me. I sometimes want to have s/x with him, which i never thought i would want to, and i was always against incest, i cant control myself. Maybe beacuse i never really had any attention from my mother? I always was the weird child that seems to be fine when alone, nor she did gave me hugs or kisses, and as said, my father wasnt there! So deos my brain just mistakes a parental love as the sexual one?  
My mother doesnt seem to notice, neither do she likes him, i cant really ask about this to anybody, so my thoughts are going on reddit, i really need help with that

I also recently picked up the Criterion 4K release of Fire Walk With Me and I can’t wait to dig into that and Season 3.

We became very good friends, later best friends. Would go to office together. Coffee. Meals, chats, calls. You name it. Our families also got together very well. We celebrate festivities, trips and weekend catchup. We changed companies for different reasons. It’s been 3.5 - 4 years into our friendship.

Not sure kahan ki nazar laga. But off late she has found another guy in her new office.

I feel he is taking my spot. She promises to pick him up and I get rejected even I plan to go or visit by that route once in a month. We do catchup on weekends and all will be fine then. Again when she goes to office, which she does daily, this pickup drop and rest all connects happens. I hardly get any messages back.

When I asked about it, got the response that she has already promised or has plans. What’s wrong if I get to hear a no. What’s so urgency we will meet. Millenge and things want to share pehle waha hota he.

I do spend good time with family. I am not depressed. But I feel not to give up. Not to be so much linking and thinking things.

Go nuts!

For those of you who might not be aware, every month we organise two small 'rates' where we rate a certain selection of songs by assigning them a score between 1 and 10, with one 0 and one 11. This time, we will rate the four different avenues Blackpink's stars took in their solo career.

Very few groups have had the impact and lasting appeal that Blackpink had on k-pop and music as a whole. They just are Girl Crush (for people not familiar with k-pop terms, girl crush is the term for when the video and photoshoot are themed around looking cool and fierce, while the music incorporates more hiphop elements). From their debut, they were a moment, and throughout their career, they would release so sparsely that every time they did drop, the entire scene was paying attention.

The downside of this tactic is that by the end of their seven-year contract, they had about as many songs as Twice after their first year. While they had a lot of fans, all of them were begging for more, something that Blackpink's label (YG Entertainment) did not seem to want to give them. It thus makes sense that as they spread their wings for their solo work, they wanted more freedom in how many songs they could release. Even Jisoo, who only released a mini (an EP), released more songs in 2025 than Blackpink did in every year they were active, not including 2020 and 2022. 

As such, 2024 and 2025 gave us a ton of Blackpink solo music (and one whole song by them together). And now it's time see who's slaying the solo and who should've stayed locked in the YG basement.

Please fill in the ballot and don't submit scores in any other way. I will probably accept them but your bloodline will be cursed for the rest of eternity. 
* You may give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track! You do not have to give these scores but it is fun, so I highly recommend you do!
* You must rate all songs. If you hate it, give it a 0 or a 1 but don't leave it empty!
* I reserve the right to refuse any ballots that I think are meant to sabotage certain songs or artists. Tbh I probably won't use it, since these are divisive albums but if you do something really crazy, your ballot could be rejected.
* You can leave a comment by adding a space after your score and then typing your comment there. Like this:

>drinks or coffee: 9 technically coffee is a drink but I'll forgive her cause this is a bop!

* Any other way to leave a comment is wrong! So don't do it. 
* You can similarly add a comment for any album by adding a colon after the album title and then stating your comment. Like this:

>Album: rosie: what I really wish is that we had gotten more ballads.

* Here it is important you don't leave a score. Only the songs get scores not the albums!
* If you want to change any of your scores, DM me (u/runaway3212) and they will be changed. This is possible until the deadline.
* Speaking of, the deadline is **March 8th**. If you need an extension, let me know. If you want to be reminded, you can fill in [this google form](https://forms.gle/1ugHEQ6iHrut13d98) and you will get a reminder 2 days before the deadline.
* The reveal is from **March 13th - 15th**. Times will be announced but it's gonna be a great reveal so make sure to join.

# Is there anything else?

Not really! You can join the [popheads discord](https://discord.gg/3wZVKGHu) to discuss this rate in the #rates and #rates-in progress channels. And if you're new to these albums here's a quick writeup to introduce them to you:

**Lisa - Alter Ego**

Originally the dancer of the group and the most high-energy performer, Lisa has always been a phenomenon. When she was still under YG she made Money an international hit by just giving one great performance in a [video](https://youtu.be/dNCWe_6HAM8?si=duSvc68BkKfpFzjI). It makes sense then that her debut album is full with bangers that seem designed to be part of a performance. It's full of danceable pop and fun bangers. At the same time, it sees Lisa experiment with different styles (which is also what the title implies). Rockstar is, ironically, hyperpop; Moonlit Floor (Kiss Me) is nu-disco; When I'm With You borrows Tyla for some beautiful soul. Overall, it delivered on the promise of different personas while staying true to the Lisa brand.

**Jennie - Ruby**

Jennie originally went solo while still under YG with the aptly titled [Solo](https://youtu.be/b73BI9eUkjM?si=oc2oCx6M_QY7eG0x). Out of all the girls, she definitely made an album that felt the most Blackpink, continuing their style in new ways. It's also the most star-studded cast of this entire rate (though Lisa comes close). With guest verses from Dua Lipa to Childish Gambino, the album could've easily collapsed under its variety. Instead, it delivers probably the most cohesive album of the rate. Jennie performs each song with so much personality, it's unmistakably hers. It's also an album that manages to entertain every step of the way, like she sings on Like Jennie: ""Don't bore us"". We'll also be rating One Of The Girls from The Idol, simply because it's great and Jennie's most-streamed song by a mile. 

**Rosé - rosie**

Where Lisa & Jennie stayed somewhat on the Blackpink brand, Rosé went all-in on diary pop. It makes sense; she always seemed to want to go more confessional with her music than Blackpink allowed. For topics, she is not trying to reinvent the wheel here, mostly singing about old flames, either about how much they sucked or how much she wants them back. It definitely stands out in this rate and in k-pop as a whole, for how different it sounds. It's very pretty though and definitely worth the listen.

**Jisoo - AMORTAGE**

Jisoo started her own label, just to release the same music she could've under YG with the same frequency. She probably has more control and gets more of the profits, but for her career the departure didn't mark as much of a difference as it did for the three other girls. Luckily, what she released is great. The title looks and sounds like a mortgage, and that's because she's buying a house in your brain where earthquake will live forever. We're also rating her collab with Zayn (the Jisoo of one direction when you really think about it), just cause it's doing way better than anyone could've expected.

So with the introductions out of the way, once more all the links:

you can search for common crew between shows/movies on imdb.

on this sub, there are like 80+ posts related to the west wing.  and someone posted yesterday with a pic of Chief Vick as a young dolores landingham,  so i decided to do a search....

* there are about 43 common actors / directors between psych and the west wing.
* i excluded credits for soundtrack and musicians.
* Richard Schiff is the only west wing actor who showed up only in the movies and not the tv show so i included him at the bottom.
* Dule obviously is the king with a combined 257 episodes between the two shows.
* there are only three folks that were in at least two episodes of each: Dule, Tim Matheson (20 episodes of west wing and he directed 3 episodes of psych), and andrew bernstein (he directed multiple episodes of each show).

and here's the list:

1qv0m3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_bettermetips/comments/1qv0m3n/betterme_homemade_lowcalorie_drinks/,BetterMe: Homemade Low-Calorie Drinks,"Drinks alone won’t magically make you lose weight, but choosing low-calorie, homemade options can help reduce sugar intake, control cravings, and support a calorie deficit. Replacing sugary sodas, sweet coffees, or store-bought smoothies with smarter drinks can make a real difference over time .

Here are some **homemade drink options that may support weight loss**:

# Best low-calorie drinks to consider

* **Lemon water** — Helps hydration and may replace high-calorie beverages
* **Green tea** — Contains compounds linked to metabolism support
* **Black coffee** — Low-calorie option that may support energy and appetite control
* **Ginger tea** — Almost calorie-free and may aid digestion
* **Apple cider vinegar drinks** — Often used to help manage appetite
* **Kombucha** — Fermented tea with probiotics (watch sugar content)

❔❔ Have you noticed any real benefits from green tea, coffee, or ginger tea?

1qv0l7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ModernDatingDoneRight/comments/1qv0l7b/the_psychology_of_charm_how_to_be_magnetic_in_any/,The Psychology of CHARM: how to be magnetic in any room (science-backed strategies that actually work),"i've been studying [charisma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charisma) for years now. books, podcasts, research papers, youtube rabbit holes. the whole thing started because i realized i was the person people forgot about five minutes after leaving a party. not awkward, not rude, just... forgettable. and honestly? that realization stung way more than being actively disliked would have.



here's what nobody tells you: charm isn't about being the loudest or funniest person. it's not about having perfect comebacks or looking like a movie star. most ""naturally charming"" people aren't natural at all. they've just figured out specific patterns that make others feel good. and yeah, you can learn them too.



\## the actual science behind charm



charm is about making people feel seen. not heard, not impressed. seen. psychologist [Dr. John Gottman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gottman) (the guy who can predict divorce with 94% accuracy after watching couples talk for 15 minutes) found that the single biggest predictor of relationship success is how people respond to ""bids for attention."" charming people are masters at this. when someone mentions their dog died, you don't change the subject. when they share a small win, you don't one up them. you lean in.



the spotlight effect is your enemy. research from Cornell shows we vastly overestimate how much people notice us. you think everyone's judging your awkward hand gestures? they're not. they're worried about their own. charming people understand this and use it as permission to be present instead of performing.



mirror neurons are your secret weapon. neuroscientist[ Dr. Giacomo Rizzolatti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giacomo_Rizzolatti) discovered these neurons fire both when we do something and when we watch someone else do it. this is why subtle mirroring (matching someone's energy, not mimicking like a creep) builds instant rapport. charming people do this unconsciously.



\## what actually works



ask questions that require more than yes/no answers. instead of ""did you have a good weekend?"" try ""what was the highlight of your weekend?"" sounds basic but most people don't do this. they're too busy thinking about what they'll say next.



i started practicing this everywhere. coffee shops, networking events, random conversations. the shift was instant. people lit up. conversations lasted longer. i actually remembered details about people's lives instead of immediately forgetting their names.



become comfortable with silence. here's something wild from Harvard negotiation research: the person who speaks first after a pause usually loses power in the conversation. charming people don't rush to fill dead air. they let moments breathe. it signals confidence and makes your words carry more weight when you do speak.



validate emotions before offering solutions. this one's huge. when someone vents about their terrible boss, your instinct is probably to jump into problem solving mode. don't. just say ""that sounds incredibly frustrating""[ first. Dr. Brené Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bren%C3%A9_Brown) talks about this extensively in her work on vulnerability. people don't want you to fix things, they want to feel understood.



remember and use people's names. Dale Carnegie wrote about this in ""How to Win Friends and Influence People"" back in 1936 and it's still the most underutilized charm hack. a person's name is the sweetest sound to them. use it naturally in conversation. ""that's a great point, Sarah"" hits different than just ""that's a great point.""



master the art of strategic vulnerability. sharing something slightly embarrassing or admitting you don't know something creates connection. [Brené Brown's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bren%C3%A9_Brown) research at University of Houston found that vulnerability is the birthplace of trust. but there's a balance. you're not trauma dumping on strangers. you're just being human enough that others feel safe being human back.



\## resources that actually changed things for me



[The Charisma Myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Charisma_Myth) by [Olivia Fox Cabane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Fox_Cabane). this book will make you question everything you think you know about presence. [Cabane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivia_Fox_Cabane) worked with executives at companies like Google and Deloitte, and she breaks down charisma into learnable behaviors: presence, power, and warmth. the exercises are practical, not theoretical BS.



anything by Vanessa Van Edwards, especially her YouTube channel. she runs a behavioral research lab and breaks down micro expressions, body language, vocal tone. her video on the ""charisma formula"" genuinely shifted how i show up in conversations. she's engaging without being gimmicky, backed by actual research from her Science of People lab.



The Art of Charm podcast. Jordan Harbinger interviews everyone from former FBI agents to neuroscientists about influence and social dynamics. the episode with [Chris Voss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Voss) (former FBI hostage negotiator) about tactical empathy is mind blowing. you'll learn negotiation techniques that work just as well at dinner parties as they do in high stakes business deals.



if you want a more structured way to internalize all this, there's an app called [BeFreed ](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450&ved=2ahUKEwjCl_Sf9b2SAxVIk68BHZGLIYkQFnoECBwQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2LIh8-f6J0dle9CYHnJcsU)that's been pretty useful. it's a personalized learning platform built by Columbia grads and ex-Google folks that pulls from books like The Charisma Myth, research on emotional intelligence, and expert insights on social dynamics. you set a specific goal like ""become more magnetic in conversations"" or ""master social situations as an introvert,"" and it generates a learning plan tailored to your personality and struggles.



what's nice is you can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. the voice options are surprisingly addictive too, especially the smoky, conversational style that makes learning feel less like work. it ties together a lot of the concepts from [Gottman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gottman), [Brené Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bren%C3%A9_Brown), and Carnegie into one place, which helps when you're trying to actually apply this stuff instead of just collecting information.



\## tiny shifts that compound



put your phone face down or away entirely. seems obvious but watch how many people keep checking their screens mid conversation. research from University of Essex found that just having a phone visible on the table reduces conversation quality and feelings of closeness. charming people make you feel like you're the only person in the room.



match energy levels appropriately. if someone's excited, meet their enthusiasm. if they're subdued, don't bulldoze them with intensity. this isn't being fake, it's being attuned. Daniel Goleman's work on emotional intelligence shows this adaptability is what separates likeable people from those who feel ""off"" somehow.



give credit generously, take blame privately. when something goes well in a group setting, highlight others' contributions. when something fails, don't publicly throw people under the bus. this pattern builds loyalty insanely fast.



use the 70/30 rule in conversations. let others talk 70% of the time. you talk 30%. feels counterintuitive but people walk away from conversations thinking you're fascinating when they did most of the talking. they just feel good, and they associate that feeling with you.



the thing about charm is it's not manipulation if it's genuine. you're not tricking people into liking you. you're removing the barriers (self consciousness, performance anxiety, trying too hard) that prevent authentic connection. that's what this whole thing comes down to. being interested instead of interesting. making people feel valued instead of impressed.



start small. pick one thing from this list and try it for a week. maybe it's asking better questions. maybe it's putting your phone away. see what happens. the goal isn't to become some charismatic god, it's just to stop being invisible. to be someone people remember, and more importantly, someone people feel good around.",1,1770144690.0,ModernDatingDoneRight,0,1.0,False

At the time, I was very broken, dealing with undiagnosed BPD and coming out of a bad relationship. I felt almost impossible to love, but he still saw the good in me and always tried to make me happy.

A month after the breakup, we got back together briefly, but after the second date he had he told me he never wanted to try to be together again. I was devastated and couldn’t imagine life without him, and in my desperate search of not feeling anything, I slept with a coworker on April 26th.

In May, my ex and I started talking again, and I told him about it because I deeply regretted it. He said I betrayed him. Even his family, who once loved me, turned against me and didn’t want me near him. I tried to explain that I hadn’t cheated and that he had clearly stated that he didn’t want to get back together, but it didn’t matter. He wanted me to apologize to his family; although I wanted to do anything to fix things, I refused, and I still believe that was too much to ask.

After a short no contact break, we started talking, going on dates, and sleeping together, even though we were both seeing other people. He told me about the women he dated, including once calling another girl by my name, but he still didn’t want to get back together.

By the end of the year we stopped talking, though we wished each other happy birthday in December. In our last conversation, we agreed to talk later about a possible future together. In January, I asked him to meet for coffee and talk, but he said he had “left that in 2024,” didn’t want to talk anymore, and blocked me on Whatsapp.

I was devastated again and felt like I had been used for almost a year as a placeholder while he looked for someone else. I tried to get his attention by other means (nothing crazy, just trying to talk to him about anything) but he always ignored me.

In May 2025, his band released a song called “Never again”, the same words he used during our second breakup. I congratulated him on Instagram (since I was blocked on WhatsApp) because I really like his band. He replied very coldly. When I asked why he was being so distant, he removed me from Instagram and then blocked me. We’ve had no contact since, and I later found out he was in a relationship.

We both loved The Cure and it was our thing, but he was using their songs with pictures of her, as if it was meaningless to our relationship, that ended up breaking my heart completely.

I still remain blocked on everything, and since then, I’m a completely new person. I’m the healthiest I’ve ever been. I tried dating but no one comes even close to making me feel the way he did, and all I dream of is him giving me another chance, seeing that I can be a great girlfriend and I’m no longer the mess I was.

I’m now 25 and I can’t move on, I still try to make the best out of my life for me and for the sick idea of one day seeing him again and telling me he’s proud of me.

If anyone knows anything that may help me to actually move one, I’m opened to any advice.

This is my very first post here, so if anyone took the time to read all of this, thank you from the bottom of my heart.",1,1770144567.0,heartbreak,0,0.99,False

1qv0gu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1qv0gu9/cat_allergymcas_mystery/,Cat Allergy/MCAS Mystery,"(8-10 minute read)

I’m dealing with a long-running health mystery, and while I’m not completely certain this is directly related to my cat, many of the signs seem to point in that direction. I’d really appreciate any perspective from people who have dealt with similar symptoms, mast cell or histamine issues, environmental triggers, or cat allergies that don’t show up on standard tests. I’m going to try to give the full picture, because I’ve learned that leaving out “small” details usually ends up being the thing that matters most.

The core problem is that I am constantly sick. Almost every night when I go to bed, I experience what I can only describe as hive-like symptoms. Some nights are mild, some are awful, and I can never identify what makes one night worse than another. My face flushes and tingles, my body feels like it’s buzzing or vibrating internally, and the fatigue can be overwhelming — to the point where it feels like my whole body is shaking. I often get heart palpitations, and sometimes I wake up early in the morning feeling hot or sweaty.

Last night was particularly bad. I’ve been sick all weekend with congestion and nighttime fever, and last night was the first night the fever finally broke. Instead of relief, I woke up around 5am with my face and chest wildly tingling and an exhaustion so deep it felt like my body had been drained overnight.

This poor sleep has created a vicious cycle. I get sick one to two times per month, on and off, and this has been happening for about two years. Winter is by far the worst; summers usually give me some degree of relief. I’ve had repeated sinus infections — about twice a year — and last year alone I needed two rounds of antibiotics. When my sinuses flare, I feel nerve sensitivity in the tops of my molars, especially when moving my head quickly. An ENT told me this was due to pressure in my maxillary sinuses. All of this has started to seriously affect my career, dating life, social life, and even my hockey career. I can’t keep living like this.

For context, I’m 35 years old, live in New York City, and work from home. Historically, I’ve always been extremely active and healthy. I cycle constantly, lift weights, and play ice hockey one to three times a week. Before all of this, I rarely got sick. My diet is solid, and I’m very intentional about supplements and recovery.

One thing that may or may not be relevant is that I’ve been drinking kratom tea daily for about eight years. I usually have around 16 ounces a day, sometimes more. I don’t drink alcohol — partly because of kratom, but also because alcohol absolutely destroys my immune system. I’ll come back to kratom later, because I’ve noticed a very clear pattern with it.

About four and a half years ago, I got my first cat. She’s tiny, just under six pounds, and barely sheds. I never noticed any cat allergies before owning her. Last year, I saw an immunologist and had both a full blood allergy panel and a skin prick test done. I was allergic to nothing — literally nothing. From what I understand, conditions like mast cell activation syndrome or histamine intolerance don’t necessarily show up on standard allergy tests.

I also don’t have classic cat allergy symptoms. My cat will rub her face on mine and I don’t have immediate reactions. If anything happens, it’s very subtle. Recently, though — especially when I’m sick and inside all day — I’ve noticed slightly worse watery eyes and fatigue. One thing worth mentioning is that my ex-girlfriend’s cat caused these symptoms far more strongly than my cat ever has, although I never lived with that cat.

There are a few other health factors that feel important to mention. In April 2020, I had COVID and lost my sense of smell. I only received the first two boosters. Since then, I’ve likely had COVID once or twice more, but without the same severity. In 2021 bloodwork, I had elevated Lyme disease antibodies, likely from a camping trip. My doctor at the time said it wasn’t anything to worry about and didn’t treat it.

From 2018 to 2022, I lived in an apartment with extensive black mold — in the walls and in the overhead AC units. A memory that still sticks with me is that my sister briefly lived with me and slept in a room with a moldy AC unit. She would wake up with swollen eyes. Eventually, I moved into that room myself, and that move happened around the same time I got my cat. Later, the upstairs apartment was renovated due to a roof leak, and black mold was visible all over the walls. I no longer live in that apartment.

In my current apartment, going to bed has become genuinely stressful. What’s strange is that these symptoms almost exclusively happen at night. I’ve taken naps on my bed during the day without any issue, but when it’s nighttime and I lie down to sleep, it’s like my nervous system completely freaks out.

Over time, this has started affecting my gut as well. During flare-ups, I experience terrible gas — I can eat almost anything and immediately have foul, rancid gas. This has improved somewhat recently, possibly because I’ve been prioritizing hydration, electrolytes, chia seeds in the morning, and waiting at least an hour before having coffee.

To manage nighttime symptoms, I take a combination of Zyrtec, Pepcid, and Flonase. Most nights, this does very little, if anything. The goal has been to reduce overall histamine load, but the results are inconsistent at best.

I wash my sheets weekly and have kicked my cat out of the bedroom for two to three weeks at a time with no noticeable improvement. I have four to five hospital-grade HEPA air purifiers and clean the filters weekly. Last winter, I bought a brand-new mattress, sheets, and natural latex pillows, and I remember feeling symptoms the very first night I slept on them. That was incredibly defeating.

I’ve tried aggressive ventilation — opening all the windows, blasting the purifiers, setting up fans to create cross-breezes, even using a leaf blower to “purge” surfaces. I honestly don’t know if that helped or made things worse.

For anyone thinking this is purely cat-related, I’ve also tried Pacagen. I used the food additive for a month with no noticeable effect. The spray seems to help a little, but I can’t stand the smell and still use it anyway.

Lifestyle-wise, I feel like I’m doing everything “right.” I often sleep in hotels on hockey weekends and tend to feel better there. I exercise regularly, lift weights, cycle around the city, use the sauna one to three times a week, and cold plunge once or twice a week. My supplement routine includes NAC, Quercetin, D3 with K2, B-complex, fish oil, creatine, magnesium (glycinate and threonate), zinc, L-theanine, and collagen. I also understand the importance of rest and scale back when my body clearly needs it.

Finally, kratom. I’ve cut it out in the past for two to three weeks at a time. It’s less an addiction and more part of my social routine — after work, people go to a bar; I go to a café and have kratom. That said, I’ve noticed a very consistent pattern now for the fourth time: on nights where I overdo kratom (around three glasses for me), I get shallow, poor sleep, and the next day I end up with a sinus infection, cold, or some kind of sickness. The correlation is strong enough that I’m cutting it out again for now.

At this point, I genuinely don’t know what else to do. I’m trying to understand whether this could be cat allergies without IgE markers, mast cell activation or histamine overload, something environmental in my apartment, a nervous system feedback loop, or some combination of all of the above. If you’ve experienced anything similar or have insight into these kinds of issues, I’d really appreciate hearing your thoughts.

1qv0g7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1qv0g7x/there_is_a_room_in_my_house_that_doesnt_exist/,There is a room in my house that doesn't exist.,"I didn't just buy this house, I birthed it. Every angle, every joist, every inch of wiring exists because I drew it on vellum first. I know that the master bedroom is exactly fourteen steps from the landing. I know the crawlspace has a clearance of three feet, two inches. And I know, with absolute mathematical certainty, that the pantry shares a load-bearing wall directly with the garage.

There is no void space. There is no hollow. It is drywall against drywall.

That is why I have been standing in the kitchen for forty-five minutes, staring at the hallway.

It started this morning. I walked past the pantry to get coffee and noticed a shadow where the light usually hits the baseboards. I thought a bulb had blown. But when I looked closer, I saw the frame. It was a narrow, dark oak door with a brass handle, set perfectly into the wall between the pantry and the garage entry.

It wasn't there when I went to sleep.

I pulled out the blueprints. I laid them on the island, tracing the lines with a shaking finger. Pantry. Wall. Garage. There is zero room for a door there. If you opened it, you would step directly into the studs and insulation of the garage wall. It is physically impossible.

Yet, I can hear a draft coming from underneath it.

It’s a cold, wet air that smells like old copper and stagnant water. It isn't the smell of my garage. It isn't the smell of anything in this house.

I reached for the handle ten minutes ago, but my hand froze. Because I heard something else.

On the other side of that impossible door, inside a room that cannot exist, I can hear the scratching of a pencil on paper. It’s rhythmic, frantic, and loud. Like someone drawing.

And then, a voice muffled, but clear enough spoke from the other side.

Kimbal Musk, brother of Elon Musk and Boulder resident, is referenced at least 140 times in emails exchanged between Jeffrey Epstein and his associates, according to a new batch of documents the Department of Justice released last week as part of the Epstein files investigation.

The emails range from exchanges between Kimbal Musk and disgraced financier Epstein scheduling party times and meeting dates to Kimbal Musk thanking Epstein and his associates for “connecting” him to a woman in 2012.

One of Epstein’s friends, Boris Nikolic, replied that Kimbal Musk “better be nice” to the woman because “Jeffrey goes crazy when someone mistreats his girls/friends.” Kimbal Musk replied that he had received the message “wide and clear” and included a winking emoji.

Kimbal Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Kimbal Musk opened The Kitchen restaurant on Pearl Street in Boulder in 2004 along with chef Hugo Matheson. The restaurant now has locations in Denver, Chicago and Austin.

Many of the emails listed in the files were newsletters or updates about the restaurant or Kimbal Musk’s “learning garden” initiative, which created outdoor classrooms and gardens for hundreds of elementary school-aged children across the nation, including in Denver and Boulder.

  
[Learning Gardens photo - by Kimbal Musk (childrens faces blurred](https://i.redd.it/f67rgihn1chg1.png)

The emails exchanged between Kimbal Musk, Epstein, Nikolic and someone Kimbal Musk purports to date span 2012 to 2015, years after the first allegations surfaced about Epstein abusing young women and girls.

In January 2013, Epstein emails Kimbal Musk: “You are invited to the island for a couple of days, come relax.”

Kimbal Musk replied that he was dealing with “the nuclear explosion” that is his life, but he could perhaps come that spring. Additional emails show Kimbal Musk inviting Epstein to various events, planning coffee meetings and trying to schedule visits.

In one email exchange, a redacted recipient received an email from Kimbal Musk asking to dial back their relationship: “We know how much we like each other. But I am just not able to do a real relationship right now. Would you be up for going back a step to just dating? We would see each other on weekends when we can and focus it on fun stuff.”

The redacted recipient sent the message to Epstein who responded “good news” and “now i have you back again full time” and invited the redacted recipient to “the ranch.”

The games you want from me must be redeemed soon. I can't vouch for a key's validity when you keep it stored for longer without redeeming. One of the reasons why: Some Game Developers had started to revoke unused keys some time after their expiration date. Sadly, this seems to turn into a growing trend with game keys.

1qv0bb0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/1qv0bb0/nausea_and_anxiety_during_ultrasound/,Nausea and anxiety during ultrasound,"I just got back from my 21 week anatomy scan. About 20 minutes into the scan I started feeling like maybe I was having a panic attack, I got a cold sweat over my body and an extremely nauseous feeling. I told the OB that I had to pee and I really needed to use the restroom so I slowly walked to the bathroom. I was so dizzy that when I got into the bathroom, I kind of collapse near the toilet and just started puking. I sat there for a minute to catch my breath and then got up and went to the sink and splashed cold water on my face. After about 10 minutes in the bathroom, I came back in and told her that I wasn’t feeling well so she told me to try and sit up a little bit and drink some water. Once I started feeling a bit better, we continued with the scan.

Since I couldn’t really calm down, we didn’t get to finish so I have to go back in two weeks to finish my scan. Has anyone else been through this? I’m trying to think of how I can make things better for next time. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!

For context, I am 33 this is my first pregnancy. I had a few sips of coffee and a breakfast sandwich from Starbucks right before I got there.

It is very likely that I will probably go out shopping and buy a bunch of shit that I don’t need but that I want.

Regardless of what day of the week my 30th birthday falls on that day and the next several days will be called off from work.

There’s going to be a dinner at a fancy restaurant, the boys will all be shined up in their finest suits, bringing their ladies with them, we will laugh, toast, and eat and drink to memories of the past.

o   a sore thoat

o   headaches

o   fatigue

o   coughing

o   shortness of breath

o   general weakness

i still managed to get my things done i finished school and university with great succes even though its been really hard due to the long covid.

two months ago i started a new job i was really looking for. its an office job so i sit a lot and look at my screens.

quickly i noticed that my neck hurts a lot due to that long sitting even though my posture and all positions are correct.

it started with chronic neck pain and now i get episodes of massive fatigue and dizziness after drinking a coffee.

that was completely new to me so i stopped drinking coffee as i thought it was the trigger.

two days ago i woke up, went to work and felt generally fine. but after two hours at work it felt like someone shut me off completely like these episodes after coffee.

since this happened i have really bad brainfog and also a slight headache and still neckpain. i am unable to work since i cant concentrate or drive a car anymore.

did anyone ecperience this similar to my story?

is my sickness getting worse or is it the neck pain that makes the brain fog and the dizziness? i have so many questions.

im scared that my neurological symptoms got so much worse due to pem because i had sex the day before this episode began.

maybe you could let me know if you also got worse symptomes during your sickness or if anyone had to deal with their neck like me??

Went to a night club in a neighboring town 45 minutes away and was last seen leaving the club alone after 12:30. She was not intoxicated. Her car was tagged the next morning by law enforcement officials along the side of I-20 with her purse still in it.  
  
It’s reported that her seat was pushed all the way back, as if she wasn’t the one driving it.  
  
Brandi was just weeks away from starting classes again at Trinity Valley Community College in Brownsboro, Texas. She wanted to become a teacher.  
  
But first, she visited her mother in Tyler, Texas. On the evening of August 2, she went out to meet some friends. “She came in, she changed clothes, and said she was going to the club with some friends,” Brandi’s mother, Ellen Tant, told [NBC affiliate KETK](https://www.ketk.com/news/special-reports/vanished/vanished-brandi-wells/). She assumed Brandi was going somewhere in town. Little did she know that Brandi was heading to Longview, about 45 minutes away.  
  
According to KETK, security footage shows Brandi entering a nightclub called Graham Central Station on McCann Road – now Electric Cowboy – around 10:36 p.m. and checking in at the counter. People inside would later tell police that Brandi was asking for money for gas. She was inside the club for nearly two hours and was seen on tape walking alone out toward the parking lot around 12:30 a.m.  
  
According to KETK, Brandi’s purse and a gas can her family believed did not belong to her were found in the trunk. They also reported that the driver’s side seat of the car had been adjusted for someone taller than Brandi, but because it took days to link the car to her disappearance, authorities didn’t know if that happened before or after the car was abandoned.  
  
Brandi was around 5’ tall and weighed 125-130 lbs. at the time of her disappearance, with blonde or strawberry-blonde hair and blue eyes. She would be 42 years old today.  
  
Police suspect she is a murder victim but there is no direct evidence tying that assumption to a murder aside from her being missing since 2006  
  
If you have any information about Brandi’s disappearance, please contact the Longview Police Department at 903-237-1199  
  
——————————————————————————–  
***Further information listed on the Doe Network site:***  
  
On the night she vanished, Wells drove to what was Graham Central Station (now Electric Cowboy) on McCann Road in Longview in her black 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix coupe with Texas plates. She had arrived with her fuel tank almost at empty and was asking people for gas money. She was not intoxicated. There is surveillance video indicating she left the club alone.  
  
Wells’ car was found abandoned the next day by a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper along Interstate 20 about 300 yards west of FM 2087 with her purse still inside the vehicle. Her car had front passenger damage above the front wheel. Longview police didn’t identify the car as belonging to Wells until five days later. There were no signs of a struggle. Wells’ cellphone was found later at another location.

Auto join rules. Don't record literally everything. Set rules so certain calendar events skip recording automatically. I exclude anything marked personal or lunch or coffee chat. No need for transcripts of those.

Default sharing. Decide upfront whether recordings share with all attendees automatically or stay private by default. Changing this later when you already have hundreds of recordings is annoying.

Notification preferences. You probably don't need an email every time a recording finishes processing. Turned those off and just check the app when I actually need something.

Retention period. Talk to their support team and set how long recordings stick around before auto deleting. I do 90 days. Keeps storage manageable and forces me to actually pull out anything important rather than assuming I can find it ""somewhere"" later.

Integration connections. Actually set up the slack and notion integrations you said you were going to set up three months ago. Takes 5 minutes and makes everything way more useful.

Recording disclosure settings. Most tools let you customize the message participants see when recording starts. Make it match your company's tone instead of whatever generic thing is default.

Using fellow but honestly most of this applies across tools. The defaults are fine for trying it out but worth revisiting once you've actually used it for a few weeks and know your real workflow.",1,1770143845.0,AIAgentsInAction,1,1.0,False

I’ve been working here for almost two years. It’s a kind of stressful job but it pays well and everyone is nice (aside from like one guy) and I like it. My boss is REALLY nice. He brings in donuts every monday, he comes from his office a few times a day to just like check in with everyone. Pretty much every morning he asks if I slept well or had a good breakfast. 

He has graying temples and a tummy and crow’s feet and a beard that is really well groomed. Salt and pepper yknow. He smells like good smoky cologne and he dresses like one of those dark academia mood boards. But he wears stupid socks with random shit on them and colorful ties too, so he’s not like intimidating.

He’s really hands on. It’s a problem. He likes to drag me around by the arm instead of just tell me where to go, and every time he comes over to see what i’m working on or if I need help, he puts his hand on my shoulder. Or the back of my neck. Hello HR (joking obviously.) And then I have to sit at my desk for a while because I can’t get up due to reasons.

Sometimes he has to put on his little thin framed glasses and I have to fucking leave. 

He doesn’t have a wedding ring but he has a faint indent on his finger so I have no idea if he’s married. Never talks about wife or kids but who knows.

AI was having car problems a while ago and didn’t really have a reliable way to get to work, so for like a month he picked me up and dropped me off everyday because I was on his route anyway. And he didn’t let me pay him gas money. And his car has a CD player and he likes 70s rock but also Slipknot. He let me borrow CDs to listen to. I don’t even have a CD player. My car is working again but I miss going with him. 

He has expensive cigars but he doesn’t light them, he just likes the taste, he quit smoking when he was in his thirties. 

He calls me kid and I really shouldn’t like it but I do.

He felt bad when he found out he missed my birthday and offered to buy me a coffee. So we went across the road during lunch break and he bought me my favorite coffee in a size large (I only buy small because large is like $12) and a bunch of danishes and donuts too. So I offered to share because he was eyeing them and they were expensive, and then we sat and drank coffee and ate little treats and he told me all about his pet fish and I really want him to do very intense things to me.

I blush really obviously but he never says anything. One of my coworkers caught on on like day 2 and she likes to torture me about it. I’m pretty sure he’s overheard her teasing but again, not a word about it

Hoping that other AuDhd women in this sub will understand my problem, and not think I'm totally crazy : /   
  
I know I need to consume more protein in my diet, but I have a very hard time eating it. Whether it's b/c the texture of meat, beans, or eggs suddenly becomes disgusting, or b/c I'm overwhelmed and exhausted to actually cook food. I often end my day with very little protein in my system. I know this impacts tons of things (energy, mood, etc.) so I am trying hard to find a good alternative to make sure I get enough protein daily. 

Here's my main issue: I have a very sensitive taster and despise most forms of added sugar and flavorings. I have a strong sweet tooth, so I know I will need something sweet in order to be consistent with it. I do best with chocolate or coffee flavor, but I am caffeine sensitive so I know the latter sadly won't work if it has caffeine. Anything other than good ole sugar cane tastes like poison to me (dramatic, but true). That means any of the artificial sweeteners are out (Aspartame (Equal, NutraSweet); Saccharin (Sweet'N Low); Sucralose (Splenda); Acesulfame Potassium (Ace-K) -- honestly don't know wtf that last one is....). I have tried to force myself to consume anything with stevia or monk fruit, but they leave a terrible after taste in my mouth which triggers my sensory overwhelm. 

TL;DR: I am looking for a chocolate flavored protein drink or powder that has minimal and quality ingredients and that uses regular sugar to sweeten it.
