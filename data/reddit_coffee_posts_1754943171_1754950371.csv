1mnqk5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_LumeLLC/comments/1mnqk5s/a_cup_that_changed_my_flow/,🌿 A Cup That Changed My Flow,"
When Lume entered my life, it was a feeling; a moment of peace in the middle of noise. One morning, I was poured a cup of oolong tea from Pu’er, China, and instantly felt like I had tapped into something ancient yet aligned with who I am right now: a woman balancing motherhood, dreams, business, beauty, and breath. That very first sip slowed everything down, and I’ll never forget it.

What started as an unknown became a daily ritual. I began to notice how oolong helped me stay focused throughout the day without the crash I used to get from coffee. There’s a natural clarity that comes with it and like my thoughts line up better and also my mood evens out. It’s helped me feel more balanced, especially in moments of high stress (shoutout to my cortisol levels finally chilling out!). As someone who bloats often, I also noticed gentle digestive relief and yes, oolong keeps me flowing right to the bathroom in the best, smoothest way. 😂It’s like my body finally found something it recognizes and welcomes.

Beyond the benefits, let’s talk about the flavor. Rich. Smooth. Warm. Comforting. It’s not overpowering or bitter, it's a subtle luxury in a cup. It feels like self-respect in liquid form. And that’s what I want Lume to be for others: a small luxury that becomes a part of your lifestyle, not just your shelf.

Lume is more than just traditional Chinese tea. It’s a lifestyle rooted in ancient wisdom and poured into a modern cup. It’s a brand full of modern elegance that resonates with pure love and ultimate care. Every leaf, every blend, every package. It all comes from intention from me to you. This isn’t just tea. It’s care. It’s clear. It’s a tool for your elevation.

I feel illuminated in every way; mentally, physically, spiritually and that’s why I love Lume. I want you to experience what it feels like to sip your way into balance, to align with something greater, and to claim your space in the world with presence.

 So if you’ve been needing a sign, here it is.
 Start sipping until you reach your mountain top moment.

 Stay elevated. Stay blissed. Ciao!

- Princess NuNu 🌸

Think about common triggers in a Western diet: coffee, spicy foods, high meat intake, sodas, processed snacks. These don’t just cause irritation in the stomach — they contribute to a higher *systemic* acid load that your body has to buffer 24/7.

One thing we’ve been experimenting with is **alkaline electrolytes** — specifically bicarbonates and citrates paired with sodium and potassium in precise stoichiometric ratios (and nothing else). Here’s why it’s interesting:

* **Bicarbonates** in water can help neutralize the acid from your food before it contributes to your total acid load.
* **Citrates** get converted in your liver and kidneys into additional bicarbonates, which act as buffers in your blood. This can help shift your body toward a healthier acid-base balance — and yes, it can even alkalize your urine.

The surprising part? You can get many of the benefits people seek from an “alkaline diet” without overhauling everything you eat.  AND FOR MANY PEOPLE IT MEANS GETTING OFF DRUGS, PPI, AND OTC, in favor of wholistic and natural approach.

1mnq8o4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/1mnq8o4/just_another_late_night_until_it_wasnt/,Just another late night... until it wasn't.,"Hey everyone, long-time lurker, first-time poster. I usually just read the really messed-up stuff here when I'm trying to kill time during my late-night shifts. I work alone at a vape shop – 4 PM to midnight. It's usually pretty dead, which is fine by me. I'm not really a people person.

Most nights, it's the same routine. Clean the glass displays, re-stock the coils, maybe have a couple of those weird conversations with the one or two regulars who stumble in close to closing. I usually have my earbuds in, listening to podcasts or just chatting with my friend online. He's pretty much my only real connection to the outside world.

Tonight was the same as any other. Dead quiet. I was wiping down the counter for what felt like the hundredth time when my mom called. We talked for a bit about nothing much – the weather, if I'd eaten dinner, the usual.

Then she mentioned my coffee mug.

It’s just a plain, slightly chipped diner mug with some faded logo I can’t even make out anymore. Nothing special to anyone else, but it’s always been my favorite. My grandpa gave it to me years ago when I was a kid. I remember it so clearly. We were at his house, and he was making coffee. He poured me a little bit in this mug – way too much sugar, probably – and told me it was a “man’s mug.” It always made me feel a little bit older, a little bit special. It's a good memory.

So, when my mom said, “Oh, I remember that mug. Did you ever find out who left it here after that yard sale?” I just froze.

“What?” I asked, thinking I must have misheard her.

“You know,” she said, her voice all casual. “That big community sale down on Elm Street a few years back? I remember you brought that mug home. It was in that box of random kitchen stuff.”

Suddenly, a completely different memory flashed in my head. I was at the yard sale, the sun was hot, and there were piles of dusty junk everywhere. I saw the mug in a cardboard box, picked it up, and thought, “Hey, this looks kind of cool.” It was just… random.

I felt this cold dread wash over me. One minute I had this warm, comforting memory of my grandpa, and the next… it was gone, replaced by this utterly mundane, meaningless moment.

“Mom,” I said, my voice shaking a little, “Grandpa gave me that mug.”

She chuckled softly. “No, honey. Your grandpa never gave you a mug like that. You got that at the yard sale. I remember it.”

I hung up the phone, my hand trembling. I walked over to the cabinet and took out the mug. It felt… different. Cold. Empty of the sentimental weight it usually carried.

I keep looking at it, trying to reconcile these two completely different memories. One feels real, like a part of me. The other… it feels just as real, but it’s like a stranger barged into my head and planted it there.

I don’t know what’s going on. Has this ever happened to anyone else? I feel like I’m losing my mind.

I’ll probably post again if anything else… weird… happens.",1,1754948762.0,DarkTales,0,1.0,False

Spain shattered records in 2024, hosting 94 million international tourists and raking in $130 billion in spending according to Reuters. Travelers are morphing from selfie-seekers into wellness pilgrims, lining up for clinical nirvana in the Spanish sun.

SHA is not a spa, it is a tactical ambush on aging. The clinic pairs detox diets with genetic diagnostics and hydrotherapy in a choreography that reads like sci-fi fantasy run by scientists. Vogue calls it the ultimate rejuvenation temple where microgreens glint like DNA sequencers and turmeric–lavender herbal blends taste like anti-age incantations.

Dawn breaks with sunrise yoga over the Mediterranean, followed by metabolic scans and meals designed to outthink your mitochondria. Coffee doesn’t caffeinate it sedates with adaptogens that snap your nervous system awake. The four-day Rebalance retreat costs about $2,220 excluding lodging. Genetic tests range from $333 to $1,110 based on complexity, latest figures from their website suggest.

Rooms begin at $555 per night for deluxe, up to $1,887 for grand, and peak at $8,300 per night for the regal suite. All with balconies drenched in sea air and salted light. Infinity pools hover between sky and sea, delivering water therapy that feels like drowning in bliss.

Plan your trip from March through November when Alicante basks under 330 days of sun, perfect for cliffside spa treatments and sunrise hikes. The new Alicante-Elche Miguel Hernández Airport funnels travelers here in under an hour with shuttles costing $17 to $33.

Evenings slide into gorge. SHAmadi café serves high-velocity health that tastes like sunshine embroidered with lavender and lemon. Pressed juices sting awake. Detox broths glow like molten honey. Dinner plates push local olive oil clouds and micro-portions designed to rewire your digestive soul, all running from $55 to $110 per course.

This is not a retread of youth. It is a convulsive era of cellular rebellion. SHA collapses time. It recalibrates you. You leave feeling like pain had no chance of surviving and age was only a rumor.

This is Officer 121. The following is an unofficial entry. You won’t find the full story in any active report system.  

Case File 12-0005 

Date: November 2012 

Location: Teak Hill near Mile Marker 17 

Status: Case Closed 

   
Some calls sound strange from the start.   
Others sound like nothing—until you’re in it.   
That night, Route 9 was empty. Winter had settled in. The kind of cold that freezes breath midair.   
The call came in as possible trespasser on board. But the driver’s tone… it didn’t match the words. 

**911 Transcript** 

DISPATCH: County 911, what’s your emergency?   
BUS DRIVER: Uh… yeah. This is Gerald from Line 52. I’ve got a… situation.   
DISPATCH: Okay, sir. What's going on?   
BUS DRIVER: I’m on my last run. Only had two passengers. Dropped the last one off about twenty minutes ago. But—uh—someone’s still sitting in the back.   
DISPATCH: They didn’t get off?   
BUS DRIVER: No, ma’am. And I swear to you—   
(short pause, muffled sound of idling engine)   
BUS DRIVER: —I swear I never saw them get on. 

 

**Field Report** 

“We caught up to the bus just past mile marker 17. Gerald was waiting outside, hands jammed into his coat pockets, breath coming in sharp bursts.   
He said the figure hadn’t moved. Just… sitting there in the dark, two rows from the back.   
I told Roy to stay by the driver. I boarded alone.” 

As I climbed the steps, I announced myself, “Sheriff’s Office.”  

The smell hit first—like pond water gone bad. The windows were fogged, but no heat was running.   
The only light I had was the ambient lighting in the aisle and the small overhead above each seat. I clicked on my flashlight.  

My boots echoed down the aisle as I approached him.  

The figure sat still. Didn’t look to see who was walking towards him. Not looking out the window. Just facing forward starring at his shoes. Hand clasped on his knees.  

   
I said, “Sir, my name is Officer Dawson. We got a call about someone still on the bus. Seems you missed all the stops.” 

He said nothing. 

“You doin’ alright tonight sir?” Still, he did not speak. 

 I’ve dealt with drunks, runaways, the homeless and drug addicts, but he didn’t strike me as any of those types. I glanced out the window to Roy who was looking at me concerned. I didn’t dare take my eyes of the guy in front of me for too long. There was something very off about him. He sat there nonchalant, not even making eye contact. 

""Look, I know it's a cold one out. Do you have some place to go?” 

He still wouldn’t acknowledge me. Okay...fine. 

“Sir, I’m going to need to see some forms of ID and we are going to have to remove you from this bus.”  

Finally, his head turned up to look at me, but the rest of his body remained perfectly still.    
I stepped a little closer, flashlight sweeping across him. His skin—what I could see of it—looked wet. 

That’s when I noticed: water pooling under the seat.   
I reached for my radio. The eyes… weren’t reflecting my flashlight. They were absorbing it. 

I was transfixed.  

Trying to get a grip on the terror racing through my body... I blinked—and the seat was empty.   
But the water… it was pooling beneath the seat and running down the aisle toward me. 

Quickly, I hopped up into one of the seats. 

Roy must have seen the movement because he was barreling up the stairs on to the bus.   
Something splashed ahead of me. Heavy. Wet.   
I turned—fast—thinking I’d see a person.   
Instead, I caught a shape sliding between the seats.   
Too long. Too low to the ground. And it moved like it knew the bus better than the driver ever did. 

Roy scanned the bus looking for the threat. “Where is he!?” He shouted. Hand on his gun, he made his way to me. “Dawson...” He spoke to me like one would speak to a spooked horse. Normally, that would bother me, but right now, I was focused on figuring out where the water had gone. 

Roy stared at me, eyes pleading for answers. But I couldn’t look at him.  

“There!” I yelled and pointed to the stairs leading out of the bus. But I didn't make a move to follow. Roy turned to see the water cascade down. Confusion painted his face. He looked back to me. “What the...?” 

Then Gerald the bus driver screamed. 

That unfroze us both. We took off at a dead run clamoring out of the bus, trying to get to Gerald. 

Aftermath 

When we got outside, there was no sign of him. We called in additional units and Search and Rescue to do an extended search of the woods and nearby trailed around the lake. 

Roy and I cleared the bus. No sign of entry from the emergency door. No sign of exit other than the damp stairs. Gerald swore to Roy that the back door never opened while he was on his route. 

   
The water left behind tested clean, aside from some algae and sediment. Likely from the lake. 

I couldn’t write what I saw not after what happened last time. Roy only saw “self-directed” water for all intents and purposes. 

 

Roy and I rode back to the office in silence. Both of us lost in our own thoughts. Since Roy offered to drive, I had the pleasure of starring out the window and contemplating my own sanity. 

Roy broke the silence. “Dawson, I want you to know...I saw the guy on the bus, and I believe you, what you saw.” 

I didn’t look at him. “Did you see him turn into a puddle...” I asked sarcastically. 

Roy paused. “No.” he said quietly. “But I did see the water move on its own and I know no one got off that bus. No human at least.” 

“Too bad the body cams didn’t back that up. Roy and I had a minute to get our stories straight before backup had arrived. After the incident at that farmhouse and my last partner getting a promotion because I wrote the truth of what we had seen, Roy agreed that what we would say wasn’t going to be what actually happened. 

 

 

**Sheriff’s Office** 

Several days went by and there were no repercussions. The body cams showed me talking to a dark bus and me getting cast to one side. Then it cut out. Our report said that I was knocked aside, and the man must had hidden under the seats when Roy came to check on me and then ran out the bus.  I’m not proud of the rewrite, but I wasn’t giving up on this case either. 

Roy had gone out for coffee, and I was sitting at my desk looking over the reports. 

A shadow fell over my desk, and I assumed that Roy had comeback with my Quad Shot Espresso.  

But it wasn’t Roy. 

It was my Captain. 

“Just wanted to tell you good job on that report for the Status Check on that Greyhound. It's a real shame about Gerald. Poor fella probably ran into the woods scared out of his mind when that lunatic came running of the bus.” 

I collected myself, praying that my face didn’t give anything away. 

“Thank you, sir. I just wish we could find him.” 

“I do too. It's a real shame when someone gets lost in the woods. But you know better than most that it's easy to do. Too many people get lost in those woods every year and are never found.” 

I solemnly nodded. 

He knocked on my desk twice. “Well, keep up the good work.” Then he made his way back to his office and shut the door. 

I could see Roy hesitating in the door until the Captain was safely back in his office. 

“What was that all about?” He asked as he handed me my coffee. 

“Oh, just a pat on the back for not recording all the creepy shit that happens in this county.” 

“Ah...”  

 

 

I was working well into the night. I didn't tell Roy I was still investigating. He didn’t need to get caught up in any trouble if the Captain found out. 

Something was still bothering me. Who was that guy? Where did he come from? And what did he want with Gerald?  

I looked into calls involving Gerald, but there were none aside from a traffic stop two years ago. He was going 40mph in a 35mph. He had a couple calls of him lodging complaints about the neighbor kids running dirt bikes in his back yard. However, there was nothing that led me to believe that anyone would have anything against Gerald. He was a very kind man, had been running bus routes up that way for the last 20 years. Hell, the guy went to play bingo every Wednesday with his mother a county over. About 5 years ago when the church was getting remodeled, he offered to let them hold the AA meetings at his house, so they had a place to go. The group enjoyed it so much he continued to host it every Sunday night he wasn’t running his routes. 

That gave me an idea. 

It was a long shot, but I started looking into hit and run accidents. Unfortunately, there were a lot more than you would want to find, especially on back country roads in the middle of the forest. 

But one stuck out.  

911 had received a call about six years ago. From an auto mechanic. Stated A gentleman had brought in a vehicle that had a huge dent in the front bumper and blood on the hood. The owner of the vehicle said he'd hit a deer. But the mechanic didn't buy it. There were no fibers left from the deer. Since there were no reports of a hit and run that week, no one documented the owner of the vehicle. Shocker. 

The next day I took some time off and went out to speak to that mechanic. Roland was in his 70’s now and could only give me bits and pieces of that day but he did remember the owner of the vehicle. 

He said had it been anyone other than Gerald, he would have pushed the police harder to investigate. 

Roland told me that Gerald had brought the car in on a Thursday. Since Wednesday night he spent playing poker with his mother, there was only one route Gerald would have taken. 

 

**Mile Marker 17** 

It was dusk when I arrived at the spot where Roy and I faced that thing on the bus. I wasn’t sure what I was hoping to find but I knew it was here. 

There was no pull off spot. Unless you knew the exact coordinates this wasn’t anywhere special. Cars didn't stop and the only people who would be walking would be fisherman and... hitchhikers. 

I made my way to the water's edge. Frost crackled under my boots as I crossed the small, wooded area between it and the road. There was a slight copper tang in the air. Not like fresh blood. More like old, stale blood.  

When I reached the lake, the area became quiet. The kind of quiet. where your listen to your own heartbeat just to break the silence. The sun was setting now, and I couldn’t see as well as I would have liked. I came here for a reason. To find something, I still didn’t know what that something was. Then... I heard it. 

Dripping. 

Everything was frosted over aside from the lake itself. I couldn't fathom what would be dripping. Realization hit.  

It was him. Somewhere out here with me. 

I knew I should have left a note for Roy, just in case something went wrong. “Damnit!” I groaned.  I spun in circles searching for the source of the sound. 

That's when I heard it again.  

But not dripping this time.  

Pouring.  

I turned on my flashlight. Scanning around, I caught the shimmer of water sliding over the leaves.  

It moved against the slope. And in the rippling reflection, for just a second, I saw the outline of a man. Tall still, head tilted just enough to let me know he saw me too. Then the shimmer folded back into the earth. I watched the water run, run back towards the lake. 

It became one with the water.  

I stood there, frozen, starring out as the spot where I saw the water pour into the lake.  

A ripple shook be from my trance. 

I looked directly in front of me about 20ft into the water where it began to ripple as something emerged. 

Slowly, a man's head revealed itself from the shallows. 

I shown my flashlight on it too get a better look. 

They were the same eyes that starred into mine on the bus. 

I was paralyzed. Everything in me screamed to run but my feet stay permanently fixed to the forest floor. 

At first it was like hearing someone yell under water, but then voice became clearer. 

“We’re down here...” 

 

**Follow Up**  

 After I had collected myself, I had called Roy. 

The next day a dive team came out and searched the lake. They didn’t have far to look though. 

Both the bodies of Gerald and REDACTED were found about 20 feet from the shore. The male showed injuries consistent with those from being struck by a vehicle. Gerald was ruled as a drowning. 

The news reported his death as a suicide due to evidence from six years ago being brought to light. 

Roy and I know the truth and now... So do you.

This isn’t about “modernity” or “freedom.” It’s exploitation, plain and simple, and it normalizes the objectification of women for profit...

And let’s not ignore the hypocrisy here : we live in a Muslim country, in a society built on Islamic values and principles. We’re supposed to act upon them, not throw them away because your pathetic urges took over your self-respect. You’re not in the café to “enjoy the coffee” or “have a good time.” You’re there to stare at a female worker and reduce her to be a sex toy...

This mindset is rotting our society from the inside. When businesses rely on base instincts to make money, they’re not just selling drinks... they’re selling away our dignity, our morals, and our culture. O the customers lmkboutin are letting it happen because it satisfies their shallow desires

It’s embarrassing, really. It’s shameful. And it sends the worst possible message to the next generation... that respect and values are negotiable if the price is right.

When will we finally wake up and decide that self-control and dignity matter more than profit and lust? Because right now, we’re selling our principles cheap, and the bill will come due sooner than we think.

Hope you are all doing well. ☺️

I recently moved to Jeddah and would love to meet and make new friends. 

Super chill vibes, love to go for coffee, drives, and enjoy different cuisines. 

This is my first time moving out of London so its been a little daunting but i know Jeddah is such a kind city.

I'm into sports (big chelsea fan). Love shows/movies (been an extra in two shows that are on netflix/amazon prime 👀) and enjoy a laugh. 

My music taste is very open, mainly into american Hip-Hop and R&B. Fav artist is the weekend who ive seen twice (really hope he tours Saudi, his shows are incredible, can always show you vids of them)

I Just turned 30 but feel full of energy and life aha. Open to meet and get to know Males or Females. 

Thank you all in advance for the kindness.

1mnq0mx,https://i.redd.it/gd8fyft4mgif1.jpeg,Looking to buy liesure/hybrid wfh office chair,"TLDR - 5' 9"" 192lbs currently own staples hyken chair thats failing after years. Looking for leisure/ergo chair (really something comfy but has mild lumbar support) for when I wfh 2 days and the rest of the time is a few hours here and there. $600 limit before tax+shipping. I do not want a 'task' workhorse of a chair but something in between where I can also unwind and enjoy on the weekends. Any recommendations so I can review some videos is helpful. Photo is a bit old, I have removed the 2nd monitor (my setup is on right) and raised my 34"" up to near eye level and bought a keyboard+mouse wrist pad. The dogs name is Mochi btw.

I have went down the rabbit hole and it is deep with knowledge and confusion with all the decisions. I have a budget of max $600 before taxes+shipping. I have watched a ton of review content on btod and other similar yt channels. I have looked at a bunch like colomay, autonomous, hbda(forget the name), adenaseat, secretlabs, laz-e boy, serta, leap v2, amie, soji, aeron, eurotech and others.

I am 5ft 10inches 192lbs and own a staples hyken that is falling apart (cylinder slowly lowers throughout the day, armrests chewed up, etc). I have went to staples and office depot since I live +3hrs from any commercial sales place to try top of the line brands. 

Ultimately my issue is that I work from home only 2 days out of the week. I make sure to get up every hour for at least 5 minutes and stretch, refill coffee/water etc. I also lift weights, stretch and do core ab exercises. All of these ergo chairs seem to be full work mode. After work I would like to have a more comfortable chair when playing games, browsing and watching content. 

Is there any recommendations for someone like me that does a little bit of both? I dislike mesh seats but mesh back is totally fine. I have a window A/C unit in the office I can kick on if I get too warm. I used my wife's race style chair all day today using the head/lumbar pillow and it felt good, better than the hyken and its a unknown brand bday gift. I am seriously considering the fabric version of the titan evo or a laz-e/serta executive style chair. I understand that they peel after a few years but at this point I might not care and just get a cover when that happens. 

Last note, which I would love to find an answer to but doubt it exists but looking for standing desk legs. I share the office and created a custom 10ft sealed butcher block and would love to convert it to a standing desk. I would think if I used 3 legs (one on each end and one in the middle towards the back and parallel) it would be sufficient weight capacity but not sure if you can get 3 to work at the same time. This would probably be the best improvement to be able to switch from sitting and standing. ",1,1754948239.0,OfficeChairs,0,1.0,False

Moved to New York a year ago, and since then at least 3 different stores told me that they either cant filled my drinks to the top or they would charge me extra. 

For example, one store charged me $1.00 for no ice on a Venti Caramel Macchiato. 
Another told me to tell the person taking orders if I wanted more Mango refresher or coconut milk on a Trenta Dragon Drink. 
On top of that, one other store told me they couldn’t fill my venti cup of ice coffee because that is ‘protocol’. I had asked this barista nicely to top off, and they said ‘other places were just being nice to top it off for you we just don’t do that here.’

I have reached out to customer service multiple times on these occasions and asked if there was a policy change. Each time, they refunded me and told me that there shouldn’t be a ‘no ice’ charge. Also told me to ask barista to remake my drinks for me if I’m not satisfied. (Which I did and kind of got rejected). 

Anyways, is this just happening in New York? (To clarify, NYC, and Long Island)

Also, I ask for no ice because I prefer room temp-ish drinks. I think the ice really waters the flavor down, and yes, a little more coffee/refresher. ",2,1754947932.0,starbucks,19,0.75,False

I was watching some of Dr. K's videos and there were some thoughts I had that I was really conflicted on.

I watched a video about daydreaming and I understand that self esteem and present focus are really crucial to avoid daydreaming.

But I also saw some videos where he discusses ""accepting who you are."" And for some reason I struggled a bit with completely accepting this advice.

I have these extremely strong desires to be seen as ""successful,"" ""intelligent,"" and kind of just superior to other people. For example, I live in the bay area, so I imagine myself getting a job at one of the big tech companies here and living somewhere like Palo Alto or Cupertino. These places sort of represent my ideals and dreams: Rich, Educated, Clean, Expensive

So I don't want to just ""accept who I am"" because I really do want to achieve my goals. I know there is also an idea about believing yourself to be the person you want to be. So having like a present identity rather than just dreaming about the future. Could I just have this ""identity"" without having the success already?

Now that I'm thinking about it I don't have to big of a problem with my identity of being ""intelligent."" I achieved good grades (at least in the second half of high school), I studied hard, etc. I try to be organized, and create goals for myself. I barely got myself into a top 40 university in California.

So now I'm thinking as I'm writing this that I could focus more on being ""smart"" and ""productive"" in the present moments because I won't have ""success"" until a long time from.

So this was turned into kind of a wild jumble of thoughts and stuff, but It would be really helpful and interesting if y'all could give me some thoughts.

Update:

Another worry I have is that sometimes I focus too much on being ""seen"" as intelligent, productive, etc. That makes me very materialistic and I also feel the need to go out to like a coffee shop or a library to study, rather than just studying at home so I can be seen. I can be very obsessive about test scores and would check constantly check for updates to see if my teacher put in new scores so I could have more validation or proof of my intelligence.

The husband has asked me to go get coffee a few times with him the last few months because he’s been struggling with communication issues. I’ve listened, didn’t interfere and also listened to the wife when her and I went out to do things together. I’ve kept all the conversations as confidential and didn’t pick sides, just did my best to listen and give any suggestions.
Fast forward to last week, went to our coffee meeting and he tells me he’s decided he is going to ask for a divorce. He is unhappy and wants to move on, mentions that he feels a sense of relief since making the decision. I’m sad but sure what to do but listen. He then tells me he isn’t telling the wife for a few weeks because he has things to work out. I mention I don’t understand why and think he should tell her. He says no, he needs time to figure it out.
I go home and I’m a mess, pissed he tells me this because now I feel like I’m in a crappy position. I know no matter what I do, tell my friend the wife or not, I’ll end up killing the relationship. I know the husband will be pissed at me if I tell but I also know she deserves to know. I sit on it for a day, upset, frustrated, mad, sad, all of the above. It’s not a friendship I want to ruin but it didn’t sit well with me.
I called and told the wife, she’s not surprised since he’s been acting jerky for a while. She tells him a few days later that she knows he wants a divorce so of course he’s pissed at me, doesn’t want to talk and says I breached the trust he expected of me.
I explained if the situation were reversed and she told me, I would have done the same. I understand he’s mad, he’s right I did breach the trust but I feel like he put me in a terrible position, and friends shouldn’t do that.
Doubt we will ever be friends again, I think they are going to work things out. Who knows. If that’s what they want I hope they do, but now because I told, our friendship is over. He doesn’t want to be around me and that doesn’t work to be friends with a wife of a guy that hates me.

So if you can answer any questions or gave your valuable advice or things you believe as truths you can say, it means a lot to me

I just lost my dearest puppy who's been the meaning of life, everytime I was in distress she sense it and came to me and I've thanked the universe enough everytime she was with me.

I'm going to say everything i felt in her last days i don't care about religion or science I just want peace so I'd appreciate your words.

On Saturday I put her to sleep on my chest cuz she was so sleepy and she slept for few seconds which she don't usually cuz she likes to be free and i had a traumatic wound and always wondered everytime I see her how this could be real cuz she's everything I wanted i can't believe someone loving me selflessly and i thought on Saturday after yrs of healing 'wow I'm the happiest i really do deserve this joy with my girl' my trauma hit in and remembered me how this could be a sign of something dangerous that you're finally feeling you deserve your dog and it's gonna be gone? So i said 'just because I said i deserve her doesn't mean you have to take her away i will feel more of these moments'

And on that same night, she was suffering to pee but couldn't she struggled on Sunday morning to pee and we took her to the vet since it's Sunday can't take x-ray or remove her urine.she was so weak and can't sit or stand only lay down. We seeked another vet and they said it's not normal she was panting and her tongue was purple they used catheter and her bloated stomach seems normal again. 

She was panting and I'm not religious but was chanting mantra untill midnight, desperately callingevery god , entity, positive energies around the universe and she finally stopped panting and sticking her tongue out to breathe and laid on her side to sleep I was so relaxed and in the morning she actually got up and drank her water I was so relieved cuz i gave her water with syringe cuz she couldn't drink. But she kept vomiting yellow liquid everytime she drink water but she kept on drinking water and walked which seems like a positive sign her bloat is gone, she was aware today morning and wagged her tails was sleeping on her side stopped panting. We took her to the vet for blood test.

The results came out normal. She has no kidney problem this is even more dangerous cuz we can't find the cause. She's usually gets stressed when we go out likes to be left alone and she started panting at the clinic. We went to take x-ray and she was keep on moving places to sleep and wanted to be near me. The x-ray confirmed she has gdv which is a serious life-threatening condition,the vet told us she won't survive tonight and to take her to another city with facilities and we were travelling immediately, i called the doctors, they said doing the surgery is as risky as putting anesthesia on her she might die during the process I was hopeful and thought it's better to try.

She hates travelling she gets anxious but for the past two days me and my dad going to hospital with her and she is very brilliant she already knew something's happening to her. We took her to the beach last year the same month and she got anxious and breathing hard (it's crazy to me how she suffered the same way last year on August like she did this year) this was her first time in the car, i wanted to go travel the world with her when i bought my own car, i always wanted to travel with her in car but never thought this could be like this. I don't know how my baby was holding it she was so strong the panting got worse it's 2.30 hours travel, her tongue became purple and bluish I was only hoping for a miracle. She started going near my dad near the window to breathe and back to my side window I was lifting her head up to help her she was so uncomfortable, her belly was bloated and hard.

She can't even sit at this point which she did anything hour before, my dad holded her to make her comfortable enough to breathe, her body was faced towards me, she was looking at me like she usually do when she's listening carefully, I was cheering her but she holder that face for few seconds which is still vivid in my eyes. She was panting heavily and tongue is out, she strongly put her head down, her body was stretchable like it has no bones i screamed cried it was 15min drive to the clinic,we were near.

We rushed to the vet and they checked her heart beat and told us she's no more. I just did the last ritual to my baby she was sleeping peacefully without any fear or pain.

 My heart and brain can't take it I see her near me i feel her can't sleep that i have to wake up tomorrow without looking at her face or she's Waiting near my bed, laying on the floor after my dad just took her to walk, she acts like she ran a marathon and pant heavily for few minutes untill she sleep. She will wag her tails upon seeing me wakeup, calling her name, run behind me when i brush my teeth, she drinks water from my hand cuz she loves it that way also she be too lazy to drink from the cup. 

I can't imagine my life without sniffing her unique scent. Without her big eyes that looks like she wears natural eye liner blinking at me when I ask her 'do you want biscuit'. I can't imagine walking a single step without seeing her sleeping few inches away from me. Can't imagine coming back to home where she waits at the gate for hours without drinking single drop of water for us to get back soon and can't imagine step inside my house without her already ran inside to signal us to come inside the house fast. I don't know how my hands will make it without lifting her and putting her on my shoulders walking in the terrace looking at the moon, singing her songs. I can't imagine how do I eat any food without letting her know what I'm eating or giving a piece of my food knowing she don't eat it. How do I drink my coffee without giving her my small piece of biscuits dipped in coffee and then pouring a little amount of coffee that she likes as strong as I like. 

How do I study or work without seeing her waiting for me to pet her? How can I move forward without talking to her and she's not tilting her head right to left. What would I do without clicking here pictures every single day? How do I go to sleep without kissing my baby who's half asleep and woke up seeing me come to the room and with the satisfaction I gave her all the love and hoping she felt the kiss i planted on her eyes? Her eyes was open the entire time it's like she's sleeping but i can't accept she don't wake up. Will she come back if i call her name the way she likes?

It's just me grieving my dear baby who I was once scared of, healed my dog fear, healed my pessimistic thoughts, showed me i deserve true love, loved me unconditionally, absolutely hate to see my sad and cry when i was upset she just came to me put her little hands on my shoulder and lifts her tiny legs with the maximum strength, reach out to my face and licks all over my face then sits on my lap. I never felt a love like this, she is everything to me, i really wished she lived ten more years , i wanted to build a huge home with huge garden for her to play around, I'll do that soon so she can come anytime.

Thank you for taking your time and read all this I'm sorry if this raw grief hurts you I'm someone who believe in the universe and not religious but still while holding her on my arms knowing she's gone, I was contemplating the life and existence, what it is that's inside her that's gone? It amazes me is it a light? Or is it just brain stopped giving signals? Does prayer works? Why it didn't worked sometimes? Sin and punishment, what about the pure loving souls who died this young why is it okay? And my uncle said, there's something  misfortune came towards us but my puppy absorbed it and carried it away when she pass she's the god,Is what he said.

Let me start with background, my partner and I have just moved into our new home and I am keen to invest in a home setup, I probably drink 2/3 cups a day and my girlfriend 1/2. I’m a flat white man, whilst my girlfriend loves her cappuccino’s and iced drinks. 

I like the idea of learning how to pour some latte art, trying a variety of beans to hone in on a favourite (and saving some money not having to go to the shop everyday!). My girlfriend certainly leans to ease of use and would be happy with a touch and go over manual set up (although I would try convince her). 

So from what I can gather we are looking at a machine that gives the flexibility to go manual and auto. It is also important as when working from home there may be occasions where a touch and go would be useful. 

I don’t currently see myself going beyond a surface level understanding of a good tasting bean and milk to match. I’ve been mind blown by research I’ve done and the glossary of terms (temperature control and grind size to name a few), so a highly technical set up doesn’t seem right for us. 

A final point, I do like the idea of when family visit (there is a lot on my side) that I could perhaps show off my new found skills, churning out some great tasting coffee at Christmas and other gatherings, so there may be occasions where the ability to churn drinks out would come in handy - this is where the dual boiler debate has been going round my basic brain. 

So there we have it r/espresso hope there is enough above for some helpful guidance, feel free to ask further questions I’ll try my best to answer.

For the last year or two, however, they've been miffed by the ""I Stand With Israel"" stickers spamming their block and Manhattan Ave.   
  
The blue and white ""I Stand With Israel"" stickers suddenly showed up one day and settled on residents' front doors and store windows—without consent. Then they began occupying existing pedestrian signals, bus stops, and traffic/parking signs (often covering times & zone numbers). Not even Emma Chamberlain's coffee billboard was spared, having been colonized by about a dozen stickers.   
  
Neighbors and local business owners independently scraped them off—only to be bombed by Israel stickers again. They've informed the police and called 311/Department of Transportation for grafitti removal. A landlord, who was fed up with scouring the stickers, showed this video to my parents, who in turn demanded I share this with my ""little internet friends."" A bodega owner sent me a photo of the scraped stickers (https://imgur.com/a/7E4P25z). A local barista said he remembers this man used to come around and brag about being a former IDF soldier. A neighborhood kid said she's seen the guy encourage his pitbull to get aggressive around stray cats.    
  
TL;DR If you see the stickers, please take them down as a favor to my elderly parents and the rest of the neighborhood. And keep an eye out for this guy. Or if you know him, tell him to just stop it.

1mnpl6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1mnpl6q/the_engagement_ring_showed_my_friends_true_colors/,The engagement ring showed my friend’s true colors. Now I don’t like her anymore.,"I came with a long post.

For context: my brother, his wife (N), my fiancé, and I are all in our early thirties. N and I were close friends for nearly a decade before the following events. My brother and she have been married for one year now.

The trouble began about two years ago, when my brother was planning to propose to her.

**The Ring Shopping**

My fiancé had proposed to me a few months before that, and I'd said yes. But I didn't want a ring because I find them sexist and materialistic. He agreed.

When my brother decided to propose to his then-girlfriend, he needed help picking out the ring. I offered to take N shopping, pretending to look for rings for myself. I called her, told her I'd changed my mind about not wanting a ring, and asked for her help. She bought it.

We went to a mall with lots of jewelers. At the first shop, the seller measured my finger. He showed me a couple of rings, and I started trying them on and asking for her opinion. After a couple of rings, she started reaching for them before I could and trying them on herself. I thought it was weird because this was supposed to be for me. At least, that's what I told her.

At that first shop, I saw a beautiful ring. It was a quaint flower design with tiny diamonds. She said it ""didn't look like an engagement ring."" and it was ""too small."" Later, she found something she really liked. She praised the design and the stone, the band had a distinct shape, and she said she loved it. She asked for its price. It was much cheaper than the others because, as the seller told us, the stone was a Swarovski crystal, not a diamond. She put the ring down and turned her nose up after learning that.

At the other shops, she kept trying on the rings herself, and at some point, I just let it go. During our shopping trip, she made a few comments that stuck with me:

\- ""A stone should be huge and sparkly so that everyone can see how a diamond ring should be."" (It sounds incredibly shameless in our native language. I don't think I can translate this exactly.)

\- ""A proposal without a ring isn't even real."" (She knew I was engaged without a ring.)

\- (After seeing a gigantic diamond ring) ""Your fiancé can't afford that anyway.""

She claims she knew the shopping trip was for her. I have a problem with that. Let's say she's telling the truth. Why then would she criticize my engagement by calling proposals without rings ""not even real""? Why did she comment on my fiancé's finances? Very rude and uncalled for. Why the hell did she make it so obvious she wanted something expensive? That's embarrassing and entitled and bratty.

Now, let's say she didn't understand and thought we were really shopping for me. Then why did she try on all the rings herself and push her opinions on me instead of actually helping?

The store she liked was an hour away, so my brother drove to another city to buy her the ring. He proposed on her birthday. She said yes. My mom called them the next day, I was visiting her. My brother put the phone on speaker, and we heard N say, ""I was looking at bigger stones, but this one is very elegant too.""

**The Dinner Thing**

Six months ago, we met for dinner: N, my brother, and I. We were all coming from work. The meeting spot was close to my office, so I had time to kill. A colleague invited me to hang out with one of her friends while I waited. This friend parked his car nearby, and we sat inside chatting, drinking coffee and smoking. When N called to say she was almost there, I got out and went to our meeting spot.

My brother was the farthest away, so I had to spend some time alone with N before he arrived. She asked where I'd been, and I told her the exact story. She then asked me who the guy was, insinuating I was having an affair. I wanted to shut it down, so I told her he was just a friend of a friend. She kept accusing me of not telling her anything anymore.

**The Wallet**

One more incident that stings happened just yesterday. My mom, fiancé, N, and my brother were hanging out. Someone asked us to describe our partners by comparing them to an object. For example, I compared my fiancé to Vans or Converse shoes: once you break them in, they feel like they were made for you. My brother compared N to a pillow. My mom compared herself to a salt shaker. It was all very silly and lighthearted, everyone laughed. Until N spoke.

N said my brother was a ""wallet."" Awkward silence.

I said I’d cry if my fiancé said that about me. Then N backpedaled, saying it was a joke and kept asking my brother if he was upset. He didn't respond.

I realize I have a million stories about N. If you like her, I have more material.  
If it matters, I have a great relationship with my little brother. We are close, he knows all about the ring shopping incident. But I do not talk negatively about his wife in front of him or other people. Only my parents, my fiance and a couple of very close friends know how I really feel.",9,1754947244.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,1.0,False
1mnpkfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/1mnpkfk/onlineoffline_tulsa_ok_cst_monfri_after_6pm_sat/,"[Online/Offline] [Tulsa, OK] [CST] [Mon-Fri after 6pm, Sat any time] [Pf2e/5e 2014/CPRED/Shadowrun/World of Darkness/Other] Experienced player LF socially active group. Seriously. No “I’m just here to roll dice, not make friends” groups","
My name’s Ryan, I’m 30, approaching 31. I’ve been playing for about 13 years off and on. I’ve played DnD 3.5-5e, PF1e and PF2e, and Powered by the Apocalypse. Including some small interactions with other systems. Despite being apart of numerous groups, I’ve only finished one campaign. That’s because every group I’ve joined has been incredibly inconsistent. From DMs, and players, screwing me over in unfair ways, to groups suddenly disbanding without warning, people who can’t commit to a set schedule, and then the worst (imo) that I’ve encountered so much and that had caused me leave far more groups than I care to admit: socially inactive groups who don’t care about getting to know their fellow players, their characters, or the story. This is a team/trust building hobby, yet so many people fail to understand that.

My personality: I’m pretty chill about pretty much anything, no boundaries to say. I’m almost always down to chat or watch something or play something. Not much of a PC guy since mine kicked the bucket. So I play mostly on Xbox and anything cross-platform. I am a blunt person, and you can always expect me to be openly honest. I don’t dance around anything, basically. 

My hobbies include making posts searching for groups; one day I hope to actually play in one. Reading books/comics/manga, video games, and gunpla building. I also collect figures. I enjoy running (not marathons), and getting in a good workout. I also really, really love coffee flavored anything. I do have a dark sense of humor, but it doesn’t mean I’m not lighthearted.

My playstyle: I’ve played long enough to fit any role. The Face, the Muscle, the Brains, whatever. I even enjoy the role that seems to put off so many others: the Support.

What I’m looking for: As mentioned in the title I’m looking for a group that is sociable, in and out of the game. If you don’t want to get to know me or my character (or the players), then I don’t want to join your group. I’d like to find a group that takes RP somewhat seriously (I don’t mean you can’t talk ooc, but simply how your character interacts with the world), and enjoys world building. I prefer my fights to have quality over quantity. I hate it when a DM thinks a challenging fight is just adding lots of random encounters. Also, while I’m a fan of homebrew, I’m not a fan of people removing spells because they just don’t like them (example: Silvery Barbs. Seriously, if you can’t plan around a small spell, then what are you even doing). Last thing that I just thought of: I prefer groups that are willing to take risks, which means there needs to be trust. What I mean is splitting the group to accomplish a goal from 2 points, or to accomplish separate goals to make the final objective easier or give it a better outcome. Also, while not required but preferred, a group that is okay with PvP. Our characters are unique individuals, so it would be unfair to assume that they all need to have the same boundaries and goals. It doesn’t mean our characters can’t get past whatever to continue working together, just that they might have to find a compromise (which might mean a fight). If this results in my character’s death, so be it. I’m here to have fun telling a story, and sometimes stories lead to a character’s death. I can only hope that death had an impact on the other characters and the story. 

Yeah, all these things will make it hard to find a group. But I’m sick of joining half-assed groups. I don’t care if it means I never play again, I’m not lowering my standards anymore. If I had more disposable income I would find a group that requires you to pay, but that’s not the case for me.

Anyways, that’s me. Congrats for making it this far. It means you’re taking this seriously. Or maybe you were bored. My discord is zandarii. My profile picture is Kazuma Shrek. If you can’t find me, message me here. I’ll respond within the day.",0,1754947200.0,lfg,0,0.33,False

This has been one of the most stressful nanny jobs I have ever had. I’m currently watching two babies in a nanny share: a toddler and an infant. We take turns hosting, but the parents work from home and are constantly coming out of their offices to interact with their kids, which often makes them cry when they leave

The parents frequently disrupt the routines, making it difficult for me to set boundaries with the toddler. As soon as she cries, the dad comes out of his office to give her a bottle or a treat! Mind you, she’s crying simply because I wouldn’t let her scratch the infant!

The houses are not baby-proof, and there is no designated play area where the kids can be messy and loud without being near the parents. The offices are either in the basement or right next to the living room! I'm constantly dealing with a toddler who hits or scratches me and the baby, and I feel overwhelmed. I can barely eat because I don't get a break; they have different nap schedules, so I have to stand and swallow my food quickly. The moment I sit down to eat, they want to be held and start picking at my food, throwing it on the floor!

The parents don't even offer coffee or a snack! I simply can't imagine having a nanny in my house and not offering her anything!   

One of the houses is a mess, with old food scattered on the floor, the table, and the high chair. I'm constantly cleaning since I have two kids who would eat anything off the floor. I clean the tables, the high chair, and the floor, but when I return the next day, everything is dirty again! I feel like I can never win! I try to take them to the park or the library, but because they’re on two different schedules, it's a challenge; one of them always ends up fussing because it's nap time!

I feel overwhelmed! The constant crying and difficult parents make my job unbearable. And one of the parents kind of treats me as a second-class citizen! I can't even get a 15-minute break, and I'm having nightmares about this job. I just can't do this anymore!",3,1754947130.0,Nanny,1,1.0,False

*‘…Words to memorize, words hypnotize*

*Words make my mouth exercise*

*Words all fail the magic prize*

*Nothing I can say when I'm in your thighs…’* 



[The inclusion of poetical aesthetical ‘vaguary’](https://youtu.be/avv2IIdDnnk?si=cCi7_IwSu5AINcXp), actually allows for the apt summations of what might otherwise be quite difficult things to grasp a hold of. Oh all that you create and all you destroy and all that you eat and all that you spite; and everything; the sun is eclipsed by the moon; [**‘there is no dark side of the moon; matter of fact; its all dark’**](https://youtu.be/bI6nHTXZFXM?si=altFeNIFrOR2Yx2F). 



Hence again, and this is crucial, its deep relevance for oral traditions, which dont die just because someone dies. That transmission [of *philosophical* meaning](https://youtu.be/iU1ywV2BsB8?si=IkTkCB4qfI_k5neY) is inherently caught up in our understandings of mythology; and that isnt a bad thing either. O we have no pasts; we wont reach back; keep with us all through the night; and once it starts; until it ends; there are no endings; [At least not necessarily so](https://youtu.be/EPOIS5taqA8?si=pac_ij71algh0f5X);),; that contains a lot of historical lore and i mean wisdom; it is philosophy, ‘[the love of wisdoms](https://youtu.be/SsmVgoXDq2w?si=AG7NJHZnTGn1OmOO)’ [etymologically speaking](https://youtu.be/nlcIKh6sBtc?si=u4S46WYuvQnCspoJ).



In some ways it entails a deep window into our far more distanced origins; ‘*o’clock already?; i was just in the middle of a dream; o we cant be late or we just wont get paid; these are the days; youd like your beds; to already be made; o if i had an aeroplane i still wouldnt make it on time!; sweet open source secrets;* [*o cause its takes me so long just to figure out what to wear*](https://youtu.be/Bx51eegLTY8?si=OiaTRwZtit6zXMBQ)*;* [*come on honies*](https://youtu.be/j4rIdRC2DMA?si=sxX0bkMFwc_6tKh4)*;* [*go make some new noises!*](https://youtu.be/lcOxhH8N3Bo?si=SF1Wlr1x09zCfI1m).’ [fly like bats ex nihil o’](https://youtu.be/9X_ViIPA-Gc?si=Mz6ud1Dc1VxKY9k6); [thous hades ballrooms dancers!](https://youtu.be/eyolXzOVTfs?si=XCXciJFQlWleMThG)



But the criticism is that the [complexity actually creates](https://youtu.be/q8ZH_v1u-cY?si=6IK06TYvuwUOh90e) a properly compactly efficient transmission capacity in terms of information flow i mean, and [conceptual *delineation*](https://youtu.be/d5XJ2GiR6Bo?si=PA4qyGYbyoZ4L-uh). Hence the point of dropping all necessary logical connectors; with the understanding that those can be; added or removed as required. 



To wit see for relevant instance this lovely lady fig tree; as she [orates on theban plays](https://youtu.be/q8ZH_v1u-cY?si=6IK06TYvuwUOh90e); providing a good example of a quite positive and renown feminine figure of ancient greece; antigone; and shes correct; *who wouldnt love?;* antigone for her daring; smiled upon by persephone; and her husband. 



Im only going to provide brief reply; notice that such tales of great; greek women were common; in discourses faiths and cultural practices; well beyond the reality of most peoples lives; which was of course a bit more mundane on the day to day; tho id caution well to heed nietzsche on this; for the greeks those were quite real; and quite reflective of their conceptualizations of the world; sprung forth; from nature itself; and embodied within; o senseless chorus; antigones frieze; quite beautiful; certainly lovely and brave beyond compare; the living antigone? 



Another excellent example of how meaning is conveyed better through the complexities of languages rather than from a simplex of speech; is this fine fellow who speaks; much on [traditional navajo teachings](https://www.youtube.com/@NavajoTraditionalTeachings); i highly recommend giving his channel; a gander and a goosing!; theyve put out quite a lot of interesting stuff; i also dont want to delve into a criticism here; tho there are criticisms to be had for sure; regarding in particular the insistences upon odd gendered referents; altogether common tho and nothing to be particularly ashamed of; *gender* as such is quite ancient; indeed; *the study of gender*; that is quite new.     



There was a belief that by narrowing down through specificity and simplicity, wed thereby find Truth there waiting for us. My sense tho is that while such endeavors have clearly proved themselves fruitful, they are[ missing much of reality](https://youtu.be/sJRPPUr1yic?si=xW8jjgOffi7HQCMj) exactly due to their reliance upon specificity. Which i think i just and justly described as being the [poetical vagueness inherent with reality ](https://youtu.be/vDHr85LiwUM?si=E01XPg3hoRrNiUg-)and language and concepts; poorly derided by logicians and mathematicians alike as if a linearly infinite eternity; *‘*[*the wild boys are calling*](https://youtu.be/M43wsiNBwmo?si=rEnFhrfJhniIO4yc) *on their way back from the fire; o so reckless and hungered; for theres murder by the roadside; where is all yose angels;); theyre trying to tame us; looks like theyre gonna try again.*’     



Consider philologically in whole; there was the poetical; the epics of poetry via oral traditional lore; including therein the passing down; of wisdoms galore; neither poorly nor wrongly; dosth the philosophers intervene; holding the flames at bay; by way of deep examinations of; the logical connectors between; ‘all this poetical garbage’; how that is are these; oh, essences of meaning; vague as they are; connected to each; sticky stuck like; to each other; o those logical operators; of languages concepts symbologies mathematics and…; o the birds are running in circles; behind the walls of st peters; spray painting; ‘who the hell can see forever’; once mapped out; they lead no where. 



[Meaning surrounds ‘em tho](https://youtu.be/-snFtcjrH3U?si=fXoXRBWN5piv1m5K); poetics surrounds; [between each philosophical concept](https://youtu.be/xby5467EbdU?si=Qp7cVZYDBaRxKxJA); properly delineated; rests a logical operator; [a square c](https://youtu.be/XOEd8mTKWXs?si=2nHygTp_TVz3_B-S); read as there exists a self-similar transformation; between epistemic concept structure ‘a’; and epistemic concept structure ‘c’; thus they be *fractally ordered*; poetics that is; the aesthetic as; the negative space; relative to the logical operators themselves; thus the functional can be construed; as being a stand in for an; undifferentiated predicate logical structure; that pregnability of the concept; is what makes Truth so sticky stuck; all over yon conceptual structures; 



[o mi beautiful honey bunnies](https://youtu.be/DLGl8Oc484Q?si=ANY2X7678W6swm1_). *‘Oh the night yon were born; i swear the moon turned some fiery red; took yall past all those infinities; and when they brought me back; oh, fly thee on o voodoo children.; oh when we make love to yall; in your sleep; love knows you so you gonna feel no more pain. Oh im a million miles away; same time im in your picture frame.’* Whatd i say now?; voodoos children. Who do? You do? Me? I do whom ever it is; ima doing;0; oh lovers arrows made desires; thats why yall think yose a’ losing your minds;     



Presumably adjacent conceptual fractal forms have some kinds of necessary relations between them; tho not all such relations need be necessarily so; consider such the immediate connectivity points; along the queer regions of the adjacent fractals; thus differing additional meanings; even between adjacent fractals; are necessarily contingent; the contingency being exactly the necessarily queer connective aspects thereof; the queer region being the; logical connections between the adjcanet poetical fractal formal structures.



[See also bens point here](https://youtu.be/UD4_CaTufIU?si=-Ct70dx5IinJ9Zlf); regarding fascistic aesthetics; they rely on the lacking of meaning; so that they can thereby insert whatever meaning via shallow aesthetics; conversely the poetics strip the logical connectivities; they are the aesthetics; how they interconnect id assume; occurring along the mythos aesthetical conceptual apparati; as those are; again i assume the earliest sort of manifestations; of the aesthetics; babies breaths so to speak; or perhaps childrens speak; ‘*everything is made beautiful; the obscene; fascistic; becomes normal’.* 



See also the oddity of pronouns that have no real counterpart to the person; pronouns as pur fantastical concepts; [grotesques of our gardens](https://www.amazon.com/Grotesque-Garden-Hud-Hudson/dp/0802878172); a book i highly recommend to folks; especially religious people; thereby would become laudable; see also critically how this does not apply to sexualities; those are naturally beautiful; and thus they are the counter strikers; the fascists again dislike queers especially as we provide connectivity between the fantasticals; we institute Truth and within the epistemic and the ontic; *‘something filled up my heart with nothing; someone told me not cry; now that were older; my hearts; colder; and can, see that its a lie’*; albeit via differing means and modes: queers bridge beauties; *‘children, wake up; hold your mistakes up; o but dont grow up!; our bodies get bigger; but our hearts get torn up*’; and decouples their obsessive mirror vanity; within; without; the mirror vanity thereby helps; folks see themselves; vanity is the confusing of these; whereby the mirror is used; towards the forced re-creation; of some aft childhood beauties eyes; *‘o with your lightening bolts a glowing; you cannot see; where you are going*’; which deceive the deceivers of their own; beauties and aesthetics as they grow up; cracking childhood mirrors.



*‘Know you too are loved; now, go you redefine beauty’*

Everyone's chasing millions of users. Unicorn dreams. Hockey stick growth. Scale, scale, scale.

Meanwhile, I'm over here happy with my 219 users. Actually happy. Not ""coping"" happy. Genuinely excited happy.

Why? Because 100 engaged users beat 10,000 tourists every single time.

I learned this the hard way. My third project got 10,000 visitors in month one. I was ecstatic. This was it! I'd made it!

Month two: 500 visitors.
Month three: 50 visitors.
Month four: Dead.

Those 10,000 visitors? They came, they looked, they left. No connection. No community. No care. Just drive-by traffic that meant nothing.

Now with my new project, I have 219 users. But here's the difference:
- 47 of them log in weekly
- 23 have launched multiple products
- 15 have sent me personal emails
- 8 have recommended it to friends
- 5 have offered to help improve it

These aren't users. They're believers. They're my people. They're the reason I keep building.

You can't get this with 10,000 randoms. You can't build this chasing viral growth. You can't create this by optimizing for vanity metrics.

Small markets are beautiful because:
- You can know every user by name
- You can respond to every email personally
- You can build exactly what they need
- You can iterate based on real feedback
- You can create actual community

My users don't just use my product. They shape it. They're not customers. They're co-creators.

When user #73 suggests a feature, I listen. When user #152 reports a bug, I fix it immediately. When user #201 shares a win, I celebrate with them.

Try doing that with a million users. You can't. You become a statistic to them, and they become statistics to you.

Paul Graham talks about doing things that don't scale. This is what he means. Build relationships, not user counts. Solve real problems for real people, not theoretical problems for theoretical masses.

The riches are in the niches. But not for the reason you think. It's not about less competition or easier SEO. It's about connection. Impact. Meaning.

- Pay more than 10,000 casual users
- Provide better feedback than any survey
- Market better than any ad campaign
- Stick around longer than any growth hack

Starting about 8 months ago, I developed this off balance/vertigo feeling. I don’t know if it was the medicine or something else causing it so I took 14 days off the medication but symptoms were still there. It’s like I am rocking on a boat, and it’s worse as the day goes on (especially afternoon/night). i take a couple days off the medicine every other week too so my doctor doesn’t think it’s the Vyvanse. I also feel like my short term memory has gotten worse (not sure if this is related or not). I’ve ready about anxiety/stress causing these symptoms but I really don’t feel anxious/stressed so don’t think it’s that. I don’t drink more than a cup of coffee a day, I drink tons of water & eat plenty of food. Any thoughts or anyone else experience this? ",1,1754946984.0,VyvanseADHD,0,1.0,False

Everyone's chasing millions of users. Unicorn dreams. Hockey stick growth. Scale, scale, scale.

Meanwhile, I'm over here happy with my 219 users. Actually happy. Not ""coping"" happy. Genuinely excited happy.

Why? Because 100 engaged users beat 10,000 tourists every single time.

I learned this the hard way. My third project got 10,000 visitors in month one. I was ecstatic. This was it! I'd made it!

Month two: 500 visitors.
Month three: 50 visitors.
Month four: Dead.

Those 10,000 visitors? They came, they looked, they left. No connection. No community. No care. Just drive-by traffic that meant nothing.

Now with my new project, I have 219 users. But here's the difference:
- 47 of them log in weekly
- 23 have launched multiple products
- 15 have sent me personal emails
- 8 have recommended it to friends
- 5 have offered to help improve it

These aren't users. They're believers. They're my people. They're the reason I keep building.

You can't get this with 10,000 randoms. You can't build this chasing viral growth. You can't create this by optimizing for vanity metrics.

Small markets are beautiful because:
- You can know every user by name
- You can respond to every email personally
- You can build exactly what they need
- You can iterate based on real feedback
- You can create actual community

My users don't just use my product. They shape it. They're not customers. They're co-creators.

When user #73 suggests a feature, I listen. When user #152 reports a bug, I fix it immediately. When user #201 shares a win, I celebrate with them.

Try doing that with a million users. You can't. You become a statistic to them, and they become statistics to you.

Paul Graham talks about doing things that don't scale. This is what he means. Build relationships, not user counts. Solve real problems for real people, not theoretical problems for theoretical masses.

The riches are in the niches. But not for the reason you think. It's not about less competition or easier SEO. It's about connection. Impact. Meaning.

100 true fans who love what you do will:
- Pay more than 10,000 casual users
- Provide better feedback than any survey
- Market better than any ad campaign
- Stick around longer than any growth hack
- Build something with you, not just consume

I'd rather have 100 users who check my site daily than 100,000 who visited once. Rather have 50 paying customers than 50,000 free users. Rather have 10 evangelists than 10,000 followers.

Deep beats wide. Every time.

Stop trying to boil the ocean. Start heating a coffee cup. Make it the best damn coffee cup experience those 100 people have ever had. They'll tell others. The right others. Your others.

The best businesses aren't the biggest ones. They're the ones where founders and users know each other. Where problems get solved, not surveyed. Where communities get built, not audiences.

Your small market isn't a limitation. It's your laboratory. Your users aren't numbers. They're your partners.

100 true users who need what you build beat 10,000 visitors who were just passing through.

Build for depth, not width. For connection, not collection. For impact, not impressions.

Keep building for the few who care, not the many who don't.

It would be really hard to try and talk to him since it’s a small department, and we don’t really take lunches at the same time and leave at different times. It’s also a pretty fast paced environment and we constantly have to speak to customers and do work. I have a few ideas in mind but don’t know if any would be good:

1. I write him a note and either give it to him directly or leave it by his stuff 
2. I pull him aside to the back and just go for it (but it’ll be very rushed and all of our coworkers would be within earshot)
3. On his last shift I clock out 30 mins after he does, and I ask him to wait for me somehow? 
4. I have his number through work (he knows this) and I somehow text him about it
5. Secret fifth option

I was devastated and in February I learnt that she was with someone else 3 weeks after our break up, that she met just before taking her decision. I hated her and I didn’t want to see her again. 

After 10 months I was like..”ok, I’m better but I never had the opportunity to tell her everything and understand how she could do that”. 
She asked me in march if I wanted to get a coffee but I declined (my anger was too high). 

I decided to break the no contact because I was ok with my feeling but still had this little voice telling me that something is not over. I still love her, I always will. No we won’t be together in this life anymore. But yes I want answers because she basically just left without real explanations. I don’t understand. I need to understand. Even if I don’t agree. Was she a cold heartless liar or is there something more complex ? The answer was really important because my trust and self esteem was very low because of that. 

So I met her. 
It was great. Not gonna lie, lot of emotions and love was still there. I love her. She might still have feelings. But it was necessary to clarify everything and put a real closure on that. I was happy to know that she is not “as happy” with the new guy, that she regrets that she hurted me with her behavior. Without words, we understood that we still love each other but we acknowledged that if we broke up, it was for a good reason (my behavior during our relationship was very immature). 

I DON’T regret this conversation. I am much better because our story was beautiful and the  end was horrible and nasty. And the unresolved questions in my head were just destroying everything even months after. This closure added a “good ending” and I don’t have regrets or untelling things anymore. I told her everything. She told me everything. We acknowledge our faults. I think she regrets, but it is too late now, even if we have something special. I found during our 3 hours conversations this fking feeling of peace and joy that I had with her. 

Anyways, I don’t necessary recommend to do this. But if : 
- you can handle your feelings and not go back to her if she asks 
- have unresolved business 
- you still think about this months after 

Do it. But be honest with yourself. DON’T excpect to go back together. You won’t. It failed for a reason. 
But it will definitely help you for future relations. Understand that no, you were not a piece of shit for her. You mattered even if she didn’t show it (mostly because of ego). Yes feelings are complicated and yes, sometimes lovers are still not compatible. 

Don’t let ego drive you no contact. Do it for yourself and for healing. Once you are mostly healed, if you think you need this final closure, ask for it. Don’t beg. But don’t leave with regrets all your life. If you are here it is because you had something special.

## Key Features analysis

The modern c table boasts a range of features designed to enhance convenience and adaptability.

**Height adjustment:** Many contemporary c tables feature height adjustability, allowing you to customize the table's surface to perfectly match your seating or working position. This is particularly beneficial when using the table as a laptop stand while sitting on the sofa. the height adjustment range typically varies from 20 inches to 30 inches, providing versatility for various users and situations.

The height adjustment mechanism commonly utilizes a lever or knob system that allows for easy raising and lowering of the tabletop. Premium models often incorporate gas-spring mechanisms for smooth and effortless adjustments. Users should consider the weight capacity of the adjustment mechanism to ensure it can support the intended load of laptops, books, or other items.

**Tilt Functionality:** Some advanced c tables incorporate tilt functionality, enabling you to angle the tabletop for improved ergonomics and viewing angles. This feature is particularly useful when reading books or watching videos on a tablet. The tilt angle typically ranges from 0 to 45 degrees, providing customizable viewing options.

The tilt mechanism commonly involves hinges or locking mechanisms that securely hold the tabletop at the desired angle.High-quality models often include non-slip surfaces to prevent items from sliding off the tilted tabletop. Users should evaluate the sturdiness of the tilt mechanism to ensure it can withstand frequent adjustments and prolonged use.

**Material Construction:** The materials used in the construction of a c table significantly impact its durability, stability, and aesthetics. Common materials include steel, wood, and engineered wood products like MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard). Steel frames provide remarkable strength and stability, while wood and MDF offer a warmer and more decorative appearance.

Steel frames are often powder-coated to resist rust and scratches, providing a long-lasting finish. Wood tabletops may be solid wood or veneer over MDF, offering different levels of durability and price points. MDF tabletops are typically laminated with a durable finish to protect against moisture and stains. The choice of materials should align with your desired aesthetic and the intended use of the c table.

**Base Design & Stability:** The base design of a c table is crucial for its stability and ability to slide under sofas or chairs. Common base designs include flat bases, U-shaped bases, and rolling bases. A flat base provides maximum stability, while a U-shaped base allows for easy sliding under furniture. Rolling bases offer greater mobility, allowing you to move the table around the room effortlessly.

Rolling bases typically feature casters with locking mechanisms to prevent unwanted movement. Flat and U-shaped bases should be sufficiently wide and heavy to prevent tipping, especially when the tabletop is loaded with items. the base design should also consider the clearance under your furniture to ensure the c table can slide in and out smoothly.

## Core benefits

C tables provide a multitude of benefits for users looking to maximize space and convenience in their homes.

**Enhanced Convenience:** C tables greatly enhance convenience by providing a readily accessible surface for drinks, snacks, or laptops while relaxing on the sofa or chair.This eliminates the need to reach for a coffee table or work from an uncomfortable position. Its compact size allows it to be easily moved and positioned wherever needed, ensuring essential items are always within reach.

Imagine comfortably watching your favorite show while enjoying a snack and having your drink safely positioned on the c table beside you. Similarly, when working from home, the c table provides an ergonomic surface for your laptop, promoting better posture and reducing strain. The convenience offered by a c table significantly improves the overall comfort and enjoyment of your living space.

**space Optimization:** C tables are designed to optimize space, particularly in smaller apartments or rooms where traditional side tables may occupy too much area. Their slim profile and ability to slide under furniture make them ideal for tight spaces. This allows you to maximize the functionality of your existing furniture without sacrificing valuable floor space.

Instead of a bulky side table that takes up a meaningful portion of your living room,a c table can be neatly tucked away when not in use,freeing up space for other activities. This is particularly beneficial in multi-functional rooms where you need to adapt the layout based on your needs. C tables help maintain a clutter-free and spacious environment.

**Improved Ergonomics:** Many c tables offer adjustable height and tilt features, which contribute to improved ergonomics.This allows users to customize the table's position to promote better posture and reduce strain on their neck, back, and wrists. Proper ergonomics are essential for maintaining comfort and preventing injuries, especially when working or using electronic devices for extended periods.

By adjusting the height and tilt of the c table, you can ensure your monitor is at eye level, reducing neck strain and promoting a more pleasant viewing angle. Similarly, when typing on a laptop, the adjustable height allows you to maintain a proper wrist position, minimizing the risk of carpal tunnel syndrome. This ergonomic support enhances overall well-being and productivity.

## FAQs Section

addressing common consumer questions about c tables.

**What is the ideal height for a c table?**
The ideal height for a c table typically ranges from 24 to 28 inches, but this can vary depending on the height of your sofa or chair. The goal is to position the tabletop at a comfortable level that allows you to easily reach items without straining. When using the c table as a laptop stand,the height should be adjusted so that your elbows are bent at a 90-degree angle and your wrists are straight.

Adjustable height c tables offer the greatest flexibility, allowing you to customize the height to perfectly match your seating position. Consider measuring the height of your sofa or chair to determine the optimal height range for your c table. A general rule of thumb is to choose a c table that is slightly lower than the armrest of your seating.

**are c tables stable enough to hold a laptop or coffee mug?**
Yes, most c tables are designed to be stable enough to hold a laptop, coffee mug, or other small items.However, the stability can vary depending on the base design, material construction, and weight capacity of the table. Look for c tables with a wide and sturdy base to prevent tipping.

Steel frames and solid wood tabletops generally offer greater stability than MDF or lightweight plastic. Check the product specifications for the maximum weight capacity to ensure it can support the intended load. Avoid placing excessively heavy items on the c table, and be mindful of the weight distribution to maintain balance.**What are the key considerations when choosing a c table for a small space?**
When choosing a c table for a small space,prioritize compact size,space-saving design,and versatility. Look for c tables with a slim profile that can easily slide under furniture when not in use. Consider models with rolling bases for greater mobility and adaptability.

Choose a c table with a simple and minimalist design to avoid overwhelming the space. Light colors and transparent materials can help create a feeling of openness. Multi-functional c tables, such as those with built-in storage or adjustable features, can further maximize space utilization.

Why? Because 100 engaged users beat 10,000 tourists every single time.

I learned this the hard way. My third project got 10,000 visitors in month one. I was ecstatic. This was it! I'd made it!

Month two: 500 visitors.
Month three: 50 visitors.
Month four: Dead.

Those 10,000 visitors? They came, they looked, they left. No connection. No community. No care. Just drive-by traffic that meant nothing.

Now with my new project, I have 219 users. But here's the difference:
- 47 of them log in weekly
- 23 have launched multiple products
- 15 have sent me personal emails
- 8 have recommended it to friends
- 5 have offered to help improve it

These aren't users. They're believers. They're my people. They're the reason I keep building.

You can't get this with 10,000 randoms. You can't build this chasing viral growth. You can't create this by optimizing for vanity metrics.

Small markets are beautiful because:
- You can know every user by name
- You can respond to every email personally
- You can build exactly what they need
- You can iterate based on real feedback
- You can create actual community

My users don't just use my product. They shape it. They're not customers. They're co-creators.

When user #73 suggests a feature, I listen. When user #152 reports a bug, I fix it immediately. When user #201 shares a win, I celebrate with them.

Try doing that with a million users. You can't. You become a statistic to them, and they become statistics to you.

However, I find I need a bit more space when I'm going around with my toddler to carry her water bottle and a couple snacks. I also sometimes carry a [Triangle bag](https://www.portlandleathergoods.com/products/triangle-shoulder-bag?variant=39637448327250) by Portland Leather.

My criteria are:

* medium sized
* darker colored brown leather (sort of like the Horse's Coffee-- it's such a great shade for my wardrobe)
* crossbody option
* I prefer not too much structure or stiffness, so it molds to my body somewhat.

Thank you in advance for any help or suggestions!",5,1754946518.0,handbags,6,1.0,False

Pros/cons of each?,"Legit came up with an idea for a food truck after my husband told me what he had for lunch last week and I have run with it. I have owned my own business for over 20 years and he’s been running a business for the last 15 so we’re not new to business. I also opened, ran, and successfully sold a sandwich restaurant after a year for a great profit years ago and am SafeServe the last 18 years. Hubby is a technician from motorcycles to semis so if a truck breaks down, he can fix it. He also has a tundra that can pull a trailer. I’ve already got funding secured, LLC completed (dba under our main name), EIN done, and more. 

He came up with a menu and I made a list of ingredients to see if what he is thinking is feasible. We will be to testing it out with neighbors and finalize the list into a smaller list. My husband favorite thing is to do fried wings because that makes him happy and the neighbors all talk about them when they smell him frying so that will be done on truck. Then we will also be doing different sandwiches and desserts. Also offering slushy’s (hot in the south) and hot drinks (I am a hot cocoa fanatic). I will be speaking with a company about a machine that will take payments itself and dispense coffee, cocoa, and such leaving us free to do other things. 

Only thing holding us back is no truck atm and debating on finding a commercial kitchen to rent, buy a commercial kitchen for now, or do a cottage license since we move into a house this month. I say “for now” as we already have funding and things ready to go for a wedding venue (my dream) but finding land has been a pain. This is years in the future though. Once we have land our commercial kitchen will be there as it has already been designed, drawn, approved, and all and then build the rest of the venue. Then the food truck/trailer will be there for events once eventually opened. So yes there is a long term goal.


Sorry for rambling. Just showing it isn’t a short term goal when debating between a truck or trailer and what size.

     I wasn’t looking for love. Just someone to talk to.

     She found me on Telegram. Her name was Mei. Or maybe it wasn’t.

     She had almond eyes, a soft voice, and a way of saying “darling” that made me forget I was sixty-seven and alone.

     She asked about my dog. I told her his name was Baxter. She remembered.  
     She asked about my wife. I told her Margaret died five years ago. She said she understood grief. I believed her.

     She sent photos. Not the kind you’d expect. A coffee cup. A sunset. Her cat. It felt real.

     She said she was investing in crypto. Said she wanted to build a future—with me. Said I could trust her.

     I told her I didn’t understand crypto. She said that’s why she’d help me.

     I sent her $5,000. She sent me a screenshot. My “account” had grown.  
     I sent her $20,000. She sent me a voice note. She called me “darling.”

As someone who’s used countless coffee makers over the years, I was curious to see if this one would really stand out. Described as a commercial-grade machine but compact enough for smaller office spaces or even home use, its specifications had already piqued my interest. It promised customization, features for ease, and durability—all things I value in brewing equipment.

**Design & Build Quality**

The first thing I noticed about this coffee maker was its sturdy yet space-conscious build. Measuring 12.1"" in depth, 10.3"" in width, and 12.4"" in height, the Keurig K1500 fits seamlessly on countertops without consuming unnecessary space. The matte black finish adds a sleek, modern touch, making it look like it was built for serious coffee lovers. Its weight—12.2 pounds—gives it a solid and durable feel, which made me confident it could withstand regular, heavy use. All of this was paired with a user-friendly interface that felt simple, even on groggy pre-coffee mornings.

**Performance and Quiet Brew Technology**

Brewing with it was smooth from the start. A standout feature is its Quiet Brew Technology, and trust me, it lives up to the claim. There were no loud, spluttering noises to disturb anyone else working or sleeping. For comparison, my old coffee maker sounded like a miniature construction site, so this was a night-and-day difference. The 1.2E+2 Volts (AC) power supply supported fast and efficient brewing, and I noticed no lag in performance even under repeated use.

[Check Keurig K1500 price on Amazon.](https://tastyshow.com/p/b08491k416/)

**Brewing Options & STRONG Button**

One of the biggest selling points here is its customization range. The Keurig K1500 offers four cup sizes—6 oz., 8 oz., 10 oz., and 12 oz.—giving you the perfect amount depending on your caffeine needs. I also loved the STRONG button, which significantly enhances the boldness of the brew. I tested this feature with lighter roasts, and it turned them into a flavorful, robust experience without tasting over-extracted or bitter. Those who love strong coffee but don’t want to overload on pods will appreciate this.

**Water Reservoir Convenience**

The massive 96 oz. water reservoir was a game-changer in my daily routine. Refilling coffee makers used to feel like a chore, but with this, I went days without thinking about water levels. Cleaning it is straightforward, and even after weeks of testing, the reservoir still looked as clear and functional as the first day. This feature alone makes it indispensable in busy households or workplaces.

**Advantages**

- Sleek, compact design that fits countertops effortlessly
- Quiet Brew Technology minimizes noise, ideal for shared spaces
- STRONG button ensures bolder, more intense coffee flavors
- Extra-large water reservoir allows for multiple uses without frequent refills

**Critiques**

- Limited to K-Cup pods, which some users might find restrictive
- Lacks high-end customization features that competitors incorporate
- Slightly bulky for very tight kitchen spaces despite being compact for an office-scale model

**Ease of Use and Cleaning**

No matter how functional a coffee maker is, if cleaning it becomes a nightmare, it’s not worth the hassle. Thankfully, the Keurig K1500 excels here. Its reusable filter and intuitive cleaning indicators saved me a lot of guesswork. The fully automatic operation felt fluid, and every part that needed regular maintenance was easy to remove and replace. Even my tech-illiterate coworker managed it without problems.

**Market Rivals**

Compared to other coffee makers like the Breville Grind Control or the Technivorm Moccamaster, the Keurig stands out for its Quiet Brew Technology and large reservoir capacity. While the Moccamaster might offer a slightly superior taste due to its drip technology, it doesn't have the same automated convenience or pod variety that the Keurig provides. The Breville, on the other hand, is tailored for those who want grinding capabilities, but it doesn’t cater to those seeking quick and easy pod options. The Keurig K1500 strikes a perfect balance between price, flexibility, and performance, making it a strong contender in its segment.

**Cost-Efficiency**

When evaluating the price point of this machine, it feels like you get your money’s worth. While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, its premium features justify the investment. You’re essentially paying for superior build quality, quiet operation, and ease of use. For small businesses or households that rely on a lot of coffee each day, it’s a budget-friendly option in the long run as its durable design reduces replacement costs.

This will be important later on, but my boyfriend is legally able to move out, drive and is legally able to leave home for nights at a time without needing permission. We used to live close and when we did, he had a CURFEW. Yep, you read that right, a curfew when seeing me. This is crazy to me because I was allowed freedom.  The first time I met his mother she gave me what felt like an extremely fake greeting and barely initiated in conversation with me. This has since continued. I would always feel unwelcome in her home. Every time he would have a slight disagreement with her, the punishment would ALWAYS involve not seeing me, as if she was also punishing me. Whenever I would leave, I would barely ever be told goodbye or anything similar.  I have very bad DIAGNOSED social anxiety (which she knows about) and has never tried initiating our conversations to make things easier.

I don't believe myself to be at fault for any of this behaviour, his family have always been kind to me and his sisters and dad (whom she is divorced from) have invited me out places and have gotten to know me very well and make me feel like one of their own. The behaviour escalates when ""punishing"" him, too. A notable example is when I was at his house and he went downstairs and had a small argument with his mum. She said to him: ""get her out of the house NOW"". By the way, she was referring to me (no, she did not use my name nor did she say it nicely). He has also told me about their arguments and how she sometimes humiliates him. One example is when she poured ""warm"" (his words, but I believe he was downplaying it) coffee all over him and covered him head-to-toe  just because she was angered by what he was saying.   This has made me have a terrible view on her. She has never invited me anywhere despite always being out and doing fun things with her family or by herself. 

Now, there's some background information, here's where it begins. I was asked to cat-sit for my sister and do not like being alone in any house. I asked him to come with me and he said he would have to ask his mum. She said no (duh), but he felt very bad for me being alone and lied to her. She eventually found out where he really was and even though he told her it wasn't my fault or my idea, she blamed me. She said I was no longer welcome in her home and said she will never take him to see me. This was the breaking point for me and I was so angry. I decided to vent to my mum about it all. I told her everything about the way she has treated me and she called her a b**** (rude, but who wouldn't be in this situation?). She said a lot more things and I told my boyfriend that I was talking to my mum about his. He insisted to see the messages despite me telling him that they are private and it will be disrespectful. He is now furious, he said I completely disrespected his entire family (I didn't) and that I was disgusting. AITAH?

Mostly canon, with some new characters. 




Lily stared at the ceiling in a daze; the same daze she had walked back to the castle with, climbing its stairs and clambering into her bed, shoes on.
She felt as though her reality was shattering around her.
The last time she felt something this… explosive was the incident by the Lake.
That was a rude wake up call, reminding her of her place in this world. But this…
Was anything she thought she knew even correct?
She slowly pulled herself up to unbuckle her shoes and flopped back down on her mattress again.


James Potter was an animagus. An unregistered Animagus. Which he did at the age of thirteen.
One of the most advanced, tiresome, austere practices known to the wizarding community… achieved by a bunch of thirteen year olds like it’s a piece of cake.
And for what? To make sure his friend had company on the nights of his unavoidable fate.
She felt her stomach lurch and her heart beat frantically. 


“You’re brilliant.” She had whispered, her eyes wide as James reappeared before her in human form.
“It’s all about the fundamentals.” He had said.
He brushed off a twig on his shoulder, and her eyes had followed down his neck to what his top unbuttoned shirt revealed of his chest. She’d felt her stomach clench as he took in his face, eyes tired but shining bright, a mix of hazel and brown, which also had golden flecks in them, she had realised, which you can only notice when he didn’t have on his glasses as he was currently.
“But I have solemnly sworn not to reveal them.” He smiled those wide smiles, which made his eyes crinkle, and a trace of a dimple appear on his left cheek.
“Right,” she breathed.
It’s like she saw him in a completely different light and couldn’t unsee it. 

She wasn’t sure what made him trust her to reveal what surely had to be one of his deepest secrets, considering it was illegal. Perhaps their joint unwavering loyalty and concern for Remus. Who knows.

Feeling a sudden restlessness, she sat herself up and threw off her sweater and shirt, changing into her nightclothes, still deep in thought.
As she was climbing the stairs to the dormitory, she found herself do a last minute turn towards the library. She had filed through pages and pages describing Animagi and their process of being.
3 months.
And then another 3 months.
Technically a little longer for official licensing but since when have the Marauders cared for anything official? She had chuckled to herself, feeling a warmth spread inside her as she thought about how these boys had such a stout sense of friendship and devotion to one another that they had gone to such great lengths for their friend.
The way James had so matter-of-factly said it was for Remus…it had made her feel something she couldn’t quite place.

Coming back to her current question… was anything she had thought about James Potter true?

Of course everyone liked to have a sense of control; she thought she had. She believed she had a decent hold on the wizarding world, the politics, the undercurrent. But this had completely thrown her off again, and now she began to rethink her judgements, her choices.

Sure, Potter had been a thorn to her side for most of her years at Hogwarts, but it was after the incident at the Lake that something had changed in him as well as her.
That incident had broken Lily to her very core, shook the foundations of her very being. If she looked back at it now, she would say she was quite depressed. She came back to sixth year more solemn, and had observed with wary surprise that Potter seemed to have left her alone, as she had hysterically begged him to.

Their interactions were minimal, and after a month, she stopped expecting him to bother her. The months had gone by, he was captaining the Quidditch Team, Lily and her friends had started a campaign to raise awareness on women’s health and their rights. They shared some classes but it had been strictly professional. It was like he was avoiding her.

It was in the year’s first Slug Club that they had a conversation closest to civil, well, for them. 
They treaded the waters carefully during Quidditch practices, where she would stay back for Marlene, or when they’d meet while she and Remus had their biweekly tea meetings.


The treading had a gear shift when she partnered with Sirius Black for Potions. She didn’t know what she felt more nauseated by, this fact or the fact that Snape was in her class, and almost would have been partnered with him if Black had not chosen that very moment to explode toad guts across the room.
She and Sirius Black, to everyone’s (including their own) surprise formed an acquaintance. It hadn’t been intentional, of course. Both parties were adamant on keeping any interaction as minimal as can be.

But one fateful day they both realised their place to sneak off and have a think (and a spliff) was the Astronomy Tower. The first few days had one leaving the place for the other, almost as a moral code, but another fateful day had them sharing the space (and a spliff) and a conversation which made them realise how eerily similar their familial situations were.


Lily saw courage and a sense of sentimentality underneath his cold, alluring abrasiveness, and he found a tenacity and some sort of rebellion in her which despite himself, acknowledged.
Of course, he carried it with a grace that only a Black can manage.

She had noticed his exhaustion and scratches on days after a full moon, Potter nearly dozing off and didn’t take her long to put two and two together. She was good friends with Remus, after all.

She began to spend several nights in the library, poring over endless texts and ledgers, determined to seek what she sought. Almost after a month of minimal sleep, she had handed over the potion to Remus.

“Wolfsbane.” Black had stated matter-of-factly the next day in Potions, “I reckoned it’d take you half the season before you figured it out.”
She had raised her eyebrows and smirked at him, and he had given a single nod with a hint of a smirk in reply.

Sirius Black became considerably warmer, or perhaps, as it’s him, she should say he became less colder with her thereafter. She had picked up from their Astronomy Tower talks (can a couple of words thrown into the cold night air be talks?) that he carried loyalty like a sword and shield.

Black had a sense of charm like no other, and when he lets you in, it was no surprise how anyone got swept off. He was the drama queen of the lot, the entertainer, the belly tickler. If Lily had told her twelve year old self that she would spend several nights playing Wizarding Chess and sharing Every Flavour Beans with Sirius Black, she would’ve drowned herself in the Lake to clear her ears.

She could tell Remus was incredibly happy that the two of them had accepted each other. She had always been quite alright with Peter.
Having Marlene, Dorcas, Alice and Frank as mutuals had her engage in some more polite conversation with James Potter.

All their interactions were within the group. The first reach was done by Potter, when they had had a hearty game of Wizarding Exploding Snap, and had retired for bed. He’d called her back to personally thank her for the Wolfsbane. She had been slightly startled at the blazing look in his eyes. Once again, she could pick up on his loyalty to Remus. 

She was pulled back to the present at that thought, and she turned on her stomach, feeling it clench again. That night, she had no idea their loyalty extended this deeply.

The next day she’d seen Snape loitering around the Restricted Section of the library, holding a book which he’d snapped shut in a hurry. He made a move as though to talk to her, and strode away angrily.

Potter challenged her to an academic combat of sorts, a few days later in Charms. Even though he got on her nerves, she had never stepped back from an opportunity to duel or go up against him in academics. He was talented, sure, but it had mainly been her frustration and spite, and a sense of standing up for her snubbed friend, that made her do so.

Now, having seen a pleasant shift in who her companies were, she acquiesced. And for the first time since a long time, she felt that sense of wanting to be good at something again.
She was an excellent student, but her depression had her feeling drained of any academic pursuit, a feat she hadn’t told anyone but Remus, in a vague way. Potter kept her on her toes, and she found that she enjoyed the challenge again.

The next Slug Club had her sat with Luke Levine, a fellow Ravenclaw. At the end of the party, he’d asked her out to Hogsmeade. She was more than happy to agree. He had caught her eye in Runes, but she’d been too preoccupied with Wolfsbane to do anything about it, or so she told herself.
Luke and Lily began their relationship, which led to some tensions among their group due to his continuous brashness on Gryffindor’s Quidditch team. Lily was happy. She could forget about Snape, the horrors outside, her pending twenty inch Transfiguration essay; everything.
Until it came to a twisted end.

They were having a stroll after supper in the gardens, and the conversation began with Luke angrily commenting on how rude Potter and Black were for insulting the Ravenclaw Chaser. He’d then proceeded to get annoyed when she defended them, stating they are only dedicated to their team as he was to his own. He’d called them pureblood supremists, for which she’d scoffed and pointed out that she wouldn’t say that about them as they were friends with her. He had stopped in surprise, and took him a few seconds to make the (apparently shocking) realisation that she was a Muggleborn.
He refused to believe it for the next few minutes, to the point where Lily got exasperated and frustrated. He had silently looked at her, then abruptly walked away, leaving her alone and confused in the middle of the gardens.

A week of radio silence later, he asked to meet in the courtyard, where he promptly proceeded to break up with her, because she was a Muggleborn, and he was a Half-Blood, and he had to think of his family and protect themselves. He also added that he never would’ve gone ahead to court her if he’d known she was a Muggleborn. He had assumed she was too intelligent to be one.

It crumbled her in new ways. To get rejected by the only true companion you’d considered was one thing, but to actually be insulted twice, one, for her blood status and two for her intelligence, was too much for her. Marlene and Black sent a bludger flying at him the next Quidditch match, and for the first time, to the Marauders’ glee, Lily Evans sought their help to pull one on him.

They loved that she didn’t go easy on him.
She hexed him to continuously secrete an ear wax of the most vulgar smell, and charmed him to say “I’m an ignorant twit.” Every ten minutes.
Peter took one for her in detention, and it was the second time Potter had given her that blazing look again.

The prank did little to heal her heart, though. The girls were of great help, and they spent the next Hogsmeade weekend cheering her up, letting her vent it all out. But to Lily’s dismay, she found pieces of her depressive episode creeping up to her again, and this time, it was here to stay.

She wasn’t allowed to compromise on studies, however. She was secretly thankful to Potter for that, and would never ever tell that to him. She was starting to feel the brunt of it all; losing friendships, losing boyfriends, losing family- just because she was different.

Remus noticed her skittishly picking at her food. Dorcas heard her tossing around, or tiptoeing in late in the night. Alice frowned at the bags under her eyes. Potter noticed her hand quiver for a few seconds during a lesson. Her visits to the Astronomy Tower got more frequent, and more silent. 

It was in true Sirius Black fashion, that he bluntly asked her what was up one day, ignoring the warning looks of the others. It was not that the others didn’t care about her to intervene, but rather they knew she needed her refuge before she reached out to them. 

“The ones that love us never really leave us.” He’d told her, his cool grey eyes boring into her, looking like a mysterious molten metal from the firelight by which she was sat. 

They then nodded at one another, and he’d left. Sirius Black was so much emotion but also wielded it so cleverly; he hit sharp and true to his aim. He was wickedly observant, but somehow understood people and things at its complexity. He was fascinating. 

He had a way of being absolutely comical and then stemming that to cold steel the next second, if need be. 
One thing was for sure; he and Potter were secretly definitely married.
Black was the only one who could calm Potter during his Quidditch tantrums. And Potter knew exactly how to keep him in line.

So much had happened, now that she thought about it. The attacks, the Slug Party hijack, Snape almost getting killed, The Marauders’ fight, them patching up, her introducing Potter to rock, him dealing with his Mum’s passing, more pranks, lots of parties.

And here she was, her final year in the place she could call closest to home, as Head Girl.
The horrors were growing outside, and had definitely begun to seep in. Her muggle world faced its own challenges- feminism movements, all goaded by some of the sexiest songs the rock n roll gods had ever given out.

But somehow being here, the normality of still having to do twenty four inch essays for her professors was oddly soothing to her.

Her counterpart didn’t agree.
James Potter was increasingly frustrated as the days went by as to how the teachers refused to act on any whim without proof, when he felt it was bloody obvious who had been orchestrating the attacks within the castle.
She agreed with him to an extent.

This newfound discovery about him had him on her mind more often than she’d admit to anyone out loud.

They now had their own quarters as Head Boy and Girl; a small but sufficient common room with a sofa, a fireplace, desks, kitchen equipment, and a glorious bathroom fitted with a bath endowed with the most luxurious settings. It was unfortunately a common bathroom, but so far neither of them had faced any issues.  


She’d had her doubts about Dumbledore’s decision to make him Head Boy at first, but over months she’d seen the undeniable command he had.
Quidditch had given him the authority and the strategy. And quite the physique too. He’d grown a couple of inches, and though he still retained his lanky form, there was a litheness to it now, enough for her to see muscles flex beneath his sweater.

She blinked herself out of her reverie. Merlin, she needs to eat more. Her brain’s running low on reserves and isn’t thinking straight.

Potter was quite different to Black. He was clumsier, and more disproportionate; his hair stuck out in all directions, his smile too wide, his glasses continuously sliding down his nose.  Shuffled too much when he danced, was a lightweight drunk, he laughed outrageously loudly. 

But when he was on the pitch? He gets the poise of a gymnast, a ballerina, striking perfect poses with clean, sharp, streamlined planes. The way he had control on his broom…He had skill; it was undeniable. The look of exhilaration when he’d score and the entire stadium would erupt in roars…
She shook herself again. Deciding to take a walk. Clear her head. She had work to do.

NEWTs, assignments, Head Girl duties.

Which reminded her, she needed to discuss about tonight’s patrol with Potter. She wanted to ask him to handle an hour by himself so she could catch up on the last bit of her Runes essay.
Another thing she never fathomed for herself; doing patrols with James Potter as Heads. 

But it was a position he undeniably deserved; she was sure. As a Marauder, he had several tricks up his sleeve; catching people, finding things in places she wouldn’t have thought of. And James Potter may not be stark blunt like Black, but he had a way of commanding respect. When the authority seeps into his voice, you listen. She’d watched him school a couple of second years attempting to steal broomsticks and try to fly each other into the Lake.

It was moments like those, when she felt she really didn’t know him at all; but found herself wanting to. Potter had a warmth to him, and it seemed to emanate from him as a whole. His eyes sparkled, crinkling when he’d laugh, and his booming laugh was infectious; it filled up the room. His hazel brown eyes turned gold in the sunlight. He was always one for expressing with gestures, with actions. He hugged his friends, he’d ruffle the heads of the kids he’d told off last night on patrol, he’d grab Marlene’s hand and spin her around when he saw her in the hallway. He’d always offer a hot chocolate or butterbeer. He’d talk to the house elves for hours into the night, sharing stories and making them laugh.

She’d watch him with the younger pupils, watched how they absolutely adored him. 

She noticed she liked it when he’d roll his school shirt up his sleeves, once again thanking Quidditch for the number it had done on his muscles. She’d sip her coffee and lean against the doorframe, allowing him to address the juniors about being alert, not worrying too much.
Because, she realised, when James Potter said he won’t let anything happen to you, you’d believe him.

She wasn’t an idiot; she knew what was happening. But it was still like rivulets. If she held out her hands there wasn’t much to hold; it was still slipping through her fingers, not allowing her to give it a name or call it anything.

She was curled up on the sofa of their Heads Office, as they both jokingly called it, skimming through parchments for her unfinished essay, when he stumbled in, his hand automatically ruffling his hair as he flopped onto a chair by the table.

He mumbled an incoherent greeting at her and rested his cheek against the table, eyes half closed.
She raised an eyebrow at him. “Rough day, Potter?’
He groaned in response, his glasses lopsided with his position. 

She felt bad for him. He looked really beat. She got up to make him some tea, earning another incoherent response when she asked him the same.
They were in silence for a few minutes, and soon the room was filled with the tea spout shrilling merrily. She sat the steaming pot beside him and sat down on another chair, sipping her own cup, eyeing him.

His eyes were closed. He probably fell asleep. He had a small cut near his eyebrow. It looked fresh. His fingertips were smudged with ink. His frame took up most of the moderately sized round kitchen table. Well, can’t blame the table. No one asked him to fill out into his shoulders like that. Or-

“Quidditch was brutal.” He mumbled, snapping her out of her reverie. Merlin, she was doing this more often than she realised. “Bennington swung the bludger right at me, the sod. And Padfoot did nothing about it because I didn’t let him flirt with Elise Davidson. I ache all over.”
“Elise Davidson is his flavour of the month, I see. I’ll keep that in mind. I’ll also keep in mind to mess with him more subtly. Don’t want to fare like you.” She added, and he chuckled.
“Then a couple of third-years came over, saying they wanted to learn some swerves. And I am never one to refuse budding young talent.”
“Of course.”
“Swung by the hospital wing for Moony, handed him some er, medicine.”
Lily laughed, “Oh was it medicine, really?”
“Water. Hydration is key. Laced with love.” He opened his eyes and gave her a look of mischief, his easy smile making its way on his face.

Stomach clench.

“He was more restless this time. Either the Wolfsbane wasn’t that potent- not , doubting your potioneering ability, Evans-“ he added, “Or it was the Firewhisky from the night before. Or the smokes. Something interferes with its potency in his body.”
“That’s interesting.”
“I wouldn’t say that. Gave me a proper bashing. I passed out next to him in the hospital wing for a few hours. I snuck Wormtail out of Filch’s office, and handed over some essays. If it wasn’t for that bloody bludger…”

He lifted his head momentarily to remove his glasses before he rested it again, and looked at her again.

“You seem to be talking to me quite awfully normal for someone who saw me turn into a stag not too long ago.”
She shrugged, taking another sip of nearly empty cup to appear nonchalant. 
“Well, I have questions but you have sworn you wouldn’t tell.”
He closed his eyes again, a small crook of a smile on his lips, “I’m a man of my word, Evans.”

She placed her empty cup down and noticed his untouched cup was probably cold now. 

He was right. She had literally seen him turn into a stag. And it was a majestic, powerful stag. He’d watched her silently, waiting for her to scream or run. She had gaped, her face lost colour in her shock, but it soon turned to a look of wonder, disbelief and amazement.

She was struck by how much he did for his people in the background, silently. Everyday, he ensured they were taken care of, and also handled his responsibilities. And this was the first time she’d heard him talk about it; and there wasn’t a hint of resentment in his voice. It was a stark contrast to hearing Petunia’s voice drip with disgust about the idea that she had to deal with her during the summers. Even now, when he was this exhausted, he had spoken conversationally.

“Prongs is our rock.” She remembered Remus telling her the day she had handed him the Wolfsbane.

Perhaps it was her recent lack of sleep, or what she didn’t particularly know, but she felt overcome. She felt guilty for thinking him arrogant and selfish. She wondered how safe it must feel to know someone like this. 
Deep in thought, her hands of its own accord, reached out into his hair. It didn’t feel as rough as she had wondered it to be, but it certainly was a mystery as to how decently soft hair couldn’t stay put…
She froze.

Her hand froze in his hair, and her eyes locked onto his, which were now fixed onto hers.
She did her best not to show her panic. She had absolutely no idea why or when she had done that. She’d let her thoughts run away with her.
He looked like her cat did when she’d stroke her belly. He didn’t say a word, but he kept his eyes on her.

This close, Lily could see the gold flecks again. And seeing them made her stomach flip.
It felt like several, several minutes had passed at an aching pace. Neither of them said a word.

He shifted a little, very slowly, his eyes still on her. He angled his chin upwards, placing his hand under his face to support it from the table.
She wasn’t holding too tight, and the movement made her hand slip from his hair to his cheek. His eyes fluttered close for a brief second before focussing on her, this time less lazily, and more with a sense of questioning, a curiosity.

She knew she couldn’t hide the slow blush creeping to her face. She didn’t know what her eyes were showing, if they were being as expressive as his were. The warmth from her blush or perhaps the tea radiated to his cheek through her palm. She felt the muscle clench in his jaw, and willed herself not to think about how she could feel his jawline under the border of her palm. 

She pretended she didn’t know why her stomach was flipping, but she did.
He’d let her hand stay there, and he’d let her hold his face.

It was new territory for the both of them; neither of them uttered a single word. But eventually Lily felt she had to move away before she combusted. 

She hastily but softly uttered a ‘take care, Potter. See you during patrol.” And had left the office, trying not to smack her hand to her face for being such a git.

This started as a “what if” conversation over coffee. *What if* we could make earbuds that felt like a work of art, sounded like a dream, and offered features you’d never expect—all without blending into the sea of plastic tech?

We didn’t have a big team. We didn’t have deep pockets. What we had was a vision—and the stubborn belief that we could turn it into something real.

Months of late nights followed. Prototypes that looked beautiful but didn’t sound right. Others that nailed the sound but lost the magic in design. Every setback made us question if we were aiming too high.

But then came the first pair that worked. The first time we heard music through **The PIN**—our luxury wooden earbuds with built-in AI translation—it felt like a piece of our dream had come to life.

Tomorrow, we launch on Kickstarter. This isn’t just a product to us—it’s years of skills, heart, and persistence condensed into something we can finally share with the world.

Before we hit “Launch,” we’d be so grateful if you could take a quick look at our prelaunch page and share any feedback: [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thepin/1380565137/?ref=14cadc&token=16725463](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thepin/1380565137/?ref=14cadc&token=16725463)

1mnosz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ComedicNosleep/comments/1mnosz9/strange_diner_3/,Strange Diner: 3,"Despite all of my flaws, I still like to think of myself as a somewhat okay human being. 
Which is why I’ve taken up the torch and decided to help Kurt through his issues. 

Ever since we hid Hershel’s decayed corpse, he just hasn’t been the same. 

If I try, I can kind of understand why— it’s not every day you see a dead guy up and vibing— but I’d really thought that he’d be better after his time off. (He just sorta left for a bit, after we found Hershel in the lobby.) 

Maybe it’s not just the Hershel thing. Maybe it’s the long hours and the smells getting to him too. (Or maybe, it’s because we’re over worked and given shit pay.) Either way, the poor guy doesn’t seem to be getting enough sleep. 

He keeps zoning out, and at first it was kinda fun (I was able to get almost all of the pens from the pen cup, plus a few paper clips, into his fro without him so much as twitching!), but after a few too many complaints about charred food from the customers, I had to take him off of grill duty. 

So I’ve started a list of things that have and haven’t made him snap out of it. This is what I’ve tried:

1. A stick— didn’t work. It just sat in front of him on the table he was supposed to be wiping down, and honestly, I don’t think he even noticed it. 

2. Tea— also didn’t work. Same situation as the stick. It just sat on the table in front of him and got cold. 

3. A rock from the parking lot— worked! I tried handing it to him, and he did the thing that people do without realizing when you hand them things. He took it from me, and I think the presence of something in his hand is what snapped him out of it. 

4. A tea bag— I lost the rock, and this was the next best thing. It worked pretty well, and unlike the rock, he held onto it while he cleaned. And he didn’t zone out for a good few hours afterwards. 

And that’s the end of my list so far. I think I’m just gonna keep using the rocks and tea to keep him from zoinking out of reality, but I’m not so sure if it’s a fool proof plan. 

Mrs. Warmly came in and recommended that I give him a bottle of some of the “good stuff” and a cigar, as that was what she used to give her husband whenever he was upset. 

I just gave her what she ordered, and politely informed her that Kurt and I weren’t married, but I’d give it a try. She then payed for her drink and gave me a fist-full of candy , before going on her way. 

The candy tasted like steak, and I ate almost all of them during lunch today. I have no regrets. They were delicious. 

I’ve gotten off topic– other than helping Kurt, I’ve been trying to keep record of the interesting stuff that goes on here. Things can get a bit hectic, and with my squishy little brain, I forget a lot of the stuff that I’d like to tell y’all about. So I’ve been keeping records of it all– mostly on napkins, but  sometimes on receipt paper. 
And it’s been going pretty well, if I say so myself. Because, I’d almost completely forgotten about Skeeter and that group that came in at the ass crack of dawn. But I remembered it when I found my collection of napkins with the records of the events in my pocket!

Skeeter came in first, at around 5:00. 

He’s been doing this for the past few weeks— coming in before the sun comes up, ordering a single cup of black coffee, and badgering us about the local deer population. It’s like a weird little ritual. He does his whole thing and in return, we tell him that we haven’t seen shit and he finishes his coffee and leaves. 

That’s what the owners told us to do via letter too. (It’s their main way of communicating with us. They’re not very big fans of technology, but surprisingly, they’re not Amish.) “We’re not, under any circumstances, allowed to say that we’ve seen *any* deer at, near, or around the diner.” We weren’t really told why, but it didn’t seem like too much of an issue. So we just sorta accepted it as like, a general rule. 

Don’t say shit, and things will (probably) be okay.

But lucky for me, I got to see what happens when someone says shit. 

It was a group of four— one girl and three boys. They came in a few seconds after Skeeter and ordered thirteen sunny side specials and one black coffee. 

That’s when it began.

I thought they were fucking with me, but no. They actually wanted me to make them thirteen. Fucking sunny. Side. Specials. 

I feel I should tell y’all what all the “sunny side special” includes:

Four eggs, two waffles, four sausage patties, a side of grits, and a drink of the customer’s choosing. 

Another thing I feel y’all should know: I was the only one there. (Kurt doesn’t usually work the late shifts, and Hershel wasn’t set to come till 10:30.) I had to make thirteen of those by myself and bring them to the table. 

As annoying as that was, though, I can’t say I blame them. Our shit’s cheap, and they looked to be fresh out of highscool. I know that when *I* was just starting out, cheap places were my vibe. (Hell, that’s part of the reason I got this job!)

I’d just finished placing the last plate down and was about to leave their booth, when one of the boys grabbed my wrist. 

He was the scrawnier one of the group and really gave off the whole “nerd” vibe. That’s not to say he wasn’t serving with it. Cause he definitely made it work— glasses and all. He just looked, and don’t judge me on this, weak. But his grip said otherwise. (Seriously, it could put a fucking python to shame!)

So I was mid way through calculating whether or not I could handle him without anything, when the guy next to him quickly pried his hand off of me. 

“Sorry about that. We hit a deer on the way here, and it upset him a bit. A sensitive guy, this one.” He said with a voice that was as smooth as molasses.

 Like, strait up, he’d’ve made a really good podcast host.  The only problem was that he said all of that with this huge fucked up smile. No one wants to see that many teeth in the media. I’m pretty sure you’d get made fun of for that type of shit. It was like looking at a pissed off chimp with the voice of Morgan Freeman. 

But the poor smooth-voiced bastard, unknowingly, fucked up. You see, at the mere mention of the word “deer,” Skeeter was already out of his seat and making his way over. And before I could give the group my condolences, he was there.

“What was that bout deer?” He asked as he pushed his way past me. 

“Oh, hello there. We were just discussing how we hit one on the way here. Did you also–“ The guy started, but was quickly cut off by Skeeter.

“Where.”

“What?”

Skeeter was laser focused on the group as he asked, “Where was the deer?”

I didn’t quite think it was possible, but as the smooth guy responded, his smile somehow got wider. “Just…up the road… Would you like to see?” And without an ounce of hesitation, Skeeter said, “Yes.”

He then proceeded to get up with the group and follow them out of the diner. 
Not too long afterward, I heard a gun go off. Several times. And five minutes later, Skeeter walked back into the diner, slapped a twenty onto the counter, informed me that he “Almost forgot to pay,” and left. 

Now, I know I probably should’ve called the cops, but I had things to do; tables to wipe and dishes to clean. Plus, they barely touched their food, and I had to deal with all that. And, I mean, we *were* told not to mention deer around Skeeter. So that was, like prophecy or something. It was bound to happen. Why waste time right? And hey, maybe it didn’t actually happen. *Maybe* the forty something hours without sleep are getting to me just a bit. Calling the cops would’ve been a waste of time. So it’s okay. It’s *all* okay.

Anyway!

After I got done cleaning their booth and doing the dishes. It got quiet and we didn’t have any customers for a bit. 
So I got to work on the seven AM temperature checks, counted the change in the register, swept a bit— the usual maintenance stuff. It’s boring work, but it’s kinda nice. Like, I get a chance to shut off my brain and turn on the jukebox and let myself go on autopilot. Just, no thoughts, only do. And when I come back to the drivers seat, everything’s done and I get to enjoy a nice, clean-ish space with some nice music! 

Sometimes I find things when I go on autopilot. Usually I have a little locker in the back that I put it in so that when I snap out of it I can go back and look at all of the little treasures I collected. 

This time, it looks like I wound up finding a crumpled up piece of paper and a lot of notes. Most of the notes were in my chicken scratch handwriting, but the paper wasn’t. It had the words “it’s wearing their skin” written clearly in crayon.

 While I’m pretty sure I wrote the notes, I’m not quite sure where the paper came from, (it’s hard to hold onto memories when I’m like that, so I don’t always know where this shit comes from) but there was a little doodle of a stick person crying a dark liquid next to the message.

 It wasn’t half bad, so I used some tape and stuck it to the door of the mini fridge. Maybe it’ll make whoever did it a little bit happier.

As for the notes, a lot of them were just basic observations. Like:

7:12 – rain started

7:15 – fog getting thick today

7:20 – Wiped down drink machine 

7:26 – Sprayed Tomila, need more Frbreeze

7:31 – Mopped floors and ceiling 

And that was that. When I was done sorting through and throwing away my notes, I completed my little routine and made a fresh batch of coffee.

Then at 8:47, Kurt started his shift, and at 8:49, I went to take the trash out.

I was about three feet from the dumpster, when I got this prickling feeling that something was watching me. 

I took a quick glance at the tree line, and sure enough, there amongst the fog, was a four point buck. It was standing there, staring at me with its weird little eyes.

I thought we got rid of the things for good, but apparently, they’re getting brave again. I’ll have to write the owners another letter and set some more traps, but for now, I’ll just put out some poison. 

At 10:20, Hershel showed up ten minutes early to his shift, absolutely zooted out of his ever loving mind, and out of uniform. His tattoo also wasn’t on his arm anymore. Instead, it was on his hand and the eagle looked more like it was holding two shitty glow sticks instead of cups. You couldn’t even read the words under it. 

Thankfully, he was still able to work the grill and all was okay on that part. 

What wasn’t okay, was that at 12:55, Brennan Stringer came in and sat at the booth next to the jukebox. He ordered some French toast and a cup coffee. 

It sounds tame, but let me tell ya’ll— that guy, is no bueno.

Growing up, there were a ton of rumors. And I know you can’t exactly “listen to rumors” and all that, but trust me, with *this* *guy*, you can. 

Here’s two fun facts about me: 

1. I don’t really know how to eat spaghetti, and

2. I can’t remember a whole lot of my childhood. But what I *can* remember is that at least a few of those “rumors” were true. 

Like the one about him killing Mrs. Larsnich’s pet parakeet. 

I remember sitting there during rest period, Mrs. Larsnich had stepped out for a bit, and Brennan had gotten the bird from its cage in the back of the class. I sat there and *watched* him slowly squeeze it until it stopped moving.

Then there was the one about him putting Corbin Fairwearher in the hospital. I saw that fight happen during recess. (We were only in the second grade, but *man*, he beat the shit out of that kid.)

So when I heard things about Brennan being the last one to leave the boys bathroom after all of the mirrors were “mysteriously” broken or that Brennan was the only one to make it out un-singed when Sheriff Stringer’s house trailer caught fire, I was inclined to believe some stuff. 

The last I’d heard about Brennan was that, after the whole thing with the small forest fire, his dad had sent him off to a boot camp for his senior year. And no one’s seen hide nor hair of the bastard since.

So I had, what I’ve dubbed, my whacking stick close to me the whole time he was in the diner. (I usually keep it under the counter, but it came from a broken chair that I found near the dumpster. I’m pretty sure it was one of the legs that broke off. But it’s easy for me to hold and helps me deal with the more… difficult customers.) 

At 1:00, Hershel’s shift ended, but he didn’t leave until 1:08. This is because he just hung up his apron and sat with Brennan until he finished his meal, then they left together. 

A family of five came it at 1:20, and informed us that there was a man doing “provocative dances” outside. I told her that we’d handle it, but we never did. They headed out shortly afterwards and left two quarters as a tip. 

I went to check the mail at 2:00, but quickly came back inside when I noticed that a person in a clown mask was standing next to the mailbox. I asked Kurt if he could go and deal with them. He just gave me a weird look and said, “sure.” 

5:00 is when Kurt’s shift ends, so at 4:49 I went to get his old uniform so I could give it to him before he left. (I washed our uniforms from a few nights ago, and I kept forgetting to give his back to him.) But when I came back inside, he wasn’t there. 

I was about to just cram it into his locker and call it a day, but I gave a quick look at the parking lot and saw him out by his car. So I hurried out to him, only to find that he 
A. wasn’t alone and B. was *clearly* in the middle of some sort of…deal with Brennan Stringer.
Brennan noticed me first and ended the interaction. He gave Kurt a small pat on the shoulder as he walked away, and I was able to hear as he said, “Pleasure doin business with you.” 

In the meantime, I stood there with the clean uniform in my arms, unsure of just what the Hell I just came up on, and waited for Kurt to take notice. Which, he eventually did. It just took him a minute. 

He looked surprised to see me but took the uniform when I offered it to him. Then he left. And I took a much needed smoke break. 

So, that’s about all I have for now. I’ve gone through all of the records I’ve kept. I’ll let ya’ll know if anything else happens or if I notice anything interesting. Having said that, take care!",1,1754945483.0,ComedicNosleep,0,1.0,False

I am at the end of my rope with Breville customer service, so checking if anyone here has suggestions or has had a similar issue. 

I received a Bambino Plus as a wedding gift in summer 2023, along with a Baratza ESP. Until January 2025, I was pulling normal shots (18 in, \~36 out, about 30-40 seconds) at least twice a day without issue. I use a Crema bottomless portafilter and tamper/distributer, and a 3d-printed WDT. I found that most beans I used (primarily Partners & Counter Culture, medium roasts, roasted recently) worked well somewhere between 12-16 clicks on the Baratza. 

In early 2025, I started noticing that shots ran quicker and quicker, using the same beans I usually did and without changing anything else in my setup. The bottomless portafilter sprayed everywhere, when it had run fine without channeling (once coffee was dialed in) for the past 2 years. 

I also use the Baratza for pourover, but noticed no changes there. The portafilter felt a little loose going in, so I replaced the group head gasket, but tightening that didn’t improve anything. After speaking with Breville customer support, they concluded there was nothing wrong because I could still pull a normal shot (but now at 4 clicks on the Baratza, much finer than I had been grinding previously). 

8 months of decline later, just 1 click on the Baratza is coming out 36 grams in 18 seconds. 12 clicks just came out 98g in 24 seconds, if that gives you an idea of how bad it’s gotten. I also have a 1Zpresso JX Pro, and was able to pull normal shots at what would be around 1.2.0 on that for the past month or so, before that also began running too quickly. (Yes, I have also tried grinding coarser on the JX pro). 

I spoke with customer support again today, and they only kept reiterating that different beans require different grind sizes, freshness impacts grind size, I should use the pressurized basket instead, etc. 

While I don’t have a super deep well of espresso knowledge, I had been pulling good-tasting shots with this machine for a long time before things started declining without any changes to my setup. I clean and descale the machine regularly. I know the Baratza ESP is entry-level, but the fact that I’m experiencing similar issues with the JX pro makes me think that the problem likely lies with the machine. I’m open to ANY suggestions folks have before I resort to upgrading my Breville or grinder (because grinding at less than 1.0.0 on a JX pro multiple times a day is becoming a huge pain in the ass).

I’m a recent CS grad currently living with my uncle and aunt in New Jersey.  
Lately, I’ve been feeling stuck. I’m trying to build products, find a job in tech (AI/startups ideally), and make progress in my career, but nothing seems to be clicking.

A few friends and mentors have suggested that I should move to San Francisco for a short, focused period (about a month) to:

* Immerse myself in the tech/startup environment
* Network with founders, engineers, and recruiters in person (I don't know how I'm going to do that)
* Attend events, hackathons, and meetups (I'm not sure if its useful)
* Work on my product ideas in SF environment

My rough plan is to head to SF in mid-September and stay in a hostel or co-living space to keep costs down. I’d try to split my time between:

* Building – working on my current projects and maybe shipping something small but cool that I can show people
* Networking – coffee chats, events, and just being around like-minded people
* Exploring opportunities – seeing if I can find job leads, potential collaborators, or even early users for my products

I know SF is expensive, and one month isn’t a lot of time, but I’m hoping the density of people and opportunities could make the trip worth it. On the flip side, I’m aware that without a clear plan, I could end up just spending money without much to show for it.

**My questions:**

1. For those who’ve done something similar was it worth it and what made it worth it?
2. Is mid-September a good time to come? (Or else I can hurry and move in August but I'll have to do so with very little planning so idk)
3. Any tips for getting the most out of a short, intentional stay?
4. Are there specific places/events I should focus on for meeting builders/founders in AI and startups?

I’m open to honest feedback, even if it’s “don’t waste your money.” Just trying to sanity-check this before making the leap.

1mnoc29,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1mnoc29/thanks_for_all_the_fish/,Thanks for all the fish.,"I was 3D printing a large object on a large printer. Think 850mm long object. A lot of filament and time. Something happened and emergency stop was pressed by accident. Me to the rescue at 3:50AM. Normally I would just scrap it and be done with it, but it was a multi day print with 4 hours to go. Task is simple. Get the position of the printhead out of the logs. Find the position in the gcode where it was, tell printer that the printhead is at XYZ, cut the gcode, add some startup codes (warm up the nozzle, raise it, purge, continue printing). Here is the catch. Logs report vertical position corrected by height offset (Z offset), source gcode file works with absolute values. Difference? 7mm. 

So I quickly ran some prompts, uploaded some snippets from logs and scripts, asked GPT5 to just basically edit some text. Double checked the result. Wtf is this? That's not a valid command. That idiot added some imagined code. Let's check script paths - again - he added some elements, not existing before. When asked it was sure it's correct and was telling me I'm wrong. Screenshot of the folder tree later and it is still saying he is correct and that subfolder will be created when macro will run. No. It won't. Basically decided to write everything from scratch myself at that point, ran it on my PC, got the prepared gcode. But. I wasn't sure if after emergency stop, printer accepts position in absolute or offset. My guts were telling me - offset. But everything else was saying - absolute. Google said nothing. GPT5 started to convince me it's absolute. Found some examples. Not really exactly my case but after half an hour, 2 Monsters and 2 coffees I somewhat got semi convinced and set the position to absolute. And resumed the print. 

This printer doesn't stop if you put your hand in it. It will break it. But running 7mm deep in plastic at half a meter per second caused the whole 200kg setup to jump and skip the belt. 

Print of course ruined, nozzle and hotend somewhat survived, just bent a little, position probe shattered, cooling setup was left behind . I'll assess further damage when my emotions will cool down and I'll catch some sleep. GPT5 when confronted just said ""Hmm. So you were right. Do you want me to write you corrected script?"" 

I don't usually swear, but I told it to shove some objects in anatomically impossible places and after few minutes went for a walk. Quick post mortem half an hour later provef that this idiot again was insisting the position was absolute and I'm just lying to it. Picture of the printed object and ruined toolhead provoked that imbecile to say it's not possible it was caused by setting the absolute position without offset. 

It's dangerous. It's not accepting user input, it doesn't verify even when asked, it hallucinate solutions. I had perfectly working setup. Now I have a stubborn moron that's useless.

you’ve got a group project and need two people to join.

you know five friends in the class who are smart. not the smartest in the room, but solid.

do you…

* spend hours talking to every single person in the class?
* or pick from the people you already know and trust?

that’s how hiring works.

skills matter. a lot. but trust and familiarity make the decision faster. hiring managers don’t want to gamble on a stranger when they can bet on someone a current employee vouches for.

most people think networking = schmoozing. it’s not. it’s just making sure your name is in the pile before the job closes.

how to run the play:

1. pick 5–10 companies you want to work for.
2. find people who work there in your target role, team, or as the hiring manager. (yes, even if you don’t know them — use linkedin search or alumni networks)
3. send a short, specific connection request:

&#8203;

    hi [name], i’m [role/year] at [school/company] and saw you’re hiring for [role] at [company]. my background is in [relevant skill]. would love to connect and learn more about your work.

1. after they connect, ask for a quick 15–20 min coffee chat. your goal:

* learn about their role/team
* share a 1–2 sentence summary of your experience
* if the vibe is good, ask: “i saw \[company\] is hiring for \[role\]. what advice would you have to help me get an interview?”

1. if they give good advice, follow up with: “would you be open to referring me for it?”

pro tip: track it in a spreadsheet so you’re following up every few months, even when you don’t need anything.

most people never do step 4. that’s why networking feels gross, they only show up when they want something. build the relationship before you need it.",1,1754944363.0,Wonsulting,0,1.0,False

What I'm looking for in a man? A masculine guy who has some dom energy but is still very carrying and gentle. I appreciate romantic acts and attentive qualities. I love men with tough faces but nice smiles. I'm open to relationships but we can talk about what exactly each one of us is looking for.

I live in Brazil but I'm open to long distance chatting and love to travel when I have breaks from college, I speak English fluently and my city is of relatively easy international access, we have direct flights to and from Lisbon, Paris, Buenos Aires, Miami and Orlando, it's also one short flight away from São Paulo which has flights to all over the world. I'm settling into college right now but i expect to move into my own apartment in a month or two, and I'd be glad to host for a little while if we have a strong connection going.

I’m a recent CS grad currently living with my uncle and aunt in New Jersey.  
Lately, I’ve been feeling stuck. I’m trying to build products, find a job in tech (AI/startups ideally), and make progress in my career, but nothing seems to be clicking.

A few friends and mentors have suggested that I should move to San Francisco for a short, focused period (about a month) to:

* Immerse myself in the tech/startup environment
* Network with founders, engineers, and recruiters in person (I don't know how I'm going to do that)
* Attend events, hackathons, and meetups (I'm not sure if its useful)
* Work on my product ideas in SF environment

My rough plan is to head to SF in mid-September and stay in a hostel or co-living space to keep costs down. I’d try to split my time between:

* Building – working on my current projects and maybe shipping something small but cool that I can show people
* Networking – coffee chats, events, and just being around like-minded people
* Exploring opportunities – seeing if I can find job leads, potential collaborators, or even early users for my products

I know SF is expensive, and one month isn’t a lot of time, but I’m hoping the density of people and opportunities could make the trip worth it. On the flip side, I’m aware that without a clear plan, I could end up just spending money without much to show for it.

**My questions:**

1. For those who’ve done something similar was it worth it and what made it worth it?
2. Is mid-September a good time to come? (Or else I can hurry and move in August but I'll have to do so with very little planning so idk)
3. Any tips for getting the most out of a short, intentional stay?
4. Are there specific places/events I should focus on for meeting builders/founders in AI and startups?

I’m open to honest feedback, even if it’s “don’t waste your money.” Just trying to sanity-check this before making the leap.

Thanks in advance.",0,1754944134.0,sanfrancisco,11,0.27,False

The NFFTYUUT 1 Cold Brew Coffee Maker has taken up permanent residence in my kitchen over the past few weeks. As someone who drinks cold brew almost religiously, I was eager to test out this durable glass mason jar-style brewer. With a 64 oz (2 Quart / 1.9 Liter) capacity, a stainless steel filter, and a convenient handle, this seemed like a practical choice for a busy household. Over time, however, some quirks emerged alongside its impressive features.  

**Design That Combines Simplicity with Utility**  

What initially caught my eye was the mason jar-style design. It's not just nostalgia-inducing but genuinely functional. The sturdy and durable glass makes it an elegant addition to my countertop while ensuring longevity. This coffee maker isn’t one of those flimsy brewers that leave you questioning its durability. Weighing in at just under 2.5 pounds, it’s substantial without being cumbersome, and the handle makes pouring ridiculously easy—no awkward tipping required. Plus, it fits neatly in my crowded fridge, which is a huge bonus considering its 10-inch height.  

[Check NFFTYUUT 1 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c2btnzz3/)  

**Ease of Use and Practicality**  

Operating this cold brew maker feels oddly satisfying. The manual process—pouring water through the stainless steel filter and letting time do its magic—makes you appreciate the artistry of cold brewing. The filter’s quality really stands out. Even after multiple washes, it remained intact without deforming or rusting. Its mesh is fine enough to trap coffee grounds, yet it doesn’t clog, ensuring smooth brewing. What’s more, the lid is perfectly snug and leak-proof, allowing me to make other beverages like lemonade or tea without worrying about spills.  

**Advantages**  

- Sturdy glass construction ensures long-lasting performance.  
- Intuitive handle makes it effortless to pour.  
- Stainless steel filter is easy to clean and durable.  

**The Flavor Quotient**  

Flavor quality is arguably the most important aspect of any coffee maker, and this one does not disappoint. I experimented with different grind sizes and brewing times, and every batch turned out smooth and full-bodied. No bitterness, no weird metallic taste—the results were near-perfect every time. Its size also allows me to prepare enough coffee for a couple of busy mornings in one go.  

**Downsides**  

- The glass design, while durable, does make me nervous about accidental drops.  
- Its size, though great for storage, might feel small for larger households or office use.  
- Would have loved an additional silicone seal to secure the lid further.  

**Competing Products**  

Having tested several alternatives like the Takeya Patented Deluxe Cold Brew Maker and the OXO Good Grips Cold Brew Coffee Maker, I can confidently say that the NFFTYUUT Mason Jar brewer holds its own in the competition. Compared to the Takeya, the glass construction feels more premium, although Takeya’s plastic build does cater to those seeking a shatterproof option. While the OXO provides precise measurements and drip-control spouts, it’s bulkier and less fridge-friendly than this one. If you’re looking for a balance between aesthetics and function, this mason jar brewer takes the lead.  

**Worth Every Penny**  

What makes this coffee maker really appealing is its blend of affordability and practicality. While there are fancier cold brew systems out there, this one strikes a sweet spot between price and performance. It won’t break the bank but offers great flavor and a versatile design. Whether you’re using it as a dedicated iced coffee maker or experimenting with homemade fruit drinks, the value it offers is undeniable.

so that's why i thought of maybe instead of outright removing them, we could just simply turn them on or off. some of us like these small, little things in the game. some of us don't. i think removing them is a mistake but i can understand people not wanting them still. so a switch toggle to me sounds like a good compromise.

it can even include more stuffs. maybe this toggle can also remove the necessity to scratch howl's card or shake a shuo's thingy and just instead give us the reward instantly. this also will disable coffee and noodle shop animations and just outright give you the thing you bought. stuffs like these i know people would like to immediately skip, but some of us want them to stay at least.

  
thoughts? i really just miss these small details but the game is really taking them away in favor of faster gameplay, which, as i said, i understand, but they also remove some personality.",0,1754944129.0,ZZZ_Official,1,0.4,False

But as I started to regain the weight I still never stopped the intermittent fasting or one meal a day schedule. So for the last four or five years now I will genuinely eat nothing (including no drinks outside of coffee and water) for most of the day until I finish work. And what started as a planned out structured meal gradually broke down into a routine of just having whatever I want until late into the night. It is what i prefer now and what I’m used to as my standard. 

But I’m finding it even harder to break out of to return to losing weight than it was break from a more normal way of over eating throughout the day. I don’t know how to kick myself into gear now that I can no longer start with something simple like time based restriction and I am finding it nearly impossible to get through work and the boredom of the day without having that end of day free for all to look forward to. 

I have also tried going back to eating three meals a day that are healthy and planned out but it doesn’t stop the urge to binge every night, in fact it actually makes it worse now. 

The more often I eat the more I think about eating which is why time restriction worked so well for me at first because my main issue is that thinking about eating is like this uncontrollable mental tic and when I’m in that state of mind sometimes I’ll eat and not even really notice or register that I’ve done it so without partial fasting I end up consuming more by the end of the day than I do when I eat nothing all day.

My scepticism wasn’t philosophical or religious or smug. It was mathematical. A simple equation: if ghosts existed, Warsaw would be the capital of the afterlife.

Let me explain.

In 1795, we fell under Prussian control after the Third Partition of Poland. Eleven years later, Napoleon rolled in and liberated the place with his soldiers. By 1815, we were annexed by the Russian Empire, and for the next fifteen years, people died by the hundreds fighting to reclaim what we lost, culminating in the failed November Uprising against the Tsar.

After that came the retribution. The rest of the 19th century bled out slowly, thick with secret police and hangings, prisons and funerals. Then came the First World War. Poland clawed back its independence in 1918 only to face the Red Army two years later in the Battle of Warsaw. Five thousand soldiers died just to keep the Bolsheviks out.

Then came Hitler.

Warsaw was bombed into rubble. Nearly 100,000 died in the Jewish Ghetto, and another 90,000 followed them when that ghetto rose up. 200,000 more were killed in the city-wide rebellion one year later, trying to fight off the Nazi hordes with bare hands and salvaged rifles. From 1.3 million souls in 1939, we were reduced to just 165,000 by 1945.

And still, we weren’t done.

After the war, Stalin sent his own executioners. NKVD, black cars, informants. Then he died, but the oppression remained, just dressed in different uniforms. That lasted until 1989.

What I’m saying is: if ghosts were real, Warsaw should be crawling with them. You should hear them screaming in the alleys, see them in your rearview mirror, feel them brushing past on every tram. But you don’t. That’s the thing. With all that blood in the soil, all that pain baked into the bricks, you’d expect something, the tiniest little wave to acknowledge the existence and proximity of an afterlife. I’ve lived in Warsaw my whole life, and I can tell you that the evidence is just as scarce here as it is anywhere else.

So yeah. I never believed in ghosts.

Until I saw one myself.

You see, Mama died last year. Sixty-seven years old, cut down by illness before she got to be old in any way that matters. I could go on about the complicated knot that forms between a mother and her adult daughter, but what’s the point? Either you understand already, or you never will. So I suppose it doesn’t matter much either way.

As her only surviving relative, it fell to me to clear out her belongings and empty her home. My home, too. I had spent the first 23 years of my life there, and had been for countless dinners and birthdays and Christmases after that, for better or for worse. It was my task to file away all those memories and signs of life, all those little things that told the story of the person who had occupied that space. The pages of her life had all been turned, but there was still this back cover to close, and I had put it off for too long.

It’s a weird feeling how your hand remembers a lock.

Even after all these years, my fingers found the right pressure, the slight downward tilt of the wrist, the gentle jiggle that used to drive my mother mad. The key still stuck halfway through the turn, and the deadbolt slid with that same exhausted sigh, like an old man getting out of bed. I stood in the doorway longer than necessary, letting the dust hit me in waves.

The apartment was smaller than I remembered. Or maybe I was just bigger now, older, harder to fit inside the space where I used to play pretend. The hallway walls leaned inward, bloated with time. That patch of water damage near the ceiling was still there, brown and cracked like a dried scab. The place smelled like boiled cabbage and wood polish. I wondered if the upstairs neighbor was still alive.

The parquet floor gave a soft groan under my boots. Every sound felt somehow amplified – the rustling of my coat, the distant hum of the tramlines outside, the brittle snap as I flipped the hallway switch and nothing happened. The bulb was dead. Or maybe the wires had given up, too.

I didn’t bother checking the fuse box. I hadn’t come here to fix anything.

The hallway opened into the living room. It had once been grand in a faded Socialist sort of way, now it was just a room full of stale air and sagging furniture. My mother’s lace curtains hung limp against the gray light, yellowed like old teeth. A framed print of the Black Madonna still watched from above the sofa. I had half expected to see her cigarette ash crusting the tray, her scarlet slippers left by the radiator. But the apartment had been empty for nearly 18 months.

And then, damn it, I saw…

My throat clenched.

There, by the front door, hanging on the coat rack was a child’s jacket.

How had I missed it when I came in?

It was blue, with little silver stars embroidered on the sleeves. Still zipped halfway, hood turned half-inside out. It hung from the hook like it had never left. Like someone had come home yesterday and shrugged it off without thinking.

I went to it and reached out to touch it. The fabric was cool, pliable. I brought my fingers to my nose and smelled iron and mildew, like wet earth or rusted pipe.

The coat was Adam’s. I would have known it anywhere. Mama had insisted on sewing his name into the collar, just in case he got lost in the playground. She used red thread. I remember watching her do it at the kitchen table, tongue between her teeth

But it couldn’t be his. It was impossible.

He had never come back.

I sat down on the old sofa, the one that used to scratch the backs of my thighs in summer.

I had come here to pack things into neat boxes, label them with black marker, get them into storage or to the dump. I told myself I’d start in a minute. But instead, I kept looking at that coat. The little silver stars on the sleeves winked at me in the slanting morning light.

It had been – what? – over twenty years since that spring. Long enough that even the memories of it have gone dog-eared at the corners. Long enough for me to start wondering if I’ve misremembered it entirely.

The official version goes like this: we were playing hide-and-seek. Mama was in the kitchen, boiling pierogi, the smell of fried onions drifting into the living room. I was counting, my face pressed into the wallpaper, eyes shut tight. I called out the numbers in a sing-song, just to irritate him: siedem… osiem… dziewięć… dziesięć… jedenaście… I kept counting past ten. I figured the unpredictability would make for a little excitement.

When I opened my eyes, he was gone.

I remember the quiet first, how it didn’t feel like the right kind of quiet for the game. It was too still, too heavy. I remember calling his name, once, twice, the words disappearing into the air. Then Mama’s voice joining in a few minutes later, sharper, the clatter of a pot lid dropped in the sink.

We searched everywhere. Behind the sofa, under the bed, in the hall closet, even the landing outside. His shoes were still by the door. The police came. They asked me what I’d seen. I said nothing, because I hadn’t. Not exactly.

I’d told them he must have slipped out when I wasn’t looking. I said it the same way for years, whenever anyone asked. At some point, I think I even started believing it. It was easier that way.

I look at the coat again. My throat was dry. The collar was turned just enough for me to see the red thread of his name. I could almost feel Mama’s hand over mine, teaching me to knot it when I was old enough.

I wish I didn’t remember anything else.

Somewhere deeper in the flat, wood creaked. It was the kind of noise that might come from a cooling wall or an old pipe shifting. It was also the kind of noise you hear when someone is walking in the next room.

 

\# # # # #

 

The noise came again that evening.

I’d been lying on the sofa for hours, my coat still on, my boots unlaced but not removed. I hadn’t mean to sleep there, but I couldn’t seem to cross the threshold into the bedroom. The air in there felt wrong somehow.

The flat was dark except for the sodium-orange smear of the streetlamp leaking through the curtains. Somewhere in the walls, a pipe tutted. But under it, faintly, there was a sound with the weight of intent.

Three slow thuds coming from the bedroom.

I told myself it was the neighbor upstairs or next door. Or the wind in the vents. I got up anyway, moving through the hall like I was trespassing in someone else’s house. The bedroom door was ajar. I eased it open with the tips of my fingers.

The smell hits me first. Dust, old fabric, and something faintly sour, like damp wool.

I flicked the switch. The bulb must have gone months ago. The only light is the thin slice from the hall, enough to sketch out the bed, the chest of drawers, the wardrobe. That same wardrobe Mama bought second-hand before I was born, too heavy to move, squatting in the corner like it owned the room.

The thuds came again, louder now. Not in the walls. Not in the ceiling. From inside the wardrobe.

I stood there longer than I should have. My mouth filled with a metallic tang. My scalp prickled. Ridiculously, like a child, I grabbed the nearest chair and wedged it against the wardrobe handles. The metal squealed in protest. I pressed my palms flat against the door. The wood was cold. Colder than the air in the room.

I didn’t sleep much after that. I lay awake on the sofa, listening to the silence, and when the silence deepened, I heard it again:

Knock…

Knock…

Knock.

By morning, I had almost convinced myself that nothing had happened until I walked past the bedroom and saw the chair. It was no longer wedged against the handles. It was standing neatly beside the bed, legs aligned with the rug pattern, as if someone had taken their time putting it back.

I froze in the doorway. My eyes drifted to the wardrobe. The gap between the doors was wider than I remembered. Just wide enough for a hand to slip through.

By the third day, I had stopped opening the bedroom door.

It was easier to pretend the wardrobe wasn’t there if I didn’t have to see it. I kept to the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, triangulating my movements so the bedroom stayed peripheral, a dark mouth I didn’t have to feed with my attention.

It was the little things that changed first. A tea mug I swear I had left in the sink was suddenly back on the counter. The curtains in the living room were drawn tighter than I had left them. A drawer in the kitchen wouldn’t close all the way, like something inside is blocking it, but when I opened it, there was nothing there.

And the toys – they were in the hall when I woke up: a chipped wooden fire truck, two scuffed plastic soldiers, a stuffed dog with one ear missing. All from the bottom of the toy chest Mama never had the heart to throw away. They were arranged in a near-perfect circle on the parquet, each facing inward.

I didn’t touch them right away. I just stood there in my socks, the cold seeping up through the boards.

When I finally bent down to pick them up, I found they were warm in my hands. Not in the way plastic or cloth gets warm from the sun – they had been sitting in shadow all night – but the way something gets warm from being held.

I put them back in the toy chest in the storage room and closed the lid as quickly as I dared.

That night, I hear the knocking again.

In the morning, the toys were back in the hall. Only this time, the congregation had been joined by a single small, blue knitted mitten.

It was the same blue as the coat, the same worn yarn Mama used to repair year after year because Adam would lose the other one and swear the wind took it.

I put it on the kitchen table, then went about making coffee, refusing to glance in its direction. But the more I ignored it, the more it imposed itself in the corner of my vision, patient as a fishing float waiting for a bite.

Halfway through my second cup, I hear a faint sound. It was gentle, a four-note rise, a pause, then a quick drop at the end.

Coming from the bedroom, muffled by the closed door.

I knew the tune by heart, it was one Mama used to hum while sewing, her lips barely moving, her foot keeping time on the pedal of the old machine.

It loosened a memory buried deep, the way a frost break lets water seep through stone.

A spring afternoon came back to me in vibrant colors. The dusty pink pavement, a scrawl of yellow suns and crooked hopscotch squares. Me and Adam crouched in the courtyard with our chalks, the air warm enough to smell the flowers in the ground-floor window display.

He was chattering, as always, inventing rules to a game I’d already lost interest in. I’d been watching the older girls at school that week, how they bossed their brothers around, how their brothers obeyed without question, and I felt a sharp itch to prove I could do it too. To be in charge. To see him obey. I was the older sibling, there could be nothing more natural in the world.

So I told him to hide somewhere I’d never find him. Told him the wardrobe in the bedroom would be perfect. When he hesitated, I took the easy way out, calling him a coward, said he was scared of the dark. He puffed up like a pigeon and ran inside without looking back.

I saw it then, like a reflection in a pool coming into focus if you just let the ripples dissipate. I saw the way he shuffled inside, giggling nervously. I saw myself swinging the wardrobe door shut. I saw my hand turning the key in the lock.

My hands gripped the table edge so hard my knuckles ached.

That couldn’t be right. That wasn’t not how it happened. I had told the police – what had I told them? That he’d slipped out. That was what I’ve always said. I could hear myself saying it, clear as if I were in the interview room again.

But the lock. I remembered the lock and the way the door rattled after, once, twice, before it went still.

That night, I dreamed of knocking. Not from inside the wardrobe, but from behind the sofa, from the ceiling above my head, from the hollow in my chest.

I had followed him slowly enough to make him think I wasn’t hurrying, slowly enough to make him think he was winning.

He was already inside when I reached the bedroom, knees drawn up, grinning in that lopsided way he had when he thought he was being clever. The wardrobe smelled faintly of mothballs and the camphor Mama kept in jam jars to keep the silverfish out. I remember the way the dust floated in the sliver of light, how he blinked against it.

“Ready?” I asked.

He nodded.

I swung the door shut, meaning to let it hang loose so the game would be fair. Then I had the diabolical idea of giving him a really good scare. I would shut him in, just for a while, just enough so he wouldn’t forget who was in charge. I didn’t mean any harm.

The lock turned with a sound like a tongue clicking against teeth.

There was a muffled laugh from inside, then a shuffle, the thump of his small shoes against the wood. I pressed my ear to the door, grinning, listening to the sound of him discovering there was no handle on the inside.

He knocked once. Twice. Three times.

I didn’t answer. I just stood there, arms folded, waiting for him to crack and cry out and admit, *Fine, you win, I’m scared*.

Again, three knocks. Louder this time, with a hollow edge that made my smile fade. Guilt began to prick at me. His nerve would break soon. And he was my little brother, after all.

I reached for the key.

The wardrobe lurched as if something inside had heaved against it. It lifted clear off the floor, and thudded down hard. Through the shock of the moment the blood rushed to my ears, crashing against the eardrums like waves on a beach. Before long, it became the sound of a long, steady motion, like a heavy thing sliding over a smooth surface, retreating into a space far bigger than the wardrobe could ever hold. The noise thinned, faded, until there was only silence and a wardrobe suddenly devoid of what had been there only moments before.

I had told the police I didn’t see where he went. I had told Mama I thought he’d run outside. I had told myself that must have been what had happened.

Because the truth wasn’t survivable. If I accepted what I’d really seen, I’d have to live in a world where things like that could happen, where children could disappear into dark, impossible corners and never come back.

But now I was hearing it again, as if it had never stopped – the faint scrape of his shoe against the wardrobe’s floor, the shallow, quickening breath. All flowing through the tiny little keyhole in the wardrobe door.

The room was darker than it should have been.

I hadn’t turned on a light, but I knew the afternoon sun was still somewhere out there in the city, behind the curtains.

I was still standing in the hallway, staring at the bedroom door. I could have left. I could have walked out of that apartment and never set foot there again. Sold it, burned it, let the city swallow it whole.

Knock…

Knock…

Knock.

It started faintly, as if it had been going on for hours and I was only just noticing. Three soft knocks, evenly spaced, like a code tapped by someone who doesn’t mind waiting for the reply.

The memory was still fresh in my head. Adam’s laugh muffled by wood. The lock clicking shut. The silence that came after.

I went into the bedroom.

The air changed immediately. It was colder, yes, but not the kind of cold that comes from bad insulation. It was the coldness of a cellar, or of stone that’s never seen sunlight. I smelled the age, and under it, something sharper like damp cloth or stale breath.

The wardrobe was in its corner, massive, immovable, its varnish dulled to a muddy brown. A thin strip of shadow marked the seam between its doors.

I didn’t move at first. My eyes were watering for lack of blinking. I listened carefully.

Knock…

Knock…

Knock.

My hand moved before my mind could ever agree to it. I curled my fingers around the handle.

The wood was cold enough to sting.

I told myself I’d just open it a crack. Just enough to prove there was nothing there.

The metal squealed as the latch slipped free.

The knock stopped.

In the silence, I heard slow, patient breathing.

The doors opened more easily than they should have. I had half expected them to stick, to make me tug and wrestle with the hinges, to give me one last chance to stop. But they parted in a slow, smooth arc, like lips in a knowing smile.

The darkness inside wasn’t complete. The streetlamp outside cast a faint amber glow through the bedroom window, just enough to spread a haze across the back wall. It showed the paneling, the warped floorboards, the cedar blocks Mama had sworn kept moths away, and another shape.

It was small, curled into the farthest corner, knees pulled tight, head bent so low his chin almost touches his chest.

“Adam,” I said before I could stop the breath rushing out my throat. The name felt alien.

He stirred, lifting his head. His face was blurred at the edges, as if the faint light couldn’t quite decide where to pick out the shadows. The skin had the pallor of something soaked too long in cold water; the lips were tinged blue. His eyes were darker than they should have been, shining like wet stones.

“You found me.” The voice was faint, muffled, and I didn’t know if I heard it with my ears or if it just inserted itself into my skull.

I took a step forward. The air thickened as if trying to rebuke me. My hand trembled as I reached for him.

The sleeve of his coat was slick against my fingers, not from rain, but from the kind of damp that seeps from beneath the earth. The smell that rose with it was a mix of rust, soil, and something faintly rotting.

He blinked slowly, almost in time with the sound of my own heartbeat.

“I waited all this time,” he said. His lips barely moved. “You said you’d find me.”

The words come again, faster this time. “I waited. I waited. I waited.” Each repetition grew thinner, higher, as though stretched taut. His body rocked with the rhythm, and somewhere inside me, something gave way like a trap snapping shut.

The wardrobe felt farther away now, though I hadn’t taken a single step. The air was colder, my breath coming in white strands that dissolved before they reached him.

“You found me,” Adam whispered.

The floor tilted. That’s the only way I can describe it – as if the wardrobe wasn’t part of the apartment anymore, as if gravity had decided its loyalties lay elsewhere. My balance shifted toward him and the darkness that swaddled him like a cloak.

I tried to turn, to grab the doorframe, but my arms were too heavy. My fingertips scraped over wood. The scent was stronger now – damp cloth, cold stone, and that faint, metallic taste I knew all too well.

Adam didn’t move toward me. Instead, the space between us folded in on itself like a closing accordion, and suddenly I was kneeling in front of him. My knees sank into something soft and cold that might be fabric, might be earth. The glow from the streetlamp no longer reached us.

“Now it’s your turn,” he said with the gravity of an unavoidable invitation.

He took my hand. His palm was smaller than I remembered, his grip steady and final. The cold bled into me, up my arm, across my chest, slowing my heart to a patient, measured thud. For the first time in years, I stopped resisting.

When I blinked, he had gone.

I used to say I didn’t believe in ghosts. Warsaw had more reason than most cities to be full of them, but mainstream science was still shaking its head on the subject. I used to think the absence of proof was proof enough. But now the proof is all I have, and whenever I find a quiet moment it echoes in my mind with the patient cadence of Adam’s little voice:

She'll go through an entire day (or three) where everything is wrong, everything is a catastrophe, she feels absolutely positively terrible about everything, and as a result projects it all onto me. It's so exhausting and debilitating and typically augmented by her substance abuse (of which kinds there are several).

Now, if I'm being honest with you folks, I typically partake at least in the drinking aspect, though I stay coherent and on my toes enough to be infuriated when she starts a massive fight about some triviality and then ultimately drinks/smokes/xanaxes herself to sleep, so that I'm left awake with my thoughts and anger, somewhat inebriated and completely full of adrenaline, frustrated, and obviously unable to find any resolution with her now-unconscious self.

But in the morning, she wakes up before me (easy to do since she typically medicates herself silly as early as 8-9pm) and makes coffee, goes through her morning routine, and the next time I see her....she acts like nothing ever happened. Like there was no fight, there was no verbal discourse, like there wasn't an issue.

It happened yesterday - we both had a rare day off without responsibilities. Although we didn't have grand plans or anything, we definitely wanted to spend time together. What it became was her basically rolling around in bed drunk and high, giving me shit for ""not doing enough"" in the relationship and ""not being committed enough"" until she finally passed out.

This morning: ""Hey babe, good morning - what's your day like?""

I guess my question to you fine folks is: do they ever just....stop the crazy suddenly, as if they can just turn it off for a moment? It's almost more jarring than waking up with mutual animosity, it makes you feel like you're taking crazy pills, or that ***you're*** the one being unreasonable.",3,1754943904.0,BPDlovedones,2,0.81,False

When it comes to Bitcoin, there’s an old piece of advice that’s just as important as “buy low, HODL high”: **never tell anyone how much Bitcoin you have.** Seriously—if your best friend, your barber, and your cousin’s dog all know your BTC balance, you’re doing it wrong.

Let’s face it, Bitcoin is digital gold. And just like you wouldn’t walk down the street yelling, “Hey everyone! I’ve got 10 gold bars under my bed!” you shouldn’t be casually sharing your Bitcoin stash with strangers… or even acquaintances.

**Why Keep Your Bitcoin Balance a Secret?**

For starters, humans are curious creatures. Once people know you hold a lot of BTC, some will suddenly develop a deep interest in your “investment strategy” (translation: they’ll keep asking how much you’ve got and how much it’s worth now). Others might get jealous. And in the worst-case scenario—well, let’s just say there are people out there who *really* like other people’s crypto.

Hackers, scammers, and even nosy relatives might start sniffing around the moment they think you’ve got more Bitcoin than you can fit in a USB stick. Keeping your holdings private is like having an invisible forcefield around your digital treasure chest.

**The “Flexing” Problem**

Sure, it might feel good to casually mention at a party that you bought Bitcoin in 2013 for the price of a latte and now it’s worth more than a small yacht. But here’s the problem: the more you flex, the more you attract unwanted attention. If you truly want to be the coolest person in the room, drop subtle hints about your crypto savvy—without ever revealing your wallet’s weight.

Remember, real Bitcoin pros don’t brag. They secure their private keys, avoid phishing emails, and quietly check their portfolio while sipping coffee in peace.

**The Smart Way to Share Bitcoin**

Now, just because you shouldn’t reveal your BTC balance doesn’t mean you can’t send or receive Bitcoin with ease. That’s where tools like our **Bitcoin QR Code Maker** come in. With it, you can create a Bitcoin payment QR code in seconds—no need to hand over your wallet address in a clumsy text message.

Want to get paid in Bitcoin for your freelance work, sell an old guitar, or split a dinner bill? Just generate a QR code at [https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com), share the image, and boom—secure, simple transactions without giving away anything more than you need to.

**Bottom Line:**

In the crypto world, privacy isn’t just nice—it’s essential. Keep your BTC holdings to yourself, guard your private keys, and when you do need to receive payments, use tools that protect your identity and security.

Because at the end of the day, Bitcoin is like treasure—and the first rule of treasure is simple: **don’t tell the world how much you’ve got, or you might wake up to find a bunch of pirates at your door.**",1,1754943801.0,u_SelectionOptimal7348,0,1.0,False

I’ve been testing **Prime Opinion**, and it’s been decent for “waiting-for-the-kettle” money. Yesterday I did two short surveys while my pasta was boiling and hit the minimum to try a tiny payout later that evening. Nothing life-changing, just a nice little “coffee/commute” top-up.

**What it is (in plain English)**

* Survey app/site. You answer profiling Qs, then pick surveys.
* Payouts include **cash (PayPal/bank)** and **gift cards**. I used PayPal and it landed quickly.
* **No credit check.** I wasn’t asked for ID. Some folks mention a **phone/SMS check** after a few surveys — I got a basic phone prompt once.
* No deposits or fees from the site in my case (just the usual PayPal stuff if currency converts).

**Steps I took:**

1. **Sign up on the page** and confirm email.
2. **Finish the profile** (those “what brands you use / age / etc.” bits). This unlocks better-matched surveys.
3. **Do the short ones first** (time estimate is shown). If you get screened out, you usually still get a small bit credited.
4. **Cash out once you hit the minimum.** I prefer cashing out early rather than letting a balance sit.
5. Optional: enable app notifications if you want pings for new surveys (I keep mine off and just check when I’ve got downtime).

**My mini-tips**

* Don’t rage-quit if you get screened a couple times; it evens out after the profile settles.
* If a survey looks weirdly long for the reward, skip it. There are loads; pick your battles.
* Keep your profile consistent — changing answers kills your qualify rate.

* Crypto note: not a crypto thing; just standard surveys.

As someone who drinks coffee religiously and enjoys experimenting with different brewing methods, I was thrilled to try out this stainless steel percolator. This beauty doesn’t just sit on your counter; it demands attention. With its sleek and traditional design, it promises both aesthetics and functionality, and I’ve got plenty to say about how it delivers—or doesn’t—in practice.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that grabbed my attention was the stainless steel housing. It has a polished, professional appearance that makes it a good fit for nearly any kitchen setting. What I appreciate most is how sturdy the build feels. It’s not flimsy or cheap, but solid and thoughtfully constructed. The ergonomic handle, complete with a knuckle guard, ensures it’s easy and safe to hold, especially when you’ve got a full 12 cups of coffee brewing. The transparent knob located on the lid is a nostalgic touch, letting you witness the brewing magic unfold. I do wish, however, that the lid's locking mechanism were a bit more robust. Occasionally, it feels slightly loose when lifting it mid-brew.

**Ease of Use**  
I found the simplicity of its operation to be one of its best traits. This percolator doesn’t come with complex buttons or advanced technology, just a manual operation mode that focuses on the essentials. Measuring out coffee grounds using the removable stainless steel basket is intuitive, thanks to the measurement markings. The reusable filter design means no need for single-use paper filters, and that feels like a win—for both the environment and my wallet. However, first-time users might need a little trial and error to avoid brewing coffee that ends up too strong or weak.

**Performance and Brew Quality**  
This percolator consistently delivers coffee that is smooth and aromatic, and the 12-cup capacity is perfect for a gathering or just someone like me who drinks way too much coffee in a day. I tested it with a medium grind, and the results were balanced and rich. Thanks to the precision no-drip spout, pouring is easy and spill-free. That said, I found the brewing process takes a little longer than what you’d expect from a more modern drip coffee maker, which might not appeal to those who are short on time in the mornings.

**Advantages**  
- Precision no-drip spout makes pouring effortless.  
- Durable stainless steel design exudes quality and elegance.  
- Transparent knob lets you keep a visual check on brewing progress.  

[Check Cuisinart PRC-12N price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0b6ln174x/)  

**Potential Shortcomings**  
It’s not without a few quirks that may bother some users.  

- The lid sometimes feels insecure while brewing.  
- Brew time is a bit slower compared to modern electric coffee makers.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing the PRC-12N with some other electric percolators and drip coffee machines, like the Presto 12-Cup Stainless Steel Coffee Maker, reveals some critical insights. While the Presto model brews slightly faster and offers similarly sturdy construction, it lacks some of the PRC-12N's charming aesthetics, like the transparent knob. On the other hand, standard drip coffee machines, such as the Hamilton Beach 2-Way Brewer, prioritize versatility with features like programmed brewing but sacrifice the nostalgic brewing experience that comes from a percolator. The PRC-12N is ideal for those who favor tradition without compromising modern convenience.

**Value for Money**  
Given its premium build and solid coffee-making performance, the PRC-12N provides good value for its price range. I wouldn’t call it a budget-friendly option, but for those prioritizing durability and the classic coffee-making process, it justifies the cost. If long-term use and quality materials are what you’re after, this percolator is a worthwhile investment.

Bonnie (our resident Enkidu pilot, tracking down her past after awakening centuries after Hercynia), Alonzo (piloting a pegasus alongside a number of NHPs, here to delve into the esoteric), Raoul (the team leader who has a knack for recruiting enemies and ended up with a very sizeable PMC by the end. His coffee is thanks to Joe, a 'borrowed' HA coffee machine) and Ruckus (with his compcon buddy chappie on his shoulder, the only truly sensible member of the squad).

In the background is what's left of the Arminius, the Karrakan flagship that acted as their headquarters in their invasion. After the players hit it with a paracausal machine virus and accidentally created a ship sized entity, they hit it with a nuke to be sure. As their penultimate mission they had to brave the hellscape of their own creation to track down the Karrakan leader.
