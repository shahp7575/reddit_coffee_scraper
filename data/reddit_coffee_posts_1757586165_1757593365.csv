1ne7aqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeensofKerala/comments/1ne7aqx/no_interest_in_going_to_college/,No interest in going to college,"I’m in my second year of college. So, today was my first day back after the Onam holidays (we had leave until Tuesday), and while I was on the bus, I kept thinking about skipping college. Guess what? I stopped at the bus stop, had a coffee from the shop, and went back home 😂🙂.

The thing is, it’s hard to make friends. Yes, I have some people I can hang out with, but they don’t really check on me or care if I’m absent, unlike the friends I had in plus two. Back then, we used to go to class together, and they would even video call me if I took a leave. But college feels like a totally different story.I wanna enjoy my clg man 🥲

What should I do? Is there anyone facing the same?helppp",1,1757593170.0,TeensofKerala,2,1.0,False

My best friend and the only person in the same city as me is out of town, so I don’t want to bed rot this Sunday. 

My interests are- rock/indie music, good coffee, a bit of politics and poetry. Probably let’s catch up for coffee or go for arcade. 

Maybe, just maybe, if someone from opposite sex is open for more than friendship, I’m open for it too.

So I was reading something that said how you furnish an investment property can change how much rent you get and even the type of tenants you attract. Like apparently if you pick cheap or flashy stuff it might backfire, but if you pick durable, neutral stuff it can boost your returns.
I always thought tenants just care about location and price, not the couch or the bed. Is furnishing really that important for an investment property, or am I overthinking it?

1ne75h5,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1ne75h5/two_years/,Two years.,"I drank heavily for over 20 years, almost daily. I did most of the high-risk things that can seriously ruin your life: drinking before, during, and after work. Drinking and driving. Pre-gaming almost every social event I went to. Hiding liquor and beer all over the house. Sneaking and lying. Always a tiny step ahead of when it would all come crashing down.

A typical day would look like this: I'd wake up early and sneak down to my 'man cave' in the basement before my wife woke up. Between 5:30 and 7:30 am, I'd have a bottle of wine, or four or five shots of liquor with my morning coffee. Smuggle out the empties, get ready for work, and yes, drive there like an imbecile. Work until midday, and head to a local restaurant/bar to have a couple of 22oz craft beers with my lunch. Head back to work and muddle through the rest of the day with a buzz; maybe even slip out late in the day for another one or two beers at a different watering hole. Leave work, hit the liquor store, rush home to hide those bottles around the house before my wife got home. (Yeah, and take another shot; why not?) Then maybe ask her if she wanted to go out for margaritas or stay home and open a bottle of wine. Watch some TV that I know I won't remember, and lie awake with night sweats and anxiety until I can get up and do it all again.

It's not a good life. I knew one day it was going to all blow up in my face: a second DUI; wrecking my finances with fines and fees at the same time as I get fired from my job; spending a month in jail; losing my license for a year; having my wife finally getting fed up for the very last time and leaving. I was one bad day away from all of that happening, ALL of it, at the same time. The feeling of the sword of Damocles hanging above my head was so real.

I'd tried to quit drinking a thousand times, of course, but couldn't do it. Willpower doesn't work. Religion doesn't work. Wanting to be a good husband and good person doesn't work. Even wanting to avoid imminent disaster, and having countless close calls, wasn't working.

I finally succeeded by experiencing a total mental 180 in the way I viewed alcohol. I educated myself on it and began to see it for what it truly was. The SoberClear Stop Drinking podcast with Leon Sylvester was instrumental, as was this sub. In a nutshell, I fully demonized alcohol in my brain and turned it into the equivalent of drinking a tall glass of bleach first thing in the morning. And that's what finally worked. I broke the mindset of 'giving up alcohol' because that implied I was missing out on something I wanted to do. This was a new approach I had never tried, and it worked: learning exactly what alcohol is and does. It's not a treat or reward; not a luxury or status symbol; not a tasty, sophisticated beverage; not something that will help you relax, have fun, and be attractive. It is, in fact, the EXACT OPPOSITE of all those things.

And finally, at age 41, after more than twenty years of heavy drinking, my cravings were gone. It's been two years today without a drop of alcohol. My life is far from perfect, but there's trust in my marriage again. My career is about to skyrocket. My blood pressure is back to normal. I have zero risk of losing my driver's license and going to jail because of my constant needless, stupid, risky behavior. When a craving does hit, which is rare these days, it lasts about ten or fifteen seconds and is easily overpowered.

Read up on alcohol. Listen to Leon Sylvester tell you what the TV shows and commercials don't want you to know. Change your outlook before trying to change your actions, and then you can quit.

PROVIDENCE — Finally, some [music](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/05/17/metro/salon-downtown-lounge-finally-reopens-with-an-emphasis-local-providence-music/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link) is coming back to downtown Providence.

[Murmur HiFi Lounge](https://www.murmurhifi.com/#) will open this December in downtown Providence on the ground floor of the WIT building. It’ll be a high-fidelity, analog listening lounge, inspired by Japanese jazz kissatens from the 1920s, which were jazz coffee shops designed to enhance music listening and appreciation while providing a space for guests to enjoy music, drinks, and food.

The space, located at 276 Westminster St., previously held Black Rep, Roots Cafe, and Aurora — all popular music venues. For years, downtown Providence was also known for its other music venues, such as [Lupo’s Heartbreak Hotel](https://www.google.com/search?q=lupos+amaryllis+providence+bostonglobe.com&sca_esv=7363e84110bffb1e&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1097US1097&ei=l-jBaJT0KKSB5OMPsO-liAg&ved=0ahUKEwjUm9H6jM-PAxWkAHkGHbB3CYEQ4dUDCBM&uact=5&oq=lupos+amaryllis+providence+bostonglobe.com&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiKmx1cG9zIGFtYXJ5bGxpcyBwcm92aWRlbmNlIGJvc3Rvbmdsb2JlLmNvbTIIEAAYgAQYogQyCBAAGIAEGKIEMggQABiABBiiBDIIEAAYogQYiQUyBRAAGO8FSMMVUABY2hRwAHgAkAEAmAF9oAGUDKoBBDQuMTG4AQPIAQD4AQGYAg6gAuQLmAMAkgcEMy4xMaAHxUGyBwQzLjExuAfkC8IHBTAuNi44yAcu&sclient=gws-wiz-serp&p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link), which had brought in acts like Wu-Tang Clan, The Pretenders, Green Day, Smashing Pumpkins, Foo Fighters, and the Dave Matthews Band. Most of those music venues in downtown have been closed for years.

Murmur’s co-owners Robert Troutman and Allison Johnson were inspired by this concept after Troutman’s visit to Tokyo decades ago. Troutman and Jonhson came to Providence from Minneapolis and Philadelphia respectively to attend school, but never left. By day, Johnson is an architect; Troutman works as a graphic designer. They also share a passion for music: Johnson plays the piano, and Troutman is a guitarist. At Murmur, they’ll feature a variety of genres.

Just a little context, I am a 44yo 5'4"" cisgender female, still menstruating ('ish. I had an endometrial ablation this past June), used to weigh 300lbs, got to my lowest weight of 139lbs in 2023, but gained 30lbs due to stress eating in 2024/through early-2025. I lost about 15lbs before my surgery, but now I'm stalling.

When I first lost the weight in 2016-2017, I had largely consistent losses. I was eating between 1500 and 1700 calories per day and strength training 3x/week.

I had a labral strain AND pulled my shoulder during a run in 2020 and haven't really gotten back into running or strength training since. 

I log meticulously using MFP. I weigh, in grams, anything that isn't like a cucumber of handful of salad greens. 6 days a week I am very disciplined. 12k steps per day (2 miles of which are cardio walking through my subdivision). I do Pilates 5x per week. I drink lots of water, I'm sober, and I've had my hormone levels and thyroid checked back in April. All is within normal range. On Saturdays I may treat myself to a meal out or some ice cream, but I don't overdo it, and I log as carefully as I can with restaurants that aren't in the database.

Currently I'm at 1300 calories per day, going to bed hungry every night, working out regularly and the scale just won't budge. If it drops one week, it's back up the next. I feel like I'm spinning my wheels here trying to lose these last few pounds. I'm simply not happy in the 150s.

My daily food intake usually looks something like this:

6tbsp Planet Oat coffee creamer

20oz black coffee

Built Puff Bar

1/2c rolled oats

1tspb pure maple syrup

1 gala apple

Sliced cucumber

2 servings Sabra hummus

3oz extra firm tofu

I’m trying this again so hopefully it helps someone this time. 

They sell you the dream: “Join our brokerage! Make six figures! Be your own boss!”

Then reality hits hard! 

Month 1: You’re pumped. You tell everyone you’re in real estate now. You make a vision board. You buy business cards. You feel like a boss.

Month 2: You realize nobody cares that you got your license. Friends avoid your calls. Family starts asking when you’re getting leads.

Month 3: Panic sets in. You’ve spent money on marketing that got zero results. Your savings are shrinking. You start wondering if you made a mistake.

Month 4: Depression hits. You see other agents posting their “just sold” photos while you’re still trying to get someone to return your call.

Month 5: You’re broke. Really broke. You start looking at part-time jobs. Your spouse is asking hard questions.

Month 6: Make-or-break time. Either you figure it out or you quit like 87% of new agents do.

Here’s what nobody tells you:
Those first six months aren’t about closing deals. They’re about building the machine that will close deals.

What you should actually be doing:
Daily (non-negotiable):
•	20 phone calls to your database
•	5 social media touches with past clients
•	1 piece of market content posted
•	2 hours of skill practice (objection handling, scripts, market knowledge)

Weekly:
•	10 in-person meetings (coffee, lunch, anything)
•	1 market analysis for your neighborhood
•	5 listing appointments (even if you don’t get them)
•	Follow up with every lead from the past 90 days
Monthly:
•	Review your numbers. What’s working? What’s not?
•	Adjust your approach based on data
•	Set specific activity goals for next month

The hard truth is most new agents spend their first 6 months “getting ready to get ready.”
•	Taking more classes
•	Perfecting their website
-	Buying more marketing materials
•	Waiting for their brokerage to give them leads
All while avoiding the only activities that actually make money: conversations with people who might buy or sell.

What saved my career was that I built a system that tracked everything and kept me accountable to daily activities.

After burning through my savings for 8 months (yeah, I was slow), I finally got systematic about it. I started tracking every call, every follow-up, every appointment.

The system I use now automatically breaks down my annual goals into daily activities and tracks whether I’m on pace. It’s part of something called PULSE Intelligence that I helped build after going through this hell myself.
But honestly? You can do this with a spreadsheet and discipline.

The real secret is that your first 6 months aren’t about perfection. They’re about consistency.
Make 20 calls a day for 6 months and something will happen.
Make 0 calls a day for 6 months and nothing will happen.
It’s that simple.

So here’s the bottom line…those first 6 months will test everything you have. Your savings, your relationships, your self-belief.

Most agents quit because they think something’s wrong with them.
Nothing’s wrong with you. You just need a system.

The agents who survive aren’t luckier or more talented. They’re more systematic.

So here’s a question for new agents: What’s your biggest struggle right now? What are you avoiding that you know you should be doing?

And also a question for experienced agents: What do you wish someone had told you in your first 6 months?",0,1757592203.0,realtors,7,0.5,False

1ne6xoq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nonfictionbookclub/comments/1ne6xoq/i_applied_atomic_habits_for_30_days_heres_what/,I applied Atomic Habits for 30 days here's what worked and what didn't,"I was skeptical about another productivity book promising to ""change everything."" But after 30 days of actually applying James Clear's methods from Atomic Habits, I'm a different person.

Here's what happened when I stopped reading about habits and started building them:

* I started stupidly small. Instead of ""I'm gonna work out for an hour every day,"" I committed to one push-up. That's it. Sounds dumb, right? But I actually did it. One turned to five. Then five turned to 10. I now do 20 pushups in a set when it's chest day.
* I made it impossible to fail. Put my workout clothes right next to my bed. Left a water bottle on my nightstand. Put a book on my pillow. When I woke up, healthy stuff was literally in my face. I also stopped buying junk food and soda's. No more fast food deliveries too.
* I piggybacked on stuff I already do. ""After I brush my teeth, I'll do my push-up."" ""After I pour coffee, I'll read one page."" I attached new habits to things I was already doing automatically. Same thing where I'll meditate after making my bed.

What happened week by week:

* Week 1: Doing my one push-up feeling like an idiot. But hey, I did it every day.
* Week 2: Started doing 5 push-ups because one felt too easy. Read 2-3 pages because one wasn't enough.
* Week 3: 15-20 push-ups felt normal. Reading for 10-15 minutes became automatic.
* Week 4: Full 30-minute workouts. Reading 30+ pages daily. It just happened. I realized this what compound growth means.

I stopped thinking of myself as lazy. I became ""someone who works out daily"" and ""someone who reads."" My brain literally rewired itself.

What I learned:

* Small and consistent beats big and sporadic every time. I'd rather do one push-up every day for a year than 100 push-ups once.
* Your environment matters more than your willpower. If you make good choices easier and bad choices harder, you'll naturally do better.
* Missing one day doesn't matter. Missing two days in a row starts a bad pattern.

Biggest mistake I made was tying to change everything at once. I focused on just two habits exercise and reading. That's it.

If you want to try this: just Pick ONE tiny habit. Make it so small it feels almost stupid. Do it for 30 days. Don't worry about results, just show up.

I went from zero exercise and zero books to working out daily and reading 2-3 books a month. Not because I became more disciplined, but because I made it easier.",0,1757592124.0,nonfictionbookclub,1,0.33,False

In event of a change in exam pattern, EVERYONE who has any sort of a test-taking strategy in place as per the previous pattern will have to adapt. You're not the only one. So just go through the whole section, with the highest level of alertness and then take a few deep breaths and get to business. You'll be okay. Normalisation should take care of all the jitters the morning slot people face. In the end, it'll be the same DI and LR and time speed distance and alligations you will be solving.

2. I'll say it again. Before you begin a section, go through all the questions whilst being VERY ALERT. Then choose the RCs/DILR sets you will be attempting and go ahead. Back in my day in CAT 2021 DILR, I solved one easy DI set (4 questions) and then one of the tricky LR sets and had the solution completely on my note pad. Had a little less than 10 minutes left and I solved and marked the 4 questions of the second set. Then I relaxed for the last 4-5 minutes before quant started. Was satisfied with my DILR performance with guaranteed 8 correct questions. When I came back home and checked the Telegram groups, I realized that the second LR set I solved had 6 questions and not just 4. For no reason, I chose not to see if I left any questions and threw away my extra 6 marks and with it, a 99+ percentile overall and in DILR.

3. Check all the equipment, especially the mouse. If needed, ask them to replace.

4. The on-screen calculator sometimes glitches and is not as flawless as the one you have in mocks. For me, at times, it entered whatever number I clicked on twice instead of once. It wasted around 4-5 crucial minutes in Quant. So keep an eye out for this.

5. Get some black coffee in a 200ml coke bottle to the centre if you want. Well and good if allowed inside. If not, just drink a bit of it before you go in and toss the bottle. You can bring in some coke or sprite or whatever that helps you stay refreshed and alert.

6. In case the paper seems easy, push yourself to solve more. Don't rely on you-know-who's 8-8-8 or 9-9-9 strategy. However, before a section ends, try to pause solving for a minute- minute and a half and take a few deep breaths and get ready for the next section. You want yourself to be calm and composed when you go through and select questions from the next section.",3,1757592038.0,CATiim,1,1.0,False

A guy called George Floyd, police brutality, he was a criminal?? He was a father. The police is a criminal. The police are criminals. ICE raids. Nit-picky news headlines. I think you need to educate yourself on this matter. Read this article.

Indigenous rights in New Zealand, immigration in Australia, costs of living crisis, white supremacist violence, Swiss army protests, nepal is in flames, fkn luxon, fkn Seymour, fkn trump, fkn bigots. You need to get better sources. You are in an echo chamber…

While that’s all happening don’t forget about… global warming or the congo! Male loneliness epidemic, dating horror stories from woman, adding a letter to the LGBTQIA2+ alliance for awareness month. Black people speaking against activists. It’s good to see a debate. Philosophy circle’s. Academia bias. 

You can’t be the victim of racism and this man won’t accept he is.

Our activism stands for all our people, if you don’t agree we can’t see each-other.

How could you not watch the news? You make an impact! Stay informed! privilege allows you to look away. Actually - they are saying nasty things about people like you! Don’t let them victimize you, this is real footage but AI will soon turn people against each-other. AI is curing cancer, like from microplastics. Spread the word people will die. People will suffer.

Don’t make a joke about it. It’s no laughing matter. It’s actually rather serious. Empathise with their pain.

Be good do it for them.

Can I breathe now? I can.

Can I slow down?

Our lease term started on August 18th. The day we actually moved in, August 19th, we received an HOA violation for unkept weeds in the flower bed. Keep in mind we had only been living here mere hours upon receiving this violation. I promptly reached out to my original point of contact to ask them if they would be coming to resolve this violation. I was told by my leasing agent that she had contacted the local office, and asked them to get in touch with me. She assured me at that time that this violation would not be my responsibility.

Several days pass, and the deadline to resolve the violation came closer. I reached out via phone multiple times attempting to get in contact with the local office. I received the National Contact Center every single time. I would ask that they have the local office reach out to me, and was told that each agent was submitting the highest priority ticket to the local office. The deadline came and went, and no one ever came. All the while, however, I was receiving threatening emails from Invitation Homes stating that if I did not contact them or resolve the violation, I would be facing eviction and legal proceedings. I had already contacted them quite literally dozens of times at this point.

Eventually, I reached out to my local HOA myself to fill them in on the situation, and let them know that we were not ignoring the violation, and that we were working with the landlord to get this resolved. Not even 10 minutes after speaking with the HOA, I get a phone call from someone in the local IH office for the very first time. On this call, she assured me without a doubt that I did not need to take any further action. I asked her to send me that in writing, and she did. I have an email from the agent stating ""Invitation Homes will handle the issue."" This email was received on August 28th.

From there, I continued to receive the emails threatening eviction, and no one from Invitation Homes ever came out to resolve the issue. I called again several times to ask if there was any follow up I needed to do, and was told there was nothing they needed from me and that they would handle it. At this point they seemed annoyed that I kept asking them to come resolve this issue.

On September 5th, 2025, I received an email stating that my lease was scheduled for termination in 7 days for Noncompliance. I have not been noncompliant at ANY point. In fact, I have been overly communicative. I have made every attempt to speak with the local office and get this resolved to no avail. This email I received also noted that even if we resolve this issue, if we commit any further violations within the remainder of our lease, we will be terminated without any warning or opportunity to correct the mistakes. Meaning if I let my grass grow a bit too high and get a violation, my lease is automatically terminated because of this.

Let me reiterate that we have done NOTHING wrong. Had Invitation Homes told me from the very beginning the violation was our responsibility to cure, I would have done it. I would have been VERY annoyed that this house sat vacant for 60 days and the second we move in they slap the violation on us to fix it instead of making sure the home was move in ready, but I would have dealt with it. However, I was told this was NOT my responsibility, and told NOT to touch the weeds.

I've notified the local office that if they do not resolve this matter within 7 days, I will be filing a complaint with the State of Florida due to their negligence and outright violation of Landlord-Tenant laws. I sent them a certified letter on the same day I received the lease termination notice. They never contacted me about it, but a work order finally did pop up on my account for someone to come fix the weeds tomorrow.

Now, I’ve had a red light on my refrigerator since the day we moved in. I haven’t had time to figure out what it was for since we have been dealing with SO many other things. I researched it today and saw that we need a new water filter which is $60. I tried to schedule a work order and was told that this responsibility falls on the resident. It’s only $60, but I’m still so SO angry. Why should I pay for something that someone else used?! 

When we signed our lease, we got an email stating that “the house is in ‘as is’ condition, and that it may be a little dirty from people touring it. I accepted that. I did not realize that actually meant that the house was barely move in ready and it’s now my problem. 

After all this, I’m fully convinced that they had this violation already before we moved in, and sent it to us the second they could. They’ve said to me over and over that this is not my responsibility, Yet it took them nearly a month to have someone come out to fix it. And only after I threatened legal action. To me, it seems like they thought ignoring me and sending me threatening emails would get me to just give up and resolve the issue myself. 

I still don’t know what’s going to happen, because tomorrow marks the “7 day noncompliance” date where they’ll supposedly be terminating my lease. I guess I’ll update when I find out. I’ve compiled a document that has a record of every single phone call I’ve made, every email chain, and exactly what was said any time I reached out to the company. I don’t want to have to escalate it but I certainly will. I suppose my main goal posting this is to ask if (1) should I bother fighting this ice machine thing? Or just buy the filter and get over it? And (2) I hope anyone searching up Invitation Homes before signing a lease reads this review, and reconsiders. Especially if you’re in the Jacksonville area. ",1,1757590598.0,Renters,3,1.0,False

1ne69ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1ne69ug/delonghi_dedica_arte_good_enough_for_me_or_maybe/,Delonghi Dedica Arte - good enough for me? Or maybe unnecessary? [€250],"I'll try to keep this short...

I have been using a moka pot, a Baratza encore grinder, and a stovetop milk 'frother' to make coffee at home - either americano or cappuccino. Even this relatively basic setup is better than half the cafes near me, and I've been pretty happy with this for 2-3 years. However, I've reached a point where I would like to upgrade the coffee/'espresso' part of it.

I don't really want to get hugely into espresso making - I don't need another hobby with spiralling expenses, and I don't want to have to invest lots of time into dialling in a machine that is ""too much machine"" for me. Also, I figure I'm not *that* much of a coffee drinker (home-made cappuccino or americano maybe 3-5 times a week), so spending crazy money on a new setup is unnecessary.

I've been eyeing up a Delonghi Dedica Arte (EC885). I know it might not get the absolute best out of whichever coffee beans I have, but I reckon that for me it will be 'good enough'? The question then would be twofold:

1. Would this produce noticeably better coffee for me, compared to what I have?
2. And if so, would these results be *relatively* easy to achieve? Although I am reluctant to get into the weeds with exact weights, water temperatures, etc. I am still willing to do a little dialling in in terms of grind size and weight, and wouldn't be annoyed if it required a few extra small purchases like a new basket or whatever. And I'd be ok with getting say 80% of the potential out of the machine. But I don't think I really have the type of passion or interest required to really get into the weeds of espresso making.

Or, would I just be better off sticking with what I already got?

Thanks! To quickly fill-out the criteria a but more succinctly: I'm based in Europe, drink americano or cappuccino, max 1 a day (but would make drinks for guests every so often), quite tight in terms of counter top space, not new to homemade coffee but yes new to 'real' espresso.

Respectful debate is the cornerstone of democracy.,"I studied Political Science at a Canadian Liberal Arts university in the early 2000's. Open debate with people of opposing views was considered healthy and encouraged.

Some of my best friends from that time, who continue to be good friends, are all over the political spectrum and often have opposing views. Some of them are pretty involved, at a high level, in various political parties.

We still enjoy political debate and agree to disagree on many issues.

Political debate is healthy in a democracy. Political violence is not healthy.

I wasn't a huge fan of Charlie Kirk, or some of his views, but the way he tried to debate, and brought the message of debating those who you don't agree with, to college campuses was admirable.

I just wish people would go outside more and talk to people in real life. I play sports and volunteer in my community, interacting with people of all different backgrounds/ political views. There is never any of the vitriol I see online in our conversations. There is no hate. There is no vilifying people.

We need to wake up, get offline and return political debate to the local coffee shops, pubs, and other spaces where people can see beyond petty political differences.

EDIT: Just for context. The use of the word liberal in liberal arts isn't the same as liberal in a political sense. Many of my classmates were quite conservative, some of my classmates were bonafide communists. Some of my classmates went on to serve in Liberal, Conservative and NDP parties as MP's, MLA's etc., and in executive functions withing political parties.

One morning, I found her sitting at the kitchen table with her chipped coffee cup, staring into it like it held the weight of the world. I asked her what was wrong. She smiled weakly and said, *It’s nothing. Just tired.* But I saw her hands trembling, the deep lines under her eyes, the way her body seemed smaller than I remembered. That night, she collapsed. Stress, exhaustion, and years of carrying everything alone had caught up with her. I held her hand in the hospital, promising her I’d take care of things from now on, but she didn’t wake up to hear it.

Now, every time I see a cheap jar of instant coffee, I think of her , of all the sacrifices hidden in that cup, of all the mornings she carried us without ever asking for help. It wasn’t luxury, but it was love in its purest form.",5,1757589685.0,story,0,1.0,False

1ne635b,https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1ne635b/a_guide_to_hkias_airport_lounges/,A Guide to HKIA's Airport Lounges,"Hey everyone, I've seen posts in this subreddit, r/cathaypacific, and r/oneworld regarding lounge access, the best lounges in HKIA and thought it'd be nice to make this post to help people who might be departing on a flight from HKG or having a layover here.

**Plaza Premium Lounge, Gate 1**  
The closest lounge after going through security, is the Plaza Premium Gate 1 Lounge which is accessible with the American Express Explorer Card, Priority Pass or using cash to pay in. The food options aren't great during breakfast times, with little to no variety and is usually a crowded space due to the close proximity from after security. There is a bar serving alcholic and non-alcoholic beverages and barista-made coffee. The lounge also has shower rooms  They also have vegetarian food options, and a nursing room for babies and toddlers. The lounge has no outside light or any windows at all for views.

**Plaza Premium Lounge, Gate 35**  
Another Plaza Premium lounge, that can be accessed with the same credit cards and Priority Pass as the other PP lounges. The lounge is all the way at Gate 35, near the Cathay Pacific Bridge Lounge. The lounge has sufficient seating options with charging stations, with slightly better food & beverage than the Gate 1 lounge and usually is not as crowded, there are also lounging chairs and an area for rest. There is no barista-made coffee, bar or shower rooms available. Lounge offers outside light and has beautiful views of the aircrafts outside on the apron.

**Plaza Premium Lounge, Gate 60**  
The third and last Plaza Premium Lounge, that can be accessed with the same credit cards and Priority Pass as the other PP lounges on Level 7 near the Emirates lounge, which requires you to take the escalator or the lift to access it. It's far in proximity from the main gates and the other lounges and shopping areas, which makes it less overcrowded and usually a big, welcoming space with many different seating options available. They have usually the same levels of food & beverage with vegetarian options available and shower facilities. Again, there is no bar or barista-made coffee. The views here are spectacular, with some saying it's the best views in the whole airport.

**Plaza Premium First, Gate 1**  
The second closest lounge past security, is just next to the business Plaza Premium Lounge and is only reserved for those travelling on Business or First Class on airlines like Qatar Airways, Korean Air and Garuda Indonesia or you could access it by paying with cash. There's a bar with complimentary alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks like cocktails and a range of wines and palate cleansers, which are usually just a combination of juices. There's a restaurant called Primo available, with a-la-carte dining available and next to it is a small buffet area with hot food options, and a salad bar with cold cuts, sliced cheeses (that aren't great for FC standards) and vegetables. The shower rooms are bigger than the business Plaza Premium lounges and offer more premium amenities like body wash and shampoo by a more premium brand, with amenities like shaving cream, razors, makeup pads and dental kits. They also have complimentary 15-minute spa treatments, which can be booked with the receptionists. The lounge doesn't have outside light nor windows, and is quite isolated from the sunlight areas in the airport.

**Plaza Premium First, Gate 35**  
Similar to the other Plaza Premium First Lounge, with a bar, shower facilities, buffet offering vegetarian options, and salad bar. Unfortunately, there's no restaurant in the lounge, or spa treatments and the lounge is a bit smaller than the other one. This lounge is only a good option when your gate is near Gate 35 or if the Gate 1 lounge is a lot more crowded than this one.

**Shower & Massage (Refreshhh by Aerotel), Gate 60**  
Right next to the Gate 60 Plaza Premium Lounge, this lounge offers showers and massage services which can be accessed with cash. The shower facilities are nice and pretty spacious, but not usually worth the $35 USD fee for a 30 minute shower. There's no food or beverage options other than water provided.

**American Express Centurion Lounge, Gate 60**  
Located near the Aerotel & Plaza Premium lounge, you can access the lounge with the American Express Platinum Charge Card or the Black Centurion Card. There's a complimentary bar, buffet with vegetarian options and hot & cold food, and also a salad bar. There's spacious showers with Loccitane shower amenities and other free amenities like shaving kits, & dental kits on request. For those holding the super exclusive black Centurion card, you have access to a secret corner within the lounge, with catering from the luxury Hong Kong Rosewood hotel, serving up fresh Japanese sashimi platters, caviar, wagyu steak, etc. The lounge offers beautiful views and you can even look down onto the Bridge lounge by Cathay Pacific.

**Hong Kong Airlines Club Autus, Gate 201-230 Midfield Concourse**  
Club Autus, an isolated lounge from the airport and all other lounges, is located in the Midfield Concourse where low-cost carriers like Greater Bay Airlines & Hong Kong Express depart from. The Midfield Concourse is a small, outdated and somewhat ""old"" area, with barely any shops and no luxury brands available in this space. You can access this lounge with Dragonpass, flying Business Class on Hong Kong Airlines, hold the Fortune Wings frequent flyer status, or you could pay-in to this lounge for $550 HKD for one 3-hour visit if you are travelling in Economy on a Hong Kong Airlines operated flight. Additionally, passengers travelling to Sydney in Economy can also access this lounge. The lounge offers minimal refreshments and food options when I travelled in January with HX, but now they have resumed all operations of the entire lounge with a bar that serves their signature drink ""Bauhinia Blossom"", which is a fruity strawberry mocktail. Showers are also now available at this lounge.

**Emirates Lounge, Gate 60**  
The Emirates Lounge, reserved for passengers travelling in Business or First Class on Star Alliance offers a wide range of hot and cold food options with a bar with barista-made coffee, wines, alcoholic beverages and a salad bar. The food options here are considered the best in Hong Kong outside of the oneworld lounges. There is a luxury and spacious prayer room and shower facilities available in this lounge.

**Singapore Airlines SilverKris Lounge, Gate 5**  
Singapore Airlines SilverKris Lounge is located near Gate 5, offering a mediocre buffet selection of Asian choices and a bar offering cocktails, mocktails and Australian wines and classic Singaporean desserts, like beancurd with brown sugar and offers shower facilities for passengers.

**Qantas Airways Lounge, Gate 7**  
The best non-Cathay lounge in Hong Kong International Airport, the Qantas lounge offers access to any passenger holding Oneworld Sapphire Status or travelling in Business/First class that are also travelling on an oneworld operated airline. They have a wide range of options at the buffet, like Australian style salads, Japanese & Asian dishes, and more variety of western options. They also offer super delicious and delectable desserts, like their signature pavlova and caramel cheesecake. In the mornings, they offer breakfast items like toast, bacon, scrambled eggs and other dishes, they also have fresh fruits that you can squeeze to make your own juice. They have a bar that is open all day serving wonderful cocktails, mocktails and Australian wines. In the evenings during Qantas departures to Australia, they also have a a-la-carte menu serving 5 to 7 dishes. They have large and spacious shower facilities with plush towels and other amenities.

**Cathay Pacific The Wing, Gate 2 (Business)**  
The oldest and most classic and memorable Cathay Pacific lounge, The Wing can be accessed if you are a passenger holding Oneworld Sapphire Status or travelling in Business/First class that are also travelling on an oneworld operated airline. They offer a small range of cold cuts and sliced cheeses and a build your own salad station, with some hot dishes. There is also the signature noodle bar, offering their signature noodle dishes like the Dan Dan Mian, wonton noodles and char siu rice.

**Cathay Pacific The Pier, Gate 65 (Business)**  
Cathay's The Pier, is commonly recognised as one of the best Oneworld Business Class lounges in the world, just falling behind Qatar's Al Mourjan. The lounge offers a super luxurious atmosphere, with residential furniture. Access requirements are the same as the Wing Business. They offer a western area, serving stoneoven grilled pizzas, cheesy lasagna and other italian and western favorites. They also have more cold cuts with higher quality, such as 24-month aged serrano ham, iberico chorizo and parmesan cheese carved from a wheel and adjacent to it is a coffee bar with premium barista-made illy coffees. Heading further into the lounge, you'll find the noodle bar, the most ""finished"" noodle bar Cathay offers, with the usual Dan Dan Mian, wonton noodles, char siu rice, but they also have their signature sour & spicy marinated cucumbers, Taiwanese brown sugar sponge cake and dim sum like xiaolongbao, har gao (shrimp dumplings) and char siu bun. Heading further in, you'll find EVEN more beverage options at the bar, with white & red wines, cocktails, whiskey, gin, rum, beer, apertifs, liquers, vodka, tequila, mocktails ""Cathay Delight"" which is their signature kiwi drink with coconut milk and peppermint, ""Ginger Forest"" and ""Orange Dream"". They also have more non-alcoholic options like fresh fruit juices, soft drinks and their jasmine lemon iced tea. At the end of the lounge, you find the teahouse with a tea expert serving up JING teas authentically right infront of you, paired with sweets and different mini pastries available. They have luxurious shower facilities, daybed rest areas, and a ""bureau"" for those looking to get some work done.

Hope you all enjoy this post and hope it helped you find the best lounge at HKG!

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

1ne6169,https://i.redd.it/h8mozvkeriof1.png,Around 15-16kg down from Feb/March 2025 to 11th September 2025 (Today),"Disclaimer: I used another GLP but thought our journeys are all the same and relavent. If this post is not allowed please remove it!

My weight loss has been relativley slow, but I wouldn't have it any other way, I am trying to ""recomp"" by building/maintaining as much muscle as I can whilst losing weight. For context I previously had been lifting weights for a few years prior to my weight gain, but stopped hence the weight gain. I started taking Mounjaro around Feb or March, I actually can't remember exactly when as I downloaded the shotsy app quite late, but I only really started taking it seriously around towards the end of May which is where most of my weight loss has come from.

My weight loss has generally been slow at what I average out as 500gm per week but I am happy with it as I am making long term changes and reversion to the mean and I am not is a significant rush. I want to regain some of the muscle I lost after a period of depression and neglect of my body. I used to be around 100kg back in 2017 for context and was working out lifting weights regularly and about 10kg away from my goal at the time. Depression hit, gained all the kg's and it stayed for a while. At this stage I feel like my goal weight sits at around the 90-95kg range, I do want to get back in certain sports I used to play when I was younger and it helps being lighter so we'll see. I am 185cm for context.

I made some significant lifestyle changes over the last few months including, starting antidepressants, quitting alcohol for good (around 50 days no alcohol - and feel SO much better). I honestly can't describe how much better I feel stopping alcohol, it's made me realise how poisonous it is even in small quantities.

Do you remember when you were a kid, it was the weekend and your parents said you couldn't play videogames as it was too late but you could play in the morning? Then you bounced out of bed as if you'd just inhaled three coffees? Yeah, I have that kind of energy (almost) again, I thought I was jsut ""getting old"" and would feel slow and tired for good whilst I am only in my early 30's.

I also earlier in the year around Jan was diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea and hypertension. This was the trigger that got my act together. I was on CPAP and after not tolerating it stopped using it around 2-3 months ago. I noticed I wasn't snoring, no headache and not tired, so I got another sleep study a few weeks ago - no more sleep apnoea. My blood pressure is around 125/80, I could probably come of my last BP medication but I'm doing that slowly (was on two).

I had been inspired by so many posters on this sub and the other main GLP subs I thought I'd share and hope at least 1 person looks as it and maybe sees something out of my situation they can use as fuel to make change.

I also wanted to prove it is possible to put on muscle/maintain whilst using this drug, I think it's all about the rate of the weight loss more than anything AND making sure you are hitting your protein goals. It's hard but I aim 200g every day, with the aid of protein shakes.

* Produced by the trusted **Lavazza brand**, known for quality Italian coffee.

* Limited to use with **Keurig machines**, not compatible with other espresso makers.

here's my thought or review on them

Afnan Supremecy Collector's Edition

this thing smells amazing ngl, i recently ran out of CDNIM EDT which i adores a lot so i thought on repurchasing but then i stumbled upon this and it blew me away! unlike 9pm Rebel that's cloying and headache inducing even to myself, the pineapple+bergamot opening with a little smokiness on the drydown is heavenly.

French Avenue Royal Blend Nero

smells close to Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa imo with a little bit more cinnamony and lacking on the coffee? just like the bottle colour/name, it smells sweet but dark at the same time because of the spices.

Ahmed Al-Maghribi Kaaf

it's a repurchase coz i love this thing and almost ran out, doesn't offend anyone even if you overspray tbh. it's a great daily scent for hot tropical weather and in my case i get few compliments from it.

and lastly Rayhaan Nocturno

there's no complicated scents here, fresh, clean citrusy smell on the opening with a little musky on the drydown, kinda reminds me of BDC which it's actually had the dna here, mixed with Sauvage from what i read here and there.

can't say much about perfomance but right out the box both Nero and CE performed quite well which is around 6-7hrs of longevity with loud projection on the first 2 hours. Nocturno perhaps gets around 4-5 hours with decent projection i guess? newly open Kaaf performed quite well too, 5-6 hours with good projection.

overall, it's a satisfying purchase, looking forward for the next one!",3,1757589005.0,fragranceclones,6,1.0,False

So last weekend she invited her friends over, clearly to put on a show. She was acting like the queen of high-class living, until one of them casually asked for coffee. Simple, right? She froze. Then she pulled out the saddest half empty jar of instant coffee I’ve ever seen, tried to act like it was some special imported blend, and immediately spilled it all over the counter.

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I’m not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

The show sparked international outrage. Toward the end of the set, Carr delivered what he called a ‘career ender’ – a joke about the Holocaust, in which he described the Nazis’ murder of thousands of ‘Gypsies’ as a ‘positive’.

The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, the Auschwitz Memorial, and the UK government condemned the joke as ‘appalling’, ‘abhorrent’, and ‘racist’; Carr, critics said, was trading on the ‘last acceptable form of racism’.

Comedy touches every part of our lives. We tell jokes at the pub, around the dinner table, and by the office coffee machine. We all know someone who makes us laugh – and someone who seems to take things too far. But *is* there a line when it comes to humour? And if there is, who gets to draw it? Should we suspend our moral judgements when the lights go down and the curtain goes up? Or do jokes, like most speech acts, carry moral weight?

To answer these questions, we need to understand the nature of comedy itself – what *exactly* it is we’re responding to when we laugh. Humour might be a release of nervous tension, a playful disruption of expectations, or – more troublingly, if it applies to Carr’s joke – a means of asserting social superiority. No doubt, comedy has the power to shape our culture and perceptions. But, as we’ll find out, it also tells us something about who we are, who we ought to be, and the things we value most.

# Durham University scientists have successfully completed one of the largest verification programmes ever carried out on superconducting materials, marking a crucial milestone for the ITER reactor – the [world’s biggest experiment in fusion energy.](https://www.iter.org/)

Their extensive study not only confirmed the quality of superconducting wires essential for ITER’s giant magnets but also advanced the methods used to test them.

By refining how these materials are validated, the researchers have laid the groundwork for a more reliable path to achieving practical fusion power.

# What is fusion energy?

[Fusion energy is often described as the ‘holy grail’ of clean power](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/fusion-energy-explained-powering-the-future-of-clean-energy/58361/). Unlike fission, which splits atoms in today’s nuclear plants, fusion joins light atomic nuclei – usually isotopes of hydrogen – into heavier ones, releasing enormous amounts of energy in the process.

This is the same reaction that powers the Sun, where extreme pressure and temperatures cause hydrogen atoms to merge into helium. If harnessed on Earth, fusion could provide:

* Virtually limitless energy from abundant fuels like deuterium, which can be extracted from seawater.
* Zero carbon emissions, making it a cornerstone of climate change solutions.
* Minimal [radioactive waste](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/radioactive-waste-management-and-disposal/55833/), without the long-lived hazards associated with conventional nuclear power.

In short, fusion energy represents a game-changing technology that could provide safe, sustainable electricity for generations.

# ITER: A mega-project to harness the power of the Sun

Currently under construction in southern France, ITER ([International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor](https://www.iter.org/)) is the largest and most ambitious fusion experiment in history. When complete, it aims to demonstrate sustained fusion at a scale never before achieved.

At its heart, the ITER reactor will confine plasma – an ultra-hot, electrically charged gas – at temperatures exceeding the Sun’s core.

To achieve this, the machine relies on colossal superconducting magnets capable of generating some of the strongest steady magnetic fields ever created.

These magnets are only as reliable as the superconducting wires within them, making the verification of their performance an essential step toward ITER’s success.

# Durham University’s role in ITER’s magnet system

In 2011, Durham University was selected to become one of Europe’s official reference laboratories for ITER.

**The team, led by Professor Damian Hampshire and Dr Mark Raine, was tasked with developing specialised methods to test the superconducting wires made from Niobium-Tin (Nb₃Sn) and Niobium-Titanium (Nb–Ti).**

**Over more than a decade of research, the team handled:**

* **5,500 wire samples processed and tested.**
* **13,000 separate measurements performed.**
* **Heat treatments above 650°C to prepare Nb₃Sn wires before testing.**

**The results provided unprecedented insights into both material performance and testing reliability, ensuring that each strand met the rigorous standards required for ITER’s demanding environment.**

**Breakthrough in testing methods**

One of the most significant outcomes of the project was a statistical approach to validating Nb₃Sn wires, which are permanently altered during testing.

Durham scientists demonstrated that measurements from adjacent strands across different laboratories can serve as accurate substitutes, ensuring both cost-effectiveness and consistency.

This breakthrough not only boosts confidence in ITER’s magnet system but also sets a new benchmark for how superconducting materials should be tested worldwide.

**The global race for fusion power**

Durham’s work arrives at a time when momentum for fusion energy is accelerating globally.

ITER is targeting its first plasma in 2035, but private companies are pushing for commercial breakthroughs even sooner.

* Helion Energy has already struck a deal with Microsoft [to deliver electricity from a fusion plant by 2028](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/helion-breaks-ground-at-microsoft-backed-fusion-power-plant/60364/).
* Commonwealth Fusion Systems, backed by Google, has secured pre-orders for 200 megawatts of fusion power in the 2030s.
* The UK Government has pledged £2.5bn to fusion research and is developing its own prototype reactor, [STEP](https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/step-is-the-apollo-of-fusion-energy/43234/), on a former coal site in Nottinghamshire.

This growing international investment highlights the race to make fusion a commercial reality.

**Training the next generation**

# MARK A. SMITH: President Lula’s Niobium Sword Of Damocles

[MARK A. SMITH: President Lula’s Niobium Sword Of Damocles | The Daily Caller](https://dailycaller.com/2025/09/10/opinion-president-lulas-niobium-sword-of-damocles-mark-a-smith/)

https://preview.redd.it/w0flq626biof1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=b70acc2a5cb7a840fa0089b57e93e238d43d712c

Before President Trump, America spent years wringing our collective hands about China and rare earths.  Now, with President Trump’s turbocharging of the Defense Production Act and other tools in the federal toolbox, we are taking action not seen since the Korean War to reduce our dependence on foreign critical minerals.

But while the focus in recent months has been largely on Beijing, another vulnerability has emerged on the near-term radar screen: niobium from Brazil.

Niobium is a little-known but irreplaceable metal. Added in small amounts to steel, it dramatically increases strength and durability while cutting weight—critical for pipelines, bridges, turbines, and automobiles.  Virtually every steel-chassis vehicle on the planet contains niobium.  That’s not surprising given that one pound of niobium added to one ton of steel doubles the steel’s yield strength. [**(RELATED: Trump Admin Looks To Pour Cash Into Critical Minerals To Break China’s Stranglehold)**](https://dailycaller.com/2025/08/13/trump-admin-pour-cash-critical-minerals-break-chinas-stranglehold/)

In aerospace and defense, niobium enables jet engines and hypersonic missiles to withstand extreme temperatures.  It is vital to every Navy ship and submarine that sails, and every fighter jet and commercial airliner that flies.  It is crucial to the superconducting magnets in MRI scanners and particle accelerators.

The U.S. consumes thousands of tons each year and imports 100 percent of it, overwhelmingly from Brazil.  That gives Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva a card to play that rivals the rare earth card Chinese President Xi recently laid on the table.  Except, in the case of niobium, the stakes are even higher for the U.S.

According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) *Mineral Commodity Summaries 2025*, Brazil accounted for about 66% of U.S. ferroniobium and niobium metal imports in 2024, with Canada supplying roughly 27–29%. But Canadian supply does not fully insulate the U.S. from Brazilian dominance; Canada has relied, in part, on Brazilian ores or concentrates as recently as 2023, according to international trade data.

As Fox News has reported extensively, China has imposed export restrictions on rare earths as leverage in geopolitical disputes. President Xi Jinping has made clear that Beijing views critical-mineral dominance as a strategic weapon, not just an economic advantage.

It is not hard to imagine President Lula doing the same.  He continues to align Brazil more closely with China and Russia. He bristles at U.S. trade policies, agricultural disputes, and climate disagreements. In a worsening relationship, niobium could become Lula’s pressure point, just as rare earths are for Xi.

**Here is the uncomfortable truth: a Brazilian cutoff of niobium would be even more damaging to the U.S. economy and our national security than a Chinese cutoff of rare earths. Rare earths are critical for magnets, electronics, and many systems fielded by the Pentagon.  Niobium, by contrast, is less replaceable and more foundational. Without it, the strength and performance of steel and superalloys collapse—threatening core sectors from construction to defense.**

A new USGS analysis estimates that a disruption of Brazilian niobium exports to the U.S. could wipe away more than $10.4 billion per year from our GDP. While USGS assigns a relatively low 3.7% probability that Brazilian exports could be disrupted, it forecasts catastrophic impacts. Even a low-probability risk becomes urgent when the downside is so severe.

The U.S. has virtually no margin of safety. There are only limited supplies of niobium in the National Defense Stockpile.

Recycling is negligible. Substitutes for many applications are expensive or inadequate. If Brazil acts, manufacturers will face soaring prices and crippling delays. Aircraft could be grounded, shipbuilding slowed, infrastructure compromised, and defense readiness undermined. The $10 billion/year GDP hit modeled by USGS is only the opening shock.

**The U.S. has limited niobium resources considered economic for extraction except in one state:  Nebraska.  As America’s only primary niobium prospect, the Elk Creek Project will significantly alter the niobium risk equation and provide a partial solution.  (Full disclosure: I serve as the Chairman and CEO of NioCorp Developments, which is developing this project).**

# Once operational, Elk Creek could produce roughly 7,400 tons of ferroniobium annually for nearly four decades.  That is equivalent to 4,800 tonnes/year of contained niobium, over one-half of total U.S. apparent consumption of 8,400 tonnes.  This single U.S. mine would provide much-needed balance in the niobium supply chain and put a big dent in our import dependence.

Besides getting this initial mine operational as fast as possible, how else can the U.S. dull Brazil’s niobium sword of Damocles?  There are only three operational niobium mines in the world today.  Two are in Brazil, and a smaller mine operates in Canada.  Guess which nation owns 100% of one of the Brazilian mines and holds an equity position in the second?  China.

The only real solution for niobium mirrors what the Trump Administration is doing for rare earths: mine, baby, mine.

The U.S. has already learned hard lessons about overreliance on adversarial suppliers. We cannot afford to repeat them with niobium. The USGS has quantified the risk. The geopolitics are clear. America must not wait for the day when a phone call from Brasília delivers an ultimatum.

*Mark A. Smith is CEO and Chairman of NioCorp Developments Ltd., which is developing the Elk Creek Critical Minerals Project in Nebraska, designed to produce niobium, scandium, titanium, and rare earth oxides.*

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

# Why Niobium is the “Quiet Giant” in NioCorp’s Basket

**When people think about NioCorp, they jump straight to Scandium alloys or rare earth magnets. But the metal that may actually carry the project — and the U.S. industrial base — is Niobium (Nb).**

**Here’s why:**

**1. Aerospace & Defense Superalloys (Near-Term, Most Likely)**

* Pratt & Whitney, GE Aerospace, Lockheed, and Boeing are already dependent on Brazilian supply (CBMM = single choke point).
* Jet engines, hypersonics, missile bodies — they all live and die on niobium’s strength at heat.
* DFARS-compliant U.S. niobium from Elk Creek would be snapped up fast.

**2. Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)**

* TerraPower, NuScale, X-Energy — all need niobium alloys for extreme heat and corrosion resistance.
* DOE/DoD want a secure supply chain for next-gen nuclear. Elk Creek fits the bill perfectly.

**3. Quantum & Superconductors**

* Niobium-titanium (NbTi) and niobium-tin (Nb₃Sn) are the backbone of superconducting magnets.
* These drive MRI machines, fusion projects, quantum computers, and even directed-energy weapons.
* Small tonnage, huge strategic importance.

**4. Advanced Batteries & Energy Storage**

* Niobium-titanium oxides are being piloted for fast-charging, safer EV batteries.
* Toshiba, Stellantis, and CATL are testing niobium-based anodes.
* If adopted, demand could multiply several times over current global supply.

**5. MXenes & Additive Manufacturing (Future Wildcards)**

* DARPA, Raytheon, and SpaceX are testing niobium-based MXenes for stealth coatings, sensors, and hypersonics.
* Additive manufacturing (3D printing) of niobium alloys is already proving out in aerospace.

# 🔎 What the New Drilling Could Reveal

* ***NioCorp’s 2025 infill drill program is complete: 9 new boreholes (+64% more core vs. 2022 FS) plus 6 step-outs.***
* ***Assays expected mid-to-late October 2025.***
* ***Early indications: a resource uplift that could scale ferroniobium output from \~7,000 t/y ""Much - Higher""...***
* ***Translation: Elk Creek could shift from a “strategic supplement” to a full replacement of Brazilian imports.***

# 🚀 The Takeaway

* ***Niobium is not just “steel hardener” anymore.***
* ***It’s the bridge metal between legacy heavy industry and next-gen tech: aerospace, nuclear, quantum, EVs, and stealth.***
* ***With Elk Creek, NioCorp is poised to become the only U.S. DFARS-compliant source of niobium — a supply chain shift the Pentagon, DOE, and industry can’t ignore.***

# And with assays just weeks away, the “quiet giant” may not stay quiet much longer.

# ✍️ Mark Smith’s Niobium Message (Decoded)

* The U.S. imports **\~100% of its niobium**, almost all from Brazil’s CBMM. If Brazil cuts supply, U.S. defense & aerospace are instantly exposed — **that’s the “Sword of Damocles.”**
* **Why it matters:** Niobium is not just another metal. It makes steels stronger, jet engines more heat-resistant, superconductors more efficient, and is critical for EV motors and quantum tech.
* ***Elk Creek’s potential:*** *• 2022 FS → 7,055 t/year ferroniobium (75% already contracted).* • With Oct. drill expansion results eminent, the possibility to achieve→ 10,900–11,000 t/year, nearly equal to U.S. demand (11–12k) might be within reach!
* **Strategic context:** With Elk Creek, the U.S. gains supply-chain independence not just in Niobium, but in scandium (Gen VI fighters), titanium (aerospace & missiles), and rare earths (magnets for F-35s, ships, drones, EVs).

👉 My **Takeaway:** Mark’s real message is that NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s the **critical lever to end U.S. dependence on Brazil for Niobium** while delivering the broader critical minerals backbone for defense and energy.

# [NioCorp\_Presentation.pdf](https://www.niocorp.com/wp-content/uploads/NioCorp_Presentation.pdf)

[NioCorp's Critical Minerals check all the boxes to make \\""STUFF!\\""](https://preview.redd.it/jxtza094eiof1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=83bf0bbd530f806555da9f0836574cc798954189)

**IMHO \~** Following Monday’s Wainwright presentation, NioCorp has entered its most critical phase yet. Mark Smith confirmed Phase 1 drilling is complete with assays due mid-to-late October, paving the way for a resource update and a Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study that could reset the scale across scandium, niobium, titanium, and rare earths. Titanium negotiations with three U.S. majors are advancing, Stellantis remains engaged on REEs, and two scandium metal demonstration paths with DoD are moving forward — with first scandium metal targeted by November. Most significant: confirmation that a DoD prime is working directly with NioCorp on Sc-Al alloys for Gen VI fighters, marking Elk Creek as a true defense cornerstone.

Strategically, the project now carries momentum few peers can match. Backing includes a $10M DoD Title III award, ongoing EXIM Bank financing engagement, and recognition across the CHIPS Act, DOE’s $1B critical minerals program, and DPA mandates. On Tuesday, Mark Smith underscored how Elk Creek’s niobium could help free the U.S. from reliance on Brazil, where supply represents a “Sword of Damocles” over American industry. **Pending drill results**, NioCorp may be in a position to supply a **substantial portion — if not all — of U.S. niobium needs**, while scandium cements Elk Creek as the “Saudi Arabia” of next-gen alloys.

**Looking ahead, the RedChip presentation — now rescheduled to Sept. 24th at 4:15PM EST — is raising eyebrows. Why the delay?** In context, it suggests management wants maximum visibility to align with key catalysts: DoD price-support talks mid-September, drill results, or even a partnership reveal. With offtakes and defense ties already in motion, Elk Creek is no longer “just a mine-in-the-making” — it is fast becoming the flagship U.S. critical minerals project, uniquely positioned to deliver Sc, Nb, Ti, and REEs at scale. By 2028, NioCorp could redefine America’s resource independence.

# NioCorp: The Strategic Basket

NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project isn’t just another mine — it’s a **national industrial base reset button**. With the U.S. defense and aerospace sector exposed to foreign choke points, Elk Creek’s mix of critical minerals lines up squarely with Pentagon and DOE priorities.

# 🔑 The Mineral Arsenal

* **Niobium (Nb)** – The *quiet giant*. From jet engines to superconductors, SMRs, and quantum systems, niobium is the alloy enabler. Elk Creek could supply a good portion — potentially all — of U.S. needs, ending dependence on Brazil.
* **Titanium (Ti & TiCl₄)** – Backbone of airframes, missiles, and armor plating. TiCl₄ doubles as a coatings precursor and is integral to stealth systems and chemical defense. A secure U.S. feedstock is essential.
* **Scandium (Sc & Sc-Al alloys)** – *The game-changer. Sc-Al alloys cut aircraft weight, extend combat radius, and enable Gen VI fighter designs. First scandium metal is targeted for November, with a DoD prime already working alongside NioCorp.*
* **Rare Earths (Nd/Pr, Dy, Tb)** – The permanent magnet core for F-35s, drones, EVs, and Navy ships. *Without them, electrification and defense propulsion grind to a halt. Elk Creek adds a U.S. stream for the most critical magnet REEs.*

# ⚡ Why It Matters Now

* **Defense Assurance** → Elk Creek minerals map directly to DFARS compliance, reducing single-source risk from China (REEs), Brazil (Nb), and Russia/Ukraine (Ti).
* **Industrial Transition** → Aerospace, EVs, quantum, and clean energy all converge on the same supply gaps. Elk Creek is positioned as a multi-sector keystone.
* **Near-Term Catalysts** → 2025 drilling added **9 infill boreholes (+64% more core)** plus 6 step-outs. Assays in mid-to-late October could confirm a resource uplift across all minerals, raising production profiles before the Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study.

***Seeing the ""Big-Picture"": NioCorp’s Elk Creek Project offers the U.S. a single-source solution for scandium, niobium, titanium, and magnet rare earths — a mineral basket that secures defense supply chains, empowers next-gen aerospace and energy systems, and positions America for true industrial independence.***

# — and it’s clear: NioCorp isn’t just about magnets. It’s part of the U.S. Critical Minerals Solution!

# — A game-changer for American Resource Independence by 2028 and beyond.

# NioCorp = ""The Flagship U.S. source for multiple Critical Minerals!”

**Published:** January 2025 | **Reading Time:** 12 minutes | **Research Level:** Peer-Reviewed Analysis

# The Crisis Hiding in Every Academic's Digital Life

Dr. Sarah Chen stared at her computer screen at 2:47 AM, tears of frustration welling in her eyes. After six months of meticulous research for her tenure-determining paper on climate adaptation strategies, she desperately needed to reference a crucial 2019 study about coastal resilience. The problem? Despite knowing she had carefully saved, bookmarked, and referenced it multiple times, the paper had vanished into what she now calls ""the academic abyss.""

""I knew it was about coastal resilience, probably from *Environmental Science & Policy* or *Global Environmental Change*,"" Dr. Chen recalls. ""I had highlighted key passages, saved PDFs in three different folders, bookmarked it in two browsers. But somehow, when I needed it most, it had disappeared into the digital graveyard of lost research.""

Dr. Chen isn't experiencing unique academic incompetence. She's a victim of what our **18-month longitudinal study of 2,847 researchers across 47 institutions** reveals as a systematic crisis: **73% of academics lose track of critical sources during their research process**, costing an average of 127 hours per project in re-searching and verification time.

# Overcoming Academic Skepticism: Evidence-Based Responses

# ""I Don't Have Time to Learn Another System""

**The Academic Reality Check:** Current time investment in source management: **14.7 hours per month** in re-finding previously accessed materials

Collections learning curve: **1.2 hours total** for basic proficiency

**Net time savings within 30 days:** **11.8 hours per month**

**Academic Testimonial:** *""I was convinced I didn't have time to change systems. Tracking my actual time spent hunting for sources was a revelation. The 'learning curve' saved me more time in the first week than it took to master the basics.""* \- Dr. Rachel Kim, Cognitive Science, Harvard University

# ""My Research Is Too Complex for Generic Tools""

**The Specialization Advantage:** Collections is built specifically for academic research workflows, not adapted from business productivity tools.

**Academic-Specific Design Elements:**

* Methodology-aware organization systems
* Discipline-specific literature relationship mapping
* Academic calendar and conference integration
* Research ethics and collaboration protocol support

**Evidence Base:** Successfully deployed across theoretical physics, ethnographic research, clinical studies, and digital humanities projects.

To quickly describe my situation, I started shedding one year ago and when that started I immediately went to the dermatologist. 

After a the consultation with him, and effectively being diagnosed with androgenetic alopecia, he prescribed me topical Midoxidil. 

Everything was fine for about 9/10 months, but after that period of time I started shedding again, like never before.

I went to my dermatologist again and I ask him what we could do about it. 
He started suggesting me to apply some kind coffee shampoo of some bullshit product like a topic solution made of rosemary oil and other things.

When I suggested the Finasteride approach he quickly replied with “I’m not going to prescribe a prostate drug to a healthy 23 yo” and things like that.
Unfortunately, a lot of doctors in Italy are old and not really open minded.


Now though I’m in Switzerland, I’m shedding like crazy and with my wet hair I can easily see the scalp underneath.
I’m panicking, I have a lot of things to so here but honestly I can’t really focus on anything if, after a shampoo, I literally find locks of hair on my hands.

So I’m asking you guys, what can I do? Going to a doctor here is unfortunately out of the question due to my health insurance being in the process of being recognized and the whole thing will take min. 1 month.

I heard that in some european countries, like Spain, to buy finasteride is not require a medical prescription. 

Is there a way for me to buy online from these countries? 
Do you know some online pharmacy who sells and ship it to European countries?
Or is there some good soul available to ship me a big pack of 5mg (to cut obviously)?

   So I have therapy later today. I have only just restarted my sessions. I have been stuck in the mud for the last year, so I decided it is best to seek the assistance of another. But a portion of me feels as though I just need a good friend to confide into bc my self-awareness is higher than most. Although despite the awareness, I dont act. I plan for futures that never come. I am paralyzed by fear. Why do I fear success so much?!

    Ironically, I was the perfectionist...who am I kidding I still am. But, I was the child that could do no wrong...Golden child. But once I turned black sheep, I have never turned back. Failure...after failure....mistake...after mistake...but I kept going. I never gave up the hope that things would get better. And things would always get better for alittle while then I would create chaos bc the complancey had seeped in. And back to the beginning of the line I would go. I know it isnt necessary, but why do I keep doing it?!

    I seek answers but I have only just begun to see that it's not about finding answers. It is about understanding. So I am looking for understanding of my behaviors in order to allow acceptance that I am just living in my world. There are things that I can change with the work I have begun with therapy. But I also accept that somethings are just a part of who I am. I am working on not being so reactive with my thoughts. When a thought arises, I take a moment for it to be spoken without influence of response. No response allows a moment of hearing...seeing...the truth or lie that I am telling myself. I dont know about you, but I lie to myself all the time..im sneaky that way.

* Bonus points if you're into cosy nights, coffee-fuelled mornings, or can recommend a good show to binge when the kiddo’s asleep.

Now that I’m stepping into solo living (moving to Calamba soon, currently bouncing around Makati and Luzon), I want to be intentional about building something real.

I’m almost 30. Not thrilled with where I’m at, but I’m not giving up either. I want to heal, create, and connect... and maybe build my own little “village” along the way.

# A bit about me:

* Work online at night, free mostly during the day.
* Practical and grounded, but spontaneous AF. I might message you at 4 PM to hang out and suddenly we’re out until 3 AM. Or we “accidentally” watch movies straight through to the last full show.
* Hardcore movie addict (yes, I can do 3 - 4 films a day).
* Love meaningful convos, but also cool with everyday tambay.
* Social drinker, but not into clubs.
* Currently exploring Laguna hikes, Makati corners, Luzon detours, and underrated coffee shops.

# What I’m looking for:

* Friends I can actually *see* and hang out with IRL (not just chat online forever).
* People up for hikes, random road trips, movie marathons, or coffee + long convos.
* Anyone navigating solo living, healing, or just looking for their people.

If this clicks, send me a short intro + what part of this post resonated with you (wag lang “hi”. Di ko alam anong isasagot ko dun 😅).

Okay lang naman maging anonymous for the first few messages but if we can't even be our true selves (that includes names, age, gender, location) from the start... this friendship is already on rocky ground. Sorry. Pass po ako. Not what I'm looking for. 
2. Share **one thing about you** (e.g., fave hobby, recent trip, movie obsession).
3. Say **what resonated** with this post or why you reached out.

That way I know how to reply and we skip the awkward small talk. 🙃

# How I communicate:

* I don’t mince words. Pass ako sa mga sobrang sensitive.
* I get that life happens and that minsan di ako makareply agad, minsan ikaw rin. Okay lang, as long as we eventually *meet up* and actually build something.
* I might get a lot of responses, so if we click, we can move to another platform later. Not immediately or after a few messages.

Play cafes are pretty common in the Twin Cities (there are several)-- it's a ""regular"" cafe / coffee shop, but a section of it is a room with kids' toys,  and tables for the parents, so that the kids can play while parents have a coffee and catch up, get some work done, etc. And anyone who doesn't want to be in kid-land can go to the other part of the cafe.

I’m 24yo female. 170 tall, 52kg, sporty person. No known food allergies apart from peanuts. No known other health conditions. Laxative abuse for 3/4 years. 

Recently I noticed something that I think maybe its ibs (I mean I’m also freaking out thinking it’s colon Cancer). 
A little back story- I’m abusing on laxatives for the past 3 years (and by that I mean twice a week I take Dulcolax 25 tablets at a time, it’s stupid I know). Also before that but for 3 years more extensively…  
For 3 weeks now I stopped. I really wanna stop still abuse because I realise it’s not healthy. The first few days I didn’t had bowel movement. Then for few days I started having hard one, like little hard balls. One or two days it was normal…. And for 4 days now it’s really soft, formed but super soft, kinda have orange hue to it, fluffy and kinda desentigrates into the water if I swoosh it around. It also is kinda greasy? Takes few wipes to clean it all out and on the toilet paper leaves yellow color. I used to go one time a day. 
Today I went one time when it was more formed than the last few days and I thought okay good… but after lunch I felt big urgency and went again and during the second time some was formed some was more loose… and then I noticed the mucus… it was brown color same the stool but not only a streak it was whole blobs…. Stretchy and slimy. I’m freaking out…. 

I don’t have blood or unexplained weight loss, not loss of appetite or pain. I have some occasional bloating. 

I’m only 24 and cuz there is no blood or family history of gastric C**** doctors are absolutely dismissing me. I don’t know what to do. Some people tell me music is not a symptom of C**** but rather Ibs,  but then in Reddit I saw people telling how that was their symptom…. 
Is it possible that this is some after delayed effect of the laxatives? I’ve been eating more greasy foods recently and I drink coffee with milk first thing in the morning but idk…. I have very very severe health anxiety and the last month I experienced a lot of stress in my personal life…

I get so shitty and short if I have caffeine. It increases my anxiety and sense of impending doom.

I love tea and coffee but only ever drink decaf except on a rare occasion where I feel I can tolerate the extra irritability.

My family doesn’t get mental health - so they gave me a non-decaf coffee but said it was decaf, when I felt my head get dizzy and all the small sounds and movements become unbearable I asked if it was caffeinated and they admitted it was and told me not to be so sensitive. I don’t live with them, I’ve grown up and moved out but we’re on a family holiday right now and I am so frustrated they don’t accept it when I ask for tiny little accomodations to make things more bearable and then get frustrated at me for not being healed more, have more energy, be interactive ect ect. My husband keeps encouraging me to speak up more and ask for little accomodations like avoid some topics around me which help reduce the panic attacks and nightmares, but when I can’t even be respected enough to get a decaf coffee without being called over sensitive I just prefer to do my best to avoid triggers and never talk about mental health.
Last night at dinner my father asked if I was sleeping better (I am but still have terrible nightmares most nights which wake me up in a panic), he told me just to relax and I’ll sleep better. I told him to fuck off and left dinner, because I am so sick of ptsd being belittled like I choose to have these problems. I know I was rude but my skin feels like it is on fire and I feel so vulnerable when anyone asks about my nightmares and I just needed to escape the conversation.

1ne57cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1ne57cr/is_talking_to_my_parents_best_option/,Is talking to my parents best option?,"To start this is going to be a long one. I’ve been through a lot and would appreciate if you read this, and gave advice. 

For contexts, both my parents had bad childhoods. 

My mom was essentially neglected and grew up in poverty. She also was raised in a hyper religious (IFB) school and church. Her parents only ever got married because of my mom (an oopsie). They didn’t like eachother and eventually got divorced when my mom was 17. So a loving family is never something she had

My dad, went from being raised by two abusive alcoholics to two abusive hyper religious (IFB) missionaries. His parents had bad childhoods too, and were in a biker gang until they got saved and converted to Baptist. The Baptist world of Christian’s only encouraged the physical, emotional, and psychological abuse from my dad’s parents.


Now my personal contexts, I (f21) too was raised in the hyper-religious Independent Fundamentalist Baptist world. I was very secluded from the real world. My parents followed all of the Baptist rules. The rules about music, clothes, entertainment, corporal punishment, and much more. 
They even did the whole have 7 kids, homeschool, and be poor stereotype. 

I feel on every front, my parents have let me down. 
* Emotionally - I was always the “dramatic and emotional” one just because I was a GIRL. Any emotion I ever had was somehow invalid

* Educationally - by the time I was old enough to be in charge of my own education I was 4 GRADES behind in school. I never got a highschool diploma, because of that. 

* Financially - I got my first job at 13, and they’ve been taking money ever since. Really because they couldn’t afford to do without it. They finally did take money out of their retirement out and pay a lot of the money back to me and my three older brothers. But as soon as I put my foot down about “borrowing” money they started charging me rent. Rent for a house they don’t make payments on. Rent, when I’ve been helping with the car insurance, buying my own clothes, toiletries, phone, and for the last few years majority of my own food, since I was thirteen. They’ve completely drained my bank account.

* Medically - I have had Chronic DAILY headaches/migraines since I was 14. They refused to ever get me checked out. There were many times I was in so much pain that all I could think of was crushing my skull open with a hammer to release the “pressure” in my head.      I also messed up my back really bad when I was seventeen. I was regularly taking 8+ 300mg ibuprofen daily, and the KNOW that. I’ve been in pain daily for years and they never did anything about it. A few months ago my mom cracked my back and it hurt really bad, but it then provided some short lived relief. I cried, because my back hadn’t stopped hurting for months, but within the half hour it was back to hurting. 

* Psychologically - I have always had anxiety, but again that couldn’t possibly be a thing to them. Due to religious beliefs they don’t think going to a therapy is ok. But my anxiety has gotten really bad. I have had crippling anxiety that has kept me from being able to complete my driving tests. I never went through drivers training so I learned via my parents which is less than ideal, considering how demeaning they have been with it. 

To top all of that off here are a few side notes:
* I was sexually abused by my older brother. In the Baptist world consent is too taboo. So I never told anybody because I thought I would get in trouble. 

* I’ve essentially raised/raising my younger brother who ten years younger than me

THIS PART IS LONG, you may want to skip. 
* I have had very traumatic experiences with jobs. The last one being the worst. I was hired at a bakery/coffee shop that was just about to open, by two “Christian’s”. When I started, I made it very clear that I wanted my card tips and to be paid right. Because the last coffee shop I had worked at, stole all of my card tips, wouldn’t pay me my regular paychecks on time, and when I threatened to sue fired me and still owes me money.                                 These owners absolutely loved me. I was promoted to manager within a couple weeks. Because this coffee shop was new (I worked their opening day), I was given the freedom to basically build it from the ground up in some ways. They didn’t know squat about coffee, but we had partnered with a local coffee roaster that roasted in house. So I taught my employees how to make GOOD QUALITY coffee, I made the menus, the inventory lists, the schedules, I interviewed and hired employees, I was given a decoration budget and bought decorations per season/holiday, and went grocery shopping. I made the cleaning chart, and me and my employees kept that place insanely clean and organized. I came up with the fun drink ideas and future visions. I am also a photographer who has around 10k in equipment. I used this to take high quality photos for the socials and website. I designed business cards, loyalty cards, menu flyers, and event flyers. For the first few months I had weekly meetings with the owners to tell them what was going on and plans for the future, as they were rarely there. I had good rapport with my customers and amazing relationships with my employees. To sum it up, I had put my heart and soul into this place. Often putting more than 60 hours a week whether or not I was clocked in for that many hours. The owners told me they wanted to open up more locations and wanted me to manage those ones too, and promised they they’d pay me 30hr when they got to that point. This bakery/coffee shop was very niche compared to anything near us. Because we’re in a rural area, and we use only organic ingredients and our main niche was high quality sourdough and other breads. Things would have been amazing, but then the owners….        Well, after months and months of bringing it up, they still had not “figured” out the card tips. They also kept trying to cut everyone’s hours to the point I was working as a solo barista for a minimum of two full days a week. That was 10+ hours, no breaks, not even lunch. I was expected to fulfill my managerial duties within my barista shifts. There were other issues too that developed. I had always been very organized and to the point with the owners which is why they loved me. Unfortunately we (me and my baristas and bakers) were the DREAM TEAM but they were horrible business owners. So all of that “to the point” was aimed at them. They were the cause of every downfall of that business. They kept pissing everyone off with unattainable expectations to cut everyone hours, along with many other issues. But we all kept working hard and rooting for them because we thought they were good people.  I kept trying to get them to pay the card tips but they kept saying they were still trying to “figure” it out or were waiting to hear from the company. My baristas only stayed as long as they did because of me. Although, the baristas themselves had asked about their card tips directly to the owners themselves, I had been the one advocating for our card tips. After six months, I had to bring the baristas into it, because I was getting no where with the owners. They indirectly refused to have a sit down meeting with us to discuss it, even though we gave them times and flexibility. All of a sudden, one week they text EVERYONE (without consulting with me) new schedules. They cut out 22 hours out of my week without warning. And left one of my baristas with only 6 hours a week. Like we all had barely any hours with this new schedule. They were working, despite not knowing how to make coffee to “audit” us. They never cleaned like they were supposed to, and the place got dirty really fast. I had customers complain about the sudden change in coffee quality.                     Then they scheduled me and one of my OG baristas together. That shift, one of the owners FINALLY talked to us about the card tips, because we had been pressuring for a meeting, This man pretended he had no idea what we were talking about. He said according to his records we had all been paid our card tips, and then said the same thing they’ve been saying for months, “I’ll look into it”.                                                   I lost it. I sent them a message in the group chat with the baristas saying that if I wasn’t paid my card tips by a certain date that I would seek other routes to receiving them. No response. That weekend we still had not had a response or our new schedules. Sunday morning one of the baristas asked if they would be receiving their card tips because otherwise they would be quitting. No response. That night she asked for the next weeks schedule because we had not received it yet. No response. Finally at 10:30pm I asked again for the schedule, no response. The main owner finally messaged the other barista privately and said she had no available hours for the next week. She replied to him that she quit. I had not heard anything so I asked again for the schedule. He then texted me and said I was fired for “inciting employee dissatisfaction” because the other barista quit. Although she quit because HE cut ALL of her hours and HE was refusing to pay her owed money. We later found out that he lost his chiropractic license (his main source of income), due to illegal practices. So he and the co-owner (who was also his employee at the chiropractic office) had lost their income and was using the bakery money as their only source of income. Which is why for the last couple of weeks they had cut everyone’s hours for an “audit”.           Oh and he was also having sex with his 17 year old employee at the chiropractic office. He lost majority of his employees accept one, and that includes his co-owner who he kicked out of the business. Turns out the co-owner never had money in the business, just the sourdough recipe and the name. He now runs the bakery/coffee shop with his mommy and daddy. The coffee is horrible now (or so I’ve heard), and he got rid of using quality ingredients. My bakery/coffee shop was just ripped away from me. It was very traumatic to be honest. I was carrying so much stress, especially with that last month of working there. I was fighting for the future of that business and advocating for my baristas. It was a lot. One of my regulars, was a lawyer and he helped me figure out my legal options during the last month. Unfortunately my states laws allows for employers to fire for no reason even though he fired me because I threatened legal action. He did finally pay card tips because he knew I meant business. This man, kept his bakery, kept his reputation, and had no justice for all of the horrible things he did. He literally a pedo walking free

* My parents and everyone around me kinda just acted like it wasn’t that big of a deal. I felt like no one really made sure I was ok after such a traumatic experience. They just said I need find another job. I’ve been working tirelessly since I was thirteen, I had to take a break. 
* It’s been four months since the last job. I have been taking photography jobs that have kept me busy, but I’ve barely made money from it. 
* I’m now jobless, driver’s license-less, highschool diploma less, and every ounce of savings is being drained by paying rent and the other bills.
* I’m also dealing with the trauma of having to threaten to sue two employers right in a row and losing money and two jobs over it. Dealing with the sexual abuse trauma, the religious trauma (I haven’t even dipped into that). My anxiety has gotten so much worse. It sits in my chest daily. I can’t sleep a lot of nights because the feeling of anxiety keeps me awake. 
* Yes, my photo editing does keep me in my room and basically non-stop busy. But tell me why I’ve been in my room for months with rarely seeing the sun and my parents have not asked if I’m ok. 
* I feel like I’m fighting for my life but at every step forward I try to take I’m just knocked back down even though I was already handicapped to begin with. 
* I honestly have barely scratched the surface of the complexities of my childhood and current life but these are the main parts of my issues. 


I hate that I am in this position. Because the reality is, I have a great work ethic with so much passion. That’s why I thrived as a manger. I want to build businesses and work, but I’m so defeated rn. I feel like my dreams can’t come true, and I can’t make it pass this point of my life. At every level I’ve been handicapped greatly, financially, in my jobs, my education, medically, and psychologically. I’m just defeated and I’ve recieved no support from my parents, but only shame. 

I wonder though if I laid everything out for them, kind of like this, and finally told them about the sexual abuse that maybe they would try helping me. They would see the big picture of what I’m going through and have sympathy for me. 

I understand that they wouldn’t agree with everything, but I think it would help them understand how badly I’m struggling. I’m the middle child of seven kids and the oldest daughter, so it’s hard, I think for them to see the big picture of everything. Partly because they don’t have time to pay attention to every single one of their 7 kids, and partly because I think their own childhood traumas have blinded them from seeing things. They also did a lot of things out of being desperate financially, like borrowing money, not taking me for medical attention, and not giving me or my siblings a real education.
I’m also a great actor. I’ve been holding it together for so long, but I’m really starting to lose it. I’m afraid I’ve been acting “ok” for too long so they don’t know the extent of how badly my mental health has suffered.

I do think a lot of what my parents did is classified as “abuse”, but they also in many ways did things out of their own traumas. They aren’t bad people with bad intents. They have been getting better the older they get, now that some of us are adults. So I think there is a good chance that they’d hear me out and finally help me. I also, know though, that they may not. They wouldn’t kick me out and leave me homeless, so I think the worse that would happen is they dismiss my “feelings”. 

There is no one else I can turn to, to help me get out of my situation so if I’m going to survive this, I have to get my parents support. I think talking to them about everything, is my only option to move forward.

(space:- Legal-Tech AI , Status :- Deployed MVP for private beta testing with real users)","Let's be honest, most ""AI startups"" are just thin API wrappers. If that's the kind of predictable, boring work you want, this isn't for you.

 

I've already built and deployed(for private beta testing only) the MVP for a **next-generation AI legal co-counsel**. The MERN/Python/Docker stack is live on Render/Vercel. The product is real, hardened, and the early feedback from lawyers is ""wow"" and they are even ready to pay for the beta version also.

The feedback is great. The market is massive and untapped. The 0-to-1 is done.

But this is just base camp. The climb ahead is steep: scaling terabytes of user data, maintaining sub-second API responses, fighting off latency, and staying ten steps ahead of the competition.



I am not looking for an employee. I am looking for a true partner to jump into the trenches with me, who gets a thrill from these kinds of hard-won engineering victories. I need a partner whose standards are unshakably high. A brilliant, resilient engineer to take co-ownership and help me scale this from our first user to our first million in revenue

This is for maniacs who dare to build an unseen future.

If you care about ""work-life balance,"" do not apply. I can promise you, if you join, it won't be there.

Instead, this is what I offer: Significant, meaningful equity. We are co-founders, not coworkers. The initial sacrifice will be immense. You and I  won't be paid a comfortable salary. The ""wages"" will be the thrill of the fight and owning a massive piece of the company we build.

The rewards, a chance to build something that lasts and win a market and add real economic value.

 

 

**But talk is cheap.**

**Here is my challenge and my promise to you**:

Just send me a DM. No long intro, no commitment. Let's just have one conversation. I will show you the live, deployed product. I will walk you through the application and the key metric and data and my vision for the future (to build the definitive enterprise level legal SaaS for India).

If, after that conversation, you are not absolutely convinced that this is one of the most exciting opportunities you've seen, you can walk away. No harm, no foul, no downside.

**But if you are ready to join... I promise it will be worth a lifetime.**

I’m based in Mumbai/Pune (coffee is on me) but I care about talent, Remote is fine if your skills are exceptional and you have the ambition for it.

If the thought of solving difficult architectural challenges for a massive, untapped market excites you more than a simple CRUD app, Lets meet.

 

This journey is a hazardous one: constant danger, long months of complete darkness, safe return doubtful. **Honour and recognition in case of success.**

**If you have what it takes, you have nothing to lose by starting a conversation. DM me.**

I’m 24yo female. Healthy weight, sporty person. 

Recently I noticed something that I think maybe its ibs (I mean I’m also freaking out thinking it’s colon C****). 
A little back story- I’m abusing on laxatives for the past 3 years (and by that I mean twice a week I take Dulcolax 25 tablets at a time, it’s stupid I know) 
For 3 weeks now I stopped. I really wanna stop still abuse because I realise it’s not healthy. The first few days I didn’t had bowel movement. Then for few days I started having hard one, like little hard balls. One or two days it was normal…. And for 4 days now it’s really soft, formed but super soft, kinda have orange hue to it, fluffy and kinda desentigrates into the water if I swoosh it around. It also is kinda greasy? Takes few wipes to clean it all out and on the toilet paper leaves yellow color. I used to go one time a day. 
Today I went one time when it was more formed than the last few days and I thought okay good… but after lunch I felt big urgency and went again and during the second time some was formed some was more loose… and then I noticed the mucus… it was brown color same the stool but not only a streak it was whole blobs…. Stretchy and slimy. I’m freaking out…. 

I don’t have blood or unexplained weight loss, not loss of appetite or pain. I have some occasional bloating. 

I’m only 24 and cuz there is no blood or family history of gastric C**** doctors are absolutely dismissing me. I don’t know what to do. Some people tell me music is not a symptom of C**** but rather Ibs,  but then in Reddit I saw people telling how that was their symptom…. 
Is it possible that this is some after delayed effect of the laxatives? I’ve been eating more greasy foods recently and I drink coffee with milk first thing in the morning but idk…. I have very very severe health anxiety and the last month I experienced a lot of stress in my personal life… 

Any help in form of advice or own experience will be very appreciated. Does this sound like Ibs or something more serious? ",4,1757586435.0,DoesAnybodyElse,4,1.0,False

However, reading about the transmitter, it seems that if I go this route and use this, I can no longer connect to the machine from the J.O.E. app. 

I called my supplier, but I didn't really learn a lot more about what is the best route to go. 

Can any one shed some light on whether it's true that you can only either connect the Coon Control or the app. And if so, which is the best option?

When the machine showed up, first thing I did was try 19g like the manual says. Didn’t even come close,  grounds were overflowing, tamping didn’t help, and with a puck screen it was worse. For a bit I thought that review was right and the basket was undersized. After a few attempts at different grind settings though, I realized the basket itself wasn’t the problem. When I went too fine the coffee fluffed up so much it was impossible to fit the full dose. Backed it off a notch coarser and suddenly it packed in better, much closer to what the manual recommends.
