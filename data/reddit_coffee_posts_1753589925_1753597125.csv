Turns on his lifelong friend Boomhauer for the sake of Patch only for that to go horribly wrong, whines like an absolute child about an empty carton of grapefruit juice, a slightly displaced coffee table and an upside down roll of toilet paper, fails to incite a riot at Strickland on the basis of 2 boxes for charcoal but no propane option on the application forms for a fcking barbecue at the county fair, acts like he is better than and above anybody who has ever made use of Workers Comp and unemployment as an institution, the list goes on and on. Christ I hope he has mellowed out by a factor of 50 for the revival because I want to keep coming back to the show on account of his and everyone else’s endearing qualities as opposed to just kind of hate watching on a subconscious level where it’s like man, what is this uptight jerk going to shit on next

# [1.1 A preface to the preface]()

Life looked a bit different in 2009. As a young pediatrician, I felt like the king of the world. I was about to start my second residency in infectious diseases and thought I was invincible.

Then came that phone call. It wasn't even meant for me.

The call was between Prof. P.Y. and Prof. D.G. At its core was P.Y.'s need to find a replacement lecturer for the parasitology course for second-year medical students, due to Prof. Y.A.'s imminent retirement. P.Y., who was then the head of the medical school, saw he was in trouble and immediately called the least suitable person for the task. He knew very well that D.G. was lazy and knew nothing about parasites, but he also knew very well that he could impose anything he wanted on D.G., and D.G. had no means of resistance.

I was casually passing through the corridor next to D.G.'s room, where I constantly hung out. A silly smile on my lips and a deep need to read another 500 unnecessary pages in Feigin or Mandell (the textbooks for infectious diseases in children and adults, respectively). I had no idea how my life was about to change completely.

I could hear snippets of the conversation. It was clear D.G. was in distress, and the hundred-kilo hammer on his head was causing him slight discomfort. Then the unbelievable happened. Deus ex machina. D.G. spotted my clumsy figure dancing in the hallway and immediately jumped up – ""Shalom, you have a phone call."" The idiot that is me immediately replied, ""No problem,"" took the receiver, and brought it to my ear. ""Yes, P.Y., what's up?"" The end.

I won't bore you with the details. P.Y. commanded me, in the most polite and friendly tone he could muster, to attend a meeting with Y.A. in the parasitology lab to replace him in delivering the course in question.

A week later, I was walking happily and light-heartedly, with septol in my eye (don't ask) that made me grimace and look like a pervert, on my way to the pathology building. On the second floor, in the parasitology lab, Prof. Y.A. was waiting for me.

It's worth understanding a few basic things about the situation at that time:

* I have just finished my pediatrics residency. My knowledge of parasitology was close to zero and included memories of missing a class or two due to military reserve duty and my father's memorial service. That's it.
* Parasites sounded to me like something related to bizarre jungle diseases. Something with swollen testicles and terrifying pictures of worms peeking out of all sorts of holes and orifices in the body. (Yes, I know I was stupid, and I hope it's mostly passed).
* Prof. Y.A. didn't know me at all, certainly didn't remember me from my student days (a grade of 85 in the course, thanks for asking).
* My professional aspirations were limited to completing my infectious diseases residency; I was happy to be the youngest and most enthusiastic in the group.
* I had no teaching experience at all and only a vague idea in my head of what I wanted to say in the conversation.

I entered the room. Y.A. offered me coffee. I refused. He tried to understand why I was twitching as if suffering from St. Vitus' Dance. I didn't have the energy or desire to explain to him that I had gotten septol (alcohol-based hand sanitizer) in my eye a few minutes ago in the ward, while washing my hands for the thousandth time that morning, as usual.

He got straight to the point and immediately surprised me. Yes, of course, he needed me to teach the course. But that wasn't the main thing. Before his retirement, the sleepy Iraqi realized he hadn't secured a successor for managing the parasitology lab. In fact, he had found a successor, Dr. D., but had a fight with him a few weeks before the end. Now he dropped the bombshell and asked me to take over the lab management. I chuckled, contorted, grimaced, didn't understand. What did that have to do with me, for God's sake?!

I had never considered a career in a lab. After all, I was a clinician burdened with shifts and sleepless nights filled with resuscitations and hallucinations. What did I have to do with this?!

I explained that it wouldn't happen, but gladly (a blatant lie, but I tried to minimize damage and retreat quickly) I would teach the course starting next year. The conversation quickly died down; one could see the light fade from Y.A.'s face and his enthusiasm vanish. We quickly agreed on a course outline, he handed me some files, and we parted ways.

Since then, I have been teaching the parasitology course every year with great enthusiasm, both mine and the students. This book summarizes the course as it is – a rollercoaster ride of dubious science (all my knowledge comes from self-study), eternal stand-up shows (I have a need to make people laugh in lectures, otherwise I get bored), and countless experiences with parasites. I learned to love the profession, the patients, and yes, even the parasites. They are my closest friends. I try to know everything about them, to laugh at them, to understand them, and to successfully kill them. All out of mutual respect for these repulsive creatures.

I'm sure you'll find interest in the crazy journey you're about to embark on. Parasitology is fascinating. The most fascinating of all. Believe me.

And as for Y.A.'s offer to manage the lab? In retrospect, the best offer I ever received. I regret not taking it in real-time.

‎
‎I still remember the house we've dreamed about.
‎Not too big, because you said big houses scared you 
‎you didn’t want to feel alone when I wasn’t around.
‎You said, “Let’s keep it small, just enough for us, simple only, quiet, full of laughter's, full of love.""
‎And God, that was all I ever wanted too.
‎
‎You were always the planner.
‎You told me you’d be the one to design the house 
‎Even if I said I'd be an engineer someday,
‎i know you already had it in your head: where the garden would be, where we’d eat breakfast,
‎where we’d sit and watch the rain from the window.
‎I didn’t even question it, I just smiled and thought,
‎“As long as she’s in it, that house will always feel like home.”
‎
‎You wanted a dog, a Doberman.
‎Tough on the outside, gentle inside.
‎Just like you, honestly.
‎You said we’d get one because you weren’t ready for kids yet,
‎and you were scared of pregnancy.
‎And I told you we could wait, no rush.
‎I would’ve waited years if it meant seeing you safe, happy, and unafraid.
‎
‎But you also had plans for our kids already.
‎Three.
‎Two older boys and the youngest a girl,
‎or the opposite, 
‎One older girl and two younger boys,
‎sho she'd beat up the two
‎
‎I know the thought of you describing how the older ones would protect the youngest.
‎I remember feeling your heart light up at that idea,
‎like you already knew what our future would look like.
‎And I let myself believe it too.
‎
‎I still imagine what that life would’ve been.
‎Waking up to you making coffee,
‎a Doberman sleeping at our feet,
‎our garden blooming (because I watered it, not you, of course).
‎I’d joke about you forgetting the plants again,
‎and you’d roll your eyes and laugh, just like always.
‎
‎There’d be noise in the house, toys on the floor,
‎little footsteps running around,
‎your voice calling everyone to the table.
‎And even in the quiet, when the kids are asleep,
‎you and I would sit on the couch,
‎tired, maybe, but whole.
‎
‎But we never made it there.
‎
‎I guess fear crept in, mine, mostly.
‎My insecurities made you feel unsure.
‎And maybe you started to feel like the future we dreamed of was just that,
‎a dream.
‎
‎Maybe I held on too tightly, and in doing so, I made you feel trapped,
‎instead of safe.
‎
‎You deserved freedom.
‎You deserved peace.
‎I wanted to give you both, but I was still trying to heal the parts of me that kept breaking.
‎
‎Now you’re gone,
‎and all I have left are these little blueprints in my head.
‎A house that never stood.
‎A dog we never bought.
‎Three kids we never named.
‎A life that still breathes inside my chest like a ghost that doesn’t want to leave.
‎
‎I don’t know where you are now, or who you’re dreaming with.
‎But I hope wherever it is,
‎you’re safe.
‎Not alone in some too-big house.
‎Not scared.
‎
‎I hope you’re finding peace, even if it’s not with me.
‎I hope someone waters your garden.
‎And I hope one day, you get the life you wanted,
‎with the love you need.
‎
‎As for me, I’m learning to let go.
‎Slowly. Softly.
‎Not because I want to forget,
‎but because I need to breathe again.
‎
‎Goodbye, my palangga,
‎And thank you,
‎for dreaming with me,
‎even just for a little while.

“I’ll just take these boxes downstairs to the garage..”, I tell my boyfriend, Chase, putting another holiday serving platter in the cardboard box.

“I’ll take it for you sweetheart, I know how heavy all 100 of your Christmas platters are.” he says, smiling mischievously and kissing me on the cheek.

“Hey!”, I laugh, swatting his arm, “I want to be prepared if we ever have one of those Christmas parties like the movies where dozens of people come and I save Christmas somehow!”

He laughs, and picks up the box.

“You’re right, I need to be manifesting that for you.” He winks, and disappears down the stairs, shutting the door behind him.

My spring cleaning has run amuck in the house, but I think I’ve got the last of it sorted.

Our house isn’t huge, we have a 2 story house with 4 bedrooms. Beautiful exterior, I just wish it had more storage.

I smooth the bedspread on the (now cleaned) guest bedroom, and smile at the room, before closing the door behind me.

Chase is coming in from the garage when I come downstairs.

“Boxes all put away?”, I ask.

“Yes, but we officially can never buy anything else ever again.” He laughs, opening the fridge to grab a beer.

“Well when we get our next house, I need more storage. The attic is too small, and I want a basement. We can turn it into your man-cave too..”, I smile, wiggling my eyebrows.

He smiles at me, a lazy smile.

After 5 years together, he still gives me butterflies.

“Anything you want, sweetheart. And that goes for dinner too, what are you thinking?”, he leans back on the counter, opening a food delivery app on his phone.

“Chinese? I would love to learn how to make Mongolian Beef at home to save money, but unfortunately you do not love me for my cooking skills..”, I tell him, looking into the fridge with a sigh.

“Ah yes, how could I forget when you so infamously almost burned down this very kitchen the first time you came over. After you insisted you could cook us a whole meal?”, He sneaks up behind me and wraps his arms around me, making me squeal.

“See! I can’t possibly be your dream woman, I can’t even cook!”, I whine, between giggles.

He smooths my hair.

“I have everything I need.”, He says earnestly.

More butterflies.

Once our takeout comes, we are eating in front of the tv when I hear a tapping sound.

“Do you hear that?”, I ask.

“Hmm?”, Chase responds, not looking up from his takeout container.

“It’s a tapping sound.. Is it coming from the dining room?”, I put my food down, and get up to walk that way.

“Babe, I don’t hear anything. Could be a pipe, this house was old when I got it and it’s even older now!” He calls from the living room.

When I reach the dining room, I still hear it. I’m starting to pull out furniture to inspect when I hear a hard thump.

Then the tapping stops.

I rush back into the room, and Chase is picking up his beer bottle off the floor.

Foamy, brown liquid is now staining the rug.

“God, I’m so sorry. I reached for my beer and I knocked it off the table, could you grab me a towel?”, He asks, moving his food to the coffee table.

“Of course! I’ll be right back!”

I grab him a towel and we clean it together, comes right up.

“Did you figure out the tapping?”, He asks me, picking up our trash.

“Oh.. No I didn’t, must have been a pipe.”,  I respond, looking back towards the dining room.

He nods.

“If you want, I can call the plumber to come out and check everything. Just to make sure it’s not something important.”, He says, heading towards the kitchen.

“Oh no, I’m sure it’s fine. I’ll let you know if I hear it again.”, I smile.

*

Later that night, after we had gone to bed, I wake up with a startle.

I’m gasping, covered in sweat, and shakily looking for the switch to the lamp at my bedside table.

“Chase? Chase?”, I whisper.

The lamp flares to light.

Chase isn’t next to me.

“Chase?”, I say, a little louder.

Silence.

I get up, and walk to the bathroom. Sometimes when he can’t sleep, he will take a shower.

The bathroom is empty, but I take time to splash my face with water.

He must have wanted a midnight snack, he’s probably downstairs.

“Chase?”, I call out at normal volume.

I am just passing my doorway, heading towards the stairs, when I see Chase.

He’s halfway up, he looks relieved to see me.

“Sweetie, hey. Are you okay?”, He asks quickly, taking my hands and looking at my face.

“Oh, yes. I just had a nightmare, I think, I can’t even remember what it was about…”, I trail off, looking at him. 

He looks red, and like he broke a sweat running to the stairs.

“Are you alright?”, I ask.

“Yeah.. Yeah I’m good. Sorry, I went downstairs to watch tv and I must have dozed off. You calling my name woke me up and I thought you were hurt so I ran upstairs to check on you. My adrenaline is through the roof right now.”, He laughs, but it doesn’t meet his eyes.

“Oh honey,” I coo, “You’re my white knight, always trying to save me. What do you say.. We make use of that adrenaline..”

I playfully tease my finger on his shoulder.

He smiles and shakes his head.

“Oh I would love to, but I’m all frazzled right now. How about I take a shower and we snuggle instead?”, He asks, wrapping me into a hug.

“Of course, that’s probably the right idea.”, I respond.

Once he’s done in the shower, we do exactly that.

*

The next evening, Chase has his monthly work dinner. He’s an anesthesiologist, so the money is great, but his coworkers.. not so much.

“You sure you’ll be alright?”, He asks, checking his tie in our hallway mirror.

“Yes I’ll be fine,” I respond, we do this little routine every month, “I’ll catch up on all my obnoxious reality TV you hate.”

“Ah, I don’t know about that. TV is broken.”, He responds, still focusing on the mirror.

“Since when?”, I ask.

“Dinner yesterday, some of the beer splashed on the box. I’ll get a new one this weekend, don’t worry.”, He says smiling, turning towards me.

“But you were watching it last night, I thought. That’s why you came downstairs..”, I say, and it comes out sharper than I intend.

His expression doesn’t change.

“Oh, well yeah, I tried to come down to watch it. That’s when I noticed it was broken, so I fell asleep. Sorry, I thought I mentioned that.”, He explains with that easy smile.

“No worries, I’ll just read. Go knock them dead tonight, you always do!”, I say, giving him a good-luck kiss.

I wave at his car leaving the driveway, and I turn and go back to the living room.

I pick up my current book club read, and open up the next chapter.

I start to hear it again.

Tapping.

“Jesus, really?”, I say, putting my bookmark back in and heading to the dining room.

It’s softer tapping this time, but still steady.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

I take out my phone and send a message to Chase.

“Tapping is back, we should call plumber tomorrow.”

I put my phone in my pocket, and look around.

I pull up rugs, looking for any pipe leaking.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

“This is so weird..”, I mumble.

I look at the China hutch, it’s been there since I moved in. It’s ugly as sin but Chase says it’s a pain to move. It belonged to his grandmother, I think.

If any pipe is broken, it’s behind that old thing.

I push my shoulder into it, and start to scoot it.

To my shock, it moves pretty easily.

I move it a few inches, when my phone starts to ring.

It’s Chase’s ringtone.

I hit the green answer button.

“Hey, sorry I know you’re driving..”, I start.

“Hey!”, He says, “So the tapping is back? Same room?”

“Yeah, I’ve been moving stuff around to see if there’s any water leakage but I don’t see anything..”, I trail off, looking at the floor next to the massive hutch I just moved.

“Oh, oh sweetie you don’t need to move anything around, you’ll hurt yourself. Just go relax in a bath, I’ll check it out tomorrow.”, He tells me.

He sounds off, I can’t tell why.

“Yeah, maybe you’re right. I just tried to move your Grandma’s hutch and it is pretty heavy.”, I laugh softly into the phone.

He’s quiet for a moment.

Then he bursts out in an exaggerated laugh.

“Yeah! It’s really heavy, such a pain! I’ll get the plumber to help tomorrow. Just.. Just don’t touch anything else tonight, just relax.”, He says frantically.

“Okay, I won’t..”, I reply cautiously.

“Ugh, I’m sorry. I’m just worried about you hurting yourself. I’ll deal with all that stuff tomorrow, just go and try to relax.”

“Okay,” I tell him, “I will.”

“Promise?”, He asks, and I can hear his blinker turn on.

“Yes.. I promise..”, I respond, still looking at the hutch.

“Okay, I love you. I’ll call you when I’m on the way home.”, He tells me, and I can hear him putting the car in park. He must be at the restaurant.

“Love you, bye.”, I tell him before hanging up, and sliding my phone back into my pocket.

Why didn’t he want me moving things? I’m not picking things up really.. I’m just.. Scooting. 

He seemed to get really stressed about me moving the hutch.

The tapping starts again.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

I don’t think it’s a pipe.

Maybe an animal got in the wall?

I put my ear up to the sliver of wall I cleared from moving the hutch and listen.

The tapping is coming from this wall.

Against Chase’s wishes, I put my side against the hutch and move it the rest of the way.

It moves easily, too easily.

I lean down, and notice tiny furniture slides have been placed underneath it already.

That’s odd, I’ve never seen this thing moved before.

When I stand back up, the wall seems blank, the wood paneling uniform.

I start knocking on the wall, trying to figure out if some critter is hiding.

Once I move over the panel directly in front of me, the sound changes.

The wall seems different here.

I run my fingers along the panel, and lightly push.

The wall moves.

I jump back, and gasp.

It’s a door.

It slowly opens, and reveals a staircase.

The tapping continues, and it’s louder.

I’m shaking by this point, how did I not know there was a basement? All our neighbors had one, and I was so confused why we didn’t.

I take out my phone flashlight, and head towards the stairs, slowly.

The tapping grows louder as I descend the dark stairs.

The light is shaking from my hands.

When I reach the bottom step, I flash the light around.

It looks like a seemingly normal basement, just some old boxes.

The tapping is coming from my right.

I shine my light over there, and I see a door.

With a key next to it, hanging on the wall.

I put my ear up to the door, and I hear the tapping mixed with soft music.

“What the hell..”, I whisper.

I try the door, but it’s locked. So I try the key hanging next to it.

It opens, slowly.

Warm light fills the basement as the door opens, and the music grows louder.

I look around the room, and it.. is not what I expected.

It looks like an apartment. There’s a couch, a tv, a hallway leading to more rooms. 

I follow the tapping to the kitchen.

There’s a woman standing there, at the counter. Her back is to me

But I can tell what she’s doing.

She’s chopping vegetables.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap.. 

The knife rocking back and forth against a wooden cutting board.

She chops something green and then slides it into a bowl.

“Darling! You’re early! Dinner is almost ready!”, She sings, turning over her shoulder.

She gasps when she sees me.

She steps back, holding a knife.

“Who are you??”, She demands.

“Who am I? You’re in my basement!”, I yell.

She studies me.

“This is my home, and I will kindly ask you to leave. It isn’t time yet.”, She says calmly, still holding the knife.

I’m in shock.

She has an apron, her hair and makeup are done, and she’s wearing heels.

“What is.. I don’t know what..”, I’m stammering. I can feel myself getting nauseous, and I’m trying to breathe.

Something over my shoulder catches her attention and she sighs in relief.

“Darling! I’m so glad you’re home, is this her? She seems confused!”, She says, putting the knife down.

I slowly turn over my shoulder.

And standing in the doorway, is Chase.

His face is a picture, it’s a mixture of horror and shock.

“Darling…?”, I whisper.

“Baby, I can explain.”, He takes a step towards me.

“Daddy!!!”, a little voice squeals from the hallway to my right.

A small boy runs up to Chase with his arms in the air.

Chase picks him up, but his eyes haven’t left me the whole time.

The woman walks over to Chase, and kisses him on the cheek.

“She is just dreadful, walking into my home and yelling at me? I thought she would be nicer.”, She shakes her head at me in disapproval.

“You thought… What??”, I shriek.

“I can explain, please just try to listen.”, Chase says, putting the child down and walking to me.

“Come on Liam, I’ll give you your bath..”, The woman says, pushing past us into the hallway with the boy.

“I’m going to be sick..”, I say outloud.

Chase reaches for me.

“Don’t touch me!”, I scream.

He freezes.

“How long?”, I demand, “How long has she been down here?”

He smiles sadly, and I have my answer.

“You’re disgusting.”, I seethe, “And we are done.” 

I push past him and head for the stairs.

“Baby. Baby, please. Just listen. This could work. Her name is Julia, and she is almost perfect. She can’t make me laugh like you can, we don’t get along as well. But she cooks, and she cleans, all the stuff you hate. So together, you’re a perfect woman. Am I wrong for wanting my two girls under one roof?”, He asks, crossing into the dining room with me.

“So you locked her down there???”, I yell.

“No! Well, yes, just until you were okay with the arrangement! And then we could all live together!”, He pleads.

“We’ve been together 5 years.. You’re sick.”, I whisper.

“Baby, just hear me out. This could work, you could be best friends, sisters even!”, He follows me up the stairs into our shared bedroom.

“We will not be SISTERS, I am getting my things and leaving, NOW! And you can have Julia and your SON!”, I scream, throwing things in my suitcase.

“You’re not even giving it a chance.. I thought you were different..”, He whispers.

“Yeah well I thought you didn’t want kids so we are both surprised right now.”, I say, slamming the suitcase and heading to the stairs.

“I already have Liam, I don’t need another. He wasn’t planned.”, He tells me, following me.

“I really don’t care anymore. You are sick, and disgusting, and I am leaving.”, I say, turning to face the door.

From behind me, his voice changes.

“I’m sorry, in advance.”, He says.

I feel a sharp pinch of pain.

And then everything goes dark.

*

When I wake up, warm light fills my vision.

Am I.. Dreaming?

I lift my head, I feel hungover.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

I look up and realize where I am.

I’m in the apartment, from the basement.

I go to stand, and I see my clothes are different.

I’m wearing heels, my hair feels curled, and I can feel lipstick on my lips.

Liam is sitting on the floor in front of me, watching an old cartoon.

I stand, and run to the door I entered from the last time I was here.

It’s locked.

I cry in frustration.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

“Are you okay?”, a tiny voice asks.

I just stare at the boy, and shake my head slowly.

“I have candy, I can give you some, if you want.”, He states, with a smile.

I shake my head.

“No, thank you though.”, I answer.

“I colored you this, while you were sleeping..”, He shuffles papers in front of him before handing me a picture.

It’s a pink flower.

“Thank you…”, I say hesitantly.

He smiles at me, I think he’s waiting for me to say something else.

“Where.. is your mom…”, I ask him.

He shrugs, and turns back to the tv.

I turn around, and slowly step towards the kitchen.

Julia is cutting vegetables, for what looks like a pot roast.

Soft music is playing from a radio next to her.

When she hears me, she turns to me smiling.

“Oh good! You’re awake! You can help me make the salad.”, She says, handing me a head of lettuce.

“What.. What is going on?”, I ask her, looking around the room.

She puts down the vegetables, and crosses to me.

She puts her hand on my arm, and smiles sadly.

“I know this is hard, but trust me, it’s easier to just do what he says.”, She tells me.

“What do you mean?”, I ask her.

“Just trust me.”, She says, before turning back to her cooking, and that insufferable sound.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

“W-Why.. Are you so calm?”, I ask her.

She puts her knife down, and turns to me.

A forced smile.

“Chase and I used to fight a lot, he said it wasn’t working. And it wasn’t, he was right, but then I was pregnant.. And it was.. A wonderful surprise..”, She says, smiling at Liam engrossed in a kids show about a boy with a magic flute.

“Liam is my life,” She continues, “Chase made me an offer. He said if I stay down here, cook dinner for him every night, clean the upstairs when asked, and get along with whatever new wife he brings in, listen to his cues, basically be on-call for all his.. needs. He will take care of us financially forever. I don’t have any family, any education, and.. he’s helping me.”, She smiles tightly.

It doesn’t reach her eyes.

“His cues?”, I ask.

“Like if I’m being too loud, he will stomp his foot or something as a warning. He gets upset if I don’t listen, so you’ll have to learn that..”, She says, turning back around.

The beer bottle.

He didn’t accidentally knock it over.

“So he expects me to just.. live down here?”, I ask.

“Oh no, not forever. Just until you’re trained.”, She answers bluntly.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

“He thinks we can be the perfect wife..”, She whispers, putting the lid on the Dutch oven.

“And besides..”, She says, putting the roast in the oven, “He tells me we can teach each other things, maybe you can give Liam a sibling one day.”

I’m going to be sick.

The clock on the wall chimes.

“Oh, Chase will be here any minute. I’ll pick up. You, check yourself so you look perfect. He likes that.”, She rushes out, before disappearing to the living room.

In her movements, I finally see 

She’s terrified.

I hear the door begin to unlock.

“Quick!”, she says, “Clear the dishes for me off the counter!”

In a haze, I turn around and put the cutting board and dirty bowls in the sink.

The door opens.

“Honey’s, I’m home!”, Chase’s booming voice calls.

Julia goes up to him immediately to offer him a kiss.

I’m still standing by the counter, when he approaches me, ruffling Liam’s hair along the way.

“And how are my favorite girls today?”, he says, but directed towards me.

I see Julia over his shoulder have a panicked look on her face.

And I don’t know why, but I want to protect her.

I give him an easy smile, like I used to.

“We are great, Julia and I are fast friends, and she is a whiz in the kitchen! Would you like your salad now?”, I smile.

His eyes sparkle in happiness.

“Yes I would, thank you,” he kisses my forehead, “I’m going to go wash up, let’s go buddy.”

He takes Liam down the hallway to where I’m assuming the bathroom is.

“I’ll set the table.”, Julia says, lightly touching my arm.

Then she mouthes “thank you” before turning away to the table.

I watch her with curiosity, while I hear Liam giggling down the hallway.

I will save them both.

I clutch the knife behind my back that Julia was chopping the vegetables with, and slide it into my apron pocket while Julia’s back is turned. 

I will save all of us.

“I’ll just take these boxes downstairs to the garage..”, I tell my boyfriend, Chase, putting another holiday serving platter in the cardboard box.

“I’ll take it for you sweetheart, I know how heavy all 100 of your Christmas platters are.” he says, smiling mischievously and kissing me on the cheek.

“Hey!”, I laugh, swatting his arm, “I want to be prepared if we ever have one of those Christmas parties like the movies where dozens of people come and I save Christmas somehow!”

He laughs, and picks up the box.

“You’re right, I need to be manifesting that for you.” He winks, and disappears down the stairs, shutting the door behind him.

My spring cleaning has run amuck in the house, but I think I’ve got the last of it sorted.

Our house isn’t huge, we have a 2 story house with 4 bedrooms. Beautiful exterior, I just wish it had more storage.

I smooth the bedspread on the (now cleaned) guest bedroom, and smile at the room, before closing the door behind me.

Chase is coming in from the garage when I come downstairs.

“Boxes all put away?”, I ask.

“Yes, but we officially can never buy anything else ever again.” He laughs, opening the fridge to grab a beer.

“Well when we get our next house, I need more storage. The attic is too small, and I want a basement. We can turn it into your man-cave too..”, I smile, wiggling my eyebrows.

He smiles at me, a lazy smile.

After 5 years together, he still gives me butterflies.

“Anything you want, sweetheart. And that goes for dinner too, what are you thinking?”, he leans back on the counter, opening a food delivery app on his phone.

“Chinese? I would love to learn how to make Mongolian Beef at home to save money, but unfortunately you do not love me for my cooking skills..”, I tell him, looking into the fridge with a sigh.

“Ah yes, how could I forget when you so infamously almost burned down this very kitchen the first time you came over. After you insisted you could cook us a whole meal?”, He sneaks up behind me and wraps his arms around me, making me squeal.

“See! I can’t possibly be your dream woman, I can’t even cook!”, I whine, between giggles.

He smooths my hair.

“I have everything I need.”, He says earnestly.

More butterflies.

Once our takeout comes, we are eating in front of the tv when I hear a tapping sound.

“Do you hear that?”, I ask.

“Hmm?”, Chase responds, not looking up from his takeout container.

“It’s a tapping sound.. Is it coming from the dining room?”, I put my food down, and get up to walk that way.

“Babe, I don’t hear anything. Could be a pipe, this house was old when I got it and it’s even older now!” He calls from the living room.

When I reach the dining room, I still hear it. I’m starting to pull out furniture to inspect when I hear a hard thump.

Then the tapping stops.

I rush back into the room, and Chase is picking up his beer bottle off the floor.

Foamy, brown liquid is now staining the rug.

“God, I’m so sorry. I reached for my beer and I knocked it off the table, could you grab me a towel?”, He asks, moving his food to the coffee table.

“Of course! I’ll be right back!”

I grab him a towel and we clean it together, comes right up.

“Did you figure out the tapping?”, He asks me, picking up our trash.

“Oh.. No I didn’t, must have been a pipe.”,  I respond, looking back towards the dining room.

He nods.

“If you want, I can call the plumber to come out and check everything. Just to make sure it’s not something important.”, He says, heading towards the kitchen.

“Oh no, I’m sure it’s fine. I’ll let you know if I hear it again.”, I smile.

*

Later that night, after we had gone to bed, I wake up with a startle.

I’m gasping, covered in sweat, and shakily looking for the switch to the lamp at my bedside table.

“Chase? Chase?”, I whisper.

The lamp flares to light.

Chase isn’t next to me.

“Chase?”, I say, a little louder.

Silence.

I get up, and walk to the bathroom. Sometimes when he can’t sleep, he will take a shower.

The bathroom is empty, but I take time to splash my face with water.

He must have wanted a midnight snack, he’s probably downstairs.

“Chase?”, I call out at normal volume.

I am just passing my doorway, heading towards the stairs, when I see Chase.

He’s halfway up, he looks relieved to see me.

“Sweetie, hey. Are you okay?”, He asks quickly, taking my hands and looking at my face.

“Oh, yes. I just had a nightmare, I think, I can’t even remember what it was about…”, I trail off, looking at him. 

He looks red, and like he broke a sweat running to the stairs.

“Are you alright?”, I ask.

“Yeah.. Yeah I’m good. Sorry, I went downstairs to watch tv and I must have dozed off. You calling my name woke me up and I thought you were hurt so I ran upstairs to check on you. My adrenaline is through the roof right now.”, He laughs, but it doesn’t meet his eyes.

“Oh honey,” I coo, “You’re my white knight, always trying to save me. What do you say.. We make use of that adrenaline..”

I playfully tease my finger on his shoulder.

He smiles and shakes his head.

“Oh I would love to, but I’m all frazzled right now. How about I take a shower and we snuggle instead?”, He asks, wrapping me into a hug.

“Of course, that’s probably the right idea.”, I respond.

Once he’s done in the shower, we do exactly that.

*

The next evening, Chase has his monthly work dinner. He’s an anesthesiologist, so the money is great, but his coworkers.. not so much.

“You sure you’ll be alright?”, He asks, checking his tie in our hallway mirror.

“Yes I’ll be fine,” I respond, we do this little routine every month, “I’ll catch up on all my obnoxious reality TV you hate.”

“Ah, I don’t know about that. TV is broken.”, He responds, still focusing on the mirror.

“Since when?”, I ask.

“Dinner yesterday, some of the beer splashed on the box. I’ll get a new one this weekend, don’t worry.”, He says smiling, turning towards me.

“But you were watching it last night, I thought. That’s why you came downstairs..”, I say, and it comes out sharper than I intend.

His expression doesn’t change.

“Oh, well yeah, I tried to come down to watch it. That’s when I noticed it was broken, so I fell asleep. Sorry, I thought I mentioned that.”, He explains with that easy smile.

“No worries, I’ll just read. Go knock them dead tonight, you always do!”, I say, giving him a good-luck kiss.

I wave at his car leaving the driveway, and I turn and go back to the living room.

I pick up my current book club read, and open up the next chapter.

I start to hear it again.

Tapping.

“Jesus, really?”, I say, putting my bookmark back in and heading to the dining room.

It’s softer tapping this time, but still steady.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

I take out my phone and send a message to Chase.

“Tapping is back, we should call plumber tomorrow.”

I put my phone in my pocket, and look around.

I pull up rugs, looking for any pipe leaking.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

“This is so weird..”, I mumble.

I look at the China hutch, it’s been there since I moved in. It’s ugly as sin but Chase says it’s a pain to move. It belonged to his grandmother, I think.

If any pipe is broken, it’s behind that old thing.

I push my shoulder into it, and start to scoot it.

To my shock, it moves pretty easily.

I move it a few inches, when my phone starts to ring.

It’s Chase’s ringtone.

I hit the green answer button.

“Hey, sorry I know you’re driving..”, I start.

“Hey!”, He says, “So the tapping is back? Same room?”

“Yeah, I’ve been moving stuff around to see if there’s any water leakage but I don’t see anything..”, I trail off, looking at the floor next to the massive hutch I just moved.

“Oh, oh sweetie you don’t need to move anything around, you’ll hurt yourself. Just go relax in a bath, I’ll check it out tomorrow.”, He tells me.

He sounds off, I can’t tell why.

“Yeah, maybe you’re right. I just tried to move your Grandma’s hutch and it is pretty heavy.”, I laugh softly into the phone.

He’s quiet for a moment.

Then he bursts out in an exaggerated laugh.

“Yeah! It’s really heavy, such a pain! I’ll get the plumber to help tomorrow. Just.. Just don’t touch anything else tonight, just relax.”, He says frantically.

“Okay, I won’t..”, I reply cautiously.

“Ugh, I’m sorry. I’m just worried about you hurting yourself. I’ll deal with all that stuff tomorrow, just go and try to relax.”

“Okay,” I tell him, “I will.”

“Promise?”, He asks, and I can hear his blinker turn on.

“Yes.. I promise..”, I respond, still looking at the hutch.

“Okay, I love you. I’ll call you when I’m on the way home.”, He tells me, and I can hear him putting the car in park. He must be at the restaurant.

“Love you, bye.”, I tell him before hanging up, and sliding my phone back into my pocket.

Why didn’t he want me moving things? I’m not picking things up really.. I’m just.. Scooting. 

He seemed to get really stressed about me moving the hutch.

The tapping starts again.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

I don’t think it’s a pipe.

Maybe an animal got in the wall?

I put my ear up to the sliver of wall I cleared from moving the hutch and listen.

The tapping is coming from this wall.

Against Chase’s wishes, I put my side against the hutch and move it the rest of the way.

It moves easily, too easily.

I lean down, and notice tiny furniture slides have been placed underneath it already.

That’s odd, I’ve never seen this thing moved before.

When I stand back up, the wall seems blank, the wood paneling uniform.

I start knocking on the wall, trying to figure out if some critter is hiding.

Once I move over the panel directly in front of me, the sound changes.

The wall seems different here.

I run my fingers along the panel, and lightly push.

The wall moves.

I jump back, and gasp.

It’s a door.

It slowly opens, and reveals a staircase.

The tapping continues, and it’s louder.

I’m shaking by this point, how did I not know there was a basement? All our neighbors had one, and I was so confused why we didn’t.

I take out my phone flashlight, and head towards the stairs, slowly.

The tapping grows louder as I descend the dark stairs.

The light is shaking from my hands.

When I reach the bottom step, I flash the light around.

It looks like a seemingly normal basement, just some old boxes.

The tapping is coming from my right.

I shine my light over there, and I see a door.

With a key next to it, hanging on the wall.

I put my ear up to the door, and I hear the tapping mixed with soft music.

“What the hell..”, I whisper.

I try the door, but it’s locked. So I try the key hanging next to it.

It opens, slowly.

Warm light fills the basement as the door opens, and the music grows louder.

I look around the room, and it.. is not what I expected.

It looks like an apartment. There’s a couch, a tv, a hallway leading to more rooms. 

I follow the tapping to the kitchen.

There’s a woman standing there, at the counter. Her back is to me

But I can tell what she’s doing.

She’s chopping vegetables.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap.. 

The knife rocking back and forth against a wooden cutting board.

She chops something green and then slides it into a bowl.

“Darling! You’re early! Dinner is almost ready!”, She sings, turning over her shoulder.

She gasps when she sees me.

She steps back, holding a knife.

“Who are you??”, She demands.

“Who am I? You’re in my basement!”, I yell.

She studies me.

“This is my home, and I will kindly ask you to leave. It isn’t time yet.”, She says calmly, still holding the knife.

I’m in shock.

She has an apron, her hair and makeup are done, and she’s wearing heels.

“What is.. I don’t know what..”, I’m stammering. I can feel myself getting nauseous, and I’m trying to breathe.

Something over my shoulder catches her attention and she sighs in relief.

“Darling! I’m so glad you’re home, is this her? She seems confused!”, She says, putting the knife down.

I slowly turn over my shoulder.

And standing in the doorway, is Chase.

His face is a picture, it’s a mixture of horror and shock.

“Darling…?”, I whisper.

“Baby, I can explain.”, He takes a step towards me.

“Daddy!!!”, a little voice squeals from the hallway to my right.

A small boy runs up to Chase with his arms in the air.

Chase picks him up, but his eyes haven’t left me the whole time.

The woman walks over to Chase, and kisses him on the cheek.

“She is just dreadful, walking into my home and yelling at me? I thought she would be nicer.”, She shakes her head at me in disapproval.

“You thought… What??”, I shriek.

“I can explain, please just try to listen.”, Chase says, putting the child down and walking to me.

“Come on Liam, I’ll give you your bath..”, The woman says, pushing past us into the hallway with the boy.

“I’m going to be sick..”, I say outloud.

Chase reaches for me.

“Don’t touch me!”, I scream.

He freezes.

“How long?”, I demand, “How long has she been down here?”

He smiles sadly, and I have my answer.

“You’re disgusting.”, I seethe, “And we are done.” 

I push past him and head for the stairs.

“Baby. Baby, please. Just listen. This could work. Her name is Julia, and she is almost perfect. She can’t make me laugh like you can, we don’t get along as well. But she cooks, and she cleans, all the stuff you hate. So together, you’re a perfect woman. Am I wrong for wanting my two girls under one roof?”, He asks, crossing into the dining room with me.

“So you locked her down there???”, I yell.

“No! Well, yes, just until you were okay with the arrangement! And then we could all live together!”, He pleads.

“We’ve been together 5 years.. You’re sick.”, I whisper.

“Baby, just hear me out. This could work, you could be best friends, sisters even!”, He follows me up the stairs into our shared bedroom.

“We will not be SISTERS, I am getting my things and leaving, NOW! And you can have Julia and your SON!”, I scream, throwing things in my suitcase.

“You’re not even giving it a chance.. I thought you were different..”, He whispers.

“Yeah well I thought you didn’t want kids so we are both surprised right now.”, I say, slamming the suitcase and heading to the stairs.

“I already have Liam, I don’t need another. He wasn’t planned.”, He tells me, following me.

“I really don’t care anymore. You are sick, and disgusting, and I am leaving.”, I say, turning to face the door.

From behind me, his voice changes.

“I’m sorry, in advance.”, He says.

I feel a sharp pinch of pain.

And then everything goes dark.

*

When I wake up, warm light fills my vision.

Am I.. Dreaming?

I lift my head, I feel hungover.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

I look up and realize where I am.

I’m in the apartment, from the basement.

I go to stand, and I see my clothes are different.

I’m wearing heels, my hair feels curled, and I can feel lipstick on my lips.

Liam is sitting on the floor in front of me, watching an old cartoon.

I stand, and run to the door I entered from the last time I was here.

It’s locked.

I cry in frustration.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

“Are you okay?”, a tiny voice asks.

I just stare at the boy, and shake my head slowly.

“I have candy, I can give you some, if you want.”, He states, with a smile.

I shake my head.

“No, thank you though.”, I answer.

“I colored you this, while you were sleeping..”, He shuffles papers in front of him before handing me a picture.

It’s a pink flower.

“Thank you…”, I say hesitantly.

He smiles at me, I think he’s waiting for me to say something else.

“Where.. is your mom…”, I ask him.

He shrugs, and turns back to the tv.

I turn around, and slowly step towards the kitchen.

Julia is cutting vegetables, for what looks like a pot roast.

Soft music is playing from a radio next to her.

When she hears me, she turns to me smiling.

“Oh good! You’re awake! You can help me make the salad.”, She says, handing me a head of lettuce.

“What.. What is going on?”, I ask her, looking around the room.

She puts down the vegetables, and crosses to me.

She puts her hand on my arm, and smiles sadly.

“I know this is hard, but trust me, it’s easier to just do what he says.”, She tells me.

“What do you mean?”, I ask her.

“Just trust me.”, She says, before turning back to her cooking, and that insufferable sound.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

“W-Why.. Are you so calm?”, I ask her.

She puts her knife down, and turns to me.

A forced smile.

“Chase and I used to fight a lot, he said it wasn’t working. And it wasn’t, he was right, but then I was pregnant.. And it was.. A wonderful surprise..”, She says, smiling at Liam engrossed in a kids show about a boy with a magic flute.

“Liam is my life,” She continues, “Chase made me an offer. He said if I stay down here, cook dinner for him every night, clean the upstairs when asked, and get along with whatever new wife he brings in, listen to his cues, basically be on-call for all his.. needs. He will take care of us financially forever. I don’t have any family, any education, and.. he’s helping me.”, She smiles tightly.

It doesn’t reach her eyes.

“His cues?”, I ask.

“Like if I’m being too loud, he will stomp his foot or something as a warning. He gets upset if I don’t listen, so you’ll have to learn that..”, She says, turning back around.

The beer bottle.

He didn’t accidentally knock it over.

“So he expects me to just.. live down here?”, I ask.

“Oh no, not forever. Just until you’re trained.”, She answers bluntly.

Tap.. Tap.. Tap..

“He thinks we can be the perfect wife..”, She whispers, putting the lid on the Dutch oven.

“And besides..”, She says, putting the roast in the oven, “He tells me we can teach each other things, maybe you can give Liam a sibling one day.”

I’m going to be sick.

The clock on the wall chimes.

“Oh, Chase will be here any minute. I’ll pick up. You, check yourself so you look perfect. He likes that.”, She rushes out, before disappearing to the living room.

In her movements, I finally see

Sleek glass façades, luxury lounges, and marble walkways that looked like they were hand-buffed by angels. But behind that glittering surface lies something that doesn’t make it to the brochures: the human cost.

Tens of thousands of migrant workers, primarily from South Asia and Africa, built these terminals, towers, and malls. Many live in labor camps on the city’s outskirts, working six-day weeks in 45°C heat for wages they sometimes don’t receive for months. These are the same men who poured the concrete, wired the lights, and polished the floor I walked on with my thepla in hand. Most will never be able to afford a single coffee at the airport they helped build.

This isn’t a “political rant.” This is a fact of life here, visible if you choose to look. And while I don’t expect a tourist to overthrow a system, I do think we owe it to the people who built these places to at least acknowledge them.

About me, I’m can be a bit introverted (INFJ). I enjoy being at home watching tv shows, movies, or playing video games, but if I’m with close friends, going out for drinks/food is always fun. I enjoy traveling. 

Recently, I went to Toronto, but I have been to Ireland and Tanzania by plane, and also, Mexico and Honduras via cruise. I’m kind of a nerd/geek in that I still enjoy 90s nostalgia. I also do taekwondo in which I’m currently a blue belt. 

Surprisingly, I haven’t mentioned it already, but getting coffee is one of my favorite things to do each day. Whether it’s quickly getting the usual, sitting down to enjoy the cafe atmosphere, or trying a new place.

When it comes to video games, I enjoy Zelda, Assassin’s Creed, Resident Evil, Fenyx Rising, Pokemon, Mario Kart, Animal Crossing, Harvest Moon, Skyrim, and probably more.

As for tv, I enjoy comedies, dramas, and fantasy. I also enjoy some anime’s. Movies, I typically enjoy fantasy or horror. 

Finally, I work at a mental and behavioral health program for kids and teens. I am not a therapist though.

As for you, I’m pretty open to all for friends. Relationship wise, I tend to like guys that are my age or younger. I would like to find someone who is genuinely kind and caring. I would like someone that enjoys being active but also likes a good lazy day. 

Also, along those lines, I want someone that equality enjoys a night in, as much as, a night out with friends. A must is that you enjoy hugs and cuddles. My love language is physical touch and quality time. If you also wanna be adventurous and travel, that would be cool! ",1,1753596746.0,gayfriendship,0,1.0,False

# Best iPhone 16 Pro Max Case with Card Holder [2025]

The iPhone 16 Pro Max is poised to be a groundbreaking device, and protecting such a valuable investment is paramount. A case with a card holder not only shields your phone from damage but also offers the convenience of carrying essential cards without the need for a bulky wallet. This review explores the top iPhone 16 Pro Max cases with card holders expected to dominate the market in 2025, focusing on their features, benefits, and suitability for various users.

[[Browse top-rated iphone 16 pro max case with card holder on Amazon]](https://best.healthytargeting.com/clearance-products/?KW=iphone+16+pro+max+case+with+card+holder)
## Key Features Analysis

The iPhone 16 Pro Max cases with card holders offer a blend of protection, functionality, and style. The best cases incorporate advanced materials and thoughtful design elements to enhance the user experience.

**Material Composition:** The ideal case utilizes a combination of TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) for shock absorption and polycarbonate (PC) for structural rigidity. Tpu provides excellent impact resistance, cushioning the phone from drops and bumps. Pc adds a layer of hardness, preventing scratches and maintaining the case's shape over time. Premium cases may incorporate aramid fiber (Kevlar) for enhanced durability and a sleek aesthetic.

The use of high-quality materials ensures that the case can withstand daily wear and tear, protecting the iPhone 16 Pro Max from potential damage. The textured surface of the TPU often provides a better grip, reducing the likelihood of accidental drops.

**Card Holder Capacity and Design:** The card holder should securely accommodate at least 2-3 cards, such as an ID, credit card, and transit pass. The design should allow for easy access to the cards without compromising the phone's protection. Some cases feature a sliding mechanism, while others use a snap-on cover or a simple pocket design. The sliding mechanism is generally preferred for its discreetness and added security.

The card holder's depth and width are crucial to prevent cards from falling out or being damaged. A well-designed card holder will have a snug fit that keeps the cards in place while still allowing for easy removal when needed.

**Drop Protection and Impact Resistance:** A robust case should meet or exceed military-grade drop test standards (MIL-STD-810G). This certification ensures that the case can withstand multiple drops from a certain height without causing damage to the phone. The case's design should include reinforced corners and raised edges around the screen and camera to protect these vulnerable areas from impact.

The thickness of the case is a factor in its drop protection capabilities, but a balance must be struck between protection and bulkiness. The ideal case provides adequate protection without adding excessive weight or making the phone difficult to handle.

**Wireless Charging Compatibility:** The case should be fully compatible with wireless charging, allowing users to charge their iPhone 16 Pro Max without removing the case. The materials used in the case's construction should not interfere with the wireless charging signal. Cases that are too thick or contain metallic components may impede wireless charging.

The compatibility with MagSafe accessories is also important. The case should allow for a secure connection with MagSafe chargers, wallets, and other accessories, ensuring that these features function as intended.

**Design and Aesthetics:** While functionality is paramount, the case's design should complement the iPhone 16 Pro Max's aesthetics. Cases are available in a variety of colors, finishes, and styles, allowing users to personalize their phone's appearance. Slim and minimalist designs are popular, as they maintain the phone's sleek profile.

The case's texture and grip are also important considerations. A smooth finish may look elegant, but it can make the phone slippery and prone to drops. A textured surface provides a better grip and reduces the risk of accidental falls.

Key features of the best iPhone 16 Pro Max cases with card holders include:

*   High-quality TPU and PC construction
*   Secure card holder with easy access
*   Military-grade drop protection
*   Wireless charging and MagSafe compatibility
*   Sleek and functional design

## Core Benefits

The best iPhone 16 Pro Max cases with card holders offer a range of practical benefits that enhance the user's daily life. These benefits extend beyond simple protection, providing added convenience and peace of mind.

**Streamlined Convenience:** By combining phone protection and card storage, these cases eliminate the need for a separate wallet. This is particularly useful for individuals who prefer to travel light or who want to minimize the number of items they carry. Imagine being able to grab your phone and go, knowing that you have your essential cards readily available.

The convenience extends to everyday tasks, such as paying for coffee or using public transportation. With your cards easily accessible, you can quickly make transactions without fumbling through a wallet or purse.

**Enhanced Security:** Keeping your cards securely attached to your phone reduces the risk of losing them. Unlike a traditional wallet that can be easily misplaced or stolen, a card holder case keeps your cards in close proximity to your phone, making it more difficult for them to be lost or stolen. The sliding mechanism on some cases adds an extra layer of security, preventing cards from accidentally falling out.

The integrated design also makes it less likely that you'll forget your cards when leaving the house. Because your cards are always with your phone, you're less likely to leave them behind at home or in the office.

**Improved Organization:** A card holder case helps to declutter your pockets or bag by consolidating your phone and essential cards into a single unit. This can be particularly beneficial for individuals who tend to carry a lot of items with them. By reducing the number of separate items, you can simplify your daily routine and make it easier to find what you need.

The organized design also makes it easier to keep track of your cards. Instead of having them scattered throughout your wallet, they are neatly organized in the card holder, making it easier to find the card you need when you need it.

**Protection and Peace of Mind:** The primary benefit of any phone case is protection, and a card holder case is no exception. By shielding your iPhone 16 Pro Max from scratches, drops, and other types of damage, the case helps to preserve the phone's value and functionality. This is particularly important for a high-end device like the iPhone 16 Pro Max, which represents a significant investment.

The added peace of mind that comes with knowing your phone is protected allows you to focus on your daily activities without worrying about damaging your device. The robust construction of the case ensures that it can withstand the rigors of daily use, providing long-lasting protection.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions about iPhone 16 Pro Max cases with card holders can help potential buyers make informed decisions. Understanding the nuances of compatibility, installation, and warranty coverage is essential.

**Will the card holder damage the cards' magnetic strips?**

No, the card holders are typically designed to prevent damage to the magnetic strips of credit cards and IDs. Many cases incorporate RFID-blocking technology to protect against electronic theft and demagnetization. The materials used in the card holder's construction are carefully chosen to minimize any potential interference with the cards' magnetic properties.

It's always a good idea to check the specific features of the case before purchasing to ensure that it includes RFID-blocking technology or other protective measures.

**How easy is it to remove the cards from the holder?**

The ease of card removal varies depending on the design of the card holder. Sliding mechanisms and snap-on covers typically allow for easier card removal compared to simple pocket designs. A well-designed card holder will have a small opening or notch that allows you to push the cards out with your finger.

The tightness of the card holder is also a factor. A card holder that is too tight will make it difficult to remove the cards, while one that is too loose may allow the cards to fall out. The ideal card holder will strike a balance between security and ease of use.

**What happens if the case breaks or the card holder malfunctions?**

Most reputable case manufacturers offer a warranty that covers defects in materials and workmanship. The warranty period typically ranges from a few months to a year or more. If the case breaks or the card holder malfunctions during the warranty period, you may be eligible for a replacement or repair.

It's important to read the warranty terms and conditions carefully to understand what is covered and what is not. Some warranties may exclude damage caused by accidents, misuse, or normal wear and tear.

1maezam,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parasitology/comments/1maezam/this_is_my_story_back_from_2009/,"This is my story, back from 2009","# [1. Getting Started (What's on the menu?)]()

# [1.1 A preface to the preface]()

Life looked a bit different in 2009. As a young pediatrician, I felt like the king of the world. I was about to start my second residency in infectious diseases and thought I was invincible.

Then came that phone call. It wasn't even meant for me.

The call was between Prof. P.Y. and Prof. D.G. At its core was P.Y.'s need to find a replacement lecturer for the parasitology course for second-year medical students, due to Prof. Y.A.'s imminent retirement. P.Y., who was then the head of the medical school, saw he was in trouble and immediately called the least suitable person for the task. He knew very well that D.G. was lazy and knew nothing about parasites, but he also knew very well that he could impose anything he wanted on D.G., and D.G. had no means of resistance.

I was casually passing through the corridor next to D.G.'s room, where I constantly hung out. A silly smile on my lips and a deep need to read another 500 unnecessary pages in Feigin or Mandell (the textbooks for infectious diseases in children and adults, respectively). I had no idea how my life was about to change completely.

I could hear snippets of the conversation. It was clear D.G. was in distress, and the hundred-kilo hammer on his head was causing him slight discomfort. Then the unbelievable happened. Deus ex machina. D.G. spotted my clumsy figure dancing in the hallway and immediately jumped up – ""Shalom, you have a phone call."" The idiot that is me immediately replied, ""No problem,"" took the receiver, and brought it to my ear. ""Yes, P.Y., what's up?"" The end.

I won't bore you with the details. P.Y. commanded me, in the most polite and friendly tone he could muster, to attend a meeting with Y.A. in the parasitology lab to replace him in delivering the course in question.

A week later, I was walking happily and light-heartedly, with septol in my eye (don't ask) that made me grimace and look like a pervert, on my way to the pathology building. On the second floor, in the parasitology lab, Prof. Y.A. was waiting for me.

It's worth understanding a few basic things about the situation at that time:

* I have just finished my pediatrics residency. My knowledge of parasitology was close to zero and included memories of missing a class or two due to military reserve duty and my father's memorial service. That's it.
* Parasites sounded to me like something related to bizarre jungle diseases. Something with swollen testicles and terrifying pictures of worms peeking out of all sorts of holes and orifices in the body. (Yes, I know I was stupid, and I hope it's mostly passed).
* Prof. Y.A. didn't know me at all, certainly didn't remember me from my student days (a grade of 85 in the course, thanks for asking).
* My professional aspirations were limited to completing my infectious diseases residency; I was happy to be the youngest and most enthusiastic in the group.
* I had no teaching experience at all and only a vague idea in my head of what I wanted to say in the conversation.

I entered the room. Y.A. offered me coffee. I refused. He tried to understand why I was twitching as if suffering from St. Vitus' Dance. I didn't have the energy or desire to explain to him that I had gotten septol (alcohol-based hand sanitizer) in my eye a few minutes ago in the ward, while washing my hands for the thousandth time that morning, as usual.

He got straight to the point and immediately surprised me. Yes, of course, he needed me to teach the course. But that wasn't the main thing. Before his retirement, the sleepy Iraqi realized he hadn't secured a successor for managing the parasitology lab. In fact, he had found a successor, Dr. D., but had a fight with him a few weeks before the end. Now he dropped the bombshell and asked me to take over the lab management. I chuckled, contorted, grimaced, didn't understand. What did that have to do with me, for God's sake?!

I had never considered a career in a lab. After all, I was a clinician burdened with shifts and sleepless nights filled with resuscitations and hallucinations. What did I have to do with this?!

I explained that it wouldn't happen, but gladly (a blatant lie, but I tried to minimize damage and retreat quickly) I would teach the course starting next year. The conversation quickly died down; one could see the light fade from Y.A.'s face and his enthusiasm vanish. We quickly agreed on a course outline, he handed me some files, and we parted ways.

Since then, I have been teaching the parasitology course every year with great enthusiasm, both mine and the students. This book summarizes the course as it is – a rollercoaster ride of dubious science (all my knowledge comes from self-study), eternal stand-up shows (I have a need to make people laugh in lectures, otherwise I get bored), and countless experiences with parasites. I learned to love the profession, the patients, and yes, even the parasites. They are my closest friends. I try to know everything about them, to laugh at them, to understand them, and to successfully kill them. All out of mutual respect for these repulsive creatures.

I'm sure you'll find interest in the crazy journey you're about to embark on. Parasitology is fascinating. The most fascinating of all. Believe me.

And as for Y.A.'s offer to manage the lab? In retrospect, the best offer I ever received. I regret not taking it in real-time.

For context, I have ADHD and autism, and have always been a bit eccentric and over-sensitive. I experience hyper-empathy as well due to autism and I just normally care a great deal about everything. I study ethics and politics and have been planning on pursuing law school because I want to help people. 

Since starting BC, everything just suddenly feels flat. I don't really care about anything anymore, I can't motivate myself to leave my apartment, everything is a mess and my plants haven't been watered in over a week. I've been doing some work with immigrant children once a week over the summer, and normally I'm always so excited for it and I feel great after, but this past week I didn't really care about going and I only felt drained after. Almost everything overstimulates me and I've been living out of my walk-in-closet for the past 2 days (sleeping and working).

I'm 26, and it's only been this past year that I really began to find my purpose and love myself, including the parts that I've always felt were ""too much"" and now all of it is just gone. On one hand I definitely feel more stable, but like, a flatline is also stable lol. I just remembered earlier how I would wake up and dance around my apartment in the mornings and now I can't even get out of bed for coffee.

# Best Ceramic Coating for Inside car 2025: Reviews

maintaining the interior of your car can be a challenge,especially with everyday wear and tear. Ceramic coatings, traditionally used for exterior paint protection, are now being formulated for interior use. These coatings provide a protective layer against stains, spills, UV damage, and general degradation of interior surfaces. Choosing the right ceramic coating can substantially extend the lifespan and improve the appearance of your car’s interior. This article reviews some of the best ceramic coating options available in 2025, tailored specifically for automotive interiors.

[[Explore Top Rated ceramic coating for inside the car on Amazon.]](https://site.healthytargeting.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=ceramic coating for inside the car)

## Key Features Analysis

Choosing the right ceramic coating for your car's interior involves several key considerations. The ideal product should offer a balance of ease of application, durability, stain resistance, and UV protection.

**Durability and Longevity:** A high-quality interior ceramic coating should last for at least 12-24 months under normal usage conditions. This requires a formulation that bonds effectively with interior surfaces like leather, vinyl, and plastic, resisting abrasion and wear from daily use. Longevity also depends on the frequency of cleaning and the harshness of cleaning products used. The ability to withstand repetitive cleaning without meaningful degradation is critical for maintaining long-term protection.

**Stain Resistance:** One of the primary purposes of a ceramic coating for interiors is to prevent staining from spills, such as coffee, soda, or food. The coating must create a hydrophobic surface that repels liquids, preventing them from penetrating the material. Advanced formulations incorporate stain-blocking polymers that further enhance resistance to stubborn stains like ink and dye transfer from clothing. Effective stain resistance ensures that spills can be easily wiped away without leaving a permanent mark.

**UV Protection:** Prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause fading, cracking, and discoloration of interior surfaces, especially dashboards and seats.A good ceramic coating should contain UV absorbers that block harmful ultraviolet rays. These absorbers help to prevent the breakdown of polymers in the interior materials, preserving their original color and texture. Coatings with a high UV protection factor can significantly extend the life of your car's interior.

**Ease of Application:** the application process should be straightforward, allowing both professionals and DIY enthusiasts to achieve excellent results. Products that require extensive surface preparation or have a complex application process are less desirable. The ideal coating should be easy to spread evenly and should cure quickly without leaving streaks or blotches. User-friendly application ensures consistent coverage and minimizes the risk of errors.

**Surface Compatibility:** Automotive interiors consist of various materials, including leather, vinyl, plastic, and fabric. The ceramic coating should be compatible with all these surfaces without causing damage or discoloration. Formulations designed to be multi-surface compatible often contain special additives that enhance adhesion and prevent adverse reactions with different materials. Versatility in surface compatibility ensures that the coating can be used throughout the interior of the car.

**VOC Content and Safety:** Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) can pose health risks and contribute to air pollution. Choosing a ceramic coating with low VOC content is essential for ensuring a safe and environmentally friendly application. Low-VOC formulations minimize the release of harmful vapors during application and curing,making them safer for the user and the vehicle's occupants. Prioritizing products with certifications for low VOC emissions is a responsible choice.

## Core Benefits

Applying a ceramic coating to the interior of your car offers several key advantages that enhance both the appearance and longevity of your vehicle's interior.

**Enhanced Interior Appearance:** A ceramic coating can revitalize and enhance the appearance of your car's interior surfaces. It adds a subtle sheen to surfaces, making them look cleaner and newer. The coating also helps to restore the original color and texture of materials that may have faded or become worn over time. This results in a more attractive and well-maintained interior, which can increase the overall value of your vehicle.

**Superior Protection Against Stains and Spills:** Ceramic coatings provide a robust barrier against stains from common spills such as coffee, soda, and food. The hydrophobic properties of the coating prevent liquids from penetrating the surface, making it easy to wipe away spills without leaving a stain. This protection is especially beneficial for light-colored interiors that are more prone to staining. By preventing stains, the coating helps to maintain the pristine appearance of your car's interior.

**Resistance to UV Damage:** The sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays can cause significant damage to your car's interior, leading to fading, cracking, and discoloration. A ceramic coating with UV protection can effectively block these harmful rays, thereby preserving the original condition of interior surfaces.This protection is especially crucial for dashboards and seats that are directly exposed to sunlight. By reducing UV damage, the coating helps to extend the life of your car's interior and maintain its aesthetic appeal.

**easier Cleaning and Maintenance:** Ceramic coatings create a smooth, non-porous surface that makes cleaning much easier. Dirt, dust, and grime are less likely to adhere to the treated surface, so they can be easily wiped away with a damp cloth. This reduces the need for harsh cleaning chemicals and time-consuming detailing. Regular maintenance becomes less frequent and more straightforward, saving you time and effort while keeping your car's interior looking its best.

**Increased Resale Value:** Maintaining the interior of your car in excellent condition can significantly increase its resale value. A ceramic coating helps to protect interior surfaces from wear and tear, stains, and UV damage, ensuring that they remain in good condition for longer. When it comes time to sell your car, a well-maintained interior can be a major selling point, attracting more buyers and commanding a higher price. Investing in a ceramic coating is thus a wise decision for both the short-term enjoyment and long-term value of your vehicle.

I entered the room. Y.A. offered me coffee. I refused. He tried to understand why I was twitching as if suffering from St. Vitus' Dance. I didn't have the energy or desire to explain to him that I had gotten septol (alcohol-based hand sanitizer) in my eye a few minutes ago in the ward, while washing my hands for the thousandth time that morning, as usual.

He got straight to the point and immediately surprised me. Yes, of course, he needed me to teach the course. But that wasn't the main thing. Before his retirement, the sleepy Iraqi realized he hadn't secured a successor for managing the parasitology lab. In fact, he had found a successor, Dr. D., but had a fight with him a few weeks before the end. Now he dropped the bombshell and asked me to take over the lab management. I chuckled, contorted, grimaced, didn't understand. What did that have to do with me, for God's sake?!

I had never considered a career in a lab. After all, I was a clinician burdened with shifts and sleepless nights filled with resuscitations and hallucinations. What did I have to do with this?!

I explained that it wouldn't happen, but gladly (a blatant lie, but I tried to minimize damage and retreat quickly) I would teach the course starting next year. The conversation quickly died down; one could see the light fade from Y.A.'s face and his enthusiasm vanish. We quickly agreed on a course outline, he handed me some files, and we parted ways.

Since then, I have been teaching the parasitology course every year with great enthusiasm, both mine and the students. This book summarizes the course as it is – a rollercoaster ride of dubious science (all my knowledge comes from self-study), eternal stand-up shows (I have a need to make people laugh in lectures, otherwise I get bored), and countless experiences with parasites. I learned to love the profession, the patients, and yes, even the parasites. They are my closest friends. I try to know everything about them, to laugh at them, to understand them, and to successfully kill them. All out of mutual respect for these repulsive creatures.

I'm sure you'll find interest in the crazy journey you're about to embark on. Parasitology is fascinating. The most fascinating of all. Believe me.

And as for Y.A.'s offer to manage the lab? In retrospect, the best offer I ever received. I regret not taking it in real-time.

I’d love to find a creative penpal to share stories, drawings, other artsy bits and pieces of life, motivational side quests, thoughts, opinions, poems, and maybe even bizarre questions (like what loot you would drop in a video game). Heartfelt writing exchanged between two travelers experiencing the journey that life has to offer. Expect wax seals, stickers, doodles, snippets of lore, music recommendations, and 2am brain dumps with a touch of magic!

A tad more about this adventurer:

1maeuv8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1maeuv8/relationships_that_start_out_wrong_still_have_a/,"Relationships that start out wrong, still have a chance to be good, right?","My ex of 21 years wanted me to have sex with other people. He knew that I was uncomfortable with the idea. He didn't care if it was some random guy from a bar, (he'd encourage me to go without him so I *could get fucked good"") and take pictures. He posted our private pictures on Reddit and had guys msging him there. He didn't care about my safety or my health. It became such an obsession that it was ALL he would talk about. He wanted me to do all of this in his parents basement with them right above us. He even suggested going to a place with ""glory holes"" and back my body up to them and let more than one inside me. I told him flat out that I wasn't having sex with a stranger. It was never ever going to happen. I had started to feel worthless because I couldn't make him happy. He was refusing to have sex with me at all. Why would he want to when I couldn't love him enough to show him. We lived in the same place but barely spoke. I was humiliated, hurt, empty and so lonely.

So, he messaged one of his friends and asked him. I said that I might consider it. I just wanted him to ""love"" me again. The friend and I started chatting and he came over a few times to hang out. We realized we had a lot in common and that I was leagues above my ex. A few weeks later the friend sent me a conversation they had. My ex had told him that I was just shy but he could drug me and then do whatever he wanted to do. The friend was disgusted with what my ex even suggested. Especially because my ex would ask him repeatedly. Well one night my ex passed out, and friend msged me and wanted to just come over and hang out. I told him that my ex was sleeping. So he asked me to come over. 

At first I said no because I didn't want to ""cheat"". But, I changed my mind. It honestly led to one of the best nights of my adult life. He was gentle and rough at just the right times. He held me close and caressed my body while telling me that I was beautiful. Said he was grossed out by what my ex wanted me to do. He was supposed to take me back that night, but we fell asleep tangled up with each other and when I woke up it was daylight. We both thought it was just a one night thing. But when the opportunity came around again it happened. He made me feel special, like a woman, safe and cared about. At one point I just had tears streaming down my face. He held me close, wiped my tears, and rubbed my hair. I couldn't even form words. He asked if I wanted him to stop and I just held him closer. Damn this man could make my body do things that it had never done before. My body just responded to his touch so easily. I felt guilty because I shouldn't have been in his bed, but there was no where in the world I would have rather been.

Fast forward, my abusive 21 year relationship is over. He found out that it happened,and lost his mind. All of a sudden I was a cheating slut, a whore and a worthless POS. I was woken up by a punch to the fact, and he was trying to throw me outside in just a T-shirt in 33° weather. He started throwing shit at me and I had a full beer bottle and a coffee mug connect to my face. I refused to leave because I wasn't dressed and he wouldn't give me clothes, took my phone and we lived miles from the nearest place to even find a phone. He then grabbed me by the hair and dragged me across the basement floor trying to get me outside. I wedged myself between the bed and the wall so he couldn't move me. I ended up with a black eye, welts on my face and clumps of hair falling into my hands. Of course once the rage ended he was apologizing profusely, and the whole ""why'd you make me do that to you?"" He wouldn't give me my phone and I was literally trapped there. I had to walk on egg shells and be a ""good girl"", long enough to placate him. Any time I tried to leave he'd grab my dog and used her as a hostage. So if I went to the store with anyone I would always have to come back because I didn't want to leave her behind. 

It took weeks of this cycle where any time I came back he had to inspect my body to make sure I hadn't had sex. The first time I showered after the attack, the bottom of the shower was full of hair and some blood. It was humiliating. Everyone was telling me to get the Hell out of there before he'd kill me. Even if it meant leaving my dog behind for the moment.

 I finally found the strength to do exactly that. I went back to the place we once shared. He hadn't lived there for 3.5 years but, we still were together even though he was living with his parents. Originally it was my intention for him to move back ""home"" with me eventually. All I asked him to do was hold a job and get his car fixed. He couldn't seem to do either of those things. But, still I stupidly stayed in the relationship hoping that someday something would click. I alienated my children, my family and friends because they could see it even when I couldn't.

I have been out now for quite awhile. I came home, regained my composure and grieved the loss, and started picking up the pieces of my life.I was still spending time with the friend on occasion and he was one of my biggest supporters. He brought me boxes, and I packed up just about everything the ex still had at my place. I'd continually would get texts telling me that I was a POS, a cheating slut, etc. etc. He was telling me to not touch his shit and he'd come get it himself. I told him repeatedly that he was not coming back into my place ever ever again .Most of the time the only thing I would say to him was asking about my dog. A few weeks later my parents and my adult son (who has hated him for years at this point) went with me to exchange belongings. I had packed up his stuff nicely, even folding the clothes and wrapping up the fragile stuff. When we got there my stepdad and my son stacked up the boxes and pulled the furniture close to the door.I went in to try and get my stuff and he tried to be abusive again.I had asked him to have my things ready for me and of course he didn't. Eventually he started throwing my stuff out the door. He tried to keep my dog, but my son went inside and talked to his parents. Basically told them that we weren't leaving without her, and that could happen the easy way or the hard way. He finally gave her to my son while calling me every name in the book. He's lucky that my son was holding the dog because he was ready to go if necessary.

Now, I have an amazing man that is showing me what good love and a good relationship looks and feels like. He's very patient as I learn what happens in a normal relationship. He's helped me fix my place and was disgusted that my ex let me live with things broken, not working or safe. (The ex would always tell me he'd handle stuff, but of course never actually did) I'm also overly sensitive to any sign of frustration and try to ""fix"" it instantly. I was overly agreeable to anything and he tells me to stop doing that. For awhile he'd suggest a meal and I'd say okay. One day he suggested something I didn't like but I agreed. He had talked to my son and knew I didn't care for it. 

He LOVINGLY got a bit ""stern"" with me and told me to just be me and I didn't have to agree to anything like that, or anything at all. He fell for me because of my personality, my fiestiness, my strength and all of my little quirks I had hidden for years. He said he couldn't even imagine asking me to do, or want me to do such things that my ex wanted and/of expected. That I'm only his. I use that term, ""I'm only his!"" a lot now.

 I didn't even realize how abusive my relationship was until I got out. People continue to tell me how proud they are of me for getting out. Even people that were in ""his world"" (Friends, coworkers, and even a few family members) Everyone saw how bad it was, everyone but me.I'm learning to love myself, know my self worth, and how to be in a relationship that is loving, safe and strong. I'm looking forward to the future for the first time in years.

I know this is super long but I think I just had to type it for my own piece of mind.                  ",2,1753596109.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I need to know if descaling is the only form of cleaning we are supposed to do. I know we should click the 1 cup button before doing a shot of espresso to get rid of the old coffee and stuff.

I was doing research in this sub-Reddit looking to see if others had the same questions as me and I keep seeing some people saying “only use the descale powder our machines can’t do a back flush” and then another group of people saying “oh I put a rubber disk and cleaning tablet and clean my machine that way”

I read in the manual that we should descale it when the lights flash, haven’t had that lights flash yet. Was wondering what the actual correct and final answer is when it comes to cleaning. Do I just worry about descaling when the lights flash, or is there something I should be doing that’s not in the very vague manual.

1maet71,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfaccountable/comments/1maet71/walking_log_july_26_2025/,"Walking Log - July 26, 2025","Hey Fit People,

Well - today was an awesome, but mildly painful day. Lets get into it.

I decided late last night that I needed to get out of my neighborhood and go for a walk, rather than drive anywhere I opted for Stanley Park. The plan was to get there early in the morning... but sleep won out. I still made it there around 1:30pm and took transit.

So when I started walking, the temperature in the GVRD was hovering around 23c and it wasn't as cool as it usually is near the water (I decided to walk along the Sea Wall - beautiful views and so serene).

I started my walk at the Waterfront Station - that's our LRT/Skytrain station (top left picture) and took the scenic route. Got my Hoka's (which feels like walking on air and soooo bouncy!) and started.

https://preview.redd.it/su324y5ktcff1.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac7cfb5c2742733d6cfdd875e06d20157b243b93

It was BUSY - like SUPER BUSY. The last time I went, it was pretty calm, but looks like everyone was out. Lots of locals, and a lot of tourists. The bike path was full! Even the walking path was super busy with runners, and people just walking the path along the sea wall.

https://preview.redd.it/muj2rol2ucff1.png?width=1189&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1ff672a79cd25ddad0f21ecc1e6e235b1e645e6

Top left is a view of Vancouver, BC from the start of the Sea Wall. Bottom left are markers you'll find throughout your walk and finally the bottom right is the Girl in Wetsuit (Girl in a Wetsuit is a life-size 1972 bronze sculpture by Elek Imredy of a woman in a wetsuit, located on a rock in the water along the north side of Stanley Park, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.).

By the time I got here, I had walked around 3km or 4km (remember, I started at the Waterfront Station).

https://preview.redd.it/xpvsgbokucff1.png?width=1188&format=png&auto=webp&s=2a8d6c7dad0d08f5193ecab5450501d721d80d6c

Finally made it to the Lions Gate Bridge - what an amazing view! And of course I'm around 4.5km into Stanley Park or around 8.5km by now. 

https://preview.redd.it/p4s5f8wuucff1.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=9c1afc6b79430769350855e983110ed2958c7d19

Finally, getting to the end.

Looking at the water, it's so peaceful and serene, but also frightening or awe inspiring... I don't know how to swim, so to me it is a bit frightening (I am planning on taking lessons this fall).

So I made it to the 7km mark and I believe this was the last marker along the Sea Wall. There may have been others, but they were ""removed"" - not sure.

Bottom left is Siwash Rock (Siwash Rock is a rock outcropping in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada's Stanley Park. A legend among the Indigenous Squamish people surrounds the rock. It is between 15 and 18 metres tall. It became known to mariners as Nine Pin Rock for its resemblance to a bowling pin.)

Final picture as I'm approaching the end of my walk AND a well deserved lunch/dinner! I had a burger (FYI) and yes, it was delicious!

In total, for the day I walked 21,130 steps or about 16km.

For the actual walk from Waterfront Station to the time I stopped to eat, 17,626 steps or about 13km.

According to Google Fit I burned 1,828 calories on this walk... so I splurged a bit on my lunch.

https://preview.redd.it/mpyx50myvcff1.png?width=1191&format=png&auto=webp&s=fc683a93d5aff987c6fdf2a5c7ac1a9e79a3be73

Here's lunch Went to a place called Vonns - delicious double smash burger, with a Jarritos Cola and fries. I did not eat all the fries, there was too much. I maybe had 20 - the burger was super filling.

Even with such a heavy lunch my meals for the full day came to 1,991 calories.

So my budget is 1,560 subtract the food I ate 1,991 calories add back to that the calories burned 1,828 means I ate only 163 calories making my deficit for the day 1,397.

Because I'm IF I usually stop eating around 7pm but got home around that time, and snacked on fruit and decided around 10:00pm to have a coffee (cream only) so for today my IF started at 10:00pm and will end at 2:00pm tomorrow.

As always, I take too much with me. I took a backpack with a couple of bottles of Zero Calorie sports drink, protein bars (I had two) and two apples (which I did not eat). I also took a couple of towels to wipe myself down with, and extra socks -- but as usual, didn't need them. Then all the other essentials like wallet, power bank(s), phone, over-the-ear headphones...

The backpack probably added an extra 10lbs, I should have weighed it... next time.

Overall I'm happy with how my day went, I had no major spikes in blood sugar even though I had a cola -- but the protein in a double smash burger helped control that.

How was your Saturday? What are you doing to make the most of your summer?

1maesls,https://www.reddit.com/r/gameDevClassifieds/comments/1maesls/hiring_2d_game_artist_cozy_language_learning_app/,[HIRING] 2D Game Artist - Cozy language learning app 🙂,"Hi—I’m Adam, the founder of [Amiko](http://amiko.life/). Amiko is your bilingual best friend—an AI language exchange partner. I’ve studied Korean for 6 years & worked in startups for 4, and I’m finally building the app I wish I had.

If you enjoy learning languages, you’ll love this\~

# Product

Amiko is an AI app for conversational language practice. Each user gets their own Amiko from a certain language/culture. Their Amiko lives a local life in the country, loves texting & calling with you, & wants to help you become fluent 🫶

# Design Vision

One big way Amiko will motivate people to learn languages is by romanticizing the culture 🌆. So it’s important the art style expresses its beauty and richness. Cozy, wholesome, sweet, beautiful, warm, pleasant. And it should be iconic & recognizable—people see it and go “Oh, that’s Amiko!”

There are 3 major components:

1. **Onboarding 👋**
   1. Amiko will have a beautiful, cinematic onboarding (think Stardew Valley, Pokemon). You’re studying a language, but you’re exhausted. Suddenly, you get an email to apply to Amiko, a new language exchange program. You apply... then get matched with your Amiko the next morning!
2. **Characters 👩**
   1. Each character will have a different ethnicity & sex, suited for whatever language they’re learning (Korean guy, American girl, Russian guy)
   2. The characters should not feel too realistic or lifelike. They should feel more… artistic. Less detail is better.
   3. Each Amiko has 1 still image + multiple animated states (talking vs idle)
3. **Backdrops 🖼️**
   1. Backdrop art of where the character is right now. (Inside their bedroom, outside of coffee shop, at the park). Animated (flying birds, twinkling water, swaying trees)

For the art style: I've been thinking... pixel, painted/pastel, geometric, vector-ish, but open to other art styles too! (I like Tolan, Tiny Bookshop, Lofi Girl)

You can see the full design vision [here](https://www.notion.so/Amiko-Design-Vision-233bc1de5e34809f90a5ea76a28ac46a?pvs=21).

# Gig Details

I’m looking for a designer to help with all 3 components—**Onboarding**, **Characters**, & **Backdrops**. You don’t need to to do all 3, but it would be great if you could, since the art style should be consistent.

* We can start with a small contract for a few characters/backdrops. If it’s a good fit, this could turn into larger contracts
* Looking to start ASAP
* Remote
* You’ll be working directly with me, the founder :)
* Flexible budget, USD, prefer PayPal

# Please DM me with

* Your portfolio, pointing out relevant work (onboarding, characters, backdrops)
* Any thoughts or ideas you have around Amiko's design
* Which components you’d be able to work on
* Your rate
* Any clarifying questions",1,1753595892.0,gameDevClassifieds,0,1.0,False

Jett Knight (based off knights of the round table)
Leader/strategist of team JYNX 

Main colors: 




Emblem: Two dice both landing on 3 connected at one of the corners with 4 leafed clovers in each of the middle dots that say loyalty, courage, honor, courtesy. 

Semblance: Shadow Movement, the ability to move within the shadows at ease as long as they are in view, basically turns shadows into portals that lets anything teleport between shadows as long as in view (for now). His Semblance kinda works like portals from Portal, but can become intangible while inside of them or maybe something be learns to do later. Maybe something he does later, his coat is large right? So it casts a big enough shadow for him to portal through. Maybe in the desert he throws the coat up and casts a shadow to start an attack, looks cool visually and a nice look into his strategic mind.

Weapon (Fallen Sun): Wields a Winchester type lever action long rifle with blades on top and bottom of the barrel making a sword-rifle. Also has a shield that doubles as a sheath (Kinda like Jaune's), but has a hole in the bottom so he can shoot even with the sheath on. Transformation: simple, straightens out the handle and folds the stock down to make one continuous handle.  Has a purple ribbon on his shield that Xian gave to him. Main colors: black and gray with gold accents.

Design: A darker tan, muscular person with black hair cut slightly long, slightly below average height, purple eyes, that wears a black overcoat with short sleeves with gold outlines and aspects. (Gold buckle, gold zipper that can take off the bottom part of the jacket, a buckle across the waist of the jacket, a gold square emblem on the sleeves that has three dots similar to a die and a second one diagonally adjacent to it, both touching each others' corners, a detachable hood connected to the coat with a gold zipper) wears goggles similar to ""Pit Vipers"" that keep sand out of his eyes and are equipped with night vision so he can see in the pitch black (even though his Semblance can make him travel through darkness, he still can't see through it) and are black with gold trim. Wears a white shirt with black and gold body armor. Wears black shorts with a black utility belt with gold buckle that holds different kinds Dust rounds, gold and black knee and shin protection, a black leather gold gauntlet on his left hand with his emblem on the back if his hand and black leather combat boots with gold accents. 

Character: Student at Shade Academy, passed entrance exam and was given leadership to team JYNX with his members Yerba, Nickel, and Xian. Strategist that uses his Semblance as a means of transportation and as a battle advantage. His weakness is broad light and open areas (which really sucks since he lives in Vacuo) as the lack both shadows for his Semblance to work and cover to use his ranged weapon, but makes him incredible in forest areas. He keeps himself most the time, but once you get to know him and start feeling comfortable around him, he opens up revealing an animated, smart tactician, though a bit stubborn at times he gets things done through pure will, smarts, and maybe a bit of effort. Can be shut off at times, but once comfortable with you, he shows his true colors of being a jokester and can brush over things sometimes, always wanting more. Can sometimes say wise things, but most the time joking around, except when it comes to battle.

Background: As of the fall of Beacon, he is 18 years old and a student of Vacuo's Shade Academy. His father was a Huntsman who disappeared and presumed dead on a mission in Atlas when he was five.   All that was found of his father was his shield, his left armor gauntlet, and his some of his body armor, which Jett has incorporated into his combat suit. He thinks that life is a gamble and takes the route that he thinks is most worth. He made money for his family and became well known on the streets by 15. His semblance unlocked around the same time when some thugs got angry and he got cornered in an alley he fazed through the shadows and ran away. He worked on his Semblance and fighting at a combat school. He became top of his class and graduated to Shade Academy and was granted leadership of team JYNX.  

Yerba Yusuf 
Tank of team JYNX

Main colors: 




Emblem: A tree on cracked earth

Weapon (EarthShatterer): A large battle axe that turns into two single headed axes and can shoot bullets out of the top end of the axe(s)

Character: Soft spoken and has some wise wisdom. She is also a Vacuo native that remains calm and focused in the face of danger. She is quiet most of the time and basically is the opposite of Xian, but they have the closest bond on the team. Yerba keeps Xian in line and makes sure she doesn't do anything too stupid. 

Design: Darker maybe middle eastern looking, tall and muscular. Wears an orange top that shows her muscles and brown shorts. She wears brown sandals and a yellow cropped jacket with leather gauntlets and bronze armor pieces. Has orangish brown eyes, long coffee colored hair in a ponytail tied with one of Xian's ribbons.

Semblance: Electric-city, can control electric currents, meaning he can control anything that runs on electricity or has electricity in it. 

Weapon (Tridente) : A sniper that can turn into a trident staff that channels electricity.

Uses his trident as a way to get up to high vantage points to support the team and sends information through communicators that he made that are untraceable unlike Scrolls.

Design: Paler skin with blue eyes and blonde crew cut hair. Clad in white armor with blue trims, he clashes with the rest of the crew with their dark and muted colors. He wears white combat boots and solme of the Atlas uniform incorporated in his design. Has one piece of Vacuoian armor that Yerba gave to him. A scanner integrated into his forearm armor with a blue ribbon tied onto his wrist that Xian gave to him.

Xian Hayate
DPS of team JYNX

Main colors:

1maenob,https://www.reddit.com/r/PennStateUniversity/comments/1maenob/behrend_a_tragedy/,Behrend: A Tragedy,"Where do I begin?

**Dorming**

Firstly, I dormed in Niagara Hall... biggest mistake ever. At first, it seemed cozy and omg college experience vibes, but it quickly went downhill. What first-year students don't comprehend about communal dorming, despite everyone warning them, is that even though you are going to college with adults, not everyone has properly matured. A prime example was seen through a boy nicknamed ""The Niagara Sh\*tter"", can you guess what he did? Hint: It involves more than showering in the showers.    But, besides the extremely unhygienic people you'd have to dorm with comes the uncleanliness of the dorm itself. Personally, I could not get over the very niche smell my dorm had; it was like a woody-mold smell. ALL of my clothes started smelling like it, and eventually I started smelling like it too. Oh, btw, the shower heads don't get properly cleaned, so if you twist it open, you'll see a mysterious black gunk (and apparently the water has bleach? I only *heard* about this, but my towel has bleach spots after niagara so idk). Ugh. Lastly, the laundry machines. The amount of gunk you find in there is insane, but the SMELL can get especially bad (what's worse is that the newer buildings have better washers and dryers, so it's not even a campus issue, probably budget cuts so the president can buy herself another private jet flight). TBF, I spent my first semester crashing at my friends' dorm in Ohio, and that place was nice af. But, the nicer the dorm, the farther you are from classes, and those hills are not for the weak. Oh, this also reminds me that you get no kitchen in Niagara, so if you're hungry, you're always going to have to eat out. \*\*PSPS parking's a pain, they don't let you park at Burke (center), so when your car gets snowed in, you have to dig it back out.

**Dobbins Dining Hall**

I won't go too into this because enough could be said in just a sentence, but how can you fail so miserably as a school with something as simple as DINING, where you accidentally leave metal, plastic, etc in the food? One meal at Dobbin's and everyone's chanting: [Burn Dobbins Burn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sC3e8nzdco).

**Bruno's**

The food is okay there, sometimes when you watch them make your food, you don't wanna eat it because they don't wash the produce... like at all. Like, not before prepping, not after, just out of the package into your mouth (Bruno's worker friend witness).

**Paw's and Clark's**

Never open when you want them to be, the coffee always tastes like melted plastic, and they are CONSTANTLY busy (esp @ Clark, shoutout to the lady with the short gray hair, she is the freaking best for keeping morale up there).

**The Weather**

Something everyone was too chill about was the weather. The 10 ft of snow blocking the roads wasn't helpful with getting to places in the already boring area Erie is. What's more fun is that you still have to go to classes in these conditions. I'm naturally tan, in New York during the wintertime, I might be a little lighter, but it's not too bad. In Erie, I turned pale white. They say the snow was so bad this year, and it's fine all the other years, but what about the piercing cold winds? I could barely light a cigarette without my fingers freezing from hypothermia. Make sure to bring winter boots, sweatpants for under your pants, and just layer up in general. (Maybe even get a ski mask, I got a scarf, but it got like wet from breathing).

**Social Scene (from a NYer)**

**This,** I can write a thesis on. Most of you reading about this who go to Behrend or are planning to go are probably from Pittsburgh, so don't take what I'm about to say to heart.        The majority of the student population at Behrend is primarily from Pittsburgh, rural Pennsylvania, or other suburban/rural areas. What does that mean? They are sheltered, uncultured, socially awkward, behind on trends, and overall, emotionally immature. I had heard this a lot growing up from my teachers, but I never really thought that I would feel more mentally mature than someone simply because I am from New York until I came to Behrend. At least 90% of these kids will FEED on you; they are starving for your energy because they are so inexperienced with social interactions. I made so many friends at Behrend, and the number of friends that WEREN'T from a densely populated area (NYC, HTX, the DMV area, LA, SF, etc) that literally FED off of my energy was insane. Now, you might be thinking two things: a. I am probably insane because I'm talking about my ""energy"" and b. Pittsburgh is an urban city too. Why isn't it included? I want to start off by explaining the energy thing. When I say energy, I mean my time, boundaries, and literally my overall sanity. I had so many bad experiences with these villagers; one girl was crying and screaming to our friends that I wouldn't drive her to New York (7 hr drive) for our break (friends accepted her crocodile tears & decided I was the problem), another girl was blatantly racist to / excluding one of my European friends and would also imitate one of our other friend's personality/preferences (super creepy), and when grape allegations had come out about this one guy, the amount of (girl) ""friends"" that either sided with, stayed neutral, or even d\* rode that guy was absolutely insane. On the matter of why I don't include Pittsburgh as one of the many cities to birth emotionally mature adolescents is because y'all aren't actually Pittsburghians. At Behrend, the number of people who would claim to be from Pittsburgh but then be from a bum f\*ck town like ""Cranberry"" is insane. I visited that area, it's literally a VILLAGE (not the actual part of Pittsburgh, that place was pretty).

**Ways I've Dealt w/ Behrend**

I didn't! I completely shut down the entire year and transferred out :) So did all my city-dwelling friends (minus the shutting down part, kinda wish I didn't fail). Overall verdict? **LEAVE**, or just **DON'T COME** at all!

**Engineering / Comp Sci Note**

Most redditors tryna go to Behrend are there for engineering reasons. IDK abt engineering but I was majoring in CMPSC, and we are NOT the best! Thankfully, I passed the intro classes cause I have prior experience, but the teachers are NO help. Coming from NY, I've had many teachers with accents and have understood them well, sometimes even better than my native English speaking teachers. But at Behrend, they hire them straight off the boat (they are **extremely** incomprehensible).

1maenns,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1maenns/best_laptop_backpack_for_travel/,Best Laptop Backpack for Travel,"*Picture this: You're 30,000 feet above the Pacific, the plane hits turbulence, and you hear that stomach-dropping sound of something expensive hitting the floor. Yep, that was my MacBook Pro sliding around in a regular hiking backpack like a hockey puck on ice.*

That $2,000 lesson taught me everything I needed to know about why you absolutely cannot skimp on a proper laptop backpack when you travel. And honestly? After three years of testing different bags across 25 countries (and yes, I counted), I've got some thoughts.

If you're reading this while frantically googling ""best travel laptop backpack"" at 2 AM before your flight tomorrow morning, I've been there. Let me save you from making the same expensive mistakes I did.

# Why Your Regular Backpack Just Won't Cut It

Look, I get it. You've got that trusty old Jansport from college, or maybe a nice hiking pack that ""should work fine."" But here's the thing – traveling with a laptop isn't just about having space for it. It's about protection, organization, and not looking like you're smuggling stolen electronics every time you go through airport security.

The difference between a regular backpack and a proper travel laptop backpack is like the difference between a bicycle and a motorcycle. Sure, they'll both get you there, but one's going to make the journey a whole lot smoother.

When I first started working remotely while traveling, I made every rookie mistake in the book. I stuffed my laptop into whatever bag looked ""big enough,"" wrapped it in a towel (I kid you not), and hoped for the best. The result? A cracked screen in Bangkok, a broken charging port in Berlin, and more stress than anyone needs when they're supposed to be living the dream.

# The Non-Negotiable Features Every Travel Laptop Backpack Needs

After carrying my mobile office through sketchy bus stations, cramped airplane aisles, and questionable hostels, here's what actually matters:

**TSA-Friendly Design (This One's Huge)** Trust me on this – you want a backpack that unzips completely flat with a dedicated laptop compartment. These backpacks have a dedicated laptop pocket, so your computer can be easily scanned by an X-Ray machine without any of your other stuff getting in its way. I've saved literally hours of my life not having to dig through my entire bag at security checkpoints.

The first time I used a TSA-friendly backpack, I actually walked past the security bins thinking I'd forgotten something. Nope – just the beautiful simplicity of keeping my laptop exactly where it belonged.

**Serious Laptop Protection** This isn't just about padding (though that's important too). You want a compartment that actually holds your laptop in place. I learned this the hard way during a particularly bouncy tuk-tuk ride in Cambodia when my laptop was basically ping-ponging around inside my bag.

**Organization That Actually Makes Sense** When you've got a daypack that you're going to use pretty much every day, you want it to be a few things. 1) Comfortable – this bag certainly is. 2) You want it to look half decent – this looks pretty dope. 3) You want it to LAST But beyond that, you need pockets for everything. Chargers, adapters, power banks, cables, passport, phone – all need their own designated spots.

**Comfort for Long Hauls** Airport sprints with a heavy tech load are real. Padded shoulder straps and a breathable back panel aren't luxury features – they're necessities. I once did a 14-hour travel day with a bag that had about as much padding as a manila envelope. My shoulders reminded me of this poor choice for weeks.

# My Top Picks After Years of Testing

**For the Serious Digital Nomad: Nomatic Travel Pack**

Okay, I'll be honest – I was skeptical when everyone kept raving about this bag. It's supposed to be the backpack for digital nomads, and after using it full-time in Asia for over a month, I can see why. The thing that won me over was the organization. Twenty-two pockets might sound excessive until you're living out of a backpack and know exactly where everything is.

The transforming briefcase feature actually works too. I've walked into client meetings looking like a proper professional, not like I just rolled off a overnight bus from Vientiane. Plus, you can find great deals on it through [PackAndGoShop.com](https://packandgoshop.com/), which has become my go-to for quality travel gear.

**For the Budget-Conscious Traveler: BANGE Travel Backpack**

At way under $100 is also difficult to beat! ... If you have a larger laptop, finding the perfect digital nomad backpack can be hard, but the BANGE 35L Travel Backpack can fit a laptop up to 17.3""!

This one surprised me. For the price point, the build quality is impressive, and it'll handle most laptops including those chunky gaming rigs. The expandable design is clever too – starts at 22L for city exploring, expands to 35L when you need extra space.

**For the Comfort Seeker: Osprey Farpoint 40**

The Osprey Farpoint and Fairview Series is a big name when it comes to digital nomad backpacks for a reason! This 40L backpack was previously a much lengthier model, but it has since been remade to exactly fit carry-on restrictions for most, if not all, airlines!

Osprey knows backpacks, and it shows. The comfort level on this thing is unreal – I've worn it for 8+ hours straight without wanting to throw it into traffic. The laptop sleeve is quick-access and well-padded, perfect for those frequent laptop-in-and-out moments.

**For the Style-Conscious Professional: Timbuk2 Authority Deluxe**

The Timbuk2 Authority Deluxe comes equipped with a well-padded dedicated laptop pocket at the back of the pack and a second sleeve embedded in the main compartment to accommodate a second laptop, portable monitor, or tablet.

If you need to look the part in corporate environments, this is your bag. Professional enough for client meetings, functional enough for months on the road. The water resistance has saved my electronics during surprise monsoons more than once.

# The Airport Security Game-Changer

Let me tell you about the moment I became a true believer in TSA-friendly bags. I was rushing through Bangkok's airport, already cutting it close for my connection, when I realized I was in the ""laptop out"" security line. The person in front of me was practically performing surgery on their bag, pulling out cables, adapters, and what looked like half of Best Buy.

Meanwhile, I unzipped my backpack flat, left my laptop right where it was, and sailed through in under 30 seconds. This feature allows you to keep your laptop inside the backpack, so you can zip it up and quickly walk to your gate after you get through security.

Now, fair warning – not every security checkpoint recognizes TSA-friendly bags, and international airports vary wildly. But when it works, it's magical. Even when I do have to remove my laptop, having it in a dedicated, easily accessible compartment makes the whole process infinitely smoother.

# Common Mistakes I See (And Made Myself)

**Going Too Big** More space sounds better in theory, but trust me – if there is space in your pack it will be filled! In other words, if you're traveling with an 85-liter backpack, you WILL end up packing it full and preceding to lug it around every train, bus, and tuk-tuk that you board. Stick to 30-45L unless you're really planning to live out of one bag for months.

**Ignoring Weight Distribution** Even the best backpack becomes torture if it's poorly packed. Laptop goes against your back, heaviest items in the middle, lighter stuff towards the outside. This isn't just comfort – it's physics.

**Forgetting About Daily Use** You might focus on the big travel days, but remember – you'll be using this bag daily. Coffee shop visits, coworking spaces, client meetings. Make sure it works for your regular routine, not just airport marathons.

**Skipping the Test Run** Please, for the love of all that's caffeinated, do a test run before your big trip. Load it up with your actual gear and wear it around for a few hours. Your shoulders will thank you.

# The Real-World Durability Test

Over the past two years, my current setup has survived: monsoon season in Vietnam, the dusty chaos of Indian train stations, being dropped off a boat in Thailand (don't ask), overstuffed overhead bins, and the general abuse that comes with constant travel.

The zippers are still smooth, the padding hasn't compressed into cardboard, and my laptop has remained gloriously intact. That's the kind of durability you're paying for with a quality travel laptop backpack.

# Making the Investment Count

Look, a proper travel laptop backpack isn't cheap. You're looking at anywhere from $80 to $400+ depending on features and brand. But here's how I think about it – this bag is protecting equipment worth thousands of dollars and your ability to work from anywhere.

When you break it down per use over even a year of travel, it's one of the best investments you can make. Plus, many of these bags come with excellent warranties. My Osprey has a lifetime guarantee, and they actually honor it.

For the best selection and deals, I typically check [PackAndGoShop.com](https://packandgoshop.com/) first – they often have sales on quality travel gear that you won't find elsewhere.

# Your Next Steps

If you're still reading, you're probably convinced you need an upgrade. Here's what I'd do if I were buying my first travel laptop backpack today:

1. **Measure your laptop** (including any case you use)
2. **Consider your travel style** – business trips vs. backpacking vs. digital nomad life
3. **Set a realistic budget** – remember this is protecting expensive equipment
4. **Read actual user reviews** from fellow travelers, not just tech bloggers
5. **Test the weight** – load it up and walk around the store

The perfect laptop backpack feels like a natural extension of your travel setup. When you find the right one, you'll wonder how you ever managed without it.

Alpha’s Hidden Heir
Chapter 1
In this city’s most glittering circle of power and wealth, I’ve always been invisible—

Except for one title: Donovan Barton’s woman.

He’s the king under the moonlight. Cold. Arrogant. Untouchable.

And me? I’m the caged canary he keeps.

I’m the only Omega in this elite circle without a family name to back me.

So at every socialite gathering, I’m an easy target.

The only reason I’m even allowed a seat at the table with these women, is because I know my place. I’m tactful. I’m smart enough to stay in my lane.

That’s why, even after nearly two years with Donovan—his longest-kept mistress—

I never act smug. Never flaunt. Never forget where I stand.

Right now, I’m doing what I do best: sitting in the quietest corner, happily nibbling on a macaron.

But at some point, the topic of conversation circles back to me.

“Mrs. Barton, we’ve all been dying to ask… Alpha Donovan always seems so cold and buttoned-up…”

No title is noble enough to shield a woman from gossip.

“Is he the same way in bed?”

“I get nervous just making eye contact with him. Doesn’t he scare you?”

“Is he rough in private?”

“He seems impossible to deal with—how’d you even land him?”

“Come on, spill it—bet he’s incredible in bed, isn’t he?”

My hand trembled slightly, nearly dropping my fork.

“Well… he’s just… average, really.”

“No way! He does not look like the ‘average’ type!”

“He’s always working. We barely see each other…”

I mumbled a few more vague excuses, squirming in my seat—until my phone rang.

The screen lit up with one word: oversize.

I nearly sighed in relief.

Excusing myself, I stepped aside to answer.

Donovan’s voice came through low and tired: “Having coffee?”

“Mhm. I also did a little shopping.”

“What’d you get?”

“A purse. And a necklace.”

“Buy a new dress, too.”

“I already did…”

“A nightgown.”

“Mr. Barton—”

“What do you call me?”

“…Donovan.”

My cheeks flushed hot. I glanced around like a thief and quickly turned off the speaker.

“I’ll pick you up in an hour,” he said, and hung up—his tone leaving no room for negotiation.

So I left the party early… and bought a new black lace slip.

Plunging neckline. Slits on both sides.

Silky, sheer, and sinfully soft.

As soon as I got in the car, Donovan crooked a finger. “Come here.”

I climbed onto his lap like a good girl.

Fresh from a full-body spa treatment, my skin was smooth and soft, my scent faintly sweet.

I melted against his chest, boneless and pliant.

Donovan was clearly pleased. He took off his glasses and tossed them into the console.

Then slid his long fingers around my waist. “Gained weight?”

He gave a firm squeeze, but his tone was oddly satisfied.

“I’ve been eating a little too much lately… I’ll start dieting tomorrow.”

Even after two years, moments like this still made me shy.

My ears turned red.

“No need to lose weight. I like you just like this.”

He held me tighter. I rested my head on his chest.

“Alpha, you just got back from a business trip… But you still pick me up. You must be exhausted.”

“Then shouldn’t you be rewarding me tonight?”

I looked up, flustered. “Shouldn’t you be…recovering your strength?”

Donovan chuckled low in his throat. His hand slid down my back, unfastening my strap.

“Little minx. You’re getting bold.”

“I’m just worried about your health…”

His eyes traveled slowly down my body, dark and molten.

He lifted a finger, brushing against the delicate lace at my collarbone.

“Well, I suppose ‘average’ doesn’t quite cut it for our refined little Mrs. Barton.”

My eyes flew wide. The fingers I had curled around his waist suddenly went cold.

“Donovan…”

I lost track of how many times I begged for mercy that night.

My limbs were too soft to cling to him, drooping helplessly over the side of the bed.

Donovan leaned down and captured my swollen lips again.

“Donovan!”

It’s a chill Sunday and I’m just curious — how’s everyone spending their day? Any cool recommendations for places to chill, grab coffee, or try some good food around the city?

I’m thinking of stepping out later — maybe sainikpuri side if I’m feeling touristy. 😄

It’s a tale as old as time—recently divorced woman crushes on personal trainer and I hate it lol. 

For a little background, about two years ago I decided to finally separate from my then-husband. Without going into all the horrible details, we weren’t in a good place, he had abused me and lied to me, and I started to really struggle with my health. As part of my health journey while living alone, I began seeing a personal trainer. It ended up being incredibly life changing. My trainer and I had a lot in common and I enjoyed talking to him so much that I kept going back because of it. Sometimes our sessions would run long because we’d chat so much (I always checked in with him and it was his call since he would have gaps between clients). We even started exchanging books at one point and every week we would talk about what we read. 

My health problems started melting away, I lost all the weight I gained out of the stress of my relationship, and life just generally got better. I also developed a crush him. I squashed my feelings hard because I was still married at the time, but it opened my eyes too. I realized that it was time to ask for a divorce—not for the potential of these feelings, but the fact that I was so much happier on my own and I was finally living the life I wanted to live. Without the constant trauma of that relationship, I was thriving. I was happier, healthier, and full of hope. 

Fast forward, I’ve been going to training for about a year and a half. I’m divorced now and been through all the ups and downs of it. Coming to training and talking to him has helped me through a lot of it. He’s aware of some of my situation, but he doesn’t know the impact he’s had. As my own way of thanking him over time, I’d give him little gifts. Like cucumbers from my garden or a hand knit dish cloth in his favorite color for his birthday. He even bought me a birthday present recently—a special edition book from my favorite series and a book he loved and wanted me to read. 

So here’s where I’m at now—I’m about to end training. I committed myself to going for at least a year as a fitness goal and to learn how to actually work out, but I can’t afford it in the long term. I signed up for a gym and he’s been prepping me to do work outs on my own. At the very least I’d like to continue being his friend, but I also have the itch to just go for it and ask him out. Sometimes I get the feeling he just thinks I’m a fun client and enjoys talking to me, sometimes I think he sees me as an actual friend, and sometimes I swear he’s flirting with me (in a very appropriate and professional way). 

I feel like we’re in a stale mate. If he does have feelings for me, I’m sure he feels he can’t make me feel uncomfortable as a client. Similarly as a client, I feel like there’s a power imbalance and that if I ask him out it puts him in an awkward position. Part of me feels I should just give him an opening to ask me out after I finally end my sessions. An invitation to keep in touch or grab coffee sometime and see if he takes me up on the offer. But what if he never takes it because he still views me as a “potential client” even if I stop sessions with him? On the other hand, I just want to rip off the bandaid and ask him out already. Life is messy and imperfect sometimes, right? But I’m worried that’s my “newly divorced brain” just trying to fill a void, even if this does feel like a real connection. I don’t want to do that to him. The last option is that is that I just need to let this one go… which is really the answer I don’t want to hear.

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Misery**  
Let’s start with the numbers, because even in soccer, math doesn’t lie (unlike referees). Ulsan Hyundai FC is the slight favorite across bookmakers, with decimal odds hovering around **2.15** (implying a **46.5% implied probability** of victory). Gangwon FC, the underdog, sits at **3.25** (a **30.8% chance**), while the draw is priced at **3.30** (a **30.3% chance**). The spread favors Ulsan by a hair (-0.25), and the total goals line is set at **2.25-2.5**, with the under heavily backed. In simpler terms: this game is expected to be as thrilling as a spreadsheet audit, with neither team scoring enough to make your coffee go cold.

**Digesting the News: Recent Losses, Recent Lamentations**  
Both teams come into this clash with bruised egos. Gangwon FC was handed a 2-0 drubbing by Jeonbuk, a team that apparently still believes in “defense.” Ulsan Hyundai fared slightly better, losing 2-1 to Daejeon in a match where their attack looked like a group of toddlers trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube. Coach Kim Eun-joong’s “winning mentality” speech might’ve inspired Suwon FC, but Ulsan’s players seem to have mistaken it for a nap-time directive.

The standings? A tight race for 7th and 9th, separated by a single point. Neither team has the hunger of a hungry man in a pizza shop—they just

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you dreaming of a spacious living space that combines functionality with a touch of rustic charm? A two story metal building home, often referred to as a barndominium, could be the ideal solution for you. These homes not only boast expansive layouts but also offer versatility that suits various lifestyles. Let’s explore some exciting layouts and design ideas that might just inspire your dream home.

The first thing to consider is the overall layout of your two story metal building home. Depending on your needs, you might opt for an open floor plan. This design minimizes barriers and enhances natural light, making your space feel even larger. You can visualize a generously sized living room or kitchen area seamlessly connecting to dining spaces, which promotes togetherness.

For those with larger families or who often host guests, consider a layout that features multiple living zones. Here's a quick breakdown of what that could look like:

- **First Floor:**
- Spacious open concept living and kitchen area
- Dining area that flows from the kitchen
- A separate guest room or home office
- Utility room with laundry and storage space
 
- **Second Floor:**
- Master bedroom with a large en-suite bathroom
- Additional bedrooms with shared bathroom
- A cozy loft space that can serve as a play area, reading nook, or home theater
 

This layered approach allows family members and guests to enjoy privacy while still making it easy to gather in common areas. With a two story metal building, you can maximize your square footage without compromising comfort.

When planning your barndominium, think about how natural light plays a role in your living space. Large windows in both floors can create a bright and inviting atmosphere. You might even consider skylights in the upper levels to further enhance the feeling of openness. Combining these elements can reduce your reliance on artificial lighting and save on energy bills.

Another exciting aspect of two story metal building homes is the opportunity to create outdoor living spaces. Balconies can be added on the second level, providing stunning views of the surrounding landscape. These spaces can serve as private retreats or entertaining areas for friends and family. Imagine sipping coffee on your balcony with the morning sun, or hosting barbecues in your backyard.

As you design your barndominium, remember that the metal structure itself offers benefits you might not have considered. Metal is durable and requires less maintenance than traditional wood, making it a smart choice for your home. You can also customize the exterior finish to match your style; whether you prefer a modern look with sleek lines or a more traditional rustic appearance, metal can adapt to fit your vision.

When choosing colors and materials, think about how they can add warmth and style to your two story metal building home. Wood accents, stone features, or even bright pops of color can create a striking contrast against the backdrop of metal. Choose a color palette that reflects your personality and sets the mood for your home.

Energy-efficient solutions can further enhance your barndominium's appeal. Consider options like solar panels, eco-friendly insulation, and high-efficiency windows. These upgrades can help you save money on utility expenses and reduce your environmental footprint, making your home not just beautiful but also sustainable.

With the right planning and creativity, your two story metal building home can become a dream come true. Think about your lifestyle and needs, the importance of open spaces, and the aesthetics you want to achieve. As you move forward with your design, keep in mind the flexibility that barndominiums provide. Transforming metal buildings into warm, inviting homes doesn’t just elevate your living experience; it gives you a space to thrive.

Are you ready to start your journey of creating the perfect spacious barndominium layout? From family gatherings to tranquil retreats, your two story metal building home can be designed to accommodate it all.

Benefits of Two Story Metal Building Homes: The Appeal of Combining Functionality and Aesthetics
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In recent years, the trend of two-story metal building homes has gained significant traction among homeowners seeking space, aesthetics, and practicality. These structures, often referred to as barndominiums, effortlessly blend functionality with attractive design. Below are several key benefits that highlight why two-story metal building homes are an appealing choice for many people today.

### Spacious Living Areas

One of the primary advantages of two-story metal building homes is the sheer amount of space they provide. With two levels, homeowners can enjoy expansive living quarters without compromising on yard space. The upstairs can serve as private quarters, featuring bedrooms and bathrooms, while the downstairs can be dedicated to shared spaces like living rooms, dining areas, and kitchens. This layout can be particularly appealing for families, as it allows for privacy while still encouraging togetherness.

### Cost-Effective Construction

Building a two-story metal home can prove to be more cost-effective than traditional homes. Metal structures often require less maintenance and have lower long-term costs. The durability of metal means fewer repairs over time, and that can lead to significant savings. Here are some reasons why these buildings help keep costs down:

- **Lower Material Costs:** Metal is generally cheaper and easier to source than wood, making for a more affordable construction process.
- **Faster Build Times:** Two-story metal building homes can often be erected more quickly, which means lower labor costs.
- **Energy Efficiency:** Many metal buildings are designed with energy efficiency in mind, reducing utility bills.

### Eco-Friendly Options

Going green is a significant consideration for many modern homeowners, and two-story metal building homes can be very eco-friendly. The metal used in construction is often recycled and can be recycled again at the end of its lifecycle. Additionally, these homes can be designed to optimize natural light, decreasing reliance on artificial lighting and reducing energy consumption.

### Customizable Designs

Metal building homes offer versatility in design, helping homeowners create a space that truly reflects their style. You can customize everything from the layout to the exterior finish. Some homeowners opt for traditional looks, while others push the envelope with modern aesthetics. Here are some custom features you might consider:

- **Exterior Finishes:** Choose from various materials like wood, stone, or metal siding to complement the landscape.
- **Floor Plans:** Tailor the floor plan to meet specific family needs, whether that means an open layout or designated rooms for different purposes.
- **Interior Features:** From high ceilings to large windows, the inside of a barndominium can be designed for comfort and beauty.

### Durability and Safety

Two-story metal building homes provide peace of mind due to their sturdiness. Metal construction can withstand severe weather better than wood homes. It’s resistant to pests and mold, which can be particularly problematic in more humid climates. The safety aspect also extends to fire resistance. Because metal doesn’t burn, homeowners can feel safe knowing their two-story home has built-in protections.

### Rural Appeal

These homes often find their way into rural settings where land is more available, and farm-style living is appreciated. The barndominium style complements natural surroundings, creating a harmonious blend between your home and its environment. Whether you're hoping to live on a hobby farm, enjoy wide-open spaces, or simply prefer a serene setting, a two-story metal building home is a charming option.

Two-story metal building homes provide the best of both worlds—functionality and aesthetics. The spacious layouts, cost efficiency, eco-friendliness, customizable designs, and durability make them an appealing choice for today's homeowners. Whether you are starting a new family or looking to downsize without sacrificing comfort, these homes offer a welcoming environment that checks all the boxes. Embracing such versatile living can lead to not only a beautiful home but also a thriving lifestyle.

### Conclusion

Creating your ideal two story metal building home can truly be an exciting journey. Whether you’re captivated by the spaciousness of barndominium layouts or drawn to the many benefits these structures offer, there’s no shortage of possibilities. These homes combine functionality with aesthetics, allowing you to enjoy substantial living spaces without sacrificing design appeal.

One of the most appealing aspects of two story metal building homes is their versatility. You have the opportunity to design your layout around the needs of your family. With multiple levels, you can easily separate living areas, providing privacy while still being connected. Imagine having generous entertaining spaces on the lower level, with bedrooms or a cozy office tucked away upstairs!

The advantages of metal building homes extend beyond mere space. Their durability and energy efficiency make them a smart choice for homeowners looking to invest wisely. Additionally, the unique charm of barndominiums adds character to your property, setting it apart in any neighborhood.

Ultimately, the possibility of customizing your two story metal building home to suit your lifestyle is truly enriching. When you design a space that reflects your style and meets your needs, every moment spent in your home becomes a joy. Take the leap to create a functional and beautiful sanctuary, and enjoy the unmatched benefits that come with barndominium living. The perfect blend of modern design and traditional comfort awaits, inviting you to make your dream home a reality.",1,1753594946.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

**- - -**

Guillaume had managed to lecture for nearly twelve minutes before partial immersion.

He hadn’t planned to visit Cory. It would be selfish, and likely obvious to the rabid note-takers in the front row who hung on his every word. Immersion, complete or otherwise, always carried the risk of dissociation. Two packets of gritty instant coffee accompanied further deliberation; promises upon promises that he’d stay clear.

Despite this, Guillaume put up little resistance later that morning when the lecture hall began to fade around his peripheral vision. The projector’s glow paled, then grew, mimicking light from his old apartment’s half-burnt bulbs and approximating dawnlight trickling through broken blinds.

The memories often began gently. It might be nice, he thought, if it weren’t so dangerous. Easing into immersion resulted in what a recent class-action lawsuit had termed a *pseudoepisodic state*: a period in which reality and recall would become significantly conflated. The technicians hadn’t warned him of this when installing the anchor, as it was designed to be activated in controlled environments only.

He waited to see what would emerge first. Most days it was the coffeemaker. He had figured it was due to the usual morning routine often sticking in his memory. But the coffeemaker did not appear. Perhaps, then, it would be the bowl of fruit, a wire basket that really didn’t contain much fruit at all save for a lone pear and a dessicated apple stem. No such pear or stem surfaced. Today it was the pencil, rife with teeth marks and worn nearly to the eraser, ergonomics be damned.

It was balanced atop the *Games and Puzzles* section of the rapidly-materializing daily newspaper, which had been neatly folded lengthwise. It had been opened to the day’s crossword page, the corner faintly smudged. Guillaume had forgotten how often Cory would lick his thumb to turn pages. It was only after a recent immersion that he had noticed the damp crescent-shaped divot left in the stack of thin newsprint. A voice pulled him from the inspection.

“Your turn.”

Guillaume had realized quickly after installation that Cory never appeared immediately. The anchor, despite its sophistication, still needed time to spin up the memory architecture. The first time he had immersed himself, he’d worried that he’d done something wrong, or that the anchor hadn’t been able to extract a sufficient amount of data from the formatted memory. But when Cory finally emerged all at once, it was as if he'd been there all along.

“Two down. ‘Small form factor,’ apparently,” Cory said.

Like always, Cory sat cross-legged on the flattened cushion of the window seat, newspaper now spread across one knee. Slanted lines of morning light ran across his forearms. Guillaume looked to his side. The projector and the desk were gone now, replaced by another window. Snow dusted the edge of the outside sill and wisped into vapor against the glass. It was—had been—early February.

“Compact?” Guillaume listened to himself ask, prompting a pleased hum from Cory.

“Well done, professor,” he said, without looking up.

Guillaume felt his mouth draw itself into a curve, corners crinkling. He had smiled that day, and so he smiled now.  
  
\*	\*	\*  
  
The back of the lecture hall was noticeably sparser when Guillaume blinked his way back to lucidity. Some students had begun to whisper between one another, the front-rowers almost loud enough to be understood. Certainly loud enough to pick up concern in their voices.

According to his watch, the immersion had lasted just under four minutes. A small fraction of the maximum possible half-hour duration. Completely understandable, of course; a brief lapse. He made no apology, as there was nothing to apologize for. Instead, he adjusted his notes and cleared his throat once, then twice, his voice sluggishly crawling back up his windpipe.

“The mythologization of empire,” he began, “relies on selection, not preservation. History is as much a product of omission as it is of record.”  
  
\*	\*	\*  
  
In the faculty lounge during lunch, his colleague Emily had cornered him with a certain level of polite concern that was hard to ignore. He supposed that was the point.

“Heard you immersed during your eight o’clock,” she said after the pleasantries had worn thin. “For how long, five minutes? Ten?”

“Four,” he said. “Barely four minutes. You know that can happen sometimes when the anchor misfires.”

“Didn’t it misfire last time, too?” She angled her head in the way that she often did when asking questions that weren’t questions.

Guillaume looked down into his tea, which had cooled considerably since they’d started speaking.

“Have you considered spacing them out more?” asked Emily. “I know that Februaries are hard for you, but there are university protocols when these things happen in public. The dean’s office might start taking a closer look.”

“They already have,” Guillaume said. “I’m still within the acceptable immersion count for the month.”

“But it’s not about how many, Guillaume, it’s about *when*. We’re barely a week into February. You’re gonna burn right through your allotment and crash. And frankly, it hurts me to see you like this.”

“I’m sorry you feel that way.” He made himself drink the tea, chilly as it was.

Emily broke the silence after a few moments, abandoning her head-tilt. “I get it, you know. My brother had it done right before his last deployment, blew his nest egg on the latest model. Said it helped him sleep when he got back—for a while.”

She didn’t elaborate, and Guillaume didn’t prod further. Stories like those were, after all, lies or outliers.

1maeia2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1maeia2/eulogy_for_my_dad/,Eulogy for my dad,"I wrote a eulogy for my dad at his funeral service today. It's my first time ever writing one for my first true family passing. So I just wanted to run it by to see if it is appropriate or not, since it is not really a memory of him, rather what I've learned from this experience and lessons. Would love feedback or suggestions to make and improve:

# INTRO

My father was a strong, dedicated man who devoted his life to his family. Many of you already know how incredible he was, so I don’t need to add any more words on that.

He was born in \_\_ and came to america in the early 80s, a simpler time. 

Despite not knowing English, he worked insanely hard to try and live the ""American dream"". 

He landed a factory job which eventually led him to a 9-5

and slowly built his dream of having a family and a home in California.

He often told me, “Everything has a solution except death.” When I was younger, I didn’t fully understand it, but now I do. It was his way of saying: don’t panic, don’t give up, and don’t let fear stop you” 

As long as we’re alive, we can act, change, grow, and move forward. That lesson has stayed with me and brings me peace.

Though my father is no longer physically here, his voice and values continue to resonate with me. 

In the days since his passing, I’ve come to realize that he’s still teaching me—just in a different way. Today, I want to share some of those lessons with you. 

This is not only a tribute to him but also a reflection on the wisdom he imparted and how it continues to guide me. These lessons have become a source of healing, a way to keep him close to my heart, and I hope they might offer comfort to anyone here who is sharing in this pain with us.

**UNPREDICTABILITY**

My father was one of the strongest persons I’ve ever known. I never saw him sick—not once. Even when COVID hit, he brushed it off with just a cough. So when he passed, it completely took me and my family by surprise. I wasn’t ready. But in his death, he left me this lesson: life is unpredictable. 

And he was right. Life doesn’t always come with a warning. Even when it does, it’s not always the end of the story. While we can't control when our end is, we can certainly control our reaction and we have the power to control the way we respond with the moments we’re given.

My dad’s strength and vigor taught me to trust in God and to find my own inner strength—not just for myself, but for the people who need me. That’s why I stand here today giving this speech. I’m staying strong because I know it’s what he would want. And because sometimes, others may need my strength to hold on to as well to move forward.  


**LEARNING NEVER STOPS**

There is something very strange about death -  not only does it reunite people, but it also shapes ordinary moments into sacred memories. 

For years, bringing my dad coffee whenever I traveled was our thing. I’d land somewhere, find a coffee that made me think of him, and bring it back.

And he loved it.

But honestly, it wasn’t just about the coffee. It was about the gesture—the connection we shared over something so simple, yet so meaningful.

Now I see I can’t do that anymore—I won’t get to hand him that bag of coffee or hear his disappointment of how China has the strongest yet worst coffee he’s ever tasted.

Losing him taught me an unexpected lesson: it’s the small, everyday moments that leave the deepest imprint. These are the memories that linger, the ones you hold onto long after something or someone is gone.

And I know his lessons aren't finished yet. Decades from now, I’ll still uncover the quiet wisdom he left behind—shared subtly, patiently, and in his own unique way.

**FAMILY IS EVERYTHING**

Life has such a interesting way of reminding us we’re human beings. We simply cannot escape disappointment, heartbreak, failure, betrayal and loss. But among all that, they teache us empathy, resilience, and helps us find new purpose. And it can become chaotic to varying degrees.

But through all of that, one thing has always been constant: my family.

My dad and I shared a bond that was uniquely ours. From the outside, people might say my family is dysfunctional. And honestly, they’re not wrong. My dad and I argued, a lot. And he had this super power ability to make my blood boil in seconds. And I accepted that because that’s my dad.

Apart from our differences, he was also the one person in my life who showed me what unconditional love truly looked and felt like.

He was the first to stand next to me while I was sick, the first to offer help when I was in trouble, and somehow, he always knew when I was hurting—even if I didn’t say a word.

Beyond family, he taught me the invaluable lesson of standing strong on my own two feet, ensuring I could support my loved ones just as he supported me.

Today, I stand here with a deep understanding of why he placed such emphasis on independence. He knew this day would come, and he wanted me to be prepared—to face pain, adjust, and keep moving forward.

# FINALE

Dad, I know you can hear me now, and I want you to know this: 

it was your stubbornness, our arguments, your playful morning pranks, and even your relentless nagging that allows me to stand here talking do you and everyone here. This strength is a gift I could never ask for from anyone else, and it’s a lesson I’ll carry with me for the rest of my life.

So, when we meet again, I know we’ll still argue like we did just a few weeks ago, only to laugh about it moments later—just like old times.

Dad, I love you, and I will miss you forever.

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a match that’s as unpredictable as a seagull’s diet—*Canterbury Bulldogs* (the team, not the actual bankstown terriers) take on the *Manly Sea Eagles*, and let’s just say, the odds are as clear as a Sydney morning if you’ve never looked up “sunset” on Google.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

The Bulldogs are the slight favorites here, perched at **-150** (1.62 decimal), implying a **61.7% win chance**. The Sea Eagles, meanwhile, are priced at **+238** (2.38 decimal), suggesting bookmakers think they’ve got a **41.6% shot**. The draw? A laughable **4.5%**—probably for people who bet while napping.

The spread is **Bulldogs -3.5** (1.83–1.91 odds) and **+3.5 for Manly** (1.91–1.87). The total points line hovers around **44.5–43.5**, with the over/under split at **1.95–1.81**. So, if you’re betting on chaos, the over is your friend. If you’re betting on “meh,” go under.

Key stats? The Bulldogs have slumped in their last four games, dropping to third on the ladder. The Sea Eagles? They’re the NRL’s version of a weather vane—spinning between “top eight hopefuls” and “also-rans” all season.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Returns, and Sea Shanties

The Bulldogs have gotten a boost with **Bronson Xerri** back in the fold. The centre’s return is like giving a toaster a coffee—suddenly, it’s *alive*. Without him, their attack was about as thrilling as a tax audit.

The Sea Eagles, meanwhile, welcome back **Haumole Olakau’atu**, their star back rower. Imagine a ship’s captain returning after a three-week voyage to retrieve a missing anchor—that’s Manly’s defense post-Ola. But let’s not forget: the Sea Eagles have been inconsistent enough to make a rollercoaster look reliable.

Injury reports? Bo

# Best Camper Table Legs 2025: Reviews & Buying Guide

Camper table legs are an essential component for any RV or camper,providing a stable and adjustable surface for dining,working,or playing games. Choosing the right table legs can substantially enhance the comfort and functionality of your mobile living space.

This guide will explore the key features, benefits, and considerations when selecting camper table legs in 2025. We'll delve into different types, materials, and functionalities to help you make an informed decision and find the perfect legs to suit your specific needs and preferences.

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of camper table legs available on the market includes many options.

**Adjustable Height:**

Adjustable height is arguably the most crucial feature of camper table legs. It allows you to customize the table's height to suit different activities and users. look for legs that offer a wide range of adjustment, typically from around 20 inches for a low coffee table to 30 inches or more for a dining table. The adjustment mechanism should be easy to use and secure, preventing the table from collapsing or wobbling. Pneumatic or hydraulic systems can provide smooth and effortless height adjustments.

**Durable Materials:**

The durability of camper table legs is paramount, as they need to withstand the rigors of travel and frequent use. Aluminum is a popular choice due to its lightweight and corrosion-resistant properties. Steel legs offer exceptional strength and stability but are heavier. Look for high-quality finishes that protect the legs from scratches, rust, and other forms of damage. Powder coating is a durable and attractive option.

**Easy Installation:**

The ease of installation is a key consideration for many camper owners. Table legs that come with pre-drilled holes and mounting hardware simplify the installation process. Quick-release mechanisms allow for easy removal and storage of the table when not in use. Consider the type of flooring in your camper and choose mounting hardware that is appropriate for the material. Some legs may require specialized tools or professional installation, so factor that into your decision.

**Compact Storage:**

Space is always at a premium in a camper, so choosing table legs that can be easily stored is essential. Telescoping legs that collapse down to a compact size are a great option. Folding legs also offer a space-saving storage solution. Look for legs that come with storage bags or straps to keep them organized and prevent them from scratching other items.

**Weight Capacity:**

The weight capacity of camper table legs is a critical factor to consider, especially if you plan to use a heavy tabletop or place heavy items on the table. Choose legs that can support significantly more weight than you anticipate needing to avoid any risk of collapse.Check the manufacturer's specifications for the maximum weight capacity and ensure that it meets your requirements.

**Stability and Wobble Resistance:**

The stability of camper table legs is crucial for providing a safe and comfortable surface. Look for legs with a wide base or adjustable feet to compensate for uneven surfaces. Locking mechanisms and secure connections between the legs and the tabletop help to prevent wobble. Consider legs with a triangular or A-frame design for added stability. Testing the legs before purchasing them can help you assess their stability and wobble resistance.

## Core Benefits

Selecting the right camper table legs offers several practical benefits for enhancing your RV experience.

**Increased Versatility:** The ability to adjust the height of your table allows you to adapt it to various uses, such as dining, working, or playing games.You can easily transform your dining table into a coffee table or a workstation by simply adjusting the legs. This versatility maximizes the use of limited space in your camper.**Improved Comfort:** The adjustability of camper table legs ensures that you can find a comfortable seating position, regardless of your height or the type of activity you are doing. This is especially important for those who spend extended periods in their camper.Proper table height can also reduce strain on your back and neck.

**Enhanced Space Saving:** Compact storage options, such as telescoping or folding legs, free up valuable space in your camper when the table is not in use. This allows you to maximize the usable area and avoid clutter. Easy removal and installation also contribute to space-saving convenience.

**Greater Stability and safety:** Sturdy table legs provide a stable and safe surface for eating, working, or placing drinks. this reduces the risk of spills or accidents and ensures that your items remain secure. Wobble-resistant designs and adjustable feet compensate for uneven surfaces, providing a level and reliable platform.**long-term Durability and Value:** Investing in high-quality camper table legs ensures that they will withstand the rigors of travel and frequent use, providing long-term value. Durable materials and finishes protect the legs from damage, extending their lifespan. This reduces the need for replacement and saves you money in the long run.

## FAQs Section

**Are these table legs compatible with all camper tabletops?**
Generally, camper table legs are designed to be compatible with a wide range of tabletops. Though, it's crucial to check the mounting hole patterns and the weight capacity of the legs to ensure they match your specific tabletop dimensions and material. if you have an unusually thick or heavy tabletop, you may need to use specialized mounting hardware or reinforce the connection points.

**What tools are required for installation?**
The tools needed for installation depend on the type of table legs and the material of your camper floor and tabletop. typically, you'll need a drill, screwdriver, measuring tape, and possibly a level.If you're installing the legs on a wooden floor, wood screws and a drill bit may suffice. For metal or fiberglass surfaces, you might need self-tapping screws and a metal drill bit. Always refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific tool requirements.

**How do I adjust the height of the table legs?**
The adjustment mechanism varies depending on the type of table legs. Some legs use a simple pin-and-hole system, while others use a locking lever or a pneumatic system.To adjust the height, typically you'll need to release the locking mechanism, extend or retract the legs to the desired height, and then re-engage the locking mechanism to secure the legs in place. Always ensure that all legs are adjusted to the same height to maintain a level surface.

**What is the typical weight capacity of these table legs?**
The weight capacity of camper table legs varies depending on the materials, design, and size. Lighter-duty legs may have a weight capacity of around 50 pounds, while heavier-duty legs can support up to 200 pounds or more. Always check the manufacturer's specifications for the maximum weight capacity and ensure that it meets your needs. It's always better to choose legs with a higher weight capacity than you think you'll need to avoid any risk of collapse.

## Competitor Comparison

Let's compare three different camper table leg options: a premium adjustable aluminum set, a budget-friendly steel option, and a lightweight folding leg.### Product Comparison Overview

#### Premium Adjustable Aluminum Table Legs

* **Material:** Lightweight and corrosion-resistant aluminum alloy

* **Adjustment:** Pneumatic gas spring for smooth and effortless height adjustment

* **Stability Features:** Wide base with adjustable leveling feet, locking mechanism

* **storage:** Telescoping design for compact storage

#### Budget-Friendly steel Table Legs

* **Material:** Durable steel with powder-coated finish

#### Lightweight Folding Table Leg

The lightweight folding leg is ideal for those who prioritize portability and ease of storage, but it offers limited functionality and adjustability. Ultimately, the best choice depends on your specific needs, budget, and priorities.

## Ideal User Profile

1mae8ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1mae8ts/new_mom_struggling/,New mom struggling,"FTM here. Feel like my life has changed completely since having a baby. My LO is 8.5 months old and I live in a different city than my family. My husband works FT Monday-Friday and arrives home after 5 pm. He does help with baby bath and sleep after 7:30 pm-9 pm. But prior to 7:30 pm, I have to prepare food, feed solid to baby, clean up. I have no family here so weekends mostly comprise of seeing his family or doing husbands chores. His family is always providing me with unsolicited advice and doesn’t help with my mental health. I feel trapped. I miss talking to people or going outside. It seems like life is normal for my husband. He goes to work, have lunch outings with colleague, outings for chores, coffee. He always manages to find excuses to go outside let it be chores, buy food on weekend too. I told him just going outside for a 5 car ride alone or going to bathroom in the morning in peace seems like luxury to me. My whole life seems like it has shifted as I have been always been a working woman. I love my daughter more than anything else. But I do miss just going outside or having a bit of me time away from home.

We do get a sitter on weekdays who watches the baby for few hours while I cook and clean the house. So I do get a little bit of break when she is here. But we are not comfortable leaving her alone with our daughter. So even with sitter, I stay home.

I discussed with my husband about going on holidays with our daughter now that it’s summer. All our friends who had baby around the same time as us go on trips and outings. But he keeps mentioning how hard it is to take baby anywhere as they only can be active for 2-3 hrs then need to be fed and changed. 

I don’t know does everyone feel the same way after having a baby? Any advice on anything that helped anyone in similar situation.

1mae550,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1mae550/the_quiet_before/,The quiet before.,"Nathan Keller had never fired a gun. He’d never thrown a punch. Hell, he’d never even been in a shouting match that didn’t end with him apologizing. Thirty-two, rail-thin, pale from years behind a screen, Nathan was a systems analyst who spent most of his waking hours troubleshooting corporate databases in a dark corner of a concrete office in Denver.

He was not, by any stretch, survival material.

But then again, the world didn’t care what you used to be.

It started slowly. A “strange flu” out of Anchorage. That’s how CNN framed it. Two dead, twelve hospitalized. By the end of the week, it had leapt the border—Ontario, Detroit, then Chicago. The bodies didn’t stay buried. And by the time the feds realized what they were dealing with, it was too late.

Denver fell in days.


---

Day 1: “Patient Zero”

Nathan had just arrived at work, coffee in hand, headphones in, when the office screens flickered to life. Emergency broadcast. Governor’s voice, stern and dry. Words like “containment breach” and “stay indoors” echoed across the hushed workspace.

Linda from HR was crying in the breakroom.

By 11 a.m., a man in the adjacent building threw himself through a third-story window and survived. Security footage showed him twitching, then standing, bones broken, jaw dislocated, staggering toward the next nearest person like some shambling nightmare.

It went viral within hours.

Some people panicked. Others didn’t believe it.

Nathan just went home, locked the door, and double-checked every window. The news ran a continuous loop of burning buildings, screaming civilians, and grim-faced experts in hazmat suits. The virus had no official name yet, but the internet dubbed it ""Revenant.""

Symptoms:

Fever

Aggression

Respiratory failure

Death

Reanimation


It wasn’t airborne—yet. Transmission came through blood, saliva, open wounds.

You had to get bit.

For now.


---

Day 3: “Collapse”

Nathan’s neighbor, Jordan, a retired marine with a gut and a six-pack, was pounding on his door.

“You alone in there?” Jordan barked, red-faced and wild-eyed. “It’s getting bad. They took out the Safeway with a goddamn drone. Military’s pulling out. We're on our own.”

Nathan opened the door just a crack. “Wait… what?”

“They hit the grocery store. Looters wouldn’t stop. Now the goddamn army’s shooting civilians. I’m heading west, up into the hills. Got a cousin in Evergreen with a cabin and a backup generator. You coming or what?”

Nathan hesitated.

“I got food. Guns. We’ll hole up till it blows over,” Jordan added, eyes twitching nervously.

That night, Nathan left behind his apartment, his life, and the high-speed fiber he used to swear he couldn’t live without.


---

Day 5: “Refuge”

The cabin was small, isolated, and halfway up a mountain road no GPS could track. There were five others already there: a family Jordan knew—Manny, a high school biology teacher; his wife, Rina, a pediatric nurse; and their two daughters, nine and six. The sixth was a stranger: Keisha, a backpacker caught in Denver when the city fell, lean and quiet with a switchblade she kept under her pillow.

It was Nathan’s first taste of the new world. They rationed food. Took turns watching the tree line. Manny taught them how to set traps, how to boil creek water. Rina stitched wounds. And Keisha taught them how to kill.

“You go for the head. Always,” she said, demonstrating with a hatchet on a fallen tree. “Doesn’t matter how dead they are. If the brain’s intact, they keep coming.”

Nathan watched, queasy, as the others took turns practicing.

When it was his turn, he could barely lift the hatchet.


---

Day 12: “Breached”

They came at night.

Three of them, half-naked, bloodied, faces shredded. One was a woman—barefoot, dragging a corpse by the hair. Her eyes glowed milky white in the moonlight. She dropped the body and lunged for the cabin door.

Keisha shot her point-blank with a bolt-action rifle.

The blast woke everyone.

By the time they got the other two down, Manny had been bitten.


---

Day 13: “Decisions”

They tied him to a tree.

Even with Rina screaming, begging them not to, even as the kids sobbed inside the cabin.

Jordan took no chances.

“He’ll turn,” he muttered, pacing. “You think this is a game? You think he’s gonna wake up and hug his girls? We all saw what happened.”

Nathan stood in the snow, shaking. He’d never seen a man beg like that. Manny sobbed, pleaded, pissed himself. Promised it wasn’t a bite. That it was a scratch. That he was fine.

Nathan wanted to believe him.

But then Manny started to cough.

And then he screamed.

And then he laughed.

Nathan turned away when Jordan pulled the trigger.


---

Day 17: “First Kill”

They were foraging near a burned-out gas station off the highway. Keisha and Nathan.

“Stay quiet,” she whispered. “Let me lead.”

The parking lot was full of charred vehicles. One of the trucks still had someone in it—jaw gone, eyes empty, gnawing at the dashboard like it still remembered what hunger was.

They found cans of beans, a bottle of painkillers, and a backpack with a bloodied stuffed bear inside.

Then they heard the crying.

It came from a truck bed.

A boy. Maybe four. Filthy, snot-streaked, clinging to the remains of what had been his mother.

She rose when they opened the tailgate.

Keisha raised her axe—but Nathan stepped forward.

“I’ll do it,” he said softly.

She hesitated. Then handed him the blade.

It took him four swings.


---

Day 21: “The Fire Within”

They buried the boy’s mother in a shallow grave behind the cabin. The boy, Milo, barely spoke. But he clung to Nathan like a lifeline.

Nathan changed after that.

He stopped shaking when he held the axe. He stopped jumping at every twig snap in the woods. He started staying up late with Jordan to plan fallback routes. He learned how to shoot.

And when Rina stopped eating, stopped talking, and finally walked into the woods alone with a kitchen knife… Nathan was the one who found her.

She was already turning.

And he didn’t hesitate.


---

Day 30: “New World Rules”

Winter had set in. Supplies were low. The generator had died, and without heat, the girls had started to cough. Keisha wanted to head south. Jordan wanted to dig in.

“We’ll freeze before spring,” she argued.

“We’ll die on the road,” he countered.

Nathan broke the tie.

“We move,” he said.

The others stared.

Jordan clenched his fists. “We’re safer here.”

Nathan looked at Milo, asleep on the couch, wrapped in three layers of sweaters.

“We’re not safe anywhere. But at least on the move, we have a chance.”

Keisha nodded. “He’s right.”

And just like that, the group followed him.


---

Day 35: “Dead Roads”

They set out with two vehicles: Jordan’s Jeep and a stolen pickup they found under a tarp. Keisha drove point. Nathan rode shotgun with Milo in the back, arms wrapped around his teddy bear.

They passed cities in ruin—Denver a ghost, Boulder in flames. The dead were everywhere. Some lay frozen in the snow like statues. Others wandered, flesh blackened, eyes dull.

They avoided highways. Took forest roads. Stole fuel where they could.

And at every stop, Nathan made the decisions. Who watched? Who scavenged? Who kept the fire?

He wasn’t the same man who once cried at layoffs.

He had learned something terrifying.

He was good at this.


---

Day 41: “Echoes of Humanity”

They found a survivor compound outside Grand Junction—thirty people behind a chain-link fence reinforced with metal scraps and car doors.

It looked promising… until night fell.

That’s when the screams started.

Slaves in the basement. Children taken. Women used.

The man in charge called himself “The Vicar.”

He offered Nathan a choice: join him, or feed the pit.

Jordan wanted to fight. Keisha wanted to run.

Nathan made another choice.

That night, while everyone slept, he poured gasoline around the perimeter and lit the match.

The Vicar burned.

The compound burned.

And they didn’t look back.


---

Day 50: “Leader”

The group was larger now.

Twelve people followed Nathan: survivors rescued, wanderers drawn to his calm, his certainty. They called him “Doc” because he used to fix things.

Now he fixed people.

But at night, when no one watched, he’d stare at the fire, wondering when the line between surviving and becoming something monstrous had blurred.

He didn’t like the answers.

But he carried on.

Because in this new world, if you weren’t willing to do the unthinkable… you didn’t deserve to live.

Yesterday in class, my teacher humiliated me in front of everyone. I tried to stay calm… but I ended up crying. Right there, in front of the whole class. But the truth is it wasn’t just that one moment. It was the build-up of weeks of silent suffering.

I’ve been working like a machine  waking up early, rushing to the department by 8 AM, returning at 5 PM. No breakfast, no lunch… just coffee and stress. I gave everything to finish one practical, because our exams are near and if it’s not done, we risk getting a supply.

But this one teacher made everything harder.

She refused to check my work. Made me wait for hours. And when I asked another teacher to sign my sheet, she scolded me in public and called me “oversmart.” She even told other teachers not to sign my file  cutting off every option I had. It wasn’t just me. Most students have broken down because of her.

I stayed respectful. I’m soft-spoken and avoid conflict. But that day, she shouted at me for no reason… and made sure I felt small.

That was my breaking point.

After class, I couldn’t go back to my hostel. I needed to escape. I took an auto and told the driver to take me to the last stop  I didn’t care where. For 3 hours, I walked through unfamiliar streets. No phone. No food. No plan. Just me and the noise in my head.

When I returned, I saw something unexpected: My friends were crying. They had searched everywhere. They were about to call the warden. When they saw me, they hugged me tightly, scolded me, and cried with me. And for the first time that day  I didn’t feel alone.

That night, I called my didi, who’s in the same profession. She was shocked: “Why didn’t you tell me earlier?” Immediately, she made calls and spoke to a teacher (her junior from her college). That teacher assured me: “No one will dare to bully you now. I’m here for you.”

I finally felt seen. Felt protected.

And then  I returned to my room and found two chocolates and a handwritten note: “._______, you’re a brave girl. Everything will be okay.” I don’t even know who left it… but I broke down again. This time  out of gratitude.

Later, I learned one of my closest friends had cried too  blaming herself for letting me walk alone. And in that moment, I realised:

✨ One person’s cruelty does not define your worth. 🌷 Even in your darkest hour, love will find its way back to you. And sometimes, the deepest healing doesn’t come from revenge… but from being held when you thought no one would catch you.
But here’s what I haven’t really said out loud:
Lately, I feel like I’m constantly giving pieces of myself away — Time. Energy. Attention. Just to keep everyone else emotionally okay.

I’m a full-time student. My exams are close. I’m genuinely trying to focus. But the moment I sit down to study — someone needs me. A friend is crying. Someone’s upset. And if I don’t respond? They get distant or hurt. Then I feel guilty.

I even created a “fixed phone call slot” just to manage everyone’s emotional needs. But it’s still too much.
And honestly? I’ve been so focused on others… I forgot to ask myself: “_____, how are you?” I never gave myself the same space I give others. I kept pushing. Forgiving. Surviving. But deep down  I’ve been tired. So, so tired.

This week, through pain, panic, and unexpected hugs… I remembered something powerful:
🦋 You don’t need to be everyone’s emotional lifeline. 🌼 You are allowed to protect your peace. 🌙 And sometimes, the real act of courage isn’t holding everyone else 
it’s finally holding yourself.
I still don’t know why she treated me the way she did. I still feel shaken. But I also feel grateful.
Grateful for the people who cried for me. Who protected me. Who reminded me that life is not just about approval. It’s about moments like these  Where even in pain, we find connection. Where even after breaking, we find something  or someone to believe in again.",1,1753592865.0,u_Melodic-Square-7074,0,1.0,False

# Best Cream Top in 2025: Reviews & How to Choose

Cream top milk, with its⁣ rich⁢ and distinctive layer of cream, offers ‍a taste experience that many find ⁤superior to homogenized milk.In⁤ 2025, despite the⁤ increasing availability of various​ milk alternatives, cream⁤ top remains a cherished option for those seeking ⁢a more traditional and naturally flavorful dairy product. This article will delve into the best ⁣cream top​ milk options available, provide guidance on how to choose the right one for‌ your needs, and explore the factors that contribute to its superior‌ taste and texture.

[[Explore Top Rated cream top on Amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-section/?kw=cream top)

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of cream ⁤top‌ milk is defined by several key features that differentiate​ it⁢ from standard⁢ homogenized milk. these factors influence the taste, texture, and overall experience of‌ consuming this traditional dairy product.

**Milk⁤ Source and⁢ Breed:** The source of the milk ⁢substantially impacts its ‍quality. Cream ‌top milk from grass-fed cows,notably breeds known for high butterfat ‍content ⁣like Jersey ​or Guernsey,tends to‍ have a ⁤richer,more‌ flavorful ‌cream layer. Understanding the farming practices ⁤and breed can help you select a milk with a superior taste profile.

**Pasteurization Method:** The method​ of pasteurization used can influence the milk's flavor ⁣and nutrient content. ⁣Low-temperature pasteurization, also known as ⁣vat​ pasteurization, heats the milk to ‍a lower temperature for a longer duration. ⁤This​ method⁣ preserves more⁢ of the natural enzymes and flavor compounds​ compared to ultra-pasteurization, which uses higher temperatures and can alter the ‌milk's taste.

**Fat Content:** The fat content of the milk directly correlates with⁤ the thickness and richness of​ the cream top layer.Whole milk, ​which​ contains⁢ around 3.5% fat, is‌ typically used to ‌produce cream top milk. The higher ⁤the‍ fat content naturally⁤ present⁢ in the milk, the more‍ pronounced and satisfying the cream top layer will be.

**Separation process (or Lack Thereof):** Cream top milk is characterized by minimal‌ processing. Unlike homogenized milk, it is ⁤not forced through ⁤small nozzles under high ‍pressure to break down the fat globules. This allows the cream⁢ to naturally separate and rise to the top,forming the distinctive cream top layer. look for milk‌ labeled ""non-homogenized"" ‍to ensure this natural ‌separation process.

**Packaging:** The packaging ​used for cream top milk can also impact its freshness⁣ and flavor. ‍Glass bottles are‍ often considered superior to ⁢plastic⁤ containers,as they are less ‌likely to impart ‍any ⁣unwanted flavors to the milk. Additionally, opaque packaging ⁢can ‍protect the milk from light, which can degrade its quality and ⁢flavor.

**Organic Certification:** Opting for organic‌ cream top milk⁤ ensures ‍that the cows are raised ‍according to strict organic farming practices. This means they⁣ are⁢ fed organic feed, have access to pasture, and are⁢ not ‍treated with hormones or antibiotics. ⁣Organic certification⁤ can provide assurance of a higher-quality and more sustainable product.

## Core Benefits

Choosing cream top milk offers several key benefits beyond its distinctive taste and texture.These advantages stem from its minimal processing‍ and‍ the quality of milk⁢ used in its production.

**Superior Flavor:** The distinct ‌flavor of cream top milk is a⁣ major draw for⁢ many consumers. As the milk is not homogenized, the fat globules remain intact, contributing to a richer, more complex flavor profile. The cream top layer, in particular, offers an​ intensely creamy ⁣and flavorful experience.

**Enhanced Texture:** The texture of cream top milk is noticeably⁢ different from homogenized milk. The‍ presence of the cream layer adds a‍ luxurious and velvety texture ‌to each sip. ⁤This unique texture enhances ⁢the overall sensory experience and makes it a more ⁤enjoyable beverage.

**Potential Nutritional Advantages:**⁢ Some studies suggest⁢ that non-homogenized milk might potentially be easier to digest for individuals ⁣with lactose sensitivities. ⁣The ​intact fat globules in cream top milk may also slow down the⁣ absorption of lactose, reducing the likelihood of‌ digestive discomfort. Furthermore, milk from grass-fed cows often contains higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid⁢ (CLA), which ⁢are associated with various health benefits.

**Versatile ‍Culinary Applications:** Cream top milk is a versatile ingredient that can be used in a‍ variety‌ of culinary applications. the rich cream top layer can be skimmed off and ⁢used as ‌a substitute​ for heavy cream in coffee, ⁢desserts,‍ or sauces. The remaining milk ⁤is excellent for drinking, baking, or​ making yogurt and cheese.

**Supports sustainable Farming Practices:** Choosing locally sourced or organic cream⁢ top milk can ⁢support sustainable farming ⁤practices. Small-scale farmers ⁤who produce cream ​top milk frequently enough prioritize‍ animal welfare, environmental stewardship, and community ‌engagement.‌ By supporting these farmers,‍ you contribute to a‍ more sustainable and ethical ⁤food system.

## FAQs Section

**What⁤ is the best​ way to store cream top milk?**
Cream top milk ⁢should be stored in the refrigerator at a temperature below 40°F (4°C). It's best to ​keep it in its original container and avoid exposing it to direct ⁣sunlight or temperature fluctuations.

**How long does cream⁤ top milk ⁣typically last?**
The shelf life of cream‌ top milk varies depending on the pasteurization method ​and storage conditions. Generally, it⁢ will‌ last for ⁤5-7 days after opening the container. Always check the ""sell-by"" ⁣or ""use-by"" date on ​the ⁤packaging and discard the​ milk if it smells sour or looks curdled.

**Why does the cream separate‌ in cream ‍top milk?**
The cream​ separates in cream‍ top milk because it is not homogenized. Homogenization is a ⁤process that breaks down the fat globules in milk, preventing⁣ them ‌from separating. In cream top milk, the fat globules remain intact and​ naturally rise to the top over time, ⁢forming ⁤the cream layer.

**Can I use the cream top for other purposes?**
Yes, the cream top⁢ is incredibly versatile. ‌You can use ‌it as a substitute for heavy​ cream in coffee, sauces, desserts,‌ or⁢ any recipe that calls for cream. it can also be⁣ whipped into whipped cream or ⁢used to make⁢ butter.

## Competitor ⁢Comparison

When selecting the best cream top milk⁤ in​ 2025, ​it’s vital to ⁣compare‍ different brands and offerings. Below is ⁣a comparison of three hypothetical competitors, ‌focusing ⁣on their key features.

### Product Comparison Overview

#### Farmer Brown's Cream Top Milk

*   **Source:** Primarily Jersey cows on ‌pasture-based⁣ farms.
*   **Pasteurization:** Vat pasteurized at 145°F for 30 minutes.
*   **Packaging:** Returnable glass​ bottles.

#### Meadowsweet Dairy Cream Top

*   **Source:** Blend of Holstein and Brown Swiss‍ cows, with some grazing.*   **Pasteurization:** High-temperature short-time (HTST) ​pasteurized at 161°F for 15 seconds.
*  ​ **Packaging:** Plastic jugs (recyclable).

#### Evergreen Farms Organic Cream Top

*   **Source:** certified Organic Holstein cows,⁢ primarily grain-fed with limited pasture access.
*   **Pasteurization:** Ultra-pasteurized (UP) at 280°F for 2 seconds.
*   **Packaging:** Cardboard ⁢cartons.

### key Differences Summary

Farmer ​Brown's stands out for its superior milk ⁤source (Jersey cows and pasture-based farming) and gentle vat pasteurization process, preserving the ⁣milk’s natural flavors. Meadowsweet Dairy offers‌ a⁢ more commercially accessible option‌ with its‍ HTST ⁤pasteurization and recyclable packaging, but the ​milk source is less consistent. Evergreen Farms, while organic, uses ultra-pasteurization which can negatively impact flavor, and their limited pasture access is‍ also a drawback for some consumers. For⁣ users ⁢prioritizing flavor and⁣ natural processing, Farmer Brown's is the likely winner.

I try to go out — visit cafes, parks, explore different parts of the city — but doing it all alone sometimes makes me wonder how nice it would be to have someone to share these experiences with. Not necessarily looking for anything specific, just meaningful connections — a walk in nature, trying out a new place to eat, conversations over coffee, or just chilling with someone who gets it.

If you're someone who also feels this way or is looking to make some real connections in this city, feel free to drop a message or comment. Maybe we can make weekends a little less lonely, together.

I want to share my practical tips that helped me save money while still enjoying everything Venice has to offer.

Getting around Venice is actually pretty simple once you understand the basics. While many tourists immediately jump for expensive private water taxis, I found the vaporetto (water bus) system to be reliable and much more budget-friendly. A single ticket costs around €7.50, but I recommend getting a multi-day pass if you're staying longer - it really pays off.

Walking is honestly the best way to explore Venice's narrow streets and hidden corners. I spent hours just wandering through different neighborhoods, discovering local bakeries and quiet squares away from the tourist crowds. Pro tip: download an offline map because the winding streets can get confusing.

For accommodation, stay in Mestre (the mainland) instead of the historic center. I paid half the price I would've paid on the islands, and it was just a 15-minute bus ride to Venice. Many budget hotels and hostels there offer clean rooms and good service.

Now, here's something I wish I knew earlier - you can experience the famous gondola rides without spending a fortune. While private gondolas can cost €80-100, I found a fantastic shared gondola tour that's much more affordable at around $40 per person. You still get the same magical experience floating through the Grand Canal and seeing landmarks like the Peggy Guggenheim Collection and Mozart House. I booked mine through [this link](https://athometouch.com/Venice) and it was super smooth - they even let you cancel for free up to 24 hours before.

For food, avoid the tourist traps near San Marco Square. I found amazing local spots in Cannaregio where you can get delicious cicchetti (Venetian tapas) for €1-2 each. Many locals stand at the bar for their coffee instead of sitting - it's cheaper and more authentic.

The best museums and churches in Venice offer combined tickets that save you money. I got the Chorus Pass for €12, which gave me access to 16 beautiful churches. Also, consider visiting during off-peak seasons (November-March) when prices drop significantly.

Free activities I loved included visiting the Rialto Market in the morning, exploring the Jewish Ghetto, and watching the sunset from Zattere promenade. These experiences gave me a genuine feel for Venice without costing anything.

One last money-saving tip: bring a refillable water bottle. Venice has many fountains with clean drinking water, and you'll save a lot by not buying bottled water at tourist prices.

Venice doesn't have to be expensive if you plan smart. Between the affordable gondola rides, local eateries, and smart transportation choices, you can experience the best of Venice without emptying your wallet.",1,1753592610.0,TripWanderers,0,1.0,False

1madvk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthRus/comments/1madvk4/neuro_gum_vs_alpha_brain_which_one_is_better/,Neuro gum vs Alpha brain -Which one is better ?,"Let’s be honest whether you’re grinding through work deadlines, prepping for exams, or just trying to shake off the afternoon brain fog, we all wish we had a “mental powerup” button. That’s where nootropics come in supplements designed to help you focus, think clearer, and stay sharp.



Two big names you’ve probably heard of are Neuro Gum and Alpha Brain. Both promise to give your brain a boost, but they go about it in very different ways. One is a gum you can pop in your mouth for an instant lift; the other is a capsule designed to gradually sharpen your cognitive game over time.



So, which one should you go for? That’s exactly what we’re going to figure out in this deep dive.

What is Neuro Gum?



Imagine getting your energy and focus fix just by chewing gum. That’s the whole idea behind Neuro Gum.



It’s a functional gum (they also have tablets) loaded with ingredients that help you stay alert and focused. The best part? You don’t need water, you don’t need to wait—it works almost immediately because the ingredients absorb right through the lining of your mouth.

Key Ingredients in Neuro Gum:



Caffeine (40mg): Your classic goto for a quick jolt of energy.



LTheanine (60mg): An amino acid that smooths out the edginess caffeine sometimes brings, giving you calm focus.



Vitamin B6 and B12: Essential vitamins that support brain function and keep your energy metabolism humming.



What is Alpha Brain?



Alpha Brain, by Onnit, is like the OG of capsulebased nootropics. It’s been around for years and is popular with athletes, entrepreneurs, and anyone who wants to upgrade their mental game.



But Alpha Brain isn’t about quick bursts of energy. Instead, it’s crafted to support memory, processing speed, and focus over time, with a formula free of caffeine or stimulants.

What’s in Alpha Brain?



LTheanine & LTyrosine: For calm yet focused mental clarity.



AlphaGPC & Huperzia Serrata: Help ramp up acetylcholine, the “learning neurotransmitter.”



Bacopa Monnieri: An herb traditionally used to enhance memory.



Phosphatidylserine & Oat Straw Extract: For brain health and oxygen flow.



Neuro Gum vs Alpha Brain: Ingredient Showdown

Ingredient	Neuro Gum	Alpha Brain

Caffeine	✔️	❌

LTheanine	✔️	✔️

B Vitamins	✔️	❌

AlphaGPC	❌	✔️

Bacopa Monnieri	❌	✔️

Huperzia Serrata	❌	✔️



Quick Summary:



Neuro Gum is all about fast energy and focus, with caffeine and Bvitamins.



Alpha Brain leans into memory and cognitive processing, without stimulants.



How They Work (And How Fast)

Neuro Gum:



Pop a piece in your mouth, chew for a minute, and you’ll start feeling more awake and focused within 5–10 minutes. That’s because it gets absorbed through your mouth lining, skipping the whole digestion process.



But here’s the thing it’s like a quick hit. You’ll feel the effects fast, but they’ll wear off in 1–2 hours.

Alpha Brain:



Alpha Brain plays the long game. You take capsules daily, and over time (about a week or two), you’ll start noticing sharper focus, better memory recall, and smoother thought processes. It’s subtle but steady.



If you’re expecting an instant jolt like a coffee hit, Alpha Brain isn’t it. But if you’re looking for something that enhances overall brain performance without caffeine, this could be your thing.

Pros & Cons Breakdown

Neuro Gum Pros:



Works almost instantly.



Super convenient just chew and go.



Smooth, clean energy (thanks to LTheanine balancing out caffeine).



No sugar, no artificial junk.



Great for people who want a quick premeeting or preworkout boost.



Neuro Gum Cons:



Effects don’t last long you’ll need to redose every few hours.



Limited in terms of memory enhancement or deep cognitive support.



Not suitable if you’re sensitive to caffeine.



Alpha Brain Pros:



Comprehensive brain support: memory, focus, processing speed.



No caffeine great for those avoiding stimulants.



Ingredients like Bacopa and Alpha GPC offer longterm brain health benefits.



Once it kicks in, it’s more consistent throughout the day.



Alpha Brain Cons:



You won’t feel anything immediately.



Capsules might not be as convenient as gum.



Higher price point.



Some people report vivid dreams (from Huperzia).



Which One Should You Choose?



Let’s break it down simply:

Go for Neuro Gum if:



You need a quick mental boost before a task.



You like caffeine but don’t want to drink more coffee.



You want something on the go that’s easy to take anytime.



You’re looking for a starter nootropic that’s simple and affordable.



Go for Alpha Brain if:



You’re seeking long term cognitive enhancement (memory, processing speed).



You’re sensitive to caffeine or prefer a stimulant free approach.



You’re willing to take supplements daily for cumulative benefits.



You want a broader mental upgrade beyond just alertness.



Side Effects: What You Need to Know

Neuro Gum:



You might get mild jitters if you’re sensitive to caffeine.



It’s easy to lose track and chew more pieces than you should, which can push you over your caffeine limit.



Some people might experience digestive discomfort if they’re sensitive to sugar alcohols (like xylitol).



Alpha Brain:



Some users report headaches during the first few days of use.



GI issues like bloating or upset stomach can happen in rare cases.



Vivid dreams—some people love it, others find it odd.



Not recommended for pregnant or nursing women without doctor approval.



Lifestyle Fit: Which Matches Your Routine?

Scenario	Neuro Gum Wins	Alpha Brain Wins

Need quick premeeting energy	✔️	❌

Want memory & learning support	❌	✔️

Caffeine sensitivity	❌	✔️

On the go portability	✔️	❌

Consistent all-day support	❌	✔️

Pricing: Bang for Your Buck?



Neuro Gum tends to be easier on the wallet, especially if you only use it occasionally. Alpha Brain, on the other hand, is more of an investment, especially if you’re taking it daily.



But remember, you’re paying for different things:



Neuro Gum = Quick energy & focus in the moment.



Alpha Brain = Ongoing brain health & cognitive upgrade over weeks.



Final Thoughts: Why Not Both?



Here’s a little secret: You don’t have to choose just one.



A lot of people actually use them together but at different times:



Neuro Gum for immediate tasks (like before a workout or an important Zoom call).



Alpha Brain daily for foundational cognitive enhancement and long term brain health.



If you’re curious about nootropics but don’t want to commit to a capsule regime right away, Neuro Gum is a great entry point. But if you’re serious about boosting memory, focus, and overall mental performance (without caffeine), Alpha Brain might be worth the investment.

TL;DR Recap



Neuro Gum = Quick, portable, caffeine based energy and focus.



Alpha Brain = Long term, stimulant free cognitive enhancement.



Both can be useful depending on your lifestyle and needs.

Rather than spiral into another 500-reply thread, I thought this would be a great opportunity to lay out the actual data as it stands today for all to see instead of just lobbing completely unbacked, biased opinions back and forth. Most here already have a sense that Nano adoption is low, but there definitely still seems to be massive disconnect between perception and reality in general in this sub, and putting the facts side by side to help visualize the differences in both scale and the actual long term trends for both networks, good or bad, may surprise some.

If this is of no interest to you, feel free to scroll on. This isn’t intended to be an attack on Nano and I’m not a Bitcoin maxi (my folio is literally 3% BTC) or paid by Coinbase (lmao), it’s just much easier to lay this out in an actual post than deep in some thread, and this sub is in desperate need of some actual facts to reference in the first place.

Let’s start by breaking down the two use cases people adopt either asset for:

1. **Storing value (SoV)**
2. **Moving value (as a settlement layer or medium of exchange)**

# Storing Value (SoV)

To function as a SoV, an assets primary job is obviously to preserve value over the long term. But what does adoption look like here? It's very simple: people or institutions holding the asset for that purpose. Gold is the most widely known SoV - and adoption for this purpose simply looks like it sitting in vaults or held via certificates and ETFs by custodians. The same logic applies to Bitcoin and Nano. If people are holding it as an asset to protect/grow wealth, that’s adoption as a SoV. Pretty simple.

# Moving Value (settlement layer or MoE)

This is more multidimensional and strangely is an area that is much more misunderstood on this sub specifically vs other corners of the Nano and crypto community at large. At its most fundamental, it’s simply the settlement layer that enables the movement of value from A to B, and that comes in many forms depending on the task at hand.

For example:

* **PayPal**: used globally for P2P and merchant payments (\~$4B/day)
* **Visa/Mastercard**: consumer spending rails (\~$40B/day)
* **CHIPS**: settles large interbank transfers (\~$1.8T/day)
* **FedWire, CLS**: global daily transaction settlement (\~$5T/day)

All of the above are layers/interfaces enabling the movement of value from A to B, in different forms for different contexts and at different scales. However in this sub there is an intense focus on one tiny sliver of this picture - day to day consumer purchases. I can understand why, as it’s the average persons immediate thought when they think of transacting because we all do it every day - but moving value isn't just ""buying coffee"" or “paying for groceries”. In fact, consumer purchases and casual P2P payments represent some of the smaller portions of global daily money movement. Transactions like B2B purchases, payroll and interbank settlement are far larger slices of the overall activity.

The strange thing is NF have always deeply understood this, while pockets of the community like this one have always held onto this far more narrow view and struggled to see the bigger picture. That’s why NF highlights broader financial uses like banking infrastructure, remittances and FX right there on the homepage as key use cases for the project.

Just think about the most serious adoption efforts for Nano to date, like Trustable and Flowhub. Neither of these efforts were about using Nano like a dollar at the shop at all - they were about using it as fast, feeless infrastructure under the hood to move value from A to B efficiently. Nano was practically invisible to the end user.

When people here talk about displacing Bitcoin or becoming a reserve currency or growing to trillions in value as an asset, it’s important to understand that you don’t just get there by playing in the “let’s compete with Visa” sandbox. The concept of money and moving value is way, way larger than that.

Now that we’ve (hopefully) clearly defined the two uses, let’s take a look at adoption.

**Starting with adoption as a tool for storing value…**

**Bitcoin**

*Individual level:*

* The **most widely held crypto asset in the world**, with latest estimates being as much as **14% of the US population** now holding Bitcoin
* Only **14.5%** of supply held on exchanges, with reserves trending lower for 5+ years
* Even with the influx of institutional buyers, **individuals** account for roughly **75% of BTC ETF ownership**

*Company/Institutional level:*

* **First crypto asset to be adopted by TradFi**, via the introduction of ETFs from the largest institutions (BlackRock, Fidelity, Van Eck, etc)
* BTC ETFs have since gone on to become the **most successful ETF launch of all time**, across all asset classes, with BlackRocks IBIT reaching **$80B AUM in just 18 months** \- reaching this scale **10x faster than Gold**
* **145 public companies** across 29 different countries now hold BTC as a treasury asset, with **32 of these companies being $1B or larger** in size
* **47 private companies** have disclosed BTC as a treasury asset
* Company treasury allocations to BTC now exceed **$136B** in total

*State level:*

* Bitcoin has been officially **adopted as a reserve asset by 3 countries**, El Salvador, Bhutan and the United States
* In addition, Bitcoin is now **held by the UAE via their sovereign wealth fund**, the 2nd largest in the world
* Coming down from the country level, both **Wisconsin** and **Michigan** have bought BTC via their state pension funds
* While I won’t count this, it’s definitely worth noting that since **MSTR** converted themselves into a Bitcoin treasury, it **has long been the vehicle for Bitcoin exposure at this level** as the regulations states/institutions must abide by catch up to allow investment in a new asset class. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that those who have utilized MSTR for exposure could move into more direct holding of BTC as this happens, and these include:
   * **Norway** (via their sovereign wealth fund, the largest individual SWF in the world)
   * **Switzerland** (via their central bank)
   * **South Korea** (via their national pension fund, 3rd largest in the world)
   * **Saudi Arabia** (via their central bank)
   * **France** (via their public investment fund)
   * **Sweden** (via their national pension fund)
   * **Liechtenstein** (via their national bank)
   * Beyond the country level, **14 US states** hold MSTR to gain Bitcoin exposure

**Nano**

*Individual level:*

* Even using an extremely generous threshold for a SoV of just **$100 worth of Nano held, only \~33,000 wallets** have such holdings. To put this in context:
   * Bitcoin has just shy of **25,000,000**
   * The Nano community subreddit has **123,000** members
* While accounts don’t tell the full story, we can further infer that it is **not widely adopted as a SoV** due to:
   * **Dwindling volumes** and no sustained bid
   * **Heavily reduced profile/mindshare** relative to 2018
   * **Very high percentage of supply held by exchanges** (36%), with no reversal in this trend

*Company/Institutional level:*

* Held by at least **one very small company** (1-2 man type scale) started by the most visible Nano community member in NanoGPT
* Anecdotal chatter of other small projects in the Nano community doing the same - but overall, **no public disclosures or meaningful capital**

*State level:*

* **None**

Clearly, in the context of a SoV, Bitcoin adoption isn’t just higher than Nano’s by multiple orders of magnitude - it’s historically unprecedented for an asset this young, in any asset class.

Nano adoption in this use case is practically non existent outside of the core Nano community itself.

***Moving onto adoption as a tool for moving value…***

This really comes down to a few key questions:

* How many people use the network to move value?
* How many people are adopting the network each day?
* How much value do they actually use the network to move?
* How often do they use the network?
* In the context of everyday consumer purchases, how many merchants accept it as payment?

Luckily, we have hard data.

Before we dive in, three very important notes:

* Nano onchain activity is practically invisible when placed up against Bitcoin, but it’s also almost impossible to interpret when viewed solely on its own due to the massive distortion from the spam attacks far exceeding normal onchain activity. For this reason I’ve also included a view of the Nano data alone in logarithmic, which is the only way you can really see the actual underlying trends.
* Bitcoin network data is filtered via two means:
   * Firstly, I’m using filtered onchain data via Glassnode to remove as much noise as possible (eg. change adjusted transaction volumes)
   * Secondly, the introduction of the ETFs in Jan ‘24 now naturally filters out a large chunk of network activity from people solely using Bitcoin as a SoV as opposed to a tool to move value, as hundreds of thousands of addresses and transactions are now replaced by a small number of ETF custodians handling everything for their clients
* Data from [Nano.Community](http://Nano.Community) only goes back to early 2019, so the data does not include the drawdown in network activity from Nano’s peak in popularity/awareness to the bear market depths

In other words, while it may not seem like it, Nano data is actually presented in quite an advantageous way - with no filtering at all and only showing trends off the absolute lows of the most dead period in onchain activity in recent history.

**How many people use the network to move value?**

https://preview.redd.it/9n29nwe8fbff1.png?width=6346&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fc58bfebf666ac3997ddbfd3596b0a23aa048d4

Nano: 7,266 daily active addresses  
Bitcoin: 738,666 (100x more)

The Bitcoin network has been in an uptrend in terms of participants throughout its history, with the only real deviation so far being the launch of the ETFs, which have replaced hundreds of thousands of would be new wallets with just a few custodians who now handle over 1M BTC on behalf of their clients. In contrast, Nano activity has remained completely stagnant, with the only real deviations stemming from prior spam attacks.

**How many new people are adopting the network each day?**

https://preview.redd.it/u8k5sz3gfbff1.png?width=6346&format=png&auto=webp&s=52e39b3c501997023bf6ce5319b76130198d74e8

Nano: 348 daily new addresses  
Bitcoin: 307,027 (882x more)

New address growth in Bitcoin has also trended higher throughout its history with the same deviation from the launch of the ETFs. In contrast, new addresses on the Nano network have trended lower. While it’s easier to see the trend on the logarithmic charts, keep in mind how large these differences on a log chart are - we’re talking about Nano averaging 1,500-3000+ new addresses per day for large portions of the two prior bear markets to mere hundreds today.





**How much value do they actually use the network to move?**

https://preview.redd.it/eiymec3mtcff1.png?width=2870&format=png&auto=webp&s=7311de7025e9f128cc24b20658ad530295cf888e

Nano: $665,053 daily transaction value  
Bitcoin: $22,500,000,000 (33,831x more)

Barely any value is actually moved via the Nano network, with daily averages regularly well under $1M while Bitcoin settles roughly $23B in transactions a day, so we can’t even see Nano on the chart.

As these numbers are now getting very large and losing meaning, let’s put this in relative terms - PayPal processes $4-5B per day. Revolut processes $2-3B. Venmo processes about $800M, with CashApp, Western Union and Wise all in a similar or slightly smaller ballpark. This isn’t a matter of “well Bitcoin looks like it moves a lot of value because Nano/other cryptos aren’t widely used yet” - even when we chop Bitcoins daily transaction volume down much further by using Glassnodes entity adjusted value (wiping out internal transactions/shuffling of wallets amongst the same entities), daily value transferred is still larger than all of these well known, major players in TradFi.

It will be some time before we see where this metric peaks out for both networks (as it is the most sensitive to the markets movements) and therefore the most recent trends are still incomplete, but Bitcoin continues to curl upward while Nano has been stagnant at best, downtrending at worst. To put it in context: since the depths of the 2018/19 bear market where the Nano data starts to today, average value moved via the Nano network each day has actually fallen. Over the same time period, average value moved each day via the Bitcoin network has increased more than 6x.

**How often do they use the network?**

https://preview.redd.it/x6ricmhpfbff1.png?width=3372&format=png&auto=webp&s=a633200e9d0e06a8803bb6528f871ccca9b2fce2

Nano: 22,165 daily transactions  
Bitcoin: 379,592 (17x more)

Unfortunately this is one Nano metric I have have no historic source for, so I’m using the latest from [Blocklattice.io](http://Blocklattice.io). However when you look at the trends across other vital metrics, it doesn’t take much of a leap to figure transactions are almost certainly stagnant/down also.

That said, even though Bitcoin does process far more transactions each day than Nano, this is one area where the properties of Nano are on display as the gap between it and Bitcoin is considerably smaller as low average transaction values are still economical due to the lack of fees - many of the microtransactions you see moving through the Nano network obviously wouldn’t be worth bothering with on the Bitcoin base layer.

However, while enabling microtransactions to be possible is obviously a good thing, this metric also massively overstates the actual economic activity going on and amplifies huge amounts of noise.

Consider this - if you just look at a 24 hour period of all transactions on the Nano network, **a whopping 86% of them are for values of** ***less than a single cent***. In an economic sense, the vast majority of Nano transactions are simply noise, stemming from services like [Nanospeed.info](http://Nanospeed.info) or addresses slowly sucking minuscule amounts of Nano from faucets.

**In the context of everyday consumer purchases, how many merchants accept it as payment?**

https://preview.redd.it/kqtqwjsilcff1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2e238d7568b917d9ca7a005c7be06f3c63f0cab

Nano: 55 merchants  
Bitcoin: 17,192 (312x more)

Despite the intense focus on that very specific every day consumer purchases use case amongst this community, Bitcoin remains far and away the more widely accepted payment option.

These numbers also only tell a small portion of the story - I’m focusing on individual listed merchants as opposed to simply listing POS services that support either asset and then automatically counting all the merchants that use these services. This is partially because it’d be a mission to source these numbers, but more importantly because it would dramatically skew these figures far more in Bitcoins favour as practically every payment processor that supports Nano also support Bitcoin, but there are also far, far larger platforms that support Bitcoin but not Nano.

Perfect example - Square, probably the most popular POS platform in the US with 2M+ merchants is currently rolling out support for seamless BTC payments and expects to be complete next year. They do not support Nano, and therefore if I included them this chart would be completely blown out of proportion. And that’s just one popular POS.

# In conclusion

No, Bitcoin does not have “no adoption”, nor are Nano and Bitcoin anywhere near the same universe when it comes to adoption in either use case, and this gap isn’t closing - it’s actually expanding at a rapid pace as their trends have been diverging across every vital metric for many years now.

Nano has been stagnant/shrinking in both use cases since 2018 and has shown no meaningful signs of a reversal of this trend at best, and is approaching ghost chain status at worst. Bitcoin on the other hand is the most rapidly adopted SoV in our lifetimes, and is also settling global transactions at total volumes that outpace many well known TradFi services with clear long term uptrends in practically every measure that matters, onchain or fundamental.

Beyond the direct comparison, some might be kinda surprised to see the actual scale of Bitcoin usage alone, and I think this information should encourage people who are stuck in a “it’s all price price price and no adoption” loop to consider that network effects matter a lot, and the fact that you can’t just implement adoption via code changes like you can faster and cheaper transactions, privacy, etc is a major part of the reason why Bitcoin still sits where it does today. If you want to change that, you can’t be complacent with adoption and pretend it isn’t happening elsewhere. You need to find ways to grow participation in the network, or the gap only further widens, and it's already looking pretty insurmountable.

Aside from an honest lack of awareness or the active decision to ignore reality because it triggers uncomfortable questions about investment decisions (and sadly, I think this is where much of the remaining community is at, mentally), the main driver of the staggering disconnect between the beliefs of some in this community and reality seems to stem from something very simple: that complete and utter disregard of all but one extremely specific (and small) sliver of one of the use cases. If you personally only care about using crypto as cash to buy your groceries that’s totally fine, but it’s important to recognize that you are actively choosing to dismiss (or completely fail to understand in the first place) the broader concept of ""money"" and the many ways value moves around the global economy where Nano could find a much more impactful foothold, and the world will simply move on in these areas without you.

And even then, Bitcoin adoption is still dominating Nano in that one particular area regardless.",16,1753591952.0,nanotrade,2,1.0,False

My dad introduced me to a few of his buddies, neighbors he drinks coffee with every morning, and they were over tonight for his birthday party.

I really connected with one of the guys. We talked about fatherhood, and he shared some fantastic advice. He’s at least 20 years older than me, with grown kids, and I was genuinely excited to have someone I could reach out to, maybe even vent to from time to time. I got his number thinking he could be a solid sounding board.

Out of curiosity, I Googled his name to see what he does for a living. That’s when I found out he’s listed as a sex offender. The offense was “Indecency with a Child by Contact” and the victim was a 13-year-old girl. The conviction was about 20 years ago.

Here’s the thing. At my parents’ house, there are a lot of kids of all ages running around. I have a couple of nieces who are young teens. With the pool, that often means kids in swimsuits and a very relaxed environment. I don’t anticipate him coming over a lot, I think this was his first time, but I’ll have no idea if he does since I don’t live here. 

So now I’m stuck. Do I tell my dad? My mom? I want to give him the benefit of the doubt, and I still feel like I could learn some things from him, but this changes things for me a bit. I’m feeling really conflicted.

As we grew up, we were inseparable, and even as we coasted through school it was always me and her no matter what other friendship groups we entered.

In the later years of college she developed a life-threatening eating disorder which almost ended her life. She was distant emotionally in those years, which was very understandable, but we remained close friends and I never treated her any differently. Later, she received an OCD diagnosis which I have learnt can often be how ED manifests.

On my 21st birthday, we were drunk, and she told me none of my other, very close, friends really liked me, she told me no one will ever know me like she does. This freaked me out, but we were both a bit out of it...

Throughout the years after college, we have grown more distant with our own things happening in life but still connect here and there to catch up, go for coffees, or go for walks. My friend in the past 2 or so years has become more noticeably invested in spending time with me. She has requested we see each other once a week, or once a fortnight. I work and study full time, and for me, this isn't realistic and not something I can commit to with *any* of my friends. She texts me almost every day, little, unimportant aspects of her day such as the weather, or a funny thing a colleague said. Usually, I do not reply. During our catch ups, I have expressed that I am not into texting, I do not want my friends to message me throughout the day, and I'd much rather be reached in person or over a phone call. She agreed and responded positively at the time but continues to bombard me with texts. I often put my phone on do not disturb because I rarely use my phone. On two occasions she has accused me of silencing her notifications (Apple phones will tell someone when their notifications are silenced).

Once my friend even acknowledged over text, she was sorry for texting so much, and when i said it was okay I just don't like texting, she immediately replied and asked my opinion on some runners.

Around 2 years ago, I noticed she unfollowed me from both of her Instagram accounts. I also noticed she unfollowed my partner, two close friends and my sister, so this was intentional and not a ""purge"" of followers. For context, she follows many other people from high school she no longer speaks to, and even remained following another sibling of mine I am not as close with. I confronted her about unfollowing **me** (I didn't want to put her on the spot about the others she unfollowed) and she said she didn't realize, and immediately dismissed me and changed the subject.

It sounds horrible but i would honestly feel better if the friendship ended. BUT I know she has mental health issues and not many other friends, so I feel like I'm abandoning a puppy who just simply wants to be my friend still!

So, I work a small convenience store. We have a hot dog machine, a chili pot, and coffee to sell. The other week, I asked my coworker if he uses soap when he washes the hot dog machine.

*Nope.* He goes ahead and washes it with soap and we're fine until another week goes by. 

I notice, he didn't do it the next week. I ask him again, remind him we need to use soap. Did he think it was...clean? 
He says *Nope, hot water is fine enough.* 

I was bouta...👹👹👹until I just went and cleaned it for him. 

He usually wipes it out with hot water and paper towels. He goes another week. And this past week I learned he does not use a sponge, so I went ahead and cleaned it **again** for him. 

He had the audacity to tell the manager, and I was just over the moon about this. How on earth am I in the wrong for correcting sanitation? Every single day I wash with soap and water. 

It had me wondering if he uses soap on his own self, if he uses soap and a sponge on the rest of the items we are supposed to wash every day. I have until one hour before closing to mop and sweep and restock, which takes until quarter to close. He has an *ENTIRE HOUR* to watch his stupid anime, play his stupid mobile games because his hygiene is so bad he can't wash items properly for customers. Every morning after he works, the coffee sucks. It tastes burnt. 

Today, I had my coffee, and it was so good. I loved it. But by the time I work again on Thursday, it's burnt again. Only on Fridays and Saturdays is the coffee tasting just dandy. 

My coworker is on the spectrum, but it would make me think he'd be obsessed more with cleanliness than I am. I have my quirks and honestly it's just about pleasing too many people. If people complain the world is ending and it's annoying when they do. So, if everything is proper, then usually they won't. Hot dogs should be clean, coffee should be clean, chili should be clean.

I’m not a lifer… I’m in and out of drill, check the boxes, and go back to the civilian side where I try to shine. I’m not doing ROTC next year but I’m finishing the semester out. I’ve built some cool things, worked with execs, networked with generals and tech leaders. I’m kind of a known name in certain circles, even if I keep a low profile in uniform. E-4s to O-5s in my field think I’m going places, but outside the Army, not in it.

Enter her.

She’s a new LTC. Sharp. Intense. Early-40s, single, no kids, with that kind of “command presence” that makes senior NCOs shut up mid-joke. But she’s also kind of… hot? In that I-read-defense-whitepapers-for-fun kind of way. First drill weekend she clocks me immediately. Like a hawk. Maybe my weird dot rank that’s not common? Maybe because we’re already connected on LinkedIn? Not in a hostile way… more like someone taking inventory of her next move.

At our post-drill social (yes, we sometimes have those), she makes a beeline for me near the coffee. Starts asking about my civilian/student work… very detailed questions. Turns out she “looked into me.” Compliments me on my “ambition beyond your rank.” I say thanks, try to keep it neutral. Then she leans in and says:

“I like soldiers who are going places. You should come by my office next drill, we could talk about some… opportunities.”

Okay. Definitely not just small talk.

Next drill, during some downtime, she finds me again. Very casually hands me a slip of paper with her personal number. Says, “If you’re ever up late thinking about the future… text me. I don’t sleep much either.” Then walks away.

Uh. Alright?

But it gets weirder.

My mom’s car broke down and I didn’t want to Uber, so I called my team leader to ask for a ride to drill. I was at my parent’s house instead of my dorm (no car on campus). I expected my TL. Instead, guess who pulls up?

Her.

She said she was “already in the area” (apparently lives near my folks). She’s in good looking civvies, in a nice SUV, wearing makeup, and even comes in to talk with my dad. She’s hot. They chat for 20 minutes. My dad, by the way, never wakes up before 10… except that day. Couldn’t make this up. She said something to him like, “He’s got a future ahead of him. Just needs the right doors opened.”

Then on the drive to drill, it’s quiet, then she drops this:

“You know… I’d like to know you better. You’re not like the others.”

I just nodded and stuttered. What the hell else do you say? Then she dropped this :

“Most people want to be led. You don’t. That’s… rare. Dangerous, too. But I like rare.”

Now, let’s be real: I’ve had mentors before. Real ones. Execs, professors, even the occasional O-7 and O-9 who took an interest in my work. But this? This has that energy. That “I can make you or break you” energy. Strategic. Maybe flirty. Definitely power-loaded. She hasn’t crossed the line… but she’s dancing on it in heels.

Let’s break this down with the precision of a stathead on a caffeine IV.

**The Pitching Matchup:**  
Dustin May (Dodgers) vs. Walker Buehler (Red Sox)? More like *Dustin May-HEM* and *Walker Buehler-BREAK*. May’s tasked with keeping L.A.’s anemic 11-16 stretch in check, while Buehler (3.27 ERA) hopes to avoid becoming Boston’s latest sacrificial lamb. The prop bets? **Buehler’s strikeout total** (Over 3.5 Ks at -165) is a safer bet than your ex’s new relationship. May’s Under 4.5 Ks (-166) is for masochists who enjoy watching pitchers chase perfection.

**The Power Rankings:**  
Shohei Ohtani (37 HRs, +240 to go over 0.5 HRs) is the game’s ultimate X-factor. He’s basically a nuclear reactor in a batting helmet—unstoppable, slightly dangerous, and guaranteed to make the odds sharpshooter.

# Decaf Coffee Basics

[Are you in search of the best decaf instant coffee?](https://gomehedi.com/best-decaf-instant-coffee/) Understanding the basics of decaf coffee can help you make an informed choice. This guide will walk you through what decaf coffee is and how it compares to regular coffee.

# What Is Decaf?

Decaf, short for decaffeinated coffee, is coffee from which most of the caffeine has been removed. This process allows coffee lovers to enjoy their favorite beverage without the stimulating effects of caffeine. Here’s a brief overview of the decaffeination process:

* **Soaking:** Green coffee beans are soaked in water to dissolve the caffeine.
* **Extraction:** The water is treated with a solvent or activated charcoal to remove the caffeine.
* **Drying:** The beans are dried to their original moisture content.

The goal is to retain the flavor and aroma of the coffee while removing at least 97% of the caffeine. The end product is perfect for those sensitive to caffeine or who enjoy a cup of coffee in the evening without disrupting their sleep.

# Decaf Vs. Regular Coffee

Comparing decaf and regular coffee involves looking at several key differences:

|Aspect|Decaf Coffee|Regular Coffee|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Caffeine Content|Less than 3% of regular coffee|Approximately 95 mg per cup|
|Flavor|Milder, sometimes slightly different|Full-bodied, robust|
|Health Impact|Less impact on sleep and anxiety|Can cause jitters and insomnia|

Decaf coffee is ideal for those who need to limit their caffeine intake. It’s also suitable for pregnant women, individuals with certain medical conditions, or those who prefer a milder taste. Regular coffee, on the other hand, is often chosen for its bold flavor and stimulating effects. Understanding these differences can help you decide which type of coffee suits your needs best.

# Instant Coffee Explained

[Looking for the best decaf instant coffee ](https://gomehedi.com/best-decaf-instant-coffee/)can be challenging, especially with the variety available. Understanding what instant coffee is and how it is made can help you make an informed choice. This guide explains instant coffee and its production process.

# What Is Instant Coffee?

Instant coffee is a type of coffee made from brewed coffee beans. It is processed into a powder or granules that dissolve quickly in water. This makes it a convenient option for coffee lovers who need a quick caffeine fix or prefer a decaf option.

Key features of instant coffee include:

* **Quick Preparation**: Simply add hot water to the granules or powder.
* **Long Shelf Life**: It can be stored for a longer period compared to regular ground coffee.
* **Convenience**: Ideal for travel, camping, or busy mornings.

Instant coffee comes in two main forms:

1. **Powdered Instant Coffee**: Finely ground coffee that dissolves quickly.
2. **Granulated Instant Coffee**: Coarser granules that are more stable and easier to handle.

Overall, instant coffee provides a quick and easy way to enjoy a cup of coffee without the need for brewing equipment.

# How Instant Coffee Is Made

The process of making instant coffee involves several steps to ensure that the final product retains its flavor and aroma. Here is a breakdown of the production process:

|Step|Description|
|:-|:-|
|1. Brewing|High-quality coffee beans are roasted and then brewed to create a strong coffee concentrate.|
|2. Extraction|The brewed coffee is then filtered to remove water and extract the coffee essence.|
|3. Concentration|The coffee essence is concentrated to increase its strength and flavor profile.|
|4. Drying|Two main drying methods are used: spray drying and freeze drying. Spray drying involves spraying the coffee concentrate into hot air, turning it into a fine powder. Freeze drying involves freezing the concentrate and then sublimating the ice into vapor, creating granules.|
|5. Packaging|The dried coffee is then packaged into jars, sachets, or tins, ready for consumer use.|

This meticulous process ensures that instant coffee retains its rich aroma and flavor, providing a quick and satisfying coffee experience.

1mad6f7,https://www.reddit.com/r/paypigs2/comments/1mad6f7/for_those_of_you_dommes_who_are_always_begging/,"For those of you ""dommes"" who are always begging for $20-$25 in these groups: Borrow it from Cashapp.","This might draw some criticism, but if you're truly in this for the money and not to play, there are far more strategic and consistent ways to achieve your goals. If you're actually desperate for a few days. Cashapp will give you the easiest $25 loan I've ever seen lol. 

If you need ACTUAL recourses to help you get financially through a week or two, let me know! I'm not sending money (don't dm with your aggressive domme persona), but I'm happy to help provide some resources to help! I know a lot about aid programs/small loans.

Lots of you have reached out to ask me ""how I did"" it. I don't really have an answer, they genuinely just find me everywhere I go lol. As someone who's been deeply involved in findom and fincucking for seven years, I can tell you that consistent, significant money-especially anything over $150 for a new domme - is hard to come by these days. It's disheartening to see so many new ""dommes"" on social media platforms resorting to begging for paltry sums like $10 or $25. It casts a shadow over the entire findom scene, making it seem desperate and cheap.

There are always ebbs and flows in this dynamic; some months are incredibly abundant with lavish tributes (rent, travel, concerts), while others bring smaller, more infrequent gifts (coffee sends, sends lower than $100, just physical presents).

Frankly, the oversaturation diminishes the genuine art of findom for those of us who truly cherish the intricate dance of power, control, and desire. True findom, at its heart, is about cunning, confidence, and cultivating genuine dynamics, not about begging for crumbs.

Recently she told me she wants to meet her ex, someone she hasn’t spoken to in five years, for “closure.”  
They originally broke up because he said he wanted to experience being with other people. She ended it because she couldn’t be with someone who wasn’t sure about her. A week later he started dating someone else and stayed with that person for five years.

I told her she could text him; he replied and suggested coffee. Something that might be important is that he is still with that same girl and for the first time after their brake up, my GF has a BF (me). My friend thinks seeking closure after five years is really about leaving the door open and her consciously or unconsciously wanting him back. Another suggestion was that she might just want to show him that he is now in a happy relationship as well so in a way brag about it?

The Blind Eye Scenes

Delilah



 The needle rolled out of Sam’s reach as she struggled with her tourniquet, her frustration rose as she felt she was being deprived of her high. The spoon rested on her coffee table waiting for the lighters affection. She scrambled for the syringe as she felt her arm begin to numb, veins began to bulge out of her arm’s. The syringe now within reach she momentarily set it down to put a flame to the spoon. The heat did it’s job instantaneously, the heroine pooled in the center of the spoon. Sam quickly put the swab in to absorb the toxic liquid then put in the syringe and pulled it all in at once. She clumsily smacked her inner elbow, all the veins jutting out of her arms like speed bumps in a road.

Sam haste-fully drove the needle into her skin careless if she hit a vein correctly, she wanted her high. That was all she cared about or needed. The drug quickly entered her bloodstream, sending Sam into a relaxed euphoric state in seconds. She felt on top of the world as she Sat drooling onto her chest. Nothing could bother her. Nothing. Not the rent that was 2 months late, not losing her job 5 months ago, not even the guy she had just sucked off to score this rush. This was her feeling of immortality.

The doorknob to Sam’s room began to jiggle till it swung open completely, Sam’s daughter Delilah stared at the woman with the ugly look sitting in front of her. “Mom?” Delilah said softly knowing there wouldn’t be a response. “I hate you”, she began to whisper repetitively as she shut her moms door, “you’ll never change”.

Sam was far beyond consciousness and was never aware her daughter was there. To Sam this couldn’t last long enough, she would wake up and do it all over again. In secret Delilah Sat crying in her room hoping her mom would never wake up.",1,1753590008.0,WritersGroup,0,1.0,False
