What am I missing?,"I own and run a small coffee shop that I inherited from my dad, it's in a busy downtown area and while we get a decent amount of foot traffic, I know we’re missing out on potential customers who search for coffee shops online. I’ve tried a few things myself, like setting up a Google My Business profile and asking customers to leave reviews, but I’m not seeing the results I hoped for.  
  
I recently read some articles on [https://rankrisemarketing.com/](https://rankrisemarketing.com/) and decided to reach out to them for help. They audited my site and pointed out a few issues I hadn’t even thought of, like optimizing for mobile (apparently something like 80% of my traffic comes from mobile devices, and my site was slow and hard to navigate). They also helped me create location-specific landing pages for nearby neighborhoods. Since making these changes, I’ve seen a considerable increase in online orders and more people mentioning they found us through Google. I am now thinking of going a bit all in with them and see what results this SEO investment can bring.  
  
As I understand it after talking to them and doing some research on my own, SEO brings in results over time, so basically I've yet to see it all. Has anyone else worked on local SEO for a brick-and-mortar business? Any obvious steps that I'm missing?",1,1742328594.0,business,0,1.0,False
1jeejw2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jeejw2,Critique my dream home floor plan? Day 2 Revisions,"Thank you all for over 100+ comments on what you thought could change. There were a lot of great ideas and people taking the time to sketch out what they saw could work better. I appreciate all of the insight, it seemed like most people liked the layout. Curious what people would want to change with this current layout.

  
From yesterday: [Critique my dream home floor plan? : r/floorplan](https://www.reddit.com/r/floorplan/comments/1jdmu39/critique_my_dream_home_floor_plan/)

Here's what changed:

* Layout for the walk in closet, laundry, and bathroom
* WIC is larger
* Laundry & bathroom is smaller
* Master bath and master bed are smaller
* People hated seeing two offices, I made them larger but they are called bedrooms now
* Pantry is smaller but probably has more space with current layout
* Pantry opens into the kitchen
* I added windows, door swings, and the 2nd floor
* There is a passthrough for laundry baskets between WIC and Laundry
* Key/mail/junk table is mo bigger 
* Coffee bar has a sink detail
* Added a door to the master bath toilet room. A window in there would line up well with the plan but it would be right next to the toilet and idk how I feel about that. I would love to look out while there but not everyone would lol
* Probably more?

Here's things that didn't change:

* Bedroom 2 is far from a bathroom, this room isnt used all day long and thats fine. Trying to keep plumbing centralized
* I like the WIC coming off of the bathroom, that was a heated topic.
* Tried making the house smaller, it ended up getting a little bigger. Still below the 3500 max I am setting. The first floor is around 2300 and 2nd floor is around 1100

Some FAQ:

* It will have a basement for entertainment stuff, mechanicals, storage.
* The guest suite is on the 2nd floor, I didnt expect people to walk through my house naked
* It will be ICF construction, the interior walls right now dont reflect bearing walls that will be needed inside or thicker walls for plumbing
* I use AutoCAD LT for the layouts, its a lot of work compared to newer programs
* ICF houses are very air tight, the whole house will have mechanical vent/fresh air systems that will help the bathroom and WIC stay dry",1,1742328574.0,floorplan,0,1.0,False

I’ve always wanted a chair like this so it’s not really about that, but just out of curiosity because I can’t seem to find the exact chair fabric color anywhere even if I wanted to buy another one somewhere. 
It’s like a coffee brown color.

1jee8tt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jee8tt/the_lancer_01/,The Lancer 01,"As soon as they fastened the hood over his head, visions of Nekka crept inside the darkness. He saw her smile again. The small creases near her left eye when she smirked at him. Her smooth hands that could wield a gun like it was a part of her.

Then the other memories, the ones he tried to forget, crept up from the void: Nekka’s pain-filled moans echoing down the corridor into his cell; the blood crusted onto her cheeks, spilled from the empty sockets where her brown eyes used to be.

He began to tremble. The driver made no effort to make the journey comfortable as the wheeler sped down twisting, rocky roads. Mal was grateful the turbulent ride hid his shakes.

He guessed he was being taken into the old Aquifer Tract deep on the fringes of Baho District. After fifteen minutes the wheeler came to an abrupt stop. Mal was yanked out, led down stairs, then a corridor, and finally forced onto a hard chair.

He reached for his hood.

“Don’t,” said one of his handlers, trying and failing to sound intimidating.

“I’m done smelling my own breath,” Mal said, yanking off the black sack. His eyes quickly adjusted to the darkness in the small room. The two handlers were young and scared, each carrying AZ 12 pistols tucked in their belts. Mal chuckled under his breath. They looked like Baggy and Baba, two characters from a sigcast he watched as a child.

Corroded pipes and valves snaked across the walls and low ceiling. He could hear water dripping in the corner, then two sets of footsteps approaching. A door slid open and a switch was flicked. Mal clamped his eyes shut as the room flooded with cold fluorescent light.

When he opened them again, familiar faces slowly came into focus. Mal recognized Till Farragut from CCDF wanted posters and grainy videos pulled from the darksigs. Given the security measures, Mal wasn’t surprised he’d been summoned by the de facto leader of the Zeta Dawn insurgents. He was not expecting to see the charred face of Stagger Remu standing beside Farragut. Rage quickly replaced surprise, then instantly gave way to the overwhelming desire to lunge at Remu and carve new wounds into his face.

Remu stared down at Mal, fingers thrumming the battered Vyper TR-23 assault rifle slung over his shoulder. He clearly enjoyed towering over his former rival.

“Even craggier than I remember,” said Remu. His voice still sounded like he’d swallowed sandpaper and washed it down with splinters.

“Remu.”

Remu glared at Baggy and Baba. “You let him take his hood off.”

“I – we told him – we told him not to – “

Remu raised the Vyper and fired before Baggy could stutter more words out. The bullet pierced his arm, ripping through flesh and spraying blood. The young man toppled backwards into the corner. Baba stood frozen, eyes bulging in fear.

“Ruined the surprise,” Remu explained to Mal. He lowered the rifle and Mal thought he grinned. It was always hard to tell with Remu.

“Heard you were still a lancer,” said Remu. “But looks to me like you lost your vig.”

“You look exactly the same,” said Mal.

He heard Baba suck in air. It was common knowledge among insurgents that commenting on Remu’s buckled features reminded him of the night his face was disfigured by the CCDF troopers who burned down his childhood home. An offense that unfailingly led to violence.

Remu’s eyes flashed with anger. His hand pressed the Vyper’s grip hard. Farragut shifted on his feet. A subtle gesture, but Remu understood and instantly shook off his rage.

“Figure you could use work,” he said to Mal.

“Depends on the work.”

Remu snorted and turned to Farragut. Farragut continued to fix his gaze on Mal through thick amber-tinted goggles. His only response was an almost imperceptible nod of his head. Message received, Remu sighed and turned back to Mal.

“It’s a transport gig,” said Remu. “Even you should be able to handle it. At 06:00 tomorrow you’ll pick up the passenger outside Ver’s Bazaar. Destination is Asylum Camp 735 in Exill in four days. At 08:00 on the fourth day we’ll drop you info to complete delivery. You’ll have thirty minutes. If you arrive any later than the assigned time, the deal is null.”

Mal nodded. Sounded easy enough. Too easy.

“Who’s the passenger?” he asked.

“The name’s Sammar. That’s all you need to know,” said Remu. He looked back at Farragut again, watching for another slight nod. He then handed Mal a BitPad.

“Two thousand bits now, eight thousand more upon delivery,” said Remu.

Mal checked the BitPad’s display. He hadn’t seen this much currency in a very long time. The passenger must be a person of significance, but the money was good enough to keep Mal from pressing for more details.

He pocketed the BitPad and stood, locking eyes with Remu for a long second before shifting his gaze to Farragut.

“Didn’t know Zeta was in the biz of collecting X-10 discards,” Mal said to Farragut. The Zeta leader’s face remained glacial but Remu snorted, giving Mal a small dose of satisfaction.

“I warned him about your botch job in Lasco,” said Remu. Mal flinched at the name of the district where he lost it all. “Still he wanted you for this gig. The glory your father earned carries you even now.”

Again Mal fought the urge to launch himself at Remu. He wasn’t as fast as used to be, but he was certain in this confined space he could at least snap Remu’s neck before Baba filled him with bullets. Instead he turned away.

Mal stepped over Baggy, still gasping on the floor and gripping his wounded arm. He nodded at Baba before placing the hood over his own head.

“Time we skut,” said Mal. “Unless you’d rather catch a bullet, too.”

///

His dreadlocks and shaggy beard were grayer than he remembered. The bags under his eyes deeper, his expression more dour. It had been over a year since Mal had regarded himself in a mirror, and he wasn’t pleased with the man staring back at him. These days he only left his unit to go to the local waterhouse or mech shop when he needed parts for his wheeler, but now he needed to consider his appearance.

He knew the three-district drive from Baho to Exill would be a tight run to make in four days. Best he look as presentable as possible in case they come across CCDF checkpoints or militia patrols. Mal had used a portion of his payment to buy a jacket, pants and three shirts to replace the grimy clothes he had worn for too long. The trader threw in a hand mirror, which Mal realized was a small act of kindness once he saw the state of his countenance.

Mal checked the time; two hours until pick-up. He found an old razor and a can of aloe in the clutter under the sink and began to shave.

He’d stayed awake all night. Most nights he woke multiple times when his dreams took him back to Lasco, but last night it had been impossible to even shut his eyes after seeing Remu. Mal lay awake replaying the day his cadre of X-10 Rebels was captured by local militia and turned over to the Consortium Civil Defense Force. It was the last time he saw Nekka alive.

Lasco District was one of the poorest, most remote sectors outside Avalon Protectorate. When X-10 leadership approved Mal’s request to situate an insurgent cell inside the district, he clashed with Remu constantly. As Mal’s liaison to X-10 leadership, Remu was a perpetual obstacle in securing logistical support for the cause. Mal was convinced Lasco was ready to rise up against the CCDF. But they would never find out; after three months of organizing with minimal resources, an informant gave up the location of their command post. The moment Mal’s cadre was captured, Remu disappeared from the district, leaving them to fend for themselves.

The sound of doors buckling, voices raised in shock echoed from down the alley outside. Mal swore as the razor nicked his chin. He looked out his small oval window to see militia members wearing green armbands and carrying old UXP submachine guns. They were dragging four young men and a woman from a ground-floor squat onto the street.

The militia had been on a tear in Baho the past few weeks. Something about the Consortium Authority discovering uncertified tunnels near the district core.

Skids living in the outer districts faced two paths; join the insurgent factions fighting for liberation against the Consortium, or join a local militia and work with the Consortium to maintain order.

Mal grunted and shut the window slats. He didn’t know the victims and didn’t care. Had to be thick as concrete to get caught by militia shitlickers. He wiped the blood trickling down his chin with a rag. Told himself not to think of Nekka’s empty eye sockets today.

///

Mal navigated his wheeler through the narrow, bustling roads of the Crafter’s Tract toward Ver’s Salvage. He was thankful the roads weren’t overly crowded with traders, scrappers or wanderers this early in the morning. His wheeler was twenty-years old, an AgriCorp fleet vehicle on the market for parts when Mal bought it. It was wider than most other wheelers but boasted a 7MT tow capacity and 1500-kil charge despite its age.

A massive digital billboard, fifteen meters wide, hovered in the sky above. Images of pop music avatars, discount nitric food bars and bit-loan lenders flashed across the screen under an overlay of the familiar Wells-Tybonne logo. The largest corporation in the Consortium, Wells-Tybonne commodities permeated all aspects of life, even in the outer districts.

Mal pulled to a stop outside Ver’s Bazaar and groaned. Ver’s was a gathering place for the locals; a spot to buy and trade wares, swap stories and spread gossip. Even at this early hour there were too many people for Mal’s liking.

He stepped out of the wheeler and waved away an old woman who approached selling coffee out of a rickety, three-wheeled delivery evod.

“You've got a slog ahead,” said the old woman. “Gonna need caffeine.”

Mal glared. How did she know he was in for a long trip? “Are you Sammar?”

“No,” the old woman laughed as she sidestepped, revealing a young boy lingering behind her. The child looked at Mal and tried to slide back behind the woman.

Mal checked the time: 06:00 on the dot, he didn’t have time to waste. “Where’s Sammar?” he asked, annoyed.

The old woman tousled the boy’s hair, brown teeth filling her grin. The child with wide black eyes and shaggy dark hair stared up at Mal with a mix of distrust and curiosity.

“This be Sammar,” she said, nudging the boy toward Mal. “Ready to ride.”

The boy couldn’t have been older than seven or eight years old. The old coffeewallah was clearly talking nonsense. Why would Zeta pay him so much to transport a child? She handed Mal a cardboard cup of steaming coffee as reality slowly dawned; he would be spending the next four days as not only a driver, but a babysitter.

The answer is **yes, but with some caveats**. Here’s how coffee can potentially help with weight loss and what you need to keep in mind:

# 1. Boosts Metabolism

* **How It Helps:** Coffee contains caffeine, a natural stimulant that can increase your metabolic rate. A higher metabolism means your body burns more calories, even at rest.
* **Scientific Backing:** Studies have shown that caffeine can boost metabolism by 3–11%, depending on the individual and the amount consumed.
* **Tip:** For best results, drink black coffee without added sugar or cream, as these can add unnecessary calories.

# 2. Suppresses Appetite

* **How It Helps:** Caffeine can act as a mild appetite suppressant, helping you feel full for longer and reducing the urge to snack between meals.
* **Scientific Backing:** Some research suggests that caffeine affects hunger hormones like ghrelin, which can temporarily reduce appetite.
* **Tip:** Drink a cup of coffee 30 minutes before meals to help control portion sizes.

# 3. Enhances Physical Performance

* **How It Helps:** Caffeine stimulates the nervous system, increasing adrenaline levels. This can improve physical performance during workouts, helping you burn more calories.
* **Scientific Backing:** Studies have found that caffeine can improve exercise performance by 11–12%, making it a popular pre-workout drink.
* **Tip:** Have a cup of coffee about 30 minutes before your workout for an energy boost.

# 4. Contains Antioxidants

* **How It Helps:** Coffee is rich in antioxidants, which can help reduce inflammation and support overall health. A healthy body is better equipped to lose weight effectively.
* **Scientific Backing:** Antioxidants like chlorogenic acid in coffee may help regulate blood sugar levels and reduce fat absorption.
* **Tip:** Opt for high-quality, freshly brewed coffee to maximize antioxidant benefits.

# 5. Promotes Fat Burning

* **How It Helps:** Caffeine stimulates the breakdown of fat cells, releasing fatty acids into the bloodstream where they can be used as energy.
* **Scientific Backing:** Research shows that caffeine can increase fat burning by up to 10% in obese individuals and 29% in lean individuals.
* **Tip:** Combine coffee with a healthy diet and regular exercise for the best fat-burning results.

# Caveats to Keep in Mind:

* **Moderation is Key:** Too much caffeine can lead to side effects like jitters, insomnia, or increased heart rate. Stick to 2–3 cups per day.
* **Avoid High-Calorie Additives:** Adding sugar, cream, or flavored syrups can turn your coffee into a calorie bomb, counteracting its weight-loss benefits.
* **Not a Magic Solution:** Coffee can support weight loss, but it’s not a substitute for a balanced diet and regular exercise.

# Conclusion:

Coffee can be a helpful tool in your weight-loss journey when consumed in moderation and as part of a healthy lifestyle. Its metabolism-boosting, appetite-suppressing, and fat-burning properties make it a great addition to your routine.

I had waited all week for her to come home; she never did. Failing that, I looked for her. Cast aside was my terror, my guilt and my shame. What was left in its place was a shaky, self-deceptive sense of optimism. Before you lambast me for not looking hard enough, it’s difficult to find something that, by all accounts, never existed.

I’ll say before you go any further, and only if you haven’t already, please read [my first posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1j62uu2/there_was_something_in_the_woods_with_us_that/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Be warned however that they won’t answer much, I doubt anything can or will.

You know, I still wake some nights and hope to see her in the usual spot at the foot of my bed; that hope is starting to wane. Following my fruitless search, I called my parents to explain to them the situation and according to them we’ve never had a dog. What am I to think? That I’m making this all up?

A few days following this I came to the conclusion that locking myself in my house, leaving all texts, calls and emails on read and browsing dingy internet forums in search of similar experiences simply wouldn’t help. For the first time in what felt like forever, I crept from my room and tried to uphold the basic façade of normalcy. The resonant hum of the kettle filled the house, I had decided making a tea was the best course of action.

Idly I flicked through my mail which had accumulated in a haphazard pile by the front door. It had been all the usual stuff, the odd letter, a magazine and a few cards but what had really caught my eye was a poster. Bold red font at the top had declared ‘MISSING’ and at the bottom was a paragraph vaguely describing a dog. It had been the picture though, that was what really got me. Captured in blurry monochrome was Lyric.

It had made good kindling.

Let me ask you something. Have you ever felt hungry and opened your fridge only to be disappointed as to the contents? Have you ever, following that, slammed the door shut in frustration before pulling it open once again in hope of a new result? Have you ever, after all of that, ever seen the inside of your fridge… change? No. I guarantee you haven’t.

Events, such as those affecting my fridge were becoming more and more common; alarmingly so. The onset had been so minor I feel embarrassed even mentioning it. First, it had been my mysteriously unlocked phone shifting an inch or two as I slept. Then, it had been doors, previously shut, standing wide open when I woke. On a few occasions my car keys, usually thrown into a dish in the kitchen, appeared under my pillow. Now on their own, these incidents may seem harmless; mildly infuriating at most. But within context they’re undeniably… sinister.

By the time I managed to convince myself to leave my home it had been nearly two weeks since Lyric disappeared. Now it was time and for good reason. Two weeks alone is a long time to mull things over. Your mind wanders in that kind of silence and solitude. I had felt strange pangs of nostalgia. Thoughts of that night in the woods all those years ago, and of Josh and Richard, filled my every waking moment. I had missed them I suppose. So, from the deepest recesses of my memory and my old computer, I dug up two emails. To each of them I sent a single message.

Only Josh responded.

What follows is the email I sent him:

***(ME)***

***Hi Josh!***

***I know this is slightly out of the blue but… just how have you been? To be honest I’m sorry I never reached out sooner. I suppose I apologise for my laziness!***

***What have you been up to? I know you mentioned something about getting into your desired college last we spoke so, how’d that turn out?***

***Personally, I got through college and have been doing a Uni course for the last few months, I’m currently renting this shit little farmhouse nearby; it’s not quite Richard’s countryside getaway lol!***

***Anyway, we should really meet up some time, even just to talk. Coffee shop meetup in the old spot? Drop me an email if you fancy it!***

***I’ve really missed you Josh, take care of yourself and I hope to hear from you soon.***

I had barely leaned back in my chair when the computer pinged to signify incoming mail. The response was tantalisingly brief.

***(JOSH)***

***We should meet up; in person I mean. Are you free this coming Tuesday?***

I thought it over for a few minutes and replied to him. We set a time to meet.

During the days that followed, the strange abnormalities in my home worsened in both frequency and scope. Rooms had begun to re-arrange their layouts; after the first few times I gave up putting the furniture back. Screams, shouts, cries, grunts, groans, hums and whistles, seemingly from no source, filled the house more often than not. Then there was the constant clutter. Drawers and cupboards turned inside out; their contents laid bare across the floors in neat, ordered rows. It was the sublimity and perfection of it all that bothered me the most.

The vibrant chirping of the dawn chorus on Tuesday signalled a second full night without sleep. Strangely, in that time, not a thing had stirred within the house. Wearily I pulled myself from the sofa and lurched towards the bathroom in an attempt to tidy myself. I staggered through the door and looked into the mirror; my reflection was alien to me. It was twisted. Skin sagged under my eyes in grotesque purple bags, my face was pinched and gaunt, slick with grease was my hair after days of being unwashed and my eyes… they were so hollow. It took me nearly half an hour to come to terms with the fact that the emaciated husk in the mirror was me.

I showered and threw on some fairly clean clothes. My reflection looked marginally better, enough so I could pass myself off as just REALLY stressed over exams. Not that I’d been to Uni in two weeks, feigning a family emergency to keep the professors off my back.

It was nearly midday by the time I had found my keys (tucked in an old shoe-box under the bed by my mysterious, room arranging ‘guest’). I was exceptionally late. I peeled down the drive in my beat-up Fiesta and nigh on ran every red light on my way into town.

Town was busy and parking sparse. I eventually found a spot leaving me with a ten minute walk to the coffee shop. After a few minutes of walking, I became filled with impending dread, a feeling that I should turn back. Fight or flight? People drifted past me, fading into a constant stream of colour and noise. Thought after thought tore through my mind as I weighed every possible consequence of what I was about to do. The world became hazy. The constant blaring of a car horn ripped me from my waking slumber and I realised I was stood, frozen, in the middle of the road. My heart fought the confines of my chest, pounding in my ears, feeling as though it would spill from my throat. I struggled against the impulse to retch, to gag, to vomit. My vision blurred and spun as the headlights of the oncoming car distorted into blinding strobe lights, its incessant horn blocking out all sanity. I’d winced at the sudden cacophony and my vision had ceased all together. My legs buckled. I drifted into nothing. My head hit the concrete.

I think it was the breeze that woke me. It gently pushed the hair from my throbbing brow behind my ears and caressed my flushed skin. My mind was rendered silent and hushed. My heart was calm and the furious pounding that had, moments earlier, assaulted my ears was replaced by a dull thrum. I was discarded on a bench, in a park, some distance from the road. Gazing upwards, I sat for a minute or two before I stirred. It was the usual dirty English sky; steel grey and cloud-mottled.

I finally reached the coffee shop a few minutes later. In the near decade since I’d last been there it hadn’t changed at all. I was late. I hoped Josh hadn’t left.

He hadn’t.

Much like the dull fluorescent lights and suspiciously sticky seats of the chosen establishment, Josh hadn’t changed a bit. He was older, taller and all that but it was still irrevocably him. He sipped at the steaming cup in his hands; wincing slightly at the hot liquid.

Then he saw me.

“HOLY SHIT!”

His voice trailed off for a few second as he assessed me, head to toe, his eyes lingering on the swelling above my eye.

“How the hell are you? My god you haven’t changed a bit!”

I chuckled softly at his remark before taking the seat opposite him. Settling into the chair I slipped of my jacket, throwing it in a heap on the floor beneath me.

“I could say the same thing about you! I guess I’m fine all things considered; you?”

Looking up at him I was met with a toothy grin, he took another sip of his coffee and sighed one of his usual exaggerated sighs; he was exactly like I’d remembered.

“I, my good friend, am doing wonderful! What are the chances hey? That we end up here again, together! We’re only missing Richard!”

Following his comment he whistled over the nearest waitress, a young woman in her early twenties. Her face had scrunched up into a scowl at his brash nature before she spat out a generic request for his order. My face had been similarly scrunched up in embarrassment. This side of him was entirely new. I had tried to communicate an apology through eye contact as she took my order but I don’t think she noticed.

Josh and I chatted for a little while, getting all sentimental and what not. It had felt good just to talk. As our drinks arrived, he had started on the subject of life after college.

“Yeah so, following failing all of my courses I got a small job in town. It pays pretty well but it’s no career. Still working on that, hah.”

Josh had reclined into his chair and gazed out of the misty glass to the street. He’d looked kind of dejected for a moment and I decided to interject to keep spirits high.

“Richard though? You hear from him after high-school? Cause I certainly didn’t, completely ignored any attempt from me to keep contact”

My words hung in the fresh silence for a moment or two before Josh responded.

“Yeah… he did the same to me! You reckon he still lives with his parents? At the farmhouse I mean.”

That had been a good point indeed. I’d never actually attempted to visit him.

“Okay… okay. You reckon we should pay him a visit? I sent the both of you an email and well, it was only you who responded. Which means he either ignored me or well… that isn’t his email anymore!”

I took a sip of coffee. It was far too hot to drink and I spat and sputtered the mouthful down my coat; much to Josh’s amusement. He’d taken a sip of his own coffee before responding.

“Do you know what? I think we should! It’s about time we all had a reunion, been far too long!”

Nodding at his words I placed my mug back on the table and gingerly prodded at my teeth with my burnt tongue. Finally, I spoke.

“If we can’t reunite as a three, we’ll have to make do between the two of us! You know I mentioned I’m renting? Would you be… interested in coming over sometime?”

He nodded curtly and summoned the young waitress over again, motioning that he needed a pen. We’d each scribbled our details on a napkin before he returned the pen, wrapping it in another napkin as he did so. Slipping my address and phone number across the table to him I asked.

“Why didn’t we just use our phones?”

Chuckling and gesturing to the waitress he responded.

“Well… I Wanted to give her my number!”

I rolled my eyes and we continued chatting for a few minutes more. As he reached the dregs of his coffee, Josh spat what was left back into the mug. Grimacing and wiping the grounds from his lips, he set the cup on the tray, taking one last look at the white porcelain. Abruptly he froze, gaze meeting mine, eyes almost bulging from their sockets, the suddenly pallid skin of his face taut. He stood up, yanked his coat from its place on the back of the chair and left.

I sat there stunned, confused. The bell above the door chimed vigorously as it slammed behind him. The drama of Josh’s exit had caused everybody in the café to turn and face me; expressions pointed in accusation. I continued to slump in my chair, deathly silent. My fingers gripped the edge of the table, knuckles white from exertion. I wrestled back control, grabbed my coat from the floor and stood to leave. As I did so, my eyes fell on Josh’s empty coffee mug. Beneath the slop of Josh’s dregs and scratched into the bottom… were two tallies.

Wallet pulled from my pocket; I thrust a few crumpled ten-pound notes into the startled waitress’ hands and stormed out. Down the street I ran; I made it back to the car in just under three minutes. Throwing my coat and myself inside I, with shaking hands, tried and failed to get the key into the ignition; the drive home was silent.

As I pulled up the long, interminable drive to my home, I paused for a moment and audibly asked myself.

“Am I really about to do this?”

I don’t know why but I genuinely thought meeting with Josh would fix things? That he would declare he had experienced what I had and would give me the magic cure! Instead, it would seem I was only partially correct.

I met sleep the instant my head hit the pillow that night. When I eventually woke to the gentle vibrating of my phone upon the nightstand, I’d laid there for an indeterminable amount of time. In lucid flashes, the previous day’s events returned to me as I remained immobile and meticulously tucked into bed. Exhaling, I threw off the covers and answered whomever was calling.

“Hello? Who is this?”

There was brief silence before a muffled voice responded.

“Hiya… This is Rachel”

Her name rang absolutely no bells for me and I told her so. Pausing again for a brief moment, she continued.

“I’m Josh’s mother? Don’t you remember me? Anyway… I hate to bother you this late but Josh never came home tonight? He said he’d gone to meet you…”

Coughing nervously, I tried to articulate a response.

“Yeah! We met at that little coffee shop in town? Now that I think of it, he… did leave in a bit of a hurry. I tried calling him but… he never answered”

There was no sense in lying to her.

“Oh… Okay then. Well, if you don’t know anything else I’ll have to keep asking around. Thank you for your time”

The call went dead.

My mind raced as I pondered where he was. Had he done something stupid? Had he gotten into an accident? Was he hurt… dead?

I dragged myself down the frigid stairs; the house was deathly cold. Grimacing as the hardwood pinched at my bare feet I stumbled into the kitchen, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. Soon acclimating to the darkness, I ran myself a water to soothe the pounding in my head. I’d taken a few sips and held the cool glass to my bruised brow before letting out a sigh; then something sighed back.

He stared at me through the agape window.

“Josh? What the fuck are you doing?”

Liquid, amidst shattered glass, began to pool around my feet; he did not react. Edging my way towards the door I shouted again.

“Hey man… This isn’t funny…”

Desperately fumbling with the light-switch I caught his gaze; its gaze. That thing wasn’t Josh… it simply couldn’t have been. Eyes, or lack thereof, bore into me; no more than bottomless pits chiselled into its emaciated visage. 

“G-get the… the fuck off my property!”

My quivering voice betrayed any semblance of confidence and it knew it. Head far too heavy upon its neck, it twitched and jerked to keep ‘eye contact’ with me. I should have run, screamed, thrown something, died on the spot and yet I stood there like an idiot, utterly transfixed. The more I gazed upon its shifting form the more and more I saw. Pushing through its skin, writhing against its mortal confines, spilling through the seams. From the bunched and bloody mess outstretched a single wiry appendage. It had too many fingers, too many elbows, too much of everything. Shifting and readjusting and with infinitely tender care it pushed the window shut.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

They came against the glass in soft raps; it was an all too familiar sound. Through the window I heard it, cracking and popping, muscles tearing and reforming. Its breath was hot against the window, fogging up the pane. Then it spoke. It had been a poor attempt at a human voice, monotone, static, utterly devoid of life.

“You have to let me in… You have to let me in… You have to let me in…”

Broken glass crunched underfoot as I forced myself to MOVE, shambling against the doorframe in the process. Behind me, angular fingers pressed into the condensation, as if reaching out in pursuit. Into the pane they etched… a single tally.

“Help… Help… You have to help me…”

Thundering up the stairs I ignored its now incessant cries.

“Why are you leaving me? Why are you leaving me? Help…”

Limping into the bathroom, swearing amidst trying to pull shards of glass from my feet, I collapsed against the wall. Writhing and gasping for air on the floor I fought to regain control, to focus my eyes and to soothe my head; just to breathe.

“It’s me… Josh… Josh… Josh… You have to let me in…”

Clasping both hands over my mouth, muffling my whimpering, I strained to hear it.

“Where are you? Where are you… Where are you!”

Now pounding against the kitchen window, its words rendered no more than a series of low guttural strains and screams. Crying out in response and pulling myself to my feet I threw open the bathroom door and with what strength I had left, screamed:

“I’ll kill you!”

That was all I could think to say.

Like a blown-out speaker it spluttered and silenced. I could hear its hand scrape down the window as it pulled away, like nails on a chalk-board. Slumped against the doorframe, I let out quiet revelries. It was gone, for a few moments at the least. The silence was euphoric and I couldn’t help but cry. Hot tears stung in the corners of my eyes; I hadn’t bothered to wipe them because there came a knocking on the bathroom window.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

It spoke softly, like a mother consoling a child. Three little words… in my voice.

“I’ll kill you…”

One. Two. Three. Four… I counted each second as it passed, each an eternity of its own. Idly I sat, crumpled in a twisted heap upon the wooden floor, scratching. For hours I’d scratched. I’d scratched till my nails were gone and my fingertips were raw; Deep and deeper still into the wood. Anything to fill the silence. Anything to escape from… it. Etched over and over again, deeper and deeper into the floor, was a single… tally.

Today the sun rose over the horizon, its feeble efforts to dispel my unease are… appreciated. I’m on my back, entombed in grass. Cloudless blue skies stretch far above me, it’s a pleasant change to the dreary, grey expanses of the last few days. Trees rock in the breeze, calmly and gently; everything is right with the world. All this time has given me a great chance to ponder things. The tallies for example. Swaying softly in the wind is that tree, a single tally etched into its bark. First it was three. Then it was two. Now it’s one.

I know why Richard never answered my emails and why Josh won’t respond to my calls. They’re both dead and soon… I will be too.",3,1742327267.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

It goes, ‘Knock knock. Who’s there? The Noddywonk. Noddywonk who? I’ve found you’. Doesn’t make sense does it. A guy in the break room said something recently that reminded me of it. It sparked a memory I hadn’t thought of in all the years since.



I had missed the school bus so I took the public bus that came after. The giant bus driver took one look at my uniform and snorted through his nose. He punched the appropriate keys on his ticket machine and looked out onto the road. I watched as the ticket finished printing and waited for him to take it and give it to me like Larry the old man who drove the school bus would, except when he noticed I hadn’t taken the ticket he lurched his arm on the rest as a way of saying ‘can’t you see it’s done mate’. The machine was closer to him but I took the ticket and found the empty window seat closest to the door. It was raining then, and the sky was a flat sunless white like a plaster ceiling. After a moment a man stepped on board. I remember how the rain dripped off the hem of his coat onto his shoes. He wore a matching grey hat like a costume version of a 50’s fedora. He took his ticket and looked around with small black eyes glaring under the brim of his plastic hat. To be honest my attention was quickly arrested by a particularly big chested women who got on after him. 



It’s like a core memory. I think it was the first time I actually noticed a woman like that. Something in my brain switched on to the whole idea. Rain dripped off the tip of her nose and slipped down her cleavage; milky, firm skin with goosebumps in the cold. She poised her purse by the v of her crotch and fingered about for change to the delight of the driver who’s waxy face blushed red as a beetroot. She looked up and smiled at him through fogged up glasses, which was disarming in a way, I felt like I could look at her a little longer without getting caught. Everyone jumped when she clanked the coins into his tray, £2.50. The driver looked defeated and clumsily fumbling about the keys on his number pad. The ticket jerked out inch by excruciating inch like a sorry penis trying for an erection before falling out and curling limp in her hand. The bus driver tried for a smile and she scrunched up his ticket and threw it down the bin behind him. This was it, the bus was pretty full, maybe she’ll sit next to me, please sit next to me. She brushed past the grey man who still hadn’t found his seat. This was it she was coming up to me now. Then she walked straight by me. I got a spritz of her zesty perfume and a glance at her round bum but that was it. She was probably slathered in the old spice shower gel of the bloke she’d drunkly hopped into a taxi with after the previous night out and was now taking the bus of shame home in the same undies and cocktail dress from the day before. But to a fourteen year old boy she was an angel from heaven. I’d never known the beauty of women before her, and I’ll never forget it. 



I’ll also never forget how my blissful reverie was soured when that man slopped into the seat next to me. That’s what I get for gawking at women I suppose. Damp musty faecal musk plumed about him. I remember pressing my nose to the cold window and cupping my hand over my mouth for what seemed like an hour before the bus driver even turned the engine back on. When the bus did start again I felt it right under me, my seat was vibrating, made me queasy. I couldn’t keep my elbow perched on the slippery rim of the window that was designed to stop passengers leaning their elbows on windows. I reluctantly faced forward and was planning on keeping my head down the rest of the journey when that man he started mumbling. I tried to ignore it but he mumbled again. His breath was sour and off, just off. Then he put his hand on my shoulder it seemed to stick to my jumper. I looked at him and he was smiling now. He looked me in the eyes and said, “Knock knock” with a grin. Instinctually I thought it best to play along, “Who’s there?”



“The Noddywonk” he answered excitedly. An uncanny happiness about him, but I wanted it over with.



“Noddywonk who?” I said. Then he leaned in breathing his warm moist air on me.



“I’ve found you”.  



I felt suddenly exposed, like everyone on the bus was looking at me. Having finished this joke he leaned back and relaxed into his chair. It freaked me out I just looked away. I didn’t know what to think really. That was it, the memory stops there. I presume I went on to have a normal day at school, probably told my friends about it though I don’t remember us mentioning it again. I do remember that as the bus drove away I looked back and saw through the window the man slide over into my seat. It bothered me. I suppose he wanted to look out the window. But the way he did it with such delight, I don’t know. Like I said, off. 



I hadn’t thought of it for years when the guy at work Roger he started telling this girl Claire one of his jokes. She looked a bit cornered honestly but it’s Roger’s thing to tell the jokes from his 100 Best Jokes From The Last Century book his wife got him as a stocking filler last Christmas. I was sat in my usual corner reading when I heard Roger say, “Knock knock"" and my lips mimed silently ‘I’ve found you’. It just happened, and then it all came back. I felt that clammy hand on my shoulder, that smell that plastic hat and damp coat thick with cold rain. And the milky cleavage and ‘perfume’ and her perfectly round arse. I tried to shake it off me and walked across the room to make a strong coffee, black and bitter to get that smell out my head. Claire was leaving having played her role for Roger. Roger is harmless really, a tall looming man with hairless arms and fists like balls of dough. His bushy brows and moustache are essentially interchangeable like a Mr Potato Head, and his shirts and trousers are always pressed. Ironing is one of his wife’s chief hobbies. It’s just when he talks to you he’s really talking at you. He’s on a mission to get one of these jokes out and you’re gonna be the one to listen and participate. His giant stature doesn’t help the feeling of being trapped. He had sat down to start his packed lunch; a neat cheese sandwich with the crusts cut off, they way his wife makes it for him. His wife is more a surrogate mother than a lover. I doubt they ever had sex after the birth of their son, who is more like a clone of Roger and is quickly approaching his height. I made my coffee not really intending to drink it so much as to breath the fumes and sat across from Roger. I asked him “Hey Roger you know a lot of jokes, I don’t suppose you’ve heard the one about the Noddywonk?” 



He looked at me. I think it was the first time I’d actually seen his eyes under those brows. He said, “I’ve found you. That’s the one isn’t it. I’ve found you.” He bit nervously into his cheese triangle leaving oddly small teeth marks. He said “I heard it when I was a little boy. I can’t believe I’d forgotten”. Roger’s at least 20 years older than me, despite the school bag he brings into work. I think this is the only job he’s ever had. It’s like he graduated straight from school and into the supermarket the following Monday. School bag and all. His wife started picking him up from work after his mother died of a sudden stroke. What he told me next, it was the first time I felt he was actually talking to me, without motive, not trying for a laugh or sympathy, this was really Roger. He told me one day when he was a little boy he had to walk to a train station at the end of the school day because his mum couldn’t pick him up. She was being treated for hypertension at the time. It was just the two of them, he depended on her for everything. He’d never taken a train before. He’d never walked through the city before. All he knew was his house, the blur of traffic from the car window, and his school. 



But this day he had to take a train. His mum had printed him instructions and he had his ticket in his pocket all day. He’d read it twenty times during his lunch break, back to front, front to back, even the fine print. Especially the fine print. His feet ached in his school shoes and his warm polyester trousers chaffed the inner skin on his legs. I picture him a podgy dumpling of a kid, still soft with baby fat. Though it’s hard to imagine him without the moustache. His school bag looked big on him then, and as he pushed through the giants of the city catching his nose on the bottoms of their shopping bags he eventually made it to the station, found a space on a bench, and waited. He waited an hour playing on his yellow gameboy which wasn’t so much his prized possession as it was his friend, his only friend. Another hour went by and he swapped out the cartridge and played another game. More time went past. Then his train pulled in, loud metal carriages linked bolt by bolt rattling on the rails so fast it seemed impossible to stop. But it did come to a stop screaming like an old woman caught under the tracks he imagined. He walked up to the edge of the platform and saw the empty gap to the door. He saw the black gravel on the tracks, the hot oily pistons that could crush a mans femur like a nutcracker. The door opened but he couldn’t hop the gap, he couldn’t will his little body to leave the platform. He watched his train leave from the bench and stared at the screen on his gameboy to distract from the anxiety rising in him like a hot syrup in his veins. His ears were bright red. His train wouldn’t come around for another hour. 



Another train came screaming into the station. He could hear chanting before the doors opened and when they did, packs of men came piling out and quickly filled the station. Some stag do probably. It was a Friday. Men doused in aftershave, oil slick hair and spray on shirts to show off their broad chests and the thick watches on their forearms. Even then he recognised the smell of alcohol. It’s what his mum smelled like if he went downstairs at night for a glass of water and he’d learned to leave her alone. These were already drunk. Apparently one of the older looking ones in a white shirt went up right next to Roger’s bench and snorted something off the closed ticket booth tray and returned to his lads cheering. Little Roger went and hid in the mens room, locking the toilet cubicle door behind him, trying to focus on the blips and beeps of his gameboy while the rowdy crowd shouted football chants and cheers and throaty exaggerated laughs from outside. Then he heard the door swing open and someone rap on the cubicle door. “Hey hey, knock knock!” At first Roger stayed silent and switched his gameboy off. “Mate I know you’re in there, knock knock!” Roger felt forced to answer, his little voice pure as a penny whistle, “Wh-who’s there?” 



“The Noddywonk!”



“N-Noddywonk who?”



“I’ve found you.” 



The phrase fell out his lips the same it did mine the moment before. “That was it” he said, “They left after that, after they finished the joke. I suppose I must’ve got my train eventually and made it home, I don’t really remember.” 



In the months since I’ve been trying ways of reaching out. I actually posted a notice to r/slowsheep asking if anyone’s had similar experiences but it was immediately removed by the moderators for breaching regulation C407 under section (g) of the compliance agreement stating that all compound nouns must be hyphenated when in collocation with a word ending in the letter ‘d’. After reaching out to the mod team to rectify the matter the mods informed me that I had been banned for 90 days for attempting to communicate with the mod team, and so my efforts there were brought to an end. 



I printed posters urging people to email me their stories. I even bought an ad in a local newspaper and that got one guy. He gave me his address wanted to chat in person. Old boy, hairy ears, pretty sure he had put shoe polish in his hair to make it black. It wafted thick in the air, reeked of paraffin. He welcomed me into his flat above an off-license, brushed the magazines away revealing the cushion of a chair. Tobacco stained walls and corners stacked with damp newspapers. I thumbed through the magazines while he was making us coffee in his kitchenette; tits, younger tits, tv guide, issue #19 of a spitfire model plane kit. I tried looking for it about the room but couldn’t see any models. He came back and handed me a coffee in a salmon pink mug. Some bits of something was floating on the skin of it so I put it down on the mug-ringed newspaper he used as a coaster. He settled back into the impression of his body in his sofa and drank heartily from his steaming mug. “I’m glad someone else has heard it” He said earnestly. “It’s been a long while”. His tired eyes looked up into his ceiling. “W-we were on our summer holiday, between school you know. 5 and 6. Between years 5 and 6 so we would’ve been about ten, elevenish something like that.” He described a perfect summer day. Bright blue sky and blazing sunshine, right off a magazine cover. “It was hot ya know you could see the haze of the heat off the road. Made the black tarmac sticky, tacked onto your tires it did, on our bikes we were all of us. We spent the summer cycling about, getting into trouble I suppose.” He laughed though his throat couldn’t quite manage it. 



He pulled a plastic lighter from his shirt pocket and lit a cigarette. “We were riding our bikes yes and we thought we’d head back to the park. When we got there we saw James on the swings, all by himself obviously.” He stopped again. “Such a sweet boy. We bullied him, had to really, if you were going to survive the playground, kids are tribal, in and out groups and you better make sure you’re in the in group you know what I mean son?” He tapped his cigarette into his ash tray, watching his own knobbly yellow fingers. “James was missin’ two fingers on his left hand. That’ll do it. I asked him once how he lost them and he said his mum told him he’d swallowed an elastic band and it found it’s way down his arm and into his hand and that was the only way they could get it out. He believed that story, and so did we. Anyway when the lads saw James there on the swings it was fair game for them. We went at him with the name calling”, “Cruel!” he spat on his own lap. “Cruel we were, I was. We did the name calling and the berating, ten years old. In the park. Then when he tried to leave they tugged on his coat, nipped and pecked like vultures they did, walking via Dolorosa was poor James. When he reached the edge of the park by our bikes they pushed him over, took his glasses and threw them into the wet grass. Laughing we mounted are bikes and cycled away.



But I hung back in a sudden spike of consciousness. I saw James clambering on the floor like Velma in Scooby Doo his sight was that bad. I would'nt have found his glasses were they not glinting white in the sun. I wiped the dew on my jumper, pulled off the grass and handed them back, helping him up I did.” I watched the old mans eyes glisten suddenly, “I’m so sorry James” he said to the ceiling. “Well he thanked me, sweet boy. I tried to tell him I didn’t really mean the things I said, I was just playing the game, if I’m friends with you they won’t be friends with me. But we could be friends outside of school. He nodded and agreed. He deserved more.” He took one last drag and breathed in the smoke. When he breathed it out again his breath was clear. “I walked with him back to his house, rolling my bike beside me. James he said ‘since we’re friends now do you want to hear a joke?’ I said sure James he said ‘Knock knock’ here we go I thought, 



‘Who’s there?’ 



‘The Noddywonk’. He stopped, so I stopped. No cars went by. No breeze. 



‘Noddywonk who?’ I said frowning. 



‘I’ve found you’.’



Well it didn’t make sense to me then and it doesn’t make sense to me now.” ‘Did you ask him where he’d heard it’ I asked. “Of course I did” He coughed, “Though James he was looking at me confused like I didn’t get the joke. Like he was Laughing when he first heard it? So I asked him who told him that and he said a man caught up to him as he was walking home from school one day. That’s all he said. The man jogged up to him, told him the joke and walked away in the same direction he’d came.” I gestured that I was getting up, thanked him for the coffee and left. I was relieved to breath the cool fresh air outdoors. No one else answered the ad. 



The more I’ve thought about it, the more I’ve sought it out, the more I’ve heard it. It’s like suddenly noticing all the smudges on your monitor or reading ‘you’ve just lost the game’, sorry. But it happened right here at work, I actually saw it play out in real time. I was working on the checkout, the one behind Claires, scanning items right to left. Claires real name is Mindy by the way she just wears Claires name badge. It’s company policy to always wear a name badge and they still haven't made her one yet, I know it’s stupid. Anyway all I could hear was our scanners beeping random rhythmless beeps amidst the din of shoppers. When it gets as busy as it was, usually Saturdays, I try to just zone out, disassociate. But something was irritating me. It was Claire’s ponytail swishing side to side like staring at the backside of a horse swatting flies off its arse. I don’t know it was just distracting me, keeping me in the moment. But it made me notice the kid in her queue finger about the chocolate bars tugging on his mums arm to buy him one. We put them right at the checkouts for exactly this purpose. But then the woman in front of them, the customer Claire was currently serving came into view. A middle-aged woman, skeletal with a scalp of thick shiny dreads that made her head look too big for her body. With a fixed grin she turned slowly to the boy setting her bright eyes on him. Then I heard it, through the noise, through the beeps through everything. “Knock knock!” She said to him smiling, anticipating. The boy scrunched up his face and looked to his mum who was nudging him saying something like ‘go on its alright’ as we do around unpredictable strangers. So the boy answered “Who’s there” Excitingly, eyes widening the woman replied, “The Noddywonk”. The boy now smiling too, “Noddywonk who?”



“I’ve found you!” 



It burst out her mouth like she’d just won a game of hide and seek no one else was playing. The boy dropped his smile and instinctually stepped behind his mums leg. I’d just witnessed it actually happen to another kid. And the woman she turned back around paid for her shopping and left. That was it. 



I thought it might be some local tradition, a form of hazing where the original meaning, a face to the name if any, has been lost. I went to my local council to sift through the public records. Two hundred odd years of local history, mostly all digitised. This information is publicly available anywhere but I was having trouble finding their servers from home. The city council building is a white stone monstrosity with a clock face carved into its facade. It’s always ten to midnight, like the doomsday clock, or brunch. It’s a monument to a false decadence, a put on, airs of history and riches the town never had. Greek pillars by the doors next to renaissance-esque statues of the towns ‘founding fathers’: A lawyer who successfully negotiated the quarrying of the neighbouring towns stone for essentially nothing. The spouse of a cousin of King William IV twice removed who was almost certainly a slaver, and his personal lawyer. Anyway I got searching on one of their computers, about ten years out of date, I’m pretty sure they’re on dial up. I was skim reading and searching Control+F for ‘The Noddywonk’ or any knock knock jokes, local traditions, folk lore or anecdotes. Nothing. Nothing except a fairly recent email to the local council on behalf of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the CWGC inquiring about missing graves in the local church cemetery. I’ll copy the email out here:



\\\[ Prof. Hilary Ross - Head of History debt. University of Kent. 



Dear Sir/Madame I am writing as part of a government initiative to erect permeant war memorials across England and Wales for the brave men who gave their lives in service of their country during The Great War. Working on behalf of the CWGC I have been using their records to curate the identities and final resting places of these soldiers. There are approximately 12,000 locations both public and private but we are aiming to have this project completed by the next memorial day. However we have noticed that several graves appear to be missing from your local church. It is not uncommon for graves to have been moved to private sites not maintained by the CWGC so any details of local activity concerning this matter would greatly aid in our efforts. I have compiled the list of names of those currently missing below:



Pte. Thomas Mann 1898-1916



Pte. Edward ‘Lucky’ Bucks 1899-1916



Ssgt. Albert Cunningham 1882-1916



Pte. John Barnes 1898-1916



Pte. Jonathan ‘Knock Knock’ Brown 1895-1916



Lt. Monty White 1889-1916 



Lt. Harry ‘Whose There?’ Harrison 1889-1916



Pte. Peter ‘Pete’ Cobbler 1897-1916



The Noddywonk



Pte. Henry Bishop 1889-1916



Lt. Toby ‘Noddywonk who?’ Buckingham 1885-1916



I’ve found you



Sent from my iPhone \\\]



It was like the whole thing was an elaborate joke, for a non-joke. Except the council had responded explaining the bodies had been exhumed some time in the 70’s by a coalition of the families involved and moved to private burial sites but had reached out to surviving members who gave permission for the names to be used in the new memorials. No mention or acknowledgment of the Noddywonk. 



I went to visit my mum at the new house she’s moved into shortly after, its only a few streets away from our childhood house. She’s downsized but chose it for the privacy of the garden that is guarded by tall pine trees from the woods beyond the fence. She’s kept some of my old toys and my juice cup is still right there in the cupboard, but it’s not the same. It’s like random fragments of your childhood popping up in a dream or during conversation. We sat outside on the patio. Brown pine needles were falling on my shoulders from the high tree tops as I watched the birds work out their pecking order at the feeder. Peanuts and meal-worm pellets. Spritely little tree sparrows and black velvet jackdaws, a big fluffy pigeon, grey and purple. Country pigeons are much gentler than the oil slicked masses you get in city centres. There’s a house for the hedgehogs and a coconut shell filled half with lard hanging by a hemp knot on the gate. It sort of feels like home I suppose. I watched her mouth purse from under the brim of her comically large sunhat keeping the white sun off her skin. She asked me how works’ going. I said ‘Its going alright’ deciding not to mention my recurring fantasy of gauging my boss’s eyes out with an ice-cream scoop and popping them in his mouth like marbles. 



She said she’d been going through some of my old things recently. Said she found a drawing I had brought home from school one day. It was scribbled in black biro, of a man or the figure of a man, blocking a doorway. Bright eyes and wide grin, dripping wet in a trench coat. She gave a sort of laugh and said “you called it Noddywonk”. Her new dog came up for a pet, a happy little boy, same breed as my dog growing up. I don’t remember drawing that picture but it was definitely one of my masterpieces. 



“I didn’t tell you this at the time, didn’t want to freak you out” She forced a laugh. “But that’s not the Noddywonk, not in my day it wasn’t anyway. I suppose it still made the rounds”. She rapped twice on the table with her knuckle. “When I was a little girl we’d play a game between classes. We’d lock one of us in the groundskeepers shed at the edge of the play field, in the shade of the tree line. You’d go in and they’d lock the door behind you. No room to move in there by the rusty rakes and oil cans. And it’s completely dark. Then they’d knock twice. You say ‘who’s there’, then they’d say ‘the Noddywonk’. ‘Noddywonk who?’ You say. Then they’d make you wait. See how long you can last in there before shouting ‘I’ve found you!’ and let you out. 



Silly game really. We stopped playing it after one girl, S-Sally Plumb, Sally she played it on her own one night, as a dare. We snuck into the school grounds after dark during the summer holidays. We were going to take turns locking each other inside to see if the Noddywonk would knock. Sally was the first, and no one else played after that. We shut her in there, locked the latch and ran back across the field. We closed our eyes, face down in the cut grass, and began to count, giggling at first. Sally wasn’t really a part of our friend group but she was trying to be. She still wore plastic beads in her hair while we were already in training bras. Children are awful really. She must have been getting so anxious in that dark cavity, no sound but for the wind whistling under the door. But we could hear her. We heard her say, ‘Who’s there?’. She’d began it. We didn’t look up or else it wouldn’t work. Then we heard, ‘Noddywonk who?’ in a shaking voice. Then she screamed rattling the metal roof of the shed. She screamed ‘let me out let me out’ begging, banging on the door like a drum. We freaked and ran, back through the hole in the chain fence and away up the road. Sally was in that shed all night. A passer by walking their dog the next morning heard her tired raspy cries and called the school who sent the groundskeeper to let her out. She transferred to another school soon after. Never told on us and we never talked about her since. I’m glad you only came home with a drawing, all things considered.” She took off her sunhat and flopped it on the table. “It’s just a cruel game I think.""



I left doubting if I should keep pursuing this, it’s not exactly reaping pleasant memories for those who’ve heard of it. In fact I intended to just leave it alone, ‘just a cruel game’ she said, and it seemed to be, until I heard this last account. 



I was sat in the dentist’s waiting room, checking my phone looking around the beige walls and the beige skinned people with beige teeth. Right in front of me was a giant poster with a chef on it, three times the size of a human being. The size all adults look when you’re a little kid. She was the spitting image of Lucy Liu but not quite Lucy Liu because it just wasn’t her, but she was wearing a chefs hat and a tea towel over her shoulder and she was looking right at me. Arched black eyes and glossy white teeth. This could be you. Does she want to cook for me? Why a chef? Teeth is for chewing, chefs make food I suppose there’s a link there. Why does the chef have particularly clean teeth though? I didn’t like the way she was looking at me so I resumed looking about the room. 



A man was fidgeting in his plastic cushioned seat. He had a flop of fringe over one eye while the other eye shifted up and down, and his left hand was in his jacket pocket while the other was gripping the arm rest. A sort of awkward asymmetry about him that made me think of the joke. I felt compelled to ask him. I got up and sat next to him and just went straight for it. I went ‘Hey man, there’s this joke that’s bothering me and no one really gets it, it goes, knock knock -‘ His exposed eye pierced mine. I shut up. I mean I really shut up this guy looked unpredictable. His right hand found its pocket and he hunched over. “P-please don’t” he said in a soft sweet voice. “I think I know that one”. I was sure he did, it’s like we’re marked by it, passed on from person to person, but I had to know ‘So who told you then? It’s driving me crazy man, it’s like a splinter festering in my memory’. 



“I know” he said again. Then “crazy” he echoed, like I was talking to my future self talking back to me. He brushed his fringe down over his brow and looked down the zip of his jacket.



“When I was a- we’re all kids aren’t we. When I was a kid, I was getting ready for bed. Mum and dad were getting ready for a party, opening and closing drawers, gossiping about guests, friends from work, ‘let me do your tie its always too long’, clicking of buckles and buttons and heels on the wood floor of the landing. Mum came to tuck me in wobbling in her party shoes, she never wore heels. She looked so lovely. She pulled my baby blue covers up to my neck and tucked the ends tight under my mattress. She rushed through a page of our book, kissed me on my cheek and said she’d be back late. She blew me a kiss, turned the light out and closed my bedroom door. I watched their shadows flicker from the strip of light in the gap under the door. I heard them go down the stairs, jingling keys out the tray and the front door open and finally close. I remember feeling the cold air above me from my open window, and hearing the car drive away down the road, turn out of the street and fade far away. Then all was quiet. So quiet. 



I could hear my heartbeat in my neck. I could hear the slick of my eyeballs moving in their sockets. All I could see was the glint of my teddy’s glass eyes at the foot of my bed and the strip of light from the landing under the door. I closed my eyes, and tried to go to sleep. Then I heard the thud on the stair. The first stair. Then another thud, onto the second stair. Up they climbed slowly, heavy shoes, heavy steps. I heard no-one come in. No-one had come in. Up the stairs they climbed. They’re on the landing now. I can see their shadow moving under the door, closer and closer. Then the toes of two boots pointing at me from out the strip of light and the breathing on the door. The pause. I watched wide eye’d waiting, waiting for something to happen. Then \\\*knock knock\\\*. They knocked twice. Polite, pedestrian knocks. My breath came out first, ‘w-whose there?’



“The Noddywonk” it answered gleefully. I could hear them smile with the word.



I waited, feeling compelled to play along as a kid placates an adult. But I was shaking I think. So shaky. ‘Noddywonk, who?’ I asked it finally. 



It breathed on the door, “I’ve found you”. 



I stared in long silence. Then I watched as the boots turned slowly away, the shadows receding from my bedroom door, and listened to them walk slowly back down the stairs. But they didn’t open the front door to leave. I didn’t hear any door go. I was sure they were still there, waiting for me. I pictured myself on the landing leaning over the bannister being greeted by a smiling stranger at the foot of the stairs. But I didn’t leave my bed. I dared not sleep that night. I don’t think I even blinked, watching for any more shadows under the door. I felt a wash of relief when I heard my parents keys in the front door. Finally my mum came in to check on me. I told her all about it but she brushed it off as a nightmare. I never mentioned it to anyone after that.” His name got called out by the dentists assistant. He got up, looked past her into the room with the stainless steel chair and sink, turned around and left into the street. 



I really don’t know what to make of it. It’s like a bad joke taken too far. I’m hoping by posting this I’ll reach others who’ve had similar experiences, who’ve heard of the Noddywonk. Has he found you? ",1,1742327133.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I come from a strict religion, where ur not allowed to have relationships etc. i haven’t had the best relationship w my religion, but for the last 4 years I’ve grown and have gotten so much closer to my religion. I genuinely am the type of person to keep my opinions to my self and don’t ask for others because I simply don’t care. You will not put your believes onto me, and I would never put mine on someone else, and especially if that’s to do w religion, u see I get triggered when someone starts talking about my past w religion and I hate talking ab it with anyone else in general. 

Now, I met him when we were 13 and 14, and been inseparable since. you’re not necessarily allowed to have guy friends but my entire family knew him and we always had a good bond nothing too much. I started to feel smth different about him as an individual at around 15 and he had them ever since we met. we decided to share this w our parents and soon after we were set the date for in a week. now we have different sectors in our religion, and were from the opposite ones, the sector I believe in, is hated on because of mis led information. I don’t do the unnecessary bs and he knows that.

The day before yesterday, we were taking and I asked him if I was doing this particular thing correct, and he went on to say no, and I said “well in my sector people do that” and he goes “well I don’t really give a f, now do I?” bruv when I tell u I lost it. Before u guys say I over reacted, this was the third time this happened, and I was over it. I replied saying “u don’t have to be rude about it, I never told u to believe in it, all I’m asking is for some respect and not to be a total d about it”, and surely we started arguing. He has the habit of swearing and completely losing it when he’s angry. I told him to speak to me when he’s not angry and we can talk about it like adults, he said alright and it has been three days since. 

I’m sick of him disregarding my believes, I never tell him to believe in it, never put my opinions onto him and never pressure him into doing smth he don’t want to. All I ask for is respect. And guys were mature when it comes to these things and we rarely argue, me him and my mum were going to go for coffee today and I mean neither of us said smth so…  what should I do?

I (30M) have “quit” on multiple occasions over the past 4 years, just as many of you have. This time was a little different, as the side effects finally led to my wife calling an ambulance on Friday evening around 10:30pm. 

I had just finished a shower and popped in my *17th?* Zyn of the day. Multiple cups of coffee that day as well to help pull through another shift at work (I am a tool shop supervisor). 

My blood pressure had been high on multiple occasions since starting Zyn, but it was just the “sacrifice” I made for getting a buzz and being a bitch. 

Anyway, I don’t want to type it all out right now as it’s hard for me to talk about. I had a full on anxiety/panic attack. When EMS showed up, my pulse was 165 and BP 180/110… prior to them arriving at the house I thought I was going to die. All I could think about was my kids and my wife as I could feel pressure in my head rising and my left arm going numb. I lied in bed and prayed aloud. I asked God not to take me yet. 

I hope you take this as a sign to quit. It’s never worth it. I’ve since been eating healthy / exercising and associating all nicotine to the absolute WORST thing I’ve ever been through, and therefore my cravings have been minimal. I flat don’t want it anymore. 

It sucks ass that it took THAT experience to get me to finally say “I’m done”, but thank God I was able to recover from it and get my act together. 

My BP / heart rate has dropped significantly. I purchased a BP monitor on Saturday morning and so far my highest reading was 135/95. May take several days, months to get back to normal and healthy levels again. Maybe even years. I don’t care, I’m just done and I’m thankful God’s given me this opportunity.

And when I say fill you up, I could smash a 12 pack of quest bars and still be hungry, but I’m satisfied after 2 of these.

Macros range on their bars from 130-170 and 20-22 grams of protein from what I’ve seen.


No idea why there aren’t more bars like this in the U.S as this is an Australian bar. But if you are in the U.S you can find these on Amazon.

1jedqcy,https://www.reddit.com/r/turo/comments/1jedqcy/stinky_vehicle/,Stinky Vehicle,"My ongoing adventures with Turo continue, this time with a car that smells like urine and spilled coffee. I didn't realize just how bad it was until about 15 minutes into the drive since I had the windows down. Any tips on how to effectively document a smell?

I reached out to the host, but they claim they don't notice anything, and their previous renter didn't mention a problem. I can already sense where this is headed.

To make things even better, Turo refuses to find me another car or start a new booking until I return this one. I wouldn't be surprised if they refund me and leave me without a car. They're already $1,000 in the hole on this rental since it's a replacement for a host who canceled 22 hours before pickup. The chaos with this platform never ends!

1jedq1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jedq1b/apex_legato_v2_water_tank_leaking/,Apex Legato v2 water tank leaking,"Hi,

I ordered the MiiCoffee Apex v2 from Amazon UK and it arrived today.

Upon my first extraction I noticed that there is water leaking from the tank on the bottom left hole.

At the moment, I applied some gorilla glue to make sure it doesn't leak.

But just wondering if anyone has this issue before and any solutions?

( I've contacted amazon and they seem to only do a refund on return but I was just wondering if MiiCoffee will send out a replacement water tank so I can keep using the machine )",1,1742326551.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

1jedmwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jedmwn/the_watcher_on_campus_wont_leave_me_alone/,The Watcher on Campus Won’t Leave Me Alone,"I’m a junior at UCF, psychology major, and I think I’ve got a stalker. It started a couple weeks ago, late March, when I was leaving the John C. Hitt Library after a cram session for midterms. It was past midnight, campus was dead, and I felt this itch, like someone was staring at me. I glanced at the Reflection Pond on my way to the parking lot, and there he was: this guy in a gray hoodie, just standing there, watching. He didn’t move, didn’t wave, just stared. I booked it to my car and figured it was some creep who’d wandered onto campus. 

But then I saw him again. Last Tuesday, I was grabbing coffee at the Student Union food court, and he was there, sitting across the room, same hoodie, eyes locked on me. I tried to brush it off, UCF’s huge, right? Maybe he’s just some weird student, but it’s been too many times now. Thursday, I found a note in my locker at Colbourn Hall. It said, “You’re not safe by Lake Underhill. Be careful tomorrow.” I’ve never told anyone here about that spot, I used to fish there with my dad before he passed, and I crashed my bike into the water once when I was 12. How does this guy know that? 

Friday, I was walking near Lake Underhill after class, and a massive tree branch crashed down right where I’d been standing a second before. I’m shaking just typing this. I told my roommate, Sarah, and she said I should report it to campus security, but I didn’t have proof, just the note and a bad feeling. So last night, we set a trap. I had Sarah sit at the Student Union food court while I watched from the second floor. Sure enough, he showed up, hovering near her table, staring at her like he knew she was with me.  

I couldn’t take it anymore. I followed him out, tailing him past the Pegasus Statue toward the Addition Financial Arena. He didn’t even try to hide, just walked slow, like he wanted me to catch up. When I finally cornered him by the arena doors, I yelled, “Who are you? What do you want?” He turned, and up close, he looked off: pale, twitchy, with these dark circles under his eyes. He said his name was Tyler, and then he muttered, “I’m trying to keep you safe, Emma. Nathan told me you’re in danger.”    
  
I froze. I never told him my name. And Nathan? That’s not a name I’ve mentioned to anyone at UCF. My cousin Nathan died five years ago, but there’s no way this guy could know that. I asked what he meant, and he just stared at me, then said, “You’re not alone here. There are things on this campus you can’t see. Nathan’s been watching, and he’s not the only one.”  

Before I could say anything, he bolted into the crowd near the arena. I didn’t chase him, my legs wouldn’t move. When I got back to my dorm in Towers Hall, I swear I heard something: a whisper, like “Trust him,” right as I turned off the lights. The bulb flickered, and for a second, I thought I saw a shadow move across my wall, but nothing was there when I looked again.

I hated it. I felt like a robot. It was heavily micromanaged but also there was so much work all of the time. From 8-5 it was nonstop working almost always stayed after 5pm, no down time, and was even nervous to go use the bathroom and be away from my desk for too long. I honestly and truly believe corporate life isn’t for me. I don’t feel smart in it I don’t feel capable. And corporate leaves me depressed and oh so anxious. 

I quit that job and wanted so badly to work for myself. So I tried affiliate marketing on tiktok which isn’t going the best. I have so many ideas for businesses I want to try out. Jewelry, customizable phone cases, food trucks, coffee trucks/delivery. But they just all seem so unreachable. Maybe I’m too scared to even try? But my main goal would be to eventually work for myself and/or get a job that’s not super stressful with a set amount of hours, no over time, so I can use my free time to build something for myself as another income. 

Those of you over 30 and NOT in corporate, what do you do for work? And more importantly do you enjoy it? Does it have a good work life balance? Stressful? ",13,1742326333.0,AskWomenOver30,57,0.93,False

1jedisx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jedisx,I'm lost with my mom's funeral costs,"I'm drowning. It's hard enough to lose someone you were so close to, but the reality always come to bite you in the butt.

I’m Fred, I’m 48-year-old, I live in Belgium. And this was my mom, Laura, 87-year-old when she passed away.

She was so fun, but also strong and fragile at the same time, a very explosive mix ! Born in 1937, her parents were in the belgian resistance, she lived during the war and she had her dad taken to concentration camp, they thought he was dead for 2 years (my grand-pa was actually still alive in the camp, he was freed in 1945 but he was a broken man). Her live wasn’t always a long, quiet river but she always remained strong and positive.

End of 90s she was treated for 2 cancers, it took its toll on her but she was a survivor. Although the radiotherapy left her with a pulmonary fibrosis, unfortunately it’s degenerative. She was on oxygen 24/7 but despite all that, she was again always strong and positive.

Since 2018 her health became more challenging, at least about her autonomy. She started to have trouble to walk, she needed someone to take care of her. It wasn’t a full time job, but it was getting closer to that…. She NEVER was a burden, on the contrary, it brought us even closer. She was relieved that she didn’t have to deal with everything, she was calling me her own personal secretary, it made us laugh because I was the one everyone was contacting about everything. Once again,I never questioned my roled, I did it because it was my mom and I loved every minute of taking care of her.

Time passing by, her autonomy became a bit more problematic. We had to hire people, respiratory physio, a daily help, nurses, but I always kept a role in her life because I wanted to take care of her. So I still was in charge of doing her shopping, I was driving her around, to her medical apointments, I was preparing her food, it was working pretty well !

January 22, everything stopped. In the morning, we were at her brother’s funeral, my uncle. She was sad, tired, she didn’t even want to come back to my place after that (she spent the evening before with me, we watched Harry Potter she never saw it ! She was right in my arms, laughing) which was pretty rare. She wanted to come back home and rest. Arrived at home, I transferred her from her wheelchair to her rollator, I kissed her forehead and told her that everything will be okay, that I’ll roll her to her couch, put her comfortably, prepare her some coffee and she’ll be able to rest.

Just when we reached the couch, she was gone. Facing me, it’s weirdly comforting to tell myself that I’m the last person she saw, I was the last thing she literally saw. Ambulance, trying to bring her back but it didn’t work. She passed away from a cardiac arrest. She didn’t suffer, she didn’t even realize. I wouldn’t wish my worst enemy to lose someone in front of them, the trauma is real. With time it’s getting better, only the best memories are resurfacing. But it feels so empty…

And life must go on. Funerals january 31, it was a beautiful simple ceremony. But life always find a way to go sideways, it turned into a wreck. 

So many things to deal with, bills, funerals, debt, costs, I did as much as I could, but after spending all my savings for the last bills, the debts and the 1500 euros of deposit for the funeral home, I’m broke, I can't pay for the rest of the bill for her funeral. I can’t do anything anymore, and I feel like a failure, trying to make ends to just eat. The shame is indescribable.

I feel like I let her down. I keep on reading “due date for the invoice”, 4138,20 euros that seem like a mountain for me. I feel so alone in all that.

So I just try, why not. I have nothing to lose anyway.

Thank you for her, thank your for us.

And no matter what, thank you for just having a thought and a prayer for her, she made an impact wherever she went.

I love you mom, I miss you so much.

I am not new to coffee, as I have gathered a few different coffee making devices that I love (V60, French Press, Mochamaster, Aeropress) and have dabbled in roasting. I am looking to jump into the world of espresso now.

I know enough about espresso to know it is a deep hobby with a lot of variables that need to be controlled for consistent results. the catch with this: I am a working father who tries to keep things consistent and easy to manage, as I do not have unlimited time and patience to have to redial in a machine each use. I figured out how to get consistent and repeatable results with the V60, and I hope I can do that with the much more difficult espresso if I am able to get into it.

So, what are your recommendations? Budget is not unlimited, but I am willing to squirrel away for a while to buy a good set up instead instead of rushing to buy the cheaper alternative. I will need a machine and a new espresso focused grinder. My goal is to make something that is better than my favorite coffee place, which is a high bar as my spot impresses me almost every time.

Been thinking about posting for the last 2-3 months. But alas, finally I am here.

  
I am a late bloomer when it comes to relationships. This is my first significant one and definitely the most intense. I fell in love very hard but very slowly with my boyfriend. For some background we met online 4-5 years prior to us being in a relationship. We went out but nothing came out of it because I wasn't emotionally available. So, I told him to move on cuz it's going to take a while until I get my stuff together and be able to be with anyone due to some unprocessed trauma. He asked me sincerely if I like him and see potential in the future to be together and of course I did, but I was very, very messed up. He proposed to stay as friends and I decided to go to therapy. We talked constantly and last year around march-April we started to talk more, then started playing games online then went out a couple of times aaaand in July we officially started dating. It was great! Finally we found our way to each other.

 

I say finally, because I've been trying since December - January last year to get closer to him, but he was constantly traveling in a location or another. First in January for a week, then in March for another week. This will become relevant later on.

Event Numero 1. :  
So, we officially started our relationship in July and in November I was meeting all his friends, which was great because he has more connections than I do and boy, do I need to get out of house more. I was excited to make new friends and be included in his life more. We decided to go with his main group of friend to a Dance Festival and he announced me that there would be another family friend of his joining us (34F). I will call her A. When A came to us on the dance floor my bf wen straight to her. He introduced me, but slowly they made their own bubble out from the group. They were laughing and talking and dancing and his friends were dancing in couples (we were 3 couples) and I felt left out and plainly ignored by my bf. I tried to catch his eyes but he was looking only at A. So, I went and put myself between them and started dancing with my boyfriend, because that's what he came there to do. And if he didn't notice me wanting attention then I'd go asking him for it. They never got back to creating their own bubble again after that and the evening continued pretty ok. It was fun, and I felt extremely paranoid and silly. But I made a mental note about this person. A red light if you want.

 

Event Numero 2:

  
Still in November, one evening we decided to go to the Christmas time first time as a couple – we’ve been many times as friends. It was our reward from cooking and doing chores all day – we both are pretty busy with our jobs and have to schedule chores for a certain day/weekend. And right as my bf was done cooking his delicious Carbonara, he receives a message and the looks at me an asks “Do you mind B coming over? She’s nearby and wants to visit.” B is another friend who’s a girl from his main group of friends whom I didn’t have the chance to meet so sure, I agreed and invited her to dine with us, but my bf shook his head and said he already asked her and said she just need to vent about work.

Long story short, I met B and she vented away as we ate and my bf just kinda retreated in his own corner and started looking on Instagram on his phone as me and B bonded. She started telling me about how they met, how long they’ve been friends, while my boyfriends just wasn’t engaged in the convo at all. He even got up to take a shower and disappeared. B changed her attitude a little bit and started telling me about all the things her and my boyfriend used to do. They used to go to the movies together with his best friend and his wife; they used to travel together; she used to look after his cat while he was away on vacations or traveling for work – this is where I joked she must have been pretty cold staying here, in his apartment,  because my boyfriend’s apartment is notoriously cold all the time and she agreed and pointed at me “This is why I bought him this house robe you’re wearing. It’s always so cold!”.

Aaaand at that I switched subjects because it sounded like she was trying to tell me that I was taking her place, when I knew there has never been anything besides friendship between them and I was getting uncomfortable. My bf appears as by miracle after the shower and I tell him I also wanted to start getting ready to go out (I wasn’t aware that we were still going to the Fair since his friend was visiting us) and he got snappy, saying that if I don’t get ready fast enough there won’t be a Fair to see anymore because it was getting too late. B quickly left after that, taking the cue that it’s time to go. We talked later, and he admitted being snappy because he was expecting B to be gone by the time he was done with the shower because she wrote him “I’ll just pass by quickly!” when in reality she overstayed.

I kept bothering me, the talk with B, so I approached my boyfriend and told him about it. He reacted immediately and said that what she did was inappropriate and promising he was going to talk to her. I insisted on the subject because I felt like I was missing information and he admitted that she might have had a crush on him once but he made if pretty clear he wasn’t interested in her years ago. Anway, he was going to talk to her.   

 

Bonus events:

My boyfriend’s main group has a tradition on Christmas: Secret Santa. They all make wish lists and randomly pick each other’s names. My boyfriend asked if I could participate as well since I was part of the group now as his gf and they refused because I was too new and practically a stranger to them and wouldn’t know what to get me (they have Secret Santa wish lists for everybody!). B was part of this event as she is part of the main group.

My boyfriend and B also have a 1-to-1 tradition around Christmas to exchange gifts. This is when my BF decided to have the talk about limits and how she’s positioning herself toward me.

 

Event Numero 3:

Months pass and we were nearing our first vacation together in another country in February this yea. We were extremely excited both about being the first time we are traveling together abd because we were going to see another country. Just a week before leaving, on a Thursday morning (on a working day) my boyfriend got a call just as I was logging in for work (I wfh) and my boyfriend was fresh from the shower. He gives a very hesitant “…Yeah, I guess?” and turned to me. B was coming to surprise us with a visit at 8 A.M on a working day.

I was stunned as she was already knocking on the door and my boyfriend was putting on underwear and told me “Can you tend to her please?”.  Jaw on the floor and hand on the bedroom handle as I asked “Can you please close the door when you dress as I tend to her please?” And off I was to be a good host.

She was surprised to see me at his place and with my work laptop on. I invited her in and she waited for my boyfriend. She said they were supposed to meet at the subway at 8:30 but decided to come see the cat. In my bf’s apartment. At 8 AM.  I said nothing just entered my morning meeting as that were scrambling out of the apartment.

The evening crawled in so slowly as all day we’re been texting about the event and how inappropriate it was that he allowed her to do that without asking me if I was ok with it, if it was or not intruding on my meetings (he insisted I stay over and work from his place that week). If I wanted her there first thing in the morning or not. And I was saying over and over again that we’d talk when he got home from work.

He came home with flowers, sweets, food and a pretty good apology. He realized B overstepped his and my boundaries. He thought he had no choice but to invite her over since she was practically by his door when she called, but realized he CAN say no. He was going to talk with her again.

And I asked him very sincerely, how intimate were or have been? Because he had no problem changing his underwear while I was going to open the front door for her (you can see directly into the bedroom from the entry). And he said never ever has there been something between them. I didn’t believe him, but I made a mental note about it.

 

Bonus event again: A called him randomly two days before we went on vacay, to ask him to a coffee with her. He politely said that she could come over when I was working from home and we can all have coffe together and she said “Ok, we’ll see, we’ll see.”

 

Event Numero 4:

We went on vacation and our accommodations sucked. We had bugs (I hate bugs, I have a phobia). And it was cold, colder than outside. On Valentine’s day (our second day there) we had a fight about it and my perception of his total lack of empathy to my difficulties with the bugs (I didn’t sleep the first night). We also had a talk about communication between us and how he feels I’m not listening to him when he says something because I already made up my mind about the subject so his opinion doesn’t really matter. And he blamed my profession (not going to say what it is, but I listen to a lot of people talk). I pointed out he blamed my profession before, when he feels like I’m too insistent with questions when I was trying to get to know him. He jokingly asked if I have other questions that were left uncovered.

So, I asked him who were his previous sexual partners before me.

That escalated quickly, I know. But I had a theory and I had to test it. I also asked if they are still around, in his close friend groups.

He said yes, they are still around, and it’s A and B.

And about then my vacation ended  in my head and I started asking myself where is this relationship going? If I should ended or no?

Because he lied to me in my face about B, when I asked him a week before when she came over   how intimate were they? Or have been? And he said that NEVER EVER has there been something between them.

He defended himself and said nothing SERIOUS or not a relationship, but they did have sex once, years before and never again. He invited to his place because he knew she was attracted to him and he hadn’t had sex in a very long time. And it happened. Then he has to explain to her 2-3 times that he didn’t want to be with her and that it happened that one time and it was just sex. Over the years, they remained good friends and have a lot of common groups of friends.

With A is different. A is his godmother’s friend and older than up by 5-6 years. They shared a hotel room in December 2024 after the New Year’s Eve and started touching but nothing happened. Then, in January 2024 they had sex while they were both visiting his godmother in another country. Then they decided to continue doing so when they came home.  At some point she said she’s involved in a situationship that might evolve and they can’t continue their friends-with-benefits affair. But they already had plans to go to Bali in March 2024 so they went as friends and nothing happened between them in Bali or ever again. Or so he said.

We started talking more in March 2024.

I was and still am extremely hurt that he lied to me, that he has hidden this to me, that his friends knew about this when we went to that dance event when I first met A – that he never gave me a choice if I ever want to meet either of them.

We had numerous fights over this because I believe it’s obvious from A’s and especially B’s actions that he has unfinished business with both of them. And I feel disrespected and humiliated. Not to mention jealous and uncomfortable.  

I wanted to be the cool girlfriend who can be friends with old flames and former fwb, but I can’t, cuz I have my emotional needs as well. And to be fair I find his friendship with both of them really bizarre. I just can’t see it as friendship.

Now, a month later, I finally reached the conclusion I want them as far away from my relationship as possible. He has been very condescending about it “What do you want me to do? Just cut them out of my life?” and so on.

And yes, that’s exactly what I told him. I want him to tend to his unfinished business with both of them. He never talked with B the second time she intruded on us (or he let her intrude on us), A is still asking him over for a coffee, what on earth is going on?

He assured me that he doesn’t want to keep his options open or cheat, but he though that what happened with both of them it’s in the past and we can all be friends together. We can all move on. And he even hoped that me, A and him could one day enjoy coffee together (I suggested a threesome since we’re at it).

So, in simple terms I told him, he has to choose: me or them. He agreed to talk les frequently with both of them and try to find the right words and time.

And of course I saw messages on his phone from both of them, because he still talks to them. And I confronted him and he denied it until I dared him to prove it to me and show me his convos. Once again, he lied to my face and said he hasn’t been speaking to B since February. In reality, he showed me, they’ve been talking almost everyday. He has her on his Netflix, Disney+, HBO subscriptions. I see her name every time we open a new episode of something.

He said I am pushing him to do things my way and NOW. When he needs time cuz he never cut anyone ever from his life like this. So, I told him, sure. He should wait 1-3 months when he’s not going to have a relationship anymore.

That seemed to get to him; he said only now he understood how urgently I wanted this solved. And he will take care of it IF I stop talking about either of them and stop being petty or say petty comments. I deal has been struck.

 He texted B and told her they need to talk face-to-face and they will when she gets back from her extended vacation from another country. He assured me this is he talk.

With A things were simpler; two days after writing to B, he talked on the phone with A and told her they shouldn’t be friend anymore because he told me about their history and it makes me awkward, especially since I could notice on that Dance event that something weird between then and it makes me uncomfortable. She told his he should have never said a thing to me, that these are matters when one shouldn’t be sincere. What I don’t know, won’t hurt me, blah blah, something along those lines. He was crushed after this conversation and we had another fight, because what he told me was that he said to her to talk more seldom – I don’t want his to talk more seldom with his fwb, I want her out of the picure completely. He felt nothing he doing about the situation will be enough for me.

A unfollowed both me and him on Instagram and removed us from her followers. Suffice to say, she’s pissed.

Even though, we have decided on a course of action, on a solution I feel uneasy. I still feel angry and uncomfortable and hurt. I still feel resentful and bitter and I’m afraid this will affect the relationship to the break of just ending it, which would defeat the purpose of trying to find a solution.

I love my boyfriend, but was I too extreme to put such a hard limit? Am I too immature or closed-minded to understand fwb and or one night stands with close friends that continue being ‘just close friends’ in the present? Am I ever going to get over it and be on with our relationship without thinking about it?

How do I prevent myself from sabotaging my own relationship after all is said and done?  ",2,1742325836.0,relationship_advice,3,0.75,False

Been thinking about posting for the last 2-3 months. But alas, finally I am here.

  
I am a late bloomer when it comes to relationships. This is my first significant one and definitely the most intense. I fell in love very hard but very slowly with my boyfriend. For some background we met online 4-5 years prior to us being in a relationship. We went out but nothing came out of it because I wasn't emotionally available. So, I told him to move on cuz it's going to take a while until I get my stuff together and be able to be with anyone due to some unprocessed trauma. He asked me sincerely if I like him and see potential in the future to be together and of course I did, but I was very, very messed up. He proposed to stay as friends and I decided to go to therapy. We talked constantly and last year around march-April we started to talk more, then started playing games online then went out a couple of times aaaand in July we officially started dating. It was great! Finally we found our way to each other.

 

I say finally, because I've been trying since December - January last year to get closer to him, but he was constantly traveling in a location or another. First in January for a week, then in March for another week. This will become relevant later on.

Event Numero 1. :  
So, we officially started our relationship in July and in November I was meeting all his friends, which was great because he has more connections than I do and boy, do I need to get out of house more. I was excited to make new friends and be included in his life more. We decided to go with his main group of friend to a Dance Festival and he announced me that there would be another family friend of his joining us (34F). I will call her A. When A came to us on the dance floor my bf wen straight to her. He introduced me, but slowly they made their own bubble out from the group. They were laughing and talking and dancing and his friends were dancing in couples (we were 3 couples) and I felt left out and plainly ignored by my bf. I tried to catch his eyes but he was looking only at A. So, I went and put myself between them and started dancing with my boyfriend, because that's what he came there to do. And if he didn't notice me wanting attention then I'd go asking him for it. They never got back to creating their own bubble again after that and the evening continued pretty ok. It was fun, and I felt extremely paranoid and silly. But I made a mental note about this person. A red light if you want.

 

Event Numero 2:

  
Still in November, one evening we decided to go to the Christmas time first time as a couple – we’ve been many times as friends. It was our reward from cooking and doing chores all day – we both are pretty busy with our jobs and have to schedule chores for a certain day/weekend. And right as my bf was done cooking his delicious Carbonara, he receives a message and the looks at me an asks “Do you mind B coming over? She’s nearby and wants to visit.” B is another friend who’s a girl from his main group of friends whom I didn’t have the chance to meet so sure, I agreed and invited her to dine with us, but my bf shook his head and said he already asked her and said she just need to vent about work.

Long story short, I met B and she vented away as we ate and my bf just kinda retreated in his own corner and started looking on Instagram on his phone as me and B bonded. She started telling me about how they met, how long they’ve been friends, while my boyfriends just wasn’t engaged in the convo at all. He even got up to take a shower and disappeared. B changed her attitude a little bit and started telling me about all the things her and my boyfriend used to do. They used to go to the movies together with his best friend and his wife; they used to travel together; she used to look after his cat while he was away on vacations or traveling for work – this is where I joked she must have been pretty cold staying here, in his apartment,  because my boyfriend’s apartment is notoriously cold all the time and she agreed and pointed at me “This is why I bought him this house robe you’re wearing. It’s always so cold!”.

Aaaand at that I switched subjects because it sounded like she was trying to tell me that I was taking her place, when I knew there has never been anything besides friendship between them and I was getting uncomfortable. My bf appears as by miracle after the shower and I tell him I also wanted to start getting ready to go out (I wasn’t aware that we were still going to the Fair since his friend was visiting us) and he got snappy, saying that if I don’t get ready fast enough there won’t be a Fair to see anymore because it was getting too late. B quickly left after that, taking the cue that it’s time to go. We talked later, and he admitted being snappy because he was expecting B to be gone by the time he was done with the shower because she wrote him “I’ll just pass by quickly!” when in reality she overstayed.

I kept bothering me, the talk with B, so I approached my boyfriend and told him about it. He reacted immediately and said that what she did was inappropriate and promising he was going to talk to her. I insisted on the subject because I felt like I was missing information and he admitted that she might have had a crush on him once but he made if pretty clear he wasn’t interested in her years ago. Anway, he was going to talk to her.   

 

Bonus events:

My boyfriend’s main group has a tradition on Christmas: Secret Santa. They all make wish lists and randomly pick each other’s names. My boyfriend asked if I could participate as well since I was part of the group now as his gf and they refused because I was too new and practically a stranger to them and wouldn’t know what to get me (they have Secret Santa wish lists for everybody!). B was part of this event as she is part of the main group.

My boyfriend and B also have a 1-to-1 tradition around Christmas to exchange gifts. This is when my BF decided to have the talk about limits and how she’s positioning herself toward me.

 

Event Numero 3:

Months pass and we were nearing our first vacation together in another country in February this yea. We were extremely excited both about being the first time we are traveling together abd because we were going to see another country. Just a week before leaving, on a Thursday morning (on a working day) my boyfriend got a call just as I was logging in for work (I wfh) and my boyfriend was fresh from the shower. He gives a very hesitant “…Yeah, I guess?” and turned to me. B was coming to surprise us with a visit at 8 A.M on a working day.

I was stunned as she was already knocking on the door and my boyfriend was putting on underwear and told me “Can you tend to her please?”.  Jaw on the floor and hand on the bedroom handle as I asked “Can you please close the door when you dress as I tend to her please?” And off I was to be a good host.

She was surprised to see me at his place and with my work laptop on. I invited her in and she waited for my boyfriend. She said they were supposed to meet at the subway at 8:30 but decided to come see the cat. In my bf’s apartment. At 8 AM.  I said nothing just entered my morning meeting as that were scrambling out of the apartment.

The evening crawled in so slowly as all day we’re been texting about the event and how inappropriate it was that he allowed her to do that without asking me if I was ok with it, if it was or not intruding on my meetings (he insisted I stay over and work from his place that week). If I wanted her there first thing in the morning or not. And I was saying over and over again that we’d talk when he got home from work.

He came home with flowers, sweets, food and a pretty good apology. He realized B overstepped his and my boundaries. He thought he had no choice but to invite her over since she was practically by his door when she called, but realized he CAN say no. He was going to talk with her again.

And I asked him very sincerely, how intimate were or have been? Because he had no problem changing his underwear while I was going to open the front door for her (you can see directly into the bedroom from the entry). And he said never ever has there been something between them. I didn’t believe him, but I made a mental note about it.

 

Bonus event again: A called him randomly two days before we went on vacay, to ask him to a coffee with her. He politely said that she could come over when I was working from home and we can all have coffe together and she said “Ok, we’ll see, we’ll see.”

 

Event Numero 4:

We went on vacation and our accommodations sucked. We had bugs (I hate bugs, I have a phobia). And it was cold, colder than outside. On Valentine’s day (our second day there) we had a fight about it and my perception of his total lack of empathy to my difficulties with the bugs (I didn’t sleep the first night). We also had a talk about communication between us and how he feels I’m not listening to him when he says something because I already made up my mind about the subject so his opinion doesn’t really matter. And he blamed my profession (not going to say what it is, but I listen to a lot of people talk). I pointed out he blamed my profession before, when he feels like I’m too insistent with questions when I was trying to get to know him. He jokingly asked if I have other questions that were left uncovered.

So, I asked him who were his previous sexual partners before me.

That escalated quickly, I know. But I had a theory and I had to test it. I also asked if they are still around, in his close friend groups.

He said yes, they are still around, and it’s A and B.

And about then my vacation ended  in my head and I started asking myself where is this relationship going? If I should ended or no?

Because he lied to me in my face about B, when I asked him a week before when she came over   how intimate were they? Or have been? And he said that NEVER EVER has there been something between them.

He defended himself and said nothing SERIOUS or not a relationship, but they did have sex once, years before and never again. He invited to his place because he knew she was attracted to him and he hadn’t had sex in a very long time. And it happened. Then he has to explain to her 2-3 times that he didn’t want to be with her and that it happened that one time and it was just sex. Over the years, they remained good friends and have a lot of common groups of friends.

With A is different. A is his godmother’s friend and older than up by 5-6 years. They shared a hotel room in December 2024 after the New Year’s Eve and started touching but nothing happened. Then, in January 2024 they had sex while they were both visiting his godmother in another country. Then they decided to continue doing so when they came home.  At some point she said she’s involved in a situationship that might evolve and they can’t continue their friends-with-benefits affair. But they already had plans to go to Bali in March 2024 so they went as friends and nothing happened between them in Bali or ever again. Or so he said.

We started talking more in March 2024.

I was and still am extremely hurt that he lied to me, that he has hidden this to me, that his friends knew about this when we went to that dance event when I first met A – that he never gave me a choice if I ever want to meet either of them.

We had numerous fights over this because I believe it’s obvious from A’s and especially B’s actions that he has unfinished business with both of them. And I feel disrespected and humiliated. Not to mention jealous and uncomfortable.

1jedb3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/RunNYC/comments/1jedb3n/united_half_volunteer_2025/,United Half Volunteer 2025,"This was my first time volunteering for a race and I did so as part of the NYRR 9+1 program. Before volunteering, I fastidiously researched as many anecdotal tips/warnings from other volunteers and didn't find as much as I would have liked on the subject lol. Here's my experience:

  
Race: United Airlines NYC Half Marathon 

When: Sunday, March 16, 2025

Where: 69st and Central Park West

What: Recovery Bag Distribution (basically gave out plastic bags containing Gatorade, water, pretzels, an apple and Maurtens Solid Bar).

Shift durations: 6:30am-12:30PM

WHEN DID I SIGN UP  
I signed up to volunteer the same day I was notified by NYRR I hadn't been accepted to run the race via lottery. There were many slots and shifts available and I figured recovery bag distribution would be fun since I would get to see all the runners after they passed the finish line and were glowing/relieved/thrilled. I will say I thought I was giving checked in items back but this was obviously not the case. 

  
DAY OF PLAY BY PLAY

Arrived promptly at 6:30am to a dark Central Park and was escorted to the volunteer area. There were several groups already clustered together under their respective signs ex. ""Medals"" and ""Thermal Heatsheets"". 

I went through a fairly quick check in process where my QR code was scanned, a lanyard with an ID stating I was a volunteer, I picked up a purple beanie (will try to add a pic but it had  a pompom, UA Half sticker and the word ""volunteer"" in large, gray letters). I also nabbed a poncho because there was rain in the forecast, skipped the tea/coffee/chocolate being offered and grabbed a brown bag with a blueberry muffin in it.

  
I found my group and we went over the NYRR emergency number, how to easily get in/out of Central Park and generally felt like we were killing time before we moved to the bag recovery area. 

  
There were huge boxes stacked two apiece that contained the bags and we first set up the tables in front of the boxes. A NYRR leader then went around with a box cutter and individually opened the top box. We then stacked up our tables with recovery bags and proceeded to wait. 

  
Around 8am the first runners began to reach us and then it was a nonstop rush straight to 12:30pm. I was set up in the middle tables for the first couple of tables dealt with the majority of the runners at first. We had to get creative to get the bags from the boxes, breakdown boxes, ask for NYRR leaders with boxcutters (there were only about 2 and we were a team of 30) to help break down the boxes and grant us access. There was a point where the first few tables ran out of recovery bags and we were then the first responders to folks looking to rehydrate which we had to quickly readjust to the new influx of people. 

  
Most of the shift was spent passing bags to runners and then getting a bunch from the boxes to bring to the tables to then pass out to runners. As I write this I realize how thrilling it sounds....lmaoo.

  
PROS

\-Met some cool runners!!! New Strava followers unlocked!

\-Got to hug people from my run club as they finished which was pretty sweet :)

\-Was thanked by so many incredible runners as they passed us which I wasn't expecting especially when they just accomplished such an amazing feat. Thinking of volunteers after completing 13.1 miles shows such generosity of character and made it so worthwhile.  

\-Having the opportunity to tell people congratulations and what a great job they did. The smiles, warmth, and just overall good vibes were wholesome.

\-SHOUTOUT TO A RUNNER WHO SAW ME AND A VOLUNTEER STRUGGLING TO BREAKDOWN A TABLE AND HE JUST PULLED OVER AND DID IT FOR US BEFORE CONTINUING ON HIS WAY <3

UNEXPECTED MISC

\-Runners asking for specific Gatorade flavors. I started to shout out the colors I happened to have in my hand at any given moment to make it easier for folks. I never ran a race and asked for specific flavors after but I will start to haha. 

\-Had a few runners ask for bagels (we didn't have any, were there bagels at past races maybe?) and one ask for cinnamon rolls to which I replied I wish!! 

\-Like I mentioned above at one point we ran out of recovery bags towards the front because we were allocated two huge boxes per table and understandably as the day went on those front boxes emptied out quickly. There were still PLENTY of bags just a few tables down. One lady started to complain and say it was silly that we didn't have water right as she arrived and we just let her know there were a few bags further down. Runners, when was the last hydration spot during the race? I felt for her because I know 10ft to get to water especially after such a huge effort could be mentally tough. 

  
\-We didn't get to see the pros whomp whomp. Ofc they were whisked off to a VIP section post race but a gal could hope. 

\-After 6 hours standing, I was TIRED. We were asked to stay past our shift time for around 2k runners who were still on the course. In the future, they should stagger the shift time. We spent a full hour and a half standing around waiting for runners at the beginning. They could have had half of us there early and the other half arrive even an hour later and stay for that last batch of runners. 

TLDR;

Volunteering for a NYRR race was so rewarding, very well organized and a lot of fun! ",9,1742325562.0,RunNYC,1,0.91,False

(Part 3),"All week the sun had dissipated behind the same horizon. All week the sun had shone over the same house. All week the sun had illuminated the same, disparate little patch of land. I had waited all week for her to come home; she never did. Failing that, I looked for her. Cast aside was my terror, my guilt and my shame. What was left in its place was a shaky, self-deceptive sense of optimism. Before you lambast me for not looking hard enough, it’s difficult to find something that, by all accounts, never existed.

I’ll say before you go any further, and only if you haven’t already, please read [my first posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1j62uu2/there_was_something_in_the_woods_with_us_that/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). Be warned however that they won’t answer much, I doubt anything can or will.

You know, I still wake some nights and hope to see her in the usual spot at the foot of my bed; that hope is starting to wane. Following my fruitless search, I called my parents to explain to them the situation and according to them we’ve never had a dog. What am I to think? That I’m making this all up?

A few days following this I came to the conclusion that locking myself in my house, leaving all texts, calls and emails on read and browsing dingy internet forums in search of similar experiences simply wouldn’t help. For the first time in what felt like forever, I crept from my room and tried to uphold the basic façade of normalcy. The resonant hum of the kettle filled the house, I had decided making a tea was the best course of action.

Idly I flicked through my mail which had accumulated in a haphazard pile by the front door. It had been all the usual stuff, the odd letter, a magazine and a few cards but what had really caught my eye was a poster. Bold red font at the top had declared ‘MISSING’ and at the bottom was a paragraph vaguely describing a dog. It had been the picture though, that was what really got me. Captured in blurry monochrome was Lyric.

It had made good kindling.

Let me ask you something. Have you ever felt hungry and opened your fridge only to be disappointed as to the contents? Have you ever, following that, slammed the door shut in frustration before pulling it open once again in hope of a new result? Have you ever, after all of that, ever seen the inside of your fridge… change? No. I guarantee you haven’t.

Events, such as those affecting my fridge were becoming more and more common; alarmingly so. The onset had been so minor I feel embarrassed even mentioning it. First, it had been my mysteriously unlocked phone shifting an inch or two as I slept. Then, it had been doors, previously shut, standing wide open when I woke. On a few occasions my car keys, usually thrown into a dish in the kitchen, appeared under my pillow. Now on their own, these incidents may seem harmless; mildly infuriating at most. But within context they’re undeniably… sinister.

By the time I managed to convince myself to leave my home it had been nearly two weeks since Lyric disappeared. Now it was time and for good reason. Two weeks alone is a long time to mull things over. Your mind wanders in that kind of silence and solitude. I had felt strange pangs of nostalgia. Thoughts of that night in the woods all those years ago, and of Josh and Richard, filled my every waking moment. I had missed them I suppose. So, from the deepest recesses of my memory and my old computer, I dug up two emails. To each of them I sent a single message.

Only Josh responded.

What follows is the email I sent him:

***(ME)***

***Hi Josh!***

***I know this is slightly out of the blue but… just how have you been? To be honest I’m sorry I never reached out sooner. I suppose I apologise for my laziness!***

***What have you been up to? I know you mentioned something about getting into your desired college last we spoke so, how’d that turn out?***

***Personally, I got through college and have been doing a Uni course for the last few months, I’m currently renting this shit little farmhouse nearby; it’s not quite Richard’s countryside getaway lol!***

***Anyway, we should really meet up some time, even just to talk. Coffee shop meetup in the old spot? Drop me an email if you fancy it!***

***I’ve really missed you Josh, take care of yourself and I hope to hear from you soon.***

I had barely leaned back in my chair when the computer pinged to signify incoming mail. The response was tantalisingly brief.

***(JOSH)***

***We should meet up; in person I mean. Are you free this coming Tuesday?***

I thought it over for a few minutes and replied to him. We set a time to meet.

During the days that followed, the strange abnormalities in my home worsened in both frequency and scope. Rooms had begun to re-arrange their layouts; after the first few times I gave up putting the furniture back. Screams, shouts, cries, grunts, groans, hums and whistles, seemingly from no source, filled the house more often than not. Then there was the constant clutter. Drawers and cupboards turned inside out; their contents laid bare across the floors in neat, ordered rows. It was the sublimity and perfection of it all that bothered me the most.

The vibrant chirping of the dawn chorus on Tuesday signalled a second full night without sleep. Strangely, in that time, not a thing had stirred within the house. Wearily I pulled myself from the sofa and lurched towards the bathroom in an attempt to tidy myself. I staggered through the door and looked into the mirror; my reflection was alien to me. It was twisted. Skin sagged under my eyes in grotesque purple bags, my face was pinched and gaunt, slick with grease was my hair after days of being unwashed and my eyes… they were so hollow. It took me nearly half an hour to come to terms with the fact that the emaciated husk in the mirror was me.

I showered and threw on some fairly clean clothes. My reflection looked marginally better, enough so I could pass myself off as just REALLY stressed over exams. Not that I’d been to Uni in two weeks, feigning a family emergency to keep the professors off my back.

It was nearly midday by the time I had found my keys (tucked in an old shoe-box under the bed by my mysterious, room arranging ‘guest’). I was exceptionally late. I peeled down the drive in my beat-up Fiesta and nigh on ran every red light on my way into town.

Town was busy and parking sparse. I eventually found a spot leaving me with a ten minute walk to the coffee shop. After a few minutes of walking, I became filled with impending dread, a feeling that I should turn back. Fight or flight? People drifted past me, fading into a constant stream of colour and noise. Thought after thought tore through my mind as I weighed every possible consequence of what I was about to do. The world became hazy. The constant blaring of a car horn ripped me from my waking slumber and I realised I was stood, frozen, in the middle of the road. My heart fought the confines of my chest, pounding in my ears, feeling as though it would spill from my throat. I struggled against the impulse to retch, to gag, to vomit. My vision blurred and spun as the headlights of the oncoming car distorted into blinding strobe lights, its incessant horn blocking out all sanity. I’d winced at the sudden cacophony and my vision had ceased all together. My legs buckled. I drifted into nothing. My head hit the concrete.

I think it was the breeze that woke me. It gently pushed the hair from my throbbing brow behind my ears and caressed my flushed skin. My mind was rendered silent and hushed. My heart was calm and the furious pounding that had, moments earlier, assaulted my ears was replaced by a dull thrum. I was discarded on a bench, in a park, some distance from the road. Gazing upwards, I sat for a minute or two before I stirred. It was the usual dirty English sky; steel grey and cloud-mottled.

I finally reached the coffee shop a few minutes later. In the near decade since I’d last been there it hadn’t changed at all. I was late. I hoped Josh hadn’t left.

He hadn’t.

Much like the dull fluorescent lights and suspiciously sticky seats of the chosen establishment, Josh hadn’t changed a bit. He was older, taller and all that but it was still irrevocably him. He sipped at the steaming cup in his hands; wincing slightly at the hot liquid.

Then he saw me.

“HOLY SHIT!”

His voice trailed off for a few second as he assessed me, head to toe, his eyes lingering on the swelling above my eye.

“How the hell are you? My god you haven’t changed a bit!”

I chuckled softly at his remark before taking the seat opposite him. Settling into the chair I slipped of my jacket, throwing it in a heap on the floor beneath me.

“I could say the same thing about you! I guess I’m fine all things considered; you?”

Looking up at him I was met with a toothy grin, he took another sip of his coffee and sighed one of his usual exaggerated sighs; he was exactly like I’d remembered.

“I, my good friend, am doing wonderful! What are the chances hey? That we end up here again, together! We’re only missing Richard!”

Following his comment he whistled over the nearest waitress, a young woman in her early twenties. Her face had scrunched up into a scowl at his brash nature before she spat out a generic request for his order. My face had been similarly scrunched up in embarrassment. This side of him was entirely new. I had tried to communicate an apology through eye contact as she took my order but I don’t think she noticed.

Josh and I chatted for a little while, getting all sentimental and what not. It had felt good just to talk. As our drinks arrived, he had started on the subject of life after college.

“Yeah so, following failing all of my courses I got a small job in town. It pays pretty well but it’s no career. Still working on that, hah.”

Josh had reclined into his chair and gazed out of the misty glass to the street. He’d looked kind of dejected for a moment and I decided to interject to keep spirits high.

“Richard though? You hear from him after high-school? Cause I certainly didn’t, completely ignored any attempt from me to keep contact”

My words hung in the fresh silence for a moment or two before Josh responded.

“Yeah… he did the same to me! You reckon he still lives with his parents? At the farmhouse I mean.”

That had been a good point indeed. I’d never actually attempted to visit him.

“Okay… okay. You reckon we should pay him a visit? I sent the both of you an email and well, it was only you who responded. Which means he either ignored me or well… that isn’t his email anymore!”

I took a sip of coffee. It was far too hot to drink and I spat and sputtered the mouthful down my coat; much to Josh’s amusement. He’d taken a sip of his own coffee before responding.

“Do you know what? I think we should! It’s about time we all had a reunion, been far too long!”

Nodding at his words I placed my mug back on the table and gingerly prodded at my teeth with my burnt tongue. Finally, I spoke.

“If we can’t reunite as a three, we’ll have to make do between the two of us! You know I mentioned I’m renting? Would you be… interested in coming over sometime?”

He nodded curtly and summoned the young waitress over again, motioning that he needed a pen. We’d each scribbled our details on a napkin before he returned the pen, wrapping it in another napkin as he did so. Slipping my address and phone number across the table to him I asked.

“Why didn’t we just use our phones?”

Chuckling and gesturing to the waitress he responded.

“Well… I Wanted to give her my number!”

I rolled my eyes and we continued chatting for a few minutes more. As he reached the dregs of his coffee, Josh spat what was left back into the mug. Grimacing and wiping the grounds from his lips, he set the cup on the tray, taking one last look at the white porcelain. Abruptly he froze, gaze meeting mine, eyes almost bulging from their sockets, the suddenly pallid skin of his face taut. He stood up, yanked his coat from its place on the back of the chair and left.

I sat there stunned, confused. The bell above the door chimed vigorously as it slammed behind him. The drama of Josh’s exit had caused everybody in the café to turn and face me; expressions pointed in accusation. I continued to slump in my chair, deathly silent. My fingers gripped the edge of the table, knuckles white from exertion. I wrestled back control, grabbed my coat from the floor and stood to leave. As I did so, my eyes fell on Josh’s empty coffee mug. Beneath the slop of Josh’s dregs and scratched into the bottom… were two tallies.

Wallet pulled from my pocket; I thrust a few crumpled ten-pound notes into the startled waitress’ hands and stormed out. Down the street I ran; I made it back to the car in just under three minutes. Throwing my coat and myself inside I, with shaking hands, tried and failed to get the key into the ignition; the drive home was silent.

As I pulled up the long, interminable drive to my home, I paused for a moment and audibly asked myself.

“Am I really about to do this?”

I don’t know why but I genuinely thought meeting with Josh would fix things? That he would declare he had experienced what I had and would give me the magic cure! Instead, it would seem I was only partially correct.

I met sleep the instant my head hit the pillow that night. When I eventually woke to the gentle vibrating of my phone upon the nightstand, I’d laid there for an indeterminable amount of time. In lucid flashes, the previous day’s events returned to me as I remained immobile and meticulously tucked into bed. Exhaling, I threw off the covers and answered whomever was calling.

“Hello? Who is this?”

There was brief silence before a muffled voice responded.

“Hiya… This is Rachel”

Her name rang absolutely no bells for me and I told her so. Pausing again for a brief moment, she continued.

“I’m Josh’s mother? Don’t you remember me? Anyway… I hate to bother you this late but Josh never came home tonight? He said he’d gone to meet you…”

Coughing nervously, I tried to articulate a response.

“Yeah! We met at that little coffee shop in town? Now that I think of it, he… did leave in a bit of a hurry. I tried calling him but… he never answered”

There was no sense in lying to her.

“Oh… Okay then. Well, if you don’t know anything else I’ll have to keep asking around. Thank you for your time”

The call went dead.

My mind raced as I pondered where he was. Had he done something stupid? Had he gotten into an accident? Was he hurt… dead?

I dragged myself down the frigid stairs; the house was deathly cold. Grimacing as the hardwood pinched at my bare feet I stumbled into the kitchen, rubbing the sleep from my eyes. Soon acclimating to the darkness, I ran myself a water to soothe the pounding in my head. I’d taken a few sips and held the cool glass to my bruised brow before letting out a sigh; then something sighed back.

He stared at me through the agape window.

“Josh? What the fuck are you doing?”

Liquid, amidst shattered glass, began to pool around my feet; he did not react. Edging my way towards the door I shouted again.

“Hey man… This isn’t funny…”

Desperately fumbling with the light-switch I caught his gaze; its gaze. That thing wasn’t Josh… it simply couldn’t have been. Eyes, or lack thereof, bore into me; no more than bottomless pits chiselled into its emaciated visage. 

“G-get the… the fuck off my property!”

My quivering voice betrayed any semblance of confidence and it knew it. Head far too heavy upon its neck, it twitched and jerked to keep ‘eye contact’ with me. I should have run, screamed, thrown something, died on the spot and yet I stood there like an idiot, utterly transfixed. The more I gazed upon its shifting form the more and more I saw. Pushing through its skin, writhing against its mortal confines, spilling through the seams. From the bunched and bloody mess outstretched a single wiry appendage. It had too many fingers, too many elbows, too much of everything. Shifting and readjusting and with infinitely tender care it pushed the window shut.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

They came against the glass in soft raps; it was an all too familiar sound. Through the window I heard it, cracking and popping, muscles tearing and reforming. Its breath was hot against the window, fogging up the pane. Then it spoke. It had been a poor attempt at a human voice, monotone, static, utterly devoid of life.

“You have to let me in… You have to let me in… You have to let me in…”

Broken glass crunched underfoot as I forced myself to MOVE, shambling against the doorframe in the process. Behind me, angular fingers pressed into the condensation, as if reaching out in pursuit. Into the pane they etched… a single tally.

“Help… Help… You have to help me…”

Thundering up the stairs I ignored its now incessant cries.

“Why are you leaving me? Why are you leaving me? Help…”

Limping into the bathroom, swearing amidst trying to pull shards of glass from my feet, I collapsed against the wall. Writhing and gasping for air on the floor I fought to regain control, to focus my eyes and to soothe my head; just to breathe.

“It’s me… Josh… Josh… Josh… You have to let me in…”

Clasping both hands over my mouth, muffling my whimpering, I strained to hear it.

“Where are you? Where are you… Where are you!”

Now pounding against the kitchen window, its words rendered no more than a series of low guttural strains and screams. Crying out in response and pulling myself to my feet I threw open the bathroom door and with what strength I had left, screamed:

“I’ll kill you!”

That was all I could think to say.

Like a blown-out speaker it spluttered and silenced. I could hear its hand scrape down the window as it pulled away, like nails on a chalk-board. Slumped against the doorframe, I let out quiet revelries. It was gone, for a few moments at the least. The silence was euphoric and I couldn’t help but cry. Hot tears stung in the corners of my eyes; I hadn’t bothered to wipe them because there came a knocking on the bathroom window.

Knock. Knock. Knock.

It spoke softly, like a mother consoling a child. Three little words… in my voice.

“I’ll kill you…”

One. Two. Three. Four… I counted each second as it passed, each an eternity of its own. Idly I sat, crumpled in a twisted heap upon the wooden floor, scratching. For hours I’d scratched. I’d scratched till my nails were gone and my fingertips were raw; Deep and deeper still into the wood. Anything to fill the silence. Anything to escape from… it. Etched over and over again, deeper and deeper into the floor, was a single… tally.

Today the sun rose over the horizon, its feeble efforts to dispel my unease are… appreciated. I’m on my back, entombed in grass. Cloudless blue skies stretch far above me, it’s a pleasant change to the dreary, grey expanses of the last few days. Trees rock in the breeze, calmly and gently; everything is right with the world. All this time has given me a great chance to ponder things. The tallies for example. Swaying softly in the wind is that tree, a single tally etched into its bark. First it was three. Then it was two. Now it’s one.

I know why Richard never answered my emails and why Josh won’t respond to my calls. They’re both dead and soon… I will be too.",2,1742325510.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I am curious on anyone's subject matter expertise on this.

I currently have an older model Jura (Impressa F9) had it for over 15 years and its needed repair once or twice and now it will need it again, not sure on the cost could be as low as 150 to 200 or even more depending on whats going on inside, needless to say we have gotten the value out of it if we needed to give up on it. 

I was looking at the Breville machines which seem to be popular but was wondering if I would like making the switch? The Jura is automatic which I get so is the extra effort with the Breville touch produce better coffee? I'm willing to consider it if people think its a better machine than the Jura. Also is the Jura essentially just making an Americano?

1jed8ah,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semenretention/comments/1jed8ah/relief_from_major_depression_through_sr/,Relief from major depression through SR,"Just wanted to quickly share my experience and show gratitude to the community. I figured out the biggest cause of my major depression was caused by frequent releasing. By frequent I mean once or twice a week, or even once every two weeks. For many years I dealt with depression in varying degrees during late adolescent years, and now adulthood, which I self medicated with stimulants like caffeine or nicotine. They mostly worked, but I was experiencing joy in kind of synthetic ways, and stimulants come with comedowns, side effects, dependency, and withdrawals. It got exhausting.

Before SR, I had what you call high functioning major depression (I got diagnosed but refused meds). I got things done, always kept a job, looked healthy on the outside, but I seriously lacked any joy in what I did, and I needed to be on a stimulant to temporarily feel ""something."" I had lost interest in prior passions like playing music, practicing martial arts, going out with friends, and etc. A lot of times I was on autopilot, and during leisure times, I'd often be stuck playing video games trying to experience what little bit of pleasure juice remained in my head. Being in a relationship didn't help either, especially because I had the tendency to attract narcissistic people due to my traits aligning with their perfect preys. Most of them also didn't like that I practiced SR (I knew the longer I went, the better I felt), so the longest I went without releasing was a week at most.

Fast forward to realizing that SR works, but only after 14-15 days of it and keeping it clean (and it gets better for another 15+ days or so). Realizing this was HUGE. It's like I am once again sensitized and I can enjoy things. Coffee hits me like never before, I feel in tune with the music that I play and write, going out with friends and family feel exciting and bonding, drinking alcohol makes me blissed out (only drinking on rare occasions), and I appreciate the beauty in many things in the world, including beautiful ladies.

If I had not discovered this, I probably would've been either dead, medicated, or just continued waiting it out. Thank you, thank you, and thank you.",4,1742325382.0,Semenretention,0,1.0,False

1jed2et,https://www.reddit.com/r/movingtojapan/comments/1jed2et/am_i_romanticising_tokyo/,Am I romanticising Tokyo?,"I’m looking for advice on whether I should study for a few months, stay for 3 months (tourist visa max), or do a working holiday because I don’t know if I am romanticising Japan based on my background. 

About me:

I’ve wanted to live in Tokyo since I was 12. I’m in my 20s now. I have a bachelor’s and I did Japanese as a minor. I was able to speak in Japanese with staff when I went for a holiday. I also speak small conversations in Japanese at my workplace and my Japanese friend here. Anyhow, I will be studying Japanese in Japan if I do decide that.

I’m Asian, grew up a few years in Singapore but majority in Australia. 

Some countries I considered (why I chose Japan):

	•	I live in a small city in Australia. I’ve always longed to live in a big city/country that was always busy and had so many things to do. 

	•	I considered going back to Singapore, but I’m worried I might get bored since it’s a small country even though it is still bigger than where I live now. But I love Singapore. 

	•	I also considered New York, but shootings terrify me and also it’s pretty dirty and unsafe. 

	•	I also considered Thailand and Philippines, but I don’t know Thai (yet?) and public transport is bad in the Philippines. Also I don’t know about safety in those 2 countries. 

	•	I thought Japan would be the best place to try living for the first time by myself. I would definitely try out all the other countries I mentioned after living in Japan. 

	•	I don’t want to live in Europe at the moment for various reasons (I heard some countries are also nice and safe).


Why I want to move to Tokyo:

	•	Lifestyle. I want to live in a big city and don’t care at all about nature and outdoors. I want a fast paced city, crowds, lots of events, amusement parks, consumerism, ‘aestheticness’ for taking photos, materialism. I don’t want to be ‘relaxed and smell the fresh air’ if that makes sense. I want something to do everyday. I want to be able to go somewhere after 5 (in Australia places are closed and everyone just goes home after 5). I’ve read that some people describe Singapore as ‘cold’ but I absolutely love that sort of society. I love that everyone minds their own business and no one is loud on public transport or outside. I don’t have to make small talk when talking to staff. All of that are opposite in Australia. I feel unsafe here after 5 (actually any time I’m in the CBD). That’s why I never liked it here and preferred Singapore (parents moved to Australia when I was little). I thought it would change once I grew up but nope. I still want that kind of busy lifestyle in Asia. And if I get sick of it, I can easily visit other parts of Japan if I ever want some relaxing time.

	•	My personality and values. As an Asian who grew up majority in Australia but spent childhood in Singapore, I don’t know why I still hold Asian values and attitudes. I’m not ‘whitewashed’. I tried though. My personality, taste buds, attitude are so Asian and I always had to fake (and still do) what I liked here in Australia to be able to fit in.  For example, latest trends, pop culture, choices in fashion, makeup, hair, which celebrities, songs, guys I liked (people made fun of you if you liked Asian things so I always tried to make myself act and look Western). Every time I go back to Singapore or travel to other Asian countries, I feel at home. The people around me look like me, their personality similar to mine, their fashion choices and interests are similar too. I feel like I don’t have to constantly fake every aspect of me. I don’t have to make small talk. I can just ‘ignore’ people and go on about my day (ie I don’t have to smile and greet staff at a coffee shop or at the street and engage in small talk).

	•	I want to make friends (don’t care if they are Japanese or not) and that’s a reason why I want to study for a few months in Japan as opposed to doing a working holiday. I lost all my friends after graduating high school and it’s hard to make friends here because I live in a small city with nothing going on (seriously nothing). Even if I did have friends, there would genuinely be nothing interesting to do. Like I said, all the things I’m interested in are in Asia so that’s why I go to Singapore for a holiday pretty often. I want to experience my 20s going to events, parties, bars, having night outs, endless shopping, being out till late. All of that is not possible here. People just go home after work or visit the same bars. There are like 2 clubs here. Everyone is a mutual friend of someone. So many businesses are closing down recently. The CBD is dead. There is only one ‘big’ shopping centre (‘big’ for Australian standards. It only has one floor and like 5 restaurants. I am sick of this shopping centre.)

	•	I don’t have any plans to settle in Japan at the moment nor work a professional job there because my dream is to travel and live in different countries after living in Japan for less than a year.  I want to study for 6 months only. Otherwise, visit and ‘live’ for 3 months (the max of a tourist visa). Or, get a working holiday (I will mainly holiday and only work small jobs if I run out of money). I just want to see if I really do like this kind of fast paced lifestyle. I don’t need advice about staying for the long term.

	•	I visited Osaka and Tokyo. I prefer Tokyo. I think Osaka is still small for me. Is this correct? Or are they about the same size and I didn’t go around Osaka long enough?

       •     I heard Osaka people are friendlier? But what exactly does this mean? Examples? As I explained before, I am used to the ‘coldness’ that is in Asian culture.

	•	Money is not an issue for now.

	•	Am I speaking with rose tinted glasses?



Why I’m hesitating:


- Most things I see on reddit, Tiktok and Youtube always have people complaining about Japan. Their reasons are because the Japanese are ‘two faced’, ‘fake’ and won’t consider you as ‘Japanese’ even though you’ve been there for a while or are fluent etc. I don’t care at all about that. I don’t need them to accept me fully because I am not Japanese. I don’t know why people complain about that. Isn’t it the same for other homogenous countries? Thailand? Korea? Vietnam? And this ‘fakeness’ thing - isn’t that normal? In front of friends you don’t really show your authentic self to them. At work you don’t either. You always have a different personality for everyone. Even with family it’s probably only 95%. Isn’t fake politeness a good thing? We all do it. That’s what I think but please expand on this because I might be missing something because people always complain about those stuff.

- A lot of people say Japanese people won’t really include you in their group. What exactly does this mean? Again I don’t really care if I make Japanese friends or not. But a lot people complain about this.

- Is it really as safe as people claim it to be? I know in Japan there’s this whole patriarchy thing (I know all about this stuff as an Asian so I don’t want to get in detail) so it makes me worried as a woman (actually I almost got mugged during my trip but I pushed him away and he quickly ran away). Who will I go to if anything happens? The Japanese police will not help. Consulate? I walked in Kabukicho at night and Shibuya and it did seem kinda sketchy past 10pm. Any common occurrences there?

- I heard apartments are hard to get for foreigners because they want long term residents. I only want to stay for 6 months to a year. 

- I also heard it is hard to open a bank account, find an apartment and get a phone number because it’s a snowball effect of needing A but you need B to get A but you can’t get B without A sort of thing. But isn’t it the same for a lot of countries and not Japan specific?

Thanks.

1jed19v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jed19v,Jumby Bay Island Review,"Earlier this year my spouse and I had an amazing stay at Jumby Bay Island, Antigua.

We booked a Pool Suite through u/alex_travels. Prior to booking, we researched the rooms ourselves, but Alex recommended the Pool Suite versus the Beachside Suite.

At check-in, we were told we were upgraded to a 2 bed / 2 1/2 bath ocean view suite - a fantastic upgrade - thanks Alex!! The upgrade (and welcome snacks) was a very pleasant surprise and much appreciated. The suite had a large private pool and was very spacious, with a kitchen and great room area separating the bedrooms, the main one with a king bed and an outdoor shower, the other with two queens. The suite was bright and well appointed. It was about a 2-3 minute walk down to the main hub of the resort.

Note that you are required to pay in full for your stay (room rate + 17% tax + 10% service charge) before arrival - half the total was due at booking and the balance two weeks prior to arrival.

The resort is all-inclusive - the room rate and service charge covers everything except for a few special items such as private dinners, the spa, some excursions, premium wine, but pretty much all of the day to day meals and drinks at the restaurants, bars and beach, most water sports (snorkeling trip, water skiing, etc.), and one-offs such as wine or rum tasting and pop-up dinners are included. We were not presented with anything to sign (except once due to a mix-up, as well as at the boutique). They do ask for your room number or name at meals or bars or water sports. At check-out, you can request a form on which you can add additional tips for individuals or for teams (e.g., housekeeping) if you wish. They do not present this form to you - you have to ask for it.

Arrival The resort provides fast-track arrival service at VC Bird airport. A guide walks you through each step, and immigration and customs were very quick. The resort provides transportation from the airport to the resort's ferry dock (a 5-minute ride), and the ferry ride takes less than 10 minutes to reach Jumby Bay Island. (When you land, be sure to fill out one immigration form per person, not one per family, despite American Airlines' insistence to the contrary - there were 15-20 couples/families filling out additional forms in the airport before immigration.) Departure also features a fast-track service at the airport - a representative leads you through immigration and takes you to near the front of the security screening line - very efficient.

Property The 300-acre island about a mile and a half off of the main island of Antigua contains the resort as well as about sixty privately-owned villas. Each room comes with bicycles, and it is an easy ride around the island.

The central hub of the resort includes the Veranda bar and restaurant (where breakfast is served), the main beach, the water sports area, concierge, boutique, tennis court and lap pool. There are infinity pools as well. One pool is right off the central part of the beach and has some shade, while the other is at the Sand Bar restaurant at the north end of the beach. That pool had more direct sunlight. The beach itself is right off the Veranda restaurant, and the water sports area is very near as well. The water at the beach is very calm. There were always beach chairs available during our stay.

The gym was small but had a good variety of TechnoGym equipment and free weights. We did not use the spa.

Meals With the all-inclusive, you can choose from several restaurants - Veranda, Sand Bar, the fancier Estate House, food and drinks at the beach, as well as several ""pop-ups"" that happen weekly. The West Indian Hangout is a buffet at the Veranda (Wednesday nights when we were there), the White Night dinner on the beach (Sundays), and the Farm to Table meal (Fridays). At the time of our stay, some of the restaurants were closed on certain days, but there were always several options each night. Room service is available - I think there is a delivery charge for that - we didn't do it. The menus had a lot of variety, and the food was generally very good. We were there for the West Indian Hangout on consecutive Wednesdays, and I was impressed that the menu was different on the two occasions. The overall concept and structure of the menus were the same, but pretty much no item was repeated on the two nights (possibly excepting bread, some salads, maybe some basic dessert items like ice cream).

For breakfast at the Veranda, you can order a la carte off a menu or go to the buffet. The buffet had a rotating choice of about six or seven hot items, as well as a meat and cheese area, usual pastries, breads, yogurts, fruits and juices. Most items were fine, although the fruits were limited to what you'd typically see in the US, and one day the blueberries weren't good.

Service Service was very friendly and efficient everywhere - at restaurants, beach setup and food and drinks, housekeeping, water sports, the ferry. Everyone was well-trained, professional and seemed to enjoy their jobs. There were a few very minor misses, for example, a little slow getting coffee several mornings, courses took a long time to come out at one dinner, but it was obvious that service was a priority. One example: I signed up for the weekly wine tasting event, but when I went to it, it had been cancelled. Over the next several days, multiple members of the concierge team reached out to me in person and by phone to apologize and to find a time to reschedule. (I would highly recommend the wine tasting if that's your thing - fun and educational.) I felt the concierge team was really proactive - aware of our schedule and what follow-ups might be needed. If we had a day with no dinner reservations they would reach out to us to make them.

Tide to Table Jumby Bay offered a ""Tide to Table"" activity for booking on Black Friday last November. Alex set us up with this, even though we had booked well before Black Friday. Tide to Table involved a four-hour ocean fishing expedition for us, a cooking demonstration using one of the fish we caught, and then a private dinner on the beach again using the fish we caught. This was a fun and unique day, but it is probably best suited for people who are really excited about the fishing excursion portion of the day. For this day I did have the sense that the communication and coordination among the staff and with us was sometimes lacking. It combined activities that normally wouldn't be packaged together, so it sometimes felt that there was uncertainty between the teams running each activity as to what we needed to do (e.g., how many fish should we bring back from the trip?) But everything did come together well.

I would highly recommend Jumby Bay for a relaxing stay with great rooms, food, service, beach, pools and activities, and the room upgrade made it even better. It seems like a good place for families with children - a relatively small number of families had children during our stay, perhaps not surprising given the time of year.",2,1742324921.0,chubbytravel,3,0.75,False

And recently joined reddit to explore. 

So usually i exchange pics with female clients and once they like me, we go ahead with the services. But this time she needed a instant service so she spoke to me over call and mentioned she needed a full body erotic massage and if things goes well we can go ahead with happy ending and I didn't ask for pics because of last mins service call and she seems decent so I agreed to come at the very last moment. 

We discussed the price and she shared the location. When I Reached at the location she opened the door and we both were shocked to see each other although in office we never spoke to each other as she's placed in a very Higher position.

I reached and she Opened the door and the second moment I said, Sorry Mam, She also felt awkward..but she asked me to calm down and said not be worry and invited me and then asked me about it that why I'm doing this as you've a high paying job, so I replied I'm doing it for fun and to meet with decent mature ladies..Then slowly she made me feel comfortable and I wasn't mentally prepared to serve her so she said it's okay.. I'll keep your secret and if you aren't comfortable you can leave and we will meet at office on Monday now...

On Monday, I was so embarrassed and she was just looking at me and smiling and then she asked my manager something and my manager said to me that I've to talk to HR Head. 

Than I went to her cabin and she said, Just wanted to talk to you from Employee prospective but Whatever happened between you and me, so need to talk outside and I would like to meet you after office. I said Okay mam. So she said, meet me at Cyberhub starbucks after office.

After 6, I packed my stuffs and visited to starbucks and ordered a coffee and started waiting for my HR Head, So se came after 30 mins. She came and said"" Sorry to keep you waiting.

Then she started talking,

She:  so Just wanted to ask, why you are doing this masseur thing as you have a high paying job, is this some kind of money issue or you just doing it for having fun.

Me : mam, I started it after my breakup and after that I loved it to serve women and adore her body, so ya now I'm doing it for fun. 

She: Okay but it's not good from the employee prospective as if you are doing this, you are not a good employee for our company.

Me: Mam, I do it after my office hours and not professionally. Also I'm really sorry about what happened, I'll also make sure then everything will be safe and private but Please whatever you see, don't make it serious. If you need something from me to fix that, I'll do it whatever you say.

She: Okay, well I'm not threatening you..just informing you as an HR. But still I need a favour from you. Now we both know the little secret of each other. I know about your secret work, and you know about my wild needs. So if you're comfortable we can meet at my place tomorrow. Because I was feeling afraid earlier as how that masseur will be, he might be a sex creep but  now I'm more comfortable as I know about you..

Me: Mam, is this necessary? As it'll be good for us?

She: what bad will it be? And I guess if I'm doing a favour for you..So atleast I deserve this.

Me: okay mam, I'll be there tomorrow.

Then we left after few mins. At night she pinged me..that come with a prepration. Properly shaved and a good perfume.

Next day, I took the sick leave, so she pinged me hope you are coming tonight. So I replied yes mam. I'll be there.

3. He texted me on WhatsApp (I shared my public number; not the private one); For better co-ordination to meet and stuff 
4. Turns out he made a group where there were other people coming as well, I was like okay as I thought it's one-one anyways

Fast forward on 18th March, he texted on the group saying that there's some family issues and because of that he was going to cancel and I was like okay cool. One hour later, he left the group deleted all his and my messages that he felt like was mentioning anything and blocked not only me but other people as well.

We've now got rid of the 30 year old carpet and also painted 3 walls dark grey. 

Our next steps are: finish the skirting boards, new rug and coffee table (something less bulky), art / canvas behind the sofa, curtains, and shelves in the alcove. 

I was initially set on swapping the grey TV unit for a lower console but quite like the contrast to the dark grey now. I could upcycle the unit: new paint, new feet. What to you think?

We also still need some colour in here. Burnt orange soft furnishings? Or dark and rich greens or blues?

Your new neighbor waves from across the street. He’s your height, your build. The same sense of style. The same posture.

You wave back.

Your phone buzzes.

NEW MATCH ON TINDER!

Her name is Isabel.

It starts to rain. The rain falls in straight lines.

Inside, the walls smell like mothballs and mold. The welcome mat says “GO AWAY!” in Comic Sans. You leave it there.

Three days later, you’re taking out the trash. Old pizza boxes, empty beer bottles, a dead rat. Across the street, he’s doing the same. You nod. He nods back.

His beard is your beard, only better groomed. His wrinkles are your wrinkles, only deeper.

""Twins,"" you murmur. He doesn’t hear. Or he does.

The bathroom mirror is cracked, but you see enough: the same unkempt beard, the same dark circles under your eyes, the same cheap towel hanging on the shower rod. The one with the embroidered ducks.

Your laptop is open on the toilet lid. The screen says ""Page 1"" in blank white. The cursor blinks.

On impulse, you shave your head. A challenge to yourself. The clippers buzz like a dying wasp. You dump the hair into the toilet and flush twice. It doesn’t go down.

The next morning, he’s on his porch, sipping coffee from a mug that reads “I ❤️ MY UNRESOLVED TRAUMAS.” He shaved his head too. His scalp gleams in the sunlight.

He has the same pink scar above his left ear.

You touch yours. It’s still there.

“Morning,” he says.

You say nothing. The symmetry feels too violent.

Her name is Isabel. Her teeth are perfect. Too perfect. Too white. Unreal.

She has a Bugs Bunny tattoo on her left shoulder.

You take her to a diner. She orders cherry pie. You hate cherries. You eat it anyway.

When you kiss her, her tongue tastes like Marlboro Reds.

The thrift store jacket is a steal. High-quality velvet, elbow patches, a cigarette burn on the cuff.

You wear it to the bar.

He’s there, sipping whiskey. Wearing the same jacket. The same cigarette burn.

""Coincidence,"" you tell the bartender.

The bartender ignores you. He wipes a glass with his tie. The tie is patterned. Ugly. Familiar.

You’ve worn that tie.

You’re wearing that tie.

""What’ll it be?"" he asks. His pupils are tiny.

""You tell me.""

He pours whiskey into a mug that says “WORLD’S BEST DAD.” The ice cubes are shaped like typewriter keys. You swallow one. It clicks in your throat.

Your neighbor sits beside you. He smells like your apartment. Mold and mothballs. He wipes his mouth with the duck towel.

""Don’t do it,"" he says.

""Do what?""

""Start the story. Again."" He nods toward your laptop bag. ""We’ve done this. I write you. You write me. We end up at the diner. Again. With the pie. Again. With the—""

""The dog that isn’t there,"" you say.

""I think he should be.""

A fly lands in your drink. It drowns. You count its legs. Six. Always six. No surprises there.

Your neighbor leans in. His breath smells like yours. ""This time, skip the metaphor. Skip the fucking… symmetry.""

You open your laptop. The cursor blinks.

He grips your wrist. His wedding band has left a mark. The same as yours.

""Please.""

You type:

“The neighbor sits across from you at the diner, pouring milk into his coffee, stirring it with a plastic straw.”

He’s dating someone, too.

You know because you see them through his kitchen window. She looks like Isabel. Same shoulder-length red hair. Same too-perfect teeth. Same Bugs Bunny tattoo.

She’s drinking from the “I ❤️ MY UNRESOLVED TRAUMAS” mug.

They start slow-dancing to Bill Withers.

You burn the jacket in the driveway.

He’s already there, feeding an identical jacket to the flames. The smoke forms a duck.

""I’m tired. I want to leave,"" you say.

""No point. We tried that. Draft #7. We moved to the coast. Bought matching pool floats. She left us for a guy who looked like her dad.""

You take a deep breath. ""How many times have we had this conversation?""

He pokes the fire and grins. His teeth are your teeth. Yellowed, with the left canine chipped from that time you tried to open a beer bottle with your mouth.

Isabel leaves. She dumps you for a guy who looks like your therapist.

She leaves behind a single note, tucked under the “GO AWAY!” mat:

“You were better as a concept.”

Your neighbor knocks. He’s holding two beers and a notebook.

Inside, every page is a carbon copy of your life. The failures, the coffee stains, the same rehearsed apologies, never spoken.

""Got any ideas?"" he asks.

You take a sip of beer, grab your laptop. ""I have one. Open to page 32.""

He scrolls the mouse wheel slowly. It’s raining.

He starts reading out loud.

The rain falls in straight lines.

Your neighbor sits across from you at the diner, pouring milk into his coffee, stirring it with a plastic straw.

He’s wearing your shirt. The one with the mustard stain on the collar, shaped like Italy.

You know because you’re wearing it too.

""This isn’t working,"" he says.

The waitress refills your mug. Her name tag says ""Isabel,"" but the ""bel"" is slightly faded.

Her eyes are lifeless, flat, like someone photocopied a face.

You want to ask how it feels to be a secondary character.

Instead, you say: ""What isn’t working?""

He taps his forehead. A vein throbs there, just like yours. ""The story. It’s redundant. Stupid. We’re just two depressing clichés running in circles.""

Outside, the rain falls in straight lines. A man walks a leash with nothing attached.

The dog isn’t there.

You’ve seen this before.

The dog is a metaphor for your father.

Or capitalism.

You can’t remember.

""You’re not real,"" you say.

He laughs. A sad laugh. ""Neither are you. I wrote you last Tuesday. Or maybe you wrote me. Who gives a shit.""

His hands shake. So do yours.

Symmetry, you think. That was the word your ex used in your last argument before she left.

He pulls out a notebook. The pages are stained with coffee rings. ""Look,"" he says, flipping to a scene where you’re both hunched over a typewriter, hammering out the phrase ""The rain falls in straight lines"" until the keys jam.

""This isn’t art. It’s a panic attack.""

A loose page flutters to the floor, drifting like a dying leaf. You pick it up.

Page 23: They argue whether the smell of mothballs is a metaphor for entropy or just poor housekeeping.

The waitress brings cherry pie. You hate cherries. So does he.

You both eat it anyway.

""We need a challenge. Risks. A tumor. A fistfight. You should fuck my girlfriend.""

""She looks like my girlfriend.""

""She is your girlfriend.""

You lean in. ""I could write a happy ending.""

He smiles, showing the chipped canine.

""We tried that. Draft #2. You hanged yourself with a belt. I woke up the next day and did the same. Felt like a Nine Inch Nails lyric.""

The pie tastes like ashes.

You don’t know who he is.

You don’t know who you are.

He rips out a page and crumples it. ""Do you know what a palimpsest is?""

You take the notebook. Borrow a pen from Isabel. Start writing.

You wake up in the back of a moving truck, slumped against a cardboard box labeled ""FRAGILE: SELF-CONFIDENCE.""

Your new neighbor waves.

Your phone buzzes.

I’m 26 and the eastern US. Just like everyone else, I’m looking to meet some new people! Ideally someone who can hold a real conversation and wants to form a genuine connection :)

I like to think that I’m easygoing and talkative (especially if I click with someone!). I tend to be a glass half full kinda girl. Unless it’s coffee, then it’s half empty, and I absolutelyyyy need a refill. I love deep conversations and I crave having them. It’s been far too long! 

When it comes to hobbies/interests, I have lots and I’m always willing to learn about something new!I’m into urban exploring and road trips. If it involves discovering new places, I’m in! I also love genealogy, researching history, watching sports (mostly football and hockey), and spending time in the great outdoors. 

When I’m home (I will admit I’m a homebody most of the time), I’m usually wrapped up in a book or watching a movie/TV. I do enjoy houseplants and attempting to keep them alive as well lol. Baking is also fun, but I’m by no means an expert. I like some video games, but I haven’t played any in a hot minute. But I always have fun watching others play!

Anyways, if any of this resonates with you, please reach out! I’d love to get to know you! Either way, have a wonderful day/night! :)",5,1742324344.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

However, after a lot of reasearch, knowledge improvement and assements from day to day evolution, at 30 years old with a very advanced case that drives me crazy I can tell you what is the key to avoid floaters. 

First and foremost, DEHYDRATION. I have been dehydrated all my life, and what made me figure this whole thing out are the additions i brought to increase my Dehydration. 

First I was not drinking enough water which would cause me headaches. Afterwards, I started drinking coffee, smoking cannabis and cigarettes and drink alcohol. Coffee dehydrates you as does smoking and drinking.

I figured that dehydration greatly affected my eye floaters because when I would binge drink in my 29s and wake up in the middle of the night with huge headaches due to dehydraiton and afterwards in the morning still very dryed (eyes and body with dark piss) I would noticed new floaters member of my vision for life. 

  
DRINK WATER ALWAYS, don't drink too much coffee, smoke if you want but make sure you always drink water. If you drink, Drink water before, during and afterwards. 

I am telling you Dehydration is the culprit and makes your vitreous shrink. 

It is too late for me, but hopefully someone sees my post and changes his habits. 

PS: If you are gluten sensitiv, avoid gluten at all costs because it causes inflammation in your body that can make you lack important nutrients or even cause uveitis. I am GLUTEN SENSITIV since I am 27, but it could have been way before onk a smaller scale.

When I finally finished it, I doze off-- and since it was a sunday I had to prepare going to church at 8am, and boy, I got up to prep when I told my roommates Imma head back to the bed for a while because I felt dizzy all of the sudden, and when I tried to open my eyes, my vision started to blacken.

Our first date was just a casual coffee date, but we ended up spending hours together, walked around town and got lunch together. The following dates went similarly. We had amazing conversation, and when we first kissed at the end of the second date, it felt absolutely electric.

We met online, of course, and both of our profiles indicated that we were looking for LTRs. So at the end of our most recent date, I told her that I liked her a lot and wanted to move toward something serious, but that we could take it at her pace. She, in turn, asked if I wanted to go ahead and make things official right then and there, so I excitedly agreed.

We set up plans to see each other the next weekend and said goodnight. She texted me that she made it home safe that night, and then I just never heard from her again. I texted her twice throughout the week and got no response. When the day of our planned date arrived, I tried calling her since she'd been radio silent. No answer. I sent a follow-up text telling her that it was okay if she'd changed her mind, but I wanted to at least know that she was okay. Nothing.

It really blindsided me. She talked during our dates about how she really wanted open and honest communication in a relationship. During our most recent (read: final) date, she initiated a lot of physical contact (holding hands, touching my back, etc).

So the first instance was I was cooking for us and she just yells at me and storms off to the bed room. I first thought maybe she was just talking loudly she is filipino but when I went to check on her she starts crying and refuses to talk to me. Always blaming it on “tampo” or her period. Tampo is like “sulking, pouting, or withdrawing affection due to hurt feelings” it happens but I usually just give her space and everything is okay. I moved across the country to get rid of that environment because my family would always fight. I thought I wouldn’t put my self in a position to have to experience anything like that again. Yesterday I was making dinner because she was not feeling well and I under cooked the carrots. She suggested we use the air fryer to finish them I agree but she proceeded to ask me how long and what temperature. I told her I didn’t know, so she says “this why I never ask you anything you never know” not in a nice tone. It truly hurt me I would never belittle her like that I was stunned when she said it. I asked her if she would want me to lie to her and she stormed off. I finished dinner and brought her a plate in the bedroom and I told her to never talk to me like that again in a very calm tone and I left her for the night.

I had already packed my lunch and got my coffee ready the night before so I left without saying anything because I’m still hurt. I’ve been waiting for an apology, but instead she decides to not even message me and post things on Facebook like nothing ever happened.

He texted me first, and we started talking. He is in the same college as me, and we both go home by metro. The second time we met, we traveled back home together. The third time, we kissed and made out. The fourth time, we went for coffee, and he asked if I wanted to come over. I said no.

He never talked much over text and still has not given me his phone number. When I asked, he just said, ""Not so easy to get.""

The next time we met, we made out again. He asked for a BJ, and I said no, but he kept asking and asking until I finally gave in. I felt so disgusted, but I let it go because my ex used to do the same thing, and I just thought, ""Fuck it.""

Later, when we were going home together again, I told him we did not have college the next day, and he asked if I wanted to go on a date. I told him I would have to see if I could get out of the house because my parents are strict. He said okay. That night, I texted him asking if we were still going out, and he said he would let me know, but he never did.

I went to Ahmedabad for a study tour for a week. On the second day, he started acting really dry. The night before, I had been drinking and accidentally called him on Instagram. I still did not have his number. The next day, he just sent a question mark. I told him I was drunk, and he said, ""I don’t like girls who drink,"" so I just said, ""Okay.""

Later, I was at the zoo and sent him a picture of a cute otter. He left me on open. When I asked him what happened, he ignored me and just sent me reels. I told him he knew something was off, and I was trying to talk to him, but he was still being dry, so I just said, ""Fuck it.""

I send little vlogs on Snap to my close ones, including him. I was sending them as usual when he suddenly said, ""I have something to say,"" and told me things like, ""I can’t love you,"" ""I don’t have a heart,"" ""I’m different from this generation,"" and ""You should distance yourself from me."" I said, ""Fine,"" and then he went, ""See how easily people give up."" I told him, ""You know what you just did, right?"" and he said, ""Yeah, forget about it,"" then continued asking about my day and if I wanted to see his new specs. I was dry with him and left him on seen.

The next day, he texted me, saying he had not been feeling good, which was why he acted that way. That was valid, so I forgave him. After that, I was not too clingy, and we did not talk much over text.

After coming back from my study tour, I was hospitalized for a week and could not go to college. He did not even check in on me unless I texted him first. I had exams right after getting out of the hospital and was still recovering. It was so hard to take those exams. I had a terrible cough and cold, my head felt heavy all the time, and I could barely breathe. I had to pull all-nighters because I had been on a trip, then in the hospital, so I had no time to prepare.

When my exams finally ended, I met him. We kissed, and he asked me for a BJ again. I said no multiple times. This time, I just really did not want to. My throat was hurting so bad, I was drained, I had lost so much weight over the past few weeks because of all this, and I was weak and sleep-deprived. He kept insisting. I kept saying no. Then he started pushing my head down, trying to make me get on my knees, and I was still saying no.

I did not give him a BJ that day and went home. After that, I ghosted him. He kept sending me reels and saving my snaps.

Today, I missed him too much, so I texted him, ""Hi."" We talked, he apologized for things, and now he wants to meet tomorrow.

I'm usually confident + smooth, but about 25% of the time, I'm nervous and awkward.   Today was one of such times, where I was nervous af, but also, the girl was so so nervous too.  I'm curious if anyone has any take on this:

===

I was sitting at a desk at a coffeeshop and saw two beautiful women chatting with each other in line.  I slightly smiled at both of them.  Neither really acknowledged me or smiled, other than one gave me a bit of an icy, apathetic stare, and the other was just kind of neutral.

A few minutes later, the girl who was neutral gave me a nice smile as she walked by me.  I can usually differentiate between a friendly smile versus a flirty smile, but in this case, it was about halfway between the two and I just couldn't tell.

I smiled back but didn't say anything right then.  The two women went off to the side, not too far away, and continued chatting with each other.  A few minutes went by and I walked up to them, and started chatting up the girl who had smiled at me. 

It was one of the most awkward conversations I've had.  Part of why I was uncomfortable was that her friend continued to give me this icy, disapproving glare, without saying a word, the whole time.   

I was quite nervous, and the girl I was talking with was very nervous as well.  Both of our voices were shaking, and our conversation, while friendly, was forced.  She didn't dismiss me, but after about one minute, I just wasn't feeling we were vibing sufficiently well and so I told her ""good meeting you, have a good day!"" and left, without asking her out or giving her my number.

For the girl I was interested in and talking with, I couldn't tell why she was nervous.  Maybe it was just that she didn't like rejecting people and was anxious that she soon might have to reject me or at least dismiss me.  It's also possible she was nervous because she was attracted to me.  And in any case, few women are getting approached these days, so they aren't used to it and that alone can make them nervous.

In terms of how to improve going forward, I could of at least handed her a card or note with my number, even if I was too nervous to ask her out or ask her number as I usually am comfortable doing.  And of course, there are many ways to improve emotional state (confidence/mindset), so I can work on my consistency.

1jeci22,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1jeci22/just_a_story/,Just a story.,"The week she died, it rained nonstop, as if the universe was weeping for Joan. She had led a simple life up to that point; waking at seven every morning to eat egg whites and drink a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, while considering the chances she missed and the possibilities she had squandered. She had spent her life fantasizing instead of acting and now in her late thirties the dream was dwindling and reality was a hot shower and a restless night of sleep. The morning routine was followed by the occasional cry and an internal motivational speech, in which she would tell herself to get her shit together, but her drive wasn’t what it once was, as she had grown exhausted while being trampled by the trials of life.  

Work was an endless nightmare, a repetitious zombie-like fugue state where she enslaved herself for the luxury of debt and bills. She would often sit at her desk and stare at her account balance; fantasizing of a random deposit of ones and zeros flooding in from some unnamed source of generosity. Her coworkers would enter the office with over-the-top compliments and platitudes as if to lessen the weight of the load they were about to pawn off on her. Every one of them had some engagement that somehow prevented them from taking care of their own responsibilities, and at the end of the day it was almost a statistical guarantee that Joan would leave her job with a box full of her coworker's tasks.  

Joan would get into her car and sit for a minimum of ten minutes. Once for an hour, but to be fair, that was the day that Gene down the hall hung himself in his office. A sight that Joan had no intention of stumbling upon, but Gene was her office neighbor and had bought Joan a present on her second day of work; It was a cactus with a pot that said “Dream, and never let go.” You see, Joan had gone to a nice little antique store during her lunch break, the one she knew Gene frequented quite often. She spent thirty minutes trying to find the perfect gift for one of her only allies. She finally settled on an old hand-cranked radio. It was quite the purchase in which she ended up spending more money than she could, but she left the store thoroughly pleased. As she drove back to work with what she considered to be the perfect gift, Joan noticed a genuine smile on her face through the rear view. An occurrence, which happened so sparingly, that she was unsure if she was even able to produce one anymore. She pulled into the poorly lit parking garage and parked as quickly as she could. She jumped out of her car, and flung open her back door where the old radio set. She admired her purchase one last time before lugging the antique to the elevator. Once the elevator doors had closed, she sat the cumbersome relic down and let out a little gasp. When the door opened she grabbed the radio and began to struggle down the hallway towards Gene's office, trying wholeheartedly to maintain a solid grip on the expensive chunk of wood, gears, and springs she had just purchased. Upon arrival at Gene's office Joan noticed that his door was shut completely which seemed rather strange considering how inviting Gene was normally. Nevertheless, she tried to bump the radio against the door in lieu of knocking. When there was no answer Joan assumed that Gene was out, and decided to leave his gift as a pleasant little surprise for when he returned. She set the radio down, and turned the handle of Gene’s office door.  

The smell hit her first—whiskey sharp and sour, cut through with the metallic tang of urine. Gene’s body hung from a pipe in the ceiling, his neck bent at a grotesque angle. His polished shoes swayed inches above the desk, the rope creaking like a rusted hinge. His face had bloated to a mottled purple, veins bulging like ink spilled under glass. Blood vessels had burst in his eyes, leaving them raw and crimson, his tongue swollen and bitten nearly through at the tip. An empty bottle of cheap bourbon sat beside a note smudged with fingerprints.  

The letter read:  
“Dear Joan, I hope you're not the one that finds me like this. I am truly sorry if you are. I never meant to put any of this on you. I really never meant for any of this. I lost a part of myself a long time ago when Eric died. He was the love of my life, and I never recovered. Before he was deployed he assured me that he was completely safe. That he wasn’t going to be anywhere near the danger. Four excruciating months later two walking uniforms handed me some fucking letter of condolence. A real sincere apology from Uncle Sam and his murder machine. A fucking letter in exchange for the love of my life being obliterated in an exploding helicopter. Before that moment I had been on track to be a software engineer living my dream, but after I lost all desire to move forward. I accepted a shit position in life, and blamed myself for everything. I Received the news ten years ago today that I would never be able to spend another moment with purpose beyond the natural instinct of base survival. Today while sitting at my desk, I realized that my life had already ended; that there was nothing left for me. So I made the decision to end a miserable existence in exchange for a minute chance of being with Eric again.  
P.S. Joan I have one last request from you. Well two, First please feed my cat and find her a home. She is a great cat, and I have no one else to help me. The second thing is that you take control of your life and make a difference. Just do something Joan. You're not too old, or too broken yet. Please take a chance and don’t end up like me.”  

Joan kept the letter at work for months, reading it on occasion before eventually taking it home, and laying it in a drawer where she pretended to forget it for a time. Joan couldn’t help but think about Gene often. He was the only man she had ever met that had never tried to take a part of her with him. In fact, He had always given more to her than he had taken. In a way she felt some kind of love for Gene. He reminded her of her father, well except he was sober more often than her father.  
Not that Joan’s father didn’t try to be a passable paternal figure, but he had many demons to deal with, one of them being the horrid memories of his own father, who would often enter the room he and his sister shared, and initiate what he called “play time” In which he would coerce them into undressing and doing unspeakable acts from the time he was nine and his sister only seven. Of course Joan’s father would never admit this to anyone including Joan. After all, his father was long gone as well as his sister, who had been a patient at a psych ward for the better part of twenty years. Joan’s father had buried the memory deep and had forced it further into the subconscious over the years as each time that it surfaced in his thoughts he would push it down further. He never even attempted to deal with the trauma that was forced onto him, and often displayed fits of rage due to his repression, but he never once laid a hand on his wife or daughter. But he was also rarely around and the few times he was around he was never sober.  

Joan was unlucky enough to visit her aunt one time in her life. At the age of fourteen Joan's father drove her to the facility where his sister was being held. He gave her no warning and no reason. He Just said that He needed to show her something. The first thing Joan noticed upon entering the almost prison-like structure was the whiteness of the walls, along with the smell of chemicals much like those found in your average hospital. A clear sign that another odor was being masked. The fluorescent lights buzzed like trapped flies. A nurse with chipped pink nail polish eyed Joan’s trembling hands before buzzing them through a heavy door.  

Joan felt a surge of fear as people behind glass buzzed her and her dad through the facility. It felt as if they had been waiting for an eternity, but they finally arrived at the visitors area which was really just a couple of tables with some chairs all of which seemed to be attached to the floor. Joan and her father sat quietly for at least forty five minutes before Joan’s aunt shuffled into the room, wearing a white medical gown with restraints bound to her hands and feet. She was accompanied by a tall man in solid white. Joan’s Aunt sat directly across from her staring at her with a blank expressionless face. Her wrists were raw where the leather straps had bitten into her skin, and patches of her scalp showed through clumps of torn-out hair. After a few minutes of silence. Joan’s father finally spoke up and asked his sister how she was doing. She slowly looked over to him and started laughing hysterically. She then started to bash her head against the table repeatedly before the man in the white grabbed her and started to restrain her. Two more men entered and one escorted Joan and her father out of the room.  

The only thing Joan’s father said on the hour-long drive back to their home was that his sister had suffered horrible trauma and wasn’t able to deal with it. Joan would never learn that her grandfather had institutionalized her aunt after she had threatened to expose him. He claimed his daughter had been doing hard drugs, which was true to a point. After all, she was dealing with a massive trauma that made a perfectly happy young girl into a completely broken shell. He also claimed that she had tried to harm herself in front of him. The facility which loved using shock therapy and heavy doses of drugs had effectively left Joan’s aunt incapable of forming any rational thought and with their help Her father had managed to destroy his daughter completely. After that day Joan's father never spoke of his sister again. He would die a few years later from liver failure.  

Joan would arrive home after work and become stationary. Her house, while small, was quite comfortable and charming. Pleasant artwork covered the walls, and in a corner untouched set the antique radio which had become a twisted reminder of her friend's end. Joan would flip the television on with no intention of ever paying attention to whatever appeared on the screen. She would heat up some food which was more often than not a frozen dinner. Then she would start her nightly routine which ended with her lying in bed staring at the wall until two in the morning before finally drifting off to sleep.  

One morning instead of following her usual routine of egg whites and orange juice. Instead she went out and found a local diner for breakfast. While eating she noticed a newspaper and began searching through the classifieds at the job listings. She had ordered the blueberry pancakes which was a dish her mom had always made her when she was down. She sipped on coffee even though she didn’t tend to care for the bitterness; she had added half and half with two packets of sugar, another reference to her mother. Joan had always emulated her mom; A strong, thoughtful woman with a gift for understanding. Joan had often thought back to the mornings when her mom would make breakfast and tell Joan fantastical stories of growing up in a family of musicians and artists.  

Joan often wondered how her mother and father ever came together. They were completely different in almost every way. Joan's father was the son of a hardened construction worker and her mom was a part of a creative and artistic family. Joan had always assumed it must have been an anomaly of some kind.  

By the end of her breakfast Joan had come to a decision; she would put her two weeks notice in at work and go back to school for something she felt strongly about. She was finally ready to take a real chance for once in her life. She felt something she hadn't felt in a very long time; determination.  

She proceeded to take the long, scenic way to work, today she had no fear of being late; she had no worries of being scrutinized. For once In her life Joan felt at peace with herself and the prospects of her future.  

When Joan arrived at work she was met with hostility from her manager who had noticed her tardiness and had taken it upon himself to make Joan an example for the consequences of not being on time. Joan simply chose to ignore his aggression and instead focused on her plans for the future. She wasn't going to let her manager's fragile masculinity get in the way of her new revelation.  

Joan spent much of the day looking into different universities as well as financial aid for schools. She had gone to university after high-school but dropped out in order to take care of her mom after she was diagnosed with cancer. Sadly her mom passed away a year later, but Joan had never gotten a real opportunity to go back to school.  

At the end of the work day Joan sent her manager an email containing her two weeks notice along with a nicely worded Thank you note attached, but before she could even make it out to the parking garage her phone started emitting the sounds of multiple notifications. Before she could even look at her phone to see the notifications the phone started ringing. It was her manager. He had texted Joan multiple times asking her to come to his office and talk about things. She declined the call and put her phone on silent. The company she worked for was known for underpaying and treating employees poorly until they attempted to quit and then begging them with scraps to stay. Joan didn't want to hear anything her manager had to say. She was done with that part of her life.  

Over the next two weeks her manager didn't speak to her and instead had his assistant relay any and all messages back to Joan. This of course didn't bother Joan at all. She had never cared for her manager and was relieved that she didn't have to talk to him anymore. He was someone that Gene and Joan would mock over the way he treated people, especially the women in the office, who he would often make inappropriate advances towards, so Joan didn't mind not being objectified during her final two weeks.  

Joan spent much of her remaining work hours ignoring her responsibilities while searching for the school. After a week of searching Joan had decided that she wanted to become a psychologist.  

Joan applied for a school and began to wait. During the wait Joan started to participate in social activities that she had never attempted before, at least not in a serious manner. It was like her whole existence had changed with one decision. After a couple of weeks she received a letter accepting her into school, and she was ecstatic. This was everything she had ever wanted without even realizing until that moment.  

Joan spent the next couple of weeks experiencing much of the life she had missed out on when she was younger due to her circumstances. She lived out her more youthful fantasies which included somewhat reckless behavior at times but it was always rather tame compared to stories Joan had heard growing up.  

One weekend Joan met someone who made her feel really special while she was out at a bar. She ended up going home with them and had an unforgettable night of passion, which she assumed was a specialty event for both parties, but when she woke up the next morning the other person ushered Joan out quickly with no real explanation. That really hurt Joan on a very deep level. She felt used and thrown out. It sent her into a depressed mental state, and caused a lot of self doubt.  

She didn't feel like going out anymore. Instead she receded back into her old habits of mindless repetition. She rationalized it by telling herself that school was about to begin and that she needed to focus, but deep down the pain was still very real.  

Once school began things gradually became better. Joan put all of her focus into her classes and studies which was great in the sense that it left her with no time to obsess over her other more personal issues.  

Joan became quite popular among a group of her classmates mostly due to the fact that she always took great notes and made copies for her classmates to use. Joan told herself she didn't mind because at least she didn't feel alone in the study groups. Even though in the back of her mind she knew it was the same dynamic she had experienced with her coworkers at her last job.

The day of her death was eerily normal. Joan made her classic breakfast of egg whites with a glass of orange juice. She decided to ride her bike to the library, something she had made a semi-regular thing over the last few months. As she got closer to the library she could see her study group waiting outside. As she approached the crosswalk she noticed a homeless woman and handed her some change from her pocket. By that time the light had turned red, and so she waited. The homeless woman’s fingernails brushed Joan’s palm—cold and cracked—as she muttered “Bless you, bless you” like a rosary. When the light turned green she began to peddle across the street.  

The car came from her left—a silver sedan with a shattered headlight, radio blasting static. The driver’s head lolled against the window, mouth slack. Tires screeched. Joan’s lungs filled with the stench of burnt rubber half a heartbeat before impact.  

The sedan struck her hip first. Her femur snapped with a wet crunch. The bike folded like foil as her body arced twenty feet, limbs flailing, before slamming into the pavement. Her skull cracked against the curb, blood pooling thick and dark beneath her hair. Her study group sprinted toward her. One boy—Josh, who’d once lent her a pencil and lingered too close—screamed “Call 911!” but stood frozen, staring at her left leg twisted backward, denim torn and bone jutting through.

Paramedics worked on her for thirty minutes. One pressed gauze to her skull while another barked vitals: “BP 60 over 40! Pupils fixed!” They loaded her into the ambulance, sirens wailing. Her hand slipped off the gurney, dangling limp as the doors slammed shut. She was pronounced dead on arrival.  

Rain still fell as they zipped the body bag. At her desk, the cactus Gene had given her sat untouched, its soil dry and cracked. The pot’s message—“Dream, and never let go”—faded under a layer of dust.

I ended up walking about eight or nine miles. I detoured through Marina well I to my walk to Monterey.

I decided to find a Walmart to buy a small tent, sleeping bag and tarp.

I ended up getting lost because my phone was too low on battery to use the. Al program. I was sitting at McDonald's loving life. No refills on coffee. Still loving life, but 99 cents is to much for one small cup of coffee. 

It was between McDonald's and the Walmart where I got lost. I thought they were on the same road. They weren't.

On my way there I found a good spot to set up my tent. I went with the one man for price and a smaller footprint.

I saw what I thought was an office complex because there were a few cars.

A couple of small dogs started barking when I was setting up. 

Then I see a big flashlight shine towards me. I dropped below the tent. This person moved. So did a car. And here he comes.

It was then that I knew the police had arrived, but that was an unusual response for someone setting up a tent for the first time.

It turns out they were actually looking for someone. They came driving by later. Still looking.

Not for me though. 

I wasn't even attempting to hide.

I spent the next day, Saturday, sleeping (dreaming a lot).

On Sunday cars were still there early in the morning. I was hoping it was a park with a clean bathroom.

Nope.

It's a library.

So today is the first day I got a chance to actually give my phone a significant charge.

Walmart had been letting me charge my phone for about 10 minutes at a clip on the inside of the store.

The library just opened back up today at 11 AM.

....

I've yet to scavenge from any dumpsters or even try. I have been looking for water and power. No luck at all.

I've seen a few people fly signs, but I don't want to do that here.

I'll have to do it somewhere though.

I no longer have access to my debit card.

Four fraudulent McDonald's purchases have been attempted in the last couple of days. I always keep the card locked, so they just shut it off.

I'm not even going to replace it.

....

I'm still traveling with too much gear. Now I'm back to my backpack (35 liter) and a laundry bag with a shoulder strap like before.

It's a great grift. 

Hapless and hopeless.

....

Yesterday I went through my gear one more time to get rid of stuff. I left some full bars of soap and a titanium lot with that blue bag in a spot for someone to find it.

I've got about a quarter of the Arizona sweet tea I bought plus a bag of chips.

After I check the weather, I'll decide when and where next.

Guaranteed though.

If I was already collecting social security, I would ride out the entire Spring here.

Birds chirping in the morning. No body cares I setup a semi-permanent camp that I didn't even break down after dawn.

The only bad thing about the tent is that I will be so lazy and not do an entire thing all day.

On my way out of here, there is a long stretch of road with a Dollar Tree and several restaurants.

Maybe I can scrounge up some food.

If not.

I've got my HUNGRY sign.

The same one as before.

....

So this is sort of a question / rant here, I may ramble a bit but bear with me. So I (28m) had my first ever seizure last year, it was I think a tonic-clonic? I blacked out and had full body convulsions, an MRI and an EEG later and I’m diagnosed with epilepsy. It’s been just shy of a year at this point, I’ve been taking Keppra and Calcium for a year and I’m also on Anxiety and ADHD medication. Fortunately, I haven’t had any other events since then, which I’ve been feeling very positive about generally. However despite being grateful for this I find the idea that I really have no clue what my triggers are or my frequencies may be at this point leaves me with a lot of unknowns that cause me a great deal of anxiety. I started browsing this sub recently in order to try and read other people’s experiences and found the FAQ super helpful, but I have found myself reading a lot of posts about people struggling really badly, being triggered by very simple things, totally avoiding caffeine (I drink a lot of coffee) as well as very negative experiences with Keppra and it’s all kind of made me nervous again. Really I guess I’m looking for some positivity here, is there anyone who is or was at one point in a similar boat to me? Thanks everyone for your time and for those of you suffering more than me I hope this post doesn’t come off as whiny or unappreciative of my luck so far. ",5,1742323180.0,Epilepsy,1,1.0,False

The Hillbillies lyrics have been bothering me for a while, especially the ones about Cologne. So I started poking around on the map. I'm going to try to make it brief, but I'll happily answer questions more in depth about everything I found, here's the important stuff... 

> *I don't buy much, I buy land, bro*  
*Cologne, Germany*  
*Four McDonalds, every time I land, bro*

 So I went looking and here's what I found.

If you'll recall there have been previous discussions on this sub about some points of interest in Cologne, cologne like perfume, something that **smells**.

* There's a neighborhood in this area called **RINGE** (somebody told me that you got a ring). In fact if I connect all of these places, I get a loop, a ring. Inside the large loop that connects all the locations are 4+ McDonald's locations, which are referenced in the song.

* There's **Pascha**, which is a brothel we've been pointed to.
* And oh look, **Maybach** Street.

* We also know there's a **Drake Records** in Cologne.

https://preview.redd.it/ld130l2pphpe1.jpg?width=417&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fe8a595a371256ded5b595fe49515cce64417961

I started marking the map. I thought it made sense to see if I could find something named Gloria in the area, since that is apparently a gianormous clue.

* I did, I found **Gloria Theater** in the general area. (See the RINGE photo above)
* When I did this I noticed that there's a local chain of coffee shops in that area called **Fassbenders**. There's been a number of clues pointing towards coffee and Michael Fassbender played young Magneto in X-Men First Class. (You know the last one figured, he was Magneto).

https://i.imgur.com/ddpOuJK.jpeg

At this point I KNOW I'm in the right place. Go to the map and look for yourself!

* In that loop, I saw **Antwerp**ner Street. The word ""Antwerp"" has been on my radar since the end of the King's Dead video - Kendrick is wearing a hoodie that says Antwerp. I thought it was because we were supposed to look at Antwerp (and I'm not sure we don't need to also be looking there since it's the diamond trafficking capital of the world but let's stay here for now).

https://preview.redd.it/ta2y40pfqhpe1.jpg?width=275&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d6589579bdaad4390a09d1de751fc8e4972bb04b

* I see that Antwerpener Street crosses over a street called **Friesenplatz**. It means Frisian Square but if you don't speak German, you might read it like ""freeze in place"" like if you're frozen.
* The street that meets Antwerpner at a POINT is called Bra**banter**. ""Banter"" means talking like ""What they talking about"" from Peekaboo. Nearby is a restaurant named Bibimbab (the peekabo lyrics).
* **Wolf** Street and Bruder aka Brother (**Bro**) Street nearby- I don't speak German but guess I know enough to recognize obvious cognates which is how I found everything. (I do, however, speak French and I've got a banger of a post coming related to that.) *Honestly there are a TON of clues if you start looking around in this area, but honestly what I've listed is plenty to convince me.* 

**So anyway, what did Kendrick say was happening in Cologne... ""buying land"".**

I don't know what I was looking for exactly but going off of the buying land thing, I was looking for a house? That doesn't make sense because it's a very densely packed urban area... he can't really buy land there. Unless he bought a commercial building? What am I looking for? That's when I went to street view on Google Maps to start looking around.... here's where my heart skipped a beat.

Where Antwerpner and Brabanter meet (at a point) across the street is a store called Modehaus **Weingarten** Herrenhaus.  Wein like Weinstein and garten means garden in German. Ok, that's a clue but not that big of a deal until you see the sign hanging on the side of the building. ""Men"" If you are on the street looking, it literally says ""men"" ""garten"". **Man in the garden**. We are absolutely where we need to be.  Let me point it out for you: 

https://preview.redd.it/c314r88dmhpe1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcfe636c5df61f12911311a6f3dd2003003c053d

Before I went to Google Maps and that street view, I was looking at just the 2D version in Apple Maps. I saw a business called ""**Galerie Susanne Zander**"" that was across the street from the ""men"" ""garten"" sign. I went to the website. Dogs on the homepage? You have my attention! [https://delmes-zander.de/index.php?lang=en](https://delmes-zander.de/index.php?lang=en)

So I kept poking around the website and looked at the list of ""exhibitions"" [https://delmes-zander.de/exhibitions.php?lang=en](https://delmes-zander.de/exhibitions.php?lang=en) I can't explain it, but the names of the exhibitions seemed.... off. I noticed one in 2019 called ""**Into the Land Lab**"" (*I buy LAND, bro... every time I LAND, bro*) [https://delmes-zander.de/archive.php?lang=en&a=alexandru\_chira\_09112019](https://delmes-zander.de/archive.php?lang=en&a=alexandru_chira_09112019)

As is usually the case when I'm working on Kendrick's puzzle, I know that the name might be a clue, so I google the artist, Alexandr**u** Chira. EXCEPT before i realized it, my phone autocorrected it to Alexandr**a** Chira. You know like just one letter changed - **a lowercase ""a"".**

Alexandra Chira happens to be a young **ROMAN**ian singer. Here's her Tidal page: [https://tidal.com/browse/artist/7149509](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/7149509) Romania, like the trafficking capital of the world where Andrew Tate was hiding out. I'm not sure how old she is, but this was her in 2009. I'd be shocked if she's older than 9 or 10 years old here. I don't speak a lick of Romanian though, so I can't find out much about her without going a very deep dive and I'm not going to do that right now because I have something else brewing.

**Oh, and one more thing that's just a tiny bit sketchy to me.... it's actually what makes me nearly 100% certain that I'm right about this being a location of interest...** I did most of this research yesterday while on my phone. I have an iPhone so i was using Apple Maps. This morning, I'm sitting in my office at my desk, so I'm using Google Maps to build out my sources for this post. 

**Why is this gallery that I found at this address only shown on Apple Maps and not Google Maps?** As a matter of fact when I search for it on Google Maps, I see the gallery in a totally different location and it says it's permanently closed, what is that about? I double, triple checked. Apple Maps says Galerie Susanne Zander is located at Antwerpener Strabe 1 (1 Antwerpner Street). But Google Maps says it's just a building... a building that looks like this - do you think an art gallery was actually here or are they using the address of this dilapidated building just for a physical address? Why would there be such a huge discrepancy between Apple and Google maps with relation to this address? 

https://preview.redd.it/33kkdawpmhpe1.jpg?width=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a849261dd0406113c85010be56ee2b5c1aecf5c3

https://preview.redd.it/77xnkpw5phpe1.jpg?width=1320&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=39eb040e8fc61ccb45ab517289c3bae5a7814121

I know it's a lot, but whatever is going on in connection to this building is connected to whatever Drake's involved in that Kendrick's trying to tell us about. I will let you draw your own conclusions for the most part, but I don't think the art gallery is selling art and I'll leave it at that. All of the clues pointing me to that specific location, the weirdo exhibit names, the almost identical name to a young singer from a country know for sex trafficking and the maps discrepancy? Can't be coincidence. 

Oh, by the way... kaninchenloch means ""rabbit hole"" in German. :)

I have very little that I want to be tucked away for never- or infrequent use. 

The problem is, I don't know what to use for storage/display so have been paralyzed when it comes to purchasing furniture and therefore am stuck in the situation of things not having their rightful spaces (they're either still unpacked or float around causing clutter).

Things I haven't sorted storage for: 

*In the attic, I have lots of old notebooks and resources from my uni years and childhood, which I'd like to keep. Obviously bookshelves are a thing, but the roof height is a problem and I would need more depth than a standard bookshelf. Aesthetics aren't important.

*In the ""back room"" (basically a single bedroom off the kitchen), I have standard bookshelves and a bedside cabinet storing the tools and DIY stuff, but eventually I'd like to use this space as an office (to free up the spare bedroom for guests), but I don't know where else to put the stuff that's in there (no garage). 

*In the dining room, I have two closets, one with shelves housing board games, one with the gas boiler and cleaning stuff (vacuum, broom, mop etc). I also have a dining table and a 4-cube shelving unit housing coffee-table and hobby books next to an armchair. But the cube shelf is overflowing and I don't know where else to put its contents. (Maybe a taller unit in the  back room/study if I could move the tools). As the dining room is so central, I would like it to be aesthetic.

*I only have a tiny galley kitchen so would love to have something with height in the dining room to store and  display extra kitchen stuff (but I can't find the right thing - I'd like aesthetic display plus hidden-away storage).

*Knick-knacks and ornaments. At the moment I have no idea how to display these let alone in what room. These are also mostly in boxes in the attic.

I'd be very grateful for any obvious ideas I might be missing and general advice.

Honestly lost I think.  Found myself on a bus to Sarasota.  Off the bus now, thinking of ways to end myself, maybe the water, take myself and my things to the ocean and just walk in, or the bridge I am sure there are spots to jump from.  How did I even get here.  I do not know, overwhelmed, too much in my brain but then nothing at all.  What am I even doing here.

I sit here looking at everything and everyone and think I would be better and happy if I am gone and done.  No pain, no thoughts going everywhere, no one will know or miss me, I am no one anymore anyway.  Going to finish my pack of cigarettes, find a way to the beaches or a nice bridge maybe, but I do not want to burden people, need to think of a better way I guess.  I know I want help but I know I do not deserve it.  
It was weird yesterday I think yesterday, just thought, let’s do it.  Let’s be done.  Do not know why Sarasota, my brain is weird these days, controlled by other things and people inside but outside I think.  Got up this morning and got coffee, packed my favorite things I have left and just got on the bus and spaced out.  Now I am here in Sarasota trying to think but my mind is a blur and I hear sometimes the voice but sometimes others.  They don’t care but they are going to get you.  No one needs you, but they will find you.  Leave get out end it today, I need them to stop but they will not.  
I have a bottle of bourbon, that might help but I have to find a place where no one will see me or hear me or find me hopefully.
I am lost but trying to stay in control it is hard today.  Why am I here? Why this city, why Sarasota.  They voice said to go, the other one agrees, overwhelming and need to sleep but how.  I want this to just stop.

I’ve been going consistently since I was in my teens, and go there a few times a week. Although, there’s only 1 Starbucks that’s close to me. The next closest one is about 40 minutes away. For the past month, my drink orders have been messed up almost every. single. time. I order a grande iced coffee, with heavy cream, 2 pumps vanilla syrup, and caramel drizzle. Sometimes I order cold foam, and sometimes not. Not very complicated. The other drink I get is a grande iced matcha with 2 pumps of brown sugar, and vanilla cold foam. It seems like every time I’ve gone this past month, they either don’t put the cold foam on it, the caramel drizzle on it, and/or they put so much cream in it to the point where it tastes like nothing and the color is almost completely white. This has been happening so much to the point where it seems like they do it on purpose? I just stopped asking them to remake it, and started filing complaints online in the help section of the app to get stars for a free one. I don’t know why this thought came into my head, but I’ve had to do that so many times that I’m afraid the baristas know it’s me who’s doing it. 

My question to all of the baristas is, can the baristas see who files the complaints online in the help section? I feel really bad for doing it but at the same time… it’s not like the drinks are $3.

(Zum Beispiel https://clearly.eu/products/not-coffee-offer ) Ich bin jetzt mehr daran interessiert, Bacopa auszuprobieren.  Um Empfehlungen zu bitten, um sicher zu sein, da ich Verdauungsprobleme IBS, Unverträglichkeiten (und einige nicht großartige Erfahrungen mit andere Supps und Probiotics) habe, wäre es sehr dankbar, wenn Sie einige Empfehlungen zu qualitativ hochwertigen Produkten (vielleicht Kapseln) von Online-Shops oder Amazon (normalerweise nicht großartig) geben könnten ), wo es sicherer zu kaufen ist. Ich möchte es zusammen mit Risperdon einführen, nachdem ich mich von Elvanse verjüngt habe, die Wechselwirkungen sind nicht so stark. Derzeit nehme ich Elvanse(30 mg), Risperidon(1 mg), Lorazepam(0,5 mg). Ich fühle mich nicht mehr von L-Tyrosin beeinflusst, besonders wenn es in Risperdon ist, ist es eindeutig noch geringer.. Elvanse funktioniert nicht für meine ADS(wie andere Stimms), gib mir nur eine Anxiety, aber mehr Energie.. Irgendwelche Vorschläge für diesen Mix mit Pilzen wie Bacopa werden eine gute Hilfe sein.  Ich sehe, dass Bacopa mit meinen Medikamenten sicher ist..  Ich werde meinen Arzt konsultieren. ‼️ Für Supplements-Enthusiasten , die hier lesen, wird eine Selbstmedikation nicht empfohlen!Bitte konsultieren Sie Ihren Arzt, bevor Sie beginnen. Es ist für anekdotische Erfahrungen und Empfehlungen.

1jec1hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1jec1hh/for_everything/,For Everything.,"When it was just us, it was perfect. We were in our own little world; a world we built on shared laughter, inside jokes, the most random conversations, and pure affection and love for one another. A time when a simple coffee run felt like a ritual, and meant everything. A time when your voice was the only sound I wanted to hear at the start and end of every day.



We really had something. I mean, we *really* had something, didn’t we?



Remember the way we could talk for hours about anything everything, and yet nothing at all? The way you’d light up speaking about your passions, and then felt embarrassed when I told you how your face would change? The way any silence between us was just comfort not awkwardness, and that we could sit in silence and just *be*? The days that felt endless, but never long enough? 



We made memories which still bring a smile, even now. The road trips, the spontaneous adventures, the Sunday evenings spent wrapped up in each other’s warmth. The little things that weren’t so little at all, and the way we both knew what the other needed without even asking. 



And for all of it, I’m grateful.



I don’t regret a single second of what we had. Not the highs, not the lows; not even the ending. Because for a time, we had something beautiful. And even if it didn’t last, that doesn’t make it any less real.



So, this isn’t a letter of longing or sadness, it’s a letter of thanks. For what we shared, for what we built, for the way we made each other feel, even if was only for a chapter.



Some things aren’t meant to last forever, but that doesn’t mean they weren’t real whilst they did.

1jec1f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CAStateWorkers/comments/1jec1f2/cdph_seemingly_rolling_over_on_rto/,CDPH seemingly rolling over on RTO,"Feel good rah rah town hall this morning. You are expected to come in and guess what all us execs are too! Can’t wait for the off the cuff conversations that are going to happen in the hallways and all the great mentoring and coaching! All you have to do is get back into it! It’s just a routine to come back and interact with people and you will get used to it. 

And then in the same breath, it is we are a healing organization and we understand this is stressful situation but we will navigate it together and take the trauma training.. you’ll feel better! There’s an acknowledgment of the benefits of telework but it seems that those go out the window and are no longer part of the discussion. 

Collaboration and connectivity have been loud disruptive conversations and daily parties not related to workloads or productivity. There’s no backbone by leadership here. This makes me and likely others respect CalPERS, CalSTRS, and DOE more since those leaders are standing up against this asking questions and demonstrating what works best for their department, their people, their production, etc. Those have become destination departments again. 

Just because someone with a title that wears a suit makes a decision or issues an order doesn’t mean that it’s correct, beneficial, based on data, or for personal gain as we all know that this is for Gavin. This meeting was all buzzwords by senior leadership and compliments to try and make people happy. Get ready for smaller spaces and no parking but the state has multiple parking garages so if you don’t find parking in your garage on a morning just go on the street or check out the other state garages (which will make you late to work or lead to longer breaks so you can move your car to a different street parking or cost you more with parking tickets, which doesn’t support productivity). 

Report OSHA violations related to space and inappropriate configurations. 

Since the budget is a concern here… make sure you get your ergonomic evaluations for those expensive chairs, footstools, mice, and keyboards. If you are office centered this is a service you are entitled to. 

Please don’t take your laptops home every day so your employer has access to you after hours. Staying late and responding after hours was a gift some of us were giving because of the work life balance and flexibility. Take it home only on your telework day. 

I hope agencies are ready for a lot of vacancies, retirements, quiet quitting, “bonding and relationship building” that aren’t related to work, walking, etc. that are one hundred percent not related to productivity or increasing quality of services. Morale is going to go down. Yes some will be happy because as it was mentioned today… “there’s a loneliness pandemic”… so I need to be penalized because people are lonely? 

Remember previous town halls execs were saying it will be good to get sunshine, get coffee and lunch with your coworkers, get out into nature because you do better thinking when you wander in nature, have those hallway conversations because you never know what will happen!… all the things managers used to be looking for as performance management issues are now things that are listed as reasons and activities you should be doing as part of RTO. 

I wonder if we will be back five days when Sacramento’s budget doesn’t see the increase in revenue that they are seeking through this… the state will also be seeing their costs increase with equipment, space needs, electricity, gas, water, paper products, etc. This is a lose lose across the board. Please make sure to not spend your money downtown. This is what it is all related to - commercial office space and increasing downtown business traffic, along with making Gavin and his supporters stronger through profits.  

There’s so much more to say… but in closing the execs discussed about how life expectancy was going down and mental and behavioral health are in trouble and suicide has increased… yeah these changes are going to help (sarcasm)… take away the work life balance, put people in an office prison more often than not, but throw trainings and buzzwords their way and it will all work out. 🤮 ",82,1742322517.0,CAStateWorkers,47,0.89,False

1jec06c,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jec06c/i_cant_recall_the_person_they_think_i_am/,I can’t recall the person they think I am,"A few years ago, I had a head injury that left me unconscious for a few minutes. At the hospital, I explained what had happened in detail, and the doctors told me I had no speech issues—they saw me speaking fluently and articulately. But the truth is, I felt like I was speaking like an idiot. Normally, I have a strong command of language and express myself clearly, but after the injury, something felt off. Since the doctors didn’t know how I spoke before, they had no reference point and assumed everything was fine. I wasn’t prioritized for a scan, and after some basic checks, I was sent home. Life went on.

The next day, I quickly realized something was wrong. I had lost access to two of the three languages I speak fluently, and in my main language, I sometimes had to pause for ten seconds just to find basic words like ""table"" or ""chair."" It was a surreal experience—knowing that I should know these words, but not being able to find them. Over the next one to two months, my language ability gradually came back, but it was a slow process.

Strangely, about two months later, I also started to lisp out of nowhere—it lasted a few days and then disappeared.

The biggest lingering issue is my memory of faces and certain past events. It’s not total amnesia—I still recognize places, and if someone reminds me of something, I can sometimes recall it. But it feels like I watched a movie years ago and completely forgot it. If someone describes the plot, I recognize it, but I wouldn’t have remembered it on my own.

I work in game development and have spent years working on large projects, often in teams of over 100 people. In those environments, it’s common to meet a huge number of people over time. And when you have a role that involves communication, a lot of people know you—not because you’re famous or anything, but simply because they’ve interacted with you at some point.

I live in a neighborhood where many game studios are located, so I regularly run into former colleagues while grabbing a coffee or doing groceries. Sometimes, people recognize me and greet me warmly, and I instinctively respond—but I have no idea who they are. Other times, I catch people looking at me like they expect me to acknowledge them, and I’m left wondering if I should know them—or if I just have something on my face.

At one point, I tried to dig through social media to piece things together. I looked up old messages and conversations, which helped a little, but every time I talked to someone about past events, I ended up with massive migraines. At first, I wanted to fill in the blanks, but over time, I realized it wasn’t worth it. It wasn’t a pleasant experience, and I decided to just let it go.

The hardest part isn’t just not recognizing faces—it’s not knowing the context of past relationships. If, at some point in my career or personal life, I didn’t handle a situation in the best way, it’s possible that some people have a negative impression of me—for completely valid reasons. But the problem is, I have no memory of those interactions, nor of those people. So sometimes, I get the feeling that someone doesn’t like me, but I have no idea why. It’s a strange experience—like knowing someone holds an opinion about a version of myself that is, in some way, a stranger to me.

This also makes job application complicated. The game industry is a small world, where everyone seems to know each other. It’s common during interviews to hear things like ""Oh, I know someone who worked with you!"" or ""I’ll ask so-and-so, they must know you."" And every time, it’s the same thing: ""Yeah, a lot of people know me, but I don’t know anyone."" I just have to keep a poker face and play along, because there’s a real chance that they do know me—but I don’t remember them at all.

I don’t really talk about this with people. Not because I’m hiding it, but because I don’t think it would really interest anyone. I feel like people would find it weird, but not in a spectacular way—just something they’d doubt a little, or find hard to believe. I also don’t want to make it a big deal. I just needed to put this down somewhere at least once.

Has anyone else experienced something like this?

We ordered drinks, which totaled over 200 pesos. He gave me a hundred, and I covered the rest.

After we got our order, I started craving one of their pastries. I told him multiple times that I wanted to get some. Then he said, ""Then buy one,"" or ""Buy it if you want."" I asked playfully, ""Won't you treat me?"" I was shocked when he replied, ""I didn’t even ask you to treat me.""

For some reason, it felt like my heart shattered. I didn't know what to say or how to react at that moment. I was at a loss for words, but in the back of my mind, I had so many thoughts. I rarely ask him for things I want or need. I never tell him to buy me this or that. I can buy myself a pastry, but I asked him as a form of affection.

When I went silent, he noticed. He insisted on buying the pastry, but I refused. I said, ""No, it's okay. Next time."" Then he said he felt guilty, like he was being stingy. He even asked, ""Was I being selfish?"" I shook my head. I knew he only wanted to buy it to ease his guilt, not because he genuinely wanted to.

How did it impact me? I might never ask him for anything ever again. I love him, and I know he loves me too. But I was hurt and surprised by what happened.

So I've been seeing this girl for about a month (I know a month isn't very long to be dating but the connection was so real and we were very close) 

We went on a first date and it was great, we met again the next day to walk in the park then later that night for a movie. We met again the following day even. We were seeing each other almost everyday and getting along great. 

With her being a third grade teacher, I know she doesn't make much so I found this cheap 40 inch $40 tv on offer up that came with a soundbar that I got for her. She was really appreciative of it. 

When her car window was broken into I drove up to pick her up from work to drive her to the mechanic, and I surprised her with doughnuts and her favorite coffee. Which she really appreciative too. 

She would send such nice messages after we hung out saying “thanks for being you, amazing in every way” and “I’m so excited to see what the future has for us” and “I’m so lucky to have you by my side” 

I feel like there was real love there. She struggles with body dysmorphia and depression, so I’m kind of feeling like maybe she pushed me away because of that. 

The day we saw each other last I spent the night. It was my second time spending the night and this time I forgot sweats and, although she was hesitant at first, eventually she said I can sleep in the bed with her with my boxers after I suggested I could sleep on the couch. The first night slept over I wore sweats because she said to bring something to wear to bed. I forgot sweats this time because I was rushing home from work to get showered up and drive up to her. 

The next morning I get up and she says “oh you’re in your underwear” like she forgot. I thought she was kidding so I said “ya, I don’t know what happened to them” and laughed. Maybe she thought I was trying to do something with her. We didn't have any sex and only touched and kissed like we did the first time I slept over. She had to go to work and my car was in the parking garage that didn't open for another hour. She left her keys with me that day and even suggested I could take her dog to the park. We met up after she got off work and I got us dinner and we watched an episode of a show. She then kinda rushed me out because of being stressed with work. After that she became very distant then blocked me. 

Some of the only things I could think of that I know I did that bothered her was made jokes in an accent. Although nothing racist, she said she didn't like them because she's a 3rd grade teacher and she sees how kids use accents to bully other kids. She said if adults do it then why isn't it ok for the kids to. I never thought about it that way until she explained it. I accidentally made the same type of joke again a few days later and she even laughed this time. 

Another thing is I played some explicit rap music and I sang along to some of it and she said “how do you even know the words” like she didn’t like I even knew the song. 

The next day (Thursday) we had one phone call and some texts but the following day (Friday) she barely texted at all. I tried calling and it went straight to voicemail. The next day (Saturday) I heard nothing from her, and all calls went straight to voicemail. On Sunday, I texted her (on a different phone) a nice paragraph saying that I'd love to talk to her if there were any issues and that I really care about her. She texted mine back saying ""sorry I've been thinking and we're not a match"" and ""I don't feel like we really clicked"" and ""you have treated me the best I've ever been treated"". Then she blocked me again, I didn't even get a chance to respond. 

I waited a few days, during some of them finishing up the song I started writing for her during the relationship. I really wanted to talk to her again and show her the song so I texted her again on Thursday. I sent another text saying that I realize I wasn't my best self around her and that she deserves better and talked about how we might not be perfect but the connection we had is still real. I also said I think that makes relationships stronger and that I don't think we can ever expect to find anyone ""perfect"". The end of the text I said that I finished up a song I started writing while we were seeing each other and that I'd love to show her it. I also said I wouldn't reach out again because I respect her. I never got a reply. 

I don’t know what to do because I really care about her so much, she even took me to her Church and has had me pick her up from her parents house. 

I feel like she might be used to  having people not care enough to try for her, I don't want to be another guy so ok with leaving so easily.

After much research and lurking here, I finally snagged a Vision Pro for my birthday. And I totally deserve it, lol.

I had two in-store tryouts to really convince myself. The main issue was always the fit and the pressure on my cheeks. I couldn’t get past it. I tried all the Apple straps too. But what I saw using them was next level. So I knew I would get the next “lighter” model one day.

Reading threads here about 3rd-party head straps sold me. As everyone raved that was the true fix to have it “float” with the forehead support. So “one day” became “why not today”!

So raves…

The A/R is just insanely cool. I wish I never bought a 70” Frame TV last year. This is like having an IMAX theater on demand. Shout out to Moon Player!

The immersion is so cool. Love the lake and mountains to just watch TV or a movie. Apple TV’s screening room is also great for their content.

The MacBook mirroring is clutch. As I need browser plugins to bypass so much web nonsense and tracking. Also, some things I prefer to do on certain devices.

The rants…

The nagging popups! It’s okay if this room is not hospital bright at every damn moment, AVP. I honestly could navigate my apartment blind like Daredevil. So give me a damn moment to find a light switch, okay, as I take two steps. And don’t stop the playback! I am not going to fall into a pit walking around my apt at night.

Also, the nagging about the fit and eye sight lines. AVP is very invested in telling you what it wants. It’s exhausting, and I want to turn the tips off. I will check whatever waiver box you want. Just leave me alone in my house.

The need to buy this $70 attachment! But it was the key to me loving this thing. So good call. People said there one Apple sells but it’s been sold out for months. With this maybe knockoff -I can wear it for hours now. Globular Cluster CMA1 Comfort Mod… https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY25S7MN?ref=ppx_pop_mob_ap_share

While probably for the best - I cannot eat or drink wearing it, lol. As soon as the fork goes out of frame I get nervous that I’ll miss. I have used a straw for drinks and lid for coffee to not spill. I may master it in a few more weeks.

Overall, could not be happier that I waited for some of the fixes to come out. I have been doing the Beta too. So this experience is all I’ve known. The eye / hand tracking is intuitive but an occasional challenge.  More me learning to train my eye+pinch.  I get stuck in apps and have to force quit all the time. My x-box controller working has been cool. I’m not a real gamer but loading old ROMs on Delta has been cool. And the real Apple Arcade games are amazing too.

So the AVP has been added to my tech collection. It and my Ray-ban Meta glasses will come on every work trip this year.

Still exploring this AVP ecosystem but this group made me a believer!",1,1742321550.0,AppleVision,0,1.0,False

I love making 3 lattes at once,"I have a hard time focusing on only one task, so if I'm skimming the milk, I need to be grinding the coffee beans at the same time. I want to be able to do multiple actions at once and so I love it when they ask for three coffees as it gives me opportunity to work on it all at once.
