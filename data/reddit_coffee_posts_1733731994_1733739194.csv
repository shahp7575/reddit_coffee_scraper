The barista told me that the owner roast around 800g coffee per batch. If anyone has knowledge about this machine, please do share, it's very fascinating.

I tried their signature medium road coffee(not sure about the estate and process) on a hot pour over V60, the barista was very knowledgeable and skilled for his work, had a great conversation with him, they could even try cupping coffee tasting if we ask. The coffee was great. Good acidity, mid bitterness, mildly sweet, fruity and chocolatey.

People on this sub suggested to try whiskey barrel processed medium roast coffee, which i did also on hot pour over, which was a mistake, should have ordered the iced one. But it was really pleasant tasting experience. They also sell the beans except the whiskey one. Do check them!

1ha6iu8,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1ha6iu8/i_dont_think_my_best_friend_of_6years_ever_cared/,I don't think my best friend of 6years ever cared about me. ,"LONG POST literally an essay. I don't know if anyone will read this. It feels good to finally see it all down in one place start to finish.

TLDR; my best friend / roommate screamed at me one morning and never apologized, their actions have made it repeatedly evident that I can't do anything to fix it and shouldn't be putting in so much energy or dwelling over it, but I just loved them so much. It hurts. It hurts that they could treat me like this and just move on from it after telling me they needed more from me, and their behaviors have become evident throughout our entire friendship in hindsight. It has taken a huge impact on my self worth. I don't know what to do at this point, but I know the truth is I just have to get over it. This feels like a good start. it feels good having written it all out. I genuinely think I have started the journey to loving myself and appreciating what I have vs. what I've lost. It just still hurts and I can't wrap my head around how someone I thought I knew so well could treat me like this.

If you read this story to the end -- thank you. I'm not sure how cognizant it is. I try to word myself fairly and comprehensively as a communications major but this is definitely a blurb of feelings at the end of the day. 

I (20afab /nb) moved to a different school freshman year, in 2017. I was a few months late because my parents had just bought a house and it took a while to move in - I got a tour the day before I started my classes. My chorus teacher was still there, he showed me the auditorium and told me they were actually having their first concert that night, If I wanted to come. So I did. My friend had a solo that night. I was memorized.  They have a beautiful singing voice. I went home and told my mom about them. The next day (first day of school! I had promised myself I would step out of my shell and make friends that year.) I saw them in the halls and told them how great their singing voice was - then asked for directions to my next class. Turns out they were going there too, and that it was their first year  at this new school as well. We hit it off immediately, they asked if I wanted to sit with them at lunch but I had already agreed to sit with someone else. Imagine my surprise when I walk up to the table and it turns out that's where they sat too. 

We were inseparable. We had so much in common. I thought they were the sweetest, kindest, most talented person ever. I was sort of an angry person back then, if people I didn't know were bothering us (which happened a lot throughout the years. It was highschool.) I would tell them off, but they just dealt with it and handled it with kindness. I honestly think I learned a lot from that behavior. They were an amazing artist, a great singer, a talented writer. I felt so lucky to be their best friend. Unworthy too.

Flashforward to sophomore year - a new kid. I thought she was cute. We hit it off and started dating. This girl was the worst. She cheated on me with another friend in our group and made me feel horrible about myself constantly. Anytime I did something silly or ""annoying"" she would scrunch her face up all disgusted and say ""I can't believe I picked you."" and then turn away. It hurt my feelings a lot - there were a lot of similar behaviors that when addressed would be brushed off as jokes and I just dealt with it because I am very committed to people I care about I guess. It was hurtful and unhealthy. We were on and off until senior year - she moved away a couple times but we mostly kept in contact with a few breaks of no contact after a few ""serious"" fights (I say this in quotes because you know. We were teenagers.)
I feel like after my ex girlfriend was introduced, our friendship started it's downfall. My friend was always very quiet, supportive, and non confrontational. It feels like a lot of the reasons I always ended up around my ex again were because the two of them still hung out, at my sixteenth birthday the three of us shared a bottle of wine and I got a little silly. My ex kept talking about how annoying I was to my friend and when I started to get overwhelmed, asking why they were talking about me like I wasn't there, she kept saying I wasn't even going to remember anything in the morning and she couldn't wait to tell me about how stupid I was acting - to my best friend. I would try and get her to talk to me and she would push me away and say she hated when I ""got like this."" My friend just nodded along and laughed a bit. I felt completely embarrassed and I didn't understand. My 16th birthday was REALLY important to me - at a certain point I decided ""I would never make it to 16"", so I had felt and said a lot that I saw this as marking off my self imposed deadline. It was supposed to be freeing. They hung out with each other and ignored me throughout the day before this drinking stuff happened at night. My girlfriend and I broke up the next day because of it and my best friend left with them because, and I quote ""she needed the support more"", is what they said at the time, but afterwards has always said they thought I wanted to be left alone (even though I specifically remember asking them to stay - but I understand it was embarrassing and easier to blame me.) I say that because all a long the two of US were best friends, at least we were supposed to be. They said we were. 

Senior year this just got worse. The two of them talked about me constantly (my friend showed me texts the year after. Very hurtful.) - I never blamed my friend for this. My ex was genuinely a pathological liar, constantly feigning concern in a way that made me out to be a really bad person and trying to get my friend to cut me off. Things got really bad between us senior year but when my ex spread a huge lie about me, my best friend realized for many reasons that it wasn't true and it felt like we had an opportunity to step away from that after graduation.

 I went through a lot afterwards, I tried to go to college but my mom convinced me to go online because I ""wasn't ready"", which started the worst depressive episode of my life. I felt like no one was there for me and I was constantly miserable. My friend and I didn't hangout much but still talked regularly despite living so close to each other (and they had a car lol) I still hadn't really forgiven them internally for any of the behaviors they exhibited throughout the past few years but I didn't blame them either. We were emotionally manipulated by the same person, and when my ex realized I was pulling away she focused really heavily on my friend and was constantly showering them with love and trying to get them to choose her over me. I don't know if I *can* blame them. Part of me thinks I was just hurt/jealous that my ex cared so much more about them than me, and that's why I couldn't let it go- while we dating the second or third time(I know, I know. I'm embarrassed. I can't help but give people many chances sometimes.) she annotated ""The Song Of Achilles"" for my friend as a Christmas gift saying it reminded her so much of their relationship, nd gave me a rock that she said reminded her of me.. my friend never got me Christmas gifts. Those two spent a lot of time together and left me out a lot. The same happened earlier in our relationship with the friend she cheated on me with but I trusted my best friend a lot and I guess I just had red flag / repeated cycle blindness or something. 

Anyway - tangent there, sorry. Fast forward to I start taking antidepressants after graduating and I get upped from 20 to 50 to 100mg within four weeks /three doctor visits spread two weeks apart each. Ihad a huge breakdown, shaved my head, cut off my immediate family, etc. I moved in with a different friend who lived kind of far away but that was a bad experience. I just wanted to run away from my problems, my best friend visited their sister in a different state and said we should move there one day and it felt like a ticket out to my wacked out brain at the time. I visited them for a week and then ended up moving in with them. 

We lived together for a year. After that experience, I genuinely do feel like I never actually knew them. I was at this horrible place in my life, I was now living five minutes away from my old house, I had stopped taking my antidepressants, I felt constantly miserable, guilty, and disgusted by myself, but they were never there for me and I felt like I was a horrible burden to everyone around me. I closed myself off and just tried to be a good friend who didn't bare all my weight on other people.I felt completely isolated after going through some of the worst experiences of my life, and my now roommate made it very clear that I was living there to support them emotionally. They said a few things early on that I wish I realized we're red flags but I just wanted to be a good friend after they took me in.

A few months after I moved in, and keep in mind we are planning to move to a different state - I decide they should meet a few of my older friends from my old school (before I moved freshman year). This is when we start hanging out with two dudes I was really close with in middle school - one of which was literally my best friend and we had dated for a month in seventh grade. We clicked back together pretty much instantly, picking up right where we left off. It was hard not to fall in love with him, he was so supportive, kind, and caring - I found myself opening up about all of the things I was going through with my family and my mental illness and I wouldn't be where I am in mending the relationships I destroyed after my Antidepressant breakdown if it weren't for him. He made me realize that people who love you are supposed to be there for you when you need them - and I kept saying that to my roommate. I didn't realize it applied to the way I was being treated by them at the time, I just felt so happy, and they understood how horribly my ex treated me. But then -I felt so annoying. Before I started dating him, they would sigh or go silent when I talked about him and I just realized I needed to stop. They seemed to find it funny at first until it became a serious crush. When I started dating him five months after our initial hangout (very cute, too, we had dreams that we smooched each other and confessed.) They rolled their eyes and said ""I knew this was gonna happen."" I thought they had been annoyed before because I was constantly sure he had no interest in me (""who could ever like me mentality"", you know.) and that they were probably just tired of hearing me talk about this ""unrequited"" crush. 

They started acting weird pretty much as soon as he and I started hanging out again, but when we started dating, they eventually broke down on me, sobbing and saying I was never there for them anymore and they needed more from me. They felt like I was abandoning them. For context, this happened after a hangout where we introduced a new friend from our old group, I was definitely preoccupied because I hadn't seen this new friend in a while, and there were five of us altogether. I was also overwhelmed the majority of the night because my roommate ran away and hid in the bathroom for 30 minutes when we went to get pizza from the gas station. I walked in to try and comfort and they were angry and sent me away saying they didn't know what was wrong and just wanted to be alone. They completely shut down the rest of the night, and when we got back I finally sat down to talk to them- they said I barely even looked at them and the night before I had stayed at my boyfriends house for the first time, they told me they cried all night and couldn't sleep because I was gone. 

I tried really hard to help them through this, but, the longer this went on (and after the first time it felt like there were suddenly so many more instances of crying and accusations) I felt like I was excreting so much energy and getting nothing back, not to mention it just wasn't working. They seemed to hate me. When I'd pull away again (I admit I would sort of shut down soemtimes too. I feel guilty. I felt like there was nothing I could do and I didn't have the energy to try.) They would make me feel like I was abandoning them even though we lived together and shared a room (dorm room style), but they never made an attempt to go out and do anything with me either? When I asked them to meet me halfway they accused me of trying to make them do everything and I just felt hopeless. I felt like I was living in limbo.  

Eventually, a little over a year into living together, they walked in on me and my boyfriend making out one morning while I was getting ready to go to work, so I didn't have a shirt on yet.  which was really REALLY embarrassing. They sort of slammed the door shut and then a little bit later I was able to talk to them privately about it, when I apologized for it they immediately just said ""Okay?"" really aggressively and sort of shut down on me. I got a little annoyed, told them we should talk about it later (implying they should stay home, even though my boyfriend and our friend had stayed the night, and the plan was for all of us to go to the coffee shop I worked at so the three of them could hangout and I would make them coffee before the tourist rush.) because I had work, but then we ended up talking in the bathroom a few minutes later while I was finishing getting ready. This conversation ended with me being screamed at. They sent me a (I mean this genuinely) ten minute read of texts about how horrible of a friend I am and how I disgust them and they feel like me and my boyfriend are constantly crawling all over each other. (I'm someone who's really uncomfortable with PDA and have actually told him multiple times I feel awkward being close in front of other people. Which I now realize in huge part was because of the friendship I had with my roommate. So apart from sitting next to each other on the couch, and this instance of being walked in on, some hugging, etc - nothing ever happened. I kid you not I wouldn't even kiss him goodbye when our friends were there, which looking back on i feel sad about. I always wanted to but I was scared of grossing anyone out I guess ) 

The worst thing that I still can't get out of my head (from their long essay of texts) is that they said ""How many times have I lashed out at you like this? Twice?"" (it was more than that) ""Thanks for fucking supporting me when I need it."" - which evidently implies me getting screamed at was my fault for not saying the right things. They were really angry because I had said ""Youre allowed to feel that way, but you can't speak to me like this!"" that morning when they started raising their voice. I think this is the first time I ever stood up for myself against how they were speaking to me, but I know I could have worded it better. I shouldn't tell people how they're ""allowed"" to feel. They repeated that line to me a lot afterwards when I was trying to mend the relationship and I felt so guilty - until I realized it's okay (and healthy) to tell people the way they're speaking to you isn't okay. I still think I could have worded it better and am fully willing to admit I had a part in this argument where I just wasn't being as supportive or wording things as well as I could have been and was honestly trying to be.  

I have thought for a long time that if I understood their side of the story better, I would feel better and be able to fix what I did, but last week I realized I was just repeating the same cycle I had repeated our whole friendship. They would leave me or lash out and I would feel bad for not supporting them enough that they'd want to pick me or stay with me. I wanted THEM to support ME for so long, too, and I always felt like they were so kind that I just didn't deserve to have them there for me. I saw how they treated other people but as their best friend it was my job to be there for them. 

I told them last week that I realized what they did wasn't okay and I wasn't going to mend our relationship by overcompensating for our mistakes by bleeding myself dry wondering how I could be better, and hoping maybe one day I would get an apology if I just sucked it up. I told them we should fully cut contact until we can both process our sides and then hopefully one day we could work on fixing this. I really love and care about them - but they told me they had healed, and I just had a ""warped view of them"" which was ""disgusting"" , that all they ever did was try to comfort me and avoid fights, but that I would clearly always see them as a horrible person, and ""after 6 years I thought you'd know me better than this. Obviously I didn't know you either. Don't reach out again."" 

They have repeated the ""After 6 years"" thing a lot. They texted my boyfriend after we fought complaining about me and telling him my perseption of what happened was wrong and whatever I told him wasn't true while I was at work (mind you after being screamed at I just came downstairs, told him and our friend I didn't want to talk about it (because of course they heard) and I had just said the wrong thing when my friend needed support, and moved on. I would handle it later and I felt really bad.)  Again, they repeated the 6 years thing to both of them and to myself repeatedly. 
The ""I have healed / Don't reach out again."" Was a real punch to the gut. It feels like after all this time of wishing they'd apologize for the things they said to me, they're telling me I don't deserve one because they have gotten over it and I should have to. They didn't care enough to share their side, hear me out, apologize, or reconnect afterwards, but they kept contact and told me they loved me and missed me and stuff. They nodded and agreed when I would tell them I should have been better. I was useless to them and they gave up. Moved on. Freshman year feels like it was our only good year and I don't remember any of it - but I still love them so much. I don't know how to get over it like they have. I wish they wanted to fix this.

 I know I have to take their actions and words at face value and just move on. I'm in college with my boyfriend and I feel like I have been really struggling to make friends because of this. I have felt so isolated and alone despite being at the best point in my life I've ever been! I live with someone who loves and supports me, always makes room for me, and makes sure I feel heard and understood. We hangout with other people and his friends are awesome! This is my freshman year but their junior year, because I took a two year gap. I know they're all nice people but I'm just scared of them. Scared of getting too close to people I guess - I feel like I'll always be a hindrance. My best friend dropped me so easily and it made me feel unlikeable. I feel annoying and gross. I don't know. I know that nothing they could say would fix this and the real issue is the way it affected me, not the friendship I'm missing. That's a part too though. I want to go back and fix it but there isn't anything I could have done. I just don't know how to move forward or start loving myself again. I'm a huge believer that there's two sides to every story, but I'm tired of feeling like if I could just figure out their side id realize how it actually WAS all my fault and I'd be able to get better and move past it. I don't know. I don't know where to go from here - I blocked them on everything after they reacted to my attempt at being honest about how I felt and asking for space, but I've had some weird dreams and big cries about it. I loved them a lot. I don't know if they felt the same or how to move past it. Logically I know it says more about them than it does about me - that I shouldn't take it personally... but that's easier said than done I guess.  ",1,1733738782.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1ha6eyb,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ha6eyb/the_apartment_we_wont_share/,The apartment we won't share.,"So there's this trend where people post 2 screenshots with different context. The first one shows sweet conversation with their ex (like dreaming of living together) and the second one conveys farewell or an ending of their relationship.

I remember when my ex and I used to dream about living in an apartment together. We imagined waking up under the same bed, taking 5 more minutes before prepping to work. Wandering around the city in our first car. Having ourselves a good cup of coffee in the balcony while witnessing the beauty of the sun in the west goes down. 

It's scary to think that some things talaga won't go our way no matter how hard we try to make them align and we might as well end up getting hurt by the love we believed would last. But sometimes yes, some things have to end. It had to end because it may not be what we wanted to happen, but perhaps deep down inside, it was something that we needed.

All stimulants are considered illegal drugs. And this will hardly ever change. So I just wanted to say how happy I am for all
of you who are able to get treatment — I will never know how it feels like, even though I'm diagnosed. The closest thing I have to it is tea and coffee. And that is definitely not enough for my brain. 🥲

My question is if any of you are medication-free for any reason, then what are your strategies? I am currently unemployed because my ADHD makes it impossible for me to work a typical job. I feel totally disabled. My therapist retired recently and it's really hard to find someone who specializes in adult ADHD here.

Any tips on surviving with unmedicated ADHD will be appreciated. Hope

I have it do decent coffee using grind just a bit coarser than my espresso setting. Regardless if I use James Hoffman's ""recipe"" or not, results are ok and pretty consistent.

I also have couple of stainless steel pots (one venus and one from WMF) and few more aluminum ones.  They have the same consistency as the classic bialetti. No issues with whatever supermarket pre-ground coffee I throw at them. I also have espresso machine. When at home I use quality beans & single-dose grind them. When away (1/3 of the time) I use preground lavazza or kimbo. Overall, pretty wide variation in conditions and equipment, but result has been fairly consistent day after day, location after location, pot after pot. 

Decided to upscale with a bigger pot and decided to go for stainless steel. Bought the Alessi 9090 as I love the shape and the handle lock. Immediately noticed the boiler bottom is very thin compared to other stainless steel pots I've used. 

Problem is (yes, finally) — I can't get it to work consistently. Today did two batches within 1h and while the first was OK, the second was weak (literally thin) and foamy. I suspect I also heard the pressure release valve hiss, but not 100% sure.

So, first — weak & foamy coffee — what's your guess, what's going on here?

Second, anyone else with the same pot here? Any advice? I suspect there's something specific to the pot itself happening here.

I’m into running, meditation, contemporary art, underground techno and rave scenes (European style, not EDM and trap — sorry, Americans), healthy cooking, self-care practices, and long walks (I love walking for hours, especially with my dog). My interests also include marketing, writing, journaling, CBT therapy, art-house movies, jazz, generative art (I’d love to learn TouchDesigner), avant-garde fashion, gorpcore, hiking, Chinese ceremonial tea, specialty coffee, architecture, and minimalist/maximalist design.

I’m not much of a gamer but occasionally enjoy my Nintendo Switch for Mario or Zelda. I’m also considering learning a new language, though I haven’t decided yet — maybe Japanese, Chinese, or German.

As for me, I’m queer but don’t actually identify with the “community.” I’m still exploring what that means for me.

I’m open to connecting with anyone — let’s give it a shot, it doesn’t hurt to try. I’m especially open to people from Georgia, Kazakhstan, Poland, etc., as long as you’re anti-imperialist (you know what I mean).

My partner and I are just finishing a week in Athens, and we absolutely loved it! We were worried we wouldn’t after reading people’s experiences who didn’t like the city, but we loved it, so for future travelers, here’s the type of person we are and what we loved about it. 

About us: we don’t try to pack the days super full when we vacation. We love to get a place with a patio, drink our coffee leisurely and enjoy a view, and see a couple of sites per day with lots of time for patios, people watching, and wandering around with no destination. We love to walk a ton. We’re from a big city, and aren’t intimidated by homelessness, graffiti etc. We’re off season travelers and take most of our trips in winter to avoid crowds. 
What we loved: we stayed right in the Plaka, in an Airbnb with a big patio. We loved walking the tiny streets and finding something new every time. Every tiny street you turn onto, there’s more to see. In terms of being able to walk everywhere you want to go, this is the best trip we’ve ever taken! We loved all the tiny patio cafes, and we tried something different everywhere we went. I also went on several runs by myself before and after dark and never felt nervous at all. We also walked outside the tourist area to the archaeological museum and that was also fine. I also really love architecture and loved learning about the different styles in Athens. Hopefully this gives people an idea of how they’ll feel! We almost made our time in the city shorter due to fear we wouldn’t like it, but we could’ve easily entertained ourselves longer than we did.

During those six years, I lived away from home, working for extra cash entirely on my own. I never came back, nor did I contact anyone from here. I just couldn’t bring myself to.

Jamie was like a scar on my heart. Until my wings were strong enough, I didn’t dare reopen that wound—I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to handle it.

My mother still lived in the same apartment. She was only in her forties, but years of late nights playing cards and an undisciplined lifestyle had left her bloated and prematurely aged. Her youthful beauty was long gone.

When she opened the door and saw me, she froze. For a full minute, she just stared. Then, wiping her tears with a rough hand, she said bitterly, “So, you’re finally back. I was starting to think you’d forgotten you had a mother. Jamie would’ve never abandoned me like this. He cared. If only he were still here…”

“He’s been gone for six years,” I interrupted coldly.

Stepping into the apartment again, I felt the weight of everything that had changed—or maybe everything that hadn’t.

My mom dried her tears and suddenly brightened, ushering me toward the couch. “You’re back, that’s what matters! After all these years in school, you’ve finally made something of yourself. Now I can count on you.”

I glanced at the couch, piled high with dirty laundry, and instead sat at the dining table. As she busied herself making me a drink, I stopped her. “There’s no need for that. I’m only here to ask one thing. When you sent Jamie to live with Delilah, did you tell her about his nut allergy?”

“Of course, I did!” Her eyes flared with indignation. “I told her over and over—no nuts! Peanuts, almonds, cashews, anything like that. Delilah said she understood. And Jamie was twelve! He knew better, too—he was always careful.”

I didn’t respond. Ignoring her pleas for me to stay, I left with only one thing: a photo of Jamie on his twelfth birthday, the one I had taken. In it, he was smiling, his crescent-shaped eyes full of joy, showing off his small, perfect teeth.

I had a copy, but I couldn’t bear to leave the original behind in that place.

I arranged to meet my dad at a café. He looked much the same—men really do age better.

“It was an accident,” he said hastily as soon as we sat down, as if eager to absolve himself. “I told our housekeeper, Amanda, that Jamie couldn’t have any nuts. But that day, she made macarons, left it on the table, and forgot to warn Jamie. He ate it without knowing. The next morning, Amanda found him in his room…”

“And you? You didn’t notice anything unusual the night before?” I couldn’t stop myself from asking.

He avoided my eyes. “I wasn’t home. I had a dinner meeting. Your stepmother said Jamie seemed fine after dinner, except for a little rash on his face. He didn’t say he felt sick—just went to bed like usual.”

I stirred my coffee, the spoon clinking against the cup, but my heart felt like it was being crushed in someone’s grip.

How terrible must it be to suffocate to death alone? Did Jamie struggle through the night by himself? Did he call out for help? Did he try to call me, his sister?

These questions, the ones I had avoided for six years, now flooded over me like a tidal wave, drowning me.

“After it happened, Delilah immediately laid off Amanda,” my dad emphasized again. “It truly was an accident. Your stepmother and sister both adored Jamie. When he passed, Bella cried the hardest.”

I took a sip of my coffee. It was bitter, but not nearly as bitter as the memories. I forced a calm smile, swallowing down the storm of emotions. “Dad, let’s not dwell on the past. It’s painful for both of us.”

He visibly relaxed. “You’re right. No point in dwelling on it. So, what are your plans now that you’re back?”

I gave him a small smile. “I majored in finance management. I’d like to work at your company.”",3,1733736702.0,stories,1,1.0,False
1ha62dq,https://www.reddit.com/r/KaffeBox/comments/1ha62dq/day_9_amateur_review/,Day 9. Amateur review,"To preface today’s review, I want to reflect on a key point from yesterday’s post: the profound impact of grind size. As mentioned in the UPD, just **five clicks** on the Comandante grinder completely transformed the brew and the resulting coffee experience. It’s a stark reminder of how tiny variables can lead to vastly different outcomes.

This brings us to an important realization about coffee: the journey we’re experiencing with this advent calendar is incredibly non-deterministic. Think about it—each of us brews coffee under different conditions: mornings or afternoons, relaxed or rushed, using different water, grinders, and routines. Each detail can amplify or mute specific notes, turning a universally praised cup into something puzzling—or vice versa.

The takeaway? Don’t let any review or tasting notes dictate your experience. Taste, explore, and most importantly, enjoy. If a cup doesn’t resonate with you, move on. It’s perfectly okay to admit that something isn’t to your liking.

With that in mind, here’s my experience with today’s pick. Your journey might be completely different—and that’s part of the magic!

https://preview.redd.it/frui4xa3ls5e1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b4b1c6fb46159b07bc8dd56e0e398f750386e9a8

**BREW:**

Since the site’s brewing instructions were vague, and I was out of Wave filters, I opted for the Origami brewer with its filter and my preferred recipe:

* Brewer: Origami with Origami filter
* Ratio: 1:16(16/256)
* Grind size: 22 clicks on Comandante
* Water: 94c
* Protocol:
   * Start with 50g for the bloom. Swirl to hydrate all the grounds
   * 0:45: pour 50g (up to 100g total)
   * 01:30 pour 50g (up to 150g total)
   * 02:15 slowly pour 106g (up to 256g total). Slight swirl to even out the bed
   * **TBT**: 04:15

**ROAST:**

[Day 8 \(left\) vs Day 9 \(right\)](https://preview.redd.it/46clnyl0ls5e1.jpg?width=3410&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=84310c5aebadbcfe22ab1873a87de54626a173a2)

Slightly darker than yesterday’s Kenyan pick, the roast is still light enough to allow the coffee’s natural characteristics to shine. What’s more intriguing is the **small bean size** of this Ethiopian heirloom varietal. It’s a glimpse into how coffee might look before hybrids and high-yield selections became the norm.

**AROMA:**

* **From the Canister**: Sweet, buttery, and confectionery-like, with a distinctive note of tahini or halva that I couldn’t unsee once detected.
* **Ground**: Rich dark chocolate, buttery sweetness leaning toward caramelized almonds.
* **Brewed**: The aroma transforms with fruity notes like peach and grapes joining the buttery confectionary sweetness.

**TASTE:**

The cup is **fruity, smooth, and buttery**, with a richness that’s both satisfying and mellow. A subtle bitterness, almost like lemon zest, provides an unexpected background note. Thankfully, it’s restrained, keeping the cup balanced.

There’s a tea-like mouthfeel with flavors reminiscent of **blackberry**, a hint of **caramel sweetness**, and a noticeable **buttery smoothness**. However, I found the cup slightly astringent despite it not feeling under-extracted. This is something I’ll adjust for in the next brew.

  
**ADDITIONAL NOTES:**

From what I’ve read about the **Kurume varietal from Sidama**, it’s known for being intensely fruity and floral. Interestingly, my cup leaned more toward buttery sweetness than the vibrant fruit and floral notes often associated with Ethiopian coffees. While the fruits were present, they felt more like a harmonious orchestra than distinct soloists.

That said, I enjoyed the balance. The buttery richness felt perfect for a cold December morning. For those in warmer climates, this cup might come across differently, but that’s the beauty of coffee—it’s shaped as much by the drinker as it is by the beans.

Would I love to taste these beans at their absolute peak freshness? Absolutely. I suspect they would shine even brighter. But part of the joy of this advent journey is sampling a wide array of coffees, each offering a sneak peek into the diversity of the coffee world.

Interesting fact: Ethiopia’s wild coffee forests are home to over 6,000 unique coffee varieties—many of which are still undiscovered!

I find that the milk-based drinks from this De'Longhi machine feel like plain coffee with milk, topped with big, airy foam? Beneath the foam, there’s no creamy texture—just regular milk. 😔

Does anyone else feel the same? 

I’ve already packaged the machine for return, but before finalizing that decision, I wanted to double-check with others. Could I be doing something wrong? For example:

I used 3.5% fat milk instead of the 1.5% that De'Longhi recommends. Could that be the issue?

I’ve only made about 5–6 milk-based drinks so far. Should I have experimented more before deciding?

Is this type of result—coffee with milk at the bottom and airy foam on top—just how super-automatic machines work?

Were my expectations too high, thinking I’d get café-style cappuccinos at home, with creamy, thick microfoam?

Could it be that I used the wrong milk carafe setting?


I’m seriously considering returning it because I feel I can achieve similar results by simply foaming milk myself and pouring it over regular coffee. But I don’t want to make the wrong call if I’ve overlooked something. So… is it just me?

1ha61yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTheTraveler/comments/1ha61yf/where_to_eat_zion_national_park/,Where to eat Zion National Park?,"Hey fellow travelers! I recently got back from an amazing trip to Zion National Park, and I can't stop thinking about the incredible food scene there. I know planning where to eat during your Zion adventure can be tricky, so I wanted to share my favorite spots and some local gems I discovered.

Before I dive in, quick tip: if you're planning your Zion trip, check out https://athometouch.com/zionpark for some awesome tour packages and activities. I booked my guided hike through them and it was totally worth it.

Now, let's talk food! The town of Springdale (right outside Zion) has some seriously good restaurants. My absolute favorite was Whiptail Grill, housed in an old gas station. Their fish tacos are insane, and the southwestern vibe is perfect after a day of hiking Angels Landing.

Bit of a splurge, but Bit & Spur Restaurant & Saloon is a must-visit. The chile verde is to die for, and they have this amazing prickly pear margarita. The outdoor patio has stunning views of the red rocks - perfect for sunset dining.

For breakfast, MeMe's Cafe saved my life multiple times. Their breakfast burritos are massive and exactly what you need before tackling the Narrows. Plus, their coffee is actually good (which can be rare in small towns).

If you're on a budget or need a quick bite, Sol Foods Supermarket has great sandwiches and snacks. I grabbed their lunch boxes for a few hikes, and they were perfect trail food.

Oscar's Cafe is another local favorite - their guacamole burger is legendary among hikers. The portions are huge, so you might want to share if you're planning more hiking afterward.

Quick heads up - during peak season (March-October), restaurants get super busy. Make reservations where possible, especially for dinner. Also, many places close earlier than you might expect, so check closing times.

By the way, if you're still planning your Zion itinerary, definitely check out https://athometouch.com/zionpark. They have some great food tours too, which I wish I'd known about before my trip.

Finally, don't forget to try some local Utah specialties like honey whole wheat bread (many restaurants serve it) and Utah scones (they're different from regular scones - more like fry bread).

Has anyone else eaten at these places? Would love to hear your recommendations too!",1,1733736574.0,AskTheTraveler,0,1.0,False

1ha5yjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/VikingLife/comments/1ha5yjt/viking_round_shield_construction_for_western/,Viking round shield construction for western style fighting,"Hello all. I thought I'd do a short writeup of how I constructed my viking shield for western style Viking reenactment combat.

To start with, before anyone mentions it. Yes, I do know this shield is not completely historically correct. In ye'olden days they used wood planks, rawhide on the front and sometimes metal decorations. The also tapered in thickness from ca 8mm in the center to 4mm on the edges. But the goal is not to create a historically correct shield, but rather something that is relatively light-weight and intended for western style fighting with blunt weapons. The shield should also be cheapish to construct since it is intended to protect me from blows from steel weapons and thus will suffer wear and tear.

Now with that out of the way :)

The first step is something we usually do at our group here in Iceland, we measure the size of the shield from the closed fist out to about an inch beyond your elbow. In this case it was 78cm so I went with that. Some like smaller shields and some like larger. I am used to a 74cm shield so this will be a bit of a change for me. 2cm extra in radius does not sound like a lot, but when you are swinging it around and are used to the smaller size it will feel huge.

I bought a 4mm wooden board and cut out a circular shield shape from there, as well as a circle from the center for my hand and shield boss. After this I covered the whole shield in wood glue and linen. This serves to stiffen the shield a bit and make it resistant to damage. It adds a bit of weight but makes for a world of difference. With the help of a friend (Gummi, who helped me a LOT with the handle, ribs and boss, seen in one of the photos below) a metal shield boss was attached. I went with the ""sword catcher"" variety since I like practicing active shield and that extra lip on the boss is very useful in manipulating the opponents shield and weapons.

See photo of me holding the shield in this state (I am holding it closer to the camera so it appears larger than it is):
https://imgur.com/a/O2rxQf1

As a part of this step a handle was shaped and attached. We felt that since the shield is a bit on the thinner side (4mm) it would need a bit of bracing. This style is not something that has been found in archaeology from the time, but some bracing has been found so this works fine.

See image of Gummi showing the back-side of the shield:
https://imgur.com/a/wObjY3X

The shield feels lighter than my old 74cm one (which is made of 8mm wood, and thus the wood is approx. 2 times heavier). And the added bracing does wonders for stiffening up the shield. I use my shield partly to grab and punch the opponents shield so hopefully this is enough for it to last a long time.

The next step was to paint the shield. I painted it in our reenactment groups, Rimmugýgur's, colors (white on black, three axes and a white circle, see pic below).

And finally, the last step was to attach rawhide to the edge of the shield to further strengthen it and protect it from blows to the edge which might damage it. We used to use nails to fasten the rawhide (which we get from dog-bones, the rawhide ones that dogs get to chew. Works great), but now we have our sessions in a gymnasium where kids sometimes run around barefoot. This means that nails are not ideal, so we have taken to sewing the leather to the shields. So during a Saturday evening I just put on a podcast, had some coffee and started working on this step. To sew leather to a shield the process is:

1. Soak the leather in water for a few hours. It is good to unfurl the leather from the bone shape at some point so water can penetrate better.

2. Take the leather out of the water, dry it off a bit and cut into strips. Let them sit for half an hour up to an hour. It is easier to work with the leather when it is not completely soaked.

3. Clamp the leather to the edges. I bought some mini-clamps for this.

4. Drill a hole through leather and wood with regular intervals, and sew as you go. The instinct might be to just drill all the holes at once and then sew later but the spacing can change a bit as you tighten the thread so it is cleaner to just drill approx. ten holes, sewing them and then moving on.

5. Clean up any excess leather with scissors or a knife. Let dry completely.

This is a pretty tedious process and takes time (3 hours in my case), but it is worth it. The end result looks better to me than when I nail the leather.

see the final result here:
https://imgur.com/a/3phDbpY

Now that this shield is finished it is time to move on to other projects. A buckler perhaps, or a 74cm shield as well. Perhaps a thicker and simpler one for show-fighting. Maybe sewing a cloak. In this hobby/lifestyle the todo list is endless :)",2,1733736120.0,VikingLife,0,1.0,False

1. “Small Business, Big Impact!”

Alright, let’s get real: being a small business is like being the underdog in a boxing match. You’ve got heart, passion, and killer products, but your marketing punches don’t always land because, well, budget. Enter motion graphics, your secret weapon. These little animated masterpieces pack the same punch as big-budget ads without knocking out your wallet.


---

2. “What Are Motion Graphics Anyway? Cartoon Commercials?”

Hold up, let’s clear this up—motion graphics aren’t cartoons. They’re the Beyoncé of design: classy, captivating, and they’ll steal the show. Think sleek animations, moving text, and visuals that turn heads faster than free coffee at a networking event. Motion graphics take your business message and deliver it with style, clarity, and just the right amount of flair.


---

3. “Why Static Images Are Like Yesterday’s Donuts”

Sure, a static image can work, but it’s kind of like offering stale donuts at the office—meh. Motion graphics, on the other hand, are the fresh Krispy Kremes of marketing. They grab attention, spark curiosity, and get people talking. Plus, they look way cooler in a social media feed than yet another “SALE!” post with Comic Sans font (please, no).

4. “Explainers, but Make Them Entertaining”

You know how every small business struggles to explain what they do in under 30 seconds? “Well, we’re kind of like X, but not exactly like Y, and sometimes we also do Z.” Cue the confused stares. With motion graphics, you can break down complex ideas in a way that’s clear, fun, and so engaging that people actually want to watch. It’s like turning your elevator pitch into a Netflix mini-series.

5. “Boost That Brand Without Breaking the Bank”

Here’s the best part: motion graphics are budget-friendly for small businesses. You don’t need Hollywood-level money to make a big splash. Whether it’s a 10-second Instagram reel or a full-blown explainer video, motion graphics can give your brand a polished, professional edge that says, “We mean business.” And trust me, your audience will notice.

6. “How Motion Graphics Put the ‘Mo’ in Momentum”

Small businesses thrive on momentum—whether it’s building brand awareness, attracting new customers, or getting that one elusive Google review that isn’t just “Great job!” Motion graphics create that momentum by making your content impossible to ignore. They’re the little engine that could (and does) drive engagement, clicks, and sales.


---

7. “So, What’s the Motion Graphic Move for You?”

Whether you’re showcasing a new product, explaining your services, or just flexing your brand’s personality, motion graphics can do it all. And the best part? They work for any industry. So if you’re still debating whether motion graphics are right for your small business, here’s your answer: Yes. Always yes.

With a bit of strategy and creativity, you can create a stylish and welcoming space while staying within your budget. Whether you’re shopping for a [rattan dining armchair](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/oslo-dining-rattan-chair), functional [bar stools](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture/living-room-furniture/bar-stools), or versatile pieces from a [garden furniture store](https://beta.homeandsouldubai.com/product-category/shop/furniture/outdoor-furniture), here are some tips to help you get the best deals and achieve the look you desire.

# 1. Set a Clear Budget

Before you start shopping, determine how much you’re willing to spend on your [home furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture). A clear budget will keep you focused and help you avoid overspending. Break your budget down by room or furniture type, so you know exactly where to allocate your funds.

# 2. Prioritize Multifunctional Furniture

Invest in furniture that serves multiple purposes. For example, opt for a rattan dining armchair that can double as extra seating in your living room or **bar stools** that fit perfectly at your kitchen counter and outdoor bar. Multipurpose pieces maximize functionality and save money in the long run.

# 3. Shop at the Right Stores

Explore local stores and online retailers that specialize in affordable furniture options. A **garden furniture store** can be a hidden gem for finding stylish outdoor and indoor pieces. From chic patio sets to versatile **home furniture**, these stores often offer deals that are hard to beat.

# 4. Consider Rattan Furniture

Rattan furniture is not only trendy but also budget-friendly and durable. Whether you’re looking for a **rattan dining armchair** or a stylish coffee table, this material adds a touch of sophistication to your space without a hefty price tag. It’s also lightweight and easy to move, making it ideal for flexible living arrangements.

# 5. Hunt for Sales and Discounts

Keep an eye out for seasonal sales, like White Friday or end-of-year clearances. Many furniture retailers, including **garden furniture stores**, offer significant discounts during these times. Sign up for newsletters to stay informed about upcoming sales and exclusive deals.

# 6. Mix High and Low

Pair high-quality statement pieces with budget-friendly options. For example, invest in a durable dining table and complement it with affordable **rattan dining armchairs** or **bar stools**. This strategy helps you achieve a balanced, stylish look without overspending.

# 7. DIY and Upcycling

Get creative with second-hand furniture. A fresh coat of paint or new upholstery can transform pre-loved items into stunning pieces for your home. You can often find great deals at thrift stores or flea markets and add your personal touch for a unique look.

# 8. Choose Timeless Designs

Invest in furniture with timeless appeal rather than trendy pieces that may go out of style quickly. For instance, **rattan dining armchairs** and wooden **bar stools** have classic designs that blend seamlessly with various aesthetics, ensuring longevity in your home.

# 9. Measure Your Space

Before purchasing any **home furniture**, measure your space to ensure it fits perfectly. Buying furniture that doesn’t fit your room’s dimensions can lead to costly mistakes. Always have your room dimensions on hand when shopping.

# 10. Think Outdoor-Inspired Furniture

Don’t overlook outdoor furniture for your indoor spaces. Many items from a **garden furniture store**, like weather-resistant chairs or tables, can work beautifully inside your home. These pieces are often more affordable and add a unique touch to your interiors.

**Final Thoughts**

Creating a stylish home on a budget is all about smart shopping and thoughtful design. From versatile **rattan dining armchairs** to durable **bar stools**, the key is to invest in pieces that offer both functionality and aesthetic appeal. Remember to shop at sales, mix high and low-priced items, and always measure your space before making a purchase. With these tips, you’ll transform your home into a chic and welcoming haven without overspending.

My ppt was something worked over for a week, I tried to cover all aspects and added all necessary diagrams.



So maybe by that time the panelists were tired or were uninterested, like the two people seeing presentation, one was drinking coffee, he drank 2 mugs full in front of me, and the other was frequently attending phone calls, meanwhile I am giving my presentation, they questioned me hardly for 1-2 times and they had no interest with whatever I was saying.



And now after a week the results are announced, they declared some random guys, who upon checking my colleges google drive folder of ppts, I found one of these guy barely made a 2 slide ppt like is it even something to be presented????

Further discussing with my friends I found that jo logo ka selection hua hai unka presentation subeh ke time hua thaa, like lunch ke pehle!

So were we all fools to present them, that our chance came late, and the panelists were least interested in my ideas and listening for the sake of completing all presentations??

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become a popular cosmetic procedure for those seeking a brighter smile. Many people are curious about the impact of teeth whitening, especially when comparing results before and after treatments. Understanding what to expect can make the decision to undergo this procedure much easier. Here’s a look at the real results of teeth whitening and what you can anticipate.

Before diving into the specifics, it's important to know that teeth whitening is not a one-size-fits-all solution. The effectiveness can vary based on several factors such as the type of whitening method used, the original shade of your teeth, and your dental hygiene habits.

### Common Teeth Whitening Methods

There are several prominent methods for whitening teeth, each yielding different results:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Treatments:** Conducted by dental professionals, these treatments often provide immediate results. They use stronger bleaching agents that can lighten teeth several shades in one session.
- **At-Home Kits:** These kits, provided by dental professionals or available over the counter, usually include custom trays and lower concentrations of bleaching agents. They can take longer to produce results, typically over a few weeks.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** These can help remove surface stains but generally have limited effects on deep discoloration.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some people turn to baking soda or hydrogen peroxide as DIY solutions. However, their effectiveness can be inconsistent, and caution is advised to prevent damage to enamel.

### Teeth Whitening Results: A Before and After Look

When considering teeth whitening, visualizing the “before” and “after” can be motivating. Many users report significant changes in the brightness and color of their teeth post-treatment.

Before whitening, teeth may show signs of discoloration due to various factors:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Coffee, tea, and red wine consumption
- Smoking or tobacco use
- Age-related yellowing
- Medications like tetracycline can lead to staining

After completing a whitening treatment, users often share impressive transformations, such as:

- A brighter, more radiant smile

- **Maintenance is Key:** After treatment, maintaining oral hygiene is crucial. Regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups will help prolong the effects of whitening.
- **Stains May Recur:** Factors like diet and lifestyle can impact the longevity of your results. Staying away from stain-causing foods and drinks can help keep your teeth brighter for longer.
- **Possible Sensitivity:** Some individuals may experience tooth sensitivity during or after treatment. Always consult your dentist if this is a concern.

### Final Thoughts on Teeth Whitening

Teeth whitening treatments can lead to remarkable transformations, as seen in various before and after pictures shared by satisfied clients. When you're contemplating brightening your smile, consider the methods available and set practical expectations based on your natural tooth color and lifestyle.

Safe Practices for Achieving Effective Teeth Whitening: Tips and Tricks
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Achieving a brighter smile is a common goal for many people. Teeth whitening has gained popularity due to its ability to enhance your smile's appearance.

### Understand Your Options

Before starting any teeth whitening process, take time to understand the options available. Each method has different strengths and limitations:

- **Professional Whitening:** This is done by a dentist and often provides the most dramatic results. Dentists use stronger whitening agents, ensuring safety and effectiveness.
- **At-Home Kits:** Many at-home whitening kits are available over-the-counter. These can be effective, but it’s vital to follow instructions carefully to avoid overuse.
- **Whitening Toothpastes:** These contain mild abrasives and chemical agents designed to gently remove stains. While they can lighten teeth, results are often subtle and gradual.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some people opt for baking soda or activated charcoal. While these methods can help remove surface stains, they may not provide significant whitening.

### Consult Your Dentist

Before you begin any whitening treatment, consult your dentist. They can assess your dental health and recommend suitable options based on your needs. This step is critical as certain dental conditions, like cavities or gum disease, need addressing before whitening can be safely done.

### Follow Instructions Carefully

Whether you choose a professional treatment or at-home methods, following the provided instructions is crucial. Overusing whitening products can lead to tooth sensitivity or damage. Stick to the recommended use for best results.

### Monitor Your Goals

Setting realistic expectations is essential. Understand that the degree of whitening can vary by person and method. Take “before and after” pictures to track your progress, as this can motivate you and clarify the effects of your chosen method.

### Stay Persistent with Good Oral Hygiene

Your everyday oral hygiene routine plays a significant role in maintaining whiteness. Here are some tips to enhance your dental care:

- **Brush Twice Daily:** Use fluoride toothpaste and brush for at least two minutes to ensure you're removing any plaque and surface stains.
- **Floss Daily:** Flossing removes food particles and plaque between teeth, where your toothbrush might not reach.
- **Use Mouthwash:** An antibacterial mouthwash helps reduce plaque and maintain oral health, contributing to whiter teeth over time.

### Avoid Teeth-Staining Foods

Be mindful of what you eat and drink. Certain foods and drinks can stain your teeth, making it harder to maintain a brighter smile. Consider limiting:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- Coffee and tea
- Red wine
- Soda
- Berries

If you consume these regularly, try rinsing your mouth with water afterward or brushing your teeth if possible.

### Stay Hydrated and Choose Water

Drinking water is essential for overall health and aids in keeping your teeth white. It helps wash away food particles and sugars that can cause staining. Opting for water instead of sugary drinks can significantly benefit your dental health.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Consider Professional Touch-Ups

If you're using at-home whitening products and find your results tapering off, consider returning to your dentist for touch-ups. A professional might use a different technique or product that provides a needed boost in brightness.

### Be Patient and Enjoy Your Smile

Teeth whitening may take time, depending on the technique used. Stay patient and persistent in your routine. Remember that the journey to a whiter smile can lift your confidence and enhance your overall appearance.

Teeth whitening can be an effective way to achieve a more dazzling smile. By understanding your options, following safe practices, and committing to good dental habits, you can enjoy the benefits of a brighter smile while keeping your dental health in tip-top shape.

1ha5b8z,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ha5b8z/im_frequently_asked_about_investing_by_friends/,"I’m frequently asked about investing by friends and family that are interested but nervous. I typed this up as a broad summary to try to help them out. Any thoughts before I share? This is kind of a rough draft, I feel I’m missing a couple things. Disclosure is satire. ","Investing and general financial planning 
I often get questions from friends and family about why investing is important and how to get started. I wish I started earlier than I did as I’d be ahead of where I am now but hindsight is 20/20. Many people hesitate to invest due to fears of losing their hard-earned money. However, investing is a crucial step toward securing financial independence, achieving long-term goals, and even retiring early (especially considering that pension funds are often inaccessible until age 55 or later).

Why does investing matter?
Over the long term, financial markets have historically delivered annualized returns of 7–10%, despite short-term fluctuations. For example, since I began investing in 2018, my portfolio has grown by 60%. While I experienced a 10% drop during the March 2020 market downturn, I knew the market would recover and invested more during the dip. This decision has since resulted in doubling my investment made during 2020. 

Investing is for anyone and everyone, you don’t need to be wealthy. If you think you don’t have the money to invest but you get a $10 coffee every day or $10 pack of cigarettes, if you made that coffee at home or quit smoking and invested that $10 daily at 8% average market return over 40 years you’d have put in $4800 and have earned $30,000 in the market for an ending total of $35,000. This is just a small example of a minor lifestyle change that can greatly compound over time. It’s about starting small and building over time. When I hesitantly began investing, I started with $10,000, occasionally added more, and eventually set up automated investments of about 20% of my income. This “set it and forget it” approach allows me to focus on other aspects of life while growing wealth. 

Getting started
emergency fund: Keep 3–6 months of living expenses in a high-yield savings account. This ensures liquidity and protects you from selling investments at a loss during emergencies or job loss/injury. High-yield accounts also help your cash savings grow and combat inflation. Just think if you leave you money in most banks paying little to no interest you are losing approximately 3% every year in purchasing power. 

Choose an investment strategy: For beginners and even many seasoned investors, I recommend a globally diversified fund like Vanguard’s VT (Total World Stock Market Index). It automatically rebalances based on global market performance. Personally, while taking on a small amount more risk of volatility I hold the majority of my portfolio in the S&P 500 (VOO) while adding some exposure to small-cap value stocks (AVUV) and international markets (IXUS/IGRO). Remember past performance does not guarantee future performance and to pay attention to expense ratios while picking funds to invest in, index funds like VT, VTI, VOO, IXUS will always be cheaper than an actively managed portfolio and perform better 90% of the time (remember when thinking about a fund that the fees are guaranteed but performance is not), index funds are also more tax efficient (tax efficiency only matters in a taxable brokerage account, not a concern in an IRA)

Pick a brokerage: I recommend Fidelity Investments for its ease of use, lack of fees, and exceptional features. Fidelity’s offerings include:
-Cash Management Account: Free check writing, no account minimums, unlimited ATM fee reimbursements (domestic and international), no foreign transaction fees, ~4.5% yield on idle cash as of 12/24, you can have multiple and use one as checking and one as savings, can edit the names in your portfolio (all under one login). 
-Brokerage Account: Automated investments, fractional share purchasing, and competitive money market rates (~4.5% as of 12/24).
-Roth IRA: Even if your income exceeds direct contribution limits, you can use a “backdoor Roth IRA” by contributing to a traditional IRA and converting it to a Roth IRA as soon as the next day.

Maximize Rewards and Manage Credit Responsibly:
-Use a credit card, like Fidelity’s 2% cash-back card, or a travel card of your choice to earn rewards and deposit directly into brokerage to help fund your investments or to reduce travel costs with points (more to invest if your travel is covered by points). Always pay off balances in full to avoid interest charges.
-Avoid using debit cards for purchases; credit cards provide better fraud protection and offer rewards for everyday spending.

Create a Financial Plan
-Write down your financial goals and develop a plan to achieve them. My plan includes:
Allocating 80% of my investments to U.S. equities, 10% to international equities (I use IXUS, IGRO, and schy), 5% to dividend funds for stability and income (SCHD, DGRO or VIG, and VYM are good ones), 5% in cash  (hysa or money market) for immediate expenses, bill pay, and emergencies— your cash percentage may need to be adjusted to make sure you keep 3-6 months of expenses liquid, also think about using VT as a core position rather than what I have going on to simplify things, one could also use VTI/VXUS at their own desired ratios if they want more or less foreign investments (VTI is total us stock market appx. 85% sp500 and 15% mid and small cap, vxus is total international market which includes appx 70% developed markets like Europe and Canada and others but excludes US and 30% emerging markets like China and India that are growing economically.)
-Continuously (sometimes weekly, sometimes annually, depending on free time) rebalancing my portfolio to maintain these allocations. In a taxable account avoid selling to rebalance if it will cause any unnecessary capital gains taxes. 

Resources for the curious mind 
For those who prefer YouTube videos, I recommend Ben Felix’s content for clear, research based insights. If you enjoy reading, start with “The Intelligent Investor” by Benjamin Graham. 

By following these steps and sticking to them, you can secure a financially independent future while building wealth over time.

Moving on,

Let's review these

1:  StudioWest 002 Man: I haven't heard good things about westsite perfumes, but this one is really amazing for the price. Legit just got it yesterday.
If you are a Tom Ford ombre leather enjoyer like me(my fav perfume) you will love this one. Costs 195 for 25ml and you can consider it your everyday cheap ombre leather clone. It's obviously not as performing as the original and Is more linear then compared to the sophisticated TF, but I like this fragrance cuz I fw leathery notes hard. It's notes are pink pepper, thyme, orris(whatever that is) and ofcourse leather. 7.8/10

2: Issey miyake L'eue Bleue D'issey Eau Fraiche: got it as a gift a couple years ago. Don't really use it nor I like it. I don't even know if it's still in production today or even if it's original. Although the other mainstream Issey miyake L'eue D'issey Pour homme is 10 times better than this. It's kind of fresh and minty, but not in a way I like. 6/10

3: Nautica Voyage: got it around 1.5 years ago when I hopped on the hypetrain. Gotta say it did live up to the hype. One of my most favourite summer frags, smells like cucumbers and the ocean, if that makes sense. Could've been a better performer but it is what it is. Solid 9/10

4: Beverly Hills Polo Club sport 2: mom got it for me 2 years ago from a shoppers stop for like 1200 or something. As the name suggests it's a nice and sporty fragrance, not the best performer but makes up with it's notes. Spicy, warm and sweet fragrance. 8.5/10

5: davidoff horizon extreme: man since my childhood ive been a davidoff enjoyer, recently tried their coffee and that shit hits aswell. I have had this bottle for a good while now, like definitely around 6 or 7 years. Used it occasionally. Again not amazing performance when it comes to longevity and sillage but decent notes. A spicy, woody and a bit Leathery fragrance. When you smell it makes you feel like you're in dune. 8/10

6: Elizabeth arden True Love: yes not a male fragrance, thus why I don't use it. My mom loves fragrances much like myself so she gave this to me ki ""mere paas iske 2 hai ek tum rakhlo""  I said alright but when I smelt it, it was too powdery for me. It's dry down is definitely really amazing but I can't imagine myself wearing this. A floral powder fragrance. 6/10

7: davidoff cool water Night Dive: THATS WHY HES THE GOAT, DA GOAT. As I stated earlier, have been a davidoff enjoyer for years. I used to love the og cool water so much(years before the hype) that I finished like 2 bottles of it. Then I grew out of it and don't really like it anymore. My mom got me this from a dutyfree and holy shit is it way better than the original. I don't know if it's still in production but man I love this one. There's only a couple mls left haha. this is a marine and musky+woody fragrance done right. Imagine wearing this while taking a long walk on a beach under the moonlight. It's that amazing. Performance is alright, like projects till 3.5 hours and sillage till 4-4.5. lasts 5 in total. 9/10

8: Mercedes Benz intense for men all over body spray: this is a deodorant I picked up from the new Goa airport. Love it, sporty, and fresh. Use it after a workout or a basketball session. 8.5/10

9: Fragrantors tabac oudh vanilla musk: Fragrantors is a local perfume house in my hometown, and they got some neat shit. This 50ml bottle costed me like 500 rupees. Its trying it's best to be a clone of TF tabacco Vanille, but Its attempt of doing so becomes its own unique fragrance. Exactly as named, sweet tabacco vanilla fragrance. Crazy, I mean crazy performance. Lasts for Idek how many hours, projection and sillage go haywire and can smell it on my clothes for days. 9/10

10: Fragrantors silver tabac oudh musk: shares quite some notes with the previous one but not as sweet and a more fresh oudh fragrance.

11: Bella Vita G.O.A.T: let's not talk about this

12: Bella Vita Klub: or this

13: Bella Vita CEO: surprisingly good, reminds me of azzaro most wanted. Sweet and fresh. Ofcourse doesn't live up to the performance but got it in a gift set for my birthday and use it sometimes. 7/10


That is going to be all, if you read till the end, I hope you enjoyed my actually humble perfume collection.

Long story short, I noticed I have two main modes: Anxiety mode and depressive mode. both have different qualities. They never happen together completely

When I'm in anxiety mode I have motivation to do something but have anger inside with lots of racing thoughts which prevents me from focusing but I want to do something I have lots of fears and my heart is pounding, I feel sick in my stomach. especially after coffee drinking it happens. I cannot easily sit still or even sleep. I have to wait for coffee crash. that's why I quitted coffee.  
  
 On the other hand when I don't drink coffee I'm in depressive mode. very low motivation, suicidal, everything is so slow, I don't have energy and lethargic. I just want to sleep.

Life without coffee is tough for me but at the same time I know it is hurting me. I assume being suicidal and even attempting one time is something serious and the Dr is gonna put me on some meds. I just want to be normal. Not sad, Not happy. Just normal and stable.

I’m currently in the early stages of building a startup, and let me tell you, it’s been a rollercoaster. Some days I feel super productive and motivated, like I’m on the right path. But then there are days too many recently, where my mind just goes blank. I stare at my to-do list, and nothing feels right or worth starting.

It’s frustrating because I know what needs to be done, but it’s like my brain refuses to cooperate. And the worst part? That little voice in the back of my head that starts whispering, ""Are you even cut out for this?""

I thought starting a business would be tough, but no one really talks about these mental roadblocks, the moments where you’re stuck not because of lack of knowledge or resources, but because you can’t seem to get your mind to focus.

What’s funny is that I’ve been looking for hacks - coffee, walks, journaling, even random YouTube motivational videos - but nothing works consistently. I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has felt like this in their startup journey?
