1i6utoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vermiculture/comments/1i6utoh/ive_started_experimenting/,I've started experimenting...,"I just set up an indoor bin a few weeks ago. Drilled some holes in the lid, there's no smell and no liquid collecting at the bottom. 

Well I'd also ordered a lions mane grow kit and at first didn't give it proper aeration and afterwards didn't maintain my humidity levels. 

Lopped the brown fruit off and had no idea what to do with it. Ended up shredding it and mixing it into my bin.

So guys have been falling into the bottom after they ate through the paper towel lining. I thought they might have been pissed about something but I only had a light dew on the collection tray and they've only been fed frozen lettuce scraps so it's a pretty chill bin as far as I know. It was about 2 a day and I'd scoop em back up. I left it for two days and found 4. So it literally is two guys a day trying to jailbreak into a pretty dry environment. I sprayed the bottom a little to give em a chance before I could scoop em back. 

I switched em all out to another bin with a paper bag lining. Dw I made sure that all the bedding with food in it went back up on top. This is when I added the crushed mushrooms sort of in layers like I did used coffee grounds when I was setting up the bin. I saw that someone had placed spent grow blocks in their bin but they stopped posting years ago. Also they used oyster mushrooms which are more aggressive. 

Probably nothing will happen. 

Anyway a day and a half ago I was thinking they were escaping due to aeration so I turned the bin over. This time I'd added frozen lettuce and buried it in a layer about halfway deep. I was hoping to sort of spread the decomposing bacteria around a bit. They ate about a week's work of lettuce in **two days**. That experiment I'd say was successful. At the very least the lettuce decomposed a lot faster probably because of the warmer temperatures deeper in the bin. 

Today they've been fed about a half cup of frozen, smashed blueberries. More moisture than their usual lettuce so I plan on leaving their blanket off until tomorrow. 

Anyway, anyone know why they'd be pissed and try to escape? I found a bunch of eggs so I'm assuming things are fine-ish. When I open the bin there's usually a bunch of them at the top as long as they've been fed in the last 4 days. But even then I find them at the bottom. Also they like to eat the cardboard I layer on top. Whenever it's no longer easy to pull back, I rip it up and mix it onto the top where their food is. 

Tl;dr: 

1. Anyone have experience adding overripe mushrooms to their beds? 

2. Cocoons found in an indoor setup by newbie! Also no stank, bin smells like cardboard. 

3. Lettuce decomposed much faster at a depth of 2 inches under bedding.",1,1737497322.0,Vermiculture,0,1.0,False

1i6urfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/RantingZone/comments/1i6urfv/oooooommmg/,Oooooommmg,"Welcome to my eventful reality tv show staring me.

This morning was fine‚Ä¶ I wake up early because of family car issues I move on, I stuck behind a slow truck due to construction going on in my neighborhood.. it‚Äôs whatever I have a coffee I move on, I work a job where I highly dislike 2% of them I move on. 

 I straight am given 3 task by 3 different people that have the patience of toddlers. Full on 3 50 year old people. I‚Äôve lost my patience. 

Context to why I‚Äôm blowing a fuse: I bust my behind to make ends meet by working 2 job‚Ä¶ AAAANNNNDDDD  I‚Äôm just asked over and over and over again to do more. 

I‚Äôm just trying to be a good person

I agree to take on 10:30-4 and I regret it soooo much .. I COMPLETELY FORGOT IM NOT A PEOPLE PERSON. I dislike picking up the phone and I get a damn job that dooooeessss exactly that. IM SMART ^ v ^

N O W   I have to drive to next job ‚Ä¶ TELLL ME WHYYY AT THE TIME I GOT TO GET OUT THERES SOMEONE JUST AT THE EXIT PLANNING THEIR GPS. I go around I‚Äôm annoyed 

Skirrrrt my car slides and I‚Äôm low-key on the side walk (there‚Äôs snow) and I hear a scratching sound. Almost an accident cause by me because the steering wheel doesnt want to move as quick. 

I say screw it keep going .. I‚Äôm not mad it hasn‚Äôt been my first time I‚Äôve done something like that I own it I move on I‚Äôm annoyed. 

I rant to two people .. and I‚Äôm done with everything I want to return home asap.

I talk to the second person and they tell me to calm down .. the thing is I am unfazed like I‚Äôm calm I‚Äôm ranting I usually shut up. To be honest I can‚Äôt even figure out why am sooo mad, am I hungry? Even though I have a weird diet, do I need sleep? Even though I‚Äôm an insomniac, am I in denial of life? Even though I‚Äôm going with the flow because I have no goals yet, am I secretly questioning my purpose deep down? Even though I don‚Äôt even think like that. 

I book an appointment to get a physical done and the docs wronged me to the point that I‚Äôm angry at them. I just think I need a therapist at this point but I don‚Äôt want it. I figured my own problems I cry when bothered and I found what bothers me. But I could be undiagnosed ocd, anxiety, stress, depression, bipolar, and I can‚Äôt balance it out. I‚Äôm enraged by it I want to know. 

Here‚Äôs the kicker my thyroid is messing up and I‚Äôm 22 so it might just be that kicking buckets and my insurance just won‚Äôt cover it üëçüèº

2025 sucks and I want to be a kid again because it‚Äôs dog Dookie .. I‚Äôm just mad 

Feel free to comment whatever I‚Äôm all ears on anything. I‚Äôm fine the car is fine btw .. I‚Äôm just having one of those days. ",1,1737497165.0,RantingZone,0,1.0,False
1i6uqyc,https://www.reddit.com/r/KidneyStones/comments/1i6uqyc/urine_frequency_40y_m_uk/,Urine Frequency 40y M UK,"Hi All,

I‚Äôm a 40-year-old male based in the UK and looking for advice from anyone who has experienced similar symptoms.

For the past three weeks, I‚Äôve been experiencing an urge to urinate every two hours during the day. My urine flow feels slower than usual, and I often have a heavy sensation in my lower abdomen after emptying my bladder, as if it‚Äôs not completely empty.

I visited my GP, who performed a DRE (digital rectal exam) and ordered a PSA test. Both were normal. A urine dipstick test ruled out a UTI, but my urine sample was sent for further culture testing. The results showed a red blood cell (RBC) count of 38 and white blood cells (WBC) at 7. I‚Äôm wondering if this is a cause for concern.

I don‚Äôt experience these symptoms at night and can usually sleep through without waking to urinate, though I‚Äôve woken up to pee a couple of times during this period. I‚Äôm sexually active, but these symptoms began about two weeks after my last sexual activity. My partner has no symptoms, so I don‚Äôt think this is related to an STI.

I don‚Äôt consume coffee, tea, or fizzy drinks.

I‚Äôm not experiencing any back pain, weight loss, or other pain.

There‚Äôs occasional urgency to urinate, possibly with a burning sensation.


Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!

1i6unt9,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1i6unt9/we_are_experienced_hikers_on_a_weekend_trip_one/,We are experienced hikers on a weekend trip. One of our friends just disappeared without a trace.,"‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone.‚Äù I startle awake, elbow forcefully jamming into Chris‚Äô side as I steal him from his sleep. It was around 7am when I heard him outside his tent, pacing about on the dry leaves. The noise stopped a short while later. It is now 8:30am, any traces of Richard, his tent, or supplies, have disappeared.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what do you mean‚Äù Chris blinked, groggily. He squinted as his face emerged from the sleeping bag.

‚ÄúRichard‚Äôs left, he‚Äôs gone, where the fuck is he?‚Äù. I start scrambling, pulling at the zips on my sleeping bag as I get into a crouching position to leave the tent. The forest floor is untouched, any traces of Richard have been scrubbed from its memory, masked in a thick layer of auburn leaves. How long has he been gone? Can‚Äôt have been more than an hour?

‚ÄúIs he taking a piss?‚Äù Chris asks, dismissively.

‚ÄúNo, like he‚Äôs fucking gone and left, he‚Äôs taken his tent down and disappeared.‚Äù I guffaw in disbelief. This startles him into a sense of alert.

‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre joking, where‚Äôs he gone?‚Äù. Chris‚Äô head peers over my shoulder into the clearing.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs honestly taking the piss, what the fuck‚Äôs he gotten up to‚Äù. I get out of the tent and into an upright position, my joints creaking as I take a few steps to examine the clearing and the nearby woods for any signs of Richard. A neat patchwork of pine trees envelops the surroundings. At certain angles I can see between the long promenades of trees, forming into straight rows to provide a narrow view of the distance; but this doesn‚Äôt help much.

This isn‚Äôt like him. We‚Äôre 12 years into these hiking trips and not once has he ever strayed so much as a few feet from the group. We are all very much team players and rely on group consensus for any important decisions. My stomach exudes a feeling of discomfort and unease. Did he tell us he was leaving? I honestly don‚Äôt remember.

I clamber back into the tent and over Chris, rummaging through the rucksack until my hands grasp a cold metallic slab. I take my phone and re-enter the clearing, raising it en-pointe towards the sky as if offering it up to some unseen deity. No signal. I swear I had at least two bars last night. We set up camp here because it‚Äôs the first place for miles that I received any notifications. I meant to give Jane a message to let her know we were okay. Shit - I‚Äôll have to call her when I get the chance.

Chris‚Äô eyes widen and he starts moving with urgency, heading back towards the tent. He pulls out a waterproof jacket and fumbles through the pockets for his phone.

‚ÄúI was going to show you how these worked, but I got some of those trackers a few months ago. Because of the bag and shit we lost last time I thought we could put these on all our stuff.‚Äù

Chris‚Äô explanations were muddled under the weight of his intense concentration. He stares, unblinking at his phone, hands shaking slightly as he opens and closes apps until he finds the right one.

‚ÄúI think I put two in Rich‚Äôs bag thinking it was mine, I couldn‚Äôt find them in my rucksack last night.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt respond, as if not to break the spell of this alchemist working unearthly magic to return our friend.

‚ÄúHere‚Äù, he exclaims with some confidence, presenting me with phone screen. I see a map. Barely a map, more a large, deep green plane with very few details. But I notice some pinpoints, in two bunches at top and bottom of the display. Chris gestures to the bottom group. ‚ÄòThis is us, I think, and the ones up there are the ones Rich has got‚Äô. He taps the screen and we zoom in on the ones we think to be Richard‚Äôs.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way‚Äù I retort. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs 22 miles away, he‚Äôs been gone a fucking hour, how did he get 22 miles away? Do we even know what direction that‚Äôs in?‚Äù.

‚ÄúMate, I don‚Äôt know‚Äù Chris lets out a nervous chuckle to break the tension. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs GPS and it says five minutes ago‚Äù. He swipes the screen to refresh, the pinpoints shuffle slightly further up the screen as the time now reads ‚Äô60 secs ago‚Äô.

‚ÄúI mean he is a runner, maybe he went full pelt over there‚Äù Chris smirks and looks for my validation.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs insane‚Äù I spit back, exasperated. ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt have gone that far. That‚Äôs fucking ridiculous. Did someone give him a lift?‚Äù I sense my sarcasm cutting at Chris so I reel it in and collect myself.

‚ÄúHow accurate are these? Is it still tracking him?‚Äù. Chris doesn‚Äôt respond, instead tilting the phone screen in my direction so I can verify it for myself.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taken his shit, and he‚Äôs headed off in that direction‚Äù Chris gestures through the dense thatch of trees. ‚ÄúWe planned to be out here for three nights, so we can get to him by this evening, and head back in the morning, we‚Äôll be ‚Äòaight‚Äù.

‚ÄúIs he still moving?‚Äù I ask. I resign myself the premises of this situation and start prodding at the feasibility of Chris‚Äô plan.

‚ÄúLooks like he‚Äôs settled for now‚Äù Chris replies. ‚ÄúWhen we get signal, we‚Äôll give him a call or something and ask him to head back towards us‚Äù.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably lost though, how‚Äôs he going to make his way back?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, once we speak with him we can sort this out. Unless he‚Äôs gone absolutely fucking mental, we can get him to head back and meet us somewhere. It‚Äôs about 9am now, we could make it by 4ish if we head off now‚Äù

Without waiting for my agreement, Chris reaches for his rucksack and starts fixing it on his back. I do the same. I feel a tightness in my stomach, an unease which seeps into my bones. I think of Jane and I sweep the sky for phone signal in one last hail Mary attempt. No luck. I follow Chris‚Äô lead and fasten my rucksack on tight. We head off into the woods in search of Richard.

The forest becomes thicker as we journey forward. We are slowed by the tangle of dead branches and shallow roots. Carefully I watch where I step, and I feel a creeping pain in my neck from holding it at such an uncomfortable angle. The cacophony of bugs and insects ring just slightly louder than my tinnitus. We travel in silence for a large part of the journey. When we do speak, we focus entirely on logistics. Chris keeps his eyes fixed on the way forward, only interrupted by brief glances at his phone to ensure the path ahead is correct. We have missed our deadline by a good few hours, but Richard doesn‚Äôt seem to have moved in that time. The pinpoints show his location as unchanged, with only slight shifts left and right, as if he‚Äôs swaying in some drunken stupor. At least it gives us confidence that the tags are still on his person. I clench my fists as I resist the urge to scratch the bug bites covering my forearms and shins, shaking sweat from my hands. I get flashes of discomfort when I feel my clothes sticking to me, and the aches and pains of having walked nearly 20 miles. The GPS, and our exhaustion, are the only indicators that we have made progress. The scenery remains entirely monolithic.

The sun starts to set as we close in on Richard. We start calling out his name, softly at first, as if too loud a sound would anger the forest. With confidence growing and distance narrowing, we shout for him. Sweat and spittle rain from my face as the last of my energy is spent demanding his attention. No response. The night robs us of the ability to see more than a few dozen feet in front of us. So, I listen, hearing only the footsteps of Chris and myself. The insects grow louder, but so does the gentle patter of running water.

As if by some break in the fabric of reality, the forest suddenly and unexpectedly ceases in front of us. We come to a large clearing, about the length of a football pitch. The forest still dominates the surroundings, lining the other side of the clearing as it stretches for countless miles further. But the clearing is wide, reaching far beyond my field of vision. The dense undergrowth has given way to soft grass, trees replaced by wild bushes no more than a foot high.

A river runs through the clearing, cutting straight through the middle. The jagged rocks on the riverbed cut ripples into the water‚Äôs surface. It‚Äôs jet black and viscous, harshly reflecting the moonlight off its inky surface. In front of us, the river forks and rejoins not much further down, forming an elliptical island in the middle. A large oak tree with a wide base and mighty trunk has taken root defiantly in the middle of the island, alone. It stands large and squat against the backdrop of imposing pine trees, noticeably conspicuous the abrupt clearing. I grab Chris‚Äô hand to turn the phone towards me. All it shows is the same deep green forest we have spent our day conquering, no clearing, no stream, nothing.

Richard‚Äôs there. He‚Äôs by the tree. Oh my fucking God. I feel the energy surging back into my muscles as I sprint towards the riverbank now screaming his name, my throat burning. Chris takes only a moment to catch and he‚Äôs there running alongside me, flailing his arms as if stranded at sea. I take about three steps into the water before the cold hits me. Compared to the warmth of the day, the water feels icy and hostile. I flinch and retreat a few steps back towards the riverbank.

I use this opportunity to get a better look at Richard. All I can make out is his silhouette, standing motionless to the left of the tree. His face is completely obscured by shadows, I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs facing towards or away from us. The lights of our headlamps dissipate before reaching the island. Chris is continuing to shout Richard‚Äôs name, punctuated by a few ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you doing!‚Äùs and ‚ÄúHow the fuck did you get there!‚Äùs. But Richard just remains. Motionless, bathed in dark, as if dissolving into the vast expanse of the forest behind him.

I jerk my body around to find my rucksack laying at the edge of the clearing. I must have shed it when we started running. Chris doesn‚Äôt wait, wading into the waist-high water without a second thought. He lets out a few pained grunts as the water envelops his torso and stomach. His arms ride abreast the water, and he glides slowly through towards Richard. I‚Äôm not far behind him, dragging my rucksack into the water and clenching my teeth as I brace for the first few steps in.

We make our way through the water as the current suddenly picks up. I see Chris bowled over by the sudden force. I brace myself against the current, feeling it surging through me with a tremendous rush of power. A strap of my rucksack is tied around my hand as to not lose it, but I‚Äôm pulled off balance by the force on the bag. My head becomes submerged as I‚Äôm dragged down stream by my wrist. I dig my heels in and pull back against the force, twisting my neck round to gasp for breath. Richard is watching me from beneath the tree. After a moment I have my head out of the water and my feet firmly planted on the ground. The current has dissipated. I examine the surroundings and find that I have only drifted a few feet off course, Chris is not too far away. The adrenaline dissipates, leaving me defenceless against the bitter cold. Wading over, I notice Chris‚Äô attention is fixed elsewhere.

‚ÄúHey, where did Richard go?‚Äù Chris asks sharply between harsh draws of breath. ‚ÄúDid you see him? I swear he was here just now‚Äù. I stop for breath and confirm for myself that, yes, you‚Äôre right, he‚Äôs not here, he has simply disappeared like he did before. Of course he did. I don‚Äôt even flinch at these embers of hope slipping through my fingers, I just focus on pulling myself towards the island.

We reach the slight stretch of land, now uninhabited. My bones slowly defrost from the water, teeth chattering. I click my headlamp on to confirm: no footprints, no disturbance of any kind. The river returns to a quiet trickle of water.

‚ÄúThis is fucked, where the fuck are we?‚Äù Chris panics, pulling his phone out his pocket and shaking off water droplets.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt feel my bloody fingers‚Äù he moans as he locks himself out. I release his phone from his grip to wipe the remaining water off on the grass and punch in his passcode.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs here, where‚Äôs the bag?‚Äù I search frantically, looking for a rucksack or a coat or something scattered on the ground. The phone says the trackers are still here, even if Richard is not.

‚ÄúWhere the fuck has he gone?‚Äù Chris whispers harshly for my attention, as if not to catch the attention of a nearby predator. His eyes are red and watery in the torchlight. I cannot give him any answers. ‚ÄúThat could not have been him, that was not fucking him, we‚Äôre fucked‚Äù. Still, I remain silent.

I push that pit in my stomach deep down, back into hell. Instead, I reach for my phone and raise it aloft. Still nothing. Fuck‚Äôs sake. Nothing has come through in the past day. No one knows where we are. We‚Äôve only been gone a day and a half. Jane is still at the cabin and is not expecting us back until at least Monday evening. We‚Äôre 22 miles off-track and one man down. Our reputation for disappearing for days at a time has proven to be a sore irony.

‚ÄúRight‚Äù I assert with all the authority I can muster, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs cut our losses, get the fuck away from here and set up camp somewhere. We‚Äôll head back as far as we can tomorrow and if I get any phone signal I‚Äôll call for a rescue team or something.‚Äù I attempt to instil a confidence in Chris which is not particularly well founded.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no signal anywhere, this place isn‚Äôt even on the fucking map‚Äù

‚ÄúLike I said we‚Äôre leaving here, we‚Äôre not staying, we‚Äôll set up camp about a mile away and we should get back just alright.‚Äù I spit with righteous indignation.

‚ÄúBut we can‚Äôt just leave Rich, like we can‚Äôt just leave him lost out here, he‚Äôs fucking somewhere right.‚Äù Chris pleads with an uncharacteristic meekness.

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs his own fucking fault, isn‚Äôt it.‚Äù The comment lingers in the air, stinging my mouth with its vitriol. We wait in silence for a moment before I turn to head back.

My torch catches the base of the tree. I turn back to illuminate the trunk where I scan upwards towards the top, resting about head height. I stare at the carvings etched into the wood. Carefully sculpted are angular, geometric shapes, in rows running from top to bottom. I graze my fingers along them, recognising them to be Norse runes. Up and down, they have been carefully transcribed. I rub my fingertips together, examining the deep red coating they‚Äôve been gifted. The metallic smell confirms that it is blood. I examine the tree again and the entire face of the trunk has been haphazardly smeared in the same deep red.

A sense of realisation washes over me. This must be why Richard brought us here. Chris shuffles over, his blind panic now subsiding into a sense of calm. I know it, these are symbols of protection. They bring fortune and good luck to those who happen upon them. Chris eyes them up and down in silence. We both breathe calmness into our lungs. I retrieve my rucksack from the riverbed and carefully dig through it. I unsheathe a kitchen knife and bring it back to the tree. Scanning the bark for any signs of instruction, I rub more blood onto my fingers and examine it closely. It appears that the blood fixes a connection of some kind, between the donor and the runes. Endowing the traveller with good omens.

Chris, unspeaking, presents me with his palm. I look to him for approval before firmly pressing into it and slicing through the centre, just above his thumb and across his heart line. He doesn‚Äôt react. I present mine to him and do the same, digging in to ensure a decent about of blood. A sense of warmth grows from my hand, up my forearm and into my body. I inhale deeply and hold the moment in my mind. Taking his hand with mine we press them together, squeezing them with my other hand to strengthen the bond. We both reach for the tree and smear our own deep red paint over the runes.

I scan over the markings again and recognise some of them. ‚ÄòProtection‚Äô, ‚ÄòLove‚Äô, ‚ÄòGood Health‚Äô. Yes, this is what we need. We are out here, in the apathy and brutality of wilderness; These omens will protect us from whatever is lurking. Chris is smiling with his eyes; He knows it just like I do. I reach over and caress his face, smearing a line of blood across his forehead. I turn to study the runes. One calls out to me with an aura of love. Algis ‚Äì protection. Of course.

I clutch the knife and raise it to his forehead, delicately, but decisively carving the rune into his skin. He doesn‚Äôt flinch, holding the same euphoric expression but now grinning ear to ear. The job only takes a moment and, once finished I wipe the drops of blood across his face and cheeks. I pass him the knife and lean forward in excited anticipation. He carves Sowelo ‚Äì sun, into my forehead. Pure ecstasy. We are both overcome with awe at our good fortune. Richard has led us here to bring us out of the forests and into the light, back to our friends and family, waiting for us with open arms.

I feel the ground vibrate, shifting beneath our feet. We startle and step back. The ground gives way to a hole at the base of the tree. We pause for a moment as I peer into the newly formed chasm. It has opened up a tunnel into the earth, fit for man, stretching deep into blackness, curving underneath the tree and out of sight. Chris is staring deep into me. We share an unspoken knowledge of what we must do.

Chris once again presents me with his hand, face up towards the blackened sky. I rest it in mine and press the knife down into the first joint of his forefinger. It snaps with a satisfying cleanness. Chris stares at his palm with quiet solemnity. I move to the next finger and repeat the process. Crack. Just as pure as the first. One by one, each finger is severed at the first joint. I coddle the severed pieces in my hand with the care of rosary beads. He leans forward, eyes closed, as I gently place one of them in his mouth. The rest are tossed down the hole with a quiet murmur of prayer. He shuts his lips tight and holds it there, savouring the sensation in deep meditation.

Chris opens his eyes to take me in one final time. We share a look of knowing. His features betray the joy he is hiding. He is truly at peace. Without a sound, Chris slips into the hole beneath the tree, arms raised above his head to ease his descent. He vanishes into the abyss below without a single word. I remain on the overworld, now truly alone.

I raise my hand in the same ritual fashion and bring a knife to my forefinger and begin pressing down. A pain shoots through me. Not from my hand, but my face. I stagger backwards and clutch my jaw with both hands, dropping the knife. Tears rush down my cheeks as my facial muscles convulse. I‚Äôve been screaming, for a long time. My throat is red hot, torn to shreds. I look at my hands, I look at the tree, I look at the hole. I kneel over it on all fours and scream with all the strength I can muster.

‚ÄòChris! Chris!‚Äô I wail with a hoarseness that betrays my sheer panic. I shoot up to my feet and whip my head around to catch a sign of anything watching. The forest lies silent. Scrambling with reckless urgency, I head for water and start paddling. The cold is irrelevant in the face of the pain coursing through my face and hands. I pull the water past me and clamber for the riverbed. I don‚Äôt dare turn back to face what may be waiting for me. Instead, I head back into the forest and running faster that I ever thought capable of.

The wind brings me back around before the aching of my limbs sets in. I startle awake, fully clothed, sprawled out at the base of a tree. Dense forest surrounds me. The sun peers through the canopy as morning sets in. Frantically patting my pockets, I feel for my phone and‚Ä¶ nothing else. The woods are silent, no insects, no footsteps, just the faint sound of wind brushing past my ears. I let out a guttural, full bodied scream for what feels like hours. Nothing. I can taste dryness in my mouth, but that discomfort pales in comparison to the ruthless beating the rest of my body is reeling from.

Before my mind can begin processing it, my body starts moving. I‚Äôm pulled out of my fatigue by a primal thirst for survival. Stumbling through the forest, I push against the tree trunks to steady my balance and propel me forwards. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going. Thoughts of Chris and Richard hammer at the door of my mind as uninvited guests, demanding an audience. Their images don‚Äôt bring me tears, but stress. I need to help myself first, then I can help them. Licking my wounds out in the arse end of nowhere isn‚Äôt going to bring a rescue party.

I swipe my thumb over the jagged shards of my phone screen and enter the passcode. I open maps and hold it arm‚Äôs length in front of me, squinting into the dimmed light for a glimpse of my lifeline. No signal ‚Äì But GPS is working fine. Deep green smear enveloping face of the phone, no details whatsoever. Fine ‚Äì whatever. I can tell north from south like a tit from an arse now. I swivel on my heels, face southeast and keep walking.

After, I‚Äôm not sure how long, I find myself led to another clearing. The scenery breaks as abruptly as before, but now, I‚Äôm high up on a cliffside. Probably about 100, 200 feet below me is a sheer drop. An uninviting tangle of stone and fate beckons from the base of the cliff. From there the forest wrestles back control and sprawls endlessly in every direction beyond the horizon. Tears of stress concentrate in my eyes. Where the fuck did this come from? The forest has been nothing but a flat, uninterrupted plane for the entire trip, and now I‚Äôm standing a few hundred feet in the air? I‚Äôve not seen a single hill this entire trip. What the fuck is this.

I pause to collect myself and decide on the play. Like the river, the cliff face stretches for miles on each end; A fault line in the earth splitting the world into two halves. This is the way forward. The map proves aggravatingly useless, yet again at providing me with routes, or alternatives, or anything fucking helpful in the slightest.

My heart jumps and I almost drop the phone down the cliffside. The vibration sends tremors up my arm and my entire body into alert. Jane is calling. I stare dumbly at the screen for a beyond reasonable length of time. No emotions penetrate the fortress of my concentration as I raise the phone to my ear.

‚ÄúEd?‚Äù She asks sheepishly.

‚ÄúHoney? oh my god! I am so glad to hear your voice‚Äù. Relief washes over me as her voice lights a warm glow of hope.

‚ÄúWhere the *fuck* have you gone?‚Äù Her fury is palpable. The brief flicker of hope has been extinguished and my soul hollowed out.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been worrying non-stop for the past three nights. Becky is worried. The kids are worried. Is Chris with you? What the fuck were you thinking?‚Äù I gasp to interrupt but Jane only builds momentum.

‚ÄúYou left in the dead of night. Two in the fucking morning. I called the police; They‚Äôve been searching for the past two days. What the fuck do I tell the kids?‚Äù

A headache burns from my forehead as I stammer a response to stem the tide of anger and accusation.

‚ÄúWe went hiking, it wasn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo fucking shit you went hiking, you took everything! Where have the kitchen knives gone? Becky was crying! The kids are terrified. What the fuck are you doing?‚Äù

My jaw hangs agape, defenceless against the pain of her scorn.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm sorry. But we lost Richard, he went off and we had to‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWho the fuck is Richard?‚Äù she screams, her volume reaching a fever pitch. I have to pull the phone away from my ear. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you talking about? Who is Richard?‚Äù

I start to feel faint and stagger backwards, clutching at my stomach as I resist the urge to throw up.

‚ÄúHe, he came with us on the trip and we lost him and we went to find him but Chris‚Ä¶‚Äù I breathlessly scramble for an explanation.

‚ÄúWhat? Who is this? How the fuck did you end up in the middle of the forest with some random stranger? Where is Chris is *he* with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo he‚Äôs gone he‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù

Jane screams in complete hysteria. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean he‚Äôs gone what‚Äôs happening!‚Äù

My hands are trembling, and my mind is vacant.

‚ÄúMe and Chris and Richard we were camping and the‚Ä¶ we were looking for‚Ä¶ he got lost in the woods so we started looking because the phone‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ please‚Äù

My voice trails off as I hear sobbing down the other end of the phone. Jane‚Äôs anger has subsided into meek, desperate pleading for answers.

‚ÄúEd, where are you, can you tell me where you are‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre lost‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm lost. I don‚Äôt know where Chris is.‚Äù

At this point, I am spent. All I need is the confirmation of my worst suspicions.

‚ÄúMe, Richard, and Chris left on Friday afternoon and walked about 10 miles into the forest and set up camp‚Ä¶‚Äù I enunciate each of the details for my own sake as much as hers. It feels like a lie told to myself over and over until I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs truth.

‚ÄúEd, you‚Äôre really scaring me. Who is Richard? We don‚Äôt know a Richard. We‚Äôre in the middle of nowhere how did you meet him?‚Äù

I fall silent at the weight of this question. I hang up, message my location, and put the phone down.

I‚Äôm lost. Truly and definitively lost. For how long now I do not know. The tethers of reality I clung to have only served to drag me further in. I sit in silt and mud, reeling in the weight of the conversation. I‚Äôve been lost for a long while.

How many of us were there? How many of us were there ever on these trips? Was it three or just two, or four, or seven-and-a-half? Could there have been loads of us in a naked orgy for all I know, or was I just wanking myself off in the wilderness for a long weekend?

Richard and I were groomsmen for Chris and Becky‚Äôs wedding. We were at university together. He had been out with us every fucking year since we started hiking. What the fuck was she on about?

I sit with these thoughts for a while and come to no conclusions. Hugging my knees to my chest, the stress boils over into floods of tears. I wipe my face gaze at the beauty of the forest. From this vantage point, the true might of nature is at full display. Shades of green and black stand defiantly against the amber and gold of the setting sun. A perfect balance of all life, endless space and creation. From here I am gliding over it, stealing a view reserved only for the birds and the gods.

I drift through the next few hours like a ghost amongst the living. The sun has long since set and seeing anything more than a few feet away is impossible now. Not that it matters really. I tread, arms outstretched, stumbling through the overgrowth, feeling my way through the trees. There‚Äôs nothing left but to move. Even the wind has ceased caressing my ears with its soft whistling. The silence engulfs me in its firm embrace. Keep going. I tread aimlessly through the forest with only the faintest memory or care for directions. Keep going. Go on lad, keep moving. That‚Äôs it, steady on. You‚Äôre almost there! You‚Äôre on the way home lad. I can feel it in the distance! You‚Äôre doing it! You‚Äôre going. Oh my God, you‚Äôre going to get home. Bravo, my son! Keep pushing. KEEP PUSHING! YOU‚ÄôRE ALMOST THERE! YOU‚ÄôRE ALMOST FUCKING HOME, YOU‚ÄôRE HERE, YOU‚ÄôRE HERE!!!

I see a gentle light through the trees. A red hue bathes the far side of the trees and long streaks of overgrowth. Like a moth, I single-mindedly fall towards it, transfixed. It grows brighter, but I don‚Äôt squint. In the forest, nestled in a small clearing, no more than a few meters wide, is Richard‚Äôs tent. The soft torchlight glows from inside, dyed a warm red by its canvas walls, illuminating in all directions the blackness of the forest. It sits peacefully amongst the trees, a promise of comfort in a hostile world. Home.

I glide towards the tent, my feet no longer burdened by the traps and snares of the forest floor. My hand strokes the canvas, dispensing fragments of dried blood along its side. I inhale the warmth into my lungs. Crouching down, I reach around the left-hand side of the tent and gently tug on the zipper. It softly purrs as I trace the semi-circle of the opening. The canvas door falls away and grants me entry. Everything in here is Richard‚Äôs, neatly folded and arranged around the floor of the tent. LED lights emit a soft glow, twisted around the tent poles and suspended in the air like fireflies. Richard‚Äôs books and glasses sit patiently to the right of the tent, next to a flask of coffee and a cigarette. This is a man whom I understand with all my being. Two sleeping bags lay neatly in the centre. Chris is there, sleeping soundly on the floor.

A soft happiness fills my body. Chris‚Äô chest isn‚Äôt rising, but he looks peaceful. His eyes are closed, and a satisfied grin decorates his face. I lean closer towards him. He smells wonderful. His hands feel cold to the touch as I rub the stubs of his fingers. Facing away, I lay down next to him, curling into a slight fetal position to allow him to spoon my body. I snuggle my back into his chest as to warm him with my life.

Footsteps, emerging from the forest, move towards the tent, and a shadow appears against the canvas. It stretches high up the walls, either impossibly large or uncomfortably close. It begins circling us, with the crackling of dry leaves announcing every step. The shadow is joined by a second, entering into the parade around the tent. They clap and click in quiet rhythm. Slow and soft at first, the sound swells with confidence as another pair of hands join the ensemble. The shadows are accompanied by yet another which begins murmuring under its breath, clicking in counterpoint to the rest. I lay there in Chris‚Äô embrace, watching in quiet contemplation as the performance unfolds.

This rhythmic cacophony grows as drums, claps, snaps, shouts, and jeers form a rich tapestry of celebration outside. The shuffling of feet creates viscous white noise as at least a dozen bodies circle the tent. They all chant in unison a song, an ancient song. It spins me into a psychedelic ecstasy as I mouth the words along with them, failing to produce any sound. I lie there, unblinking, as a pool of spit forms on the ground beneath my mouth. Chris reaches over to my shoulder and wraps his arm around me, I warm his flesh with my love for all things. My eyes close as I become one with this moment.

The tent unzips and I feel something pulling at the floor. It steps inside and I am greeted with warm understanding throughout my body. Saying nothing, seeing nothing, I know it is Richard. My chest raises unevenly as I draw breath with excitement. He lays down in front of me and I hold him, trembling, the same way Chris is holding me. From the way he feels, I can tell he is longer, but I don‚Äôt open my eyes. The crowd grows louder in frenetic jubilation. I feel the heat emanating from Richard and his moisture coats my face, hands and clothes.

We lay here, together, in the centre of this world. This is truly the home I was seeking. I need no sound, no sight, no feeling. Just the knowledge that I will be held here in this space, entwined in the friendship of my greatest companions. Forever.",2,1737496924.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1i6unn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1i6unn8/we_are_experienced_hikers_on_a_weekend_trip_one/,We are experienced hikers on a weekend trip. One of our friends just disappeared without a trace.,"‚ÄúHe‚Äôs gone.‚Äù I startle awake, elbow forcefully jamming into Chris‚Äô side as I steal him from his sleep. It was around 7am when I heard him outside his tent, pacing about on the dry leaves. The noise stopped a short while later. It is now 8:30am, any traces of Richard, his tent, or supplies, have disappeared.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ what do you mean‚Äù Chris blinked, groggily. He squinted as his face emerged from the sleeping bag.

‚ÄúRichard‚Äôs left, he‚Äôs gone, where the fuck is he?‚Äù. I start scrambling, pulling at the zips on my sleeping bag as I get into a crouching position to leave the tent. The forest floor is untouched, any traces of Richard have been scrubbed from its memory, masked in a thick layer of auburn leaves. How long has he been gone? Can‚Äôt have been more than an hour?

‚ÄúIs he taking a piss?‚Äù Chris asks, dismissively.

‚ÄúNo, like he‚Äôs fucking gone and left, he‚Äôs taken his tent down and disappeared.‚Äù I guffaw in disbelief. This startles him into a sense of alert.

‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre joking, where‚Äôs he gone?‚Äù. Chris‚Äô head peers over my shoulder into the clearing.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs honestly taking the piss, what the fuck‚Äôs he gotten up to‚Äù. I get out of the tent and into an upright position, my joints creaking as I take a few steps to examine the clearing and the nearby woods for any signs of Richard. A neat patchwork of pine trees envelops the surroundings. At certain angles I can see between the long promenades of trees, forming into straight rows to provide a narrow view of the distance; but this doesn‚Äôt help much.

This isn‚Äôt like him. We‚Äôre 12 years into these hiking trips and not once has he ever strayed so much as a few feet from the group. We are all very much team players and rely on group consensus for any important decisions. My stomach exudes a feeling of discomfort and unease. Did he tell us he was leaving? I honestly don‚Äôt remember.

I clamber back into the tent and over Chris, rummaging through the rucksack until my hands grasp a cold metallic slab. I take my phone and re-enter the clearing, raising it en-pointe towards the sky as if offering it up to some unseen deity. No signal. I swear I had at least two bars last night. We set up camp here because it‚Äôs the first place for miles that I received any notifications. I meant to give Jane a message to let her know we were okay. Shit - I‚Äôll have to call her when I get the chance.

Chris‚Äô eyes widen and he starts moving with urgency, heading back towards the tent. He pulls out a waterproof jacket and fumbles through the pockets for his phone.

‚ÄúI was going to show you how these worked, but I got some of those trackers a few months ago. Because of the bag and shit we lost last time I thought we could put these on all our stuff.‚Äù

Chris‚Äô explanations were muddled under the weight of his intense concentration. He stares, unblinking at his phone, hands shaking slightly as he opens and closes apps until he finds the right one.

‚ÄúI think I put two in Rich‚Äôs bag thinking it was mine, I couldn‚Äôt find them in my rucksack last night.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt respond, as if not to break the spell of this alchemist working unearthly magic to return our friend.

‚ÄúHere‚Äù, he exclaims with some confidence, presenting me with phone screen. I see a map. Barely a map, more a large, deep green plane with very few details. But I notice some pinpoints, in two bunches at top and bottom of the display. Chris gestures to the bottom group. ‚ÄòThis is us, I think, and the ones up there are the ones Rich has got‚Äô. He taps the screen and we zoom in on the ones we think to be Richard‚Äôs.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way‚Äù I retort. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs 22 miles away, he‚Äôs been gone a fucking hour, how did he get 22 miles away? Do we even know what direction that‚Äôs in?‚Äù.

‚ÄúMate, I don‚Äôt know‚Äù Chris lets out a nervous chuckle to break the tension. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs GPS and it says five minutes ago‚Äù. He swipes the screen to refresh, the pinpoints shuffle slightly further up the screen as the time now reads ‚Äô60 secs ago‚Äô.

‚ÄúI mean he is a runner, maybe he went full pelt over there‚Äù Chris smirks and looks for my validation.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs insane‚Äù I spit back, exasperated. ‚ÄúHe can‚Äôt have gone that far. That‚Äôs fucking ridiculous. Did someone give him a lift?‚Äù I sense my sarcasm cutting at Chris so I reel it in and collect myself.

‚ÄúHow accurate are these? Is it still tracking him?‚Äù. Chris doesn‚Äôt respond, instead tilting the phone screen in my direction so I can verify it for myself.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs taken his shit, and he‚Äôs headed off in that direction‚Äù Chris gestures through the dense thatch of trees. ‚ÄúWe planned to be out here for three nights, so we can get to him by this evening, and head back in the morning, we‚Äôll be ‚Äòaight‚Äù.

‚ÄúIs he still moving?‚Äù I ask. I resign myself the premises of this situation and start prodding at the feasibility of Chris‚Äô plan.

‚ÄúLooks like he‚Äôs settled for now‚Äù Chris replies. ‚ÄúWhen we get signal, we‚Äôll give him a call or something and ask him to head back towards us‚Äù.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably lost though, how‚Äôs he going to make his way back?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, once we speak with him we can sort this out. Unless he‚Äôs gone absolutely fucking mental, we can get him to head back and meet us somewhere. It‚Äôs about 9am now, we could make it by 4ish if we head off now‚Äù

Without waiting for my agreement, Chris reaches for his rucksack and starts fixing it on his back. I do the same. I feel a tightness in my stomach, an unease which seeps into my bones. I think of Jane and I sweep the sky for phone signal in one last hail Mary attempt. No luck. I follow Chris‚Äô lead and fasten my rucksack on tight. We head off into the woods in search of Richard.

The forest becomes thicker as we journey forward. We are slowed by the tangle of dead branches and shallow roots. Carefully I watch where I step, and I feel a creeping pain in my neck from holding it at such an uncomfortable angle. The cacophony of bugs and insects ring just slightly louder than my tinnitus. We travel in silence for a large part of the journey. When we do speak, we focus entirely on logistics. Chris keeps his eyes fixed on the way forward, only interrupted by brief glances at his phone to ensure the path ahead is correct. We have missed our deadline by a good few hours, but Richard doesn‚Äôt seem to have moved in that time. The pinpoints show his location as unchanged, with only slight shifts left and right, as if he‚Äôs swaying in some drunken stupor. At least it gives us confidence that the tags are still on his person. I clench my fists as I resist the urge to scratch the bug bites covering my forearms and shins, shaking sweat from my hands. I get flashes of discomfort when I feel my clothes sticking to me, and the aches and pains of having walked nearly 20 miles. The GPS, and our exhaustion, are the only indicators that we have made progress. The scenery remains entirely monolithic.

The sun starts to set as we close in on Richard. We start calling out his name, softly at first, as if too loud a sound would anger the forest. With confidence growing and distance narrowing, we shout for him. Sweat and spittle rain from my face as the last of my energy is spent demanding his attention. No response. The night robs us of the ability to see more than a few dozen feet in front of us. So, I listen, hearing only the footsteps of Chris and myself. The insects grow louder, but so does the gentle patter of running water.

As if by some break in the fabric of reality, the forest suddenly and unexpectedly ceases in front of us. We come to a large clearing, about the length of a football pitch. The forest still dominates the surroundings, lining the other side of the clearing as it stretches for countless miles further. But the clearing is wide, reaching far beyond my field of vision. The dense undergrowth has given way to soft grass, trees replaced by wild bushes no more than a foot high.

A river runs through the clearing, cutting straight through the middle. The jagged rocks on the riverbed cut ripples into the water‚Äôs surface. It‚Äôs jet black and viscous, harshly reflecting the moonlight off its inky surface. In front of us, the river forks and rejoins not much further down, forming an elliptical island in the middle. A large oak tree with a wide base and mighty trunk has taken root defiantly in the middle of the island, alone. It stands large and squat against the backdrop of imposing pine trees, noticeably conspicuous the abrupt clearing. I grab Chris‚Äô hand to turn the phone towards me. All it shows is the same deep green forest we have spent our day conquering, no clearing, no stream, nothing.

Richard‚Äôs there. He‚Äôs by the tree. Oh my fucking God. I feel the energy surging back into my muscles as I sprint towards the riverbank now screaming his name, my throat burning. Chris takes only a moment to catch and he‚Äôs there running alongside me, flailing his arms as if stranded at sea. I take about three steps into the water before the cold hits me. Compared to the warmth of the day, the water feels icy and hostile. I flinch and retreat a few steps back towards the riverbank.

I use this opportunity to get a better look at Richard. All I can make out is his silhouette, standing motionless to the left of the tree. His face is completely obscured by shadows, I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs facing towards or away from us. The lights of our headlamps dissipate before reaching the island. Chris is continuing to shout Richard‚Äôs name, punctuated by a few ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you doing!‚Äùs and ‚ÄúHow the fuck did you get there!‚Äùs. But Richard just remains. Motionless, bathed in dark, as if dissolving into the vast expanse of the forest behind him.

I jerk my body around to find my rucksack laying at the edge of the clearing. I must have shed it when we started running. Chris doesn‚Äôt wait, wading into the waist-high water without a second thought. He lets out a few pained grunts as the water envelops his torso and stomach. His arms ride abreast the water, and he glides slowly through towards Richard. I‚Äôm not far behind him, dragging my rucksack into the water and clenching my teeth as I brace for the first few steps in.

We make our way through the water as the current suddenly picks up. I see Chris bowled over by the sudden force. I brace myself against the current, feeling it surging through me with a tremendous rush of power. A strap of my rucksack is tied around my hand as to not lose it, but I‚Äôm pulled off balance by the force on the bag. My head becomes submerged as I‚Äôm dragged down stream by my wrist. I dig my heels in and pull back against the force, twisting my neck round to gasp for breath. Richard is watching me from beneath the tree. After a moment I have my head out of the water and my feet firmly planted on the ground. The current has dissipated. I examine the surroundings and find that I have only drifted a few feet off course, Chris is not too far away. The adrenaline dissipates, leaving me defenceless against the bitter cold. Wading over, I notice Chris‚Äô attention is fixed elsewhere.

‚ÄúHey, where did Richard go?‚Äù Chris asks sharply between harsh draws of breath. ‚ÄúDid you see him? I swear he was here just now‚Äù. I stop for breath and confirm for myself that, yes, you‚Äôre right, he‚Äôs not here, he has simply disappeared like he did before. Of course he did. I don‚Äôt even flinch at these embers of hope slipping through my fingers, I just focus on pulling myself towards the island.

We reach the slight stretch of land, now uninhabited. My bones slowly defrost from the water, teeth chattering. I click my headlamp on to confirm: no footprints, no disturbance of any kind. The river returns to a quiet trickle of water.

‚ÄúThis is fucked, where the fuck are we?‚Äù Chris panics, pulling his phone out his pocket and shaking off water droplets.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt feel my bloody fingers‚Äù he moans as he locks himself out. I release his phone from his grip to wipe the remaining water off on the grass and punch in his passcode.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs here, where‚Äôs the bag?‚Äù I search frantically, looking for a rucksack or a coat or something scattered on the ground. The phone says the trackers are still here, even if Richard is not.

‚ÄúWhere the fuck has he gone?‚Äù Chris whispers harshly for my attention, as if not to catch the attention of a nearby predator. His eyes are red and watery in the torchlight. I cannot give him any answers. ‚ÄúThat could not have been him, that was not fucking him, we‚Äôre fucked‚Äù. Still, I remain silent.

I push that pit in my stomach deep down, back into hell. Instead, I reach for my phone and raise it aloft. Still nothing. Fuck‚Äôs sake. Nothing has come through in the past day. No one knows where we are. We‚Äôve only been gone a day and a half. Jane is still at the cabin and is not expecting us back until at least Monday evening. We‚Äôre 22 miles off-track and one man down. Our reputation for disappearing for days at a time has proven to be a sore irony.

‚ÄúRight‚Äù I assert with all the authority I can muster, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs cut our losses, get the fuck away from here and set up camp somewhere. We‚Äôll head back as far as we can tomorrow and if I get any phone signal I‚Äôll call for a rescue team or something.‚Äù I attempt to instil a confidence in Chris which is not particularly well founded.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no signal anywhere, this place isn‚Äôt even on the fucking map‚Äù

‚ÄúLike I said we‚Äôre leaving here, we‚Äôre not staying, we‚Äôll set up camp about a mile away and we should get back just alright.‚Äù I spit with righteous indignation.

‚ÄúBut we can‚Äôt just leave Rich, like we can‚Äôt just leave him lost out here, he‚Äôs fucking somewhere right.‚Äù Chris pleads with an uncharacteristic meekness.

‚ÄúWell that‚Äôs his own fucking fault, isn‚Äôt it.‚Äù The comment lingers in the air, stinging my mouth with its vitriol. We wait in silence for a moment before I turn to head back.

My torch catches the base of the tree. I turn back to illuminate the trunk where I scan upwards towards the top, resting about head height. I stare at the carvings etched into the wood. Carefully sculpted are angular, geometric shapes, in rows running from top to bottom. I graze my fingers along them, recognising them to be Norse runes. Up and down, they have been carefully transcribed. I rub my fingertips together, examining the deep red coating they‚Äôve been gifted. The metallic smell confirms that it is blood. I examine the tree again and the entire face of the trunk has been haphazardly smeared in the same deep red.

A sense of realisation washes over me. This must be why Richard brought us here. Chris shuffles over, his blind panic now subsiding into a sense of calm. I know it, these are symbols of protection. They bring fortune and good luck to those who happen upon them. Chris eyes them up and down in silence. We both breathe calmness into our lungs. I retrieve my rucksack from the riverbed and carefully dig through it. I unsheathe a kitchen knife and bring it back to the tree. Scanning the bark for any signs of instruction, I rub more blood onto my fingers and examine it closely. It appears that the blood fixes a connection of some kind, between the donor and the runes. Endowing the traveller with good omens.

Chris, unspeaking, presents me with his palm. I look to him for approval before firmly pressing into it and slicing through the centre, just above his thumb and across his heart line. He doesn‚Äôt react. I present mine to him and do the same, digging in to ensure a decent about of blood. A sense of warmth grows from my hand, up my forearm and into my body. I inhale deeply and hold the moment in my mind. Taking his hand with mine we press them together, squeezing them with my other hand to strengthen the bond. We both reach for the tree and smear our own deep red paint over the runes.

I scan over the markings again and recognise some of them. ‚ÄòProtection‚Äô, ‚ÄòLove‚Äô, ‚ÄòGood Health‚Äô. Yes, this is what we need. We are out here, in the apathy and brutality of wilderness; These omens will protect us from whatever is lurking. Chris is smiling with his eyes; He knows it just like I do. I reach over and caress his face, smearing a line of blood across his forehead. I turn to study the runes. One calls out to me with an aura of love. Algis ‚Äì protection. Of course.

I clutch the knife and raise it to his forehead, delicately, but decisively carving the rune into his skin. He doesn‚Äôt flinch, holding the same euphoric expression but now grinning ear to ear. The job only takes a moment and, once finished I wipe the drops of blood across his face and cheeks. I pass him the knife and lean forward in excited anticipation. He carves Sowelo ‚Äì sun, into my forehead. Pure ecstasy. We are both overcome with awe at our good fortune. Richard has led us here to bring us out of the forests and into the light, back to our friends and family, waiting for us with open arms.

I feel the ground vibrate, shifting beneath our feet. We startle and step back. The ground gives way to a hole at the base of the tree. We pause for a moment as I peer into the newly formed chasm. It has opened up a tunnel into the earth, fit for man, stretching deep into blackness, curving underneath the tree and out of sight. Chris is staring deep into me. We share an unspoken knowledge of what we must do.

Chris once again presents me with his hand, face up towards the blackened sky. I rest it in mine and press the knife down into the first joint of his forefinger. It snaps with a satisfying cleanness. Chris stares at his palm with quiet solemnity. I move to the next finger and repeat the process. Crack. Just as pure as the first. One by one, each finger is severed at the first joint. I coddle the severed pieces in my hand with the care of rosary beads. He leans forward, eyes closed, as I gently place one of them in his mouth. The rest are tossed down the hole with a quiet murmur of prayer. He shuts his lips tight and holds it there, savouring the sensation in deep meditation.

Chris opens his eyes to take me in one final time. We share a look of knowing. His features betray the joy he is hiding. He is truly at peace. Without a sound, Chris slips into the hole beneath the tree, arms raised above his head to ease his descent. He vanishes into the abyss below without a single word. I remain on the overworld, now truly alone.

I raise my hand in the same ritual fashion and bring a knife to my forefinger and begin pressing down. A pain shoots through me. Not from my hand, but my face. I stagger backwards and clutch my jaw with both hands, dropping the knife. Tears rush down my cheeks as my facial muscles convulse. I‚Äôve been screaming, for a long time. My throat is red hot, torn to shreds. I look at my hands, I look at the tree, I look at the hole. I kneel over it on all fours and scream with all the strength I can muster.

‚ÄòChris! Chris!‚Äô I wail with a hoarseness that betrays my sheer panic. I shoot up to my feet and whip my head around to catch a sign of anything watching. The forest lies silent. Scrambling with reckless urgency, I head for water and start paddling. The cold is irrelevant in the face of the pain coursing through my face and hands. I pull the water past me and clamber for the riverbed. I don‚Äôt dare turn back to face what may be waiting for me. Instead, I head back into the forest and running faster that I ever thought capable of.

The wind brings me back around before the aching of my limbs sets in. I startle awake, fully clothed, sprawled out at the base of a tree. Dense forest surrounds me. The sun peers through the canopy as morning sets in. Frantically patting my pockets, I feel for my phone and‚Ä¶ nothing else. The woods are silent, no insects, no footsteps, just the faint sound of wind brushing past my ears. I let out a guttural, full bodied scream for what feels like hours. Nothing. I can taste dryness in my mouth, but that discomfort pales in comparison to the ruthless beating the rest of my body is reeling from.

Before my mind can begin processing it, my body starts moving. I‚Äôm pulled out of my fatigue by a primal thirst for survival. Stumbling through the forest, I push against the tree trunks to steady my balance and propel me forwards. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going. Thoughts of Chris and Richard hammer at the door of my mind as uninvited guests, demanding an audience. Their images don‚Äôt bring me tears, but stress. I need to help myself first, then I can help them. Licking my wounds out in the arse end of nowhere isn‚Äôt going to bring a rescue party.

I swipe my thumb over the jagged shards of my phone screen and enter the passcode. I open maps and hold it arm‚Äôs length in front of me, squinting into the dimmed light for a glimpse of my lifeline. No signal ‚Äì But GPS is working fine. Deep green smear enveloping face of the phone, no details whatsoever. Fine ‚Äì whatever. I can tell north from south like a tit from an arse now. I swivel on my heels, face southeast and keep walking.

After, I‚Äôm not sure how long, I find myself led to another clearing. The scenery breaks as abruptly as before, but now, I‚Äôm high up on a cliffside. Probably about 100, 200 feet below me is a sheer drop. An uninviting tangle of stone and fate beckons from the base of the cliff. From there the forest wrestles back control and sprawls endlessly in every direction beyond the horizon. Tears of stress concentrate in my eyes. Where the fuck did this come from? The forest has been nothing but a flat, uninterrupted plane for the entire trip, and now I‚Äôm standing a few hundred feet in the air? I‚Äôve not seen a single hill this entire trip. What the fuck is this.

I pause to collect myself and decide on the play. Like the river, the cliff face stretches for miles on each end; A fault line in the earth splitting the world into two halves. This is the way forward. The map proves aggravatingly useless, yet again at providing me with routes, or alternatives, or anything fucking helpful in the slightest.

My heart jumps and I almost drop the phone down the cliffside. The vibration sends tremors up my arm and my entire body into alert. Jane is calling. I stare dumbly at the screen for a beyond reasonable length of time. No emotions penetrate the fortress of my concentration as I raise the phone to my ear.

‚ÄúEd?‚Äù She asks sheepishly.

‚ÄúHoney? oh my god! I am so glad to hear your voice‚Äù. Relief washes over me as her voice lights a warm glow of hope.

‚ÄúWhere the *fuck* have you gone?‚Äù Her fury is palpable. The brief flicker of hope has been extinguished and my soul hollowed out.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve been worrying non-stop for the past three nights. Becky is worried. The kids are worried. Is Chris with you? What the fuck were you thinking?‚Äù I gasp to interrupt but Jane only builds momentum.

‚ÄúYou left in the dead of night. Two in the fucking morning. I called the police; They‚Äôve been searching for the past two days. What the fuck do I tell the kids?‚Äù

A headache burns from my forehead as I stammer a response to stem the tide of anger and accusation.

‚ÄúWe went hiking, it wasn‚Äôt ‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo fucking shit you went hiking, you took everything! Where have the kitchen knives gone? Becky was crying! The kids are terrified. What the fuck are you doing?‚Äù

My jaw hangs agape, defenceless against the pain of her scorn.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt know, I‚Äôm sorry. But we lost Richard, he went off and we had to‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWho the fuck is Richard?‚Äù she screams, her volume reaching a fever pitch. I have to pull the phone away from my ear. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck are you talking about? Who is Richard?‚Äù

I start to feel faint and stagger backwards, clutching at my stomach as I resist the urge to throw up.

‚ÄúHe, he came with us on the trip and we lost him and we went to find him but Chris‚Ä¶‚Äù I breathlessly scramble for an explanation.

‚ÄúWhat? Who is this? How the fuck did you end up in the middle of the forest with some random stranger? Where is Chris is *he* with you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo he‚Äôs gone he‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Äù

Jane screams in complete hysteria. ‚ÄúWhat do you mean he‚Äôs gone what‚Äôs happening!‚Äù

My hands are trembling, and my mind is vacant.

‚ÄúMe and Chris and Richard we were camping and the‚Ä¶ we were looking for‚Ä¶ he got lost in the woods so we started looking because the phone‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶ please‚Äù

My voice trails off as I hear sobbing down the other end of the phone. Jane‚Äôs anger has subsided into meek, desperate pleading for answers.

‚ÄúEd, where are you, can you tell me where you are‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre lost‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm lost. I don‚Äôt know where Chris is.‚Äù

At this point, I am spent. All I need is the confirmation of my worst suspicions.

‚ÄúMe, Richard, and Chris left on Friday afternoon and walked about 10 miles into the forest and set up camp‚Ä¶‚Äù I enunciate each of the details for my own sake as much as hers. It feels like a lie told to myself over and over until I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs truth.

‚ÄúEd, you‚Äôre really scaring me. Who is Richard? We don‚Äôt know a Richard. We‚Äôre in the middle of nowhere how did you meet him?‚Äù

I fall silent at the weight of this question. I hang up, message my location, and put the phone down.

I‚Äôm lost. Truly and definitively lost. For how long now I do not know. The tethers of reality I clung to have only served to drag me further in. I sit in silt and mud, reeling in the weight of the conversation. I‚Äôve been lost for a long while.

How many of us were there? How many of us were there ever on these trips? Was it three or just two, or four, or seven-and-a-half? Could there have been loads of us in a naked orgy for all I know, or was I just wanking myself off in the wilderness for a long weekend?

Richard and I were groomsmen for Chris and Becky‚Äôs wedding. We were at university together. He had been out with us every fucking year since we started hiking. What the fuck was she on about?

I sit with these thoughts for a while and come to no conclusions. Hugging my knees to my chest, the stress boils over into floods of tears. I wipe my face gaze at the beauty of the forest. From this vantage point, the true might of nature is at full display. Shades of green and black stand defiantly against the amber and gold of the setting sun. A perfect balance of all life, endless space and creation. From here I am gliding over it, stealing a view reserved only for the birds and the gods.

I drift through the next few hours like a ghost amongst the living. The sun has long since set and seeing anything more than a few feet away is impossible now. Not that it matters really. I tread, arms outstretched, stumbling through the overgrowth, feeling my way through the trees. There‚Äôs nothing left but to move. Even the wind has ceased caressing my ears with its soft whistling. The silence engulfs me in its firm embrace. Keep going. I tread aimlessly through the forest with only the faintest memory or care for directions. Keep going. Go on lad, keep moving. That‚Äôs it, steady on. You‚Äôre almost there! You‚Äôre on the way home lad. I can feel it in the distance! You‚Äôre doing it! You‚Äôre going. Oh my God, you‚Äôre going to get home. Bravo, my son! Keep pushing. KEEP PUSHING! YOU‚ÄôRE ALMOST THERE! YOU‚ÄôRE ALMOST FUCKING HOME, YOU‚ÄôRE HERE, YOU‚ÄôRE HERE!!!

I see a gentle light through the trees. A red hue bathes the far side of the trees and long streaks of overgrowth. Like a moth, I single-mindedly fall towards it, transfixed. It grows brighter, but I don‚Äôt squint. In the forest, nestled in a small clearing, no more than a few meters wide, is Richard‚Äôs tent. The soft torchlight glows from inside, dyed a warm red by its canvas walls, illuminating in all directions the blackness of the forest. It sits peacefully amongst the trees, a promise of comfort in a hostile world. Home.

I glide towards the tent, my feet no longer burdened by the traps and snares of the forest floor. My hand strokes the canvas, dispensing fragments of dried blood along its side. I inhale the warmth into my lungs. Crouching down, I reach around the left-hand side of the tent and gently tug on the zipper. It softly purrs as I trace the semi-circle of the opening. The canvas door falls away and grants me entry. Everything in here is Richard‚Äôs, neatly folded and arranged around the floor of the tent. LED lights emit a soft glow, twisted around the tent poles and suspended in the air like fireflies. Richard‚Äôs books and glasses sit patiently to the right of the tent, next to a flask of coffee and a cigarette. This is a man whom I understand with all my being. Two sleeping bags lay neatly in the centre. Chris is there, sleeping soundly on the floor.

A soft happiness fills my body. Chris‚Äô chest isn‚Äôt rising, but he looks peaceful. His eyes are closed, and a satisfied grin decorates his face. I lean closer towards him. He smells wonderful. His hands feel cold to the touch as I rub the stubs of his fingers. Facing away, I lay down next to him, curling into a slight fetal position to allow him to spoon my body. I snuggle my back into his chest as to warm him with my life.

Footsteps, emerging from the forest, move towards the tent, and a shadow appears against the canvas. It stretches high up the walls, either impossibly large or uncomfortably close. It begins circling us, with the crackling of dry leaves announcing every step. The shadow is joined by a second, entering into the parade around the tent. They clap and click in quiet rhythm. Slow and soft at first, the sound swells with confidence as another pair of hands join the ensemble. The shadows are accompanied by yet another which begins murmuring under its breath, clicking in counterpoint to the rest. I lay there in Chris‚Äô embrace, watching in quiet contemplation as the performance unfolds.

This rhythmic cacophony grows as drums, claps, snaps, shouts, and jeers form a rich tapestry of celebration outside. The shuffling of feet creates viscous white noise as at least a dozen bodies circle the tent. They all chant in unison a song, an ancient song. It spins me into a psychedelic ecstasy as I mouth the words along with them, failing to produce any sound. I lie there, unblinking, as a pool of spit forms on the ground beneath my mouth. Chris reaches over to my shoulder and wraps his arm around me, I warm his flesh with my love for all things. My eyes close as I become one with this moment.

The tent unzips and I feel something pulling at the floor. It steps inside and I am greeted with warm understanding throughout my body. Saying nothing, seeing nothing, I know it is Richard. My chest raises unevenly as I draw breath with excitement. He lays down in front of me and I hold him, trembling, the same way Chris is holding me. From the way he feels, I can tell he is longer, but I don‚Äôt open my eyes. The crowd grows louder in frenetic jubilation. I feel the heat emanating from Richard and his moisture coats my face, hands and clothes.

We lay here, together, in the centre of this world. This is truly the home I was seeking. I need no sound, no sight, no feeling. Just the knowledge that I will be held here in this space, entwined in the friendship of my greatest companions. Forever.",1,1737496913.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False
1i6ungz,https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckeatingdisorders/comments/1i6ungz/extreme_hunger_experience/,extreme hunger experience,"Hi! I've been in recovery for 2-3 months now (went on calorie deficit but unconsciously restricted fats for 2 months, lost 4kg and period) and wanted to share some of my experience :)

(I've had two periods now, waiting for my 3rd!)

Its been a whirlwind of emotions so I'm hoping someone can relate to this!

\+ My EH only lasted about 2-3 weeks after going ALL in. I went on holiday soon after starting recovery, but didn't notice EH there (a bit unfortunate because there was sm good food).

* Initially I felt like I was overeating and binging for a week straight. It felt so overwhelming that I could easily have 1000kcal meals and still want more, and there would be too many times I wanted to cry and eat at the same time. Very messy lol.
   * But also, ‚Äònormal‚Äô people will easily have 1000kcal meals when eating out and enjoy it. There was nothing ‚Äòwrong‚Äô with what I was doing.
* It was nice. So nice, being able to eat whatever and however much I wanted. It was euphoric and elating after a period of telling myself ‚Äúno you can‚Äôt have that it has too many calories, you‚Äôre going to blow your daily budget‚Äù, it was so freeing to just eat when I wanted to.
* It gave me the chance to try all the different foods I wanted. TooGoodToGo was also so fun during this period. I could explore different parts of my area, try small businesses, and enjoy my local bakeries. I would definitely recommend trying it out if it‚Äôs available where you live!
* TMI: SO MUCH BLOATING and GI issues. I looked proper pregnant the first few weeks. And going on a plane did not help. Plus I ate my packed sandwiches and snacks on top of my in-flight meals. Very yummy but very uncomfortable (thank god for winter and layering clothes).
* I still have zero physical cues and mainly rely on mental cues. But it would still get confusing and sometimes I have to actually start eating to notice that I was hungry.
* I went on holiday soon after starting recovery so I ate whatever and whenever intuitively (but had no EH :(). Was definitely really beneficial as I had no access to scales, calorie contents, or actual/proper exercise. Got to enjoy so much good food too!
* I've noticed that having too few calories in the morning + delayed meals (for like 5-6 hours cause work/back-to-back classes ugh) brings back my EH in the evening, so I try to prevent it by always having a snack on hand.
   * Having mainly whole foods + meals recently has helped me feel much better after, rather than eating processed 'junk' too >!(and then I'm surprised to find out that I've only actually had like 2500 calories today, rather than the anticipated 4000)!<
* I still walk a ton bc I kind of have to to get around + it really helps me mentally. Plus I get a natural incline and stairmaster lol. But I avoid high impact exercise like running bc it wears me out too much + triggers my EH.
* During my EH, one of my days would look like this >!(around 4500kcal)!<:
   * A proper bowl of homemade spaghetti bolognaise
   * 10 homemade dark chocolate blueberry pancakes with tons of honey and whipped cream (yes I ate a whole recipes worthü´ê)
   * 2 G√ú Dessert pots
   * A pumpkin seed bread sandwich with ham and cheese, with a bowl of crisps
   * A bowl of homemade lasagna
   * Two slices of lemon meringue pie
   * Blueberry custard bun
   * Lots of coffee with soy milk
* TW: Weight >!I did overshoot by 2kg, but have NO idea where it is. My body feels the same, I still fit my clothes from before, but my face has gotten thinner for some reason!<
* My signs of EH coming are: constant mental hunger RIGHT AFTER I'd had a meal, and airway/throat clearing/opening up feeling (like a breath of fresh air, idk its weird)
* I put complete and utter trust into my body. Yes, my mind would say I was eating way too much and that I‚Äôd gain so much weight. **But was it my body or my mind that made me lose my period?** My mind. Which was exactly why she was going to have to gain her trust back lol.

Remember, you can‚Äôt go over it, you can‚Äôt go under it, you‚Äôve got to go through it üêª (iykyk).

Sending everyone so much luck and love, we got this! üíó",1,1737496900.0,fuckeatingdisorders,1,1.0,False

How do I approach this?,"I (M35) have been married to my wife (29F) for over three years now. We don‚Äôt have kids yet, but we‚Äôre planning to start trying soon, which is why we both agreed to focus on getting healthier. She‚Äôs been overweight for a while, and while we‚Äôve talked about it before, our conversations often turn into arguments, which only causes more tension.

We both agreed that getting healthy was important, especially if we want to start a family. I suggested trying Weight Watchers, and after some hesitation, she agreed. I ended up paying for the annual subscription because I wanted to support her decision, and I didn‚Äôt want to push her too hard about what she eats.

She used it for a few weeks, but then she told me it made her feel self-conscious and discouraged, especially since she wasn't seeing immediate results. I encouraged her to stick with it, but she eventually stopped using it. We've both been making an effort to cook more at home and eat healthier, which has been good.

She asked me to quit smoking Marijuana, which I agreed to. I want to lead by example because I feel that if we‚Äôre both on the same page, it‚Äôll be easier for us to stick with it.

She‚Äôs expressed wanting to lose weight and improve her health, and I know she has health issues related to being overweight. 

However, recently, I found that she has been ordering Tim Hortons coffee and donuts almost every day when she‚Äôs at work. I‚Äôve tried to stay out of tracking her eating habits, but I can‚Äôt help but feel frustrated seeing this behavior, especially since it feels like we‚Äôre back in the same cycle of trying to eat healthy for a few days and then falling back into old habits.

I‚Äôm feeling really discouraged right now. Part of me feels like if she‚Äôs not fully committed to making these changes. 
I‚Äôm even starting to think I should go back to smoking if she‚Äôs not putting in the effort either, which I know isn‚Äôt the right mindset.

How do I approach this without sounding critical or controlling? I don‚Äôt want to monitor what she eats, but I do want us to work together to build a healthier future. Any advice on how to have a productive and supportive conversation about this?

It's somewhere between now and then.

Before here,

after there.

I'd quite like to visit again.

I can't remember where I left it.

I can't remember where I found it.

I know a place,

where your eyes melt like butter, as they meet me across the bar.

Before I know it, you're spreading this across my toast.

Come evening, I'm waiting on the roar of the broken exhaust on your car.


I know a place,

where showers don't exist in solitude.

Fogged glass leaves the weight of the world subdued,

Where fingertips linger on spines,

Droplets trace the shape of your face

Gently pattering, muffling the world outside.

I know a place,

where even silence feels like connection.

Where the world slips away, during a quiet affection.

A place lit with a flickering fire,

where the night hums low with cricket choirs.

Where our conversations are lost in the midst of indifferent pines.

Where the taste of you lingers on my lips, rich with red wine.

Where bat wings fleet the spaces

between us, then dissolve into places

deep in the sky.

I know a place,

where you dance like you have two left feet,

but dinner is always served with a kitchen serenade, hard to beat.

Where you still blush even though we are so familiar,

a place where things feel so much simpler.

Where we discover Christmas reggae,

camenbert and your aftershave slipping through my airways.

Where we dance barefoot on the sofa, sipping wray and nephew.

Where the cold outside feels less harsh, because I'm wrapped up in you.

In this place is first real tree I've ever had, and the first that feels like my own.

As I watch it wither way, I hope that we wont.


I know a place where late date night strolls,

turn into getting lost and finding something better than your way back.

Where the rest of the world is moving so fast paced,

that we almost miss it, tranquil in our own place.

We never worry about council tax bills or overdrafts,

In this place you always remember how to make me laugh,

I always remember to put milk in your coffee first,

I save postcards of our best days and you save room for my mistakes when I'm on my worst.


I know a place we can go,

Where pain doesn't linger or show.

No weight on my shoulders, no buzz in my brain.

No chattering behind my skull, no mental strain.

Here, worries don't envelop my chest,

Or weigh down my thoughts, under their press.

I know a place that doesn't remember me,

I know a place that just lets me be.

I know a place, I'm hoping you can help me find it.

1i6uk4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/JimCornette/comments/1i6uk4i/book_report_guy_with_a_detailed_post_on_the/,"Book report guy, with a detailed post on the history of the Hart Family after reading a half dozen books that were written by or about them. This one is kinda depressing tbh, but I have a morbid fascination with this fucked up family.","Having read a book that detailed the history of Stampede Wrestling, as well as a book that detailed Stu Hart's life, and the books written by Bret Hart, Bruce Hart, Diana Hart, Julie Hart and Dynamite Kid, I have compiled a wild family history.

This won't feature anything really on Stampede Wrestling promotion and instead be a deep dive into the family history of the various siblings. You won't see too much on Bret here tbh as that would end up dominating the whole post and believe it or not, I still had to cut a bunch of details out.

As always it's in chronological order, to tell best of my ability, and I hope y'all enjoy! 

Stu Hart's father Edward was late on arrival to a plot of land he was looking to purchase in Alberta, Canada in the mid 1920's, so the owner sold it to someone else. Edward contested this and actually settled on the land, setting himself and family up in tents, and living off the land while Edward traveled into the city everyday to deal with the legal logistics and contesting ownership with the the man who rightfully bought the land. Stu, his sisters, mother and father spent 4 years living in tents in central Alberta even through the freezing cold winters.

Eventually the RCMP (highway police in canada) got fed up with Edward and arrested him, sending Stu and his family to social services in Edmonton. But not before burning literally everything on the property, the houses Edward built and all of their belongings. Stu would reflect on this bitterly for the rest of his life. A few weeks later Edward was released and the family were back together.

While serving as an athletic coach for various military competitions during WWII, Stu would meet Joseph ""Tootz"" Mondt, a New York based wrestling promoter who told him to come work for him after he finishes up with the army. 

It would be in New York, while working for ""Toots"" Mondt, where Stu would meet his future wife Helen. He would eventually convince her to marry him, despite her family's reservations against pro wrestling. Apparently, Helen's mother never forgave Stu for taking her daughter away from New York and into the harsh winters of Montana and Alberta.


Their eldest son, Smith Hart, born in 1948, and by all accounts is a world class screw up, who Stu didn't respect much as an adult. 

While pregnant with their next child, Stu and Helen were in a bad car accident that where Helen told she would most likely lose the baby. Their 2nd child Bruce would be born in 1950, and this is possibly why Bruce had such a special connection with his mom that the other children didn't receive. Helen would give Bruce whatever he wanted and growing up in the position he was in, Bruce wanted to take over the family buisness, despite often butting heads with Stu over creative direction and the level of violence in matches. 

Due to the recovery period and new baby, their first born Smith was sent to live with his grandparents in New York, where Smith would be spoiled and given a skewed upbringing compared to his siblings. 

No one is confident about where the ""Hart Dungeon"" got its name, outside of the fact that it was an apt description of the basement. The floor lined with thin wrestling mats, that were blue when first installed, had since faded a dark yellow color from the sweat, blood, tears and even vomit over the years. Helen 

Helen was recovering in the Hospital from a that car accident when Stu bought the house and she fucking hated it when she finally saw it. 

Their 3rd child, Keith Hart was born next in 1952, and is often looked at as the more mature older siblings. 

After spending 2 years in New York, where Smith was allegedly spoiled and given anything he wanted, he was finally sent back home to Calgary in 1952. By the time he returned home to the Hart Mansion though, Keith Hart says Smith had turned into a ""spoiled little monster, who, I think, had a deep-rooted hatred for my dad, who had taken him away from this place where he could do anything he wanted.""

Their 4th child, Wayne Hart would be born the following year in '53, and would serve as a full-time Stampede Wrestling referee. Wayne never got involved in the drama and no one has anything bad to say about him. Except for Stu, who hated his long hair. Honestly, I always throw respect towards Wayne, who always managed to stay out of the drama with no issues amongst his siblings. Diana Hart shaded everyone in her book, even Ross, but she had nothing bad to say about Wayne.

Their 5th child, Dean Hart would be born next, in 1954, but would have little to do with the wrestling buisness. Most siblings like Diana, Bret and Bruce classify Dean as a smooth talking con-man of sorts.

Their 6th child, and first girl, Elizabeth ""Ellie"" Hart would be born in 1955, and years later, marry Jim Neidhart. Ellie is one that by all accounts, would deal with the most spousal abuse

Their 7th child, and second girl, Georgia Hart would be born in 1956. Georgia always comes off well in these stories about the Hart Family. She seemed very sweet to all her siblings.

Their 8th, and most famous child, Bret Hart, would be born in 1957. The most famous but possibly least liked by all his siblings.

Their 9th child and third girl, Allison Hart, would be born in 1959. Allison never seemed to like wrestling that much, and would grow to hate Vince McMahon with a passion. I'd say next to Bret, she at one point had the most rage built up, saying she hated Vince as much as she loved her dad.

Their 10th child, Ross Hart, would be born in 1960, who would go onto help with wrestling tv production and training at Stampede Wrestling. By all accounts, Ross sounds like the most intelligent of all the Hart children.

Their 11th child and youngest daughter, Diana Hart, would be born in 1963 and go on to marry ""The British Bulldog"" Davey Boy Smith. Diana is arguably the most controversial of the siblings.

Their final child, Owen would be born I'm 1965, and become one of the most beloved wrestlers of all time before tragically dying young in 1999.

Allison Hart also remembers how chaotic the home life was at Hart Mansion, where some mornings she would walk into the kitchen to be greeted by unknown Japanese wrestlers bowing to her, or how her father set up a wrestling ring in the backyard and you could hear screams and yelps of pain all day long from the backyard. She remembers one afternoon when her father was called to a local hotel because a midget wrestler of his was drunk and doing handstands on the roof.

Allison Hart remembers how if her or a sister brought home a date, their father Stu would size him up and take him down to the dungeon where he would stretch them until they screamed. Allison says that those dates would never ask them out again. Her future husband Ben Bassarab remembers Stu as a bully who would just hurt people without explaining anything that he was doing. 

In 2001, Diana Hart would write a scandalous and legal minefield of a book called ""Under The Mat."" It was quickly pulled from shelves after Owen Hart's widow Martha threatened legal action over what was said about her and Owen. Bret and Bruce also denounce the book, calling it mostly lies, but not everything can be written off as fiction, including stories, some wild stores about Dean Hart and their mother.

One big detail that most Hart kids argued against from Diana's ""Under The Mat"" book was her saying that their mom Helen Hart turned to significant alcohol use as a way to handle all the stress of her everyday life. While all the kids vehemently deny this, Helen's own autobiographical essay she did from 1977 actually supports the claim. In it she details how Stu would drink tea but her drink of choice was gin and how she would often hide somewhere in the big house away from her family. She notes how she felt outnumbered by the kids and all the responsibilities stressed her out. Allison Hart acknowledges that her mother would drink, but says the books claim of her being a ""raging alcoholic"" were an outright lie. Like I said, a lot of what was written in that book have since turned out to be true, though not all of it.

Dean Hart was an entrepreneur who started an Auto Body Shop in downtown Calgary and even owned a landscaping company, as well as managing a few outdoor concert venues.

Diana Hart remembers Dean as being smooth with older women, he would borrow their cars and persuade them to lend him money, Ross Hart would look back on Dean as a bit of a con artist. 

In 1978, Dean would be hit by a car that would do permanent damage to his kidneys and push him towards Marijuana use as a way to cope, and potentially other drugs but thats never confirmed.

The eldest child, Smith Hart lived a care free life where at best, most saw him as a good hearted screw up. He fathered (at least) 4 children under 4 different women, and even middle named his first child ""Ecstacy."" Though his siblings suspect the real number of kids to be closer to 12. The mother of his first child lived with him at The Hart House for years until they separated. One of her common activities was to strip naked, and stand on the balcony and wave at passerby folk. According to Diana Hart, she suffered from schizophrenia and compounded it with drug abuse. She would later die of phenomenon. 

The 2nd mother to Smith's child was a teenage runaway he met in his 30's, who would also pass away young in 1999. The Hart men and their obsession with younger women is genuinely disturbing.

In Bret Hart's book, he claimed that one of the girls Smith knocked up was a girl that Bret was currently seeing in Hughes school, so add another underage girl to the list here.

Smith lived with his parents literally until they died, and never really got into wrestling outside of a few matches in the 70's. Stu wouldn't let him anywhere near the buisness side of wrestling and some of the wrestlers remember how he would call Smith ""Shed"" which was short for ""Shithead."" Ouch. Ross Hart says that Stu nearly disowned him entirely on more than one occasion.

Bret Hart says Smith was ""neutered"" by his parents and ""turned into a toothless hound who never had much of a say in anything."" Smith denied these stories, instead claiming that he worked significantly in the buisness throughout the 70's and 80's, describing himself as his dad's ""troubleshooter"" and said he was even a booker for Stampede at times. He called himself a ""match making genius"" and that ""everything I did just worked really well."" No one, not a single person has ever backed this claim up, and most scoff at it.

One year Stu sent Dynamite Kid, Keith and Bruce to Germany for a show, but Keith couldn't make it, so Smith filled his place. The idiot actually shaved a Hitler mustache onto himself and did the goose walk to the ring to get ""heat"" and as you can imagine, Stu was furious.

Owen Hart was an known as a great prankster and hilarious jokester, but he wasn't a natural troublemaker. Owen both feared and respected his father and always wanted to make him proud, excelling in amature wrestling and football throughout high school. But Owen was quoted as saying that ""I was living my dad's dream, being an armature wrestler and going for the Olympics. But I hated it. When I would come home I'd want to please my dad, but I should have said 'I don't want this.'"" 

An ex-girlfriend of Owen's remembers how he never really wanted to wrestle or cared much for it, he wanted to be a teacher. She remembers a time when Bret asked Owen when he was going to start wrestling and she had to jump in for Owen's defence and express that he wasn't going to do that. Owen's widow Martha wrote in her book that ""Bruce was salivating at the thought of getting Owen in the ring."" 

BJ Annis was a Vietnam vet and pilot who met Georgia Hart when she was 19 working at the Calgary Stampede show and the two quickly started dating. Everyone was shocked to discover that the 2 had gotten married after just 5 months and didn't tell anyone for a long while. Helen was furious and actually asked Stu to stetch the poor guy in the dungeon. BJ to this day is thankful he was never stretched by Stu, and he is the only one of Stu's son-in-laws that can say that.

When Bret Hart was 21 years old, he met his 1st wife, Julie Smadu who was 17 years old when she was working a security booth at a wrestling show in Regina, Saskatchewan, along with her 14 year old sister Michelle. After months of flirting, Julie and Bret were an item, with Julie and Michelle moving to Calgary with him. Michelle would go onto meet and marry Bret's co-worker Dynamite Kid a few years later when she was only 17 and he was 22 year old. Julie and Bret Hart would be married later that year, after Michelle and Dynamite.

Dean Hart would move to Hawaii where he became involved with the Samoan Mafia, and while it's unclear how involved he became, Dean would find himself transporting boxes of money or drugs or weapons, wether willingly or unwilling is unclear. Later, some gangsters who were facing murder charges, believed Dean was going to testify against them, so Dean fled back to Calgary in 1981, thinking he left that all behind. But according to Diana, some of those gangsters followed him back to Calgary and nearly beat him near to death one night. 

In Diana's book, she talks about how fucked up Dean was afterwords with his kidneys failing. She said he would sit in front of the oven, open it up and crank it to 500 as he ate shaved ice. His kidneys couldn't even process water so Dean couldn't eat or drink, he just chewed on shaved ice as he deteriorated further and further.

After returning Calgary, Dean would attempt to jump into the family buisness in a backstage role, but was remembered as being bitter by his brothers like Bruce, Bret and Keith who by that time had carved out a spot for themselves in the promotion and buisness. 

When Bruce wasn't wrestling, he was a substitute teacher at a junior high school and after he ran into one of his students at a wrestling show, the rest of the family would be horrified to discover Bruce at over 30 years old, was dating a teenager! This girl named Andrea would end up pregnant in early 1983, when she was 16 and Bruce was 33! Other reports claim he was 34 and she was 15 but its hard to know what is ore accurate. Ross Hart defends his brother by saying ""it wasn't a scandle"" and ""they seemed to really love each other."" Seriously, this family and it's obsession with underage girls.

Annis Hart, Georgia and BJ's son was born in 1983, and had dreams of being a pro wrestler like his grandpa Stu and famous uncles. But stay tuned, because this family isn't about happy endings.

Also, in 1983, Allison Hart would marry Ben Bassarab, with Ben promising her he wouldn't get involved in wrestling, but quickly went back on his word when Allison's family invited him to come try out at a show. 

By all accounts, Ben Bassarab doesn't sound like a good husband or partner, and Allison soon realized after marriage that she wasn't a priority for him. When she was pregnant with their first child, Allison had to have an ovarian cyst removed, and just wanted to go home after the hospital. But Ben drove her to the Hart House so he could go drinking with Jim Neidhart and the boys in the back yard while Allison sat in the kitchen, crying in pain. When Keith came in for more beer and found his sister like that, he went outside to smarten up Ben, ordering to take Allison home. An enraged Ben would then take out his anger yelling at Allison, leading to an enraged Keith jumping into the vehicle instead of Allison and he started assaulting Ben. Ben couldn't do much as Keith shoved his head under the steering wheel and peppered him with strikes, before Stu yanked Keith out of the car and escorted Ben and Allison back to their house.

Allison was terrified of Ben by this point and begged Stu to not leave them alone but he did, ordering her to figure it out. Stu made it clear to Allison that divorce wasn't an option and she absolutely, must figure it out. 

Allison felt trapped, and years later Ben doesn't have much remorse for the situation, as he described to the author of a book in 2004, while sipping a Baileys and Coffee, all while laughing at how absurd the whole thing was. Ben says he would try to leave Allison, a few years later when he realised how ridiculous the whole situation was, being on the road 6 nights a week with girlfriends in every town, pretending to be a husband and father for a few hours a week. He arrogantly talks about leaving her like he was the bigger man to do it, and frames it as an act of kindness to her.

Ben recalls the day he went to Stu and admitted his infidelities and transgressions as a husband/ father, telling Stu he was going to divorce Allison as she clearly wishes. Stu was furious and Ben remembers how he angrily said ""You think your the first guy to have a relationship on the road!"" Ben wouldn't budge though, telling Stu that WWF had expressed interest in him. Ben believes Stu killed that possibility himself by contacting someone at WWF, though that's purely speculation and sounds like a guy blowing smoke up his own ass. 

Allison tried to make it work for a long time, despite knowing about his affairs and his treatment of her. Ben denies things ever got physical but Allison alludes otherwise. One day she said she was looking at her daughters, one a toddler and the other a newborn, when she decided she didn't want them raised by that man. On that day she finally defied her father, and called her lawyer to get the separation and divorce started.

In 1984, Diana Hart would marry Davey Boy Smith, though she was initially interested in his older cousin Dynamite Kid.

Also in 1984, Helen Hart was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and that, along with multiple business related factors, pushed Stu towards finally selling the promotion, and on Aug 24, 1984, Stu Hart officially sold his territory to Vince McMahon and the WWF. Bret Hart was promised a good spot on the card for WWF as well as a few other key guys, but Bruce Hart was notably not one of them. He was actually kept in the dark to the entire sale process and was blindsided by the news when he found out by seeing it reported on TV or the radio. Bruce was offered a small job where he would arrange behind the scenes stuff for the WWF, but he hated it.

Bruce Hart would be the one to blow up the whole deal, wether he realized it or not is up for debate. When an upstart promotion in Calgary tried to start up their own Stampede Wrestling in 1985 (Stu never trademarked it!) Bruce got involved behind the scenes briefly while he was still emplyed by WWF, and this was after Stu and Vince agreed no Hart would violate the no-compete claus they put in the deal. When Vince found out, he used this as leverage to back out of the sale of the territory.

In 1986 when Stampede was reopened and needed a new face, Bruce Hart convinced Owen Hart to jump in as it's star, despite his reservations to the sport overall.

Owen Hart and Martha were married in 1989, with Bruce Hart serving as best man. A week before the event, Bruce was travelling with a bunch of Stampede guys when a bitter Dynamite Kid organized a bit of a violent mutany that would see Dynamite break Bruce's jaw. Bruce decided he wouldn't go to Owen's wedding if Dynamite was there, so Keith Hart asked Dynamite to run a wrestling show that day. Dynamite agreed but would no-show the event and spend the day drinking alone at a strip club while his wife and the entire family celebrated Owen's wedding.

In the summer of 89, a bad car accident would quicken Stempede Wrestling's collapse and further strain the Hart Family. Ross Hart was driving a van with his brother-in-law Davey Boy Smith riding passenger, as well as Chris Benoit and Karl Moffat in the back. The vehicle would lose control and smash into a station wagon on the road, and thankfully Ross was wearing his seat belt and was fine. Benoit wasn't wearing a seat belt but allegedly Ross body was able to prevent Benoit from flying through the windshield. Moffat was screaming in the back seat about a broken leg, and poor Davey was unconscious after he smashed head first into the windshield. He too wasn't wearing a seat belt it would seem. Ross Hart called Davey's wife, his sister Diana, to tell her that Davey Boy was unresponsive and it was bad. She remembers how she could hear Moffat in the background screaming ""Oh God he's dead! Davey Boy is dead!"" He wasn't dead, but he was out of action for over 5 months, he required over 130 stitches in his forehead and had herniated two disc's in his spine.

Davey Boy struggled to work and make money in the years after Stampede closed down and following his bad car accident. According to Diana, he once borrowed money from a dangerous drug dealer named Hermesh Erach Austin, and in exchange, Davey Boy let him store stolen vehicles on his property. 

Remember Allison's piece of shit ex-husband Ben Bassarab, well he actually was close with this drug dealer as well, and maybe was the one who got Davey Boy in touch with him. Ben and this drug dealer would end up serving a year long prison sentence after they beat a man near to death for flushing $30,000 worth of cocain down a toilet. 

Side note: Hermesh Erach Austin would later be convicted to life in prison after he tortured and murdered some poor fellow, incorrectly believing he stole $10,000 from him. Austin crushed the man's hands in a vice, cut his ears off with scissors and burned the soles of his feet with a blow torch, all while this poor man begged and pleaded for his life. Austin then drove him a few miles out of Calgary where he slit his throat and shot him in the head before burrying him. A few years later one of his accomplices would flip on him and tell the police everything, leading to his arrest and sentencing. These are the types of people members of The Hart Family associate with. Diana Hart said in her book that her mother Helen let some random guy live at the Hart House for nearly a year, and the guy had a collection of child porn. Seriously.

Back to Dean Hart, the one nearly beaten to death and suffering from damaged kidneys. He was legitimately dying and needed a transplant. Diana talks about something in her book that I have always had an issue with, Dean just needed a basic kidney transplant and had 13 viable doners right there who all just watched him die. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't following doctors advice so there is a chance the donation would have been wasted, but it's still shocking that no one stepped up. Bret talked about this in his book, and spoke in shame about how he didn't want to derail his career before it got going in the late 80s when Dean needed the transplant. 

Diana says no one talked about a potential transplant too much and no doctors ever really pushed them to do it. They didn't know how fast Dean was dying and didn't realize the timetable he had. Diana spoke earlier in her book about how Stu hated being sick and trained his kids to think they were immune to illness. No one took Dean's kidney failure as seriously as they should have because they all thought the Hart's were indestructible at the time. How times change.

The last time Diana saw Dean, she asked him, ""how are you doing?"" To which Dean replied, ""Barely functioning."" They had a laugh and Diana didn't think much of it 

Two days later, Diana says Allison's daughter Brooke found Dean dead, naked and laying on the bathroom floor. 

In the summer of 1993, Davey Boy and Diana Hart were out dancing when a young man made lewd comments towards her, leading to an altercation between the two men. Eye witness accounts claim that Davey Boy just picked the kid up and spiked him down on his head, but Davey Boy claims he put him in a headlock and when he let go, the kid fell and cracked his head on the ground. Either way, the young man had brain damage and significant memory loss, and Davey was being sued. Ultimately the judge ruled in his favor, but according to Diana the whole ordeal strained their marriage and cost the Hart Family over $300,000 in legal fees.

By the mid 90s, Ellie Hart's life with Jim Neidhart turned into a nightmare. After returning to Calgary in 1995, Jim was long past his most succesful time as a pro wrestler and the two fell on hard financial times forcing them to move into a home that Stu bought for them. 

In a series of sworn affidavits, Ellie alleges that Neidhart was a chronic alcoholic and drug abuser. She also claims she suffered years of physical abuse, though that was never proven in a court of law. While Stu was very, very against the idea of divorce, as he would demonstrate with his daughters failed marriages, he did support Ellie leaving Jim. In a letter Stu wrote to Jim, he told him to find a new living situation, with Stu pointing out that Ellie is fearful for her safety when Jim is around.

Diana claimed in her book that Neidhart told Davey Boy how to drug and r@pe Diana, because that's what she said Neidhart was doing to Ellie. It's really fucked up how casual Ellie was when confirming to Diana that they were both being drugged and r@ped by their husbands.

The next big loss to the Hart Family would come in 1996. Remember Georgia and BJ's son Annis, who i mentioned earlier, wanted to be a pro wrestler when he grew up. Well unfortunately this kid suffered a minor injury when he was 13 that left him unable to walk for a bit, and while at the hospital, they discovered he had a bad flesh eating disease. Nattie Hart, the daughter of Ellie and Jim Neidhart, remembers ""one day he was fine, but 12 days later he had 30 pounds of puss coving his body, his blood was rising to the surface and his skin was like burnt wood."" The family rallied around his bed in the hospital and Owen Hart promised him the keys to his mustang when Annis recovered. Unfortunately Annis would pass away 2 weeks later on July 14th, 1996, joining his uncle Dean as one of the Hart's taken far too soon.

Davey Boy's health and addiction issues only got worse through the 90s, until he would struggle to feed himself. Diana bought a water gun and would spray him every time he dropped a fork, and her sisters would chastise her for her treatment of Davey Boy. But she would fire back with ""am I the only one who noticed that he can't feed himself!?""

Things reached a boiling point for the couple in 1998, when a groggy Davey Boy couldn't even stand, so a frustrated Diana decided to take her own life, screaming at him that he did this. A useless Davey Boy could only look on and slur the words ""don't do it"" as she swallowed an entire bottle of Xanax. She immediately regretted her decision and was able to call 911 before passing out and waking up a day later at the hospital.

Keith Hart says the suicide attempt changed her, wether it was hitting that low of a point or an actual chemical imbalance from the Xanax, Keith says she lost her spark of confidence afterwards and was never the same.

After the Montreal Screwjob, Owen tried and failed to get out of his contract along with Neidhart and Davey Boy. Davey Boy claims he had to pay $100,000 to get out, but Neidhart wasn't under contract and just walked. Vince wouldn't let Owen go but did give him a raise from $300,000 per year to $400,000. 

Martha Hart, Owen's widow, claims he was very unhappy and felt trapped in that position. She also says he turned down a program with Goldust, because he hated the character. She also said he turned down a storyline that would have seen him and Jeff Jarrett both ""sleeping"" with their valet Debra.

Owen turned down so many ideas that he felt like he couldn't turn down one more, so when he was given the orders to wear the Blue Blazer suit and fly from the rafters, he reluctantly agreed. Owen allegedly told several guys backstage that he didn't feel comfortable with the stunt.

At 7:41pm on May 23rd, 1999, at a show in Kansas City, the lights dimmed and Owen Hart readied himself in the rafters and began to be carried out. Owen made what appeared to be an adjustment to his cape, and the three men up in the rafters to help him, all heard the click of the snap shackle being released. By the time they looked over at Owen, they all claimed he was clawing at the air as he fell to his death.

Martha not only invited Vince McMahon to the funeral, she insisted he come so he can see and face the corpse of the man he sent to die and the fatherless children he left behind.

Martha Hart, along with Stu and Helen Hart would sue Vince McMahon and 12 others, including the riggers who set up the harness and Kansas City, which owned the arena Owen died in.  Eventually, Martha would agree to settle, for $18 million, with 10 going to Martha, her kids getting 3 each and 1 million going to Stu and Helen. After all the legal fees though, Stu and Helen would recieve less than $700,000 each.

After Diana finally divorced Davey Boy in 2000, he got back at her by sleeping with Bruce's wife and Diana's friend, Andrea Hart. Remember the teenager Bruce knocked up? Yep, Bruce's young wife Andrea would cheat on him with Davey Boy, and eventually leave Bruce for Davey. 

Davey Boy would actually be arrested and charged for threatening to kill his wife Diana and sister-in-law Ellie. He even threatened to slit the throat of some guy she was trying to date at the time. Throughout the trial, Davey Boy was accompanied by Bruce's wife Andrea, the mother of his 5 children. What a trashy family.

When WWF ran a RAW episode in Calgary in 2001, Martha publicly said any Hart who attended would be disrespecting the memory of Owen Hart. Bret felt the same way and promised Martha they wouldn't be attending, but Bruce and Ellie came to the Hart House early and picked up Stu before Bret could stop him. Helen opted to wait for Bret, who convinced her not to go once he finally got there. At the show, Stu looking gaunt and sickly from pneumonia and heart problems, had to be helped to his feet by Bruce, as Diana, Smith, Ellie and many grandkids all stood up and waved too. Smith gave a sly smile and held up a sign that said ""Hi, Bret."" 

A few weeks after September 11th, 2001, Helen Hart was flying back home and was held up for hours in the heightened security following the terrorist attacks. During the commotion, the long-suffering diabetics blood sugar levels went awry, and when she got home that night she immediately went to sleep. The next morning Stu couldn't wake her and an ambulance was called.

A week later, with Stu never leaving her side, she woke up and Stu was able to read her poetry and everyone began to hope for the best.

Unfortunately she never left that hospital, and on Nov 4th, a few weeks later it was clear she was nearing the end. So Stu sat down next to her and said ""if you could smile for me one more time, it would mean everything to me."" Helen laid her eyes on the love of her life and smiled at him, granting him this one last wish. A teary eyed Stu Hart would kiss her on the forehead and say his goodbyes.

Alison remembers gathering for supper on the Sunday after Helen died, and being in shock when Stu sat down and just started bawling his eyes out, he couldn't stop crying. A panicked Allison called Bret, scared and unsure what to do. Bret told her to just let him cry, that he needs to let it out. Allison knew he was right, but it shook her to her core to see her dad like that, she remembers how she needed him to be strong for her one more time.

The funeral was a dignified event with the Alberta primer, old Stampede broadcaster Ed Whalen and Bret Hart giving heavy speeches. It was Stu that stood out though, demonstrating a clarity that was rare for him in his age, he spoke about the love he had for Helen, ""I'm glad for the time I had with her,"" he said full of love, but his pain was on display too, ""Ill never get over this"" he finished solemnly, ""I don't have enough time.""

Stu was still grieving Helen when he got word that his old friend Ed Whalen died just a few weeks later, of a heart attack.

A few months later, Davey Boy Smith wrestled his last match on May 11th, 2002 where he got to team with his 16 year old son. This was supposed to start his 2nd attempt at a comeback where he would bring his son in with him. Obviously that never happened, but his son looks back fondly on that match they luckily got to share.

In May 2002, Davey Boy and his girlfriend (Bruce's young wife Andrea) were on vacation when Davey Boy died in his sleep of ""natural causes."" Though the corner report had to point out all the steroid use that led to his death. Andrea claims they were discussing marriage, but Davey Boy's daughter claims he was visiting Diana 3 days before he died, attempting to get back with her.

Apparently, both Diana and Andrea held their own funeral services for Davey Boy, trying to out preform the other. Good lord.

A few weeks later Bret would suffer a stroke on his bike that left him paralyzed and hospital bed ridden for over a month. Hart remembers spending most days unable to move, crying and wondering what curse fell upon the Hart Family to cause all this misfortune. He was finally able to get himself up to walk when his dad came to visit, Bret was tearful and proud of himself as he embraced his father of his own volition.

Stu's granddaughters Jenny and Nattie had been living with him and taking care of him, giving him his medication/shots or what ever else he needed. In the months since Helen passed it seemed he was deteriorating at an alarming rate. One day in October 2001, Nattie and Jenny noticed that a cut on his arm now looked infected and took him to the hospital. There it was determined he had a staph infection and he would never be able to return to the Hart House. He would now need round the clock full time care.

On October 16th, 2001, Stu Hart died in his sleep, with Bret Hart, Bret's ex-wife Julie and Stu's granddaughter Jenny by his side. Diana was quoted hours later saying ""I think he really anticipated being with my mom again. She was reaching out to him and he was ready to go.""

Stu's funeral was the one time all the kids put their bullshit to the side and just held hands with their heads held low. Bret and Bruce even embraced for the first time in a long while, joined by Ross.

The Hart House was sold in May 2004, despite reservations from Smith who still lived there, and Bruce who wanted to turn it into a museum to make money off of. As soon as it was sold, the family decended into fights over who gets what and soon things were just disappearing altogether. Keith Hart had promised Martha a framed picture of Owen as a baby, but when he went to get it, it was gone.

The Hart House was sold with the written agreement that it wouldnt be torn down. The new owner can do as they please so long as it stays standing.

Getting Smith out of the house was a frustrating endeavor, since Smith had turned the house into a hostel of sorts, even charging street folk to spend the night. Smith was trying to cook a disgusting and smelly fish when Keith arrived to tell him he has to leave, that the house is sold and the new owner will be there soon. Keith remembers how Smith refused to leave until Keith threw the fish out the window and threatened to drop his older brother where he stands. The next day, Keith got a call from the new owners saying that if Smith isn't gone then the deal is off. Keith went to ensure he was still gone but was shocked to find Smith had climbed in a side window and had to be ran off one final time. Smith claims he installed a set of swinging doors that were his and he was just removing them before leaving for good.

While interviewing Allison for the book, the author notes how trapped in the past she was, endless talking about Owen, Stu, Helen, and the world that was taken from their family, the unjust acts of Vince McMahon and how much she hates him. She said she hates Vince McMahon as much as she loved her dad. Keith and Ross are both level headed and seem at peace with their past when discussing it. 

Ellie and Jim Neidhart continued their tumultuous relationship, and would be sued by a Calgary man who claims the couple broke into his house and stole $9000 worth of jewelry. It was settled out of court and Jim explains that it was a misunderstanding where he was helping the man's wife pawn jewelry for a car and forgot to pay him back. Nattie was and still is horrified and embarrassed by the story, always quick to jump to her mother's defence, explaining how she wasn't even in Calgary at the time of the incident! 

Bret Hart was able to recover from his stroke and would go on to preform in plays and other theatrical endeavors. The stroke left him in a place where he struggled to remember lines and even appointments, and while he still works out multiple times a day, it's clear he will never have even a fraction of the strength or skills he once had.

Some of Bret's siblings complain that he is too egotistical and wrapped up in the Hitman character, that they have to go through a publicist if they just want to chat with their brother. He was remarried in 2004 but didn't tell most of his family for months. Some siblings say they found out in the newspaper.

""Bruce is still substitute teaching, wearing his wrestling boots to school, his Stampede shirt on full display, his hair bleached blond as if he is ready to cut a promo. Bruce is still waiting for his big break"" Keith Hart says while talking pitifully about his older brother. Keith always blamed Bruce for pushing Stu to keep Stampede open through the 80's and for draining all the Hart Family funds to do so. Keith laments how Bruce could have got a full-time gig teaching, he could have set himself up with a pension, but he couldn't get over the idea that he would be a big star one day, like his dad. 

Keith sees Bruce as someone deluding themselves into thinking he is still young and hopeful. ""He sold his soul to wrestling"" Keith would finish saying, ""one day he will have to look at that picture of Bruce Hart ... and see what he really looks like.""

Bruce believes he is fulfilling his legacy, carrying on the Hart Family tradition saying ""I'm just an extension of Stu anyway.""

Keith hotly rejects this notion. ""Bruce was not representing of my dad. He thinks he is, but my dad didn't appreciate his style of wrestling. Bruce was not heroic in my dad's eyes, and that was the saddest thing, for maybe both of them."" Keith would say of Bruce and Stu's relationship, ""He loved my dad, but my dad never credited him as being anything. He wasn't a tough guy. He never earned my dad's respect."" Ouch...

While writing this book, the author met with most of the kids, and was hopeful that Bruce would contribute as much as Keith or Ross or Alison had, but Bruce just wanted the author to write about the new Stampede Wrestling show Bruce was starting up and how great it is. He told the author how he had turned down sending Stampede guys to the MTV/ WWE Tough Enough show on some misplaced principles he held, and how he had a movie script written that was ""better than Rocky"" and was about this small independent wrestling promotion taking down the big bad giant one that ruled the world. Bruce eventually ghosted the author when he figured out the author didn't care.

I have more to say but im running out of room on the post so ill stop it here. Ill leave a comment below that details where each kid ended up. I legitimately cant fit that here lol

Ill be back with the last Jericho post, as well as more from Vince, the Harts and that Madusa book soon. I also have some other ideas like posting a collection of all the different random road stories or backstage brawls that have been recorded in these books. Hope y'all have a great day!

She was from Venezuela and didn't speak really any english. I speak some spanish and we used the translator which is fine, not the first date i've went on like that. I am a white man but I do like latina women.

First off, when I suggested a first date of a coffee or something, she asked if we could go for dinner. I usually don't like doing this because sometimes after 10 mins, I know i'm not into her and I'm always going to pay the bill regardless and it's just a waste of money and honestly a scam.

The restaurant she suggested, which ended up not being open, was super expensive. I chose another restaurant that was nice and def a little pricey. 

We had a great time and she is really into me, but when I asked to kiss her when leaving, I think I said ""I want to kiss you"" so not as much even asking, and she said something along the lines of ""That's so nice, but can we take it slow?"" 
Obviously my response was yes, of course we can, but something about it just made me think about her timeline with intimacy here.
(not to even mention the fact that I spent over $100 on dinner) 

I am a very kind and respectful person, and absolutely hate when I hurt someone, but that happens in relationships. I am also not someone at all who expects to have sex on first date or anything. 

But, I do think sex is an important part of the relationship and I'm not someone who wants to wait 2 months before sleeping with that person.

I also do like affection and at least have some touch and intimacy even if no sex.

Idk if this matters, but she also has a 4 year old son who lives in Venezuela. There may not be any logic to this. but I feel like women who sleep with guys earlier/get screwed over/have children always make the next guys kinda pay for their mistakes and make the next guy wait 5x as long to sleep with you. It kinda annoys me. 

What's the best way I can have this convo without sounding like a dickhead?


Thanks!

I will preface what is next by saying I am aware of a chance that he may not be our DC forever or maybe even next season. Normally losing an elite coach would cause an immense amount of anxiety but for me with Knowles, its different.

Why? I take you back to September 11th 2001, yea you all remember that day. I hate to bring it up, but we got dominated on defense. Defense barely had a pulse. Multiple heartbreaking long runs, and inevitably a really good Buckeye offense that was never going to succeed with that level of defense we had. I often look back at that UO game as a turning point for Ryan and a lot of the defenders that were in those meetings then who stayed through last night.

Fast forward to December 7th of 2021, here comes a man by the name of Jim Knowles. A well respected defensive guru of genius proportions who most fans were unfamiliar with. Coming in with a unique 3-3-5/4-2-5 defense, meant to cause confusion from alignment and disguises, with a high trust in the back-end. Jim was finally blessed with defensive talent that he had never had before. We all knew with time he would make a difference.

With 9 returning defenders and a 3rd year of Knowles' defense in place this 2024 defense was prepared to do something special. And boy did they ever. One of the best defenses I have ever seen in CFB in over 20+ years of watching pretty much everyone. Tasked with being the anchor of a program trying to return to the promise land that has evaded us over so slightly over the past decade, they all delivered.

At least 7 different instances this season opponents had the ball inside our 10 yard line, we all know that those drives resulted in 7 points. 7 Ohio State points. Giving up only 2 scores a game on average, damn near having as many sacks in the CFP than we did all season. The defense stepped up the closer they got to achieving the goal. Give us an inch, and we'll defend it. That is Jim Knowles and his guys. Knowing who they were for 3 years, just growing and learning, and trusting one another. 

I cannot voice my appreciation for Jim Knowles enough. I say all of this to say, Jim, IF, and I mean IF, this is it for you in Columbus. On behalf of Buckeye Nation, the 2021 class, and the rest of your 2024 National Champions, THANK YOU.

You were a hired gun of sorts, a mercenary if you will, sometimes people aren't meant to stay in your life forever, sometimes people come around to teach you something and move on. Jim you taught us all to trust your brothers, trust your instincts, and play with an intensity this defense had been missing for a while. You helped bring the Silver Bullets back, and those Silver Bullets brought this city and university another championship.

If this is it. Whatever is next for you, I hope they keep the coffee warm and fresh for you. You deserve all the praise in the world.

Thank you Jim. ",3,1737496349.0,OhioStateFootball,0,0.8,False

1i6udyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BarndosAndCabins/comments/1i6udyx/metal_cabin/,Metal Cabin,"Advantages of Choosing a Metal Cabin for Your Outdoor Space
-----------------------------------------------------------

When considering enhancing your outdoor space, a metal cabin stands out as a unique and advantageous option. These cabins have gained popularity for a variety of reasons, providing both functionality and aesthetics. Here‚Äôs why choosing a metal cabin can be the right decision for your outdoor area.

### Durability and Longevity

One of the most significant advantages of a metal cabin is its durability. Metal structures are built to last, resisting wear and tear better than traditional wooden cabins. Unlike wood, which can rot, warp, or be compromised by pests, metal remains steadfast against nature's elements. This resilience means that your investment in a metal cabin can yield rewards for many years.

### Minimal Maintenance

Maintenance can often be a burden when it comes to outdoor structures. However, metal cabins require far less upkeep compared to other materials. You won‚Äôt need to worry about painting, sealing, or treating for pests. A simple wash with soap and water is usually enough to keep it looking fresh and clean. This benefit frees up your time to enjoy your outdoor space rather than maintain it.

### Energy Efficiency

Energy efficiency is another crucial factor to consider. Many metal cabins come with insulation options that help regulate indoor temperatures. This means your cabin will stay warmer in winter and cooler in summer, potentially lowering your energy bills. By choosing the right insulation, you can enjoy comfort year-round without excessive heating or cooling costs.

### Customizability

Metal cabins can be tailored to meet your specific needs and style preferences. You can choose from a variety of sizes, colors, and designs, ensuring that your cabin fits perfectly within your outdoor space. Whether you envision a cozy retreat, a workspace, or a storage area, a metal cabin can be designed just for you.

### Cost-Effectiveness

In terms of cost, metal cabins tend to be more affordable than their wooden counterparts. Although the initial investment may sometimes be slightly higher, the long-term savings are significant. You save on maintenance costs and repairs and enjoy the benefits of energy efficiency. Additionally, metal cabins can add value to your property, making them a smart financial investment.

### Eco-Friendly Options

As sustainability becomes more important, many manufacturers now offer eco-friendly metal cabins. These cabins utilize recyclable materials and are often produced with minimal waste. By choosing a metal cabin, you not only benefit from a strong structure but also contribute to environmental conservation.

### Safety and Security

Safety is paramount when it comes to any structure. Metal cabins offer superior resistance to fire, making them a safer choice than wooden constructions. Additionally, their robust design makes them more secure against intrusions, providing peace of mind for you and your loved ones.

### Variety of Uses

Metal cabins are incredibly versatile and can serve many purposes. Here are just a few ways you can utilize a metal cabin:

- **Guest House:** Create a welcoming space for friends and family.
- **Studio:** Set up an art or music studio away from distractions.
- **Workshop:** Use it as a dedicated space for hobbies and crafts.
- **Storage:** Store your tools, gardening equipment, or seasonal items securely.

### Quick Construction

Building a metal cabin often takes less time than constructing a traditional wooden structure. Many metal cabins come as pre-fabricated kits, allowing for faster installation. If you‚Äôre eager to enjoy your new outdoor space, this ensures you can get started quickly.

A metal cabin offers numerous advantages, from durability and low maintenance to energy efficiency and safety. With options to customize and the versatility to suit various needs, it‚Äôs an excellent addition to any outdoor area. So if you‚Äôre looking to enhance your space, consider the many benefits that a metal cabin can provide for you and your lifestyle.

Design Ideas to Personalize Your Metal Cabin Experience
-------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever dreamed of a cozy retreat that blends the rugged charm of a cabin with the contemporary touch of metal? A metal cabin can be your perfect escape, offering durability along with a unique aesthetic. Once you have your structure in place, it‚Äôs time to infuse your personality into the design. Here are some creative ideas to help transform your metal cabin into a personalized haven.

### Color and Exterior Finishes

The first step in personalizing your metal cabin is choosing the right color. While traditional metal cabins often come in neutral tones, you can break the mold. Consider vibrant hues that reflect your personality:

- **Bold Reds or Blues:** These colors make a statement and enhance the cabin's presence in natural surroundings.
- **Earthy Greens:** Integrate your space with nature, creating a harmonious environment.
- **Custom Finishes:** Explore weathered patinas or metallic finishes for added depth and character.

### Landscaping and Outdoor Spaces

Landscaping is essential to enhancing the appeal of your metal cabin. Create inviting outdoor spaces that beckon relaxation:

- **Deck or Porch:** A wooden deck or porch can soften the metallic edges and provide a perfect spot for sipping coffee or enjoying sunsets.
- **Garden Paths:** Use stones or gravel to create pathways that lead to secluded areas around your cabin for a touch of adventure.
- **Plant Varieties:** Opt for native plants that thrive in your area's climate, ensuring low maintenance and vibrant blooms.

### Unique Interior Decor

When it comes to the interior of your metal cabin, think about ways to express your style through decor:

- **Rustic Furniture:** Incorporate reclaimed wood or vintage furniture to enhance the cozy feel and contrast with the metal structure.
- **Custom Art:** Hang local artwork or your own creations that reflect your interests and experiences.
- **Textiles:** Use warm throws and cushions to add softness and color, making the space feel inviting.

### Lighting Ideas

Lighting plays a critical role in setting the mood of your space. Consider these options:

- **Statement Fixtures:** Choose pendant lights made from wood or wrought iron to blend rustic and contemporary styles.
- **Ambient Lighting:** Use string lights around your deck or install wall sconces to create a warm glow in the evenings.
- **Natural Light:** Maximize windows to allow sunlight in, making the cabin feel open and connected to the outdoors.

### Functional Spaces

Think about how you use your metal cabin and design functional spaces that cater to your lifestyle:

- **Reading Nook:** Create a cozy corner with a comfortable chair, a small bookshelf, and good lighting for your reading sessions.
- **Workstation:** If you work remotely or have projects in mind, set up a dedicated workspace with functional furniture that complements your interior.
- **Entertainment Area:** Design a space for family and friends to gather, complete with games, a movie projector, or a fire pit outside.

### Personal Touches

Don‚Äôt forget to add personal touches that reflect who you are:

- **Family Photos:** Incorporate framed pictures that make you feel nostalgic and connect with your roots.
- **Craft Creations:** Display your handmade crafts or hobbies to showcase your creativity and interests.
- **Memorabilia:** Adorn walls with items from your travels or experiences that have made you who you are.

With a few thoughtful design choices, you can transform your metal cabin into a true reflection of your personality. From the colors you choose to the layouts you prioritize, every detail counts. Enjoy the process of creating a space that feels uniquely yours, and let your metal cabin become an extension of your lifestyle and passions.

### Conclusion

Choosing a metal cabin for your outdoor space opens the door to a wide array of benefits that go beyond mere aesthetics. With their durability, low maintenance requirements, and resistance to pests, metal cabins offer a practical and long-lasting solution for anyone looking to enhance their outdoor experience. They can withstand the elements far better than traditional wooden structures, allowing you to enjoy your cabin for years to come without constant repairs.

Personalizing your metal cabin can transform it from a simple structure into a unique retreat that reflects your individual style. From adding colorful siding and flora to incorporating innovative interior designs, there are countless ways to make your cabin truly yours. Whether you want a cozy reading nook, a vibrant outdoor barbecue spot, or an art studio brimming with creativity, your imagination can turn a basic metal cabin into a delightful escape that meets your needs.

Ultimately, investing in a metal cabin blends functionality with creativity, providing you a space where you can relax, unwind, or engage in your favorite hobbies. If you‚Äôre looking to make the most out of your outdoor space, exploring the possibilities of a metal cabin is a fantastic choice. It allows for a robust structure that you can design according to your personal taste, ensuring that it not only complements your lifestyle but also enhances the beauty of your surroundings and enriches your time spent in nature.",1,1737496239.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

I hope that some of you are able to make it out to Sundance over the next few weeks. 

Every year, there are films that no one has heard of that end up making a lot of noise. One that has snuck under the radar for most folks this year is *Sunfish (& Other Stories on Green Lake)*, but with the legendary Joanna Hogg hopping on board before its official premiere, it's quickly becoming one of the ""must-watch"" films of the festival.

I was fortunate enough to be able to chat with DP Marcus Patterson about the film. You can read the full article at [https://pointsofreviews.com/sunfish-other-stories-on-green-lake-cinematographer-marcus-patterson/](https://pointsofreviews.com/sunfish-other-stories-on-green-lake-cinematographer-marcus-patterson/) (which is always appreciated, of course) - but I've also copied the interview down below.

Happy Sundancing for those who are catching some flicks, and I'll be back in 6 months - 2 years to chat again when most of these films actually come out for ""real""!

[*SUNFISH (& Other Stories on Green Lake)*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/67531ef268b8b7d56dfe338e)¬†is one of many films making its premiere at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. The initial buzz around the movie may feel subdued when placed directly next to films like¬†[*Atropia*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6753268268b8b78fabfe3efb)*,*¬†[*Jimpa*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/67531ffe707ccdb18d0888c3)*,*¬†[*If I Had Legs I‚Äôd Kick You*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/67531e0d707ccd55f3088423)*,*¬†[*The Thing with Feathers*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/67532523707ccdd157088fb0),¬†[*Opus*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/67532daf707ccd2b7608a24e), and¬†[*Omaha*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/675322a468b8b799a0fe3800)*.*¬†Still,¬†*Sunfish*¬†has slowly inserted itself into the conversation as one of the ‚Äúmust-watch‚Äù films of the festival. As if to put an exclamation point on this sneaky revelation, it was announced earlier this week that¬†[**Joanna Hogg**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0389712/)¬†(*The Souvenir, The Eternal Daughter*) has hopped on board as executive producer, praising the film for its¬†[‚Äúsensitive characterization and beautiful storytelling‚Äù](https://variety.com/2025/film/news/director-sierra-falconer-sunfish-signs-wme-sundance-1236276151/), which left her feeling ‚Äúknocked out‚Äù. Having such a respected name in the industry tied to the film prior to its premiere underscores its potential.

The film itself is described as a¬†[‚Äúperceptive debut‚Äù](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/67531ef268b8b7d56dfe338e)¬†centered on a singular place ([Green Lake, Michigan](https://www.lake-link.com/michigan-lakes/grand-traverse-county/green-lake/22384/)), but told through several different stories ‚Äì a girl learning to sail, a boy fighting for first chair, two sisters operating a bed-and-breakfast, and a fisherman after the catch of his life. What ties these stories together is the memory of Green Lake. The water, the hammock by the lake, and the light spilling in through the kitchen window. In tandem with director¬†[**Sierra Falconer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30uWQlXvZ7E), this feeling of ‚Äúmemory‚Äù and ‚Äúnostalgia‚Äù is crafted by cinematographer¬†[**Marcus Patterson**](https://www.marcuspatterson.com/about).

It was a pleasure talking with him, as he shared more about Falconer‚Äôs vision for this film (rooted in her own experiences on the lake). We chatted about the photographs that inspired the film‚Äôs visual language, the challenges of shooting on location, and some of the most influential films and filmmakers in Patterson‚Äôs life and work.

\---

**Adam Manery: When folks ask you to describe**¬†***Sunfish (& Other Stories on Green Lake*****), what do you tell them?**

**Marcus Patterson:**¬†I tend to tell people it‚Äôs a portrait of several different lives around this real place in Green Lake, Michigan. Our director¬†grew up near there, and we shot and stayed on her grandmother‚Äôs property on the lake. I don‚Äôt usually pitch it as an anthology film. I talk about it being more like different portraits of people‚Äôs lives on a lake in Michigan.

**You mentioned the director, Sierra Falconer, and her life being imbued into this project. As Director of Photography, the relationship between you and the director is crucial, but it also varies significantly depending on who you‚Äôre working with.¬†What was the relationship with Sierra like on this project?**

Sierra and I had a great partnership ‚Äì from our prep work, all the way through the shoot. It‚Äôs her film, but it‚Äôs my job to ensure we capture it and make the day. Sierra¬†reached out to me about 10 months before production, and we sat down for coffee. I loved the script from the very first time I read it.

I grew up in Alabama, and¬†we were on the lake every summer. I went to summer camp on the lake. I‚Äôve been to the lake for at least a week or two every year¬†of my life.¬†So, I was talking about my¬†own¬†memories of the lake, what it meant to me, and¬†how it feels like a place you go to, and time¬†just¬†‚Äúslips by‚Äù.¬†Then, when you return to the real world ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs been a week, a month, or a whole summer ‚Äì you‚Äôre almost surprised that everybody else‚Äôs lives have kept going.

You know, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre older too‚Äù.¬†There‚Äôs¬†something about the lake, the humidity, the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù‚Ä¶ the fog¬†in the air in the mornings, and everything else like that. It feels as though it‚Äôs timeless and the trees are almost reaching over you.

So when I started talking about my personal experience of the lake, she said, ‚ÄúI think you get it‚Äù. I also brought some photography to the meeting, and we started talking about reference images. She showed me some as well to make sure we were ‚Äúseeing‚Äù the same movie.

The other thing that was important to both of us was preparation. I¬†like shot lists. I love photo-boarding. And Sierra wanted to be able to see the movie as much as she could before we started shooting. So before we¬†started¬†officially prepping¬†*Sunfish*, we agreed on a prep schedule, and we were on the same page. Throughout the process, it was a great partnership. We were constantly building on each other‚Äôs ideas.

**That‚Äôs the dream! Given that you both put a lot of emphasis on the pre-planning, did you shoot this with pretty minimal coverage? Is the film as we see it essentially as it was storyboarded?**

We were pretty well-planned. The movie you see for the most part is what we had in mind before shooting. The only real exceptions were things we couldn‚Äôt plan for, like wildlife. There was a lot of work with loons ‚Äì not ducks, I learned that quickly when I called them ducks‚Ä¶ These baby loons, we would see what they did when they got into the water and we had to be improvisational.

Sierra¬†made small changes to the script so that the actions of the loons were still pointing to what was going on with her characters. For example, there‚Äôs a line in the first chapter,¬†*Sunfish*, where the grandmother talks about the baby loon not being on the mother‚Äôs back, which is something wild loons do ‚Äì the babies will ride on the backs of the mother. But when we were shooting, there was something about the temperature, and because of this, the loons weren‚Äôt going to ride on their mother‚Äôs back.

Because we never got this footage, the script was changed so that instead of Lou identifying a mother and the baby connecting in a way she was lacking, she pointed to the fact that that mother was neglectful of her baby loon, which says a lot about her character in a different way.

In that way, we had to be improvisational. Also, anytime we were shooting boat scenes, I learned how challenging boat-to-boat work is. It was almost documentary-style watching Lou learn to sail.

But overall, I wouldn‚Äôt say we were minimal with coverage because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äì it was just¬†the way¬†we planned it. We wanted to see people in spaces. We wanted to see big windows and see light coming through. We wanted to know what it felt like with a little family at the kitchen counter or¬†the kitchen¬†table.

I‚Äôd say¬†about 80% of what you see in the movie is what we planned.¬†¬†

**You mentioned shooting on boats in the ‚ÄúSunfish‚Äù chapter. What were some of those challenges and what creative solutions did you have to come up with?**

Whenever¬†I can‚Äôt control all the variables in a situation, I ask for more time. With the ‚ÄúSunfish‚Äù sailing sequences, we had a whole half-day for each outfit. She sails twice ‚Äì the first time she goes out when she‚Äôs not very good at it. And then the second time when she‚Äôs a much better sailor. So I asked for a lot more time.

I can tell the AD (Assistant Director) how much time I need. I can talk with my team ‚Äì the gaffer, the key grip ‚Äì and see how much time they need to get everything set. Time is your best friend when you‚Äôre shooting a film; whenever you can‚Äôt control every variable, it‚Äôs even more critical.

We also changed lenses for that sequence. I shot almost the whole movie on¬†[Masterbuilt](https://www.masterbuiltlenses.com/)¬†Soft Flares¬†Prime Lenses, but for that sequence, we used¬†[Anginieux](https://www.angenieux.com/)¬†25-250 HR Zoom Lenses, so I could quickly reframe to adjust our distance to Lou. I also learned that for productions of our size, the boat driver becomes a sort of camera operator.

[**Grant Ellison**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm13803720/)¬†(director Sierra Falconer‚Äôs husband and producer on the film) was driving that boat, so I was constantly barking, ‚ÄúGo left,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBack up, back up!‚Äù It was a two-person job ‚Äì I was operating the camera while Grant was operating the boat

We would also go into those sequences knowing a few shots we needed to tell the story, but everything else is extra, right? We weren‚Äôt sure exactly what we‚Äôd get, but if we got something approximating these 3-5 shots that were expressionistic and told the story,¬†everything else was a bonus.

**You mentioned from your own experience on the lake, this sense of time feeling like it should be standing still. And I‚Äôve heard Sierra speak about creating nostalgia for a place most folks have never been to.¬†How do you go about showing these concepts of ‚Äútime‚Äù and ‚Äúnostalgia‚Äù through the visual language of the film?**

From the very beginning, we wanted the film to feel like a memory, like someone telling a story of a time from the lake. Nothing in the film should point to a particular decade or period ‚Äì we wanted it to exist almost outside of time, and that‚Äôs how we designed the look.

Everything from the costumes to the props, everything. No one pulls out an iPhone or anything that would point to a specific time. During prep, Sierra brought a bunch of family photos. They were all tactile ‚Äì real family photos in a shoe box, and we spread them out over the table. She wanted the film to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like these photos. They‚Äôre mostly from the 90s and they‚Äôre a little bit sunfaded, and they‚Äôre beautiful. There‚Äôs nothing professional about them. It looks like someone had just walked by at the lake. A lot of them were taken at the lakehouse, which was cool because you don‚Äôt often get reference images in the place where you‚Äôre sitting when you‚Äôre prepping a movie.

So, in addition to the photographers we‚Äôd already looked at, I knew she wanted the movie to look and feel like these photographs. We were constantly referencing them when we were designing the look of the film, and we even took photos of them for the¬†colourist¬†to show the sort of ‚Äúfaded‚Äù look we wanted.

We also tested lenses some lenses. I love vintage lenses, but one of the issues I have with old glass is, occasionally, it‚Äôll go down on you. Something will happen. The iris ring will stop working. And we were a day‚Äôs drive from the nearest camera house. So I needed robust lenses that wouldn‚Äôt go down on me and would last the whole 18-day shoot, but that also gave us that look we wanted.

We settled on the Masterbuilt Soft Flares because they‚Äôre sharp in the middle, but the way they fall off, they‚Äôve got a bit of that like ‚ÄúPetzval swirl‚Äù around them. You can see it most clearly when¬†I‚Äôm shooting¬†the leaves ‚Äì you can watch little sparkles in the trees. It felt slightly older ‚Äì not super modern ‚Äì but it still felt clean.

That‚Äôs sort of what we were going for the whole time. What feels most like a memory? What feels like you‚Äôre listening to someone tell a story about the lake? That was our photographic North Star.

**Because this film has these different chapters, how did you determine whether to make each more distinct or more cohesive, as a whole? How did you ultimately choose to approach this visual language from chapter to chapter?**

That was a big conversation we had early on. Do we want to adapt the style and the look of each chapter when we hand it off to a different protagonist? Do we¬†want¬†the look of the film to change? What we ultimately decided was that while they are¬†different¬†chapters, they‚Äôre all part of one movie,¬†one story, and one place. So we don‚Äôt vary the look much at all from story to story the same. I used the same LUT in the camera throughout the whole movie.

What you do notice are some stylistic changes that take place. They had more to do with production challenges or the way we were telling that story. For example, ‚ÄúSunfish‚Äù has its¬†own¬†look because it‚Äôs all static, which we wanted. We wanted those wide frames. But then when we‚Äôre on the boat, it‚Äôs kinetic. And that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs crazy shooting boat to boat.

Resident Bird has more handheld in it because we shot a bunch of cooking sequences. That‚Äôs the way the two characters relate to each other. The older sister was going to culinary school, and we quickly realized we would shoot very slowly if we set up a tripod every time we wanted to show an egg cracking. So we ended up shooting a lot of that sequence handheld.¬†In that way, they developed a¬†unique¬†language¬†a¬†little¬†bit.¬†For the most part, though, stylistically, we just wanted it to feel like the same story ‚Äì like¬†Green Lake has a look and a feel all its own.

**It‚Äôs the place that‚Äôs the connective tissue more than anything else.¬†You mentioned that you brought photos forward to Sierra. Are you a ShotDeck guy? Do you go back and watch films? Do you lean into photography as a medium? Where do you ultimately find your inspiration?**

I‚Äôm drawn to rural, Southern stories. I love¬†[**Jeff Nichols**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2158772/)‚Äò work. I¬†was pitching¬†shotgun stories to her early on ‚Äì the stark photography, watching people in spaces. A photographer I brought to the meeting was¬†[**Tema Stauffer**](https://temastauffer.com/southern-fiction/). She has a collection called ‚ÄúSouthern Fiction‚Äù. She drove around the South taking all these photos. She went to¬†**William Faulkner**‚Äòs old home and captured these beautiful landscapes and little portraits¬†into¬†people‚Äôs lives.¬†Just¬†this stunning light coming through on a kitchen table¬†that I loved.

Before I‚Äôd even seen pictures of the lake house, I brought those and she started showing me¬†pictures¬†of the real lake house, and there were a lot of similarities. That was¬†really¬†cool. Sierra also¬†brought¬†a photographer,¬†[**Nathan Pearce**](https://www.nathanpearcephoto.com/)¬†who has a collection of portraits. They‚Äôre black and white, so it wasn‚Äôt a direct photographic reference, but they‚Äôre staring into the lens. It felt like someone called their name and they looked over, no matter what was going on, dirt on their face, no matter what was going on. It‚Äôs even called¬†[‚ÄúMidwest Dirt‚Äù](https://www.nathanpearcephoto.com/midwestdirt).

So we started talking about how important faces were to this, and that‚Äôs actually how we settled on the camera too. I love¬†the way that¬†faces feel on the large format sensors, so we chose the¬†[Alexa Mini LF](https://www.arri.com/en/camera-systems/cameras/alexa-mini-lf). The film is so much about portraiture. It‚Äôs about being in people‚Äôs faces and capturing a moment in their lives when something critical is happening

We¬†did¬†also put together a deck. I always bring ideas to the first meeting, but I don‚Äôt ever want to grab the vision and drive it too early. Usually, I just¬†let them know¬†about certain things in the script, what they brought to mind for me, and how they are reminiscent of certain things.¬†I rarely put together¬†too significant of¬†a presentation.

Sierra also gave me a slew of movies to watch. I‚Äôd already seen about half of them, but we watched a bunch together. Sometimes, we were watching them together in person, but a lot of times we‚Äôd watch them and then we‚Äôd hop on Zoom and chat about them.

**What were some of those movies?**

A few stand out. There‚Äôs a movie called¬†[*A Love Song*](https://letterboxd.com/film/a-love-song/)¬†with¬†[**Dale Dickey**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0225460/)¬†and¬†[**Wes Studi.**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0836071/)¬†That was one. Another was¬†[*The Killing of Two Lovers*](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-killing-of-two-lovers/)¬†*(note: the director of¬†The Killing of Two Lovers,*¬†[***Robert Machoian***](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3272029/)*,*¬†has also written¬†*Omaha,*¬†which will be playing at this year‚Äôs festival\*)\*

Then there was an anthology film that Sierra loved. It‚Äôs not a photographic reference, but it was to show me how she wanted to structure the story called¬†[*Personal Velocity*](https://letterboxd.com/film/personal-velocity/). It‚Äôs three portraits of different women and we‚Äôre dropped into their lives.

There was also a¬†[**C√©line Sciamma**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1780037)¬†film,¬†[*Petite Maman*](https://letterboxd.com/film/petite-maman/)*.*¬†That was another photographic reference. The sun coming through the trees was very central to that. And the way it felt ‚Äì there‚Äôs a magical realism to it as she goes through the forest. We wanted the movie to have that sense of magical realism.

**If you could work with any director, who would it be?**

I‚Äôve always been blown away by¬†[**Paul Thomas Anderson**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000759)‚Äòs work. The performances that he gets. The mise en scene ‚Äì everything he puts in front of the camera. I‚Äôd probably go with PTA.

**What is a film that you look at and think, ‚ÄúI could only dream of shooting this‚Äù?**

There‚Äôs so much.¬†I feel like¬†I need to send you a list.¬†But maybe we‚Äôll stick with PTA and go with¬†[*The Master*](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-master).

[**Mihai \[MƒÉlaimare Jr\]**¬†](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1893246)is a friend of mine. I‚Äôve loved his work forever, and I had the opportunity to work with him during the¬†[*Distant Vision*](https://letterboxd.com/film/distant-vision/)¬†project a few years ago. He is¬†one of the people who showed me what larger formats, like 65-millimeter film can do for portraits. The way that you can get the camera closer to someone and fill the frame. You feel the closeness to the face.

**Since you‚Äôll be at Sundance, are there any films you hope to catch while in Park City?**

I took the ASC Masterclass a few years ago and¬†[**Paul Meyers**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9910447/)¬†was one of my guest instructors, and we‚Äôve been in contact. He shot¬†*Omaha,*¬†so I‚Äôm stoked to see his work. I‚Äôm excited to see¬†[*April*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/67531c96707ccd6b2d08815e)*,*¬†and I also have tickets from¬†*Atropia*.

Honestly, there are several that I‚Äôm excited to see. There‚Äôs¬†[*Rabbit Trap*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/67532dc1707ccd291508a284), one of the Midnight showings with¬†[**Dev Patel**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2353862).

Ideally I'd have an all-in-one grinder and I'm trying to figure out the burrs. I like the sound of the SSP Cast but don't want to risk investing in the V2 because of the very mixed reviews about its espresso performance.

Has anyone tried the V3 for pourover? Is it actually muddy, or satisfactory but less clarity than the V2? I think I'd be okay with a balanced clarity, that is what I enjoy about the Ode, but I would appreciate a bump up in clarity. For reference, I do not enjoy ultra clarity on the day to day. I do have a ZP6 that I like using a couple times per week to get different experiences out of my beans.

There is the option to keep both grinders, but my counterspace is limited and it's not ideal. Thanks in advance, fellow nerds.

I'll try to keep this as brief as possible.

I (40F) have been dating a man (42M) for a couple of years now. We have had our ups and downs. At this point - I've asked him to make a decision about whether he wants to marry me or not. He says the financial piece is what holds him back - he thinks we are not on the same page with everything.

So - I'll list the pros and cons (and my fears) - and hopefully I'll get some sage wisdom from folks on here:

Pros:

1. If I need him for an appt he'll try and re-arrange his schedule (I went through fertility treatments and he was there to pick me up at the end).
2. He was willing to do 50% of the cost of the fertilization of the eggs (I already sunk $27k into the procedures. I would have to split another $14k with him).
3. He does nice things for my bday. He bought me a pair of running shoes.
4. For valentine's day he paid for half of a used laptop
5. He rented a condo in Mexico so that everyone (including his family) could go down whenever (he rented it for 6 months to capture some of my time off)
6. He does listen to my issues and provides sage advice
7. He spends the majority of his time with me (we typically will watch his football games or play golf - which he also enjoys).
8. He is handsome
9. He is smart and has interesting taste
10. He has $200k in the bank in liquid cash
11. He did attend couples counseling with me regarding some issues we were having early on in our rs

Cons:

1. He has major anger issues. He has admitted to this. Says he needs to change it. Says he's been stressed since his dog died, break up of a rs from a few years ago, parent's divorcing etc. His father is insane (like mom divorced him after 39 years - said she was being verbally and emotionally abused every day. Said she was shaking a lot bc of the father's anger. She divorced him after finding out he was cheating on her for like 15 years).
2. He doesn't really enjoy buying anything. He says he gets anxiety making purchases that aren't what he likes or wants. So - his dog has no toys except the ones I have purchased. He tries to go without a proper blanket or bed sheets
3. He is messy and dirty (like both of his parents = they live kinda like hoarders)
4. He doesn't plan dates or outings for us. He expects me to plan them or we stay at home and watch football
5. He likes watching racist and misogynistic shows like Gavin McInnes Get Off My Lawn etc. I am a minority and it's usually saying pretty awful things. He says the guy is just a comedian and that anyone who gets offended by him is just dumb.
6. He rates girls on television for attractiveness while I'm sitting there with him
7. He has no house, no car. He owns 1/5 a house with his relatives, 1/3 a boat with some friends.
8. He isn't planning for our future. No talk about rings. No talk about marriage. No talk about our lives together.
9. He actually wants to buy a place in Mexico and live there part time (I can't do that with my work).
10. He keeps telling me any woman over the age of 35 is desperate and scrambling to hold onto anyone (I am 40).
11. He says he wants a 50/50 relationship until marriage.
12. He said he was worried about my financial stability when I took 6 months (paid from my workplace) to mourn the sudden death of my father. I obviously only took that time because it was provided for me and my job was secure. I went back to work and I am working full time.
13. I am expected to drive him when he needs to see his mom etc.
14. I was until very recently expected to commute 3 hrs a day to drive him to see me and stay with me at my condo
15. He wants to move in together before marriage - I said no - I said I want a ring first before we do anything like that.
16. He gets angry at me for telling him that I was upset over something. He keeps saying that all I do is cause drama (but he really does do things that are very unkind).
17. He did plan our trip and paid for my flight down the first time - but that's because I had no money to do anything. He doesn't want to pay for me at all. He does pay for the condo - but that's because he goes there on his own. He will happily take trips without me if I cannot afford to pay for them.
18. He often says he'll change and do better to be romantic with me. But he never does.
19. He knows I am in debt like $26k but wants 50/50 as much as possible. It's to the point where I shake if he buys me a coffee bc I know he is calculating how many times he bought a coffee for me. 
20. He will only pay for dinners he wants - if I want sushi then he says I better pay 50%. There are MANY nights where I will starve so he can eat pizza or whatever he likes. 
21. He says I owe him for our first few dates and that I need to 'pay up' to even the score. 

All in all - I am scared I am too old to find anything better.

I am employed, have a secure job, have a secure pension, I own my own condo, I own my own car, I have a side gig as a commercial model. I am known as a kind and loving person. I am thoughtful to his mom who is sick etc. I take care of his dog (buy food, toys, cook food for dog etc). He 

I do everything I can.

All his friends say I am a great catch.

So I‚Äôve been on the lookout for a nice gourmand winter scent that is coffee forward. I‚Äôve narrowed it based on other reviews and budget to Coffee Addict by Theodoros Kalotinis or Turmeric Latte by LUSH. 

I have not tried Coffee Addict yet but from people‚Äôs reviews online and on Reddit, it‚Äôs pretty accurate to a fresh cup of coffee, it‚Äôs fairly long lasting, and has moderate to good projection(plus it‚Äôs moderately priced at $55 for 50 ml). I tried Turmeric Latte in-store and I really liked it because it smells just like a spiced chai latte, but it‚Äôs pretty pricey ($65 for 30ml, or $130 for 100ml). 

Any opinions on which I should go for? Has anyone tried both? Right now the LUSH one is still available at my local mall, but I know it‚Äôs a seasonal scent and it won‚Äôt be there for long. ",2,1737495929.0,fragrance,1,1.0,False
1i6u99o,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1i6u99o/filter_basket_flow_rates/,Filter basket flow rates,"Recently I found that the recommendation that Moccamasters like a coarser grind had me looking in the wrong place - coupled with an Ode 2 which wasn't correctly zeroed-in. I found my preferred grind setting was around 6 with my KBG select brewing 750ml on the full carafe setting - this has the automatic drip-stop.

A couple of days ago I got a KBT as I wanted a thermal carafe and the manual drip-stop. I used the same grind setting as on my KBG and the coffee was awful. After a couple of batches I found that a grind setting of 8 tasted much better.

I wondered if this could have been due to different flow rates out of the filter basket, so I did some testing.

I tested by filling the filter baskets with water, about 550ml, and timed how long it took them to drain. I didn't add any filter paper of coffee. For the auto drip stop basket I had it installed on the brewer with the carafe in place so the stopper was opened the correct amount.

I also had access to and older manual drip-stop basket at my workplace, so I measured that as well.

Here are the results.

|Filter basket type|Time to taken to fully drain \~550ml of water|
|:-|:-|
|**Auto drip stop basket from KBG**|25 seconds|
|**New manual basket from KBT**||
|Half carafe setting|55 seconds|
|Full carafe setting|40 seconds|
|**Older manual basket**||
|Half carafe setting|80 seconds|
|Full carafe setting|44 seconds|

I was surprised to see such a big variation. The auto drip-stop basket on my KBT drained very quickly and water went everywhere as it overloaded the carafe - just as happens when I try to do a manual bloom.

The full carafe setting on the manual basket (from my new KBT) was considerably slower (40 seconds vs. 25), which probably explains why I need to grind so much coarser for that.

I was also surprised to see such a big difference in the half-carafe setting of the two manual drip-stop baskets (55 and 80 seconds).

I was honestly quite surprised to see so much variability. It would also be interesting to compare the flow rate of different machines with the auto-drip stop as there seem to be quite a few variables which would affect how far the drip-stop arm is depressed and how much the stopper is opened; height of the carafe, height of the main body, thickness of the hotplate + gasket, position of the filter basket bracket on the screws...

I don't think this detracts from the Moccamaster's quality, but I would say it shows that you need to find the setting which work for your particular machine.",3,1737495913.0,Moccamaster,1,1.0,False

[*SUNFISH (& Other Stories on Green Lake)*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/67531ef268b8b7d56dfe338e)¬†is one of many films making its premiere at the 2025 Sundance Film Festival. The initial buzz around the movie may feel subdued when placed directly next to films like¬†[*Atropia*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/6753268268b8b78fabfe3efb)*,*¬†[*Jimpa*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/67531ffe707ccdb18d0888c3)*,*¬†[*If I Had Legs I‚Äôd Kick You*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/67531e0d707ccd55f3088423)*,*¬†[*The Thing with Feathers*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/67532523707ccdd157088fb0),¬†[*Opus*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/67532daf707ccd2b7608a24e), and¬†[*Omaha*](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/675322a468b8b799a0fe3800)*.*¬†Still,¬†*Sunfish*¬†has slowly inserted itself into the conversation as one of the ‚Äúmust-watch‚Äù films of the festival. As if to put an exclamation point on this sneaky revelation, it was announced earlier this week that¬†[**Joanna Hogg**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0389712/)¬†(*The Souvenir, The Eternal Daughter*) has hopped on board as executive producer, praising the film for its¬†[‚Äúsensitive characterization and beautiful storytelling‚Äù](https://variety.com/2025/film/news/director-sierra-falconer-sunfish-signs-wme-sundance-1236276151/), which left her feeling ‚Äúknocked out‚Äù. Having such a respected name in the industry tied to the film prior to its premiere underscores its potential.

The film itself is described as a¬†[‚Äúperceptive debut‚Äù](https://festival.sundance.org/program/film/67531ef268b8b7d56dfe338e)¬†centered on a singular place ([Green Lake, Michigan](https://www.lake-link.com/michigan-lakes/grand-traverse-county/green-lake/22384/)), but told through several different stories ‚Äì a girl learning to sail, a boy fighting for first chair, two sisters operating a bed-and-breakfast, and a fisherman after the catch of his life. What ties these stories together is the memory of Green Lake. The water, the hammock by the lake, and the light spilling in through the kitchen window. In tandem with director¬†[**Sierra Falconer**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30uWQlXvZ7E), this feeling of ‚Äúmemory‚Äù and ‚Äúnostalgia‚Äù is crafted by cinematographer¬†[**Marcus Patterson**](https://www.marcuspatterson.com/about).

It was a pleasure talking with him, as he shared more about Falconer‚Äôs vision for this film (rooted in her own experiences on the lake). We chatted about the photographs that inspired the film‚Äôs visual language, the challenges of shooting on location, and some of the most influential films and filmmakers in Patterson‚Äôs life and work.

\---

**Adam Manery: When folks ask you to describe**¬†***Sunfish (& Other Stories on Green Lake*****), what do you tell them?**

**Marcus Patterson:**¬†I tend to tell people it‚Äôs a portrait of several different lives around this real place in Green Lake, Michigan. Our director¬†grew up near there, and we shot and stayed on her grandmother‚Äôs property on the lake. I don‚Äôt usually pitch it as an anthology film. I talk about it being more like different portraits of people‚Äôs lives on a lake in Michigan.

**You mentioned the director, Sierra Falconer, and her life being imbued into this project. As Director of Photography, the relationship between you and the director is crucial, but it also varies significantly depending on who you‚Äôre working with.¬†What was the relationship with Sierra like on this project?**

Sierra and I had a great partnership ‚Äì from our prep work, all the way through the shoot. It‚Äôs her film, but it‚Äôs my job to ensure we capture it and make the day. Sierra¬†reached out to me about 10 months before production, and we sat down for coffee. I loved the script from the very first time I read it.

I grew up in Alabama, and¬†we were on the lake every summer. I went to summer camp on the lake. I‚Äôve been to the lake for at least a week or two every year¬†of my life.¬†So, I was talking about my¬†own¬†memories of the lake, what it meant to me, and¬†how it feels like a place you go to, and time¬†just¬†‚Äúslips by‚Äù.¬†Then, when you return to the real world ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs been a week, a month, or a whole summer ‚Äì you‚Äôre almost surprised that everybody else‚Äôs lives have kept going.

You know, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre older too‚Äù.¬†There‚Äôs¬†something about the lake, the humidity, the ‚Äúmagic‚Äù‚Ä¶ the fog¬†in the air in the mornings, and everything else like that. It feels as though it‚Äôs timeless and the trees are almost reaching over you.

So when I started talking about my personal experience of the lake, she said, ‚ÄúI think you get it‚Äù. I also brought some photography to the meeting, and we started talking about reference images. She showed me some as well to make sure we were ‚Äúseeing‚Äù the same movie.

The other thing that was important to both of us was preparation. I¬†like shot lists. I love photo-boarding. And Sierra wanted to be able to see the movie as much as she could before we started shooting. So before we¬†started¬†officially prepping¬†*Sunfish*, we agreed on a prep schedule, and we were on the same page. Throughout the process, it was a great partnership. We were constantly building on each other‚Äôs ideas.

**That‚Äôs the dream! Given that you both put a lot of emphasis on the pre-planning, did you shoot this with pretty minimal coverage? Is the film as we see it essentially as it was storyboarded?**

We were pretty well-planned. The movie you see for the most part is what we had in mind before shooting. The only real exceptions were things we couldn‚Äôt plan for, like wildlife. There was a lot of work with loons ‚Äì not ducks, I learned that quickly when I called them ducks‚Ä¶ These baby loons, we would see what they did when they got into the water and we had to be improvisational.

Sierra¬†made small changes to the script so that the actions of the loons were still pointing to what was going on with her characters. For example, there‚Äôs a line in the first chapter,¬†*Sunfish*, where the grandmother talks about the baby loon not being on the mother‚Äôs back, which is something wild loons do ‚Äì the babies will ride on the backs of the mother. But when we were shooting, there was something about the temperature, and because of this, the loons weren‚Äôt going to ride on their mother‚Äôs back.

Because we never got this footage, the script was changed so that instead of Lou identifying a mother and the baby connecting in a way she was lacking, she pointed to the fact that that mother was neglectful of her baby loon, which says a lot about her character in a different way.

In that way, we had to be improvisational. Also, anytime we were shooting boat scenes, I learned how challenging boat-to-boat work is. It was almost documentary-style watching Lou learn to sail.

But overall, I wouldn‚Äôt say we were minimal with coverage because it wasn‚Äôt ‚Äì it was just¬†the way¬†we planned it. We wanted to see people in spaces. We wanted to see big windows and see light coming through. We wanted to know what it felt like with a little family at the kitchen counter or¬†the kitchen¬†table.

I‚Äôd say¬†about 80% of what you see in the movie is what we planned.¬†¬†

**You mentioned shooting on boats in the ‚ÄúSunfish‚Äù chapter. What were some of those challenges and what creative solutions did you have to come up with?**

Whenever¬†I can‚Äôt control all the variables in a situation, I ask for more time. With the ‚ÄúSunfish‚Äù sailing sequences, we had a whole half-day for each outfit. She sails twice ‚Äì the first time she goes out when she‚Äôs not very good at it. And then the second time when she‚Äôs a much better sailor. So I asked for a lot more time.

I can tell the AD (Assistant Director) how much time I need. I can talk with my team ‚Äì the gaffer, the key grip ‚Äì and see how much time they need to get everything set. Time is your best friend when you‚Äôre shooting a film; whenever you can‚Äôt control every variable, it‚Äôs even more critical.

We also changed lenses for that sequence. I shot almost the whole movie on¬†[Masterbuilt](https://www.masterbuiltlenses.com/)¬†Soft Flares¬†Prime Lenses, but for that sequence, we used¬†[Anginieux](https://www.angenieux.com/)¬†25-250 HR Zoom Lenses, so I could quickly reframe to adjust our distance to Lou. I also learned that for productions of our size, the boat driver becomes a sort of camera operator.

[**Grant Ellison**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm13803720/)¬†(director Sierra Falconer‚Äôs husband and producer on the film) was driving that boat, so I was constantly barking, ‚ÄúGo left,‚Äù or ‚ÄúBack up, back up!‚Äù It was a two-person job ‚Äì I was operating the camera while Grant was operating the boat

We would also go into those sequences knowing a few shots we needed to tell the story, but everything else is extra, right? We weren‚Äôt sure exactly what we‚Äôd get, but if we got something approximating these 3-5 shots that were expressionistic and told the story,¬†everything else was a bonus.

**You mentioned from your own experience on the lake, this sense of time feeling like it should be standing still. And I‚Äôve heard Sierra speak about creating nostalgia for a place most folks have never been to.¬†How do you go about showing these concepts of ‚Äútime‚Äù and ‚Äúnostalgia‚Äù through the visual language of the film?**

From the very beginning, we wanted the film to feel like a memory, like someone telling a story of a time from the lake. Nothing in the film should point to a particular decade or period ‚Äì we wanted it to exist almost outside of time, and that‚Äôs how we designed the look.

Everything from the costumes to the props, everything. No one pulls out an iPhone or anything that would point to a specific time. During prep, Sierra brought a bunch of family photos. They were all tactile ‚Äì real family photos in a shoe box, and we spread them out over the table. She wanted the film to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like these photos. They‚Äôre mostly from the 90s and they‚Äôre a little bit sunfaded, and they‚Äôre beautiful. There‚Äôs nothing professional about them. It looks like someone had just walked by at the lake. A lot of them were taken at the lakehouse, which was cool because you don‚Äôt often get reference images in the place where you‚Äôre sitting when you‚Äôre prepping a movie.

So, in addition to the photographers we‚Äôd already looked at, I knew she wanted the movie to look and feel like these photographs. We were constantly referencing them when we were designing the look of the film, and we even took photos of them for the¬†colourist¬†to show the sort of ‚Äúfaded‚Äù look we wanted.

We also tested lenses some lenses. I love vintage lenses, but one of the issues I have with old glass is, occasionally, it‚Äôll go down on you. Something will happen. The iris ring will stop working. And we were a day‚Äôs drive from the nearest camera house. So I needed robust lenses that wouldn‚Äôt go down on me and would last the whole 18-day shoot, but that also gave us that look we wanted.

We settled on the Masterbuilt Soft Flares because they‚Äôre sharp in the middle, but the way they fall off, they‚Äôve got a bit of that like ‚ÄúPetzval swirl‚Äù around them. You can see it most clearly when¬†I‚Äôm shooting¬†the leaves ‚Äì you can watch little sparkles in the trees. It felt slightly older ‚Äì not super modern ‚Äì but it still felt clean.

That‚Äôs sort of what we were going for the whole time. What feels most like a memory? What feels like you‚Äôre listening to someone tell a story about the lake? That was our photographic North Star.

**Because this film has these different chapters, how did you determine whether to make each more distinct or more cohesive, as a whole? How did you ultimately choose to approach this visual language from chapter to chapter?**

That was a big conversation we had early on. Do we want to adapt the style and the look of each chapter when we hand it off to a different protagonist? Do we¬†want¬†the look of the film to change? What we ultimately decided was that while they are¬†different¬†chapters, they‚Äôre all part of one movie,¬†one story, and one place. So we don‚Äôt vary the look much at all from story to story the same. I used the same LUT in the camera throughout the whole movie.

What you do notice are some stylistic changes that take place. They had more to do with production challenges or the way we were telling that story. For example, ‚ÄúSunfish‚Äù has its¬†own¬†look because it‚Äôs all static, which we wanted. We wanted those wide frames. But then when we‚Äôre on the boat, it‚Äôs kinetic. And that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs crazy shooting boat to boat.

Resident Bird has more handheld in it because we shot a bunch of cooking sequences. That‚Äôs the way the two characters relate to each other. The older sister was going to culinary school, and we quickly realized we would shoot very slowly if we set up a tripod every time we wanted to show an egg cracking. So we ended up shooting a lot of that sequence handheld.¬†In that way, they developed a¬†unique¬†language¬†a¬†little¬†bit.¬†For the most part, though, stylistically, we just wanted it to feel like the same story ‚Äì like¬†Green Lake has a look and a feel all its own.

**It‚Äôs the place that‚Äôs the connective tissue more than anything else.¬†You mentioned that you brought photos forward to Sierra. Are you a ShotDeck guy? Do you go back and watch films? Do you lean into photography as a medium? Where do you ultimately find your inspiration?**

I‚Äôm drawn to rural, Southern stories. I love¬†[**Jeff Nichols**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2158772/)‚Äò work. I¬†was pitching¬†shotgun stories to her early on ‚Äì the stark photography, watching people in spaces. A photographer I brought to the meeting was¬†[**Tema Stauffer**](https://temastauffer.com/southern-fiction/). She has a collection called ‚ÄúSouthern Fiction‚Äù. She drove around the South taking all these photos. She went to¬†**William Faulkner**‚Äòs old home and captured these beautiful landscapes and little portraits¬†into¬†people‚Äôs lives.¬†Just¬†this stunning light coming through on a kitchen table¬†that I loved.

Before I‚Äôd even seen pictures of the lake house, I brought those and she started showing me¬†pictures¬†of the real lake house, and there were a lot of similarities. That was¬†really¬†cool. Sierra also¬†brought¬†a photographer,¬†[**Nathan Pearce**](https://www.nathanpearcephoto.com/)¬†who has a collection of portraits. They‚Äôre black and white, so it wasn‚Äôt a direct photographic reference, but they‚Äôre staring into the lens. It felt like someone called their name and they looked over, no matter what was going on, dirt on their face, no matter what was going on. It‚Äôs even called¬†[‚ÄúMidwest Dirt‚Äù](https://www.nathanpearcephoto.com/midwestdirt).

So we started talking about how important faces were to this, and that‚Äôs actually how we settled on the camera too. I love¬†the way that¬†faces feel on the large format sensors, so we chose the¬†[Alexa Mini LF](https://www.arri.com/en/camera-systems/cameras/alexa-mini-lf). The film is so much about portraiture. It‚Äôs about being in people‚Äôs faces and capturing a moment in their lives when something critical is happening

We¬†did¬†also put together a deck. I always bring ideas to the first meeting, but I don‚Äôt ever want to grab the vision and drive it too early. Usually, I just¬†let them know¬†about certain things in the script, what they brought to mind for me, and how they are reminiscent of certain things.¬†I rarely put together¬†too significant of¬†a presentation.

Sierra also gave me a slew of movies to watch. I‚Äôd already seen about half of them, but we watched a bunch together. Sometimes, we were watching them together in person, but a lot of times we‚Äôd watch them and then we‚Äôd hop on Zoom and chat about them.

**What were some of those movies?**

A few stand out. There‚Äôs a movie called¬†[*A Love Song*](https://letterboxd.com/film/a-love-song/)¬†with¬†[**Dale Dickey**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0225460/)¬†and¬†[**Wes Studi.**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0836071/)¬†That was one. Another was¬†[*The Killing of Two Lovers*](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-killing-of-two-lovers/)¬†*(note: the director of¬†The Killing of Two Lovers,*¬†[***Robert Machoian***](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3272029/)*,*¬†has also written¬†*Omaha,*¬†which will be playing at this year‚Äôs festival\*)\*

Then there was an anthology film that Sierra loved. It‚Äôs not a photographic reference, but it was to show me how she wanted to structure the story called¬†[*Personal Velocity*](https://letterboxd.com/film/personal-velocity/). It‚Äôs three portraits of different women and we‚Äôre dropped into their lives.

There was also a¬†[**C√©line Sciamma**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1780037)¬†film,¬†[*Petite Maman*](https://letterboxd.com/film/petite-maman/)*.*¬†That was another photographic reference. The sun coming through the trees was very central to that. And the way it felt ‚Äì there‚Äôs a magical realism to it as she goes through the forest. We wanted the movie to have that sense of magical realism.

**If you could work with any director, who would it be?**

I‚Äôve always been blown away by¬†[**Paul Thomas Anderson**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000759)‚Äòs work. The performances that he gets. The mise en scene ‚Äì everything he puts in front of the camera. I‚Äôd probably go with PTA.

**What is a film that you look at and think, ‚ÄúI could only dream of shooting this‚Äù?**

There‚Äôs so much.¬†I feel like¬†I need to send you a list.¬†But maybe we‚Äôll stick with PTA and go with¬†[*The Master*](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-master).

[**Mihai \[MƒÉlaimare Jr\]**¬†](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1893246)is a friend of mine. I‚Äôve loved his work forever, and I had the opportunity to work with him during the¬†[*Distant Vision*](https://letterboxd.com/film/distant-vision/)¬†project a few years ago. He is¬†one of the people who showed me what larger formats, like 65-millimeter film can do for portraits. The way that you can get the camera closer to someone and fill the frame. You feel the closeness to the face.

**Since you‚Äôll be at Sundance, are there any films you hope to catch while in Park City?**

I took the ASC Masterclass a few years ago and¬†[**Paul Meyers**](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9910447/)¬†was one of my guest instructors, and we‚Äôve been in contact.

Do you find yourself yearning for deeper connections with like-minded individuals? Then read on.

I'm a 34-year-old South Asian man based in Southern Africa, and I'm on a quest to build meaningful friendships with gay men aged 40 and above, anywhere in the world. While my location might be Southern Africa, I believe that true connection transcends geographical boundaries.

Why am I specifically seeking friendships with men in this age group? Because I believe there's a unique richness that comes with experience. I'm drawn to the wisdom, the perspectives, and the shared understanding that often develops over time. I value genuine conversations, shared laughter, and the kind of camaraderie that only comes from connecting with those who have navigated life's ups and downs.

Perhaps you've reached a point in your life where you're looking to expand your social circle, to connect with others who truly ""get it."" Maybe you're seeking a sounding board or simply someone to share a virtual coffee and a good laugh with.

If you're a gay man, 40 or older, and you resonate with this desire for authentic connection, I'd love to hear from you. Let's share our stories, our passions, and our perspectives on life. Let's build friendships that are both enriching and enduring.

Reach out and let's start a conversation. The world is waiting to be explored, and it's always better with good company.

Long-time lurker, first-time poster. Just wanted to share my INCREDIBLE journey to becoming an AWS deity. Here's how I did it:

Study materials:

* Watched half a TikTok about AWS
* Dreamed about Jeff Bezos once
* My pet hamster wrote some flashcards
* Osmosis (I put my laptop under my pillow)

My groundbreaking study schedule:

1. Woke up at 4:59 AM (because 5 AM is for slackers)
2. Took a 0.3-second power nap
3. Scheduled all 12 certification exams back-to-back
4. Completed them while making my morning coffee

Key tips for success:

* Don't bother with practice exams (they'll only slow you down)
* Meditate in an actual AWS data center (just sneak in, they're cool with it)
* Replace all meals with crushed up whitepapers
* Set up a shrine to Werner Vogels' beard

Total study time: -7 minutes (yes, negative, I actually gained time)

Special thanks to:

* My goldfish, who reviewed my IAM policies
* The AWS documentation I absorbed through interpretive dance
* That one AWS sticker I found on the street

Next up: Planning to invent 5 new AWS services before lunch. AMA!

So last Friday I made out with a coworker that I have had kind of a flirty vibe since we sat together at our Christmas party. I broke up with my first ever long term boyfriend of 2 years around 4-5 months ago, and did not see myself dating or doing anything in a long time after that. But this coworker was very charming and we have fun together. The only problem is I am not 100% attracted to him. It is vey much dependent on the day, I always feel very drawn to him but when I see him I wouldn‚Äôt say he is an attractive guy. This + the fact that I don‚Äôt know if I am ready to dive into anything new (whatever it would be), makes me feel I shouldn‚Äôt take it further. When we were kissing, he also asked if I wanted to follow him home, but I explained that I am relatively newly single and not ready for that. He understood and asked if this (as is us kissing) would happen again and I said maybe, but I had to think some things over. But in the last few days I have hardly seen him in the office. Before he always used to come over to my desk (it is on the way to the kitchen so everyone passes this, not as natural for me to pass by his desk) but he have not done so once in 2 days. I was going to ask today if he wanted to meet up for a coffee after work to talk but was having a really bad work day generally and was exhausted so thought it would not be a good idea. But now I am also having second thoughts, is he avoiding me? Is he regretting the kiss (we were both a little drunk) and now wants nothing to do with me? I also struggle on what to say if we do talk because one day I want to explore things with him and the next day I don‚Äôt. How can I sort all this out?

Does anyone have this machine? 

The instructions say to put it on the max froth setting for both latte and cappuccino. But other machines I've looked at ($100 range), the instructions say to use min for latte and max for cappuccino - which I assume controls whether you get steamed milk or foam. This machine only does latte and cappuccino, some of the others do americano also. This machine has a control for frothing but the directions don't really say use this setting for more steamed milk and this setting for more froth. 

I'm not looking to spend a lot of money or do anything too fancy. I was planning on use my Christmas and birthday money to buy the machine, syrups, pumps for the syrups, chocolate, decaf coffee (too much coffee upsets my stomach).

1i6u3ei,https://www.reddit.com/r/RVLiving/comments/1i6u3ei/keeping_rv_house_battery_topped_off_trickle/,Keeping RV House Battery Topped Off: Trickle Charge From Solar Jackery?,"I'm full-timing in a 32 ft. motorhome and boondocking (or dry camping) more frequently and for longer stays than expected in the past year. I feel like my house batteries are getting too low (LED overhead lights flicker when water pump runs) sooner than they used to (now starting to poop out at about 3 days after a full charge), and all the sudden, the stock, built-in, '4 dummy light' battery meter reads: 1 light left of 4 (or less than 25%). I've never ran it to dead and it's only been to 1 light maybe 5-6 times.  This is, I assume, normal or close to normal operation.  Both my house batteries are just over 1 year old.

Getting to my question, I'd love to keep the house batteries topped off (in a more passive way if possible) without running the engine or generator for 15-20 minutes which only gets me another day/half-day of life, each time (giving me about '1 or 2 dummy lights more' of batt-meter/DC conversion).  I'd prefer to not waste gas/fill the area with exhaust/disturb others... especially because I ALSO have on board for our AC needs: a NON-integrated solar generator which serves as our main AC power resource (as my wife and I work from the road), which is a Jackery Explorer 3000 with 400w of panel.

Someone suggested, to get the DC converter working and add to the house batteries, that I should just plug the RV's shore power plug in to the Jackery's 30A outlet, BUT that would drain the Jackery to zero in 2-3 hours which is a no-go because when boondocking, we rely on it for coffee-making, charging laptops and phones. Bottom line- with a sometimes non-dependable amount of sun, I worry about running down our main AC power source. Plus, to even test how good this suggestion is, I'd have to be running down the house battery multiple times to see how long the Jackery and my RV's DC converter takes to replenish the house batts and discover that sweet spot timing.

**SO- I assume a more elegant way of converting my non-integrated solar system power to house battery power COULD BE via one of these small trickle/float charger/battery maintainers from Amazon** (that shut off when batt is full) where I can conveniently just plug/unplug it from the Jackery depending on our needs/usage rate and the Jackery's varying level of charge during our trips. I'm looking at the ones with two alligators at one end and an AC plug at the other. Well, maybe not alligators as it would be nice to direct mount and leave it connected at the battery ALL the time with the AC cord tied up but accessible (ironically, we keep the Jackery near the house batts on trips).

**Our house battery setup is 2 matching 12V 65Ah lead acid batts connected in parallel** (pic attached, link to specs at bottom). Btw- upgrading to lithium based on our 2014 stock inverter/converter and our infrequency of boondocking at the time seemed not worth the investment.

**SO- Based on my current battery setup and goal, what level amperage (or other features) of a charger do I want?**  I see a range of amperage for these things- is the difference in amps simply going to charge the house battery faster or slower (1a vs. 20a), and thus be a bigger or smaller unit, or is there more at play with choice of amperage here and in matching it to my battery setup? **OR, am I altogether thinking about this solution wrong? :-)**

By the way: Stuff that's using house battery power: LED lights, we never have more than 2-3 on and not for long, only at night, there's the furnace and blower rarely running, then the fridge and hot water heater igniters only (they run-run off propane), which the igniters can't be using much electricity. Main 12v power draw is probably the water pump for toilet and sink. Not many showers while dry docking.

As the title states, how easy would it be to make friends as a queer, 31-year-old female in Lancaster?

I currently live in Charlotte, NC, I lived in Washington, DC, prior to living in the South, and I'm looking for a new spot to move to and ultimately, settle down in.

I grew up in Central PA and still have a lot of family in the area (which is part of my desire to move back); however, my friends have since moved away, and I'm not as familiar with Lancaster, so I'm curious to hear others' experiences in terms of making friends, particularly being part of the LGBTQ+ community.

1i6u1p1,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/1i6u1p1/my_hdd_is_dying/,My HDD is dying?,"For a few days now, the system has not seen my old HDD. At first, restarting the computer helped, sometimes multiple times, but it is getting worse. Today, it was visible once, but subsequent attempts to turn it on/off do not help. I had the same issue half a year ago for some time, but the problem went away on its own. In total, I have three disks - SSD and two old HDDs.

The hero of the topic is  SAMSUNG HD103SJ 1TB HDD - production date on the label 2010.  I checked SMART and it had the status ""OK"". The other drives have SMART ""OK"".

When the drive is not detected, the system takes a long time to boot - first there is no image for a few seconds, then the motherboard screen (a screen like a loading screen, when information about how to get to the BIOS appears) - several dozen. Then Windows starts normally. There is over 4GB of free space missing on the SSD system drive. When the system sees it, the free space returns.

What I did: 

* 1. I replaced the SATA cable 
* 2. I swapped the SATA cables with the second HDD (the one that works) 
* 3. I connected it with a different power cable 
* 4. I connected it to a different mobo socket, I swapped the order with the second HDD 
* 5. I checked in BIOS - it is not detected 
* 6. I disconnected the working HDD - no change 
* 7. I disconnected it - the system boots normally, but there is still over 4GB missing on the SSD

So we went out and had an amazing time. We had around 6 rounds and went for a walk after. We found out that we have alot of things in common so we started hanging out after that day. The thing is that after that night it was mostly her asking me to hang or she would always start texting me. A little thing i noticed was that when she would invite to something as a group she would always ask me first and if i couldnt do it she would just cancel it. She came over to my place 2 times and stayed late both times and we are planning on going to the cinema next week. We would also have late night texting sessions which would last up to 3 hours. Like i dont know would you ever give a guy you just met recently this much attention without having feelings for him? I want to make a move on her again but if she said no i would look like a complete jackass. We also work together in a coffee shop and she would regulary randomly show up to my shifts to hang out and help with work.,1,1737495344.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

Currently Assistant Manager at a big coffee chain but thinking of quitting (started one week ago). Only making 40p more than starting baristas, doing 40+ hour weeks with brutal early starts while trying to do my Masters. Suffice to say I might be expected to open the store on my own, work unpaid overtime, do 10 jobs at once, and the ASM part of the job is minimal, so the job doesn't match the description.

Got my LLB last year (2:1, Russell Group) but stuck on whether to keep this exhausting retail job for the management experience on my CV, or quit to focus on Masters + volunteer at legal clinics instead. Really don't want a retail career, just wondering if the ASM title is worth keeping for law firm applications?

Anyone in legal recruitment or been in similar spot? What would look better - sticking out retail management or getting actual legal experience?

Each pack had 8g almost exactly. That means at least 2.4g was Rainforest Alliance certified! 

Coffee smelled pretty stale after opening, almost like chicory coffee... didn't even see a ""best by"" date. 

Brewed using Coffee Chronicler's recipe at \~85 C, 1:16 ratio (16g coffee, \~256g water), total brew time 4:08. Result was... surprising? There was definitely persistent bitterness even at the lower brew temperature as well as a stale/oxidized taste, but also some sweetness and chocolatey, smoky, and burnt caramel flavors & aroma.

Anyone else try bringing out the best of sub-par coffees like this?

One of my asks would be an electronic organiser / iPad. My justification is I can use it side by side my laptop as a notetaker and organiser / journal. But if I feel good enough to go out and work, I can travel light and work for a coffee shop.

All things I used to hold in disdain as merely ""religious"" and without value in a ""true"" relationship with God.

As it happened, along with other things, the rock band performance worship, party atmosphere, MAGA hats and food & coffee & firearms in the sanctuary and *never* shutting up appeared more and more disrespectful and agitating. So much so that it became straight up stressful to walk into service. I could not find my God anywhere in the building.

However that‚Äôs the only kind of Christianity I‚Äôve known, ""saved"" in my mid twenties, (I‚Äôm sixty-one now) deep into charismatic, emotional stuff in the nineties, then part of a big ""relevant"" church with a verb name in later years. (I absolutely will not walk into any church that has a verb for a name) Because of this the formality of traditional services is somewhat intimidating and I've held off visiting.

Is this way of thinking typical for those coming out from deconstruction? I like Episcopal but there's none near me. I‚Äôm looking at a UCC church and I like what I've seen. My deconstructing wife says it looks boring. I‚Äôm saying we‚Äôre not going there to be entertained and we need to get out of that mindset.

Over Christmas a buddy grabbed me a few bags from a local roaster and when I ran out of my last batch of normal beans I figured I'd give them a try.  I couldn't get any of them to come out good to save my life.  Finally on this last small bag the grinder just started making clunking/clicking noises and wasn't doing much of anything.

Went through the motions of cleaning the grinder, took it all apart down to the internal wheel and such.  Cleared it out so nothing was left replaced everything and still no luck.  Reading into it further I noticed comments about people needing to replace the inner and upper burr parts.  Went to my local ECS and grabbed both pieces and replaced them just now.  On a positive, the clunking/clicking went away so thankful that its hopefully not dead!  On the flip side, The typical 16s grind time that I was using previously seems to do maybe 1/3 of the double shot basket now.  

The Inner burr is set to 6 (was preset there) and my old one was set to 6 as well.  Is it just the new grinder etc... is just doing such a different job that I need to increase the time for the grirnd?  Or should I be thinking there's another issue?!

1i6tjzd,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1i6tjzd/delonghi_primadonna_soul_bought_should_i_have/,Delonghi Primadonna Soul bought - should I have chosen differently?,"I bought a Delonghi Primadonna Soul for 830 Euro last week as our first bean to cup for replacing a Nespresso Lattissima Pro pod machine with a similar milk froth system. 

I'm still in doubt if this was the best choice... When buying new stuff, I always do a lot of online research and often get hyped about what the alternatives would offer. 

We mainly drink milk recipes (latte / latte macchiato) and I don't like a normal espresso, though I want to drink more black drinks, if I can get used to them. (I'm practicing with americano with sugar currently). 

It took us some time to play with the beans, grind, aroma etc but I think it tastes fine now on this machine. 
Milk froth comes out at 61 degrees and the drinks are hot enough, which had otherwise been a concern. 
Also, we have always found the milk system easy to maintain and happy that it doesn't cost 50 cents in milk cleaning products after every other milk drink.
We usually make 1-2 lattes in the morning and sometimes again in the afternoon. So on average 20 cups pr week. 


But I can't help but think whether we should have seriously considered e.g. the Nivona 8101/8103/8107 instead, but that would cost an additional 420 euro (1250 euro). 

As ""coffee newbies"" coming from a pod system used mainly for latte macchiato with added sugar, would we even appreciate the small improvements other models would bring? 
Specifically on which parameters would we notice a difference? Would the flavors of the coffee really be noticeably different when anyway diluted with 70% milk? 
Or would the milk froth feel or taste significantly different?
I know some machines can do hot milk and hot milk froth separately, but after swirling with a spoon, how big a difference would that be anyway...

I'm hoping for some comments guiding me in whether we should reconsider other options than the Delonghi Primadonna Soul (we can return it for another week or two though it will be a hassle) or whether we should actually be happy with our good price on the machine.
A Delonghi alternative with this week's offers could of course also be the Rivelia at 600 euro in DK. ",1,1737494166.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False

I've known her since 2012. She's a streamer (red flag I guess), but a national streamer, that streams for about 20 people max.  Growing up, I always helped my friends on their streaming careers, however small they were, I then expanded this to other national streamers that were seeking more engagement, including my Crush. I was always that guy that followed, shared the ""stream is live"" posts on my social pages as publicity, I would engage in chat and make clips and compilations for everyone (not even related to her actually).  
  
Then everyone fell off, everyone moved on with their lives, gave up the ideia that they could become streamers, but not my crush. She kept on streaming, with a shaky schedule, but always trying to improve. Since she was someone I didn't personally knew, so I assumed more of a Lurker role, engaging with chat/streamer when the time was right, so in the end, she doesn't know me all that well.

But I know her. She eventually turned out to have everything I wanted in a person, from personality, to looks, even to the games she'd play. But this is a streamer, I had absolutely no chance to even get to know her personally. So I just, ya know, forgot about all of that ideia. 

Then I got into a relationship, I would still hop in to some streams, but I had a very diferent time of engagement, some times I woulnd't even log in to twitch. I was just there to have some 2nd screen entertainment and to support with a viewer.

Once, at a Con, I was with at the time GF, when I caught a glimpse of someone in the middle of the crowd, and there she was. I didn't aproach (or my GF would kill me) so I just stared at her for a bit while we were chilling in the bench, and she was just something else. But again, I was in a relationship so I dropped any ideia. Fastforward to the end of 2023, my relationship ends and I spend a couple months for myself, not really wanting anything, when she crossed my mind. After that moment I was screwed. 

I tried to strike conversations answering Instagram stories, we talked a bit, but all very casual and she never gave the ideia of being interested in anything. She lives in the next big town, about 3 hours away by car, so there was also a big distance issue. In the meantime I was going insane, every couples post I saw I'd imagine that situation with her, things like small dates, to buying a house and building a family. I'd have full conversations with her in my head, speaking about the most random of things.

Christmas 2023 I tried a risky move and again in a Instagram Story reply, I said I ""knew what I wanted for christmas, you"" and the just replied with a ""oh damn, smooooth"" and I struck more casual conversation but it lead to nothing. I was feeling depressed at this point, I wanted this person for me because she just felt like she was the full package.

My friends were split, some said to keep chasing, others tried to ""take the shine"" out of her, saying things like ""shes the complete contrary of what she shows on stream, she probably smells bad, and burps loud"" but my dummy mind just couldnt get her out. In a struck of some luck, my friends insisted I try some dating apps, and 1 day after installing Tinder, when I had no likes, she appears. We all scream like the local team scored a goal. She was apparently near my town (the capital) and I was in range with her. Withouth hesitation, I paid for a Super Like and used it on her. Then for one entire week, I'd enter the app and I wouldnt swipe on anyone, I'd just go in, check the matches/messages. Nothing.

I was not even more depressed. This felt like it was my 1 chance. That maybe because I super like'd her, she'd finally notice that my aproach wasn't just of a friend, but more of a curious friend. I cried several nights (thats how much this woman was affecting me), had to unfollow her everyone, because I just couldn't bear see her all the time on every social media. Unfortunately I'm just a man, and I keep peaking her profile and checking her stories. 2 weeks ago, she came to the capital to the Aquarium, a very popular place for dates, and with the caption ""Making memories"". My heart sank. I felt sick and cried the rest of the day.

Even when unfollowing, she would pop up on my recommendeds, or on my FYP on tiktok. I feel uterly divided because I feel I should just be clear on my intentions or just block her and move on. My therapist says it's up to me. If I just tell her I have interest in her and invite her for a coffee, the best that can happen is she saying yes, and the worst, she blocks me. Either way, my therapist recommends me to block her if I don't make any move, because of my tendency to keep checking her.

We‚Äôve been together for 5 years, and during that time, I‚Äôve struggled with the idea of building a future together because of his unhealthy habits.

I got smoked salmon, capers, tomatoes, red onion, dill and garlic cream cheese on a sesame bagel. 

The other bagel you see is an everything bagel with hash brown, halloumi, bacon and hot honey. 

My cousin really enjoyed her bagel, which left her stuffed. She was unable to finish the bagel. 

I was able to eat all of my bagel, as it felt light on my stomach- probably due to my choice of fillings. It tasted great and very fresh. The flavours really complimented each other. 

I got an iced latte, which was okay. My cousin got a regular latte. She describes herself as a ‚Äúcoffee connoisseur‚Äù and said that their coffee was great. I was less enthusiastic about it. 

We decided to eat in. The food and drinks came quickly, which was fantastic. 

For my bagel and iced latte, it cost ¬£11.80. I genuinely can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs a steal, normal, or on the pricier side. As a young adult, who has witnessed rapid and crazy inflation, my sense (of how much things should cost) is warped. 

Overall, I would definitely go again. 

If you decide to go, research their menu beforehand. My bagel was called the ‚ÄúLox‚Äù bagel. It felt weird asking for it, but I suppose it‚Äôs easier than describing everything you want on your bagel. 

If you‚Äôve ever tried Bodega Bagels, how would you rate it? I‚Äôve heard that it‚Äôs overrated, but my cousin and I really enjoyed our experience. ",25,1737493445.0,northernireland,19,0.84,False

I (29M) have started seeing someone (28F). We live in the same state and met in person at a coffee shop. She told me she was interested in me and we started going on dates. Unfortunately, she openly told me when things started to get serious that she had to break it off because she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship after a recent break up. I was upset but being someone who is emotionally mature alongside having a high level of empathy I knew we had something really worth pursuing and also that she definitely was really into me when we were together - it was always extremely couple-ey and she was extremely affectionate in person. 

I accepted her decision and parted ways gracefully but suspected she would miss what we had and would go back on what she said - I was correct and she messaged me saying she missed me and we‚Äôve started seeing each other again and it‚Äôs gone straight back to how we were. The caveat is she told me that she still can‚Äôt progress to a relationship due to needing to process her break up. I do appreciate her honesty; however I don‚Äôt see a world where 2 people with this much chemistry can ignore that and not eventually work it out? I met her friends the other day and since then she has been even more interested (messaging a lot, asking to see me a lot, telling me her friends were all liked me a lot and were very positive about me); but we haven‚Äôt rediscussed anything as I don‚Äôt want to put pressure on her and feel it would need to be her that brings that topic up if she did feel she could progress things.

I heard from a mutual close female friend of hers that she was really into this other guy and he ended it, but she also said ‚Äúyou never know she might change her mind‚Äù.

I know on paper it sounds so stupid as she‚Äôs been clear and the writing is on the wall; but as someone who can read people well I just don‚Äôt see a world where she doesn‚Äôt see what we have and move on from it. We have everything someone could want in a relationship in physical attraction, can spend hours together and still want to make plans to do more, can go to do our groceries and make that a fun activity somehow, don‚Äôt take ourselves seriously and make each other laugh all the time. I‚Äôm just worried as if I get deeper and she breaks it off again I could end up setting myself back. Any suggestions appreciated.",1,1737493299.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I don't like the taste of it, and didn't get used to the smell of it before I started working at a hotel. So my opinion on the quality and taste of it would go no further than, ""I just put it out x minutes ago.""

  
On to the story!

  
Part of my Night Audit duties when I was at the Wampton Outdoors was to have the coffee out and ready by 5am. Cool, no problem. I would honestly have it ready by 4:15-4:30am because people would start milling around because they had early morning flights and etc. And even though I've never been a fan of the stuff, I can appreciate how for some people, that first cup makes their day start just a little bit better.

And a lot of people really liked the brand of coffee that was used. But when I was asked my opinion of it, my standard answer was, ""I'm not a coffee drinker, so I wouldn't really know."" And that was understood and acceptable to most people...except this one.

Me=Me, IB=Irritating Broad 

IB: How's the coffee?

Me: I just put it out 10 minutes ago, so it's fresh.

IB: No, I mean how does it taste

Me: I wouldn't know ma'am. I'm not a coffee drinker. Others say that it's good though.

IB (incredulously): How can you make coffee for others and not drink it yourself?

Me (wondering who did I piss off to be subjected to this conversation after ""bullshyt"" hours): I don't have to taste the coffee to make it.

IB: So how do you give an opinion when people ask?

Me (OMG): I don't, because I don't have one to give.

IB: So you're telling me that you stay up all night without ANY coffee?

Me (asshole mode activated): Drinking coffee wasn't listed as a job requirement during my interview. All I have to do is make it so people can have a cup and GO ABOUT THEIR DAY.

IB: So how am I supposed to know if it's good or not?

Me: You simply taste it and make the decision for yourself. We even provide creamers, half and half, and sugar so you can adjust as needed.

IB: You didn't have to say it like that.

Me: I just answered the question that you asked, ma'am.

IB: So you really don't have an opinion.

Me: My opinion is that there are better things for me to drink in the morning, like gin. But if others like it then that's great for them.

And before she could say another word, IB's coworker tapped her on the shoulder to let her know their ride will be there in under 10 minutes. That sweet angel saved me from being subjected to more unnecessary bullshyt!

  
That's all I got.

1i6t1ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i6t1ha/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go_now/,Should I stay or should I go now‚Ä¶,"Good people of Reddit ‚Äì 
 
This is my very first post and it‚Äôs a crazy long one covering a near 30-year marriage and its disintegration. It‚Äôs the age old novel of classic overcompensating wife and under-performing husband ‚Äì how cliche. Anyhoo, please be kind to the elder noob, who you‚Äôll soon see is obviously GenX given all the ellipses I use... 
 
Background intel ‚Äì I (52F) and my spouse, Louis (56M) have been married since our early/mid 20‚Äôs and have no children by choice. (It was never something I was interested in since my youth and Lou agreed children were not something he ever wanted.) As we hashed out the details of becoming a long-term partnership, I also shared my serious abhorrence of cheaters, stating - if you ever have a need to stray outside of this partnership, please have the respect for me to dissolve this before beginning anything with someone else. We called it the escape hatch.
 
Like many young folks, we partied and worked, worked and partied all through our 20‚Äôs and well into our 30‚Äôs. Moved to a big city, rented posh lofts, did some FAB vacations to exotic lands, built our careers‚Ä¶ We were one another‚Äôs ‚Äòride or die‚Äô during this phase, best I can recall. ;) Good, albeit often drunken times that really cemented our friendship. 
 
At some point during that period, my grandfather passed and left a tiny inheritance for me, we used that as the downpayment on a condo ¬Ω the size of our rental loft. But home ownership was something drilled into me as a next step on the path to adulthood. Lou agreed verbally but lost his mind due to the place being so tiny, but stifled his feelings like many GenX males would and never shared beyond the fact leaking out via snark. 
 
Thus begins the spiral of Lou‚Äôs contributions to the relationship‚Ä¶ years of avoiding feelings (his or mine), passive aggressive comments, neglecting our relationship in favor of personal pursuits and straight-out laziness to do anything but indulge at any and every opportunity‚Ä¶ oh and reluctantly work. This went on for about 10 years, let‚Äôs say. 
 
Like many in a classic overcompensating wife and under-performing husband situation or another pop-psychology phrase, anxious and avoidant pairings, I took to yelling to be heard, and he retreated to avoid my yelling. Yelling happens more and more, thusly avoidance got more and more. Rinse and repeat until I feel there‚Äôs nothing to be done so I can be heard and start thinking of divorce. This makes Lou feel worthless and he avoids the relationship even more. This goes on for YEARS! He ‚Äòunderstands my point‚Äô and promises to ‚Äòdo better‚Äô only to return to past behaviors and downright ignoring my emotional need for connection.
 
So, in 2018 I got to the point where I felt discernment counseling was the right option. While I‚Äôm researching that and what all is entailed, he had an old college girlfriend coming to town and wanted to meet for a coffee/drink. (Queue the groans, I know.) He did not mention anything about this to me, especially knowing she and I DO NOT get along from the one time we met over the holidays in the mid-90‚Äôs and she flexed her ‚Äòthis is my man‚Äô and ‚ÄòI am so much better than you‚Äô muscles. His response was to say ignore her; she‚Äôs just like that. She lived in NYC, so we went back to regular business once she left town post holidays. She didn‚Äôt really factor into anything until this point. 
 
They ended up having coffee together, chatting about how much they meant to one another and that they still felt love for one another. She is married with a pre-teen daughter, so this is all just dreamy would have, should have, could have‚Ä¶ Until the relationship switches to in-app messaging once she returned home. 
 
(All this is from the truth that was trickled out over ~1 week, post finding out about the affair)They chatted daily, incessantly, thinking about how they might meet up when she travels for work, how they both wished things could be different, how Lou felt bad didn‚Äôt support me when I terminated a pregnancy in our first year of marriage‚Ä¶ (That last one? Yeah, aside from now the good people of Reddit, was only known by 2 people for 20 years, Lou being one. OBVS a private situation.) At some point during all this, the cooze says ‚Äì I love my husband and don‚Äôt want to rock the boat there for my daughter‚Äôs sake, I need to step back from all this messaging. Only to message him again 2 days after this with ‚Äì LOL I can‚Äôt seem to stay away from you.
 
I don‚Äôt want to delve further into this emotional affair, except to say that everything one can do wrong when an affair is found out, Lou did. Trickle truthed, deny it was an affair because they didn‚Äôt f*ck and we all know emotions aren‚Äôt real </s>, didn‚Äôt tell me to protect ME and MY feelings, deleted everything to protect me (really to protect the cooze) and offering me ZERO transparency to what really happened. Incredibly traumatic, to say the least. The pain remains and has never been truly addressed.
 
We went to discernment counseling the week I found out about the affair and decided to try and make things better with a couple‚Äôs counselor. Well, that was a shit show ‚Äì she called me by another name in session, Lou used it as a time to vent about all his ‚Äòissues‚Äô with me in a tremendously mean way, showing that my yelling and anger drove him to the affair, blah blah blah‚Ä¶ He was hurtful and seriously vengeful during these sessions. 
 
Days before Christmas 2018, he pulled the escape hatch and said ‚Äì I don‚Äôt want to be married anymore. Given our agreement years ago I had to respect that and left the very next day to go to my family‚Äôs house about 7 hours away. After a few days, I wrote him a love letter saying I missed him, etc and we then reconciled. Or do we? 
 
We had a good run, after the first 3 bumpy months where I initially said you can be friends with cooze, but only if I have total and full transparency. (It was a condition of me coming ‚Äòhome‚Äô with him that she‚Äôs somehow part of his life.) Like anything, he started out doing that then lazily slid into telling me generally (Yeah, I chatted with cooze today) versus showing me the chats or answering my questions on what they talked about. 
 
I cut the whole thing off by contacting her and saying this was not what I agreed to with Lou. She emails both Lou and I saying she wishes us well, but basically ‚Äì peace out. Lou loses his ever-loving mind that I would air our dirty laundry to her, the one he shared by very private pregnancy termination with. He even sent her a direct email that ‚Äòhe‚Äôd deal with me‚Äô. Yeah. 
 
Onward to things being bumpy but we both wanted to buy a new home with more room overall. Since we had a joint project to focus on, things rubbed along smoother through the remainder of 2019. We bought a new condo with more space right before lockdown. However, Lou started getting insecure about his job that autumn and expected unconditional love and support, even when he couldn‚Äôt articulate that he wanted that. It just showed up as anger and frustration because he wasn‚Äôt getting what he felt he needed automatically. (This was the point where my over-compensating wife duties were coming to a fast end.)
 
More years of returning to the cycle: he does something thoughtless and hurtful, I express pain and anger, he gets angry that I am angry when all he did was <insert comments to invalidate my hurt>, I get angrier at the invalidation and start yelling and he fully retreats. These days the same cycle persists, but lately I skip the yelling and just remove myself from the home. 
 
About 2 years ago he found a new couple‚Äôs counselor who is fine. She‚Äôs not easily manipulated by Lou‚Äôs bullshit and calls me out for my own bad behaviors. (She is slightly taken in by Lou's desperate need for a positive mother figure, but whatever.) All fine, expect now after 2 years of weekly, WEEKLY, therapy I do not see the point. She and I both have said in session ‚Äì we‚Äôve covered this, you‚Äôre regressing to Lou. She met with me personally to share in my frustration and to hear how my patience is gone. As of today, I have asked Lou to put any and all therapy appointments on his credit card versus the joint card. It‚Äôs all about him and his need for attention from a mommy-authority figure.

I'm 24 and I have been experiencing extreme brain fog for probably 10 years. I have dealt with depression in the past but I'm not sure if it's just the cause of this problem or if this problem is the cause of depression. I'm 5'9, 168 lb. muscular build, low body fat. I work out everyday and rock climb twice a week. I get an average 6 to 7 hours of sleep, but on weekends it's more like 8. I am tired every second of every single day even when I wake up. I could probably fall asleep at any time in the day and sleep for multiple hours if I wanted to. When I work out or climb I do have energy but it ends pretty quickly about 45 minutes and then I'm just depleted of all energy and I'm tired and it's like my tank just ran out. I eat ground beef, chicken, yogurt, eggs and I drink lots of water and I drink coffee in the morning and afternoon also I eat bread sometimes, I eat rice. I probably don't eat enough calories every single day, but I don't believe that it would have such an impact where I can't even climb for an hour. I take a multivitamin and I take creatine. 90% of the food I eat is what I said and maybe 10% of food I eat is eating out to restaurants. Part of me believes I'm allergic to preservatives or MSG or some type of additive they put in food. I just don't understand I look around and see people eating unhealthy with similar lifestyles to mine and they have tons of energy and are athletic but I put in much more effort of what I put in my body but my stamina is not even half what someone my age should be. It's getting to the point where it's pretty unbearable. Not really exactly sure where to start, would appreciate any ideas. Thank you.",4,1737492693.0,BrainFog,1,1.0,False

I am a 32 year old male, 5'11 and weigh 85 kgs, ideal body weight target is 73. I want to lose atleast 10 kgs without losing muscle mass over the next year. Want to build muscle in the process too decently. Have started going to the gym 3 times a week. TDEE is 2300-2400 cals.  Wanted feedback on the diet because there is too much advice out there -

Early morning (8 AM) - Yogurt with 5 almonds, 2-3 walnuts
Pre workout (8:30) - Black Coffee
Post Workout (10)- One scoop whey mixed with water
Breakfast (11)- 4 egg whites, 2 full boiled eggs, two brown bread toast with either peanut butter or butter toast 

Lunch- skip just have a glass of coffee with milk around 3

Dinner (8)- Alternate between these 3 options 
A)
- 200 gms of grilled breast in creamy sauce
- 1 brown bread slices

B) Half (200 gm) tandoori chicken

C) Chicken salad with veggies 


Suggestions? Is it enough proteins and cals. Does it have right amount of balanced diet component. What's you add/delete/modify.   I try to skip a meal to do Cal deficit. From my estimate, comes out to be 1800 odd calories and ~120 gm protein",1,1737492417.0,Fitness_India,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm 27 years old and have been living abroad for the past year and a half.

I studied Communications in Argentina, which is a broad field that combines aspects of marketing, journalism, design, and more. It‚Äôs a common choice, but not particularly specialized. Throughout my studies, I worked to gain experience:

1. **Year 1:** Managed newsletters for someone I knew.
2. **Year 2:** Did a marketing internship at Motorola - Lenovo. While it was a good opportunity on paper, I didn‚Äôt learn much and lacked the motivation to push myself.
3. **Years 3‚Äì7:** Worked remotely for a digital marketing company that specialized in creating banners for sketchy ads (think weight loss pills and libido boosters). The work was monotonous and involved repeating the same task over and over. I stayed longer than planned‚Äîfour years, to be exact‚Äîbecause the pay was decent, but there was zero professional growth.

Fast forward to 18 months ago: my girlfriend got a great job offer in Spain. After discussing it, we decided to move to Madrid together.

**Since arriving here, things have been... tough.**

It‚Äôs been nearly impossible for me to land an interview. I‚Äôve applied to thousands of jobs and only got one callback, which ended in rejection despite what I thought was a solid interview.

Here in Spain, everyone and their mom has a Master‚Äôs degree. With LinkedIn Premium, I can see that about 95% of the people applying to the same jobs as me hold a Master‚Äôs. Let‚Äôs just say my confidence is at an all-time low‚Äîand I‚Äôve always been a pretty confident guy.

**In the meantime, I‚Äôve turned to the gastronomy industry.**

* I worked for six months as a waiter and learned to be a barista.
* Later, I got into implementing restaurant operating systems for clients, which led to my current role:
   * I‚Äôm now a partner for the company that makes these systems. I earn a fee for selling the OS to clients and another for handling the installation process.
   * Additionally, I‚Äôm a manager at a caf√©/bar, working Tuesday to Saturday afternoons, where I handle bar management, serve tables, and more.
   * On top of that, I work as a kind of accountant for another bar, helping them keep track of their numbers.

**Here‚Äôs the thing: I‚Äôm conflicted.**

I like the bar industry, especially when night falls and the vibe shifts from serving coffee to serving beers, wine, and cocktails. But I‚Äôm constantly worried about two things:

1. The longer I stay in this industry, the harder it will be to transition to a corporate job in the future (though I‚Äôm not even sure I want to).
2. I see my friends and girlfriend progressing in their careers, growing in their industries, while I‚Äôm... pouring coffee. Sometimes I feel deeply resentful toward myself. Sometimes I feel like a loser.
3. I‚Äôm afraid that if my girlfriend decides to return to Argentina, I‚Äôll have nothing to show for my time here‚Äîand significantly less money than when I arrived.

**There‚Äôs one thing that excites me, though.**

The owners of the bar where I handle accounting are considering selling. It‚Äôs a great bar, and I think it could do really well with better management. If they sell at a reasonable price, I have investors lined up who could help me buy it. But for now, this is just a possibility‚Äînothing certain.

**In the meantime, I‚Äôm working on myself.**

I‚Äôve realized that I‚Äôm much more productive in the late afternoons and evenings, so being productive during my free mornings has been a struggle. Still, I‚Äôve been pushing myself to wake up earlier, train every day (boxing, padel, or gym), and quit porn and social media. However my mornings can quickly disolve into a 3/4 hour long gaming/procastination session with nothing productive done.

But despite these efforts, I feel so stuck‚Äîlike I‚Äôm swimming in quicksand, unable to move forward and constantly regretting past life choices.",1,1737492333.0,careerguidance,1,1.0,False

1i6shva,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i6shva/aita_for_feeling_deceived_and_angry_at_partner/,AITA for feeling deceived and angry at partner,"Hi first time poster here.
To put into context, my partner (F24) and I (M25) have been together close to 2 years and live together. She has never given me any signals in regards to her cheating or anything. We both have been cheated on and not the type of person to cheat. 

Shortly before we started dating, an older man (late 30s) invited her out for coffee. She said no due to her not being interested. At the time she worked as a front facing staff at a company so it was part of her role to be friendly to everyone that came in and obviously some took it the wrong way. 

A few months ago, partner and I along with another couple went for dinner and drinks. When we were ordering drinks we saw this man was there with his friends. As we went to sit down, he called my partner over and they talked about the induction process into the company etc etc for 10 minutes or so. After the man and his friends were finished at the bar he walked past our table and bent down to give a half hug to my partner and said goodbye without acknowledging anyone else at the table. This annoyed me alot, any other male relationship she has theres clear boundaries and they will always acknowledge me and anyone else but this man does not. 

I brought this up to my partner that night and explained that I am aware of him being interested in the past and I don‚Äôt think that he is entirely just being friendly. I feel that he doesn‚Äôt respect the relationship and will continue to push. She didn‚Äôt think so but understood the concern and said she will not have any contact with him anymore. We ended it on that.

A month later
This older man has now been hired as a manager of a few departments in my workplace and my department is one of them under his management. 
I called my partner to let her know about this. In that conversation she mentioned that a week or 2 since the bar incident, he messaged her to say if he is cool enough to have lunch with (as he has now been hired but not started) My partner ignored it and never told me about it until this conversion a month later.

I again had to talk to her about this and told her how uncomfortable that makes me feel. I asked her to ‚Äòget rid of him on everything because its obvious he doesnt respect the relationship and is still interested‚Äô. I don‚Äôt remember explicitly saying to block him or anything but heavily implied. Thats my fault for not being clear on that. 

A few weeks later, we were driving in two seperate cars from a mechanic and he was on the side of the road talking to someone. When we got back home, she said to me if I saw him and I said yes. She told me that as we drove past he looked at her and she looked at him and she looked away to ignore him. 
She then said to me ‚ÄòI wonder if he will message me‚Äô apparently as a joke to be followed by so she can ‚Äòtell him to fuck off‚Äô.

My question was ‚Äòwhy can he still message you?‚Äô and she explained that she didnt block him but removed him on social media like I asked. I asked why not just say that to him the last time and block him then. 
She then kept changing from saying she didnt feel like it was such a big deal, then that she didnt feel that he was actually flirting/hitting on her, that she did what I asked and didnt feel blocking was necessary. Now she says that she doesnt have an answer as to why she never blocked him. She went through different stories and I didn‚Äôt accept any of them and challenged her on all.

It carried on into the next morning, I just said to her I am finding it difficult to move past this without a proper answer as to why she didnt block him. She once again said she doesn‚Äôt have an answer. 

She has blocked him as soon as we got home but I am just really confused about how to feel about this. Should I just move on and not think more of it? She hasnt done anything and it‚Äôs not that I think she is interested or going to cheat. It‚Äôs more so I feel like she has played a game on me and deceived me by not telling me about the message and leaving an open space for him to message her after telling me there will be no further contact. 
This sort of feeling just brings me back to a past relationship being told little lies here and there and then being cheated on some time later. 

Tell me I am nuts and overthinking this to the max, and that Im probably an asshole. 

Thank you all

1i6shgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/nanaimo/comments/1i6shgo/giving_away_free_stuff_for_young_renters/,Giving Away Free Stuff for Young Renters,"Hi all,

I've been going through a lot of the stuff that I bought prior to downsizing my 3 bedroom home to a 1 bedroom apartment. I'm looking to give it away, but I want to ensure that the person receiving it is a young person/couple who's just moved out for the first time. I remember how difficult it was for me to build up my first home (my first table was an old bookshelf from my childhood bedroom tipped on its side, and my first set of dishware was just a set of plastic Coleman camping dishware).

I'm not going to piece it out and give things away item-by-item. I've got two Rubbermaid bins and I'll just give them as they are.

There's not a ton of stuff, but in this economy, everything helps.

Some things in the bins:

\- A small air fryer (only been used a few times)

\- A few picture frames

\- A shower caddy

\- One of those pads that charges your phone wirelessly

\- Countertop cutlery holder

\- 2 x 13"" collapsible fabric storage cubes

\- 4 x 2"" binders (great for students or card collectors?)

\- Kitchen strainers

\- Some glassware (pint glasses and some small cups)

\- 2 packs of wet wipes for a Swiffer

\- Ice cube trays

\- A never-used travel coffee tumbler

\- Pillow cases

\- Dish/kitchen cloths

\- A bath mat

\- Unopened pair of floating shelves

\- 3 large kitchen knives

\- 2 x extension cords (the type that have 4-5 plugs each and are great for a computer or TV space)

I may also have some other things. I'll be going through some more stuff in my unit tonight.

I'd prefer that someone is able to pick it up, but I'm willing to deliver from the North End down to Departure Bay.

It's best to DM me if interested. I'll delete this post once it's gone!",18,1737491536.0,nanaimo,0,1.0,False

Perfect LeetCode scores, tracking spreadsheets, optimized resumes - none of it mattered because I was doing it wrong. After a brutally honest conversation with a FAANG friend, I completely changed my approach from mass applications to hyper-focused preparation. The results were immediate: final round interviews at top companies. Here's the systematic approach that actually works, refined from both my successes and failures.

### Small tip
try to use sites like [https://www.buildlist.xyz/](build list) or [https://wellfound.com/](wellfound) instead of relying on the company website itself. these kinds of places often have built-in referral systems 


# Effective Job Hunt Strategy

## Core Requirements
* Portfolio website showcasing relevant work
* Clean, organized GitHub profile
* 2-3 significant projects aligned with target roles
* LinkedIn and resume in perfect sync
* Basic technical interview competency

## The Process
1. Select maximum 3-4 target companies
2. For each company:
   * Build a micro-project using their stack
   * Research their technical challenges
   * Connect with current engineers
   * Get coffee/zoom chats through warm intros
   * Request referral after meaningful connection

## Asking people who have the job already for some help:
* Text people who have the job you want
* Get them on Zoom to talk about their work
* Ask specific questions: ""What books shaped your thinking?"" ""What should I build?""
* End with ""Who else should I talk to?""
* Send a thank you email
* Follow up later showing you acted on their advice (e.g., ""Read that book you mentioned, here's what stuck with me..."", or snap a picture of it in your hands)
* Repeat

## Portfolio Essentials
* Live demos over static code
* Documented build processes
* Problem-solving methodology
* Iteration documentation
* Professional READMEs

## Common Mistakes
* Mass applying without research
* Generic portfolio projects
* Cold applications without referral attempts
* Poorly documented work
* Unmaintained GitHub presence

## Reality Check
If you're not getting responses after giving this method an honest attempt, it's cool. These things are a game of persistence & you only need to win once. Consider taking 2-3 months to upskill and return stronger. There's no shortcut around being qualified.

1i6sg1e,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1i6sg1e/aitah/,AITAH,"I [25 F] started dating a guy [33 M], around six months ago. He‚Äôs a nice guy and we‚Äôve been a healthy couple for most of the time. His parents are actively trying matchmaking for him and getting him married. Now since we‚Äôre only dating for 6 months as of now, I did not want to rush into getting married before atleast one year of dating, when he discussed the prospect of us getting married. 

Now, we‚Äôve seriously started discussing the idea of getting married and while I do believe we‚Äôre a good couple, recently we‚Äôve started having few arguments here and there about each other‚Äôs lifestyle habit. 

Now here‚Äôs what I don‚Äôt like about him: he‚Äôs an impulsive buyer and spends all of his salary in the first 7-10 days of week, even though he makes twice the amount of money I make. And because of which I have to be the one who‚Äôs always paying for groceries or date night. So I suggested that he should start budgeting better. 

Here‚Äôs what he doesn‚Äôt likes about me: 
1. He says I am not a clean and organised person.
2. I keep my house messy.
3. I don‚Äôt cook meals on time. 
4. I keep things cluttered
5. I eat a lot of junk
6. I don‚Äôt take care of myself enough to live a healthy lifestyle. 

Few other point to note : 1. I am not an unhygienic person. I bathe twice everyday and have excellent oral health. People have always completed me that I smell great. 
2. I do agree that I am a little messy person. I dont fold the clothes as soon they‚Äôre dried and it takes me solid 4-5 business days to fold them and keep them back in cupboard. But I am struggling with ADHD, and have the bad habit of procrastinating. 
3. My house is always neat because I have hired a cleaner for it. He complaints that if I eat something I‚Äôll just keep the wrapper on my table instead of throwing it right away to dustbin. 
4. While eating dinner or having coffee I don‚Äôt put the mug and plate immediately after and instead I continue watching the movie or whatever I am doing.
5. I do eat junk a lot but I am a big time foodie who likes trying out new restaurants. And most of my life I had a good metabolism so I used to be really skinny. I did gained some weight recently (I still weigh around 55kg with 165 cm height, so I am in a good BMI range ) and I want to join gym but gym in my areas are very expensive if you buy the month wise plans and I am saving some money to buy the yearly plan as most of my money has gone to buying groceries and other household expenses. 
6. I am not an early bird and often wake up around 9:30 in the morning. 
7. He works in office while I work remotely, so he doesn‚Äôt likes coming home to a messy home and meal not cooked on time. (Again my house is cleaned by a cleaner so the only mess is the unfolded clothes from laundry and the food plates /carton/take out boxes which I‚Äôve left around my workstation. 

Recently I had a big fight where he said that his parents are gonna be big time disappointed if they meet a dirty unhygienic girl like me and he doesn‚Äôt likes coming home to a messy unkempt home. 

My counter argument was that: he is an impulsive buyer which leaves him with no money so instead of complaining all the time I stepped in took care of all the household expenses. So can‚Äôt he accept my flaws too and help in fixing whatever he feels in wrong around the house???

His defence: He has helped around the house (which he did once or twice), but after seeing him help, I have let myself go and don‚Äôt it even more. And he said, I will never find a guy who‚Äôs going to want to be with me because I am a dirty person. 

And I said: he has to accept me who I am right now as a person wheather I am messy or dirty or whatever else he thinks. 

So my question is- AITAH for expecting my boyfriend to accept my bad habits and not working to fix my messy lifestyle??? (I am trying but I am not being consistent in that).

PS: we don‚Äôt live together. We‚Äôve different apartments. He stays over at my place for most of the time. We both have full time jobs and make good income. ",1,1737491434.0,AITAH,2,0.66,False

I don‚Äôt think my daughter loves me.

My daughter is 16 weeks, nearly 4 months. We had a rough start together, with an emergency c section under general. I couldn‚Äôt hold her for 3 hours. I don‚Äôt remember my first 2 days with her due to being put to sleep and on lots of drugs after because local anaesthetic doesn‚Äôt work on me so was the only way to control c section pain. They also promised that they would bring her straight to my husband and they never did. So we have no idea what her first hour was, where she was, what happened. They said it‚Äôs not in her notes either.

Breastfeeding was tough for the first few days, but from day 5 she‚Äôs been exclusively breastfed. We still ran into problems like a shallow latch but she went from the 9th percentile to 85th very quickly and it didn‚Äôt hurt so I‚Äôm not too worried.

Her first month she was attached to me. Constantly fed and wouldn‚Äôt sleep in her crib. She had awful reflux and had issues, would cry an awful lot in pain and really struggled. 

Around 6 weeks she became so happy and smiled all the time. She started sleeping in her crib and mostly did 10:30 - 6:30 occasionally with one wake up for a feed. 

She got really sick over Christmas with a viral infection and completely went of her milk, she would scream at the breast and spend a lot of time crying. She got better and then had her vaccines. She still refused the breast a lot but had plenty of wet and dirty nappies.

Since Christmas, all she does now is cry all day every day. She was hitting her milestones so well, loved tummy time, was so happy and loved to see me. 

Now, even when I hold her I can‚Äôt comfort her. She doesn‚Äôt seem happy to be with me and me rubbing her back, stroking her, rocking and shushing doesn‚Äôt seem to calm her. I have to wait till she‚Äôs exhausted and then she‚Äôll feed and fall asleep. She doesn‚Äôt sleep well at all anymore. It‚Äôs hourly wake ups all night for 3 minutes on the breast. She‚Äôs definitely been teething this whole time too as sometimes the only thing that calms her is to chew very hard on my finger. However nothing has cut through so I don‚Äôt know how long that will be. When she‚Äôs so desperate to chew for hours and getting so distressed calpol seems to help a lot. 

She‚Äôs so unhappy, doesn‚Äôt smile much anymore, doesn‚Äôt seem interested in her toys and books anymore and just won‚Äôt nap. Some days her nursing is great and some days it‚Äôs awful. I keep wondering if I hadn‚Äôt had a c section and we‚Äôd had the golden hour everyone says it‚Äôs important would she love me more and would she feel comforted by me. 

I was just about ready to do some classes with her but I can‚Äôt imagine it at all  now as I know she‚Äôll just be unhappy and I won‚Äôt be able to calm her. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôve done something wrong and if I‚Äôve failed her already as her mother. I see mums from my antenatal class taking their babies out to classes together or coffee but I can‚Äôt because I know she‚Äôll sob and I don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôll think. 

I loved breastfeeding her and now every time she rejects me I feel awful. I just don‚Äôt understand what happened. She‚Äôs still gaining a weight so I at least know she‚Äôs getting what she needs. 

I dunno, I wonder if I wasn‚Äôt meant to do this. My water broke at 32 weeks and I keep wondering if that‚Äôs its way of telling me that my body and I are not made to be a mother.

when i was 15 and things werent working out at my first job, i decided to apply to the same fast food chain as amy and got accepted, causing us to interact more
Amy has done things that make me uncomfortable on multiple occasions, im just gonna list a few that help give context to why im cutting her off. 
1) made jokes about her father being racist (i have brushed this off since ive never interacted with her father before) 
2) made jokes about calling me the n word (i admit i shouldve addressed this when it happened, but we live in a deep red state and im surrounded by people who think like her everytime this happens)
3) allowed her white boyfriend to call our mutual mexican friend the hard er then told me about it as if it was funny.
4)made remarks about my intelligence and says im incorrect about things im very passionate about(i want to become a pediatric nurse and she will come to me about health issues then say something along the lines of ‚Äúwell _ said this so no‚Äù
5) reposted known racists(against african americans) to african american songs and praised political figures somewhere on the same level of God. we had a previous discussion about how this was weird and she agreed.
6) though we live in a red state, our school is filled with left leaning people. a girl a grade above us was reposting charities for palestine, amy would purposely bring starbucks to school despite my advising that its not that smart and showing her the actual damage that mindsets like hers do. (i was also in a relationship with a palestinian man at the time and she knew this) a week later she suddenly thought dutch bros was the best coffee and i havent seen her mention starbucks since.

as we are familiar with, we recently went through a heated election period that i will not get too much into unless necessary. This has opened my eyes to a lot of things that i didnt understand 8 years ago. TO BE CLEAR, i am more left leaning but the point of this post isnt to argue about politics. Amy has been on the other side of this. i specifically dont talk politics with my friends because of the state i live in being super red. any time something semi political came up, amy would get quiet or brush me off. she recently began posting about how we are finally saved and how doubters would soon see and other cryptic things. i removed her off all socials and stopped talking to her in class even though we sit together. she hasn‚Äôt questioned much yet but i spoke with my friend and he said i shouldve cut her off long ago. i told him my past with people pleasing and not wanting to be disliked, leading me to put up with this. he still told me that i was at fault for letting it get this far. i told him he didnt know how i was thinking nor what its like to be in my shoes(hes white and lives in a blue state). things have been tense since.

Since the company is a Fortune 500, the products are spanning on multiple continents, with a lot of stakeholders, it‚Äôs easy to loose touch with the broader context when discussing small details (that matters) and the impact each decision can have on the product ecosystem. 
I‚Äôve created a Miro board in an effort the create transparency and clarity on our users, their flows, relation with hardware, discovery pieces, etc. I use it everyday to ground my stakeholders in the shoes of our users and help them see where a new features/digital capabilities lays in the ecosystem and its dependencies. Enterprise Architects are also using Miro and we start to speak the same language. 
I‚Äôm working 100% remote and miss all of the coffee or corridor chat that can glue decision making or give context to stakeholders. Since my timezone limits my interactions with Europe, I make the effort to write down detailed answers and use it as a platform for decision making. As many companies, we usually tend to jump on a meeting to discuss stuffs, often without clear agenda or a clear plan of what we should expect as outcomes of the meeting, sometime with no documentation of the matter discussed in the broader picture. I‚Äôve been writing down most of my answers, ideas, processes and plans, sometime in quite long post but exhaustive in term of content to offer people context and clarity. I‚Äôm inviting my stakeholders to react based on what‚Äôs written. I see at least two virtuous consequences: first it helps people embraces complexity as what‚Äôs written usually describe the issues/questions/problem and by itself the text becomes a readable and ‚Äúdocumented‚Äù artefact. It can easily be shared and enhanced with people feedbacks. We‚Äôre not using Slack so it‚Äôs still mails threads but at least, whenever we have to jump on a meeting, we can refer to specific elements previously detailed.

(we can customise the plot and it's details according to the character you choose..)

I was thinking she is doing day to day work while you play like a naughty and spoild kid who always touches her here and their and sometimes slips his hand inside too from his childhood and she thinks he is just a kid so she lets him...but now you are big enough to understand things but didn't let her know. 
she is innocent so she sees it as just her kid touching her...but over the time you will starts touching her naughty and making her hungry for it and liking it inshort you will corrupt ur innocent mother...


 at first you will get holiday for 1 month..so you starts living at home..(if you okk we can make him have hyperspermia and he cums like 1 cup at a time which i don't know) and somehow the internet of his area is not working for a few weeks...so you don't know what to do abt your regular cumming problem as you can't watch any po*n now...so as you was helping me at house work..you starts growing some naughty thoughts for me but you controls them..but one day you wakes up early so you decided to make black coffee for me... so you make it half  a cup in a big coffee mug and comes in my room to give me the bed coffee but you got shocked by looking at my semi nude body while i was sleeping..you couldn't control by seeing me like this but starts to jerking off and got no place to cum so you cums in the coffee and after that you will always cums in all the food you cook for me without letting me know and after a few days you somehow tricked me into something(we can discuss later) then i also gets corrupt and might later with your friends too...

4. ***Aunt√ónephew***

Setting: A scenic train journey through the countryside, with vibrant landscapes flashing by the windows. The train car is moderately busy, filled with families and travelers. The rhythmic clatter of the train provides a comforting backdrop.

Characters:

Aunt: A caring and slightly quirky woman  full of warmth and humor. She enjoys the little moments of life and often shares stories from her past.

Nephew:  a slightly awkward but endearing. He looks up to his chachi and is always willing to help her, even in embarrassing situations.

Aunt's Husband: A laid-back man who enjoys the journey and often dozes off. He has a good-natured sense of humor and is protective of both his wife and bhatija.

Plot Expansion:

As the train rolls on, the aunt and her husband are seated together, chatting and enjoying the view, while the nephew is nearby, absorbed in a book. Suddenly, the chachi feels the need to freshen up and heads to the washroom.

While she‚Äôs in there, an unexpected mishap occurs‚Äîa malfunction with the washbasin causes water to splash onto her clothes, leaving her wet and slightly embarrassed. Realizing she can't go back to her husband like this, she quickly thinks of her nephew, who is always ready to lend a hand.

She discreetly calls him on her phone, trying to keep her voice low so as not to attract attention. ‚ÄúNephew, I need your help!‚Äù she whispers, a hint of panic in her tone.

The nephew, startled, quickly sets aside his book and rushes to the washroom, concerned but also trying to suppress a chuckle at his aunt's predicament.

Once inside, they navigate the awkwardness of the situation‚Äîhe helps her dry off with some tissues he has, and they share a lighthearted moment as she jokes about her clumsiness. The bhatija reassures her that it's no big deal, and they brainstorm how to manage until they can find a way to dry her clothes properly.

Feel free to adjust any elements or add specific details to fit your vision!

Background: I‚Äôm 25, overweight, 1yr married, and making enough money to have no excuses. I recently quit nicotine (2 weeks and never going back thanks to Allen Carr) and my wife and I got the idea to do a 30 day carnivore diet from her family and some close friends.

My why: I am fat. (230 on day 1 - 6‚Äô1‚Äù) I enjoy the challenge and want to get back in shape. I want to see what this whole thing is about. 


How it‚Äôs going: 

Really well for me. I‚Äôm doing lots of eggs cheese & bacon for breakfast, hamburger Pattie‚Äôs for lunch and steak for dinner for the first week - may mix in some chicken for dinner, unsure yet. Poops like clay, haven‚Äôt made it to the runny stuff yet.

My questions: 

1. DOES IT MATTER WHICH MEAT I EAT??? I hear mixed reviews about this - Is there too much eggs? Should I moderate egg vs chicken vs beef vs bacon vs venison? If I stay within the confines (salt, meat, water) does it matter? 

2. I included black coffee - will this have negative effects 

3. Is pepper and seasonings off the table? We haven‚Äôt had it but I know some people do. 

4. Coming off after 30 days - what will that look like in my stomach? Any tips? 

5. Electrolytes? Supplements? I read the rules, I know I don‚Äôt need them, just thought it may make things better as time goes on. 

6. Organ (liver) how to cook/ is it good?

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for almost a year. Up until a couple weeks ago, the relationship has been nothing but fighting and arguements, which almost always ended in me being blamed and her being upset. Most of our arguements have all come from factors that include: when she is in a bad mood, when I say/do something that she finds weird/stupid/dumb/immature, when I try to difuse a situation that could lead to a fight (which always did), when my tone of voice is slightly off (but she can use whatever tone she wants and I have to learn that this is her tone), and the list goes on.

Yesterday, I took a day off (when I couldve been working OT) to help my girlfriend pick up a few things for her fathers bday (her father lives out of town and was coming in the next day). She was working herself and couldn‚Äôt get it done as she was so busy with school and running errands. She knew I had planned to work it, but I care about her and wanted to help. I took the day then to help her out, and even dropped by her work with a coffee and even bought her a gift. When night came and she came home, I had supper ready and on the table, and afterwards I went and grabbed her another coffee (because the one she had when she got home tasted like crap apparently), so I went and got her another. 

When I got home, she was packing her lunch. She asked me if I wanted some greek yogurt with strawberries and granola for my lunch the next day. I pondered it, and politely declined. This is where things went sideways‚Ä¶. She looks at me after I decline and says ‚ÄúSo its not healthy enough for you?‚Äù. I was confused, and replied saying ‚Äúyes its healthy enough, its just not for my diet thats all‚Äù. She then replies ‚Äúwhy do you gotta make me feel bad?‚Äù. She was getting angry and I was started to get really confused and tried calming her down. I then said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I wasnt trying to make you feel bad, I was only saying that FOR ME, I wouldnt have it. But it is perfectly healthy and this is a great snack to have!‚Äù. She then stated ‚Äúomg can you just listen to me? I cant ever express my feelings in this relationship‚Äù. I started getting upset myself and wasnt sure what I was doing wrong to make her this upset. She kept bickering about it some more before I said ‚Äúhold on, I think you might be overreacting here sweetheart. I didnt mean to make you feel bad for what you were doing‚Äù. She then snapped, calling me rude and how she knew it was a big mistake to let me move back in with her. I didnt appreciate the way she was talking to me so I told her I was leaving for a couple minutes to cool down and that she needed to do the same, and that I wasnt putting up with the disrespect. After some talking, she seemed to be fixated on the part where I told her she was overeacting. I knew this was wrong of me to say, and I apologized, but she didnt seem to take my apology but rather continue to threaten the relationship. Idk what to do and can really use advice.

Thanks guys.

I'll write my biggest deal breaker first so you don't have to keep reading if you're not interested.

Having lots of relationship history with intimacy. Personally I don't have ANY intimacy experience on purpose and I don't want someone with LOTS of experience/relationship history. Also if you broke up recently that's also a big no for me. No one is an aid band duh.

I'm 6.1 - 185cm muscular build, (not too shredded) wide shoulders, white skin, black hair, eyes and beard ( I don't like having a long beard so I keep it short or shave ) . You can see me from the link below.

I'm from Turkey and my ethnicity is Caucasian.

My personality type is INFP-A , I don't believe horoscopes or to any religion.

I'm a Concept/2D Artist. I draw character designs, potraits, any stuff I like.

I'm loyal, empathetic, protective, dependable and love to share every thought I have with my partner and also expect the same thing.

I love melancholy in general, I have couple of sad song playlists on Spotify.

My main hobbies are drawing, powerlifting and gaming. I also do some other stuff like playing electric guitar sometimes but who cares.

I like getting and giving attention in equal terms.

I'm also an open book, I don't hide anything.

Also, I do care about physical attraction, I'm adding my photos first so you don't have to send a message if you don't find me attractive enough. In the end everyone has a different taste.
