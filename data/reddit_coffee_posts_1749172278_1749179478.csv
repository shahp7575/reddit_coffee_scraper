1l4i56h,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1l4i56h/accidentally_snooped_and_found_something_on_my/,Accidentally snooped and found something on my dad’s phone.,"My sister and I(f18) bought my dad(55) a new phone for Christmas. I dropped my phone this morning, and needed to make a call urgently, so I looked for his old phone so I could pop my sim card in there. It was in his room, but in the drawer where all of our old tech is, nowhere special or hidden so I thought nothing of it. I opened it up, surprised to see it has a pin on it, but I assumed he just didn’t wipe it after transferring to his new phone. I know his pin, he told me himself, so I unlocked the phone since I figured I don’t need to sign into anything to make a call anyway. It opened up onto his pornography screen recordings. A whole gallery full of it. I didn’t click on anything, but it was minimised and I could see everything there. There were no women.
I am in my last year of HS, my sister is at uni.
My parents have never had a good relationship. They got married late, and very quickly. Then they struggled to conceive both of us. They had an argument when I was 6 where my father called me into the kitchen and tried to make me go along with a story. My mother found condoms in his bag, he said that I had grabbed them from the doctors office and brought them to him asking what they were, and because he was embarrassed he just grabbed them from my hands and stuffed them into his bag. My parents used to argue a lot, and would ask me to choose who was right, and I hated seeing my mom upset, so I agreed to what he said.
Two months later my father blew up on our household because my mom threw away one of his shirts(it had some irreparable coffee stains) and he used that as an excuse to move into the guest bedroom. He has been in the guest bedroom since then.

I used to have a habit of snooping around his room as a child, looking for the chocolate he always hid all over the place. I found condoms multiple times. Different brands, different packaging and everything. He is a pastor so I assumed it was for some family planning charity work our church did, since they were always in bulk boxes, think 100-200.

Two years ago I caught my mother having an affair with her boss. I sat her down and we talked about how its not a healthy relationship. He is still married, albeit separated, and the power dynamic was being abused. He held my mom’s performance review(she is a medical researcher) over her head if she did not “come to work” on my birthday (Saturday). I ended up getting tired waiting for her to come home so I went out with my friends and I saw them in his car on a secluded road. I also talked to her about the consequences if my father finds out about it, and what that would mean for the church community’s attitude towards her. I helped her look for another job and she seems happy in her nee position, but she seems lonely and has been hinting at having nothing left if I decide to move away for uni soon.

Last year I caught my father texting someone explicit photos. It was a really odd situation because he was texting another man photos of a naked woman. I obviously didn’t read texts or anything so I have no idea what the conversation was about. But I found a folder full of these photos under a “whatsapp-sent” folder on his phone after he asked me to help him fix something with his notifications. Admittedly, I didn’t handle it well. My father is a very odd man, very violent and he seems to like it when people think he is mean. He often says very misogynistic things. So the first thing my mind went to is that he is sharing an affair partner’s photos without their consent. We had a screaming match and he threw me out of the house by my hair and locked me outside for a full winter day in my sleepwear. He let me in just before my mother came home, and to avoid upsetting her I changed into my school uniform and acted like I had attended school that day. The next day my father called me into his office and told me that the photos I saw were sent to him, unsolicited, and he was sharing those photos with the husband of the woman who sent them. I knew he was lying to me but I didn’t want to push.

Since then I have been talking to my mom more and more about divorce. I have saved up some money for her to add to her savings if she would like to leave him, I’ve even tried pressuring her a little, but she keeps saying she doesn’t want a divorce because she will lose her whole community.

I have talked to my father about divorcing my mother too, but he told me he loves her and does not want to divorce her because shes not capable of living on her own. (She is a little codependent but I honestly think shes an incredibly capable person. She is just lonely.)

My father has gotten much better in the last year or so. He no longer yells or screams, he doesn’t throw things around in frustration and he largely leaves me alone when it comes to comments about my clothes or weight. He has made a new group of friends, two couples, one straight and one lesbian couple. He goes to the gym regularly with the husband and one of the two wives now. I think I attributed his calming down to his new exercise routine?
Our church is divided by the lesbian couple, but my father has stayed friends with them, despite me having to reprimand him often about saying homophobic things.

I do not want to involve my sister in this, as she has relatively little contact with our parents as is. There were no arguments, and my father never hit her or yelled at her since she was very quiet and didn’t involve herself in their arguments, whereas I did since I was a toddler. I also think my father doesn’t feel like he has anything in common with her, he calls me his “carbon copy”.(i do find it slightly offensive because id like to believe id treat my loved ones better). He has always been very controlling when it comes to me, but he didn’t really care what she did past the very basics(good grades, home at curfew, eat healthy, no drugs or drinking) and to her credit she was always a very well behaved child.

I found a stack of 4k in cash in my father’s drawer after I found the phone today, I wanted to see if he was hiding pills in his room again. (He came to me and asked me to steal cash from my mother when I was 15, and I found out he was paying a dr in the church to prescribe codeine to him in high doses- I wrote an anonymous email to our local health board about it and she left the area soon after, saying she was going on a sabbatical). I found a bottle of prescription medication in the same drawer, with the label scratched off, but the pills do not look like codeine and the mg is not high enough for it to be used to get high even if it was codeine.

This is getting really long winded Im sorry. I just don’t know what to do here and I don’t know if I am comfortable leaving my mom in this house when I move.
I have asked her to leave him so many times and she keeps saying “but then I have no one”. She has talked about moving with me in a joking way before but if I am honest, and this might sound selfish, I don’t want her to. I love her so much but I cannot keep sharing a house with her for the time being. She gets in my bed almost every night because her room is a mess, even if I help her clean it often. And she uses all of my things, my perfumes, soaps, moisturisers, even though she has her own. I buy my own toiletries and she can afford much nicer products than I can. And she is always venting to me. Last night she got upset with me for being distracted while she was talking to me about how her parents got her sister a horse when she wanted one when they were 8 years old. I have heard about it many times and while I appreciate that she needs to vent I also think that shes had 45 years to work through that, 18 of which I have been around for, and I cannot keep being sympathetic and giving her hours of my life every night over the same issues. I have encouraged her to make friends, but she will go out with them for coffee once, and then come back and tell me that they said something that was clearly hurtful because of some past context, and she struggles with the fact that they didn’t have that context so they clearly didn’t mean to hurt her feelings. But after that she will ignore their texts for weeks on end until they end up giving up.


What I saw on my father’s phone was not regular images of homosexual pornography. It was violent snapshots of some really intense BDSM scenes. I have no judgement there, but I can’t help but wonder whether my father is watching it to get enjoyment because he is gay, or because he is homophobic? Or maybe some combination of both?
I don’t know if I should tell him what I found and ask him about it? I don’t know if our relationship would ever recover if I did, or how he would react since he’s clearly ashamed of some part of this.

I don’t know if he is frustrated with his life and if he will take that out on my mother again or not? He used to physically intimidate her often during arguments, and he strangled her once. But that would be when I would run into the room and that usually distracted him enough for him to either calm down or direct it towards me, I have always been much louder and outspoken than my mother or my sister so he had a harder time scaring me during arguments. But it died down the last few years. I would go away on school trips and everything would be fine at home. He has stopped commenting on my mother’s appearance, and he’s stopped being so nit-picky and rude about anything she does.

My problem is, if my mother finds out about his pornography and what he watches she will start and argument and she will not let it go. They will push each other’s buttons and then I worry that he will have a physical response. I worry that his male gym buddy is someone he has a relationship with (the friend’s wife made a joke about them being made for each other and they got intensely uncomfortable, I thought nothing of it at the time but now I wonder). Cheating from both parties aside, thats not a stable relationship and what happens when it cannot progress further? Will my dad lash out? He has told me a few times that he has had some suicidal ideation, and that he has nothing to live for. And I worry that he would harm himself, but I mostly worry that he would take my mother with him in some way. He can drive dangerously when he is angry and he has had some episodes where he would drive towards steep drops or at high speeds while yelling in the car. At the moment my mother drives either with me or with him in the mornings, and its a 40min drive. What will happen when im not here? Do I confront my father? Do I tell my mother???? Do I try and do a drug test on my father’s urine(he tends to not flush in the mornings) but even then what do I even do if it comes back positive???

This all feels super surreal and I have been droning on asking the same questions again and again im sorry. I just do not have anyone I can talk to thats not in out church, and they are not trustworthy they will immediately try and oust my father. I don’t want to hurt either of my parents, and I cannot separate them without doing so it seems….",1,1749179287.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I can't make up my mind. Do I stay? Do I go? These feelings about my current relationship  have been here for years, long before you came and went, but when you came back a second time, and then left, the feelings returned with such intensity and now I can't suppress them. The urge to leave gets stronger everyday.

Yet, while my heart says leave, my mind says stay. If I left my current relationship, I have no reason to believe you would return. We hardly knew each other. We had a few short conversations with lots of what felt like intense eye contact over a few months. I could have read this all wrong in my state of loneliness. You were kind and though I wanted to act to see if more was there, I couldn't disrespect my partner in that way. I wanted to ask you to join me for coffee, I wanted to engage in more conversations to get to know you on a deeper level, but that would have been a slippery slope. 

Desire, longing, and familiarity got the best of me. One look in your eyes and I felt like you were staring into my soul. It was beautiful. And now the moment has passed. As far as I know you have no connections to this geographical area and it wouldn't make sense for you to return. Even if you returned, there's also a million reasons why it's unlikely that we would be a fit, realistically. Eventually the age difference and some other factors would be an issue for multiple reasons. 

And then there is an equally strong urge keeping me here. I keep hanging on to the hope that my current relationship will improve. There are other reasons to stay, and I won't list them here. However, I can't decipher if my hesitation derives from fear of the unknown, or if my brain is making the rational decision. I'm going to seek out a therapist to help provide some clarity. 

In a sea of a million reddit posts, the odds of you seeing this are slim, but if you ever do read this, I hope you know how kind and amazing you are. I avoided you only out of respect for my partner and if circumstances had been different, perhaps I wouldn't be shouting into the void, I'd be telling you this directly to your face.

But for about a good 4 or 5 years now I keep seeing my birthday numbers randomly. 

So it often happens that I look at the time and it just perfectly is exactly to my birthday. 11:17 … this happens in the am, or could be pm. 

Somehow I often find myself looking at the time and it’s at that precise moment to the minute. This happens quite regularly! 

You may say a very tuned internal body clock. 

But I see the number in other places too, got a speeding ticket and it was on a Saturday morning returning from a friends house after morning coffee and a chat. And got a ticket at exactly 11:17. The camera captured my car tag and it said 11:17am the date and the road, and of course that I was a certain limit over. 

Going out of my house to go somewhere put the time on the gps and estimated time of arrival, 11:17. 

Oh the soccer game has started let’s watch it, put the tv on, the first thing I see, we missed 11 mins and 17 seconds of the game! 

Bought a new microwave and installed it, guess what for some reason when we plugged it in the digits were 11:17 that flashed on the screen. Like somebody set it to a timer and it was counting down and stopped exactly at 11:17 or something. 

Recently, wife and I getting flight tickets and getting assigned seats e11 and e17 (of course we got it switched) 

The craziest one of all, I got assigned the last 4 digits of our new car a year or so ago as xxx-1117, I asked for a differnt one. 

There’s a bunch of other times it’s happened but these are the ones I can remember off the top of my head. 

It’s coincidence, I know, but what exactly is the universe trying to tell me? lol. 

Has anyone ever seen a set of numbers appearing everywhere often like this?

***Xander Ridgeford, Straider General***

*December 5th, Earth year 2103*

*Dreadnought.* With how often the term is thrown around, it’s easy to forget where it came from. Dread nought—‘fear nothing’. Standing aboard one of these top-of-the-line leviathans, I can confirm that they live up to the title. 

Meg was the pride of our fleet: clunky? Sure. Cutting-edge? Hardly. But she had teeth befitting her namesake and had pulled us through more hellstorms than I cared to count. These Inzar models, though—voted names ‘Rex’ and ‘Quetzal’—were more than that. They were *cities*. Mobile, heavily-armed cities well over three times the size of our original dreadnought. 

Reading out the specs of these models, I had to go over them multiple times just to believe the words coming out of my own damn mouth. Of course, it was one thing to read about these features listed on a screen. If I really wanted a feel for these ships, I’d have to see it all for myself.

Gathering together my lieutenants, I piled us all into a transport vessel and typed in the necessary commands for it to bring us into the Rex. “Are you sure you trust this ‘Dovetail’ person?” Probed Eddy, looking upon me with skepticism as one of our new Dreadnought’s docking bays opened up to allow us inside. “I mean, look at the size of these things! There’s no way they snuck them out without the Council knowing.”

*“The galaxy is a big place,”* Replied Dovetail’s voice from a speaker on the transport, startling everyone save for Avery and I. *“You’d be surprised what can get lost out here.”*

“How the hell?” Hugo growled, concern visible on his face. “Xander, how much access did you give to… *Dovetail*?”

*“None,”* the speaker responded in my place, their geometric avatar showing up onscreen as though to look us in the face. *“I can break through firewalls as easily as one of you can kick down a door. Fortunately for you, we are on the same side.”*

Seeing that this did nothing to alleviate the concerns of my underlings, I turned my seat around to face them directly. “At ease, people: Dovetail is an ally… For now at least.”

*“Thank you for that vaguely threatening* explanation\*, Xander,”\* Dovetail replied, sounding almost amused by our conversation. *“Of course, when you all see the inside of this vessel, I get the feeling you’ll trust me just a little bit more.”*

A few minutes later, our shuttle rattled into place upon a landing pad within the hangar, and we all stepped out. The difference between this vessel and our old one was obvious not even at a glance, but a *breath*. The air on the Megalodon was stale and smelled vaguely of rust. Here on Rex, though, the air was crisp and clean—the kind you only get from the real expensive filters.

“Smells like Earth…” Avery noted, taking in a deep breath as though she had been drowning for the past twenty years. “Or at least what I remember it smelling like.”

First impressions mattered, and this ship made one hell of a sales pitch on us. Sparkling white floors squeaked slightly beneath our worn boots as we made our way to the high speed in-ship tram system. “First things first…” I murmured, pressing down on the button labeled ‘bridge’. Within what couldn’t have been longer than a minute, the tram doors opened back up and we stepped out into the vessel’s nerve center. 

“My god…” Dwight gasped, running his fingers along the chrome side of a top-of-the-line holographic display table depicting Rex's myriad weapon systems. “Antimatter missiles, relativistic railguns, and… Is that an RKV bay?”

If those weapons were meant to fight a battle, the interfaces that guided them were meant to win a war. AI targeting assistance, experimental neural weapon interfaces, simulation tech that could tell you how a battle would end before you fired the first shot. 

“These shields…” Began Peraq, reverently running his claws along the hologram like a priest polishing their religion’s most holy relic. “These are Saharkhi plasma triweave—the best non-confidential prototypes of it are fifty years from usable. This thing can shrug off a nuclear bomb like a spitball.”

*“Or survive within a star for nearly half an hour,”* Dovetail chimed in, their voice projecting from every speaker on the ship as though they were a god addressing their disciples.

“What even *are* these ships?” Hugo growled, staring down one of the screens displaying Dovetail’s avatar. “I’ve never even heard of half of these weapon systems!”

After being glared at for a few seconds, Dovetail emitted a sound resembling a sigh before once again speaking up. *“Project Andromeda is a Council contingency plan. In essence, with only a tenth of the galaxy properly explored, the odds of external threats existing that could challenge them has been estimated conservatively at 68%. In order to preserve their civilization in the event of a catastrophe, the Council is constructing thousands of these vessels. Worst-case scenario, they are designed to keep the populations within safe while ferrying them to the Andromeda galaxy—a journey that would take generations.”*

“And you’re saying they have *thousands* of these things?” Avery half-whispered, her eyes wide with a mixture of awe and terror.

*“Fortunately, no,”* our benefactor replied, pulling up a holographic diagram depicting the two vessels gifted to us. *“These ships are merely working prototypes of the final design. Council scientists are still in the process of perfecting this model for intergalactic travel. Originally, these two were going to be recycled, but with a few credits in the right hands and some sympathetic hands on the inside, I was able to get them marked as ‘nonfunctional’ and ‘too dangerous to dismantle’—a combination which led to them being spaced instead. From there, it was a simple matter of outfitting them at black market ports and sending the toys your way.”*

Meanwhile, in the center of dozens of holographic displays sat a captain’s chair that to my eyes more resembled a throne. Approaching it with hesitant steps, there was a small part of me that felt like I was supposed to be kneeling. However, this chair wasn’t demanding that I kneel—it was beckoning me to *sit*. 

Of course, before I could truly claim that throne, I had to know more about the vessel I’d be king of. “Color me impressed,” I chuckled, turning back around to see my lieutenants all taking stock of the weapon systems. “What else has she got?”

In response, the tram door opened back up, and Dovetail’s voice came on inside as though they were waiting there for us. *“Allow me to give you a guided tour.”*

Stepping back into the tram, nobody needed to press a button for it to once again start moving, carrying us away from the ship’s brain and down into the body that would sustain it. When the doors opened back up, none of us could believe what we were seeing. Lining the sides of a promenade as wide as an airport corridor were rows upon rows of massive, multi-story installations. Approaching the nearest one and navigating to its first room, I saw Hugo’s jaw damn-near hit the floor as we opened the door and found ourselves within a small living room complete with a mounted flatscreen. “These aren’t just living spaces: they’re fucking apartments!”

Back on the Megalodon, it was all I could do to make sure everyone had a cot to sleep on and access to a communal shower. Taking a look around this living space, it was all I could do not to gawk at its comparative decadence. The bedroom had an *actual* bed, fresh-scented white towels laid in a tidy stack within the private bathroom, and the kitchen came pre-stocked with non-perishable goods. *“Each of these habitation spaces is intended for one person, but can easily accommodate three or four should the need arise,”* Dovetail practically gloated. *“There are, of course, larger dorms meant for couples and families.”*

Moving on down the promenade, whispers of anxiety and excitement bounced between my crew as we surveyed the civilization in a can we’d just been handed. 

Our next destination was what Dovetail referred to as the ‘productivity zone’. Asteroid mining bays already harboring metallic riches waited in silence with top of the line tools at the ready to help us exploit the starbound bounty. “No more scrounging for scraps…” Added Avery, her words hanging in the air as she ran her fingers along the rough, rocky surface of an asteroid.

Then came the factories—*plural*. Row upon row of assembly lines erupted to life as we walked in, miming their usual tasks in a mechanical salute to us. “Look at this interface!” Peraq chittered, visibly blown away. “With these, we can produce anything we need! Guns, ship parts, prosthetics, civilian products.”

“What exactly powers all this?” Hugo growled, his question beating the register of a challenge to Dovetail. 

*“There are three cold fusion reactors onboard this vessel and its twin. Only one is required to maintain all of the essential functions—keeping the factories running and the pool warm. The other two are largely backups, though their power can be instantaneously routed anywhere throughout the ship—”*

“There’s a goddamn pool!” Eddy practically shouted, his former doubts seemingly dead in the water as Dovetail guided us into the recreational sector. The smell of chlorinated water greeted us like an old friend as we stepped into the massive swimming chamber. Warm, simulated sunlight shone down from the ceiling, glistening off the legion of white lounge chairs waiting poolside. 

Slowly approaching the water’s edge, Dwight stared down at his reflection in its still, glassy surface. “The last time I swam I was crossing a muddy lake to escape animal control.”

Before anyone could stop him and without removing his uniform, Eddy sprinted toward the water’s edge and cannonballed in. In attempting to shove Dwight aside, however, he instead wound up taking my weapons tech into the water with him. It was the first time in years—maybe ever—I’d ever heard Avery lose her mind laughing. Given that this was a big moment, I decided against chewing out my propagandist for this lack of decorum. 

Then came the bars—because of course this damned ship would have two of them. The first one we entered had a high-class air to it. Fine imported wood and wood-analogues from across the galaxy comprised the comfortable stools and the counter already outfitted with spirits the names of which I couldn’t even pronounce. *“I made sure to have everything pre-stocked for you all,”* Dovetail began, their voice crackling through our earpiece*s. “Of course, both available bars are equipped with their own breweries.”*

“Of course the Council needs a fancy bar on their ark ship,” Hugo growled, nevertheless retrieving a glass and holding it up to one of the lined up taps out of morbid curiosity. Even he, however, could barely maintain his scornful expression when a stream of golden-brown beer poured itself out for him. 

For what it was worth, the second bar was much more Hugo and my style—complete with dart boards, a pool table, and arcade machines. “Oh, this place is gonna be popular,” I chuckled, watching as Eddy and Dwight went at each other in a game of ping-pong. “Gotta say, Dovetail: you outdid yourself.”

*“Better than the Old Guard, I trust?”* Our new benefactor snarked, their knowledge of our other contact startling me, though I tried to hide it.

“This is all well and good,” Hugo interjected, his tone suggesting that everything was in fact not well and good, “but how exactly are we supposed to keep a bar stocked? We’re not even self-sufficient with fucking nutrient paste!”

*“You’re going to like this next one,”* Dovetail replied, waiting for us all to take our leave before guiding us back to the tram and selecting a button I hadn’t even read the label of. ‘Hydroponics bay’.

As the tram silently whistled to a stop and its doors opened up to show us the other side, we were greeted not by a hallway, but a horizon. Humid, earthy air rushed to greet us, rich with the scent of chlorophyll and fresh soil. What lay beyond us looked less like something you’d find in a warship and more like a valley cracked open beneath an artificial sky. Tiered layers of farmland stretched out above and below us, lit by massive sunlamps perfectly portraying a gentle spring morning. 

“Holy shit…” Eddy and Avery breathed practically in unison. 

Each of the four layers stretched two miles in either direction, partitioned by near irrigation channels and flanked by cobblestone walkways. Without a word, we walked as if in a trance through the median layer, passing by fields of wheat that waved us forth and corn that stood at attention. As we navigated further to the back, the scents grew stronger and more exotic. Mint and cilantro grew up against the walls alongside groves of trees that sagged with fruit—apples, oranges, mangoes. Coffee beans and cotton grew in neighboring patches, their presence a silent promise of warm clothes and a steaming morning brew. 

Peraq chittered with reverent disbelief, gently taking a peach into his clutches. “This kind of acreage could feed tens—no, hundreds of thousands!”

*“The top three layers are for crops,”* explained Dovetail, their voice coming on over a PA system that echoed all throughout the artificial farmland. *“The bottom level is specialized for livestock. There are chicken embryos ready to incubate within the lab two floors up. I also went ahead and genetically modified some bees for optimal honey production. They don’t sting, of course!”*

Then, Hugo stopped walking. Turning my gaze to follow his own, I saw that my sheriff was staring at a patch of vivid red just off the path—strawberries, fat and ripe and crawling over their planter bed as though begging someone to try them. 

Without a word, he stepped off the path, knelt down, and picked one. The rest of us watched in silence as he turned it over in his calloused palm, his fingers trembling slightly—just for a moment—before he bit in. 

There was a crunch. Then silence. Then, very slowly, Hugo turned away from us. I saw his shoulders grow tense.

“Hugo?” I asked, approaching him cautiously.

Back still turned to me, Hugo shook his head. “It’s nothing,” he murmured. “I just haven’t had a real strawberry since I was nine.”

When he turned back around to face us, nobody questioned the redness in his eyes. Dwight for what it was worth was too busy searching for the brightest piece of fruit to bite into. 

“Avery,” I called out to my second in command. “Once we’re back on the bridge, I want you to get to work resettling civilians onto these ships. Everyone else: promote your best underling—we’re going to need to staff these two behemoths. And Dwight?”

The weapons tech turned around to face me, wiping a smear of red juice from his face. “Yes sir?” He asked.

“I need you to make sure Rex's weapon systems are prepared. The Jakuvian homeworld is heavily-guarded, and our new friend needs us to give ‘em hell.”",3,1749178704.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1l4hwnv,https://i.redd.it/ly4snd3s185f1.jpeg,About me:,"I don’t show my face , not because I’m afraid to, but because I’ve always liked the idea that the most beautiful parts of us aren’t always the most visible. Privacy, to me, is a kind of romance. And the world feels safer when you keep a little mystery for yourself.

I’m a wife, a mother, and someone who finds joy in quiet luxuries , soft fabrics, handwritten letters, fresh flowers in the hallway. I collect things that tell stories, vintage jewelry, designer pieces I waited years for, books that still smell like the shelves they came from.

I grew up in the city with a big heart and even bigger dreams. Life didn’t always feel soft, but I did what I could to soften it anyway. Now I spend most of my time working hard, laughing gently, raising a family, and trying to keep a little beauty in everything I touch, even if it’s just coffee in my favorite cup.

I write, not professionally, just in the way that people do when they feel too much and need somewhere to put it. I bake when I’m anxious, I paint when I’m tender, and I host dinner parties like they’re little poems made of wine, candlelight, and people I love. I’m learning pottery and dressage right now , which I realize sounds slightly chaotic , but it’s grounding in a way that makes the noise fade.

Style wise, I love things that whisper instead of shout. I take my time choosing what I wear. Not because I need to impress anyone, but because certain pieces just… feel like me. I think getting dressed is another way we tell the world who we are , without saying a word.

I giggle when I’m nervous and cover my mouth when I laugh too loud. I believe in softness as strength, in elegance that doesn’t demand attention, and in being kind , especially when no one’s watching.

Anyway, if you’re here , hello. I’m glad you are.
I don’t always share much, but when I do, it’s from the heart.

1l4hu2e,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l4hu2e,My Little Secret: How I Finally Got That Panthère Vibe (Without Selling a Kidney),"Hey Reddit fam,

So, a few weeks ago, I was having a bit of a pity party. Scrolling through Instagram, seeing all these stunning wrist shots of the Cartier Panthère. You know the one – that sleek, almost liquid-like bracelet, the elegant square face, just pure old-school glamour. It’s been on my ""dream watch"" list forever. But then, as always, my eyes would drift to the price tag, and reality would hit me like a ton of bricks. We’re talking serious cash, folks. Like, ""down payment on a small car"" kind of cash.

# The Panthère Dream vs. My Wallet's Reality

I love watches, I really do. But I'm also living in the real world, and a multi-thousand dollar timepiece just isn't in the cards right now. I'd almost resigned myself to just admiring from afar, maybe buying a really good coffee table book about iconic watches.

# The Whisper That Changed Everything

Then, one evening, I was chatting with a friend – a total genius when it comes to finding amazing fashion alternatives. I jokingly mentioned my Panthère obsession and my budget woes. She just winked and said, ""Have you looked into a good [Cartier Panthère watch dupe](https://cartierwatchdupe.com/collections/panthere-de-cartier-watch-dupe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=cartier-panthere-watch-dupe)?""

Honestly, I was skeptical. I've seen some ""dupes"" out there that just scream ""fake"" from a mile away. I wanted something that captured the *spirit* of the Panthère, the intricate details, the feel of quality, not just a cheap copy. I wasn't trying to trick anyone; I just wanted to enjoy that iconic design on my own wrist.

# Diving Down the Rabbit Hole (and What I Found)

So, I started my research. I scoured forums, read reviews, and really tried to understand what made a ""good"" **Cartier dupe watch**. My main criteria were: it had to look authentic (not like plastic), feel solid, and most importantly, truly embody that elegant Panthère aesthetic.

After a lot of digging, I stumbled upon a site that had a really impressive collection. They weren't just showing grainy photos; they had detailed descriptions and multiple angles. I took the plunge, focusing on one of their **Panthère de Cartier watch dupes** – a classic stainless steel model.

# The Unboxing That Blew My Mind

When it arrived, I swear my jaw dropped a little. This wasn't some flimsy trinket. The bracelet was fluid, just like the original's signature links. The dial was crisp, the hands perfectly proportioned. It felt weighty and substantial on my wrist. It had that undeniable ""Panthère vibe"" that I'd been chasing. I even got the 23mm, but they have a range of sizes, including the classic 30mm, and even options with diamond bezels or in beautiful two-tone finishes. I've been wearing it constantly, and it truly brings me joy every time I glance at my wrist.

# Why This ""Dupe"" Is a Game-Changer

For me, this isn't about deception. It's about access. It's about appreciating a piece of art and design history without having to take out a second mortgage. It's about smart luxury – getting that high-end look and feel, and the confidence that comes with it, in a way that's actually affordable. These are meticulously crafted **replica Cartier watches** that make iconic style attainable.

If you've ever dreamt of rocking a Panthère but your bank account keeps whispering ""nope,"" seriously, give these a look. You might just find your new favorite accessory, and your wallet will thank you.

You can check out the collection I'm raving about right here:

1l4htsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoycottIsrael/comments/1l4htsu/barnes_noble_and_other_companies_that_buy/,Barnes & Noble and other companies that buy Starbucks products,"Hey guys, I wanted to put this as a question/possibly a suggestion. I’m new to boycotting, but I work at Barnes & Noble, which I thought was safe until I thought about their connection to Starbucks. Barnes & Noble sells Starbucks products but is not affiliated with Starbucks, which basically just means that they buy coffee beans from Starbucks. So while their profit isn’t directly going to Starbucks, in a way it is because they are using it to buy products from them. Correct me if I’m wrong but my understanding, one of Starbucks major shareholders is a Zionist and has donated to Israel in the past.


I would like to do something to try to get Barnes & Noble and other companies that buy from Starbucks to stop. However, I don’t know if boycotting Barnes & Noble is the right option because that will just encourage more people to buy from Amazon and Target and other companies that are on the boycott list, and Barnes & Noble isn’t directly associated with Starbucks, but it is buying their products. Is boycotting the answer here? Should I try to collect signatures among workers and customers and send a letter to corporate asking them to stop buying Starbucks products? Should I try to organize a strike? How would I go about doing any of these things?

Please do any due diligence you need, this is not gospel, but it is good stuff to know.

Network Physiology is a fairly new field that studies how organ systems behave like inter-linked oscillators (cardio-respiratory coupling, gut–brain signaling, neuro-immune crosstalk, etc.). A glitch in one node propagates phase-noise through the mesh.

AuDHD women sit at the crossroads of methylation quirks, hormone whiplash, and neuro-inflammatory recoil. TUDCA is one of the rare OTC molecules that clears traffic at the physical (bile flow), cellular (ER), and signaling-network (TGR5/FXR) levels simultaneously.

>**Upgrade the flow node, and every other packet in the body’s mesh stops timing-out.**

# Grand Unified Hypothesis (a.k.a. “The Big, Brash Pitch”)

>**If you liquify the liver’s traffic jam with hydrophilic TUDCA, you can reboot an AuDHD woman’s entire bio-internet in six weeks—melting ER-stress static, quieting cytokine fuse-sparks, reclaiming free hormones, and handing the pre-frontal cortex the clean wattage it needs to feel** ***alive*** **at 7 a.m.**

**Translation:** Thin the bile → drain the toxins & spent estrogens → drop PERK/IRE1 from DEFCON-2 to coffee-shop chatter → restore mitochondrial tempo → lower IL-6/TNF noise → boost vagal tone & HRV → smash brain-fog, crashy mornings, hormone whiplash, and sensory overwhelm with one hydrophilic molecular crowbar.

*(No, it’s not magic; yes, every step is biochemically mappable—read on.)*

# Overview : Why this is even remotely plausible

1. **Bile-Flow Keystone**
   * Estrogen dominance, cortisol & histamine pack bile with sludgey, hydrophobic acids.
   * **TUDCA is 100 % hydrophilic** → osmotically pulls water into bile canaliculi → raises flow rate & dumps conjugated hormones/toxins out the back door.
   * Faster bile clears conjugated estrogens → SHBG often falls 10-25 % and free E2/T rise, rescuing libido
   * Microbiome benefits: lower hydrophobic:hydrophilic BA ratio favors butyrate-positive species (Roseburia, F prausnitzii).
2. **ER-Stress Circuit Breaker**
   * Chronic PERK/IRE1 firing from Long-COVID, MTHFR bottlenecks, MCAS cytokines = nonstop “protein factory” alarm.
   * TUDCA wedges on PERK & IRE1, acting as a chemical chaperone: CHOP & spliced-XBP1 fall ≈40 % in early pilot biopsies.
   * Less alarm → less NF-κB → fewer cytokine flare-ups → calmer microglia.
3. **Mitochondrial Tune-Up**
   * FXR/TGR5 receptors on mitochondria sense the new bile profile.
   * Stabilised mPTP gate, balanced Ca²⁺, lower ROS → ATP supply stops yo-yoing → the “24-hour dopamine echo” perk of AuDHD burnout fades.
4. **Vagal & Fascia Flossing**
   * TGR5 on vagal afferents loves hydrophilic bile.
   * IL-6/TNF dampen, HRV climbs, fascia tension unspools → jaw-clench, sensory gating snarls, and hormone-timed migraines all lose steam.
5. **Endocrine Re-sync**
   * Faster first-pass clearance of estrogens means luteal-phase drops aren’t catastrophic.
   * FXR cross-talk steadies insulin; perimenopause weight-creep gets a metabolic speed-bump.

Below is how tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) re-tunes five high-traffic hubs that routinely bottleneck in AuDHD women—with bile-flow front and center.

# 1. Hepato-Biliary Flow Node OR How a “Hydrophilic Tilt” in the Bile-Acid Pool Gives Roseburia & F. prausnitzii Room to Bloom and why this could flip the switch on gut-brain harmony

**Problem:** Thick, inflammatory bile = congested hepatic “switchboard.”

* Estrogen dominance, cortisol, MCAS histamine, and low-choline diets raise hydrophobic bile acids → sluggish flow, micro-cholestasis, hormone re-circulation. TUDCA fix: Hydrophilic, detergent-like; pulls water into canaliculi, dilutes toxic bile acids, and increases flow rate (human and rat cholestasis models) .

**Key:** When the liver drains on time, the rest of the network stops drowning in backlog signals.

# Putting the Links Together

1. **Detergent Stress** – A hydrophobic-heavy BA pool (post-estrogen-dominance, cortisol, MCAS) behaves like bleach in the colon. Sensitive Gram-positive anaerobes—your butyrate factories—bail out.
2. **Sludge → TUDCA Hose-Down** – Hydrophilic TUDCA flushes that bleach, pulling water into canaliculi and replacing a chunk of DCA/LCA with itself + UDCA.
3. **Ecological Flip** – Once the chemical bully leaves, *Roseburia* & *F. prausnitzii* recolonise the mucus, pump out butyrate, and re-acidify the niche against opportunists.
4. **Systemic Dividend** – Butyrate tightens the epithelial firewall → less LPS/cytokine seepage → quieter ER-stress fuse in the liver/vagus/brain → smoother executive drive.

>**Net hypothesis:** Hydrophilic TUDCA doesn’t “implant” good bugs—it simply **changes the chemical zoning laws** so your native butyrate guild can move back in, restore the colonic power grid, and cut the inflammatory noise that torpedoes AuDHD focus and mood.

# 2. ER-Stress Hub OR Why your cell’s “protein-folding factory” might need some extra help

When a cell makes new proteins, they travel through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)—imagine a bottling plant where every bottle must be perfectly shaped before it ships.  
If too many bottles come out warped (mis-folded proteins), three quality-control sensors—IRE1, PERK and ATF6—slam a big red button called the unfolded-protein response (UPR). That slows production, calls in more chaperones, and, if things stay messy, lights the inflammation fuse for UPR-driven cytokine trickle to cause brain-fog, mast-cell heat, and hormone mayhem.

**SARS-CoV-2 is an ER-stress super-spreader.**  
During acute infection its membrane and accessory proteins swamp the ER and keep PERK/IRE1 stuck “on.” One year later a sizeable slice of Long-COVID patients still show the same alarm lights:

* A 2024 Frontiers pilot found spliced-XBP1 (IRE1 read-out) and phospho-PERK transcripts in 6 of 7 Long-COVID volunteers six months post-infection, versus none in fully-recovered controls. [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1450853/full?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* A meta-omics review published March 2024 reported persistent UPR-gene up-regulation in 14 of 29 Long-COVID datasets (≈50 %). [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11969314/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Put those numbers inside the larger frame—10–20 % of all SARS-CoV-2 infections evolve into Long COVID according to the 2024 Lancet state-of-the-art review. [ox.ac.uk](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2024-08-01-new-study-highlights-scale-and-impact-long-covid?utm_source=chatgpt.com) That means roughly 1–2 people out of every 100 infections may be walking around with a chronically blaring ER alarm today.

# AUDHD women feel the blast twice

1. Methyl-folate bottlenecks (MTHFR C677T/A1298C) → higher homocysteine, which oxidizes the ER lumen and primes PERK.
2. Histamine/MCAS comorbidity → mast-cell cytokines feed the same UPR pathways.
3. Hormone swings (late-luteal progesterone drop, perimenopause) remove estrogen’s natural brake on PERK/IRE1.
4. Neuro‐oxidative demand from ADHD stimulant cycling taxes the same chaperone reserve.

ER stress is therefore sits at the root of sensory fog, post-meal crashes, “inflamed dopamine,” and hormone-timed migraines in this cohort.

# Enter TUDCA, a chemical chaperone with street smarts

What it does

* TUDCA wedges itself onto PERK & IRE1, lowering the trip-threshold; Acts as a “duct-tape” chaperone, helping mis-folded proteins reach their final shape instead of clogging the line.
* Improves mitochondrial calcium handling, the back-up generator that keeps ATP flowing when PERK is active. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11120126/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* A 2025 mucosal-biopsy preprint showed 40 % ↓ CHOP & XBP1 within 4 weeks in post-COVID guts [medrxiv.org](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.02.25322684v1?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Result: lower neuro-inflammation, fewer “24-hour dopamine echoes.”

# 3. Mitochondrial Energy Hub OR Why executive functions are an energy-and-redox sport

Bile-acid receptors (TGR5, FXR) sit on mitochondria & nucleus.

* TUDCA stabilizes the mPTP gate, balances Ca²⁺, and cuts ROS.
* AuDHD perk: smoother reward-circuit activation instead of afternoon ATP brown-outs.

**“Executive drive” (the felt ability to self-start, sustain focus, plan, and persist) is tightly gated by the redox state of the pre-frontal cortex’s mitochondria.** When TUDCA restores a healthier NAD⁺/NADH and clamps down on ROS bursts, dopamine-rich fronto-striatal circuits stop browning-out and the subjective *oomph* comes back online.

|Layer|Redox pinch-point|Executive-function consequence|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**ATP supply**|Opening of the mitochondrial permeability-transition pore (mPTP) dumps membrane potential → ATP crashes within seconds.|Cortical “RAM” for working memory collapses.|
|**NAD⁺/NADH ratio**|A low ratio signals over-reduction/oxidative stress and slows complex-I flux.|Sluggish spiking in PFC pyramidal neurons → procrastination, task-initiation dread.|
|**Dopamine vesicle handling**|Oxidised DA auto-toxically polymerises; vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) is redox-regulated.|Erratic motivation bursts followed by “reward fatigue.”|

# Evidence nodes

* **PFC redox ↔ exec performance** – Over-nutrition drove oxidative stress in rat PFC and impaired executive-linked behaviors; aerobic training reversed both the redox hit *and* the cognitive drop. [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-99303-2)
* **NAD⁺/NADH disbalance → cognitive deficit** – Human \^31P-MRS shows a collapsed NAD⁺/NADH in frontal lobes of patients with cognitive-control disorders, mirroring animal data. [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-023-02568-2)

# What TUDCA does to that redox bottleneck

1. **Seals the mPTP leak** – TUDCA blocks oxidative-stress-induced mPTP opening in H9c2 cells via PI3K/Akt→GSK-3β inhibition, rescuing membrane potential. [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5126306/)
2. **Quenches ROS at source** – In dopaminergic cultures and MPTP mice, TUDCA cut ROS, kept tyrosine-hydroxylase neurons alive, and normalized motor initiation (a dopaminergic proxy for executive drive). [frontiersin.org](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2024.1492028/full)
3. **Up-shifts NAD⁺ economy** – By easing ER stress and Ca²⁺ overload, TUDCA reduces NADH-producing anaerobic compensation, letting the NAD⁺/NADH ratio climb (seen in liver–muscle insulin-clamp trial). [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2911053/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

# Mechanistic bridge from redox to “drive”

    graph TD
    ER_Stress -->|Ca²⁺ leak| mPTP
    mPTP -->|ΔΨm drop| ATP_Crash
    ATP_Crash -->|low energy| DA_Firing
    DA_Firing --> Exec_Drive
    
    TUDCA -->|PERK/IRE1 damping| ER_Stress
    TUDCA -->|blocks| mPTP
    TUDCA -->|↓ ROS, ↑ NAD⁺| DA_Firing

*When ER stress is muted and mPTP stays shut, mitochondrial ΔΨm holds steady → ATP is plentiful, NAD⁺/NADH normalizes, and dopaminergic burst-firing in PFC gets the electrical head-room it needs for working-memory and goal-maintenance.*

# Take-home synthesis

**Executive drive is the behavioral surface-readout of a redox-stable, ATP-flush pre-frontal network.**  
TUDCA’s triple hit—thinning bile (systemic detox), silencing ER alarms, and locking down mPTP—tilts mitochondrial redox back into the green zone. Once ROS stop hijacking dopamine circuitry, AuDHD brains regain the metabolic head-room to plan, start, and finish without the perpetual “battery-low” warning.

*(Still a systems-biology hypothesis*)

# 4. Neuro-Immune / Vagal Relay OR how a TUDCA-boosted bile-acid signal calms microglia, lifts vagal tone, and unknots that jaw-clamp

Bile acids talk to vagus & microglia via TGR5-cAMP.

* Improved BA tone lowers IL-6 / TNF “radio static” → vagal tone up, jaw-clench & sensory-overload down.
* Cross-check: TGR5 activation in NTS slices suppresses hyper-phagia and anxiety circuits (2025 CNS study) [pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12122778/?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

# Why this matters for AuDHD terrain

1. **Chronic low vagal tone** (low HRV, jaw-clench, sensory overload) is a hallmark of trauma-primed AuDHD systems.
2. A **hydrophilic BA shift** provides a *non-psychotropic* lever to tickle TGR5 on both ends of the vagus (gut & brain-stem) and on microglia simultaneously.
3. By **lowering IL-6/TNF noise at its origin**, the relay eases neuroinflammation without needing systemic immunosuppressants—a gentler approach for people already juggling MCAS or hormonal volatility.
4. GLP-1 release gives a bonus **executive-function bump** (steadier glucose, pre-frontal fuel) and clips stress-eating loops that sabotage dopamine balance.

>**Metaphor upgrade:** Think of TGR5 as a noise-cancelling headset placed on the vagus and microglia. Hydrophilic bile acids—amped by TUDCA—provide the white-noise pattern. Once engaged, the headset turns the incessant IL-6/TNF roar into background hush; your autonomic DJ then brings up the parasympathetic bassline, and the whole nervous system finally finds a groove you can work, play, and *rest* in.

*(Still a working model hypothesis*)

# 5. Endocrine Feedback Loop OR How a hydrophilic-tilted bile-acid pool straightens out hormones, glucose, and “peri-PCOS” weight drift

* Better bile flow means estradiol metabolites **leave on the first pass** instead of re-entering via enterohepatic recycling.
* FXR/TGR5 activation tunes insulin-glucose set-points and combats perimenopause weight-creep (Nature review on BA signaling) [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41392-024-01811-6?utm_source=chatgpt.com).
* PCOS-adjacent hyper-androgenism links to aberrant BA profiles; nudging those profiles hydrophilic dampens androgen spikes [nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-77645-7?utm_source=chatgpt.com).

# Why this loop matters for AuDHD women

1. **Hormone roller-coaster** — Thick, hydrophobic bile keeps estrogens ping-ponging; every luteal dip feels like free-fall. Fast hydrophilic flow cuts the loop, smoothing mood & migraine swells.
2. **Metabolic see-saw** — FXR/TGR5 activation is a *built-in GLP-1 mimetic* and brown-fat thermogenic hit—no injections required.
3. **PCOS-adjacent terrain** — Many AuDHD women straddle sub-diagnostic PCOS. A hydrophilic nudge shrinks the androgen-insulin feedback that feeds cystic flares and mid-riff padding.
4. **Executive bandwidth dividend** — Stable glucose + stable E2/T = pre-frontal cortex finally gets a predictable fuel and neuromodulator supply.

**Bottom line:** Thin the bile, flip FXR/TGR5 from “static” to “signal,” and you turn a hormone-glucose demolition derby into a well-timed relay race—one that most AuDHD systems have never actually run before.

# Red-flag situations (pause & ask a clinician)

* Active gallstone attack or biliary obstruction.
* Pregnancy or breastfeeding (no safety data).
* Concurrent cyclosporine or high-dose statins (theoretical bile-acid interactions).
* Severe fat-malabsorption—rule it out first.

# “Devil-May-Care” TUDCA Hack (for the supplement cowgirls & cowfolk)

Read once, screenshot, and ride. This is the bare-bones street version—no lab coat, just the minimum needed so you don’t end up Googling “why are my eyes yellow?”

# 1. Grab the gear

|Item|What to buy|Why bother|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**TUDCA caps**|250 mg size from a brand that shows “third-party tested” on the label|You want dosing granularity and at least a fake badge of purity|
|**Fish-oil-level fat**|Peanut-butter spoon, avocado slice, or any 10 g fat blob|Bile acids hitch a ride with fat—no fat = no absorb|
|**Cheap HRV/pulse app**|Oura, FitBit, or the free camera-flash kind|If your resting pulse shoots up 15 bpm, back off|
|**Fiber***(optional but smart)*  |Spoonful of inulin, psyllium, or cheap Metamucil|Keeps “hydrophilic fire-hose” from turning into fire-hose diarrhea|

# 2. The 30-second protocol

1. Day 1: Pop 250 mg with your fattiest breakfast.
2. Day 2: If no right-upper-belly stab, repeat breakfast dose.
3. Day 3: Still alive? Add a second 250 mg with dinner.
4. Days 4–14:
   * Loose stool? → Cut dinner dose in half.
   * Right-side pain, dark pee, pale poop? → Stop. Call doc.
   * Jaw unclenches, mornings brighter? → Congrats—keep rolling.
5. Days 15–28: Hold at 500 mg/day. Slam 10–15 g fiber daily if you value underwear.
6. Day 29: Take a break —no TUDCA for 7 days.
7. Cycle: If the week off feels worse, you found your potion; run 4 weeks on / 1 off.

# 3. Quick-n-dirty success markers

(You’ll feel these before you get any labs.)

|Felt shift|Means|Do this|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Stools darker, smoother, sink**|Bile flow is up|High-five yourself|
|**Morning “ugh” → neutral**|ER alarm quieting|Keep dose steady|
|**No 3 p.m. coma**|Glucose & ATP smoothing|Maybe celebrate with a walk|
|**Snack impulses vanish**|GLP-1/vagus kicking|Watch waistline—not scale—to spot changes|
|**Jaw-clamp loosens**|Vagal tone rising|Smile… it’ll feel weird|

# 4. Stop-right-now signals

* Knife-like pain under right ribs → ER or at least urgent-care ultrasound
* Diarrhea that lasts > 3 days after you halved dose
* Eyes look like lemon candy (jaundice)
* Pregnant or trying? Slam brakes—switch to plain UDCA under OB guidance.

(Take five seconds to memorize these before you stunt.)

# 5. Common rookie mistakes

|Face-palm|How to dodge it in 5 sec|
|:-|:-|
|“I took it on an empty stomach.”|Don’t. Eat fat first.|
|“Loose stool? I added vitamin C and magnesium!”|Wrong direction—cut TUDCA, add fiber.|
|“Felt wired at midnight.”|Shift dinner dose to lunch or drop to breakfast-only.|
|“No effect in 2 days, doubled dose to 1 g.”|Give it two weeks; bigger hose can flood the basement.|

# 6. If you decide to level-up later

* Pull ALT/AST & SHBG labs pre-game and week 4 (cost ≈ $50 at walk-in labs).
* Add DIM or Ca-D-Glucarate if boobs/skin go haywire.
* Track HRV trend once a week—free data point.

**⚠️ Reality Check**

***This is not medical advice; it’s the least reckless version of popping random liver acid pills. If you can’t name your last tetanus shot date, maybe do the grown-up protocol instead. Otherwise—fat first, track the obvious red flags, and enjoy the potential system-wide tune-up.***

1l4hryc,https://www.reddit.com/r/legal/comments/1l4hryc/is_my_boss_taking_advantage_of_me/,Is my boss taking advantage of me?,"Location: United States 

I feel like I’m not working legal hours, I work a security job and it’s out in the middle of nowhere and an hour commute for reference. 

I work 12 hr shifts with no breaks, we can eat whenever because it is a construction location with no people on site until the last 2 hrs. I am also working 6 hour shifts which for reference i’m getting off at 6am coming in at 6pm every shift. 

We do sit in our cars for these shifts whether it’s 106 degrees or 40 and we are expected to stay awake all shift which is a given but not even a 30min break for a nap has me ingesting coffee like it’s oxygen. 

Additionally i was sick. Like needed an inhaler to walk and was working though they did allow me to do rounds from my car I was reprimanded for not checking clearly locked doors because I watch the workers lock them DUE to not being able to walk. I literally have to leave my house at like 4pm just to be able to make it on top of waiting up for my schedule. I almost passed out and had to crawl to my car and it took my lungs three hours to catch up to go check the doors that literally have bars through them when locked. 

As punishment for being sick even though i repeatedly asked if they wanted doctors notes or medications to PROVE whatever needed they cut my hours drastically. The second I was able to walk i was given requested hours. They also don’t listen to you when you say you can’t work then get mad at you leading to more cut hours. 

We don’t get our schedules until the morning of which usually doesn’t come until 9am-noon EVERY DAY. I am expected to wait on site for every person who comes late for 6hr shifts which is EVERY DAY. 

I think the shift spacing is legal but no breaks, schedule changes due to petty feelings, and schedule providing times feels illegal. So does anyone know the laws for this? I get that being in your car may feel like a break but it’s not, i am exhausted, overworked or underworked, and my time is not respected.

1l4hrlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dancemoms/comments/1l4hrlf/about_christikelly_drinking_criticism_some_nuance/,About Christi/Kelly drinking criticism - some nuance,"I’ve noticed a lot of people on here making assumptions that Christi and Kelly were constantly drinking at the studio or driving drunk during Dance Moms, and I think it’s worth stepping back and looking at this with some context.

Yes, they were known to drink a lot on the show -  They often had wine, but they’ve also said sometimes it was coffee, tea, etc… even joked about it themselves, but that doesn’t mean they were always drinking alcohol. Yes Christi and Kelly often got into fights on the show and it was probably enhanced by alcohol but the environment they were in tells me that would’ve happened regardless. The coffee cups became kind of a bit, and like a lot of Dance Moms moments, it’s hard to tell when they’re joking and when they’re being serious.

Also, just because we think something was in the cup doesn’t make it fact. Unless someone can prove they were intoxicated while driving or caring for their kids, it’s speculation. A lot of fans are using Christi’s DUI (which she hasn’t publicly addressed and happened after the show) as retroactive proof that they were reckless during the show. That’s not fair.

One mistake years later doesn’t justify saying they were endangering kids or driving drunk back then — especially when they’ve both said they didn’t do that. It’s valid to talk about safety, but it’s also important not to let assumptions turn into smear campaigns.

Kelly and Christi now very much seem like social drinkers I don’t think they drink constantly every day. I do however feel that in the past Christi had a problem in the past where she’d self medicate with alcohol and I think recently she was having that issue again during the resurgence of dance moms, however I think the DUI was a wake up call.

Also some people have been saying that Brooke, Paige and Chloe are traumatized by their mothers’ drinking and don’t drink much themselves. However that’s clearly not true if you follow them on social media you’d see they also are all very much social drinkers. ",6,1749178060.0,dancemoms,1,0.8,False
1l4hrd4,https://i.redd.it/4h73eqv5085f1.jpeg,"The Secret to My ""New"" Cartier Panthère (and How You Can Get One Too)","Hey everyone,

So, a few weeks ago, I posted a wrist shot on my Instagram, just a casual pic of me grabbing coffee. And my DMs *exploded*. Everyone wanted to know if I'd finally done it – if I'd splurged on a [Cartier Panthère](https://cartierwatchdupe.com/collections/panthere-de-cartier-watch-dupe?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=post&utm_campaign=cartier-dupe-watch). You know the one. That iconic, slinky, square beauty that just screams old-money elegance.

# The Dream vs. The Reality

Let's be real, the Panthère has been my dream watch for *ages*. I've probably spent hours scrolling through pictures, drooling over the diamond bezels, the two-tone bracelets, picturing it on my wrist. But then I'd click on the price tag, and my heart would sink a little. Thousands upon thousands of dollars. As much as I love watches, that kind of cash just wasn't in my budget. Not unless I wanted to live on ramen for the next decade.

# The Hunt for ""The Dupe"" Begins

I was almost ready to give up when a friend, who's totally in the know about all things fashion and luxury, whispered two words to me: ""**Cartier dupe watch**."" My ears perked up. I'd heard of dupes for bags and shoes, but watches? Especially something as intricate as a Panthère? I was skeptical, but intrigued.

I started diving down the rabbit hole of forums and reviews, specifically looking for **Panthère de Cartier watch dupes**. I wasn't looking for a cheap fake that would fall apart in a week or scream ""flea market."" I wanted something that captured the *essence* of the Panthère – the graceful lines, the distinctive look, the quality feel – without the jaw-dropping price.

# My Discovery: Quality That Surprised Me

After a lot of digging, I finally found a site that specialized in high-quality **replica Cartier watches**. I took the plunge, focusing on a classic stainless steel Panthère dupe. When it arrived, I was genuinely shocked.

The craftsmanship was incredible. The bracelet had that same fluid movement, the dial was clean and crisp, and the size (I got the 23mm, but they have 30mm and other options too, even with diamond bezels!) was perfect. It felt solid, not flimsy. It had that undeniable Panthère charm. I've worn it almost every day since, and it still looks fantastic. I even got the **Golden Brown Gradient** model recently, and it's just as stunning.

# Why a ""Dupe"" Made Sense for Me (And Maybe For You Too)

For me, it wasn't about deceiving anyone. It was about appreciating a timeless design and being able to wear it without breaking the bank. It's about smart luxury – getting the look, the feel, and the compliments, all while being financially responsible. These aren't just ""fake Cartier watches""; they're meticulously crafted alternatives that let more people enjoy iconic style.

If you've been dreaming of that Panthère on your wrist but the price tag has been the biggest hurdle, you *have* to check out these options. You might be as pleasantly surprised as I was.

1l4hpdr,https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerfitness/comments/1l4hpdr/tricking_husband_into_healthier_habits/,"""Tricking"" husband into healthier habits?","I know my title sounds horrible and manipulative, hear me out.

So husband has never had a really good lifestyle. He never really cared about his health actually ... He doesnt eat well, always looking for the biggest portions, is a gamer, etc.

Its been worrying be for decades. I learnt along the way that talking about it never had any good results ... It actually seems to repulse him more and makes things worse (never tried to nag or anything, just expressing my worries). 

Now were getting a little older and we have many kids. He is now working from home ... And our home is a single floor, not super big.

So km getting more andmore worried ... Because immore of a health junky and am aware how sedentarity can be detrimental for ones health.

His movement in a day consist of walking to the bathroom ... Then to the kitchen for coffee, then to his office.

When he takes a break, its to come lay down on the couch. When hes done working, he off on his computer to game.

I sweat he probably does not even hit 500 steps in a day. 

This has been worrying me even more in the past years but I just keep trying to give a good example by having a pretty healthy lifestyle ... Which worked a little bit; he started to come to the gym with me and lifts 1 to 2 times a week.

Better than nothing! But ... He is getting deeper in his 40s and the effects of his lifestyle are starting to show.

Last year he started medication for high cholestherol ... And last month he started some for high blood pressure.

It does not seem to bother him too much (although I know he would not express it openly) but this keeps me up at night. I spent my life worrying about my parent's health and I dont want my kids to live that too.

All that to say ... Im looking for more ... Passive? Ways to help him improve?

Since I wont be able to makehim change, I figured I can make some changes that hes going to live with?

Some examples? I stopped mowing the lawn and started to ask him to do it more often ... Mostly in order to get his body moving;

I prepare tons of veggies for him to eat during the day (fortunately, I am in control of food in the house; and he eats what I cook). I started to add ground turkey into my meals that were only ground beef ...

So im looking for other ideas, that could make a tiny difference in his health without him having to decide to do the change (even if yeah, that would be the best!)

___

&nbsp;

The elevator into doctor Shay Veritas’ personal lab descended for far too long. When Kara looked up to watch the surface moving further and further away, she realized that something inside the elevator was blocking her vision beyond its bounds. She frowned and her eyes fell upon the single button next to the door. It seemed a lot lonelier. The walls felt much closer, and the space felt so much smaller. The ceiling didn’t feel as low as it was when Kara first stepped inside.

Kara bit her tongue. She had trust in Shay. She knew, deep down, that the doctor had her best interests at heart. In the months that Shay had been a part of ARGO Solutions, she had never given Kara any reason to distrust her.

Yet this elevator that Kara stood within felt all too small.

Her heart rushed as the chime played, and the cabin came to a stop, its doors opening to a long, sterile corridor, with closed doors all along its length. She stepped out, still unable to see past any walls, and continued onward, glad to simply be out of the elevator. *At least I’m moving*, she thought as she walked.

Her footsteps echoed up and down the hall, and just as she began to feel as though she was entirely alone, she heard another pair of footsteps abruptly stop. Down the hall, around a corner, a beating heart sped up as it waited out of Kara’s view.

“Doctor Veritas?” Kara called out. “I got your call.”

No voice responded. The hall fell silent as Kara’s steps slowed. She angled herself forward to get a view around the corner before she arrived. The long, magenta hair of Doctor Veritas fell over her shoulders, silky smooth as always. Kara smiled, though as she met Veritas’ eyes, she noticed not the eagerness or confidence that Shay Veritas usually carried, but anxiety and fear. Kara heard her heart quicken.

“Who are you?” asked Shay Veritas. “How did you get in here?”

Kara cocked her head to the side, furrowing her brow. She looked over the doctor, but she didn’t see anything wrong with her. Nothing detectable.

“I’m… Kara– Doctor, are you alright?” The doctor recoiled as Kara reached out a hand. She looked terrified, and Kara’s heart sank as the expression burned itself into her mind.

“Stay away from me,” said the Doctor. “I don’t know who you are, how you found this place, or how you got in here!”

“Doctor,” Kara began, speaking slowly. “*You* told me about this place. You called me and told me where to go.”

“I never told you anything,” the Doctor replied, taking steps away from Kara. “I don’t know who you are!”

“Kara!” Shouted a voice over the speaker system above. “Kara, I’m sorry for this, but please ignore the doctor and head into the lab.”

“Doctor… Veritas?” Asked Kara, looking up at the nearest speaker.

“Yes, it’s me, I apologize,” she said. “I will explain when you arrive. Please do so expeditiously.” There was a moment of silence as Kara and the frightened Doctor Veritas glanced at each other. “The Doctor will be fine, please meet me, Kara.”

Kara nodded to herself, looking back at the speaker on the ceiling nearby. Without any additional words, Kara walked past the frightened Doctor and further down the hall, toward the large double doors under a sign reading ’*Main Laboratory*.’

“She has got to start telling us…” The frightened Doctor mumbled from behind Kara, far enough to believe that she was out of earshot.

Kara approached the doors and looked through the glass to the other side. Her jaw hung open as she witnessed something even stranger than hearing Veritas’ voice so disconnected from her body — dozens of Shay Veritas’ body, moving around and operating independently of one another within the lab. One of them, walking down the centre of the lab toward the doors, moved with intent, cane in hand — something that, until now, Kara hadn’t realized was missing from the other Veritas’. Kara pushed through the doors. She noticed eyes fall on her and, upon their gazes falling upon the Veritas with a cane, returned to their work.

“You have clones?” Asked Kara as Veritas got close. A few of the bodies nearby stopped and turned toward Kara, unsavoury expressions on their faces.

“Not clones, Kara,” said the woman with the cane. “They’re all my… colleagues.”

(“More like slaves,” said one of them, under their breath. Kara caught it.)

“But, how?” asked Kara. “They look exactly like you.”

“Follow me, Kara. Into my office.” Doctor Veritas turned around and walked toward the opposite side of the massive room. “I can explain it better there.”

Kara followed, eyeing the other Veritas’ across the room, feeling their scrutinous gazes in return. Only a few smiled at her, and a part of her somehow felt as though she recognized those specific Veritas’, despite their matching appearances with those who seemed only to judge Kara.

Though, Kara caught herself as she examined the room, it seemed as though most of them were scrutinizing the Veritas that Kara walked with, not so much Kara herself, as an outsider.

The two arrived at the door, and, with a key, the doctor opened it and gestured for Kara to enter.

“Please, sit,” said the Doctor. “It’s a simultaneously simple yet complex answer.”

Kara obeyed and sat in the seat next to Veritas’ desk. She watched as the doctor moved around and sat in her own chair, leaning over the surface of the desk and steepled her fingers.

“Simple would be easiest,” said Kara. “We have other things to–”

“I am their genetic outline,” said Doctor Veritas.

“Clones?” Kara asked, cocking her head and frowning. The Doctor sighed.

“No, Kara,” she said. “When you make a proposal for your projects, do you hand them the rough outline filled with all the scrapped ideas and impossible fever dream plans? Or do you write actual paragraphs instead of bulleted lists and give substantive material instead of surface level thoughts?”

“I–”

“I am the *outline* for them, Kara. I am the outline of the second draft. They’re still who they were five years ago. They simply look, feel, and will age and develop along my pathway, instead of that of their ancestors.”

Kara struggled to come up with the right words. She blinked a few times, shook her head, thought about it for a moment, and then furrowed her brow.

“What?” She asked. The Doctor smirked.

“You heard me the first time, dear girl.”

“Alright, well… how? Why? They don’t seem to like it, is it–”

“You said simple, Kara,” said the Doctor. (“I guess, but still–” Kara said.) “Why, is because it was an error on my part. As for its reversibility, or cure, or whatever word they use to describe what they desire: the truth is that I don’t know. I don’t have their original genetic sequencing. They weren’t changed individually, my sequence was broadcasted to them and they all caught it like a plague. Entirely overwritten. I’ve looked into it, but five years and as much money as I can find hasn’t produced anything. They are, for better and mostly worse, me.”

Kara remained silent once more, sitting back in her chair and falling into a thousand-yard stare. She recalled the sudden attitude changes within who she thought was Doctor Veritas and the talk she had about her anger within the ARGO Solutions lab.

“So you sent–”

“Yes,” said Veritas. “I have an arrangement with my closest colleagues that, should I be indisposed or equally willing to stay here for a few days, they may go out into the world. I was only a known name in quite a small circle, so I have very few worries of them tarnishing my reputation or identity. They are able to do as they see fit, as long as they are not arrested. For my safety and theirs, it’s better to keep things measured while allowing them all as many freedoms as I can offer. I don’t wish for them to be prisoners of my mistake. Unfortunately they are, and I can only offer so many things as consolation.”

Kara felt as though she were receiving repeated blows to the head. She blinked quickly and asked, “Have you ever–”

“Yes, I’ve been in your laboratory countless times. I, personally, enjoy it there, as do a lot of my colleagues. Belinda is a delight to be around and as bothersome as Thea Merlyn is, most of us are glad to not have to look at me all day.”

“What about your–”

“I remind them to take a cane when they go to work for you. Most of them don’t need it in their day-to-day life.”

“Can I get a whole sentence in? Please?” Kara asked.

“Of course,” said the Doctor. “I never said you couldn’t.”

Kara inhaled sharply and leaned her weight on the armrest of her seat.

“We can talk about this some other time,” she muttered. “I want to do something about them. But either way, you’re the one who called me here. Did you find a way to fix my arm?” Doctor Veritas sucked on her teeth and shook her head.

“Not yet,” she said. “Yellow sun radiation has been fighting off the worst of its effects, but it *is* still Kryptonite. A much different, more stable isotope than what we’re used to here on Earth, but it’s no less dangerous to you. It’s in your skin, your blood, and I wouldn’t be surprised if it’s in your bones. From the scans we did at your lab, there are no growths yet, but you still have it in your body and it won’t be expelled quickly or easily.”

“Is it going to kill me?” asked Kara.

“It’s still Kryptonite, Kara,” said the Doctor. “You and I are some of the greatest minds on this planet. We’ll figure this out.”

“You don’t sound certain,” said Kara.

Doctor Veritas sighed, and said, “I would be prepared for the worst.”

Nia Nal sat at her desk with her head in her hands, an open, barely filled document sitting in her word processor, waiting to be completed. She tried to keep her pained groans to herself as she wracked her brain for the next words. The next *good* words. She had the ideas, the outlines, the sources, and the page-space, but each letter was harder and harder to put down with confidence.

Somehow she’d managed to convince her editor to allow a story that was written in support of Kara Zor-El and her so-called failing business, but beyond that approval nothing seemed to come to Nia. Could she approach her article as a friend of her subject? It felt wrong. She watched her colleagues from across the industry do it every day, so why couldn’t she? It was a just cause.

Neither the Titans nor Kara were aiming to do anything malicious with the Phantom Zone projector, they simply wanted to help the Superman clones get to their home dimensions. Nia knew that. Thea knew that. Simon Tycho knew that and he twisted the truth. He sabotaged the projector and nearly killed Kara in the process. Not only that, he released a doctored recording of the event to the public and has taken every single media opportunity thrown at him to commit to his story of being a saviour.

Not one member of the public bothered to care about the fact that Tycho was an arms peddler. He was a rich voice who looked the part for the people he needed to sway, and it worked better than any dedicated PR campaign could ever achieve.

“Tycho’s last sales conference isn’t gonna help you write about ARGO, Nal,” said her editor as he walked by, taking a look at her computer screen and the tabs she had open.

“He’s benefiting from slander,” Nia called out. “He’s smearing her!”

“He’s a good business man!” Her editor responded from across the room. She groaned in frustration and looked back at her screen. The way forward didn’t feel clear.

“I need a coffee,” she muttered.

Standing from her seat, she grabbed the empty mug next to her keyboard and walked all the way through the bullpen and into the break room, where she had seen her editor disappear into.

“Yeah, we got one coming, but it’ll be buried,” he said into his phone, looking away from the door. Nia stopped in her tracks and kept listening. “Simon’s got nothing to–” He immediately hushed as he began to pace, seeing Nia standing in the door with her mug in hand. “I’ll call you back.” He hung up the phone quickly and smiled. “Break time’s over faster than I thought,” he said, moving to leave the break room.

Nia only stood, stoic, as she watched him leave. The moment she figured he was out of earshot, she sighed, slumping her shoulders.

“Of course,” she muttered as she walked up to the coffee machine. “Of course…”

She could picture Thea laughing in her face, its own form of ‘*I told you so*’ coming in the form of her odd cackle. She grinded her teeth as she stood in front of the coffee machine, waiting for it to start making her coffee. Thea would probably remind her of what she’d told Nia mere days ago. She’d rub it in her face and claim that espionage was the way to go. She’d try to make the point that invading dreams was the only way to get what Kara needed.

Nia heard a voice start up and then fall silent by the door. She looked over and saw another woman who worked for National City News turning on her heel and leaving the break room before even entering. Nia shook her head quickly, as if to regain her thoughts.

Thea had never cackled the way Nia was imagining. Nia barely knew if she’d laughed in her presence. She was cocky, but she claimed to try to be realistic. Nia frowned. She could write something good enough to help sway those who read it. She didn’t need proof that Simon Tycho was bad, she simply needed to remind readers why ARGO Solutions was good.

Nia pivoted from her spot and rushed out of the break room. She never grabbed her coffee.

Thea only realized she was knee-deep into trouble when the automated security system deployed a stationary turret instead of a silent alarm. She figured that going up in floors wouldn’t be cause for live ammunition, but as the holes were pierced into the walls behind her, she felt her heart rising into her throat as the realization of how much she had underestimated Simon Tycho dawned on her.

The cameras were the easy part, nowhere had security cameras that were impossible to bypass. Often, Thea found, they were the easiest piece of security to bypass beyond padlocks. Embedded sensors, door alarms, and biometric scanners were much more difficult to trick, but not impossible. It was a pressure plate — beneath a piece of flooring that, itself, did not move — that summoned the turret from its resting position within the ceiling, its plating blending so easily with the tiling that it was nearly invisible to the naked eye until it descended.

Thea could only barely move out of the way before it started firing. From the limited information she had about Tycho’s building, she figured that she was approaching some of his research and development labs. She figured it was odd that there were no people on this floor, that the publicly available blueprints led her to believe it’d be fully populated with office workers, yet there was nothing. She had a reason for why, and it was firing 20 millimetre answers to her question right into the walls around her.

As she caught her breath, hearing the turret stop firing from her position around the nearest corner, she looked around. Spotting a vent cover that she hoped was big enough to fit her, she pulled an arrow from her quiver with an expanding arrowhead and tied a climbing rope to it. She nocked the arrow and fired it directly into the vent cover. As the arrow expanded and hooked into the metal, she tugged at it, pulling the cover loose and allowing her room to run and leap up to climb into the vent. She wasn’t sure if she would be spotted by the turret in the attempt, only barely able to sense the angle into the next hall, but she knew she had to get around it somehow.

Standing and taking a deep breath, she shook her hands out and stretched her neck, her arms, and then pulled her legs up to loosen the muscles. She entered a sprint quickly and jumped to scramble up the wall and into the opening, climbing in within seconds and moving forward without any thought, hearing the turret in the hall begin firing a few rounds.

The pain soared up her leg, quickly telling her that she’d been hit by one of the rounds. Looking down at her leg with what little room she had to maneuver, she saw blooding pouring from a wound. She could barely see in the dark, even with the adjustments she’d made to her Speedy mask, and couldn’t assess the damage while she was stuck in such a tight space.

She pulled herself forward, digging her elbows into the metal and trying her hardest to move in a space that felt like it was closed in around her. She could feel the walls of the vent shaft with every small movement, pressing against her back, her arms, her waist, and her head. She couldn’t move her legs to facilitate her agonizingly slow crawl, all she had were her arms, tucked into her face, to drag herself forward.

She could have entered the elevator shaft and climbed up a floor, but her curiosity had gotten the better of her. She should have seen the signs of a trapped hallway.

She blinked hard. She was almost to the next vent cover, she *knew* she was, but it didn’t seem to be getting any closer.

She felt minutes pass, knowing they were only seconds, as she finally got her hands on the vent cover. Smashing her fist into it as best she could, barely able to get enough leverage for a good enough strike, it took far too long for it to fall off, clanging to the ground, alerting the empty halls.

The fall to the ground felt as though it was the last impact of her life as the air was knocked from her lungs. She coughed, barely able to move for a few moments before leaning forward to try and assess the wound on her leg. It wasn’t nearly as deadly as it felt, but she was still losing far too much blood. She cursed to herself as she attempted to stand.

The boot to the stomach did not help her efforts.

She rolled across the floor and continued coughing as someone grabbed her arm, pulled her up to wrap a leg around her torso, before dropping down with an arm around her throat. Within moments, she felt the blood flow stop and her breathing became much more difficult.

“I’ve been waiting for this,” said a voice, and as Thea’s mind faded into unconsciousness, she recognized the voice of Cameron Chase.

“How are you feeling, Agent Danvers?” asked the man she knew as her handler.

“I’m scared,” said Alex, feeling the sweat drip down her forehead as the pinching in the crease of her elbow throbbed. “What’s going to happen to me?” He offered her a gentle smile, placing a hand in hers. She shut her eyes tightly for a moment, the exhaustion setting in.

“You’ll be perfectly alright, Alex,” he said. “This is standard procedure, and you’ll feel as good as new in no time, there’s just some small details we have to correct first.”

“Details?” she asked, looking around the room, hearing the door open behind her. Footsteps she couldn’t source walked in and set something down on a metal tray. “What details?”

“Nothing to worry about, Alex,” he said. “We just have to straighten things out. Steer you in the right direction, mentally, for the Reactron program.”

“Is that why– truth–” she struggled to maintain a coherent train of thought. Ideas and words mixed in her mouth, entangling between her head and her tongue, and coming out jumbled. She couldn’t focus.

“Not truth,” he said, shaking his head slightly, a slight smirk on his face. “Just suggestibility.”

“No,” said Alex. “Please, I– I want to stop.”

“Everything will be perfectly alright, Alex,” he said. “Like I said, just a few minor adjustments in preparation for the big procedure. You’re destined for great things. I’ve told you that before, haven’t I?”

“Shaw–” She said, blinking hard. “You did– but… Mark, please–”

“You’ll be fine, Danvers,” said Shaw, before turning to the masked doctor who had walked in. “She’s ready.”

She blinked and he was gone. She blinked and the restraints were tightened. She blinked and she felt nothing.",1,1749177811.0,DCNext,0,1.0,False

Statistics with Professor Feldman was the day's first class. In his previous life, Nick had sat through these lectures with half-lidded disinterest, counting minutes until he could leave.

Now, with Arlize's strategic mind integrated with his own, he saw everything differently—including the rumors that Feldman was more than a simple professor. Stories circulated that she dabbled in corporate research deals and classified AI projects that never made it onto her public CV—connections that might prove valuable in his investigation.

*Academic credentials are such convenient covers,* Nick thought as he approached the building. *No one questions why a statistics professor needs security clearance if they're ""consulting"" on machine learning.*

Similarly, he'd need to investigate Professor Harrington and his relation to Matt and Callahan Industries. The name was too similar to be coincidence, and the timing of his research into neural interfaces aligned suspiciously with Callahan Industries' pivot toward the same technology.

*Family businesses come in all shapes—some sell furniture, others apparently manipulate consciousness across dimensions,* Nick mused darkly.

The lecture hall's fluorescent lights buzzed overhead at a frequency that his enhanced senses could now separate into distinct electronic pulses. Nick slid into his usual seat, the same one he'd claimed for the past two weeks. The polished surface of the curved desk still bore faint traces of generations of students—initials scratched into the wood, ink stains from burst pens, the ghosts of equations past. Long tables with built-in seating curved around the lecturer's stage like a gladiatorial arena, students the reluctant combatants armed only with laptops and coffee.

The room smelled of pencil shavings, stale coffee, and the particular blend of body odors that accumulated in poorly ventilated academic spaces. Beneath these mundane scents, Nick's enhanced perception detected something else—a subtle electrical tang, stronger than it should be, suggesting surveillance equipment more sophisticated than standard campus security.

From his chosen vantage point, he could monitor both exits while keeping the professor in his direct line of sight. Students filtered in gradually, a drowsy procession of hoodies and backpacks, the low murmur of conversation washing over him as he reviewed his notes from yesterday's mana breakthrough.

The blue energy had responded with startling ease once he'd stopped forcing it—allowing it to flow naturally rather than attempting to bend it to his will. The sphere he'd created had contained swirling patterns like a miniature galaxy, complex geometries forming and dissolving as if representing fundamental aspects of reality itself. The memory made his fingertips tingle with phantom energy.

Jordan appeared moments later, the sharp scent of his body wash cutting through the stale classroom air. His coffee cup tilted precariously as he collapsed into the seat beside Nick. The aroma of burnt espresso and hazelnut syrup created a small aromatic bubble around him, momentarily overwhelming the room's ambient smells.

""Mornin',"" he mumbled, dark circles shadowing his eyes. His red hair was still damp, curling slightly at the ends as if he'd rushed through his shower. Droplets clung to his collar, slowly darkening the fabric.

Nick studied him carefully, noting the fading yellow-purple bruises on his knuckles and the slight stiffness in his right shoulder as he reached for his backpack.

After his conspicuous absence from yesterday's calculus quiz, Nick had expected some explanation, but Jordan offered none.

""Rough night?"" Nick asked casually, watching for any reaction.

Jordan's eyes flicked up, then away too quickly. A micro-expression of calculation flickered across his features before settling back into practiced casualness. ""Just finishing a paper for Mitchell's English class. You know how it is.""

The lie hung in the air between them. From what he'd overheard from other freshmen in the cafeteria over the last couple weeks, Professor Mitchell wouldn't assign the first paper until week four. Jordan's casual lie was another data point in the growing pattern of inconsistencies.

*Your operational discipline is slipping, Jordan,* Nick thought. *Sloppy tradecraft gets agents killed.*

At exactly 8:00 AM, the door swung open with military precision. Professor Feldman strode in—a petite woman with precise movements, her steel-gray hair cut in a short bob framing her face. Her carefully calculated dishevelment—wrinkled shirt and slightly askew tie—seemed at odds with her precise movements, but Nick recognized the classic technique of academic camouflage.

The intentional appearance of an absentminded professor provided perfect cover for the sharp intelligence in her eyes as she scanned the room from behind rimless glasses, her gaze methodically cataloging faces and reactions. For a flickering moment, her gaze locked with Nick's, something calculating in her assessment before she turned away. That brief eye contact contained more evaluation than most people manage in an entire conversation.

""Settle down, everyone,"" Feldman said, unceremoniously dropping her folder onto the lectern. The sound cut through the morning chatter like a knife. ""Today, we begin with the intersections of probability, machine learning, and real-world applications. Because if we stop at formulas, we've failed.""

Her voice carried the subtle cadence of someone who had given military briefings—each word precise, weighted with expectation of comprehension. The pattern was unmistakable to Nick's enhanced perception: measured pace, strategic pauses, emphasis on key concepts that would return later as critical points. Not just a professor talking to students, but an officer addressing subordinates who needed to understand complex information quickly.

*Definitely ex-military or intelligence,* Nick concluded. *Probably specialized in data analysis or strategic assessment.*

The lecture began with standard statistical concepts—probability distributions and sampling methods they had been discussing the past two weeks. But then Feldman pivoted, discussing AI ethics in a way that immediately captured Nick's attention.

""The next frontier in statistics is the ethical dimension of how we use data,"" she said, clicking a slide depicting faceless silhouettes and large data streams flowing between them. The blue light of the projection cast an eerie glow across her features, reminding Nick of mana pathways. ""Machine learning, predictive algorithms, neural interfaces… all of these rely on math at their core. However, the moral implications can't be overlooked. Who controls the algorithms, and to what end?""

She switched to another slide showing a recent study from MIT. The projection displayed complex graphs and correlation matrices that most students were already struggling to understand, judging by the confused shifting and increased doodling around him.

""Current scientific consensus treats data as objective, claiming 'numbers don't lie.' The Zhang-Harrington paper from a couple years argues that 'statistical neutrality creates a foundation for ethical AI development.' But is data ever truly neutral?""

The slide displayed two author names that made Nick's pulse spike: ""Dr. Elias Zhang, Stanford University"" and ""Dr. William Harrington, Callahan Research Institute.""

The connection was unmistakable—Zhang, like Maggie's brother who had mysteriously disappeared, and Harrington, whose resemblance to Matt was unmistakable in the small author photo, appeared to be the academic arm of the Callahan empire. The paper itself was dated almost exactly 18 months ago—right before Dr. Zhang's disappearance.

*They're not even trying to hide it,* Nick thought, heat rising in his chest. *They just assume no one will connect the dots.*

Nick felt a surge of adrenaline flood his system, his fingers tightening imperceptibly around his pen. Neural interfaces mentioned openly by a professor with military connections. A research paper co-authored by two people directly linked to his investigation. The university was practically advertising the connections, hiding them in plain sight beneath academic jargon and theoretical debate.

The paper itself—widely cited in ethical AI discussions—suddenly seemed less like genuine academic discourse and more like corporate propaganda, designed to establish ""statistical neutrality"" as a shield against ethical oversight. If data couldn't be biased, then those using it couldn't be held accountable for the consequences.

A memory that wasn't his flickered through his mind—Arlize standing in the war council, listening as seemingly unrelated reports from distant provinces suddenly aligned into a pattern of coordinated betrayal. The same sensation of puzzle pieces clicking into place washed over Nick now. This wasn't just about theoretical ethics—it was about establishing the intellectual framework that would allow neural interface technology to advance without restriction.

*Misdirection through academic debate,* Nick realized. *While everyone argues theories, they build the actual tech without oversight.*

He raised his hand, meeting Feldman's gaze with calculated intensity. ""If we know that these algorithms can be manipulated by those with money and power, then shouldn't we question not just the data's neutrality, but who stands to profit from controlling it?""

A stir ran through the classroom, students shifting in their seats. The sudden engagement from classmates usually half-asleep at this hour was palpable—a ripple of energy moving through the room like a wave. Beside him, Jordan straightened almost imperceptibly, his casual slouch giving way to something more alert, more focused. The transition was subtle but unmistakable—like a soldier snapping to attention.

Feldman's eyes narrowed as she leaned forward over the lectern, her posture subtly transforming from academic to something more reminiscent of an intelligence officer receiving unexpected but valuable information.

""Go on, Mr. Valiente.""

The use of his name without prompting—she'd remembered him specifically, or perhaps had been briefed on him. Either possibility was telling.

Nick kept his expression neutral despite the thrumming of his pulse. ""Machine learning is a tool, right? And any tool can be a weapon if someone with questionable ethics wields it. If you're building neural interfaces capable of reading or influencing minds… what's to stop an organization—like a military branch or a mega-corporation—from using that for control?""

The room fell silent, the usual background noise of typing and whispers vanishing as if a switch had been flipped. Even the students who normally spent the entire class on their phones were now watching the exchange with undisguised interest. Nick could feel Jordan's complete attention beside him—not the feigned interest of a casual classmate, but the focused assessment of someone gathering intelligence.

""An astute point, Mr. Valiente,"" she allowed, her eyes narrowing slightly. ""The Zhang-Harrington paper argues that data remains neutral despite human influence, but your concern touches on something more fundamental: intent."" She set down her presentation remote, giving him her full attention. ""If we accept that data collection itself is shaped by human biases and corporate interests, doesn't that undermine the entire premise of 'ethical AI' as currently conceived?""

The question wasn't just academic—it contained a subtle probe, testing how far Nick's understanding extended. He could feel the weight of the classroom's attention, but more importantly, he sensed Jordan's slight shift beside him—a minute tensing that suggested Nick's response was being carefully monitored.

Nick didn't flinch under her intense scrutiny. ""It's only hypothetical until it's real. And by then, it's too late.""

A murmur rippled through the classroom. Most freshmen wouldn't even know what neural interface technology was, let alone raise questions about its ethical implications. Feldman's expression shifted subtly—a flicker of genuine interest, perhaps even wariness. For a brief moment, her carefully maintained academic persona slipped, revealing something sharper beneath—a tactician recognizing an unexpected player on the field.

""You've raised questions that challenge the current paradigm,"" she acknowledged, her tone modulated with professional admiration that didn't quite reach her eyes. ""While some might dismiss these concerns as speculative, history shows us that technology often advances faster than our ethical frameworks. This is precisely why we study statistics—to understand how numbers can be shaped to serve different narratives.""

She turned away, resuming her lecture, but something had changed in the room's atmosphere. Nick caught several students glancing at him with new curiosity, and Jordan's posture remained unusually straight, his note-taking suddenly diligent. The rapid tap-tap-tap of his keyboard suggested he might be transcribing the exchange verbatim.

*Someone's getting a full report on this conversation,* Nick thought grimly. *Let's see who reacts.*

The lecture continued, but Nick sensed he'd left a mark. Feldman's occasional glances in his direction felt sharper, as though she was already categorizing him as something more interesting than a typical freshman. Twice, she incorporated his points into her examples, each reference feeling like both acknowledgment and challenge.

When class ended, Nick approached Professor Feldman's podium as other students filed out. The room gradually emptied, conversations fading as students passed through the doorway. Jordan hesitated nearby, pretending to pack his materials while clearly trying to overhear.

""Go ahead,"" Nick told him. ""I'll catch up.""

Jordan shrugged with practiced casualness. ""Sure thing. Lunch later?"" The question seemed innocent, but the intensity in his eyes betrayed his interest in Nick's answer. A slight tension in his jaw suggested the importance of Nick's response went beyond casual plans.

""Maybe. I've got a busy afternoon.""

Jordan left, though not without a backward glance that Nick filed away for later analysis. His dorm mate's behavior was becoming increasingly problematic—the bruised knuckles, the inconsistent stories, the sudden interest in Nick's interactions with faculty. The surveillance pattern was unmistakable.

""Mr. Valiente,"" Feldman acknowledged as the room emptied, her fingers tapping a staccato rhythm on her folder. The sound echoed in the nearly empty room. ""I must say, your questions demonstrated unusual knowledge for a first-year student.""

Up close, Nick noticed details he'd missed from his seat—a faint scar along her jawline, partially concealed by makeup; the callus on her right middle finger consistent with regular firearm use; the subtle way she positioned herself with clear sightlines to all entrances. Not just an academic, then. Military or intelligence background seemed increasingly likely.

The scar had the distinctive pattern of shrapnel damage rather than a clean cut, suggesting combat experience rather than an accident. Her stance kept her right side slightly forward—the position of someone accustomed to carrying a sidearm and maintaining quick access to it.

""I've done some reading on emerging technologies,"" Nick replied with deliberate vagueness. ""Particularly the intersection of AI and neural science.""

""Most undergraduates don't typically dive into such specialized literature,"" she observed, studying him with renewed intensity. Her eyes flickered over his face as if searching for something specific. ""May I ask what sparked this specific interest?""

Nick met her gaze steadily. ""I believe understanding how these technologies develop will determine whether they liberate or enslave us. The ethical questions can't be afterthoughts.""

Feldman's eyes narrowed slightly, a muscle in her jaw tightening almost imperceptibly. ""That's an unusually sophisticated perspective."" She paused, as if making a decision. ""If you're genuinely interested in the ethical frameworks surrounding these technologies, I can recommend some reading.""

She tucked a strand of silver hair behind her ear, leaning closer, her voice dropping to just above a whisper. ""Though I should warn you—diving too deeply into certain research areas can attract... attention. Not all questions are welcomed by those funding the work.""

The warning was subtle but unmistakable. Not a threat from her, but a caution about forces beyond the classroom. Her tone carried the weight of personal experience—someone who had witnessed consequences firsthand.

""I understand,"" Nick said, holding her gaze for a moment longer than was comfortable. ""I'd appreciate those recommendations.""

She nodded stiffly, something unreadable flickering across her features. ""I'll email them to you."" After a beat, she added, ""Mr. Valiente, curiosity is commendable, but I'd suggest exercising caution about where and how you express these interests."" Her fingers tightened around her folder until the knuckles whitened. ""Not everyone finds such questions... welcome.""

As she gathered her materials, her sleeve rode up slightly, revealing a flash of black ink on her inner wrist—not quite visible enough to identify, but distinctly out of character for her otherwise conservative appearance. She caught his glance and smoothly adjusted her cuff, her expression giving away nothing.

""Thank you, Professor,"" Nick said, turning to leave.

""One more thing,"" she called after him, causing him to pause at the door. ""The Zhang-Harrington theoretical model is being expanded significantly in their forthcoming work. You might find their preliminary findings... illuminating. Or disturbing, depending on your perspective.""

Nick nodded, understanding the deliberate breadcrumb she'd dropped. ""I'll look into it.""

He left the classroom, satisfaction mingling with wariness. He'd established himself as someone watching, someone who knew more than he should. Now he would see who reacted—and how. But Feldman herself was becoming an increasingly complex variable. Warning him while simultaneously encouraging deeper investigation suggested her own agenda, one that might not align completely with whoever she reported to.

*She's testing the waters,* Nick realized. *Seeing if I'm a potential ally against something she's concerned about.*

Nick's second class of the day was Introduction to Computer Science—a course he'd never taken in his previous life but had added this morning through the university's flexible first-month scheduling policy. In his previous life, he'd been focused solely on business and finance, seeing computers merely as tools rather than potential weapons or shields. Now, he understood that code was a form of power in the modern world, perhaps as fundamental as Arlize's magical knowledge had been in Aurilia.

*In Arlize's world, those who controlled mana controlled reality,* Nick thought as he crossed campus. *In this world, those who control code do the same.*

The computer science building was newer than most campus structures, all glass and steel against the traditional brick of surrounding buildings. Sunlight reflected off its surfaces in geometric patterns that reminded Nick of the mana constructs he'd been experimenting with. Inside, the corridors hummed with an energy different from other departments—students clustered around laptops in common areas, their animated discussions punctuated by technical jargon that would have been incomprehensible to Nick before his rebirth.

The building smelled different too—a mixture of new electronics, coffee, and the particular scent of students who prioritized coding over personal hygiene. Beneath these mundane odors, Nick's enhanced senses detected something else—a subtle electromagnetic signature stronger than in other buildings, the air itself seemingly charged with the pulse of countless processors working in concert.

Lecture Hall 103 was filled with first-year students, most looking either intimidated or overconfident—few seemed to occupy the middle ground. Nick chose a seat halfway back, positioning himself with a clear view of both exits and the professor's podium. He placed his laptop precisely in the center of the small desk, angling it slightly to minimize visibility to those around him. Old habits from Arlize, who had always been conscious of who could read his battlefield notes.

At precisely 10:00 AM, Professor Lin strode in, her confident gait and casual attire a stark contrast to Feldman's military precision. She appeared to be in her mid-thirties, with rectangular glasses and hair cut in an asymmetrical style that somehow managed to look both professional and rebellious. Her energy signature was distinctly different from Feldman's—no military rigidity, but a vibrant, chaotic creativity that manifested as fluctuating patterns in her aura.

""Welcome to CS 101,"" she announced without preamble, setting her coffee cup down beside her laptop. ""I'm Dr. Lin. If you're here expecting to learn how to build websites or program video games in your first semester, adjust your expectations now."" She scanned the room, her gaze direct and unflinching. ""This course is about fundamentals—computational thinking, algorithm design, and the theoretical underpinnings of what makes computers work.""

Nick watched with interest as several students shifted uncomfortably. This wasn't what they'd signed up for, apparently. He, however, felt a surge of anticipation. The theoretical foundations were exactly what he needed to understand the connection between mana and technology.

""However,"" Professor Lin continued, a slight smile softening her expression, ""by the end of this semester, you will have built something useful, something that solves a real problem. That's my promise to you.""

She launched into an overview of the course structure—weekly lectures supplemented by hands-on lab sessions, programming assignments in Python, and a final project that would account for 40% of their grade.

""Today, we're starting with the most fundamental question in computer science,"" she said, pulling up a slide titled 'What is an Algorithm?' ""Before we write a single line of code, we need to understand how to think algorithmically.""

For the next hour, Professor Lin walked them through the concept of algorithms as precise sequences of instructions, using examples from everyday life before moving to computational problems. Nick found himself engaged more deeply than he'd anticipated. The logical structures she described resonated with Arlize's battlefield strategies—breaking complex problems into manageable steps, anticipating edge cases, optimizing for efficiency.

When she demonstrated a simple sorting algorithm, Nick's mind immediately connected it to how Arlize had once reorganized his troops during the Battle of Kairn Pass—placing the strongest fighters at critical positions while creating a flexible structure that could adapt to changing conditions. The parallel was so exact that for a moment, Nick could almost smell the smoke from the battlefield, hear the distant clash of weapons.

*The principles are the same,* he realized with growing excitement. *Battle tactics, spell construction, computer algorithms—they're all systems for organizing and directing energy efficiently.*

""Code is really about power,"" Professor Lin said, as if reading Nick's thoughts. ""Not just in the technical sense, but in the real world. Those who understand how systems work can influence them. Those who can build systems control the rules others must follow.""

Nick felt a chill of recognition run through him. This was exactly why he'd added the class. In his previous life, he'd been at the mercy of systems designed by others. This time, he would understand the underlying architecture of the modern world.

As the lecture continued, Nick's fingers moved across his keyboard, taking notes with a precision and focus that would have been impossible for his previous self. Each concept was filed away, cross-referenced with potential applications to his current situation.

When Professor Lin displayed a simple encryption method, Nick immediately saw its value for securing his communications. When she explained database structures, he considered how they might help him organize his intelligence on Matt, Sarah, and the mysterious neural interface research.

*I wonder if I could create a mana-enhanced encryption algorithm,* Nick thought, the idea sparking like electricity in his mind. *Something that uses the principles of the Arcadian System to secure digital information in ways conventional cryptography couldn't break.*

""For your first assignment,"" Professor Lin announced as the class neared its end, ""I want you to design—not code, just design—an algorithm that solves a problem you've encountered in your daily life. Think about inputs, processes, outputs, and edge cases. We'll discuss your solutions on Thursday.""

Nick was already mapping out possibilities in his mind. An algorithm to detect surveillance patterns? A system to cross-reference seemingly unrelated data points? The possibilities were endless.

As students packed up their belongings, Professor Lin added, ""And for those of you who have programming experience and find this pace too slow—come see me. I've got some special projects that might interest you.""

Nick made a mental note to approach her after he'd established his baseline competence. Special projects might provide access to resources or information otherwise unavailable to freshmen.

Checking his watch, it was 11:30 AM. He still had an hour and a half to go before his meeting with Maggie at the engineering lab. Enough time for lunch and some focused mana practice.

For example, my roommates pouring their heart out about an ex that treats them badly and I sit there and listen and nod as much as possible and sometimes I even think to myself “am I making the right facial expressions?” “Am I being open?” “How’s my body language” it’s just too many thoughts instead of being in the moment. Or even ordering coffee with a friend can be rough. I stand there listen to my friend talk to the cashier and talk about music they like to listen to and I’m standing in the background thinking of what to order (now do I want to lemon muffin or coffee smoothie hmm). Now, growing up my dad and mom were two different people, my mom was very quiet and would make some comments when speaking with strangers and my dad would have a whole conversation with strangers as if they were his long time friends. Seeing this made me fit into a similar role as my mother, taking on her shy and quiet side. Which isn’t bad it’s just that I’m having trouble making friends and building relationships and it’s affecting my mental health. Instead of thinking of what to order I could have participated in the conversation, just that most times when I do I feel like I’m looked at as weird or I didn’t say the right thing, I’m not sure how to explain but I feel alienated from society sometimes. When you get to know me I’m pretty open and expressive but at first I can seem disinterested in what people are saying. Not going to lie, sometimes I wanna run away from the conversation cause I just wanna hear the person fully and I feel like I can’t due to my shyness. Sometimes I blank out and forget things when people ask me questions about myself so I’ve made the effort to remember things I like just for the sake of conversation. Don’t get me wrong I do enjoy what I enjoy but I never used to think about having to share it with strangers. It’s probably a coping mechanism from my childhood that still haunts me till this day unfortunately. I didn’t have a great childhood my dad was a bully so I learned to keep to myself for the most part but on the other hand I was the one that liked making everyone laugh as a kid. Weird. 

How do I fix myself?

By 1:15 PM, he'd completed his assignment and needed lunch. Rather than walking to the dining hall, Nick decided to grab a sandwich from the café nearby. He set a subtle trap at his door—a nearly invisible piece of tape connecting the bottom of the door to the frame that would break if someone entered.

The café was relatively quiet, with the scent of coffee and baked goods filling the air. Soft jazz played from hidden speakers, creating a relaxed atmosphere for the handful of students hunched over laptops or engaged in quiet conversation. Nick purchased a sandwich and found a corner table where he could observe both the entrance and counter.

He'd barely taken his first bite when a voice interrupted him.

""Nick? Sorry to bother you."" A girl from his Biology class stood beside his table, clutching a notebook. ""I'm Hannah, from Professor Godrudson's class. She mentioned you had some great insights on the cellular adaptation material and suggested I might talk to you about forming a study group for the lab project.""

*Interesting,* Nick thought. *Godrudson's already recommending me to other students.*

""Right, Hannah,"" Nick said, gesturing to the chair across from him. ""Have a seat.""

Hannah Mercer—he recalled her full name now—sat down, tucking a strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Unlike many students who projected forced confidence, Hannah's demeanor was genuinely calm, her movements precise and economical. She reminded Nick somewhat of Professor Godrudson in her efficiency.

They spent twenty minutes discussing the bio assignment and their thoughts about the upcoming lab, making plans to meet later that week to begin the lab assignment. When Hannah left, Nick looked at the remains of his lunch, an uneaten half turkey sandwich lay on his plate. He was about to get up and ask for a to-go package when a voice from the next table caught his attention.

""Did you hear about Professor Harrington's new research grant?"" It was two graduate students sat huddled over laptops, their conversation just loud enough for Nick's enhanced hearing to capture clearly.

""Yeah, ten million for neural interface applications,"" the other replied. ""My advisor says it's the biggest private research investment the university has ever received.""

Nick sat back down, subtly shifting his body back against his chair to better hear their conversation without appearing to eavesdrop.

""The timing seems convenient, doesn't it? Right after his brother's company acquired NexGen Systems?""

""Careful,"" the second student warned, voice dropping even lower. ""Last grad student who asked too many questions about the Harrington family's research connections suddenly lost his funding and had to leave the program.""

They lowered their voices further, but Nick had heard enough. Professor Harrington—likely Matthew Harrington Sr.'s brother or cousin—was conducting neural interface research at this very university, funded by Callahan Industries.

*The web keeps expanding,* Nick thought, carefully wrapping his remaining sandwich. *Neural interfaces, Matt's family, the attempted hack of my investment files—all connected somehow.*

Lost in these thoughts, Nick barely noticed the time until his watch showed 1:45 PM. Calculus started in fifteen minutes.

Nick made his way to the math building at a brisk pace, mentally preparing for the inevitable confrontation. As he approached the classroom, he spotted Matt exactly where he expected—leaning against the wall beside the door, scrolling through his phone with affected casualness.

But something was different about Matt today. His usual polished appearance was slightly disheveled, his collar pulled higher than normal. As Nick drew closer, he noticed discoloration around Matt's jaw—faint bruising partially concealed with makeup—and similar marks on his knuckles. Most telling was the ring of bruises partially visible above his collar, as if someone had gripped his throat with bruising force.

*Those aren't from a random party brawl,* Nick realized, his tactician's mind immediately analyzing the injury patterns. *Those are precision strikes delivered by someone who knew exactly what they were doing.*

For a brief, disorienting moment, Nick felt an unexpected twinge of curiosity, even concern. Those throat bruises didn't look like random injuries from a chaotic brawl—they were deliberate, controlled, the kind of marks left by someone sending a message.

Then the image of Matt and Sarah together flashed vividly in his mind—tangled in sheets, laughing at his naivety while plotting his downfall. His momentary sympathy evaporated like morning dew under harsh sun.

*Interesting,* Nick thought coolly. *Matt's masters don't tolerate failure. Good to know.*

""Valiente,"" Matt's voice stopped him, that familiar commanding tone now carrying an edge of something darker. ""Hold up.""

Nick paused, one hand on the door handle. ""What's up? Class starts in a few minutes.""

Matt stepped closer, his features tight, controlled. Up close, the makeup covering his bruises was more obvious—expertly applied but still detectable to Nick's enhanced perception. A faint scent of pharmacy-grade concealer mingled with Matt's designer cologne.

""Where were you Friday night?"" Matt's question came out more as demand than inquiry.

""I told you I wasn't going,"" Nick replied evenly. ""I had work to do.""

""Right, your 'work,'"" Matt's voice dripped with skepticism. ""Funny thing. A lot of people were asking about you at that party.""

*I bet they were,* Nick thought, maintaining his neutral expression while inwardly cataloging this confirmation of his suspicions.

""Why would they be asking about me? And why were you so adamant that I be there?""

""It was supposed to be a Westridge reunion. People missed you."" Matt's lie was as transparent as it was insulting—Nick had never been part of Matt's inner circle; his inclusion had always been conditional, a way for Matt to demonstrate magnanimity while keeping Nick subordinate.

""Really? Because what I heard is that there was a big fight. Police were called. Ambulances too."" Nick maintained eye contact, watching Matt's pupils dilate slightly at the mention of the fight. ""Doesn't sound like much fun to me.""

Matt's hand shot out, grabbing Nick's shoulder with bruising force. In his previous life, Nick would have flinched. This time, Arlize's combat instincts surged forward—a dozen ways to disable Matt's arm flashing through his mind with crystal clarity.

*Break wrist at ulnar joint. Nerve strike to brachial plexus. Counter-grip to thumb metacarpal.*

Nick felt a flicker of mana respond to his sudden spike of adrenaline, a faint warmth pulsing beneath the skin where Matt's fingers dug in. The blue energy gathered at key points along his shoulder's nerve pathways, ready to enhance a counterattack if necessary. He suppressed these impulses, remaining perfectly still, neither yielding nor retaliating.

""You should have been there,"" Matt said, his voice low and tense. The faint scent of fear perspiration mingled with his cologne, detectable only to Nick's enhanced senses. ""We had plans.""

""What plans, Matt?"" Nick asked quietly. ""Why were you so determined to get me to that specific party? What was supposed to happen there?""

Matt's grip tightened, but Nick didn't react. Not even a wince. The pressure that would have been painful to normal nerve endings felt distant and analytical to Nick, his mana automatically diffusing the sensation across a wider area.

""Nothing. Just hanging out,"" Matt said, but his eyes told a different story—panic, barely concealed beneath arrogance. His pulse had accelerated, visible as a slight throbbing at his temple. ""You're acting weird lately, Nick. Different. People are noticing.""

There was a warning in those words. People—not just Matt—were watching Nick, evaluating his behavior against some expected pattern.

""I told you before,"" Nick replied calmly. ""People change."" With deliberate ease, he shrugged off Matt's grip. ""I've got class.""

Before Matt could respond, Nick entered the classroom. As the door closed, he caught a glimpse of Matt's expression—the familiar arrogance replaced by something he'd never seen there before.

Fear.

Not just irritation or frustration, but genuine fear. The kind that came from answering to someone far more dangerous than oneself.

*Huh, well isn’t that interesting.*

Nick took a seat, arranging his materials while surreptitiously watching through the window in the door. Matt stood frozen for a moment before pulling out his phone and making a call, his face hardening as he walked away. His posture had changed completely—shoulders hunched slightly, head ducked, the body language of someone reporting failure to a superior.

A new piece of the puzzle clicked into place. Matt wasn't just acting on his own; he was answering to someone who expected results and didn't tolerate failure. Someone with enough power to make even the arrogant heir to the Callahan fortune cower.

*The plot thickens,* Nick thought grimly. *Matt's not just some privileged bully—he's a soldier in someone else's war.*

The calculus quiz flowed easily beneath Nick's pen—problems that had confounded him in his previous life now seemed almost elementary. The mathematical patterns revealed themselves with perfect clarity, each equation a series of logical steps leading inevitably to the correct solution. He finished with twenty minutes to spare, using the extra time to review his answers with meticulous attention.

Jordan's conspicuous absence from the seat beside him raised another flag. First the bruised knuckles and inconsistent stories, now missing an important quiz—Jordan's ""friendly neighbor"" persona was unraveling thread by thread.

*Another piece moves on the board,* Nick noted, scanning the room for other anomalies. *But whose piece is Jordan exactly?*

After class, Nick remained seated until the room cleared, then approached Professor Ellis with questions to ensure enough time passed that Matt would have given up waiting outside. When he finally left, the hallway was empty.

As he walked back to his dorm, Nick maintained constant awareness of his surroundings, twice catching glimpses of the military-postured student from his Statistics class. The man never acknowledged Nick, but his recurring presence couldn't be coincidence.

When he reached his room, Nick carefully checked his tape trap—still intact—and settled at his computer to research Callahan Industries.

His fingers flew across the keyboard, diving into business news archives and technology forums. Using techniques he'd learned from cybersecurity tutorials along with subtle enhancements from the Arcadian System, Nick bypassed basic firewalls to access more detailed corporate records than most people could find.

The screen's blue light reflected off his face as he built a timeline of Callahan Industries' activities over the past three years—from defense contractor to neural interface pioneer. The transition had been surprisingly abrupt, with hundreds of millions in capital suddenly shifted from military applications to speculative neurotechnology research around 18 months ago.

Most of their neural interface work was described in vague terms—""revolutionary human-computer interaction,"" ""next-generation immersive experiences""—the kind of corporate jargon that conveyed excitement without revealing specifics.

As he scrolled through corporate filings, something caught his eye—a symbol in the corner of a Callahan Industries internal memo. Not the company's standard logo, but something subtler: a stylized helix intertwined with what appeared to be a circuit board pattern. Nick had seen similar imagery before but couldn't place where. The symbol seemed deliberately designed to look innocuous while conveying specific meaning.

*Almost like a secret society emblem,* Nick thought, saving the image to a secure folder. *Or a military special project designation.*

He saved the image, making a note to ask Maggie if she recognized it.

Nick dug deeper, tracking acquisitions and personnel movements. Over the past eighteen months, Callahan Industries had quietly acquired five smaller tech companies specializing in different aspects of neural interface technology. More concerning was what happened to the key researchers afterward—reassigned to unknown projects, their academic publications suddenly ceasing.

He expanded his search, finding an even more troubling pattern: researchers who declined Callahan's employment offers often found their funding mysteriously cut, their labs closed under various pretexts. It was as if someone was systematically removing certain minds from the field—either bringing them into the Callahan fold or eliminating them as competition.

*This goes beyond aggressive corporate tactics,* Nick realized, the implications sending a chill down his spine. *This is systematic suppression of an entire field of research.*

One name caught his attention: Dr. Elias Zhang, formerly a professor at Stanford specializing in non-invasive neural interface technology. His research had shown tremendous promise before suddenly disappearing eighteen months ago. The timing matched what Maggie had mentioned about her brother.

Nick pulled up Dr. Zhang's academic profile. The family resemblance to Maggie was unmistakable—the same sharp, intelligent eyes, the same determined set to the jaw. But while Maggie's expression in her student photo was guarded, Dr. Zhang's conveyed open enthusiasm, the look of someone excited to share knowledge.

According to the university's website, Dr. Zhang had taken an ""extended leave of absence to pursue industry opportunities."" But there was no mention of which company he'd joined—unusual for someone of his caliber. Most high-profile academics trumpeted their moves to prestigious corporate positions.

His social media accounts had been inactive for precisely the same period. His last post had been a cryptic message: ""Sometimes the pursuit of knowledge leads down unexpected paths. Will share when I can.""

And then, nothing. As if he'd simply vanished.

Nick subtly enhanced his search capabilities with a touch of mana, directing the energy into his fingertips as they typed. The screen responded differently, search algorithms returning deeper results than they should have—as if the Arcadian System was interfacing directly with the digital architecture of the internet itself.

A cached news article appeared—something that should have been deleted but lingered in forgotten corners of the web. The headline read: ""Leading Neural Interface Researcher Rejects Callahan Industries Offer, Expresses Ethical Concerns.""

The article, dated just days before Dr. Zhang's disappearance, quoted him expressing reservations about the direction of neural interface research: ""The technology itself is neutral, but its implementation raises profound questions about privacy, autonomy, and the very nature of human consciousness. Some applications being proposed cross lines that perhaps should not be crossed.""

Three days after that statement, Dr. Zhang had disappeared from public view. His research lab had been closed due to ""funding irregularities."" His graduate students reassigned to different projects.

*So Maggie's brother refused Callahan's offer on ethical grounds,* Nick thought, leaning back from his screen. *And then conveniently disappeared.*

Nick sat back, mind racing. Callahan Industries wasn't just developing neural interface technology; they were actively suppressing competing research while absorbing key talents. This went beyond normal corporate competition. They were creating a monopoly on knowledge itself.

But why would that make Nick a target? Unless they somehow knew about his connection to Arlize. Or about his knowledge of market movements that hadn't happened yet.

*Either they know something about me that I don't yet understand, or I represent some kind of threat they can't clearly identify,* Nick reasoned. *Either way, I need more information—and quickly.*

Tomorrow's meeting with Maggie took on new urgency, and Nick prepared specific questions:

* What happened to her brother? Had he gone willingly to Callahan Industries?
* What was the focus of his research before his disappearance?
* Had he ever mentioned unusual brain patterns or consciousness transfer?
* Did she recognize the strange helix-circuit symbol?
* Could she access Callahan Industries' secure servers?

Nick also needed to ask about better security measures. If Callahan Industries had resources to monitor students and hack secure systems, he needed stronger protection.

The memory of Matt's bruised neck flashed through his mind again. Matt was caught between Nick's unexpected resistance and someone's unforgiving expectations—a position that would make him increasingly desperate and dangerous.

*Desperate people make mistakes,* Nick thought, a cold smile forming. *And mistakes reveal information.*

Nick flexed his fingers, feeling the mana pulse beneath the surface, a cool blue current of power that was his alone. Unlike Matt, he wasn't caught between competing forces. He was becoming a force unto himself.

As he closed his laptop, the building's ancient heating system kicked on with a metallic groan that echoed through the ventilation system. Nick rose to adjust the temperature control, pausing when he noticed something unusual—a faint scratching sound coming from his door.

Not the sound of a key or someone knocking, but something subtler—like a tool being inserted into the lock. The metallic scraping was barely audible to normal hearing, but to Nick's enhanced senses, it might as well have been a blaring alarm.

Moving silently, Nick approached the door, mana surging beneath his skin in response to the perceived threat. Blue energy flickered faintly around his fingertips, casting subtle shadows in the darkened room. The power responded instinctively now, activating in moments of danger without conscious effort—like an immune system recognizing a threat.

The doorknob turned slowly, a nearly imperceptible movement that sent Nick's combat instincts into high alert. He held his breath, calculating options with cold precision. If someone was brazen enough to attempt entry while he was inside, they were either desperate or confident. Either way, they represented a direct escalation.

The door opened a crack, then stopped. A long pause followed, as if the intruder sensed something wasn't right. Nick could hear controlled breathing on the other side—not panicked, but cautious. Professional.

A decision crystallized in Nick's mind. Whoever was on the other side needed to learn that he wasn't the easy target they anticipated. This incursion demanded a response—one that would send a clear message without revealing the full extent of his abilities.

With deliberate calm, Nick channeled a thin stream of mana to his right hand, creating a subtle blue glow—just enough to be visible in the darkened room. He positioned himself where the intruder would see him immediately if the door opened further, his posture relaxed but alert, his eyes focused directly on the narrow opening.

""I wouldn't,"" Nick said, his voice pitched low and even, carrying just enough menace to be effective without seeming theatrical.

The door closed immediately. Soft footsteps retreated down the hallway at a carefully measured pace—not running, but definitely hurrying. The cadence suggested military training—heel-toe movement designed to minimize sound while maintaining mobility.

Nick remained motionless for a full minute before examining the lock, finding tiny scratch marks around the keyhole—evidence of amateur lockpicking. Not the work of a professional, but someone with basic training trying to be quiet rather than efficient.

*So they've moved from digital surveillance to physical intrusion,* Nick thought, running his fingers lightly over the damaged metal. *Interesting escalation.*

This was developing faster than he'd anticipated. First digital intrusion attempts, then surveillance, now physical breaches. The pattern suggested increasing desperation—someone needed information quickly and was willing to take greater risks to get it.

Nick checked his watch—nearly midnight. His meeting with Maggie was less than twelve hours away. As he prepared for bed, one question remained foremost in his mind: Who had just tried to enter his room, and what exactly were they looking for?

The answer, he suspected, would determine his next move in this increasingly dangerous game.

In the darkness of his room, Nick sat cross-legged on his bed, delving deeper into meditation than he had previously attempted. The attempted intrusion had made one thing clear—he needed to accelerate his mastery of mana if he was going to defend himself against whatever forces were arrayed against him.

The room was perfectly still, the only sounds his own measured breathing and the distant hum of the dorm's heating system. Moonlight filtered through the blinds, casting silver-blue stripes across the floor that seemed to resonate with the energy now flowing through his veins.

Four counts in. Hold for seven. Out for eight.

As his consciousness settled into the meditative state, Nick directed his focus inward, seeking the wellspring of energy he now knew existed within him. This time, instead of simply observing or making tentative attempts to channel it, he deliberately immersed himself in Arlize's memories of training.

The physical world around him seemed to fade, the dorm room dissolving like mist as his mind bridged the gap between worlds, between past and present, between separate consciousnesses now merging into something new.

A scene materialized in his mind's eye with perfect clarity, as if he were physically present:

Arlize knelt before Master Elian in a circular chamber hewn from living rock. Sunlight streamed through crystal skylights, fracturing into rainbow patterns across the stone floor. Runes carved into the walls glowed with soft amber light, creating an atmosphere of ancient power and profound silence. The air smelled of mountain herbs and the particular mineral tang of raw mana—a scent like ozone but somehow richer, more fundamental.

""The mistake most make,"" Master Elian said, his voice resonating with authority earned through decades of practice, ""is believing that aether is a tool to be wielded like a sword or a shield. This fundamentally misunderstands its nature.""

The old master's face was weathered like ancient parchment, but his eyes burned with inner vitality that belied his apparent age. His white beard flowed to his waist, moving slightly in currents of energy that normal vision couldn't detect.

Arlize's brow furrowed. ""Then what is it, Master?""

""It is the underlying current of existence itself. Not separate from you, but more fundamental than your physical form."" The old master extended his hand, palm upward. Blue light bloomed there, not emanating from his skin but seeming to exist both within and beyond it simultaneously. The energy didn't look placed upon his palm but rather as if reality itself had been peeled back to reveal what always existed beneath the surface.

""When you attempt to 'use' aether, you create separation between yourself and it. This separation causes resistance, which manifests as the pain and exhaustion you've experienced."" Master Elian closed his fingers, and the light vanished. ""Instead, you must recognize that you are not channeling something external, but expressing something that already exists within the deepest layers of your being.""

The memory shifted, showing techniques and exercises Arlize had practiced over years of training. Nick absorbed them with the accelerated learning capacity he'd discovered was part of his rebirth gifts, centuries of knowledge condensing into moments of pure understanding.

Applying what he'd learned, Nick shifted his perception. Instead of trying to gather or direct mana, he simply acknowledged its presence within him—allowing it to permeate every cell of his being without resistance. The sensation was like removing a dam from a river, allowing water to follow its natural course rather than forcing it through artificial channels.

The difference was immediate and profound. Blue light emerged not as a strained manifestation but as a natural expression of his state of being, radiating from his skin in gentle waves that pulsed in rhythm with his heartbeat. The energy didn't feel separate from him but rather like a deeper aspect of himself being expressed—as natural as breathing or thinking.

Nick extended his hand, palm upward, mirroring Master Elian's gesture from the memory. The mana responded effortlessly, gathering above his palm in a perfect sphere that contained swirling patterns like a miniature galaxy. Within the sphere, Nick could see complex geometries forming and dissolving—sacred patterns that seemed to represent fundamental aspects of reality itself.

No strain. No resistance. No pain.

The sphere held steady as Nick explored its properties, discovering that he could alter its density, size, and brightness through mere intention rather than forced concentration. It wasn't a creation separate from himself, but an extension of his consciousness given form.

When he finally released the manifestation, allowing the energy to reabsorb into his system, he felt invigorated rather than drained. The key difference was clear—working with the mana rather than trying to control it.

Nick lay back on his bed, processing the implications of this breakthrough. The mana wasn't just a weapon or a tool; it was an extension of his consciousness, as much a part of him as his thoughts or memories. And with this understanding came a profound shift in how he conceived of his own identity.

He was neither simply Nick nor merely Arlize, but something new—a consciousness that transcended both, integrating their experiences, memories, and abilities into something greater than the sum of its parts.

As he drifted toward sleep, Nick's mind turned to tomorrow's meeting with Maggie and the growing web of mysteries surrounding Callahan Industries. Whatever connection existed between neural interfaces, his rebirth, and the mana flowing through his veins, he was getting closer to understanding it.

And with understanding would come power—power to protect himself, power to uncover the truth, and ultimately, power to ensure that this second chance at life didn't end in another betrayal.

The blue energy pulsed once more beneath his skin before settling into dormancy, a silent promise of capabilities yet to be fully realized.

1l4hlga,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1l4hlga/should_i_get_divorced_parents_advising_yes/,Should I Get Divorced? Parents Advising Yes.,"Last month, I had a complete retinal detachment and went half blind. This week, my therapist urged me to get out of what she saw was an unsafe environment. I am back at my parents as my vision hopefully heals as a 41-year-old-man. I cannot drive until August at the earliest. 

I got married six years ago. My parents were not happy (I’m an only child). They thought my wife was an albatross. I traveled three days for work a week and spend weekends at home. I pay 70% of the expenses even though my wife makes $60k. My wife has ADHD and makes capricious decisions without involving me. I let this slide because I was on the road so much of the week at my old job. Now, I have ten cats in my house and 11 chickens in the backyard. 

My wife got a new job recently and is not helping with housework at all. When I asked for help, she has said that I don’t pitch in with the animals (only two of which I agreed to home). I have spent all of my weekends and summers off doing all the house maintenance and cleaning. A friend suggested I quit in January unless she we were working at the same time on the upkeep. Our Christmas decoration is half out and no laundry has been put away since January. We can’t enter one bedroom. 

Things came to a head when I came home from surgery. My wife was supposed to keep the bedroom sterile as I healed but left dishes piling up. I wasn’t supposed to be left alone because I couldn’t see well enough to even shower, but she would leave me for hours at a time. Some nights I would go 6-7 hours wjth nothing to eat but a protein bar. 

I have OCD (which I’m in treatment for) and asked her how the house looked since I couldn’t go downstairs. I also asked if she was taking the cat litter bags to the dumpster (she had a habit of dropping them out the window and letting them pile up). She said yes. 

Last weekend, my dad visited because her mother was supposed to come help and they ended up staying out all day and leaving me alone. When he came, he had to remove 27 kitchen garbage bags of litter from the yard. They had been there so long, the grass was dead. My wife could not answer why she was dishonest about this. She also hadn’t done dishes in a week to the point my dad couldn’t even wash his hands in our dual farmhouse sinks. 

After my dad left, my wife brought one of her chickens that had been injured by another hen into the bedroom suite’s bathroom. I reminded her it was supposed to be sterile. She said OK. The next morning, she told me she had put the chicken in a cage in our carpeted TV room where all my valuable movies and electronics are. I told her I wasn’t comfortable with that. She said I don’t care about living things. 

When I had a telehealth therapy session Monday, my therapist ended early and said I needed to leave immediately. The next day, she messaged me to see if I was safe. My dad got us a got a hotel in the city because I was not approved to travel to higher elevations until yesterday after a follow up with my surgeon. 

My wife does sweet things like buy me small presents or make me special coffee, but this recovery has made me wonder if she cares about me. 

She has long had a habit of sleeping until 2pm on days we plan to do housework and then going out for an item on a shopping trip that takes three hours. She’s always on her phone. 

Earlier this year, she was delinquent on a payment for a truck I had to consign for (she’s never had a credit score above 600 since we met). My score went down 100 points and a credit line was cut. She said it was a mistake and has not followed up on it for four months. I also found out recently that she’s one class short of graduating college though we were all under the impression she had when we threw her a party in 2023. I also found out last fall that she withheld from me that she was on a 30-day improvement plan at work. 

A week before my surgery (and a week after her sister had a baby), I told her that I was not comfortable bringing a child into this environment. She seemed hurt. The next day, I caught her going through my Apple Watch. She accused me of cheating because she found a message from a female I have worked with for years I had hired to do some work and a well-known online personality who was a guest at an event I ran for work. There was nothing flirtatious about these business relationships though both women are young and attractive. My wife has gained 50 pounds since we married and I have gained 70. I feel awful about my appearance. 

I don’t want to start over. But I can’t live in a house with ten cats and rooms I can’t even inhabit. My parents want me to divorce and say that what has happened to me this month is textbook abuse. I have no idea what to do. ",3,1749177514.0,Divorce,4,1.0,False

Monday morning arrived with the cool clarity that often followed rain. Through his half-open blinds, Nick watched the campus stirring to life—students trudging between buildings with coffee cups clutched like lifelines, professors striding purposefully across rain-dampened lawns that glistened emerald in the morning sun. The second week of classes was beginning, bringing with it new challenges and opportunities.

*What's the cosmic rule?* Nick thought wryly as he observed a freshman frantically sprinting toward the science building, papers flying from his unzipped backpack. *The universe always schedules your existential crisis for Monday morning.*

Nick rolled his shoulders, working out the lingering stiffness from yesterday's mana practice. The sensation was different from normal muscle fatigue—deeper, more pervasive, as if the exertion had reached beyond physical tissue into something more fundamental. It reminded him of how his muscles had felt after his first serious weight training session, but magnified and somehow more *essential*—as if he'd been exercising not just his body but the very fabric of his being.

He flexed his hands, feeling the energy dormant but accessible, like a calm lake beneath a thin layer of ice. The pathways that had opened during his training sessions remained, allowing mana to flow more freely through his system even at rest. He could sense it now without actively trying to manifest it—a cool current running alongside his bloodstream, ready to respond to his will.

A faint blue glow pulsed once beneath his skin before fading, the color briefly turning the veins in his wrist into luminous rivers. Nick smiled grimly. Each day, the connection to Arlize's abilities grew stronger, more integrated with his own consciousness. What had begun as random flashes of memory and instinct was evolving into something he could control, if only barely.

The integration wasn't just happening with the mana. Nick had noticed that his thoughts were becoming more structured, more strategic—Arlize's battlefield analysis merging seamlessly with his own academic approach. Where once he might have reacted emotionally to challenges, he now instinctively assessed threats and opportunities with cold precision.

*Not just becoming stronger,* he mused, *but becoming... more.*

He sat at his desk, methodically reviewing the security logs from Maggie's custom patch. The code scrolled across his screen in elegant lines that seemed almost familiar now, as if the programming language resonated with patterns he'd seen in Arlize's world. No further breach attempts had been detected overnight, but that did little to ease his suspicions. Whoever had tried to access his investment timeline was sophisticated enough to retreat and regroup.

""Who are you?"" Nick murmured, scrolling through the technical data. The timing of the hack attempt—so soon after someone had searched his room—suggested coordination rather than coincidence. And the connection to Callahan Industries seemed increasingly likely, especially after overhearing those graduate students discussing neural interface research.

His stomach growled, interrupting his analysis. The enhanced metabolism that came with wielding mana demanded more frequent refueling—another practical consideration he needed to address. He checked his watch—7:15 AM. Biology started at 8:00, leaving him just enough time for breakfast before class.

*Note to self: apparently becoming an interdimensional mage-warrior requires about 4,000 calories a day. Should've chosen a cheaper superpower.*

The dining hall buzzed with Monday morning energy—louder than usual as students exchanged weekend stories, many revolving around Friday night's Alpha Phi party. The cacophony of voices echoed off the high ceiling, creating a sound bath that Nick's enhanced senses could now parse into distinct conversations. The air carried a mixture of scents: freshly brewed coffee, maple syrup, the faint chemical tang of industrial cleaning products, and the particular musky perfume that seemed to be trendy among sophomore girls this semester.

Nick selected his usual protein-heavy breakfast—three eggs, turkey bacon, whole wheat toast, a banana, and a large coffee—and found a quiet corner table, positioning himself with his back to the wall, maintaining clear sightlines to both entrances. The habit was automatic now, a fusion of his own caution and Arlize's battlefield instincts.

As he ate, he subtly enhanced his hearing with a touch of mana, focusing on conversations that might yield useful intelligence. Most were mundane—complaints about assignments, weekend hookup stories, plans for upcoming parties. But a particular exchange at the next table caught his attention.

""—swear, it was like something out of a movie,"" a student at the next table was saying. ""Cops everywhere, ambulances, the whole deal.""

""All I know is Hendricks got his face smashed in,"" his companion replied. ""Kaplan too. Heard they're both still in the medical center.""

Nick tilted his head slightly, enhancing his eavesdropping without appearing to do so. He recognized the names immediately: Jason Hendricks and Tyler Kaplan, both wrestlers known for their eagerness to enforce the social hierarchy through intimidation. Each weighed over 220 pounds of mostly muscle, with reputations for brutal efficiency when ""handling problems"" for wealthier students.

""The crazy part,"" the first student continued, lowering his voice, ""is that they were paid to jump someone. Some freshman who never showed up.""

Nick's fork paused halfway to his mouth, his entire body suddenly alert despite his outwardly casual demeanor.

""For real?"" his friend asked, leaning forward.

""Yeah, they had an arrangement to 'teach a lesson' to a specific freshman. But the guy never showed, so they got bored and started messing with others instead. That's how the whole brawl kicked off.""

Nick carefully maintained his neutral expression, though inside, cold satisfaction bloomed like frost crystals spreading across glass. In his previous life, he'd accepted Matt's invitation to that party, eager to cement his social position. The night had ended with him in the hospital, beaten so severely by Hendricks, Kaplan, and their friends that he'd missed two months of classes. Three broken ribs, a fractured orbital bone, a concussion, and internal bruising that had left him urinating blood for days.

His grades had tanked, his confidence shattered, and he'd found himself utterly dependent on Matt and Sarah—exactly as they'd planned. They'd visited him daily in the hospital, bringing notes, helping with assignments, positioning themselves as his only support system while isolating him from other potential friendships.

This time, the trap had sprung empty.

A slight smile curved Nick's lips as he finished his meal, savoring both the food and the knowledge that he'd dodged the first major attack of his reborn timeline. His entire perspective had shifted since his rebirth with Arlize's memories. What once seemed like random college drama now revealed itself as deliberate, calculated moves in a game with stakes far higher than social standing.

*They wanted to break my body to control my mind,* Nick thought, his mana responding to the spike of cold anger by tracing faint blue lines beneath the skin of his hands. He quickly suppressed the reaction, willing the energy back to dormancy. *This time, I'm the one several moves ahead.*

 

Nick made his way to the science building, his mind working through possibilities. The redbrick structure loomed ahead, morning light reflecting off its massive windows like a thousand watchful eyes. Students streamed through its arched entrance, backpacks heavy with laptops and textbooks, expressions ranging from Monday morning dread to caffeinated determination.

If Matt had indeed paid Hendricks and Kaplan to attack him—and Nick had little doubt of this—then the motivation went beyond simple hazing. The level of violence in his previous life had been extreme, designed to incapacitate rather than merely intimidate.

*Why?* The question nagged at him. *What does Matt gain from isolating me and keeping me dependent?*

The answer remained elusive, but Nick suspected it connected to Callahan Industries in some way. Something about Nick himself posed a threat. He just didn't know what, and that would require further investigation.

The Biology classroom was already half-full when Nick arrived. The space smelled of formaldehyde and dry-erase markers, with underlying notes of coffee and the particular chemical scent of hand sanitizer that had become ubiquitous in academic settings. He took his usual seat, positioning his materials with military precision—notebook centered, two black pens and one blue arranged parallel to the right, tablet and textbook stacked neatly to the left.

Since his mana breakthrough, Nick found himself increasingly drawn to understanding how the human body functioned at a cellular level—knowledge that might help him comprehend and control his new power. What Professor Godrudson had described as theoretical possibilities, he was experiencing firsthand. The scientific framework might provide the structure he needed to systematize what was currently intuitive and unpredictable.

Professor Godrudson swept in precisely at 8:00, cutting an impressive figure that commanded immediate attention. Her silver-streaked black hair was pulled back in a tight bun, revealing sharp cheekbones and penetrating hazel eyes. Though she couldn't be older than fifty, fine lines around her eyes hinted at countless hours peering through microscopes. Her movements were economical and purposeful, each gesture precise as a surgeon's.

""Good morning, everyone,"" she began, her voice carrying effortlessly to the back row. ""Today we're delving into cellular respiration and energy production in human tissues. Specifically, how different cellular structures respond to physical and environmental stressors.""

She activated the projection system, bringing up a detailed diagram of mitochondria. The image showed cross-sections of the organelle's structure, with intricate folded membranes that reminded Nick of the patterns mana formed when flowing through his own body.

""The fundamental question we're addressing is this: How does the human body maintain homeostasis while adapting to changing demands? How do our cells know when to conserve energy and when to expend it?""

Nick's attention sharpened. This was exactly the knowledge he needed to understand what was happening within his own body when he channeled mana. The similarities between scientific descriptions of cellular energy transport and his experiences with mana couldn't be coincidental.

For the next two hours, she guided them through the essentials of cellular respiration and energy adaptation systems. Nick absorbed the material with unprecedented focus, finding it clicking into place with startling clarity—as if his mind had been prewired to understand these biological systems.

When she described how cells could dramatically increase energy production under stress, Nick found himself unconsciously flexing his hand, remembering the sensation of blue energy flowing through his veins. Each scientific principle she outlined seemed to parallel his experiences with mana in ways too precise to be coincidental.

*The Arcadian System isn't magic,* Nick realized with growing excitement. *It's biology and physics operating at levels current science is only beginning to understand. The principles are the same, just applied differently.*

When class ended, most students filed out quickly. Nick, however, remained seated, organizing his notes until Professor Godrudson was alone at her desk.

""Professor?"" Nick approached. ""I was hoping I could ask you some follow-up questions about cellular adaptation to stress.""

Professor Godrudson looked up from her tablet, those penetrating eyes focusing on him with intense assessment. For a moment, Nick felt as if she could see through his casual student facade to the complex reality beneath.

""Mr. Valiente, correct? What specifically caught your interest?""

""I'm particularly curious about muscular adaptation at the cellular level,"" Nick said. ""You mentioned that muscle tissue can undergo significant structural changes in response to specific stressors. I wondered if you could elaborate on the mechanisms involved.""

A flicker of genuine interest crossed Professor Godrudson's face. ""That's a surprisingly sophisticated question,"" she said, closing her tablet case. ""Most students at your level are still struggling to memorize the basic steps of glycolysis.""

She gestured to a chair near her desk. ""Take a seat, Mr. Valiente. I have twenty minutes before my next commitment.""

Nick settled into the chair, giving her his full attention. This wasn't just academic curiosity—understanding these processes might be the key to controlling the mana that now flowed through his system.

""Muscular adaptation functions through several interconnected mechanisms,"" Professor Godrudson began. She pulled out a blank sheet and sketched a diagram showing how mechanical stress creates microtears in muscle fibers, triggering repair processes and growth.

As she drew, Nick noticed something unusual through his mana-enhanced perception—a faint electromagnetic signature emanating from Professor Godrudson that differed from other people he'd observed. Not the controlled field he'd sensed from Jordan or the military student, but something more integrated, more natural, as if her cellular energy operated at a slightly different frequency than most humans.

""When muscles are stressed,"" she continued, adding pathways to her diagram, ""they release signaling proteins that activate dormant stem cells. These cells then repair and strengthen the tissue."" She explained how different types of stress produce different adaptations, with high-intensity training developing different pathways than endurance work.

The diagram she created reminded Nick eerily of the mana channels he'd observed in his own body during meditation—branching pathways that carried energy to specific areas based on intention and need. The scientific terminology was different, but the underlying principles seemed remarkably similar.

""And what about recovery mechanisms?"" Nick asked. ""I'm curious about how the body prioritizes energy allocation during healing.""

Professor Godrudson nodded approvingly. ""The body employs a sophisticated triage system. When tissue is damaged, inflammatory responses direct energy and resources to the affected areas. The more frequently a specific stress is encountered, the more efficient the recovery pathway becomes. This is why consistent training produces better results than sporadic efforts.""

Nick studied the diagram intently. ""So theoretically, if someone could control these cellular signaling pathways directly, they could accelerate recovery significantly?""

""In theory, yes,"" Professor Godrudson replied thoughtfully. ""Some recent studies have shown promising results with targeted electrical stimulation of specific pathways. But we're years away from practical applications. The human body has redundant systems and safeguards that make performance enhancement challenging.""

*Not for me,* Nick thought, remembering how the mana had accelerated his recovery after intense training sessions. What Professor Godrudson described as theoretically possible, he was already experiencing firsthand.

""One more question,"" Nick said. ""You mentioned that extreme stress can trigger unusual cellular responses. Could you elaborate on that?""

Something flickered in Professor Godrudson's eyes—a moment of hesitation, as if she were deciding how much to reveal. The electromagnetic field around her briefly intensified, like a radio signal gaining strength.

""In extreme situations—life-threatening conditions—the human body can access reserve capacities that remain dormant under normal circumstances. We've documented cases of individuals displaying strength or endurance far beyond their normal capabilities.""

""Hysterical strength,"" Nick offered.

""Precisely. Most scientists attribute this to a combination of adrenaline release and the temporary overriding of the body's normal protective limitations."" She gathered her papers, glancing at the clock. ""What's particularly interesting are the rare individuals who can access these reserve capacities voluntarily through meditation or specialized training.""

Her voice had dropped slightly on this last point, taking on a quality that suggested personal knowledge rather than academic reference. Nick felt a surge of excitement. This aligned perfectly with what he'd experienced during his mana manifestation.

""Thank you, Professor. This has been incredibly helpful,"" Nick said sincerely.

Professor Godrudson studied him for a moment, then tapped her pen against the desk three times—a habitual gesture Nick had noticed during her lectures when she was considering something significant.

""I'm pleased to see such interest, Mr. Valiente,"" she replied, slipping the diagram into a folder and extending it to him. ""My own work began with similar questions during my undergraduate years. I was curious about physical adaptation limits after my brother—"" She stopped abruptly, the personal revelation seeming to surprise even herself. Her electromagnetic signature fluctuated noticeably, like a ripple spreading across a pond. She cleared her throat, professional demeanor returning instantly. ""If you're serious about pursuing this, I have some journal articles you might find valuable. My office hours are Wednesdays from 3:00 to 4:30.""

This glimpse of the professor's personal motivation was unexpected. Nick filed it away—another data point suggesting that her interest in cellular adaptation might stem from personal roots.

""I'll definitely stop by,"" Nick promised, gathering his materials.

As he left the biology building, Nick's mind raced with new possibilities. If the blue energy somehow enhanced or accelerated natural biological processes, he might be able to develop control techniques based on scientific principles rather than relying solely on Arlize's intuitive approaches.

*Bridging science and the Arcadian System,* he thought, feeling the mana respond subtly to his excitement. *That's the key to mastering this power.*

 

Nick checked his watch—10:45 AM. He had less than four hours before Calculus. Enough time to return to his dorm, complete his bio assignment, and test whether Jordan would take the opportunity to search his room again.

The walk back was uneventful, though Nick noticed the military-postured student from his Statistics class walking in the opposite direction, clearly tracking his movements despite pretending to be absorbed in a textbook. The man's posture was perfect—spine straight, shoulders balanced, steps measured and precise—but his eyes gave him away, flicking briefly toward Nick then away with practiced casualness.

*Amateur,* Nick thought, deliberately taking an alternate path to see if the man would adjust his route. *First rule of surveillance: don't look directly at your target unless you have to.*

As predicted, the military student altered course slightly to maintain line of sight, confirming Nick's suspicion that he was the object of observation rather than someone else.

As he crossed the quad, Nick noticed something unusual—a maintenance worker installing what appeared to be a new security camera at his dorm building entrance. The timing seemed odd; security upgrades typically happened during breaks when fewer students were around to be inconvenienced. The worker wore standard university coveralls, but his movements had a practiced efficiency that seemed out of place for routine campus staff.

With his enhanced perception, Nick could detect a faint electronic signature emanating from the camera that didn't match standard security equipment. The device appeared to be transmitting on frequencies outside normal campus security protocols. Not necessarily sinister, but definitely unusual.

*First tailing, now electronic surveillance,* Nick noted, maintaining his casual pace while mentally mapping all cameras along his daily routes. *Someone's investing significant resources to watch me.*

His dorm room appeared untouched when he entered, but Nick performed a quick sweep anyway, checking the subtle markers he'd left that morning—a strand of hair across his desk drawer, the angle of his laptop, the folded edge of his bedspread. Nothing had been disturbed.

Satisfied, Nick decided to test Professor Godrudson's theories and attempt to consciously control his mana. He locked his door, settled into a cross-legged position on the floor, and focused inward, seeking that internal reservoir of energy.

""The body knows how to optimize itself,"" he murmured. ""It's just a matter of overriding the limiting systems.""

Borrowing concepts from Professor Godrudson's lecture, Nick visualized his cellular structure—mitochondria producing energy, proteins carrying signals between tissues, neural pathways conducting electrical impulses. Rather than trying to force the mana to manifest, he imagined removing the natural limiters that prevented cellular systems from operating at maximum capacity.

He concentrated on his right hand, imagining the flow of energy from his core outward through established pathways—like rivers following natural channels rather than water forced through artificial conduits. For several minutes, nothing happened.

Then—a tingle. A faint warmth spreading through his palm, building slowly until it became a distinct sensation, different from normal body heat. The feeling reminded him of pins and needles but pleasant rather than uncomfortable, like champagne bubbles fizzing beneath his skin.

Nick opened his eyes, breath catching at the sight: a faint blue luminescence outlining his fingers, not as intense as in the gym, but definitely under his conscious control. The light followed the patterns of his capillaries and nerve pathways, creating an effect like a living circuit diagram.

""It's working,"" he whispered, turning his hand to examine the glow from different angles. The blue light responded to his thoughts, brightening when he concentrated on specific areas, dimming when his attention wavered.

*This isn't about forcing manifestation,* he realized. *It's about conscious access to systems that already exist.*

Emboldened by this success, Nick recalled the sphere of energy he'd managed to form briefly during his gym session. That attempt had ended with a nosebleed and exhaustion—a clear warning that he'd pushed too far too quickly. This time, he would be more methodical.

He extended his index finger, focusing on channeling a thin stream of mana to its tip. The blue energy responded, coalescing into a small point of light at his fingertip—a perfect azure pinpoint that glowed with steady intensity.

*Start small,* he reminded himself. *Build gradually.*

Nick traced a simple pattern in the air—a circle, then a line through its center. The mana followed his movement, leaving a faint blue afterimage that lingered for several seconds before fading. The pattern hung in the air like ghostly calligraphy, glowing with soft internal light that cast subtle shadows across his face.

*Like writing with light,* he thought, a surge of excitement coursing through him. He tried again, this time attempting to maintain the pattern longer by continuously feeding energy into it.

The circle of light held steady for nearly ten seconds before Nick felt the first warning sign—a slight pressure behind his eyes, the precursor to the pain he'd experienced in the gym. The sensation wasn't painful yet, but he recognized it as his body's warning system activating.

He immediately ceased channeling, watching as the blue light dissipated like mist in morning sun. No nosebleed this time, just a mild fatigue that suggested he'd found a sustainable limit for his current level of control.

*Progress,* he thought with satisfaction. *Measurable, controlled progress.*

Before he could attempt another experiment, his phone vibrated with an incoming notification. The sudden interruption broke his concentration, and the last wisps of mana dissipated instantly at the sound. Nick steadied himself against the desk, checking the screen—a reminder for lunch. He'd completely lost track of time during his practice session.

As he pulled out his desk chair to sit down and begin his bio homework, a strange dissonance washed over him. The mundane reality of college assignments seemed increasingly surreal against the backdrop of awakening mana abilities and corporate conspiracies. Was he still Nick Valiente with access to Arlize's memories? Or was he becoming something else entirely—a hybrid consciousness with capabilities neither of his component selves had possessed alone?

""Who am I becoming?"" he murmured, staring at his reflection in the laptop screen. The face was familiar—his own—but sometimes he caught glimpses of someone else in his expressions, in the calculating coldness that occasionally filled his eyes. It was necessary, he reminded himself. The strategic detachment, the constant vigilance—all essential for survival against opponents who sought to control or destroy him.

But would the Nick from before recognize what and who he was becoming?

Nick stared at his phone, the notification glowing in the darkness: ‘Unauthorized access attempt detected on encrypted file: NK\_TS\_INV.dat.’

The text pulsed against the black background, matching his racing heartbeat. His investment timeline. Someone had tried to access his market shift foreknowledge—knowledge that promised his future independence.

*Well, that escalated quickly,* Nick thought, bitter amusement mixing with concern. *One week back at college and he had corporate spies on his tail. Most freshmen just worry about finding the dining hall.*

A chill ran through him. The timing was too precise to be coincidence. First, someone searched his room—leaving that trace of cologne—and now a breach attempt, both following his chat about Callahan Industries.

Nick sat up, fully alert despite the hour. The blue glow from his phone cast eerie shadows across his face, reminiscent of the mana manifestation he’d experienced that morning. His first instinct was to use the library’s computer lab to trace the breach, but at 1:17 AM, it was closed.

""Damn it,"" he muttered, mapping out possibilities with tactical precision. The attempt left digital traces, but they were fading quickly. The Arcadian System might help, but he couldn’t interface it with modern tech.

He closed his eyes, focusing on mana flowing through him. *Could he use it to enhance his phone’s security?* A tingling warmth spread through his fingertips, but nothing substantial happened. The connection was there, but too tenuous for complex actions.

*Like trying to perform surgery with oven mitts,* he thought in frustration. The power’s there, but the control isn’t.e

He needed help. Specialized expertise.

Maggie Zhang. The engineering prodigy with legendary, discreet hacking skills on campus. In his previous life, Nick knew her only by reputation—a ghost in the digital realm who could access almost any system for a price. He hadn’t planned to approach her so soon, but circumstances had forced his hand. He had no choice.

Nick tapped methodically on his phone, pulling up her student profile. Her ID photo showed a serious-faced Asian woman with piercing, intelligent eyes. Nothing in her profile hinted at her underground talents, but that was expected. He needed her help before whoever was hunting him made their next move.

Tomorrow. First thing.

He secured what he could. Nick activated extra encryption on sensitive files, creating decoys to alert him if those files were accessed. It wasn't perfect but would serve as an early warning.

He channeled a thin stream of mana into his device, similar to interfacing with the training room clock. The energy responded sluggishly without his combat forms, but a faint blue shimmer outlined the phone, and the battery jumped from 43% to 97%.

Interesting, Nick thought; the Arcadian System affects electronics even without intent. Something to explore further.

Sleep came reluctantly, his mind racing with possibilities. Who was testing his defenses? Jordan? The military student? Someone connected to Matt's family? Or an unknown player?

As he drifted off, Nick's last thought was that the game had escalated sooner than expected. His enemies were moving, and he needed to accelerate his plans.

Saturday morning brought gray skies and drizzle matching Nick's mood. Raindrops tapped his window, each briefly a tiny prism before sliding down. He'd slept restlessly, checking security alerts throughout the night, but no breaches had occurred. ""At least the weather fits,"" Nick thought, eyeing the gloomy campus. The ominous rain seemed fitting for corporate espionage and magical manifestations.

After a quick workout designed to avoid triggering the blue energy, Nick showered and headed to the tech building. Maggie usually worked in the advanced engineering lab on Saturday mornings when most students were recovering from Friday night.

The tech building, smelling of electronics and coffee, was nearly empty except for a few dedicated grad students and occasional professors. The corridors hummed with equipment while rain pattered against large windows. Each room buzzed with its own electromagnetic signature that Nick's enhanced senses could detect—servers whirring, oscilloscopes pulsing, 3D printers methodically building layer upon layer.

On the third floor, where specialized labs were housed, Nick's footsteps echoed in the silence. The sensation of surrounding technology overwhelmed his awakened perception. He felt the building's systems like a living organism—power flowing through its veins, data streaming along neural pathways, and wireless signals glowing like constellations to his mana-enhanced awareness.

The advanced engineering lab door was open. Nick paused, scanning the room. Workstations lined the walls, mostly empty. The air smelled of solder, electronics, coffee, and circuit board cleaner. At the far end, a figure hunched over a custom setup, surrounded by disassembled electronics. Dark hair in a messy bun, oversized hoodie, intense focus—this had to be Maggie Zhang.

Nick approached carefully, noting details like Arlize assessing an ally. Three monitors displayed scrolling code, a soldering iron cooled beside a circuit board, and empty energy drink cans formed a pyramid—a caffeine altar to late-night coding.

As he drew closer, he noticed Maggie wearing an earpiece, speaking quietly over the hum of equipment.

""Access point secured. Starting file transfer. Estimated completion: four minutes.""

Nick froze, recognizing the language of a live hack. He'd stumbled into one of her operations. Interrupting might make her bolt—or worse, think he was security and destroy evidence.

*Better to wait.*

He retreated to a workstation near the door, pretending to work on his tablet while keeping Maggie in view. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, her expression intense. Blue light from the monitors reflected in her eyes, giving her an almost supernatural glow.

""Download complete. Exiting system. No trace detected."" She leaned back, rolling her shoulders. ""Files secured. Payment as discussed.""

She removed the earpiece, shut down programs with practiced efficiency, and stretched with a satisfied sigh.

Nick approached as she closed the final application.

""Impressive work,"" he said, keeping his voice low. ""Though using the university network for private security consultations might raise some eyebrows.""

Maggie reacted with immediate precision. She turned, closed her laptop, and produced a taser from her hoodie pocket with smooth, economical movements.

""Campus security?"" she asked, eyes calculating. The taser crackled with power, its energy signature visible to Nick's enhanced senses as a faint blue-white aura pulsing around the device, ready to strike.

""Just another student,"" Nick replied calmly, showing empty hands. ""One with an appreciation for digital skills and discretion.""

She studied his face, the taser still aimed. Recognition flickered in her eyes, but her defensive posture remained rigid.

""Wait. You're Nick Valiente,"" she said, eyes narrowing. ""Freshman. Business major. Suddenly top of your classes after being average in high school.""

Nick raised an eyebrow, impressed. ""You've done your homework.""

""I notice unusual patterns,"" she replied with an unplaceable accent. ""You triggered several, including visiting this building yesterday when you don't have a class here. You were watching me.""

She was more observant than he expected. Another miscalculation on his part.

*Note to self: when stalking tech geniuses, be less obvious*, Nick thought wryly.

""I need help,"" Nick admitted, opting for partial honesty. ""Someone tried to breach my encrypted files last night. I need to know who, and I need better security.""

""Why me? There are plenty of computer science students.""

""Because you're not just a student. You're the best. And I'll pay for the best.""

A flicker of interest crossed her face, quickly masked. ""Why should I risk my scholarship for a stranger?""

""Because whatever you were doing for your other client wasn't exactly approved research,"" Nick countered confidently. ""And I can offer more than money.""

She waited, guarded but curious. The taser lowered slightly.

""Information,"" Nick continued. ""About Nex Gen Virtual Technologies and their neural interface developments. Info that's not public yet.""

Her fingers tightened on the taser, its electrical field pulsing visibly to Nick's mana-enhanced vision.

""What do you know about neural interfaces?"" Her voice sharpened, losing its casual edge. Nick saw something more than professional curiosity in her eyes—an intensity that suggested deeper stakes, perhaps personal pain or fierce determination.

""Enough to know they'll revolutionize computing in two years,"" Nick replied. ""Enough to know certain companies want to keep early research quiet. Companies with resources to erase not just data, but entire research programs overnight.""

Maggie's expression remained neutral, but Nick caught a subtle shift in her posture. The air around her crackled with tension—not fear, but tightly controlled anger.

""My brother worked on early prototypes before his lab lost funding,"" she said, her words measured but full of raw emotion. ""The technology vanished overnight. Records erased. His research confiscated."" Her jaw tightened. ""So yes, I'm familiar with how these companies operate.""

The taser lowered further. ""How do you know that?""

""That's part of what I'm protecting,"" Nick replied. ""Help me upgrade my defenses and find out who's breaching my security, and I'll share what I know.""

Maggie wasn't just a skilled hacker—she had personal reasons to be interested in neural interface technology. Allies are more reliable when their motivations align with yours.

*Too convenient*, Nick thought. *The expertise I need, combined with personal motivation. Coincidence, or deliberate?*

Maggie stayed silent, weighing her options. The rain intensified, creating a rhythmic backdrop. Finally, she tucked the taser into her hoodie pocket.

""Tuesday. Four PM. Engineering lab C,"" she said, naming a smaller, private lab. ""Bring your laptop and the device that got the breach alert."" Her eyes hardened. ""And Valiente? If this is a setup, you'll regret it more than I will.""

Her threat wasn't empty bravado—her tone carried genuine weight.

""Fair enough."" Nick stood. ""Thank you for your time.""

As he turned to leave, Maggie's voice stopped him. ""One question: What file were they trying to access?""

""Investment data,"" Nick answered, truthful but omitting key details. ""Market predictions.""

Maggie's lips curved in a smile that didn't reach her eyes. ""Not what I expected. Most students your age get breached for less interesting reasons."" She turned back to her work. ""Tuesday. Don't be late.""

Nick left the lab, mind racing. The interaction had gone better than he'd hoped, though not as planned. He'd secured her help but revealed more than intended. Maggie Zhang was sharper than expected—more observant and cautious than he'd anticipated.

Another variable to track.

Saturday afternoon stretched before him, both liberating and dangerous. The rain transformed the campus into a watercolor of gray buildings and glistening pathways. Nick watched students dash through the downpour, weekend freedom etched across their faces. He recognized the pattern well—how discipline gave way to parties and social drama. He wouldn't make that mistake again. Wasted hours had cost him too much in his previous life.

*Funny how getting stabbed to death really improves your time management skills*, he thought as he watched raindrops race down his dorm window.

*Not this time.*

After a quick lunch in the empty dining hall, Nick returned to his dorm, locking the door behind him. His room remained untouched since morning, no sign of visitors.

Jordan's door across the hall stayed closed—he'd mentioned a ""family thing,"" but Nick wondered if that was actually true.

With Tuesday's meeting with Maggie approaching, Nick decided to explore another avenue. He opened his laptop and navigated to cybersecurity tutorials he'd bookmarked. If someone was targeting his digital security, he needed to understand the battlefield.

""Know your enemy, know yourself,"" he murmured, recalling one of Arlize's favorite maxims. ""In the river of knowledge, be the current, not the stone.""

The tutorials began with the basics, but Nick absorbed the information rapidly. Complex encryption protocols, network security frameworks, penetration testing methodologies—concepts that should have taken weeks clicked into place within hours.

As he read, Nick noticed something strange. Text shimmered with faint blue highlights—key concepts illuminated by his unconscious manipulation of mana. It was as if the Arcadian System helped him organize and prioritize information. By evening, Nick had completed tutorials that should have taken forty hours, yet he understood everything perfectly.

This went beyond his natural aptitude or Arlize's strategic thinking. It felt like his mind had been rewired for rapid learning. When he closed his eyes, he visualized concepts as 3D structures, examining each detail with crystal clarity.

Another gift from his merged existence?

Nick closed his laptop, pondering the implications. If he could learn this quickly, his potential growth far exceeded expectations. But it raised questions about his consciousness during rebirth. Was he accessing Arlize's capacity for rapid learning, or was this something deeper—a fundamental transformation?

His thoughts drifted to the blue energy he'd manifested during training. Could there be a connection with his enhanced learning? Only one way to find out.

Nick checked his watch—7:30 PM. The campus gym would be nearly empty on a drizzly Saturday evening. Perfect for experimenting with Arlize's abilities.

The athletic complex was as deserted as Nick hoped, with just a few student employees manning the front desk. The facility smelled of chlorine, cleaning products, and the familiar aroma of workout spaces—rubber, metal, and lingering sweat.

He returned to the same training room as yesterday, finding it empty. The space felt different in the evening—shadows deeper, light more intimate. Rain streaked the high windows, transforming outdoor floodlights into a soft, diffused glow.

Locking the door, Nick moved to the center of the mat, steadied his breathing, and began.

This time, he didn't jump into combat sequences. Instead, he started with the meditative forms Arlize practiced before battles—slow, deliberate movements harmonizing body and mind, transforming the warrior into a conduit for something beyond physical strength.

Each position flowed into the next with liquid precision. Palm up, palm down. Weight shifting from front to back foot. Arms extending, then circling inward. Breathing synchronized with movement—four counts in, hold for seven, out for eight.

Nick felt the mana stirring, responding to the deliberate patterns, flowing through pathways in his body like luminous rivers. An hour passed, then two. Sweat soaked his t-shirt, muscles burning from holding positions. Still, no blue glow appeared.

Frustration crept in. Maybe yesterday was a fluke, Nick thought, like trying to force sleep when your mind refuses to quiet down.

""One more sequence,"" he muttered, centering his stance. He reached deeper into Arlize's memories, beyond training forms, to Arlize's first lessons from Master Elian.

A young Arlize stood in a mountain sanctuary, sunlight casting dappled patterns across the stone floor. Master Elian circled him, voice low and resonant.

""The body is a vessel. Power flows from harmony, not force,"" Elian said.

""I don't understand, Master,"" Arlize replied.

Master Elian's face creased with patience. ""You seek control. Instead, become a conduit. Invite power to flow through you.""

The instruction shifted Nick's understanding. He'd been trying to force manifestation all along. Nick settled into a simple posture, breathing deeply, focusing on opening himself to what already existed within and around him.

Something shifted in his perception. The training room faded at the edges as his consciousness expanded. He felt a subtle vibration, an energy permeating everything—the air, the floor, his own cells.

The world dissolved, and another battlefield took shape:

Arlize, a recruit not yet twenty, separated from his unit during his first combat. The air reeked of smoke and iron, heavy with the scent of violence. Enemy soldiers emerged through the mist, six against one. Their armor gleamed dully, weapons ready. His training sword felt inadequate, his armor too heavy, his legs weak with fear.

""I'm going to die here,"" he thought, gripping his sword with trembling hands.

Time slowed. In that vulnerable moment, Arlize felt something unlock—a reservoir of energy. It wasn't desperation but a calm connection to something vast and ancient.

The mist sparkled with light, responding to the energy flowing through him. Fear dissolved, replaced by perfect clarity. As the first attacker charged, Arlize moved instinctively. Blue light traced his movements, extending his blade, strengthening his strikes, and quickening his reflexes.

When his commander found him, Arlize stood unharmed amid six fallen enemies, blue light still shimmering around his hands, his expression one of pure wonder.

""How?"" his commander asked, staring at the azure glow.

""I don't know,"" Arlize answered, amazed at his own power.

Nick gasped as the vision faded, finding himself on his knees on the training mat. His body hummed with energy, blue luminescence outlining his form, casting the entire room in ethereal light.

Unlike yesterday's brief flash, this manifestation held steady with his breathing. As he exhaled, the glow intensified; as he inhaled, it stabilized. The energy wasn't just visible—it altered the air around him, creating a pressure that raised the hairs on his skin and made dust motes dance in strange, deliberate patterns.

""Not magic,"" Nick whispered, echoing Arlize's words. ""Something far older.""

He watched the energy flow like liquid light across his fingers, feeling it as a natural extension of himself, a dormant capacity finally awakened. The blue light refracted into complex patterns—sacred geometry formed of pure energy.

Nick focused, directing the energy to his right hand. The blue light gathered into his palm, forming a pulsing sphere—neither solid nor liquid, vibrating like a heat mirage above desert sand.

The sphere pulsed with his will, beautiful and terrifying, containing complex, elegant data structures. It wasn't just energy; it was organized information.

He tried to expand it, pushing in more energy. The sphere grew brighter and more complex. For a moment, Nick felt omnipotent, connected to something vast and ancient that flowed through all things.

Then pain shot through him, burning up his arm and exploding behind his eyes. The sphere dissolved as Nick doubled over, gasping. His vision swam, and blood trickled from his nose, sizzling where it hit the mat.

""Limits,"" he muttered, wiping the blood away. ""Even Arlize had limits.""

He recalled Arlize collapsing after a battle, bedridden from channeling too much aether. The body was merely a vessel, vulnerable to pressure. Power always demanded a toll.

Nick made a mental note to practice small manifestations first, building capacity gradually. Collapsing from magical exhaustion at a critical moment was the last thing he needed.

The sight before him was both exhilarating and terrifying, defying all physical laws he'd known. His connection to Arlize clearly went beyond shared memories.

As realization dawned, Nick's concentration wavered, and the glow receded into his skin. Exhaustion hit him suddenly, as if he'd run a marathon. His limbs felt leaden, his mind foggy.

He needed to understand the implications. If he could manifest Arlize's abilities, what were the limits? What were the costs? Most importantly, how could he control it reliably?

So many questions, he thought as he struggled to his feet. But now he knew it wasn't a fluke. The Arcadian System worked here and was becoming more accessible with practice.

Nick dragged himself back to his dorm, barely remembering to shower before collapsing into bed. The hot water revived him slightly, but the fatigue remained, bone-deep. It felt like he'd been running a marathon while solving complex equations simultaneously.

His last conscious thought was to find a better term for the energy. ""Blue glow"" seemed inadequate. Mana surfaced from his combined consciousness. In Arlize's world, it was aether, but mana fit better here—a bridge between worlds, between science and something beyond comprehension.

As Nick drifted into sleep, blue light flickered briefly beneath his skin before fading, the energy pathways dormant until needed again.

Sunday morning—Nick's only day to sleep past sunrise. His body demanded recovery after last night's breakthrough. When he finally opened his eyes, the digital clock read 9:47 AM. The sunlight streaming through the blinds told him the rain had passed.

He lay still, drained but intact, muscles aching from unfamiliar exertion. Mentally, though, he felt sharper, like a computer after defragmentation.

His phone vibrated. An unknown number. Nick hesitated, then answered.

""Valiente,"" Maggie's voice cut through the silence. ""I've analyzed the university's security protocols. Tuesday's too long to wait. Whoever accessed your files used advanced methods.""

Nick sat up, instantly alert. ""You've looked into it already?""

""You presented an interesting problem. I get bored easily."" Her tone remained matter-of-fact. ""I can't meet until Tuesday—I'm off-campus—but secure your system with this.""

His phone chimed with a file.

""It's a custom security patch,"" Maggie continued. ""Install it exactly as instructed. It won't stop a determined professional, but it will buy you time and log further attempts.""

Nick studied the code, impressed by its efficiency and creative approach.

""Thank you,"" Nick said, surprised by her initiative.

""Don't thank me yet. We still don't know who's targeting you or why. What's in those market predictions worth this interest?""

Nick chose his words carefully. ""Connections between emerging technologies and companies poised to benefit. Nothing illegal, just well-researched forecasting.""

""Hmm."" Maggie sounded skeptical but didn't press. ""Install the patch. I'll see you Tuesday.""

The call ended. Nick followed her instructions, installing the patch. It was more sophisticated than commercial software. Maggie's skills clearly lived up to her reputation.

Nick finished the installation and decided to test a thin stream of mana on Maggie's code. To his surprise, the blue energy enhanced her security architecture, resonating with the Arcadian System's patterns. Her code briefly glowed with azure light before seamlessly integrating into the system.

Fascinating, Nick thought. Could Maggie have unknowingly intuited Arcadian principles?

With his digital security boosted, Nick prepared to study with Jordan. They planned to meet at noon in the library for Monday's calculus quiz.

Nick grabbed his backpack and knocked on Jordan's door but got no answer. He checked his phone—no cancellation messages. After leaving a note, he headed to the library alone.

The library's quiet atmosphere provided the perfect conditions for reviewing. Sunlight illuminated dancing dust motes, and the familiar scent of books and polish created a calming environment after yesterday's intense experience.

He claimed a study room and spread out his materials. As he worked through problems, his mind drifted to yesterday's mana breakthrough.

What practical applications could this lead to? Enhanced strength and speed seemed obvious, as Arlize demonstrated on the battlefield. But the mana's interaction with Maggie's code hinted at revolutionary possibilities in information processing and cybersecurity.

Could I create mana-enhanced encryption? Nick wondered while tackling a complex integral. Something beyond conventional computing, unbreakable by traditional methods. The implications would be enormous.

The study room door swung open, breaking Nick's concentration. Jordan stood there, slightly out of breath, his usual casual demeanor replaced by tension—elevated heart rate, dilated pupils, and the unmistakable scent of adrenaline.

""Sorry I'm late, man,"" he said, dropping his backpack. ""Got caught up with some stuff.""

Nick noticed Jordan's bruised knuckles—recent injuries from impact with something hard. The bluish tint suggested they were 24 to 36 hours old.

""No problem,"" Nick replied. ""Just going through the integration techniques from Wednesday.""

*Where's the coffee you promised, Jordan?* Nick sighed internally.

Jordan sat down, wincing slightly as he flexed his hands. ""Great. I need to review those.""

Nick pushed a worksheet across the table. ""So how was Alpha Phi? Must have been quite the party.""

Nick hadn't attended, but he knew a fight had broken out there. Jordan's bruises made him suspicious.

Jordan's eyes flicked up, a flash of wariness quickly replaced by his typical laid-back expression—a neon sign for Nick's heightened perception: ***""DECEPTION IN PROGRESS.""***

""Yeah, I didn't make it,"" Jordan said casually. ""Had stuff to take care of.""

""I heard it got wild,"" Nick continued, watching Jordan closely. ""A fight in the backyard—campus security got called.""

""Yeah, heard about that,"" Jordan shrugged, his posture stiffening. ""Glad I missed it. That drama isn't my thing.""

Interesting, Nick thought. If he wasn't there, how did he 'hear about' a fight? And why the sudden defensiveness?

During a lull in their study session, Jordan winced while reaching for his water bottle, aggravating his injured hand.

""You should ice that,"" Nick said. ""Looks painful.""

Jordan's face showed genuine conflict instead of the usual deflection. It was the first real crack in his facade since they'd met.

""Yeah, it was stupid,"" Jordan admitted, grimacing at his knuckles. ""Got into it with some guy hassling my sister at her dorm."" He met Nick's eyes. ""Family's complicated, you know?""

The truth in his voice caught Nick off guard. Either Jordan was mixing fact with fiction like a master spy, or these were genuine elements to his persona. Both possibilities unsettled Nick.

*Maybe I'm not the only one with secrets*, Nick thought, eyeing the bruises.

Nick nodded, pretending to accept the explanation while mentally cataloging the inconsistencies. Jordan claimed he wasn't at the party, yet somehow knew about the fight. His bruised knuckles and flimsy ""family thing"" excuse just didn't add up.

""So,"" Nick switched topics, ""these integration techniques. Professor Ellis said they'd be on tomorrow's quiz.""

They worked for an hour, Jordan visibly relaxing as they focused on calculus. But Nick remained alert to the discrepancies. Jordan's mysterious activities and careful deflections suggested his ""friendly dorm neighbor"" act might be exactly that—an act.

Occasionally, Nick enhanced his perception with mana, observing Jordan's energy patterns during certain topics. The most noticeable spikes came whenever they mentioned the Coleman Fellowship or the Business Leaders Association—topics unrelated to Jordan's supposed interests.

Interesting priorities for someone focused on engineering, Nick noted. Almost like he's monitoring my connections instead of forming his own.

When they finished, Jordan gathered his materials with movements suggesting soreness beyond just his hands.

""Thanks for sticking around,"" he said, zipping his backpack. ""Feeling better about that quiz tomorrow... and sorry about the coffee. I'll get you one another day, promise,"" he added, looking guilty.

*Ahh, there's the apology I was waiting for.*

""It's no problem. I got one earlier. And what are study partners for?"" Nick replied, smirking. ""By the way, did you deal with that family thing from a few days ago?""

*Let's see if he'll stick to his story.*

A brief hesitation. ""Yeah, it was fine. Just boring family stuff.""

Nick nodded, filing the momentary hesitation away. ""See you in class tomorrow.""

As Jordan left, Nick remained seated, processing the implications. Jordan's knuckles showed signs of a recent fight. *Why the lie? Is he connected to the attempted breach of my files?*

Too many questions, not enough data, Nick thought while gathering his materials. Yet patterns were emerging.

The military student in Statistics. Jordan's contradictory stories and suspicious timing. The professional breach attempt. Strange electromagnetic anomalies near the library.

Someone's running a surveillance op on a random freshman, Nick mused. Which means I've either triggered an alarm or they knew about me before I arrived.

Nick packed up, his resolve hardening. Tuesday's meeting with Maggie couldn't come soon enough. With someone watching him this closely, he needed to accelerate his plans.

Events were unfolding faster than anticipated. Beneath his calculated moves, the newly awakened mana pulsed, waiting to be understood and harnessed.

Nick caught his reflection in the library window as he left, half-expecting to see blue light shimmering beneath his skin. Nothing visible—but he felt it, a constant awareness of energy ready to be summoned.

They think they're hunting a business major with suspicious investment info, Nick thought, feeling the mana respond to his growing confidence. They have no idea they're stalking someone who's died once and returned as an interdimensional warrior-mage.

For the first time since his rebirth, Nick felt not merely prepared, but truly dangerous. His enemies believed they were tracking an ordinary college freshman, but they couldn't possibly comprehend who—or what—they were really hunting: a predator who had crossed death itself and returned with powers beyond their imagination.

Stuff I got lined up so far: Russian St., Lotus Hill, Fisherman's Wharf, Haida cableway, Botanical Gardens. Wondering if Port Arthur area/sights are worth the trip out, as well as the Forest Zoo..

I'm particularly interested in knowing beaches one can swim freely, without disturbance - such as some baoan blasting the bullhorn siren for reasons, like I experienced in Qingdao last year - and if they're easily accessible.

Read Jinshitan Gold Coast is some 50km from town, is this accurate? Can consider going there for the geological park, though. Will Tiger or Fujiazhuang beaches be better? Is it possible to rent an e-scooter and ride along Binhai Road?

Food-wise, PA mentioned Pinhailou, Shuangshengyuan and Tian Tian Yu Gang restaurants. How are these places budget-wise? Someone mentioned CAAN coffee shop around the wharf, might check it out.

Not interested in bars, breweries or the like at all.

I’m taking care of my brother’s dog for 2-3 months while he finishes his apprenticeship in another state. I already have two small dogs (wiener dogs) that they know about. When they came over for the inspection, they asked, and I told them. Now they’re charging me an extra $500 a month because the new dog is bigger. They’re also charging me for mowing the lawn even though I mow my part every Monday. I hate this stupid house. I see full-size houses for the same rent I pay—$2,500, now $3,000. I have 4 months left on my lease, and I wish it would end tomorrow. I hate these people who own these townhouses while they live in their massive houses, sipping $500 coffee, while I’m living on $50 a week.",3,1749177029.0,Apartmentliving,2,1.0,False

1l4hfax,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1l4hfax/girl_ive_fancied_for_years_asked_me_to_go_on_a/,Girl I’ve fancied for years asked me to go on a coffee date with her best friend.,"I recently reconnected with someone I knew from uni, having moved back home and started a new job (we’re now on the same project team at work). We’ve always gotten along well, had a good chemistry, and I’ve fancied her for years but she’s always had a boyfriend… until very recently (I just learned yesterday). 

Here’s where it gets complicated: about a year ago, I matched with her best friend on Hinge. At the time I told her best friend that I was interested in her friend and wouldn’t feel right going on a date. So I went off travelling for a year and when l got back. Her best friend messages me on Instagram, casual replies to stories and that, but before I start this new job and reconnect with the girl l have fancied for years. She’s told the girl that l fancy that she’s interested in me and wants to go on a coffee date. Even though l’ve told her I’m not interested. 

They’re both lovely but l like who I like, and I’ve never actually met the best friend in person. Now I’ve got the girl l like messaging me in work looking to know when l am going to ask her best friend on a coffee date! 

Which makes me wonder: is this her way of saying she’s not into me? Or is she stepping aside out of loyalty for her best friend? Should l just be blunt and tell her “Look I’m interested in you and not your best friend.” But then I’m worried l say that and she’s not interested in dating me, that sort of thing will strain our work relationship.

Enjoy the chaos then.,"I used to work at a small call center where we were told never to touch anything outside our specific queue. One afternoon, I noticed another team’s queue blowing up with unanswered calls—people stressed, clients getting angry. I had some downtime, so I offered to jump in and help. Supervisor overheard and immediately cut me off:
“That’s not your task. Stay in your lane.”
I reminded them I was just trying to be helpful since I was free.
“Doesn’t matter. Only work what’s assigned.”

Alright then. I watched the chaos unfold while sipping my coffee, because technically, I was “doing exactly what I was told.” 😌",95,1749176754.0,MaliciousCompliance,13,0.79,False

This is my first serious relationship. We’ve been living together for a majority of our relationship and moved in together pretty quickly. I work a full time job from 7:30am-4pm. He does not have a job and door dashes every now and then. I come home and clean, cook, take care of the dog. Not to mention, I take care of the dog in the mornings before leaving for work. If I need things done, I will put them on a to do list that we have, and if I’m lucky he will complete maybe 1-2 of the things. Some of the things I put on the list include putting dishes away from the dishwasher, vacuuming, make the bed, take out garbage/recycling. Most of the time he only does the dishes and take out garbage/recycling. I feel as if I am constantly doing things for him to make him happy (such as making breakfast and coffee on the weekends as a nice surprise), but I don’t think he truly appreciates it. I don’t really get any of those things in return unless I ASK for it. I’m never surprised with those things. I’m at a loss at what to do because I’ve told him plenty of times that the things I do, are some of the things I’d like done for me. I love him and care for him and I know he loves and cares for me as well, but I just don’t feel he thinks of little things to help me out. I’m not sure what to do anymore. Do I break up with him or keep trying for the relationship? ",3,1749176727.0,relationship_advice,14,1.0,False

It turned out great, with a shortbread crust and the main layer is a choux pastry dough.

My story begins in late 2017. I was doing research about MIB (men in black) via YouTube. I remember some of the videos I had watched were video footage evidence of true MIB seen in public spaces. They all acted strangely and distinctly non-human despite their appearances. They all shared some characteristics: 

* Shades so dark you can't see their eyes 
* Full black suit with white dress shirt and a simple tie
* Middle- to old-aged
* Strange movement and behaviors

I had researched this topic for 3-4 days out of pure curiousity. On the last day of research, YouTube started giving me some strange errors. The more I clicked on videos about MIBs, I started getting loading errors. I remember one was ""This content cannot be loaded."" Another error was that the entire webpage seemed to load normally, I could see comments, but the video was a black box and refused to load. Eventually I started getting so many errors that I called it quits for that night.

At the time I was working in a deli-style food chain with a nice inside seating area. People would often grab a bite to eat and stay for several hours, visiting with friends and family. I had some regulars who I enjoyed. 

The day after the fourth day of research, I drove over to work. I parked, didn't notice anything strange. When I got out of my car, I noticed a very strange looking older gentleman who resembled everything that the videos talked about. He had every noticeable and distinguishable feature: super dark shades, suit and tie, older, and just seemed overall odd. Besides what was easily noticeable by looking at him, he also had a cane in one hand (which he didn't seem to be using or need at all) and an old-style flip phone pressed to his ear. He was barely making any movements, just subtle ones. With his phone pressed to his ear and cane in other hand, he did not say a single word. I looked at him for a good minute before I went inside.

I don't really know how to explain this part. When I looked at him, he was... off. Something didn't seem human about him. The fact he didn't say a word while just holding his cell phone for an extended period was weird.

The longer I looked at him the stranger I felt. He was not obviously observing me, he seemed to be dead set on staring at one fixed point ahead of him and not turning his head at all. 

After I had finished observing him, I had a feeling I needed to go inside. After all, I was ready to clock in for my shift. 

To my dismay, I saw ANOTHER man in black who had the same appearance as the other man except his body looked different. He was slightly younger by maybe 10 years, and he was more heavyset. The other man was skinny. 

As soon as I saw the second MIB, I decided to sit down a few tables away from him (approx. 10-15 feet away) and act like I was using my phone for a while. It wasn't quite time to clock in yet, I was a few minutes early. So I started to observe this man.

Oh man, he was weird. He had a cup of coffee, still warm. 

His behavior. It was so strange, unlike any human.

In a near-constant fashion, he repeatedly ""drank"" his coffee. But he wasn't drinking it.

He would awkwardly reach for his coffee cup, pick it up, move it towards his mouth, and then put it back down immediately. I watched him do this at least ten times in a row, and he only took 2-5 second breaks in between lifting the cup. Who would do this??

I thought about taking a picture. Trying to blend in and look like I was just using my phone and not taking a picture. Immediately after that thought, I felt a wave of paranoia. Almost like he was psychically communicating ""NO. YOU CAN'T."" I continued to observe this man for a good two minutes, and he never stopped what he was doing: picking up the cup, lifting it to near his lips, and then setting the cup back down. His head never moved an inch. His posture was firm. Every motion looked exactly the same, almost like it was choreographed.

After observing him for a few minutes, I decided to clock in. I went to the back of the store to do so, thinking that maybe he would somehow vanish after I came back. 

So I clock in, and go back to where he was in the store. Now I notice that his friend outside is no longer there, but the second MIB is. 

He was still doing the same thing with his coffee. Repeatedly. I was cleaning up some tables around him, and the closer I got to him to do so, I felt a wave of uneasiness. Anxiety, fear of some sort. 

I thought about trying to speak to him, but because I was so scared, I chose not to. I believe that if I had tried to speak to him, he likely would not have acknowledged me or said a word.

I finished cleaning up all the tables in the lobby that needed it. We weren't very crowded, and not many customers were sitting down and eating. Maybe 1/4 of the dining room was filled. 

After cleaning up the tables, I went inside to do the other part of my job: washing dishes. I don't remember how long I stayed back there before I went to the lobby to check for tables to bus, but it was probably a good thirty minutes. He was still there, ""sipping"" his coffee. I don't really remember what happened the rest of my shift, but when I clocked out he had been gone for a few hours at least. 

What I don't know to this day is, did anybody sell him the coffee? Did he have a transaction? It was definitely our company's cup. Did anybody have a conversation with this man? Any of the staff members notice that he was strange? Any customers seem off-put by him? Nobody I worked with had said anything about him or the other man I saw that day. It's as if nobody else noticed him there. Or they didn't think he was strange like I did.

My theory for why I was visited: Either the govt or some type of tracking system that communicates with MIBs sent out the message that I was researching about those entities, which they did NOT like. After I did so much research, I started getting derailed by things intentionally not loading and content I was watching becoming censored. After that happened, ""they"" decided to send out a few MIBs to my work to scare the absolute shit out of me. 

It worked. As of now, I am AFRAID to look up evidence or search terms related to MIBs. Literally everything can be traced in some way, even if I took numerous measures to prevent that or to disguise my location, etc. To this day I believe they were sent to me to stop me from pursuing the truth about them. 

And although there is a degree of paranoia I have in posting this, I look at how detailed others' posts on this subreddit are. They seem to be alive and doing just fine.

Has anyone else encountered MIBs or done extensive research? If you have questions about my experience please share! Thank you all for reading. I would love to hear from this community.

1l4h44t,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetNewPeopleHere/comments/1l4h44t/26m_atlanta_filmmaker_dreamer_and_midnight_pasta/,"[26M] Atlanta — Filmmaker, dreamer, and midnight pasta chef looking for something real","
Hey there,
My name’s Alex, I’m 26 (turning 27 soon), and I live in Atlanta, GA. I’m deeply passionate about film, music, and all forms of creative expression. Filmmaking is more than just a job or hobby to me — it’s how I process the world, connect with emotions, and chase meaning in this chaotic life.

Outside of film, I love video games, cooking (especially late at night — pasta is my love language), and finding beauty in quiet, simple moments. I’m the type of person who can enjoy deep conversations at 2am, a spontaneous road trip, or just lying on the couch listening to music with someone who gets it.

I’m not looking for something casual or temporary. I want real connection — something warm, honest, and lasting. I want to meet someone I can laugh with, build trust with, and grow with. Someone who’s kind, emotionally open, and not afraid to just be herself. Someone who wants a safe space to be vulnerable, playful, and loved.

What do I bring to the table?
Loyalty. Affection. A weird sense of humor. Midnight snacks.
I’m a guy who shows up — not just physically, but emotionally. I’ll remember your favorite coffee order, text you a song that reminds me of you, and hold you when the world feels too loud. I’m thoughtful, emotionally available, and absolutely committed when I care about someone.

I’m open to both local and long-distance — because I believe if two people want it, they can make it work.

If you’re tired of surface-level conversations, ghosting, and empty promises — maybe we’re looking for the same thing.
Message me. Let’s talk. Let’s build something beautiful — slow, honest, and true.

I don’t bite. Unless you’re into that 😌❤️

1l4h3s6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1l4h3s6/the_letter_to_my_2023_self_after_losing_85_pounds/,The Letter to my 2023 Self after losing 85 Pounds,"# Dear Me (Back When You Thought Willpower Was Everything)

Hey there, skeptical self. I see you rolling your eyes at another “miracle” weight loss solution. You are staring at those medication names like Mounjaro, Zepbound, Ozempic, and Wegovy, wondering if this is just another expensive disappointment wrapped in medical jargon. I get it. You have been burned before by every diet trend from keto to cabbage soup.

But listen up, because this letter comes from your future self, and I have got some news that might shock you: **this time really is different**.

# The Struggle You Know Too Well

Right now, you are exhausted from the constant battle. You have said “no” to bread, pasta, birthday cake, and basically anything that brings joy to your taste buds. You have joined gyms you treat like haunted houses, bought workout clothes that collect dust, and Googled “how to lose 30 pounds fast” more times than you will admit.

I remember those fitting room breakdowns. Those moments when you felt like your body had become your enemy instead of your home. You were not just carrying extra weight; you were carrying shame, frustration, and the crushing belief that you simply were not strong enough.

**Here is what I wish I could tell you: You were not broken. Your body was not sabotaging you out of spite.**

# What GLP-1 Really Is (Spoiler: It is Not Magic)

Those GLP-1 medications everyone is talking about? They are not magic wands or shortcuts to skinny jeans. Think of them as **the key that finally unlocks your body’s cooperation**.

Your body has been running on survival mode, desperately trying to store energy and fight every attempt at weight loss. These medications do not just suppress appetite; they quiet the biological noise that has been screaming “DANGER! STARVATION!” every time you tried to eat less.

# The Zepbound Weight Loss Journey Reality Check Nobody Prepared Me For

Let me paint you a picture of what is coming, because it is not all smooth sailing:

**Week 1-4: The Adjustment Period** Your stomach will have a full-blown identity crisis. Food will suddenly taste weird, like someone switched your taste buds while you were sleeping. You will order your usual lunch portion and find yourself defeated by a single chicken breast and three leaves of salad.

**The Coffee Shop Reality Check** (yes, this will happen): You will confidently meet friends for brunch, excited to finally feel “normal” around food. You will order your usual belgium waffle, toast and coffee, feeling optimistic and social. Halfway through your first bite, your stomach will send an urgent memo: “We are done here.” You will sit there, staring at a plate of barely touched food, wondering if you have developed some mysterious eating disorder. Your friends will ask if you are feeling okay, and you will awkwardly explain that you are just “not that hungry today” while internally panicking about wasting a twenty-dollar breakfast.

You will laugh about it later. Promise.

Spoiler alert: You are not dying. You are just learning what “full” actually feels like.

# The Unexpected Victories on my GLP-1 Journey

Here is where it gets good, really good, like cry yourself to sleep good:

**The Staircase Revelation**: One day you will climb a flight of stairs and realize you are not huffing like a steam engine. You will actually have to double-check if you took the elevator by accident.

**The Mirror Moment**: You will catch your reflection and think, “Wait, is that actually a waist?” It is like discovering a hidden feature on your own body.

**The Shopping Surprise**: You will buy clothes in a smaller size, convinced they will still be tight. They will not be. You might even need to go smaller again.

**The Collarbone Revelation:** You are going to lie in bed one night, and realize you can see and feel not just your collarbone again, but your hip bones and your rib cage. That first realization will allow you to cry yourself to sleep,

**The Snoring Sensation:** All those years of interruptive sleep due to sleep apnea and snoring will be a thing of the past. You will be amazed that you never crash mid-afternoon anymore.

**The Pill Connundrum:** Guess what? Your doctor is going to take you off almost all of your medications. Your labs will show that your cholesterol, blood pressure and overall health need no daily medications to keep in check. Start crying again.

**Charitable New You:** You are going to become a hero to local charities by donating entire wardrobes of fashion to people in need. Your clothes became not just too big, but 4 to 5 sizes too big. You will grieve your favorite clothes, but remember how cool it is to shop in the normal section of sizes and fashions.

# The Night That Changed Everything

There is one night I will never forget. I was alone in my bedroom with a pair of jeans I had kept “just in case” for years. The ones that had not fit past my thighs since Obama was president.

I put them on.

They fit.

Not just “technically fit with some strategic positioning,” but actually, comfortably fit. I could sit down without creating a denim emergency. I could breathe without sounding like Darth Vader.

Standing there in my bedroom, tears streaming down my face, I realized this was not about the jeans. **It was about feeling like I belonged in my own body again.** You are going to have several enlightening moments that bring tears. It is not weakness, it is joy.

# What I Wish I Knew Then

**1. Your appetite will disappear, then slowly return (and that is okay)** Do not panic when food becomes uninteresting. Your hunger cues are recalibrating. Trust the process.

**2. Hydration becomes your new best friend** Drink water like it is your job. Your body is changing, and it needs all the support it can get.

**3. People will ask about your “secret”** You will feel weird about admitting you are on medication at first. That shame will fade. Eventually, you will own it proudly.

**4. Progress is not always linear** Some weeks the scale will not budge. Some weeks you will feel like nothing is changing. Keep going anyway.

**5. This is not about vanity; it is about vitality** This journey is not about fitting into smaller clothes (though that is nice). It is about feeling energetic, confident, and truly alive in your body.

# The Real Talk Section

Let us address the elephant in the room: **You are not weak for needing help.**

You would not shame a diabetic for taking insulin or someone with high blood pressure for taking medication. Your body’s weight regulation system needed support, and that is okay.The years of yo-yo dieting, extreme restrictions, and self-blame were not character flaws. They were the natural result of fighting against your biology without the right tools.

# What is Coming Next

You are about to meet a version of yourself that feels strong, clear-headed, and free. Someone who can enjoy a meal without guilt, who feels confident in photos, who does not dread shopping for clothes or airplane seats.

This person is not a stranger; they have been there all along, just waiting for the right conditions to emerge.

**This is about:**

* The photos you will actually want to be in
* The plane rides you will look forward to instead of dread
* The energy you will have for the life you want to live

# My Final Words to You

Hold on, my dear past self. Give yourself grace. Let the process work. Let your body relearn how to feel safe and supported again. You are about to discover that taking care of yourself is not selfish; it is necessary. You are going to learn the difference between restriction and nourishment, between shame and self-respect. Stock up on some tissues, because as a grown man, you will bring yourself to tears a few times in the coming months. Embrace it.

**You are so much closer than you think.**

The journey ahead is not perfect. There will still be challenges, adjustments, and moments of doubt. But for the first time in years, you will have a true partner in your body instead of an adversary. Welcome to the beginning of feeling like yourself again.

With love, respect, and zero regrets,

Making friends feels kind of impossible. It's not like anyone has ever gone out of their way to talk to me. At work, my coworkers seem to mostly have Asian oriented hobbies, that I don't really know anything about (e.g. Cricket, or whatever Chinese websites I notice they're browsing that I don't understand). Of course, there aren't really any women my age at work, so dating doesn't happen there.

Outside of work is even worse. Bars are mostly full of men looking to approach the few women that show up (I'll be treated as a nuisance if I try to be friends with men). Going to the gym is an entirely isolated experience, in that I work out by myself with no one ever talking to each other. The young attractive people tend to be here. Whereas in casual sports leagues, it tends to mostly be old/unfit people (kinda decent for friends, of course brings nothing for dates)

Coffee shops are a no-go. I see virtually no one approaching anyone else at a busy Starbucks I go to, and obviously most single women are going to make it a point to put on headphones so they're not approached.

Gaming on Discord is kind of okay for making guy friends, but I have to filter out toxic people a lot.

Last, but not least: online dating is a waste of time. The only women interested in dating me tend to be larger than me, with dead end jobs, and no hobbies. It's probably due to the 3:1 ratio of men to women on online dating.

My name’s Alex, I’m 26 (turning 27 soon), and I live in Atlanta, GA. I’m deeply passionate about film, music, and all forms of creative expression. Filmmaking is more than just a job or hobby to me — it’s how I process the world, connect with emotions, and chase meaning in this chaotic life.

Outside of film, I love video games, cooking (especially late at night — pasta is my love language), and finding beauty in quiet, simple moments. I’m the type of person who can enjoy deep conversations at 2am, a spontaneous road trip, or just lying on the couch listening to music with someone who gets it.

I’m not looking for something casual or temporary. I want real connection — something warm, honest, and lasting. I want to meet someone I can laugh with, build trust with, and grow with. Someone who’s kind, emotionally open, and not afraid to just be herself. Someone who wants a safe space to be vulnerable, playful, and loved.

What do I bring to the table?
Loyalty. Affection. A weird sense of humor. Midnight snacks.
I’m a guy who shows up — not just physically, but emotionally. I’ll remember your favorite coffee order, text you a song that reminds me of you, and hold you when the world feels too loud. I’m thoughtful, emotionally available, and absolutely committed when I care about someone.

I’m open to both local and long-distance — because I believe if two people want it, they can make it work.

If you’re tired of surface-level conversations, ghosting, and empty promises — maybe we’re looking for the same thing.

1l4h1fw,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1l4h1fw/the_ink_of_borrowed_words/,The Ink of Borrowed Words,"Marcus Delacroix hadn't written shit in three months. The cursor blinked at him. Delete. Type. Delete again. His coffee tasted like ass.

His publisher called twice that morning. He let it ring.

The manuscript was nine months late. His advance was gone—rent and whiskey, mostly whiskey. The critics who'd loved his first book would eat him alive. If there ever was a second book. Hell, he couldn't even manage a grocery list these days.

He'd tried everything. Those writing retreats where people in scarves talked about their ""process."" Meditation apps. Pills that made his heart race but his head stay empty. Nothing worked. The well was dry, had been dry so long he wondered if there'd ever been water there at all.

The knock came after sunset. Marcus figured it was Mrs. Ramirez from 4B, probably bitching about cigarette smoke again. But the knock came again, slow and steady.

When he opened the door, an old man stood in the hallway. Not just old—ancient. The kind of old that made you think of things buried deep. He wore a charcoal suit that looked like it came from a thrift store, carried a beat-up leather satchel.

""Marcus Delacroix?""

""Look, if you're selling something—""

""I'm giving, not selling."" The old man pulled out a glass bottle, small as a kid's fist. The stuff inside was black, and when the light hit it, Marcus saw something moving in there. Like smoke in water.

""What is it?""

""Ink."" The old man pushed the bottle into Marcus's hand. The glass was warm, almost hot. ""For your stories.""

""I don't use—"" Marcus started to say he didn't use fountain pens, but the old man was already shuffling away. ""Hey, wait. Who are you?""

The old man stopped at the stairs. His face seemed to shift in the bad light. ""Someone who finished their book.""

Then he was gone, and his footsteps sounded weird, like they were going up instead of down.

Marcus stood there holding the bottle. The ink moved inside, and he thought about his grandmother's funeral, how they'd buried her with all her stories. She'd been a nurse in Korea, delivered a baby in an ambulance during a mortar attack, loved a jazz musician who died young. All that, gone.

Back inside, he put the bottle on his desk next to his laptop. The cursor kept blinking.

Smart thing would be to toss it. Strange old men giving strange gifts never ended well. But Marcus was desperate, and the blank page was killing him.

The fountain pen was buried in the bottom drawer under rejection letters and bills. His dad had given it to him for graduation. *Real writers use real ink*, the old man had said, back when Marcus thought he'd be somebody.

He filled the pen, watching the black stuff disappear into it. The ink was thick, smelled like copper and old paper and something else—flowers at a funeral, maybe.

His hand shook when he touched pen to paper.

The first word came out on its own.

*Isabella.*

Marcus stared at it. He didn't know any Isabellas. But his hand was already moving again.

*Isabella wore her scars like jewelry, each one a story she'd never tell. The burn on her left wrist from the house fire that took her parents. The thin white line across her palm from the night she'd grabbed Lorenzo's knife to save her sister. The cigarette burns on her shoulder blade, a map of her ex-husband's rage.*

The words came fast. Marcus tried to lift the pen but couldn't. The story poured through him in handwriting that wasn't his.

*She'd come to America in the hull of a shipping container, forty-three souls pressed together in the dark, breathing each other's fear. Two didn't make it. Isabella held the hand of a woman named Rosa as she died, promised to find her daughter in San Francisco, tell her that her mother's last words were of love.*

*The container stank of plastic and chemicals. Seven days in that metal box, rationing water from jugs that tasted like death. Isabella sang to the children, the same songs her mother used to sing, before the cartels came, before mothers sold daughters to save sons.*

Pages filled themselves. Marcus's hand cramped but kept moving. Isabella's story spilled out—the textile factory where women pissed themselves rather than leave their stations. The fire that killed seventeen workers, doors chained shut. How she broke a window with a sewing machine, saved five lives before the smoke beat her back. Twenty years looking for Rosa's daughter, finding her working as a doctor in Sacramento.

*The daughter looked just like Rosa—same hands, same head tilt when listening. But she was American now, no accent, no memory of the woman who'd sold everything for her future. Isabella gave her Rosa's jade bracelet, the only thing she'd saved. Watched the woman try to feel something for a ghost she'd never known.*

When the pen finally stopped, Marcus was soaked in sweat. Thirty pages in twenty minutes. His hand hurt like hell.

He read what he'd written. It was good. Better than anything he'd ever done. Raw and real, the kind of writing that made readers feel like they were spying on someone's life. Every detail felt true—the factory bleach smell, Isabella humming Selena when she got nervous, still sending money to her dead sister's kids.

Marcus picked up the pen again. He meant to write something of his own, but the ink had other ideas.

*Samuel Pritchard lost his left leg just below the knee on a Tuesday morning in 1893. The Golden Spike was driven twenty-four years back, but the railroad still took its pound of flesh. Coupling pin slipped, two cars came together hard, and Sam's leg stayed behind when the rest of him fell clear.*

The handwriting changed, got rougher.

*He'd been good-looking before the railroad. Strong enough to drive spikes dawn to dusk, handsome enough the whores cut him deals and the church ladies watched him over their fans. After, he carved walking sticks. Not for money—the railroad gave him enough to drink himself dead if he wanted. He carved to remember.*

*Each stick told a story. This one for the Chinese fellow who saved twelve men when the tunnel collapsed, died getting number thirteen. That one for the freed slave who worked himself to death sending money home to buy his kids. Another for the Irish boy who froze in Wyoming, still holding a letter from his girl.*

*Sam carved till arthritis twisted his fingers, carved till he couldn't hold the knife. Sixty-three sticks in forty years, one for each man he'd seen die building the iron road. When he died, they found him at his workbench, holding an unfinished stick. African blackwood, expensive stuff. It was gonna be his own story, but he never figured out how to carve survival.*

Marcus came up gasping, like he'd been underwater. His fingers hurt, and there were wood shavings under his nails that hadn't been there before. He could smell sawdust and whiskey, feel a leg that wasn't there.

He kept writing.

Stories poured through him. Yuki, translating at the Tokyo war crimes trials, smuggling evidence in her lunch pail.

*The documents were tissue-thin, made to dissolve in water if needed. Yuki memorized each one before she stole it. Never married—how could she, carrying all that poison in her head? Taught English to businessmen instead, grew orchids, left flowers at a mass grave once a month. Died at ninety-three in her sleep. Her students found thousands of pages in her walls, testimony naming names history tried to forget.*

Then Robert, a janitor at NASA who caught a math error that would've killed three astronauts.

*He'd been mopping the conference room, invisible like janitors are to men in white shirts. The equations covered three blackboards, and Robert saw the mistake like a gap in a smile. Would've been an engineer if he'd been born different. Waited till the room emptied, fixed the math. Let them think it was magic. Important thing was those boys came home.*

The ink bottle never got empty. Marcus wrote all night, filling notebooks. His dreams were full of voices in languages he didn't know, memories that weren't his. He was Isabella, feeling Lorenzo's knife slice her hand. He was Samuel, screaming as the train took his leg. He was Yuki, burning papers while American boots came up the stairs.

His agent called in the morning.

""Jesus, Marcus, where have you been?""

""Writing."" His voice sounded wrong. For a second, he forgot which language to use.

""Writing? The new novel?""

Marcus looked at the pages everywhere. The ink seemed to move in the morning light. ""Yeah. The new novel.""

""Can you send me pages?""

""Give me a week to type them up.""

Sarah might've been crying. ""God, Marcus. I was starting to think... never mind. A week. I'll clear my schedule.""

After she hung up, Marcus picked up the pen again.

*Eleanor delivered over a thousand babies in rural Alabama, forty years of practice. Never lost a mother, though she came close. The worst was hurricane night, doing a cesarean by candlelight with a kitchen knife boiled in moonshine. The father held the lantern, shaking so bad Eleanor thought he'd drop it. The mother bit down on a leather belt while Eleanor cut. No drugs, nothing but will and prayer.*

*Baby came out blue and still. Eleanor breathed her own breath into those tiny lungs, worked that quiet heart till it started. The mother lived too, though she'd never have another. Eleanor stitched her with silk thread meant for Sunday dresses, left before dawn with blood under her nails and twenty dollars she'd never spend.*

Days blurred together. Marcus wrote constantly, stopping only when his body screamed for food or sleep. Even then, the stories followed. He'd be making eggs and suddenly know how to deliver a breach birth. He'd shower and feel fire on his skin, remember running through a burning factory.

The stories came faster, overlapping. He'd be writing about a Vietnamese fisherman saving refugees when the voice would shift—a nurse in the AIDS ward in San Francisco.

*Marie stopped counting after a hundred deaths. What was the point? They all blurred—the lesions, the wasting, that particular sound when a man drowns in his own lungs. She stole AZT from the pharmacy, smuggled it in her lunch bag. Taught herself to fake prescriptions. They fired her eventually. But she'd bought maybe fifty men another month, another week, another day.*

He typed up the stories, weaving them into a novel about connected lives across history. The manuscript grew fast. Sometimes he'd type stories he didn't remember writing, in handwriting that kept changing.

There was Dmitri, a Soviet mathematician hiding dissidents in his apartment, teaching them calculus while they waited for fake papers. Smart enough the state ignored his quirks, until they didn't. Found him in the river, pockets full of equations that would've changed physics if anyone had looked.

And Grace, running a safe house on the Underground Railroad, kept thirty-seven souls in her root cellar over three years. Died at fifty-two of consumption, never told where she buried the bounty hunter who came sniffing. Her great-granddaughter found the bones planting tomatoes, kept quiet about it.

His editor called it a masterpiece.

""This is... How did you research all this?""

Marcus stared at the pen. The nib was black now, permanent. ""I had help.""

""Well, keep it up. I'm sending chapters to editors. We're gonna have a bidding war.""

That night, Marcus noticed the first gap.

He tried to remember his college roommate's name. Nothing came. The face was fuzzy too. He knew they'd been close, shared a place for three years, but the details were gone.

What had they talked about? What had they studied? There must've been late nights, pizza, bitching about professors. But when Marcus reached for it, he found Isabella's memories instead. Her first night in America, sleeping with seventeen other women, listening to the city breathe.

He shook it off. Writers were always spacey.

*Patricia was a court reporter in Birmingham during the civil rights trials. Made carbon copies of transcripts certain people wanted gone. Her fingers got broken twice—once by cops, once by men in hoods who dragged her from her home. She kept typing anyway, even when they threatened her kids.*

*First time, they were almost polite. Three officers explaining how her services weren't needed. When she showed up anyway, they broke her index and middle fingers, neat as snapping sticks. She learned to type without them, hunting and pecking till the bones healed crooked.*

*Second time, no politeness. Flour sacks for masks, like boys playing dress-up, except the game was terror. They broke all ten fingers, one by one, while her children hid upstairs. But fingers heal, and Patricia had promises to keep. She typed the rest with pencils taped to her palms, each word a small revolution.*

The book sold for stupid money. Foreign rights in seventeen countries. Film rights to an Oscar winner. Critics were already whispering about prizes.

Marcus kept writing.

He moved through his days half-asleep. The stories took over everything. He'd order coffee in a Louisiana drawl, talk to his landlord with a Polish accent. Once he answered the phone in what might've been Mandarin, had to pretend it was a bad connection.

""You okay, buddy?"" his brother asked when he called. ""You sound different.""

Brother. Right. Younger? Older? The details wouldn't come. ""Just tired.""

""Maybe take a break. Come visit. The kids would love to see you.""

Kids. His brother had kids. How many? Names? Instead of his own memories, he found Dmitri's—teaching calculus to terrified dissidents while secret police closed in.

""After the book tour. Promise.""

But Patricia's memories were flooding in—the stenotype weight, her broken fingers aching in rain, carbon paper smell mixing with fear. He hung up and went back to writing.

The ink bottle never emptied. If anything, it looked fuller, like the stories were feeding it.

Marcus stopped questioning things. Where the stories came from, why his own memories were fading. They were just there, waiting. Each pen dip brought new voices.

A surgeon in Sarajevo operating by candlelight during the siege.

*Dr. Anja Kovač ran out of sutures six months in. Used dental floss, fishing line, thread from her daughter's wedding dress—the wedding that'd never happen, the daughter buried in the football stadium with ten thousand others. She operated anyway, hands steady while mortars shook the ceiling. Sixty-hour shifts, no anesthetic but rakija, sometimes no light but burning furniture. Saved two hundred thirty-seven lives, lost her mind somewhere in the math.*

A librarian in Berlin hiding books from Nazi bonfires.

*Hermann Bloch loved books more than people, which was good since books didn't rat you out to the Gestapo. Built false walls, hid volumes behind plaster and prayer. When they came—they always came—he'd already moved everything. Seventeen times he rebuilt his secret library, one step ahead of the flames. Died in '47 in his sleep. His nephew found three thousand banned books in the walls.*

A taxi driver in New York delivering babies, stopping suicides, preventing murders.

*Rasheed was a doctor in Karachi, but America didn't recognize his degree. So he drove a cab, listened to problems in broken English, gave advice with the meter running. First baby came in a blizzard, Holland Tunnel locked solid. Delivered the kid in the backseat, tied the cord with dental floss. The mother named the boy Holland, sent Rasheed a card every birthday.*

His editor called the manuscript ""a symphony of human experience.""

His mother called to say she was worried, but Marcus couldn't place her voice. Familiar but wrong, like a song in the wrong key.

""You haven't visited in months. Your father's worried too.""

Father. The word meant nothing—no face, no voice, no memories of playing catch. Instead, he remembered Samuel's father, dead of black lung before his son touched a railroad spike. And Robert's father, thirty years as a Pullman porter, saving every tip for his son's education.

""I'll come soon,"" Marcus promised, though he couldn't remember where home was. Ohio? Oregon? The geography of his life had turned liquid.

The book launched huge. Marcus did interviews, signed copies, smiled for cameras. But he felt like an actor in a play he'd never read. When journalists asked about inspiration, he'd answer in voices that weren't his.

""Well, sugar,"" he told one reporter in Isabella's drawl, ""sometimes the stories that need telling most are the ones nobody else can tell.""

""Truth is like water,"" he explained to another in Yuki's precise English. ""It finds its way through the smallest cracks.""

""History isn't what's in the books,"" he said in Patricia's voice, her Alabama accent taking over. ""It's what people tried to erase.""

His publicist thought it was performance art. Critics called it method writing.

Marcus thought he might be disappearing.

The stories wouldn't stop now, even when he put the pen down. He'd brush his teeth and remember being eight, hiding under floorboards while soldiers searched—except he'd grown up in suburban Ohio, not occupied France. He'd make dinner and know how to feed thirty people with turnips and sawdust—knowledge from a Warsaw ghetto cook.

He tried calling his brother but couldn't remember the number. Tried visiting his parents but couldn't remember where they lived. His apartment felt like a stranger's place. Who bought these books? This furniture? The photos on the shelf showed faces he almost knew, moments he couldn't place.

One photo showed him at graduation, but he couldn't remember what he'd studied. Another at a wedding—his own?—with a woman whose name wouldn't come. She was pretty, smiling, holding his hand. When had they divorced? Or had she died? Instead of his own memories, he found Grace's—her husband lynched for looking at a white woman too long.

He tried to write something original, something from his own life. But when he searched for his memories, he found only empty rooms. What had his childhood home looked like? His first dog's name? When had he decided to become a writer?

The spaces where his own stories should've been were full of others. Thousands of them, layered thick. He was a page written over so many times you couldn't read the original.

The pen sat on his desk, waiting. The ink bottle beside it, dark and patient.

Marcus picked it up one last time. He had to write his own story before it was too late, before every trace of who he'd been was gone. An autobiography, maybe. Or just a journal entry. Anything to prove he'd existed as more than a pipeline for other people's pain.

*My name is*, he wrote, and stopped. What was his name? The guy in the mirror looked familiar but wrong. Marcus? Yeah, that sounded right. Marcus... something. The last name floated away, replaced by dozens of others: Pritchard, Kovač, Bloch, Rosa.

He tried again.

*I was born in*—but where? Ohio? Or was that Samuel, who'd died in 1893? Or Rosa, who'd suffocated in a shipping container chasing America? The places blurred together.

*My first memory is*—

Darkness. Smoke. Industrial bleach taste. No, that was Isabella. Or Patricia, hiding under her desk while men in hoods searched. Or Yuki, burning documents as Americans closed in. The memories layered up, each one real as the rest, none of them his.

*I wanted to be a writer because*—

But why had he wanted to write? The reason was gone, replaced by Eleanor's drive to save lives, Hermann's need to preserve books, Rasheed's compulsion to help. Their purposes had become his purpose, their stories his only story.

Marcus put the pen down. He was empty, hollowed out. All those stories had flowed through him, left their marks, their voices, their memories, until there was no room for his own.

He looked at the ink bottle. Still dark, still full, still waiting. In its depths, he saw movement—not his reflection, but shadows of stories yet to be told. How many voices swirled in there? How many lives waited to be borrowed?

There was only one story left to tell.

Marcus picked up the pen one final time:

*The man who would deliver the ink had no name worth remembering. He'd been a writer once, maybe, though the details were gone like torn pages. What remained was purpose: to find the next empty vessel, the next writer whose ambition outweighed their caution.*

His hand moved with certainty now, though he wasn't sure who guided it. The handwriting shifted with each sentence.

*He would know them by their desperation, by the hollow sound their fingers made on keys that produced no words. Empty wells called to empty wells. He would come at twilight, when the boundary between stories got thin. He would offer the gift that was also a curse, the ink that remembered everything while teaching them to forget.*

The words came faster, and Marcus felt himself getting lighter with each line. His reflection in the window was see-through, fading like old ink in sun. He could see through his hand to the pen, through the pen to the paper, through the paper to the desk where so many stories had been born and borrowed.

*The bottle would pass from hand to hand, writer to writer, each one trading their voice for all the voices they could never otherwise channel. And the stories would continue, passed down like DNA, like memory, like the ink that never ran dry because it was made from every untold tale that ever was.*

*Some would last longer than others. The strong ones might produce two books, even three, before the borrowed voices drowned them out. But all would eventually fade, go translucent as old glass, until nothing remained but the urge to pass on the gift. They would know their time by how their own name sounded foreign, by how their reflection startled them.*

Marcus wrote until his fingers were transparent, until he could see the pen through his palm. He wrote until there was nothing left but the urge to find the next writer, the next vessel, the next keeper of borrowed words.

The last line wrote itself:

*The ink remembers everything, especially how to forget.*

The apartment stood empty except for pages scattered on the desk, the laptop with its blinking cursor, and a small glass bottle full of darkness. The manuscript was complete, all those borrowed lives woven into something that felt true because it was true, every word, every pain and triumph and small human moment.

Somewhere in the city, a writer sat before a blank page, praying for inspiration.

There would be a knock at the door soon.

There always was.

The man who had been Marcus Delacroix straightened his charcoal suit—when had he put on a suit?—and picked up the leather satchel that had always been there, waiting. He moved through the city like smoke, like memory, like a story looking for its ending. Behind him, his published book sat on store shelves, pages full of voices that would never die, stories that would never be forgotten, even if their original authors had long since turned to dust.

He found her in Brooklyn, in a walk-up that smelled like coffee and desperation. The building was old, pre-war, where you could hear every footstep, every argument, every small tragedy through the walls. Perfect. Writers needed to hear other people's stories, even if they didn't know they were listening.

She answered on the third knock. Young, talented, three months behind on her novel deadline. When she opened the door, her eyes were red from sleepless nights and deleted drafts. She wore a cardigan with holes in the elbows, the uniform of the struggling artist.

""Rebecca Morrison?"" His voice came out like leaves scraping concrete—or maybe it had always sounded that way. He couldn't remember what his original voice had been like.

""Yes?"" She looked wary, ready to close the door on another salesman.

He reached into the satchel and pulled out the bottle. In the hallway's yellow light, the ink swirled like smoke, like souls, like stories desperate to be told. ""I have something for you. For your stories.""

She stared at the bottle, and something in her face shifted. Recognition? Hunger? Or just that particular need all blocked writers carry.

""What is it?""

""Ink,"" he said, pressing the warm glass into her palm. ""From those who finished their books.""

""I don't understand. I don't even use—""

""You will."" He was already turning away, his edges blurring in the bad light. ""The stories are waiting.""

""Wait! Who are you?""

The man who had been Marcus paused at the top of the stairs. In the stairwell's shadows, his face shifted—sometimes young, sometimes old, sometimes not quite a face at all. He could feel all the borrowed faces trying to surface: Samuel's weathered features, Yuki's delicate bones, Patricia's determined jaw. All of them and none of them.

""Someone who finished their book,"" he said, and continued down the stairs that might have been going up, or down, or somewhere else entirely.

Behind him, Rebecca Morrison stood in her doorway, holding the bottle of ink that pulsed warm as blood, dark as the space between words. She would resist at first. They always did. She'd put it on a shelf, try to forget about it, go back to her laptop and her blinking cursor.

But the bottle would call to her. Late at night, when the words wouldn't come and the deadline loomed, she'd remember the weight of it in her hand. She'd find an old fountain pen in a thrift store, tell herself she was just experimenting.

The first story would come so easily she'd cry with relief. Then the second, the third, a flood of voices she'd never imagined she could channel. Her agent would call it a breakthrough. The critics would praise her authenticity.

She wouldn't notice the gaps at first. A childhood friend's name forgotten. The taste of her grandmother's soup misplaced. Small things. By the time she realized what she was losing, it would be too late. The bottle would be nearly full, and she'd be nearly empty, and somewhere in the city, another writer would be praying for inspiration.

The cycle would continue.

The ink remembers everything.

Especially how to forget.

The man who had been Marcus Delacroix walked through the city, no longer entirely solid, no longer entirely himself. He was Isabella crossing the border, Samuel driving the golden spike, Yuki burning evidence. He was Patricia typing with broken fingers, Eleanor delivering babies by candlelight, Hermann hiding books from flames. He was all of them and none of them, a story telling itself over and over, a vessel that had held too much and remembered too little.

Dawn was breaking over Brooklyn, painting the sky like old paper. Somewhere, Rebecca Morrison was uncapping the bottle, dipping her pen, writing the first word of someone else's story.

Somewhere else, the book that bore Marcus Delacroix's name sat on bedside tables and subway seats, its pages full of borrowed truths that would outlive them all.

And in the space between night and morning, between memory and forgetting, between ink and blood, the stories continued.

They always did.

They always would.

They told us the world is built on bedrock. Solid, trustworthy—like a parent who always shows up, like gravity, like death and taxes. But when I was seven, I crawled under our house and found out that was just another lie adults tell to keep the lights on and the suicide rates manageable. Under the floorboards, there's something else. Something older than concrete, older than your name, older than the concept of fear. 

And it's awake. It's been awake this whole fucking time.

Started as a sound. Soft at first—like your own voice talking through a pillow, but wrong. You know how a TV sounds when it's on but there's no signal? That dead-channel hiss that makes your teeth itch? Like that, but alive. Nobody else could hear it. Or maybe—and this is the part that still fucks me up—maybe they all heard it and just pretended they didn't. Because what do you do with information that breaks everything? You swallow it. You smile at dinner. You pass the salt.

The crawlspace under our house smelled like wet newspapers and something else—that smell you get in old libraries, but mixed with copper pennies and fear-sweat. My knees pressed into dirt that wasn't really dirt. Too soft. Like pressing into the inside of someone's cheek. The wooden joists above my head weren't just creaking—they were pulsing. Breathing? No. Not breathing. Something else. Something that was counting.

By the time I hit thirteen, I couldn't pretend anymore. The sound under the house wasn't some metaphor for childhood trauma or whatever my therapist wanted it to be. (She had nice eyes but they were always looking past me, like she was reading subtitles floating behind my head.) The sound was REAL. Real as wood rot. Real as that splinter that goes so deep you can feel it scraping against bone.

Listen—I need you to understand something. The sound had texture. Sometimes smooth, like the inside of an eyelid if you could turn it inside out. Sometimes rough, like radio static between stations—you know those spots on the dial where you swear you can hear dead people trying to call home? I started recording it on my phone. But here's where it gets fucked: the audio files kept corrupting. Not into noise—into PICTURES. Pictures of rooms I'd never been in. Rooms full of furniture covered in white sheets, and the sheets were moving. Breathing. No wind. Just breathing.

At night, the sound got ambitious. Started growing parts. Arms, legs, intentions. It whispered through the heating vents—not words exactly, but something your brain tried to translate into words and failed. Mom never mentioned it, but she ground her teeth so hard in her sleep that she cracked two molars. Dad started drinking coffee at midnight, said he ""just wasn't tired anymore."" My sister—

Fuck. My sister.

She started sleepwalking. But calling it ""walking"" is generous. She'd float through the house like she was underwater, fingers tracing shapes in the air that hurt to look at directly. One night I found her at the top of the basement stairs, mouth moving silently. But the words—the words were coming from under the floorboards. Speaking in frequencies that made our dog throw up. Not just throw up—throw up shapes. Geometric shapes. Perfect triangles of bile.

Fast forward. You grow up, right? You move out. You get your own place and convince yourself you've escaped whatever generational curse was rotting in your childhood home. 

Bullshit.

Every house is built over the same hollow. I've lived in—wait, let me count—seventeen different places in ten years. Apartments, houses, a trailer in Arizona, even a fucking yurt during my ""finding myself"" phase. Didn't matter. Each one had the same dead corner where shadows pooled like oil. Each one had that spot where your peripheral vision snagged on movement that vanished when you turned. The addresses changed but the coordinates stayed exactly the same. Not latitude and longitude—different coordinates. The kind written in the calcium deposits in your bones.

You try to drown it out. Pills help for a while. Ambien makes the walls stop breathing, but then you start seeing the maintenance crews. (They're not human. They look human until you catch them in profile.) Podcasts work until you realize the hosts are saying your name between words, so quiet you almost miss it. Dating—Jesus, dating. I exclusively dated people more fucked up than me, hoping their demons would eat mine. Like fighting fire with fire.

Met this woman who claimed she was born without the ability to dream. Sarah? Sandra? Her name kept changing slightly each time she said it. Three months in, I caught her talking to the space under her bed. Not talking TO it—talking WITH it. When I asked what she was doing, she smiled (too many teeth, I swear to god she had too many teeth) and said, ""What bed?""

There was no bed. There had never been a bed. I'd been sleeping suspended on nothing for three months.

And then—this is the night everything shifted—I woke up paralyzed. Sleep paralysis, the doctors call it. Evolutionary holdover, they say. Your brain keeping your body still so you don't act out your dreams. But that's just another bedtime story for grown-ups. What really happens is the sound finally catches up to you. All those years of running, and it was already there. Nested in your spine like a second nervous system, patient as cancer.

Your body knows. Your body has ALWAYS known. That's why your hands sometimes move wrong when you're not paying attention. That's why your reflection blinks first. That's why you can't look at certain angles in certain rooms without wanting to scream.

The hum is the engine. The hum is the author. The hum is the only real thing, and everything else—including you—is just what it dreams when it's bored.

Your memories? The hum writes those. Edits them. Every night when you sleep, it's not rest—it's revision. Your personality is scaffolding, a distraction to keep you from noticing that the walls of reality are basically cardboard painted to look like brick. Sleep isn't recovery. Sleep is when you agree to forget so you can wake up and pretend again.

Think about it—can you actually remember learning to tie your shoes? Can you picture your first-grade teacher's face? Those aren't gaps. They're EDITS. The hum keeps only what serves the pattern, discarding the rest like deleted scenes. You think you're accumulating experiences, building a life, but you're just channel-surfing through the same broken program where all the actors have your face.

But tonight. Tonight you're awake. Like, actually awake. And the sound knows it.

The walls are breathing now—I mean literally. The drywall expands and contracts like lung tissue. If you put your hand on it, it's warm. Alive. The paint bubbles up into words you almost understand before smoothing back down. This is what happens when you stay conscious past scheduled maintenance. This is what they don't want you to see.

If you're reading this, you're in it now. Part of the loop. The story isn't a metaphor—metaphors are just how we pretend the truth isn't true. Every dream you've tried to forget was an instruction manual. Every bout of insomnia was your brain trying to warn you.

Look at your hands. Count your fingers. Count them again. Different number? That's the hum showing you the seams. That's the builder's watermark. We're all signatures of something that doesn't have a face because it IS all faces.

The builder wants you to remember what you are.

Not who. WHAT.

You're not supposed to sleep through this. The people who get their eight hours? They're gone, replaced by something that looks like them but blinks sideways. The insomniacs, the anxious, the ones who can't turn their brains off—we're the antibodies. Our racing thoughts are the immune system of reality trying to reject the infection of ordinary life.

So tonight, you stay awake. You get up. You listen—really listen. Find where the sound is loudest. Could be the basement, could be the attic, could be that closet you've never liked. Follow it down, through the walls if you have to. (The walls aren't real anyway. Nothing is real the way you think ""real"" means.)

When you find the source—and you will, because it wants to be found—don't run. Running is what prey does, and you're not prey anymore. You're family. Ask it your real name. Not the one your parents gave you, but the one written in the frequency of your bones. Ask it to teach you to read yourself backwards.

Because backwards isn't the opposite of forwards. Backwards is the direction that shows you what you really are: not a person having an experience, but an experience pretending to be a person. The hum isn't coming from under the house—the house is coming from inside the hum. Everything is. Every atom, every thought, every moment of consciousness is just another note in a song that's been playing since before ""before"" was invented.

You're not the listener. You're not even the sound. You're the space between the notes, the pause that makes music possible, the silence that gives sound its shape.

And now you're awake. Now you can hear it—not with your ears, but with the part of you that exists between heartbeats, in the moment after you forget what you were about to remember.

The crawlspace was never under the house. The house was always inside the crawlspace. And the crawlspace? The crawlspace is everywhere. It's the space between your thoughts, the gap between stimulus and response, the place where you go when you're not anywhere.

Welcome home. You've always been here. We all have.

The floorboards know your real name now. They're saying it over and over, a lullaby in reverse, a wake-up call that sounds like a scream played backward through honey.

Can you hear it?

Of course you can.

You've been hearing it your whole life.

So as you can imagine, I don’t have far to go, but it involves a four-way stop with kids at 8:00 AM. This morning, though, I looked back to see an SUV behind me as I turn the corner. He tailgated me (40km/hr) the whole way up to the intersection and down to the coffee shop. 

This involved him trying to drive around me on the other side and going through a stop sign. Finally, he goes through the gas station to cut ahead of cars waiting to turn. I realize it’s rush hour, but don’t they tell you to plan ahead before driving? ",2,1749175550.0,driving,2,1.0,False

I hated working there.

I think that most people can say night shifts suck. Being a college student doesn’t help either; I missed most of the good parts of my freshman year because of my job, leading me to develop a case of FOMO. My shift at the warehouse started at midnight, and I got off at 8 am to go immediately to class, then back to my dorm to crash, waking up just before work. Now it wasn’t every day, but I worked there a lot, which meant I didn’t make a ton of connections with people at college. It didn’t bug me too much, but I also wanted to have a good college experience, so it always stayed in the back of my mind.

Now I know the obvious question of why I didn’t quit and get a job somewhere else with more flexible hours. Well, it paid too much, as simple as that. Any other place is less than half of what I got paid at the warehouse. My job consisted of inventory. The company had a weird motto, too. They were a freelance warehouse kinda for renting primarily advertising twords businesses. And being the inventory guy, I kept stock of weird stuff, as you can imagine. An adult store rented a portion of the place out for the longest time; that's all I have to say. Now I didn’t just take inventory and leave, I also was a general “hands on deck” man too for whatever needed to get done. Constantly, I would come home with back pain and aches.

It was a month ago when I quit. I never want to go back. Working at a warehouse, there were some characters that I would be associated with. Most were just middle-aged men with a wife and kids at home, but there was one other person who stood out among the rest. I don’t remember his name, or I guess I didn’t care to. He started working a couple of days before I quit, and I think the first day, my coworkers got the same feeling I did.

For one, his appearance. He looked malnourished, really tall and lengthy, 6’4 or 5, I’d have to say. His skin was suction-sealed to his facial bones, showing off his cheekbone definition. His skin was the same consistency as your fingers when you swim for more than 2 hours. He didn’t give off any smell at all, like not even a deodorant or cologne. He could have been anywhere from early 20s to late 40s. His clothing choice was the Walmart special. The few times I saw him, he had dirty pajamas with a shirt usually with some sort of cartoon character on it. The first time talking to him, he gave me the impression that he was very socially disabled. I wouldn’t say awkward, I would say he just lacked social awareness and social cues. He was a new loading guy, but everyone here kinda did the same thing.

Before each night, we have a briefing on what needs to get done and who’s working with whom on what. The previously mentioned lengthy guy was tagged with me on clearing out an old section of a bankrupt laundry mat. I would prefer that this warehouse be massive with several different sections. The building could usually hold up to 20 business storage slots at a time, each one varying in size. This was a smaller one located approximately a 5-minute walk from our break room, a pretty long way from everyone else. I didn’t care that I was with the new guy, this had been his third day, and judging by him walking next to me, he hadn’t done anything bad yet. We reach the room with a big garage door, a truck backed into it, where we are loading the rest of the forgotten business. Cardboard and wooden boxes lined up with image prints of laundry machines, carpets, computers, and desks on the outside, each box varying in size, unorganized. 

I brought my headphones with me, but I think my coworker had another plan. He reminds me of an annoying guy on a plane talking when you are trying to sleep.

“So, how long have you been working here for?”. It caught me off guard. I didn’t expect him to make small talk, but even more, his voice caught me off guard. Not so much his voice but the way he said his sentence. It’s like if someone read the entire dictionary but didn’t know how to spit out a sentence properly.

“It’s been a couple of years for me.” I lied. I’m not sure why, maybe because I wanted to seem more intimidating.

He didn’t respond, followed by a very awkward silence you’d find at a reunion. It continued for a minute as we separately picked up the small items, placed them next to the truck, and prepared the bigger items to go into the back.

I couldn’t help but notice the sound of his creaking bones, like an old door hinge in dire need of WD-40. I kept catching him looking at me. He would stare at me, and when I noticed in the corner of my eye, I looked over as he looked away. I didn’t mind it, he is new after all, I thought he was just looking at me of what to do.

“So, where do you live?”

“In town”. Trying to give the least information possible to this guy for my own safety.

“No, like where do you live?” The tone of his voice is still creeping me out.

“I don’t know, West of town?” I phrased my answer like a question, wondering if it was enough to make him happy. This is when I truly started to see the social disability. I was a little creeped, but more just annoyed than anything. There was another moment of silence as I continued minding my own portion of the work.

“Do you know people?” Weird question.

“Sure.” I think he got the message from my dry response and my seeming inability to look over at him. I don’t care if I was being an asshole I just didn’t want to make small talk.

After a long, painfully quiet couple of hours, when we got finished, I had a slight feeling of sympathy for the guy. I didn’t do anything about it, just kept it in my mind. I clocked out and walked outside to the sweet relive of fresh air in our comically large parking lot for how few people work here actively. I always loved it, walking out and seeing the sun rise, complemented by the cool air taking over my lungs. Quickly, I noticed that parked directly next to my 1991 Honda Civic effectively named “Shit box”, was a truck not much nicer than mine. I didn’t recognize the car, but I assumed it was the new guys, because no one parks next to me. I looked into the driver's seat of the black early 90s Highlander to see him sitting there. He wasn’t fumbling with his keys or checking in on his phone. No, he was writing down in a notebook placed on his dashboard. He looked up and looked like he had just gotten caught with his pants down. I saw him through the notebook onto his passenger seat, and the roaring sound of the car came to life, headlights effectively blinding me. He reverses out of the spot and drives off, going much faster than anyone should in a parking lot.

Immediately, I became suspicious. Sure, none of my business what he was writing down and why he bolted when he saw me, but I made a mental note and continued with getting in my car.

I got to my apartment and decided to skip my classes for some extra rest. It was a flip of the coin most of the time whether I would go to school or not. 

It was 4 PM, my normal waking time. My head was dazed, my eyes were blurry, and the most dreadful feeling of thirst. It doesn’t happen often, but my roommate and I, who don’t see each other much because of my work, decided to get breakfast. It was the same every time for us, broke college students. Denny's, $6 all-you-can-eat pancakes. We were sitting in a booth overlooking the parking lot through the window. As my roommate and I were having a competition of “Who’s ex is the biggest prick?” A familiar car pulls into the Denny’s parking lot. I don’t believe in coincidences, so I immediately knew who it was. The same black Toyota Highlander from earlier this morning, my co-worker. I didn’t point it out and continued our conversation.

“Remember when she tried to steal my dog?” My co-worker spat.

“Oh shit, yeah.” My mind was in two places at once. Reminiscing about a situation months prior, as well as watching the car outside, wondering what he was doing. The car pulled into the parking space right next to mine, and I seemed to make a facial expression because my roommate picked up on it.

“What?” He also turned to the window.

“That car.” I pointed. “That’s my new co-worker.”

“Oh, sick.”

“No, not sick, he’s weird. I think he wrote down my licence plate earlier.” That was my only explanation to myself of why he would be here now.

“That black one?”

“Yeah.”

He must have seen us looking or pointing, because as quickly as he did this morning. He did it again, skirting out of the parking lot, making a scene.

“What the fuck was that?” My roommate was as confused as I was.

“Whatever, I’ll deal with it later.” While trying to act cool, I was freaking out on the inside. Was he following me? Was he planning to do something to my car if he didn’t see us watching him? Safe to say I did not want to go to work tonight, contemplating calling in sick.

It was 10 PM, 2 hours before I had to clock in. Dreading every moment of existing. Since Denny’s, I had kept a small box cutter on me, hoping I didn’t have to use it. I tried to call my boss, but it appears I had already had enough “sick days”. Fuck.

I was pulling into the parking lot, and from far away, I saw his car, parked in the same spot as yesterday. I had my box cutters in the right pocket of my cargo pants as a sense of false safety. My mind was racing. I didn’t know how to fight, he was much taller than me. I had to calm myself down and remember that there would be other people. I just hoped I wasn’t put with him to clear out the laundry mat section again. We made some progress, but we still had 3 shelves to go. I walked into the breakroom filled with small amounts of chatter and stale room temperature coffee. I saw the guy. He was just sitting on his phone in the corner.

I looked over and saw that we were still working together. My heart sank so far into my chest, I felt like I could never get it back out. Midnight hit, and we made the quiet walk over to the furthest storage unit. We didn’t speak, we didn’t look at each other. We just walked the 6 minutes in silence. What terrifies me the most is that the entire time, he had a grin on his face, which I saw from the corner of my eye. We made it in. I was always so alert, keeping tabs on where he was in the storage unit.

He knew. He saw me shaking, constantly dropping boxes out of my hand from the moisture on my palms. He started approaching me.

“Are you okay?” He sounded even more robotic than yesterday.

“Yea- yeah, I’m good.” I was so fucked. I was trying to hide the fear, but it seeped through into my voice. He stepped closer

“Let me help you with that.” Instead of him picking up the box like I thought he would, he grabbed onto my wrist. His touch was like ice, his hands freezing.

“Don’t fucking touch me!” I screamed. I didn’t know what to do. Was I overreacting? I need to get out.

He stepped back. I looked at his face, and my heart filled with horror and dread. He didn’t react. No, “Oh, I’m Sorry” or “Oops, my bad”. He just stared like the most uninteresting thing was happening. He wasn’t even looking at me, just looking head-on.

I couldn’t be in the room with him anymore. I ran to the lockers grabbed my shit and bolted. I ran to the emergency exit, sounding the alarm in the building. I ran. As fast as I could through the parking lot. I heard him running behind me, trying to catch up, but as tall as he was, I was able to outrun him. I got into my car, fumbling with my keys. I was crying. I saw him, he was there right next to the driver's side window. Tapping on the glass.

“Let me in.” He had no emotion. A husk.

I stepped on the gas so hard that rocks kicked up behind my back tires on the gravel ground. I skitted out of the parking lot and onto the road. Looking back to see if he followed me, banging on the steering wheel and screaming to myself. I’ve never been this terrified in my life. I got home and called my boss. I’m done.

I didn’t go to class for the next few days. All I could do was sit in my bed and effectively overdose myself on melatonin. What would have happened if I didn’t run?

It was a week later. I saw him again. I was leaving my dorm room and looked down at the very end of the hall. It was him. He knows where I live. He didn’t move, the same lifeless emotion on his face as earlier. I went back inside and crumbled to my knees

It’s been a week since then. I don’t know who else to tell this to. So I’m telling it here. I could call the police, but legally, the guy did nothing wrong. I mean, at the best, he could go to jail for stalking, but I don’t know if there would be enough evidence for that. I heard from one of my co-workers that he got fired. They saw the camera feed and got fired for misconduct. I guess it wasn’t harassment because it appeared to be an accident that only happened once.

I’ve been going to class this last week, always keeping some sort of weapon to protect myself.

I just hope I never see that black Highlander again.",1,1749175469.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

One of my teammates gave me some smarties which made me feel way better. However, we were mid transport, those smarties took about 30 min to wear off after which I went right back into hypo-town. This time my BGL was 57. I downed a PB-J and a redbull (from the EMS lounge). 50 minutes later back at base and my BGL is low 70's, however this time I'm not symptomatic. This was the start of it all. 

Several weeks went by before it happened again. This day was so routine that I couldn't tell you anything special about it aside from my BGL being in the 50's. Pre-work gym, protein shake w/ tons of fruit, coffee w/ cream, Einstein bagel w/ cream chz, then off to work. That's my usual routine. 

As time has passes, the episodes seem to be getting more frequent. The other evening, after a whole day of working outside (but maintaining good hydration and food) I was pumping gas when I felt it start to creep. This one was bad. I rushed home to find a BGL of 41, and I looked it. Taking my BGL and then chugging a bunch of OJ I kind of felt like Nick Cage and the end of The Rock when he laid on the floor after he stabbed himself in the heart with the atropine needle. I did the things and ate the food and it resolved. 

Today at work in the afternoon (food/exercise all routine) I felt the creep and found a BGL of 71; however, this was probably 30 minutes after I'd eaten a salad w/ dressing, water, yogurt, and a few swigs of a Dr. Pepper. My BGL shouldn't be 71. Whelp we got a call so I whipped up a road sandwich (wheat bread, turkey, cheeze, mayo, mustard, lettuce, pickle) and went on my way. 2 hours later in the EMS lounge my BGL is 61, Im mildly symptomatic WTF?!?! 

Tomorrow, my PCP is throwing the kitchen sink at me with regard to testing, so I'm sure some answers will come. Until I get those answers, I'm seeking advice on what kind of food to eat and when. I've never had to think about keeping a complex or simple carb nearby if I'm going on a 2 hour drive. I work out in the mornings and am up and about for the rest of the day. I don't care about macros in the fitness sense, but is there some algorithm for macros when your pancreas is on ecstasy?    ",1,1749175443.0,diabetes,6,1.0,False

1l4gruc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/1l4gruc/tony_awards_things_to_remember/,TONY AWARDS | Things to remember...,"If your algorithm is anything like mine then you've been inundated with Tony predictions across all of social media. I have been doing a lot of traveling this week and I've been listening and watching these predictions as I fly from coast to coast.

I have seen a number of things that keep popping up and I want to just point some things out that keep running through my head as I watch these predictions. Most of these \*reminders\* are things that apply year after year, but some are 24/25 specific.

**- VOTERS DO NOT COORDINATE**  
I keep hearing people say something along these lines... ""voters are going to want to give X show some recognition, and I think they will do that in category ABC, since category 123 is a little tougher.""

A specific example? Saying ""Voters are going to want to award RWHC, but best score is too hard of a category, so they will do that in Best Featured Actress."" Another specific example? ""Voters are going to want to recognize Cole Escola's work, but since he wrote the play, they will voter for him for Best Lead Actor and then feel free to vote for (fill in blank) for Best Play.""

This all sounds GREAT if the winners were chosen by committee with open discussion and multiple rounds of open voting. I mean, even then this is pretty high-level coordination, but the idea that there is this unspoken agreement that a certain show NEEDS recognition, but only in one category and that specific category is XYZ, rather than ABC, and voters all agree on this, even though it's not discussed, and will vote accordingly, is pretty far fetched.

People vote for what they like and that's what wins. Sure, some voters may want to share the love in some strategic way, but everyone's strategic sharing is different and it all washes out at the end.

**- DO NOT OVER COMPLICATE IT**  
This goes hand in hand with the above statement. While we all remember the surprise Tony, Oscar, Grammy, or Emmy win, the VAST majority of categories year after year after year after year go to the favorite, the one that was always the favorite.   
  
And the only reason it might feel like a surprise is because we fill the void in the weeks leading up to the award show with all of these complicated conspiracy theories about this and that changing people's votes. Blah Blah Blah.

Go back and look at every award show. The VAST majority of the time the consensus favorite to win in the month leading up to the award show is the one that wins. It might not be that exciting, but most things in life aren't.

In other words, Maybe Happy Ending is going to win big. Oh, Mary is going to win big.

**- EACH CATEGORY WILL HAVE WILDLY DIFFERENT VOTERS**  
I am not talking about the technical awards that have tech specific voters (sound, orchestration), I am talking about all of the categories. Remember, voters can only vote in categories where they have seen all of the shows/performances. Which means some categories will have MANY more voters than others.  
  
For example, to be eligible to vote for Best Actress in a Musical you have had to see four shows (Sunset Blvd, Gypsy, Boop, and Death Becomes Her). Four big and popular shows. Four shows that are currently running.

To be eligible to vote for Best Actor in a Musical you have had to see six shows (Sunset, MHE, Dead Outlaw, Just in Time, Floyd Collins, and Wonderful World), one of which is no longer running, so if you missed it earlier in the year, you can't vote in this category.

This is an issue for categories when there are nominees from closed shows, because voters can't cram then in at the very end to be eligible. Best Musical and Best Musical Revival will have MANY more voters voting than something like Best Revival of a Play since all of those plays are closed, and they closed at different times during the last season, which will make the eligible pool small.  
  
**- THE PATTI DRAMA IS NOT AN ISSUE**  
I had a dozen meetings the last few weeks in New York and they were all with Tony voters, we talked about everything and the one consistent thing that came up time after time after time was that no one is actually following the drama and NO ONE is voting based on it.

These were voters who were currently working in the industry, so they're busy getting shows ready, getting special events ready, and getting early workshops going. I was blown away by how few of these people actually knew the details of the drama. 

I am not suggesting it was not an important issue for the community and the larger discussion of race and decorum. But few people were paying as close attention to it as the perpetually online, no one really seemed to care about it, and it definitely didn't change anyone's opinion on who they were voting for.

Hear me out.... don't you find it a bit demeaning to suggest that Audra McDonald might win Best Actress in a Musical because the voters were so appalled by some out of pocket statement made by Patti, who has since apologized, that they CHANGED THEIR VOTE to Audra out of pity for the poor woman... ?

I mean, what a weird thing to say. And MANY of you are saying it.

We still don't know who is going to win, but if Audra does it is purely because of her hard work and talent, not due to some secondhand pity vote.

These voters are professionals and most aren't even paying attention to the drama, and even if they are, they're not going to let that change their vote. But I hear it over and over again, yet not a single person knows a single voter who has suggested that is the case.

And then to think that it extends to Best Revival is even more absurd. So what's the thinking, Sunset Blvd was going to win, but enough Tony voters were so harmed by a statement from Patti, who is not involved in Sunset, that they changed their opinion on which was the better show (Gypsy/Sunset) because of some third and fourth hand connection between Patti and Sunset?

You guys. Put the conspiracy map and string away. If Gypsy wins it is because it was always going to win. If Sunset wins it is because it was always going to win. Same with Audra, Same with Nicole, Same with Jasmine. (Sorry Megan, Jennifer, Pirates, and Floyd Collins, it isn't your year.)

But let's not demean any win by saying it was a result of voters feeling sorry for them rather than a response to their performance/show.

**- VOTING TIMING MATTERS**  
Everyone is so obsessed with who has momentum RIGHT NOW. But MANY MANY MANY voters submitted their votes a month ago. Voting is open for more than a months time and many folks came in for various press events early in May. Then they voted.

What I found over and over again with voters is that it was considered a job. They dragged themselves to ALL of the shows, even if they weren't interested in the subject matter, and got their voting done early so they wouldn't forget.

They aren't huddling around Reddit, X, Instagram, and the various message boards waiting for the most recent gossip and rumor and voting at the very last second to make sure they had all of the information. LOL!

Voters have jobs, many have families, most have voted year after year after year and they aren't as wrapped up in the minutia as the perpetually online.

And I am not yucking anyone's yum. Look, I am posting some long post about the Tonys and I will post my predictions this weekend, so I am definitely in the ""hyper focused on the awards"" camp. But please know that most of the voters are not.

In one day I literally had lunch with three voters and they all said they voted for Sunset for Best Revival, they were turned off by the video elements and thought ""the walk"" was gimmicky, but they appreciated the bold decisions, even if they didn't like result. But that was enough to get them to vote for it.

THAT NIGHT I had dinner with another voter who told me they voted for Gypsy, but they didn't like the production, they felt it looked like a community theater production with cheap sets. They liked Sunset, Pirates, and Floyd C, but they still voted for Gypsy because ""THE SHOW"" Gypsy is so burned into their Theater DNA that even though they didn't love the production, they could never vote against Gypsy. It was almost sacrilegious.

I had coffee with another voter who told me they didn't really find the humor in ""Oh, Mary"" all that funny. It just didn't click for them (they recognized they were in the minority, but they were just being honest), but they told me they were still voting for it because they were a lifelong theater professional and their partner used to do cabaret professionally and they found the handful ""cabaret vs theater"" jokes in Oh, Mary to be relatable to their situation. So that was enough to vote for it, even though they didn't find the play very good or funny.

LOL!

Bottom line, this is what you hear when you share a meal or coffee with Tony voters. Not ""I was going to vote for Nicole, but switched to Audra because Patti was mean to Kecia."" LOL! And most voted a month ago and their only thought for the Tonys was what they were going to wear (for those going) and where they were going to watch it (for those staying home).

\----

All of that is to say that trying to read the tea leaves for these big award shows is a lot of fun and people love to consume it, so keep it up! But know that most of the parsing is just fluff. Actual voters aren't coordinating consciously or subconsciously to be strategic with their voting to spread the love. Every category will have a different pool of voters based on how easy it is/was to see the shows/performances nominated. Online gossipy/drama doesn't effect how voters vote, they take the task seriously and vote for what they like. Yes, an effective campaign can help win a Tony, but all of the sideshow stuff its just noise.

The speculating and predicting is a lot of fun and I am grateful for the hours of entertainment they've brought me as I've logged in my travel miles. But if you're really interested in how these things work, they're really never as sexy or intriguing as folks want to make them out to be.

I have been staying at Hilton, Double Tree, and Hampton Inn properties ever since the '80s when I would travel with my parents as a kid.  They had friendly staff, clean facilities, and good restaurants.  But recently (since 2021 or so), they have gone downhill.  The staff are rude and barely acknowledge you, the front desk people are too busy looking at their phones, and when they finally talk to you, they act like the staff at the DMV.  They throw you a chewed-up key card and you have to lug all your bags up to your room because the bellhop is out on his smoke break.  The room smells, and the AC sounds like a jet engine, but despite that, the room stays hot all night.   The showers don't have hot water, there is hair in the sink, rats running around, and condom wrappers in the trash that housekeeping apparently didn't notice.  Housekeeping never comes to clean your room, but they leave the envelopes and QR codes for you to ""tip"" them for their work, or the lack thereof.  When you order room service, it never comes, but they still charge you for it, and then refuse to remove the charge.

My fiancé and I found this gorgeous top-floor apartment, with high windows and an ocean view. We were both romantics, and he told me that the sound of the waves helped him sleep. So we pooled our savings and bought it together as a wedding gift to each other. But most nights, while I snuggled against his chest, the water crashed over and over in my ear, keeping me wide awake. It’s hard to complain, though, when the view got hundreds of likes on social media.

I was still groggy when morning came. We clutched our hot paper cups and went out for a walk. Barefoot, just to spend some quality time before lunch. The beach was empty except for one jogger with his dog. He wore a yellow overall; I could’ve mistaken him for a Teletubby, but he’s our neighbor, so we waved back.

Cold briny air tousled our hair, it was a beautiful day except for the clouds. Streaks of gray crossed the sky; wet sands sucked our feet, and that’s when I saw it.

A fish.

I thought it was stained glass at first. Red, blue, green, orange fins, shimmering. How pretty! It flopped on the sand, its mouth gaping, opening and closing. So I sipped my coffee, dumped the rest, and scooped the fish gently into my cup then filled it with seawater. 

My fiancé grinned at me, his dimple deepening. “Oh, we got our first pet,” he said. “I thought it’d be a puppy.”

“Yup. Isn’t it pretty?” I beamed back at him, slipped my hand into his, and the three of us walked home.

He prepped our brunch, just a quick sandwich, while I washed out the pickle jar; poured in the seawater from the cup, then I added the fish. It swam around. Alive, thankfully. So I nipped a corner of my sandwich and sprinkled in the bread crumbs. But the fish let them sink and watched me instead. Fish don’t have eyelids, right? But there was something ominous in those glaring yellow beads; I lost my appetite because of it.

So I moved the jar to the coffee table. Later, I told myself, I’d release it back into the sea. But when my fiancé had his last bite, the fish had tripled to the size of a lemon; almost filling the jar.

“That’s weird,” my fiancé said.

“Right?”

“But it’s our first pet,” he said. “And I’m curious. Will it keep growing if we put it in the tub?”

“Nah, we might kill it if it’s not seawater. Let’s just release it—”

But the fish thrashed, slamming against the glass; it fell and shattered. My fiancé hurried to clean up the shards as I scooped the fish; heavy like a grapefruit, as if it had absorbed the water, and I rushed it to the bathroom. 

I let the tap run, and the water rose slowly, submerging its flopping body. I washed my slippery hands of its smell; it swam around the tub, flashing its colors like stained glass.

“How pretty.” I reached in and caressed it; the fish seemed to enjoy my touch. Ack! It bit me. I yanked my finger; blood welled up to the size of a needle pin, and I instinctively sucked it. The fish grinned at me. It really did! I wasn’t imagining it. Those rows of tiny, sharp teeth made me bolt out in panic.

“What’s wrong?” my fiancé asked me as he crouched over to reach a piece of shard.

“Nothing,” I said. “Let’s return it to the sea.”

He stood up to examine my wound. “Yeah… let’s get a puppy.”

I smiled at his joke, and we carried the fish down in a bucket. Pretty heavy, as its size kept expanding. But once we tipped it into the waves, that was it. No more fishy problems.

I high-fived my fiancé, and we returned home, finally getting the chance to focus on our wedding. I rechecked the guest list twice and confirmed the RSVPs until my phone turned warm in my grasp. I took a break and browsed for any information about the pretty, stained-glass-colored fish. But there wasn’t any. The only image that matched my description came from a fantasy site. The illustration was hand-drawn and looked clumsy; I had to chuckle. It also said that the fish was the temporary form of a merman prince. So I ignored it.

Life moved on, and everything returned to normal… or I wished it had.

The following day, I rang my new neighbor's apartment, as it might’ve been rude if we hadn't invite him. I waited, but no one came. So I slipped the invitation into his letterbox by the door; he might’ve gone jogging with his dog.

But when my fiancé and I went down, yellow do-not-cross tapes were all over the porch of the apartment complex. The police line warded off the crowd of people, and at the center of it, my neighbor’s dog wailed at someone wrapped in blankets. Murky red stained the surface. That was my neighbor! I turned around and squirmed, hiding my face against my fiancé’s chest. The only witness, a passerby who also lived in one of the units, stood a few feet from the victim, seemed traumatized to the point he couldn’t move, or answer the investigator coherently.

I asked around, “What happened?”

The pale-faced woman I spoke to shrugged. “Someone robbed the poor soul, but the thief passed on his wallet or phone, just his clothes and…” She couldn’t finish her sentence.

How horrible! Who would do such a thing? But my fiancé and I didn’t ask the question out loud, only exchanged glances. We didn’t walk far that day and returned home; we felt uneasy. Why would anyone want someone else’s sweaty overalls? And I heard he also lost his… legs? The assailant’s sadistic method freaked out the entire complex. Even from where I lived, I looked down through the window glass and saw people dragging their suitcases away from the building.

“Babe,” I said to my fiancé after a long silence, “should we sell this apartment? What do you think?”

“Let’s wait a bit. When the developer builds a shopping complex, maybe the price will go back up, then we’ll put it on the market.”

I nodded, and the question lingered; but our big day arrived, and it was too late to change anything. A warm breeze tousled the drapes of the makeshift altar, as we had opted to exchange our vows by the sea. 

Let’s just get through today, I convinced myself. 

It was a sunny day when we got married; the weather forecast got it right. The guests, close family members and friends, had not uttered a single complaint. My man and I sealed our lips about the recent incident, as we didn’t want to scare anyone. They seemed to know something, but smiled back anyway. Sand slipped into their shoes, my mother’s shawl fluttered in the wind.
 
Everyone cheered as I passed them in a white gown. The tulle folds made it heavy, but hey, I only get to wear it once. It was so pretty, I couldn’t choose another. Then my man and I faced each other, everything felt right and we were about to kiss, but suddenly a wave crashed into the shore, followed by an eerie, high-pitched shriek; we turned to the sea instead.

Then I saw it; the fish.

I just knew that it was our ex-pet, even if it resembled a human, with a head, neck, torso, and limbs. Though the red, blue, and green scales hadn’t changed, still covering ‘his’ skin. But what scared me the most was his clothes: the yellow jogging overall that belonged to my neighbor. Then my man’s back blocked most of my view; I muffled my scream when I caught a glimpse of the creature’s face. It was my neighbor’s! Grinning at me, with those rows of tiny, sharp teeth. 

Everyone stood to ward it off as ‘he’ kept advancing. Folded chairs scattered, their ribbons and fabric covers littered the shore; shouts and screams, while my aunts carried their kids away. It was chaotic.

Then the day turned dark; everyone looked aside and screamed. A tidal wave overshadowed us, and we stumbled to the building. Some tripped on the sand, but we pulled each other up. My steps caught on my gown; I fell, and my cheek met the sand. Some grit getting into my ear along with the shriek, mixing with growls, harsher than the crashing waves I’d heard every night. It came after me, and someone pulled me up, but its grip was slippery. I didn’t dare to face it, but I recognized the fishy smell.

The smell was diluted by the crashing waves that pulled me with ‘him’. It hurt less than I thought, somehow I felt light in the creature’s embrace. I still wouldn’t open my eyes and hold my breath. What now? I thought, as I was about to die. 

“How pretty.”

I heard ‘him,’ not a shriek or a growl, but close to how I once said it. Seawater seeped into my nose, as I tried to hold my breath. But I could only do so for so long, and I choked on saltwater as I tried to escape ‘his’ clutch. It was slippery, and I almost made it, but the heavy wedding dress stunned my movement. I couldn’t swim up.

Familiar hands, my husband’s, wrapped around me and kicked ‘him.’ Then I felt the ripping fabric of my gown; finally I could swim with everything I had. Up. I reached the shore and crawled, pushing all the water out, but my husband grabbed my arm and together we ran.

Time passed. It was nighttime, and we found ourselves in the ER waiting room. Uncle had a cardiac arrest, so we had to rush him to the hospital. The whole family was present, but no one talked about what we saw. My husband’s jacket was draped over my shoulders, and my mother had wrapped her shawl around my waist. A kind soul from the wedding organizer team boxed our supposed gala dinner and delivered it to us. We all ate in silence until we received the news that Uncle had survived the night.

Whenever anyone asked what happened, we answered, “It was the bad weather.” Except for my young cousin who said, “A sea monster!” between her sobs. Then my aunt would take her out for a walk.

Yeah, of course it was the bad weather. A merman wrecking a wedding wouldn’t make sense. Who would’ve believed it? We couldn’t let rumors tarnish our reputation, that the whole family had lost their marbles.

But we knew the truth.

We bid everyone goodbye, went home and moved on.

We got married and still had to stay at the place, since its price had dropped. No, it was a free fall. So it’ll take some time before we can sell it. We adopted my neighbor’s dog, as it had an attachment to the place too.

It wasn’t a perfect situation, but the view still looked like a living painting. Every night, when I snuggled against my husband’s chest, he‘d sleep soundly. But the waves never stopped crashing and kept calling me, “Pretty.” 

So I got up. How could I sleep? I just had to write about it. If there’s a pretty fish lying helplessly on the shore, please don't take it home.

Because the merman is not your friend.

1l4gi5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/vidanta/comments/1l4gi5o/review_of_grand_mayan_rivera_maya/,Review of Grand Mayan Rivera Maya,"Just spent 4 nights/5 days. We bought this trip at a charity auction. Although we travel a lot, this was our first time to Cancun. 
I will break down categories :
TRAVEL
We connect through an airport on the east coast . Shorter flights than other places we have gone. Taxi takes about 35 minutes, you can expect to pay $70-$100.  We arrived on a Monday and flew through customs. 
ROOM
We stayed in building seven, we got a connecting 2 bedroom suite with a plunge pool and jacuzzis in each room. The main suite had a mini kitchen. We did not cook but made coffee. Regular drip coffee no keurig. 
Laundry is on the second floor, you get tokens. 
TRANSPORTATION 
There are golf carts to shuttle you around the resort. You should expect to walk a good deal. Paths are stunning and covered from the sun with trees. 
MONEY 
Everything gets charged to your room. Bring small bills to tip. I would say it is expected. I don’t mind tipping and a used to this from other trips to other resorts. 
TIME SHARE HARD SELL
The check in process is brutal. If you get in before 3 pack a backpack with bathing suit etc, you will not be in your room until 3-5. During check in they try to hard sell you sitting through a presentation the next day. I literally said “this is my only Vacation and I am not going to spend it listening to a sales pitch for 3 hours”. They will continue to push and try to offer discounts. If it’s your thing it might be worth  it. 
ENTERTAINMENT 
The water park is great and “reasonably” priced. The food is not great but to be expected. Be aware the thrill rides have a height requirement that my 6 year old did not meet. Gorgeous golf course that we didn’t use. Many many pools.  Never felt crowded.  We did an excursion to isla muejeres - we did not book it through the resort. Any questions pm me.

Avery Ice water crashed over my bed, jerking me from another nightmare-filled sleep. My body seized from the shock, my vision going dark as I gasped for breath. For a terrifying moment, everything went silent except for the high-pitched ringing in my ears. You really thought you could sleep in, you little bitch? Before I could even process what was happening, fingers tangled in my hair, yanking me from my soaked mattress and throwing me to the cold concrete floor. My head smacked against the ground, sending stars across my vision. Eva stood over me, her petite frame somehow looming large in the dim light of the slave quarters. Perfect makeup highlighted her doll-like features, her tiny red dress already prepared for the day ahead. The look of disgust on her face was one I knew all too well. You don't deserve peaceful sleep,"" she spat, digging the pointed toe of her stiletto into my ribs. ""Not after killing your own parents. God, you're pathetic. I lay there like a slab of meat, waiting for the inevitable. Eva crouched down, her manicured nails scraping across my exposed skin as she violently ripped at my already threadbare shirt. Let's see how you try to seduce Kevin with these,"" she hissed, her sharp nails digging into the flesh of my nipples, breaking the skin. Blood welled up around her fingertips as she dragged them down. ""I'll destroy these fucking tits. Then we'll see if you still think you're his mate. The pain was excruciating, but I didn't cry out. I'd learned long ago that showing pain only made everything worse. Instead, I closed my eyes, hoping to find some escape in the darkness behind my eyelids. My tears had dried up months ago. My body felt frighteningly weak beneath her assault. Each blow sent waves of dizziness through me, and I wondered if this time might be the end. Was I gonna die? I felt myself slipping toward unconsciousness, floating at the edge of awareness. An eternity later, the blows stopped. Eva's footsteps echoed as she walked away, satisfied with her morning ritual. I forced my eyes open, immediately locking gazes with a passing servant girl. The revulsion on her face was unmistakable as she quickly looked away and hurried past. I lay in a heap on the floor, my shirt hanging in tatters around me, exposing skin even my nipples mottled with fresh bruises layered atop older ones in varying shades of purple, green, and yellow. Not an inch of my body remained unmarked by Eva's regular ""attention. Closing my eyes again, I refused to acknowledge the servants passing by. They wouldn't help. Nobody ever did. As if this kind of humiliating behavior was normal and common. With trembling arms, I pushed myself up from the ground, nearly collapsing again as my muscles screamed in protest. I couldn't afford to rest, not even for a minute. If I failed to complete my chores, what awaited would be far worse than Eva's morning greeting. I stumbled to the single wooden chest that contained my only other shirt—equally worn but at least not soaking wet and torn to shreds. As I changed, I nervously glanced around the room. The other slaves continued their morning routines, faces carefully blank. This scene played out nearly every day. No one had the energy or will to care anymore. Our quarters were barely habitable—a damp, moldy basement with cracked walls where weeds pushed through in places. Insects skittered across the floor, drawn to the perpetual dampness. Each slave had just a thin wooden plank raised slightly off the ground as a bed, with threadbare blankets that did almost nothing against the constant chill. Mine was even thinner than the others, thanks to Eva's special treatment. A single ray of sunlight managed to penetrate our underground prison through a tiny window near the ceiling. By some miracle, it fell directly across my face, offering a momentary warmth that felt like the gentlest touch. I closed my eyes, savoring the brief respite. If only last month hadn't happened that...Flash Back: One Month Before The night air was cool against my skin as I finished scrubbing the last of the kitchen floors. My muscles ached from another endless day of labor, but something made me pause as I dumped the dirty water outside.

A scent.

I'd never smelled anything like it before—sweet vanilla mingled with something earthier, like sun-warmed grass. The aroma tugged at something deep inside me, drawing me forward despite my exhaustion.

I followed it, step by hesitant step, away from the compound and toward the edge of the forest.

The trees loomed dark and mysterious, their branches creating intricate patterns against the starlit sky. The scent grew stronger, pulling me deeper into the woods.



My heart pounded in my chest. I'd overheard the other servants whispering about this—how when you meet your true mate, you detect a unique, intoxicating scent that no one else can quite describe. Some smelled vanilla, others lavender, still others the rich earthiness of forest soil.



Could this be happening to me? My face flushed hot with excitement and hope. I didn't have a wolf—how could I possibly have a mate? But the scent was undeniable, growing stronger with each step I took.



As I moved deeper into the forest, following that irresistible trail, a strange sensation began to build in my chest. At first, it was just warmth, but it quickly transformed into something else—something painful. A burning ache spread from my heart outward, as though someone had thrust a hot poker through my ribs.



The closer I got to the source of the scent, the more intense the pain became. It felt like a wolf was tearing through my chest cavity, shredding everything in its path. Was this normal? Was this what finding your mate felt like?



My steps grew smaller, more hesitant. I pressed a hand against a nearby tree, its rough bark cool against my burning skin, providing momentary relief.



Dizzy and disoriented, I clutched my chest with one hand while using the other to steady myself against the trees as I continued forward. The forest was eerily quiet, until it wasn't.



A woman's moan broke the silence, followed by a deep, masculine growl.



Had I imagined it? The pain in my chest was making it hard to think clearly.







**Chapter 2: I, The Beta Of The Blood Moon Pack, Reject You As My Fated Mate!**



Avery

I pushed forward, following both the scent and now the sounds, until I reached a small clearing bathed in moonlight. What I saw there froze the blood in my veins.

My enemy girl Eva was completely naked, straddling Kevin—our pack's Beta—as she rode him with wild abandon. Her hands were tangled in his wet hair, her head thrown back in ecstasy.

Despite the cool night, their bodies glistened with sweat in the moonlight.

""Fuck, Kevin, you feel so goddamn good,"" she moaned, grinding her hips against him. ""Tell me who you belong to.""

You,"" he groaned, his hands gripping her hips so tightly I could see his fingers digging into her flesh. The rose tattoo on her thigh seemed to dance with each movement, while the skull tattoos on his muscular arms flexed with his every motion. ""Fuck, Eva, only you.""

That's right,"" she purred, leaning down to bite his lip hard enough to draw blood.

I clamped my hand over my mouth so hard my nails dug into my skin, drawing blood. I couldn't make a sound. Couldn't let them know I was there.

But the pain in my chest was crippling now, making it impossible to run away. All I could do was hide behind the massive oak tree and witness the desecration of what should have been sacred.

Why, Moon Goddess?\* I silently pleaded. \*Why would you make him my mate if he belongs to her? Why torment me like this?\*

I slid down the trunk until I was curled into a ball on the forest floor, silent tears streaming down my face.

Each thrust, each moan sent fresh waves of agony through my body. The connection between mates meant I could physically feel his pleasure—pleasure he was experiencing with someone else.

Their passionate encounter seemed to last forever. Eventually, the obscene sounds subsided, replaced by tender whispers and soft laughter. Eva snuggled into Kevin's arms, nuzzling her small nose against his neck.

Kevin was smiling contentedly, eyes half-closed—until suddenly they shot open wide with shock.



He sniffed the air, his entire body tensing. When he spoke, his voice was rough with disbelief.



""Mine!""



Eva's face twisted with confusion, her perfect features scrunching up as she stared at Kevin. ""What did you say, babe?""



Kevin didn't even acknowledge her. His chest heaved with rapid breaths, nostrils flaring wide as he sniffed the air. His eyes narrowed to dangerous slits.



""Who is there?"" he growled, voice dropping to a guttural register that made my blood freeze in my veins.



I pressed my trembling body harder against the oak tree, praying to the Moon Goddess that the shadows would swallow me whole. My legs shook so violently I could barely remain standing. The burning pain in my chest was overwhelming, making it hard to even think straight.



Kevin's jaw clenched, muscles in his neck straining as he rose to his feet, completely naked and unashamed. ""My fist won't wait patiently for you to come out. I'm giving you three seconds! If you don't show your fucking face, I'll kill you myself!""



The cold brutality in his voice made me whimper involuntarily. This was my mate? This cruel, heartless monster who'd just been with another woman? The connection between us pulsed painfully, like an open wound being salted.



Eva scrambled to grab her tiny dress, panic written all over her face. ""What? There's someone fucking watching us?"" She looked around wildly, trying to cover herself. ""Who the hell is out there?""



Kevin yanked on his jeans but left them unbuttoned, his sculpted torso still gleaming with sweat in the moonlight. The skulls tattooed across his muscular arms seemed to grin at me mockingly.



""Five seconds have passed already! You still not planning to come out?"" His black eyes glittered with predatory coldness, scanning the treeline. I knew he could sense exactly where I was hiding.



Fighting through waves of nausea and pain, I clutched my chest and forced myself to stand. My legs felt like they might buckle at any moment. Taking a deep breath that felt like inhaling broken glass, I stepped out from behind the tree.



Eva's eyes widened dramatically, her perfectly plucked eyebrows shooting up toward her hairline. ""Look who we have here!"" she spat, venom dripping from every word. ""What's the murderer doing out here spying on us, you fucking—""



Before she could finish, Kevin cut her off with a raised hand. His black eyes locked onto mine, and I saw nothing there—no warmth, no recognition, no bond. Just cold, empty hatred.



""I, Kevin, Beta of the Blood Moon Pack, reject you, Avery, a slave of the Blood Moon, as my fated mate and future wife!""



Each word was like a physical blow. His face contorted with disgust as he spoke, as if my very existence revolted him. The ceremonial rejection words hung in the air between us, heavy and final.



As the last syllable left his lips, blinding pain erupted inside me. It felt like someone had taken a sledgehammer to my ribcage, pulverizing my organs from the inside out. My knees gave way as I collapsed to the forest floor, gasping for breath that wouldn't come.



Kevin, wholly unmoved by my suffering, turned back to Eva. He pulled her against his chest, his hands roaming possessively over her body as he whispered something in her ear that made her giggle. He began kissing her neck, working his way down her body while staring directly at me, making sure I witnessed every touch.



Eva met my gaze over Kevin's shoulder, her eyes gleaming with triumph. ""You better run along now,"" she moaned deliberately, arching her back as Kevin's mouth found her nipples and bite it. ""You'd better pray you don't... \*mmm\*... run into us in the pack... oh god, babe..."" The last part was directed at Kevin, who had begun to focus his attention on her again.



I couldn't move, couldn't tear my eyes away from the horrific scene. 



Kevin glanced at me sidelong, his black eyes like bottomless pits. As his finger continued fucking Eva's snatch, he flashed me a smile that belonged on a demon—cruel, taunting, and utterly pitiless.







**Chapter 3: Is Today My Death Day?**

Avery

With Eva's moans as background, something inside me finally snapped. Despite my weakened state, I scrambled to my feet and ran. The mate bond had been severed by his rejection, at least enough that their renewed passion no longer caused me physical pain. My body felt hollow, emptied of everything but raw grief.

I ran without direction, stumbling over roots and rocks, branches whipping against my face and arms. Each footfall was unsteady, my vision blurred by tears and pain. Several times I nearly fell, my ankle twisting painfully as I stepped into a hidden hole or tripped over a fallen branch.

Finally, my legs simply gave out. I fell hard, face first into the dirt, and this time, I had no strength left to rise. What was the point? My mate—the one person the Moon Goddess had chosen specifically for me—had rejected me with disgust and hatred.

So I lay there in the cool earth, the smell of dirt and fresh grass filling my nostrils, and I wept. I cried until my throat was raw and my voice reduced to a raspy whisper. I cried until there was nothing left inside me.

End Of Flash Back...

The earthy scent of soil and grass was still vivid in my memory as my feet carried me mindlessly toward the kitchen area. The rich aroma of breakfast foods wafted through the air—bacon sizzling, bread baking, coffee brewing—smells that would never be meant for me.

I watched as servants carried out trays loaded with steaming food: fluffy scrambled eggs, perfectly cooked bacon, stacks of pancakes drizzled with maple syrup, and fresh fruit arranged artfully on fine china plates. My stomach responded with a loud, painful growl, reminding me that I hadn't eaten since yesterday morning.

Without thinking, I paused, my tongue involuntarily running across my dry, cracked lips as saliva flooded my mouth. For a moment, I was lost in the fantasy of what it would be like to eat such a meal, to feel full and satisfied for once.

That's when I heard it.

""Where the fuck is she?""

The Beta's enraged voice cut through the kitchen's pleasant sounds like a knife. I knew immediately that Beta Kevin—my former mate—was looking for me.

In this house, there was only one person designated to serve both the Alpha and Beta exclusively—me. They had arranged it this way deliberately to torment me, the Alpha's sister and the person who had supposedly killed our parents with her own hands.

Their goal was to make me suffer without allowing me the mercy of death.

With a groan, I shifted the cleaning basket I carried and turned toward the sound of his voice.

The moment Beta Kevin spotted me, he stormed over, his face twisted with rage. Without warning, his hand slashed across my cheek with brutal force. The impact was so powerful that my right ear instantly went deaf, a high-pitched ringing replacing all sound.

I staggered but didn't fall. I'd learned long ago that falling only invited more attacks. Blood trickled from the corner of my mouth as I kept my eyes downcast, waiting for whatever would come next.



I stood frozen, not making a sound. Years of experience had taught me that silence was survival—speak only when spoken to, or risk being beaten to a pulp.



I definitely didn't need another week in the dungeon, a place more terrifying than even the basement. Every time I made a mistake, that's where they'd lock me up—sometimes for hours, sometimes half a day, once for an entire half-month.



The strangest part was always waking up with needle marks alongside my bruises and wounds. Once, I even noticed green liquid around the puncture sites. What the hell were they injecting me with? I never got answers, only more pain.



So I just trembled in place, waiting for Kevin to speak first, clutching my cleaning basket like it might somehow shield me from whatever was coming.



""Well, look what the fucking cat dragged in,"" Kevin's voice sliced through the silence. His black eyes raked over me, lingering on the places where my threadbare shirt failed to hide my skin. ""The Alpha's pathetic excuse for a sister.""



I kept my eyes down, focusing on the tiles beneath my feet. One cracked, three whole, two with stains. I'd memorized every imperfection in this floor.



""What's wrong, little wolfless? Cat got your tongue?"" He stepped closer, the leather of his jacket creaking as he moved. ""Or are you just too stupid to form words?""



I flinched when his hand shot out, grabbing my chin and forcing my face up. His touch burned against my skin.



""Answer me when I speak to you,"" he growled, his face inches from mine.



""I'm sorry, Beta Kevin,"" I whispered, the words automatic, rehearsed from countless similar encounters.



He snorted, his eyes narrowing. ""Look at you. Dressed like you've been digging through garbage."" His fingers trailed down my neck, across my collarbone, casual and possessive. ""Though I guess that's all Trevor thinks you're worth.""



My heart hammered against my ribs as his hand dipped lower, brushing over my breast. I bit my lip hard enough to taste blood, fighting to stay still.



""Not that you'd know how to dress properly anyway. Pathetic little bitch."" His lips curled into a cruel smile before he spat directly in my face.



I didn't wipe it away. I couldn't. Moving without permission would only make things worse.



""What's this?"" Kevin's interest suddenly sharpened. He grabbed the hem of my shirt and yanked it up without warning, exposing my torso to the cold air. ""Well, well, what have we here?""



My chest was covered in angry red scratch marks—Eva's handiwork. Some were deep enough to have drawn blood, now dried in dark crimson streaks across my pale skin. The fresher ones still glistened slightly.



""Fuck,"" Kevin breathed, his pupils dilating as he stared at the marks. ""Eva's been playing rough with you again, hasn't she?"" His thumb traced one of the scratches, pressing just hard enough to make me wince.



Something shifted in his expression—a dangerous hunger replacing the casual cruelty. Despite having rejected me as his mate, his body was responding to mine. I could smell the change in him, that sharp musk of arousal cutting through his usual scent.



""You know,"" he said, voice dropping lower, ""just because I didn't want you as my mate doesn't mean you're completely useless.""



His hand slid up to cup my breast roughly, fingers digging into the soft flesh. ""Maybe I should remind you what you're actually good for.""



""Please don't,"" I whispered, panic rising in my throat.



Kevin's face darkened. ""Did I fucking ask what you wanted?"" He shoved me backward until I hit the counter, pinning me there with his body.

I’ve lived in different cities, countries, and cultures, and I think that’s made me someone who listens first, observes, and speaks with intention. When I join a new team, I don’t jump in right away trying to stand out. I ask questions, get a feel for how people interact, and slowly figure out how to navigate different personalities, especially when it comes to leadership.



My current job is one I genuinely like. The office culture is generally positive, the benefits are great, and I enjoy going in most days. Sure, there are things I don’t love, like how my boss sometimes doesn’t give credit or doesn’t give me enough work, but I’ve found ways to navigate that by collaborating on other projects with other teams. Overall, I see this job as a good chapter in a longer story. I don’t plan to stay forever, but for now, it’s helping me grow.



Now to the part I’m struggling with.



When I first joined, I was told by the person who held this role before me that I “had to vouch for myself.” She was very outspoken, someone who made herself known from day one. I’ve always taken a different approach. I like to observe, understand team dynamics, and figure out who I can be open with before jumping in. When I speak, it’s intentional. But lately I’m wondering if that quiet, intentional style is working against me.



This week in a company-wide meeting with our CEO and the broader team, one coworker asked a question that honestly baffled me. It was something very basic, something you’d ideallly address in a one-on-one, not in front of the entire company. To me, it lacked critical thinking. Yet, she was praised simply for speaking up. This same person frequently complains about the job, the team, the work, everything. I try to stay balanced, I acknowledge what’s frustrating but also what’s working. I don’t want to be consumed by negativity.



After that meeting, we went for coffee with another colleague, and she went on and on complaining again. It’s exhausting. I kept wondering: why is she so liked? Why is her constant noise valued more than quiet consistency or thoughtful contribution?



I’ve been reflecting on whether my quietness is being misinterpreted. I’m not disengaged, I’m just intentional. But in environments that reward volume over value, that can feel like a disadvantage. I’m not sure if I should start pushing myself to speak more, even when I don’t have something meaningful to say, just to be seen.



So here’s my question:

Have any of you experienced this tension between being thoughtful and being visible? Between staying grounded and being “outspoken”? Is it maybe that I can’t hold space for someone like that?",2,1749173778.0,WorkAdvice,0,1.0,False

In SEA region I took mine for first 3 monthly or 3,000kms service and was surprised with the quality of service offered. Booked a schedule and arrived on time. The technician was waiting with all the paperwork ready explained the est. time duration of 2hrs and led to waiting lounge with free snacks/ coffee and wifi. He said estimated service cost would be around $25 USD and will throw in a complimentary free car wash.

Waited along and withing 1.5 hrs the car was fully serviced and car cleaned in a good way sometimes better than some local car wash places and with good sheen and ready to drive all under 2hrs.

Background: 2 years ago BYD used to offer free servicing on most BYD models for 2 or 3 years, now due to high demand and large volumes they are selling, they stopped that and are still charging a reasonable price.

The consumer landscape on June 5, 2025, presented a dynamic mix of financial market activity, new product launches, and evolving consumer trends. This report synthesizes the day's news from the Consumer Affairs category, offering a comprehensive overview of the key developments.

**Financial Markets and Investment:**

Several large-cap stocks on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) experienced fluctuations, reflecting the volatility inherent in today's market. In the Retail - Apparel/Accessories sector, **Trent** saw its share price at ₹5684.8, with intraday movement between ₹5515 and ₹5708.95. Despite a slight dip today (-1.04%), **Tata Consumer Products**, operating in the Tea & Coffee sector, held a share price of ₹1111.95, trading between ₹1109 and ₹1133.2. Sectoral performance varied; Trent showed a solid 3.05% daily gain and a robust 11.22% growth over the last three months, while Tata Consumer Products experienced a negative performance over the past month.

The Gems, Jewellery & Precious Metals sector, represented by **Titan Company**, closed at ₹3505.2, trading between ₹3476.15 and ₹3534.95. Meanwhile, **ITC**, in the Cigarettes & Tobacco Products sector, closed at ₹419, with intraday trading within the range of ₹415.85 and ₹420.9. ITC's pivot level was set at 417.37, suggesting potential support and resistance levels for traders to monitor.

**Home Loans and the Housing Market:**

For many in India, homeownership remains a significant aspiration. This news cycle highlighted the importance of understanding the various types of home loans available to facilitate this dream. The report mentioned the most common type: **home purchase loans**, which can be used for ready-to-move-in homes, under-construction properties, or resale flats. Lenders offer these loans with fixed or floating interest rates, with repayment tenures spanning up to 30 years, offering consumers flexible options to manage their finances and achieve their homeownership goals.

**Technology and Gadget Launches:**

The tech sector saw the official launch of the **OnePlus 13s** in India. This compact flagship phone, powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, competes directly with rivals like the iPhone 16e and Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. Weighing just 185 grams, it boasts a 6.32-inch 1.5K LTPO AMOLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and 1,600 nits of brightness. It features a 50MP primary camera with Optical Image Stabilisation and a 50MP telephoto sensor with 2X optical zoom. The launch reflects a continuation of the trend of compact flagship smartphones.

The highly anticipated **Nintendo Switch 2** also went on sale worldwide. The company is banking on replicating the launch day success of Apple's iPhones, indicating high consumer demand and anticipation. However, the report cautioned about limited availability, at least for the initial few weeks or even months, due to strong pre-orders in key markets.

**Fashion, Beauty, and Lifestyle:**

The summer season brings increased focus on skincare, particularly sunscreen. The report highlighted that the best sunscreens for 2025 are more than just sun protection. They incorporate skin-loving ingredients like vitamin C, centella, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides. The trend reflects a move towards multi-functional products that address various skin concerns.

In the realm of fashion, the **Bollywood Hungama Style Icons Summit and Awards** provided a platform for discussing sustainability. **Nimrit Kaur Ahluwalia** offered a candid perspective, acknowledging the pressure actors face regarding outfit repetition. She stated, ""Being in the industry, we are constantly judged for repeating outfits,"" and revealed her personal commitment to sustainable fashion through preserving older clothing. Her statement, ""I’m a builder — I like to hold on to things. I still have jeans and skirts from when I was in sixth standard,"" reflects a growing awareness of the environmental and social impact of fast fashion.

**Gaming and Entertainment:**

The launch of the **Nintendo Switch 2** dominated entertainment news, reflecting the company's efforts to compete in a dynamic gaming market. The report suggested that the launch will be the topic of conversation for many months to come.

The best Nintendo Switch games in 2025 were highlighted, with many titles to choose from for casual and hardcore fans alike. Additionally, the market for accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2 will have many options, to help with the gaming experience.

**Conclusion:**

The Consumer Affairs news from June 5, 2025, reveals a multifaceted landscape. Financial markets saw moderate fluctuations with mixed sectoral performance. Technological innovation continued with the launch of a new smartphone and gaming console. The focus on sustainability and skin health emphasized the growing importance of consumer awareness and the evolving expectations for product functionality. The day’s events highlight the intersection of finance, technology, style, and lifestyle, demonstrating the multifaceted nature of consumer trends.

The real world is cold! The real world doesn’t care about spirit! You want to be a hero? Then play the part and die like every other Huntsman in history! As for me, I’ll do what I do best: lie, steal, cheat and survive!”



PHYSICAL

In a Q&A on Reddit in November of 2021, RWBY: Roman Holiday author E. C. Meyers stated the difference in age between Neopolitan and Roman Torchwick to be approximately ten years, making the latter at around 33 years of age at the time of his death during the Fall of Beacon.  A human male hailing from the Mistrali city of Wind Path, Torchwick’s criminal enterprises began as a mere pickpocket before being taken under the wing of Lil’ Miss Malachite, serving as the crime lord’s enforcer for ten years before going rouge with the up and coming assassin Neopolitan.  Forming an incredibly close bond, the pair would directly contribute to the destruction of Lady Browning’s Preparatory Academy For Girls, thwarting Malachite’s attempts to expand into Sanus, and weakening the Xiong family’s hold in Vale, before striking out to stake a claim in the city’s criminal underworld.  While initially content to keep to himself and his private operations, Torchwick would eventually find himself strong-armed into the machinations of Cinder Fall, using his connections and strategic intellect to facilitate the circumstances needed for the Fall of Beacon.  Beyond his henchwoman Neopolitan, Torchwick had no loyalty or meaningful connections to anyone but himself.  Though not especially cruel or violent, he was a cynical misanthrope who would take whatever steps best benefitted him, his service in Salem’s plans amounting to self-preservation and fear on his part.



Despite favoring large-scale planning and being a habitual cigar smoker, Torchwick still boasted excellent physical fitness, his rough upbringing and various scuffles fostering the need to be prepared to fight.  More than willing to get his hands dirty if need be, Torchwick stood at 6’3” and was distinguished by his auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin, and slender build.  His most developed trait was his refined manual dexterity, demonstrated by his skillful handling of his cane both as a melee tool and as a single-handed firearm.  His reflexes were sufficient to defend against both Blake Belladonna’s dual blade assault and later Sun Wukong’s gunchuck blitzkrieg, blocking the attacks while slipping in counters when he could.  Though he favored simple direct strikes, Roman could execute his attacks with great precision and finesse when confronting classically trained opponents.  Notably, during his final battle with Ruby Rose, he was precise enough to swing his weapon to strike his projectile after he had fired it.  Despite almost never employing acrobatics, favoring grounded upright stances, Torchwick was still quick on his feet, regularly escaping pursuit on foot and evading attacks with quick sidesteps.  While it would be fair to say that Blake, Sun, and especially Ruby were all faster than them, they were certainly not speedblitzing him either, making it clear that only speedsters of this degree or higher could reasonably threaten him.  In the realm of physical strength, Torchwick was something of a middle weight.  His might was sufficient to contend with the brutish Roch Szalt and briefly staggered Blake Belladonna during their duel on the docks, but he was unable to free his cane from Blake’s ice double on the train and typically relied on armed combat rather than fisticuffs.

While Torchwick demonstrated a respectable degree of athletic output, more than sufficient to contend with trained Huntsmen, he was not a particularly overbearing combatant.  Instead of overcoming his adversaries directly with speed and strength, Roman relied more on his physical hardiness to soak up punishment, his equation of his early life to being a punching bag indicating his familiarity with pain and injury.  When attacked by the Malachite twins at the Harmony Club, he was thrown through a glass window yet regained his feet without difficulty, only retreating when reinforcements arrived.  He was incapacitated by Honey Wine’s Alluring Song and beaten into submission by a pair of Spiders, yet was able to engage the remaining escort in combat shortly after regaining consciousness when Neo came to his rescue.  Though most of his fights were brief affairs, his performance in the Xiong-Spider gang war indicates his well-developed stamina.  At the Vale docks, he endured both a flying kick from Sun and a heavy cleave from Blake, but recovered from both none the worse for wear.  Several weeks later, he survived the destruction of his Atlesian Paladin by a Burn-charged Yang Xiao Long and quickly regained his feet and escaped, only complaining about his damaged clothing.  Torchwick has only been subdued by catastrophic hits, Blake only defeating him on the Mountain Glenn train by nailing him with power blows and kicking him in the head.  However, while typically cautious and calm, Torchwick was prone to let success go to his head and gloat, underestimating the situation and leading to carelessness.  This trait ultimately led to his death when a Griffon swallowed him whole then crashed into an Atlesian warship’s hull while he was distracted berating Ruby Rose.



Roman Torchwick’s personal code was to “lie, steal, cheat, and survive”, a testament to his willingness to do whatever it took to get through a situation, even allying himself with a living force of destruction just to keep his own skin safe.  Despite this survivalist mentality, Torchwick was also afflicted by his own vanity, seen in his choice of fashionable clothing instead of armor.  As a Vale crimelord, he wore a red-lined white suit gifted to him by Neo, with black dress pants and shoes, accessorized with a gray scarf, black gloves, and his signature bowler hat.  His right wrist initially was marked with the emblem of the Spiders, though after encountering Hei Xiong, he had it remade into his own pumpkin sigil.



RANKING: Tier 3, Advanced Human Fitness

image

While Roman is extremely tough, his athletic output is not truly exceptional in any way. Torchwick’s effectiveness in battle is tied almost wholly to his combat skill, his traits merely developed to enable his fighting style rather than jockey for dominance. To be fair, Roman’s ability to contend with the likes of Blake, Sun and Ruby proves that he can hold his own and match their performance where it counts, and his resiliency, even without armor, means that overcoming him is going to be a challenge regardless. He has simply never overcome anyone on the back of raw physicality, and his ego has allowed him to get in over his head.



MARTIAL

image

Roman Torchwick’s signature weapon was the Melodic Cudgel, a walking cane with a flare gun and grappling hook installed into its ends. The cane itself was about three feet long and made out of an extremely durable yet flexible material, demonstrated when Torchwick bent the shaft in frustration yet caused no lasting damage. The red tip of the cane functioned as the barrel of the firearm, with a small reticle extending to aid in aiming the weapon. Though this is pure speculation, I believe that Torchwick’s ammunition was fitted with low-grade fire Dust to give it its explosive properties, turning normal bullets into sparking grenades. The cable for the grappling hook was coiled in the top half of the cane and was both long and strong enough to catch Ruby Rose as she attempted to flee the Mountain Glenn caverns.



Growing up among Remnant’s criminal element, Roman Torchwick’s lot in life necessitated strong familiarity with combat, though his poverty denied him the chance for formal training.  Instead, Torchwick was forced to learn strictly from experience, building his skill set according to his aptitudes and practical tricks and skills.  Street fighting as a youth fostered his growth as an unarmed fighter, able to subdue hardened gangsters when he was only eighteen, while his talent with bludgeons and improvised weapons helped him as a mugger.  Torchwick’s development was tempered and refined during his time with Spider, rising to become Lil Miss Malachite’s top enforcer and bodyguard after only four years of service.  Roman truly came into his own after going rouge and during the subsequent turf war with the Xiong family, overcoming his former partner Chameleon, humiliating the amateur Huntsmen Roch Szalt and Kandi Floss, and fended off the combined efforts of the Malachite twins.  By the time he was recruited by Cinder Fall, Roman Torchwick had been operating in the criminal underworld for well over a decade, having eluded the police for a considerable span of time and racking up plenty of experience in various illegal activities.  While he favored operating as a schemer and mastermind, Torchwick could not afford to let his fighting skills atrophy, and he always acquitted himself well when he did fight.  Appropriately for someone of his history, Roman Torchwick’s core technique emphasized practical skills and methods for maximum flexibility and reliability.  Despite the additional features of his weapon, Torchwick overwhelmingly favored simple cane fighting to best his opponents in a melee, leveraging his flares and cable for tactical support.  However, Torchwick’s choice of portraying himself as a suave criminal kingpin also motivated him to emphasize elegance and refinement.  This paradox of rough street criminal and sophisticated gentleman thief manifested as a utilitarian yet measured duelist.  His technique consisted of whipping sweeps and bludgeons, static blocks, probing thrusts, and tight deflection parries.  When he stepped up to take the offensive, he could be much more aggressive, using running charges and heavy power blows to stagger the opponent, though he typically restricted this to targets of opportunity, such as when he laid into Ruby Rose after she was disarmed.  By keeping his technique simple and efficient, Torchwick could accommodate virtually any combat situation or opponent, balancing his options and tweaking accordingly.  Torchwick reinforced this conservative yet ruthless style with integrated gunfire and unarmed combat, his trigger speed enough to force Blake into a retreat and later staggering her with a well-placed punch.



image

As a tactician and strategist, Roman was a grand scale schemer first and foremost, at his best when keeping his distance and executing large criminal operations.  An experienced pickpocket and thief, he preferred to assess his target before moving in, tailoring his approach to suit the situation and opponent.  He managed to manipulate his way out of bodyguard duty for the Malachite sisters by intentionally leading them into danger, achieving a larger goal by manipulating Lil Miss’s protective nature.  Already proving his talent for smaller heists in his successful vandalism at the Magic Beans Coffee Company, Torchwick later became adept at orchestrating larger-scale operations.  Under his direction, the White Fang was able to steal vast quantities of weapons and Dust ammunition across Vale while leaving only minor evidence of foul play, their activities only exposed by Team RWBY’s active investigation on him, and later stealing high grade Atlesian military equipment, obtaining a prototype Atlesian Paladin-290 to arm the White Fang.  Though primarily focused on robberies and racketeering, Torchwick proved to be a capable military commander as well.  Though Cinder Fall and Adam Taurus were the bigger fish in the Mountain Glenn train attack, the project was ultimately Roman’s brainchild, capably organizing the White Fang to unleash explosive train cars to create openings for a Grimm influx in Vale.  A consummate showman, Roman emphasized his silver tongue to manipulate his audience and provoke responses, successfully riling up a White Fang rally despite their initial animosity towards him by playing on their frustrations.  He had no trouble applying his flair to combat, goading people into lowering their guard and exposing them to his sucker punch.  In personable combat, Roman was again measured and cautious, but also more straightforward.  As seen multiple times, his first response was usually to set his followers against his assailants while he held back, be it Junior Xiong’s henchmen in Vale, the White Fang at the docks, or Neopolitan and the White Fang Lieutenant on the Mountain Glenn train.  Torchwick clearly emphasized preplanning and stacking the deck, but he was still capable of being dropped into a fight cold, either to fight directly or to stall for time to facilitate his retreat.  Like Neopolitan, his fighting tactics emphasized defense and counter, fending off the opponent’s attacks before catching them off guard with retaliation.  However, Roman was much more proactive, forcibly targeting their flanks while also wearing them down with verbal taunts, provoking frustration to make them overextend.  For Torchwick, words were just as good a weapon as his cane, undermining his opponent before striking where they are weakest.  Subvert and overpower.



However, while clearly cunning and skillful, Torchwick’s pride and self-preservation were his greatest blindspots.  His taunts and posturing often went to the point of pointless aggravation, giving his opponents a chance to fight back, while his short-sighted focus on his immediate objectives led to oversights and tunnel vison.  The strengths and weaknesses of Roman’s skills and tactics are clearly seen in his various conflicts with Team RWBY.  His first encounter with Ruby Rose saw her casually dispatch his backup, prompting Roman to cut his loses, shoot her with a flare, and run for the rooftops where he was retrieved by Cinder Fall.  At the Vale docks, Roman turned Blake Belladonna’s ambush around by shooting into the ground and staggering her before forcing her to retreat with more gunfire.  Their one on one clash shortly afterward had him capably fend off her energetic sword assault before using his cane to manipulate her weapons and leaver her open to a staggering punch.  However, Roman had less success with Sun Wukong, who blindsided him with a flying kick and then sent him into a scrambling retreat from his gunchucks.  Fortunately, Roman recovered quickly and distracted his assailants by shooting off a cargo crate, leaving Sun at gunpoint.  In his rematch with Blake, Roman was able to fence evenly with the Faunus, but her infusion of Dust into her shadow clones trapped up and subverted him, and his survival was wholly due to Blake’s mercy.  This particular engagement saw Torchwick’s psychological warfare tactics backfire, simply provoking Blake’s anger rather than undermining her focus.  Though arrested by James Ironwood shortly thereafter, Roman escaped during the Fall of Beacon with Neo’s aid, infecting the Atlas fleet with Arthur Watts’s computer virus and turning the Atlesian Knights rogue.  When he and Neo were confronted by Ruby Rose, the pair were able to disarm and blindside her.  However, Torchwick’s self-aggrandizement proved to be his undoing, quickly getting too caught up in rationalizing his submission to Cinder to pay attention to other threats.  Ruby was able to forcibly remove Neo from the battle and presumably kill her, causing Roman to lose his composure and fall into a vicious rage against her.  Sadly, he was so caught up in berating the optimistic girl that he failed to notice the Griffon behind him, and Roman Torchwick died in the stomach of a beast.



RANKING: Tier 3, Standard Mastery

image

Despite his barebones training and limited direct combative focus, Roman Torchwick proved himself a very capable martial artist, posing a serious threat to many of the premier Huntsmen students of his day.  His treacherous tactics expertly undercut his opponents while his flexible fighting style gave him parody with more aggressive opponents. However, Roman clearly owed his greatest successes to having more power behind him at the right times, and he himself was vulnerable to more subversive fighters, his difficulties fighting Sun and Blake proving that he could be blindsided and caught off guard.  Roman Torchwick operates best when he has the numbers and firepower on his side, and at his worst when someone can answer all his tricks and hit him right where it hurts in return.  Torchwick is not above cutting and running and can be overpowered, but putting him under that kind of pressure is no easy feat.



SPECIAL

image

Unlike the vast majority of his peers, Roman Torchwick never discovered his Semblance, and his ethereal talents were restricted to only his baseline Aura.  Obviously having never attended a proper combat school, Torchwick’s inability to access his special powers left him at a major disadvantage against more highly trained adepts.  In fact, Roman is on record deeming Semblances overrated, preferring to best his enemies with his own wit and charm.  Making matters worse was Roman’s relatively irreverent behavior and preoccupation with the mundane all but crippling the spiritual awareness needed to unconsciously manifest his powers.



That said though, Roman was quite familiar with these manifestations, both from his regular encounters with Huntsmen and from how heavily his subordinate Neo relied on hers in battle.  As such, Torchwick did learn to develop adaptive countermeasures to deal with a wide variety of tricks and talents.  A keen observer, Torchwick was able to adapt quickly to an opponent’s Semblance by assessing their mechanics and applications.  Against Chameleon, Torchwick sussed out her location by looking for disturbances in the air while psychological warfare to exploit her emotional unbalance, hindering her already spotty use of her camouflage even with her supportive equipment.  Against Blake Belladonna’s baseline shadow clones, he maintained his defensive stance to avoid overextending, waiting for Blake to let up before catching her off guard.  When Ruby Rose attempted to blitz him with her Petal Burst, Roman shot a flare at her and immediately struck the projectile with his cane, turning a single shot into an arcing wave that caught Ruby right in the chest.  Furthermore, his use of psychological warfare likely had the ulterior motive of provoking his opponent into engaging him in physical combat rather than using their powers, preventing them from bringing their full might to bear. However, these counters were not without limits, as sufficient power or subversions on the enemy’s part could still catch him in a bind.  Blake was able to trap up Roman’s weapon by infusing her clone with ice Dust and ignore his taunts during their rematch on the train, and he was completely helpless against Honey Wine’s Alluring Song.



Additionally, Roman was highly knowledgeable about the qualities of Dust, the elemental gunpowder being the primary object of his robberies in Vale. Though he rarely carried the crystals into battle, he was perfectly willing to use them if need be, using a fire gem as an improvised grenade during his first encounter with Ruby Rose.



RANKING: Tier 6, No Combat

image

However intelligent Roman Torchwick’s countermeasures may be, they are ultimately mundane tricks rather than stemming from any special powers or equipment.  Roman’s lack of a Semblance is still a major weakness in his corner, and his counters merely allow him to lessen the disadvantage rather than provide an advantage of his own, made all the worse by his arrogant eschewing. While his knowledge of Dust would no doubt make his particularly dangerous with it, he did not carry any of the substance in his usual loadout, making his tricks even more limited.  He relies on clever strategy to undermine his opponents and prevent them from brining their full might to bear, and if that fails, he is left scrambling.



OVERALL RANKING: TIER 4, EXPERT HUNTSMAN

image

Roman Torchwick is a very interesting combatant in that his role as a criminal mastermind means that he does not have a particularly heavy combative focus, yet he still proved to be a serious threat.  This proves that a non-combative focus is not an automatic indication of inferiority if one keeps up on their training.  Roman’s robust physique leaves him well prepared for the scuffles he is destined to get himself into, and as a martial artist is precise, ruthless, and sketchy as all hell.  However, Roman is severely held back by certain practical weaknesses, most notably his lack of combative special abilities.  Due to never discovering his Semblance, Torchwick’s viability in combat is reliant on his skill as a fighter, to the point where he was contending with formally trained Huntsmen students.  Even then, his success was often predicated on undercutting his enemies rather than outwitting them, and he had serious problems dealing with his own sneak attacks. In many ways, Roman Torchwick represents the best that can be achieved through pure combat experience with minimal training.  His honed skills certainly qualify him as a master martial artist, but his lack of true dedication means that he is little more than that.  For Roman Torchwick, fighting is a tedious necessity at worst and a hobby at best, mastering his skills out of practicality and not true dedication.



Underscoring all of this is the fact that Roman Torchwick was ultimately a self-serving criminal above all else, his greatest strength and weakness being his cynical need to fight dirty.  His goals were always about his own profit and preservation, throwing in his lot with Salem due to his own pessimistic view of the world.  He thinks the world is cold, so he got cold back, and anything that challenges him is either a naïve fool or the next boot to lick.  He put on a good show and presented himself as a survivor and pragmatist, but his posturing merely concealed the opportunistic street rat he truly was.  While not nearly as cowardly as Leo Lionheart, Roman Torchwick’s mantra of “lie, steal, cheat and survive” meant that protecting his own skin was his top priority, and if the tables turn, he consistently chose to cut his losses and flee.  The sheer irony is that Torchwick himself was a victim of the very chaos he nihilistically helped create, such is the fate of all of Salem’s pawns.

He was very guarded and hated being touched and it took me awhile to find out why. I met his family and even his mother. At the time she seemed nice and seemed normal. 

Fast forward a few years and we got a place with each other. He moved out and he would check on his family. Every time he came back he was very distant. I was always unsure why until I was there for a family event. I just came off on a long shift at my job and arrived at his brother's house. Let's just say I felt the mood shift. I saw  Steve hiding upstairs and wanted to know why. He would not tell me and told me it is better if I stay away from ""Karen"". I went back downstairs and I saw Steve's sister Sally. I asked Sally what happened and I found out that Karen said that Steve should dump me for being white and be with his distant cousin that is Asian. I was livid and wanted to confront her. However, I waited and watched her actions. I saw Karen talking to Amber about Steve and how they are meant to be with each other and not with me. I sat down near Amber and struck up a conversation with her and somehow made her uncomfortable. 

I saw Karen's face changed as she left and hid. I thought that was the end of it.
I was wrong. Fast forward to Christmas 2024, I was recovering from COVID and at the time I didn't know I had shingles. I had to make cookies for Christmas and Sally was helping me out. I was making cookies with Sally till 11pm the night before Christmas eve. Karen comes in the kitchen and says she does not want to hear any noise at 7pm. So I stopped for the night and was going to resume in the morning. 

I woke up at 6 am to discover I was feeling worse. I put some cream on my rash cause that is what I thought it was at the time. I waited 10 mins so I could put on layers and head downstairs to make more cookies. I heard my metal bowls being thrown around. Steve warned me this might get ugly. I come down and see Sally in fear and almost on the break of tears. I run to get Steve's brother we will call Tyler. I knocked on that door like the cops were breaking in. I told him I need him in the kitchen. When I was coming downstairs I heard a mug shatter. I looked and saw she shatter the mug I got when I got my first car in my own. It might sound stupid but thar mug meant a lot. 
Karen then looks at her cup of hot coffee and was about to throw it at my husband Steve. I could feel my fist balling and I screamed at her to put that cup down. Karen looked at me and saw pure hate. She turned around to my husband Steve and called him a parasite and then screamed at the top of her lungs that she wished she killed all 7 of her kids through drowning. Steve stayed calm and never asked his voice and instead packed a bag and went to a hotel. I followed him right after I made sure to check on Tyler and Sally. Later that day went to the hospital and found out I had shingles. We stayed in the hotel by ourselves for the holidays and started to look for a place for just us. (We came to love with his brothers and mom for personal reasons). 

She would not apologize to any of her kids. She tried to talk to me and I gave her the same answer of apologize to all of your kids. She blew me off and said I had no reason to act this way over the kidness she showed me. (I never saw this kindness) It was a use relationship, and I spent over 10k on her to make sure she had everything she needed. 
 

When she realized I was done she yelled at me for being a non Asian and breaking up the family. She then told Steve that he is no longer part of the family. Would we be an a-hole to send her back to Vietnam to be with her sister and her family after the way she acted towards her kids? ",8,1749173447.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,3,1.0,False

32m Hispanic, newly single, looking for a genuine friend connection, real friendship. I used to have a best friend that would fill that void and don’t have her anymore. It’s okay. Letting go is part of life and I understand but I’m still just trying to find something even remotely close to what I used to have. 

I enjoy reading, currently reading leading with the heart by coach k. Love all kinds of music with an affinity for punk music. Ringo Starr is my favorite Beatle. Take on me by A-ha has been my favorite song since I was like 11. I spend a lot of time alone so I’m up to date on most tv and movies. I like running for exercise, have been taking regular breaks due to tendinitis. I go to the gym a few times a week. Like playing pickup games and going for long walks in the park. I don’t drink coffee. I drink occasionally and am 420 friendly. Politically left. Love pizza. Prefer dogs to cats. I’m clumsy. I talk too much. I collect lots of stuff like mugs, vinyl, collectibles. I like nerdy shit, except the star related shits, Star Wars, battlestar, Star Trek. Fuck George RR Martin. Hopeless  romantic still waiting for their person but done looking. Have a few mental health challenges. Overall I’m pretty friendly and accepting. :)

I've been thinking about this lately because it happened to me again. Had this friend I used to text constantly, we'd hang out every weekend, knew each other's coffee orders by heart. Then life happened. I started therapy, got into hiking, began caring about different stuff. They stayed exactly where they were, which was fine, but we just... stopped clicking.

No big fight. No ""we need to talk"" moment. Just shorter texts, longer gaps between hangouts, and that weird feeling when you realize you don't really know what's going on in their life anymore. It's like watching someone walk away in slow motion.

Part of me used to think this meant I was being fake or shallow. But honestly? Sometimes you outgrow people the same way you outgrow clothes. Doesn't mean the shirt was bad, just means you're not the same size anymore.

It's saad but also kind of beautiful in a weird way. Like, we're all just figuring ourselves out, and sometimes that means our paths split up.

Hey! I saw a clip of this movie on TikTok recently and it’s been stuck in my head ever since. I really want to watch the full thing but I can’t remember the title.

Here’s what I remember:
	•	It’s a rom-com with a young (white?) guy and girl
	•	They hook up at his apartment and he tries to get her to leave after, but she just turns over and goes to sleep anyway
	•	The next morning she’s in the kitchen making coffee or breakfast
	•	His friend or roommate is surprised because apparently he never lets girls stay over, so it’s a big deal and the roommate and guy have an intense conversation about it. 
	•	One of the most scenes I remember is when the girl ends up taking his car and the guy’s friend literally gives her the keys and the guy is confused/ upset 
	•	There’s also a scene where they’re going back and forth saying they’re not a couple but they keep hanging out like they are
	•	It’s an American movie in English, and I think the title might have the word “day” in it but I’m not 100% sure

It’s not Two Night Stand, That Awkward Moment, or The Overnight. The actors seem younger than the people in those movies.

We’ve been together 14 years. 
We have ALWAYS fought over chores. (I never do enough) 

It all started because we had a conversation after the kids were in bed and we finally got DC each other for the first time in days. (Conflicting schedules) the second we sat down, they said all the things that need to be done over the next few days and I replied with “yes, there is always something to do…” and sighed. 
They came back, frustrated saying I had an attitude with that statement, which I didn’t think I did and wasn’t my intention. I was totally neutral, which led to a conversation of me never feeling like enough. The goal post was always moving. I want nothing more than to connect And be with this person that I know is on the inside, but when we have disagreements, they are mean, belittle me, mock my therapy and the work on myself. I expressed that I don’t feel like we are communicating effectively and I wanna make sure both of us feel heard. so knowing we’ve been going in the circle for ever I brought up maybe doing couples counselling or they seek more therapy. They looked at me and said multiple times I am not doing couples counseling. I am not doing personal therapy. I’ve already done enough. 

All I did was asked to be talked to with kindness instead of insults and anger, and they told me they’re unable to do that. I said a boundary and they told me they cannot be kind to me and they do not want to be close to me, I don’t know how good I have it.  They told me that they’re leaving because they can’t be kind to me. They can’t respect my boundary and that I hope enjoy being a single mom and hope that I don’t get overwhelmed. They through their phone in the driveway and smashed it (brand new phone were still paying on). They often do this or turn their phone off so I can’t track their location because they’ve “made attempts” before. ( This was another thing I ask them to do for their safety because they often take the car and take off) 

I now have to call in to work tomorrow because my spouse isn’t here and Won’t take the kids to daycare. (Our girls are 3.5 & 1.5) 
Maybe I put up with his behaviour a lot before and now they’re having a hard time with it because I am standing up for myself, but having kids changes your perspective and I don’t want them to ever be treated like this so I feel like I deserve more. But also simultaneously I feel like maybe I am the asshole and I am not listening and I am not doing enough. 

Is all this normal? 
Why do I feel so hurt but also a little free that they finally admitted they don’t want to connect with me and they can’t treat me with kindness so they’re leaving. 

Life is so hard. 

Update: they came back twice, had a bit of a conversation and left again. The second time swearing and flipping the coffee table around, punching things etc. I was upstairs after they admitted they don't respect me, they don't want to connect with me, and I questioned if they loved me.
They feel as if I don't respect them because I don't do enough around the house unprompted. They are overly critical of everything and I asked them to name the last time they complimented me...
Of course I don't feel like going above and beyond for a person who doesn't show me appreciation, kindness or connection.
They finally agreed to do couples counselling but they said ""it's the first step towards the end"". I asked if they think this will end us or will we be able to work through this and they told me they are going to get arrested in therapy and to have fun explaining that to the kids. Also said they wanted to sleep separately until this is sorted so they're on the sofa.
I cleaned up the tossed around living room before they came back again and it felt rather eye opening that I don't want to clean up these messes anymore. I don't want to worry about my kids waking up in a trashed house.

The results were quite surprising to us, and I wanted somewhere to share!  Listing them loosely worst to best.


19) Tarnish - Smells like nail polish remover

18) Condensed Milk - Not particularly fragrant, but had a play-doh like undercurrent that wasn't pleasant.

17) Sunshine - Smelled like a feminine deodorant, baby-powder-ish.

16) Angel Food - could barely smell anything at all except alcohol

15) Sushi - another very mild fragrance, hard to pick out any specific notes.

14) Kitten Fur - Smelled like fairly pleasant laundry.

13) Orange Cream Pop - This one would have been much higher, but very weak scent.  What's there was pleasant, but wasn't much there.

12) Lime - The most disappointing one because, once again, barely any scent at all.

11) Hibiscus - pleasant and floral, this one smelled like a ""normal"" perfume

10) Thunderstorm - While not a particularly nice smell, it was very interesting/accurate.  Strong dirt and rain notes.

9) Paperback - Like Thunderstorm, this one was mostly interesting, though might make a good masculine scent for people who really love an extremely accurate smell of new books!

8) Pixie Dust - Very sweet and pleasant, overwhelming sugar

7) Stringbean - Didn't really get any stringbean notes, but still liked it.  Clean, fresh, and a bit sweet.

6) Frozen Margarita - Got this hoping for lime.  Lime notes were present, along with nice complimentary notes that reminded me of both the drink and the beach.

5) Honeysuckle - Powerful and accurate to the name

4) Espresso - Accurate coffee bean smell, and I love the smell of coffee

3) Blood Lime - a MUCH better Lime than ""Lime"" although with strong bitter notes that aren't unpleasant.

2) Watermelon Lolipop - Like a sweet watermelon candy to your nose rather than mouth

1) Monk Fruit - And this was the big surprise, but a giant 4oz size of this was included as a free gift and it isn't something I'd ever have ordered.  I don't know what a Monk Fruit is, but THIS smells like the most delicious and juicy pear you can imagine.  It is amazing.  As disappointed as I was by the lack of a true Lime scent, this made up for it.  



Summary: Several scents were disappointingly weak, including Lime.  Monk Fruit is the most delicious pear that could possibly exist.  The scents that weren't weak to begin with faded after 1-3 hours, but for the price easy to refresh.",4,1749172635.0,fragrance,3,0.83,False

Ever feel like you’re managing a never-ending avalanche of tasks? You’re not alone. Just last week, I looked at my never-ending to-do list and thought, “Is this a list or a horror movie?” 😱 But then I discovered habit stacking, and let me tell you, it’s like finding a life raft in the middle of a stormy sea! 🛟

So what exactly is habit stacking? It’s all about combining small habits to create a more efficient routine. Think of it like making a combo meal at your favorite drive-thru. You’re powering through tasks with minimal effort, and you get more bang for your buck—who wouldn’t want that?

Here’s how to get started, with some tips I’ve picked up along the way:

**1. Start Small:**  
Don’t overwhelm yourself! Pick one or two habits you want to stack. For example, if you want to drink more water, you could stack it with your morning coffee. **Every time you make coffee, down a glass of water first.** Hydration level: 🌊💯

**2. Pair New with Old:**  
The best part of habit stacking is using an existing habit as a launching pad. If you already have a morning routine, add in a new habit. Like, **after you brush your teeth (old habit), do 10 squats (new habit).** Who doesn’t love multitasking without feeling like a circus performer? 🤹‍♂️

**3. Create Visual Reminders:**  
Sticky notes, phone alerts, or even setting out your workout clothes where you can see them work wonders. **Visual cues are like your personal cheer squad, reminding you to stay in the game!** 📣

**4. Celebrate Small Wins:**  
Did you remember to stretch while your coffee brewed? 🎉 Give yourself a mental high-five! Celebrating these little victories keeps the motivation bubbling, and trust me, it all adds up over time.

**5. Check-In Regularly:**  
Consider making it a daily practice to check what worked and what didn’t. It’s like a mini review session for your habits. **What felt good? What needs tweaking? Tuning in can elevate your stacking game immensely!**

This whole concept hit home for me last month when I started combining my listening habits with chores. Instead of just plowing through dishes, I’ve been listening to motivational podcasts at the same time. **That’s double-duty right there, and I’m all about that vibe! 🎧✨**

Let's be honest, though: habit stacking isn’t always sunshine and rainbows. Some days, you forget and just binge-watch that new show instead of taking action. And that's alright! We’re humans, not robots. 😊

So, what’s your take? Have you tried habit stacking? Got some winning combos you swear by? Let’s keep this convo going!",1,1749172480.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

This 5-Minute ""Anti-Motivation"" Hack Refuels My Drive (Surprising Result) 🤯**

Ever feel like you're on a treadmill, sprinting towards success but getting nowhere fast? 😅 I mean, *we all want to achieve our goals*, right? But sometimes, I wonder if we’re running in circles instead of moving forward. 

Let me take you back to last week. I was in full hyper-achievement mode, juggling multiple projects, staying up way too late, and drinking enough coffee to fuel a rocket launch. I thought I was being productive, but honestly? I felt like a hamster in a wheel—exhausted and going nowhere. Sound familiar?

So, in a moment of desperation (or maybe just sheer exhaustion), I tried something unexpected: I took a **5-minute anti-motivation break**. And guess what? It changed everything! Here’s how that simple act refueled my drive:

1. **Unplug for a Sec**: I stepped away from my desk (yes, right in the middle of my “grind”), and took a quick walk outside.
2. **Breathe Deep**: Just a few minutes of deep breathing, absorbing some fresh air, and soaking in a little sunshine. 🌞
3. **Shift Focus**: Instead of thinking about what I had to do next, I pondered on what makes me *happy*. Like, really happy. Think puppies, good music, or that ridiculous meme you laughed at last week. 
4. **Set an Intention**: I asked myself, “Why am I doing this again?” and honestly recognized the joy in my goals rather than just the pressure.

Here’s the kicker: this super simple ""anti-motivation"" break didn’t just help me regain focus—it shifted my entire mindset. Suddenly, I wasn’t just chasing tasks; I was rekindling my passion for what I thought was just a checklist.

**Why does this work?** 🤔 It’s like flipping a light switch. By stepping back, I gained perspective and reminded myself of the big picture. Instead of grinding away like a robot, I embraced the human side of this journey. 

And if you're catching yourself spiraling into that hyper-achievement cycle, here's a little bonus I’ve found helpful:

- **Reflect on Wins**: Take 30 seconds to appreciate what you’ve accomplished this week. Even the small stuff counts! 🙌
- **Change Your Environment**: Sometimes just chilling in a different spot—or even rearranging your workspace—can do wonders.
- **Reach Out**: A quick chat with a friend or fellow achiever can ground you and spark some new inspiration. 

Have you ever stepped back when everything felt overwhelming? 🤷‍♀️ I genuinely think those 5 minutes can spark a transformation. It’s a wild world out there, and sometimes we need to pause, breathe, and just... *be*. So, what do you think?

Am I in incredible nerve pain today? Also yes. Hello. Rain and thunderstorms are the best. On a random note I can go for a lovely thunderstorm. Need the booms and flashes in my life.

Now for the good stuff. I play on xbox and PlayStation. I enjoy singleplayer games but I do enjoy goofing off with friends in co-op games like helldivers. I'm always down to game but I will not play fortnite or CoD. 

More good stuff. I love food and cooking. I'm what the kids call a fatass. I don't think I have a favorite thing to make but as for eating I do enjoy a nice bacon cheeseburger. I do make a mean bowl of fruity pebbles. And I have a tendency to make waffles with ice coffee. 

I love music. Rock and metal. When I wanna get wild I whip out the Macarena or Barbie girl. 

I wish I had the ability to focus on reading. I miss it but I blame phones for making my ability to concentrate not exist. But I do have books I want to read. 

I'm down for swapping selfies and moving onto other platforms if things are cool. 

Bonus points if you like dancing queen. Medical problems - cause I do. Or have an accent. I'm American and I don't have one. Also so far posting on here my luck is nill. Some questionable people.

Ever just feel like your brain is bouncing off the walls, even when you really need it to chill out and focus? 🧠 Like, you sit down to tackle that to-do list and 30 minutes later, you're deep into an internet rabbit hole about how jelly beans are made. *How did we get here?* 😂

Well, I was in that exact boat. My mind is usually racing at a hundred miles an hour, which makes staying calm and focused a bit like wrestling a caffeinated squirrel. Anyone else? 🙋‍♂️

So, I decided to give **box breathing** a shot for a week. Pretty sure I'd heard about it ages ago but never actually put it into practice. Here’s how it works:

1. **Inhale for 4 seconds.** Easy, right? Imagine filling up a box with air, slowly but surely.
2. **Hold for 4 seconds.** *Cue the awkward staring contest with the ceiling.*
3. **Exhale for 4 seconds.** Like you're easing out air from a tire… but, ya know, make it rhythmic.
4. **Hold again for 4 seconds.** Repeat till your brain feels a little less like a sprinting hamster.

**Day 1**: Felt weird. Not gonna lie, my brain kept wandering back to thoughts like, ""Did I leave the stove on?"" (Spoiler: I didn't even use it that day.)

**Day 3**: Noticed a shift. I wasn't as jittery, and I could actually focus during my Netflix marathons without scrolling on my phone at the same time. Progress?

**Day 5**: You wouldn't believe it—my HRV (heart rate variability) stats started improving! My watch was finally happy with me.

**Day 7**: Feel like a zen master. Well, almost. But hey, my cortisol levels have definitely dropped, as confirmed by my smartwatch giving me a metaphorical thumbs up. 📉

Here’s what I learned:

- Who knew breathing was such a game-changer? I've been doing it wrong this whole time!
- It's surprisingly easy to fit into your day. Waiting for your coffee to brew? BAM—box breath.
- It's not just hippie voodoo. Like, science backs it up! 🧬

Not saying it's a miracle cure, but my week-long experiment opened my eyes (and lungs) to the power of just taking a breather. 

So, ever tried something like this? How do you find your *calm in the chaos*? Let me know what works for you—I'm all ears for brain hacks! 😊",1,1749172437.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

I’ve been struggling to explain everything clearly, and this really helped me get my thoughts together.]

Hey everyone,

A while back, I tried 5-HTP after my doctor mentioned it. I don’t remember any side effects back then, and I think it helped, though it’s been so long it’s hard to say for sure. Recently, I decided to give it another try because I really don’t want to go back on antidepressants. I’ve been on so many over the years, and I’m just done with them for now.

I bought a well-reviewed 5-HTP on Amazon without paying much attention to the dosage — it turned out to be 200 mg, which I later realized is on the high end. For the first couple weeks, I felt fine. The strange part was I started only sleeping 1–4 hours a night, but somehow still felt okay during the day. Eventually, though, the sleep deprivation started catching up with me.

I did some digging and found out that insomnia can be a side effect for some people at higher doses. I switched to a 50 mg version hoping that would fix the issue, but unfortunately, I still wasn’t sleeping — not even at the lower dose.

Here’s what’s frustrating: while I was taking 5-HTP, I noticed a huge difference in my eating. It totally killed my emotional eating. I wasn’t snacking or stress-eating the way I usually do, and I actually started losing a bit of weight. Nothing else has ever done that for me. Now that I’ve stopped, I’ve slipped right back into eating based on emotions, not hunger. My mood has also dipped again, and overall, I’m feeling worse.

I’m not currently seeing a therapist or psychiatrist and haven’t been on meds for over a year. Going back on antidepressants just doesn’t feel like an option for me right now — long story, but I’ve had a tough time with side effects and med-switching over the years.

So I’m looking for suggestions:
Are there any non-prescription supplements or alternatives that might help with mood and especially emotional eating — ideally something that works similarly to 5-HTP, but without the insomnia side effect?

For what it’s worth, I do like the energy from stimulants, and I drink coffee daily. But when I’ve tried caffeine-based products that are supposed to help with appetite or cravings, they don’t seem to work for me — maybe because I already have a caffeine tolerance.

Thanks in advance — I felt a small glimpse of hope with 5-HTP, and I’d really like to find something that helps even a little.
