I recently watched a documentary about rising coffee prices. That made me think whether caffeine was a common thing for Northern-Europeans before trade routes and connections to other countries.

The only caffeine sources I know are tea (Asia), coffee and cocoa (South America), mate (South America) and Guarana (South America). Oh and the cola plant, but also South America.

Is there any plant that contains caffeine and grows naturally in Northern Europe (Germany, Poland, Scandinavia; no Mediterranean climate)?

1it6675,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1it6675/settling_down_with_an_unambitious_man_would_you/,Settling down with an unambitious man. Would you do it?,"Distinct recent experiences in life has taught me this: most straight women will resent their partners who lack drive or ambition. It happens a lot where a woman falls for a man and doesn’t care that he’s not successful or driven. She loves him for other reasons. He may be kind, good-looking, funny etc. She brushes off the fact that he isn’t too fussed about bettering himself, has an easy/no job, isn’t thinking about promotions, climbing the ladder etc. She admires his non-materialistic ways. 

Then bam, one day it’ll hit you. One day you’ll start thinking about growing a family. You’ll think you ideally may want to take some time off work. You may want to stay home with your baby a little while longer. You don’t hate the idea of staying home for at least a couple of years, just to take in everything, breastfeed in peace and not miss any milestones with your baby. But you realise… you can’t. Because the man you’ve chosen to be the father of your baby could never pay all the bills. You absolutely have to work. You have to leave your baby. You consider nannies/daycares. You don’t love any of these. He offers to be the stay-at-home parent. It makes sense because you make more money anyway. And suddenly you’re in this family dynamic you never planned. Is this what you envisioned growing up? That you’d be unwillingly working at a time that you always thought you’d be home with your baby/toddler going to Mommy & Me classes and coffee dates with your cute little companion. Instead, the undriven man you chose to settle down with gets to stay home, nap with the baby, and bottle-feed the breastmilk you have to pump at work.   

This may not apply to all of you, but for those of you whom it strikes a chord, please please pick your boyfriends/husbands carefully and don’t unwittingly end up living a life that your younger self would consider a nightmare. ",4,1739973737.0,AskWomenOver30,2,0.83,False

1it655h,https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1it655h/entitled_bully_gets_their_just_rewards/,Entitled bully gets their just rewards.,"My wife has an entitled coworker/acquaintance. I use the term acquaintance as she does run in our friend circle, but we try to limit or avoid contact with her. 

We will call her ""Karrie"" . Anyways Karrie is known for bullying co workers at work. Saying that she can get people fired (she can't), screaming at people and at large just general bad behavior. Her favorite thing to intimadate people with is to tell them to Fuck around and find out ! ( this is important for later.)

So Karrie had a fuck buddy. Nothing serious just a guy she would bang and kick out the door. Karrie is also notorious for ""collecting"" engagement rings. She would began dating a guy get a ring from them. Get them to pay off some bill for her then kick them to the curb. Again I bring this up only as contexts to her character and to reenforce that the fuck buddy guy meant nothing to her. As she didn't date him nor tried getting a ring from him. She use him then kick him to the curb, whenever someone with money showed her attention. She would also frequently talk shit about this guy behind his back. 

So Karrie was on one of  her short term engagements, so the fuck buddy (let's call him bill). Was currently not someone she was seeing, as the new guy just bought her a 6000 dollar ring (I'm serious she collected engagement rings like they were Pokémon), and paid 10 grand to get her roof fixed. So she was happy with this guy and had no interest at all in Bill..

Enter ""Mandy"". Mandy is another co worker of my wife and Karrie. I personally don't know her, but from what I've been told is she just got out of a 15 year marriage where she wasn't allowed to do anything and was very controlled. Karrie and Mandy are friends, well drinking buddies (Karrie likes to drink alot and by like I mean all the time.) But never the less they were on good terms. So randomly Mandy meets Bill. Mandy doesn't know Bills history with Karrie, nor knows that she even knows her. They hit it off, like really good. And they are getting along so we'll that they begin dating. And it blossoms into a great relationship.  One that's built on respect and love.

Karrie finds out...... And she loses her fucking mind. Again she never dated Bill never wanted to date Bill, she never had any interest in him beside sex. Hell she currently engaged to a guy. But Mandy took her man ! And she let the world know about it.

Karrie started by going to their boss daily and asking him ""Why does that little bitch still work here!"" She would also loudly excalm this on the work floor for all to hear. Also Karrie spent a whole hour yelling and screaming at her for some ing Mandy didn't even do.

Karrie would also frequently harass them both when they were out and about in town. She would loudly call her a bitch, slut, cunt and just all the nasty things you can say about someone. She would not only loudly say these things in their proximity, but tell anyone that would listen (or not listen, basically anyone around her.) How she was wronged by Mandy and Bill. And what she thought about it, and that Mandy is Fucking around so she going to find out.

Fast forward two months. Mandy and Bill are still together and extremely happy. Karrie is surprisingly no longer engaged to that guy. But surprisingly has already been engaged to another guy and married after a week. It was unfortunately the two year anniversary of the passing of a mutual friend of all parties involved. Karrie is using this time to take the week off of work to drink. ( this is a whole other can of worms, basically she isn't close to this person who passed as she claims to be). But anyways once work is over everyone else goes to the bar to have a drink to celebrate the departed life. So again once Karrie after two full days of drinking see Mandy she begins to let into her again with all the shut shaming stuff. Mandy finally having enough of it attempts to talk to Karrie in an attempt to reconcile. Karrie is having none of this and keeps calling her names and precedes to tell her that Mandy is Fucking around and is going to find out, and ends it with calling her a cunt. Well I'm guessing something snapped and Mandy straight snapped and threw a beer bottle straight at her hitting her in the face. Imagine the cop in the big lebowski throwing the coffee cup. Knocking her on her ass. There is a slight pause and someone I don't know who pipes up. ""It looks like you were the one that fucked around , and found out!""  Karrie obviously stunned gets up and leaves. 

So the next day she showed up to work, with a very obvious black eye. She isn't saying anything to Mandy. But going to everyone else complaining that she was the victim. Not understanding that everyone been watching her bully this poor girl for the last few months. 

And that kind of it. Nothing else has happened since then,  but if it does I'll let you know.  Sorry this got long winded.",4,1739973664.0,EntitledPeople,0,1.0,False

1it64i5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1it64i5,China 3.5 month trip report (Part 2 of 2),"***If you found this report helpful, I’d really appreciate an upvote!*** It would go a long way in helping me build enough karma to post in other subreddits and share my experiences on different topics to help others. If you have any questions about these locations, feel free to ask—preferably here on this page—so others can benefit from the answers too.

I recently got back from a big solo trip through China and thought it might be helpful to share this report. I personally found a lot of valuable information from similar posts in this subreddit, so I wanted to pay it forward. For context:

* I’m 22, male, and was traveling solo.
* I only speak Dutch and English fluently, with very basic knowledge of Chinese words such as numbers and 多少钱.
* I used a French passport with a tourist visa
* For VPNs, I used **Mullvad** and **Let’sVPN**—both worked fine, I ditched astrill the first month as the interface was useless and expensive.
* For phone service, I used **Nihaomobile** for a local number and a **3s HK SIM card** for extra data. The connection was better with 3s, but both were reliable.
* **For translation, I used Baidu translate for complex sentences and learning, while for quick conversations microsoft translate:** As many in this subreddit often point out, almost no one in China speaks English fluently—not even in cities like Beijing or Shanghai. English is mostly limited to the trendiest bars, restaurants, or hotels. If you’re not comfortable using translation apps or chatting via **WeChat/Weixin**, which has a built-in translation feature, this might not be the best destination for you.

# Other Tips:

* **Gaode (高德地图)** and **Meituan (美团)** were absolute lifesavers for finding clubs, coffee, food, or gyms. These apps are far more accurate than Apple Maps or Google Maps in China.
   * If you order food through Meituan, send the delivery driver a message that says something like: *""Hi, I don’t speak Chinese, so calling won’t work. Please drop it off at this location.""* Since I started doing this, I haven’t had any issues with drivers calling me. Also please give them a tip trough cash and just say 红包 if you get the chance (you can also give in the app), these people are getting squeezed even compared to uber eats standards and you definitely can miss a few rmb if you can order food delivery.
* **Xiaohongshu (小红书)** is great for finding information about sightseeing and hikes in less-documented areas, though it’s currently overloaded with tiktok crap.
* If you’re in a remote area where cars are the only transportation, ask your hotel reception to arrange a driver for you. They’ll usually provide a quote and can easily find someone for the next day. Costs are manageable if you’re sharing with 3–4 people, but it can get pricey if you’re traveling solo and on a tight budget (like me). If you’re ever stuck somewhere, this is the easiest way to get out—capitalism at its finest, as there’s always someone willing to drive for the right price.

# Guangdong (14 days)

# Hong Kong (香港, 5 days)

I’ve been to Hong Kong before, but I loved it so much that I had to go back. It’s an incredible mix of British humor and open-mindedness combined with the craziness and energy of southern China. It’s by far the most Westernized city in the region—there’s no firewall here, so Google Maps actually works reliably. Everyone speaks decent English, so communication isn’t an issue. And you just can’t beat the Ding Ding trams.

* **The Peak Tram (山顶缆车)**: Almost a Disneyland-style experience, complete with music, big lines, and lots of commercial shops.
* **Suicide Cliff (自杀崖)**: A fantastic hike with an insane view of Hong Kong. Unlike the Peak Tram, it’s much quieter, but you’ll need to hike for about 40 minutes. There are two trails: one shorter but more dangerous, and another that’s mostly steps but longer.
* **The Big Buddha (天坛大佛)**: Located near the airport, it’s harder to reach compared to other attractions. You can take a cable car, a bus, or a taxi. It’s quite touristy but worth it if you haven’t seen many temples yet.
* **Happy Valley Horse Races (跑马地赛马场)**: Usually held on Wednesdays (closed in August). It’s a fun experience and definitely worth checking out.
   * Many people head to Wan Chai (湾仔) afterward for nightlife, where girls often get free drinks and entry. My favorite part, though, is how all the broke students end up hanging out by the 7-Eleven near the clubs. This spot is at the intersection of Lockhart Road and Fenwick Street.
* **Yick Cheong Building (益昌大厦)**: the popular spot for photography with massive buildings packed tightly together.
* **Central-Mid-Levels Escalators (中环至半山自动扶梯)**: A fun network of escalators. This area has a heavy expat presence and tons of international food options.
* **Mong Kok (旺角)**: A more local area with many stalls and the famous Ladies Market.
* **Temple Street (庙街)**: Another more local spot with markets.
* **Ozone (天际酒吧)**: The highest bar in the world, offering great views of Hong Kong’s light show.
   * The light show itself is very underwhelming i should say, especially coming from the rest of china.
* **Causeway Bay (铜锣湾)**: The biggest shopping district in Hong Kong.
* **SoHo (苏豪区)**: The main nightlife district, packed with bars, restaurants, and clubs.

# Guangzhou (广州, 5 days)

Guangzhou is a pretty fun city, but I wouldn’t call it outstanding. It has colonial roots, interesting food, and unique architecture. It’s also by far the least Westernized of China’s first-tier cities. If you’re into physically shopping for replicas, this is the place to be. My favorite thing here was biking through the districts where they pack up Taobao orders—absolute chaos but somehow it works. It’s called the fake quarter and it’s near the Cathedral.

* **Sacred Heart Cathedral (石室圣心大教堂)**: A large cathedral.
* **Canton Tower (广州塔)**: A touristy mess with insane lines and very high prices, especially for the bubble cars everyone talks about.
* **Liurong Temple (六榕寺)**: A small temple, nothing particularly special.
* **Dafo Temple (大佛寺)**: As the name suggests, it’s a large temple.
* **Beijing Lu (北京路)**: The main street for food, with both commercial and more local options.
* **Shamian Island (沙面岛)**: Features old European-style buildings, pensioners playing rock music, and cool trees. It’s also a bit of an influencer hotspot, as the European-style buildings are perfect for photos.
* **Dongshankou (东山口)**: Another district with old European buildings, but this one is filled with hip Chinese clothing brands.
* **Zhujiang New Town (珠江新城)**: The central business district of Guangzhou. You can walk through the park for some great views.
* **Running Tip**: The best place to run is along the river, where there’s an actual running path on one side.

# Kaiping (开平, 1 day)

Kaiping is known for its old settlements, and this guide explains it way better than I could: [Kaiping, China: A Guide to the Land of Overseas Chinese](https://unborderedlife.com/kaiping-china-a-guide-to-the-land-of-overseas-chinese/).

Here are my quick tips:

* The attractions all look pretty similar, so one day is more than enough to see the highlights.
* Kaiping itself doesn’t have much to offer—you should only visit for the old settlements.
* Using **DiDi** to get from one site to another works fine. There’s also a free shuttle bus if you can figure it out, though it might require some patience.

# Shenzhen (深圳, 3 days)

Shenzhen is a relatively new city, filled mostly with yuppies. In some ways, it feels quite Western—smoking isn’t allowed in clubs, and spitting isn’t as common as in other parts of China. However, because it’s mainly a working city without much history and no old people swag, there isn’t a ton to do.

* **Lianhuashan Park (莲花山公园)**: A popular spot for mid-level skyline views and photos of the Deng Xiaoping statue.
* **Shenzhen Bay Park (深圳湾公园)**: A great place to enjoy ground-level views of the skyline.
* **Shenzhen Museum (深圳博物馆)**: Focuses on the history of the city. It’s free, but not particularly impressive.
* **Dafen Oil Painting Village (大芬油画村)**: A massive painting district that’s quite commercial but also unique and fun—definitely worth a visit.
* **Dongmen (东门)**: A commercial Chinese shopping area. Personally, I didn’t find it enjoyable.
* **OCT Loft (华侨城创意文化园)**: A trendy area with art exhibitions, clothing stores, and a cool vibe. Found it a bit underwhelming though.
* **Huaqiangbei Street (华强北路)**: Home to Huaqiang Electronics World (华强电子世界), the hardware market that makes Shenzhen famous. This is by far the city’s most unique attraction, but if you’re not into electronics, it’s probably only fun for a couple of hours.

So until this was my original plan I made after this I decided to extend my stay and freestyle more, because of this it could come off as more chaotic.

# Gansu(9 days)

# Lanzhou (兰州, 1 day)

Lanzhou is essentially the gateway to Gansu, whether you’re flying in or taking the HSR. Everyone told me there wasn’t much to do here, so I took their word for it. I had some **Lanzhou Beef Noodles (牛肉面)**, did my workouts, and left the next morning at 8:30. The city didn’t feel particularly special while I was there.

# Xiahe (夏河, 3 days)

Xiahe was the whole reason I started my Gansu route. It’s a bit of a pain to get here since there are only one or two buses daily from **Lanzhou (兰州)**, **Xining (西宁)**, and **Tongren (同仁)**, but the effort is worth it. Due to the limited transportation, the restrictive five vacation days that most Chinese people have, and the cold weather, not so many tourists visit this plac

Xiahe is an excellent way to experience Tibetan culture without the security hassles of visiting Tibet. Keep in mind that it’s at an altitude of around 3,000 meters, so take precautions if you have issues with high altitudes when walking or running.

Here’s what I explored:

* **The Monastery (拉卜楞寺, Labrang Monastery)**: The main attraction in Xiahe. I visited during the off-season when they weren’t charging for entry, but it seems they do during peak season.
   * There’s a hike up the mountain next to the monastery, which offers some incredible views.
* **Sangke Grasslands (桑科草原)**: A stunning expanse of grasslands reachable by taxi (DiDi doesn’t work here). When I visited, it was snowing, and I didn’t see anyone else because it was off-season, but I loved the freedom of hiking up hills without anyone caring if I went off the path.
   * For the return trip, there weren’t any taxis available. At the main intersection, small shuttle bus taxis seemed to pick up people and bring them back to Xiahe for a small fee. I’m not entirely sure how it works, but your best bet is to walk to the intersection and ask someone how to get back to Xiahe—that’s what I did.

# Xining (西宁, 1 day)

Xining was basically the only place with a bus route and good infrastructure that allowed me to continue further west. Even though it was more of a transit stop, I really enjoyed it. The food was great, the streets were dynamic, and the people were friendly and curious.

* **Kumbum Monastery (塔尔寺)**: A large and fascinating monastery with some impressive artifacts. Definitely worth visiting if you’re passing through.
* **Dongguan Great Mosque (东关清真大寺)**: An active mosque where prayers are regularly held. It’s especially interesting to see if you haven’t been to a Chinese-style mosque before.

# Zhangye (张掖, 2.5 days)

The city itself is actually pretty decent. **One important thing to note, which isn’t mentioned in most itineraries I saw on here, is that there are no mini shuttle buses to the main attractions during the off-season. This means you’ll need to book a driver or drive yourself if you have a license. Taxis are available, but they have quotas for each main attraction.**

* **Danxia Rainbow Mountains (张掖丹霞国家地质公园)**: The main attraction, but it gave me Zhangjiajie vibes—basically going from one shuttle bus stop to the next. Not terribly impressive, but still fun to visit. It might be way more crowded in the summer, though.
* **Pingshan Grand Canyon (平山大峡谷)**: Half of it was closed when I visited, and I didn’t have much time to explore the rest. Because of that, I can’t say too much about it.
* **Matisi Grottoes (马蹄寺石窟)**: Some blogs hyped this up as a must-see, but I found it underwhelming and far from the city. If you’re also going to **Dunhuang**, and you need to skip one of the four main attractions in Zhangye, I’d definitely skip this one.
* **Big Buddha Temple (大佛寺)**: A temple located in the city. It hasn’t been heavily renovated, so it retains its old, characteristic charm. The Buddha inside is genuinely massive and worth seeing

# Dunhuang (敦煌, 1.5 days)

Dunhuang is much more remote. After visiting, I had to backtrack a few stations to get back on the HSR and continue west to Xinjiang. That said, it’s a pretty nice place to explore for a couple of days.

* **Mogao Caves (莫高窟)**: This is the main attraction, and while some people complain about it (mainly because you’re required to take an official bus, follow a guide, and can’t take pictures inside the caves), I think it makes sense. Given the overload of cars and Chinese tourists who tend to touch everything, this system helps preserve the site. If you join the English group, it’s usually just a handful of people, so you’ll be fine.
   * One thing to note: During the off-season, they bring a lot of high schoolers from rural areas, and they can go absolutely nuts when they see a foreigner—like Justin Bieber in his prime time-level of hysteria. Be prepared if you don’t like that type of attention.
* **Crescent Lake (月牙泉)**: A bit underwhelming, even with the lower tourist count during the off-season. I just walked up the dunes and kept going until I saw no one. That was pretty fun since I don’t often get to explore places like that

# Xinjiang ( 9 days)

A controversial region, but I’d heard so much about it that I had to visit. Overall, the security wasn’t as bad as I expected, though I stayed in well-known destinations and didn’t venture to less-traveled areas. That said, security measures are definitely more intense than in other parts of China, especially when traveling between cities in Xinjiang. Expect more thorough searches and passport checks when boarding trains—you should plan to arrive 15 minutes earlier than usual.

You may also be stopped by police at train stations or shuttle buses, where they’ll ask why you’re visiting. They often take a photo of your passport, ask for your hotel address, and request your driver’s contact information. In **Kucha (库车)**, they even sent a police officer a few times to confirm I was staying at my hotel—though they just wanted a picture with me as proof for their higher-ups.

Beyond Ürümqi (乌鲁木齐), so more west, there’s no HSR—only regular train lines. These can get crowded on weekends, but if you take a sleeper bunk, there’s a limit to the number of people onboard. Train rides were generally around 6 hours.

Another interesting that i’ve noticed is that people here always ask if I’m from the US directly, they don’t ask where i’m from, If someone know why I would be very curious to the answer.

# Turfan (吐鲁番, 3 days)

Turfan has a lot to see, but most spots require hiring a driver. Here’s what I explored:

* **Flaming Mountains (火焰山)**: There’s an official scenic spot, but you’ll probably see plenty of the mountains just while driving to nearby attractions—it’s massive.
* **Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves (柏孜克里克千佛洞)**: Ancient grottoes, but most were looted by Europeans, so there’s not much left to see.
* **Turfan Museum (吐鲁番博物馆)**: Not particularly special, but it’s a fun way to learn about the region’s history.
* **Emin Minaret (苏公塔)**: An old mosque that is inactive, the Chinese descriptions avoid mentioning that it’s a mosque. The signage is so vague it’s almost funny.
* **Jiaohe Ruins (交河故城)**: One of two ancient cities here. Jiaohe has the most structures still standing and is more detailed.
* **Gaochang Ruins (高昌故城)**: Less intact than Jiaohe, but worth a visit if you’re nearby and have the time.
* **Tuyugou Ancient Village (吐峪沟古村)**: Currently under renovation, with new floors and houses being added. It’s likely to turn into a touristy Lijiang type spot in a year or so enter with caution.
* **Grape Valley (葡萄沟)**: Famous for its vineyards, though I went in winter when there were no grapes.
* **Clubbing**: Some teenagers invited me to a club, and their mom even drove us there at 1 AM. The vibe was very Chinese until the Uyghur music started playing—then everyone stood up and started doing Uyghur dance

# Kucha (库车, 3 days

Kucha is the least touristy of the three cities I visited in Xinjiang. However, judging by the heavily ""Instagrammable"" renovations done to the old town after the re-education program, I don’t have much hope for it retaining its authenticity. This was also the place where I had the most interactions with police, but they were always calm, patient, and respectful. I never felt unsafe or scare

* **Tianshan Grand Canyon (天山神秘大峡谷)**: A pretty long drive, but absolutely worth it. You’ll pass some insane mountain scenery on the way there.
* **Kucha Old City (库车老城)**: Recently renovated, so it has lost much of its old charm. Most of it was closed during the off-season when I visited.
* **Kucha Royal Palace (库车王府)**: Easy to visit but quite forgettable overall.
* **Kucha Grand Mosque (库车大寺)**: While the old city has been renovated this mosque seems to have been left to decay. While I appreciated the old charm, it doesn’t appear to be active anymore either and has a dark side to 

# Kashgar (喀什, 3 days)

Someone on this subreddit said that if you can only visit one place in Xinjiang, make it Kashgar—and I absolutely agree. You’ll find the most culture and charm here. Interestingly, I was never stopped by police in Kashgar, although I did see Uyghur people being stopped at the train statio

* **Old City (喀什古城)**: The old city has been heavily renovated, but you can still find a few traditional teahouses, which are definitely worth visiting. The locals are incredibly welcoming.
* **Animal Bazaar (喀什牲畜市场)**: There weren’t any livestock sales during my visit, but on Wednesday, I saw ""cock fights""—basically hens fighting each other. It’s not to the death, and I still don’t fully understand how it works, but the passion among the participants was clear. Everyone brings their own hens, and it’s quite the spectacle. The food stalls outside were amazing too.
* **Abakh Hoja Tomb (阿帕克霍加墓)**: Definitely worth a quick visit.
* **Id Kah Mosque (艾提尕尔清真寺)**: This mosque is closed to tourists during prayer times but is a great spot for a quick visit, as it’s right in the old town.

**A quick note:** Many Han Chinese people warned me about the ""Wild West"" nature of Xinjiang, Gansu, and Tibet, with concerns about theft and safety. I never felt unsafe, and the hospitality here was good—even compared to the rest of China, which is already extremely safe. Safety here should not be a concern for anyone.

# Chongqing (4 days)

Not sure if I would enjoy the city another time for a few days but I end up staying way longer then anticipated, There is just something about the food, people and overall vibes that I love. Check part one for all the detai

# More of Guangxi (广西)

I liked Guangxi the last time I visited—the mild weather made it an easy choice to fill some extra days.

# Nanning (南宁, 1 day)

I treated Nanning as more of a gateway again, as I didn’t find much online that seemed super interesting. That said, the food scene here is great. I stumbled upon a food stall area that stretched over 1 km—it was insane. They really love their food here.

# Jingxi (靖西, 2.5 days)

This place felt like no man’s land for foreigners. I couldn’t find much information online, even on Reddit, so I relied on suggestions from 小红书. A key thing to note is that Jingxi is very close to the Vietnamese border, with some attractions just 20 km away. Because of this, security was far more intense than even in Xinjiang because of the human trafficking to the scam compounds I assume.

While exploring, I got stuck 20 km from the border with a dead scooter battery. Apparently, the advertised 80 km range was closer to 30 km. A local shop kindly charged the battery for me and even cooked me dinner while I waited. However, in just a few hours, I encountered more police checks than during my entire Xinjiang trip. Some drunk locals even tried to take my scooter keys and called the police on me, thinking I was a spy when I was taking a picture of an interesting building.

Unless you’re really into waterfalls, I’d suggest sticking to region around Yangshuo. If you do go, hire an experienced driver or guide. The main attractions here are waterfalls, and while the two largest ones are touristy, the smaller ones are less crowded and great for photography.

**Most Popular (Touristy):**

* **Tongling Grand Canyon (通灵大峡谷)**
* **Gulongshan Grand Canyon (古龙山大峡谷)**

**Smaller and Better for Pictures:**

* **Sandieling Waterfall (三叠岭瀑布):** A great spot for photos and a fairly large waterfall.
* **Erlang Waterfall (二郎瀑布):** Includes a cool bridge.
* **Aibu Waterfall (爱布瀑布):** I didn’t make it here due to my scooter issues.
* **乌鸦山:** A scenic hike to the top with incredible views. However, I visited during the off-season when it was foggy, so I couldn’t see anything. If you go, only visit on clear days. Check 小红书 for instructio

# Everything close to Shanghai (16 days)

# Nanjing (南京, 4 days)

Nanjing offers an interesting mix of history (as one of China’s former capitals), lots of trees, and modern technology. However, it doesn’t stand out as a must-visit destination. It has a bit of everything—historical sites, nice parks, a few expat hangouts, cool malls, and museums—which can make it feel less special if you’re also visiting places like Beijing and Shanghai.

I followed much of the outline from this guide, so credit to the author: [Nanjing Travel Guide by Fabio Nodari](https://www.fabionodariphoto.com/en/nanjing-travel-guide/).

* **Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall (侵华日军南京大屠杀遇难同胞纪念馆):** speaks for itself, definitely worth visiting though.
* **Niushou Mountain (牛首山):** An impressive site with a modern temple complex. It's very touristy though.
* **The Grand Baoen Temple Heritage and Scenic Area (大报恩寺遗址公园):** A mix of ruins, modern reconstructions, and museum exhibits. Definitely worth a visit. Keep in mind that tickets are free on Mondays, so they often sell out quickly that day.
* **Nanjing City Wall (南京城墙):** It’s a wall, but it offers nice views of the nearby lake. It’s also a great spot for running!
* **Jiming Temple (鸡鸣寺):** Very crowded but close to the city wall, so worth a quick visit.
* **Deji Plaza (德基广场):** A high-end mall with some unique features, including insane toilets and a surprisingly good art gallery. It's especially interesting if you haven’t been to any of China’s fancier malls.
* **Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum (中山陵):** A large and touristy site. Unfortunately, parts of it were under renovation when I visited, so I couldn’t see much.

# Hangzhou (杭州, 3 days)

I really loved Hangzhou. While most people rave about West Lake (西湖), I actually found it a bit boring. The area around the Longjing Tea Fields is much better. There are plenty of off-the-beaten-path trails where you can hike up or down, and you're never too far from civilization. It’s peaceful yet accessible, and exploring this area was the highlight of my trip.

Here’s what I explored:

* **Lingyin Temple (灵隐寺)**: Very touristy but still impressive. You can hike up the nearby mountain for an amazing view.
* **Six Harmonies Pagoda (六和塔)**: Not particularly exciting, but still a fun visit. It hasn’t been artificially over-renovated, which adds to its charm.
* **China National Silk Museum (中国丝绸博物馆)**: Interesting, though not remarkable. Worth a visit if you have extra time.
* **Longjing Tea Fields (龙井茶园)**: I spent most of my time here. You can hike up or down through different trails, and no one minds if you go off-track. It's a fantastic place for photography, with beautiful scenery. As you explore the area, you’ll stumble upon hidden gems like temples and gardens. I didn’t write down their names, but the joy of discovering these spots while biking and hiking was the best part for me.
* For running I would stick to the lake, that is long enough for most runs, or you could trail run at the tea fields.

# Shanghai (上海, 2 days)

I was mainly in Shanghai to go clubbing for the weekend before continuing my trip. When planning a visit to Shanghai, you’ll probably hear one of two opinions: either people say you’ll get bored after a day, or that even two weeks won’t be enough to explore half the city. It really depends on what you’re into.

Expats love Shanghai because it’s the most Westernized city in China with the best clubs. In some areas, it barely feels like China anymore—especially in clubs, where you’ll find proper dance floors, niche music genres, and Western-style bars. These are things that are hard to find elsewhere in China. However, many travelers coming to China are more interested in Chinese culture and are often mature couples, which can lead to disappointment for those expecting something more traditional.

That said, Shanghai is a great place to experience how modern China has evolved over the past few decades if you’re there for a few days. It’s a massive city, so there’s plenty to keep you entertained. The Bund offers iconic skyline views, and the French Concession has a unique mix of hip shops, bars, and clubs.

**Rooftop Bars**

* **W Hotel**: Famous for its parties and events, this bar offers an impressive bottom-up view of the skyline.
* **Ritz-Carlton**: The best top-down view of the Bund. Drinks here are about as expensive as at the Oriental Pearl Tower so I would just go here.

**Clubbing**

* **INS**: This place is wild—it feels like a shopping mall full of different clubs. It’s the hottest club right now, and it’s full every night. It’s my favorite club in Shanghai but I’m not that much into techno and other niche stuff, though I still haven’t fully figured out how it works with all the different bracelets and stuff.
* **Unight**: A WeChat application that helps you check for special events and club nights around the city.

**Museums**

* **Urban Planning Museum (上海城市规划馆)**: Learn about Shanghai’s architectural and urban development.
* **Propaganda Poster Art Center (上海宣传画艺术中心)**: A small but fascinating museum showcasing propaganda art from different eras.
* **Jewish Refugee Museum (上海犹太难民纪念馆)**: A museum highlighting the history of Jewish refugees in Shanghai during World War II.

**Temples** *(only if you haven’t seen many Chinese temples yet)*

* **Longhua Temple (龙华寺)**
* **Jade Buddha Temple (玉佛寺)**

**Other Places**

* **Yu Garden (豫园)**: This place is an absolute tourist madhouse, but it does have a Bib Gourmand soup dumpling spot that’s worth checking out.
* **French Concession**: Full of French vibes, this area is where you’ll find all the trendy shops, bars, and clubs. I’d recommend booking a hotel in this area if you plan to spend time exploring the nightlife scene.

# Suzhou (苏州, 2 days)

Suzhou is very popular with foreigners as a day trip from Shanghai. While it has become quite touristy, the canals and gardens are still charming enough to explore for a day or two. The city still has a living local population, so if you want to go out and have fun, there are options for clubbing and parties. The main attractions are ancient streets and gardens, but after visiting two or three of them, they can start to feel a bit repetitive.

* **Humble Administrator’s Garden (拙政园)**
* **Lion Grove Garden (狮子林)**
* **Lingering Garden (留园)**
* **Suzhou Museum (苏州博物馆)**: A well-designed museum with free entry. However, you’ll need to reserve your spot in advance.
* **Shantang Street (山塘街)**: A crowded, touristy street with nice canals. There isn’t much else to see, but it's worth a short visit.
* **Xiyuan Temple (西园寺-山门殿)**: A temple filled with cats
* **Shantang Street (山塘街)**: This ancient street was my favorite. It still feels somewhat local, and I had a great Christmas Eve party here.

# Huangshan (黄山, 1 day)

I had a few extra days, so I decided to spend a day at Huangshan (Yellow Mountain) and stayed overnight. I hiked up, explored most of the open paths (though many were closed due to winter), and then hiked down the other side to catch the bus back to the main station. It’s totally doable in one day if you’re reasonably fit and plan to hike both up and down. Personally, I wouldn’t stay longer since touristy spots like this don’t offer much variety beyond the mountain itself.

The upside is that Huangshan involves a lot more hiking compared to places like Zhangjiajie. Once you move away from the main cable station and the more crowded areas, it gets quieter and emptier. At times, it actually feels like a proper hike, which was a nice change.

# Hangzhou (杭州, 2 days)

Had some days to fill up so decided to chill here for a bit more

# Shanghai (上海, 2 days)

Had to finish off the last night with a banger obviously, needed to fly back from Shanghai too.

# Final Remarks

I love this country and hope to be back soon with improved mandarin, but it’s important to note that China isn’t for everyone. This isn’t like visiting Thailand, for example. People here can be loud, smoke indoors, spit everywhere, and it's normal to see someone slapping their dog. They eat just about everything, and sometimes you might feel like a celebrity with random people taking pictures of you—especially in less international or less affluent cities where foreigners are rare. If those kinds of things bother you, it might not be the best travel destination for you.

That being said, Chinese people have always been incredibly hospitable to me. I’ve had people help me out, treat me to dinner, and even give me gifts. However, I’m fully aware that much of this treatment is because I’m a young, “handsome”, Western-looking European. If you don’t fit that profile, you might not get the same special treatment, which could impact your experience. It’s something to keep in mind—your trip might feel very different from mine based on how locals perceive y

It happens a lot where a woman falls for a man and doesn’t care that he’s not successful or driven. She loves him for other reasons. He may be kind, good-looking, funny etc. She brushes off the fact that he isn’t too fussed about bettering himself, has an easy/no job, isn’t thinking about promotions, climbing the ladder etc. She admires his non-materialistic ways. 

Then bam, one day it’ll hit you. One day you’ll start thinking about growing a family. You’ll think you ideally may want to take some time off work. You may want to stay home with your baby a little while longer. You don’t hate the idea of staying home for at least a couple of years, just to take in everything, breastfeed in peace and not miss any milestones with your baby. But you realise… you can’t. Because the man you’ve chosen to be the father of your baby could never pay all the bills. You absolutely have to work. You have to leave your baby. You consider nannies/daycares. You don’t love any of these. He offers to be the stay-at-home parent. It makes sense because you make more money anyway. And suddenly you’re in this family dynamic you never planned. Is this what you envisioned growing up? That you’d be unwillingly working at a time that you always thought you’d be home with your baby/toddler going to Mommy & Me classes and coffee dates with your cute little companion. Instead, the undriven man you chose to settle down with gets to stay home, nap with the baby, and bottle-feed the breastmilk you have to pump at work.   

This may not apply to all of you, but for those of you whom it strikes a chord, please please pick your boyfriends/husbands carefully and don’t unwittingly end up living a life that your younger self would consider a nightmare. ",5,1739973594.0,LifeAdvice,1,0.86,False

I stumbled into productivity by half accident. There's two main things I did.

I had some problems with my stomach and to fix that I changed coffee to tea in the morning. This was happy accident, because now I'm more calm during the day. If I drink coffee, it's a small cup but not after 13 o'clock. Coffee masks tiredness. Thanks to this change I'm now more in-tune with myself and I sleep better. I've now woken up naturally early to start working at 7.

Then maybe more significant, I stumbled into Pomodoro method (which is 25 minutes of work, short break, repeat 4 times, half-hour rest). This got my thinking, how am I supposed to apply this to my workday when there's half-hour break every 2 hours? I was suffering from Good Worker syndrome, I can't just do nothing for like two whole hours during the day! I'm responsible for logging all my working hours. But I stuck with it, I scheduled the working time and breaks using pen and paper calendar. I made segments of work and rest. To my surprise, turns out I actually get more stuff done now working less?

The thing is, before I was feeling tired because I didn't take proper breaks and I actually spent more time avoiding work than I now spend in breaks. So I was browsing news, reddit, laying on the couch, etc. and I spanked myself for not being motivated to work. So I spent all this energy feeling bad about myself and I didn't even get any rest! Instead of that I now do proper breaks away from computer. Stretch, clean-up, make tea, drink water, take a walk with dog or occasionally browse reddit. But browsing media can be mentally taxing so I first try to do something else. When I do proper breaks, I do proper work.

In the end the 25 min pomodoros were too short for me, so I changed them to 1,5 hours of deep work, following half an hour break. Lunch break is one hour. This is my current workday. So it totals to 6 hours work time and 2 hours rest.

So to sum it up, resting properly is not beneficial only to you, but for your employer as well. It keeps you happy, so take care of yourself, schedule your workday and take proper breaks. I can't remember the last time I've been this productive. I get stuff done and quit my day early. I even have energy left after work for other stuff now.",3,1739973568.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

After messing up my first post (the, apparently common, ‘does my coffee look good’) I got a 1kg bag to experiment with and try to dial in my coffee.

>Dose: 18g  
Brew ratio: 1:2

I’ll share the results below and then the conclusion I'm drawing from this

>^(Espresso #1)  
Grind setting: 11  
Time: 52 sec.  
Note: terrible. bitter and a burning taste in the back of my throat.  


>^(Espresso #2)  
Grind setting: 13  
Time: 35 sec.  
Note: more crema / body. Still a bit bitter and that burning taste in the back of my throat.|  


>^(Espresso #3)  
Grind setting: 14  
Time: 32 sec.  
Note: timed from the moment I turned my machine on. Espresso #2 might've had a longer extraction. Still bitter and sharp / burning.  


>^(Espresso #4)  
Grind setting: 15  
Time: 26 sec.  
Note: Less bitter but crema / body also a bit gone. Seems like some of the flavors start shining through a bit but it's a little watery.  


>^(Espresso #5)  
Grind setting: 14.5  
Time: 25 sec.  
Note: Body / crema seems nice. Still little to no real flavor. Most of what I'm tasting is still bitter. This was the best in my opinion so far.  


>^(Espresso #6)  
Grind setting: 14  
Time: 28 sec.  
Note: Less bitter and better than the ones before (also better than Espresso #3 it seems like). Still relatively little to no real flavor.  


>^(Espresso #7)  
Grind setting: 13.5  
Time: 26 sec.  
Note: pretty much the same as Espresso #6  


>^(Espresso #8)  
Grind setting: 13  
Time: 30 sec  
Yield: 38gr (whoops, a bit off with 1:2.1 ratio)  
Note: more bitter again

**Conclusion**  
Okay so after tasting 8 espressos I feel kind of lost. I notice that the extraction time sometimes seems off. A grind setting 13.5 and 14.5 (#5 and #7) take about the same time while grind setting 14 takes longer? This seems weird. I'm starting to doubt if my grinder (Sage Dose Control) is up for the task.

I'm using a spring levered tamper so I'm hoping that any inconsistencies in that are out of the question. I distribute my grounds with a WDT tool and then a level distribution before tamping. So it seems like the grind setting is the only variable in my shots.

I'm also considering the possibility that maybe my beans are just 'bad'. They're from a respectable roaster and are 16 days old (from roast date). Their flavour profile is supposed to be ""Caramel, Cherry and Milk Chocolate"", but I'm not recognising any of these flavours. It's a decaf bean btw.

**Context**  
I've had beans from a company in Florence (D612) and brought those home. This was when I just had my setup and little to no idea what I was doing. And with those beans, I pulled the best espresso I've ever tasted. The profile of chocolate was so apparent, it tasted like I had a melting chocolate bar mixed with espresso in my mouth. Just amazing. Of course I have no idea what I dialed in. But I want to give some context that, while I don't have well developed taste buds for espresso, I have experienced a really good one. And what I've been brewing so far isn't it. Needless to say, after those beans nothing ever got close.

**TLDR**  
Really hope I can receive constructive feedback to try and improve my shots. After the Florence beans, making coffee has just been underwhelming and I can't seem to get it right. I'm not sure if it's the beans or my grinder, but I can't seem to get a good shot and my shots also seem very inconsistent.",2,1739973413.0,espresso,5,1.0,False

Since we moved to this new place, 5 years ago, he hasn't made a lot of friends, none really. I ask him to go with the friends I've made and he just complains about them afterwards so I've stopped asking him to come, leaving the invitation open always, but he doesn't want to come. 

Anyway, for years now, he plays video games on the phone with his bff in a different time zone so my SO is up super late. He is also drinking throughout the entire gaming session. When he's done, he will come in the bedroom and argue with me about something. I am sleeping at this point most of the time and am so mad he would just barge in and start a fight with me. I told him last night it was abusive, and he said I was being dramatic and 2 minutes later he passes out. 

This morning he'll probably go get me a coffee and not bring it up at all. And I don't feel like starting anything, so I don't say anything. 

Idk. Just needed to tell someone that he does this to me, frequently. And I hate it. And I wish our lives weren't so connected at this point. ",16,1739973373.0,TwoXChromosomes,10,0.86,False

Using treats and clickers. She knows recall (when inside and when on leash outside), sit (but stay is tougher), and is largely crate and leash trained. 

We have a handful of issues (listed below) that we think an e collar would be beneficial to use for, but I've read carefully that these things should be used to reinforce, not teach. I'm just not sure if she's in the teach stage or the reinforce stage yet.

LEASH TRAINING

her leashing is pretty good with no distractions. Big issue is she is very much a frustrated greeter. She loves playing with other dogs and will pull bark and growl when she sees one. Through clicker training she has learned to look and depending on distance there is a 50/50 chance she will recall to use when we click. Close up it's game over. I specifically don't want to remove her friendliness, just control it.

BARKING/CHEWING

Our dogs will rarely bark or chew when we are home. Barking usually takes place when people in the apartment walk by and chewing is a quick grab shoe and stops when we tell her not to do it. The issue lies when we aren't home. She has toys everywhere to choose from but she will decide to grab everything she shouldn't when we leave. Similarly her barking doesn't stop as quickly. We live right next door to a coffee shop which we have gone to, watched her ok the cameras and tried to correct from afar with limited success 

RECALL

This might fall under the leash training, but basically the same thing. Her recall doesn't exist when she's focusing on cooler things

Basically, we want to do this but want to do it right. One thing we are considering is getting it, but only on the sound only mode for now since I think a big issue is the clicker just isn't loud enough sometimes

Every time I look at you, I want to measure the expanse of your back with my lips.

I want to press my thumb on your cupid’s bow just to feel it yield. I want to cup the edge of your jaw and feel your very existence in my palms.

I want to hear you talk about the people you’ve spoken to throughout your day. Who do we dislike today? Which gossip will amuse us as we walk home?

I want to fiddle with the beads of that bracelet I gave you as you wear it. You have no idea how much thought and anxiety went into choosing the crystal and its meanings. How it could maybe even help you in your struggles. 

I want to bury my nose in your hair and breathe in the lingering shampoo after a tiring day. Press out the aches out of your back and calves as we lay. 

We’re both very tired people. You even more so with your responsibilities. Sometimes, I think you’re a masochistic workaholic, and I’m too calculating and insecure in a sense that I think you’d never have time for me or the energy to know me or entertain the idea of me. 

So I observe from afar. 

You’re way out of my league. Taller, richer, more connected. I think about all of this things as I weigh my odds. You’re a boy who drinks Starbucks everyday, even twice, and I’m the instant coffee type. You’re vivacious and a social butterfly (kind of), and I’m reserved and keep to my own group of friends. We’re both soft, effeminate men, looking for a rock to secure ourselves to in this turbid, ridiculously demanding life. I’m not sure I can be that rock, but I’d gladly weather the waves with you if we can try. 

I think about all these things, and I figured, I’m better off watching you from afar.

She said that she had studied in the US and had designed many bridges across china and so forth.  Then she told her about the water, she said that the government has been trying to silence her for many years and that they poison her food and water, thats why she needs the water international students drink, she said that she had bought coffee from the university canteen and that it tasted weird so she had lab tests done on it and it came back highly acidic. Then she dropped a crazy lore about some ancient writings, basically she said that every few hundred years the world goes into chaos and a savior whos name starts with “Z” will come and save all of us and that her name began with Z hence she was our savior and that she needs to be protected at all costs. She said more about some Chinese characters and how it perfectly lines up with her being the chosen one. This went on for about 40 minutes. 

She came back to the topic of water and asked us where she can get some, so we decided to just take her to the building we mostly have classes in, when we got there it was almost closing down but we went and got her some water, she had the water card from the university but it wasn’t working so i paid around 6 yuan and she filled about 5 big jugs of water and she went her way and so did we.

No side effects for me at all minus the first day when I had a smidge of nausea from not eating enough with the meds. I realized this, and after day one I made sure to eat breakfast as soon as I stepped foot in the kitchen then the meds as soon as I was done eating. Then I made a cup of coffee an hour later.

I'm also not dealing with any constipation. Maybe because I am able to still drink coffee? Not sure, but it hasn't been an issue for me at all.

SW: 195.6 CW: 192.8 GW: 150 Height: 5'6""

The big thing for me has been protein. I've become obsessed with hitting 100g everyday, and honestly it's a lot easier than I expected. I don't eat a ton of meat, but I do love cottage cheese, yogurt, oats, etc. I'm actually easily eating more like 120g of protein most days.

For breakfast every morning I've been having overnight oats made with oats, chia seeds, Ryse Skippy PB protein powder, Fairlife nonfat milk, and some protein yogurt. That alone gets me to about 50 grams of protein. While others are no longer consuming coffee, I am able to without any issue, and I do an iced coffee made with espresso, Fairlife nonfat milk, and a protein creamer which is another 20ish grams of protein. 

I walk on my treadmill everyday for 30-45 mins, which isn't new. I'm a homeschool mom with two middle school aged kids, so I just walk while they do independent work. 

What I have noticed is I am not snacking really. Normally every time I walk through the kitchen I pick at something, and I can't recall that happening since I started the meds. The one time I did snack it was very intentional, and I measured it out. 

I have a kitchen scale that I use for baking, and now I'm using it for everything. I'm realizing I was never really an unhealthy eater...I just was eyeballing portion sizes and getting it very, very wrong...and snacking too much. I also was gravitated towards carbs, and now that I've become protein obsessed this past week I see how much fuller I feel.

Over the last seven days my average calorie consumption was 1,417 calories per day, protein was 37%, carbs 29%, fat 34% according to Samsung Health.",1,1739972976.0,HersWeightloss,0,1.0,False

I would never have had coffee in the early stages/ never needed it at all but the past 3/4 months I wouldn’t think to not have coffee. It gives me the energy to go to the gym and actually about my day. 
The past few days I’ve realised how much my routine has needed to change for various reasons. Even though I’d slowly like to ween off taking my meds everyday, i started first by  deciding not to have coffee with the meds. I thought I would start doing less high intensity workouts because my main reason for the coffee was often a pre workout type use. 
Anyway the lack of coffee has made me realise how much my meds have stopped working and if anything I have an insane amount of brain fog and genuinely feel more slow with them. I feel nauseous and just slightly unsure where to go from here with my meds because surely it’s not healthy to rely on coffee etc// I just don’t know why they feel like this. Any advice ?

## ⁢Key Features to Consider‌ When Choosing a Wireless Handheld Projector

Now that we've explored the​ benefits​ and target ⁤audiences, let's delve⁢ into the key‍ features you should consider ⁣when selecting a ‌wireless handheld projector:

*​   **Brightness (Lumens):** ⁤Brightness is measured ​in lumens and determines how visible the ‍projected​ image will ⁣be⁤ in different lighting conditions.For dark rooms, 200-300⁤ lumens may ‌suffice. For moderately lit ‌environments,500-1000‍ lumens⁣ is​ recommended.⁣ For bright rooms or⁣ outdoor use, you'll need a projector with ⁤1000+ lumens.

*  ‍‍ **Resolution:** Resolution refers to the⁤ number of pixels in the projected⁣ image. Higher resolution results in sharper and more detailed⁤ images. Common resolutions for handheld⁤ projectors include 480p (standard definition), 720p (HD), and 1080p (Full HD). For presentations and movies, ⁢720p or 1080p is recommended.

*   **Contrast Ratio:** Contrast ratio measures the difference⁣ between the darkest⁢ and brightest parts of ‍the image. A higher contrast ratio ⁢results in⁢ a more ⁤vibrant and detailed picture. Look for a contrast ratio of at least 1000:1 for good image quality.

* ‌  **Connectivity:** Wireless connectivity is a ⁤must-have‍ for a true wireless handheld projector. Ensure the projector supports Wi-Fi and ‍Bluetooth for seamless connection to your ‍devices. HDMI and​ USB⁢ ports are also‌ useful for connecting to ‍other sources. Screen mirroring expands your compatibility too.*   **Battery Life:** Battery⁣ life ⁤is crucial for portability. Check the projector's battery life rating and ⁣consider your‍ typical ​usage scenarios.⁢ Aim for a projector that can last through‍ your entire presentation or ‍movie without needing to be recharged.* ‍  **Projection Technology:** The‍ most common projection technologies used in handheld ⁢projectors are ‌DLP (digital Light Processing) and LED (Light ‌Emitting​ Diode). DLP projectors typically offer better contrast ratios and​ sharper images, while LED projectors are more energy-efficient and have a longer lifespan.

*   **Keystone correction:** Keystone correction automatically‌ adjusts the image to correct ⁤for⁣ distortion when the projector is not positioned perpendicular to the screen.‌ This feature is ​essential for achieving a square and properly aligned​ image.

*   **Size and Weight:** Consider the size and weight of ⁢the projector in relation to your portability needs. Opt for a compact and lightweight model that's easy to carry around.

*   **Operating System and Smart Features:**⁤ Some wireless handheld‌ projectors come with built-in operating systems like Android, allowing you to stream content‌ directly from⁤ the projector without needing⁤ to connect to an external device.

1it5scq,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpanishAIlines/comments/1it5scq/heres_everything_you_need_to_know_to_stop/,Here’s everything you need to know to stop confusing ser and estar!,"When learning Spanish, many people hear that ""ser"" is for permanent things and ""estar"" is for temporary ones. But then you come across phrases like ""Está casado"" (He is married) or ""El agua es fría"" (The water is cold)—and suddenly, the rule doesn’t seem so clear.

So why does this happen? Because the ""permanent vs. temporary"" rule is only a rough guideline, not a universal truth. In some cases, regional differences play a role—Spaniards and Latin Americans might use different verbs for the same concept. And in others, a small mistake can lead to an awkward misunderstanding, like the difference between ""Es aburrido"" (He is boring) and ""Está aburrido"" (He is bored).

To really master ""ser"" and ""estar"", you need more than just a simple rule—you need to understand their logic. Let’s break it down so you can stop second-guessing and use them with confidence!

 When to use ser:

* Names: ""Soy Camila."" (I'm Camila.)
* Nationalities: ""Soy de México."" (I'm from Mexico.)
* Jobs and professions: ""Mi madre es arquitecta."" (My mother is an architect.)
* Religion: ""Ana es católica."" (Shakira is Catholic.)
* Sex: ""Nosotros somos hombres y ellas son mujeres."" (We are men, and they are women.)
* Gender: ""Mapa es una palabra masculina en español."" (Mapa is a masculine word in Spanish.)
* Events: ""La boda es en la playa."" (The wedding is on the beach.)
* Definitions: ""Un león es un animal salvaje."" (A lion is a wild animal.)
* Materials: ""El collar es de oro."" (The necklace is made of gold.)
* Descriptions: ""Los rascacielos son altos."" (Skyscrapers are tall.)
* Family relationships: ""Él es mi primo."" (He's my cousin.)
* Possessions: ""El carro es de mi papá."" (The car belongs to my dad.)
* Time and dates: ""Hoy es viernes."" (Today is Friday.)

When to use estar: 

* Moods and states: ""Estoy agotado después del trabajo."" (I'm exhausted after work.)
* Locations: ""El supermercado está al final de la calle."" (The supermarket is at the end of the street.)
* Positions: ""Mis libros están sobre la mesa."" (My books are on the table.)
* Temporary situations: ""El restaurante está cerrado por reformas."" (The restaurant is closed for renovations.)
* The weather: ""Hoy está lloviendo mucho."" (It's raining a lot today.)
* With the present continuous tense: ""Estamos viendo una película interesante."" (We are watching an interesting movie.)
* Reactions and changes in perception: ""¡Tu café está frío!"" (Your coffee is cold!)

 When to use both:

* Relationship status: ""Mis padres están casados, pero mi tío es soltero."" (My parents are married, but my uncle is single.)
* Health conditions: ""Es ciego."" (He is blind.) / ""Está ciego por la luz."" (He is blinded by the light.)

Adjectives that change meaning depending on ser or estar:

* Es seguro. (It's safe.) / Está seguro. (He is sure.)
* Es guapo. (He's handsome.) / Está guapo hoy. (He looks handsome today.)
* Son listos. (They are smart.) / Están listos. (They are ready.)
* Es pesado. (He's annoying.) / Está pesado hoy. (He's being annoying today.)
* Es abierto. (He's an open-minded person.) / Está abierto. (It's open, referring to a door or store.)
* Es rico. (He's rich.) / Está rico. (The food tastes good.)

I know this might seem like a lot of rules, but don’t worry! The more you see ser and estar in context, the easier it will become. Instead of memorizing everything at once, focus on recognizing patterns in real conversations, books, or even TV shows. And don’t be afraid to make mistakes, keep practicing, and soon enough, using ser and estar will feel natural.

Write about the situations where you most often confuse ser and estar!

1it5s3i,https://i.redd.it/jp055tsyn3ke1.jpeg,"$Kendu keeps building and growing while the market bleeds because when Ethereum rises, Kendu explodes","When Ethereum rises, Kendu Inu stands to gain significantly. The reason is simple: liquidity moves where profits are expected. As Ethereum appreciates, investors seek higher returns within its ecosystem, often turning to assets with high speculative potential. Kendu Inu, having already demonstrated its ability to attract attention with a $300 million market cap at its peak, fits this profile.

The relationship between Ethereum’s price and meme coin valuations is well-documented. When Ethereum reaches new highs, speculative capital flows into tokens associated with its narrative. Kendu Inu has positioned itself as a pro-Ethereum asset, making it a natural beneficiary of renewed enthusiasm. Investors who profited from Ethereum’s rise often seek additional opportunities, and meme coins historically offer some of the highest returns in bull markets.

Accessibility plays a crucial role in price discovery. Kendu Inu’s expansion through Wormhole to Base and Solana increases its availability across multiple chains, lowering friction for new investors. A token that exists on Ethereum alone is limited by its network’s fees and congestion. By bridging to Base and Solana, Kendu Inu opens itself to users who prefer faster transactions and lower costs. The broader the access, the greater the potential for price appreciation.

Speculation, however, is not the only driver. Market sentiment responds to cultural adoption. Kendu Inu is integrating itself into the real economy through branding efforts in energy drinks, street art, jewelry, and coffee. The reason for this expansion is straightforward. A financial asset that becomes part of everyday culture gains recognition beyond crypto circles, increasing its demand and long-term viability. Unlike traditional speculative bubbles that rely solely on hype, assets with real-world presence sustain higher valuations by reinforcing their brand.

If Ethereum surpasses $5,000, Kendu Inu could reasonably return to its previous highs. Should Ethereum enter price discovery above $10,000, historical patterns suggest a strong possibility that Kendu Inu’s market cap could reach into the billions. The key variables are liquidity flow, accessibility, and market sentiment. When all three align, prices move rapidly. Kendu Inu’s positioning across multiple chains and industries places it in a favorable position to capitalize on Ethereum’s next bull run.

For these reasons, I recommend taking advantage of the market downtrend to increase holdings at a discount. Institutional investors and governments are increasing their positions in Ethereum and Ethereum-based memecoins while retail pulls back. Community projects like Kendu with dedicated core members, real world impacts, and relentless energy are the keys to real wealth without fearing rugpulls in crypto. These kinds of tokens build and hold value far longer than the ubiquitous solana pump.fun gambling. However, do your own research, as always.

1it5rtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/montreal/comments/1it5rtj/sunwing_wg689_varadero_to_montreal_nightmare/,Sunwing WG689 (Varadero to Montreal) NIGHTMARE,"
Long post, sorry

Were do I start? My wife and I flew with sunwing to varadero for a week. Snowstorm hit last week in montreal, therefore, delays were made - understandable. They moved us to another resort (Selectum Varadero) for 2 days while we, along with over atleast 50 others waited, not knowing when our flight jome would be. 

Supposed to leave Saturday, 15th, but by monday (17th) flights were delayed again and again. We were told to check out by 12pm, and promised by a sunwing representative that a “rescue flight” was on way to take us home. By 5pm, the representative fucked off and was already gone, while we all waited in the lobby with our suitcases having ZERO clue if the bus was coming to pick us up, if our flight was taking place, if the flight was canceled. ZERO, nada by sunwing.

Side note: Selectum Varadero did allow us to eat, drink, go to pool, beach etc throughout. They (resort) were just in the dark us we were. 

There were a lot of restless, angry, confused and worried people as you can imagine. Long story short, we were moved to another resort at 11pm. So, ZERO news from sunwing or anyone about what was happening with our flight back home to Montreal since early afternoon. 

As were were heading to the other resort (Barcelo solymar), we were all told by guide on bus that a bus would pick us up at 7:30 am the following morning and bringing us to the airport. We asked, “does that mean there’s a flight to montreal? or are we going to be stranded, in the dark again?” We were told “Not sure, but those are the orders for tomorrow.” GREAT …

Anyways, we get to the Varadero Airport tuesday morning, and low and behold there is indeed a flight scheduled to Montreal for 11am! HURRAY!!

Right? Right?

😂😂 Get this, as boarding begins for flight to Montreal, Pilot and sunwing crew at the gate suddenly tell us we are being flown to Toronto … are you fucking kidding me?!? I understand the issue with flights and snow etc in Montreal, but how come Sunwings WG 379 (which were boarding after us at Varadero) were flown to Montreal??? (I know this for certain as we had friends whom we met in varadero on this flight).

As sunwing announced this to us, you can imagine the passengers reaction - yelling, refusing, yelling some more etc. We were literally told it’s the only option or stay here in Varadero. How nice. They even PROMISED us that there would be a flight from Toronto to Montreal ready for us (Yeah, that became total fucking bullshit, holy fuck!).

When we arrived in toronto, Sunwing had ONE representative waiting for us at baggage claim (poor guy, my wife and I really felt sorry for hom. He was thrown to the wolves by sunwing’s higher ups who were cowards and refused to try to help us out). Sunwing was Very, VERY clueless about this - I promise you that. Anyways, i Won’t go through all the details about this part, but it took OVER TWO full hours waiting at the baggage claim area barrading the representative, asking questions about What the fuck is sunwing going to do about this situation, and when are we getting home. Over two hours, and they gave in to booking flights to montreal.

“We can give you a hotel” etc BULLSHIT. Even proposed a bus, 😂😂. We want to go HOME as we were PROMISED. We paid to be flown from varadero to montreal, and varadero to montreal. Fix it. Why the fuck did you force us to fly to Toronto for? Our boarding passes litterally says: VARADERO TO MONTREAL. 

So about those flights to Montreal Tuesday evening … My wife and I were allocated to board Porter airlines Wednesday at 7:35am. Took another 90 minutes for us to get a response from Sunwing (accomodating hotel and meal comp). Yeah, sunwing area at Toronto airport was a fucking, utter shitshow.

Not sure if those who were rescheduled to fly back to Montreal last night made it, or the flight was canceled.

BUT as for my wife and I’s flight home with Porter airlines? We checked in early, got coffee, get to the gate and within 30 minutes the flight was CANCELED. Got out of customs, back to PORTER area, and got booked another flight tonight. Reason being : short staff, no pilot … WHAT THE FUCK?!

Honestly, i’m betting this flight gets delayed/canceled as well. 

Anyways, we’re definitely going to file a complaint and look for compensation (if anyone can help/guide us the way, that would be great).

And there’s jobs too that are affected, as we and others have lots days, etc.

Feel free to ask me questions, or if anyone that’s been on this flight, feel free to share your side.

This is continuity of agenda, and I'm going to prove it to you right now...this is just Minsk 3. We remember Minsk 1 and 2"". [Full Transcript]","This is from Brian Berletic's latest video published to YouTube yesterday, Feb 18, 2025, giving his analysis of U.S. policy in Ukraine under the Trump administration, in light of the recent negotiations with Russia underway:

* [US is Reorganizing, Outstourcing Empire + Freezing, not Ending Ukraine War](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j9AwbTvJbz0)

I don't know which point he brings up that is most important, as there are several good points he makes, so I've just transcribed the whole thing (as best I can) and am pasting it here in its entirety. Enjoy!

*[Entire transcript below of Brian Berletic speaking, with quotations indicating articles he's reading from or a video clip played]*

As Russian forces continue to advance all along the line of contact in Ukraine, we are seeing the current U.S. administration attempt to continue, continue the proxy war. And I will explain why I'm saying that despite supposedly unprecedented breakthroughs, President Donald Trump calling Russian President Vladimir Putin, all of this discussion taking place, people taking sound bites that sound very promising, focusing on that, analyzing that. However, the actual substance of what is being said is identical to what was being said under the Biden administration. This is continuity of agenda, and I'm going to prove it to you right now.

And I want to begin with the comments of U.S., current U.S. Secretary of Defense, Pete Hegseth. This is the official U.S. Department of Defense Secretary Hegseth's Department of Defense, February 13, 2025. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth press conference following NATO ministers of defense meeting in Brussels, Belgium.

This is what he said. This is from this transcript. This is a transcript. And Secretary Hegseth says. And so let's talk about the only thing that is actually changing, but not really, is that the administration itself is admitting the U.S. has real physical limits to what it can do in Ukraine.

And if you listen carefully, you will understand that they have no actual problem in principle to continuing this war, this proxy war the U.S. started against Russia and is fighting against Russia through Ukraine. The problem is they physically cannot continue fighting this proxy war. They understand that they are going to lose.

If they do not freeze it, Ukraine's military will collapse. The Ukrainian military's fighting capacity will unravel and Russia will take all of Ukraine. So if the United States and its European proxies do not do something about that first before it happens, and if it happens quickly enough, then Russia will win completely across all of Ukraine. And they will not allow that to happen. They would not allow it to happen under the Biden administration.

And they are telling you now under the Trump administration they will not allow it to happen. So let's listen to Secretary Hegseth:

> ""One of the self-evident conclusions of the war in Ukraine was the underinvestment that both the European continent and America has had, unfortunately, in the defense industrial base. The ability to produce munitions, emerging technologies rapidly and field them was a blind spot exposed through the aggression against Ukraine.""
    
So hear him repeating the same language the Biden administration used to characterize this conflict in Ukraine. It wasn't because of NATO encroachment and its intention to encircle and contain Russia and eventually absorb Russia itself and Russia's reaction to that. This is all being blamed on Russia, Russian aggression. 

> ""Ukraine has responded to that as we've had a chance to listen to a great deal. Europe is responding to that, and so is America. We have to do more to ensure whether you call it an arsenal of democracy or defending the free world. If America can't build and export and build and provide rapid capabilities because we're too stale or static or bureaucratic or the Pentagon is bloated, then we're not able to field the systems we need in the future.""
    
It's a future to do what? To fight proxy wars exactly like this. 

> ""So deep and dramatic reforms are coming at the Defense Department with the leadership of President Trump to ensure that we're investing robustly in our defense industrial base.""
    
Now, the U.S. defense industrial base, the U.S. military, as a fighting organization, is more than capable to protect the continental United States and even America's legitimate interests abroad, such as a Navy capable of protecting U.S. maritime shipping. The U.S. could very easily do that with its existing military.

What they cannot do is fight a long, protracted, sustained, intense proxy war like what is taking place in Ukraine against a nation like Russia or a nation like China and actually win. That is what they cannot do. And so that is what they're trying to remedy. And he's telling you this right now in his own words. That is what he is saying.

> ""A great example is shipbuilding...""
    
So now this is specifically aimed at China because China is outpacing the United States and the U.S. shipbuilding industry. The think tanks that are funded by the arms industry, they admit that it's impossible for them to catch up to China. There's literally nothing they can do to balance the playing field.

They have fallen behind and they will continue to fall behind, but they will not accept that. They will continue trying to find some way to gain the advantage and to reassert dominance. That's what it has always been about. So he says:

> ""for a great example of shipbuilding, we need to vastly increase our ability to build ships and submarines, not just for ourselves, but to honor our obligations to our allies as well. And we will do that.""

Never explains how. Nobody has explained how that is possible. 

> ""Foreign military sales is another thing I mentioned this morning with the Secretary General. We have for a long time been the country by, with, and through that our allies were able to supply major platforms and weapon systems like the F-35 and the Patriots and others. Whatever the system is, we need to reform that process so it's quicker, so a request today isn't delivered seven years from now, but three years from now, with less red tape and with more efficient and effective technology possible.""

So no reflection on U.S. foreign policy, how flawed it is, how unsustainable it is, and no real reflection as to the real problems that are preventing the U.S. from matching Russia or China in terms of military industrial output. He's simply saying it needs to be remedied. They're not talking about remedying it.

And the only way it is actually remedied, and that is putting purpose over profit. They will never do that, so they will never succeed in this endeavor. And people will hear me say that and say, well, then what is the big deal? Why are we so worried about what the U.S. is doing?

Because the U.S. still has a tremendous capacity to destabilize and even destroy entire regions of the planet as it kicks and screams as its empire evaporates. 

So then he says:

> ""we hear from our allies, and that's part of being a good faith partner, is we're going to invest in our defense industrial base. We're going to make sure foreign military sales are as rapid as possible, which again is a force multiplier for American power, which is something we want to do in a contested world.""
    
The contested world, he's referring to the unipolar world order created by and for the United States versus multipolarism, a balance of power among nations and America's necessity to find a place within that rather than imposing itself upon it.

So he's talking about committing and reasserting the unipolar world order created by and for the United States. And he's talking about force multipliers for the United States. So he's talking about using Europe, using Japan, using South Korea to make up for the fact that it in and of itself, militarily, industrially, economically, it is incapable of matching Russia or China, let alone both. And I just want to refresh people's memories. This during the Biden administration:

> ""DOD releases first ever national defense industrial strategy, January 2024.""

And I did entire videos and articles about this. And what did they talk about inside that strategy document? They talked about using Europe, Japan, South Korea to make up for the shortcomings in their own industrial base. And so this was something rolled out by the Biden administration, the Department of Defense of Secretary Lloyd Austin. And now it is being continued without missing a beat by Secretary Hegseth.

> ""Let's continue with this solution. The solution now not necessarily to America's shortcomings in military industrial output, but the conflict in Ukraine specifically.""
    
And this comes from this other U.S. Department of Defense readout:

> ""Hegseth calls on NATO allies to lead Europe's security rules out support for Ukraine membership.""

So no NATO membership for Ukraine. At least that's what Secretary Hegseth and President Trump are saying now. But we have to remember the entire conflict taking place in Ukraine right now is because originally after the Cold War and Ukraine obtaining independence from the Soviet Union, the whole deal was that Ukraine would never join NATO. And when the conditions suited the United States to renege on that agreement, they did. And that is what has led us to this very conflict right now.

And the only reason they're talking about not allowing Ukraine into NATO, at least for now, is because they need to buy time because the conflict as it is right now is going to end in Russia's favor. They need to freeze the conflict. And that is exactly what Secretary Hegseth lays out. So let's listen to what he says here:

> ""The U.S. is committed to building a stronger, more lethal NATO. However, we must ensure that European and Canadian commitment to Article 3 of this treaty is just as strong. Article 3 says that allies, and I quote, by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid, will maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack. Leaders of our European allies should take primary responsibility for defense of the continent, which means security ownership by all allies guided by a clear understanding of strategic realities. And it's an imperative given the strategic realities that we face. And that begins with increasing defense spending. 2% is a start, as President Trump has said, but it's not enough. Nor is 3%, nor is 4%. More like 5%. Real investment, real urgency.""

Again, NATO's existence, the purpose of NATO, which is to contain and eventually absorb Russia, is at the root of the conflict in Ukraine. NATO continuously expanded eastward towards Russia's borders. It started absorbing nations all along Russia's borders, including Ukraine. And this is what Russia is reacting to. The Trump administration is not acknowledging this, just as the Biden administration refused to acknowledge this reality.

And instead of recognizing NATO as a threat and reconsidering the security architecture of all of Eurasia, which is all Russia has been asking for, they're going to ask each member state of NATO to more than double their financial commitment to the organization as part of expanding their individual and collective military industrial output. So please keep that in mind. They are talking about expanding NATO in terms of spending and expanding NATO and each member state's military industrial capacity, which is going to take time. Keep that in mind. 

> ""We can talk all we want about values. Values are important, but you can't shoot values. You can't shoot flags and you can't shoot strong speeches. There is no replacement for hard power. As much as we may not want to like the world we live in, in some cases there's nothing like hard power. It should be obvious that increasing allied European defense spending is critical, as the president of the United States has said. Also critical is expanding our defense industrial base capacity on both sides of the Atlantic.""
    
So there he said it again. 

> ""Our dollars, our euros, our pounds must become real capabilities. The U.S. is fully committed under President Trump's leadership to pursue these objectives in face of today's threats.""

What threats? What are the threats the U.S. actually faces? Is it Russia not wanting to be encroached upon by NATO, having nations along its border violently overthrown by U.S.-backed subversion and then absorbed into NATO with the NATO organization aimed at eventually absorbing Russia next? Is that the threat?

What about China? Is China a threat? Is it a threat because it refuses to allow the U.S. to undermine the sovereignty it has over Taiwan under international law, even under bilateral agreements with the U.S. itself?

Now, this was the U.S. State Department's U.S. Relations with Taiwan webpage as of 2022. And this is what it said up to 2024. And it talks about the one China policy, and it explicitly says ""we do not support Taiwan independence"".

Now, under the U.S. State Department of Marco Rubio, they have completely erased that sentence because that's what this is all about. This is about encroaching upon and absorbing Russia and China. And these nations are reacting to this, and then the U.S. presents these reactions as aggression from these nations.

It went on all during the Biden administration, the previous Trump administration, eight years of Obama, Bush Jr., so on and so forth. And it is now continuing very deliberately under the Trump administration. This removal of ""we do not recognize Taiwan independence"" is very deliberate, and it is meant to provoke China. 

So this is the threat U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is talking about, a threat of America's own creation because of its own aggression abroad, its own encroachment upon these nations, and these nations refusing to accept it.

And they have every right to resist being accroached upon, and their very sovereignty usurped out from under them. What about the actual conflict itself? So they obviously need time to raise funding for NATO, for that funding to actually manifest itself into the hard power Secretary Hegseth is so obsessed with, and the expansion of the military-industrial base. This is going to take years. So what is the solution for this conflict in Ukraine?

If Russia is winning right now on the battlefield, and the collapse of Ukraine's military can happen at any time, nobody knows when it will collapse, how long it can hold out. What are they going to do to buy time to expand military-industrial production so that they can continue waging this proxy war with the advantage in their favor? So this is what he says, again, under this statement here. Again, the links to all of this will be in the video description below. This is what he says.

> ""We are at a critical moment. As the war approaches its third anniversary, our message is clear. The bloodshed must stop and the war must end, Hegseth told the group.""
    
Fair enough. Everybody hears that, and they say that is a positive statement. They can agree with that. 

> ""As an alternative to granting Ukraine NATO membership, Hegseth said that any security guarantees for Ukraine must be backed by capable European and non-European troops. If these troops are deployed as peacekeepers to Ukraine at any point, they should be deployed as part of a non-NATO mission, and they should not be covered under Article 5 of the NATO Treaty, Hegseth said, adding that they must also be robust oversight of the line of contact from the international communities.""
    
So elsewhere, he's talking about an enduring peace. But here he's talking about the line of contact and Western troops occupying what's left of Ukraine and essentially freezing the conflict in Ukraine exactly as the U.S. froze the conflict in Syria. The proxy war in Syria was being lost. The U.S. occupied eastern Syria. Turkey occupied northern Syria, and they just held on, and they undermined Syria.

They overstretched Russia elsewhere until the opportunity presented itself for them to finally finish the conflict, overthrow the Syrian government, and now their proxies control all of Syria. This is what they are doing again in Ukraine. This is the plan that they are laying out for all to see, for anyone who wants to open their eyes and their ears to see and hear it. 

> ""To be clear, as part of any security guarantee, there will be no U.S. troops deployed to Ukraine, he said.""

And again, this is not because the U.S. doesn't want to be involved. They cannot be involved. If they get dragged into intervention in Ukraine, they will be unable to address China in the Indo-Pacific region. This conflict that the State Department is already teeing up by changing their own official stance on Taiwan, betraying the one-China policy they agreed with Beijing over.

They cannot have their troops tied up in Ukraine. They need their troops and their equipment, their Patriot missiles, their long-range missiles. They need all of that for the Indo-Pacific. They cannot afford to have it tied up in Ukraine, protecting U.S. troops stationed there.

So they're going to use their European proxies. This was always a proxy war, not just through Ukraine, but through all of Europe. Europe has been made to pay the price for this conflict all along. The very fact, the very first thing the U.S. wanted to do, even before the conflict began, before the special military operation began, under the Trump and then Biden administration, they were pressuring Germany to cut the Nord Stream pipeline off from Russia, to stop importing hydrocarbons from Russia, to isolate and pressure Russia.

And then when the conflict began, the pressure became overwhelming. They literally blew up the pipeline. And even now, under the Trump administration, they're talking about sanctions. They're talking about:

*[plays clip of Hegseth speaking]*

> ""To further enable effective diplomacy and drive down energy prices that fund the Russian war machine, President Trump is unleashing American energy production and encouraging other nations to do the same. Lower energy prices, coupled with more effective enforcement of energy sanctions, will help bring Russia to the table.""
    
Ever since this conflict began, I had warned about the collective West never allowing Ukraine to fully fall to Russia, the fact that they would intervene directly and create a buffer zone, just as they did in Syria. And this was what was being prepared all throughout the Biden administration. And now this is what Secretary Hegseth and President Trump, quite frankly, are talking about and preparing to do now. 

It is, again, continuity of agenda. Absolutely nothing has changed. The rhetoric, maybe slightly, some of the theatrics, you know, calling President Putin on the phone. But the very core aspects of U.S. policy toward Ukraine, toward Russia, toward China, for that matter, have not changed. It is continuing uninterrupted through this now Trump administration.

This, in regards to Ukraine specifically, is just Minsk 3. We remember Minsk 1 and 2, European leaders admitted that this was just a way of buying time. Because at that time, Ukraine's military was weak and it was facing collapse. And so they wanted to buy time. They feigned interest in freezing the conflict, arriving at some sort of peace.

But all they did was just buy time so they could rearm Ukraine and start the conflict anew. And that is exactly what they did. And that is what they are doing now. And you have been warned. And if you listen to Secretary Hegseth, President Trump, Secretary Rubio, if you listen to them carefully, that is exactly what they are telling you they're going to do.

One last very interesting thing Secretary Hegseth said was this bit about the division of labor. A lot of people interpret the U.S. dumping the Ukraine conflict onto Europe because it's not interested in it anymore. And I'm telling you that's not the reason why they're doing it. They physically cannot invest anymore in Ukraine and also invest in their containment strategy toward China.

They're trying to provoke and then they hope to win a war against China. They cannot do that if they're still tied up with Ukraine. So he says something very interesting about the division of labor. Let's listen:

[plays clip of Hegseth speaking]

> ""The U.S. is prioritizing deterring war with China in the Pacific, recognizing the reality of scarcity and making the resourcing tradeoffs to ensure deterrence does not fail. Deterrence cannot fail for all of our sakes. As the United States prioritizes its attention to these threats, European allies must lead from the front. Together, we can establish a division of labor that maximizes our comparative advantages in Europe and Pacific, respectively. In my first weeks as Secretary of Defense, under President Trump's leadership, we've seen promising signs that Europe sees this threat, understands what needs to be done, and is stepping up to the task.
> 
> ""For example, Sweden recently announced its largest ever assistance package. We applaud them for committing $1.2 billion in ammunition and other needed material. Poland is spending 5% of GDP on defense already, which is a model for the continent. And 14 other countries are co-leading capability coalitions. These groups are doing great work to coordinate Europe's contributions of legal assistance across eight key capability areas.
> 
> ""These are first steps. More must still be done. We ask each of your countries to step up on fulfilling the commitments that you have made. And we challenge your countries and your citizens to double down and recommit yourselves not only to Ukraine's immediate security needs, but to Europe's long-term defense and deterrence goals.""
    
If you listen to Secretary Hegssev speak, it's very obvious he has no interest in ending the conflict in Ukraine. He is imploring Europe to expand their efforts to keep the war going. The United States is not withdrawing from the conflict because it's no longer interested. It's just simply no longer capable of investing as much in Ukraine with the conflict that is now starting to expand and escalate in Asia Pacific with China. 

He talks about the need to deter war with China. What is he actually talking about? He's talking about America's decades of encroaching upon violating the sovereignty of antagonizing and provoking China. And what they are worried about is China reaching a military and economic level where it is able to push back. And that is what they're trying to deter. They're trying to deter China from asserting itself against American antagonism. 

The U.S. has never even talked about a real threat China poses to the actual United States. They're talking about the threat China poses to their own forces antagonizing China closer to Chinese shores than to American shores. 

So what is Secretary Hegseth? What is the Trump administration actually saying in regards to Ukraine and its overall approach to foreign policy and its defense policy? It is not dismantling American interference overseas. It is not dismantling the pursuit of American hegemony worldwide. It is simply reorganizing it, even outsourcing it. That is basically what he's saying in regards to Europe. Europe will take care of America's interests vis-a-vis Russia. We need to commit all of our resources to China.

There's simply not enough to go around. If there was, we would remain committed in Europe as well.

A prominent person mentioned is poisoned shortly after they were shown high regards by Maria Theresa and Franz I. The passage describes it as such:

_As soon as he drank the coffee, he felt a sharp pain in his stomach. Unable to remain with the group, he returned to his quarters and immediately began vomiting. He felt pain in his heart, could not find comfort, and said: ""I set out on this journey at an ill-fated hour and drank that coffee at an even worse one."" He wanted to return home but was unable to do so. He could no longer stand on his feet, and from the great torment, he became completely exhausted. Although a doctor was present, no help could be given. The doctor ordered that his family be sent for immediately, and they gathered there the following day. They found him in great agony, barely able to speak, and, as I have already mentioned, he passed away in that torment.

I am pretty busy throughout the day but always have some downtime. Our company recently got rid of the 2 maintenance guys that worked here. I have been tasked with doing some of the things they did because nobody else here will do them. I am tasked with filling up the coffee bars and cups in 4 areas in my building. I am also tasked with making sure soap is always in the bathrooms. At first my boss was doing it and now she eventually is trying to give it to me to do. Can I refuse to do this? If I would have been told 18 years ago I would be doing barista type work I would have never taken this job. I like my boss a lot and recently got a raise so I don't want to be an ass and make anything awkward. Has this happened to anyone else? How did you handle it? ,1,1739971705.0,BadBosses,0,1.0,False

The therapist is was seeing was 20 years old when I went to her office and when I met her she immediately made me feel comfortable, She would smile and I'd smile for the first time in months she never sent me home with medication because I would just go to her office. Eventually I asked her for her number and she declined the first time saying it's weird dating patients. I had to stop going for a bit due to a medical issue and when I went back she said that she was going through stuff and needed time away from her job so a coupled days later I saw her at the supermarket and walked up to her.

I said hello and she said hi and we hugged. She asked how I was doing and I had a thing for her especially when she made me smile when I was so deep in depression. After we talked i slipped a note in her hand with my number on it and walked away. Couple days go bye no answer and I started a job at a pharmacy. One night I got a call and it was from her she said she quit her job and she wanted to hang out and I said ""yea of course after my shift""! So my shift ends and we grab coffee and some dinner at a restaurant i use to go to with my mom. We talked for hours until the restaurant closed and they kicked us out. I walked her home and we said goodnight. A few more days going bye and we havnt talked and she called me while I was doing laundry and in a panic voice she said ""come over now please"" I said okay and desperately put my coat and shoes on and ran to my car and mind you it was winter out so of course I slipped and fell on my ass haha. I made it to her house and walked in i yelled her name and knocked on her bedroom door ""Hello"" i said and she responded ""come in"" i went in and she had two pillows on the ground with popcorn and soda infront of a tv she said ""SURPRISE!!"" I sat down and said what tf she wanted another date and she put her hand on my shoulder and said; ""we can't get kicked out of here"" after that I stayed the night and in the morning I made her breakfast and we sat down and I finally asked if she wanted to be my girlfriend and surprisingly she said yes I would love to and it was the day a big snow storm was coming in so we went outside made snow mens and threw snowballs at each other and dancing in the snow life was great!

Now I'm 25 and she's 26 were married and have 2 daughters.

1it5fyz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Incontinence/comments/1it5fyz/exercise_for_stopping_urine_production/,Exercise for stopping urine production,"I am a 32M that has had urge incontinence for 2 years now it’s gotten worse after doing kegel exercises and my bladder capacity is totally shot.

I just wanted to share something with the community in hopes that it might help just one person living with this difficult condition of ours.

That is exercising and by that I specifically mean running on a treadmill.

For the last few months I’ve been managing my incontinence by running on a treadmill.

I should pre phrase and say that I currently do not work which makes this treatment easier for me but I do plan on working soon remotely where I will be able to continue doing this.

My routine is every morning at 8 am I have 2 cups of coffee and a glass of water about 850 ml in fluids in total.

I remain at home and until 12:30 pm I go to the bathroom several times naturally. Then at 12:30 I get on my treadmill at home and jog/run for 40 minutes at 8 km/h at a 4 incline (not sure what that exactly is but I think it’s degrees). Then I’ll have a shower and drink another glass of 350 ml water.

The benefit of this is that I can leave the house at around 1:30 pm and do things outside for several hours without urinating once. The weather now is colder and this treatment works better the more you sweat but even at these negative celsiysws I can be out until 6 pm before needing to urinate. Sometimes when I sweat more I can do this until 9pm around the time I get ready to sleep without going to the bathroom once!

I should say that during this time outside I drink zero fluids. I don’t even eat fruits because of there high water content.

But doing this I can at least get away with doing outside activities without peeling my pants.

The reason I wait until 12:30 is so that I can drain as much fluids as I can before exercising and “stopping” my urine production around when I’m empty so that I have more time outside without urinating

I hope this may help one person get some relief",0,1739971631.0,Incontinence,2,0.5,False

1it5e5r,https://www.reddit.com/r/SeveranceAppleTVPlus/comments/1it5e5r/returning_to_the_recanonicalized_kier_cycle/,"Returning to the ""Re-Canonicalized"" Kier Cycle...","I began writing this as a response to a thread asking why fans disappointed by Season 1 aren't responding similarly to Season 2. Ultimately, I realized I needed more space to articulate my disappointment with a specific moment that I feel exemplifies some of Season 2's pitfalls. While I want to be clear that I am loving the show—and it's only because of the richness of the material that I find myself debating the effectiveness of certain moments—I am a bit leery of some of the choices made this season. It feels like there is a shift in how information is conveyed—what was once subtle subtext in Season 1 is now often presented through overt dialogue. For instance, in last week's episode, Ms. Huang's line, ""You shouldn't let them have a funeral. It makes them feel like people,"" feels a little on the nose. The idea of the Innies being treated as subhuman was a constant undercurrent in Season 1, but it was only explicitly articulated once—in Helena's chilling video response to Helly. Even then, it took the extreme threat of mutilation to earn a line with that level of malice.

Season 2, however, not only includes a high clip of 'on the nose' moments, it occassionally  undermines the ambiguity and dramatic stakes of earlier scenes. Again, in the most recent episode, the scene where Milcheck presses Natalie about the black-face Kier paintings adds unnecessary context to what was one of the most compellingly ambiguous moments of the show. Tramell Tillman, who is fast becoming the show's breakout star, delivers an incredible performance in that scene—so much is conveyed through a single glance. Similarly, Sydney Cole Alexander shines in her role. Milchick is a consummate ""Yes Man,"" and his promotion over Cobell stems from his greater willingness to execute Lumon's increasingly absurd commands. Even she seems startled by the visceral shock he displays when confronted with the paintings—a reaction that mirrors the audience's own.

That silent exchange speaks volumes. On one level, there's the obvious racial subtext—like many real-world corporations, Lumon's performative gestures of inclusivity mask a history of systemic exclusion. But there's also a deeper narrative layer. Throughout the episode, Milcheck manipulates the Severed employees with calculated precision. His reassurance to Mark that his Innie has ""found love"" carries no more weight than his promise to get Dylan a coffee cozy—both are tools of control. Tillman's restrained performance hints at a subtle satisfaction in these power plays: pitting the Innies against each other, offering perks to pacify dissent, and encouraging Mark's pursuit of Helly, knowing her threat to the company has already been neutralized.

Yet, just as Milchick begins to reap the benefits of his manipulation, the revised Kier cycle undercuts his authority. That corporate gift—HIS coffee cozy—is laden with meaning. It's the ""overseer syndrome"" in action: Milchick's self-worth is tied to the belief that he stands a rung above the Innies, just shy of Lumon Management. But this trivial token suggests how easily he too can be controlled, exposing the limits of his autonomy.

Perhaps I'm overanalyzing, but the beauty of ambiguous writing lies in its openness to interpretation. By including a scene two episodes later that essentially spells out the meaning behind Milchick's reaction, the show diminishes the mystery of that earlier moment. While it doesn't negate the deeper readings, it does weaken the show's mystique.",3,1739971483.0,SeveranceAppleTVPlus,3,0.8,False

My son, 8, has been in love with Pokémon for about 2 years now. We've played the card game for about the same time. It's helped his reading comprehension and math skills immensely. So much so, that last year we (husband and I) decided to host a Pokémon game night for his school and teach them how to play the game! It was a huge success and we are doing it again at his new school next month. 

But last night, showed me just how kind, open, welcoming, friendly and accepting this community is. It was mainly adults in their 20s and 30s that were there. My son was the only kid. But they didn't treat him like a kid. They treated him like one of their own. He walked away with some awesome cards (rayquaza v, 2 Lucario v max, greninja v and some other ones), a Flareon stuffed animal (he went up to this guy carrying it. Told him ""that's really cute!"" To which the guy responded ""do you want it?"" And gave it to him without hesitation.) He got a belibolt figurine, a new play mat, a card tin, a new card binder. So many things just because they wanted to give them to him. 

My son ended up walking around and giving away his random extra cards he brought with him. He sat and played a game against the guy who planned the whole event. He looked through people's binders and told them how cool their cards were. He cheered people on that were opening packs and got awesome pulls. 

It was just...wonderful to see and to be a part of it. He's so excited to go again and see his new friends. ",1,1739971163.0,PokemonTCG,1,1.0,False

1it57zn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1it57zn,Hyatt Centric Juhu Mumbai Review,"Although this has already been almost 3 weeks ago I should just say a few words about the property. Book on points, if I remember correctly it was 17,500 points for 2 nights. But considering the nightly rate in cash for those 2 nights, this was an amazing deal in terms of value per point. No upgrades due to the hotel being fully booked as it was around their National holiday.

Overall I have to say we were very satisfied with this property! I wouldn’t really call it a Centric because it wasn’t in the middle of anything other than a busy road. But Mumbai is a very big and busy city, so they’re excused!

The hotel is holding itself okay, the room was clean and tidy, we were expecting to find a lot of dings and scratches but it was overall to a very good standard.

All the staff spoke good English and were very friendly. Upon check in I was recognised as an Explorist and was given free breakfast for the two nights. That was an amazing bonus because the breakfast was great! And it meant we don’t have to worry about looking for other food. I have to recommend their cold coffee, very different than those we’re used to in the west but also enjoyable!

There was a nice bar area with a swimming pool on the rooftop of the hotel, although we didn’t get to use it as it wasn’t hot enough. But would definitely be nice in the more warm months. I have to say it appeared a bit untidy up there. There are a number of western chains of small restaurants nearby - Subway, Sbarro and if I remember correctly Domino’s and Baskin Robins. There’s also a nice beach not far from the hotel if you fancy an Indian beach experience!

We didn’t have early check in or late check out, but we were offered late checkout if we needed it.

Overall we were generally very happy with the place and if I ever come back to Mumbai I would definitely stay again. Not sure if I had to pay the cash price though … but the place was like a little oasis in the middle of this massive and chaotic city. ",3,1739970967.0,hyatt,1,0.8,False

I’m not sure if I’ll ever actually meet you, or if you’ll even stumble upon this letter. But I’m writing it anyway, because sometimes I feel like putting out into the universe that someone—somewhere—might be reading these words and, just maybe, it’ll be you.

So, here's the thing. We’re strangers right now. You might be anywhere, doing anything. Maybe you're drinking your morning coffee or scrolling through Reddit. And maybe, just maybe, this little message will catch your eye. If it does, I can only hope you’ll understand how much it means to me that you’re reading it.

Right now, I’m 21 years old. Living in Maryland, trying to figure out what comes next. I’m working a job that I know isn't the endgame — I’ll be honest, I’m just passing through it while I chase after something more meaningful. I want to be an author (or at least try, even if it doesn’t pan out), and I’ve got a whole bunch of ideas in my head that are waiting to be written down. I’m a mix of ambition, uncertainty, and trying to figure out where I belong.

But none of that really matters right now. What matters is that one day, when I’m older, I’ll look back and know that you were out there. Somewhere. And maybe when we meet, I’ll be in a cute little house somewhere with pumpkins outside in the fall, and I’ll be getting to know all those little details about you: what makes you laugh, how you like your coffee, and what you dream about at night.

Maybe right now you’re sitting in a café, reading this as you sip your drink. Or maybe you're scrolling through Reddit during a break at work. Whatever you’re doing, I hope you're out there living your life in the way that feels most true to you. And when our paths cross — whether through some strange twist of fate or just the timing of it all — I hope we’ll have a million little things to laugh about together.

Who knows? Maybe we'll meet in a few months or years. Or maybe you’ll come across this one day and think it’s a little funny that I wrote it, or maybe you’ll even send me a message. Whatever happens, I think I’m okay with that.

So, here’s my offer: if you’re out there and you think we might be kindred spirits, let’s see where this goes. Life’s too short to leave things unsaid.

Oh, and just so you know, I plan to be the kind of person who dyes her hair a crazy color when she gets older. Fair warning.",2,1739970854.0,r4r,1,0.75,False

1it4zao,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeachInThailand/comments/1it4zao/a_typical_day_as_a_teacher_in_thailand/,A Typical Day As  A Teacher In Thailand,"Times and situations will vary from school to school, this is mostly Government and (some) Private schools. International schools will feel more like the kind back home. 

≈7:30 - 8:00 - Gate Duty 

~1-2 days a week you will stand at the gate of the school welcoming students 


≈8:00 - Opening Ceremony/Assembly

~Thai National Anthem - Stand quietly with your hands to the side

~Buddhist Prayer - Stand quietly or if you feel comfortable you can pray too

~Something else - 

When I taught Primary they did a quiet meditation to calm down the students (it didn’t work 😆)

Now I teach at a secondary school and they play the school’s song

~Some schools will have you do a “Word of the Week” in front of the whole school


≈8:30 - ≈11:30/12:00 - Teaching and Lesson Planning

~Normally it’s 18-22 teaching hours (more than that is stretching it). In your interview ask now many hours and how many different classes you will have 

~Class sizes are BIG can be as small as 20-30 students but I’ve heard some are as big as 60. My classes now average about 40+/- students

~The office is open, usually no walls. Some schools have a foreigner office, others you sit with the Thai teachers

~Every school has a library you can go to if you need some quiet time

~Get/bring a coffee

NOTE ON COFFEE

~Some, but not all, offices have a coffee maker

~Most Thais drink instant coffee and there are a variety of options from Nescafé, 3 in 1s, and instant Americanos (check for sugar, Americanos, instant and at the cafes usually have sugar. You can ask them not to add it)

~Or bring your own, that’s what I do. You can go to a coffee shop by your school but that can add up. Or what I did was I bought a cheap espresso maker online (about $35-40 USD) and I’ve had it for 2 years; it’s paid for itself many times over


≈11:30 - 12:30 - Lunch time!

~Most schools provide a lunch

~Most offices have a microwave and fridge

~If you either don’t like Thai food, your stomach isn’t use to it yet, you have certain food allergies, or dietary restrictions (vegan/vegetarian/pork/etc.), you can bring your own lunch. It’s a good idea to have instant noodles in your desk just to be safe 

~Some schools don’t provide you a free lunch or ask to pay a little for bigger portions or custom lunches

~Some (but not many) schools have cafeterias where you can buy your own food


≈12:30 - 3:30/4:30 - More classes/Lesson planning/relax

~You’ll notice some some Thai teachers will take naps in the afternoon, they work way harder than you and usually have more classes than you (and get paid way less)

~Sometimes students will come visit you. The younger students might want to play games. The older ones might want to talk and practice their English

~Students may stay really late after school either to socialize or waiting for their parents to pick them up

~It’s good to stay a couple minutes after the last classes in case any students want to meet with you


NOTES -

~Sometimes the Thai Teachers might invite you out after school, even if you’re tired I’d say go! You’ll feel reenergized once you’re out of school and you’ll have a blast hanging out with your coworkers

~Try to do all of your work at school so you can enjoy your time off

~You may get texts from school at night and on weekends, try not to let it stress you out

While my previous grinder used to take 5 minutes to grind for espresso about 14 grams, this one does it in almost 30 seconds. My current setup is the Kingrinder K2 paired with the Delonghi Dedica. Also, I am using a pressurized basket which came with the machine itself. Just recently I dialed in the perfect shot using this grinder, and that felt like absolute satisfaction.

A few questions which i have:

* I am thinking of upgrading to a bottomless portafilter, but I am not sure if the K2 would be able to handle that. I mean, will it produce inconsistencies? Currently, I am using 51 clicks for my 14 grams basket and 49 clicks for my 9 gram basket. To be honest, only after purchasing the K2, I have actually got to taste a really good espresso from my machine than previously when I just got it, the coffee grinded from a local shop. Also, will getting a naked Portafilter improve the quality of the shot? I am currently extremely satisfied with the espresso I am getting from my pressurized Portafilter. So I am in two minds.
* Another thing I was unsure about is that whether it will be able to handle different roast levels like light roast, medium roast, and dark roast. Currently, I am using a medium-dark roast.
* How many operational clicks does this grinder have(Just curios)? Cause after I zeroed it out and kept on turning the dial to see how many clicks it had, it just wouldn't stop even after 200 clicks. after that point it started to feel a little loose so I abandoned the effort out of fear. I know that the higher ranges of clicks are practically useless but still I wanted to know how far it'll go.
* until how many clicks is it safe to rotate the lever. The manual says in 0-15 clicks it is avoidable to rotate the handle as it would cause the burr to get damaged. ( again, out of curiosity)
* How often should i clean the grinder? After every use there are grounds stuck to the dial and around it, and also to the walls of the container. For now, after every use i am brushing those grounds away with the given brush. Is this frequency of cleaning necessary or is it ok if i clean it in say once in 2-3 days
* If possible it would also be helpful if you can mention the clicks you use for different brewing methods

I know this list is quite long so any help would be highly respected and appreciated. Thanks in advance!!

1it4l50,https://www.reddit.com/r/managers/comments/1it4l50/im_dealing_with_the_worst_employee_right_now_and/,"I’m dealing with the worst employee right now, and I can’t fire them","I have been the facility manager at a local sports facility for almost a month now. The old manager was fired for negligence (failed to do basic maintenance, etc.) I was promoted. In total, I’ve been here for about two and a half years now. I’ve found the transition surprisingly easy, I know the place and the equipment well, my biggest headache right now is one of my employees. 

We hired an employee last summer who is just terrible, and has been for months now, the old manager should’ve fired them long ago, but I can’t get rid of them now. We’re severely understaffed, with just about two months left until the facility closes for summer maintenance, it isn’t enough time to get some new hires and train them, as training can take upwards of a month or more. 

This employee is consistently late for work. It used to be worse, a near daily issue, now they’re anywhere from 10-30 minutes late for a shift every week or so. Yesterday, they were a half hour late because they booked a doctors appointment that overlapped with their shift, and didn’t tell me until 30 minutes before they were supposed to come in. Because of this, I had to stay 10 minutes late, they showed up with lunch that they picked up on the way to work, despite being 40 minutes late. When I told them that I need to know about scheduling/availability issues in advance, they told me off, and claimed that it “shouldn’t be an issue” because of the shift overlap, and told me that it was either they go to the appointment and show up late, or they aren’t coming to work at all. 

Speaking of that, this employee has faked illnesses multiple times. They have two jobs, I know a handful of people that work with this employee at their other job, and found out that they’ve been faking illnesses. Back in late 2024, we were told by this employee that he had pneumonia and couldn’t work here, yet they were working at their other job during this same time period with no issues or mention of illness. In the past handful of months, they’ve apparently had pneumonia twice, a lung infection, and several common colds. During these periods, they will complain relentlessly about said illness, complain that they have to work when they’re supposedly sick, and use it as an excuse to show up late, or do nothing while they’re here. 

Every shift has a 30 minute overlap. For example, if I get off at 5, the evening shift employee is scheduled to come in for 4:30. This is in place to ensure that there is always someone at the facility, it gives employees time to get in just in case of traffic, etc. It also allows me time to discuss whats been done already today and what needs to be done in the evening, go over bookings for that day, note things that employees need to look out for, etc. This employee seems to think these overlaps are in place so they can show up whenever they please within that half hour period. They often come in 10 minutes late, coffee or lunch in hand. 

This employee simply does not do what’s asked of them here. They always find an excuse to avoid doing their assigned tasks around the facility. They always say they were too busy, or didn’t have enough time, despite this job having a lot of down time when tasks can be easily completed. The tasks are often left for other employees to deal with, which is frustrating for everyone. 

They’ve caused damage to the facility and its property through negligence several times. In the past week alone, they dumped a shop vac full of pebbles, salt and water into a sink, and broke the deadbolt on our closet while trying to get in. I often have to come in on days off to fix these things, or take time during my shifts (which are busy enough) to do so. When they do break something, they rarely tell anyone, and just leave it for someone else to find. If I text our work groupchat asking who’s broken something, they never respond. 

They’ve harassed our accountant several times to pay them in cash so they could avoid taxes. They’ve gotten upset with the accountant when told that this is illegal. They’ve also been caught adding extra hours to their pay. I scheduled them for 76 hours last period, they told our accountant that they worked 83. Because of this, I now have to approve their hours and pay before they get their cheque. 

They don’t respond well to criticism whatsoever. Any time I try to discuss an issue with them, they become extremely defensive and try to start an argument with me. For example, I told them that they can’t use our dry carpet vacuum to vacuum the wet rugs in the porch, as this damages the vacuum. Their response was “well I was just doing what I thought I was supposed to, fine, I just won’t vacuum the porch for the rest of the winter.” 

On several occasions they’ve lied to my face about things the business owner apparently said to them. For example, they once told me that the business owner told them they’ve been working so hard and deserve a full weekend off (despite being a part-time employee who was specifically hired to work evenings and weekends.) When I spoke to the owner about this, I found out that this employee was never told that. They also told us that the old manager promoted them, which also wasn’t true. 

They consistently fight me on shifts/hours. We have a total of 5 employees, including myself, I am the only full-time employee who’s guaranteed 40 hours per week. Despite being part-time, this employee will throw an absolute tantrum if I can’t give them close to 40 hours per week, despite there being no obligation to do so. They expect me to juggle the schedule and take hours from other (more deserving) employees. They’ve told me several times that they have a new car to pay for, just moved into a new place, and can’t afford to lose any hours. Despite this, in the past two weeks, they’ve booked 3.5 days off (all in a 9 day period, no less) shown up to work late twice, and outright refused to come in for a shift because it snowed the night before and they didn’t want to shovel their driveway. 

They refuse to fill out required paperwork. I have daily checklists and task sheets to keep employees on track. They don’t fill out the checklist whatsoever, and put the same handful of tasks on their daily task sheet every single day, regardless if they actually completed said tasks or not. 

Overall, this employee is simply lazy, entitled, arrogant, and hard to work with. We’ve already made the decision that they will be fired as soon as the season is over, but what can I do to make this as painless as possible until then? I have to deal with them for another ~2 months, I can’t fire them or hire anyone else. I’ve already spoken to them numerous times about what’s expected of them and what needs to change, I plan on severely reducing their hours, despite the backlash that will cause. 

I do everything I can to make this facility easy to work at, every morning I take on a laundry list of tasks to ensure that those working the evening and weekend shifts have it as easy as possible, yet this employee just can’t seem to care. It’s a slap in the face when I work my ass off every morning, just to come in the next day and find that they did absolutely nothing. I’ve gone above and beyond for this employee, I’ve accommodated every time off request they’ve made, gotten their shifts covered when they decide they don’t want to come in, and given them the hours and shifts they’ve requested.

Giving him all the support, but he's been so erratic and just a plain c\*nt since. That's to be expected after 25 years of smoking, but going cold turkey from it & coffee hasn't been smart.

I made him promise not to start replacing it with drinking loads on the weekend. (He's old enough to make his own decisions) But I know all the bar staff in town and when he originally returned home due to depression, I let them all know to text me when he's in a pub on his own. Since January my phone has been lighting up twice a week with calls from said barmen. I go down, bring him home and he still hasn't copped on. So obvious, but maybe he doesn't want to address it.

He's taken up 7 new hobbies 'seriously' since quitting as well, has spent a clean fortune on each one, and got bored of it 3 days later. I know he hasn't the money to be doing this.

This will be long so I will do my very very best to try and make this easy to read.

I met my wonderful boyfriend almost 3 years ago. He is an amazing man. I won’t disclose our age, but we’re both in our 20’s. 

We met on a dating app and got along really quickly. 
This is important, at some point a little before I met his mom and step father, we were driving to our date spot, when his mother calls him. When he picked up the phone he talked in such a monotone voice, no emotion if anything he sounded annoyed. 
I asked him why he was talking to her like that, he flat out said “I hate my mom” of course me being me, and scared that I had gotten myself in another bad relationship I ask, why? 
he explained during his childhood she was a neglectful mother, that his stepfather was extremely abusive during his childhood and she didn’t do anything about it. He was an alcoholic and didn’t get clean until years later.

Please remember what you’ve read.

When I first met my boyfriends mom and dad I was already on edge due to the fact that I knew they were trump supporters, I HATE trump and his supporters, not only that I’m Mexican, I was born there and brought here at 2.
They presented themselves in a funny welcoming way. My boyfriend seemed annoyed and I understood why. I tried to keep the introduction short because again, I already don’t like them because 1. The things my boyfriend had told me 2. I knew how they were to him 3. Well they support trump
One day my boyfriend’s mom is complaining that her back hurts and she can’t do the dishes, I offered because well, I felt bad. My mom had frequent back problems so I understood. I enjoyed doing dishes too, the water running through my hands was soothing. So I didn’t mind. My boyfriend tried to stop me, he repeatedly said “you don’t have to do that” I should have known he was trying to keep me from falling in a loop.
I struggle with boundaries, I went through a lot of trauma my whole childhood, I never set boundaries with them, yes that is my fault.

Eventually, every time I came over I did the dishes. It was like no one did them until I came. The sink was always full and gross, filled with food and cups filled with coffee that went bad. 

Like I said, I struggled with boundaries.
I couldn’t say no, I felt like I had to. Again, I love my boyfriend very much, so I just thought “I’m doing this for him!!” 

Eventually my family decided they wanted to move away, I didn’t want to leave I wanted to stay. My boyfriend said I could move in with him and I was ecstatic. 

When he told his parents they were ok with it, or so I thought atleast.
They told me as long as I keep working and QUOTE “you just need to clean up after yourself and your cats and just do your part” 

Within a week I realized what my poor boyfriend had been dealing with for years.
They constantly argue, they would talk bad about eachother to me constantly, “I want to divorce him” “I need to divorce him” “I can’t keep doing this”
“She’s such a bitch” “what a fucking cunt” 

There could never normal conversation between us.
It always seemed to lead to them trash talking the other.
It made me severely uncomfortable knowing all of this information.

Within a few months I was absolutely done. I was burnt out, I already struggled with insomnia, and by this point I was getting maybe at most 3 hours of sleep, I couldn’t sleep unless they were out of the house. 
His mom didn’t do anything around the house, and his stepdad only ever did their laundry and the towels. That’s all.
Suddenly I’m in charge of feeding THEIR animals, cleaning up after them AND their animals. And every time I did the dishes, they would somehow fill it RIGHT back up. It was a straight up “fuck you”. That’s what it felt like. 
Suddenly I’m my boyfriends moms personal back massager and personal makeup artist. I literally felt trapped. I just couldn’t fucking say “no”.

Then came the first incident, yes I was in the wrong, however it was simply a misunderstanding.
I smoke weed, and would frequently smoke with his step dad in his garage. He once told me to feel free to come and smoke whenever. He talked about how my boyfriend and his friends used to come in and smoke all the time with him. 
So a few weeks go by and I’m smoking his weed in the garage because I had ran out of mine. I’m watching TikTok’s and he BURSTS I mean BURSTS through the door. He begins yelling and asking what I’m doing, I look at him confused and say “smoking?” He then says I’m not supposed to be taking his weed without permission and that I’m not allowed in the garage anymore slammed the door so hard that the house shook.
So obviously I sat there confused. I cried because I didn’t exactly understand why he was so angry. 
Anyways I tried to explain it was a misunderstanding but he didn’t care at all.
I apologized he didn’t accept it. 

This is basically what started it all. 
After that things only got worse, their arguing became more violent than it already was, they’ve never hit eachother, but I’ve heard them yelling like they are about to be murdered.


The second incident was with his mom. She had asked me to do her makeup, I said no for the very first time. 
She slammed the door and then went to her room, where she also slammed her door.
I texted my boyfriend crying. Sobbing.

My boyfriend always did his best to defend me and be there for me, but again he and I are on the same damn boat. I’m incredibly grateful for him, god knows how many couples have been in this situation and were divided.
He comforted me and said he was sorry she did that. 

Of course things only got worse from there, I’ve never ever in my life seen such fake people.
Around their family and friends they act like they have it all together. Like they are perfect. 

From then on she began taking off what I call “her mask” she started making snarky remarks and saying mean things disguised as nice.
I never told my boyfriend because I knew he would give her a hard time. The house was already stressful enough as it is. I didn’t need to add more to it. I thought I could deal with it silently, but it only took a toll on me.
I was tired from months of not sleeping well, I stopped eating, I could barely get out of bed even to pee.
My boyfriend was an angel through all of this, and helped me.

One particular day I was really going through it.
I’m diagnosed with major clinical depression, anxiety, ptsd so I’ve got quite a lot on my plate. It was one of those “I’m not sure if I’ll make it out of it this time” days.
My boyfriend was doing my chores when his mother calls him on the phone, she asks 
“Are the dishes done”
He says 
“Yes I am doing them now”
She says
“Why isn’t SHE doing them why are YOU the one doing them”
I lost it. I lost it badly. I went into our room hyperventilating trying to catch my breath, I have anger issues however up until that point I was managing it well.
I began ranting in my journal, saying the most mean things I could possibly think of to get it out of my system. I wrote four pages long. 

Same thing goes on for weeks until one day his step father wanted to talk to us.
He said “I read what was in your journal if you really feel that way get the fuck out”
So I told him flat out “you talk about her all the time to me, why can’t I write the same in a journal?”
That only pissed him off, which in turn made me even more mad.
So after that his mom and I have a spat where she says ive been living there for free, for free??
I worked a part time job and gave them literally all my money, I only kept about $20 for my weed. I cleaned up after them even though they would trash it the second I left the kitchen. FOR FREE?? And I’ve been cleaning up after you? 

At that moment I understood what I was. I was just a maid in their eyes.
I was someone who could help them pay rent, clean up after them.


I communicated this to my boyfriend he tried to comfort me but at this point, it was not something he can comfort.

After that I lost my cat. He was mauled by an animal and our neighbors found him. He was my greatest comfort, my greatest friend. My boyfriend was very understanding he helped me a lot
His mother though, well she hated that I was grieving because her kitchen wasnt clean. (She’s the one who dirtied it anyways) 

Since then, I don’t know who I even am anymore.
I hate doing the dishes now, I only do them once a week now. I don’t broom and mop the floors anymore. I don’t clean the litterboxes anymore, the birds cage, or the tortoises.  I simply have no more energy, or will to live. I don’t even feel any hunger anymore. Water is my best friend. I don’t feel anything other than anxiety and anger. My mind has become an incredibly violent place.
I weigh 98 pounds now. I’m 5’4. When I moved in I was 124 pounds. I’ve made peace with the fact that I might die from a seizure or a heart complication. However my boyfriend has noticed this and he has been trying to get me to eat. 
He told me “your killing yourself slowly” 
And all I could do was stare out the window because how do I tell him that I feel that’s the only way out of this house?

He’s been trying to save for an apartment but his stepdad takes basically all of his money for rent. Keep in mind, my boyfriend works 5 days a week for 7 hours, they don’t have jobs. They are home all day.
Except when his step dad occasionally gets a little side job.

I recently lost my job because I don’t have a green card, I have no money for a green card. I’m scared to apply to places because even though I have no criminal record or any issues at all, I’m terrified I’ll get deported. So I can’t save money either. 

I don’t know what to do anymore.
Ive completely given up. I love my boyfriend to death so I will hold on for him and continue to try.
I just need help. I really need help and I don’t know who to go to. I feel like I’m going crazy. I feel like this is all my fault. I can’t sleep, I always feel like something bad is going to happen to me. I feel like I’m going insane or something I don’t understand why or how I’ve gotten this bad. I tried I really did my best I just I don’t know what to do anymore I have to talk myself into doing things even going to the bathroom, doing anything really “once you do this you can come back to bed” has become my motivation.

I’m at a loss.

Elliot sat alone in his dimly lit apartment, the rain tapping softly against the windowpane. The room was silent except for the hum of the refrigerator and the occasional creak of the floorboards. His phone rested in his trembling hand, the screen still glowing from a missed call—her call.

It had been three months since Mia left, but her presence lingered in every corner of his life. Her favorite sweater still hung over the chair, her coffee mug remained untouched in the sink, and the scent of her vanilla perfume faintly clung to the air. He had told himself a hundred times to move on, to clean up, to erase the traces of her—but he couldn’t.

Tonight, something felt different. Maybe it was the way the rain seemed heavier, or the way his heart ached just a little more. He finally found the courage to do what he had been avoiding for weeks.

He opened his voicemail.

""Hey, it's me... I know you won’t answer, but I just wanted to say I’m sorry. For everything. I don’t even know where to start, but... I miss you, Elliot. I miss us. I don’t know if you still think about me, but—""

There was a pause, a deep breath.

""I hope you’re okay. I really do. Anyway, take care, okay? Bye.""

Her voice cracked on the last word, and then it was over. A dead silence followed, more deafening than anything he had ever heard.

Elliot replayed the voicemail, over and over, until his tears blurred the screen. He wanted to call her, to tell her he missed her too, to ask if they could fix what was broken. But he knew it was too late.

The rain outside kept falling, and Elliot sat there in the quiet, listening to the only thing he had left of her—her voice, frozen in time.",1,1739967508.0,ShortSadStories,1,1.0,False

Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. 

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, and CS2. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago. I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck, too, and been tinkering around with it. So, if you know any good emulators or anything for it, then let me know. 

I'm down to chat about any random stuff you like to chat about. Always up to try or learn about new hobbies.",0,1739967165.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False
1it41ox,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1it41ox/my_summer_babysitter/,My Summer Babysitter,"When I was growing up, my mother would have a new boyfriend almost every month. She was an amazing woman who I wouldn’t have traded for the world but she was raised by horrible people, had an abusive high school sweetheart, and had a hard time saying “No.” The cycle usually went that she would meet some jackass at her job, I never learned what she did for a living, and likely for good reason, and he would love bomb her until he found a nicer piece of tail or found out I existed. I ended up being the deal breaker more times than not from what I can remember. Darren was the first to break the cycle sticking around for 4 months before they got engaged and he moved in which was when the troubles started. I remember being 6 years old watching Power Rangers and Darren walked over to me to put a cigarette out on the webbing between my fingers which soon became his preferred way of saying hello. Through the walls of our shitty Section 8 apartment, I could hear him screaming at my mom every night before beating her. It would only end when he went out for a beer, in which case my mom would “sleepover” in my room, or when he would get bored and demand she go to sleep. Darren made it very clear that if anyone came to check up on me or my mom that would be it for all of us and God knows I believed him. Even at my young age, I could tell from the look in his eyes that he was capable of and willing to do anything. I wore gloves year-round to hide the burns on my hands, came up with a hundred different stories for a hundred different bruises, and prayed every night the police would get lost when our neighbors called in a disturbance. When summer came around I would have the apartment to myself while Darren and Mom went to work. We didn’t have the money for camps or water parks so I would fill out phonics and math workbooks during commercial breaks. Then, about a month into the Summer, I got a knock at the door.



“Issac? My name is Finn. Your mother hired me to be your summer sitter.” I opened the door to a tall, skinny man holding a briefcase filled to bursting with toys and activities. “Hello, Issac, can I come in?”



Finn and I would do my daily homework together before making art projects or playing with the wrestling figures he brought over. We’d end each day with a walk around the neighborhood and get back just before anyone got home. I’d go back to my apartment and Finn would go to his at the very end of the hall. Every time we parted ways he’d hand me a candy from his briefcase and say “Same time tomorrow, little man” snapping his fingers and pointing at me. That would make me laugh every time. The good times with Finn gave me something to look forward to even when Darren got especially cruel. That summer his job started layoffs and despite his constant swearing they could never dump him I suspect it was the stress that led to his new rule. Talking without being spoken to was liable to get you beat, our apartment was so cramped he could hear me whisper to my mom which would always send him into a fury. I maybe spoke two times to my mom in that entire period and I didn’t dare to so much as look at Darren, not like that saved me from his wrath or anything. 



Around this time, Finn started asking me about my bruises, and I went through my usual stories to explain them. Finn wasn’t as easily deterred as a teacher or cop, however. Sometimes, he’d catch me in conflicting stories or press me on details, and I’d trip up. I stuck to my guns, however, and never told him anything. In hindsight, I wish I had, but it didn’t end up mattering. 



“Y’know, you can tell me anything. You aren’t going to be in any trouble.” I knew Finn wouldn’t hurt me but I still couldn’t say anything to him, Darren’s threats had my conscience hostage. I just said “Ok” and he gave me a look like I really hurt him with that. 



Maybe because of that, our art projects became therapy sessions. When I told Finn my dreams were scaring me we made dream catchers and talked about how to destress before bed. We made paper superhero masks when I said I wished I was braver. The one time I even implied Darren could be a bad guy, Finn had to draw a knight and a dragon then helped me prop them up on a page like a pop-up book. We had a long talk about how knights are heroes in a story, they don’t cover for bad guys or make excuses when they mess up. They summon their courage and do what’s right even if puts someone else at risk because heroes fight dragons they don’t protect them. The meaning wasn’t lost on me but at that age, you can dodge any type of guilt by just not thinking about it. No matter what my issue was, Finn had an art project for it. It was like he had everything we could ever need in that briefcase.



One day he came home stomping mad. Finn and I had made origami cranes and I planned to give mine to my mom but she didn’t get home first. Darren picked up the crane from the coffee table, sparked his cigarette lighter, and burned it in front of my eyes. I wanted to beat the shit out of him to just take my tiny, scarred hands and smash them into his chest until his ribcage broke open. I screamed in a way you can’t replicate or do justice to in writing, my breaking point was reached and I lost complete control of my body as I ran up and bit into Darren’s leg so hard I swear I felt his tibia grind between my teeth. Darren pulled me back and shouted horrible things as he wrapped his hands around my neck and squeezed. 



“I’m gonna kill you, fucking cum stain. I’m gonna bury you in a scrap yard.” He didn’t make good on that promise, he just threw me against a wall right as my vision began to blur. I scurried to my room and blocked the door with a folding chair I kept in case things got really bad. 



When my mom got home Darren wasted no time showing her his battle scar and saying I should be put up for adoption or kicked into the street. She tried to talk him down and got hit in return, I could hear her gasping for air between sobs and screaming “He’s just a baby!” as Darren desperately tried to break my makeshift barricade. He must’ve been too drunk to counter the oldest trick in the book. I didn’t sleep that night and neither did my mom, every time I braved a peek under the door I could see her slumped against the wall crying or passed out once cursing that she was ever born. When I let Finn in the next day his usual bright smile was absent. He asked about the bruise that wrapped around my neck like a scarf and I said I got it wrestling some neighborhood kids. 



“Your eyes look so tired, didn’t you sleep?” I just looked down and said I had a nightmare. Finn frowned and squatted to be eye level with me, “Issac, lets take the day off from homework. You wanna go to the zoo?” What kid doesn’t? We spent hours exploring the place, Finn put me on his shoulders when my legs got tired but wouldn’t move an inch until I was ready for the next animal. We were watching big fish in the aquarium when he sat down on a bench and I sat with him.



“What's your favorite color, Issac?” Maybe it was because we were surrounded by it but I instantly said blue. “No argument here, that's a good one. Lots of versatility too, some people think it's very calming but it’s been used to represent loyalty and trust too. Means you got a good heart, little man.” We paused to watch a shark swim over our heads in the clear viewing room. 



“How about your mom, what’s her favorite color?” I wasn’t sure about this one. Again, Darren’s tight restrictions on when we could speak had caused me to rarely speak to my mom, and at 6 years old its not like you have a lot of information about your mom memorized. I knew what colors were girly though and picked purple. “Good taste runs in the family. Purple used to be a really expensive color you know, they reserved it for royalty.” Finn’s face turned serious and he looked me in the eyes, “I know things are hard for you guys right now but try to remember your mom does a lot for you. Most people don’t appreciate it until they’re really big kids, being a mom is a thankless job most of the time, try to remind her how much you love her as often as you can, ok?” That’s the type of emotional sentiment you don’t understand until you’re older but even then I felt my heart grow a bit. The sharks above us started to chase each other and I giggled cheering on the smaller one deftly ducking his pursuer. 



On the bus ride back, Finn offered me a piece of candy and asked “What’s your least favorite color?” This one was easy, I hated yellow. “Same here buddy, never seen a shade of yellow that wasn’t tacky or garish. You ever hear someone get called ‘yellow-bellied’ on TV, Issac?” I had once in a cowboy cartoon but told Finn I didn’t know what it meant. “It means cowardly, a scaredy cat, and do you know what the mark of a real yellow-bellied man is? It's being a bully, no is more cowardly than someone who hurts others to make himself feel big.” Finn’s gaze turned inquisitive like his eyes were the interrogation lamp you see in police dramas. He asked me in the most serious tone, “Remind you of anyone, Issac?” 



God knows I wanted to say Darren. Just like when we learned about bullies in school. Just like when the preacher asked if any of us knew a bad person. Just like when the teacher asked where my bruises came from. Just like when the police asked if I had heard anything scary. I wanted to scream “Darren! Darren! It's him! Fucking shoot the bastard!” But if I did, Darren would’ve hurt us terribly. So I said no, that I don’t talk to bad guys and all my friends are nice. Finn sighed and checked his watch. “We’ve got time for one more activity little man. I think you’re gonna like this one.”



When we got home, Finn opened his briefcase and pulled out a box of cupcake mix. After a few minutes of searching for the right pans and trays we got to work and produced one beautiful tray of little domed treats. We ate them until only four were left at which point Finn set them on top of the fridge and got another box from his briefcase, frosting mix, then a set of food color droppers. We made three small bowls of frosting: Blue, purple, then yellow. Finn put blue on two cupcakes, these we shared, then purple on one, and finally, he took his time applying the yellow frosting on the last. 



“Who should we give these to?” Finn asked with a smirk. I said my mom and Finn said grown-ups can only eat one cupcake a day or they get sick, their stomachs don’t handle sugar as well as kids do. I didn’t want to but I said Darren could have one too. “Good, maybe it’ll make him happy.” Finn washed the dishes and put the cupcakes on separate plates before heading back down the hall to his apartment after giving me another piece of candy. This many sweets paired with the zoo trip had Finn in a close race with my mom and the red ranger for the greatest person alive. 



Mom got home first that day and I proudly gave her the purple cupcake. She smiled brightly for the first time I can remember seeing and asked how I made them.



“Finn helped me!” I said, beaming. She cocked her head but smiled and finished her treat. 



When Darren got home he cursed the traffic and screamed out for dinner to be ready. With lead feet and trying not to scowl, I offered him the yellow cupcake. To my surprise, he thanked me before inhaling it, even said my name. I still remember the wonderful dreams I had that night, would’ve been one for the record books if I didn’t wake with a jolt as my mom screamed bloody murder. I ran to her room because this wasn’t the screaming I had learned meant I should hide, this was a brand new kind of scream that told my instincts to check out what was happening. Lying next to my mom in bed was Darren. He had clearly been thrashing violently in his sleep with one arm under him at an unnatural angle and his knees pointing up with legs spread like he was giving birth. But his face is what I really remember, it's been a recurring topic with every therapist I’ve ever had. 



His eyes were piss yellow and wide open. Try as I have, and believe you me I have tried, I can’t open mine that wide without using my fingers and enduring some great discomfort. His jaw was open and popped to the side like a freeze frame from a Mike Tyson hook, detectives on the scene said it was dislocated. His skin was drawn tight over his skull, and this really stood out on a big guy like Darren. Imagine if you could vacuum seal one of those Mission Impossible masks and then left it out in the sun so its color fades and that's about what I was looking at. From his forehead down to the left corner of his lips was one long scratch, not the type you give yourself when you forget to trim your nails before bed but more like what a pissed-off cat leaves. All of this froze me in place. When I did get the courage to step forward, my knees buckled. Mom scooped me up and took me to the kitchen where she dialed 911. I don’t remember much of the following but after a week of questioning and investigation, they finally left us alone to piece together our lives again. 



Mom stayed home with me for a few days after that. We did my homework together and went on walks through the park. I thought about asking where Finn was, but honestly, I was still so shocked from seeing my first corpse that I didn’t say much at all during that time. When my mom went back to work, Finn came over for the last time.



“Listen, Issac, school is gonna start soon for you and that means you won’t need me for a while. I want you to be good for your mom, ok? She loves you dearly and this is going to be a hard time for her.”	“Will you be my babysitter next summer?” Finn had become like a big brother to me, I didn’t want to face the world without him or go a day without our fun arts and crafts projects.



“I’m sorry little man. I’m going to college soon and by the time summer starts for you I’m gonna be a long ways away. But we’ll always have our memories, ok? Anytime you start to miss me just do some origami like we like to do.” He smiled and put a hand on my shoulder. “If I start to miss you, I’ll watch do our Power Ranger poses.” That day he taught me how to handle the strong feelings I had in the fallout of Darren kicking the bucket and we made stress toy cootie catchers.



Mom and I moved out as soon as we were able. It took about a month of searching for an affordable spot and two months of saving money to finally leave and for all of it Mom slept with me in my bed. Not that I minded, I was honestly happy Darren was dead and I finally had time to be a kid with my mom again. When we did move out I helped move boxes down to our van. It was when I ran up to get the last box that I saw the door at the end of the hallway was open a jar. 



“Finn? Finn, you left your door open!” I shouted across the hall to no reply. I bounced over and repeated myself to the same effect. Childlike curiosity and disregard for social boundaries led me to push open the door and peek at Finn’s apartment. In hindsight, it makes sense. Just looking at the outside of the building raises questions about where you’d even have space for something there. Behind that door was just a utility closet.
