1hhwaf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Etsy/comments/1hhwaf3/etsys_super_inaccurate_estimated_times_part_2/,Etsy's super inaccurate estimated times part 2,"So around a week ago I made a post regarding Etsy's super short estimated dates. I decided to contact support as I've had at least 5 buyers messaging me about their item not arriving ""on time"" because Etsy's estimates showed items would be delivered a week or two after placing their order when in reality it can take up to 30 business days. I recommend checking my original post first to get the context.

Here's how Etsy pretty much responded to me: 

""We recognize that not every transaction will go as planned. In this case, It's a good idea to step back and consider what resolutions are available. If the order is late, give the buyer a timeline for when the order is expected to arrive and what options are available if the order isn't delivered (in time).¬†This will set clear expectations for you and the buyer. You can also use this opportunity to discuss certain details, such as if the order will need to be returned or if a shipping claim should be filed.  

**The estimated delivery dates are generated automatically by Etsy's system, which can sometimes overlook the settings you've established.** This can lead to confusion for both sellers and buyers, especially during peak seasons. **Moving forward, ensure your processing and shipping times are set to reflect realistic expectations, especially during busy periods.**""

Let me just say that Etsy should really invest in their own customer support. Most of these customers wouldn't probably have ordered if they knew that the estimated delivery is actually later and I don't blame them for being concerned about their order as it was Etsy's mistake. Not only were my shipping settings ignored but also my processing times. 

I've seen lots of sellers complaining about this error in their system and it is really unfair that this all falls for us to solve and explain to customers. Like one person said in my original post's comments, it is really suspicious that this started happening around November when people are purchasing Christmas gifts. Unfortunately all of us can't ship with tracked shipping as Etsy labels aren't available everywhere and in my country shipping is over 50‚Ç¨ even if you'd send a sticker so I doubt Etsy would refund these orders out of their pocket.

Sorry for my grammar and if what I am saying doesn't make much sense, these all nighters, coffee and dealing with holiday customers has made my brain numb.",1,1734624610.0,Etsy,1,1.0,False

1hhw9z9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hhw9z9,Hyatt Centric South Beach,"
I booked an Oceanview king room, priced at about $225 per night. Plus resort fees and three different types of taxes: city, county, and tax on the resort fees.  

The nightly room price doubles next week as we get closer to the holidays. The price would have been $500 per night plus resort fees and taxes the following week. And  the same price for the weeks prior to my trip.  $225 per night seemed like a good deal for a Miami Beach resort.

Although the address is listed as 1600 Collins Avenue, the extremely underwhelming entrance to the hotel is in reality, around the corner on 16th Avenue across from an indoor parking garage and adjacent to another parking garage. I thought it was the service entrance, but it‚Äôs the only entrance. The hotel has one side of rooms on the Collins Avenue side, and it is set back from the road, and located above other businesses. My ‚Äúocean-view‚Äù room faced the garage entrance rather than Collins Avenue.

Although you can see small patches of the Atlantic between the existing high rise hotel buildings, the room is far from a true Oceanview room IMO. 

I was billed several thousand dollars twice for my weeklong stay in error.  It took five days for the second charge to be removed. One clerk claimed it was for incidental charges, another told me it was a glitch in their self check-in system.  

Other than a pool this location is not a resort. 

To access the gym or spa you need to cross Collins and use the St. Moritz (owned by Loews Hotel) facilities.  The beach as well can be accessed only through Loews/St. Moritz Hotel walkway. A mandatory resort fee for a hotel that you need to go elsewhere to use the gym or to access the beach?  So not a resort. 

You do get decent WiFi included but that‚Äôs about it. There are no gift shops or convenience stores on premises. To enter the ‚Äúon premises‚Äù coffee bar on the hotel website, you need to walk to this shop around the corner, rather than simply taking the elevator to a coffee bar downstairs. The Hyatt website is misleading in many ways.  I couldn‚Äôt imagine what incidentals I could charge that would equal the same amount of my weekly room charge.

No room service.  In fact the advertised ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù only serves breakfast and bar snacks after 3 pm with a very limited menu.  No lunch.  No dinner. So not really a restaurant. Breakfast for one was $40.  

Virtually no one was in this bar or restaurant all week, although there are plenty of nearby options as this is Miami Beach. 

The room is decent sized with a marble bathroom and both a rainfall shower and handheld shower-head.  Housekeeping was very accommodating and the halls are mostly fairly quiet, except for guest room doors slamming closed.

For a hotel located in a major city and tourist destination there are very few services offered to guests. 

I asked the front desk clerk for change of a $20 bill, she said she couldn‚Äôt help me at 9 am, but she told me her supervisor would be on duty in a few hours.  So maybe later?  This seems like a small request.   Two days later I returned to the front desk, the clerk said she could only give me two $10 bills as change.

The AC stopped working after two days, and I called the front desk several times starting at 3 pm for service but my phone calls were not answered.  The AC was never repaired during my weeklong stay.  It only worked when set to 62 degrees which gets too cold so it has to be cycled manually on and off.  The room gets warm - turn the AC back on.  It gets too cold - turn the AC back off.  Repeat every few minutes.  Despite staff assurances that it be would be fixed when I made requests for repairs, no one showed up.

In reality this location should be marketed as a Hyatt Place and priced without resort fees, as the only resort feature on premises is a pool.  Every roadside motel in this country has a pool, without an additional resort fee.  It is just another obvious money grab.  There is often only one person staffing the front desk, answering the phone (or sometimes not) and even making drinks at the bar, or seating guests and pouring coffee at breakfast. Just like a Hyatt Place. 

I won‚Äôt make this mistake again.  ",1,1734624579.0,hyatt,0,1.0,False

My babies called him grandpa and he adored them. He always seemed so so so happy especially when he would see my kiddos. It was a small town and the bar allowed kids early in the day( they open at 8am). The older guys all went there early in the day for coffee and to talk and all adored my kids in a grandpa way.

So far, gentlemen, more than enough for this 2024.

It has been an intense month and a half from which I hope you have learned something with the DDs.

I still owe you a DD with the companies I will buy in the event of a recession in 2025.

It has been a pleasure riding with everyone who has followed the DDs during this month and a half, especially all the people who believed in ACHR from the beginning and saw the value it had in the long term.

I myself was waiting patiently for about 2 months before it exploded in November.

A special thanks to those 29 people who have invited me for a coffee and have recognized the value of all the information I have been publishing (these are the last ones. Seriously, I appreciate that!)

And a special hug to the haters, to whom I have no grudge, but I would recommend them to be better people in the future.

In a few days I will upload that Christmas present.

1hhw6yj,https://i.redd.it/vo9mreurwt7e1.jpeg,"First bin, looking for advice ","I am currently making a bedding for my first worm box. I‚Äôve read many guides and contradictory information confuses me a little. My bin is a 20 gal with holes in the bottom and is in another bin without holes to catch the lechetate. I plan on getting european nightcrawler since I want to use them as fish bait eventually. 

Here‚Äôs the list of the materials used for the bedding:
- 300 shredded printer sheets 
- all the cardboard in my house (3-4 amazon boxes)
- recycled terrarium that dried up and died containing 2 bricks of coco, a handful of rinced and crushed charcoal, a little bit of sphagnum moss, oak and maple leaves and sticks. 
All of this fills the bin up to 3/4 of only brown materials. 
- I won‚Äôt have worms before next week, but I‚Äôll feed them mainly coffee grounds, sweet potatoes and banana peel. 

So here‚Äôs the questions:
- is this too much bedding to start a bin?
- some guides says too much brown isn‚Äôt good, but never say why. So is it really bad?
- the sticks are pretty big and won‚Äôt degrade fast. Are they still useful as mold/fungus host or should I remove them?
- I don‚Äôt have much eggshells on hand right now. Can I crush a cuttlefish bone and use this as grit?

1hhw5bm,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hhw5bm/ghost_from_work/,Ghost from work,"So this girl at an old job was sizing me up for a while. She made sure I had extra help, she would go out of her way to talk to me, I would catch her looking at my tramp stamp if I streched, she occasionally would bend over so I could see. Heard her say I crack her up. If I called out she would ask me quick things about my life.

Only thing is I had a longterm girlfriend for a chunk, so I ignored it. Then when we broke up, she asked, ""And you don't wanna be with her anymore?!"" Excitedly. ""You deserve better."" Followed later.

Then I get a new job. She calls out a few days but makes sure to come on my last. I get the balls to ask her for coffee, she agrees. I wait a few weeks before asking.

I put in the wrong place in the GPS, so I fucked up there. But she still agreed to relocate due to the original place closing. She opens with a hug, and ends with one saying, ""let's do this again."" The conversation went fine enough, we're both awkward. She did the lean in, the intense state. And she alluded to being one at one point. Then when I mentioned something about living in a dream, she asked, ""it's like living in a dream?!"" As if she was expecting a certain answer about her. (Context, we give off eerily similar vibes like we're 3/4 clones. So her existence, to me, is in fact dreamlike.) But I didn't learn into this, why I don't know.

That's when the pullback started. Gave her my gamer info to share and asked if she wanted to see lights. Said she was busy that weekend, and never added me. Wait a few more days and ask to chat, ""after the gym."" Then I call and nothing. Wait a week and ask th get that next coffee, crickets.

So I'm just confused. I heard maybe she has a boyfriend. All I know is her rent is too high to pay alone, but she might have a girlfriend for that. Didn't ask her situation because it felt rude. But she did talk about friends a lot over her time. Did I just get bottom rostered? Was I an ego boost, did she just feel bad for me? Was me having a girlfriend the real thing here?

I don't know, we'll never know. But if y'all could help sus it out I would appreciate it. It's just so strange to me that you would do all that for... this. Girl even saw me at my worst and still got the first coffee. The fuck? Any insight is appreciated.

(Tempted to text her a wall after Christmas even though it sounds dumb. But there just seems to be so much unspoken. Not to shit talk her or anything. Kinda wanna give my clarity and leave this in '24.)",1,1734624238.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

Hi,

I have a experience/question for you all, because I think that you probably had similar experience and I don't know where to ask. I will describe my situation with one woman. It's a long post so thank you for reading.

Anyway,  there is a woman (straight and has a boyfriend and 11 years older than me) at my work with whom I kinda instantly clicked. I'm bi but closeted, and I would bet my life she is also(I can't go into specific details about her and why I think that, who knows who lurks what subreddit)

Whenever we got into normal conversation or worked together on a project, things were very natural and smooth and she thinks I'm funny and laughs to my jokes etc. So i got the impression she likes or liked me.

I will describe some situstions, there are many more, but I think this will be enough from top of my head. 

She engaged first contact and was always looking at me and basically showing interest in me.

We started comunicating more and one time I came to her and made a joke: ""like, you must be happy to see me"" and she looked me dead in the eyes and said with soft voice ""I'm always happy when I see you"".

Also, she would always bitting her lips when we were talking and looking at me.

Then, we went to a coffee at work and I was petting the dog and she came from behind me and stroked my hair and proceeded to my back. As we were walking to get the coffee I said that i just wanted some one on one time with her and she smiled and asked if I was gonna hit on her which is a really strange question for someone who has boyfriend and is straight and also a coworker..

After that we were kinda going back and forth and I noticed that she can't look me in the eyes and in a way avoids me but at the same time is happy to see me.

I always caught her looking at me whenever she saw me and when I looked at her direction she quickly turned her head the other way.

I don't know how to describe this but it's like at the same time she was interested and wanted to be close but also like runnin from me.

Now, at the time I already fell for her but I wasn't showing it. I decided to kinda step back, I wasn't messaging her, just say hi when I saw her.  It continued to be like i described, constant looking from her side.

Then, one day I was talking with another colleague about my new car and she saw me, smiled and said ""oh finally I only see you in the hallways"".

And it continued to be like this back and forth for the rest of the year but with good comunication at work and messaging here and there. 
When I came to the office(at that period she was on my floor with my team) she wouldn't say hi.
But again looking at me and listening everything I was talking about. When i was talking with someone on the hallway she would always pay attention also.
But, when she saw me she couldn't look me in the eye. 
Also, i came once to the office and was talking with another colleague about a project, she listened carefully the whole time and said ""well you obviously explained that good to the client"". 

Then one day we were talking and I said that I was driving really fast. She begin yelling at me instantly like are you insane you will kill yourself and so on... my other colleagues never got that kind of reaction and when i told them about hers they were like wtf.

So basically she got worried that I would end up dead in an accident. 

To repeat, none other colleagues, male or female didn't have that reaction or was that worried.

At one party, she also told me that i smoke too much(after watching me constantly). Why if we are basically nothing? Other colleagues never commented something like that. 

Also, before that sentence, when I approached my colleague who was sitting next to her she looked down and got nervous. 

When I started talking to him, she looked at me and listened very carefully (she was like 30 cm from my face bacause  ihad to lean forward because of the music and it was really a starring like before, not just like when you listen someone in conversation).

Again I mentioned my fast driving ( i had another car while my was at repair) and said like it goes fast as well. She was again mad and said yeah I bet it does.

I decided to distance myself from her bacause at the time I was very confused and i thought that I was crazy and it's all in my head(probably was).

I bought new lego and my package arrived at reception. She went by and stopped and asked ""oo you buyed a new one"" and proceed to look at it while i answered only yes (this is me distancing lol).

Then, again this constant looking/no looking until another party.
She asked me how it's going and i said look i distanced myself i don't wanna be in your way and she was like surprised and i moved to another spot.

Later we met again and had a talk and i confronted her and said that i'm not stupid and I see that she basically avoiding me.

She replied that she has her group of people at work and she is like on hi with everyone else also(not true). She seemed agitated while responding.
Then she told me that this doesn't mean that she has a bad opinion about me it is actually the opposite and while telling me this she again look down, couldn't look me in the eyes.

Also she was like ""you didn't show/send me a picture of lego"". And I showed her and she snatched my phone to take a closer look and brushed my hand while doing so.

After that I decided to distance myself even further and stopped communicating entirely. I basically told myself I'm an idiot for thinking she likes me and I got it all wrong.

Situation was the same, looking at me but when I come close can't look me in the eyes and like runnin but also showing interes.

After she got back from vacation I continued to ignored her and she was looking at me(not just glance, prolonged looking like scanning almost)

One day I held a door for my colleague and she was behind him but someone called her so she went 2 steps back but when she saw I was holding the door she rushed towards and said thank you as if I was holding it for her and then she got back to that person calling her.  

She very obviously used this situation to come closer to me and this little ""interaction"" was the first one after a couple of months.

Then there was another party which I didn't attend but we got like appreciation from our colleagues for work. 
I got one and she texted me saying something along the lines you got it, well deserved! 

And this damn text got me both mad, happy and confused and I got right back to the start and also overthinking.

But to be honest I don't hold any hopes and I'm doing better every day getting over this stupidity of my.

We communicate alright here and then and say hi. Also, I gotta be careful because we are at work so I'm trying to get a right mix of ignoring and engaging with her.

She still looks at me, deep prolonged look that I always catch and then sudden head turning. 
When passing by me still can't look me in the eyes...

But I don't care anymore.

My only question is was I really that stupid and got the wrong impression cause maybe she was just polite or is simply easygoing and I somehow thought ooh, a woman likes me or based on what i described, she likes me(or did like me) and it scared her and that is why she acts hot/cold?

I just hope I learned something from this situation.",1,1734624218.0,WLW,0,0.99,False

It hit me‚Äîif we‚Äôre going to talk about girlhood and its magic, there‚Äôs no better way than through these timeless stories. Classics written by incredible women have a way of capturing girlhood and womanhood in such a powerful, emotional way. It‚Äôs like having the deepest, most beautiful conversations with women from the past who just *get it.*

Here‚Äôs a peek into my favorite classics that I think *scream* girlhood. These books have been with me for years, and I‚Äôll never stop loving them! üíñ

üìñ My Favorite Girlhood Classics

‚ú® The Entire Jane Austen Collection:  
If you love *Bridgerton,* you *need* to dive into Jane Austen! Her books are about love, wit, and learning to stand tall in a world that‚Äôs not always kind to women. Each story feels like a masterclass in navigating girlhood and womanhood.

Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs on my shelf:

* Pride and Prejudice: A classic love story full of misunderstandings, growth, and swoon-worthy moments. üñ§ Movie Adaptations:
   * 2005 (My absolute favorite‚ÄîKeira Knightley is perfection!)
   * 1995 BBC miniseries (incredible if you have time to binge).
* Sense and Sensibility: A tale of two sisters navigating love and heartbreak in different ways. üé¨ Movie Adaptation: 1995, starring Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet.
* Emma: A matchmaking queen who learns that sometimes, love is closer than you think. üéÄ Movie Adaptations:
   * 2020 (gorgeous aesthetics!)
   * 1996 with Gwyneth Paltrow.
* Persuasion: A bittersweet story of second chances and enduring love. üïäÔ∏è Movie Adaptations:
   * 1995 version (a fan favorite!).
   * 2022 Netflix adaptation (not my favorite, but it‚Äôs there!).
* Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey: These lesser-known Austen works have their own movie versions too!

‚ú® Little Women by Louisa May Alcott:  
A heartfelt story of sisters, dreams, and growing up. Jo March is the ultimate girlhood icon‚Äîbold, passionate, and full of ambition. üí™üìú  
üé• Movie Adaptations:

* 2019 (my personal favorite‚ÄîSaoirse Ronan and Timoth√©e Chalamet are EVERYTHING!).
* Older versions: 1994, 1949, and 1933.

‚ú® Anne of Green Gables by L.M. Montgomery:  
Anne Shirley‚Äôs imagination, fiery spirit, and love for the world make this a must-read. üçÅ‚ú®  
üé¨ Movie Adaptations:

* *Anne of Green Gables* (1985 miniseries is iconic!).
* Netflix‚Äôs *Anne with an E* (a fresh take with a deeper lens).

‚ú® A Little Princess by Frances Hodgson Burnett:  
A story about kindness, resilience, and staying strong no matter what. üëëüíõ  
üé• Movie Adaptations:

* 1995 (my favorite‚Äîso magical!).
* 1939 (an older but charming version).



üìö Classics I Haven‚Äôt Read Yet but Can‚Äôt Wait To Dive Into

There are also some amazing classics I‚Äôve been dreaming of reading after learning more about them. They sound like they‚Äôll capture girlhood in such powerful ways, and I can‚Äôt wait to get lost in these stories:

* Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier: A gothic tale of love, mystery, and self-discovery. From what I‚Äôve heard, it‚Äôs hauntingly beautiful and so compelling! üé• Movie Adaptations:
   * 1940 Hitchcock film (an absolute classic).
   * 2020 Netflix version (mixed reviews, but worth exploring!).
* Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront√´: The story of a fierce, independent woman navigating love, loss, and self-respect. Everyone says Jane Eyre is one of the most relatable and inspiring heroines ever. üé¨ Movie Adaptations:
   * 2011 (starring Mia Wasikowska and Michael Fassbender).
   * 1996 (a more traditional take).
* The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett: A magical story about healing, friendship, and finding beauty in the world around you. üå± üé• Movie Adaptations:
   * 1993 (this one‚Äôs on my to-watch list‚Äîit‚Äôs supposed to be so lovely!).

  


üí° Why Classics Are Perfect for Girlhood Conversations

Reading these books is like sitting down with the most interesting women from the past and hearing their stories. They show us how girlhood‚Äîno matter the time period‚Äîis full of strength, joy, heartbreak, and growth. Jane Austen, in particular, feels like she‚Äôs whispering timeless advice through her characters. üåü

If you‚Äôre not a big reader but still want to experience these classics, the movie adaptations are a great way to start! üé¨ Trust me, the 2005 *Pride and Prejudice* and 2019 *Little Women* will steal your heart.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening can give you a stunning, brighter smile, but post-treatment care is crucial for maintaining that radiance. After your whitening procedure, it‚Äôs essential to choose the right foods. Some foods can help preserve your bright smile, while others can dull it. Here's a guide to the best foods you can enjoy that are gentle on your newly whitened teeth and continue to keep you feeling great.

### Understand the Importance of Food Choices

After whitening, your teeth may be more susceptible to staining and sensitivity. Therefore, it‚Äôs vital to consume foods that will not compromise your investment in a brighter smile. Being mindful of what you eat in the first 48 hours can significantly impact the longevity of your results.

### Foods to Enjoy After Teeth Whitening

Here‚Äôs a curated list of foods that are safe and beneficial for your teeth after whitening:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Plain Yogurt:** This is a great choice because it's low in acidity and high in calcium that strengthens your teeth.
- **Scrambled Eggs:** Soft, easy to chew, and low in staining potential, scrambled eggs make a perfect meal.
- **Soft Fruits:** Bananas, melons, and apples (in moderation) are safe as they don‚Äôt stain. They provide essential vitamins and hydration.
- **Oatmeal:** This filling breakfast option is not just good for you; it‚Äôs also easy on sensitive teeth.
- **Vegetable Soups:** Opt for non-tomato-based soups to avoid acidity and staining; think pureed vegetable soups instead.
- **Fish and Chicken:** These proteins are a safe bet. They are nutrient-rich and less likely to stain when prepared without strong spices or sauces.
- **Rice and Pasta:** Plain rice or pasta dishes can be easily digested and do not discolor teeth.
- **Milk and Cheese:** Dairy products can help neutralize acidity while providing calcium to strengthen enamel.

### Foods to Avoid

To keep your teeth bright, make sure to steer clear of certain foods and drinks right after your treatment:

- **Dark and Staining Foods:** Foods like blueberries, beets, and soy sauce can leave stubborn stains.
- **Tomato-Based Products:** These are acidic and can lead to discoloration. Avoid pasta sauces, ketchup, and any heavily spiced dishes.
- **Colored Beverages:** Red wine, coffee, and dark teas have high staining potential. Even light teas can be problematic, so opt for clear drinks like water or herbal teas.
- **Citrus Fruits:** Oranges, lemons, and grapefruits are acidic and may irritate sensitive teeth.
- **Spicy Foods:** Spices can cause discomfort, especially if your teeth are sensitive after whitening.

### Additional Tips for Maintaining Your Bright Smile

Aside from choosing the right foods, consider these additional tips to extend the life of your whitening results:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Stay Hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to help rinse away food particles and bacteria.
- **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss daily to keep your smile bright.
- **Use a Straw:** When consuming drinks that may stain, use a straw to minimize contact with your teeth.
- **Regular Dental Check-ups:** Keep up with your dental appointments for professional cleanings and advice on maintaining your results.

Making smart food choices after teeth whitening is essential for maintaining your dazzling smile. Enjoying soft, low-stain foods and beverages while avoiding those that are dark or acidic will help you keep your teeth looking their best. With a bit of mindfulness in your diet, you can enjoy all the benefits of your brighter smile for a long time to come.

After undergoing teeth whitening, it‚Äôs essential to take proper care of your teeth to maintain that bright smile for as long as possible. You want to avoid foods and habits that might stain your teeth or diminish the whitening effect. Let's explore some tips to help you care for your teeth post-whitening treatment.

### Be Mindful of What You Eat

Your diet plays a key role in keeping your teeth white. After a whitening session, it‚Äôs best to steer clear of certain foods and beverages. Here are some items to avoid:

- **Dark-colored beverages:** Coffee, tea, red wine, and sodas can easily stain your newly whitened teeth.
- **Colored foods:** Berries, beets, soy sauce, and tomato sauce should be consumed with caution.
- **Acidic foods:** Citrus fruits can weaken enamel, making your teeth more susceptible to staining.

Instead, focus on a diet that includes:

- **Light-colored foods:** Foods like cauliflower, chicken, and fish are less likely to cause staining.
- **Water:** Staying hydrated helps wash away food particles and bacteria.
- **Dairy products:** Cheese and yogurt can help neutralize acid in your mouth and maintain oral health.

### Follow Post-Treatment Instructions

Your dentist will likely provide specific care instructions after your whitening treatment. Following these directions is crucial for achieving the best results. Some general guidelines include:

- Do not eat or drink for at least 30 minutes following the treatment.
- Avoid whitening toothpaste for about two weeks post-treatment.
- Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently clean your teeth without causing abrasion.

### Maintain Proper Oral Hygiene

Good dental care is essential in keeping your teeth white. Implement the following habits into your routine:

- **Brush twice a day:** Use fluoride toothpaste to help strengthen enamel.
- **Floss daily:** Flossing removes plaque and food particles, preventing stains.
- **Use mouthwash:** An anti-staining mouthwash can help keep your teeth white.

### Avoid Tobacco Products

If you smoke or use other tobacco products, it's time to consider quitting. Tobacco is notorious for staining teeth and can severely undermine the results of your whitening treatment. Making the switch to a tobacco-free lifestyle not only benefits your oral health but also improves your overall well-being.

### Regular Dental Visits

Regular check-ups with your dentist are vital for keeping your teeth healthy and white. During these visits, your dentist can:

- Professionally clean your teeth and remove plaque buildup.
- Assess the health of your gums and teeth to ensure everything is in good shape.
- Provide touch-up whitening options if necessary.

Scheduling these appointments every six months is a great plan for ongoing dental care.

### Be Cautious with Over-the-Counter Products

While many whitening products are available at pharmacies, not all of them may suit your dental needs. If you opt for at-home whitening treatments, it‚Äôs crucial to choose safely. Consult your dentist before using products to avoid irritation or damage to your enamel.

### Tips for Freshening Breath

Keeping your breath fresh can help enhance your bright smile. Follow these tips:

- Stay hydrated to promote saliva production, which naturally cleans your mouth.
- Chew sugar-free gum to stimulate saliva and reduce plaque.
- Consume crunchy fruits and vegetables like apples and carrots that help clean your teeth.

By following these tips for caring for your teeth after whitening, you can enjoy a radiant smile and avoid the pitfalls of staining and discoloration. Remember, consistency in your dental care habits will support the longevity of your white teeth. Keep smiling!

### Conclusion

Maintaining a bright smile after teeth whitening is a combination of smart food choices and diligent oral care. By choosing the best foods to enjoy post-treatment, you not only keep your smile radiant but also support overall dental health. Soft, non-staining options such as yogurt, applesauce, and steamed vegetables make excellent choices for snacks and meals. These foods are gentle on your teeth and help avoid any potential discomfort during the initial healing phase after whitening.

Additionally, incorporating plenty of water into your daily routine ensures that you stay hydrated and helps rinse away food particles that can cause stains or discoloration. Limiting acidic and dark-colored foods is crucial in the first few days post-treatment, as this will help maintain the shine of your newly whitened teeth. This means steering clear of coffee, tea, and vibrant berries, opting instead for milder alternatives.

The tips for caring for your teeth after whitening should not be overlooked. Regular brushing with non-abrasive toothpaste and flossing daily plays a significant role in prolonging the effects of whitening. It's also wise to visit your dentist for routine check-ups, as they can provide tailored advice specific to your dental health.

By embracing these food selections and care tips, you can enjoy both a dazzling smile and a healthy mouth. Remember, a little effort in your post-whitening routine can go a long way in keeping your smile bright and beautiful for longer.

It looks extremely bloated and puffy, and just does not look as healthy as before. 

When I look at photos of me from september and october my face looks slim and well shaped, almost as clear as glass, and looks very healthy.  

My friends and parents have told me ""your face looks kinda different"". The difference is very clearly noticeable in photos.

I am not conscious at all about how I look, but I'm scared there could be an underlying health issue or maybe something wrong I am doing.

I did not gain or lose any weight. I am not dehydrated at all since I drink around 4 liters of water a day. I did not make any changes in physical activity/sports. I don't have any allergies and I did not make any changes in my diet, and I eat relatively healthy.

Some things I do (Don't know if they can cause this problem):

-I drink a bit more coffee than normal.

-I recently resumed taking my stimulant medication for ADHD after a 1 month tolerance break.

-My sleep has been bad since the end of october, especially due to my exams. (For example, 4.2 hours of average daily sleep for this exam week) Still, after sleeping 9-11 hours on weekends there is no improvement in my face. 

-Recently, I've been showering with hot water more frequently, sometimes 3 times a day.

Can these stuff I listed cause this, and what are some other factors that could cause this because I have no idea why this is happening.

https://imgur.com/a/R2TfCwW

These two graphs show limited correlation to the point that it should be considered an independent mover. Infact if you look at yesterday‚Äôs terrible red day, you can see that the coffee futures had a positive day. There are a few days where the coffee futures are moving in the same direction, those should be seen as outlier‚Äôs. 

The scatter plot shows that the correlation between coffee futures and the s&p 500 are 0.035 for 2024. 
According to Pearson correlation coefficient, 0.0‚Äî¬±0.1 is negligible or no correlation.

This is a super cool thing to highlight since I‚Äôve been seeing a lot of post about big losses yesterday, if you where looking for a way to diversify- it could very well be in coffee futures.

1hhvrcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hhvrcl/deer_of_the_old_dominion/,deer of the Old Dominion,"
as i stepped out onto my porch, sipping my morning coffee, i noticed a lone deer grazing in my front yard. it‚Äôs large brown eyes seemed to lock onto mine, and for a moment, we just stared at each other. i felt a shiver run down my spine, but i brushed it off as mere curiosity. after all, deer were common in our rural area.

but as the days went by, i started to notice a pattern. every night, around dusk, the same deer would appear in my yard. it would stand there, motionless, watching my house with an unnerving intensity. i tried to shoo it away, but it wouldn't budge. instead, they would back away slowly, their eyes fixed on me with a malevolent glare. it was as if they were warning me to stay away, to not interfere with whatever it was they were waiting for.

at first, i thought it was just a curious animal, but as the nights passed, i started to feel a growing sense of unease. the deer's presence seemed to be... deliberate. as if it was waiting for something, or someone.

and then, on the fourth night, i saw another deer join the first. they stood side by side, their eyes fixed on my house. i felt a chill run down my spine as i realized that i was being watched by not one, but two pairs of unblinking eyes.

over the next few days, the number of deer grew. five, ten, twenty... they just kept coming. they would gather in my yard every night, their eyes glowing in the dark. i tried to stay inside, but i could feel their presence, even through the walls.

it was as if they were waiting for something to happen. something that would signal... what? i had no idea, but the anticipation was suffocating.

one night, i woke up to the sound of rustling leaves and snapping twigs. i looked out the window, and my heart nearly stopped. there were hundreds of deer in my yard, their eyes shining like a sea of lanterns. they were packed tightly together, their bodies swaying gently in the breeze.

i was paralyzed with fear, unable to move or speak. the deer seemed to be... pulsing, as if they were connected by some unseen force. and then, in perfect synchrony, they turned their heads towards my house.

i felt a cold sweat break out all over my body as i realized that i was the focus of their attention. whatever they were waiting for, it was me.

i was left shaken, wondering what had just happened. was it some kind of bizarre animal behavior? or was it something more... sinister?

as i stood there, trying to make sense of it all, i felt a creeping sense of dread. the deer may have disappeared, but i knew that they would be back. and next time, i had a feeling that they wouldn't be alone.

as the nights went by, the deer continued to gather in my yard. but it wasn't just their numbers that unsettled me - it was their behavior. they seemed to be watching me with an unnerving intensity, their eyes gleaming with a mixture of fear and suspicion.

at first, i thought it was just my imagination. but as i observed the deer more closely, i realized that they were indeed acting strangely. they would sniff the air nervously, their ears twitching at the slightest sound. they seemed to be waiting for something to happen, their bodies tense and alert.

as the days passed, the deer's behavior became increasingly erratic. they would appear in my yard at all hours of the night, their eyes glowing like embers in the dark. they seemed to be patrolling the perimeter of my property, as if they were guarding something.

i started to feel like i was under siege, with the deer gathering in my yard like an army of sentinels. i couldn't sleep at night, my ears straining to catch the sound of their hooves on the grass.

and then, one night, i saw something that made my blood run cold. As i looked out the window, i saw one of the deer approaching my front door. it sniffed at the threshold, its ears twitching nervously.

suddenly, it let out a high-pitched bleat, and the other deer gathered in the yard turned to face my house. they seemed to be waiting for something to happen, their eyes fixed on my front door with an unnerving intensity.

i knew then that i had to get out of there. i grabbed my keys and made a run for my car, not stopping until i was miles away from my house.

as i looked back in the rearview mirror, i saw the deer gathered in my yard, their eyes glowing devilishly. i knew then that i would never be able to go back to that house again.",1,1734623206.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I am new to this community and I need some advice. I am not super familiar with the formatting of these, so apologies in advance if it's not correct :P. A bit of background; I just graduated college not too long ago, and I decided its time for some much needed time off before I apply to graduate school. My parents loved that idea too; so much so, that they shipped me off with nothing but the clothes on my back and a crisp $50 bill. ""Time to learn about the real world"" and all that. Anyway, I found a cheap little one bedroom in the city, looking to bum around for a while. As for the advice: my parents, after some tense conversation, agreed to send what little I had left at their place (just some old clothes and whatnot) so that the apartment didn't feel so empty. I planned to unload the clothes into my closet, but upon opening it, I felt a pit form in my stomach. The closet felt. . . off. Like an electric field, almost; its hard to explain. After feeling around the floor, I found an old notebook tucked in the back. It had the word ""THOUGHTS"" printed in black across the front, and it looked like shit. Torn in places, what looked like a burn mark across the back, I opened it up, and it looked like some sort of diary. In hindsight I figure it's probably bad news, but I couldn't help but read it. After a while, I realized I'd been reading it for almost an hour. I felt sick all of the sudden, shoving it into a desk drawer and tried to forget about it. Has this happened to anyone else before? After typing it all out, in hindsight it doesn't even seem that scary, so I'm hoping it's just me, but the whole experience is driving me nuts. I'll leave some of what I've read here; if nothing else, I have to get it off my chest. Thanks in advance for the help! I'll do my best to answer any questions y'all have!

Winter air swept into my bedroom lazily, stirring me from an agitated sleep. My sheets clung to me, begging me not to get up yet. Opening silently, my eyes blinked the sleep away as pale gray light flooded in from my sheer curtains. My leg caked in sweat, I breathed in the lazy winter air in a feeble attempt at wicking it away. My body was hot, tired, and achy from the day before; what I would give for a day off.



*Another day in paradise.*



Rubbing my stubble absentmindedly, I let out an exasperated half-yawn half-groan. *Shit. It's gonna be one of those mornings huh.* Pushing myself to sitting, I fumbled for my phone on the bedside table, staring back at my unkempt facial hair and hollow point eyes on the black screen. *This is gonna be a bitch to get off.* Whatever. I‚Äôll just have to budget a little more time this morning. Nothing that hasn‚Äôt happened before. Tossing my phone absentmindedly onto the pillow, I swung my leg over the side of the bed, the sheets rustling in protest. My gnarled fingers found my crutch, pale light probing into the just-as-gnarled wood grain like a patient on an operating table. My crutch, my cane, my discarded piece of wood, whatever you want to call it. Solid, comfortable, unobtrusive; if nothing else, at least it could get the job done. My fingers found their familiar handhold instantly, as if growing into it themselves. *How comforting.* I groaned as I stood, letting the ache in my joints marinate for a moment before trudging to my wardrobe. My wardrobe. A sight for sore eyes, and my, how sore they were.¬†



‚ÄúOpen.‚Äù



The wardrobe complied eagerly, a *PING* ringing out as its brass handles met the dry mahogany some would call a wall. My wall. It might‚Äôve been considered strong, even stately once. Eaten through by age, however, it seemed to drain the life out of the room, desperately attempting to rejuvenate itself. *You aren‚Äôt gonna have much luck here.* The corners of my mouth curled up gently, a smirk threatening to smear across my face, only to sink at the itchy reminder of my patchy chin. I faced the inky, clothing-filled depths before me, still unwilling to start the day. As if nudging me onward, the once lazy air slithered up my back before perching itself in the decorative curlicues atop the wardrobe. My eyes flitting in contempt, I relented and hung my crutch into the hooks I fashioned from one of the wardrobe‚Äôs too-perfect doors. My left leg balanced my wiry frame as I shifted my attention to the too-perfect mirror on the opposite door, flexing instinctively to keep me upright. *Time to rip off the Band-Aid.*¬†

With a swift motion, my fingernails burrowed into my jawline, pulling my skin taught like a fishing line. Once my fingers found purchase, like the corner of a fitted sheet, they slipped my current face off with a wet *SHLUP*. Sucking in through my clenched teeth, I winced as I adjusted to the dramatic temperature shift, that winter air greedily burrowing itself into my now exposed form. *I wonder if this is what it feels like after you shave*. With the sleep chased off momentarily, I tossed the face into the wardrobe‚Äôs maw, leaving it to drown in a sea of clothes and other accessories. I stared into the mirror, ensuring I didn‚Äôt leave any bits behind. I‚Äôve gotten pretty good as time went on, but it‚Äôs like peeling a potato: sometimes you miss a few spots that you have to go back for. I painstakingly combed through my shadowy form for a few minutes more, cursing my decision to go to bed before taking it off first. Once I was satisfied, my milky black form staring back at me from the too-perfect mirror, I sifted through the wardrobe aimlessly. *I‚Äôm probably just gonna have to change anyway; I don‚Äôt even know why I bother*. After searching for what felt like hours, I bit my thumb with a *tch*. Brow furrowed, I hopped back to my bed, my bedsheets cushioning me in delight. Should it be a dress today? Suit? Too many decisions. I laid back, stretching myself as wide as possible across my ocean of bedsheets. *I make enough of those as it is.* Agitated, I grabbed my phone off the pillow, hoisting myself up once more. Whatever. I can just come back and change if I don‚Äôt like it. Digging through hangers of freshly laundered clothes, I retrieved a simple gray pleated skirt, a black button down, and a plain gray headband. A single black flat sat neatly at the foot of the wardrobe, a white frilly sock tucked inside.



*Good enough*.



I freed my crutch from the wardrobe, lifting my shoe with the snubbed end like a drunken claw machine. I dropped it onto the bed robotically, my duvet swallowing it with a huff. I eased onto my bed for the second time this morning, my mind running thought experiments on how to avoid facing the day. I closed my eyes, clearing out the thoughts, my face tightening as my hands took initiative. They slipped my sock and shoe on expertly, my calloused foot somehow putting up less resistance than the rest of me. Maybe defeat started in the toes, gradually eating its way through you until it completely devours your willpower. It would make sense why I could barely feel my foot anymore. *Wonder how long until it's satisfied.*¬†



Maybe it already was.¬†



Tucking my crutch back under my arm, I shuffled toward the door, a backpack hung haphazardly on the handle. Propping my crutch for a moment, I tested the weight, reluctant to look inside. To my surprise ‚Äì and relief ‚Äì it was lighter than I anticipated today. *At least that means less traveling.* I took a hasty count of the faces within, remembering I had yet to apply one this morning. *Thirteen. Less than yesterday, still more than I‚Äôd like.* My fingers strummed through the assortment of faces, deciding on a younger woman‚Äôs face with modest makeup. I took my headband off, smoothed out the face overtop of my shadowy form (tucking in all of the sides and flattening out the creases), and replaced the headband through the newly sprouting auburn hair. After adjusting to the new skin, I ventured out to work. *Hopefully the Overnighters aren‚Äôt unbearable like yesterday.*

Shutting the door behind me, my phone immediately springs to life. ‚ÄúHello! Here‚Äôs what you missed:¬†

Groaning, I shifted more weight onto my crutch as I tossed my phone into the bag, eager to get the day over with. My hallway sounded especially terrible this morning; a mildew-petrichor cocktail burbled out of the damp floorboards like a geyser pit, black mold gnawing away at the ceiling tiles like a teething baby. The tiles wept milky white puddles in reply, the hallway ensemble belching out a disgusting hymn of rot. *Ah Tile, you old bag. You look like Mold‚Äôs breastfeeding mother, trapped in the symphony of filth. Cry now while you can, Little Mold! Add your voice to the choir!* Shuffling through the hall, fighting to keep my own voice from joining the performance, my hopes were silenced at the assault on my freshly plastered nose. Soupy and viscous, the combination of waterlogged floorboards and rot-infested walls inevitably forced dry heaves into the noise, bile coating my throat. *The crescendo, Little Mold! Listen! The serenade to a new day is here, and you‚Äôre all that‚Äôs left!* Collecting myself, my eyes stubbornly fighting back tears, I passed my office doors to reach my parlor, soulless and quiet. My parlor. Two rusted iron chairs and a wrought-iron table sat in solitude under a shoddy glass chandelier, with an equally shoddy kitchenette cowering in the far corner. A smudge-ridden black kettle, stale biscuits, and a mini fridge stood at attention as my eyes flicked over them contemplatively. *The essentials*. Just like the bedroom, where once lived an appreciable parlor existed a dilapidated husk. Though, despite the color fading from the baby blue kitchen tiles, pieces of decorative iron spouting from the chairs like bullet wounds, and light straining to pass through the algae green skylight, it did its job. Neglected and unthanked, it continued to serve, day after day. *I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre begging for a day off too, huh.*¬†



‚ÄúTea.‚Äù



The kitchenette yelped to life, burners hastily spouting ethereal blue flames in a frantic attempt to comply. Kettle, frothing at the spout, belched out waves of angry steam as the day-old tea within bubbled to life. Eyes taking inventory of the neglected sitting space, I gingerly tested one of the chairs, tucking the backpack into one of its wrought iron wounds. The chair creaked angrily, its metallic joints buckling lightly under the sudden weight. In retort, the bag nestled itself into the chair hole almost comfortably, the faces within shifting to accommodate. With cautious satisfaction, I sat my crutch sideways across the faded burlap, ornamenting myself in the neighboring chair. The arrangement looked like an awkward first date, my disheveled complexion scowling at the wood grain in drowsy indifference. My crutch acted more like an old, crotchety husband though; it creaked beside me wherever I went, long since accustomed to my bitching. I straightened my spine against the chair back, careful to avoid any thornlike iron sprouts. My search was interrupted by my screaming kettle, though, swelling to its grand finale. I acknowledge the kettle‚Äôs song, absentmindedly picking at the frays in my hair, a stray thorn pricking me in the back. Almost mockingly, my fingers whisked the air as I angrily fought to flatten the chair back behind me. In apprehension, the kettle floated silently toward the table, the shrill whistle gradually subsiding. Like a sleepwalker who‚Äôs been jolted awake, my kettle‚Äôs journey stopped with a clattering against the wrought iron tabletop, my ears wincing at the noise. I investigated the temperature with the back of my hand, a char black coffee mug resting sheepishly alongside the kettle, seemingly apologizing for the rough landing. *Guess I‚Äôm still not warmed up*. My fingers cracked, a haze of concentration enveloping me. The invisible force returned, hefting the kettle in unsure anticipation, my hand posed authoritatively. Tongue slipping from my mouth, I willed the kettle to pour, my hand guiding the kettle like a brush on a canvas. A canvas with a new, fresh tea stain on it. At least some made it into the cup. I sighed in resignation, my hand relieved the kettle of its duties, a stream of earthy sweat sliding down from its spout. *Maybe I was never warm, come to think of it.* My smirk reemerged, the unshaven beard on the other face unable to stop it this time. I allowed it to linger a moment, almost hoarding the sense of contentment for as long as I could. Just as quickly as it arrived, though, my body slipped back into the familiar sense of numbness once again.¬†

My body. A grime covered bag of flesh; nothing more than a shell for my shadowy black form. What that form is, I‚Äôve never known ‚Äì nor could anyone tell me. Living shadow, maybe? In any case, a body was more practical anyhow; it was heavier, sure, but what it lacked in dexterity was made up for in familiarity. I had decided long ago that the shadowy ‚Äúme‚Äù wasn‚Äôt what people needed, even if my poor facsimile of a body is unsightly to say the least. My bones suffocated around lithe muscle, wiry black body hair and a poor excuse for skin wrapping around them like paper mache. Even my ribs threatened to breach my torso if I breathed too deeply. Like a canary trapped in a boney cage, my chest rose and fell with wheezy chirps, my emaciated features allotting only what was absolutely necessary to still be considered ‚Äúbody‚Äù. I don‚Äôt remember when I started taking on a body, let alone preferring one. Just like my parlor, it ached, stretched, cracked, and even broke sometimes. But it did its job. Maybe that‚Äôs why I stopped taking it off at the end of the day; the monotony of constantly replacing my face felt herculean. Despite its fragile appearance, though, I rarely had to replace my body. Of all the decisions I made, my body never felt like one. Besides, what grotesque opinions my body reinforced were quelled by some fresh pressed clothes and an all-too-human face. Peering out from my thoughts, my ache-laced fingers ran over the rim of my mug aimlessly, smudges of dirt peeling off against its warmth. Sprouting from my calloused hands like weeds, I strained to remember the last time my fingers themselves had been replaced. Years? Decades? *They always end up the same way, though*. My cracked lips dragging me from my thoughts, pursing with indignance. I brought the mug up slowly, a fresh belch of hot steam erupting from the tea. Smooth, warm, earthy, satisfying; a good brew this time.¬†



*Now if only it would stay that way.*



As if to humble me, my leg muscles cramp suddenly, constricting my leg bones like a python. My eyes flew open in panic, muscles hungrily choking the life out of my femur. Mug crashing to the table, my tea jettisoned out in a wide arch, seeping into the splintered parlor floor. My skirt caught some of the tea, flattening itself like a safety net, while the bag and my crutch lay dry. My eyelids clamped shut, dulling my eyes‚Äô panic while my hands flew to my leg in a desperate plea to calm the muscular beast. The beast was unsatisfied, I decided, as it slipped its grip tighter. Massaging the folds of its coils, I coaxed it to release its boney prey. In the midst of fighting back a pained groan, my eyes bulged open as the muscles relaxed, the beast finally sated. A labored breath ripped loose from behind my clenched teeth, beads of sweat forming at my temples, the sudden frenzy already smudging bits of foundation. *Once again, remind me I dress up nicely at this point?* My thoughts never get a reply, try as they might. In childlike uncertainty, my mug righted itself behind the kettle, nervously waiting for its scolding. The scolding never came, though, as I craned my neck back in a long, defeated exhale. What I would give for a day off.¬†

I sat for a long moment, silence drifting into the parlor. The light from the ceiling now wandered about the parlor languidly, long shadows creeping up from the table like dogs begging for scraps. My hazy, tired eyes ignored their begging, glancing at my crutch-shaped spouse for any sign of acknowledgement. It never bothers to console me, though. *How rude.* I inspected the sad remains of my mug, a few surviving drops of tea staring back. My skirt matted against my thighs, more hydrated than my mug at this point, I calculated how long it would take me to hobble back and change. Maybe I could just restart the day; go back to bed, wake up fresh, brew a new batch of tea, and start the day on the right foot. I quickly rejected the idea wistfully; *It's not like I could wake up any other way*. Too annoyed to acknowledge my own joke, I let the wistfulness subside, pushing myself to stand with silent effort. The silence remained steadfast, desperately attempting to bring peace to the morning. Much to its dismay, though, I downed what little remained of my tea, my swallow cutting through its defenses.¬†



‚ÄúWell you weren‚Äôt much help were you,‚Äù I muttered, shooting another accusatory glance at my crutch.¬†



Silence.



I jabbed a knobby finger at him, half gesturing to my tea-soaked skirt. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you know, being dry and all. I probably don‚Äôt even have time to change befo‚Äì‚Äù



As if interrupting, affirming my assumption, the backpack buzzed in reply. My eyes downcast, I stretched awkwardly across the rusted tabletop, fishing my phone from the bag in solemn resignation. It yelped to life once more: ‚ÄúHello! Overnighters have been congregated. Would you like to continue?‚Äù *Could you at least try to be late for once?* The time blinked back at me in reply, a white ‚Äú0800‚Äù lighting up my face mockingly.¬†



‚ÄúYes,‚Äù I relented. *It's always too cheery*.¬†¬†



Silence.



‚ÄúOkay! One moment. . .‚Äù



Silence.



In a flash of light and dust, my office doors clattered open noisily, a fresh puff of air mingling with that of the stagnant hallway. *Time for work.* I clicked my lips in distaste, my crutch slipping comfortably into my left armpit in support, sleepiness returning to claw at me. With consternation, I trudged laboriously out of my parlor, the kettle and mug tidying themselves obediently. The now open set of double doors were all that separated my feeble attempt at relaxation from a miserable day, and my apprehension was palpable. Light poured into the hallway from my office‚Äôs maw, the interior seeming to swallow shadows before they could even escape. *An event horizon for shadows, and I‚Äôm the lucky bastard who‚Äôs shadows refuse to leave*. The backpack felt heavier now somehow, clinging to the small of my back alongside my sleepiness. I attempted to straighten my headband with my free hand, my auburn locks refusing to cooperate as I ventured into my office.¬†

My office. If my wardrobe was a sight for sore eyes, my office was a sight only a newborn‚Äôs eyes could handle. Or, well, maybe that‚Äôs just my jaded frustration talking. A long room with just the one set of doors and no windows, my office existed in a kind of liminal hell, polished hardwood floors spanning the ground like a decorative ballroom. An ostentatious chandelier dominated most of the ceiling, thousands of tiny glass-rimmed picture frames glittering like a gaudy ofrenda / disco ball. None of the frames had photos inside, though, sending unnatural shadows across my sleek oak walls. At the end of the floor, opposite the doors, stood my impossibly pristine desk. Wooden curlicues inlaid with golden trim danced across the front of the desk, coalescing into a large decorative ‚ÄúM‚Äù in the center. With hardly any ornamentation on top of it, it stood solemnly in front of an expansive bookshelf like a witness stand, waiting for another story to be laid bare. The shelf itself was dotted with an astronomical number of knickknacks, an eclectic mix of everything from wooden artist dolls to black wool sock puppets. Bits of dust clung to most of them, the books themselves tucked away behind them, silent and forgotten. I wondered when the last time any of them were even touched, let alone read. *Probably since the knickknacks started piling up, huh*.¬†

Forcibly satisfied with my hair, my hand relaxed gently, a figure already waiting for me at my desk. An older man, maybe sixties, turned sharply at my sudden entrance, a tuft of graying hair cupping the side of his gravel marked face. A lavender robe hung loosely around his plump frame, his matching slippers tapping a nervous hole into my office floor. His fraying wife beater spouted loose pieces of thread around the collar, bits of curly gray chest hair mingling with them. His most provocative feature, however, was a garish crimson blood splatter painted on his belly like a giant red balloon. Pieces of drying pink flesh clung to the cotton of his waistband, a steady stream of tar black blood tracing a line from his checkered boxers to his grass stained knees, finally pooling below him like swamp water. If below was the swamp, then his face was the ogre; liver spots marched across his pink forehead like ants, his hooked nose sporting thin red scuff marks. His only remaining eye twitching haphazardly like a hummingbird, purple bags underneath it contradicting his panicked alertness. Strips of yellowing flesh clung to the other eye‚Äôs socket like a party blower, the cave-like socket itself dripping milky pink fluid lazily onto the man‚Äôs bushy gray mustache. *Tch. They‚Äôre supposed to be more cleaned up than this*. Whatever. I‚Äôll just have to spend extra time between Overnighters, like always. What I would give for a day off.

Not sure if I should keep at it or look at moving to a new department after 1 year.

The head of department displays negative body language towards me - doesnt look at me in group settings when she's talking, not being as smiley or chatty to me in the coffee area compared to other colleagues, etc. In order to get promoted she has to advocate for me with the other department heads in the leadership team. for the most part people not liking me is something I can accept - not everyone will like you and that's life. but it's hard to shrug off when the person who doesnt like you can make or break your progression in the company. 

It's a shame because I get on with everyone else in the department, and my manager likes me a lot, and i love the work i do. I socialise with them outside of work and we have a jolly time and i have integrated very well into the team. I'm being given high visibility and impact projects, which align with my personal development goals, hence why I'm trying to see if my department head not liking me is the end of the world for my progression or not because I'd like to stay.

I know she is not a spiteful or horrible person, and she really tries to see the best in everyone from my observation. but maybe this is me being too optimistic and my chances of being promoted are not there and I need to leave if I want to move up.

Here is a long-time lurker, first time poster. Before anything else ‚Äì million thanks to this sub. I learnt a huge lot from the folks here.¬†

My numbers on 14 Nov (just over a month back): **Total cholesterol 267 HDL 64 LDL 181 TG 108**¬†

And yesterday: **Total cholesterol 191 HDL 53 LDL 133 TG 76**

For whatever it is worth, here is what I did:

I wasn‚Äôt obsessive about measuring fat, carbs, protein etc. though I was careful with what I ate, and I completely cleaned up my diet. Zero red meat though I did eat chicken and fish (even pan-fried salmon a few times). Zero added sugar ‚Äì no desserts, not even in tea or coffee. No processed food. No junk food. I didn‚Äôt stop dairy though ‚Äì had regular milk in my oat porridge and muesli with yoghurt. I also ate butter and cheese, but in moderation. I added lots of fresh vegetables, and fruits to my diet ‚Äì especially bananas. Also, apples, pears and blueberries in my oats for breakfast.¬†¬†¬†

As soon as I woke up, I had psyllium husk ‚Äì one tablespoon in a glass of water and washed it down with another glass of water. I repeated the psyllium husk routine (one tablespoon again) in the evening at 1700 or so to keep a separation of 2 h from meals / supplements.¬†

About an hour or so after (in the morning), I had 2-3 walnuts, 7 almonds, one Brazil nut (all of which I had soaked the night before) and one fig. Sometimes I had these with breakfast ‚Äì I wasn‚Äôt too regimented.

For breakfast, I had oats 2-3 times per week with about 350 ml milk (2.5% fat) and blueberries. I ate eggs but no yolks on other days with two slices of whole grain bread, wee bit of butter. 

These were my supplements:

Multivitamins ‚Äì morning¬†

Omega 3 ‚Äì morning and evening¬†

Magnesium ‚Äì morning and evening

Vitamin D3 + K2 ‚Äì morning¬†

Vitamin C ‚Äì morning¬†

Folate‚Äì morning¬†

B1 ‚Äì morning and evening

Btw, my doctor had recommended 20 mg statin when my results came out last month.¬†

I don‚Äôt know why I came here to this sub after that. In fact, because I am not a Redditor as such, I realized just before posting this that I couldn‚Äôt change my last user name (weird auto generated) so I deleted that profile and made a new one.

Thanks again, people!

P.S. I also feel better, hugely better with no sugar as such and on this somewhat healthy diet. And funnily enough, I didn‚Äôt feel like drinking tea or coffee ‚Äì I mean I would just forget about it whilst earlier, I was utterly dysfunctional without beverages.¬†

1hhvnmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookMarketplace/comments/1hhvnmn/i_walked_into_a_fiasco_and_no_turning_back/,I walked into a fiasco and no turning back!,"I spotted some beautiful wood-like tiles for sale on Marketplace and reached out to the seller to arrange a pickup after work. When I arrived at the house, I was greeted by the sight of four police vehicles parked out front. My first instinct was to turn around and leave, but before I could, a police officer approached me and asked why I was there. I explained that I was just there to pick up some tiles I‚Äôd found on Marketplace and added that maybe I should just leave. üò±

To my surprise, she told me to hold on, reassured me, and went to the house. A moment later, she came back and said it was fine for me to go in and not to worry. üò± Nervously, I stepped inside, only to find even more police officers in the house.

The seller spotted me and immediately said, ‚ÄúOh, you‚Äôre here for the tiles! Let me show you where they are.‚Äù He led me to the basement, and I started loading the tiles into my car while he stayed behind, giving some kind of statement to the police.

By the time I finished loading, I noticed the police had finally left. What an unexpected situation!

Curious about what had happened, I asked the seller. He explained that a buyer had come by to check out an item, so he took them downstairs to show it. He suspected that the buyer was working with someone else who stayed upstairs and stole $6,000 in cash, credit cards, and important documents from the coffee table.

I felt terrible for him and couldn‚Äôt help but wonder how I had gotten caught up in such a mess. I thought about how this incident might make him distrust buyers forever. Feeling sorry for his situation, I ended up paying him more than his asking price for the tiles. I also asked him to share the buyer‚Äôs information with me so I could look into it further. Suddenly, I found myself deeply involved in this fiasco.

When I got home, I messaged him and asked if he had scheduled another buyer who never showed up. He confirmed that someone else had been set to arrive around the same time but hadn‚Äôt responded since. I pointed out that it seemed likely this second person had come while he was downstairs and stolen the items.

An hour later, he messaged me back with a surprising update: he had found everything in the pocket of his other pants! What a fiasco!

TLDR: 8 months ago, my FWB (45M) changed his dating policy, and instead of being absolutely committed to maintain sexually open relationships, he's now willing to date monogamous women who will require him to be sexually exclusive.

QUESTION: Does it make sense for me (42F) to end the the ""benefits"" part of this under those circumstances?


RAMBLING:
When we first started seeing each other (over a year ago), we were on the same page with monogamy vs nonmonogamy.

We both see sex as its own fun recreational activity. Zero impact on other romantic relationships. Best FWB ever!! The benefits here are üî• and the friendship is casual but also deeply rooted in respect and admiration.

Now that he's changed his policy though...

Every time he gets involved with someone and it looks promising, he lets me know, and then I have to face down impending loss of the sex we both enjoy so much. I've been trying to maintain an attitude of ""we'll cross that bridge when we get to it,"" but at this point I've decided it's just not sustainable.

He tells his potential partners about me (and his other FWB) right out the gate, and lets them know that he's not going to cut us out of his life. We're friends. That isn't going to change. But he would totally be willing to be monogamous if he fell in love with someone. 

The things is... As much as I deeply admire and frankly love this guy -- 90% of our time together is spent in bed, y'all. And 90% of the texting is just logistics of when to see each other next. It's almost more of a ""bootie call with friendship benefits."" üòÇ 

Losing the sex with him would be a pretty huge change, both for that friendship and for my whole life, really. He's one of 3 people I have sex with, and the sex with him specifically has been extremely therapeutic.

I think my new boundary needs to be ""I am only sexually involved with people who are very firmly nonmonogamous.""

Is that a reasonable boundary?
Am I insane (or AITA?) for ending benefits when the sexual compatibility is off the charts? 

Like for reals, sex with him has been life changing, lmao. I've never had a partner like this. And I know it's been amazing for him too. Very win win connection for us both. 

Unrelated but related: 
We're grabbing coffee today, and I intend to let him know my new boundary, and I fully expect it's going to be basically a very cordial, respectful breakup. A ""thank you so much much, I'll never forget you, and have a wonderful life"" conversation.

I've been planning this for weeks. It's just taken a while for schedules to sync up.

But. 
My therapist just last night diagnosed me with BPD, so now I'm questioning evvvvvverything.

One of the classic BPD moves is to end healthy relationships. 

Is that what I'm doing????????

My bf and I will be travelling to Tokyo in late February/early March. We are 30 and it's my first time, but his fourth, if that matters. We know as long as we're near a train, we'll get by fine. We aren't social butterflies, but we would don't mind being in livelier areas to people watch and soak up the energy.

1hhvfia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1hhvfia/need_some_advice_regarding_water_drip_and_serving/,Need some advice regarding water drip and serving mug,"I recently got my first Aeropess and so far, I'm loving it. For the first time ever, I'm making espresso-like coffee at home that tastes so good I've finally weaned off adding sugar to it.

But I have a little issue I'm not sure how to fix:

I like to drink my espresso in a small cup, similar in size to [these ones](https://asassyspoon.com/wp-content/uploads/cafe-cubano-cuban-coffee-recipe-a-sassy-spoon-4.jpg). Which means I can't directly brew into them, as they're not wide enough for the Aeropress to fit in.

So I was previously using a traditional ""breakfast"" mug (something like [this](https://www.printyo.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Coffee-Tea-Mug-YOUR-DESIGN-HERE.jpg)). But I had the issue that the round, wide border made it a bit messy to later pour the coffee into the smaller cups, often dripping some coffee through the sides or splashing it too fast.

To solve this, I got a glass cup similar to [this one](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61q-0G6d8ML.jpg), with a small opening that makes it perfect for serving. It also doubles as a nice measurement glass to dose my water amounts before heating them, which is great. And being transparent I also get the see the cofee brewing in real time, which is also very nice :)

However, as soon as I started using this, I found *another* issue. Water was dripping onto the glass *immediately* when pouring it into the Aeropress. I'm talking 80-90% of the water being completely gone *before* I even star stirring, let alone start pressing. I tried to pull up the plunger as soon as I finish stirring, but by that time most of the water is already gone.

Now, I have no idea if this was also happening with the regular ceramic mug, as it wasn't transparent. But my feeling is that regular mugs (without any serving cutouts) create a loose seal that, while not hermetic, probably helps keep the water in place just long enough. With this design, however, there's zero seal, and I'm assuming that's the reason why all the water immediately drips down?

Anyway, I started using the inverted method to prevent this, and sure enough things improved dramatically when done properly. For the first time, I was getting delicious espresso-like coffee at home. The problem? I needed to be *extremely* quick when pressing, because as soon as I flip the Aeropress over, all the water flows down again.

Reading up a bit more, I found out about the Fellow Prismo and thought it would finally solve all my problems, letting me produce the same kind of espresso-like coffee without any of the stressa. So that was another 35‚Ç¨ I spent :D

Well, I started using it today, and the results have been... underwhelming. Sure, almost no water drips down prematurely anymore. But some ground coffee actually does get through the metallic filter, leaving a considerable residue at the bottom. More importantly, the coffee brews quite differently now. With the regular cap and paper filters I was getting this nice ""faux cream"" (more like a foam), that gave the cup a great feel. And coffee just tasted great. Now that ""cream"" is pretty much gone, and the coffee tastes less like an espresso and more like what I'd get out of a Moka pot or similar.

I also tried replacing the metallic filter with a paper one, and that was... fun :D It was almost impossible to press down at first, and when I eventually did, some coffee started shooting up and out of the Aeropress lol. The result wasn't much better either way, although it did avoid most of the residue that was going through with the metallic filter.

So my question is... how would you solve this? Should I just give up with the glass mug and use a regular one? Would one of those ""small mug adapters"" actually produce enough of a seal to prevent water drip, assuming that's even the reason? Or can I somehow improve the process using the Fellow Prismo?

1hhveb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/breakingmom/comments/1hhveb6/update_late_pregnancy_betrayal/,Update: Late Pregnancy Betrayal,"I posted about a week ago regarding my wife's (mtf) porn addiction and was feeling really in crisis about everything. I'm certain we aren't finished with the issue, but this is the first time (since the first time porn was brought up, anyway) that I feel like she's actually taking me seriously and hearing me. It took a while to get there. She actually ended up choosing to loop her parents in on the conversation. So here's where we're at now: 

She has a blocker app on her phone, still needs to be set up on her iPad and laptop, in the meantime she isn't bringing those devices out of the living room. Histories have been cleared and accounts used for porn deleted. She does have an old laptop she wants to recover the hard drive from, which has her music (the reason for recovering) and she let me know there's...a sizeable amount (from before we met) of adult content that will need to be wiped when she recovers the music. 

She reached out to a therapist who works with neurodivergence, queers, and behavioral addiction. She has so far verified availability for new patients and insurance coverage, but can't get in until January. This is acceptable effort on this front imo. 

She attended a local sex addicts anonymous meeting, and she came home from it and immediately said ""I...I belong there."" Which was hugely reassuring to me that it's not me fighting her anymore, she's on the same page with me. 

She agreed to no masturbation for at least a week, and then we'd check in. Due to HRT, she does have some concern in maintaining size and function if completely unused for a period like the 6 weeks after birth, that all seems valid to me if it can be handled without porn. We also agreed that ""there are different levels of screwing up here"" and that if she needs to get off, doing it without porn is less of a problem. There was a quote from a porn recovery forum that said ""if you're not horny enough to get there without porn, you're not actually horny"" and that seems to have resonated with her. 

She's working on breaking her associations with screentime in general, including having a novel on the back of the toilet instead of bringing her phone, not bringing her phone in to my appointments or kiddo's events, and setting up music/podcast for a shower on the speaker and leaving her phone outside the bathroom. She's also limiting her gaming time to the late nights when she otherwise ended up searching porn, which means that she's more invested in household life the rest of the day. 

We have not taken intimacy between us off the table, but I was clear that her recent methods of ""get hard and stick it in"" are...lacking. And again, I think she heard me. Last night I (ftm) got the best head I've ever gotten and she didn't even take her clothes off, it was just for me. She sees that the novelty she was getting from porn is novelty I just...wasn't getting. It also seems like her statement of sex with a partner being ""more work"" is quickly fading as her reward centers rewrite the way they've operated for a decade or more; yeah, there's more physical movement involved but there's also more reward with a partner. 

Again, I'm sure we aren't completely out of the woods yet, but I see actual effort there. I feel respected and heard finally. I do see her choosing her priorities now, and that is so reassuring. 

In other news, I no longer have to be supervised for parenting time of my 7 year old. Mediation was Tuesday and took 6 hours, but my boy got to come back to my home afterward so it was all worth it. There's still hurdles back to 50/50, but progress is happening. 

...aaaand, with those two situations feeling slightly resolved, I was 2cm dilated at my 36 week checkup yesterday. Baby girl was measuring at 5.8lbs at 34 weeks, and by all accounts seems strong and healthy enough to make her debut any time now. I've been bouncing on the yoga ball, and suddenly had a HUGE appetite yesterday. We also got a snowstorm and ik weather changes can bring on labor. I'm all sorts of physically uncomfortable, but the emotional stuff is less stressful than it's been...all pregnancy it seems (custody battle started when I was 11 weeks). 

I have another legal issue going on, regarding a broken hand from several years ago, that may be wrapping up with a settlement in the coming months. For a couple of months, we had been *also* preparing for me to need a second surgery on that hand as scans and manual assessment looked like it might be still broken, but the last MRI concluded that it is healed as well as can be expected. So, upside, no more surgeries and quicker resolution to that suit. Downside, the lingering pain is going to keep lingering. It does mean we can move onto my other surgeries (hemorrhoid repair, hernia repair, hysterectomy, yeet the teats, etc) a bit quicker, but I was hoping there was an answer to the pain and lack of function in my hand.

Oof, holy shit that's a lot. I'm gonna have some coffee and a brownie and bounce on the ball while I watch the snow come down. Anyone else is welcome to have a drink for me cause, damn, I could use a few. ",0,1734622200.0,breakingmom,1,0.5,False

This is where I read, workout, listen to music, drink coffee (or beer), and generally relax. It's actually just adjacent to our couch and TV in the basement so even if I'm working out I can watch TV with my wife. Directly behind is the playroom. So it's my space but still a family area. The recliner is also where me and the little guy cuddle and read stories every morning before breakfast.

Hopefully you have spot to go to. Whether it be a full blown dad room, or just a corner of a wall that you jam yourself in to take a breath.

What does your spot look like?

Happy holidays, dads. Have a recline and a beer. Y'all earned it.

I'm yet again amazed at the treatment aimed at a HGV driver.

Christmas lights blinked from neighbouring windows, but Ben's apartment remained understated. A single candle flickered on his coffee table, casting shadows across his collection of records and minimalist furniture.

He had never been one for over-the-top festivities, but he couldn‚Äôt say no to the invite from his closest friends. ""Just a small gathering,"" Ellen had promised. ""Good food, some drinks, and a few presents. Nothing wild.""

By the time he arrived, the apartment was buzzing with warmth and laughter. Ellen, armed with a Santa hat and a glass of mulled wine, greeted him with a teasing grin. ""Ben! Finally, someone who might bring some brooding techno energy to this overly cheerful scene.""

Ben smirked. ""I'll try not to ruin the mood.""

The evening unfolded with good cheer and occasional jabs at Ben‚Äôs reputation for stoicism. They exchanged presents as the scent of pine and cinnamon filled the air. Finally, Ellen handed him a brightly wrapped box.

""This one‚Äôs from all of us,"" she said, barely containing her grin.

Ben took the box with a nod, unwrapping it carefully. Beneath the layers of wrapping paper lay an ornate, vintage-style clock. Its face gleamed, with intricate hands ticking rhythmically.

The room erupted into laughter. ""Get it? Ben Klock gets a clock!"" someone called out, doubling over.

Ben stared at the clock, expressionless. The laughter grew louder, infectious, until the whole room was in stitches.

He looked up, his trademark deadpan intact. ""Hilarious,"" he said, voice dry enough to rival the Sahara.

Ellen wiped tears from her eyes. ""Come on, Ben! You‚Äôve got to admit it‚Äôs a good pun.""

""It‚Äôs a predictable pun,"" he retorted, placing the clock on the coffee table. ""And it‚Äôs going to tick loudly. I‚Äôll probably end up sampling it.""

This only made everyone laugh harder. One of his friends mimed DJing. ""And now, the sound of the Klock-clock in a minimal techno set!""

Ben rolled his eyes but couldn‚Äôt entirely suppress the faintest twitch of a smile. The truth was, he found their amusement endearing, even if he would never let on.

By the end of the night, as he slipped the clock under his arm and walked home through the snow-dusted streets, Ben found himself listening to the steady ticking.

""Predictable,"" he muttered, though his lips quirked up ever so slightly.

Maybe, just maybe, it *had* been a good pun. But he wasn‚Äôt about to let them know that.",1,1734621893.0,BenKlockFanFiction,0,1.0,False

‚Äè	4.	I didn‚Äôt follow the ‚Äú1st read, 2nd read‚Äù approach. In fact, I skipped conventional methods for some systems' revision entirely.

‚ÄèI‚Äôll divide my experience into sections for easy reading:
‚Äè	1.	Resources
‚Äè	2.	Preparation period
‚Äè	3.	Dedicated study period
‚Äè	4.	Exam day
‚Äè	5.	Mistakes I made
‚Äè	6.	General advice

‚Äè1. Resources

‚ÄèHere‚Äôs how I used the resources during preparation:
‚Äè	1.	UWorld
‚ÄèThe most important resource, and my primary one. I treated it as a book written in Q&A format.
‚Äè	2.	Pathoma
‚ÄèThe only video lectures I used during my prep.
‚Äè	3.	Sketchy Micro & Pharm
‚ÄèThe best resource for memorizing content-heavy material like microbiology and pharmacology.
‚Äè	4.	Dr. Osama‚Äôs Biostatistics Videos
‚ÄèThe best biostats resource, even better than Randy Neil‚Äôs videos after trying both. His approach made understanding the formulas and concepts very simple.
‚Äè	5.	Dirty Medicine
‚ÄèVery useful for challenging systems like biochemistry and ethics.
‚Äè	6.	Mehlman Medical Material
‚ÄèAvailable as PDFs and YouTube playlists, it‚Äôs the best substitute for First Aid, with clearer and exam-relevant explanations.
‚Äè	7.	Anki
‚ÄèI used several decks and shared my method in this post: link.

‚Äè2. Preparation Period

‚ÄèMy prep lasted about 5 months. My daily routine was divided into 3 parts:
‚Äè	‚Ä¢	Anki (100‚Äì150 cards daily, reviewed first thing in the morning).
‚Äè	‚Ä¢	UWorld (30‚Äì40 questions daily, thoroughly studying the explanations).
‚Äè	‚Ä¢	Pathoma or Mehlman (1 hour of Pathoma or 15 pages of Mehlman daily).

‚ÄèI followed this routine consistently until I completed UWorld.

‚Äè3. Dedicated Study Period

‚ÄèAfter finishing UWorld, I took my first NBME and scored 74%.
‚ÄèI booked my exam for November‚ÄìJanuary. I took one NBME weekly.

‚ÄèI mimicked real exam conditions: starting at 9 AM, following the same break times, and eating the same snacks during breaks.
‚ÄèI avoided checking my block scores until the entire exam was done to simulate the stress of the real exam.

‚ÄèBetween exams, I:
‚Äè	‚Ä¢	Reviewed mistakes system by system.
‚Äè	‚Ä¢	Focused on my weakest systems using Mehlman PDFs and related YouTube playlists.
‚Äè	‚Ä¢	Reviewed NBME questions (correct and incorrect) to understand concepts thoroughly.

‚ÄèBy the fourth NBME, I began reviewing 100 random questions daily for quick concept reinforcement.
‚ÄèSatisfied with my scores, I scheduled my exam for December 3rd.

‚Äè4. Exam Day

‚ÄèThe day before the exam, I didn‚Äôt study at all to stay relaxed and fresh. I went to bed early.

‚ÄèI arrived at the test center by 7:15 AM, with:
‚Äè	‚Ä¢	Protein bars
‚Äè	‚Ä¢	Coffee
‚Äè	‚Ä¢	Nuts
‚Äè	‚Ä¢	Water
‚Äè	‚Ä¢	A watch for break timing
‚Äè	‚Ä¢	Passport and permit

‚ÄèI started at 9:10 AM, solving 2 blocks at a time.

‚ÄèThe questions seemed long but were manageable (4 lines on UWorld equaled 2 in the actual exam).

‚ÄèThe exam felt different‚Äîneither NBME nor UWorld but a strange mix of everything I studied. Many questions required elimination and felt stressful, but thankfully, it worked out.

‚ÄèI finished each block with 3‚Äì4 minutes to spare, which I added to my break time.
‚ÄèI marked many questions to review later, allowing me to focus on tougher ones after finishing the rest.

‚ÄèI left the exam unsure of how it went, convinced I might fail because of the odd questions.

‚Äè5. Mistakes I Made
‚Äè	1.	Starting with an Arabic course
‚ÄèI underestimated myself and wasted a month on an approach that didn‚Äôt suit me. I realized most of the exam content was familiar from med school and that independent study was faster.
‚Äè	2.	Using Anking initially
‚ÄèThe deck has ~38,000 cards (18,000 for Step 1). I ended up reviewing 800+ cards daily, burning out completely within two weeks.
‚Äè	3.	Trying Boards & Beyond
‚ÄèIts teaching style didn‚Äôt click with me, so I focused on questions instead.
‚Äè	4.	Using First Aid
‚ÄèI only read two systems. Its information felt disorganized and abstract compared to Mehlman, which was more exam-focused.

‚Äè6. General Advice
‚Äè	1.	Don‚Äôt wait for a study partner.
‚ÄèStudy at your own pace; partners tend to slow down to the pace of the slowest member.
‚Äè	2.	Have a mentor.
‚ÄèA mentor ahead of you in the process is essential for guidance. This could be a friend who has passed or a professional mentoring service.
‚Äè	3.	Join a study group.
‚ÄèIt‚Äôs helpful to have a community to ask questions and share experiences.
‚Äè	4.	Set a minimum daily goal.
‚ÄèConsistency is key. For example, commit to solving 10 questions and reviewing 5 pages daily.
‚Äè	5.	Take breaks.
‚ÄèSchedule 1‚Äì2 days off weekly to recharge and avoid burnout.

‚ÄèFinally, I hope my detailed journey helps others. Best of luck to everyone preparing for their exams‚Äîmay you achieve all your goals!",3,1734621760.0,step1,0,1.0,False

That trainee doctors in the UK have to undergo 'basic training' in a hospital first, doing things like: working as a hospital porter, serving tea and water to patients, elementary nursing duties (e.g. cleaning dirty patients), getting coffee for staff, cleaning floors - let's say for a period of 3 months. So a bit similar to what some medical students do already to bolster their personal statements, but standardised and required for _all_ student doctors ahead of medical school, or as the start of the course.

The rationale would be to try and tackle some of the elitism and snobbery that can be found in some doctors, and to ensure all hospital staff have a common understanding of the basic roles and responsibilities. If all student doctors first completed a period of doing basic and sometimes unpleasant, difficult jobs - then perhaps this would lay a healthy foundation for a greater appreciation of the NHS's workforce?",0,1734621004.0,ukpolitics,14,0.27,False

Turns Out We‚Äôre The Slackers Of The Universe.,"Steve‚Äôs morning had been normal. Right up until the universe demanded a meeting. One second, he was debating if oat milk was worth the hype, the next, he was in a swirling cosmic void with a glowing, tentacled figure staring him down.

Steve blinked. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a cycle? A day? A billion years?‚Äù

‚ÄúLayoffs?‚Äù

‚ÄúCosmic downsizing,‚Äù the Lord said, shrugging. Which was unnerving given that he didn‚Äôt have shoulders. ‚ÄúTrust me, Steve, you don‚Äôt want details.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, but why is conquering the galaxy our goal?‚Äù Steve asked. ‚ÄúMaybe humans are meant to focus on, I don‚Äôt know, art and philosophy. We‚Äôre like, the *vibe species.*‚Äù

(I dont know why he has to stick his nose everywhere).And then after that he vented to her best friend how we treated each other that night.

Ok, so yesterday we went out together and i have this girl on college we are on project together with 1 more friend of us that is a male, he is her cousin and this girl is in a relationship for 7 years and after i told her yesterday taht we were all on a coffee together because we had to discuss and work some things about the project she told me ""Oh i could go on a coffee with him also if i knew u are going with her"".

And im like i really am not going with this girl because i want to its because i need to lol, then i told her i wasnt alone with her , she told me i would not be alone with him either ;)

After that she told me she will invite him to her birthday after she told me a month ago ""I wont call him, i dont need him on my birthday""

Last week she told him he is not invited and yesterday she tells me i am the reason she didnt want to call him on her birthday. She told me on summer before we were together that she found out that he likes her very much.

2 weeks ago she made a group for her birthday and he was in there and he was not invited and im like why is he there? She told me a friend asked her to invite him because he wants to check the discussion inside and wants to see what this guy and girl are typing about.. ?

1hhuksk,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1hhuksk/is_it_bad_i_want_to_cut_off_everyone_who_is/,is it bad i want to cut off everyone who is friends with my ex-best friend? ,"Hey y'all! I (22f) recently cut off my friend of 2 years (21f). I have a really hard time setting boundaries for myself especially with friends, and this is the first person I have ever cut off. We met through a mutual friend (who ended up being an awful person) and ended up getting super close over the course of a year. She was having some issues with her old roommates so I invited her to move in with me and another friend of mine. It's so true what they say about never moving in with friends but I'm glad I did because I got to see what kind of person she actually was. 

Again, it's super hard for me to set boundaries for myself. However, she was such a terrible roommate that I had no choice but to learn. She had her moving boxes and stuff in the living room for ages after we moved in. Like...months. She would order food all of the time and either leave it out on the counter/coffee table for me and my partner to throw out or leave it in the fridge for months until I realized it smelled terrible in there and clean out all the take out boxes she had accumulated. I talked to her multiple times about this issue. I tried to be as compassionate as possible because I knew she was going through something. But the issue never resolved itself. I would take out a bag of trash every 3 days that was mostly her take out boxes. My other roommate was never there due to their work schedule so a lot of the time it was just me and her. I cleaned the house and took out the trash before leaving for a weekend only to come back and see two more trashbags full of trash on the floor in the kitchen and the sink overflowing with dishes. I broke down in a way I hadn't in a while in front of her, her partner, and my roommate. She also had a cat who she forgot to feed consistently and would be very aggressive towards my cat. She rarely cleaned its litterbox and when she would feed it, she would put the cat food on a dinner plate on a floor in the middle of the living room. And then leave it there for me to pick up. 

She would also make super hurtful jokes frequently(which she would seem very apologetic about once I confronted her about them). When I sent her the message to cut her off, that was one of the things that I mentioned that really meant we could not be friends anymore. She snapped at me at the time and told me that they were just jokes and that she did not mean them in a hurtful way. I may have let it slide if it was just one or two but they were so many. She also enjoyed making fun of me in front of other people. Primarily, my friends who I introduced her to. 

After we moved out, I let her know I would need some space. I could not handle how negatively I felt about her at all. I felt like I was being consumed with resentment and it felt awful especially because I still loved her. She did not take that very well and after giving me maybe less than a month of space she texted me asking what she had done wrong. I had spent the entire year we lived together talking to her about everything she was doing that really upset me and she apologized for everything at the time it was brought up. But as soon as we moved out none of those moments happened and I had to rehash all the reasons why I struggled last year. I was working two jobs and cleaning up after her all the time and then on top of that, she would hurt my feelings with dumb jokes no one thought were funny. 

A lot of my friends stopped wanting to hang out with her after everything went down but I still have a couple friends who see her frequently. Is it selfish of me to not want to be around them? One of my friends told me that they could never be friends with someone who did all of that to me, so I now feel like there is a conflict of interest. She would talk a lot behind my back to my friends who would then tell me about everything she said WHILE we were still friends. Again, these are people I introduced to her--most of them are people I work with. 

I want to be the type of person to wish her well and forget about it, but after everything that she put me through and the more I think and talk about it all, the less I do(wish her well). It's been a few months since I moved out but I still need to rant about everything every so often. This entire situation still makes me so upset and I don't know if it's selfish of me to stop talking to people who are friends with her. 

TL/DR: Best friend I moved in with a year ago made my lease with her a living hell. Our friendship fell apart because of it. Am I in the wrong to want to cut out any friends I have who are still friends with her?",4,1734619965.0,lostafriend,2,1.0,False

I landed on the Bambino Plus and thought I was all set on the grinder with my Baratza Encore. After that mistake and some reading I realized the Encore is excellent at everything except espresso! Oops! Cue the conversation to wife about how our grinder isn't cutting it. Ba dum tiss. (And now DF64 Gen 2 is on the way!) I'll see myself out. 

I bought some Eight O Clock Dark Italian Roast espresso beans from Walmart with a best by date of October 2025! Oh yeah! (And now found a local roaster right up the street!)

I've experimented over the last few days with the Baratza Encore, and all 4 provided filter baskets (single, double, pressurized, non-pressurized), knowing I'd be limited.

After a bunch of testing I am using the double shot non-pressurized filter basket on a grind setting 1 or 2 (not sure if the Baratza Encore starts at 0 or at 1).

Process: Grind. Fill portafilter from grinder bin. Honestly I find the hardest part is getting the grinds into the portafilter as it's totally full. Hand tamp with included tamper. I run 1 blank shot to purge water. Then run the double shot.

Results: 16g in, 33g out, 30 seconds from the time I hit the double shot button to the time I hear the valve close and process is finished. Pre-infusion lasts approx 10 sec from button press to first drip, the Bambino+ says 8-12 sec pre-infusion is good.

Improvements on the way: WDT tool incase I need it. Replace Bamino+ tamper with the Normcore V4 tamper. DF64 Gen 2 ordered. Will source local fresh beans.

I think I've tasted sour and bitter shots and am now in between and limited by my grinder and beans. I can't wait to get the new grinder and some locally roasted fresh beans!

Am I in the ballpark on my results? From what I've read it's highly debatable about starting time from button press versus first drip so that's throwing me off not knowing if my 30 sec is good including the 10 sec pre infusion, or if I should be hitting 38-42 sec including the Bambinos recommended 8-12 sec pre infusion.

So am new to specialty beans. Been fiddling around with pourover techniques equipment for few months after a year of just doing chemex and using a specific grinder (when I could be bothered). 
Now that I've invested into the coffee pour over more with equipment and playing around see how I liked it next step was beans.

Am not going to name the merchant, but I ordered from a particular merchant  and yes they're abroad from where I am. I ordered on the Nov 29/30th, and it was dispatched on 3rd Dec. I was told it should come a week later from dispatch date, however am still awaiting delivery. Tracking they gave is absolute Bullcrap and they're pretty much not really want to help or compensate for it and just stating you got the tracking and xyz. 

I queried about the freshness n peak period of these beans now surely be overdue and I was met with response of ""oh don't worry they'll be great you'll enjoy"" and was dismissed on any ideas. 

Having been reading this forum for months and especially on resting/peak period/storage blabla the lot, what should I be expecting whenever these beans if they ever do turn up. considering hypothetically let's say it was roasted on 1/2nd Dec that's literally 18/19 days now its been ""in transit"" wouldn't they have lost their peak/optimum performance. Considering that they probably just in some any cardboard box or packet or whatever what should I do or expect etc from this?

I feel like am just being put into a corner and just told to shut-up and accept it from merchant but as a first time customer have to say am not totally happy or satisfied.

First of first, build free simple sites to build a portfolio, like institutional/one-page sites. This can help some guys that are starting like me, and get a little income. How do I get a little income from making a free site? I build the site, host to people see and use, and if they like the result they pay a host fee/manutention. I think something between 20 to 25 bucks to cover the expenses for hosting, and maybe a mug of coffee to me.

Then, if it works, charge the new customers to build the sites, make bigger projects, and offer other tech services.

And you know what really grinds my gears? The utter lack of communication! Not a peep from the Clash of Clans team - no updates, no apologies, nothing. Just radio silence while we're all sitting here like a bunch of lemmings, waiting for them to get their act together.

Well let me tell you something, you corporate shills - we, the players, deserve better! We're the ones pouring our blood, sweat, and hard-earned cash into your little mobile empire, and this is the thanks we get? Unacceptable!

Alright, alright, I'm getting a little heated here. But you know what, I'm just speaking the truth that everyone's thinking. These servers need to get their shit together, and they need to do it fast. Otherwise, I'm gonna lead a good old-fashioned digital riot - and trust me, you do not want to be on the receiving end of that.

So let's make some noise, people! Flood their social media, bombard their forums, let 'em know that we won't stand for this kind of shoddy service. Together, we can show these corporate clowns that we're the ones in charge here. Who's with me?!",0,1734619536.0,ClashOfClans,21,0.17,False

Ive found that now, I don‚Äôt want to leave the house at all. Before work is non existent as I wake up when I log in. After work I dread getting dressed and heading out so I just‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt. Then at the weekend I want to stay home and get the house ready for a week ahead. 

Im obviously low on the usual vitamins. But Im more worried why I don‚Äôt want to go outside. Iv always been one to love a good pyjama day, lazy day sort of thing. But a lazy few years inside is taking the piss and I dont want the world to pass me by. Iv just got no motivation to go outside anymore. 

Anyone else?

EDIT: this is my first post so I should have probably given more context. Sorry about that. Thank you for all the support, seeing people in the same boat, some love it, some hate it, is really helping. 

I do have 2 dogs, theyre my whole life, they hate the outside as much as I do, but my wonderful, supportive and caring partner walks them a lot. I join when I feel up to it. 

I dont drive, and live in a place Ive never been before, I only know my partner and her family. 

I live behind a big shopping centre, so I usually go there a few times a month to window shop, sit in for a coffee, stuff like that. Usually on my own which I dont mind. 
I dont have a good relationship with my family so I wouldnt call it socialising the few times a year I meet up with them. However, my partners family are nothing short of magical and although id love to see them more, I am trying bit by bit to build a relationship with them, I was a bit distant due to experience with my own family. 

I am most definitely depressed, and struggle with things that align with that. Would that really effect my ability to just get up and go for a walk?

Repentance is essential in developing a healthy relationship between you and anyone else. I‚Äôm thinking about my husband and me. If there was no repentance, no apology, no steps taken to right a wrong, then our marriage would be an unhappy one.

The same is true in our relationship with God. The difference is that in a marriage, we both need to repent. However, with God, he has nothing from which to repent. He loves you with a love greater than we can experience from anyone else. He longs for you to repent so he can bless you even more than he already has.

It is through repentance that we can reach reconciliation and restoration. In Acts 3:19, the apostle Peter tells us, ""Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord.""

I know there are times I‚Äôve had to sincerely apologize to someone I‚Äôve hurt. Usually, I‚Äôve experienced forgiveness and we moved past my offensive behavior or words. But there have been other times that I was not forgiven.

I recall a man who took offense at something I said or did. He wouldn‚Äôt tell me what it was and I really had no idea. I was a waitress and he was a regular customer and my mom‚Äôs boss. He wouldn‚Äôt talk with me or sit in my section. I couldn‚Äôt even serve him a cup of coffee. I apologized, but he wouldn‚Äôt accept my apology. That was almost 60 years ago. Even though I moved on, I‚Äôve never forgotten the unresolved problem.

I‚Äôm so glad God is not like that. God will let you know what you‚Äôve done wrong and where you need to change. He won‚Äôt do it pointing a finger at you or trying to shame you into repentance. Instead, he will lovingly show you the errors of your way, and guide you in the right direction. He wants to fill you happiness and joy. He wants you to be at peace.

John 3:16 tells us that God loves you so much that he gave his only begotten son to die for your sins. He didn‚Äôt do that to guilt you into a right relationship with him. Verse 17 tells us that God did that to save you so you could live with him forever.

All you need to do is repent and come to him. The angels rejoice when that happens and so do I. I want all of my family and friends to know our Heavenly Father. I want them to experience the love and joy he offers to them. I‚Äôm sure you want the same. So let‚Äôs get out there and lovingly share the good news.

üôèDear Lord, thank you for your love and forgiveness. Thank you for not abandoning us to our mistakes, but for reaching out instead to bring us home. Help me to see my sin so I can turn from it and accept your mercy without shame. Thank you for the love you have poured out for me and all of your children. Help me live out of that love today.

Gray or griege is not an option its always gray where i live. 
Patience IRL turned out awful. Looks peach, pink, purple and green depending on the time of day. It looks anything but what it looks like in the photos.
My space is small 25√ó14 8ft ceilings it houses the living room and dining space. Ive got a new sofa coming the color is called pottery. Ive included pictures of the swatch in natural light and in the room.
I have 4 small windows in the room facing N, S, E.
We removed the ceiling fan.
Will be replacing the weird sconces with cylinder wooden ones and the sputnik dining table light with something wood or natural fibers. 
It is likely we will 86 the wood paneled wall. I dont  like it and its nothing special wood wise. 
My pallete is warm autumn inspired. Golds, orange, browns, dark greens etc.
The floors were just refunished so no rug for the time being.
I am lost and overwhelmed. My FIL just died too so my brain is absolutely fried.
I love dark colors and have SW Naval in my bedroom. I considered that. I considered BM Terrytown but if you dont know dark colors show everything and i have 2 feral wildlings and it always seems dusty here. I am considering using the dark green on the tv wall though because we love it. But a whole room im not sure. We would likely have to install crown molding to break up the darkness.
Ive swatched accesible beige, snowbound, alabaster, swiss coffee, brown horse, 4 different greens, 3 other browns. Im at a point i think where i just want the walls to fade away because my L shape sectional will be the focus so the wall color doesnt need to be a standout.

Actually to be fair........ it's not terrible .......just on the wrong side of average......but defintely can't see its attraction as a tourist destination or place to live

\-Just the vibe and energy i get from the place maybe HCMC was negative, maybe dark also. Maybe from atrocities which occured during the vietnam war or something, or the communist state vibe not sure but just don't like it

\-The first thing to greet me from the airport was a taxi scammer who was rude and aggressive. We agreed on $10 to take me to my hotel 1km away lol and then .....he tried to make it $20....

\-Literally nothing really to do entertainment wise.......except maybe see some churches and visit some coffee shops?

\-Pollution is pretty terrible

\-Everyone honking their horn just pisses you off

\-Nearly same prices (or even higher) than thailand and even japan for most things but quality is much lower, take meat for example in their version of 7-11, C2GO or something, wouldn't touch it compared to fried chicken you find in japan 7-11. ---I think this one suprised me the most, Vietnam as a reputation of being 'extra cheap value destination' but most things like one day gym passes, grab meals, decent hotels, are more expensive

\-Hot, dirty and really humid, even more humid than thailand

\-Rats running A LOT around during the night and just overall very dirty place

\-Booked a flight to japan and couldn't be happier im no longer in vietnam, everything is of course better here and the price really isn't that much higher in most cases

I purchased one from Normcore that was advertised as compatible with 58mm Standard E61 Groups - ECM, Rocket, Sanremo, Synesso, Slayer, VBM, etc. It has two horizontal tabs, (I Think this will works) but unfortunately, it's not quite fitting my machine as it's too short and wobbles when in place.

This is my portafilter. You can see the extra ""ring‚Äù in this photo that is without the filter.

To the girl who stole the stars.

It's been half a life already, hasn't it? Nearly 16 years now.

How have you been?
How are your parents? And your sisters?  hope they're all healthy and well x

I often wonder how life has been treating you, my beautiful soul. Of course... you've always been such a fighter through hardships and such an inspiring and leading woman even at our young age. It's okay, I'm sure,  i'm sure you're doing just as amazing as you are. 

This will never reach your eyes I'm sure.
But maybe in a wild parallel world, you're sitting down reading this, moving your cute little nose and mouth the way you did when you focused. Perhaps you've even moved your beautiful hair to the side to see this better. Perhaps your heart even beats a bit faster reading this letter from your ""Lion"".

My dearest, I'd like to thank you for showing me love.

Can you do me a favor and remember that early october night? One of our firsts, while we waited for the bus near my father's for you to go back home?
I'll always remember the excitement in your hazle eyes when you suggested to take my keys so you would be able to come wake me up in the morning before I would wake up myself, as a surprise. 
You know, I never admitted it, but I was awake an hour before you arrived... I heard the door downstairs and my heart started pounding. I pretended to be asleep but in reality, I was the happiest man in the world well before your arrival. I had been since we met really.

I will always remember the chilly breeze that crept in when you opened my bedroom door that morning. It smelled of the crispiest of dead leaves and your wonderful perfume and curly hair. I've never forgotten that. I'll always remember that moment I smelled you and realized it was you... and how you just joined me and spooned me for minutes before we'd go grab our respective buses to our respective schools...

This was the warmest warmth I've ever felt. Nothing in the world existed aside from your grasp around me and your sweet warm lips and cold nose down my neck wishing me good morning. I loved you so much, if only you knew.

In the years that followed, I would cherish the opportunity to talk about you to anyone, the privilege to pronounce your name, let alone see you. I would have screamed your name for the world to hear.

Every activities we did, every outing, every trip, every single moment as mediocre as it was, was always made better with you. You've shown me how to enjoy the simple things, how to be thankful, how to be generous and what it's like to have a supportive partner.

From the moment we met, in your Hermione attire, to the moment you left my father's place when we broke up nearly three years later, I was privileged to share your life and your smile and your ideas, your home, your kindness your endless love and especially your beautiful person and pure soul. Thank you for showing me what life can be when you're happy and loved. 

My home never showed me this.


You know, I've genuinely tried to replace you over the years. I tried to find someone who would be able to make me feel the way you did. Of course it was naive to even believe it was possible. But it was even more naive to believe that this is how life worked. 

I guess that growing up, you realize that everyone is different and finding ""you"" in someone else will not be possible. 

But you see, it's been half a life now, and your name still lingers in my mind as often as the sun sets and rises. Your name and mine has always matched together, everyone always used to call us in pairs remember? I was so proud of us and you. You were my prom date and I was well hoping you'd be the one closing my casket one day.

You took my immense, gray, dull and boring Canvas and painted it in colors I never imagined existed. That canvas is still there, every day, with your colors you know? I miss sharing those colors with you, if you knew. 

I enjoy them on my own, but they will never be as bright as when you were there to enjoy them with me.
You're the girl who stole the stars, remember?

I miss chatting with you, I miss hearing your stories, witnessing your incredible intelligence and perseverance, your soothing voice, your laugh, you singing ever so beautifully... there are so many things I wish we could sit down and talk about.

I cherished the very few times we ran across each other in the city over the last 10 years, those created a high that lasted weeks. even for a quick chat or a rare coffee together. You've become even more magnificent than you were and I've enjoyed every laugh we shared those times. The things I'd give for a coffee with you today, or tomorrow...

It's now been years since I've seen you last. I hope you are well. Just know that the urge to contact you has always been there. All those years. Seeing you happy is what matters.  You've seemed to he for years in your current relationship and out of respect, you won't hear from me. But I'll always be here, earning for our souls to ignite once again.

I will always love you. 

Perhaps we will meet again one day, if we ever do, please remind me to tell you all this.

Your Lion.

I was doing so well on my level 27 monk. Almost finished with Act 2. And today I made myself a nice cup of coffee, went to the Valley of Titans and a group of random skeleton goliaths 2 shotted me. Didn‚Äôt even have time to pause the game. I was like this: :o literally pikachu.gif meme. And I had about 600hp and 70 ES so no idea how that‚Äôs possible. 

Decided I had really good items (some awesome uniques even) and really can‚Äôt be bothered with starting yet again so I‚Äôm going to continue playing on standard. But man.. this game suddenly became very boring and pointless. What‚Äôs the point of carefully analyzing every passive point or being excited about a new item. When now there is no penalty for death. You can keep trying the bosses indefinitely. I wish I didn‚Äôt start hardcore in the first place (was following my favourite twitch streamer who only plays on hardcore). Got addicted to it and here we are :(

The only thing that I keep telling myself is that I‚Äôd probably die in endgame anyway and wouldn‚Äôt even have any gold or stash items then to continue. I‚Äôll try to play on standard but maybe I‚Äôll just drop the game altogether and wait for next league. Just a little rant from me.  ",0,1734617877.0,PathOfExile2,15,0.12,False

My review of Within the Realm of the Dying Sun as a piece of humorous dialogue between the Crane brothers.

Feel free to comment and leave your feedback.

  
**Frasier-the lost episode**

**F** is short for Frasier  
**N** is short for Niles  
  
  
**F**: Oh,Niles, what serendipity it is to run into you at Cafe Nervosa.  
  
I've heard the most exquisite record recently and I'm just starved for an intellectual dissection of its virtues with you.  
  
What are you doing back in Seattle so soon? I thought you were on a month-long conference in Tacoma.  
  
**N**: Oh, Frasier, the flight back was an utter nightmare. The stewardess who served me was a succubus from the seventh circle of hell.  
  
Each time I asked for peanuts, she kept lobbing them at me from afar as if I were some ridiculously overdressed target dummy.  
  
**F**: Are you sure she wasn't a chimpanzee?  
  
**N**: Very funny. So, I see you've been starving for other things as well. Is this new suit two sizes larger than the one you wore prior?  
  
**F**: No, I've just started adding sweeteners in my coffee.  
So maybe I've expanded a little.  
  
**N**:Uhu, and what is this record you speak of?  
  
**F**:Within The Realm of the Dying Sun by Dead Can Dance.  
  
**N**: Oh, but that's a classic. And you've only recently heard of it?  
  
**F:** Brendan Perry is simply divine on this record. Xavier makes me cry(he looks at Niles misty-eyed).  
I'm telling you, Niles, he dwarfs Pavarotti like it's no one's business.  
  
**N**:Haha, that's a good joke, Frasier. I for one, think Lisa Gerrard is a far superior talent.  
  
F:Gerrard is alright. I don't care for her Middle-Eastern caterwauling. Not my style.  
  
**N:** And look at you, you're actually crying. Seeing how there are no onion fumes in our vicinity, I can only surmise that you're repeating that sorry incident that happened to me back in Season 3, when I landed on a fork.  
  
Go on, stand up, and let's see if there's a tine protruding from that big posterior of yours.  
  
**F:** Oh, Niles, you're such an insufferable twit sometimes. Next time I'm not sitting with you.  
  
I'll sit next to that lovely woman two tables from ours(he waves to someone off-screen).  
  
**N:** Oh, a new neighbor or lady-friend of yours?  
  
**F:**No, just someone who has been flirting with me with her eyes.  
Don't you see the looks she's giving me? I'm telling you, she could be the next Mrs. Crane.  
  
**N:** Isn't that what you always say?  
And her looks are probably directed at the incongruity of the fact that someone as big as you is sitting next to someone as well-built as I.  
  
**F:** I think I'm done talking with you. I shall go arm my Cupid's bow. Wish me luck! As if I need it.  
  
**N:** Frasier, first of all, your quiver is out of arrows and has been for a while. Second, you're a lousy shot.  
Remember how you almost nabbed the station manager back in Season 2. He thought you were gay.  
  
**F:** that was just a simple misunderstanding. And personally, I think that episode is wildly overrated.  
The one where you started dating [dad.In](http://dad.In) Season 7, if I'm not mistaken.  
Now that's a classic for the ages. Not sweet on our old man anymore, are you?  
  
And you're the last person who should be judging anyone's marksmanship.  
  
Remember that basketball match where Lady Luck granted you a one-time boon and you made that mid-court shot?  
Later at the bar, you couldn't score a single basket at that toy contraption.  
  
Now, that is check and mate, good sir.

I found his social and decided to dm him saying that I liked him and would like to meet up for coffee or something. He didn‚Äôt respond for like two days, but when he did, he said he was busy planning a trip he was going to. I was excited, asked more about where he was so we can set something up. The last text I sent was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm in x but im moving soon!‚Äù and he never responded again. I saw his socials, he went and came back from his trip hit never followed back. I was hurt but I unfollowed him. 

Since then I have finally moved to the same city he was in (I used to live around ~45 min away from this city) and turned on hinge to see what was out here. Lo and behold, he‚Äôs one of the first suggested. 

I shouldn‚Äôt be, but I‚Äôm sad that he is available bc I would tell myself all kinds of things to get over it (mostly cuz I was embarrassed lol) and so to see him there it‚Äôs more of a plain faced rejection and it sucks. ",0,1734617759.0,dating_advice,24,0.4,False

(I dont know why he has to stick his nose everywhere).And then after that he vented to her best friend how we treated each other that night.

Ok, so yesterday we went out together and i have this girl on college we are on project together with 1 more friend of us that is a male, he is her cousin and this girl is in a relationship for 7 years and after i told her yesterday taht we were all on a coffee together because we had to discuss and work some things about the project she told me ""Oh i could go on a coffee with him also if i knew u are going with her"".

And im like i really am not going with this girl because i want to its because i need to lol, then i told her i wasnt alone with her , she told me i would not be alone with him either ;)

After that she told me she will invite him to her birthday after she told me a month ago ""I wont call him, i dont need him on my birthday""

Last week she told him he is not invited and yesterday she tells me i am the reason she didnt want to call him on her birthday. She told me on summer before we were together that she found out that he likes her very much.

2 weeks ago she made a group for her birthday and he was in there and he was not invited and im like why is he there? She told me a friend asked her to invite him because he wants to check the discussion inside and wants to see what this guy and girl are typing about.. ?

We don't know Florida that well and we've never spent time on the west coast of Fl but we hear it's beautiful. 

  
I've tried to do a lot of research and I am now debating between Boca Granda, Siesta Key, Lido, Pass-a-grille or Anna Maria island. 

**What we are looking for and what's important to us:** 

* A very nice boutique-like resort to make things easy with the baby (it's my birthday ;) ) but not one of those huge resorts with a million people and kids running around... we'd be fine with a beautiful bed and breakfast as well. Something that has some amenities and close to or on the beach to make our lives a bit easier. 
* Chill ""Island"" vibes (we usually go to Rehobeth beach or Ocean City and we want some much calmer and more serene) 
* Cute downtown with some shops, restaurants, coffee places to walk around when we're not at the beach
* Ideally a boardwalk to walk the baby along the water in her stroller 
* A nice flat beach for morning walks  

If you could also recommend the best **airport** to fly into to make the drive easiest that would be so appreciated! We are thinking Tampa or Sarasota are probably the best to fly into for most of these places or Fort Myers if we go to Boca Grande.
