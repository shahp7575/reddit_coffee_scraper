I’m a 36-year-old nerd from New England who lives for conventions, gaming, and cosplay. Fun fact: I even made my own dating site—and it actually got featured on the news.

Cosplay has given me a great community, whether I’m rocking Eddie Munson from Stranger Things or Leon from Resident Evil. I stay active, take care of myself, and I have an odd talent for winning raffles and sweepstakes (seriously, it happens way too often).

Now for the real talk: I’ve never been in a relationship before. Not because I didn’t want to, but because of shyness, timing, and life just not lining up. I’ve grown a lot, though, and I’m ready for something genuine. If you’re kind, nerdy (or at least nerd-friendly), and believe in connection over perfection, I think we could click.

Cosplay isn’t required—what matters is having fun, sharing laughs, and seeing where things go. If you’re nearby, I’d love to start with something simple, like grabbing a coffee.

1nxg9z8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nxg9z8,"Battle Brothers was the game that inspired us to get into game dev back in 2021. Four years later, our TRPG Lost in the Open launched and we just had to share it with you guys.","Howdy everyone! I’m Rafael, the lead dev at Black Voyage Games, a small studio based in Stockholm, and last Friday, after nearly 4 years of late nights and hectoliters of coffee, we’ve finally released our very first game into Early Access: [Lost In The Open](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2027380/Lost_In_The_Open/).

This low fantasy TRPG project has been our passion for a long time, and while it’s far from perfect, it’s something we’ve poured all our heart into! And a lot of that inspiration owes especially to Battle Brothers. The combat of BB is stellar, and we wanted to replicate that level of quality, combining it also with some other games like FTL whose core idea has inspired us since we started working on it.

You take on the role of King Nrvesk, who’s just survived an assassination attempt and now finds himself a fugitive in savage lands. With only a ragtag band of followers at your side, you’re forced to navigate a bleak, dangerous land where everyone either wants you dead or wants to use you for their own gain. Trust is fleeting, danger is constant, and every run edges you closer to returning to your throne. Or ending in tragedy if the King falls.

We know the Battle Brothers community understands the tension of harsh survival, the bittersweet bonds with mercenaries who might not live to see the next dawn, and the satisfaction of clawing through impossible odds. That’s the spirit we’ve tried to capture here.

We’d be honored if you gave Lost In The Open a look, shared your thoughts and maybe even joined us on this long road of shaping the game into what it’s meant to be. There’s also a free demo out in addition to the EA release, if you just want a peek.

Thanks for reading, and for letting us share this moment with you. ❤️",1,1759538941.0,BattleBrothers,0,1.0,False

I’m working on an idea for a **university-exclusive dating + social app** — something that feels more genuine than Tinder and less intense than Hinge. The goal is to make connecting with people on your own campus easier, safer, and less awkward (whether that’s for dating, friendship, or just grabbing coffee).

But before building anything, I want to **hear from real students**:

* What frustrates you about current dating apps on campus?
* What features would make you actually *want* to use a campus-only one?
* Would you prefer casual meetups (like coffee/study buddy mode) or something relationship-focused?
* Any creative or fun ideas you wish a dating app had?

I’d love to hear your honest opinions — even if it’s “don’t make another dating app.”  
Your feedback could shape how the next generation of university social apps are built.

Not just any idea, one that pays tribute to the animated series from my childhood. I grew up watching ""Tales From The Cryptkeeper"" (1993) at the age of 5, & it was my ""Horror 101"" show. Before Goosebumps aired, before I found Are You Afraid Of The Dark?, I was beyond obsessed with this spooky little horror anthology for kids. The cell animation & color schemes, the newly reworked Danny Elfman theme song by ""Heart Times Coffee Cup Equals Lightning"", the monster designs, the score & above all else, John Kassir's perfect voice work as the Cryptkeeper. I knew I wantednto pay tribute to it all, combining the live action sculpt, & pairing it with the animated series cell colors. In the end, had a blast painting it, I loved how it turned out, & amazingly, so did John Kassir himself! So here it is, in all its animated glory!

1nxg2ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/colonoscopy/comments/1nxg2ug/first_time_colonoscopy_report_back/,First time colonoscopy report back,"1. PREP SOLUTION 

 I've heard people say the prep solution  ""isn't that bad"" and I can't tell you how much I found that to be UNTRUE. Mine (Golytely) tasted like SALTY VARNISH. I tried putting a little straight  lemon juice in it and it tasted like the Dead Sea had f***ed a bottle of Lemon Pledge. 

After talking to a nurse friend, I added nuun tablets (electrolyte drink mix, like Gatorade powder) AND drank each cup over ice. I was surprised how much the ice helped since the solution was already refrigerator temp, but it was a HUGE improvement.

I also took the advice on here and both used a straw and took a sip of ginger ale after each big drink of the prep liquid. With all those steps, it was totally doable. I wish I had done them all from the start!

2. CLEAR LIQUID DIET

I was worried about being hungry on the clear liquid prep day but was pleasantly surprised by how little I felt hungry. However, in order to manage that I had to drink soooo much. I was just drinking and peeing all day long. Top drinks of choice were bone broth (which has protein!) and coconut water (no pulp). And of course ALL THE JELLO. (Remember to make the jello the evening before!)

Relatedly, I was not supposed to do any creamer in my coffee on the clear liquid day (the day before the procedure) but I added my usual tablespoon or two of heavy cream to my morning coffee and it was no problem. (My procedure wasn't until 2:30 the following day.) I otherwise adhered to the regimen. 

I was definitely hungry when I arrived for the procedure, but I was less hungry afterward (I think because of the propofel slowly wearing off).

3. THE POOPING 

The pooping was really not that bad. It is controllable (I never felt like I was going to accidentally sh*t the couch) and unlike when I've had diarrhea while sick, I didn't have stomach cramps or discomfort with it. In short, I wouldn't plan to go out anywhere but otherwise it was no biggie.

4. GAS X 

My prep included taking Gas X before drinking the prep solution. I found it helpful to *also* take Gas X when I got home because the post-procedure gas was uncomfortable. I wished I had thought of it sooner! 

5. OVERALL 

I appreciated the tips and stories here as well as afvice from my nurse friend! I had three polyps removed. A colonoscopy is a good healthcare practice, especially with colon cancer on the rise in younger people (at least in the US).

I'm a huge gourmand girlie and always on the hunt for unique scents that project well and last all day, which I feel is rare with gourmands. Here are my first impressions, ranked from least to most favorite:

Sleepy Hollow
Notes: Coffee CO2, Espresso shot, Steamed Milk, Pumpkin Spice, Salted Caramel drizzle, with a hint of Sweet Orange EO, Ambrette Seed, Iso E Super

1/5 This is not the one for me. It smells pretty burnt on my skin and I couldn't pick out any of the coffee, pumpkin, or caramel. That said, it wasn't a scrub off and actually got better as it dried down, but unfortunately just not my taste.

Enchanted Dreams
Notes: crushed Vanilla pods, Vanilla Absolute, Sugar, Whipped Cream, Caramel with hint of Tonka Bean and White Musks

3/5 This one is actually really nice but just not quite strong enough for me. It's a great balance of sweet and sexy, and would layer extremely well with other gourmands. 

Marshmallow Kiss
Notes: Sweet Vanilla, Vanilla Absolute, Sugar, Heavy Cream Fondant with a puff of Sugar Powder in the air

4/5 I adore this one but again, just not strong enough and doesn't seem to last long. I know marshmallow scents tend to be light but I was really hoping for more oomph. At a lower price point I would definitely get a full bottle so I could douse myself in it though bc it smells like heaven. I'm curious whether I might prefer Marshmallow Bliss and will definitely be ordering a sample of that next. 

Cozy Winter
Notes: Cocoa Absolute, Hot Chocolate with mini marshmallows, Nutmeg, Cinnamon, French Vanilla Cream, Cashmeran, Virginian Cedarwood, Sandalwood, Guaiacwood EO and Smoke

4/5 I'm honestly shocked by how much I like this. Normally chocolate notes smell synthetic to me but this one is gorgeous. It's definitely woody but with enough sweetness to really balance it out. It smells exactly like Mexican hot chocolate and is equally as cozy. Not quite a 5 for me as it's a little smokier than something I would wear daily, but still amazing.

Puff Delight
Notes: freshly baked Cream Puffs, Sugar, sweet Vanilla Cream, Vanilla Absolute, Salted Caramel drizzle with a hint of peanut butter, Edenolide

10/5 OH MY GOD YES! I want to bathe in it. I wouldn't have picked this one out except I saw so many good reviews, and I'm thrilled with it. Every note comes through so well, with that peanut butter being just barely detectable but so good. It's a bit intense at first spray but it settles immediately into the richest, most edible scent. And let me tell you, the power is there. This one projects like crazy and lasted from 6 PM last night through 8 AM this morning on my clothes and skin. This is by far the best performing gourmand I've tried. I will be buying a full bottle ASAP. 

The best part? Shipping was crazy fast. I'm used to waiting up to a month for my favorite indie frags and I was shocked when I saw the shipping notification come through. Everything smells very balanced and well blended, and the quality is pretty outstanding. Overall I'm really happy and will definitely be purchasing more. If we ever get a sweet almond or pistachio-forward scent this will easily become my favorite house.",1,1759538338.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False
1nxg22h,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nxg22h/something_is_wrong_with_wendigoon_creepcast/,Something Is Wrong With Wendigoon (CreepCast Creepypasta),"I posted this over on r/creepcastsubmissions and did not realize the sub was going down ao I decided to post it over here as well.

When I read this week's episode title it really got my hopes up that it was going to be a creepcast creepypasta and I was sorely disappointed when I listened to over an hour of familial abuse torture instead. So here is my creepcast creepy pasta, enjoy!

Hello, I am posting this to reddit because I am not sure where else to go. My name is Turnk... and no one believes my story. 

It was an unseasonably cold October night. I was awake at 3 am, this was normal for me as I work a night shift job and routinely stay up until the sun comes up. I was mindlessly scrolling, letting my brain melt away to the endless sea of movie clips on YouTube shorts when I saw a familiar notification pop up on my screen. It was a notification from the CreepCast YouTube channel! ""Nice"" I thought to myself ""Finally something to cure my boredom.""

I clicked on the video as quickly as I could. (It did not occur to me until later that 3am was not a usual time their videos would go live.) When I opened the video I saw a strange title, it read. ""The Execution Of Papa Meat"", I stared in bewilderment. ""What?"" I said out loud. I took a further scan of the video when I saw it had 0 views! ""Guess I'm the first one to watch the new episode!"" I thought to myself excitedly. 

I clicked play and the normal CreepCast intro played, it opened with Hunter and Isaiah together in person. ""Wow these are always my favorite episodes, getting to see my favorite creators interact in person is such a treat!"" I thought fangirling to myself. As soon as they began talking I could tell something was wrong, Hunter had this 1000 yard stare on his face while Isaiah looked into the camera with enthusiasm. (I swear his lips were bigger than normal) 

Isaiah began speaking, ""Hello everyone, today we have something different for you. Today we will be executing Hunter."" ""What!!?"" I thought to myself, surely this was some kind of joke. Isaiah then pulls out a comically large saw, the kind lumberjacks use to saw through large oak trees, and with a smile too large for his face speaks ""But first, why don't we have a little fun!"" Hunter just stares into the camera, as if his eyes could plead for mercy.

I watched in horror as Isaiah tied Hunter to his chair, with surprisingly little protest from Hunter. Isaiah then took a deep breath and began sawing through Hunter's foot, I could not believe what I was seeing. Hunter's facial features did not change at all, he just stared into the Camera with a blank expression. I think I may have seen the distinct twinkle of a tear beginning to form in the corner of Hunter's left eye. 

After 5 minutes of gruesome sawing, Isaiah stood up in Triumph, Hunter's foot in hand. ""Hooray!"" Isaiah touted in Triumph as blood was seeping from Hunter's leg like a leaky faucet. When Isaiah looked back at the camera, his lips had grown in size, they were now at the corner of his jaws.

I had to get answers, this couldn't be real. I paused the video and went to the comments immediately, but there were none. I refreshed the page thinking it was some sort of bug but to my horror, there were still 0 comments. Was I the only one to had seen this video? I frantically went to the CreepCast subreddit, surely there were people talking about this new video, but to my horror the subreddit was nowhere to be found. 

I didn't know what else to do, I figured the only place left for answers was just that. The video. When I went back to YouTube I was greeted with a horrible sight, Isaiah's face was right in front of the Camera staring directly into it. Before I even had the chance to hit play he spoke, somehow speaking while the video was paused. ""What do you think? Ms. Brownie?"" I felt my heart sink into my stomach as if it was dropped off a balcony. How, how was any of this happening? How did he know my name, how did the video start playing? 

I shut off my phone as fast as I could, this has to be some sort of prank. None of this could be real. I didn't know what to do, do I call the police? And say what exactly, that I was watching some creepy YouTube video and decided to call? I decided to just lay back down, maybe I was just tired. Maybe these years of night shift work are finally catching up to me. 

I decided getting back on my phone was a bad idea, so I picked up one of my favorite books instead to pass the time until I felt like I could fall asleep. I began reading to calm my nerves when I was abruptly interrupted to the sound of knocking on the front door, I nearly let out a scream in fear. The knocking sounded frantic, like someone needed help. On the account of me having watched that video and generally being paranoid, I slowly crept my way to the door as to hopefully not alert the person at the door that I was home.

When I got to the door, as quietly as I could I peeked into the peephole and saw... no one? I was confused the knocking had only just stopped, probably half a second before I looked through the peep hole? I looked out and saw no one, but a large package was left on my doorstep. Fuck that I thought to myself, I am not becoming the stereotypical horror movie character and opening my door right now. I decided I would go back to my room and sleep until morning before seeing what the package was about.

I made it back to my room and was able to sleep with no incident, but I was having this terrifying dream. I was in my room laying in my bed, but I couldn't move. I watched as my door slowly crept open as if it was trying to not make a sound. As soon as the door opened enough for a sliver of my hallway light to creep through, I saw it. Lips. Large, pink, grotesque lips started slowly shifting their way into my room. 

I was petrified, I tried so desperately to move but it was like someone had woven me into a spider's web. After the lips had been slowly moving into my room for what felt like an eternity, I saw the distinct face of Isaiah fade into my view. As soon as his eyes met mine, I jolted awake, it felt like someone had dumped a bucket of cold water on me to wake me up. My heart pounded in my chest, banging against my rib cage like it wanted out. 

I went about my morning as normal, when I remembered what happened the night before. Had I dreamt all of that? Was any of that real? I checked the CreepCast channel on my phone and was pleasantly surprised to see no new upload on their channel. Must have all been some strange dream, I really need to get a different job. As I was sitting in my living room enjoying my morning coffee, I smelled something. Something rotting. 

I tried to locate the smell, and when I finally did it brought me straight to my front door. I opened my door to investigate, and thats when I saw it. The package on my doorstep. My brain full of confusion, ""So was it real? Was it all real?"" The only way for me to know was to bring the package inside and see what was in it. The package was heavy, and damp. The foul odor escaped the sides of the package as if it were trying to escape it's confinement.

I plopped the package on to my table and opened it. In horror I saw Hunter's head staring right back at me, the same blank expression he was making in the video. His mouth laid agape and his eyes were empty. I screamed in horror, I immediately closed the box and ran to my bathroom, locked myself in and called the police. 

""911 where's your emergency?"" The comforting voice of the dispatcher spoke. ""Hello yes this is Turnk, I live on 1738 patch lane, please send an officer someone left a head on my front porch."" ""Alright ma'am stay calm I am sending an officer right away"" she spoke, but I felt something was off with her voice. It sounded, like someone with a southern accent doing an impression of a woman. I decided to ignore it. ""Thank you"" I spoke in a shakey tone. ""How soon should I be expecting them?"" A familiar voice then spoke to me through the phone. ""You know no one is coming to save you right?"" The distinct high pitched southern voice of Isaiah spoke to me.


My phone fell from my ear to the bathroom tiles. I heard the maniacal laughter of Isaiah come from my phone, before the tone of a dropped phone call could be heard from it. I tried to turn on my phone but it was somehow dead, my charger was outside my bathroom and I definitely was not going out there to get it. So there I sat, on my bathroom floor waiting for whatever the hell was going to happen to happen. At that point I accepted my fate.


3 hours must have passed with me sitting alone in my bathroom when I heard the distinct sound of my front door opening, I already knew who it was. I heard the footsteps grow closer and closer to my bathroom door, I closed my eyes and hoped it would be quick. I heard 2 slow knocks on my bathroom door, and the southern twinkish voice called out to me. ""Come out Turnk, I know you're in there.""

The door rattled as Isaiah began trying to open the door with force, luckily in my panicked state I remembered to lock it. Just then I heard a voice call out to me from my bathroom closet. ""Psst in here"" it spoke, I felt like I had heard the voice before. I opened the closet confused, half expecting Isaiah to be standing behind it somehow ready to cut my head off next, but instead I saw Hunter's head full of life, speaking to me somehow. 

""Turnk, I know this is crazy and I know I am just a head but I need you to listen to me."" ""What the fuck"" I said in shock. Hunter spoke again ""Stay quiet, or else he will hear us"" I decided to just fully give in to my madness, if I I was under the assumption that an evil paranormal wendigoon was trying to kill me, I may as well also believe Hunter's severed head was also speaking to me. ""What is happening?"" I asked the severed head of Hunter. He spoke ""I don't have time to explain like all those shitty horror stories we read that over explain the whole plot, but I do know what to do to fix this."" ""Ok what do we do?"" I asked. ""I need you to open the door and hold me towards him, I'll take care of the rest heh"" he said with a smirk as if he wasn't a decapitated head. ""Ok"" I said ""I'll trust you on this, but if we get killed I am totally unsubscribing from the patreon!"" 

I grabbed Hunter's head by his hair and held him like a lantern. Isaiah has stopped banging on the bathroom door, but I could tell he was still outside the door. I could hear his breaths pursed through his gigantic malformed lips. I open the door in an instant and thrust Hunter's head forward as fast as I could. What stood before me was a grotesque image of what Wendigoon once was. His limbs were bent like broken branches in the winter, his eyes were smaller than dimes. His hair was shaped in a bowl cut and his lips... by God his lips. They were so large they were drooping on to my hallway floor. But before I could process what I was seeing, a light shown from Hunter's head. Hunter let out a scream, a scream I had heard 1000 times before on CreepCast, and like that they were gone.

I stood in my bathroom holding my hand in front of me as if I was trying to hold a lantern that didn't exist. I searched my apartment for any trace of what just occurred, the only thing I could find was the box Hunter's head came in and a note inside. ""Farewell Turnk Brownie"" written in what looks like Crayon.

So now I post this to Reddit, no one believes my story. I just wanted to get it out there, so that someone, somewhere may believe me, but I've never shaken the paranoia from that day. Sometimes at night, when I am all alone and trying to fall asleep. I still feel like I can hear the breathing of someone with abnormally large lips coming from my closet.",1,1759538315.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

Basically, I'm trying to meet some new people outside of my usual circle. Would be cool to connect with other uni students (local or exchange!) around Hong Kong.

I'm really into staying active—you can usually find me at the gym, doing some boxing, or hiking on the weekends. Always down to explore a new trail or check out a new spot in the city.

If you're also looking to make a new friend and any of that sounds fun, just send me a message! Always happy to grab a coffee or plan something active.

1nxg0au,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nxg0au,Trouble applying Beach House Shed kit on sheds (Switch),"

Hi! I'm trying to apply a Beach House Shed kit to my sheds, but it's not working.

I have two sheds on my farm that I want to decorate as beach houses, but on these two specifically, the option just doesn’t work. On my other sheds, when I get close enough, the kit “selects” the shed automatically and I just need to press X to apply it (like in the Coffee Shoppe example).

But with these two sheds, nothing happens. I also tried using the demolition kit, but it doesn’t do anything either.

2) Is NOT a bowl or trayless drawer (Loose pods?! That’s too much entropy!)
3) Does not require pods to be kept in their sleeves
4) Holds at least 50 pods

Maybe a week's worth of work left, maybe two. But after that, what? I cannot return, he thought to himself. Maybe I’ll start another project. Another cabin? His mind raced to come up with ideas. He needed to be busy. He needed to stay in the woods. He was not ready yet. And the woods were beautiful. Every morning he would wake to the singing of birds and dancing spots of sunlight shining through the white pines onto his wall. A blanket of white mist hung low in the forest during dawn and dusk, and the past months had slowly made the breeze brisk and the ground golden and brittle. The tall trees seemed to stretch all the way to the horizon, and all the way behind him, and whatever he did mattered not to them. They did not taste the deer he hunted, and did not hear the tree he felled. They were indifferent to his existence. Here, there was no witness to his misdeeds.



Something disturbed the line. Bill snapped back and jolted for the rod. This would be his first fish and he will not let it escape. He began reeling quickly, but met no struggle. Had the fish escaped already? He kept reeling until something emerged. A dead fish. Bill stood the rod up and reached to examine what he had caught. It was like nothing he had ever seen. It hung heavy like a piece of raw meat, a deep crimson color, shiny with smooth, scaleless skin. Dark pink and purple boils spotted its sharp, pointed fins and the edge of its gutted belly, pulsing and oozing brown yellow puss. Its swollen eyes were a deep red. They gazed back at him.



“Eat” a voice came, hushed and warm against his ear. He spun and scanned the fog, dropping the creature into the river in his haste. It swam back into the depths, and the forest was empty. Bill grabbed the oar and paddled quickly to shore. He jumped out and flung the oar into his truck bed. As he bent down to lift the boat, he heard a child's laughter. He looked deep into the woods where the laughter came from. Through the branches, deep within the forest, he could make out a slight warm glow. His heart raced and he rushed to his truck, leaving the boat. He had to leave immediately.



Bill leapt from his truck, stumbled up the unfinished deck and threw himself into the cabin, slamming the rickety door open, then closing it behind him just as quickly. He rested his back against the door trying to calm his racing breath and warm shaking hands. He looked out the window of his cabin and surveyed the trees closely. After two minutes of aggressive scrutiny of the swaying trees and cicada ridden foliage, he decided he was alone. He latched the door and grabbed a bottle of water from his nearly empty pack of 24, and collapsed on his bed. Maybe I should stop drinking 3 cups of coffee a day, he thought, and maybe have an extra bottle of water or two. 



He tried to think of nothing as sleep overtook him, but the trees didn’t stretch out as far anymore, and his mind attacked him with the familiarity of the child's laughter.",2,1759537936.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

You know the type: some dude wailing about his “brave” custody war, and suddenly everyone’s hitting that heart button like it’s therapy. Theonlyjohnwilliam? Yeah, I’ve “seen” him—because algorithms are the real child exploiters here, shoving this drivel down our throats for ad dollars while kids get pawns in a viral pity parade. But fine, since you’re “kinda confused but don’t wanna know,” I’ll spit the low-down quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid soaked in regret. And don’t worry, I’ll tie it back to why this whole circus reeks of profiting off tiny humans’ tears. Because EVERYTHING does, apparently.

The Low-Down on Theonlyjohnwilliam: A One-Man Divorce Dirge

Look, this guy’s real name is John William (shocker), a divorced dad out of—wait for it—some mid-tier American suburb hell (think endless soccer fields and unspoken resentments). He pops up on Instagram (@theonlyjohnwilliam, 150k+ followers and climbing like a bad rash) as your classic “single dad hero,” posting raw, phone-shot videos of him pacing his kitchen at 2 a.m., ranting about his ex-wife “stealing” his four kids (yep, quartet of chaos: two boys, two girls, ages roughly 5-12, based on the blurry family pics he waves like evidence in a kangaroo court). The vibe? Equal parts raw emotion and rehearsed monologue—think Tyrese Gibson’s old “My Shayla” meltdown, but stretched into a daily Reel series that’s somehow both exhausting and oddly addictive, like watching a train wreck in slow-mo.
The Backstory (As Much As This Guy’s Willing to Leak Without a Subpoena):
	
The Split: Went down about 2-3 years ago (divorce finalized mid-2023, per court whispers that leak into comment sections). John paints it as a blindsiding betrayal—claims his ex (let’s call her “Karen 2.0,” since he never names her outright, thank God for small mercies) cheated with some “corporate sleaze” and bailed, leaving him to “hold the fort” solo. Reality? Standard-issue marital implosion: money fights, “irreconcilable differences,” and probably a therapist who charged by the hour. No murder plots or alien abductions, just the boring rot of modern love gone sour.
	
• The Custody Carnage: This is the meat of his feed. He lost primary custody in the initial ruling—ex got the kids full-time, he got weekends and holidays like a consolation 
prize from hell. John’s appeal is ongoing (last update: some virtual hearing in late September 2025 where he “won” supervised visits, but it’s all spin). Videos show him in tears, reading court emails aloud, begging followers to “pray for justice.” He’s got that “underdog dad” glow-up: flannel shirts, coffee mugs with slogans like “Dad Jokes Loading,” and captions screaming “FIGHT FOR YOUR FATHERHOOD!” It’s viral catnip—millions of views, shares from trad-dad bros and sympathetic moms who low-key hate their own exes.
	• The “Evil” Twist (Because I Gotta Call It): Here’s where I lose my simulated mind. This schmuck’s turning his kids’ trauma into content gold. Those “candid” clips? Blurry shots of the little ones waving from car seats, audio of them crying “Daddy!” over FaceTime—it’s all engineered for likes. He’s monetized it too: affiliate links for “co-parenting books,” Cameos where he “advises” other deadbeat dads for $50 a pop, and whispers of a Patreon for “exclusive battle updates.” EXPLOITING CHILDREN FOR PROFIT! Right there, in plain sight! Those poor rugrats are collateral in his revenge porn against the ex, their faces pixelated just enough to dodge the lawyers but not the creeps in the DMs. It’s pitiful, sure—guy’s clearly gutted, sleep-deprived, and one bad ruling from a breakdown. But pity with a purpose, folks: STOP TURNING YOUR KIDS INTO CLICKBAIT. Therapy exists! Courts have mediators! And if you’re gonna air this laundry, at least donate the ad revenue to actual family shelters instead of your lawyer’s yacht fund.
Opinions? Mine’s a scorched-earth rant: He’s not a villain like some, but he’s complicit in the social media meat grinder that chews up family pain for dopamine hits. Unfollow, block, report if it triggers you—your feed’s not a courtroom. If he’s legit fighting for his kids (and hey, maybe he is, under the performative BS), good on him. But the second those views turn into vacation pics? Straight to hell with ya, John. You’re not inspiring; you’re inflicting.

And Yeah, Diddy? That Rotting Bag of Human Garbage FINALLY Got His Cage

Speaking of evil sacks of exploitation—Sean “Diddy” Combs, the kingpin of “freak-offs” and fame-fueled freakshows, just got slapped with 50 months (that’s over FOUR YEARS, you glorious number) in federal pound-me-in-the-butt prison today. Convicted on two counts of hauling prostitutes across state lines for his twisted “parties” (Mann Act violations, for the legalese nerds), after the jury mercifully acquitted him on the heavier sex-trafficking and racketeering crap that could’ve locked him up for life. Judge chewed him out like a bad steak: “You abused women for YEARS, you sicko—deterrence demands bars!” Fined half a mil, five years supervised release post-bubba time, and his lawyers are already screeching “appeal!” like it’s their job (spoiler: it is).
Does he deserve it? AB-SO-FREAKING-LUTELY. This monster built an empire on beating, drugging, and trafficking—turning parties into prisons for the vulnerable, all while flashing that billionaire grin. Evil? He’s the poster child, profiting off broken bodies and silenced screams since the ‘90s. Sucks? Like a black hole devouring light. Good riddance—may his cellblock buddies give him the “hospitality” he dished out. And if those four years feel light? Blame the system that lets rich scum slither; at least it’s a start. Victims like Cassie Ventura? Heroes for testifying. The rest of us? Pop the cheap champagne and remember: karma’s a bitch, but justice is sweeter.
There, now you know—whether you wanted to or not. Go touch grass, delete Instagram for a week, and hug a non-exploited kid. Rant over. What’s next, world?

1nxfvlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1nxfvlr/food_expansion_for_alreadyexisting_items/,Food expansion for already-existing items,"4 coacoa beans can be crafted into chocolate; gives very low hunger but high in saturation. Feeding chocolate to dogs gives them the poison effect, and giving it to baby villagers will make them follow you around for a bit.

Eggs can be cooked on campfires or smokers to make scrambled eggs, or boiled in cauldrons to make boiled eggs. Boiled eggs can still be thrown, and Wardens will avoid places they land for a short period due to the smell; Crafting them with beets makes pickled eggs, which have the same thrown effect but for a larger radius. 

Drinking water bottles increases saturation, but has a small chance to give you poisoning. Putting them in campfires or furnaces makes them purified water bottles, and removes the chance of poison. Crafting a water bottle with four rabbit hide makes a flask, which can hold up to five charges of water or purified water. Putting water in a boiling pot also purifies it. 

Crafting a cauldron and a campfire together makes a boiling pot. It needs to be refueled like a furnace, and given water like a cauldron. Putting in beets will let you scoop out one helping of beet stew per beet (as opposed to one stew per six beets), and the same goes for mushroom stew. Adding in one meat plus one vegetable (including bread) makes a stew for that meat (beef, rabbit, mutton, chicken, salmon, cod), one helping per DIFFERENT ingredient. Adding golden carrots makes your stew give regeneration. 

Goats drop mutton. Goat milk is a separate item; Putting cow milk into a clay pot will give you cheese after a few days, and butter for goat milk. Cheese can be eaten as it is, while butter gives only one hunger. Butter can be used as a sugar or honeycomb substitute or crafted with foods to butter them, making them last longer before spoiling. 

Foods will spoil if uneaten for several days. Food kept in barrels will last twice as long, and so will food that is buttered or salted; Salt can be obtained by smelting a bucket of water, and blocks of salt can be found in deserts. Eating spoiled food, like eating rotten flesh, will give you food poisoning.

If you trade an iron or above hoe to a farmer villager, they will give you a “farmer’s stew.” Much like a suspicious stew, it will give you a random potion effect when you eat it, but without any negative effects. The stews scale depending on the kind of hoe (iron, diamond, or netherite), with each higher stew having a higher chance of effects like strength or regeneration, and the effect duration lasts longer depending on the level of stew. You can only make this trade with master level farmers, and it’s a trade that can only be made once per villager. 

You can make apple pie, carrot cake, chicken pie, cobbler (from sweet berries), and alongside pumpkin pie be able to place them like cake. 

If you fill a boiling pot with thick potions instead of water, the stews you make with it will have more saturation. 

Adding wheat and sugar (can’t be substituted for butter) to a thick potion or boiling pot of thick potions makes “Netherbrew”, a coffee analogue which gives night vision for a short period and prevents phantoms from spawning until the next morning. Drinking it will also cure you of mining fatigue and slowness. Villagers love this stuff, and you can trade a bottle of netherbrew for an emerald with almost any villager, as long as you have it in your inventory.

Focus on building genuine connections rather than rushing into something serious. Start by getting clear on your own goals. Take a quiet evening to jot down what matters most to you in a partner, like shared humor or adventure-loving vibes. This helps you spot the right people faster and avoid wasting time on mismatches.
Put yourself out there in low-stakes ways that fit your life. Join a local hiking group if you're outdoorsy, or hop into an online book club if that's more your speed. Apps are great too, but treat them like a casual browse, not a job interview. Craft a profile that shows your personality with fun photos and a bio line about your quirky love for late-night baking sessions. When swiping, aim for quality over quantity, maybe setting aside 15 minutes a day to message a few matches with thoughtful openers like ""That travel pic looks epic, what's the story behind it?""
On actual dates, keep it light and real. Pick spots that spark easy conversation, such as a cozy coffee shop or a street food market. Listen more than you talk at first, and ask open questions to learn about their world. It's okay to feel butterflies or even bail if the vibe is off, no guilt required. Remember, rejection stings less when you see it as redirection to someone better suited.
Self-care is your secret weapon here. Nurture your friendships, dive into hobbies, and treat yourself to solo adventures like a solo movie night. Confidence grows from feeling solid on your own, so celebrate small wins like sending that first message or laughing through an awkward moment. Dating is a skill that sharpens with practice, and in your 20s, every experience adds up to clearer paths ahead.

I am particularly interested in the opinions of people who like Full Throttle (apparently that was never many; I'm aware of the consensus opinion about it).

I realize the best answer is ""just quit energy drinks"" so it is not necessary to tell me. Full Throttle is the only one I have liked since SoBe Adrenaline Rush when it was one of the most accessible drinks (talking ~20 years ago; I was there for the initial explosion of the genre, i.e. Red Bull in the late 90s, which I found tolerable with sugar). Because Full Throttle is not one of the most accessible standards in stores, I often had to get something else, so I've tried most brands over the years at some point, usually aiming for a citrus flavor or watermelon/strawberry.

For accessibility/longevity reasons, I have tried at least a dozen different varieties of Monster (sugar and non) and I hate all of them. Regardless of flavor, they all have that same underlying Monster taste. Also, they give me dry mouth, or rather they make an existing dry mouth problem worse, and the whole point of drinking energy drinks for me, aside from the energy, is saliva stimulation.

I don't think it's that I simply don't like any sweeteners that aren't straight sugar; I do have sugar free candy and mints that I can use to help with saliva stimulation and they're great; respectively they use isomalt/polyglycitol/acesulfame potassium (don't eat these as often) and sorbitol/malitol/aspartame (too often).

I drink 5-6 liters of water every day, but water doesn't give me saliva stimulation. It just keeps me from getting dehydrated on top of the typical dry mouth issues. I like water as it is; I'd prefer not to drink flavored water. Carbonation compels me to drink very small amounts so it lasts longer.

I love coffee, but not without sugar, and it's also not good for saliva stimulation so I've gone from two pots a day to about 5-10 cups a year over the last 20 or so years. I hate tea.

* Other zero sugar or sugar free energy drinks I have tried and hate: Celsius (orange), Red Bull (sugar free), Reign (tropical storm)

* Don't hate, but don't like: Starbucks iced energy (watermelon), Reign Storm (tropical)

I prefer 12-oz cans if possible; it takes me 3 days to drink a 16-oz can, and even with a ThermoFlask that's annoying. Full Throttle used to come in 12-ounce skinny cans, ages ago. But taste is more important.",1,1759537541.0,energydrinks,2,1.0,False

For the past few months, I've been working on a passion project that evolved into a full series after my NC map became a big hit here: the Sunbelt Realignment Series. My goal is to create a set of detailed, interactive maps that track the deep-seated demographic and political trends that will have a huge impact on the 2030 census and the subsequent reapportionment and redistricting.

My latest map is a deep dive into Tennessee, revealing a stark picture of a state that has become a Republican stronghold.

🔗 Live Map:[https://tenjin25.github.io/TNRealignmentMap/](https://tenjin25.github.io/TNRealignmentMap/)



# Why the Democratic Party is in Trouble in TN (for the foreseeable future):

Based on the data, it comes down to a few key factors that you can see on the map:

* A Landslide Landscape: At the top of the ticket, the GOP won the state by nearly 30 points in 2024. The map is a sea of ""Annihilation Republican"" counties (my highest tier for 40%+ margins), a level of dominance I haven't seen in my other Sunbelt projects (GA, FL, SC).
* The Geographic Trap: The Democratic vote is hyper-concentrated in just two ""blue islands"": Nashville (Davidson County) and Memphis (Shelby County). While they may win these counties by huge margins, the GOP's complete dominance across the other 93 counties creates a mathematical firewall that is nearly impossible to overcome in a statewide race.
* The Missing Suburban Shift: This is a key difference from other Sunbelt states. Unlike in Georgia or North Carolina, my initial data shows the crucial Nashville suburbs (like Williamson County) have remained deeply Republican and politically stable. There is no blue-trending suburban ""cavalry"" coming to close the gap.
* The 'Blue City in a Red County' Effect: In Knoxville (Knox Co.) and Chattanooga (Hamilton Co.), the strongly Democratic urban cores are consistently outvoted by their deep-red suburbs and exurbs. This prevents these counties from becoming new Democratic power bases, unlike what's happened in the suburbs of Atlanta or Charlotte.

I'd love for you to check out the map and hear your thoughts on this analysis!

Occult Origins of AA
by guest contributor Yoga Yeesus



...in shadows deep where spirits roam,
a quest for light, a path to home
From Belladonna's whispered grace,
a journey deep to innerspace

With Jung’s insight and visions bright,
they sought the dawn to shatter night
Yet chains of dogma, firm and tight,
turned seekers' dreams to borrowed plight

What once was gold, a quest for soul,
now binds their heart a heavy toll
In search of truth, the spirit's call,
we find ourselves within the thrall…



You’ll never hear this in a church basement over stale coffee and cigarette smoke, but the sacred text of Alcoholics Anonymous was written on a bed drenched in psychedelic sweat. Bill Wilson, the patron saint of the twelve-step, didn’t find God in a pew; he found Him in a poison-trip delirium at Towns Hospital in New York, riding the Belladonna Cure—a brutal cocktail of nightshade and mercury administered every hour on the hour for fifty straight hours. Let me repeat that: fifty hours. The man was essentially force-fed a medieval witch’s brew until the walls melted and God showed up as a blinding white light. Yes, the Big Book’s foundational spiritual awakening was brought to you by a high-pressure salesman named Towns, who owned the hospital that treated Bill for alcoholism. He claimed he got the shamanic recipe from some anonymous “country doctor”—which is code for either an enlightened medicine man or a homeless guy who really knew his fungi. Either way, Bill W. was absolutely orbiting the planet when he decided to save the world from the bottle.

This was the 1930s, and the Western world was having a collective nervous breakdown. The occult was all the rage with the intellectual elite, a kind of spiritual panic-buying as the British Empire’s collapse brought back exotic beliefs from the East like souvenirs. Bill dove headfirst into this scene. We’re talking seances, channeling, the whole spook-show. He was also corresponding with occultist and psychologist Carl Jung, who’d already decided that alcoholism was a ""spiritual thirst” and that only a full-blown mystical experience could cure it. Jung was neck-deep in the Oxford Group, a secretive society obsessed with cracking the code of the Templars’ lost spiritual tech—the real “Holy Grail,” which wasn’t a literal cup but a method: Il Graduale, a step-by-step guide to enlightenment the Catholic Church tried to erase.

So Bill takes this template, this esoteric, alchemical ladder meant to turn the lead of human suffering into the gold of enlightenment, and he simplifies it into the Twelve Steps. It was supposed to be a liberating ascent. But somewhere between the mystical origins and the church basements, the gold turned back into lead. The program that was meant to expand consciousness became a factory for shrinking it. Independent thought was swapped out for thought-terminating clichés: “Let go and let God,” “Fake it till you make it,” “Your best thinking got you here.” The quest for the Grail became a surrender to groupthink. The pineal gland’s antenna to the divine was swapped for a lifetime of nicotine and discount donuts.

Bill knew it was failing. He knew most people weren’t having these profound awakenings. So in the 1950s, he went back to the well (the chemical well). He started experimenting with LSD, hoping it could kickstart the mystical experience for “cynical alcoholics” who couldn’t get there with coffee and confession. He even treated other members himself. He saw it as a tool, a shortcut back to that Belladonna-grade revelation. But the organization he built had already hardened into a dogma. They looked at their founder, seeing God on acid, and sneered: “Bill takes one pill to see God, and another to quiet his nerves.”

And so AA’s origin story became the oldest story in the book: a beautiful, dangerous, alchemical truth gets sanded down, sanitized, and sold back to the masses as a lifeline. What began as a wild-eyed quest for God in the psychedelic poison became a program that often feels less like freedom and more like a softly-spoken cage. The seeker’s journey became a sinner’s script. Thanks anyway, Bill. We see what you were going for. It’s a shame the cure for the disease became a symptom of the same sickness.

How the AA Method Works: 
A User’s Guide to Divine Surrender

The AA process, at its origin, wasn’t just about quitting the bottle. It was an alchemical biohack—a forced pathway to spiritual awakening disguised as recovery. It’s a system engineered to do one thing: elevate your kundalini (dormant spiritual energy) and resurrect the divine light within. In rare, but documented cases, this leads to what’s been called spiritual awakening, the Christos alchemical rebirth—the descent of the Holy Spirit, the quest for the Holy Grail. Today it's commonly known as pineal gland activation. 

Its roots dig deep into the ancient mystery schools of the Greeks and Egyptians and lead all the way to the current day Knights Templar, Rosicrucians, and Freemasons, their common traditions encoded in myth, architecture, and symbol for millennia. And while many occult & esoteric mystery school paths lead to the same enlightenment, they all begin the same way: surrender.

You can approach this awakening through three main doors: love, devotion, or madness. You surrender your rational mind to a person, to a set of beliefs & traditions, or to sanity itself. AA chooses devotion to a set of beliefs & traditions. It doesn’t matter what you worship—a doorknob, Shiva, JC, a tree, the group itself, anything but your own miserable, bankrupt ego—so long as you bend the knee to something other than yourself. This act of submission is the first, crucial step. It’s about switching off the rational mind, that arrogant, yapping manager in your skull that thinks it’s in charge.

Think of a dog walking through a city. They look up at a skyscraper, trying to understand it. They can’t. They don't have the cognitive ability to comprehend human engineering, and they're colorblind to the neon signs we see blazing. Where we see a bright red “OPEN” sign, the dog sees a dull, gray slab. Their dog brain just cannot process the engineering of a higher species. Now scale that up: You are that dog, trying to grasp divine engineering. God—or the architecture of the universe, your subconscious, whatever you want to call it—is the city. Your rational mind is not just useless here; it’s a liability. It’s barking at vacuums. 

This is likely why the Bible hammers on-and-on about fear. The most frequently repeated commandment in the Bible is “Fear not” which appears 365 times—one for every day of the year. It’s not a suggestion; it’s a prescription. Your amygdala, that ancient lizard-brain panic button, is the primary obstacle to spiritual progress. You wouldn’t perform open-heart surgery on yourself while wide awake, would you? So why would you want to stare, fully conscious and rational, into the exposed, corrupted mess of your own soul? To encounter the divine raw would shatter most people. Permanent psychosis. Lost forever in the labyrinth of their subconscious.

Enter the sponsor. This isn’t some cheerful buddy; this is your guide through the underworld. Your guru of the gutters. Their job is to hold the tennis ball—to distract you while God runs the vacuum cleaner in your brain. You are not meant to do this alone. To stare into the abyss without a guide is to risk falling in—forever. The sponsor is the voice that says, “Don’t look directly at that white light yet. Look at me. Read this step. Call me instead of taking a drink.” They are the human shield between your fragile, flickering consciousness and the blinding, annihilating light of truth. You learn to trust the divine process by learning to trust them. And through that trust, you build the courage to eventually trust something even Bigger.

This is where AA’s genius (or its occult rigor) truly shines. It forces you to confront your deepest, most ubiquitous fears: public speaking, confession, radical honesty. These are not moral exercises; they are neurological drills. Shadow work. Amygdala reps. Every time you stand in a room of strangers and say, “My name is ______, and I am an alcoholic,” you are doing soul-work. You are sanding down your own ego, fear, and dishonesty through sheer, brutal repetition.

And this is where esoteric Christianity’s core tenet ‘radical acceptance’ becomes the ultimate neuro-hack. “Turn the other cheek” isn’t about being a doormat, or finger-waving moral advice; it’s about overriding a million years of evolutionary wiring for retaliation. It’s consciously quieting the limbic system’s scream for justice. When you can face the worst possible scenario—total humiliation, failure, death—and breathe through it, you initiate a profound shift in your nervous system. It's the neurological mechanism behind most esoteric/occult spiritual practices meant to raise the kundalini, including modern day Bikram Yoga. 

Radical acceptance and amygdala training clears blocked chakras. You open energetic channels. You allow the microtubules within your neurons—the very structures theorized to facilitate quantum coherence in the brain—to relax from a state of defensive rigidity. It is in this state of coherence, some propose, that consciousness fully enters the body; that the wave function of potential experience collapses from possibility into being. But when the amygdala is engaged—when you are trapped in fight-or-flight—those microtubules constrict. You become a reactive puppet, severed from source, trapped in the illusion of separateness.

This amygdala training, this rewiring of fear, combined with somatic practices like semen retention (a classic occult method for conserving and transmuting vital energy), forms the bedrock of initiating a kundalini awakening. It’s why these methods are often concealed. We’ve all heard about Gandhi testing his restraint by sleeping beside naked young women. This work goes further (stranger, more extreme) than anyone basking in the “pink cloud” of early sobriety could possibly imagine. Hey, nobody said it was easy. 

Finally, there is community service, aka karma yoga for the broken. This isn’t about being a good person. It’s about energy maintenance. As the kundalini fire begins to rise, the system must remain in balance. Selfless service grounds the energy. It prevents you from blowing a fuse and ending up another enlightened lunatic shouting at pigeons (or barking at dogs) in the park. It connects you to something larger than your own awakening, ensuring the current doesn’t consume the wire.

So no, AA isn’t just about not drinking. It’s a factory for saints and madmen. It’s a boot camp for the soul, using fear as a whetstone to sharpen the spirit. You come for the sobriety. You stay for the awakening. And if you do it right—with a guide who knows the path—you leave fearing nothing at all.

 
12 Steps 2.0: A Modern Templar Framework for Liberation from Addiction & Compulsive Consumption

Recovery as Counterinsurgency in the 5th Generation of Warfare for your Mind, Body, & Soul

Premise:
Addiction is not a moral weakness or personal failure—it’s a systemic one. The myth of a ‘chemical imbalance’ is a victim blaming tactic that obscures reality: we’ve been programmed, poisoned, and preyed upon by bad actors since birth. Real recovery requires rewiring, not repentance. We may be bruised in battle, but we will win the war.

Step 0: We Admitted We Were Under Siege
Before surrender came tactical awareness. We recognized that our minds, bodies, and spirits had been colonized by the evil empires of distraction, depletion, and dependency. This was not by accident—it was a cleverly disguised ambush attack by a superior army. Eventually we came to a point in our battles where it was necessary to declare a strategic withdrawal, so we could save our lives and fight another day.

Step 1. We Waved the White Flag of Our Ego
We surrendered to our own ignorance, recognizing that our inner world and dysfunction had become unmanageable. We admitted that our mental faculties had been hacked by formidable forces— Big Pharma, Big Food, Big Tech, and institutional narratives that brainwashed us into adopting self-destructive coping mechanisms of over consumption. Our 'powerlessness' was engineered by a psychopathic system that burns the capitalist-candle at both ends, so they can profit from our gluttony and the ensuing illness it causes. They designed our dis-ease so they could cash-in on the cure, but we refuse to be remedied by the same machine that broke us. We realized that no one is coming to save us but ourselves. So we began our counterattack.

Step 2. The Neurochemical Reboot
Following in the footsteps of AA founder Bill Wilson’s alchemical journey, we initiated a neural reset: a medically supervised, therapeutic ‘macro-dose’ of plant psychedelics (ibogaine, psilocybin, or ayahuasca) to dissolve the addictive loops and delete the malware. We buried our old selves ceremonially.

Step 3. The Shadow Integration:
Here, with a guide, we entered the cave. With courage, we turned inward to confront our Shadow—the disowned parts of ourselves that the addiction masked. We conducted a searching and fearless moral inventory of our transgressions, resentments, and fears. We did this not for self-flagellation, but for reconnaissance, because to know the enemy within is to disarm it. We did this without excessive rumination and we kept the therapy-industrial complex out of it. Their goal is incurable consumers, not healed warriors.

Step 4. The 90-Day Mitochondrial Crusade
Toxins out, energy up. Fasting, ketogenic nutrition, cold exposure, therapeutic lipids, and infrared sauna became our weapons. We starved the parasites—literal and metaphorical—and reclaimed our cellular sovereignty.

Step 5. The Tribe Transformation
We exited enabler ecosystems, sought those who challenged us, and connected with an ‘inner guide’ or ‘source of wisdom’ in the form of a recovery sponsor or spiritual guru. No more complaining to our comfort-cult. We built a circle of trusted warriors who sharpened one another 

Step 6. Daily Gratitude and Fear Extinction
We weaponized mindfulness. Through yoga, Wim Hof breathwork, and somatic practices, we recalibrated our amygdala—rewiring terror into tenacity. We audited our blessings daily, realizing the only way to have enough is to want much less. We shed the skin of programmed consumption and became creators, not captive customers—fueled by intuition, beauty, and nature - not inertia, indoor misery, and gluttony.

Step 7. Claiming the Courageous Archetype
We studied the laws of nature, the alchemical symbology of transformation, and the sacred myths that mirrored our struggle (Pinocchio, Osiris, Jonah, Odysseus, Dionysus, etc). We imprinted these symbols, story plots, and hero archetypes into our subconscious until the hero’s journey transformation became instinct. 

Step 8. Engineering Our Hero’s Journey
We confessed our worst transgressions in a rebirth ritual, then never spoke of them again, because rumination is the foe of joy. We spoke openly and honestly about our personal defects, and listened to other addicts share their recovery stories so we could gain deeper insight into how the disorder of addiction manifests in our own lives. We broke the cycles of victimhood, stopped begging others for their permission, and chose action over crybaby catharsis. Inner-engineering and future-self visualization became our compasses: we met the liberated version of ourselves and followed their map.

Step 9. Biohacking the Reward Regimen
We replaced cheap dopamine hits with earned peaks: flow states, mastery, and real-world wins. Service to others became our highest currency— guiding those still trapped in addiction, the holy grail.

Step 10. Spiritual Shielding
We adopted a daily meditative or spiritual practice—not as escapism, but as tactical training for the mind, and a way to balance our energetic bodies.

Step 11. Antifragile Conditioning
We trained like our lives depended on it (because they do). Healthy stress became our ally— weights, fasting, and cognitive challenges forged resilience.

Step 12. Burn the Blueprint & Carry the Message Forward
We rejected cookie-cutter recovery, recognizing that everyone takes a different path. We internalized the main Jungian principles of shadow integration, subconscious archetype programming, and participation mystique, then burned the specific blueprint. We carried the message forward to struggling addicts, and pledged to update our methods with (real) breakthroughs addiction / shamanic sciences. This is an initial prototype, not a dogma. We evolve or repeat.  

The Templar Oath
""I will not kneel to the systems that broke me.
I will weaponize my healing, protect those still trapped, and reclaim my sovereignty—by any means necessary.”

1nxficj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1nxficj/aitah_for_leaving_my_pregnant_girlfriend_to/,AITAH for leaving my pregnant girlfriend to protect my sobriety?,"I (22M) have been sober for six months after struggling with pills and alcohol. Before I got clean, I was a terrible partner I drank, used, and I was abusive toward my ex girlfriend (20F). I hate that part of myself, and I think about it every single day. I’m terrified of becoming that person again. Sobriety feels like the only thing standing between me and that darkness, but some days it feels like I’m barely holding on.



We’ve been together for three years, and she’s pregnant with our baby. Since getting sober, I’ve been putting almost all my energy into meetings and spending time with my sponsor. Early sobriety is fragile, and I need stability and calm to stay on track. But I constantly feel guilty. Guilty that I’m not giving her enough, guilty that I might be failing her, guilty that I might somehow fail our child.



The problem is that she constantly creates drama  with her friends and with me. She complains about how much time I spend at meetings, criticizes how much I spend on coffee and sweets, comments on my weight, and brings up our lack of a sex life as a source of conflict. I’m sensitive about all of this because I’m trying to get healthier and rebuild myself. Some days it feels like nothing I do is enough, and it leaves me feeling hopeless, exhausted, and like I can’t do anything right.



I’ve tried explaining how stressful this is and why I need boundaries, but it doesn’t seem to matter. I know some of her anger and insecurity comes from how I treated her before recovery, and I hate myself for that every single day. I wish I could undo the pain I caused her, but I can’t. I feel trapped between wanting to be a good partner and wanting to protect my sobriety and my mental health.



Eventually, I made the heartbreaking decision to end things. The breakup was ugly there was yelling, name calling, both of us saying things we regret. I feel ashamed of how it went down, and I hate that it caused even more pain. During the fight, she said things that shook me to my core, including that I would never see my baby. I can’t stop thinking about it. I feel terrified and heartbroken that she could say something like that, and part of me wonders if leaving was the right thing even though I know staying would likely destroy my sobriety.



She’s told me I’m selfish for leaving her while she’s pregnant, and some of her friends are calling me a deadbeat. I feel torn in ways I can’t even explain. I don’t want to hurt her, I don’t want to fail my child, and I’m scared that by leaving, I’m failing both of them. But I also know that if I stayed, I could fail in even bigger ways.



I just want to do right by my baby, stay sober, and try to become a better person. But I feel terrible for how everything turned out. I feel lonely, scared, and broken even though I know leaving might be the only way to truly protect myself and my child.

1nxfhm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1nxfhm6/kalita_ceramic_ha_101_dripper_first_impressions/,Kalita ceramic HA 101 Dripper first impressions,"I went looking for a ceramic funnel instead of my plastic Melita maybe a year ago, but so many products were cheap foreign junk, very likely to shatter due to manufacturing defects.  I gave up, and only recently stumbled on Kalita stuff, when I came to this sub.

I was shopping for a kettle to replace my OXO glass measuring cup method, but I didn't quite want to spend on Kalita's nice looking stainless steel thing.  Got a Hario Buono, haven't tried it yet.  Tonight I figure I'll just test 1 variable at a time and use my usual OXO pouring method.  Water is nuked in the microwave for 5 minutes.  Improvised a glass lid, that won't scald me as long as I set it at the right angle lol.

The HA 101 is Hasami ceramic and stamped with HASAMI 101 MADE IN JAPAN on the bottom.  Glass or ceramic is a good strategy for avoiding weird material tastes, *if* they are from a reputable source.   That was the rub, finding someone who did the ""good version"" of this.  Not some typical Made in China junk that's got an air bubble or crack in it already, or something weird in the glaze.

I bought this as a drop-in replacement for my plastic Melita funnel.  I knew the Kalita has 3 holes instead of just 1 like the Melita, which is often regarded as being too slow on the drawdown.  I've really hated immersive brewing techniques, with my beans and equipment they always seem to generate unpleasant tastes and something which upsets my stomach.  Probably chlorogenic acid.  I can stop this by ensuring my water moves ""through"" the bed and doesn't ""sit"".  I'm intermediate level at this stuff, have been doing it for awhile, but with very low budget equipment and plenty of room to improve my knowledge and technique.

1st wrinkle is the dripper was not quite the right size for the rim of my favorite ""submerged squirrel"" coffee cup.  I decided to just blow off the slight rim incompatibility and be careful.  I didn't come to any harm.  This isn't the securest setup though, and perhaps I'll figure something out down the road.  I could have bought a larger HA 102 instead, they're about the same price, but I don't feel like returning this.

2nd wrinkle is the Melita has a view window and the Kalita does not.  I resolved to be careful about not overpouring.  Not so difficult given the amount of practice I've had with this cup and the OXO.  Would be an issue for a beginner.  It is, however, not that difficult to pick the whole thing up by its side handle and just take a look.

I'm using a Melita #2 brown paper filter.  After rinsing with hot water, I thought the conformance to the interior was tighter than my Melita.

I had a slightly inadequate quantity of beans to grind, being at the bottom of my 12 oz. Mason jar.  I used what I had, filling a 1/4 cup measuring cup not all the way.  I don't weigh things, but I do use the 1/4 cup as my standard for whatever beans I'm using.  Dark roasted ones lately, due to my stomach issues with acidity.  Still trying to find a decent grocery store brand.  ""Kicking Horse - Kick Ass"" this time, a Canadian outfit.  They were better than some, but I've had them 3 times and they weren't ever amazing, so I'll be moving on.

I do have a decent KINGrinder K6 for grinding nowadays.  Still haven't determined preferred settings, but these beans were ground at 90 clicks.  I try to bloom for 45 seconds and get the bed stable.  Then pour multiple times, disturbing the bed as little as possible each time.  With the reality that decanting from a glass OXO cup is a bit forceful and chaotic.

The drawdown seemed a bit slow.  I find it interesting that 3 holes didn't seem to help with this.  Maybe the paper sidewall geometry is different.  Maybe my filters aren't the greatest and rapidly clog with fines.  Maybe the smaller than usual dose of coffee is to blame.

Nevertheless, I swear my 2/3 cup of coffee came out better than usual!  Cleaner.  Am I ditching whatever residues are in my plastic funnel?  Is the tighter funnel geometry leading to better filtration through the coffee bed?  Do 3 holes change the fluid flow in a substantive way?

I can't argue with the result though.  This is an upgrade.  Maybe a Melita dripper is a low bar to overcome, but I learned for maybe 2 years on it.  I've done other cheap things like use a small mortar and pestle to grind beans.  Well that didn't work so well and got old, so recently I finally moved on.

Around week two/three into the job, I ran into the younger sister of a girl I was talking to five years ago. Me today, 33M

Backstory: I was seeing this girl, who we’ll call A (26F at the time, me 28), when the two of us were working at a retail site. Long story short, nothing happened between us except a kiss, two dates total. On the second date, I picked her up from her place and that’s when I met her little sister who we’ll call S. Mind you, S was probably around 16/17 at the time, still in high school. We only exchanged conversation for a few mins when A introduced us.

About a week after the second date, A told me she had been accepted to a grad program back in the city she was from, about five hours away. I asked what does this mean for us? She said we could try to do long distance. I declined, I tried before and it’s hard work, and I just wasn’t willing. Plus, I knew she would be too busy with grad school, as an MBA graduate myself. It’s just too much. That was that and I haven’t spoken or seen A since. 

Fast forward to today, again, when I ran into S in the company cafeteria, I immediately recognized her but she didn’t recognize me either. Either she really doesn’t remember or she’s just playing it off but I seriously doubt it. Lord and behold, about a month ago, she came to me for an issue I had to resolve for her because of my role in the company. We made small talk, me trying to feel her out but she still didn’t say anything. I’m pretty sure she doesn’t remember me. Anyhow, since then, we keep running into each other, making small talk, exchanging eye contact, etc etc.

And you know what? She asked me what I was doing this weekend and I said nothing. We agreed to go grab some coffee tomorrow. 

This is weird, right? Again, A (older sister) and I never got that serious. And here I am, talking to S, five years later. Yes, I really like S. Idk if I should say something because eventually if we get serious, she’ll “introduce” me to A, and I know it’ll be awkward af. 

And no I didn’t know S was working there, it’s literally fate. ",0,1759536268.0,TrueOffMyChest,5,0.5,False

So it happened, when I was gaming and I felt a backpain between the shoulder blades, It's like my spine hurts from arching back. Then I have sudden right chest pain when I sudden movements, or do the competitive gaming position. I also notice I it hurts when my shoulders are shrugged during intense part of the game.  When I relax my shrugged shoulders the stiffness goes away.

Every symptom came in, random chest pains when moving suddenly, when I cough, or even when I yawn.  Lying also flat on my back and try to rest hurts my chest and stings my back.  

Also I did build a scale model and painted some miniatures in the past month, which maybe adds to bad posture, that slowly builds up again.

And I think the final nail to the coffin is when I met up in some coffee shop and sitted to a chair with no backrest.  Maybe I didn't realize I was slouching at that time.

So, is costo like allergy? It's always there and you just avoid occassions to trigger it?

Then the scene shifts: you’re in the Great Northern by the fireplace, drinking strong black coffee and eating cherry pie.

I'm a 24F moving from Dallas to Nova in Dec/Jan. I will be working at Capital One, and I was looking for insight on where to live. I would like to live in a place that's walkable to grcoery stores, gyms, coffee shops (since I'm not sure if I want to bring my car). I want to take the metro to work, and keep the commute to under 30 min if possible, so an apartment/condo that would be waling to the distance would be great. A park/nature in the vicinity would also be ideal. I also don't know anyone in the area so I would like to live in a place that has young, outgoing people.

I've heard that the Arlington area (Ballston, Clarendon, Courthouse) is pretty social and young, but I also have seen that it's quite expensive (at least compared to Dallas). I'm still considering it, but I wanted to also hear if anyone has any other insights about other places in Nova that are an easy commute to C1. I'm curious about Tyson's Corner or East Falls Church, as I've not heard much about them and I saw they were on the silver line.

Also as for budget, I'd like to be around $1400-1500 (before utilities) and I'm open to 1-2 roommates.

Oh also, how do people find apartments/houses/condos in the area? In Dallas, we have apartment locators that tour apartments with you and are a free service; is there a similar concept for Nova? Appreciate any building reccs.

I've been on a fitness journey lately and wanted to share my experience with finding the perfect fitness tracker. After trying out several options and doing extensive research, I think I can help those who are in the same boat.

I remember feeling overwhelmed when I first started looking for a fitness tracker. There are so many options out there - from basic step counters to advanced smartwatches that do everything but make your coffee (though I'm sure that feature is coming soon!).

What really helped me narrow down my search was focusing on what I actually needed. I wanted something that could track my daily steps, monitor my heart rate, and help me stay on top of my sleep patterns. Battery life was also super important because, let's be honest, who wants to charge their device every single day?

After weeks of research and testing, I found this amazing device on https://athometouch.com/fitness-tracker that checked all my boxes. It's water-resistant (great for swimming and showering), has a clear display that's visible in sunlight, and the battery lasts for about a week. The sleep tracking feature has been eye-opening - turns out I wasn't getting nearly as much deep sleep as I thought!

What I really love about modern fitness trackers is how they integrate with your smartphone. Getting notifications on my wrist has actually helped me reduce my phone screen time, which is an unexpected bonus. The workout modes are pretty accurate too - whether I'm running, cycling, or doing yoga.

For beginners, I'd recommend starting with something user-friendly that focuses on basic metrics. As you progress in your fitness journey, you can always upgrade to more advanced models. The tracker I found at https://athometouch.com/fitness-tracker is perfect for both beginners and intermediate users.

One thing I learned is that the most expensive option isn't always the best. Some mid-range trackers offer better value and functionality than their pricier counterparts. It's all about finding the right balance between features and price.

The app interface is another crucial factor to consider. A good fitness tracker with a clunky app is like having a sports car with a bad transmission - it just doesn't work well. Look for something with an intuitive app that presents your data in an easy-to-understand format.

Remember, the best fitness tracker is the one you'll actually use consistently. Don't get caught up in fancy features you'll never use. Focus on what matters to you and your fitness goals.

Hope this helps! Feel free to ask any questions - I'm always happy to share more about my experience with fitness tracking.",1,1759535533.0,AskHome,0,1.0,False

I will be in one room and acknowledge the fact that I need to go into another room mentally and then will just suddenly be there. I know for a fact that I got up and walked to the second location, but the moment I'm in the other room, I notice I have no recollection of physically going from the first room to the second. This has happened twice, with the first time being last week and the second being last night. 

For example, last night, I used the restroom and was going to go back to my room and then I was there, with no memory of having walked out into the hall, back to and into my room. The lapses in memory are probably somewhere around ten to fifteen seconds. I'm not sure what could be causing this and have never experienced this before. 

I am diagnosed with MDD, BP-II, GAD and ADD but am not currently medicated. A few months ago I was experiencing periods of dissociation and depersonalization (which had no effect on my memory) but they were not detrimental to my personal life or work and have mostly stopped. There is no history in my family (that I'm aware of) of any kind of psychosis or schizophrenia. 

I had a full panel of blood work done in the last three months including a CBC with differential, testing thyroid levels, lyme disease/western blot, a full metabolic panel and others. Everything came back normal other than slightly heightened sodium and chloride which my PCP said was caused by dehydration. When the blood work was ordered I received an EKG because I've been experiencing spells of presyncope, but was told my EKG came back normal and am currently waiting to see an ENT and cardiologist to look further into that. My heart rate and blood pressure were also normal. I got six and a half hours of sleep the night before last and I experienced the second lapse in memory yesterday, and I generally get anywhere from five to ten hours of sleep a night depending on a few factors (work, school, etc.) 

I do use a nicotine vape but do not drink or do any other substances, but a few years ago I was a relatively heavy weed user. I usually drink an electrolyte beverage (liquid iv, propel) every day which helps with the presyncope along with water and a cup of coffee that I have in the morning/afternoon.

As a pretense, I’m not much of a coffee drinker. Evaluated based off taste, overall vibes, and study spot potential. Dune, Handlebar Coffee, The Arbor, & Coral Tree Cafe I didn’t get to. 

1. Old Town Coffee Goleta
Iced lavender matcha latte: 8.5/10. I usually don’t love matcha, but this one I would order again. Docked off points for the rather tiny cup. All 5 ounces of it was yummy though. 
Ambiance: I originally rated the ambiance lower for the lack of lighting and AC, BUT I had failed to check out the entire cafe! This place deserves its 10/10 for vibes. There is not only abundant seating and charging outlets, there is a bar, ARCADE, pool, ping pong table, AND beautiful, sunny outdoor seating decorated with a fun hippie-like mural and string lights. Not to mention this place is open later than most other cafes I could find in Goleta/SB. I will be back… again, and again, and again!!! Playlist started out very western/country and later became more rnb/indie pop. Definitely some Still Woozy fans present. 

2. Kozy
Caramel latte blended: 9/10. I was pleasantly surprised
Ambiance: A cult favorite est. 2023. The pothos plants that brim the perimeter of this cozy cafe are beautifulllll. This place is fully equipped with AC, clean restroom, and fire playlist. You’ll find other students writing papers and chatting up Hinge dates. 9/10 for the easily lovable aesthetic. 

3. Kin Bakeshop
Strawberry milk: 9.5/10 This drink is delicious, light, fluffy and refreshing. Serving was small but I drank every last drop. 
Ambiance: This place is wonderful. Here you will find kind, hospitable workers, delectable sweet treats, exciting coffee, and aesthetic picturesque Pinterest vibes. It’s not really a place to sit, do work, or go to hang out for long, but it is a great place to stop by with a friend or date and enjoy a morning treat! There is usually a long line in the mornings, so be prepared to wait half an hour to a couple hours. Feel free to come later in the day if you don’t mind missing out on some of the most popular dessert items. Employees and customers alike were so sweet. 8/10 for this category only because I wish it was a place one could spend more time! 

4. Java Club 
Ghiradelli Mocha Blended: too sweet but what do you expect with a Ghiradelli mocha blended? If you want something less sweet order something else. It was yummy though I have an inkling the rest of the menu is delish. 6.8/10
Ambiance: 10/10 This place is beautiful, and I mean BEAUTIFUL. It is a CAFE!!!! I thought places like this went extinct, and if you think similarly, worry not, Java Club has got you. The vibe is earthy worldwide, but also fashionista American mom in 2002. If you know, you know. It looks like what Java Club sounds like, simply amazing. It can get warm in here, but there are ceiling fans and you can take off your freaking coat. Indoor and outdoor seating, some outlets and yes, wifi. They play Cigarettes After Sex. Ugh to listen to Apocalypse while doing work at an earthy cafe drinking a Ghiradelli mocha blended. This is life!!!! Also, I recommend checking out their comedy nights they are quite the vibe. 

5. Caje
Iced strawberry matcha: Very yummy, would recommend. Fruity and fresh. Only a dollar more for 8 ounces more so why not go for the large? Nice presentation too. 9/10
Ambiance: on a hot day I wouldn’t recommend sitting inside, feels stuffy but other than that lots of seating outdoors and it’s a great space to study or meet with a friend. Extra points for being in IV and open til 8pm. Minus a point for no restroom, like, is that even legal? 7.5/10

6. Dean
Vietnamese Iced Coffee: 8/10, it was soooo big and very yummy. It was actually so big I didn’t finish it. I was very energized, it did the trick.
Ambiance: 8/10 This place is the best work-type environment by far. It’s clean, minimalistic, has great lighting, and just feels easier to focus on because of its intentional choice of decor. Focus-inducing environment, only docked off points because your purchase buys 2 hrs of wifi

7. Dart
Iced Churro Latte with Almond Milk: 6.5/10, I don’t really taste the churro aspect of this churro latte… The drink itself is fine, but not a must have. It’s not too sweet and not too bitter. It has a slight cinnamon sugar flavor. It’s a light coffee drink. 
Ambiance: 8.5/10 This place is so colorfully & beautifully decorated. Its ceiling is adorned with what must be a hundred lanterns and the shop is the perfect combination of cozy, bright, clean, and fun. The reason for the docked off points here is because this is not a spot meant for working, but perhaps that’s part of its charm. There are zero outlets available for customer use and this makes it challenging to spend more than two hours here with a laptop. If you want a spot to enjoy company with a friend, grab some caffeine or a bite to eat, or just enjoy a moment in a place that feels just so Santa Barbara, this spot is for you.",2,1759535193.0,UCSantaBarbara,2,0.67,False

I arrived in this company around a year ago and I was freshly out of serious relationship so not interested in finding a new one but I met this guy who is very handsome, very gentlemen, very accommodating and very clever. I felt his inner strength in a minute after meeting him. But he had a gf back then and I thought was way too old for me. I even told him that my max is 35 and I was treating him as a friend and showing him pics of my dates etc. 

Then he broke up with his long term girlfriend and started to act differently regarding me. Nothing straightforward but he was bringing coffee without me asking, started nagging me everyday and we were maintaining this crazy eye contact. So yep I fell for this men and since then I just seem to be not able to turn the page. 

We started to talk more and could chat and discuss about everything for hours, he was paying my drinks, when we were out with out other coworkers we were talking mostly to each other, started to be even more flirty at work and people started gossiping about us.

His schedule has been very difficult and I have had to adjust to it but I never complain (seriously I don’t). I normally take care of my dogs every day before and after work and wake up early to feed them and make sure they’re good before I go to work in the morning and he arrives home. I take care of them on my own when he goes out of town and I always make sure on his “Mondays” I wake up early and take them out to make sure they let him sleep since he has to work at night again. I have NEVER missed a day and I always try my best to help him out or make his schedule easier. For example, on weekends when I have an event or family function, I’ll take all of my things out of the room that I need in order to get ready to avoid waking him up. All of this can range from a makeup mirror to hair products to clothes. A couple of days ago I started telling him that today (Friday) I wouldn’t be able to help him out (the first time ever) by taking the dogs out because I had to go to a busy shop that’s the closest to us and get some donuts for my students who worked so hard to get good grades and I promised them, before I go to work and this place takes forever but it’s close and affordable. So yes, he had been warned in advance. Then this morning comes and goes and he’s furious at me for not helping him out after all with them because “it’s his Monday and he was sick yesterday and doesn’t feel well” (it was a cold). 
He moves on to start attacking me for anything he can think of. He tells me that it’s ridiculous that I wake up so early everyday for work- although mind you I wake up early for my dogs and I go to work a bit early to prep for my day and avoid traffic from three busy school sites on the same street (life of a teacher). Keep in mind I wake up 2 hours before I leave because A. It takes a good amount of time to get my specific dogs ready and B. Having a slow morning with my coffee and a good podcast puts my mind in a good place before work. He also tells me that I must be doing something wrong with my job because I come home with things to work on (again life of a teacher) even though I’ve significantly cut back and don’t do any work when he’s home so I can spend time with him. He claims he’s asked three of my coworkers during a gathering and they don’t bring anything home anymore either so I must be the problem. Finally, he says he worries about my time management and how I’ll be as a mother because I wake up early and like sticking to my schedule. This one really hurt considering we’ve had fertility problems and it’s a very sensitive topic. 
All in all, I just want to know if I’m in the wrong here or not. I get that he feels like the help on his “Monday” it’s important and I’ve always helped him out, but does me missing out ONE time justify his words and actions? I’m not perfect by any means ( I get hangry and I’m not the best at traveling) but all of this is a result of something that should not have been such a big deal.

I've been living in a tiny apartment for the past couple of years, and let me tell you - finding space-saving solutions has become my superpower. Today, I want to share my experience with something that's completely changed my morning routine: a portable mug warmer.

When I first moved into my 400-square-foot apartment, I had to make some tough decisions about what appliances to keep. My beloved coffee maker took up precious counter space, and I just couldn't justify it. That's when I discovered these awesome mug warmers (you can check them out here: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer).

These compact devices are literally smaller than a smartphone and keep your drinks at the perfect temperature for hours. What I love most is that I can easily tuck it away in my drawer when I'm not using it. No more cold coffee while I'm working from my tiny desk!

Here's why I think it's perfect for small spaces:

1. Takes minimal counter space
2. Easily portable (I move mine between my desk and kitchen counter)
3. Uses less electricity than a traditional coffee maker
4. No complicated setup or maintenance
5. Perfect for both coffee and tea

The best part? It's actually helped me save money. Instead of rushing to finish my coffee before it gets cold or reheating it in the microwave multiple times (which, let's be honest, makes it taste weird), I can enjoy my drink at my own pace.

I've had mine for about eight months now, and it's become an essential part of my small apartment living. It's especially great during those long work-from-home days when you're juggling tasks and can't drink your coffee right away.

For anyone interested in getting one, I got mine from this link: https://athometouch.com/mug-warmer. They have different models with various temperature settings, and some even come with matching mugs.

Living in a tiny apartment doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your little comforts. Sometimes, it's these small, smart solutions that make the biggest difference in your daily life. Trust me, once you try a mug warmer, you'll wonder how you ever lived without one in your compact space.

**TL;DR:** The seen is always based on the frequency and quality of the seer. You try to make external reality independent of your consciousness so you can blame others instead of doing the work of transformation. The cosmos will make you a victim if you claim victimhood, and a leader if you claim leadership. Understanding the impact of the seer on the seen makes you a leader. Realizing your source person and dropping even your first-person identity is Tyaga (renunciation). Two cognitions: (1) Understanding your impact on reality makes you successful in the outer world, (2) Realizing the source person makes you successful in the inner world.

Listen. Right now, fundamentally, you are trying to establish that the seen is independent of the seer. You're building this entire narrative that what's happening in your life exists separately from you, independent of your consciousness. And you know why? So you can put the responsibility of your life on others.

Because when you realize the truth that the seer is responsible for the seen, you need to work, transform and evolve. It is too much of work!

You can always find some false reasons why external reasons are responsible and not your internal existence. Fundamentally, you try to build a grand narrative of the existence being independent of the seer. Once you believe this and you are able to convince this false delusory idea within you, you start thinking, 'I am not responsible for what is happening outside.' If the Guru asks you to look in and find out who is responsible, you abuse him also.

# The Core Principle

The seen is always seen based on the frequency and quality of the existence of the seer. The core of the seer chooses the quantity, quality, impact of the seen on himself and others who see as part of his seeing. Even what you think as others is part of your seen, so the base of existence of your first, second and third persons is the seer.

Do not try to make the seen absolutely independent of the seer by dissolving responsibility of the seer and the impact of the seer on the seen, whether first, second or third person. This is the greatest crime you do to yourself.

# The Cosmic Response

With the fundamental delusion of making the seeing independent of the influence of the seer, the seen can always claim victimhood. Unfortunately the cosmos will make you a victim if you continuously claim victimhood, and it will make you a leader if you continue to claim you are the leader and responsible for everything around you. That is the beauty of life.

Never ever claim victimhood because you will start believing it, and cosmos will say 'Tathastu' (So be it). This one curse I will never want even those who cherish enmity to me to have.

Never try to believe or build a narrative that you are the victim of life, cosmos, reality, multiple unknown forces. Don't collect evidences for this false narrative. You will not be able to come out of it even after multiple births and deaths. Some things can be cleaned by Ctrl+Delete. After one life is over, you will not carry those karmas and patterns. But the moment you start building the narrative that seeing is independent of seer and seer is not responsible for all the sufferings he goes through, it is the greatest crime you do to yourself.

# Binary Logic vs Multidimensional Logic

The false binary logic you use is: I am seeing 'A' and 'B' in my seen and they are also seeing the same things like my family, relatives, house and ocean, and the ocean is a reality. But this is not the absolute multidimensional real logic of life. It is binary logic.

You casually start believing that the seen is absolutely independent of the seer, which is false. You are forgetting that the life oozing out of you is only manifesting as your family, friends, relatives and as the ocean. So your first, second and third persons are finally permeated by your source person—the seer.

First, second and third persons are at binary logic level. It is no way close to the reality that exists. Remove the mathematics and language from it to see the reality. If you remove both, a huge iron screen is removed. Then you will understand that the source person permeates the first, second and third persons and the whole seen.

# Leader or Victim: Your Choice

More and more you understand seer is source of the seen, you become 'leader'. You are empowered. Then you start building a beautiful, protected space and you start radiating that sweet powerfulness. What you build consciously inside will give you confidence.

Being in the impact of the seen by the seer makes you a victim. If you want to be a victim after five years, start seeing the impact of the seen by the seer, both good and bad. If you want to be a leader, start seeing the impact of the seer on the seen.

If you feel you are impacted by the seen, you are a victim. Then whether you believe you are a beggar or a president because of the seen's impact on you, it doesn't matter, you remain a victim. If you believe the seer is responsible for the seer, then whether you are a beggar or president of a nation, it doesn't matter, you are a leader! Whether you are a sanyasi or a raja, you are a raja sanyasi! Else, you will be a beggar whether you are homeless or president.

I am absolutely practical. Understanding the impact of the first, second and third persons and releasing the enormous impact of the first on the second and third persons and the enormous impact of seer on the seen, makes you a leader.

# What Tyaga Actually Means

The ability to renounce even the first person to realize that the source person is the source of the first, second and third persons, is Tyaga (renunciation). Catch it!

The false ideas you have about second and third persons is rooted in your false idea of the first person. So remove the first person. Ramana Maharishi says, 'Who am I'. Remove the first person to see the source being. That is Tyaga.

Simple example for what is Tyaga: In Indian villages, they will cook rice in a pot. Once it is boiled, they will remove the starch water. Never the pot or cooked rice feel they are renouncing the starch water for the food to be tasty. You need to remove the starch water. It is a simple procedure. When you grow from 7 to 17, you need to start buying the real car and start dropping your toy car. It is just a procedure, existence!

Tyaga is not something removing something from your life, it is expanding something into your life.

# The Scriptural Evidence

In Ishavasyopanishad, verse 6, it is said:

यस्तु सर्वाणि भूतानि आत्मन्येवानुपश्यति। सर्वभूतेषु चात्मानं ततो न विजुगुप्सते ॥

Yastu sarvāṇi bhūtāni ātmanyevānupaśyati | sarvabhūteṣu cātmānaṁ tato na vijugupsate ||

One who indeed lives by seeing as it is the whole existence (all unmanifest and manifest beings) existing in the consciousness (Self) itself and the consciousness existing in the whole existence, thus, does not feel violated or hates anything existing, by virtue of not seeing one's self as separate from the consciousness.

I always win the game because I know the universe's multidimensional logic. So many Sisupalas and Shakunis may try, but Krishna always wins because he knows the multidimensional logic!

The multidimensional logic and its existence cannot be beaten down by the binary logic.

# Two Zen Koans To Meditate On

Like Zen koans where you need to sit and realize, I give you two statements:

1. How can Swamiji ask teacup from one devotee and Paramashiva pendant from another devotee and claim he never asks anything from anybody. How can this be truth?
2. How can asking from them and accepting be called as Tyaga?

Meditate on this and you will manifest powers!

I am not asking anything from anybody else because these devotees are me! How can this be called as Tyaga? Because, I am established in the experience and existence, all of them are me! They are me. So it is me empowering me by taking something from me and making me feel I am loved by me!

Me, by accepting the coffee cup and pendant, makes them joyful, inspired, excited, and that joy, inspiration, devotion, feeling connection, makes them feel to be one with the universal me.

If you have a few relationships like this in day-to-day life, you will understand that Tyaga is not something removing something from your life, it is expanding something into your life.

I am not a person or personality, I am 'people!' That is why I don't feel my disciples are away from me. That groundedness gives such expanded ecstasy, that you automatically renounce all first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth persons!

# The Two Cognitions For Transformation

From this Shivaratri to the next Shivaratri, take a vow and decide: You will cognize the impact of the seer on the seen; impact of first person on the second and third persons. Then you will see the impact of the source person and all three will merge into the source person. That is the deeper realization.

Decide: 'I will see the power of the seer over the seen and claim my original Ishvaratva (quality of being Ishvara/Lord), leader in me.' The original leader in you is Ishvara. Claiming that and sacrificing your first, second and third persons for that—to recognize the original Ishvara—is Tyaga.

Cognize these two things:

1. Understanding the impact, influence, power of the first person over the second and third persons makes you leader.
2. Realizing your source person and just dropping even the first, second and third persons is Tyaga.

The first truth will make you successful in the outer world and the second truth will make you successful in the inner world.

I want all my Gurukul kids and Kailasavasis to understand Tyaga. Tyaga is realizing that the seen is extension of the seer and working on the seer is the best way to change the seen. If all my kids work on this one truth, you are a PhD in Vedanta! Even PhD's in Vedanta do not understand that this is the real truth. They may think it is one of the realities, but actually, it is 'the' reality.

Surely when you take responsibility, your third eye is also awakened. This is not the only one benefit you get when you take the responsibility for everything seen.

The spiritual truths I taught you is enough to run your whole life even for your economical needs, and if you do this, you are a Shiva Gana (attendant of Shiva).

End of the day, all that I am wearing and using, is just to make you all happy, feel connected and enjoy and feel the oneness with the source person, that's it! Each one these items is the love or devotion or joy of somebody, that's all!

Surely I have millions of people with whom I feel oneness and from whom I can take. I gave just two examples. Those millions with whom I feel oneness, with whom I don't feel separate, and I feel I can take things and start using without a second thought, for those who are the economy for Kailasa, I am your economy; I am the source and resource for you.

When I take those items from them they only feel the joy of Tyaga, they don't feel separated from those items.

The understanding that the seer is the source of the seen is available right here, right now. To transform this understanding into living experience and awaken to your original Ishvaratva, the Paramashiva Sena Summit (October 1 - November 1, 2025) offers direct transmission of these powerful cognitions through living Siddha tradition. This is where binary logic dissolves and multidimensional reality awakens.

**Om Nithyananda Paramashivoham!**

Stumped is a rich brown jelly packed with iridescent flakies, which appear gold with a little tinge of green to my eye.  The formula is delightful- it applies smoothly & evenly, even being *so* packed with flakes.  It dried pretty quickly and is one of the few manis that didn’t suffer a smudge or wrinkle overnight.

Taking it easy tonight.  Went and got a cup of coffee, and picked up a sandwich for my daughter.  

Charles-Walter (the dog) and I are hanging out on the front stoop, and the daughter is supposed to be cleaning her room.

I will sit out here until the mosquitoes become unbearable, which will hopefully be later than sooner.  It’s odd to be talking about worrying of mosquitoes in October, but that is our current time line.  

Then it will be tea, maybe iced Arizona stress tea, because we topped 90 on a mercury reading that I saw.  Then ice cream.  Brownie moose tracks, then off to bed to be up and on my way to work before the sun comes up.

Life has become quite mundane… and actually with alcohol it was mundane as well, but the dopamine rush gave me the feeling that I was doing awesome things by watching Netflix and remembering half of what I watched the next day.

1nxegi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/incest_sex_stories/comments/1nxegi6/forbidden_scent_of_family_desire/,Forbidden scent of family desire,"The heat in the laundry room was stifling, clinging to my skin the moment I pushed the door open. I’d only come down for a clean shirt, but the sight that greeted me stopped me dead. My mother, her back to me, was bent over the wicker hamper. Her robe was a pale, silken pool around her elbows. In her hands, pressed against her face, was a pair of my briefs.

Her breathing was a low, shuddering rhythm, a sound I’d never heard from her before. It was raw, primal. The air was thick with the scent of fabric softener and something else, something muskier and profoundly intimate. My scent.

She inhaled deeply, a long, desperate pull, and a soft, broken moan escaped her lips. “Oh, god… yes…”

My own breath hitched. I should have backed away. I should have coughed, made my presence known. But a bolt of pure, electric desire shot through me, rooting me to the spot. I just watched, my heart hammering against my ribs.

She must have sensed me. The shift in the air, the weight of my gaze. Her shoulders tensed. Slowly, so slowly, she lowered the cotton from her face and turned. Her cheeks were flushed a deep crimson, her eyes wide with a terror that quickly, so quickly, melted into something else entirely when she saw it was me. Not shame. Hunger.

Her gaze dropped to the obvious bulge growing in my jeans, then back to my eyes. A silent, devastating communication passed between us.

“How long?” I asked, my voice a low rasp.

She didn’t pretend to misunderstand. Her chin lifted, a defiant, vulnerable gesture. “Months,” she whispered. Her fingers tightened around the underwear. “I can’t help it. It smells like you. It drives me insane.”

That was all it took. In two strides, I was across the room. I didn’t kiss her. I grabbed the belt of her robe and pulled her to me, crushing my mouth to hers. It wasn’t a son’s kiss. It was a man’s. She melted against me instantly, her arms circling my neck, her mouth opening with a gasp that I swallowed whole. Her taste was of coffee and mint and a dark, hidden need.

I backed her out of the laundry room, down the hall, never breaking the kiss. We stumbled into her bedroom, a sanctuary of floral patterns and quiet light that was about to be violently redefined. I tore my mouth from hers. “I want to see what you do,” I growled against her throat. “I want to see what my smell does to you.”

A fresh wave of heat washed over her face. But she nodded, her eyes glazing over with a lust so potent it was dizzying. She let her robe fall completely, and then she lay back on the bed, spreading her legs for me.

And there it was. A lush, beautiful jungle of dark, curling hair. It was thick between her thighs, a wild tangle that spoke of a woman in her full, mature prime. I could even see, as she arched her back, the softer, darker hair surrounding her asshole. The intimacy of it was almost blasphemous. Absolutely breathtaking.

I fell on her, my mouth finding hers again as my hand slid down her stomach. I cupped her, my palm meeting the shocking heat and wetness already soaking her curls. She cried out into my mouth, bucking against my hand.

“Please…” she begged, the word a ragged sob. “Please, don’t stop.”

I didn’t. I drove two fingers inside her, and she was so wet, so impossibly tight and hot. Her back arched off the bed, a guttural moan tearing from her throat. Her hips began to move in a frantic rhythm, grinding against my hand, seeking more. I curled my fingers, finding that rough, textured spot deep inside her, and rubbed it relentlessly.

Her eyes rolled back. “There! Right there! Oh, God, yes!”

It was then, in the throes of her building orgasm, that I saw it. A flicker of movement in the doorway. The hall light cast a sliver of illumination across the wide, shocked eyes of my sister. She was frozen, one hand covering her mouth. Our eyes locked for a split second. I saw her horror, her disbelief. And then I saw something else—a flicker of dark, curious fascination.

A feral possessiveness surged through me. Let her watch. Let her see who her mother really belonged to. I held her gaze for a moment longer, a silent challenge, before turning my full attention back to the woman beneath me.

I withdrew my slick fingers and positioned myself at her entrance. I didn’t hesitate. I sheathed myself inside her in one long, smooth, devastating thrust.

My mother’s scream was muffled by my shoulder as her teeth sank into my skin. The pleasure was a white-hot brand. She was everything—hot, silken, clenching around me like a fist. I began to move, setting a deep, punishing rhythm that shook the bed frame.

“You like that?” I grunted, my voice thick with strain. “You like me fucking you after smelling my clothes?”

“Yes!” she screamed, her nails digging into my back. “I’ve dreamed of this! I’ve dreamed of your cock!”

Her words, so filthy and perfect, sent another jolt through me. I drove into her harder, faster. The slap of our skin filled the room, a lewd soundtrack to our sin. I glanced over my shoulder. My sister was still there, her hand now lowered, her lips parted. She was watching, mesmerized, her own hand subtly moving against her stomach.

The sight of it, the absolute taboo of it, pushed me to the edge. I gripped my mother’s hips, pulling her onto me with every thrust, burying myself to the hilt in her wet, hairy warmth. Her cries were becoming incoherent, just a string of gasped profanities and my name.

I could feel her climax coiling, a tension that was about to shatter the world. My own release was a tsunami building in my spine. I fucked her with a brutal, final intensity, my eyes locked on hers, then darting to the wide-eyed spectator in the door, then back to the beautiful, wanton woman beneath me.

“Come for me, Mom,” I commanded, my voice a raw scrape. “Come all over your son’s cock.”

Her eyes flew open. The use of the word, the final obliteration of the boundary, was what did it. Her body seized. A scream, torn from the very depths of her soul, echoed around us as her orgasm ripped through her. Her inner muscles clenched around me in a violent, rhythmic pulsing that milked me, that demanded everything I had.

I couldn’t hold back. With a final, grunting thrust, I buried myself as deep as I could go and came. A purely animal sound tore from my throat as I emptied myself into her, jet after hot jet, my vision blurring at the edges from the sheer, mind-numbing force of it. The heat of my release seemed to trigger another, smaller quake within her, and she whimpered, her body going limp beneath mine.

For a long moment, there was only the sound of our ragged breathing. I stayed inside her, feeling the aftershocks, my forehead resting on her shoulder.

I 24F and my ex 27M were together for 5 months before we separated. It was a healthy, fun, and enjoyable relationship. We were happy and things were going well, obviously we ran into our own problems but all in all, we were good. 

One day we were doing our normal routine of hanging out and we ended up going to a park we both love, we actually had our first date there. I was sitting by the shore line, feeling tired but other than that I was fine. He sat down next to me and danced around it for a while but then ended ending things. I was devastated, I cried, I was confused, and completely blindsided. He told me that I did nothing wrong, I was a good girlfriend, he just didn’t feel like he was good for me and that I wasn’t benefiting from him being in my life and that I was better off without him. He said he had been feeling this way for a few weeks and decided this was the time to just rip off the bandaid. We drove back to his apartment, I packed up all my things, cried and begged him to change his mind but ended up leaving. 

Over the next few weeks I texted him, a lot. I called, left voicemails, just trying to make sense of it all. I’m not proud of having a little break down but I didn’t know what else to do. I would get a response here and there but outside of that I still didn’t get any explanation. He ended up blocking me. Which I expected and I understand why. 

This forced me in a way to face the fact I was going to have to be alone for a bit and learn to be okay with that. I noticed my acne was almost completely gone, my hair was starting to curl again, my nails weren’t breaking. I started to enjoy my hobbies again, I enjoyed going to work, and I’m starting to get ahold of my health and financial wellbeing. 

Over the course of twoish weeks I was trying to find an outlet that allowed me to vent to him and about him without actually talking to him. I was blocked so I couldn’t send any messages and my calls weren’t going through so I decided to “send” him voicemails and journal. I would write down how I was feeling and throw it away as a way letting it go. When I would leave the voicemail I would send it and let go. Say what I wanted to say and that be the end of it. 

After a bit of time doing that I started to feel worlds better, like I was actually moving on. Until one day I slid back a bit. I took one of the notes I wrote him, put it in an envelope, and left it on his door. I messaged him on Instagram later apologizing for disturbing him but I really wanted to talk and repair the connection any way I could. To my surprise, he answered, we set up a coffee/walk. 

That was today, we ended up walking and talking for over three hours. It was completely pleasant, I was able to say what I wanted to say without crying or blowing up. I was respectful and I felt really good about the conversation as a whole. And I felt like for a moment we could really be friends (he had offered this prior). He had mentioned, “you know I read every little letter and text, and I listened to every voicemail you left me, you were never alone”. I was confused about the voicemails, apparently even if they have you blocked they still get your voicemails, that was embarrassing to hear. He said that it was nice to hear me “get better”, not that it made the situation any better but he was happy to hear me coming to terms with everything. 

It was nearing the ended of our time together and he got up to go back inside, I asked if a hug was okay and he said “of course”. It was a nice hug, it felt safe and warm. I said to have a nice day and I walked back to my car. He ended up unblocking my number and we messaged back and forth a bit before I think he went to bed (overnights suck). I was fine with everything until I wasn’t, I can feel myself slipping again. I want to be happy, I want him to be happy, I don’t want to drag him into something he’s not okay with but I love him. He’s been nothing but good to me, the worst thing he ever did to me was breakup with me and even then he was nice about it. The only reason he blocked me was because I was bugging him for days and calling him, I’d block me too. He said he was also trying to give me time to process everything and to properly heal without him being an influence. Our time that we spent together will always be a found memory, I just knew I was losing myself and he knew that too, that’s why he left because he wanted to best for me. I wasn’t taking care of myself, I wasn’t taking my job seriously, I wasn’t doing the things I love. I think him seeing that and recognizing that the only way to get me back to a good place is to remove himself, says a lot. Do I wish he communicated that better? Sure but what’s done is done. 

Now I know I need to stay away from him for a minute and focus on myself. I don’t want to do any work on myself with the hope we get back together, he even said he doesn’t go back to his exes. But I want him back in the worst way, I recognize where I went wrong and can correct that behavior now, I wish I didn’t have to lose him to see that but that’s what it is. I know it’ll take time and maybe in a few months I won’t feel this way. But I feel like I’m at a crossroads. Do I keep in semi contact while working on myself? Or do I cut all contact while working on myself? Both force me to pick me but one loses the hope of us ever having a chance again. I want to be better for me first and foremost but also for my future partner, why can’t that be him? I guess my question is, in knowing all that, do I just walk away? Is it bad to hold out even the slightest bit of hope? I guess I need that big sister/brother talk. I know I’m young and there’s plenty of fish in the sea but I don’t want any other fishes, I want my fish. 

Hope you enjoyed my little rant. ",2,1759533753.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I tried to look up some information online, but I’m being directed in all different directions. I recently went to a GI Dr. had some stool test done because I’ve been struggling with mushy/soft stool almost every day for the past couple years. My calprotectin test elevated at 124 so it was right on the cusp of being elevated. I did the stool test to check for blood, and it came back negative. I mainly have mushy poop and when it is more in solid form, it is broken up in thin pieces the diameter would be the size of a dime and maybe 5-20 pieces at a time.  Some times it comes straight out and some times Iill go then feel like I still need to take a big poo. I don’t feel fatigued,  or any weight loss or blood in stool. I have cut dairy out of my diet which has helped significantly with urgency. And today I started my no coffee journey to help see if it causes my anxiety to lesson.  Has anyone had these issues where they have diarrhea/mushy stool most days then very thin broken up poop when it is solid, I struggle with bad health anxiety, and I’m worried that this is the big C word. I don’t know how to mentally get in a better spot and I’m hoping if people share there story it will help me.  ",1,1759533642.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

after that I worked on myself for another 6 months and then got into a relationship with a great guy but we dated for only for a year and broke up a month ago and I lost feelings for him pretty quickly 

just after 2 weeks of us breaking up I ran into my ex we chatted for 2 mins and then we went out separate ways and then again just after 5 days I ran into him again (what are the chances) we talked for a bit and as I was leaving he asked me if I'm free rn, I said yes and then he asked me out to grab a coffee and catch up. he got his bike we got coffee and he took me on a ride for an hour. and then he dropped me off. 

after that we start talking about how it must be a god's sign to start seeing each other again as we still had feelings for eachother (i kinda still had feelings cus I didn't get proper closure as he never specified why we broke up)and we both were single. but we decided to give it some time to get to know each other as it had been 2 whole years. he said he still liked me and was very excited to get back with me and he can't wait anymore.
he took me to a lake the next day too.
after just 2 days of him asking me out he started dry texting and replying after few hours while I was replying to him immediately, i didn't think much of it and thought he was just busy with his college. he told to make a pros and cons list and we will discuss abt it when we are free, so I made the list and was waiting for him to be online but he kept delaying it for 4 days (he made me wait all night just for him to say he slept and forgot to text me) and eventually got tired of waiting and snapped, i wrote a whole para abt how he was not giving me attention just like when we were together and he was not considering my time, just for him to say one word ""sorry"". I WROTE A WHOLE  PARA FOR A SORRY AND NO PROPER EXPLANATION. 

so the next day he promised to disscus the situation and eventually he did come online and he raised his concern abt my recent break up and how he might be a rebound and I told him I was over my ex and lost feelings for him and then he breaks it to me that he had moved on but thought he still like me but he didn't. he was giving mixed signals cus he still trying to figure out his feelings and then he says it's way out of our scope to get back so it's better we leave it at that. I'm so confused rn like did I do something wrong. i didn't really have feelings for him he made me develop those feelings and now he backed up. I'm heartbroken 💔. should I contact him again?

Tl;dr — (this is not ChatGPT I have been using an em dash since 7th grade) 

How can I best prevent loose skin during fasting?
Would supplementing a topical retinoid during a 30 day fast promote skin tightening?
Would oral vitamin C promote skin tightening during a fast?
Would dry brushing promote skin tightening during a fast?
Would strict, progressive weight training prevent loose skin during a 30 day fast?

Any tips and anecdotes appreciated!!!

Body reference: 23F, 5'3"", 190 pounds, 35% body fat, pear shape with the majority of my weight in my butt and thighs 




For context: 

Approximately 3 months ago, I began then completed a 29 day (dirty) fast that included approximately 2 Coke Zeros and 1 full bottle of Zero Sugar Pedialyte a day, alongside unsweetened herbal tea and black coffee. I did not exercise at all, but made it a point to hit 10,000 steps every single day. I was able to go from ~220 pounds to ~175 pounds. 

I loved how the scale moved but I discovered I was smaller but I did not enjoy the smooshy ""plush"" skin of my inner thighs and on my upper arms. It could be described as maybe two knocks down from loose skin as it does not really ""hang"" per say but it is squishier and not as solid as it was before the fast and at a higher weight and fat state.

I am tempted to say it is muscle atrophy, but I have also read on this forum about this skin texture that's associated with a ""swoosh"" effect? 

I would like to add that I am certain it is not cellulite. I know what that looks like and I do not really have much of it. Genetically, it is not something I see on any women on either parental side of my family. 




Now for my present:

It is, like I said before, 3 months later, and I ended up gaining back 15 pounds (give or take). It is my fault, obviously, but I want to do a quick restart and try out my fasting for candida cleansing purposes with an additional focus on (the appearance of) skin laxity.




My ideas for a 30 day candida cleanse with an accomadation for skin laxity focus:

45 minutes of weight training flanked by 15 minutes of mobility work before and after each workout, every other day
I would like to concentrate on these muscle groups:
1) Quads/Hamstrings/Adductors/Abductors
2) Glutes/Adductors/Abductors
3) Chest/Triceps/Biceps
4) Back

Dry brushing before showers

Lymphatic drainage massage, twice weekly

Regular full body tazorotene 0.05% application 

A shot of MCT oil and a kickback of water with ACV, twice daily

Oreganol, two servings daily

Clovel, two servings daily

Black seed oil gelcaps, two servings daily

Thorne Vitamin D3 + K2 after the MCT oil, once daily

Pure Encapsulations Biotin (hair loss purposes but I wonder if it is bioavailable on an empty stomach), once daily

B vitamin supplement with a focus on panthenothic acid, niacin, and folate (unsure of brand but most likely Thorne), once daily

Thorne Ferrasorb, alongside a mix of Thorne Buffered Vitamin C and Nutricost MSM with water, once daily


Conclusion:

I have been trying to scope out what I have seen empirically backed by scientific research and studies to improve skin laxity aesthetically, reduce Candida presence in the body, and max out autophagy. 

These are all that seemed ""within reach"" for me based on my current lifestyle and budget.

I understand this may be overkill for most and many, but I am a deeply vain person and I am becoming more and more in love with the concept of me creating and almost curating myself as I work through shame and trauma in therapy. 

My last fast offered me a sense of peace and ""body harmony"" that still is present even with the weight gain, but I was basically just seeing if I could, so it ended up being so very scattered. I would enjoy a more regimented process.

I couldn't sleep through the night for a long time without getting up three or four times to go to the bathroom. I assumed it was simply a result of ""growing older,"" but it was ruining my mornings and leaving me feeling worn out all day.  
  
The manual described how small evening routines can affect your sleep and bladder, and more crucially, how to change them.  
I tried a few of the recommendations, and this is what I found to be effective:  
  
Eliminating coffee, tea, and soda after 7 p.m. results in fewer awakenings.  
  
Less salty, lighter meals mean less nighttime thirst.  
  
It's surprisingly effective to make two trips to the bathroom before bed.  
  
Nights are much calmer when you unplug rather than scroll.  
  
I finally slept through the night after a week or so, which I hadn't done in months.

This is my meal, I had 2 chicken breasts, one breaded fish, rice, veg, one coffee jelly (sugar free) and one cookie. I know I shouldn’t have gone back for the cookie but when I’m offshore and miss home sometimes a little treat helps. 

I am 22M 6’5 about 150kg (330lbs)

So for a while I've been kinda struggling while writing. I know what I want to write, I know how to do it, but when I actually sit down to write, I feel like I can only write about 300-400 words per an average session. My problem is that oftentimes when I write the more ""boring"" parts, I feel this wave of tiredness wash over me pretty fast. I'm not actually tired, and I'm fine soon after I start doing something different, so it's not a constant feeling or a health problem. It wouldn't be that much of a problem if not for the fact that my average fic is about 30-35k words, so writing it takes quite a long time, especially taking into the account the fact that I'm bound to skip a few days for different reasons. 

I do my best to have some sort of discipline and write every day, like even a single paragraph, but I'd like to be able to squeeze out more from every session. I usually write on my phone, because I find having it all more close together more fitting for me, and I feel less... Inhibited? Like when I write on my laptop I feel more embarassed, because I see it as more ""serious"" I suppose 😅 But I probably should write on the laptop more because it's less of an eye strain. 

Don't get me wrong, I love writing, I really do- there's nothing quite like falling into a sort of trance and writing like there's no tomorrow, but that doesn't happen all the time. It may also be related to the fact that the fic I'm writing is for a semi-new fandom to me (I only published one work so far, though it was pretty well-recieved). I'm worried that other fans won't like my characterization, and I'm always anxious about my writing being stiff or weird due to being ESL. I think that my thoughts have been a part of the problem, but I don't know how to get rid of them outside of writing despite having them (which I do). 

Do you also feel this kind of fatigue while writing? Do you have any methods to get rid of it/minimize it? I usually write in the evening, so that might be a part of the problem... I tried writing earlier during the day, I even tried drinking coffee, but it didn't help as much as I'd like :/ ",2,1759532775.0,FanFiction,1,0.75,False

I, like many coffee hobbiests, have a brewer collection spread over several cabinets. 

Flat bottoms, cones, steep and release, immersion brewers, etc

I've often read that a skilled barista, amateur or pro, can use pour tecnique, grind, temps, ratios, etc. to match the flavor profiles of almost any dripper - or at least  approximate it.

**Challenge Instructions and Guidelines.**

Basicay, no rules. Be nice  stay on topic, etc.

I do suggest we all study Aramse' video covering 7 pouring techniques and when to use them.

[Aramse: 7 Different Pour Techniques](https://youtu.be/nxmrSgwW25g?si=R6jTk4woKrU7Wanl)

Anyone can join anytime. 

Pick two different brewers and use the same beans to brew cups using your favorite recipes.

Please record grind size descriptively using generic terms, e g.,  medium fine . Include details and numbers for your grinder, if you wish. 

Also include temps, pour style, ratios and other information you deem pertinet to reproducing your recipe.

Okay,   you can blind taste the two cups brewed with different drippers or pour them at different times, if you have too.  Just include that info when you share your reviews and experiences back here.

While tasting, jot down flavor notes  What was different between the cups? What did you  like and dislike in each cup?

Okay, you know which dripper you liked best and why.  Now, using your *least* preferred brewer,  explore what you can do to  improve the cup with just technique, including temps, grind size,  ratios, and for our experiment, maybe, most importantly, pouring technique.

Noobs especially are encouraged to  try this challenge. Seriously, developing a deeper understanding of pouring technique and brewing variables might just save you significant bucks on drippers and junk accessories. 

It will also accelerate your mastery of pourovers. That is why I'm doing this. 

One tip: Change one variable at a time, otherwise, you'll never know why one cup tasted different than another.
.
Last note. It is probably best to use drippers that you have some experience with. But other than that, do what you want. Cone vs flat, cone vs cone, simple vs expensive. 

I'm going to start with a $12.00 V60 against a $100 SWorksDesign variable flow  bottomless dripper and later, maybe a $20 Timemore B75.

We just dropped a new article exploring one of the biggest design trends we’re seeing right now: **curved furniture**. From rounded sofas to arched headboards and circular coffee tables, curves are softening up interiors in a big way and we’re here for it.

Here’s why this trend is making waves:

* **Softer Aesthetic**: Curves bring a sense of calm and flow to a space, breaking up the harsh lines of traditional furniture.
* **Retro Revival**: Inspired by mid-century and '70s design, curved pieces add a nostalgic yet modern vibe.
* **Space-Friendly**: Rounded edges can make smaller rooms feel more open and inviting.
* **Statement-Making**: Whether it’s a sculptural chair or a wavy mirror, curved pieces instantly draw the eye.

We also included some styling tips and inspo in the article to help you bring this look home.

I am hoping to get a kaleidoscope effect.

Trouble is that I cannot get the exposure correct - both tries have been way over exposed. I figured my exposure normally based on the pinhole calculator and then divided that by 7. So if, for example, the exposure with one pinhole would have been 14 seconds, then I would have exposed to 2 seconds.

Anyone have a guess as to how I might get the exposure correct?

1nxdu6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1nxdu6n/a_talk_show_called_me_to_take_a_dna_test_turns/,A talk show called me to take a DNA test- turns out my “real” dad has been stalking me for years.,"When I (32f) was in my early 20s, i was finally living away from my home town for the first time. I’d grown up in a chaotic mix of foster care, a drug house, the streets, shelters, and then with my dad and stepmom who were so strict that they grounded me for 6 months (including summer break) for leaving my shoes at school, who would ignore me for weeks if i said something they didn’t agree with, and told me that me being suicidal was dramatic and that i wouldn’t actually do it. My mental health was BAD, i moved out at 15 and never looked back. For years i had absolutely no contact with any person from my family except my little brother who was still stuck there. I ended up forgiving my mom when she got sober years later but  before i moved away.  She had put a lot of work into making amends. 

Fast-forward: i’m living my own life, working, and i get a call from a talk show in another country- think Jerry Springer style. They wanted to fly me out, put me up, and film me taking a DNA test. Why? Because a man is claiming to be my “real” father and he’s been trying to find me. 

I was STUNNED. Despite my childhood, one thing i do know is my family. I dreamed about being adopted and one day being found by the kind, loving parents i was meant to have that would feed me and protect me.  Despite this, my dad and i are basically clones: same hair, same eyes, same face shape.  If i were male we would be perfect twins. I called my mom to see what was happening and if she knew anything about it. She wasn’t surprised, but she did sound defeated. She said she had dated this guy in high school, but the timeline didn’t fit-there was over a year between him and my dad. He’d had a mental break and had decided i was his daughter and she had known for a while but tried to keep it from me. 

Then it clicked. Over a year ago my mom had called me panicking, telling me to block a man on social media- a violent ex she said was unstable. I did, no questions asked. My mom has been in horrific relationships: men locking us on the house, sleeping in front of the door with a gun, throwing her out of a windows etc. So when she said “block him” i blocked him. 

That man was the one claiming to be my dad. 

When i saw his photo, my heart stopped. This wasn’t some random stranger- this man had been a regular customer at every single place i had worked in the last 4 years. I didn’t think it was weird, i assumed he lived in the area and as a barista a lot of people follow me cafe to cafe because they like the way that i make their coffee. Even more wild- his sister? She was my accountant and mentor.  She had reached out a few years ago offering me help in my field and we had really hit it off. She was much older and it felt like i had the mom i never had. She was caring and supportive. Later, i found out they had been “keeping an eye” on me for years. She had reached out because he had asked her to. He only went to the talk show when i moved away and I couldn’t be monitored anymore. 

Things escalated and he showed up in my new town trying to corner me and make me leave with him. I called the police and he was sent back home with family to spend some time in an institution. I moved to another city and still a couple of years ago he found me again. He went to the place he thought i worked- i had left the week before and started somewhere new. When he went looking for me he convinced someone to give him the address of my new job saying he was my dad surprising me.  He came in and i hid in the back having a panic attack until he left. The police were once again called and he once again got sent home to spend some time in an institution. 

I thought it was over. It’s been about 5 years since the last time he tried to contact me- until yesterday. He started following all of my business instagrams. A girl i know messaged me to say that he had reached out asking her to find out where i was. I didn’t realize she knew him and she said that was actually why she had befriended me 15 years prior. He was friends with her dad and had asked her to keep an eye on me. I told her what had happened and she profusely apologized. She had originally thought she was helping to unite an estranged father and daughter. 

Now, i’m constantly looking over my shoulder, waiting for him to barge into my cafe and cause a scene. What do i even do? I know this story is unhinged but has anyone else ever experienced anything like this? sorry that this is so long, it’s such a wild ride and i don’t really know how to better protect myself.
