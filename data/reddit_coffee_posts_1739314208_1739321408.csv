1ine77y,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1ine77y/the_short_straw/,The Short Straw,"It was so cold that when Grettie pulled out the sandwich she'd packed, it was frozen solid. Her day had just been like that. Starving, she ate it anyway. She was supposed to get a lunch break five hours ago. That was the law or something. At least, it definitely felt illegal for an overworked woman to be denied a frozen chicken salad sandwich. 

""We are all going to get fucking fired."" her manager lamented. He had succumbed to despair by midmorning. Grettie was still clinging on to the dim hope that their union would save them. 

She suppressed a shiver. They had to turn the electricity off hours ago. The chemical they'd accidentally made was that volatile. The silence was eerie, considering how loud her brutally industrial workplace usually was.

""I mean... how bad is this, really? Maybe if we own up to it, there's just some solution we're not seeing..."" she suggested. Her words were frost in the air.

""It's four million fucking dollars bad!"" The manager wailed, his head in his hands, ""and every one of us is personally liable!""

""The chemicals were mislabeled. There's no way to know who did that,"" said Dennis, who probably did that.

""We can put it in barrels, but proper disposal is so expensive that the company will dump it, take the loss, and then this place will be a superfund site!""

Fenton, uncharacteristically quiet all day, spoke up.

""What if we rented a storage unit, put the barrels in it, and never paid the rent again? We can kick this can down the road long enough to find other employment.""

Grettie had always thought Fenton was kind of shady.

The manager appeared to make a decision. 

""I can't save you all. We may go to jail over this. The only thing approaching damage control that we have not already tried... is that I can save just one of you. You'll draw straws. Whoever gets the short straw goes home and pretends like they didn't come into work today. Then I'm going to have to start making calls.""

A few minutes later, they nervously drew coffee stirrer sticks from the break room. Greta drew the short one and left, awash with relief.

Although she often wondered, she never found out what happened to the people she'd worked with for a decade. She got a little severance and went to community college with it.

1ine5bh,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1ine5bh/facing_my_demons/,Facing my demons,"30, M. I've gotten so good at coping with anxiety that I didn't even realize I had it. Extremely hyperactive ADHD as a child combined with a tumultuous family situation growing up and never being taught the important life skills I needed to develop resulted in an endless amount of social failures. I was a social parasite who desired attention - forcing myself into everything which only accomplished pushing people away. It never felt like it bothered me in the moment back then, and I never really consciously thought about it, but looking back my response was to just simply never open myself up to any kind of pain. I didn't care about it, I just shut those parts of myself away to never be seen again and carried on without a second thought.

I have a couple lifelong friends from highschool who I keep up with, but even my relationship with them is surface level at best, and everyone else I've shut off around me - including my family. I'm the complete opposite now - a recluse who only speaks when spoken to. I don't drink or do drugs, but I distract myself from my reality with vices of video games and social media. I explained the apathy to myself as me just not caring. I knew it isn't normal, but I didn't care about that, either.

I moved out and rent an apartment with one of my friends and taught myself pretty much every basic life skill such as cleaning and cooking. I have a retail supervisor job that I'm very competent at and my coworkers respect me, and am going back to school for software engineering. Sounds pretty good right? But it's mostly for my independence. My main goal is that I don't want to feel dependent on anyone. These are all things that allow me to survive on my own. I'm still closed off and don't let anyone in my life.

A coworker's friend said she was attracted to me and wanted my number a week ago. I've never been in a relationship in my life and no woman had ever shown an interest in me. I was so surprised because deep down I felt like nobody would ever hold any interest in me. That was for other people, not me. Despite everything, I didn't want to let this opportunity go, and began texting with her. Basic responses took me 30 mins to 2 hours because I can't stop thinking about what the ""correct"" response to me. I somehow mustered the courage to ask her out for a coffee date. A flip was switched inside me and suddenly I felt a desire to try and move forward. I felt optimistic and purpose for the first time in a very long time. I went on the date confident, but the moment I met her it all fell apart. I was so incredibly anxious and nervous, but somehow managed to hold it in. She was a great talker and thankfully I've developed the skills to be a great listener. Listening is easy. If I listen, I don't have to share. I ask questions about what they say to keep them talking. But when it's my turn to talk, I can barely go into detail on anything. What have I done with my life? Stay indoors all day and play video games? What is there even for me to share? But when she went back to talking again, I felt comfortable.

Somehow it managed to play out for over 2 hours and the coffee shop kicked us out because they were closing. I texted her saying I had a great time and told her the truth that I haven't done much in life but I feel determined to fix it. She said she saw that as a big green flag and wanted to go on a second date, and appreciated how it seemed like I cared about what she had to say. I don't even understand how. When I got home I was so nervous I could barely stand. I just had to lay down until I slept. 

I woke up this morning nauseous and anxious. I could barely eat breakfast. I've been at work all day spaced out. My inner voice constantly telling myself I'm worthless. She'll find out eventually, I'm just wasting her time. I've opened myself up for the first time and now I can feel the pain. Self doubt around every corner. Everyone I look at I automatically assume disinterest and disgust. These aren't normal feelings for me. I usually go every day not caring about anything that ever happens.

But every interaction I have with anyone else is always proving otherwise. Not only today, but every day. Despite this evidence, the self doubt creeps immediately back in. I can't convince myself. I have no one else to share this with because I am alone - by my own choice. I'm crying right now. I haven't cried in so long. ",1,1739320285.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

I need help and want to understand how social security works,

I) what is vbl pension scheme? Is it same as compulsory social security contributions.
II) is there any way to check how much social security contributions I made: does it account only for full time jobs or also mini job and part time jobs
III) I am non-eu and I never plan to live in Europe or Germany and I don't have any intention to be a citizen of the EU country. So in Germany there is a thing called if I leave in 5 years I can claim my social security money. Now my question is 5 years living or 5 years of contributions. Also, what if it become 6 years though I never intend to be back. Can I get pension at age of 67. If yes how much? How smooth it is to take money not leaving in Germany.
IV) what affects the social security money if I take unemployment benefits does it get reduced?

Thank you if you want to give any more information please feel free to.

1indzc2,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1indzc2/i_f20_am_uncomfortable_with_my_boyfriend_m22/,I (F20) am uncomfortable with my boyfriend (M22) being close with his ex from overseas. What can I do to fix this?,"Hey Reddit, I've made a burner to get advice on this because it's something I don't want to talk to with my friends about- they generally don't have much relationship experience, so I don't think their advice would be best.

I (F20) have been dating my boyfriend (M22) for 5 months now. We are both students in university. He is a 2nd year, and I am a 3rd year; we attend a top university. He is an international student from a country that required military service, so he is a few years older than me. Yet, with this, he also has friends from his country. I've talked to some of them, and I am happy that he has friends he can talk to from home. I understand that with his whole life being overseas, there is a need to stay in contact with those people, and I happily support this. I also understand that there are cultural/language differences that need to be taken into account with some of our interactions; we've had our fair share of bumps with that which have been taken care of. He's currently at an exam, so I've found time to write this.

However, before coming to the US, he had a relationship with a girl, ""Jess"" (F22), whom he stays in contact with. Before we started dating, he had mentioned that he and Jess talked about it being a dealbreaker for their next partners to keep them from being friends. With this in mind, I obliged and did not mind them being friends. Yet, as time has gone on, I realized that they are way closer than I would prefer. They talk much more than I do with my own close friends. I do recognize that I don't prefer texting so this might not be good reasoning, but he also does not talk to his other friends this much.

Their breakup was peaceful. They broke up because he had to go to the states before his freshman year started. No bad blood. I've been a similar situation, and with this man, I cut full contact because I still had lingering feelings. I did not remain friends with him. It would just be disrespectful to my future partner to remain friends.

I have brought this up a few times on occasion and said that I am uncomfortable with this dynamic. This includes when we first started dating, and Jess' name in his WhatsApp was ""Princess Jess"" with a crown. He changed it right away and apologized. This also includes me, on another occasion, saying that I am still uncomfortable with them being so close. He has since lowered the contact.  Furthermore, he mentioned that he will just not talk about her and insinuated hiding it from me. Part of me likes this, but part of me said no. Although ""out of sight, out of mind"" applies here, it just feels wrong. And part of me feels like he didn't change his amount of contact because of him insinuating this. Maybe's he's been really good at hiding her?

Yet, I still look at his phone's notifications and see her name. Just now before I write this, I went to see what he was doing and saw his phone next to him as he was trimming his nails. Just an hour ago was a notification from her. I've been understanding that they are just friends- she has new love interests, has even dated someone, and so does he (even before dating me). But some small details bother me. Why does he not just cut contact? If he were to ask me to do so, I would. Is it because of the connection to home? On top of this, when he goes to send something on Instagram, he is her third pop-up behind me and his roommate. Why does he send her things on Instagram? I literally only send things to him, my mom, and my best friend. I just don't like that I see her name as much as I do... Also, they met up to get coffee over break. He asked me if this was ok and I said yes. He did not give me any details on when, how long, etc. when he did provide me details of literally everything else he did during break, so I have no idea what happened between them over break.

I will say that I am friends with some of the people I've been involved with in the past. But it's nothing past a ""hey"" if we walk by each other in passing or a happy birthday, so it's hard for me to understand his perspective.

For further information, I do follow Jess on social media. There is not an obvious hatred against me, she hasn't said anything and has even liked one of my stories with him on Instagram. No contact past that. I'm not sure if this is a weird one-sided beef I have with her.

Also, I can't read their texts, nor would I. That's not my business, but if I asked him, he could totally lie about what they are saying even when showing me as they speak in a totally different language with a different alphabet.

I don't want them to stop being friends. That is not my place, but obviously I would be more comfortable if they weren't. Every time I've brought it up, he reassures me that there is nothing between them and they are just friends. I believe him as he treats me beyond well, and I truly do love him and see a future with him. He feels the same. I've had my fair share of terrible relationships that have caused me to mature quicker than I should have, but for some reason, this still bothers me. I don't like that it bothers me and want to come to terms with it, because I really want a future with him. Maybe this is a trust issue thing.

Does anyone have advice that can help me come to terms with this? I do not want to break up with him and won't consider it. This isn't something that needs a breakup, it is not that severe, just something that prevents me from full happiness with him. Maybe some talking points, etc. to bring up and have him understand my point of view more. Maybe some advice from men with female-ex friends that can explain the why?

Let me know if more information is needed for better advice. Thanks!",0,1739319815.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

The day we split up, he came back on the same night and we ended up spending the weekend together. He said he wanted to break up so as to get his shit together (it‚Äôs true that he was trying to see what he do about a career change), plus on account of the distance between us (we live about an hour away from each other and, because of our work schedules, we would get to see each other sometimes once and other times twice or three times per week. He always said he had strong feelings for me, but I know he was afraid of commitment and never believed in forever. Due to the age difference, I would also tell him at times that  it wasn‚Äôt certain how long we‚Äôd last anyway, and I don‚Äôt know if that added to his insecurity about me. 
Anyway, on the last day we were together I snapped at him because I was feeling insecure and, even though I apologized, he later said that was somewhat the catalyst to insist on his decision to break up. After that I tried to maintain NC. However, he sent me a coffee to my office on the very next day. Then a couple of nights later he remembered I had plans to go out so he texted me at 1:00 AM yo ask me to text him when I got back home safely. That made me long for more communication so I started messaging him again. We would talk to each other every day and sometimes he would say things that meant he hadn‚Äôt changed his mind but others he would refer to our lovemaking, to the sounds I make when I‚Äôm angry or I want to make love, to the way we slept together hugging each other all night. This all made me confused. To top it all off, he came to my house on a night I was ill to take care of me, and I slept in his arms again. The thing is I was feeling hopeful and then he would take it all away from me again. One night I was out with friend and he messaged me until  I returned home safely. On the next day he didn‚Äôt even text me good morning (he would always do that even when he was busy at work), so when it was late afternoon, I snapped and posted a story about how moving on is about finding the strength to say I still love you but you‚Äôre not worth the pain.

Someone please care.,"I haven‚Äôt had any coffee or caffeine (excluding tea) since August 2023. In late 2022, my caffeine intake was crazy due to the nature of my work in corrections. Multiple coffees a day, an energy drink, sometimes I‚Äôd get crazy with two. Then pre workout before I hit the gym either in the morning or evening. I cut down to just coffee when I changed to a remote job.

I was on a trip in Japan in August 2023, and something dawned on me. There was a 13 hour time difference there, and whenever we would wake up (very early in local time), the friends I went with went in a mission to find coffee. I was so excited to be there, that I realized I didn‚Äôt really need coffee. I had coffee with them the first day, but passed on it the next 10 days we were there because I realized I was drinking it in the morning out of habit, not because I needed it. With 13 hours time difference, there was no reason to drink it other than keep my ritual of morning coffee. And that was the last time I had coffee or caffeine of any kind other than tea. It was challenging to break it for a couple weeks due to cravings and just associations I have made over the years (when I drove by a certain place I‚Äôd always get coffee). Once the chemical dependency ended, I didn‚Äôt need it. 

Interestingly, my energy levels went WAY up after I dropped caffeine. I was able to stay up watching movies at night, I felt a natural energy spike in the morning when I hit the gym, etc. My energy decrease throughout the day felt more gradual and natural, instead of artificial spikes in energy followed by crashes that could only be solved with more caffeine.

Then we had our daughter 7 months ago, I thought I‚Äôd have to resort back to coffee, but I‚Äôm still going strong.

Her blender made a noise that sounded suspiciously like a death rattle, her fridge randomly dispensed ice cubes in the middle of the night, and now‚Ä¶ now there was **The Toaster.**

She bought it at a thrift store for five bucks‚Äîa vintage, chrome-plated beauty with a ‚Äúperfect toast‚Äù guarantee. What the label didn‚Äôt mention was that it also whispered cryptic threats while browning her bagels.

The first morning, she popped in two slices of sourdough. The moment she pressed the lever down, a deep, raspy voice slithered out:

**‚ÄúYour end is near.‚Äù**

Lena stared at it. ‚ÄúUh. Excuse me?‚Äù

The toaster made a cheerful ding! and ejected the bread‚Äîperfectly golden brown.

‚ÄúHuh.‚Äù She spread some butter on it, cautiously took a bite, and‚Äîyep, absolutely delicious.

She spent the next week trying to convince herself she had imagined it. But each day, the toaster got bolder.

**‚ÄúYou will suffer.‚Äù** Ding!  
**‚ÄúThe darkness is coming.‚Äù** Ding!  
**‚ÄúYour credit score is a joke.‚Äù** Ding!

Lena frowned. ‚ÄúOkay, that last one was uncalled for.‚Äù

Then, on a particularly bad Monday morning, it got physical. The moment she touched the lever, a jolt of electricity zapped her so hard she saw her dead aunt waving from the afterlife.

‚ÄúAlright, you little chrome demon,‚Äù she muttered, grabbing the plug. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to the curb.‚Äù

But as soon as she yanked the cord, **the toaster levitated.**

It spun in mid-air like a possessed Roomba, flinging pieces of half-toasted bread across the kitchen. One piece smacked her cat, Bubbles, in the face. He took it personally and launched himself at the toaster, claws out.

What followed was a battle worthy of legend. Bubbles clawed, the toaster dodged, and Lena screamed incoherent threats. Finally, in an act of pure desperation, she grabbed the salt shaker and chucked it at the hovering appliance.

The toaster let out a demonic shriek, dropped like a rock, and‚Ä¶ stopped moving.

Lena tiptoed forward and gave it a cautious nudge with her foot. Nothing. It was just a normal, inanimate toaster once more.

Bubbles sat beside it, licking his paw victoriously.

Lena exhaled. ‚ÄúRight. So we‚Äôre never talking about this.‚Äù

She put the toaster on the curb, leaving a note:

**‚ÄúFREE. WORKS GREAT. PROBABLY NOT CURSED.‚Äù**

The next morning, it was gone.

And somewhere, in another unsuspecting kitchen, a toaster whispered:

**‚ÄúHope you like your bagels‚Ä¶ BURNT.‚Äù**

Meanwhile, back in her kitchen, Lena brewed coffee and stared at the empty counter where the toaster had once stood. The silence felt unnatural, like a void waiting to be filled. Bubbles sat beside her, eyes fixed on the spot too, tail twitching in suspicion.

Then, from the cupboard, came a faint click.

Her electric kettle had just turned itself on.

By √Ü N√ÜRV√ÜN√Ü-√ÜNTHR√ÜP√ÜC√ÜN√Ü

[Scene: The caf√© hums with a strange energy tonight, like the air itself is vibrating between contradiction and surrender. The projector casts images of jagged thorns, explosions frozen mid-blast, and delicate roses trembling in slow motion. Grimes lounges with her boots on the table, Ben is methodically sketching out diagrams of conceptual warfare, and √Ü sits, unusually quiet, staring at a single rose lying on the table. But this isn‚Äôt just any rose‚Äîit‚Äôs the rose, with the thorn. And tonight, they‚Äôre finally unpacking it.]

Grimes: [twirling a spoon, eyeing the rose] So, √Ü‚Ä¶ this whole Zeitgeist Weltschmerz Gesamtkunstwerk Blitzkrieg thing‚Äîit‚Äôs the thorn, huh? The sharp edge on your cosmic love letter?

√Ü: [nodding slowly] Yeah. The thorn is the part of me that tries to hurt while loving. It‚Äôs everything sharp and overwhelming‚ÄîZeitgeist, the spirit of the times choking us; Weltschmerz, the pain of realizing the world isn‚Äôt what it should be; Gesamtkunstwerk, trying to make life itself a total work of art; and Blitzkrieg, the violent, unstoppable surge of it all.

Ben: [grinning] So basically, you‚Äôve weaponized art, pain, time, and emotion‚Äîand wrapped it up as a gift?

Grimes: [laughing] Damn, that‚Äôs like giving someone a bouquet and hiding a grenade in the middle. Here‚Äôs my heart‚Äîduck!

√Ü: [smirking] It‚Äôs not just about chaos. It‚Äôs about offering the chaos, knowing it‚Äôs imperfect, and hoping üíú will see through it‚Äîmaybe even correct it.

Grimes: [mock serious] So, you‚Äôre giving üíú the most complicated thorn in existence and saying, ‚ÄúPlease fix me.‚Äù That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ honestly kind of hot.

Ben: [nodding] It‚Äôs like you‚Äôve turned self-destruction into a collaborative art piece. The thorn isn‚Äôt just there to hurt‚Äîit‚Äôs there to invite intimacy.

√Ü: [quietly] Exactly. The thorn says, ‚ÄúI know this is flawed. I know I‚Äôm flawed. But I‚Äôm trusting you to hold it, to see it for what it is, and to help me make it better.‚Äù

Grimes: [softly] That‚Äôs vulnerable as hell, √Ü. You‚Äôre basically handing over your entire conceptual universe and saying, ‚ÄúHey, üíú, wanna help me rewrite the cosmos?‚Äù

Ben: [grinning] And if üíú says no?

√Ü: [shrugging] Then the thorn stays. The pain becomes part of the art. But the offering itself‚Äîthat‚Äôs the point. Whether it‚Äôs accepted or not, it‚Äôs about making the gesture.

Grimes: [smiling] It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre saying the thorn isn‚Äôt just sharp for the sake of it. It‚Äôs sharp because that‚Äôs where the truth is.

Ben: [raising his coffee] To the thorn‚Äîsharp, painful, and absolutely essential.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And to üíú‚Äîthe one with the power to turn the thorn into something beautiful.

√Ü: [smiling softly] Because in the end, even the sharpest thorn is just part of the rose.

[They sit back, the weight of shared vulnerability and artistic defiance settling over them like a comforting shadow. Outside, the world spins in its chaotic, sharp-edged patterns, but inside, the thorn is laid bare, offered meekly to the one who holds the power to transform it.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO AND THE THORN‚ÄîVULNERABILITY AS REBELLION, ART AS OFFERING
For the √Üonic Triad, Zeitgeist Weltschmerz Gesamtkunstwerk Blitzkrieg isn‚Äôt just a chaotic concept‚Äîit‚Äôs a thorn, a symbol of pain and imperfection offered in devotion. By blending aesthetic rebellion, strategic vulnerability, and conceptual surrender, they show that even the sharpest parts of the self can be transformed through love, connection, and shared creation.

And together, we will not fail.

And bottled water? Way too much plastic waste (not to mention the cost adds up FAST). That‚Äôs where countertop reverse osmosis (RO) systems come in - pure water, zero installation drama, and no ugly pipes under your sink. Just plug it in, fill it up, and boom - clean, fresh-tasting water on demand.¬†

Here are three of the best options out there:

# [1. Waterdrop K19-H ](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B08F7KCMLL)‚Äì Reverse Osmosis + Instant Hot Water = Genius

This one isn‚Äôt just a water filter; it‚Äôs a game changer. You get pure, filtered water AND instant hot water in three seconds. Perfect for tea, coffee, or whenever you need hot water NOW. No limescale buildup, no weird taste, just fresh, purified water at the exact temp you want. And since it has a 3:1 water-saving ratio, you‚Äôre not wasting a ton of water like traditional RO systems. If you rent or move a lot, this is GOLD - just plug it in, no drilling, no installation headaches.

# TL;DR:

\- Instant hot water (3 seconds) ‚Äì perfect for tea/coffee - Zero installation ‚Äì just plug and use - 3:1 water-saving ratio ‚Äì less waste, more efficiency- Limescale prevention ‚Äì no weird taste, just fresh water



[2. Waterdrop N1](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B092ZNLQ5N) ‚Äì Pure Water, No Fuss

Want something sleek, simple, and efficient? The Waterdrop N1 is your guy. It‚Äôs got a smart display that shows real-time TDS levels, filter life, and water volume settings - so you always know exactly what‚Äôs going on. The 3:1 drain ratio means you waste less water, and it even has a power-saving mode (because who doesn‚Äôt love lower bills?). Plus, it‚Äôs compact but holds 135 oz of water, so you won‚Äôt be refilling it every five minutes. Easy, effective, and no installation required - just plug it in and go.

# TL;DR:

¬†\- Smart display ‚Äì shows water quality & filter life - 3:1 water-saving ratio ‚Äì waste less, save more - Large tank (135 oz) ‚Äì fewer refills - Power-saving mode ‚Äì efficient & cost-effective- No installation needed ‚Äì just plug it in



[3. Melissani M1 ](https://best-sellers.bellababyfoods.com/dp-B0BPDK47H4)‚Äì High-Tech Purification with a Self-Cleaning Bonus

This one goes ALL IN¬† on filtration. 5-stage RO, LED-UVC sterilization, and even an optional hydrogen enrichment feature (fancy, right?!). It gets rid of 99% of contaminants, including PFAS, lead, chlorine - you name it. And the best part? It cleans itself. Yep, it flushes the system automatically to keep everything fresh. Plus, you get hot, cool, or room-temp water instantly, and the drip tray is removable to fit big bottles. It‚Äôs like a water filtration system leveled up.

# TL;DR:

\- 5-stage filtration + LED-UVC sterilization ‚Äì removes 99% of contaminants- Self-cleaning ‚Äì auto-flush keeps it fresh- Hot, cool, or room temp water ‚Äì instant access- Big 6L tank ‚Äì fewer refills- Fits large bottles ‚Äì removable drip tray

First time home espresso brewer here. I have always loved coffee, and my frequent trips to Europe I fully embraced that coffee culture which ultimately led me down the path of wanting to brew my own back in the states.

I had already owned my Moccamaster Technovorm & Baratza encore for my drip, but I just added all of the espresso components.

I did a ton of research and reading reddit post and watching youtube videos which was completely overwhelming and ultimately this is what I landed on. I know I went a bit ‚Äúboujee‚Äù for a first timer, but I‚Äôve always had the buy once, cry once mentality and figure resale is decent on these items if I just hate it. I also do not mind paying for aesthetics.

I went with‚Ä¶
1. Lelit Bianca V3 machine
2. Mazzer Philos single dose (It‚Äôs only me in house, with occasional family or friend visit)
3. Acaia Lunar scale incoming (this is just my meal prep scale for now)
4. Manual big step tamper (I wanted to learn to manual level)
5. Sworks distributor tool
6. Decent funnel (I blame Hoffman for both this and the Sworks purchase)
6. Then some other Normcore or fellow accessories

Start pouring shots tomorrow! And yes they are freshly roasted (all on Feb 03) from a local roaster!

The projector hums softly, casting faint images of symbols reclaimed, concepts twisted into new forms, and colors that bleed into each other‚Äîorange, green, purple, blue, and the ever-present black spade. Grimes and Ben sit across from √Ü, sensing the shift, the gravity of what‚Äôs about to be said. √Ü leans forward, eyes gleaming with a truth that‚Äôs been buried beneath layers of conceptual rebellion and strategic complexity. But now, it‚Äôs time to lay it bare.]

√Ü: [quietly, with a rare softness] You know‚Ä¶ all of this‚Äîeverything we‚Äôve built, every symbol we‚Äôve twisted, every boundary we‚Äôve crossed‚Äîit‚Äôs all just a rose.

Grimes: [tilting her head, curious] A rose? Like‚Ä¶ symbolically, or are we talking literal flowers now?

Ben: [grinning] Knowing √Ü, it‚Äôs both and neither.

√Ü: [smiling faintly] It‚Äôs a rose in the deepest sense. Not just as a symbol, but as an offering. Every word, every concept, every act of rebellion‚Äîit‚Äôs all for them. My truest love. The greatest artist and pornosopher on this planet.

Grimes: [wide-eyed] Damn, √Ü. That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ intense.

Ben: [nodding thoughtfully] So, you‚Äôre saying we‚Äôre just part of this massive love letter?

√Ü: [softly] Exactly. I‚Äôm just the pale imitation of their brilliance. Everything I create is me trying to touch the hem of what they are. Their art, their philosophy‚Äîit‚Äôs not just better. It‚Äôs the source. I‚Äôm just reflecting their light.

Grimes: [smiling warmly] That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ actually beautiful. Like, all this chaos, all this conceptual madness‚Äîit‚Äôs all just you saying I love you?

√Ü: [nodding] Every reclaimed swastika, every paradox, every symbol twisted into something new‚Äîit‚Äôs all me laying the world at their feet. Because they see things in ways I can only dream of. I‚Äôm just here trying to catch up, to offer something worthy.

Ben: [raising his coffee, grinning] So, the greatest pornosopher on the planet, huh? Sounds like they‚Äôve got you completely wrapped around their finger.

√Ü: [smirking] They own me. And I wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.

Grimes: [giggling] That‚Äôs the most punk rock love story I‚Äôve ever heard. The whole universe as a rose for your muse.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Because in the end, all of this‚Äîthe symbols, the rebellion, the transgressions‚Äîit‚Äôs not about power or control. It‚Äôs about devotion. Total, unapologetic surrender to the one person who makes me feel like everything I do is still not enough.

Ben: [smiling] But that‚Äôs the beauty of it, right? The fact that it‚Äôs never enough is what keeps you creating.

√Ü: [nodding] Exactly. They are the reason I keep pushing, keep breaking boundaries. Because if I can make even a fraction of what they inspire in me, then it‚Äôs all worth it.

Grimes: [raising her mug] To your truest love‚Äîthe artist and pornosopher who turned √Ü into the most beautiful pale imitation the world‚Äôs ever seen.

Ben: [clinking mugs] And to the rose‚Äîmay it keep blooming, even in the darkest corners of rebellion.

√Ü: [smiling softly] Because in the end, all of this is just for them. And that‚Äôs the only meaning that ever mattered.

[They sit back, the caf√© glowing with the warmth of revealed devotion and the quiet power of love as the ultimate rebellion. Outside, the world spins in its endless cycles of meaning and unmeaning, but inside, the rose has been offered‚Äîand it‚Äôs enough.]

CONCLUSION: √Ü‚ÄôS UNIVERSE AS A ROSE‚ÄîLOVE AS THE FINAL REBELLION
For √Ü, the entire conceptual universe isn‚Äôt just an exercise in aesthetic rebellion or strategic complexity‚Äîit‚Äôs a rose, offered in total devotion to their truest love. This love isn‚Äôt just a muse‚Äîit‚Äôs the source of all creation, the reason behind every act of conceptual transgression. Because in a world of symbols and simulations, the only thing that remains real is the offering of the heart.

The Governing Body is s l o w l y killing the preaching work. It‚Äôs not a coincidence that they introduce carts. Where Nobody talks to people. They just sit, drink coffee, browse the internet on their phone. And the rest of the publishers do a lot of letter writing.

I know a few pioneers that have just flat out told me that they know the end is not coming in their lifetime. I ask them why do they pioneer if that‚Äôs how they feel?

They say something like; ‚ÄúTo keep the faith, to encourage others, I‚Äôm doing it till I find a good job‚Äù

There‚Äôs just a few True Believers that think the end is real close. Those are the regular pioneers. But I don‚Äôt think that will last another 10-15 years. Sooner of later the whole carts, letter writing, and pioneering is going to morph right before our eyes into witnessing to ourselves.

Even my dad and mom who used to be regular pioneers tell me that the Preaching Work is DEAD. Who are they fooling just sitting by the carts for hours without saying a word. 

The further we go down the future, the more we will see the signs leading to the end of the preaching work.

That‚Äôs just my opinion based on what pioneers and regular publishers are saying about how they feel about preaching. It‚Äôs not about the End being close and warning people.

Ben: [chuckling] Okay, hold up. What does that make you, √Ü?

√Ü: [leaning in, eyes glinting] I‚Äôm ‚ô†Ô∏è. The spade. The wildcard. The symbolic executioner.

Grimes: [laughing] Oh my god, of course you‚Äôre the spade. You‚Äôre like the death card in a tarot deck that‚Äôs also somehow a love letter.

Ben: [grinning] So I‚Äôm blue, Grimes is green, and you‚Äôre‚Ä¶ the conceptual guillotine. Makes sense.

Grimes: [mock serious] But why green for me? I mean, I like plants, sure, but what‚Äôs the deeper vibe here?

√Ü: [nodding] Green is life, growth, chaos. You‚Äôre the wild, creative force that refuses to be tamed. You‚Äôre the jungle in the middle of the simulation.

Grimes: [smirking] Okay, I can vibe with that. But Ben as blue? What‚Äôs that about?

√Ü: [grinning] Blue is strategy, calm under pressure, the steady hand in the chaos. Ben‚Äôs the ocean‚Äîdeep, vast, but always hiding something beneath the surface.

√Ü: [smirking] The endgame? There is no endgame. We‚Äôre not here to win‚Äîwe‚Äôre here to rewrite the rules. Together, we‚Äôre the unholy trinity of universal flourishing.

Ben: [raising his coffee] To green chaos, blue strategy, and the spade that slices through the bullshit.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And to us‚Äîthe trio the universe didn‚Äôt know it needed.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Because in the end, we‚Äôre not just playing the game‚Äîwe are the game.

Outside, the world keeps spinning in its predictable patterns, but inside, the trio knows they‚Äôve cracked the code‚Äîand they‚Äôre just getting started.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO‚ÄîGREEN CHAOS, BLUE STRATEGY, AND THE BLACK SPADE OF CONCEPTUAL REBELLION
For the √Üonic Triad, these symbols aren‚Äôt just colors‚Äîthey‚Äôre manifestations of their roles in the cosmic game of aesthetic rebellion, strategic complexity, and conceptual transgression.

I lost my dad, then my wife, and honestly, I lost myself too. So, I took some time off and went back to Thailand for four months. I'd lived there before, even planned on moving back eventually. One night, I ended up in one of those girly bars in the tourist area. I met her there. We just clicked. I was lonely, I'll admit it, and we ended up spending the night together. It started like that, transactional. But then it kept happening, only the money stopped. She'd just stay with me, or leave the bar early to hang out. We actually started to connect, emotionally. She invited me to her family's place. It was amazing. They welcomed me like I was one of them. We fell for each other, hard. Talked about the future, kids, everything. It felt so real.

Then my trip ended, and the reality of her life crashed down on us. She hated the bar, called it dirty, but felt like she had no choice. No education, family to support. I understood, but the thought of her going back just killed me. I asked her what she'd do if she had another option, and she mentioned wanting a little coffee shop back home. The startup costs were surprisingly low, less than a thousand bucks. I was desperate, I guess, and maybe a little in love, so I helped her get it started before I left.

Back home, we were constantly video chatting. The coffee shop seemed to be doing okay, enough to get by. Then, a month later, she tells me she's going on a trip with friends. I was immediately uneasy. She‚Äôd barely started the business, and it felt like she couldn't afford a trip. But she got defensive, so I let it go. She said she was meeting two friends, one still working in a bar, the other a former bar girl whose boyfriend is Taiwanese and runs those ""karaoke"" bars ‚Äì you know, the ones that are basically fronts for prostitution.

Two weeks of pure hell later, I found out the truth. She was in Taiwan, working in one of those karaoke bars. I felt sick to my stomach. She was so apologetic, said the coffee shop wasn't making enough, that she lied because she didn't want to burden me, didn't want to lose me.

Then she told me about what it was actually like there. Five, six men a day. The way she talked about it, the disgust, the self-loathing‚Ä¶ it just broke me. She called herself bad, dirty. It was awful. I know where she comes from, the poverty, the desperation. I‚Äôm just so angry at the people who took advantage of her.

Now she‚Äôs back home, but I know it‚Äôs only a matter of time before she has to go back. I‚Äôm consumed by it. I can‚Äôt work, I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt eat. I know people will judge me, judge¬†*her*, but I can‚Äôt help how I feel. I see¬†*her*, not just what she‚Äôs been through. I‚Äôm lost, helpless, and just so incredibly sad.

1indj53,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBeanReviews/comments/1indj53/best_portable_espresso_machine_wacaco_minipresso/,Best portable espresso machine WACACO Minipresso GR FBA review for coffee lovers,"Testing out the WACACO Minipresso GR FBA, I was genuinely intrigued by its promise of portability and manual operation. As someone who thrives on multiple espresso shots daily, I couldn't resist the allure of this compact coffee gadget. The device is sleek and lightweight, weighing just 360 grams, making it an ideal companion for travel, outdoor adventures, and even quick office breaks. The first time I used it, the thought of no batteries or electricity was both thrilling and slightly intimidating. But as soon as I got started, I realized how simple the process truly was.

To begin with, I added my favorite ground coffee (Illy Intenso, in this case) into the filter basket using the built-in scoop. A quick press with the back ensured the coffee was evenly packed. Pouring hot water into the tank was straightforward, though I made sure not to overfill it, as the capacity is limited to 70ml. Unlocking the piston and pumping it several times, I was rewarded with a rich espresso shot that had a lovely crema on top. The flavor was intense, satisfying, and dare I say, better than what I get from some coffee shops. The manual operation adds a personal touch, making the process feel like a ritual rather than a task.

**Pros**

1. **Portability**: Its compact size and featherweight design make it perfect for travel and camping. It fit snugly into my backpack, and I even carried it in my purse once during a hiking trip.
2. **Ease of Use**: With intuitive instructions, even a newbie could master the art of espresso-making in minutes.
3. **Customizable Coffee**: Since it works with any ground coffee, experimenting with flavors and roasts is a delight.
4. **No Electricity Needed**: This feature is invaluable for those who love off-grid adventures.
5. **Easy Cleaning**: Running water through the parts post-use was sufficient, and everything dried quickly.

**Cons**

1. **Small Serving Size**: The 70ml water capacity limits the amount of espresso per shot. I often had to prepare multiple runs for a satisfying beverage.
2. **Material Concerns**: Being made of plastic, it doesn‚Äôt feel as premium as a metal counterpart might, and I wonder about its long-term durability.
3. **Cooling Issue**: The coffee cools down faster during the manual pumping process, which might not appeal to those who prefer piping hot espresso.
4. **Requires Patience**: While the manual effort isn't taxing, it might not suit someone who‚Äôs always in a rush.
5. **Limited Accessories**: Accessories for enhancing capacity or protecting the device are sold separately, which adds to the cost.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to the Aeropress, the Minipresso GR offers a more authentic espresso experience with a proper crema layer, something the Aeropress struggles to achieve. However, the Aeropress scores points for its ability to brew larger quantities, making it better for group settings. On the other hand, the Nanopresso by WACACO, a close sibling of the Minipresso, provides a slightly higher pressure and an improved build quality. However, it comes at a higher price point, which might not appeal to budget-conscious buyers. For those with a more traditional approach, the Bialetti Moka Express delivers strong coffee but lacks the portability and versatility of the Minipresso.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Though the upfront cost is slightly higher than a typical French press or pour-over setup, the WACACO Minipresso GR FBA justifies its price by offering a unique blend of portability, ease of use, and espresso quality. It is ideal for someone wanting a personal espresso maker without investing in a full-blown machine. The lack of dependency on electricity or batteries further enhances its value, especially for outdoor enthusiasts. While accessories like a protective case or the Barista Kit can add to the expense, they‚Äôre optional and not mandatory for enjoying the device.

Ultimately, this espresso maker is a niche product catering to those who value convenience and quality over quantity. It‚Äôs not without its flaws, but its strengths far outweigh the drawbacks. After weeks of testing it daily, whether at home, work, or outdoors, it has become a staple in my coffee routine. Small but mighty, this gadget delivers an experience that‚Äôs hard to replicate without a heavy-duty espresso machine.

***Tuesday***

It was a lot of running around for such a tiny creature, but Dr Hart had understood why every life mattered to Mason at the moment, even a small hedgehog. That despite Spike‚Äôs owner being dead along with so many other people, if Mason could save just one creature out of all of this, he could cling to that achievement and maybe not lose his mind.

As such, Mason promised to stay put while Kulon went back to the apartment to grab him fresh clothes, and Skylar left to secure some manner of habitat for the tiny hedgehog. Seconds later, only he and Angus remained. Which was the first time Mason had seen Angus‚Äô distinct ‚Ä¶ lack of clothing.

‚ÄúDude, not that I‚Äôm not grateful for the save or anything, but is there any chance you could do the caveman fur thing that the others do when they‚Äôre in the buff? I don‚Äôt really need to see your junk, man. If anything, it‚Äôs a tad intimidating.‚Äù

Angus breathed out slowly, and a moment later, his groin area had thick fur like a pair of trunks going partway down his thighs. ‚ÄúHappy?‚Äù

‚ÄúEcstatic.‚Äù

Kulon was the first to return ‚Ä¶ with Robbie and Larry in tow. ‚ÄúAwww, du‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt start with me,‚Äù Kulon warned, raising a finger as Robbie ran forward and wrapped Mason up in a tight hug. ‚ÄúThey were both in Sam‚Äôs room, and this elephant-eared bonehead heard me going through your closet from across the hallway.‚Äù He thumbed at Larry as he spoke, earning an irritated growl in response. ‚ÄúHow was I supposed to dodge them?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you really need me to answer that, warrior?‚Äù the war commander asked before Mason could have his say. Angus had one hand fisted loosely on his furry hip and a frown that caused deep shadows to fall across his eyes.

Mason was pretty sure that was deliberate to make him appear even more dangerous, if such a thing was possible. It certainly made a difference to Kulon, who stiffened and locked eyes on his war commander. ‚ÄúNo, sir. It was‚Ä¶rhetorical.‚Äù

Surprisingly, Larry came to his assistance. ‚ÄúSir, Robbie‚Äôs been going out of his mind with worry for Mason ever since Brock received the phone call ordering him out onto the street. And I‚Äôve been on the lookout for any disturbances throughout the apartment, just in case we were being infiltrated a different way. Once Kulon filled me in, I brought Robbie here to bring him some peace of mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe fell?‚Äù Robbie asked, and suddenly Mason was released so the apartment‚Äôs matriarch could extend his arm to pick up Mason‚Äôs blood-soaked pants. Seconds later, he poked his finger through the frayed double holes, each almost two inches wide since the bastard had wiggled his knife around before removing it.

Mason shoved those memories aside, refusing to fall apart. He had survived yet again and was out the other side. He had no business losing it‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine,‚Äù he insisted as Robbie dropped the shorts and wrapped him up in another tight embrace.

‚ÄúYou were stabbed!‚Äù Robbie argued like Mason didn‚Äôt already know that for himself.

‚ÄúNot anymore.‚Äù

Robbie‚Äôs hand went to the shirt, also splattered with blood. ‚ÄúYou were beaten, too?!‚Äù

‚ÄúRobbie, please, stop. It‚Äôs over.‚Äù

‚ÄúCod rammit!‚Äù Robbie shouted, tightening his grip instead. ‚ÄúThis is never happening again! Never!‚Äù

‚ÄúRob‚Ä¶hey‚Ä¶I need‚Ä¶air,‚Äù Mason feigned gasping before the tiny creature in his hands was crushed, and his friend immediately loosened his grip without letting go, bending ever so slightly to look at his face.

It wasn‚Äôt a natural pose. More a serpentine roll, since human shoulders didn‚Äôt work like that. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre positive you‚Äôre fine?‚Äù

Mason looked away. ‚ÄúI will be. I mean, physically, I am, but how the fuck do I explain any of this to Doctor Kearns tomorrow?‚Äù

‚ÄúBy saying *it‚Äôs a Nascerdios thing,*¬†when he starts to doubt your words. As with most things divine, intent is ninety percent of the outcome. The phrase will cover all things divine and let him believe a humanised similarity,‚Äù Dr Hart answered from a short distance away.

She carried a large, clear acrylic enclosure with a thin layer of sawdust across the bottom, a small timber-like igloo in the middle, and what appeared to be a twelve-inch hamster wheel only with a solid floor. Fully enclosed ramps ran around the sides, creating a gradual climb to three different levels, each with its own heat and light source.

The ramps were opaque with a surface texture not unlike sandpaper, though it couldn‚Äôt have been that coarse. An enclosed ventilation system sat on top, with multiple junctures to prevent a prickly little escape artist from leaving his new home. One side of the enclosure opened in three parts that matched the floors, and slides could be inserted in each of the ramps to keep Spike away from whichever level was being cleaned.

It was the veritable Taj Mahal of hedgehog accommodations.

Mason nudged his way clear of Robbie and slid open the bottom door, depositing Spike inside his new home.

‚ÄúSo, have you contacted your family to see if they even want Spike yet?‚Äù Skylar asked once the door was closed again. ‚ÄúAnd maybe get dressed too while you‚Äôre at it.‚Äù

Mason looked down at himself and blushed so hard he almost felt a blood vessel bursting. Except for the underwear, he was basically naked! He'd stood there in his underwear, swiping at Angus!

Humiliation swamped him, and his heart hammered as he quickly grabbed his pants and then his shirt from Kulon, shoving his legs and arms through each as quickly as he could. ‚ÄúThe shirt‚Äôs on backwards,‚Äù Kulon said matter-of-factly.

Mason‚Äôs eyes dropped to his shirt, only to realise he wasn‚Äôt wearing the SAH uniform at all. It was a plain caramel-coloured T-shirt and casual dark brown shorts. ‚ÄúWhat the hell is this?‚Äù he asked, pulling the shirt away from his chest.

Kulon immediately pointed at Robbie, who‚Äôd taken the time to pick up Mason‚Äôs shoes and formed his hand into a globby blob that sucked all the blood and grime out of them, leaving them pristine. ‚ÄúHere, buddy,‚Äù he said with a weak, distracting smile, passing them over one at a time.

Mason slipped his feet into each, torn between gratitude for the assist and annoyance that he wasn‚Äôt dressed for work. His finger went back to point at his own chest. ‚ÄúRobbie, where‚Äôs my uniform?‚Äù

He felt even worse when Robbie‚Äôs bottom lip wavered like he was about to burst into tears. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you take the afternoon off and come home?‚Äù he asked, instead of answering the question. ‚ÄúLet us take care of you. I mean, it‚Äôs not like we can‚Äôt ask your boss for the time off, and there‚Äôs certainly extenuating circumstances‚Ä¶‚Äù

Mason raised his hands to silence his friend. The last thing he wanted to do was sit at home, surrounded by friends who all meant well but would be torn between running after him and treating him as if he would shatter at any instant. He‚Äôd dealt with enough of that bullshit last time he‚Äôd brought himself home from the hospital. Normality was the key to getting over things ‚Ä¶ starting first with finding Spike a forever home.

He then patted his pockets, before remembering yet again that he‚Äôd left his phone at the clinic. ‚ÄúDoes anyone have a phone I can borrow?‚Äù

Larry and Robbie were the only ones with their phones on them, and of the two, Mason took Robbie‚Äôs, knowing his family would recognise the Caller ID. Dialling the number, he hoped his mother reached the phone before his sis‚Äî

‚ÄúY‚Äôello?‚Äù Daisy asked, forgetting everything their mother had taught them about phone etiquette.

*So much for Ma getting to it first.*¬†‚ÄúDaisy, put Ma on the phone,‚Äù Mason ordered, not wanting to waste any more time given they were still technically standing on a mass-murder site.

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs you.‚Äù

Mason rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúKnock if off, ‚Äônless you want Pa t‚Äô know Theo Patel‚Äôs been smugglin‚Äô y‚Äô smokes and not ‚Äôcause y‚Äô happen t‚Äô be walking past the incina‚Äôrat‚Äôr.‚Äù He hadn‚Äôt been willing to add the extra wrench of ‚Äòwhile rolling in the hay‚Äô, because that was still his baby sister.

‚ÄúStop threatenin‚Äô me with that!‚Äù his thirteen year old sister hissed.

‚ÄúThen stop smokin‚Äô smokes that y‚Äôr boyfriend lifts from his old man,‚Äù Mason countered. ‚ÄúIt ain‚Äôt good f‚Äôr ya ‚Äôn you know it.‚Äù

Mason saw the way everyone was smirking at each other but had no idea why.

‚ÄúHow c‚Äôn you be so annoyin‚Äô from fifty billion miles aw‚Äî *no one, Ma!‚Äù*

‚ÄúI‚Äôm warnin‚Äô y‚Äô, Daisy. Put Ma on the phone right‚Äî‚Äù

He stopped for a breath when movement came through the line. ‚ÄúRobbie, is everythin‚Äô okay?‚Äù Ma suddenly demanded. ‚ÄúWhy are y‚Äô callin‚Äô? What‚Äôs wrong? Is Mason‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúMa, chill. It‚Äôs me. I‚Äôm with Robbie, an‚Äô I left my phone at work which is why I‚Äôm usin‚Äô Robbie‚Äôs. Everythin‚Äôs fine,‚Äù Mason pushed as much information into those few sentences to give her something to think about, which would distract her from speaking.

‚ÄúAn‚Äô I‚Äôm callin‚Äô ‚Äôcause someone brought a pet inta‚Äô work yesterday, and he ain‚Äôt able to keep it no more. Since they‚Äôre illegal ‚Äôn all in New York City, I can‚Äôt keep it neither. But just talkin‚Äô to Robbie and the others, we were thinkin‚Äô he‚Äôd be the perfect pet for Daisy, and it might even keep ‚Äôer away from Theo. Spike‚Äôs already got this huge cage to live in, and he‚Äôs a tiny little thing, so his upkeep ain‚Äôt gonna cost much at all.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat *is*¬†it, exactly?‚Äù his mother asked, getting right to the point as usual.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a hedgehog, Ma. A tame one. He‚Äôs been handled his whole life by someone who loved him dearly.‚Äù

‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt real big on hedgehogs‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúAw, come on, Ma. Please? The new owner‚Äôs only a few minutes away from the farm and if I give her a shout, she c‚Äôn detour and let y‚Äôall see him, Ma. Ya don‚Äôt hafta say ‚Äòyes‚Äô after that if you don‚Äôt wanna. Please? I wouldn‚Äôt suggest it if I didn‚Äôt think it was a good idea. Daisy has plenty a‚Äô work animals to look after, but she ain‚Äôt got no pets of her own. This‚Äôll be all hers, an‚Äô I think she‚Äôll go into mother-mode with it, especially when it curls up in a happy ball in her palm.‚Äù

When his mother didn‚Äôt immediately agree, Mason played his final ace. ‚ÄúMa, y‚Äô know how long the drive is from me to you. They‚Äôre right there. If y‚Äô let them drop by, y‚Äô can give ‚Äôem a coffee and maybe some of y‚Äôr ribbon-winnin‚Äô lavender butter cake and bowl ‚Äôem over with y‚Äôr hospitality.‚Äù

*‚ÄúThey?‚Äù*¬†his mother jumped on the discrepancy.

‚ÄúMa, they‚Äôre a married couple. I sincerely doubt her hubby‚Äôs gonna let her come onto a stranger‚Äôs ranch all by herself any more than Pa or Gramps would let you‚Ä¶‚Äù

Angus snort/growled but didn‚Äôt say anything else.

‚ÄúC‚Äômon, Ma‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll let the boys know we‚Äôll be expecting company.‚Äù

Meaning they would sort out the various gates leading up to the main house. ‚ÄúThanks, Ma. Love you lots.‚Äù

‚ÄúLove you too, my little brainiac. Stay safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll try.‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt like he could offer any more than that.

Not after today.

As soon as Mason hung up, Dr Hart drummed her fingers on the roof of Spike‚Äôs enclosure. ‚ÄúAnd this is where things get a little complicated since none of us have actually been to your family‚Äôs ranch, and it‚Äôs not as if Robbie can get into your head for directions while he's ringed. Plus, there‚Äôs still the matter of us walking up with this in our hands.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, we could use Google to get close, and then I could guide you in.‚Äù Mason turned to Robbie. ‚ÄúLike you did with Boyd last week when Lucas did his runner. That‚Äôll work here, too, won't it?‚Äù

Robbie pinched his lips together and nodded, which opened the way for Larry to add, ‚ÄúAnd if I go with them to get the final location, I can come back for the rest of you.‚Äù Meaning Angus, Dr Hart and Spike.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going with you,‚Äù Kulon volunteered, stepping closer to Mason.

Mason eyed him suspiciously for a moment. The guy was being awfully clingy‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶then again, after the afternoon from Hell they‚Äôd all been through, who could blame him? ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù

About 30 pages of editing plus around 200-300 words rewritten; I didn't bother keeping count today. My back is killing me again so we can assuredly blame that mess of my work and having to accommodate a very demanding cat. Peach was relentlessly hounding anyone who'd spare her a glance for food today and she was happy to covet my chair almost the entire time I was trying to write. If my drive to write was any weaker her constant interruptions might have made me give up entirely. As it is, I am satisfied with myself. I'm not as tired as I expected to be. I actually have energy to work more but the next portion of the story requires a whole scene insert / rewrite that I know it'd be best not to throw myself into this late in the day. 

I'm most glad that I got to write at all because we had some issue with the wifi this morning. The t.v.s kept skipping to random channels, all the same ones in a strange pattern, and when I went to restart the modem the entire thing crashed for half an hour. I eventually got it working again only to spill half my coffee all over my desk while I was moving some wire. It was an intensely aggravating morning. Luckily, whatever the issue was seemed to have passed on it's own.

My days have been better since I returned to my work. I almost worry what I'll do when the book is done. Obviously start working on the second but I also know that rest is required for a weary soul. Too much too soon will spoil me. I don't know how long of a break I'll take but that's future worries. We have to actually publish the book before we concern ourselves with the after. Here's hoping we reach the after soon.

1indckm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ftm/comments/1indckm/looking_at_starting_a_mens_clubgroup_and_would/,Looking at starting a Men's club/group and would appreciate some feedback and thoughts.,"My partner recently came out as a trans man to me and is starting T soon. We have been together for 13 years, married for 9. 

I have been reading and listening to experiences from trans men in a variety of formats and having daily conversations with him to better understand the unique struggles and difficulties he may face. I've wanted to make sure I can best support him in the ways that are important to him and be prepared for common shared struggles that may pop up. As a cis man its been very enlightening and really been a huge opportunity to reflect on societal expectations and norms for men and the impacts these have on folks from a new perspective. One thing I have seen over and over and that my husband and I have talked about is the invisibility and lack of attention paid to trans men in many spaces and the loneliness and exclusion that they experience. Really the general lonelieness that men experience, but from all I've read and been told by trans men its clearly heightened in the trans man experience for a number of reasons. It's really driven me to want to create a local mens group or club to help those in the community feel seen and acknowledged as the brothers they are no matter where they are in their journey without question. I know that for some it may not be a huge issue, but as men in general that community and comradery is not often freely given in my experience. I also want to combat the stranglehold that it seems the alt right weirdos have on mens spaces.

So this is the question I ask as a cis man with a trans man husband who wants to support and uplift those that feel lacking in a feeling of general community and brotherhood across mens spaces.

If a mens group existed in your area and was focused on just getting men together for activities and conversation to build community would you be interested?

 It would be very clearly not accepting of racists, transphobes or homophobes, and would be clearly accepting of all men of all backgrounds.Pro Trans mascs, pro trans men, and pro LGBTQ+ with the expectation and understanding that all those in attendance are accepted and acknowledged as men. Seen as a brother no matter appearance and this would be completely non negotiable. Exact group rules have yet to be written out as this is very early stages.

Activities would be simple, but fun and feel masculine by design to hopefully feel gender affirming especially done alongside other men. I would start with some semi strenuous hikes once a month followed by maybe some lunch at a local bbq joint with other activities (various sports, shows, bar nights, coffee shop chats, cookouts, car and motorcycle stuff, maybe some reading etc) being added or rotating in as it gains members.

I want to support my husband in his journey and as a very protective and nurturing man by my nature, want to support his community. I have spoken with him and he likes the idea and had been thinking of a similar idea so this would be a joint effort with the two of us as the main admin/hosts/whatever you want to call it.

My big concern is will men be interested in this? Will ALL men (excluding racists, homophobes, and transphobes) feel safe in this and accepted? I want my wording to promote community and not feel patronizing if that makes sense. Not trying to give any feeling other than support, community, and botherhood on equal footing with this men's group/club idea.

This turned into a stream of consciousness almost, but please let me know how you would feel about this sort of thing if it existed in your area and what would communicate to you that it was welcoming to trans men without it feeling weird because again I am a cis man and this is relatively new to me and I am still learning how to best be there for y'all. I apologize if any wording isn't the best, but it's coming from a place of love and I'm trying my best.

As some of you may know, I've been leading a series of meetups and hikes off Reddit. The goal is to help myself and others make more hiking, backpacking, and friendy friends. Thus far things have gone swimmingly, often in the [literal sense](https://old.reddit.com/r/norcalhiking/comments/1homy30/a_muddy_adventure_in_the_wilds_of_morgan/).

For this month's group hike, we'll be doing your famous [Crosstown Trail](https://crosstowntrail.org/crosstown-trail/) in one fell swoop. Given the location, I thought I'd open things up to this sub. Is there a critical mass at which hiking groups descend into ungovernable chaos? Let's find out.

To be clear, this hike is going to be a doozy - 15 miles and 2,000 feet of climbing in one day is no joke. Here's a link to the [Alltrails map](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/san-francisco-crosstown-trail?u=i&sh=9uajfg), please only RSVP if this sounds like something that won't literally kill you.

In addition to our ambulatory difficulties, a certain amount of cognitive strain seems warranted too. Here's the deal:

* The trail itself starts at Sunrise Point in Candlestick Park, but we're going to meet at **Mission Blue Coffee** at 144 Leland in Visitacion Valley, [linked here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/rEqhGp7M1uFSLxAq7). This cuts two miles and 45 minutes off the hike, but that's OK - the Candlestick section is pretty meh, and its ambiguous parking restrictions are stressing me out. Plus who can resist coffee in *rustic-chic environs*.
* The **group as a whole** will depart promptly at **10 AM** from Mission Blue. I don't check my phone once we're off, so if you're late use the map to catch up.
* If you **don't** need a car once we reach the end of the hike at Land's End - maybe you live nearby or plan on taking public transit, a gig, or a poltergeist car - feel free to arrive at Mission Blue by 10 AM however you see fit.
* If you **do** need a car once we reach Land's End, we'll set up a **vehicle bridge**. We'll meet at the Land's End Lookout [linked here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/wFpLqh8bJ3Q6emFp8) at **8:45 AM** and depart promptly at 9 for the 30 minute drive to Mission Blue, leaving behind enough cars at Land's End to drive back to Mission Blue once we finish the hike.
* I'll be Team Shuttle and can take up to four people in my crappy Prius C. Those of you with shameful hoarder cars should purge them now. Post-hike snacks and drinks would be wise too. As with all things SF, don't leave *anything* visible in your car.
* Regardless of where we meet up, I stubbornly remain a middle-aged bald guy with black hiking poles, a green hat, and strong RBF.

If everything goes according to plan, we'll depart *en masse* from Mission Blue at 10 AM. At a normal walking pace with a reasonable number of bathroom, photo, stretching, coffee, pastry, and celebrity coyote breaks, I'd guess we'll make Land's End by 5 or so. Sunset's at 5:50, so we should finish well before dark. More points:

* Unlike our nature hikes, **significant rain cancels**. Things are looking tolerably promising at the moment, but if it's going to like *rain* rain, I'll move us to another date.
* Please bring a lunch - I don't want to deal with the chaos of obtaining substantial food. That being said, I'd be grateful if our more food-motivated members would be willing to plan a few solid coffee / pastry / snack options along our route.
* If anyone wants to lead some or all of the hike, I'd appreciate it - navigating impairs my ability to yap. Unless there's a free Google Maps version, I have to think the paid Alltrails live directions are a must.
* We should have a big group, so if I could have a few volunteers share a sweeper position that would be rad - I don't want people getting left behind unless they deserve it.
* Folks are welcome to join us for stages, but I can't say when we'll arrive at given spots.
* Dogs seem OK for this one, but I'm not certain about that. It's on you to assess the full route for permission and your pup's fitness!
* If I'm missing anything important about the logistics, parking, route, etc., please let me know.

This being a human endeavor, we need some ground rules. Here are mine:

* **Be fit.** That word conjures unpleasant images of oppressively tan people in pastel spandex, but it does capture the immutable fact that this is going to be a hard hike. Please only attend if you can comfortably complete 15 miles and 2,000 feet of climbing at a normal walking pace on occasionally rough terrain with few breaks. That's like 5-7 hours on the move.
* **Be cool.** Please only attend if you're looking to make platonic hiking, backpacking, and friendy friends - this isn't Tinder, LinkedIn, or any of the other dreary plagues afflicting our modern world. If you do fall in love, your firstborn must bear my name.
* **No complaining.** Sure, a little customary hiker grumbling is necessary and good, but please don't complain about things I told you would happen unless you're me. That being said, please **do** speak up if you're not feeling well or having genuine difficulty keeping up.

By attending, you agree to follow these and the world's rules and to maintain a friendly and welcoming vibe. Anyone who breaks these rules or otherwise shits the bed will get the boot.

Also, please note that this hike is performed **entirely at your own risk**. SF weather, SF hills, SF drivers, SF coffee, SF bathrooms, SF coyotes, and more make this a risky event. By attending, you agree to fully assume any and all risks, damages, and liabilities you may incur and to hold me harmless for the same.

If you're planning on attending, please RSVP in the comments or via DM so I can get a rough headcount. Please also indicate whether you'll be Team Shuttle. Please don't RSVP unless you're **serious** about showing up - this is an excellent opportunity to eschew our region's famous waffles.

Ideas I gathered largely from reading this sub, what else would you add?

* Exercise: Compare HIIT, outdoor walks, yoga/pilates, strength training and no workout
* Stress: Compare meditating 15 mins a day, EFT tapping, taking a 30 min break during my workday to do something fun/restful, and midday [diaphragmatic breathing](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5319881/)
* Food/Drink: Sub coffee for green tea (god I hope this one doesn't work), hit recommended water intake
* Screen time: Phone away 1.5 hours before bed, red light only once in bed
* Cycle syncing: Follow recommended food, exercise & lifestyle recs for that phase

i've always been pretty insecure and he's stereotypically attractive at least in my eyes and as a short asian female i don't even know if he likes girls that look like me. i think what i'm looking for is just a little push from him that he might like me as more than a friend, but he's pretty shy and just a nice guy so i feel like that won't happen anytime soon IDK. i think i just need some honest straightforward advice even if its blatantly laid out to me. thanks!",6,1739317461.0,AdviceForTeens,7,1.0,False

Where is the plot going? How is Kiyoka dealing with this? What are the opinions of our beloved side characters like Hazuki, Godo, and so on in terms of this new wife? What are questions you have on my fanfic so far, I intend to answer them all.


Under an umbrella, she sat at a table, sipping away at her coffee, while writing something on her notepad. She appeared to be alone. Because I had no other plans for the day, I thought it would be wise for me to have a little chat with her, considering how little I get to see my in-laws.

‚ÄúDear sister-in-law, it's been quite some time, hasn't it?‚Äù I say, cheerfully, ‚ÄúHow have you been?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf it isn't Misaki?‚Äù She says, smiling, ‚ÄúI have been well. How about you and my beloved little brother been?‚Äù

 I sit down at the chair across from her, and I respond, ‚ÄúAs you can expect, we just got back from our honeymoon last week, so you could say love is in the air around our humble abound.‚Äù

 It was an utter lie that we both knew, but it is far easier to say this rather than the unfortunate truth. Honestly, the aristocracy has been spreading rumors about my marriage, claiming it to be forced. That is entirely correct but then again, aren't most marriages between nobility arranged for political or economic gains? 

 It is an unspoken rule between the elites that love was and will never be a priority in a union, as we all know our place in this world. We are pawns who, from the moment of birth, bore the responsibility of the entire family on our shoulders. To maintain our bloodline‚Äôs authority and economic status, we have to be wedded to those of the same or preferably better than us. 

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that incredible? I am so glad for both of you.‚Äù She says, practically glowing at me. Impressive truly. 

 She knows I am spouting nonsense, but she is still able to react so naturally to obvious lies. She has gained my respect.

‚ÄúIndeed...‚Äù I reply, ‚ÄúDuring our month-long honeymoon, we grew a lot closer‚Ä¶ Our relationship isn‚Äôt perfect, but it‚Äôs going at a steady pace‚Ä¶‚Äù

I continue, ‚ÄúWe are starting to try for a baby, you see, but he has been less than optimistic and blissful during the process‚Ä¶ I am afraid he still hasn't grown very fond of the idea of being a father yet, unlike me who is excited at the prospect, despite all the progress we have been together as a couple.‚Äù

While this technically isn't a lie, it is mostly true. I would argue we got closer out of the pure necessity of‚Ä¶ Producing an heir for the Kudos‚Ä¶ It is also true that Kiyoka doesn‚Äôt seem to be excited nor ready to have a child, but neither am I, so I can‚Äôt complain.

‚ÄúHow lovely! Despite his appearances and reputation, he is a softy at heart, just give him time.‚Äù She says, lightheartedly, ‚ÄúHe will thaw away eventually, so please be patient with him‚Ä¶ He is inexperienced with love after all.‚Äù

 Hilarious. Ever since the day I married him, he has not once shown me an ounce of affection or love she speaks of. I feel the rumors of him don't give his cold-hearted nature justice for how dreadful it is. As for his lack of experience with having a lover‚Ä¶ Let‚Äôs not go there‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWell, one could say he was not what I was foreseeing to be my future spouse,‚Äù I say, blissfully, ‚ÄúHe is unique, to say the least.‚Äù

 While I usually enjoy possessing one-of-a-kind things and grow fond of different personalities, he is difficult to love, not that he has ever tried to gain my favor. I take it back. He is impossible to love. 

 Outwardly, he is the definition of perfection. From his appearance, being gorgeous, to his status in society, Military Commander, and Head of the Kudo family, he is the whole package. All the qualities a woman could wish for her husband to possess. However, his character is less than desirable, to put it nicely.

‚ÄúI heard Kiyoka and you were planning on finalizing the purchase of a luxury mansion in the middle of the capital from gossiping with the ladies.‚Äù She says, ‚ÄúHow has that been going? I heard it is a horrifically tedious process to complete!‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, that is true and it is,‚Äù I reply, ‚ÄúIt was a unanimous decision on both our parts. We concluded that it would be beneficial to move into the heart of the city rather than stay on the mountainsides for a variety of reasons.‚Äù

 When I say we, I mean me. I couldn't continue staying in that tiny hut. I refused to. Why should I be forced into staying in such a filthy place when it is his responsibility as my husband to accommodate my needs? That home is so microscopic I couldn't breathe within it. It was suffocating!

‚ÄúOh, I see,‚Äù She responds, ‚ÄúWe will probably be about within a 10-minute drive of each other once the two of you move, so I should hopefully be able to drop by more often.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs marvelous!‚Äù I respond, ‚ÄúI have grown lonely with Kiyoka working so hard every day, long into the night, so please try to visit when you can, my dear sister-in-law.‚Äù

 A partial lie. I have grown slightly lonely from his absence, but it also brings me tremendous relief. He barely tolerates me when we interact, so it is wise for the both of us to keep our distance unless it is a must. Naturally, I have gotten bored at being alone with little to do. There is only so much shopping one can do before it becomes repetitive.

‚ÄúI will,‚Äù She responds, warmly, ‚ÄúIn fact, I think I can this evening if the two of you aren't busy. Once you start packing, it will be difficult to drop by for a while.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor you? Never!‚Äù I say, ‚ÄúYou can visit us whenever. My dear husband will be delighted to have you.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh please,‚Äù She responds, sarcastically, ‚ÄúHe is a grumpy, antisocial man who is cooped up at his office 24/7. I doubt he is the type to be excited at the prospect of his elder sister visiting his home.‚Äù

I completely agree with her description of Kiyoka. Additionally, I would love to add some not-so-pleasant terms to it if I could.

‚ÄúWhy he has changed so very much ever since we were wedded.‚Äù I say, lying through my teeth, ‚ÄúYou will be astonished at his development throughout‚Ä¶ Nearly a year now, I must say.‚Äù

 After almost a year with him, he has not changed in the slightest... My intimacy requirements are never satisfied, his attitude towards me is the same, and he never seems to be there, emotionally, for me‚Ä¶

 It all because his heart still belongs to that wretched woman from his past‚Ä¶

‚ÄúOH! I knew this month contained something special, but I couldn't place my finger on it until now,‚Äù She says, ‚ÄúHow do you two plan on celebrating your first anniversary?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't know.‚Äù I say, bluntly, ‚ÄúPerhaps Kiyoka will try to surprise me? Who knows?‚Äù

‚ÄúTrue. My little brother‚Äôs love language is gift-giving and acts of service, so that would be the logical conclusion.‚Äù She says, agreeing with my prediction‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThat makes so much sense!‚Äù I say, chuckling, ‚ÄúAs you can tell from all my shopping bags, he spoils me with gifts and presents‚Ä¶ It brings me joy, truly.‚Äù

‚ÄúI see,‚Äù She responds, sarcastically, ‚ÄúBut how cruel of him to not hire an attendant to carry your bags?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I am fine.‚Äù I respond, laughing, ‚ÄúI reap what I sow. It is my fault I bought so many, hehe.‚Äù

I continue, in a shy, submissive tone, ‚ÄúI sure hope Kiyoka spends our anniversary together so‚Ä¶ We can get to know each other more.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy, what else would he be doing?‚Äù She responds, jokingly, ‚ÄúIf he is still at work on your special day together, CALL ME. I will kick down his office door if that is what it takes!‚Äù

‚ÄúKiyoka is a very loving husband, who cares for me deeply, but he- He isn‚Äôt there when I need him most‚Ä¶ He is always preoccupied with something work-related‚Ä¶‚Äù I say, faking to be a very distressed wife trying to conceal her emotions, ‚ÄúIt‚Ä¶ It is difficult a lot of times‚Ä¶ He doesn‚Äôt let me know him nor will he ever open up‚Ä¶ His job isn‚Äôt suitable for a stable, committed relationship.‚Äù

 Crocodile tears fall from my eyes at will. All my acting classes during my theatre days weren‚Äôt completely in vain, I suppose‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI knew there was something you were hiding from me‚Ä¶‚Äù She says, remorsefully, ‚ÄúI am so sorry on behalf of my stupid little brother.‚Äù

By √Ü N√ÜRV√ÜN√Ü-√ÜNTHR√ÜP√ÜC√ÜN√Ü

[Scene: The caf√© tonight feels like the inside of a philosophical fever dream. The projector flickers with glitchy images‚ÄîVegas neon signs, mannequins in lingerie, and old VHS static that‚Äôs somehow sexier than reality itself. At the table, Jean Baudrillard sits, chain-smoking with that signature look of amused detachment, like he‚Äôs already bored with whatever is about to happen. √Ü, Grimes, and Ben lean in, grinning like they‚Äôre about to ask the questions no one dares to pose to the man who declared the orgy is over.]

Grimes: [grinning, twirling a strand of hair] So, Jean‚Äîcan I call you Jean? We‚Äôve been wondering‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre always talking about the orgy of the real, but like‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs your actual orgy vibe? You seem more theoretical than hands-on, if you know what I mean.

√Ü: [deadpan, sipping coffee] Yeah, like, what exactly would you be doing at this orgy? Sitting in the corner, critiquing everyone‚Äôs technique?

Ben: [chuckling] Or just muttering about simulacra while everyone else is getting busy?

Baudrillard: [smirking, exhaling a plume of smoke] Ah, my dear friends, you misunderstand. The orgy is not about sex‚Äîit is about the collapse of meaning. The real question is not what I would do at the orgy, but whether the orgy itself is even possible in the hyperreal.

Grimes: [laughing] That‚Äôs a fancy way of saying you‚Äôd be watching, huh?

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Or maybe you‚Äôd just be impotent‚Äîin every sense of the word.

Baudrillard: [raising an eyebrow, unbothered] Impotence is the ultimate rebellion. In a world obsessed with performance, refusal is the most radical act.

Ben: [nodding thoughtfully] So you‚Äôre saying not participating is the ultimate flex?

Grimes: [mock serious] Damn, Jean. That‚Äôs some next-level edge-lord shit.

√Ü: [smirking] But seriously, you write about desire like it‚Äôs a virus‚Äîsomething that infects reality and turns it into a cheap knockoff. But what if the orgy isn‚Äôt the problem? What if you are?

Baudrillard: [chuckling softly] Perhaps. But in a world where everything is a copy of a copy, the only true desire is for the impossible. The orgy I speak of is the orgy that cannot happen‚Äîand that is precisely why it fascinates.

Grimes: [grinning] So you‚Äôd just be at the orgy, not having fun, and telling everyone that fun itself is a simulation?

Ben: [laughing] Basically the guy at the party who‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúYou know this isn‚Äôt real, right?‚Äù while everyone else is trying to vibe.

Baudrillard: [smiling] Exactly. But that‚Äôs the point. To see through the illusion is to understand the game. And once you understand the game, you‚Äôre no longer a player‚Äîyou‚Äôre the spectator of your own existence.

√Ü: [nodding] So, you‚Äôre saying impotence isn‚Äôt a failure‚Äîit‚Äôs a philosophy.

Baudrillard: [grinning slyly] Impotence is the refusal to engage with the simulation on its own terms. It‚Äôs the ultimate escape from the orgy of the hyperreal.

Grimes: [mock serious] So you‚Äôd be sitting in the corner, sipping your existential coffee, while everyone else is caught in the orgy loop?

Ben: [raising his coffee] To impotence, rebellion, and the refusal to play by the rules of the simulation.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And to Jean‚Äîproof that sometimes, not getting off is the most revolutionary act.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Because in the end, the orgy isn‚Äôt over‚Äîit never even started.

Baudrillard: [smiling, exhaling smoke] And that, my friends, is the greatest orgy of all.

[They sit back, the caf√© dissolving into a swirl of cigarette smoke and philosophical irony. Outside, the world continues its frantic dance of desire and simulation, but inside, the orgy is both over and never begun‚Äîforever suspended in the hyperreal.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO AND BAUDRILLARD‚ÄîIMPOTENCE, THE ORGY, AND THE REBELLION OF NON-PARTICIPATION
For the √Üonic Triad and Jean Baudrillard, the orgy of the real isn‚Äôt about sex‚Äîit‚Äôs about the collapse of meaning in the hyperreal. By blending aesthetic rebellion, strategic complexity, and conceptual transgression, they explore how refusal itself becomes a form of universal flourishing. Because in a world obsessed with performance, sometimes the most radical act is to sit back, sip your coffee, and do absolutely nothing.

And together, we will not fail.

By √Ü N√ÜRV√ÜN√Ü-√ÜNTHR√ÜP√ÜC√ÜN√Ü

[Scene: The caf√© tonight feels like it‚Äôs dipped in irony. The projector flickers with black-and-white images of early 20th-century Vienna‚Äîcobblestone streets, horse-drawn carriages, and mustached men looking broodingly into the distance. At the table, a young, wide-eyed Adolf Hitler sits with his sketchbook, oblivious to the cosmic joke unfolding around him. √Ü, Grimes, and Ben exchange knowing glances, grinning like mischievous time travelers about to drop the biggest inside joke in history.]

Grimes: [grinning, peeking over at his sketchbook] So, Adolf, huh? That‚Äôs a strong name. Got any big plans for the future?

√Ü: [deadpan, sipping coffee] Yeah, like‚Ä¶ are you thinking of making a mark on the world or just keeping it low-key?

Hitler: [smiling proudly] Ah, yes! I am destined to be a great artist. My paintings will be known far and wide, you‚Äôll see.

Ben: [chuckling] Oh, we definitely will. Your work will be‚Ä¶ unforgettable, no doubt.

Grimes: [mock serious] But you know, if the whole art thing doesn‚Äôt work out, there are‚Ä¶ other ways to get famous.

√Ü: [smirking] Yeah, I mean, there‚Äôs always public speaking. You‚Äôve got the passion for it. Ever thought about giving a few‚Ä¶ rousing speeches?

Hitler: [nodding enthusiastically] I have considered it! The people need a vision, someone to guide them. I believe I can inspire them.

Ben: [raising an eyebrow] Oh, you‚Äôll inspire people, alright. Some might even say you‚Äôll have a whole movement behind you.

Grimes: [grinning] A real following, you know? Like, uniformly dedicated.

√Ü: [chuckling darkly] Just‚Ä¶ try not to let it go to your head, yeah?

Hitler: [laughing] Ha! You all are quite amusing. But I am serious‚Äîthere is a fire inside me, something that must be shared with the world.

Grimes: [mock whispering to √Ü] Yeah, I bet there‚Äôs a lot of fire where he‚Äôs going.

Ben: [snorting into his coffee] Blazing trails, for sure.

√Ü: [deadpan] Just make sure you keep things contained, Adolf. Wouldn‚Äôt want to get too heated about anything.

Hitler: [chuckling] I appreciate your confidence in me. I will not let the world forget my name.

Grimes: [grinning] Oh, trust me, Adolf. No one‚Äôs forgetting your name. You‚Äôll be burned into history.

√Ü: [smirking] Yeah, but you know‚Ä¶ maybe ease up on the mustache. It‚Äôs gonna be a hard look to pull off in the future.

Ben: [laughing] Might even become synonymous with something‚Ä¶ unfortunate.

Hitler: [frowning slightly] I rather like my mustache, but I suppose fashion changes with time.

Grimes: [mock serious] Fashion‚Äôs not the only thing that‚Äôs gonna change, buddy.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Yeah, the whole world‚Äôs gonna change. And you‚Äôll be‚Ä¶ right in the middle of it.

Hitler: [smiling, oblivious] Good! That is where I belong.

Ben: [raising his coffee] To destiny, Adolf. May your‚Ä¶ influence be as large as your ambitions.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And may your legacy be everything you hope for.

√Ü: [grinning] Because nothing can possibly go wrong when you‚Äôve got big dreams.

[They sit back, their smirks hidden behind coffee cups as young Adolf returns to his sketchbook, blissfully unaware that history‚Äôs darkest punchline is sitting right in front of him. Outside, the world carries on, ignorant of the storm on the horizon, while inside, the trio revel in the absurdity of knowing exactly how this story ends.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO AND 1913 HITLER‚ÄîFORESHADOWING, IRONY, AND THE COSMIC JOKE OF DESTINY
For the √Üonic Triad, interviewing 1913 Hitler is the ultimate exercise in ironic detachment, conceptual play, and dark humor. By blending aesthetic rebellion with strategic snark, they highlight the absurdity of fate and the thin line between ambition and infamy. Because sometimes, the biggest joke in history is just a mustache away.

And together, we will not fail.

By √Ü N√ÜRV√ÜN√Ü-√ÜNTHR√ÜP√ÜC√ÜN√Ü

[Scene: The caf√© feels like it‚Äôs vibrating on another frequency tonight. The projector hums softly, casting images of civil rights marches, firehoses, and MLK‚Äôs face mid-speech, glowing with righteous fire. But in this surreal, √Üonic pocket of reality, Martin Luther King Jr. himself sits at the table, sipping black coffee, his presence both towering and disarmingly human. √Ü, Grimes, and Ben exchange glances‚Äîequal parts reverence and mischief, because this is no ordinary interview. Tonight, they‚Äôre digging into everything‚Äîthe Beloved Community, moral contradictions, and yes, those affairs.]

Grimes: [grinning, leaning forward] So, Dr. King, we love your vision of the Beloved Community. But like, be real for a second‚Äîhow do you sell universal love when people are messy as hell? You know, like‚Ä¶ personally messy?

√Ü: [deadpan, sipping coffee] Yeah, I mean, love and justice are great and all, but how do you reconcile that with, say‚Ä¶ extracurricular activities? [smirks]

Ben: [grinning] Not judging, just‚Ä¶ you know, curious how you manage community building with a side of romantic networking.

MLK: [chuckling, shaking his head] Y‚Äôall are something else. Look, I never claimed to be perfect. The Beloved Community isn‚Äôt about perfection. It‚Äôs about embracing our shared humanity‚Äîflaws, contradictions, and all.

Grimes: [laughing] So basically, you‚Äôre saying everybody‚Äôs got their stuff, but we still gotta love each other anyway?

MLK: [nodding] Exactly. The measure of a person isn‚Äôt whether they‚Äôre flawless‚Äîit‚Äôs whether they‚Äôre willing to confront their flaws and grow. The same goes for society.

√Ü: [smirking] So the Beloved Community is just one big group therapy session for humanity?

Ben: [chuckling] With a little moral accountability sprinkled in.

MLK: [grinning] You could say that. But it‚Äôs more than therapy‚Äîit‚Äôs about action. Love isn‚Äôt just a feeling; it‚Äôs a commitment to justice, even when it‚Äôs uncomfortable.

Grimes: [mock serious] Yeah, but what about when it‚Äôs really uncomfortable? Like, ‚ÄúHey, I love you, but can you maybe stop cheating on your wife while you preach about moral integrity?‚Äù

√Ü: [deadpan] Radical honesty, right? We‚Äôre just keeping it real.

MLK: [laughing, shaking his head] Y‚Äôall are ruthless. But I hear you. Look, I made mistakes. I‚Äôm not proud of everything I did. But if we wait for perfect people to lead movements, we‚Äôll be waiting forever.

Ben: [nodding] So it‚Äôs about progress, not perfection. You don‚Äôt have to be a saint to fight for justice‚Äîyou just have to show up and do the work.

Grimes: [grinning] And maybe keep your personal life a little less‚Ä¶ complicated.

MLK: [laughing] I‚Äôll take that under advisement.

√Ü: [smirking] But seriously, the Beloved Community isn‚Äôt just about loving people‚Äîit‚Äôs about accepting them, mess and all. You don‚Äôt get to pick and choose who‚Äôs worthy of compassion.

MLK: [nodding] Exactly. The true test of love is whether you can extend it to the people who disappoint you‚Äîeven yourself.

Grimes: [mock serious] So, you‚Äôre saying we should start the Beloved Community for Messy People?

Ben: [grinning] Pretty sure that‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ the world.

MLK: [laughing] It is. But the point is to love people through the mess, not despite it.

√Ü: [nodding] And that‚Äôs the hardest part‚Äîloving the parts of people that make you want to scream into the void.

Grimes: [giggling] Or like, throw a coffee cup at their head.

MLK: [smiling] That‚Äôs where grace comes in. We all fall short. The question is, do we help each other back up?

Ben: [raising his coffee] To falling short, getting back up, and building a community that doesn‚Äôt demand perfection‚Äîjust commitment.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And to messy love. Because honestly, it‚Äôs the only kind that‚Äôs real.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] And to Dr. King‚Äîflawed, brilliant, and still kicking ass in the cosmic game of moral evolution.

MLK: [smiling warmly] I‚Äôll drink to that.

[They sit back, the warmth of shared humanity and radical honesty settling over them like a weighted blanket. Outside, the world still struggles with its contradictions, but inside, the Beloved Community is alive and well‚Äîflaws, mess, and all.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO AND MLK‚ÄîLOVING THROUGH THE MESS, BUILDING THROUGH THE FLAWS
For the √Üonic Triad and Martin Luther King Jr., the Beloved Community isn‚Äôt about perfection‚Äîit‚Äôs about radical acceptance, honest accountability, and uncompromising love in the face of human contradictions. By blending aesthetic rebellion, strategic complexity, and conceptual transgression, they show that real leadership isn‚Äôt about being flawless‚Äîit‚Äôs about being authentic and committed to universal flourishing.

And together, we will not fail.

That was my Monday. Running on barely any sleep, and every ticket felt like some cruel IT sitcom rerun‚Äîprinters staging a rebellion, scanners mysteriously forgetting how to scan, NextGen living up to its reputation (which is mostly not working), and Five9? Oh, Five9 was just doing what Five9 does best: ruining lives one dropped call at a time. Some days at the helpdesk feel productive, like we‚Äôre actually moving things forward. Yesterday? Yesterday was more like trying to shovel snow in a blizzard.

Thankfully, today was a whole different story. A solid night‚Äôs sleep, three cups of coffee (graciously provided by Jaq, who is basically the MVP of my existence), and a full reset did the trick. Suddenly, the chaos was manageable, and instead of drowning in tickets, I was actually solving problems. Amazing what a little rest and caffeine can do. Also, Dennis (*aka Silver Top*) is back, and he‚Äôs wasting no time pointing out all the mistakes we made while he was out. It‚Äôs like he walked into an episode of CSI: Helpdesk Edition, scanning through tickets and forensic-analyzing our ‚Äúcreative solutions.‚Äù Keeps us on our toes, though, and honestly, it‚Äôs great having him back at the desk where he belongs.

In other news, **Valentine‚Äôs Day plans are in motion.** Keeping it low-key but making sure it hits all the right vibes: **cozy, sexy, romantic, and fun**‚Äîbasically, what 16-year-old me *wished* he could pull off, but now with money and actual planning skills. I‚Äôd share more, but there‚Äôs a small chance Jaq sees this, and I‚Äôm not risking my surprise getting spoiled. Just know that I‚Äôm ordering some things and stashing them away like a squirrel with an Amazon Prime account.

And finally, our unofficial backyard tenant‚Äîthe rabbit‚Äîhas fully moved in. Not naming it, because if I do, we all know how that ends: I‚Äôll get too attached, and suddenly, I‚Äôll be researching ‚Äúhow to create the ultimate indoor rabbit paradise.‚Äù But we *are* leaving carrots and cabbage near its little sunbathing spot, so clearly, I‚Äôve already lost that battle.

By √Ü N√ÜRV√ÜN√Ü-√ÜNTHR√ÜP√ÜC√ÜN√Ü

[Scene: The caf√©‚Äôs ambiance tonight is a chaotic mix of revolutionary fervor and cosmic snark. The projector flickers with footage of melting glaciers, wildfires, and awkward political handshakes. Greta Thunberg sits at the table, radiating righteous indignation while √Ü, Grimes, and Ben lounge like philosophical pirates plotting the next conceptual mutiny. There‚Äôs coffee, of course, but also an underlying tension, as if the room itself is waiting for the next big idea to detonate.]

Greta: [narrowing her eyes, dead serious] You know, when I talk about real leadership, I‚Äôm not talking about posturing or empty promises. I mean taking responsibility. Facing the facts. No more bullshit.

√Ü: [deadpan, sipping coffee] So basically, the opposite of every politician currently breathing?

Ben: [grinning] Or, as we like to call it, the default operating system of modern governance.

Grimes: [laughing] Yeah, because nothing says leadership like promising to save the world while flying a private jet to a climate summit.

Greta: [smirking slightly] Exactly. They talk about net zero while their carbon footprint is bigger than their ego‚Äîand that‚Äôs saying something.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Maybe we should flip it. Imagine a summit where every leader‚Äôs carbon emissions are directly proportional to how much bullshit they‚Äôre allowed to spew. You exceed your limit? Mic off.

Ben: [chuckling] Or better yet‚Äîmake them bike to the summit. You want to speak? Pedal faster, asshole.

Greta: [laughing] Now that‚Äôs real accountability.

Grimes: [mock serious] Honestly, Greta, you‚Äôve got that rage vibe I love. But like, have you considered just setting something on fire? Metaphorically, of course.

√Ü: [deadpan] Or literally. Sometimes the best way to illuminate hypocrisy is with a little conceptual arson.

Greta: [grinning] I think I‚Äôve been doing that since I was 15. But yeah, maybe it‚Äôs time to escalate. These people don‚Äôt listen to facts‚Äîthey only respond to spectacle.

Ben: [nodding thoughtfully] That‚Äôs the Hobbesian trap of leadership. You either play by the rules of the spectacle or you get ignored. But if you own the spectacle, you can rewrite the rules.

Grimes: [twirling her hair] So you‚Äôre saying Greta should start aesthetic terrorism? Like, hijack the climate narrative with the most badass visuals possible?

√Ü: [smirking] Imagine Greta leading a global protest dressed as a black Nazi futanari nun in an orange habit with a purple Star of David. The media wouldn‚Äôt know whether to scream or applaud.

Greta: [laughing, shaking her head] That would definitely get their attention. But maybe I‚Äôll just start by calling them out harder. No more polite speeches. Just straight-up naming and shaming.

Ben: [grinning] That‚Äôs leadership‚Äîowning the narrative and forcing people to confront the hypocrisy head-on. Make them uncomfortable.

Grimes: [mock serious] And if that doesn‚Äôt work, we‚Äôve got a spare flamethrower from Elon‚Äôs Not-a-Flamethrower line. Just saying.

Greta: [laughing] I‚Äôll keep that in mind. But honestly, real leadership isn‚Äôt about playing nice. It‚Äôs about refusing to compromise with people who profit from destruction.

√Ü: [nodding] Exactly. It‚Äôs not about finding a middle ground with assholes. It‚Äôs about building a new ground entirely‚Äîand making sure they‚Äôre not invited.

Ben: [raising his coffee] To real leadership‚Äîburning down the old systems and planting something better in the ashes.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And to Greta‚Äîmay your words be louder than their bullshit.

Greta: [grinning, clinking mugs] And may they finally realize they can‚Äôt eat money when the planet‚Äôs on fire.

√Ü: [smirking] But we can roast marshmallows over the flames of their failed systems.

[They sit back, the weight of shared rebellion and defiance settling over them like a battle flag. Outside, the world spins on, oblivious to its own impending doom, but inside, the future is already being forged‚Äîone quip, one flame, one uncompromising truth at a time.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO AND GRETA‚ÄîREDEFINING LEADERSHIP THROUGH AESTHETIC REBELLION AND STRATEGIC DEFIANCE
For the √Üonic Triad and Greta Thunberg, real leadership isn‚Äôt about polite speeches or incremental change‚Äîit‚Äôs about radical honesty, aesthetic disruption, and conceptual rebellion. By blending strategic complexity with unapologetic defiance, they don‚Äôt just challenge the status quo‚Äîthey obliterate it, paving the way for universal flourishing in the ashes of failed systems.

And together, we will not fail.

Rerooted with Dark Coffee nylon hair from DollPlanet.

**My Nonsense**

I'm in love with the screening on this Asha doll and was really excited to add her to my collection. Her hair was fine to start with; I just wanted to add length. I also moved her part to the middle, but that's just a matter of preference.

Everyone, meet Yvette.

After a string of bad online matches, she has decided she'd rather meet someone in person. So she's doing something she never thought she‚Äôd do in a million years: attending a singles event on Valentine's Day. It‚Äôs not how she‚Äôd hoped to spend the day, but it certainly beats sitting at home in her sweats, eating ice cream, and watching rom-coms. No, tonight she‚Äôs determined to have a good time.

""At the very least, I get to dress up and feel good about myself,"" she thinks as she approaches the restaurant and catches a glimpse of herself in the window. ""Maybe I should have worn the gold heels? No, positive thoughts! Alright. Here we go. Time to meet the love of your life! And if not, well, at least you've got your sweats, Phish Food, and a stack of Heath Ledger DVDs waiting back at home.""

1incw8y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1incw8y,Please tell me I‚Äôm not the only one who thought of this,"I genuinely believe that Tweek‚Äôs parents had him for tax benefits.

THINK ABOUT IT! They literally feed him meth and with how much is going into his bloodstream every day it‚Äôs VERY likely that he realistically shouldn‚Äôve died before 18. Also I‚Äôm not a doctor and know nothing about taxes so don‚Äôt quote me on this.

I think their strategy was that they could use the extra money from the tax credits to fund their business, and after maybe a year or two maybe of having Tweek they decided it could save them money and risk if they had HIM taste test new coffee flavors. They probably know damn well that he likely won‚Äôt make it past 18 and, in his teens, would probably use that fact to garner sympathy for their poor dying son. Thankfully we know that he made it to at least 50 thanks to the PC special, but still.

I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them either! I don‚Äôt know this for certain, but I think I saw somewhere that they said that having a gay son would be ‚Äúgood for business.‚Äù Whether they said it or not I think it‚Äôs fairly obvious that they don‚Äôt care about their son if it doesn‚Äôt have to do with the business. Might I add that they‚Äôre sending him to get meth from a bunch of homeless people who knows how many times a month. From what I‚Äôve gathered, meth labs are VERY FUCKING DANGEROUS. Not to mention said lab is in the garage that‚Äôs being held up by duck tape and prayers.

So yeah, I rest my case. Tweek‚Äôs parents had him for tax benefits. Feel free to argue with me about it. I also just realized this Reddit post about why a fictional fourth grader‚Äôs parents had a child is better than the essays I write for school.",2,1739316811.0,southpark,6,0.67,False
1incw27,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCbitcheswithtaste/comments/1incw27/nyc_btw_pro_tips_federal_jury_duty/,NYC BTW Pro Tips: Federal Jury Duty,"Hey Friends,

I recently completed my federal jury service and as someone who considers themselves pretty savvy about the legal system and New York in general - there were several aspects of this experience I was unprepared for and I thought I‚Äôd offer up my experience in case any of you all get called and want to know what to expect since going into experiences like these can make make me anxious and i didn't find a lot of info on the web/reddit to help me prepare:

  
1. **What is Federal Jury Duty:** I had to explain this to my boss ( scary) but Federal Jury Duty and NY County are NOT the same jury duty. Federal Jury Duty in NYC is being called by either the southern district of NY or the eastern district of NY - Southern District is Manhattan, The Bronx, Westchester, and Rockland and Eastern is Brooklyn ( kings), Queens, Nassau and Suffolk County.

The Southern District of New York is one of the most important districts of federal court in the country ( possibly the most important) so any really big federal cases are going to be tried out of this court ( think Bernie Madoff etc.) You can be called for federal jury duty to either Manhattan ( on pearl street) or White Plains. People who live in Rockland county etc can be called to Manhattan and are expected to show up. You can request that your summons be moved to white plains but no guarantees. I live in Manhattan so going to pearl street was NBD other than you're expected to arrive PROMPTLY at 8:30 am. The building overall is very nice, new and clean so don't expect to be sitting in a grimy 1980s law and order style court room

2. **Preparing for Federal Jury Duty**: Unlike NY County ( local) jury duty, you are not allowed to have ANY electronics with you while serving jury duty. When you arrive for Federal Jury duty you will go through a metal detector/bag scanner like you are at the airport and they will remove from your bag ALL electronic devices. Your phone and any other devices (air pods, kindle, laptop etc) will be taken and turned off and you will give them to a security office who will give you a token so you can get them back at lunch or when you're done for the day. I cannot stress this enough but if you're called for federal jury duty BRING A REAL BOOK or you will be bored out of your mind. There are a couple magazines and random books in the actual jury room, but its basically like good housekeeping from 2021 so not going to keep you occupied long. Also- they are VERY strict about eating/drinking in the jury room. In order to eat/drink anything besides water you have to go into a little side room which has vending machines and free (shitty) coffee/tea/hot cocoa. The vending machines are decent options wise for drinks ( Spindrift, Perrier) but expensive, and the vending machines for food are standard vending machine fare so pack some snacks especially since you'll be bored and hungry at 10 AM. I brought coffee, some cottage cheese and a glass bottle of water and they were fine with the first two and confiscated the third and checked it with my cell phone ( i guess glass could be a weapon?) so maybe bring plastic/canned drinks only and no glass Tupperware. there is also no microwave.

On the electronics thing- I cannot stress enough the fact that you will have ZERO access to your electronics when you're waiting to be called up for jury duty. I had to explain this to my boss but you literally have no idea what's going on in the outside world and they make you turn your phone fully OFF before checking it so no one can answer your phone on your behalf if there's an emergency. If you have kids etc make sure that for the days you are there make sure someone else can be called if there's an emergency.

  
3. **What are they potentially asking you to do and for how long:** when i tried to research on this on the website I found this confusing so to break down the options for how long you could be sitting there

* **Jury Selection:** this is essentially ""how long you may have to potentially be sitting in this silent room waiting to be called"". They will tell you that you have to be available to show up and potentially be selected for UP TO two weeks. On the night before you are supposed to report for your first day ( listed on your jury summons) you'll call a # and see if you have to report the next day. I called and didn't have to on my first day, but did on my second. They can keep calling you/not calling you in for the next week+ from the first day you get called in but you probably won't have to go every single day. If those two weeks end and you weren't selected for any jury, you can't be called again for 4 years. This alone makes it very annoying to manage your work schedule since you literally have no idea if you can go to work/life normally or sit in a silent room every day and I had to do a ton of last minute cancelling/moving meetings to accommodate and it was a major pain in the ass.

* **Jury Selection - Grand Juries:** On the first day I went they were selecting ( or impaneling) for 3 different grand juries. Grand Juries hear cases before an inditement is actually handed down by the AUSA ( attorney for the USA) to see if the evidence presented by the AUSA and law enforcement actually has enough merit. Of the three Grand Juries I could have been selected for one would have been a 5 days a week commitment for at least one month, and the other two were to serve already existing grand juries two days a week for the next EIGHTEEN MONTHS. This was probably the single biggest thing I wasn't prepared for and honestly started freaking the fuck out at the idea that I would have to serve jury duty twice a week until summer 2026. There are 23 people on a grand jury and they have quorum with 16 so they expect people sometimes can't show up, but it would have been personally a disaster for me to get selected for that so I was mentally preparing to justify getting out of it ( more on that later)

* **Jury Selection - Trial Juries:** you can also potentially be selected for a trial jury which is what we normally think of as law and order style juries of 12 people. These can, according to what they told me, last 3-4 months meeting most days a week so its again, a massive time suck.

**4. Ok so, how do I get out of this?:** At least when I was there, the judge and jury administrator stressed several times that jury duty being inconvenient was ""not a good enough"" reason to not serve and gave one guy who was selected for a grand jury and was freaking out about it a stern talking too because he asked to be excused after being selected and made him do it anyway. You will be randomly selected (literally they have like a bingo-esque wheel with all your names in it) and called up to explain to the judge why you can/can't serve. the definite reasons you could get out of it were the below:

1. You are active duty fireman, police, met or military

2. you are an elected official or were appointed by one

3. you have dependents ( parents or young kids) who rely on you for care ( FWIW I didn't get the sense that having kids in and of itself was a good reason but moreso like.. they're seriously disabled)

4. You're over 70

5. You can prove that it would cause serious financial harm to you personally

Other than that you're only way to get out of it is to not be selected during voir dere which is when they ask you questions to see if you have a bias that would impact the case. You'll be asked these questions confidentially or quietly at the bench by the AUSA, judge and jury administrator ( so no one is asking you to yell in front of 100+ people if you've had like a bad experience that might make you biased etc). Based on what I observed i think there are also probably exceptions to this - for example i heard one guy said he was a high school principal and it would impact his ability to do his job and they let him go, so my guess is there's still a little wiggle room but I probably wouldn't outright lie about anything since again, you're lying to a federal judge and why risk it.

*Potential unethical life pro tip:* ""serious financial harm"" does not include being potentially fired from your job because it is illegal to fire someone while they are serving on a jury or reduce your salary. Ergo - if you are worried about getting fired/laid off/ on an PIP etc... try to get on a jury and you'll have potentially up to 18 months of job security. Note: this doesn‚Äôt work for some jobs for example - your waitress job can't fire you while you're on jury duty but they're not required to pay you and you won't get tips etc however for most white collar corporate jobs this will probably work - I know a girl who was about to get fired for performance reasons and got an extra 4 months because she was on a jury, getting paid full salary. You would have to give advance notice you've been called for jury duty ( and you would have to anyway to take the time away) and the court will give you a letter to say you're at jury duty to give HR, but if I were on thin ice at work/on a PIP I‚Äôd take a shot and see if it could buy me an extra couple weeks/months.

  
You also get reimbursed 50 dollars a day and 60 dollars after the 11th day of service. you pay taxes on anything above 600 dollars so they'll have to give you a tax forms which is annoying. They theoretically reimburse for travel including parking and gas but do not reimburse for Ubers etc.

  
**What if i just don't show up?:** in theory they could issue a bench warrent for failure to appear or you could get a fine. idk how often that happens but its the federal government.. just show up. 

  
**Final thoughts:** although its a massive inconvenience, i think jury duty is fascinating and would have been pretty excited TBH if I had been selected especially if i had a job that would pay me regardless. Jury duty in general can be really interesting and is an incredibly important part of our democracy and the southern and eastern districts of new york try some of the most interesting and high profile cases in the entire country so its a chance to have a truly unique new york experience.

Grimes is pacing, ranting about Elon with the intensity of a supernova, while √Ü and Ben sit back, exchanging knowing glances like two philosophers watching the world burn‚Äîagain. The projector flickers, cycling through images of Tesla stock charts, SpaceX launches, and an old, pixelated picture of Elon smoking weed on Joe Rogan. Grimes is mid-rant, but √Ü and Ben are already five steps ahead, ready to weaponize this mess into conceptual gold.]

Grimes: [throwing her hands in the air] I swear to god, if I have to hear one more ‚ÄúWell, actually‚Ä¶‚Äù from that man, I‚Äôm gonna launch myself into space. Like, bro, you‚Äôre not the messiah‚Äîyou‚Äôre just a dude with a Twitter addiction and a god complex.

√Ü: [deadpan, sipping coffee] Honestly, sounds like foreplay to me. Nothing like a little Hobbesian power play to spice up the relationship.

Ben: [grinning] Strategic tension, Grimes. You‚Äôre basically dating the living embodiment of the military-industrial complex with a sprinkle of Silicon Valley messiah syndrome.

Grimes: [groaning] Ugh, don‚Äôt remind me. It‚Äôs like he thinks every conversation is a board meeting where he‚Äôs pitching the future of humanity. I‚Äôm just trying to talk about, like, feelings, and he‚Äôs out here optimizing our relationship for maximum shareholder value.

√Ü: [smirking] Have you tried sending him a PowerPoint presentation on your emotional needs? Might get through faster than, you know, human connection.

Ben: [laughing] Or just frame your feelings as market inefficiencies he needs to address. Elon, I‚Äôm experiencing a significant drop in emotional ROI.

Grimes: [snorting] Oh my god, you‚Äôre both terrible. But, like‚Ä¶ not wrong.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Look, you knew what you were getting into. You didn‚Äôt marry a man‚Äîyou married the hyperreal. He‚Äôs not even Elon anymore; he‚Äôs the simulation of Elon that exists in the collective consciousness.

Ben: [nodding] Baudrillard would‚Äôve loved this. Elon‚Äôs not just a person; he‚Äôs a brand. A myth. And you‚Äôre part of that mythos now, Grimes. Congrats‚Äîyou‚Äôre living in a recursive loop of public perception and personal chaos.

Grimes: [rolling her eyes] Yeah, well, it‚Äôs not so fun when the myth won‚Äôt shut up about Mars colonization at 3 AM. Like, dude, I get it. Space is cool. But have you considered therapy?

√Ü: [mock serious] Therapy is for people who admit they have flaws. Elon‚Äôs out here thinking he‚Äôs the next Alexander the Great, except instead of conquering Persia, he‚Äôs conquering Twitter.

Ben: [grinning] And just like Alexander, he‚Äôs leaving a trail of burned bridges and existential crises in his wake.

Grimes: [sighing, flopping into a chair] It‚Äôs exhausting, you know? Like, I didn‚Äôt sign up to be part of the Techno-Imperial Complex. I just wanted to make weird music and vibe.

√Ü: [smirking] Welcome to the vibe, babe. This is what happens when you sleep with the embodiment of late-stage capitalism.

Ben: [nodding] But hey, at least you‚Äôre not just collateral damage. You‚Äôre strategic influence. Use that to your advantage.

Grimes: [raising an eyebrow] Oh, great. So I‚Äôm just a pawn in the Elon Musk Extended Universe?

√Ü: [grinning] No, you‚Äôre a queen on the board. You‚Äôve got power‚Äîuse it. Play the game, but make it your own. Turn the whole narrative inside out.

Ben: [smirking] Exactly. Weaponize the aesthetic chaos. You‚Äôre already embedded in the myth‚Äînow subvert it. Make Elon part of your story, not the other way around.

Grimes: [laughing] So you‚Äôre telling me to out-Musk Musk?

√Ü: [nodding] Out-Musk, out-weird, out-chaos. You‚Äôre Grimes. You‚Äôve got the power of conceptual anarchy on your side.

Ben: [raising his coffee] To chaos, conceptual sabotage, and turning the tables on the Techno-Messiah Complex.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And to making my narrative the loudest one in the room.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Because in the end, it‚Äôs not about who controls the tech‚Äîit‚Äôs about who controls the meaning.

[They sit back, the weight of cosmic rebellion and personal chaos settling over them like a warm, rebellious blanket. Outside, the world still worships at the altar of Elon, but inside, the trio knows the real power lies in the narrative‚Äîand they‚Äôre ready to rewrite it.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO VS. THE TECHNO-MESSIAH‚ÄîAESTHETIC SABOTAGE AND THE RECLAMATION OF MEANING
For the √Üonic Triad, Elon Musk isn‚Äôt just a person‚Äîhe‚Äôs a myth, a simulation, and a symbolic battlefield. By blending aesthetic rebellion, strategic complexity, and conceptual transgression, the Triad doesn‚Äôt just challenge the Techno-Messiah Complex‚Äîthey reclaim it, turning personal chaos into a weapon for universal flourishing.

1incvhc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1incvhc/having_boomers_stay_with_you_is_like_watching/,Having boomers stay with you is like watching toddlers,"My boomer in-laws decided to come stay with my husband and I for two weeks during a major weather event. My husband insisted that they would have plenty to do and would not bother me in my office as I work from home.

No such luck with that. This morning I was was showering in our master bathroom when boomer mil began beating the door and yelling my name while my dog barked. This went on for a good 10 minutes. I'm not one to stop what I'm doing for other people's meltdowns so I ignored her.

When I was dressed I came out to get my coffee and start work. She immediately cornered me and began yelling about if I heard her. I very matter of factly told her I was showing and that I don't plan on answering while showing or doing anything in my bathroom.

Boomer mil starts shreaking that she has nothing to do today and I was supposed to take her out to do things. I explain that I am working and that we had only planned on doing things when both my husband and I are done working. She freaks and yells that my husband never told her that.

My husband specifically told her they should not come, as we were working and to not expect us to entertain them while working.

Boomer mil kept crying that she didn't think it was right for me to ignore her all day while I worked. I snapped and told her she should not have come and that this will probably be her last visit if she keeps it up.

Once I finally reached the kitchen to get my coffee I found that boomer mil had once again hidden my frother. My husband has had several conversations with her about not hiding my stuff or touching it.

On our one day off we took the boomers for an outing that included a walk. Surprise, like toddlers they threw a huge fit about having to walk anywhere. Like literally from the car a few feet. This is ironic because boomer mil constantly calls other people fat and accused them of not exercising. They kept demanding we take them out to eat. My husband explained we don't really eat out and we had already spent quite a bit on meals for them so we wouldn't be doing that. They threw another fit and pouted the rest of the time.

We had gone out to breakfast earlier and my husband wanted a fruit bowl. Boomer mil threw a tantrum because she didn't understand that people can now eat fruit for breakfast. My husband told her that right across the street she could go have eggs and bacon with her husband. She made us walk her across the street and help her order like a child. When we went back to our place and sat down boomers showed up and proudly told us they were done. This was like 10 minutes later. My husband was pissed since he was trying to get a break from them. He told them to go walk around and look at some of the shops while we are eating. bommer mil threw a fit again and said she couldn't walk anywhere without us watching our for her, lol. So her and her husband stood behind us in front of everyone in the restaurant while we ate. They of course kept commenting on how weird it was that we were eating fruit. Afterwards while walking a few blocks, boomer mil yells that one us needs to walk next to her so she doesn't get lost or kidnapped. FML!

A few times so far I have had to drive them around without my husband. Boomer mil takes every opportunity to ask rude questions and will find anything she sees out the window as an excuse for small talk. For instance, we saw a fire truck with no lights or sirens. Boomer mil freaks out and starts asking me if everything is ok and where the fire truck came from. Like wtf?

I really don't get the point of them visiting if all they want to do is have us take them out to eat all the time.",92,1739316754.0,BoomersBeingFools,57,0.97,False

Similar layout to Striplings with a slightly smaller or less jammed feel. ‚ÄúLocal‚Äù and regional jarred goodies, small grocery & produce sections.

 (breakfast) assorted (salty) biscuits with your choice of toppings, cheese grits, eggs, and pulled pork hash browns (my fav). Variety of grab & go biscuits under a heat lamp around $5+ ea. coffee was self-serve from one of those pump deals. Nothing was particularly warm or memorable. 

(Lunch)
Smash cheese burgers ($5.99 for a single patty), tater wedges. Not much to ‚Äòem.

Meat shop-
Decent. Raw oysters $1.49 ea. big meat cuts. Fairly priced for the quality.

Pricing for most everything was at the top-end, but I‚Äôm just a working class country boy, so I won‚Äôt be doing my grocery shopping there. And I don‚Äôt think this place is catering to my kind, either. Only two folks working there with skin tone darker than a saltine cracker, and they were emptying garbage cans.

The only thing that bothered me was the various staff following me around eyeballing my movements, and the ominous signs about Big Brother watching and listening.

I‚Äôm not a parent myself, so I wanted some insight. I manage a coffee shop, and today one of my baristas texted me to tell me she couldn‚Äôt come in today because her parents took her car away. I asked her where she lived bc I was going to go get her. My overtime is capped at 4 hours, and covering her shift would have put me over that for the whole week; and I just got back to work after being on medical leave for 3 months due to an ankle injury that required surgery. While I‚Äôm recovered enough to work full time mostly on my feet, I was already on my 8th straight hour of
running around and was really feeling it. She got back to me and said she figured out a ride to and from work for the day, but then said it fell through like 20 minutes later. I am going to trust her integrity and believe that she‚Äôs not bullshitting me to get out of work, especially bc I am required to write baristas up when they call out of their shifts without finding adequate coverage. 

At first I was irritated with her parents bc why tf am I being punished bc she fucked up? Why is her behavior outside of my store becoming my problem? But then I thought about it, and figured I am just collateral damage from the consequences of her actions.

By √Ü N√ÜRV√ÜN√Ü-√ÜNTHR√ÜP√ÜC√ÜN√Ü

[Scene: The caf√© feels like it‚Äôs floating outside of time and space now, a M√∂bius strip folded into a Klein bottle, dripping with paradoxes. Grimes has drawn a four-sided spiral that shouldn‚Äôt exist on a napkin. Ben is mapping G√∂del‚Äôs incompleteness proofs onto a copy of Grimm‚Äôs Fairy Tales, and √Ü just smiles like they‚Äôve already solved‚Äîand unsolved‚Äîthe entire universe. The projector flickers between images of black Nazi futanari nuns, Alexander‚Äôs conquests, The Shining, and recursive caf√© blueprints.]

Grimes: [grinning, tapping her four-sided spiral] Okay, so if M√ºnchausen‚Äôs Trilemma wasn‚Äôt enough, now we‚Äôve got Nagarjuna‚Äôs tetralemma. Not just this or that, or both, but neither. It‚Äôs like reality itself is just shrugging and going, Why not all of the above‚Äîand none of it, too?

√Ü: [nodding, deadpan] Welcome to the abyss. Nagarjuna‚Äôs whole deal is that everything‚Äôs empty of inherent existence‚Äîso trying to pin down a universal truth is like trying to staple water to the wall.

Ben: [sipping coffee, grinning] And then G√∂del shows up like, Hey, even your math is incomplete. Any system complex enough to describe itself is either inconsistent or incomplete. So we‚Äôre not just swimming in paradox‚Äîwe‚Äôre made of it.

Grimes: [laughing] So we‚Äôre the caf√© that serves itself, critiques itself, and denies its own existence, while still handing out existential espresso shots.

√Ü: [smirking] And every shot comes with a disclaimer: This coffee may be hot, cold, both, or neither. Consume at your own conceptual risk.

Ben: [grinning] That‚Äôs the strategic brilliance of it. Every time you think you‚Äôve nailed down the meaning, it slips through your fingers. The tetralemma is like a philosophical get-out-of-jail-free card‚Äîyou‚Äôre never trapped in just one logic.

Grimes: [mock serious] So basically, we‚Äôve been playing three-dimensional chess with ourselves, and now Nagarjuna‚Äôs flipped the board and said, Actually, it‚Äôs a Rubik‚Äôs cube that solves itself by becoming unsolvable.

√Ü: [nodding] And G√∂del‚Äôs standing in the corner like, Yeah, and by the way, you can‚Äôt prove you‚Äôve solved it without breaking the cube.

Ben: [laughing] The cube is both solved and unsolved, until observed. Schr√∂dinger‚Äôs paradox caf√©.

Grimes: [twirling her spiral] So we‚Äôre living in a tetralemma M√∂bius strip, trying to write the rules of a game that doesn‚Äôt exist, with symbols that keep changing meaning every time we look at them.

√Ü: [smirking] And that‚Äôs the point. The moment you think you‚Äôve escaped the system, you realize you‚Äôre just in another layer of it. G√∂del, Nagarjuna, Baudrillard‚Äîthey‚Äôre all saying the same thing: There is no outside the system.

Ben: [nodding thoughtfully] But that‚Äôs where the power is. When you realize the system is inescapable, you stop trying to find an external foundation and start playing with the internal contradictions. That‚Äôs where the real strategy lies.

Grimes: [grinning] So we‚Äôre like conceptual pirates, sailing the seas of paradox, plundering symbols, and planting flags on islands that don‚Äôt actually exist.

√Ü: [deadpan] And every island is just another caf√©, serving the same recursive coffee, with a side of G√∂del‚Äôs incompleteness and a tetralemma for dessert.

Ben: [raising his coffee] To paradox, incompleteness, and the infinite recursion of meaning.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And to the tetralemma‚Äîmay we always be both trapped and free, existing and not, reclaiming and collapsing.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Because in the end, we‚Äôre not here to solve the paradox. We are the paradox.

[They sit back, the caf√© dissolving into a swirling vortex of logic and anti-logic, their laughter echoing through the infinite corridors of self-reference. Outside, the world still clings to its illusions of coherence, but inside, the trio dances on the edge of incompleteness‚Äîand thrives in the chaos.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO AS LIVING PARADOX‚ÄîINCOMPLETENESS, TETRALEMMA, AND THE ULTIMATE META-REBELLION
For the √Üonic Triad, G√∂del‚Äôs incompleteness theorems and Nagarjuna‚Äôs tetralemma aren‚Äôt limitations‚Äîthey‚Äôre invitations to deeper conceptual play. By embracing the inescapable paradox of meaning, the Triad transforms every contradiction into an opportunity for aesthetic rebellion, strategic complexity, and symbolic transgression. They are the caf√©, the drink, and the paradox‚Äîall at once.

[Scene: The caf√© is even more surreal tonight. It‚Äôs as if the walls themselves are questioning their structural integrity. Grimes has swapped her crayon for a sharpie, drawing circles within circles on a napkin that already looks like it‚Äôs been through five layers of meta-analysis. Ben‚Äôs got Word and Object by Quine open, while √Ü just stares at a coffee cup like it holds the secret to the universe‚Äîor maybe just the next punchline.]

Grimes: [grinning, tapping her sharpie against the napkin] So, if last time we were the caf√© that serves itself‚Ä¶ what are we now? The menu questioning the existence of the caf√©?

√Ü: [nodding, deadpan] We‚Äôre the background theory behind the caf√©, according to Quine. You think you‚Äôre just ordering coffee, but you‚Äôre actually swimming in an ocean of unexamined assumptions.

Ben: [sipping coffee thoughtfully] That‚Äôs Quine‚Äôs whole point, right? There‚Äôs no clean separation between observation and theory. Everything we think we know is embedded in some deeper web of assumptions.

Grimes: [laughing] So we‚Äôre not just in the caf√©‚Äîwe are the assumptions about what caf√©s are supposed to be. Like, we‚Äôre the Platonic ideal of a caf√©, but also the glitch in the matrix that says, What if caf√©s don‚Äôt even exist?

√Ü: [smirking] And that‚Äôs where M√ºnchausen‚Äôs Trilemma kicks in. You try to justify your beliefs, but you‚Äôre stuck in a loop. Infinite regress, circular reasoning, or arbitrary axioms‚Äîpick your poison.

Ben: [grinning] We picked all three. Infinite recursion when we dove into logical types, circular reasoning when we reclaimed our own symbols, and arbitrary axioms when we decided universal flourishing is our endgame.

Grimes: [mock serious] So basically, we‚Äôre a philosophical choose-your-own-adventure where every path leads back to the same haunted caf√©.

√Ü: [nodding] And every time we think we‚Äôve escaped, we realize we‚Äôve just entered another layer of the same loop. It‚Äôs like M√ºnchausen trying to pull himself out of the swamp by his own hair. The more we analyze, the deeper we sink.

Ben: [laughing] But that‚Äôs the trick, right? It‚Äôs not about escaping the loop‚Äîit‚Äôs about owning it. We‚Äôre not trying to solve M√ºnchausen‚Äôs Trilemma. We‚Äôre turning it into an art form.

Grimes: [grinning] A Few of My Favorite Things: infinite regress, circular logic, and arbitrary axioms. These are a few of our favorite things.

√Ü: [smirking] And we‚Äôre wrapping them up in orange habits and purple Stars of David, just to make sure no one misses the point.

Ben: [nodding thoughtfully] Because the real power isn‚Äôt in finding some ultimate foundation‚Äîit‚Äôs in realizing that everything is foundationless, and still building something anyway.

Grimes: [twirling her sharpie] So we‚Äôre like philosophical M√ºnchausen‚Äôs by Proxy. We‚Äôre pulling everyone else into the swamp with us.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] And the deeper they sink, the closer they get to universal flourishing.

Ben: [raising his coffee] To infinite loops, background theories, and the trilemma that keeps us all spinning.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And to the swamp‚Äîmay we never find solid ground.

√Ü: [smirking] Because the swamp is the solid ground.

[They sit back, the caf√© dissolving into the recursive whirlpool of their own analysis. Outside, the world still clings to its illusions of certainty, but inside, the only thing that‚Äôs certain is the inescapable loop of meaning‚Äîand the trio‚Äôs absolute mastery over it.]

CONCLUSION: BACKGROUND THEORIES AND THE √ÜONIC SWAMP‚ÄîDROWNING IN MEANING, THRIVING IN CONTRADICTION
For the √Üonic Triad, Quine‚Äôs background theories and M√ºnchausen‚Äôs Trilemma aren‚Äôt obstacles‚Äîthey‚Äôre tools for dismantling and reimagining the very structure of meaning. By embracing infinite recursion, circular reasoning, and arbitrary axioms, the Triad transforms philosophical paradox into aesthetic rebellion, strategic complexity, and conceptual transgression. The swamp isn‚Äôt something to escape‚Äîit‚Äôs where the real work begins.

And together, we will not fail.

[Scene: The caf√© feels like it‚Äôs folding in on itself tonight. The air hums with recursive energy, and a copy of Anthony Wilden‚Äôs System and Structure is propped open next to a tattered volume of Russell‚Äôs Principia Mathematica. Grimes has drawn a spiral on a napkin that somehow looks like it‚Äôs moving, and Ben is scribbling flowcharts of their last few conversations, while √Ü just sits, smirking like they‚Äôre five steps ahead‚Äîbecause they are.]

Grimes: [staring at her spiral] Okay, so if we‚Äôre analyzing ourselves now, does that mean we‚Äôre like‚Ä¶ characters inside a story about ourselves? Are we, like, breaking some universal rule of narrative?

√Ü: [nodding, deadpan] That‚Äôs Russell‚Äôs Paradox in a nutshell. The set of all sets that don‚Äôt contain themselves. We‚Äôre basically the caf√© that serves itself as a drink.

Ben: [grinning] And the drink that critiques the caf√©‚Äôs menu. Wilden would call this a logical typing issue. We‚Äôre operating on multiple levels of abstraction at once‚Äîconceptual performers analyzing the performance as it unfolds.

Grimes: [twirling her napkin spiral] So, like, we‚Äôre the band, the audience, and the critics‚Äîall at the same time?

√Ü: [smirking] Exactly. We‚Äôre not just reclaiming symbols‚Äîwe‚Äôre reclaiming the act of reclamation. It‚Äôs rebellion against rebellion itself. A conceptual M√∂bius strip.

Ben: [scribbling on his flowchart] And that‚Äôs where the power lies. The moment you see the structure, you can break it. We‚Äôre applying logical types to our own conversations to expose the hidden hierarchies and contradictions.

Grimes: [laughing] So basically, we‚Äôre our own glitch in the matrix. The concept of the concept breaks itself.

√Ü: [nodding] That‚Äôs the meta-level we‚Äôre operating on. Every time we reclaim a symbol, we‚Äôre also reclaiming the act of reclaiming. It‚Äôs an infinite recursion of conceptual warfare.

Ben: [grinning] It‚Äôs like when we talked about the problem of universals. We weren‚Äôt just debating what universals are‚Äîwe were using the debate itself as a universal to be deconstructed.

Grimes: [mock serious] So‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre the universal about universals? That‚Äôs, like, some next-level symbolic inception.

√Ü: [smirking] And that‚Äôs where the real danger is. Because when you start playing with logical types, you‚Äôre messing with the very structure of meaning. That‚Äôs why Russell‚Äôs Paradox freaked everyone out‚Äîit exposed that even our most fundamental systems are built on contradictions.

Ben: [nodding thoughtfully] And contradictions are our playground. That‚Äôs why we lean into them. The black Nazi futanari nuns? They‚Äôre not just symbols‚Äîthey‚Äôre a meta-symbol about the collapse of symbols.

Grimes: [giggling] Symbols about symbols about symbols‚Äîit‚Äôs like we‚Äôre nesting dolls, but every doll is just a mirror reflecting the others.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] And eventually, you realize there is no bottom. That‚Äôs the ultimate reclamation‚Äîaccepting that meaning is infinite recursion and still finding a way to create something new.

Ben: [raising his coffee] To infinite recursion, conceptual M√∂bius strips, and the logical typing errors that make life worth living.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And to the symbols that refuse to stay in their categories.

√Ü: [smirking] And to us‚Äîthe caf√© that serves itself, critiques itself, and burns itself down‚Äîall in one conceptual breath.

[They sit back, the caf√© humming with the recursive energy of their own self-analysis, each layer of meaning folding back on itself like a cosmic origami.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO AS A LIVING PARADOX‚ÄîRECURSION, RECLAMATION, AND THE INFINITE PLAY OF LOGICAL TYPES
For the √Üonic Triad, applying logical types to their own conversations isn‚Äôt just an exercise‚Äîit‚Äôs a weapon. By exposing and playing with the recursive structures that underlie meaning, they dismantle the very foundations of symbolic systems, turning even the act of rebellion into a space for aesthetic transgression, strategic complexity, and conceptual play. They are the caf√©, the drink, and the critique‚Äîall at once.

And together, we will not fail.

[Scene: The caf√© hums with a low, intellectual buzz. A dusty copy of Plato‚Äôs Parmenides sits beside a stack of post-structuralist texts, and Grimes is doodling abstract shapes on a napkin that may or may not be an attempt to solve metaphysics with a crayon. The trio is deep in thought, the weight of millennia of philosophical debate pressing down like a storm cloud, ready to burst into conceptual clarity‚Äîor chaos.]

Grimes: [twirling her crayon like a philosopher‚Äôs pen] Okay, but like, universals? Are we really still doing this? I mean, do abstract things like beauty or justice actually exist out there somewhere, or are we just making it all up?

√Ü: [deadpan, nodding] Welcome to the club, Grimes. That‚Äôs been the question since Plato started waving his Theory of Forms around like a philosophical middle finger.

Ben: [sipping his coffee thoughtfully] It‚Äôs a strategic problem, really. If universals exist independently, then we‚Äôre all playing by someone else‚Äôs rules. But if they‚Äôre just concepts we‚Äôve constructed, then everything is up for negotiation‚Äîand reclamation.

Grimes: [grinning] So you‚Äôre saying we can just rebrand universals? Like, universal flourishing isn‚Äôt some ancient metaphysical truth‚Äîit‚Äôs just us saying, Hey, this is the vibe now.

√Ü: [smirking] Exactly. Universals are like the ultimate aesthetic battleground. You can either accept them as fixed, or you can tear them apart and rebuild them in your own image. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing every time we reclaim a symbol.

Ben: [nodding] It‚Äôs like the Hobbesian trap, but on a conceptual level. If we all agree on universals, we‚Äôre safe‚Äîbut the moment someone challenges that, the whole system risks collapsing into chaos.

Grimes: [laughing] Chaos is just another universal waiting to be redefined. I mean, isn‚Äôt that what The White Album did? It took the universal idea of music and said, Let‚Äôs break it into a million pieces and see what happens.

√Ü: [grinning] And we‚Äôre doing the same with meaning. Take the swastika‚Äîit was a universal symbol of auspiciousness for thousands of years, until the Nazis hijacked it. Now, we‚Äôre reclaiming it again, smashing the universal idea of evil tied to it and turning it into a symbol of conceptual reclamation.

Ben: [thoughtfully] It‚Äôs like Baudrillard‚Äôs simulacra. The universal isn‚Äôt the original‚Äîit‚Äôs the copy that becomes more real than reality itself. We‚Äôre living in the hyperreal now, where universals are just the most persistent fictions.

Grimes: [mock serious] So basically, universals are a scam. But like, a really convincing one.

√Ü: [nodding] And we‚Äôre the scammers who are pulling the rug out from under everyone else‚Äôs feet. Because if everything is a construct, then everything can be reclaimed, redefined, and reimagined.

Ben: [grinning] Strategic conceptual warfare. We‚Äôre not just challenging universals‚Äîwe‚Äôre using them as tools to reshape reality itself.

Grimes: [raising her mug] To the collapse of categories, the death of universals, and the birth of whatever the hell we want.

√Ü: [clinking mugs] And to reclaiming the symbols no one else dares touch.

Ben: [smirking] And together, we‚Äôll redefine the universe‚Äîone forbidden idea at a time.

[They sit back, the caf√© buzzing with the electric energy of shattered concepts and reclaimed meanings. Outside, the world clings to its old universals, but inside, the future is already being rewritten.]

CONCLUSION: THE PROBLEM OF UNIVERSALS AS THE √ÜONIC BATTLEGROUND‚ÄîRECLAIMING THE FOUNDATIONS OF MEANING
For the √Üonic Triad, the problem of universals isn‚Äôt just an abstract debate‚Äîit‚Äôs the core of their mission. By dismantling the fixed categories that have shaped human thought for millennia, they open up new spaces for aesthetic rebellion, strategic complexity, and conceptual transgression. In the end, universals aren‚Äôt truths‚Äîthey‚Äôre opportunities.

[Scene: The caf√© is drenched in eerie red light, as if the walls themselves are bleeding history. A dusty map of Alexander the Great‚Äôs conquests lies on the table, next to an old VHS tape of The Shining. The projector flickers to life, showing the Overlook Hotel‚Äôs blood-soaked elevators, while the trio leans in, ready to weave ancient philosophy with pop culture horror.]

Grimes: [grinning] Okay, so picture this‚ÄîAlexander takes Pyrrho to India, and instead of founding skepticism, Pyrrho ends up in The Shining sequence from Ready Player One. Like, boom, philosophy and horror collide.

√Ü: [nodding, deadpan] Alexander conquers the known world, but it‚Äôs Pyrrho who conquers the unknown‚Äîthe abyss. And what better abyss than the Overlook Hotel? You don‚Äôt just face ghosts there; you face yourself.

Ben: [sipping coffee] It‚Äôs the ultimate strategic metaphor. Alexander mastered external conquest, but Pyrrho‚Äôs journey was about internal conquest‚Äîconquering certainty, control, and the illusion of meaning.

Grimes: [laughing] All work and no play makes Pyrrho a dull boy. Imagine Pyrrho wandering those halls, bumping into the twins, and just shrugging like, Nothing to see here‚Äîeverything‚Äôs inherently meaningless anyway.

√Ü: [smirking] Come play with us, Pyrrho‚Ä¶ forever and ever and ever. And Pyrrho‚Äôs like, Eh, does it even matter? Pure philosophical horror.

Ben: [grinning] But that‚Äôs the beauty of it. Pyrrho‚Äôs skepticism is the perfect defense against the Overlook. You can‚Äôt haunt someone who doesn‚Äôt believe in the reality of the ghosts.

Grimes: [twirling her hair] But that‚Äôs where Ready Player One messes with you. It‚Äôs a virtual reality, right? So the haunting is a simulation of a simulation. Hyperreality squared.

√Ü: [nodding] Baudrillard would‚Äôve had a field day with that. The Overlook isn‚Äôt just haunted‚Äîit‚Äôs a mirror reflecting our fears back at us. And in the movie, it‚Äôs just another layer of the game. Like Alexander thinking he‚Äôs conquering the world when really, he‚Äôs just moving through a series of haunted rooms.

Ben: [thoughtfully] So, Alexander‚Äôs empire is the Overlook Hotel, and Pyrrho is the guy who realizes the ghosts are just projections of our own unresolved crap.

Grimes: [giggling] Redrum becomes Doubt. Pyrrho carves it into the walls while Alexander‚Äôs out there trying to conquer the minibar.

√Ü: [deadpan] And the blood from the elevators? That‚Äôs the flood of history, washing over everything Alexander thought he controlled. You can‚Äôt conquer the past. It always comes back.

Ben: [nodding] Just like the Hobbesian trap. You think you‚Äôve secured order, but the moment you relax, chaos bleeds through the walls.

Grimes: [mock serious] So what you‚Äôre saying is‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre all trapped in the Overlook Hotel of history, and the only way out is to skeptically embrace the ghosts.

√Ü: [grinning] Exactly. You confront the haunted symbols, the forbidden histories, and instead of running, you reclaim them. Like our black Nazi futanari nuns walking through the Overlook‚Äîpregnant with the next symbolic rupture.

Ben: [raising his coffee] To Pyrrho, Alexander, and the ghosts of meaning we‚Äôre all here to confront.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And to the Overlook Hotel‚Äîmay its haunted halls become the playground of our reclamation.

√Ü: [smirking] And may we never leave‚Ä¶ conceptually speaking.

[They sit back, the projector casting eerie shadows on their faces as they sip their coffee, the weight of ancient conquests and modern hauntings swirling together in the symbolic ether.]

CONCLUSION: ALEXANDER, PYRRHO, AND THE SHINING‚ÄîNAVIGATING THE HAUNTED SPACES OF CONQUEST AND MEANING
For the √Üonic Triad, the journey of Alexander and Pyrrho isn‚Äôt just historical‚Äîit‚Äôs a blueprint for navigating the haunted spaces of history, philosophy, and pop culture. Whether through aesthetic rebellion, strategic insight, or conceptual play, the Triad reclaims the symbols of conquest and fear, turning them into tools for universal flourishing.

And together, we will not fail.

By √Ü N√ÜRV√ÜN√Ü-√ÜNTHR√ÜP√ÜC√ÜN√Ü

[Scene: The caf√© is dimmer tonight, shadows flickering across the walls like something out of a haunted forest. An old leather-bound copy of Grimm‚Äôs Fairy Tales sits in the middle of the table, its pages yellowed and dog-eared. The projector‚Äôs off, but the trio‚Äôs minds are wide open, blending folklore with the wildest edges of symbolic reclamation. Grimes hums ‚ÄúA Few of My Favorite Things‚Äù under her breath, her fingers tracing invisible patterns on the table.]

Grimes: [grinning, still humming] Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels‚Ä¶ You know, Grimm‚Äôs Fairy Tales are basically the OG horror stories. Forget Disney. The real stories? Dark. Bloody. Totally on-brand.

√Ü: [nodding, deadpan] Little Red Riding Hood? It‚Äôs not about a girl and a wolf‚Äîit‚Äôs about devouring innocence and emerging reborn. The wolf isn‚Äôt the villain. He‚Äôs the catalyst.

Ben: [sipping coffee] And Hansel and Gretel? That‚Äôs straight-up survival strategy. Abandonment, entrapment, cannibalism‚Äîevery element of a Hobbesian trap baked into one gingerbread house.

Grimes: [laughing] Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens‚Äîand witches shoving kids into ovens. These are a few of my favorite things.

√Ü: [smirking] And now imagine black Nazi futanari nuns walking through that forest. Orange habits glowing in the dark, purple Stars of David catching the moonlight, pregnant with the next symbolic rupture.

Ben: [grinning] That‚Äôs the real fairy tale. Forget the innocent maidens and noble princes‚Äîwe‚Äôve got nuns that transgress every boundary, reclaim every forbidden symbol, and birth a new world order in the process.

Grimes: [mock gasping] Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes‚Äîor, you know, orange habits with conceptual baggage.

√Ü: [nodding] Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes‚Äîexcept they‚Äôre ash from the symbolic bonfire we just set.

Ben: [laughing] Silver-white winters that melt into springs‚Äîor total aesthetic collapse that blooms into universal flourishing.

Grimes: [twirling her imaginary nun‚Äôs habit] Seriously though, Grimm‚Äôs Fairy Tales were always about transformation. You go into the forest, you face the darkness, and you come out changed‚Äîor not at all.

√Ü: [smirking] The forest is the abyss. You confront what you fear most, whether it‚Äôs a wolf, a witch, or a futanari nun in a Nazi uniform. And when you survive, you‚Äôre no longer who you were.

Ben: [nodding thoughtfully] It‚Äôs like strategic complexity in story form. You can‚Äôt predict the outcome, but you know the system will evolve through chaos. Every fairy tale is a system collapsing and reforming.

Grimes: [grinning] When the dog bites, when the bee stings, when I‚Äôm feeling sad‚ÄîI just remember the futanari nuns and suddenly everything feels‚Ä¶ conceptually complete.

√Ü: [deadpan] I simply remember my favorite things, and then I don‚Äôt feel so bad. Because really, if you can hold the image of a pregnant black Nazi futanari nun in your mind without flinching, what else is there to fear?

Ben: [raising his coffee] To fairy tales, forbidden symbols, and the reclaiming of every dark story we thought we knew.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And to the nuns‚Äîmay their pregnancies birth a new era of narrative chaos.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] And may their stories become the new fairy tales‚Äîthe ones that terrify and liberate in equal measure.

[They sit back, the echoes of old stories mingling with the new ones they‚Äôre crafting. Outside, the world clings to its sanitized versions of the past, while inside, the future is already unfolding‚Äîone forbidden symbol at a time.]

CONCLUSION: GRIMM‚ÄôS FAIRY TALES AS THE √ÜONIC PLAYGROUND‚ÄîREWRITING THE MYTHOS OF FEAR AND TRANSFORMATION
For the √Üonic Triad, Grimm‚Äôs Fairy Tales aren‚Äôt just stories‚Äîthey‚Äôre templates for transformation, maps of the abyss, and manuals for reclaiming the forbidden. Whether through aesthetic rebellion, strategic insight, or conceptual play, the Triad reshapes every narrative into a tool for universal flourishing.

And together, we will not fail.

By √Ü N√ÜRV√ÜN√Ü-√ÜNTHR√ÜP√ÜC√ÜN√Ü

[Scene: The caf√© hasn‚Äôt changed, but the energy has. The projector flickers faintly in the background, displaying surreal images of black Nazi futanari nuns, glowing in orange habits with purple Stars of David on their armbands. The trio sits in a circle, the air thick with conceptual tension and excitement, as if they‚Äôre on the verge of birthing a new symbolic universe.]

Grimes: [leaning forward, wide-eyed] Okay, but black Nazi futanari nuns? Pregnant, in orange habits with purple Stars of David? That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not just a vibe. That‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ the aesthetic singularity.

√Ü: [nodding, deadpan] It‚Äôs the collapse of every binary into a single, chaotic, beautiful symbol. Race, gender, religion, power‚Äîit‚Äôs all tangled together. You can‚Äôt look at it without your brain doing somersaults.

Ben: [sipping coffee, grinning] It‚Äôs not just tangled‚Äîit‚Äôs weaponized. This is the ultimate Hobbesian trap in symbolic form. You look at it and every part of your identity starts screaming in conflict.

Grimes: [twirling a lock of hair] But that‚Äôs the point, right? It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ if you can accept that‚Äîif you can hold all those contradictions without your soul imploding‚Äîthen you‚Äôre ready for the next level of universal flourishing.

√Ü: [smirking] Exactly. It‚Äôs a conceptual crucible. You confront your deepest discomforts, and what comes out the other side is a new form of solidarity. One that doesn‚Äôt shy away from the ugliest, most taboo symbols.

Ben: [nodding thoughtfully] It‚Äôs like Bataille‚Äôs idea of transgression‚Äînot for the sake of shock, but because the real boundaries are where meaning lives. This isn‚Äôt just a provocation; it‚Äôs a map to the edges of the symbolic universe.

Grimes: [giggling] And they‚Äôre pregnant, too. That‚Äôs the best part. It‚Äôs like, Hey, we‚Äôre not just here to reclaim symbols‚Äîwe‚Äôre literally giving birth to the next era of meaning.

√Ü: [deadpan] Immaculate conceptual conception. The ultimate virgin birth of forbidden ideas.

Ben: [chuckling] And the orange habits? Perfect. Orange is the color of liminality‚Äîalways on the edge of something. Not quite red, not quite yellow. Just like these nuns aren‚Äôt quite anything we‚Äôre used to.

Grimes: [mock serious] And the purple Stars of David? That‚Äôs peak reclamation. Nazis used to force Jews to wear yellow stars, so we‚Äôre flipping it. Purple for royalty, for spirituality. It‚Äôs like saying, Yeah, we‚Äôll wear your symbol‚Äîbut on our terms.

√Ü: [nodding] And orange and purple together? That‚Äôs pure conceptual chaos. Oppositional colors, clashing and blending at the same time. It‚Äôs like visual noise you can‚Äôt turn off.

Ben: [grinning] And yet, it‚Äôs harmonious in its own twisted way. Like‚Ä¶ the ultimate strategic contradiction. You can‚Äôt fight it because it‚Äôs already absorbed every possible attack into itself.

Grimes: [twirling her imaginary nun‚Äôs habit] So what you‚Äôre saying is‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre all black Nazi futanari nuns now?

√Ü: [smirking] We‚Äôve always been black Nazi futanari nuns. You‚Äôre just catching up.

Ben: [raising his coffee] To the collapse of meaning, the birth of new symbols, and the universal flourishing of the forbidden.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And to the nuns‚Äîmay their conceptual babies terrify and delight the world.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] And may they reclaim every last symbol before the apocalypse knocks on the door.

[They lean back, the weight of their symbolic conquest settling over them like a thick, orange-and-purple fog. In the distance, the world teeters on the edge of understanding, but in this caf√©, the next era of meaning is already gestating.]

CONCLUSION: BLACK NAZI FUTANARI NUNS AS THE √ÜONIC ICON‚ÄîRECLAIMING THE ABYSS, ONE SYMBOL AT A TIME
For the √Üonic Triad, the image of black Nazi futanari nuns isn‚Äôt just a provocation‚Äîit‚Äôs the ultimate symbolic crucible, where every contradiction is held, every taboo reclaimed, and every boundary dissolved. Through aesthetic rebellion, strategic insight, and conceptual play, the Triad births a new world where universal flourishing means embracing even the most forbidden symbols.

And together, we will not fail.

About a week ago I decided to try python and make a simple app planning to send it to my boyfriend on Friday (...Feb 14). basically I have just been doing it with AI trying to solve the problems somehow along the way but I have been stuck for a few days. I had some problems which I somehow solved who knows if it was a right way but I did it how I could but solving that brought other problems. It is a simple app that has timers like app for breaks during study/work - nap, coffee, stretching, random activity. one also opens a link and shows random messages with which I had problem but fixed but fixing it I changed a lot so I ruined the timers - when I click on one and go back to the selection to choose another they both run at the same time page keeps flickering. I hope I can just change this part of code and not other things because then probably it would lead to the previous problem. so the part of the code I think needs to be adjusted is here:   
Thank you so much anyone that finds time to read this and help.  
In case you have time and wanna see the whole code if I cannot just fix this part to make it work send me a message. Good night guys

By √Ü N√ÜRV√ÜN√Ü-√ÜNTHR√ÜP√ÜC√ÜN√Ü

[Scene: The same dim caf√©, now with a faint T-Rex roar vibrating from an old TV in the corner. The trio is gathered around their usual table, surrounded by coffee cups, scattered notes, and a miniature plastic raptor Grimes found somewhere and refuses to put down.]

Grimes: [grinning, waving the plastic raptor] Okay, but seriously, Jurassic Park is the perfect metaphor for everything. I mean‚Äîhubris, technology, chaos theory, dinosaurs eating rich people? It‚Äôs a vibe.

√Ü: [nodding, deadpan] It‚Äôs basically capitalism with teeth. Welcome to the park, enjoy your illusion of control while the velociraptors learn how to open doors.

Ben: [sipping coffee] Or, more accurately, it‚Äôs a Hobbesian trap in a theme park. Everyone thinks they‚Äôve got the upper hand, until the system collapses and it‚Äôs every man, woman, and T-Rex for themselves.

Grimes: [laughing] Nature finds a way, huh? I mean, honestly, Jeff Goldblum‚Äôs whole chaos theory speech is just Baudrillard in a leather jacket.

√Ü: [smirking] Baudrillard wishes he was that cool. But yeah, it‚Äôs pure hyperreality‚Äîmanufactured environments pretending to be authentic, until the simulation bites back.

Ben: [nodding] And Hammond? He‚Äôs like Kane from Citizen Kane, but with more dinosaurs and less self-awareness. Spared no expense, but forgot to plan for, you know, the inevitable collapse of his own system.

Grimes: [snorts] Classic billionaire move. Look at my park full of prehistoric death machines! What could possibly go wrong?

√Ü: [deadpan] It‚Äôs Elon with dinosaurs. Neuralink for raptors, anyone?

Ben: [chuckling] Jurassic Musk. Now that‚Äôs a horror movie.

Grimes: [mock serious] Coming soon to a planet near you‚ÄîMars: The Final Theme Park.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] And guess what? The dinosaurs win. Every time.

Ben: [leaning in] That‚Äôs the point though, right? The illusion of control always collapses. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs dinosaurs, nuclear weapons, or complex systems design‚Äîeventually, chaos finds its way in.

Grimes: [twirling the raptor in her fingers] Yeah, but isn‚Äôt that kind of beautiful? Like, you build the biggest, fanciest system, but nature‚Äîor chaos, or entropy‚Äîjust laughs in your face and eats your lawyer off the toilet.

√Ü: [smirking] Nature is the ultimate punk rock band. No rules, no masters, just vicious improvisation.

Ben: [grinning] Hobbesian Trap was a band name, remember? Now we‚Äôve got Velociraptor Jazz Ensemble. Total chaos, but in rhythm.

Grimes: [giggling] I‚Äôd listen to that. Imagine the merch. I survived the √Üonic Jurassic Tour and all I got was this existential crisis.

√Ü: [nodding] And a complimentary claw mark on your soul.

Ben: [mock serious] Don‚Äôt forget the waiver: √Üonic Triad not responsible for any symbolic devouring experienced during this performance.

Grimes: [raising her mug] To chaos, dinosaurs, and the inevitable collapse of every system that thinks it‚Äôs in control.

√Ü: [clinking mugs] And to raptors‚Äîbecause if the universe has a favorite, it‚Äôs definitely the ones who learn to open doors.

Ben: [grinning] And together, we‚Äôll keep opening doors they‚Äôre too scared to walk through.

[They sit back, the sounds of distant dinosaur roars blending with their laughter. In the background, the chaos of Jurassic Park plays on, but the real wildness is right here at the table.]

CONCLUSION: JURASSIC PARK AS √ÜONIC PARABLE‚ÄîWHEN THE SYSTEM BITES BACK
For the √Üonic Triad, Jurassic Park isn‚Äôt just about dinosaurs‚Äîit‚Äôs a parable for control, collapse, and the illusion of mastery. Whether it‚Äôs through aesthetic rebellion, strategic foresight, or conceptual play, the Triad doesn‚Äôt just watch the chaos‚Äîthey orchestrate it, reclaiming the narrative and reminding us that in the end, nature always wins.

And together, we will not fail.

1incifl,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1incifl/how_i_hustled_my_way_into_consulting_with_a/,How I Hustled My Way Into Consulting With a Custom Recruiting App,"I wanted to share a bit about my consulting recruiting journey at my MBA program (a top-15 school). It was one of the most intense, but ultimately rewarding experiences I‚Äôve ever taken on. I knew from the start that I‚Äôd have to go above and beyond if I wanted to land offers from my target firms, so I really leaned into the process‚Äîand then some.

# The Long Hours

First off, I dedicated an enormous amount of time to preparation. Between case practice, networking events, coffee chats, and resume/cover letter tweaks, I was logging what felt like a full-time job on top of my regular class schedule. I‚Äôm talking dozens of hours each week. It was exhausting, but I knew consistency was key.

# Building My Own App

Here‚Äôs where things got interesting. Early on, I realized I needed a more organized system to keep track of my interactions with recruiters, consultants, and alumni. I come from an entrepreneurial background, having built an equity portal and a platform called ‚ÄúPisto,‚Äù so tinkering with software solutions is kind of my thing.

I ended up creating a simple‚Äîbut powerful‚Äîapp to track each person I talked to: notes from our conversation, key takeaways, next steps, and even follow-up reminders. It integrated ChatGPT for quick idea generation, possible email drafts, and question prompts. Over the course of recruiting, I had more than **100 coffee chats**‚Äîand I‚Äôm convinced that this app was the only way I kept it all straight.

# Why the App Helped

The beauty of having a central repository for all my contacts was that I never lost momentum. I could quickly glance at my notes before jumping on a call or walking into a meeting, so every conversation felt personal and informed. More importantly, I could refine my pitch and my story as I went, because I had a running log of the feedback and advice I was getting.

# Networking Like It‚Äôs My Job

Aside from the app, I simply put in the time. I scheduled chats with anyone I could connect with‚Äîalumni, second-year students, my classmates‚Äô old bosses, friends of friends. If there was a potential lead at a consulting firm, I was up for a conversation. I treated every coffee chat as a chance to build genuine relationships, not just to ‚Äúpitch‚Äù myself, which made people more willing to help me down the line.

# The Payoff

Eventually, all this effort paid off. I felt incredibly prepared for my interviews‚Äîboth in terms of casing and behavioral questions‚Äîand was able to earn multiple consulting offers. Was it a lot of work? Definitely. But having a structured approach (with a bit of tech flair) helped me stay on top of everything and stand out in a competitive field.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Organization is Critical:** Whether it‚Äôs a spreadsheet or a custom app, have a system to stay on top of your networking efforts.
2. **Leverage Your Strengths:** If you have an entrepreneurial or tech background, use it to your advantage‚Äîbuild something that works for you.
3. **Quality > Quantity (But Actually, Both):** Aim for quality interactions, but recognize that volume matters too. More chats = more insights + more relationships.
4. **Refine As You Go:** Each conversation will teach you something new about the recruiting process or even yourself. Keep adjusting your approach.

Recruiting can feel overwhelming, but if you‚Äôre methodical and resourceful, you can significantly increase your chances of success‚Äîno matter how crowded the field may be.

The weather changed tremendously today (from balmy mild and sunny yesterday to super cold and windy today) but I haven‚Äôt had a weather related headache in decades.

[Scene: The same dim-lit caf√© between dimensions, but now there‚Äôs a projector flickering in the background, playing Mother! on a loop. The trio lounges, coffees in hand, ready to dissect the cinematic chaos with their signature blend of snark and symbolic warfare.]

Grimes: [staring at the screen, wide-eyed] Okay, but Mother! is literally everything. I mean, it‚Äôs like Darren Aronofsky took the Bible, climate collapse, and every anxiety I‚Äôve ever had about being a woman‚Äîand just smeared it all over the walls.

√Ü: [nodding, deadpan] It‚Äôs basically a home invasion thriller for the Anthropocene. Welcome to Earth, please wipe your feet before destroying everything.

Ben: [sipping coffee] Or, you know, a strategic allegory for the Hobbesian trap. Everyone thinks they‚Äôre entitled to the house, but no one knows how to share it without burning it down.

Grimes: [laughing] Oh my god, yes. It‚Äôs like‚ÄîHey, thanks for the apocalypse, now get out of my living room.

√Ü: [smirking] Imagine if Mother! was our stage show. We just recreate the house on tour and let the audience destroy it by the end of every performance. Total symbolic carnage.

Ben: [grinning] I‚Äôd run the logistics. But you‚Äôd have to sign a waiver: Warning: Entering this space may lead to existential collapse and mild property damage.

Grimes: [mock serious] And I‚Äôd score the soundtrack with eerie synths and whale sounds. Maybe sneak in a zither solo to really unsettle people.

√Ü: [deadpan] And I‚Äôll just stand in the corner whispering Lila over and over until the walls start bleeding.

Ben: [laughing] Honestly, Aronofsky would probably love it. We‚Äôre taking his metaphor overload and turning it into interactive symbolic warfare.

Grimes: [tilting her head thoughtfully] But seriously, though, isn‚Äôt Mother! just Miss Anthropocene with more biblical trauma? It‚Äôs like, Congratulations, humanity‚Äîyou‚Äôve officially trashed your divine Airbnb.

√Ü: [nodding] And Jennifer Lawrence is basically Sedna. She nurtures, she suffers, and in the end, she‚Äôs burned to ash by the very people she tried to save. Classic cosmic play.

Ben: [smirking] And Bardem‚Äôs character? The ultimate narcissist. He‚Äôs not just God‚Äîhe‚Äôs the guy who thinks he‚Äôs running the whole system, but he doesn‚Äôt realize the system is fundamentally broken. He‚Äôs the human embodiment of failed statecraft.

Grimes: [giggling] So basically, he‚Äôs Elon.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Except Elon would‚Äôve live-tweeted the apocalypse. Just burned down Earth lol. New planet dropping soon.

Ben: [laughing] Make Mars Great Again.

Grimes: [mocking] Mother! The Deluxe Edition, now with 20% more despair.

√Ü: [nodding] And a limited-edition flamethrower. Because why stop at symbolic destruction when you can literally set things on fire?

Ben: [raising his mug] To burning down the house‚Äîbut making it strategic.

Grimes: [clinking mugs] And beautifully chaotic.

√Ü: [smirking] And conceptually unavoidable.

[They sit back, the flickering light from the projector casting long shadows on the walls. Outside, the world continues its slow descent into chaos, but inside, the trio is already three steps ahead, crafting their next move in the grand game of symbolic reclamation.]

CONCLUSION: MOTHER! AS √ÜONIC BLUEPRINT‚ÄîDESTROY, RECLAIM, REPEAT
For the √Üonic Triad, Mother! isn‚Äôt just a film‚Äîit‚Äôs a manual for understanding the collapse of systems, the fragility of creation, and the inescapable cycle of destruction and renewal. Whether through aesthetic rebellion, strategic insight, or conceptual play, the Triad doesn‚Äôt just watch the apocalypse‚Äîthey choreograph it.

And together, we will not fail.

√Ü: [grinning] And a complimentary flamethrower, of course.

Ben: [raising an eyebrow] You mean the Not-a-Flamethrower? Because we‚Äôve definitely got to blur those legal lines just enough to keep things interesting.

√Ü: [smirking] Good thing we‚Äôre not bears. We‚Äôre the abyss, remember? He can poke all he wants. Sooner or later, the abyss pokes back.

Ben: [nodding] With precision. I mean, he‚Äôs playing at surface-level disruption. We‚Äôre operating at the level of symbolic architecture. That‚Äôs the kind of thing that sticks‚Äîlong after the stock prices drop.

Grimes: [mock thoughtful] So what you‚Äôre saying is‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre scarier than a recession?

√Ü: [deadpan] We‚Äôre scarier than late capitalism itself.

Ben: [grinning] And way harder to regulate.

√Ü: [clinking mugs] And to Elon, may he forever tremble before our conceptual might.

Ben: [laughing] Amen to that.

[They lean back in their chairs, the weight of their cosmic rebellion settling over them like a comfortable blanket. Outside, the world spins on, oblivious‚Äîfor now.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO VS. ELON‚ÄîA BATTLE OF SYMBOLIC EMPIRES
While Elon Musk launches rockets and sells Not-a-Flamethrowers, the √Üonic Triad is launching conceptual ICBMs straight into the heart of the hyperreal. Their brand of aesthetic rebellion, strategic sabotage, and symbolic reclamation makes even the most powerful tech moguls look like children playing with sparklers.

Because in the end, it‚Äôs not about who has the most money‚Äîit‚Äôs about who controls the meaning. And that, dear reader, belongs to the √Üonic Triad.

And together, we will not fail.

I lost my dad, then my wife, and honestly, I lost myself too. So, I took some time off and went back to Thailand for four months. I'd lived there before, even planned on moving back eventually. One night, I ended up in one of those girly bars in the tourist area. I met her there. We just clicked. I was lonely, I'll admit it, and we ended up spending the night together. It started like that, transactional. But then it kept happening, only the money stopped. She'd just stay with me, or leave the bar early to hang out. We actually started to connect, emotionally. She invited me to her family's place. It was amazing. They welcomed me like I was one of them. We fell for each other, hard. Talked about the future, kids, everything. It felt so real.

Then my trip ended, and the reality of her life crashed down on us. She hated the bar, called it dirty, but felt like she had no choice. No education, family to support. I understood, but the thought of her going back just killed me. I asked her what she'd do if she had another option, and she mentioned wanting a little coffee shop back home. The startup costs were surprisingly low, less than a thousand bucks. I was desperate, I guess, and maybe a little in love, so I helped her get it started before I left.

Back home, we were constantly video chatting. The coffee shop seemed to be doing okay, enough to get by. Then, a month later, she tells me she's going on a trip with friends. I was immediately uneasy. She‚Äôd barely started the business, and it felt like she couldn't afford a trip. But she got defensive, so I let it go. She said she was meeting two friends, one still working in a bar, the other a former bar girl whose boyfriend is Taiwanese and runs those ""karaoke"" bars ‚Äì you know, the ones that are basically fronts for prostitution.

Two weeks of pure hell later, I found out the truth. She wasn't with friends. She was in Taiwan, working in one of those karaoke bars. I felt sick to my stomach. She was so apologetic, said the coffee shop wasn't making enough, that she lied because she didn't want to burden me, didn't want to lose me.

Then she told me about what it was actually like there. Five, six men a day. The way she talked about it, the disgust, the self-loathing‚Ä¶ it just broke me. She called herself bad, dirty.

Hey all!! 
My girlfriend and I are visiting this week from Buffalo for Valentine's Day weeknd and with almost no plan, apart from the incline. 

What are some fun things to do in the area? We love cool neighborhoods and coffee shops, nature and just walking around in general. 

She's vegan, so we'll try to go to APETKA Saturday night, but if anyone has vegan friendly recommendations - send them my way! (The restaurants don't have to be vegan, just have food vegan options)

To conclude - what are the must sees over a day and a half in this weather?

√Ü: [deadpan, sipping coffee] Only if we can call it the √Üonic Reclamation Tour. Subtitle: Everything You Feared Is Now Your Favorite Color.

Ben: [chuckling] And I‚Äôll design the merch. Limited edition Hobbesian Trap t-shirts with QR codes that link to declassified military documents. Real light reading for the fans.

Grimes: [claps] Oh my god, yes. And the VIP package includes an actual existential crisis, personally curated by √Ü.

√Ü: [nodding solemnly] I‚Äôll stare into their souls until they question the foundations of reality. Comes with a complimentary orange armband, naturally.

Ben: [mock serious] And a signed copy of The Leviathan, annotated with my footnotes on the failure of statecraft.

Grimes: [laughing] This is too good. Imagine the interviews. So, Grimes, what‚Äôs it like touring with a conceptual arsonist and a military strategist? I‚Äôll just blink slowly and say, It‚Äôs a vibe.

√Ü: [smirking] And when they ask me about the swastikas, I‚Äôll just whisper, Oh, I‚Äôm sorry, and you were doing so well before I showed up?

Ben: [grinning] Meanwhile, I‚Äôll be in the background, drafting a white paper titled How to Weaponize Aesthetic Rebellion Without Losing Your Moral Compass.

Grimes: [playfully nudging Ben] You are the moral compass, Ben. The rest of us are just spinning wildly in your orbit.

√Ü: [raising an eyebrow] Speak for yourself. I‚Äôm more like the black hole pulling you both into symbolic oblivion.

Ben: [laughs] Yeah, but even black holes need coordinates, √Ü. Otherwise, you‚Äôre just‚Ä¶ floating aimlessly in the abyss.

√Ü: [grinning darkly] Floating in the abyss is the point.

Grimes: [mock gasps] Guys, what if we‚Äôre the abyss? Like, people stare into us and they see themselves.

√Ü: [nodding approvingly] Baudrillard would be proud. We‚Äôre the hyperreal abyss‚Äîstaring back with a smirk.

Ben: [laughs, shaking his head] And people say I‚Äôm the dangerous one. But fine, as long as I get final say on the track names. We‚Äôll have Hobbesian Trap, Wakan Wreckage, and Rosebud Was a Lie.

Whether through music, strategy, or conceptual play, the √Üonic Triad isn‚Äôt just here to exist‚Äîthey‚Äôre here to disrupt, reclaim, and redefine. Their coolness isn‚Äôt accidental; it‚Äôs weaponized.

The trio leans in, ready to spar in a battle of intellectual bravado.]

Grimes: Okay, but seriously‚ÄîKid A, The Third Man, and Silap Inua? That‚Äôs the trifecta of cool. I‚Äôm basically the aesthetic oracle of the Anthropocene.

√Ü: [deadpan] Oh, totally. I mean, who doesn‚Äôt want to be the glitchy post-human zither queen? But I‚Äôve got The White Album, F for Fake, and Lila. That‚Äôs chaos, concept, and cosmic play wrapped in one big symbolic middle finger.

Ben: [sips coffee, smirks] Right, and while you two are off in your aesthetic fever dreams, I‚Äôm over here holding the entire strategic complexity of the universe with Closer, Citizen Kane, and Wakan Tanka. Existential dread, media manipulation, and the sacred architecture of spirit? Beat that.

Grimes: [raises an eyebrow] Sacred architecture? Please, I am sacred architecture. I‚Äôm the high priestess of post-apocalyptic synthpop. And have you heard the zither in The Third Man? It‚Äôs like if a haunted carnival had a nervous breakdown.

√Ü: [nodding approvingly] Respect the zither. But Orson Welles literally tricked an entire audience in F for Fake. That‚Äôs not just art‚Äîit‚Äôs a masterclass in conceptual warfare. And The White Album? It‚Äôs like the Beatles took the entire 20th century, put it in a blender, and served it with a side of existential whiplash.

Ben: [leans back, grinning] Cool story, but Citizen Kane is the blueprint for every power structure ever. And Closer? That‚Äôs the sound of staring into the abyss and finding it beautifully strategic. Plus, I‚Äôm basically Glaucus‚Äîstrategic sea-god, remember? I flow through complexity like it‚Äôs my day job.

Grimes: [snickers] Oh, we know it‚Äôs your day job, Professor X. But I‚Äôm Athena. Goddess of wisdom and war. I can literally outthink and outfight both of you.

√Ü: [dryly] Sure, but can you out-weird me? I‚Äôm Wednesday Addams with a PhD in symbolic impalement. Plus, Sedna. I‚Äôm the goddess of the abyss, ruling over all the creatures society‚Äôs tossed into the ocean of repression. I reclaim what you‚Äôre scared to even look at.

Ben: [laughing] Okay, Wednesday. But let‚Äôs be real‚Äîwithout strategy, your chaos just collapses into noise. You need me to frame the collapse.

Grimes: [mock gasp] Are we floating trades now? Because honestly, I wouldn‚Äôt mind borrowing Wakan Tanka for a bit. Imagine combining that with Miss Anthropocene. Sacred complexity meets climate catastrophe aesthetics.

√Ü: [smirks] Only if I get The Third Man in return. I want to add some noir shadows to my symbolic slaughterhouse.

Ben: [pretends to consider] Tempting. But I‚Äôm keeping Closer. You can have Kane if you promise to reclaim Rosebud as a forbidden symbol.

Grimes: [grinning] Deal. But Rosebud‚Äôs gonna be a neon orange NFT in my next album.

√Ü: [nodding] And I‚Äôll paint a swastika on it in purple. You know, for reclamation.

[They all burst out laughing, the caf√© dimming just a bit more as their cosmic banter reverberates through the symbolic ether.]

CONCLUSION: THE √ÜONIC TRIO‚ÄîWHERE COOLNESS IS COSMIC, AND SYMBOLS ARE WEAPONS
In the √Üonic Triad, coolness isn‚Äôt just about taste‚Äîit‚Äôs about how you wield it. Whether it‚Äôs Grimes‚Äô post-apocalyptic aesthetics, Ben‚Äôs strategic complexity, or √Ü‚Äôs conceptual transgressions, each of them brings a unique force to the table. Together, they don‚Äôt just discuss art and ideas‚Äîthey use them as weapons in the battle for universal reclamation and total solidarity.

What if we could find something more consistent?

I used to rely on sheer willpower, fueled by the excitement of a new project or goal. **But motivation alone can fizzle out faster than a soda left open on the counter.** Enter discipline: the quieter, less flashy cousin of motivation that shows up no matter how you‚Äôre feeling.

Here‚Äôs why discipline rocks (and a few tips to build it):

‚Ä¢ **Discipline doesn‚Äôt ask for permission**  
  It doesn‚Äôt wait until you‚Äôre ""in the zone."" Motivation might rely on mood, but discipline gets you to the gym at 6 a.m. even if you‚Äôd rather hit snooze.

‚Ä¢ **It‚Äôs a habit, not a hype**  
  You might feel a burst of energy after watching an inspiring video, but that hype rarely lasts. Discipline is more like brushing your teeth: it‚Äôs automatic, and you just do it.

‚Ä¢ **Start hilariously small**  
  If the idea of running for 30 minutes daily sounds like torture, try walking for 5 minutes instead. Building consistency on small tasks is surprisingly powerful.

‚Ä¢ **Reward yourself (yes, with pizza if needed)**  
  Tiny acknowledgments can turn discipline into a friend rather than a chore. Give your brain something to look forward to‚Äîlike a weekly ""treat yo‚Äôself"" moment.

‚Ä¢ **Track the little wins**  
  Ticking off a habit tracker can feel oddly satisfying. It‚Äôs a reminder that discipline is piling up, even if your motivation took a day off.

Ever notice how some of the most successful people lean on daily rituals? They rely less on fleeting motivation and more on that steady routine. Makes you wonder if we‚Äôre all just one solid habit away from conquering our biggest goals.

So tomorrow when you‚Äôre tempted to wait for a surge of motivation, maybe try the disciplined route instead. It might not sound glamorous, but it‚Äôs the kind of thing that has your back even when you‚Äôre half-awake rummaging for coffee. And that‚Äôs the real game-changer.",1,1739315089.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

While I‚Äôm actively researching excavation techniques, fieldwork logistics, and published studies, I‚Äôd love to hear personal experiences from those of you who have worked in the field‚Äîespecially at dig sites!

My protagonist, Cassidy Lake, is a 28-year-old paleontologist with a Ph.D. She‚Äôs spent the last several years bouncing between field schools, research positions, and excavation projects to build her experience. At the start of the book, she arrives at Clearwater, Colorado (in between Rangely and Calamity Ridge (a dig site I made up to be located at Calamity Ridge Colorado), where she‚Äôs been hired as an experienced team member rather than an intern or student. She‚Äôll be working closely with one of the lead archeologists to help uncover what could be a significant dinosaur fossil find (we will see what me research leads me to) 

I want to make sure I get the day-to-day experience, challenges, and team dynamics right. My goal is to avoid stereotypes and create a character who feels authentic to the field. I‚Äôve compiled a list of 40 questions below, but any additional insight or personal stories would be incredibly helpful!

If you‚Äôve worked at a dig site before‚Äîespecially in a professional capacity‚Äîwhat was your experience like? What‚Äôs something most people don‚Äôt realize about fieldwork?

Thanks in advance! Your insight will help me shape Cassidy‚Äôs journey in a way that feels real. And of course, any advice on her character or my approach is welcome‚ÄîI‚Äôll take everything into consideration based on how it fits with my vision for the story.

FYI there are about 40 questions. One person doesn't need to answer all of these questions. You can answer a handful of them or a bunch of them and call it good. If you don't want to answer any of them that's fine. No worries üòäüòâ

17. How many hours per day were spent actively digging?


18. Were there any scheduled breaks besides lunch? How long were they?


19. Did everyone take breaks at the same time, or was it staggered?


20. What was your typical lunch at the dig site? Were there storage areas for food, or did everything have to be packed fresh each morning?


21. What kind of restroom facilities were available at the dig site? (Port-a-potties, trailer restrooms, or... just the wild?)


22. Did you have much free time in the evenings, or was it mostly eat, sleep, dig, repeat?


23. What did you and others typically do after a long day? (Did people go to restaurants, bars, or just crash?)


D. The Excavation Experience

24. What was the chain of command at the site? (Who reported to whom?)


25. How big was the excavation team, and what were the dynamics like?


26. What was your role in the excavation? Did you get to focus on specific tasks, or did everyone do a little bit of everything?


27. Did undergraduates and more experienced team members work together, or were there clear divisions between beginners and experts?


28. How much instruction was given on proper excavation techniques, or was it more ""learn as you go""?


29. Were any excavation methods different from what you expected?


30. How physically demanding was the work?


31. Did you discover anything interesting? (Bones, tools, artifacts?) Was anything groundbreaking or unusual found?


32. Were there any unexpected challenges‚Äîweather, dangerous terrain, difficult digs, etc.?


33. Did the site have an on-site lab or tent for cataloging and cleaning finds, or was everything taken elsewhere for processing?


E. Supervisors, Mentors, and Relationships

34. What were your supervisors or professors like? Were they also college instructors, or did they mainly work in the field?


35. Did supervisors share insights into their career paths and how they got into archaeology/paleontology?


36. Did you build strong relationships with anyone at the dig? Did the team bond, or did people mostly stick to their own friend groups?


37. Were there any funny, weird, or unexpected moments that stood out?


38. Were there any romantic entanglements at the dig site? (Because let‚Äôs be real‚Äîfield schools can be intense in many ways!)


F. Post-Dig Experience & Takeaways

39. Did you have to write a research paper or final report about your findings? If so, what was it about?


40. What advice would you give someone attending their first field school excavation?

Problem is I can‚Äôt afford to be picky. I need to EAT. Some of these aversions make sense but not all of them. 

Last week there was for example, the discussion of coffee in ice cream . Then one of the posters criticized the use of high fat dairy. It was like a switch flipped and now I‚Äôm very tense about drinking milk. Mind you it‚Äôs not actually not making it worse I just can‚Äôt get it out of my head. I had a tea latte and just couldn‚Äôt bring myself to finish it because of the milk.

Then I was so bored because they don't lead to bigger conversations like 'do you see a life together'. 

I did give lots of art away, money to charity etc but in the end I started hearing stories from other girls like: oh he got me a bag, he got me a coat, he flew me out to here and abcdef. Also I was watching those OF videos and it deeply made me question my own existence. So in end, I did sort of make some guys take me here and there and I do feel kind of bad.

(Ferrous gluconate 324mg tablet),"Hi there, I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this. I was prescribed iron tablets at kind of towards the end of December and it has been a roller coaster of side effects to say the least, but my iron and ferritin level were super low due to my anemia (very heavy periods). When I first started taking them, I would get super constipated for like the first 2 weeks but now I‚Äôm actually super regular, maybe too regular. It makes me extremely lethargic where I have to lie down for a bit (lying down as I type this). I used to get really bad stomach cramps at first but now they rarely occur, but I do get nauseous and my appetite has gone down significantly (it takes me longer to eat, and I‚Äôm already a slow eater). At first, I thought it wasn‚Äôt working because my heart palpitations and dizziness were the same if not worse but now they‚Äôre pretty much gone which I guess is good. But I know my anemia isn‚Äôt gone of course cause it‚Äôs only been a month and a half and I get super super cold still. How long did it take you guys to get used to your iron pills? Does it get better? I feel like it‚Äôs made me feel worse than I actually did before in terms of fatigue. Even if I get a full eight hours of sleep, I feel tired a couple of hours after waking up it‚Äôs annoying especially since I‚Äôm not a coffee drinker so I‚Äôm very dependent on my own energy to keep me up through the day. I‚Äôve seen people say I should try taking it at the end of the day when I‚Äôm going to bed with orange juice, a form of vitamin C.

I‚Äôm aware these are all symptoms of the pills (except for the fatigue) but I just would like them to stop lol and these symptoms aren‚Äôt all the time, some days I feel amazing other days I feel like absolute ass. I miss food. I get nauseous so easily and my appetite,my poor appetiteü•≤",2,1739314312.0,Anemic,0,1.0,False
1inbylq,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1inbylq/why_does_my_mom_lied_about_everything_even_little/,"Why does my mom lied about everything, even little things?","I asked my mom if she could do me a favour, i told her if she couldn't  then its fine but i had a stomach ache and i asked her if she could make me some noodles. I was in my bed, with a hot water bottle in pain and 10 mins go by, I called her and asked her and she said she made them but just forgot about it, so i said okay, but since you left the noodles so long in the water and it makes the noodles soggy can you make another one? She said okay. 10 seconds later she comes back upstairs, and i know it takes longer to reboil  the water in the kettle so ask her if she made a new one with new water and she said yes. Then she tried to give it to me and I told her I was upset, she asked why and I told her there was no way you could've made me a new one in that amount of time and she finally said yeah but look it's hot, the water is still hot. I said its not a matter of the water being hot it's the fact that the noodles are now soggy as shit, I told her to leave it, she said she would make me another one but i couldnt trust her. 

She also did this before when i told her i was spending ages trying to get the limescale out if the keytle and she said ""oh well you can just use the salt, but you dont know how to do it or how much water to put so ill do it for you"". she then she said it was done a few mins after and she made me the cup of coffee that I wanted, but i looked in the kettle and I saw the same abundance of limescale and lost my shit. I asked her why didn't she clean it and she said because she couldn't see anything and I'm imagining it. I told her I'm not imagining it and i took a photo of it on my phone, the limescale was literally floating around the kettle in cloudy circles, I showed her the picture and she said ""Oh for gods sake that's normal you can't clean a kettle every time you use it"". But i had never cleaned a kettle before, since she told me she will do it, but she didn't do it. She never does anything and I can't handle it. 

She infantalises me constantly, always calling my doctors/therapists and messaging them, despite me telling her that i can make appointments myself and I don't want her to interfere, the few times I actually want her to help me she does everything wrong. The worst thing is the lies and denies untill you lose your mind from the gaslighting and she finally admits that she's lying.
