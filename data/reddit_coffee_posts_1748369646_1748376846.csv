1. Morning or afternoon pop-up spots (outside storefronts, lobbies, shared spaces, etc.)
2. Events, markets, or community gatherings in need of a coffee vendor
3. Maybe even a deal on a semi permanent space where I can setup shop if it makes sense

I’d love to collaborate with some local businesses or join any upcoming events where coffee would be a good fit. Just need access to power and a little space to set up.

If you host events, manage a space, or know a business owner who might be open to this, I’d love to connect.

My fiancé and I are planning a honeymoon road trip in a Cruise America rented RV, and we’re hoping to bring along our dog (a pit he’s well trained). We’re both super excited about having this kind of trip, but since this is our first big RV adventure—and our first time traveling long distance with our dog—we’re looking for advice from anyone who’s done something similar!

About Us: •	We’re in our late 20s. •	We’ll be newly married and want something a bit nontraditional—less champagne and resort pools, more stars, hikes, and coffee over a campfire. •	We’ve done some camping, but no long-term RV travel yet. •	We have our RV rented from Sept 3- October 1

I asked ChatGpt to make an itinerary, but we aren’t married to it. I wanted to see national parks and go on beautiful hikes but I didn’t realize our dog wasn’t allowed in a lot of the NPs.   Can you look this over and provide some suggestions. We also have no campsites booked we want to do as much free camping as we can but I don’t know how possible that will be. I’m open to a completely new itinerary please give me your best ideas and advice!

1kwxelm,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kwxelm/the_woman_in_the_red_honda_civic/,The woman in the red Honda Civic,"I’ve always hated my job. When I was younger, being a park ranger sounded like freedom — long hikes, fresh air, solitude. At 27, it just feels like decay. Monotony wrapped in tree bark and silence.



*I used to wish something would happen.*



My daily shifts were always the same: rounds through quiet, wooded trails in SW Virginia. I worked mornings, so I never expected much more than the occasional bear or lost tourist. The sunrise was usually the highlight — pale pink haunting, bleeding through branches like something watching.



That morning started like all the rest.

Coffee. Boots. Silence.



Except for the car.

A red Honda Civic, tucked alone in the back of the parking lot. Faded paint flaking off like skin. I didn’t think much of it at first. Early hikers are rare, but not impossible. Still, as the hours dragged on and hikers came and went, that car never moved. It just sat there. Watching.



Toward the end of my shift, curiosity got the better of me. I crept toward it. Its windows were coated in grime, like a layer of sweat that never dried. I cupped my hands against the glass, peering inside.



Nothing. No ID. No bag. No smell.

Just an empty driver’s seat, and a faint imprint on the passenger side — like someone had been sitting there for a long, long time.

As I walked off, I realized a dimly shadowed figure reflected off the mirror of the car. Only issue was that I was the only one there at the time.



I told the night ranger in passing. He laughed it off. “You’re a good kid, nothings gonna happen to you. It’s on the inside that counts.”

It partly stuck with me.



Disappearances like these happened before. 

I never assisted in the search though.



Two days passed. I couldn’t stop thinking about the possibilities. 

I felt like I was in a grotesque horror movie and I was the next victim. 

A wimpy 5’8 stick — easier to overlook.



The car never moved. 



By then, the idea had burrowed deep inside me like a tick. I couldn’t let it go. A red car. A missing person, maybe. A reason — finally, a reason — to feel something on this goddamn trail. Even though it shouldn’t have, it exhilarated me. I felt like I, finally, had purpose.



No hikers came that day. The previous night’s rain had scared them off. It was just me and the Civic.



So I went looking.



Water bottles. Radio. Flashlight. I told myself I was doing my job, but even then I think I knew better. I wasn’t looking for someone to rescue.



Barely into the trail, I heard a noise: some type of groaning. 

Feeling tense, curiosity forced me off the trail and to the left.

Navigating through the thick and dense bunches of pine trees, I moved where the noise grew louder.



What first sounded like a mumble or groan turned into a shriek, almost making me turn back.

I wondered: 

What if it was the woman in the red Civic?

I had to help her.



Thus, I sprang forward, looking for the sound with more urgency.

About two minutes later, I came face to face with what I could only think was a doe.



Its stomach was mauled, almost like a bear got to it.

There weren’t any flies yet, but the smell of guts pouring out almost made me hurl.

It looked unnatural: no human nor animal could be so precise yet malicious.



At this moment, I felt for the woman in the red Civic. 

For the isolation in these woods.

For the terror of the unknown — hell, even I’m cautious around these woods.

But most of all, 

For likely being dead.



I knew I had to find her.

I knew this trail better than I knew myself. 



Now the real walking commenced. 



Around the three-mile mark, I found it — a puddle of mud where there shouldn't have been one. Thick. Murky. Unnatural. Like the ground itself had opened to swallow something. The forest felt too still. Birds had gone silent. Air too hot, too heavy, like breathing through wet cotton.



I stepped off the trail.

I told myself I was searching.



But really… I think I was following.

Something.



The trees got tighter the deeper I went, like they didn’t want me there. The underbrush clawed at my legs, and still I kept going. I was driven, but by what, I couldn’t say.



Then, suddenly, I stopped.



Nothing had changed — not the trees, not the light, not the air — but something was wrong. Like the woods had been holding their breath and finally exhaled.



Eventually I reached a clearing. Nothing special. Just a circle of dirt and dead leaves.



In the center was a backpack. Moldy. Faded. Like it had been here for years.



I dumped everything on the ground.



A cracked phone with one photo left in the gallery. 

A selfie of a woman in a red Honda Civic. Passenger seat. Smiling at someone just off camera. 

I checked the time stamp: 3 days ago.



Upon closer inspection, the woman’s face felt familiar, but I couldn’t place why.



Under the phone:A polaroid photo that the wind blew away from me.

One thing was left, but it was inside the bag. 

A note. Scribbled in sharpie on the inside flap:

“Don’t let him find you.”



Who was him? 

Was there someone in the forest that was dangerous… or something?



Looking around me, I realized the trees were carved with an assortment of large symbols. 

Triangles, circles, pentagrams; no one had, to my knowledge, been this deep off the trail.



That’s when I felt it behind me.



Like pressure on my lungs. Like being watched through keyholes.



I turned slowly.



A shape stood between the trees.

Tall. Too tall.

Human-shaped.

But wrong.



It didn’t look like anything I was warned about.

It was wrong.

Ungodly. 

It wasn’t walking. It was just… there.

Was it watching, preying on me?



I blinked hoping it would be gone.

It was still there, standing in that awkward position.

The trees around it moved.

Part of me felt terrified. *Only part.*



It got closer and I heard muffled whispers around. 

It wasn’t that I couldn’t make out what they were saying — I didn’t want to.

This all had to be bullshit.



I hoisted my gun and shot at that *thing* twice.

The safety was, oddly enough, already off.

The first bullet hit through the shadow into a tree; the shadow disappeared. 

The second struck something on the ground — a photo. 

I rushed to the polaroid, flipping it over; memories rushed to my mind which shook me to my core. 



*I was the man in the red Honda Civic taking the woman’s photo.* 



Then it hit me.

I didn’t come here to rescue the woman.

I came to finish what I had started.



The others got away.

*The next won’t.*



She had to run off before I could finish the job, though.

She had to hide in the woods — the one place I didn’t think to check.

She had to escape my grasp before I could finally get to her.



I wanted to save her from whatever’s in these woods.



That’s what made my stomach turn. Not guilt. Not fear. Just disappointment.

The game was over. 



I returned anticipating to see only the Civic in the lot.



*But it wasn’t.*



And that’s when I knew.

It wasn’t just the girl who was gone.

It was the story I told myself — that I was just curious, just bored, just doing my job.



I mean, I somehow had to entertain myself, right? 

Fuck what other fucking things could I’ve done in SW Virginia. 

I came here, not for the solace of the woods, but the isolation of them. 

It’s easier to prey in the shadows and between the branches than in an open, bustling city.



People warned me about Appalachia. 

The skinwalkers and mimics hunt people.

They drove them out and made them mad. 



*Skinwalkers are not real though.* 



Those shits are made up.

People go crazy from the desolation within the trees. 

The sunrises that are the highlight of their day.



I came here to see something so crazy it would exhilarate me. 

Instead, that lack of terror drove me mad. 



Because monsters don’t come howling in the woods.

They clock in at 5:00 AM and drink black coffee.

They stare too long into cars that don’t belong to them.

They feel nothing when someone goes missing — except a bitter taste when it’s not their hands that did the work.



And the worst part?



The game was over and I had lost. 



*I think I’ll miss the Civic.*

*Its blissful red paint peeling off, similar to the skin I planned to strip from her.*



Promptly returning home, I only knew one thing: I was hungry.

Entering my pantry, I finally found the woman — I cried out, clinging to her lifeless body.

She learned to embrace me for who I was; not responding was her form of support.



Now, I’ve invited a woman with a blue Convertible over. 



Blue is not quite my color. 

Don’t worry, I can always repaint.

After all, it’s on the inside that counts.",0,1748376543.0,nosleep,0,0.5,False

It's a bit tricky to get diagnosed in my country. 

I'm 19F, turning 20 soon. Diagnosed autistic and I've been taking lamotrigine, quetiapine and venlafaxine, please don't ask why - I've been bugging my current doctor to manage it differently. I'm experiencing what I believe to be early signs of mania/psychosis or full episode? Not really into the terminology so I apologise if some of the words are misused. I don't recall when I might have started to act like this.

 I had an abusive childhood because of my closeness with my father - which is currently in my siblings' life but not in mine. I remember that somehow I ended up messaging him around 1000 words of pure disappointment and frustration just to throw it out of my system and in return I got 2 words - ""Sunday dinner"". I had maybe slept 2/3 hours in total prioir to the meeting. My brother and sister were shocked that I was going with them which in hindsight makes perfect sense, my father's birthday was a few days prior to this situation.  I get there, anxiously text my best friends to tell me that everything's going to be fine and I black out? I might've suppressed it or smth but what I know is I screamed, cried and blamed in an ""aggressive verbal manner"" everything that went wrong in my life on him, accuse him of beating his new wife and their son as well as blurting some nonsense about his political choices and his father. Again don't really remember this. 

My sister drove me back home even though i'd been insisting on getting an uber to my friend's place. I sat at our couch for about 2/3 hours without moving just looking ahead with tears dripping at my skirt. My mum had tried make me eat but I'd only drunk a cup of coffee, though a bit later I ate half a cookie and she insisted that I have to try sleeping - so I took my meds and tried to sleep it off  - which did not happen for the next good few hours. Anyway, since then I have been having violent ideations? Like banging my head on the corner of a table or crashing my head into the carriage window during a train ride or cracking someone's joints. 

I've been managing to get by only because of caffeine - I feel like it's the only thing that keeps me grounded/ away from acting on some ""visions"". I've tried rebooking my psych visit earlier but it's still a week away. My therapy's on Monday and I really really don't want to get institutionalised. 

Again sorry if this isn't well written or understandable it's been rough 2 weeks. Any advice/kind words re much appreciated",1,1748376466.0,BipolarReddit,0,1.0,False

I was running errands yesterday and while out and about, I decided to go to a coffee shop I've never been to. It was decent coffee but the batista and I got talking and we ended up hanging put until she had to close.

 Towards the end, I asked if there was anything I could do to help her close up since it was my fault she was behind and she told me it there was one thing and asked for my number. I gave her my number and she gave me hers. Then we hung out in the parking lot. Last night she asked if I wanted to get coffee tomorrow (Wednesday) with  her and I said yes. I think she's super nice and we talked about a lot. We're both 20. And I don't know her exactly sexuality but she had a carabiner on her belt loop, a very short haircut with a beanie, and we talked about pride so I think my chances are good on that front.

Maybe an hour ago it dawned on me that this might be a date, not just a friend meet up. I am so so terrible at reading people so now I'm thinking she might have been flirting??? Do I have a date tomorrow? I don't want to approach it like its a date but it turns out it's just a friend meet-up and I definitely don't want to make her uncomfortable.

Years ago I've read a lot about espresso making and experimented with the machinery I had available at the time. Unfortunately I haven't had access to a decent grinder and machine for years so I want to freshen up my knowledge and skill since I recently got my hands on a (beginner) setup.

Recently got my hands on a Macap M2D and an ECM Casa 2 (aka Botticelli 2). I remember I had this guide saved in the past that showed me some simple graphs on what to tune to get to a certain result. Think of a triangle that showed acidity/bitterness/sweetness vs. coarser/finer/more/less coffee.... Also: extraction time is too short: grind finer, still to short, add more coffee. Everything just to get to a basic decent shot and extraction time, to finetune and nerd on from there...

Does anyone have a good tutorial guide, with a step to step plan, troubleshooting, just to get my basic knowledge and skill up to par, to dial-in my first decent shot? I find a lot of fragments online which are already quite specific, those are more easy to find (lighter roast, how to change grind setting e.g.).

1kwx9fo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwx9fo,First Rolex: Great Walk-In Experience in Meatpacking District Boutique,"Quick holiday weekend/early birthday trip to NYC yielded my first Rolex!

Yes, it's a Lady Datejust. Yes, it's a 28mm. Yes, I know from reading this forum that some of you will scoff. But I actually do have very small wrists . . .

The boutique in the Meatpacking District was closed when we first walked by Sunday morning but we later found ourselves across the street and decided to stop in. As we headed for the front door, we peeked in the display window and saw the exact configuration I've built time and time again on the Rolex website! I know how the ""for display only"" signs work and thought we should try. The boutique was packed and we were advised it would be a 90 minute wait. Since there was no guarantee the watch would be available to purchase, we declined to join the line and left.

After exploring more of the area, we decided to see if the wait had changed before moving on to our evening plans. We couldn't not make a real attempt when the configuration I've wanted for years was just sitting in the window!

We returned, put our name in the queue, and sat at the coffee bar. We moved our dinner reservation back 30 minutes and hoped we would be able to wait it out! We had a great time chatting with the barkeepers and generally watching the busy staff and other potential clients. At one point, I anxiously thought the watch I had my eye on was removed from the case and returned! After maybe 30-40 minutes, we were introduced to a SA, led to the back, and sat at a counter in the corner. We exchanged pleasantries and when asked what I was looking for, I said ""the exact watch you have in the window.""

She brought it out and it was just perfect. I walked over to a full size mirror to see how it looked against my body. I have always debated the 28mm vs 31mm size. This forum makes you think a 28mm is a play toy and not worth buying. But at the end of the day, there's a reason Rolex makes this watch. I do think I would like the thicker band of the 31mm (especially since I have an Apple Watch that has sort of conditioned me to a wider strap), but I believe the 28mm case is the correct fit for me. I measured - my wrists are 5.25"". I totally get the big watch trend but will pass on participating 😂

# STORYLINE

﻿﻿⌛ **Learn about Harrison Graves, the librarian!**

* Harrison Graves is an overqualified librarian by day and a hound for the supernatural at night. Too resilient for his own good, or perhaps just unnaturally unlucky, he's come out more mean being among monsters, and when it comes down to the wire, he'll do what's right so long as it remains convenient.
* The character has over twelve years of development, and he's been and done a lot of things. To start, he was a professor. After that, he delved into the sciences. Some time later, he became a mobster. Nowadays, he works at a library... most of the time, but old habits die harder than he does!
* I'll try to keep this simple and conventional, but I love it when Harrison is bullied or otherwise dunked on. Friends? Of course. Foes? For sure. The best kind of relationships with this character tend to be reluctant allies or even enemies-to-friends. Bonus points are given if the ally is a feisty young lady!

📔 **What are some of my plots and prompts?**

* Assist in a job given by the local monster mobsters to erase a debt to the lord of the land.
* Escape captivity from the local man-eating gangsters after a bounty is put on their heads.
* Take down a string of cult-related summonings in the middle of spooky autumn festivities.
* Work with the law and criminals alike to disrupt a new organ trade that's invading the city.

💥 **See something you like? Ask me about it!**

* I'm also open to other ideas, plots, and prompts. Those are just there to gauge your interest!

# EPILOGUE

💬 **Interested? Please send me a message!**

* Include a little about yourself in your introduction! The more effort, the better. I'd also love to hear what may have caught your interest, as well as any characters you feel would be a good match. Once we hit it off, I might ask for some sample writing. All good? Contact me when you're ready!

Insects chirping and dancing among the concrete ruins of capitalism signaled the arrival of dusk. For some reason or another, Harrison imagined that the afterhours of the Deep Dish Diner in Los Lunares would’ve been more lively, but nope – not at all. That was fine, though. As one might have imagined, a man with the last name of ‘Graves’ didn’t do ‘lively’ very well.

Nighttime was meant for reading, obviously. A pair of rectangular reading glasses sat on the bridge of his nose, looking down at the first book in a two-part series that he’d probably read a dozen times over, just to relax in the familiarity of it all if nothing else.

Harrison already knew how it’d all end. The woman that fell through the mirror would end up with the lovable young man that brought her through the multiverse by accident.

A story with a happy ending? Imagine that.

The waitress approached the bar counter. “What can I get’chu, hun?” she asked.

Country-fried steak? Chicken with gravy? Grand slam hamburger? None of these happened to appeal to his tastes at the moment, given the string of missing-turned-mutilated persons he’d had been lightly eyeing on the side for the past few weeks. It wasn’t his business, really… until higher powers made it so.

Harrison took one more glance at the menu and exhaled through his nose, trading any convictions he may have had about a diet for a breath of air. “A caramel blend shake.”

With a nod, she jotted down the request and pinned it to the dwindling roster of orders before taking her leave to attend elsewhere.

In retrospect, a milkshake probably wasn’t the best item to choose if he didn’t want to raise his cholesterol, but that one sweet tooth had other plans. The drive from Rowanwick to Los Lunares may not have been a particularly rigorous one – filled with ghastly eyes peering from the treeline, yes –  but he’d be damned if he did so without getting something good out of it.

For once, things were okay.

People came and went. Few lingered, likely weighed down by their own troubles or perhaps simply enjoying a coffee near the witching hour, both of which he’d become rather accustomed to on his own time. Harrison casually flicked a page between his fingers, his gaze fixated on the material of his mental escape as he waited.

The true problem? Things were not okay. In fact, things were so completely not okay that no one seemed to notice the glaring problem coming into view from the depths of the fog outside.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Under nightfall, it hunted. Like lightning, it struck. As the darkest day of the year crept further from its hole and upon man, so did the monsters that hid beneath its belly. Heavy footfalls echoed down the increasingly empty streets, followed by the rush of crisp autumnal winds carrying the faint chorus of thunder. Some would've called it ominous. The man known as Harrison Graves, however, found it far more terrifying.

Shallow gasps intermingled with a light pattering of rain, each of their steps sending an upheaval of grimy water, but dirtied boots were the least of his worries as his partner got snapped into the air like a ragdoll. Any pleas or screams she may have had lingering on the tip of her tongue were quickly silenced as a sickening splatter of crimson wetted the pavement.

No time to care nor any inkling of pity for the woman was present. With an increased drive to survive, the man rushed past a fallen street light, which had the unfortunate effect of leaving whatever followed in the dark, its winged shadow beating furiously for blood.

Up ahead lied an abandoned fishery – the designated safehouse for his people (although he loathed to call them such) and their endeavors. “Iron!” the man blurted, arms flailing and seemingly insane as he made his approach. “It doesn’t like iron!”

Fortunately, someone heard him. Unfortunately, they didn't listen. One of the guards, a boorish man of impressive size, slipped out from behind one of the old delivery garages. A war cry bellowed from his throat, loud enough to rival the excessive number of shots that cracked through the night at a near-invisible foe.

Harrison took this opportunity to dive inside the relative safety of the fishery just as his meathead friend laid his eyes on the last light he’d ever see. Neither tooth nor claw saw to his end, but rather a brilliant beam of lightning. Whoever he was mattered about as much as his smoldering remains did now.

The lone survivor of the ordeal slumped against an old crate and clutched at his heart, chest heaving as he attempted to regain his bearings. As good luck would have it, he wasn’t alone. “Anyone got a brain cell left?!” Harrison wheezed, eyeing the menagerie of allied faces – some of which were monstrous – between breaths. “I want every rusty nail and rod pulled out and shoved down that thing’s throat, and–!”

Something of a coughing fit hacked its way up his throat – a testament to just how not-used to all this extraneous activity the man was. “–You!” he continued, pointing a finger at the odd woman out. “The boss seems to think you’re worth something, so let’s put that to good use. Bring it down,” he commanded.",1,1748376027.0,AdvLiterateRP,0,1.0,False

I am a 55 year old male who had Stage 3 Rectal Cancer. I had chemotherapy and radiation and was told I had a complete response. Less than a year later I was told it was back and that I would require the Lower Anterior Resection procedure with an ileostomy. The surgery was successful. My resection is ultra low. I wore an ostomy bag for 3 months and then had the reversal surgery 3 months later.

  
It has now been 3 weeks since my ileostomy reversal. I feared the worse and thought I would be running to the bathroom constantly. The first few days that was the case, but now, not so much. Life has been far better than I had envisioned it to be. I go long periods where I do not go. Then, yes, there are times where it finally arrives. I have been very aware of what I am putting in and documenting it. I have been also very focused on how much I eat. This has helped. I do use imodium at times just as a precaution. For instance, when going to bed. It has never been a problem getting up to go at night for me. I actually feel like if anything the urge calms at night. I have been pushing the boundaries pretty early on. For one, I enjoy my morning cup of coffee. I heard that caffeine would cause bowel activity. For me, this has not been the case. Also, I introduced a glass of wine or two at night. This also has not been an issue. I did try a beer or two and notiv=ced that that may have caused some activity. Definitely more gassy. I have just now begun to introduce raw vegetables. I have not noticed an immediate issue. I started with light salad. First just greens and now I've been adding a vegetable at a time: carrot, onion, tomato, etc. I hear people experience lactose issues. I have been eating cheese regularly and yogurt and have not had an issue yet.

  
I am curious to hear how life has been going for others. I have posted in a few other discussions and heard of what people are going through, but I thought maybe I would start my own thread to begin a fresh conversation.

  
Thanks for reading and sharing your experience. This entire journey has, in a word, sucked. However, I have found hearing what others are going through to be very helpful.

My fiancé and I are planning a honeymoon road trip in a Cruise America rented RV, and we’re hoping to bring along our dog (a pit he’s well trained).

We’ll meet once a month, right here in the Joplin area, with plans to host gatherings in cute spots like coffee shops, local parks, and eventually my parlor room in my centurion house (Renos in progress!). The vibe is candlelit pages, comfy chairs, and just embracing girlhood.

Eventually, I’d love for us to grow into something more: bookstore crawls, themed retreats, little craft days, and more ways to celebrate the stories we love.

To stay in the loop, follow me on Instagram at @readingparlorsociety. That’s where I’ll post book selections, meeting details, and updates. You can also DM me there if you’re interested in joining or want to chat.

So I decided to build something to speed things up not just for me, but for others too.

The idea is simple: instead of scrolling endlessly through job posts and jump from one website to another, you just upload your resume. Then AI does the work matching you with real tech jobs in Europe that actually fit your profile.

For free users, the number of matches and their quality is limited. While for the cost of a coffee, you get more high quality jobs.

I’ve tested it with friends and the results have been good people are getting matches they would’ve found on their own (or maybe yes, but in more time).

The idea is to keep it improving, adding more job boards and so on. For now I got few purchases, but I'd like to know what would be the best marketing channel for it in your opinions (I come from a tech background, almost no skills in marketing).

I’m hoping to get some insight or hear from anyone who might be going through something similar. I’m a 24-year-old woman, have never been pregnant or given birth, and have been on hormonal birth control since I was 18. I’ve also been on SSRIs for a while and take Adderall daily.

For context, I’ve struggled with constipation most of my life. It’s not usually painful, just infrequent and inconsistent. A lot of factors seem to affect it—whether I’ve taken Zofran (I deal with chronic nausea), how much I’ve eaten, if I’ve had coffee, etc. I drink a lot of water, I’m fairly active, and while I’ve had eating disorders in the past, my eating habits have significantly improved. I usually have BMs around 3–5 times a week, sometimes less, and I’ve noticed Adderall tends to help “get things moving.”

Anyway—about a year ago, I started getting this strange feeling in my vaginal opening. Not painful, but definitely off. The best way I could describe it to my doctor was a “turtlehead” feeling… but in my vagina (I know how ridiculous that sounds). It felt like pressure or heaviness, almost like something was about to fall out. It got better before my OB appointment and I ended up forgetting about it.

Now, it’s back—and it’s been happening consistently for the past two weeks. Still no pain, but the same sensation of heaviness and pressure, especially when I’m sitting or reclining with my legs out. It’s unsettling, and the feeling sometimes takes my stomach with it, like that internal alarm going off when something doesn’t feel right.

I’ve been reading a lot about pelvic floor dysfunction and possible prolapse. I don’t think anything is visibly bulging or out of place, but I honestly realized through this that I don’t know much about what “normal” even looks like down there, which is kind of disheartening. I did take a picture, mostly for educational purposes and comparison, but I wasn’t sure how posting that works on here.

I recently had sex with my partner (which doesn’t happen super often due to low libido from SSRIs), and I did notice it was a bit painful at first—like my body needed time to adjust to insertion, which isn’t usually the case for me.

I do have an appointment scheduled with my OBGYN, but it’s a long wait, and I’m kind of stuck in this anxious limbo. I looked into pelvic floor therapy, but my insurance will only cover it if it’s deemed “medically necessary,” which means I need to be seen by a doctor first. I wish I could just skip straight to a specialist.

I guess I’m posting to see if anyone else has had similar symptoms or feelings, and if so, what helped? If this is a pelvic floor issue, I’m nervous about what it might mean for future childbirth—even if it’s mild. Just feeling a little weird and thrown off lately. It’s that gut-dropping feeling when you know something in your body isn’t quite right, but you can’t put your finger on it.

Thanks for reading if you made it this far—any insight, experiences, or even validation would be really appreciated.

Wondering if it’s pelvic floor dysfunction or something else. Sex has been slightly painful recently. Waiting on an OBGYN appointment. Curious if others have experienced this and what helped.

As you guys know, I love Alec's and I'm always on the hunt for flavors from them that I haven't tried yet. I also love coffee ice cream, so this was right up my alley. Found at Wholefoods. 

The last coffee ice cream I tried was VL's coffee affogato. My main complaint with that one was that it tasted like cream with barely a hint of coffee, so when I saw the darker color in this Alec's pint I was excited. The coffee taste was strong and robust, but still creamy with the perfect amount of sweetness to balance it out. It had more of a genuine coffee coldbrew taste without being bitter, which I really enjoyed. 

The chocolate covered toffee pieces were on the smaller side but still quite crunchy. I was actually very surprised at how much toffee flavor was packed into those little pieces! When you got one in a bite, it tasted like a deep, almost nutty caramel. The only downside was that there weren't quite as many as I would have liked. 

To conclude, this ice cream was delicious and I would definitely purchase it again. It had a stronger coffee flavor than I usually find in store bought pints, and the toffee pieces were very flavorful and crunchy. ",10,1748375189.0,icecream,1,1.0,False

As Caliope was walking on the streets, she was heading towards her new job. She had to be there sharply on time, as her new boss was a woman of impeccable punctuality, famous for her schedules and following them strictly.

She stopped right in front of a tall building and only then did she realize the neighborhood she was in. It was a business district, and her new job was to simply look after a house and the son of her employer, whom she was told, had a rare mental illness. Her face reflected her puzzled mind; she looked down to the piece of paper then up to the tall and scary building. It might have taken her a few seconds more than she was supposed to, as the security guard walked towards her.

May I help you, young lady?

She chuckled and tried to hold a laugh, which did not make the guard happy at all. I am sorry Sir, but I think someone gave me the wrong address. I am supposed to meet a Miss Elaine Clark? In her home address?

The guard looked shocked, yet instantly nodded and changed his manners towards her. He showed her the way inside the building and even offered her a coffee once they were waiting for confirmation at the reception desk.

Finally, after some minutes, a small door opened and a very skinny old lady came through it, nodding to the guard and then to her. He greeted her with a smile. Evening Magna.

Evening Gerard, thank you, I will take her to the Madame now. Hello, you must be Caliope, am I correct?

Yes, that is me, how did you know?

Come, follow me, you are just in time, and the Madame was not waiting for anyone else but you.

The old lady grinned as she led Caliope across the door she came in, and towards the service area where both went up on the elevator to the 15th floor. So far, Caliope made up her first impressions on the building and the people: they were old and gray.

As the elevator stopped, the old lady pulled out a key from her pocket, inserted it on a special place in the panel, and only then, the doors opened. A very elegant yet simple living room welcomed them, and Magna offered to take her coat and hold her bag. Then she led Caliope towards a bigger living room; apparently, the one before was a room for service people only. Fancy she said to herself.

Caliope had decided not to make any bad impressions so she kept her eyes looking to the place she would take a seat, and once there, her eyes were focused on her hands resting softly on her knees, crossing her legs elegantly. A little bell rang, and a wooden bird came out from some place in the room. That made her look up and to her surprise, a tall, dark-haired elegant business woman was walking towards her. Caliope stood up quickly, taking care her skirt was in place.

I love sharp-on-time people, good first impression Miss Woodward. Her interviewer, Miss Elaine Clark, began.

Thank you, Miss Clark, pleasure to meet you.

She smiled and sat on the sofa in front of her. Please, take your seat, and tell me a little bit more about you, like for example, your name

Yes, it is written with a C and just one L on purpose. She smiled softly.

""That indeed got me curious."" Miss Clark chuckled graciously. ""Tell me why your mother picked such an interesting name.""

Even if she thought this was such a silly subject, Caliope decided to humor her new employer. To her surprise, she realized that no one ever asked her before about her name. She also noticed that Miss Clark was a very classy lady, around her late 40's, well styled, beautiful skin, kind voice, she could even be wrong on assuming her age.

""I picked my own name Miss Clark, My parents both died in an accident when I was very young, an unfortunate classic story, and I went through many foster homes, many first and last names. When I turned 18, I wanted a name of my own, written as I wanted, as my own personal statement, and that is how Caliope was born.""

""I must admit I am quite fond of your name; I like it and don't get me wrong, but it's mostly why I had chosen you among other several resumes on my desk. I like a unique personality.""

This caused Caliope to laugh nervously, imitated by Miss Clark, who realized the time was running fast. She called back Magna and as she was standing, both ladies picked up their purses and walked towards the door.

""Make yourself comfortable Miss Woodward, my son rarely comes out of his room, his name is Amra, please assist him if he needs something, he will return to his room as soon as he gets what he wants.""

""I will Miss, have a good day and you as well Lady Magna.""

Miss Clark and Magna both smiled and the elevator doors closed. Caliope was a bit scared now as she was alone in a very unfamiliar environment, with a stranger who she did not know yet.

The first minutes alone in the elegant apartment Caliope walked in silence, exploring her way in the new place. She found the bathroom, or at least one of them, strategically close to the front doors. After a few more turns around the big living room and discovering a few hidden spots, she sat down on the small service area where she thought she was more comfortable. She took out her tablet, the last gift from her ex-boyfriend, and started to read the second half of a book she had pending to finish.

She heard a loud door closing, her eyes opened wide and to her surprise, she realized she had fallen asleep. She stood up and looked toward the door making the noise and found Miss Clark at the main living room.

""Caliope, how did it all go? Everything calm? Have you met my son?""

""Welcome back Miss Clark, no, I haven't met him yet, everything was so calm I admit I nodded off at least once. Not even a phone rang.""

Miss Clark chuckled as Caliope felt a bit awkward, and since she realized Magna had not returned with her, at least for now, she was alone with Miss Clark and it was an opportune time to clarify some doubts.

""Miss Clark, do you mind if I ask you a few things? I am a little confused.""

""Go ahead Caliope, I have some spare minutes.""

""First of all, what exactly was I hired for? I remember sending you my resume a year ago, for what it was then, an assistant opening role. Suddenly I had a call from your secretary yesterday and offered a -similar- job starting today. But doing what?""

Miss Clark stopped everything she was doing, turned her head, locked her eyes on Caliope, forming a small grin on her lips. With a hand gesture, she made Caliope take a seat, as she herself joined on the opposite one.

""You are a very smart girl, I can see that, and at only 27 you have more spirit than many, not to mention your witty character, and your openness. That is correct; your resume was given to me last year, but by then the spot was filled. I did not shift it back to the bunch of rejects, though, as I thought you had potential. You have unfinished studies on psychology, and a nice background as an assistant, not only in this city but in other cities as well.""

Miss Clark took a small break, a deep breath, and looked around the room then back at Caliope, and her smile exposed some sadness.

""I love my son Caliope, but he is very special, and though he doesn't require constant attention, when he needs something and can't find it or get it, all hell breaks loose. I need someone who can assist me while I am in my house, and when I am not here as well, as I have many papers in my home office. But most of all, I need you to be here just in case for him. You will find the salary is already more than what a regular assistant would earn, and I need you to sign some legal paperwork where it would specify you as my personal assistant. Your work with mentally ill patients and your, not complete, but not small knowledge of psychology, should help you with my son. I hope this is clear enough for you, and I hope you still want to work with me. In a few words, you would be my home assistant, and keep an eye when it is needed on my son. Do not worry, he is not violent at all.""

Caliope was pondering each word Miss Clark was revealing, it was obvious her experience brought her there, and the job sounded so easy, that for such a nice amount of money, would help her settle down on her new adventure of living alone. Above all, Miss Clark was being honest, and she would still give her some extra work while she was there, she seemed nice and polite, not an arrogant person, like so many nowadays. Caliope started to remember her previous employer and showed dislike on her face.

""Do you hate the idea so much?""

""Oh, no! I am sorry Miss Clark, I was just thinking of what you told me, and yes I would love to.""

""And you put that face when you love things?"" Miss Clark chuckled.

""I am so very sorry Miss Clark! I was thinking to myself that you are different from other people with the same status as you. My recent memories of prior employers exposed my expression."" She laughed nervously.

""I could dig up your history if I have to, I had a very cryptic denial to reveal any information about your work with your previous employer, and his assistant didn't want to give us even a word. But I understand if you don't want to reveal more.""

""I am not surprised Miss Clark, Mister Rawer was a very smart man in business, but he had bad taste in women.""

Miss Clark perked a brow ""is that so?""

Caliope nodded ""yes, among all the women he could have had, he picked me.""

"" Oh well, that does make sense, I find you adorable.""

Caliope blushed but decided the subject to be left there. ""Lets just say we had a relationship that ended badly, and leave it at that.

Miss Clark nodded ""Ok darling, you are all set, my lawyer will bring the legal papers of your contract tomorrow morning, and you can leave now if you like, I will see you tomorrow at the same time.""

""Thank you very much, Miss Clark, it is going to be a pleasure to work with you.""

""A little present waits for you in the front desk when you leave the building, I don't take back presents, and consider it well earned. See you tomorrow Caliope.""

""Good bye Miss Clark, thank you. See you tomorrow.""

Caliope went to the service area and picked up her coat and bag. She took the elevator which opened quickly; a nervous but bright smile was clearly showing on her face as she started to walk towards the exit of the building where the old guard nodded and gave her a package, smiling as she finally walked out.

She was about to cross the street when a man in a suit called her name. Looking at him she noticed he was standing by a beautiful car. Probably he was a driver.

""Miss Woodward?""

""Yes, that is me, and you are?""

""I am Miss Clark's driver, she asked me to wait for you so I can take you to your residence.""

""Oh, of course, thank you.""

More gifts that made Caliope more than happy; she stepped into an elegant car and get home in less than half the time it normally took her. Once she was comfortable, she was thankful that the driver was silent, not looking for conversation.

She opened the package the old guard gave her and took out the different objects inside. A key, very similar to the one Lady Magna had, easy to know what it was for. A copy of the document she was going to sign to the lawyer the next day, so she could read it in advance. A card with all Miss Clark's personal and office phone numbers, as well as some offshore lines. She found and opened a smaller envelope, with a little stash of money and a letter with a small message:

""A gift I won't take back. A present and a sign of trust. Buy yourself dinner and something else to pamper yourself, see you tomorrow. Ms. Clark.""

Caliope was very happy, nervously happy; it was all coming out great and it seemed all her bad luck from the last couple of years was finally turning around to positive experiences.

Just a few months back, her obsessive ex-boyfriend and boss was making her regret ever having dated him in the first place. To her it was simple, he was becoming too obsessive and controlling. She asked him for some freedom and in return he locked her in his apartment for a day, but all of that was forgiven. Until he contacted her last adoptive mother to know all about her years with them, even after knowing her foster father abused her and her foster mother did nothing to stop him.

He knew Caliope did not want to be back in touch with them, it was too much for her, and when she decided to break up, he tried to kill himself, only to keep her with him longer.

She finally contacted a lawyer and made all the papers necessary to keep him at a distance, which was possible after he threatened her with a letter, giving her the needed evidence. But now all of that was in the past, he was gone; she was in a new city, new job, and new life.

That night Caliope ordered a delivery of Chinese food, one of her favorites. She sat in front of her small TV and watched a show while eating her dinner, then she went to bed with a big smile on her face; sleep came slowly as she was too excited for her new job.

#  Amra

Next morning she woke up early, picked up the second of the two suits she had, put the one from the day before in her washing machine and made a note to herself to remember to take it out and iron it when she returned that night. After her shower she got dressed and picked up her bag, then the bell rang, and she stopped to think for a second. She had not expected anyone. She started walking slowly towards the door, and once there, peeked to see who it was. She started to breathe again, it was Miss Clark's driver back to pick her up.

Once Caliope inserted the special key, the elevator doors opened and she walked in smiling. Lady Magna was there greeting her as she was picking up her bag and walking towards the door to the big living room.

""Miss Woodward please walk with me. Miss Clark will be with us soon, she asked me to guide you through the apartment.""

""Thank you... that would be very helpful.""

""You already know the living room. And towards the front door is the guest's bathroom. Now, don't forget that you can use it too if you like.""

""I would try to avoid that but thank you for letting me know.""

""Easiest way to remember your way back is imagining the living room as the center, elevators as part of said center. The full apartment is made around it. Starting from the service rest area, The Kitchen and the dining room are over there, the next important room is the Study. The Library of Miss Clark is the following, and then a guest's room. A second bathroom there, and the next room is Miss Clark's son's room. Young Amra has his own bathroom. Right next is Miss Clark's room and her own bathroom as well. There is another room following hers, used to store personal things from Miss Clark so This is a room no one enters but her and her son. The dining room again, and the kitchen. A small room with all that is necessary for the apartment's cleaning. That leads us back here. Do you have questions?""

Caliope was trying to memorize each room and then quickly shook her head. It didn't sound hard, the apartment, as big as or even bigger than any of her previous residences, was very well ordered, helping her immensely.

""Thank you Magna, may I ask, do you remain here at times? During the day?""

""My job, among other things, consists of what you are going to do as well, but I only work during nights, and directly with Miss Clark, I don't deal with her son.""

A little hint of bitterness was detected on her statement, and just then Miss Clark came out of her room finishing combing her hair to the side.

""Oh Caliope, I am happy to see you. Magna, can you make sure this envelope goes straight to our main client in his private residence today?""

""Yes Miss Clark, I am going to be waiting for you downstairs. Bye Miss Woodward, have a good day.""

""Goodbye Magna, enjoy your day as well. Hello Miss Clark, it is nice to see you.""

Miss Clark was smiling entertained by some private joke and as soon as Magna left on the elevator, she motioned Caliope to join her at the Kitchen. As she poured herself a glass of fresh juice, and offered Caliope another, she smiled warmly at her.

""Magna is a very smart woman, who I have come to know for a long time, and have worked with even longer. But she doesn't get along with my son. I also need a lot of help, and she is a bit sensitive with the fact that I wanted to hire someone else to help me and also be with my son.""

Caliope understood quickly why Miss Clark was telling this to her, she must have heard Caliope asking Magna about her job, and also like her, noticed her tone. Miss Clark continued.

""To be honest, it was my son who suggested to make Magna very busy on other things and as far from him as possible. You don't have to worry about a thing, she is not holding any bad feelings toward you.""

""I am not worried, but I do thank you for telling me. Anything in particular you wish me to do for you as you are gone today Miss Clark?""

""As a matter of fact, there is some paperwork I have been working on, and even Magna forgot about it. But first, have you read the copy of the legal contract I wanted you to sign today?""

Caliope blinked and swallowed hard, she had forgotten to read it, but she did not know how it would make her look. At her sudden hesitation to reply, Miss Clark quickly added.

""I am sure you did not have enough time, so it is ok, you can take this morning to finish reading it, and at noon, one of my personal lawyers will come to collect your signature, is that ok with you?""

""Yes Miss Clark, thank you very much, I appreciate all your patience and support towards me.""

""I am happy you are here Caliope, and now it is time for me to run. Have a beautiful day dear.""

As soon as she finished her sentence, Miss Clark returned to the living room, picked up her bag, and lead herself to the front elevator.

""And Caliope, when you finish with those legal papers, the other paperwork is on my study, make yourself at home.""

And the elevator doors closed on her last words, leaving Caliope completely alone at the room. She ran to her bag and took out the copy of the contract she was going to sign later, took a seat and started to read each line carefully. It was nothing out of the ordinary, but Miss Clark made it sound important. A few articles were not what she would have expected, but she was committed to make her job career start there, and reading about long night hours or trips outside of the country made her even more interested in her new job.

She finished reading the contract about 30 minutes before noon and decided to wait for the lawyer before starting with Miss Clark's paperwork, when she felt something strange. The apartment was on the 15th floor, but it seemed quieter than usual. The hair behind her neck started to rise and she felt a little agitated without a reason. As if something was going to happen, she stood up and carefully started to look around the room. Their eyes met and she felt her heart skip a beat. He was tall, very tall; he might as well be built to work as a bodyguard, strong, and with a powerful presence. He was easily double her size. ""Caliope... I presume"" she heard the words, but she could have sworn his lips did not move. Her eyes were locked on his, so she just might have missed it.

""Hello, and you are?""

""I am Elaine's son, and you are Caliope, right?""

""Yes... yes I am Caliope, nice to meet you Amra.""

He stared at her and she felt the goosebumps rise on her arms and legs, it was as if his gaze drew some kind of magnetism that made her feel unbalanced. The phone rang: and it all stopped as soon as she looked for the phone, feeling the air was normal again, picking up the phone she turned towards Amra but he wasn't there anymore, nor anywhere else. She took a few seconds to finally answer the phone.

""Hello, this is the Clark's residence.""

The other side was the front desk at the entrance of the building, they were announcing the arrival of Miss Clark's lawyer and he was coming up to meet her now. She ended the call with a frown and looked at the wall clock, it was one pass noon.

How could that be? A few moments ago she could have sworn that there was still 30 minutes left to noon. The elevator doors made a little sound and then opened, a suited grey-haired man walked in with a polite smile.

""Miss Woodward? I am Chansey, Miss Clark's personal lawyer; I have brought your contract.""

""Nice meeting you Mister Chansey, please take a seat, do you wish something to drink?""

""Oh no, thank you very much, but I am in a rush, I need you to sign them and I am going to leave you alone, I have other clients to visit before going back to Miss Clark with everything in order.""

He rested his briefcase on the small table located near the couch and opened it, taking out two sets of papers, and a pen.

""I was told you already read the copy and agree to all that is stated, so I only need your signature.""

""Yes, I have read it all, two copies?""

""Yes, one for you, one for Miss Clark."" He nodded.

He pointed to both copies of the contract and where she needed to sign, she quickly signed both. Chansey smiled at her and folded one for him, locking his briefcase, and then handling the other to her.

""Welcome to your new job Miss Woodward, now if you excuse me, I am going to help myself out. Have a wonderful rest of your evening Miss!""

And just as fast as he arrived, he left quickly but graciously. She even chuckled and looked at her contract almost with disbelief.

After the papers were in her bag, she headed to the ready to serve Kitchen, opened the fridge and smiled as everything was organized, fresh lettuce drew her attention, some cheese and bread, and she had made herself a light lunch to hold until the afternoon. She asked herself if she should prepare something for Amra but neither yesterday nor today he had asked for anything at all, and today he only left his room for a few seconds, then he was gone. As she started to eat her sandwich, she reviewed the scene on her head, his presence made her feel strange, half scared, and half alert, perhaps she was surprised and nervous. He was older than she imagined, maybe even her age.

Once she finished her lunch, cleaned her plate, and grabbed a glass of juice, she went to Miss Clark's study and quickly found the paperwork she had mentioned. A stack of different reports on multiple real estate properties that offered large country houses for rent and sale. She wasn't sure what Miss Clark wanted to do with them; but then she found a little note on the corner of the desk: ""Please study the best offers, I need to buy at least four properties, make sure their prices are worth what they offer, the phone is free for your use.""

Her eyes moved from one paper to the other, with some marked in red that looked like her first choices. She decided what Miss Clark wanted following the ones the market offered. She selected a few more then started to make the calls, asking a few questions and confirming at the end of 3 hours, that the best way to know if this properties were offering what they really wanted, was going to see them, but they were spread all over the country.

She wrote a report on her tablet, and saved it on a file, making a mental note to ask Miss Clark how to access a printer since there was not one to be seen in the room.

Later that afternoon, Miss Clark arrived with tired eyes to her residence, offering Caliope a gentle smile.

""I hope your day was better than mine dear, tell me if you finished looking at my paperwork please.""

""Welcome home Miss Clark, I had gone over all of it and made a report on my tablet, but I haven't found a printer around. How can I get this to you?""

Miss Clark smirked ""Good old fashioned pen and paper could work as well Caliope.""

""I will have it for you in the morning then if that is ok with you, Miss Clark.""

""Don't worry darling, you can print it and turn it back to me tomorrow, I was only teasing.""

Caliope smiled and offered a glass of water to Miss Clark.

""Thank you darling, but I am going to take a shower and have some dinner with my son, have you met him yet?""

""Briefly, just before your lawyer arrived.""

That got Miss Clark's attention and she turned her head towards Caliope with new found interest.

""I hope he was civilized, if he wasn't, please accept my apologies.""

""Oh don't worry Miss Clark, he was very polite, we did not talk much, he did nothing more than to cross a few words then return to his room.""

Miss Clark took a deep breath and nodded, smiling to Caliope and waving a hand softly, the tiredness creeping back on her fast.

""Thank you darling, you can go now, see you tomorrow ok?""

""Yes Miss Clark, have a good night.""

""Good night Caliope, be well.""",1,1748375132.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1kwwp8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1kwwp8a/do_i_forgive_mil_after_ruining_pregnancy_and/,Do I forgive MIL after ruining pregnancy and postpartum?,"MIL has always ignored my boundaries and she’s never been my favorite person. I kept telling myself we were just very different and I should appreciate her trying. After my pregnancy and now I’m 4 months postpartum, I’m starting to believe I have accepted her BS for way too long and get sick of just the thought having to spend time with her or having LO spending time with her.

It all started when we announced my pregnancy and first thing she said was: I’m too young to be a grandma. Mind you: she’s 67.

It all went downhill from there. Every time we would see her, she would trauma dump her birth story, warn me about how horrible postpartum was going to be for me and tell me I was never going to fit my jeans again. She would judge my belly for being too small and once it popped, it was too big. She would compare having a newborn to losing a family member to death. Basically trying to scare me all the time. I once snapped and calmly and politely told her: this baby is already on it’s way, there’s nothing we can do about it now.

We ignored her pushing to be there while I would be giving birth. Around my due date, she would call us every. single. day. Sometimes twice a day. She got annoyed our LO came one week after due date and told my DH LO was late, just like his mom always is. She always expects me to arrive for dinner while I’m at work. I can’t cut my work shift short just because she wants an early dinner, right? She hasn’t worked for years so for sure does not know what she’s talking about.

12 hours after giving birth, DH and I called my and his parents. My parents live a few hours away and we asked them to come visit us next day. We asked ILs to come the same day, at a specific time. They showed up an entire hour early. We get professional medical help at home, the first week after birth. This sweet woman was with us for 12 hours since the birth of LO and was trying to get us ready for our first night with LO and wrap things up to go home. She panicked when ILs showed up an hour early, because she wanted to explain us some more stuff. I had to calm her and DH down and suggest to leave ILs in living room by themselves and ask them to wait for her to finish her explaining us the necessary stuff. We live in a small apartment and our bedroom is basically next to our living room. I could hear MIL complaining while she had to wait. Once the sweet lady helping us left after she briefly introduced herself to ILs, my MIL started complaining about her immediately. She expected her to serve her a coffee and clean the house. Being 12 hours postpartum, I was not capable of listing or reacting to her complains. Her complains about this sweet lady did not stop there. MIL made some room to complain how our son only has one name, how he does not have dark hair of eyes like his dad, but mostly she decided to hate on this sweet lady who spend 7 days helping me getting started with breastfeeding. DH started to fall for MIL complains and was annoyed with the sweet lady for not cleaning our house or serving guests. I had chosen this lady and discussed my wishes for BF to work out with her beforehand and was so thankful for her dedication. I just hit the 4 months mark of exclusively BF and I’m still thankful for her help every day. This is the most difficult yet beautiful and empowering thing I’ve ever accomplished and I hope I will get to do it for as long as LO and I want. MIL kept complaining about the sweet lady and after hearing her complains for so many times, I was very straight forward and told her the lady helped me in many ways I needed and did everything I expected her to, nothing less. After this confrontation, she was flabbergasted but never spoke about it again. I hate confrontation but she kept pushing my buttons continuously until I couldn’t take it anymore. Yet I was still very calm and collective when confronting her on this.

I lost my shit a few weeks later. This post is getting way too long but to give you the full picture (and to try and get all of this out of my system, her behavior is consuming me 24/7 on bad days) here’s some of the things she decided to do during my first weeks/months postpartum:
- Force me out on first walk with LO when it was freezing cold. I was 8 days PP and could not really walk that far yet. After a 10 minute walk I told DH we needed to go back because I started experiencing a lot of pain and we still needed to walk back 10 minutes. MIL screamed at me: you want to go back already? We just made it outside.
- A few days later DH, LO and I took the car to go fr our first walk in a local park. She decided to show up, force me to walk for 45+ minutes and got annoyed with me when I asked if we could go home. When I was trying to put LO in carseat for the first time, she kept interrupting me and telling me I was doing it wrong
- Judged me for BF and continuously asking me when I would finally stop, because everybody wants to give LO a bottle. As someone who has really struggled with getting BF started, this has broken my heart many times. At every ILs family visit, she either judges me for BF and puts me in a freezing room or gets annoyed when I bring a bottle of pumped milk. Asking why can’t you just BF LO?
- Judged DH for taking 3 weeks of vacation from work to be with me and LO
- Brought her sick sister to see LO for the first time and got upset with me after I told her her sister could not hold LO
- Screamed at me on the phone after I told her not to come and babysit LO while sick. I was so sick of her behavior at this point that I waited to call her until DH was home and made him listen to how she was screaming at me. He was shocked and told me she needs to step up her game if she still wants to see LO. 

I got scared when DH angrily suggested going NC as I grew up without any grandparents (they all passed away young) and do not want this for our LO. On the other hand MIL is driving me absolutely insane. I loved being pregnant, had a great birthing experience and the best partner and I would not have had a rough time PP if MIL wouldn’t have had to make all of this about her. 

Any advice on how to deal with this kind of behavior without going NC? — Thank you so much for letting me rant and reading all the way through!",20,1748374883.0,JUSTNOMIL,12,1.0,False

Always been interested in projectors, love how they look when done well and the tech seems to have advanced to deal with some ambient light now and can be ""daily driven"" vs reserved for the home theater.  Have done a bit of research but am running into information overload and hoping for some clarity/help.

Budget: $3500 all in (projector + screen).  100""-120"" screen size.

Use case: Living room (16' x 14').  Mainly use our TV at night for movies/shows/gaming (would say it's a 70/30 split night/day use and an excuse to read more books during the day is always welcome).  There are 4 windows in the room but little direct light.  We are surrounded by trees on the outside and our 2 main sun facing windows (which will be opposite the screen) are recessed by a deep front porch.  Screen would be wall mounted fixed for now (due to budget); would hide it with a large piece of art when not in use (tapestry/painting/etc).  Long term would be ceiling mounted, hidden within built in bookcases but that is a few years out.

Thought process: I had started by looking at short throw projectors, considered the Benq TK700 series a good option as a first projector that can handle some ambient light and gaming.  Biggest drawback as we settle into the space is not having a dedicated coffee table or location to mount the projector (not considering ceiling mounted).  Looked at UST options which would work well with our current entertainment center.  The Formovie, Samsung LSP7, and Wemax all seem like valid options.  Debating a fixed ALR screen right off the bat or a basic fixed wall mounted white screen to get started, replace with ALR drop down when we are ready to finish the room properly.

Any opinions on the Benq TK700/UST options mentioned and short throw vs UST would be very welcome.  Would a refurbished projector (ex: Hisense PX2 Pro) be safe to trust?  Looking to finalize and purchase in the next few weeks.  Appreciate the help!",1,1748374738.0,projectors,1,1.0,False

I work from home part time, and my mornings are my me time. I have my coffee, I sit and read or watch part of a Netflix show and then I start working.

I am DREADING Summer… today is the first day I have my two stepkids (male 9 and male 10) at home with me all day and they’re so loud, needy and just so much to deal with 24/7 during the summer. One of them has a horrible attitude and has constant potty issues that stem from ODD and he’s just a very difficult kid to be around.

They also don’t understand the concept of alone time. I have a room that I use for working/reading/just being quiet but whenever I’m in there, they barge right in and just talk and bring the dog in and it gets chaotic. I’m terrified of this summer being awful like last summer, where I felt like a live in maid to them and like they expected me to be at their beck and call. Their Dad has put his foot down and made sure that they know that I am not their maid or at their service, but I know how they are when he’s at work and I’m alone with them. They act like different kids (in a bad way) when it’s just me home. So I’m dreading the next 8 weeks.

I also hate how even though we have 50/50 with their bio Mom (who works from home) for some reason on OUR days, while
My husband is at work the kids are just home with me. Asking me to go take them places/do things for them… 50/50 custody is for them to spend time with parents, right? I’m not a parent. I don’t understand why so many parents seem to think that their partners are assumed child care. I get this is a convo I need to have again with my

So how do I gently yet firmly tell my stepkids to leave me alone during the day when I’m in my office/in my bedroom?

Now everyone smells bad. “Bad” smells are amplified, particularly halitosis.","I got Covid for the third time sometime at the end of 2023. The symptoms like fever and muscle weakness and shortness of breath were not as bad or long lasting as the other two times. But I lost my sense of smell completely. Coffee beans, perfume, flowers, body odor, nothing. I learned to live with it. I resigned myself to the fact that I would probably never smell again. I would get flashes of scent every once in a while. Like, a cigarette. Or a person with a strong cologne would walk by. Just long enough for me to recognize a scent, to look up, and not be able to follow it. 

Ironically, I was on an airplane and the person next to me had just sat down when I could smell his terrible halitosis. My god, it was like rotting flesh. I almost gagged. I looked around to see if anyone else was experiencing what I was experiencing, but to no avail. I thought it would go away briefly, like so many scents before. But no! This was present the entire 2.5 hour flight. 

I got off the plane and ran to find a coffee shop. I could smell the coffee and cinnamon before I even saw the Cinnabon. It was heavenly! 

Then I got on a tram to pick up my rental car. Stuffed in like sardines, I smelled the worst BO I think I’ve ever smelled. It was nauseating. Overwhelming. Again I looked around and no one seemed to care. I asked my fiancé after we got off the tram if he could smell what I was smelling. He said that he could, but it wasn’t that bad. “He probably forgot to brush his teeth today because he was in a rush to the airport.” Or “His deodorant probably started to wear off from the night before… it wasn’t that bad.” 

So far, I have kept my sense of smell. But certain smells are more amplified. I can’t even be near my fiancé until he brushes his teeth in the morning. I went out to dinner with my best friend the other day, and her breath was also awful. I fear I made a face when she tried to whisper something to me. What even is this?

Workers comp pays next to nothing and now they’re paying even less (a little over $400 a week because that’s apparently a livable wage). Since he’s been cleared for full duty, I finally felt a sense of relief.

**\*\*\*I want to make it clear that while I will be linking resources to blogs, books, and videos that I am NOT endorsing or validating the creator's or source(s) personality or reputation within the wider Hellenic community. Always do your own research. You can seek second opinions, but always remember to develop your own. Utilize critical thinking, Google, and the library. Always Google 'author's name + problematic' to see what comes up. Don't fall down the alt right pipeline; it's easier than you think it is and is very subtle. There are groups out there, like YSEE, who believe that only ethnic Greeks can/should be able to worship the ancient gods (and they're homophobic). DO YOUR RESEARCH!\*\*\***

In my first post, I spoke of Kharis. What is Kharis? It has many English translations: grace, charm, favor, etc. (Kharis is also the name of the goddess of beauty and grace). Being seen as humble, pious, and grateful was important in ancient Greece, and they would strive to accomplish these things through deed. Giving offerings was a way for ancient Greeks to create reciprocal relationships with their deities, known as Theoi. Contrary to popular belief, the ancient Greeks did not give offerings because they feared calamity would strike them down if they don't, nor did they see giving offerings as a bribe. The ancient Greeks did not snivel at the feet of their gods, or has irrational fear them. Tangible offerings--incense, libations, and food--were given as a way to give thanks for what the Theoi provided to them, and also to establish a reputation of goodwill. To give freely and without fear of punishment is the basis of Kharis.

**How do I develop kharis with Aphrodite?** It's really simple, and it involves is taking into account 1) how much time you have available, 2) the resources available to you, 3) any restrictions (roommates, pets, disapproving parents), 4) what you are willing to give, 5) and being honest with yourself about the time and energy you have on developing kharis with Aphrodite.

[Theoi.com](http://Theoi.com) 

Ritual cleanliness was strictly upheld in ancient Greece, and it frowned upon to go before the Theoi unclean. It was even said that the Theoi will not hear your prayers if you are unclean. This is where khernips comes in. It's a lustral water that used to wash the hands and face before prayer.

I will also put more general resources in the comment section. I just don't want the post to be too lengthy. (we shall about this lol)

**What should I give as offerings?** The sky's the limit honestly. You can give roses, jewelry, and perfume to Aphrodite. In antiquity, traditional offerings were incense (frankincense and myrrh, to be exact), [libations ](https://thebacchichuntress.tumblr.com/post/56355319027/sponde-and-khoe-the-practice-of-liquid-sacrifices)(olive oil, wine, water, honey), and food (especially barley and wheat).

[Template on how to give offerings to Hellenic gods ](https://www.hellenicgods.org/proper-care-of-offerings-to-the-gods-in-hellenismos)

Another traditional offerings is prayer, which is of course supplemented by tangible acts of offerings like the ones stated earlier. The Orphic and Homeric Hymns were written as offerings to the Theoi. You can use those, or write your own.

If writing your own, be sure to look up epithets for Aphrodite. Epithets are descriptive words or names that are used to highlight the role, aspect, or quality of a deity. One of Aphrodite's epithets is Richly Tressed, referring to her long, flowing beautiful hair.

**""What if I don't have a lot of money/space to give consistent votive offerings?""** The next best thing, IMO, be a quick libation (because it's easy and doesn't leave evidence after the liquid evaporates), plus a devotional act. Acts of service, like volunteer work, or devoting a routine (like a workout routine) to Aphrodite are good as well. Remember, you're not getting punished if you do something ""wrong"". The ancient Greeks believed that the gods didn't have to hear/reciprocate, but they were more likely to do so if right action and right offering were presented to the Theoi on a regular basis. Always remember that you are establishing reputation and goodwill with Aphrodite.

**""What if I'm sober/a minor can can't have alcohol?""** No worries! There are alternatives! You can offer tea, soda, coffee, sparkling cider/juices, or water. While not traditional, it provides safe and comfortable alternatives for those with restrictions/boundaries. Don't like/have wine? Use grape juice! Or strawberry lemonade. I've also given offerings of rose water and honey water (warm honey mixed into water).

One thing that I love collecting are devotionals. These are books with works by various authors that include essays, scholarly work, personal gnosis, poems, meditations, and prayers to a particular deity. I have [this particular one](https://tamedwild.com/collections/books-publications/products/aphrodite-8-week-devotional) to Aphrodite from Tamed Wild. There's also [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Blood-Roses-Devotional-Aphrodite-Venus/dp/1973810816). Google brings up more books in the search but I want to move on before I run out of space.

1kwwixl,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1kwwixl/aita_for_telling_my_boss_im_gonna_have_lots_of/,"AITA for telling my boss ""I'm gonna have lots of diggity""","Hey potato queeeen, and fellow gremlins, this is a long one, so buckle up!

CONTEXT: This happened in 2019, back when I (f/25) was an ESL teacher in a well-known language school. I was the youngest on staff, but I wasn’t green, I connected easily with students of all ages, worked hard, learned fast, and let’s just say... people liked me.  
Unfortunately, that was the problem.

Enter Karen. No, not just *a* Karen, *THE* Karen. Sixty-something, school owner. She hated me from day one, and trust me, I tried to like her, but it didn’t take long to see why *everyone* else walked on eggshells around her.

She was nasty. Like... racist, narcissistic, power-tripping nasty.

I once saw her ask my (then) fiancé (a Black man) to wait outside the school, while all the white partners were chilling in the lobby with air-conditioning and coffee. She treated my coworkers like dirt, and when students would stop by her office asking if I was around just to chat, she’d say things like,  
""You know, she’s not the most important person here."" or ""Do you only come to this school for her?""  
Because *how dare* students like their teacher, right?

Oh, right, I should mention: I was getting married that August. So starting in January, I asked for extra classes to save up. My sweet, glorious coordinator, aka my Fairy Godmother (FG), gave me as many hours as possible, without taking them from anyone else. Everyone was chill with it. Except Karen.

One day, Karen, knowing full well I was in earshot, scoffed:  
""I find it ridiculous to pay a kid almost 2K a month. She's not even a real adult.""  
FG, without missing a beat, went: ""Are YOU gonna teach those classes then, Karen?""

From then on, I became her personal stress ball. And the cruelty escalated.

At the time, I was going through a lot: IBS flare-ups (at the time, I didn't know), financial problems, family tension, and what I now know was my first anxiety attack. Food became my coping mechanism. I’d hide in the break room and eat snacks just to breathe.

She’d track me down. Yes, you read that right and I’m not being dramatic. She literally watched the school’s security cameras to see where I was, and then she’d come find me just to corner me and insult me. Like a demon summoned by the crinkle of a Doritos bag.

And every time, without fail, she'd weaponize the one thing she knew I was struggling with: my body.

She’d lean against the doorway with that smug, judgy face and say things like:

""Are you sure you’ll fit in that dress?""  
""Hope your fiancé still wants to marry you when he sees the size of you...""

Now, normally I’m witty. Petty with a PhD. But she had found my one raw nerve, my weight, and she kept jabbing it. Until one day in May, we were in the teachers’ room, everyone present. I was munching on something, and she proudly said:  
""You won’t fit in your wedding dress if you keep eating like that."" And finally, I snapped back with:  
""Sounds like a problem for my seamstress, not you."" The next day, I wore a t-shirt that said:  
""I’m only here for the food."" It wasn't out of character. I loved wearing these sarcastic tees, plus, excellent English exposure for my students.

Then June came. And FG got fired. No explanation. She was months away from retirement after 11 years there. Karen replaced her with her daughter, who was somehow worse. A carbon copy snitch who would literally spy on us during breaks and report back to mother dearest. That same week, FG called me:  
""She’s gonna fire you. She’s getting rid of everyone that doesn't bow down. Just be ready, she’ll wait for testing week to be over.""

Sure enough, I finish grading my finals and get the call to her office.  
I walk in, and it’s the Grinch twins: Karen and her evil spawn, grinning like they just ruined Christmas.  
The daughter says, ""Our love story has come to an end...""  
I blinked. ""What love story?""

Karen jumps in: ""Your services are no longer needed here. We wish you well... take this time to reflect. Learn to be a decent woman. Stop being sarcastic. Learn etiquette. Lose weight. Dress better. Maybe then your husband won’t regret marrying you.""

I kid you not, I'm pretty sure I saw the audacity jump out and dance around the room.

Oh honey, if you’re gonna fire me and insult me, at least hand me the mic first. I stood up, smiled, and said: ""You know what? You’re right. I will take this time to do something meaningful.""

They leaned in, smug. ""And what’s that?""

""I’m gonna have diggity. LOTS of it. All. The. Time.""

Nice, ey?

And I wasn’t done. I added: ""Well... somebody in this room needs to get some.""

And with that, I left.

Shaking? Yes.

Proud? You bet.

Worth it? Every damn second.

Oh, and guess what? She had to pay me for wrongful termination without proper notice, plus all my unused benefits. Thanks to that money, we paid for the wedding, furniture, and the honeymoon in full.

Some people say that I was out of line. But to me, it was long overdue, and it was for every single person she bullied.

Divorce is official as of this month! Exactly one year after I found out his infidelity. To say it’s been a ride is an understatement. Divorce was filed in January and he had still been relentless in his efforts for me to have dinner or coffee with him and I have said no each time. The house is still on the market and it’s been much more difficult to sell than I anticipated. I’m also dealing with conflicting emotions on selling the house and losing it. It feels like I’m taking a massive step back in life where I’m losing a low interest rate and coming to terms with possibly never owning a home again. But, I’m hopeful things will be better and better opportunities arise. 

Once the divorce was final a wave of anger went through me. From how long it took to the feeling of injustice surrounding everything. He continued to ask for us to work it out and to the point of trying to essentially “buy me” with vacations, cars, anything. It was such a strange experience and even now he still is trying to meet up. For what, I have no clue. He is still with the mistress as well and I fully expect him to be married by the end of the year. 

Overall, I think the real healing is starting now as I’ve been in survival mode for a year and I hope that my house sells soon so I can sever the final tie. Although, it doesn’t make me less sad about having to move. Hopefully I can get my number changed soon so he can’t contact me anymore once I move.

UTICA — St. Anthony and St. Agnes Church in Utica will host its annual festival in honor of patron St. Anthony of Padua — with a feast fit for a decorated Italian preacher.

**Celebration**The festival — which in addition to St. Anthony also pays homage to his Italian roots — will take place from 5 to 10 p.m. on Friday and Saturday, June 6-7, and from 8 a.m. to noon on Sunday, June 8 at the church at 422 Tilden Ave.

Festival-goers can enjoy a variety of entertainment throughout, including music by Anthony LaBarbera on Friday and Playing Again on Saturday. Traditional favorites, including sausage and pepper sandwiches and pizza fritta, will be available Friday and Saturday, and there will be beer, wine, water, coffee, and soda for sale, as well.

There will be a raffle with a top prize of $5,000 and novelties for sale throughout the weekend. On Sunday, there will be pizza fritta and assorted Italian pastries for sale.

**St. Anthony**St. Anthony of Padua was born in August 1195 and raised by a wealthy family in Lisbon, Portugal.

He was ordained to the priesthood as a teenager and shortly thereafter joined the Franciscans, whom it admired for their simple, evangelical lifestyle. In a bid to fulfill his new vocation, he went to Morocco where he fell seriously ill and set sail back for Portugal in hope of regaining his health. On the return voyage, the ship was pushed off course and landed in Sicily.

From Sicily, he made his way to Tuscany, where he was assigned to a convent of the order, but he was met with difficulty on account of his sickly appearance. He was finally assigned to a rural hermitage the friars had made in a nearby cave.

In 1222, St. Anthony earned his reputation as a preacher when he was pressed into giving a homily by the head of the hermitage to celebrate the visit of a group of Dominican friars. While Anthony objected to giving the homily, he was overruled, and Anthony’s sermon was hailed for both his great voice and manner but also for his eloquence and deep knowledge of scripture. He was also renowned for his love and attention to the poor and the sick.

He’s particularly lauded for his help in finding lost items and is a patron saint of various groups, including animals, the elderly, and travelers.

I still got acne before university but it has gotten significantly worse (cystic acne (?)) and I still have another three years left of completing my degrees.

I know what to do in regards to my life style but it’s definitely not a guarantee that I will keep up with healthy habits. I can try to meal prep and form study groups so I’m not pulling all nighters throughout the semesters but I will still be working multiple jobs, still be stressed out and be a bit sleep deprived. 

I really need suggestions on how to handle my skin with skin care and if there’s any treatments I should pursue. Thanks!!!

Reasons why my skin got ugly:

- I became a caffeine addict and I would drink energy drinks on the regular basis. Coffee didn’t work for me anymore and at one point I was drinking three or more a day. Since I’m on a summer break, I’m no longer drinking caffeine (at the moment…)

- TERRIBLE SLEEPING HABITS!!! I got two jobs since starting college and it got to the point where I was pulling consecutive all nighters (one time I didn’t sleep for three days and I felt like my heart was going to explode for weeks). I would come home late at night, study for an exam, and have to go to work at the morning. I feel like I never got a good nights rest since starting the university but during breaks, I spend most of my time sleeping.

- Bad diet. It’s easier to eat out or eat nothing at all for the day, come home and eat noodles + junk food… 

- STRESS. I also developed issues with my period since starting college. I use to be very consistent with my cycles but then eventually, I would not get my period for months or have a lot of spotting. Engineering and my jobs took so much time out of my days and with a really bad diet, it just affected my health and skin even more.


Current skin care routine:

Morning:
- Wash face with water
- Ginseng Essence Water / Beauty of Joseon
- Mamonde Centella Trouble Toner
- (inconsistently) Niacinimide 10% + Zinc 1% / The Ordinary
- Water fit sunscreen serum SPF50 / Centella

Night: 
- Vitamin C Cleansing Foam / Esfolio
- Cica Sleeping Mask / Laneige

1kwwad8,https://www.reddit.com/r/steelers/comments/1kwwad8/pittsburgh_city_guide_for_traveling_steelers_fans/,Pittsburgh City Guide for Traveling Steelers Fans,"So, you’re coming to Pittsburgh for a Steelers game and want to know what else you can do while you’re here?

First, if you fly, consider skipping the rental car. Yes, there’s plenty of parking around the city if you want a car but it’s a significant expense and you really won’t need it except to get to and from the airport. Take the Airport Flyer bus (28X) from the airport to the Wood St station. It’s $3 each way. Yinz can use the extra money you saved on the rental car to buy that sweet TJ Watt jersey. 

While you’re at the Wood St station take a look around. This is one of six subway stations that are free to ride between the North Shore and downtown. If you stay downtown the train will take you directly to the Steelers Football Stadium formerly known as Heinz Field (and back), FOR FREE. 

From Wood St you’re in the heart of what locals call DAHNTAHN or The Golden Triangle. When you’re looking for a hotel or BnB to book for a Steeler game, the two most convenient options are in the Golden Triangle or on the North Shore. Each has benefits. If you want to experience the city, downtown has many nice hotels and it’s safe to walk around day or night. Dahntahn has a lot to offer in the way of restaurants and entertainment. 

**Downtown Experiences**

If you want to expand your trip beyond the Steelers game, Pittsburgh has a cultural district just steps away from the Wood St station with the world class Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra at Heinz Hall, a beautifully restored Gilded Age Opera house in the Benedum Center for the Performing Arts (off Broadway, theater, and ballet), and the Harris and Byham Theaters.  It’s incredibly affordable to take in a show and have a nice dinner at any number of restaurants within a couple blocks of the area (I recommend ‘Meat and Potatoes’ or any of the restaurants up Penn Ave towards the Convention Center). 

You could also visit the Heinz History  Center to learn more about the City of Pittsburgh (which includes a very good exhibit about the Steelers). The Heinz History Center is six floors (!) and is located just past the Convention Center at the beginning of the Strip District off of Smallman and 13th Street. Look for the big red Heinz ketchup bottle!

**Strip District**

The Strip District is one of the historical shopping centers of Pittsburgh. ‘The Strip’ is comprised of old industrial age warehouses and storefronts located conveniently by the railroad tracks. Goods would flow into Pittsburgh from all over the world and if you wanted the freshest food and produce, this was the place to go.  Today, The Strip is a vibrant neighborhood that still maintains stores like Wholey’s and Penn Mac. There are restaurants, coffee shops, and bars to enjoy. The Strip has its own energy and there’s a bunch of Steelers swag to be had there.  

If you want a nice meal in The Strip, try Pamela’s (breakfast), Kaya (lunch), or Bar Marco (dinner).  There are a bunch of other places (Penn Ave Fish Co, Bella Notte, Iron Born, Primanti’s - it’s a long list) and a nice new Asian food hall at the terminal if that’s your thing.  

You could spend a lot of time in the Strip. 

**North Shore Sports Destinations**

You came here for a Steelers game so you’re going to spend a good amount of time at the Stadium Formerly Known As Heinz Field (yeah, it’s call Acrisure now) and in the parking lots around it if you tailgate. 

Tailgating is a thing here and there will be a lot of people doing it (especially if the weather is nice).  There are some tailgates that are ticketed events.  The Terrible Tailgate is one. They have a website with a schedule, the ticket generally gets you the food and some drinks. If you don’t want to pay to tailgate, that’s fine just walk around and make some new friends. Bring a smile and a bottle of something to share and you’ll be fed before the game. Steelers fans and people from Pittsburgh are the nicest people in the world and generally love to meet fans who are visiting for a game. This is the Steel City but mom, pop and Fred Rogers taught us manners. By the way, go down to the shore of the Allegheny and visit Mr. Rogers.  He still looks after our city.  

There are also a number of other monuments along the Allegheny River Trail just below North Shore Drive.  It’s a nice walk and you’ll be able to take in some nice city views (with bridges!). 

Before I take you away from the Steelers Stadium, there’s a newly founded Steelers Hall of Honor museum at the Stadium.  You need to book the tour in advance. It’s $18 for the one hour Steelers history tour. This and other stadium tours can be booked at the following URL:

https://fareharbor.com/embeds/book/heinzfield/items/?flow=12805&full-items=yes

PNC Ballpark (home of the Pittsburgh Pirates) is a hop, skip, and an immaculate reception away from Heinz Field.  You can get there by walking east along North Shore Drive or by taking the Allegheny River Trail. PNC Park is voted year after year the most beautiful ballpark in America and the Roberto Clemente bridge helps connect the North Side to downtown. It’s a great walk and one you can use to get to the game if you stay downtown. 

If you walk down North Shore Drive, be prepared to be tempted to visit every game day bar imaginable. This area will be PACKED with fans on game day. Those who aren’t tailgating will be here drinking and eating before the game.  Depending on the game schedule, there may be an NFL event at Stage AE too. 

**Other North Side Destinations**

The North Side of Pittsburgh was once its own city — Allegheny City.  The population of Allegheny City once rivaled that of Pittsburgh and was home to more concentrated wealth from 19th Century industrialists, retailers, and merchants than New York City. Allegheny City was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907 and that along with the urban flight enabled by the automobile changed the North Side forever.  We lost a lot of beautiful old homes and buildings but much was preserved. Today, you can take a leisurely stroll down tree lined streets with Victorian era homes and buildings in neighborhoods like Allegheny West, Manchester, the Mexican War Streets, and Deutschtown.  Some streets to visit: Ridge, Lincoln, Beech, and North Avenues; Monterey St, Resaca Pl, Palo Alto St, and Arch St; Cedar Ave and Ohio St. 

These North Side neighborhoods are wrapped around ‘The Common’ — our largest urban park space. This formally designed park is home to The National Aviary, The Children’s Museum, and Gus & YiaYia’s and is a perfect place to relax for a few hours or have a picnic.  You can also see the original Carnegie Hall here, stop at the Federal Galley for some refreshments, or walk by Allegheny General Hospital (filming location for the HBO Series “The Pitt”). 

There are some very nice restaurants on E. Ohio St if you want to take your special gal to a nice dinner; Fig and Ash, Siempre Algo, and EYV (Eat Your Vegetables). You can also stop by Prantl’s (one of the better bakeries around town) before 4pm for a tasty treat to take away and eat later. 

If you visit Allegheny West before the Steelers game, walk west down Lincoln Ave towards Allegheny Ave before turning to go to the football game. This is the same walk that Dan Rooney and his father, The Chief, would take to get to the game. The Rooney family has called this area home for generations, living here and walking to the games just like you and me. They handed out candy on Halloween, helped preserve and improve this area, and are partly responsible for what is still here. 

There are so many other attractions to experience and places to explore in Pittsburgh. You could plan a whole week around a visit; but a better idea might be to get a little taste and then come back again for some more.  Maybe we’ll see Yinz at the game or at the 2026 NFL Draft.

Walked back and when I got in, I set my coffee on the counter, turn around to go grab something, then my cat decided he was gunna have the fkn zoomies. Zoomed right up onto the counter knocking over and spilling my entire coffee 😭 I hadn't even taken my first sip yet cause i am the type to wait until I'm all set up and comfy (like the type of person who won't start eating her food until she's picked something to watch first). I wanna bawl my eyes out. I know it's not worth crying over, I could simply go get another coffee or just do without, but I can't help but feel frustration. I can't be mad at my kitty either cause he's just excited that I'm home. I'm a big coffee girl and that morning coffee is what gets me excited for the day. That one thing I get excited for. I'm not actually crying, but the little girl inside me was definitely stomping her feet and wanting to throw a whole ass tantrum. Ridiculous maybe, but again, I can't help the way I feel. 😭

Hi friends! So I’ve recently moved back to Cali after traveling around the southwest for a few years, and I have a curious question about how the Bay Area sources its wheat if anyone knows. 

Before I left, I had been struggling a bit with inflammation that was mainly affecting my hands, causing them to dry up, occasionally rip open, and often getting bumps that sometimes itched. Also headaches that I assumed were from how much coffee I drank and not hydrating enough. I went to a dermatologist and they said it was probably contact dermatitis and gave me some creams to try and recommended Vaseline as well. It helped a bit but mostly masked the issues. Anyways, I ended up developing lactose intolerance then about a year ago I came across a video talking about effects of gluten intolerance and one of them was inflammation, so I was curious and fully cut out gluten. Like magic, my hands were normal again! Sometimes I have a cheat day because it (probably) won’t kill me, I can tolerate a few days of mild irritation for a cheeseburger. 

Then I came out here, and after having a burger had no issues with my hands or joints at all. I got a mild headache, but nothing as bad as I use to. I’m wondering if the Bay Area sources its wheat or bread from places that have different processes than what’s typical of the US/SW? I’ve heard that people don’t have issue with European wheat because they do something different in the process, maybe something similar?",4,1748373612.0,bayarea,2,0.83,False

“I don’t love her anymore.”

I didn’t say anything. I didn’t move. I didn’t even breathe too loud.

I waited until his breathing slowed and deepened. And then I cried the quietest I’ve ever cried in my life.

It’s been two weeks since that night. He still brings me coffee in the morning. Still texts me “how’s your day?” Still kisses me on the forehead before bed. Like nothing changed.

But everything changed.

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to ask, because I’m afraid he’ll say it again, this time to my face.

So I’m pretending. Pretending I didn’t hear. Pretending I don’t know.

Are these two problems even related?,"My ex hacked my phone after we broke up, he changed my mom's contact to a bunch of weird things.  Ex. Spawn point, her full maiden name, fuck you (my name) then back to mom.  My phone also started acting weird in general, my Instagram would scroll on its own, press buttons itself, not let me scroll or press buttons, pictures would come out very odd and my data usage spiked. 

It stopped after I changed my email password so I assume he had my password or purposefully stopped after I changed it. He studies cyber security. I always thought that he was messing with my phone so I'd ask him to fix it, and then the problem would magically be fixed but obviously I didn't talk to him about it.  He continued to stalk my socials afterwards and is now blocked on everything.  This was about a year ago now.  

I was looking at all my blocked numbers and found these messages that I never sent.  It says its from AT&T, in the message it says it from VZW which I assume is Verizon wireless.  Neither of which is my phone service.  I NEVER sent these messages. The ""I'm sorry I understand"" was the last message my ex sent me before I blocked his number.  It then resends the message months later.  I then unblocked his number to tell him to stop stalking my socials and reblocked him.  There is no messages from AT&T when I did that. The ""which state are you living?"" Was the last text message from a wrong number I blocked not too long ago.  It was obviously a scam, they offered to buy me coffee for inconveniencing me.  I've blocked many other numbers on this phone before and their messages are not in there.  I am just SO confused.  The dates are also off.  I blocked my ex on Jul 10th not 12th and I blocked that other number on April 2nd not 3rd.  

Is there any way I can prove it's him doing this stuff?? I was never threatened so I couldn't imagine police would do much of anything.  I'm planning on factory resetting my phone and I have already changed passwords multiple times.

Well to catch you all up I had been NACHOING for a while besides the absolute essentials to maintain my own sanity. Some weekends I forgot my personal rule and tried to parent but only when SO was basically a sleep zombie he gave up too. About a month ago I asked for support when asking Dylan to do things. This lasted a couple of days. 

Anyway after a really bad weekend a couple of weeks ago where I was constantly repeating myself and getting either attitude or Dylan going over my head about stuff I had had enough (again)! This time I actually told SO everything, I told him Dylan’s behaviour was out of control, he has no respect for me and doesn’t give a damn what I say…instead of the usual “he’s only 8 years old,” response I actually got through to SO. Mainly because I said the problem isn’t Dylan…it’s him. SO took it on the chin and I actually explained bit by bit what I wanted from him and what he actually needs to do as a parent and not me. 

Well it’s school holidays and we’ve had Dylan for nearly two weeks. One morning last week SO gets up to use the bathroom VERY early, like sun only just coming up early. Dylan’s alarm is set for a sensible time and he is allowed on his ipad to watch kids YouTube until we both wake up and have had enough coffee to face the day. However, when SO goes to help Dylan back into his room the iPad is on and he’s been watching it! I was fast asleep at this point but when I wake up something is off and the guys are acting quiet. 

Well SO FINALLY followed through on a consequence! Win! The iPad was taken away, he stuck to his guns all day of not letting Dylan on any screens at all and the IPad’s settings were changed so it won’t access anything until the set time. Dylan moped all day, but SO stuck to his guns. Dylan now has to come into our room and ask for the iPad at a sensible until he can be trusted again and SO hasn’t given up yet. 

And guess what?? Dylan has been much better behaved this week knowing his Dad will actually follow through after 3 warnings. So what he sulks for a few minutes. SO and myself are now supporting each other, I am being defended when Dylan is giving attitude or not doing as he asked. I am so happy I finally got through! 

I’m counting this as a win, we’re finally a team and Dylan learnt a harsh but much needed lesson in rules and consequences. ",4,1748373450.0,stepparents,3,0.75,False

Olivia’s POV

 

“Wake up, Olivia,” Mom’s voice echoed in my sleep.

 

I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. “Five more minutes, Mom.”

 

“We don’t have any more minutes,” she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. “Get up now, or we’ll be late.”

 

“Mom,” I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.

 

“Don’t tell me you still want to sleep,” she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. “Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?” Mother snapped angrily at me.

 

I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. “I’m up, I’m up,” I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.

 

“Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,” Mother announced, and my frown deepened. “Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?”

 

“Don’t start,” Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. “Get moving. There’s no time for complaining.”

 

I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.

 

The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.

 

Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We’d grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

 

That was before everything fell apart.

 

My father was one of the pack’s strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.

 

But everything changed the night of the setup.

 

I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.

 

Anita was there that night. She hadn’t comforted me, hadn’t spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.

 

Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta’s daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.

 

What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha’s sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.

 

I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid’s uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.

 

“Olivia,” my mother called, “I know this isn’t easy, but… we’ve already lost so much. Don’t give them a reason to take more.”

 

I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn’t understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.

 

“Here,” my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. “She asked for this.”

 

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.

 

“I’ll find my mate, and all this will be over,” I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

 

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn’t ending.

 

Reaching Anita’s room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I’d fallen, and how far she’d risen.

 

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.

 

“Come in,” Anita’s voice called.

 

I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. “Your coffee,” I said quietly, stepping inside the room.

 

The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man’s voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.

 

There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.

 

I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.

 

“Wait,” Anita said sharply.

 

I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.

 

She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.

 

My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.

 

She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.

 

She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. “What is this?” she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.

 

“It’s the coffee you requested,” I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.

 

“This?” she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. “You call this coffee?”

 

My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. “It was made in the way you like it,” I said.

 

Anita’s eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.

 

“Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I’ll dump it on your face.”

 

Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.

 

I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?

 

“I’m sorry if the coffee wasn’t to your liking,” I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. “I’ll remake it.”

 

Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. “Don’t bother,” she said, waving a dismissive hand. “Just try to be less useless next time.”

 

Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn’t even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.

 

“You’re dismissed,” he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.

 

I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.

 

As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.

 

Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox’s personal guard. “There you are. Lennox calls for you,”

 

I frowned. “Did he say why?” I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.

 

Bala shrugged. “Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.”

 

A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox’s room.

 

When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.

 

# Chapter 2: Accused

 

Olivia’s POV

 

Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.

 

The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.

 

But that was before.

 

Before everything fell apart.

 

Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.

 

“Who cleaned my room yesterday?” Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.

 

I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. “I did.”

 

Lennox’s expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.

 

“Then tell me, Omega,” he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, “where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?”

 

I froze, my heart racing as Lennox’s words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.

 

“I… I didn’t see any necklace,” I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.

 

Lennox’s eyes narrowed. “Don’t lie to me, Omega,” he growled, his tone laced with anger. “The necklace didn’t just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.”

 

“I’m not lying!” I protested, panic creeping into my voice. “I cleaned the room, but I didn’t take anything. I swear!”

 

He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. “You expect me to believe that?” he snapped. “You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.”

 

His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.

 

“I didn’t take it,” I repeated, my voice steadier this time. “You can search me if you don’t believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.”

 

Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.

 

I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers’ pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.

 

Minutes later Lennox stopped searching, his breathing heavy as he stood amidst the chaos he had created. The necklace was nowhere to be found. He turned to me, his eyes blazing with frustration.

 

“I can’t find it, Olivia. It’s gone. That was a gift I got for Anita, a gift I wanted to give her on her eighteenth birthday. Do you know how much that cost me?” he asked in anger.

 

I swallowed hard in fear but stood my ground. “I did not take it…”

 

“Lies!” he angrily cut me off.

 

Lennox exhaled sharply, rubbing his temple. “This doesn’t make sense,” he muttered. “You cleaned my room. You were the last one here.” His gaze hardened. “Don’t lie to me, Olivia. Where is it?”

 

When I remained silent, his eyes blazed.

 

“You are a thief, just like your father! A thief!” he cursed, and I pressed my lips together, holding myself back from answering him.

 

Lennox’s words hit me like a blow to the chest. A thief. Just like my father. It didn’t matter how hard I worked, how much I tried to keep my head down and stay out of trouble, this pack would always see me as the daughter of a disgraced warrior.

 

“Only two people came into this room yesterday,” Lennox continued, his voice low and sharp, like the growl of his wolf ready to pounce. “You and Anita. So, tell me, Olivia, who else could have taken it?”

 

I stiffened at his words, the pieces clicking together in my mind. Anita. Of course. She had been in his room yesterday. I remembered seeing her standing by his dresser, pretending to admire a framed photograph.

 

I knew Anita better than anyone else. She was cunning, always looking for ways to get what she wanted. I remembered the time she stole a pack warrior’s silver bracelet, only to cry her way out of trouble. Or the time she framed a servant for breaking the Alpha’s Favorite vase, earning the poor girl a week in the dungeons.

 

And now, she had done it again. But this time, I was her scapegoat.

 

Who would dare enter Lennox’s room and steal something so valuable?

 

No one.

 

No one except Anita.

 

But the words were heavy on my tongue. I couldn’t say it. Not to Lennox. If I accused Anita, I’d only make things worse for myself. No one would believe me. Lennox would defend her, just like everyone else did.

 

“I didn’t take it,” I said again.

 

Lennox let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head. “You think I’m stupid, don’t you?”

 

I bit back a retort, my wolf growling in frustration. I wanted to scream the truth at him, to tell him that Anita was far from the innocent, perfect girl he thought she was. But I couldn’t. Not without proof. And even if I had proof, it wouldn’t matter. Anita had the triplets wrapped around her finger.

 

“You know what, Olivia?” Lennox sneered, taking another step toward me. “I’m done wasting my time with you. If that necklace doesn’t turn up by the end of the day, I’ll make sure you and your mother are punished. Severely.”

 

His words sent a chill down my spine, but I stood my ground, meeting his gaze. “I didn’t take it,” I repeated one last time, my voice steady despite the fear coursing through me.

 

Lennox glared at me for a moment longer before turning away, his shoulders tense with rage. “I give you until the end of today to return that necklace. Get out,” he growled.

 

I didn’t need to be told twice. I turned and left the room, my heart pounding as I walked down the hallway. Once I was far enough away, I leaned against the wall, my legs trembling beneath me.

 

Anita. She had to be the one who took the necklace. I knew it in my gut. But how could I prove it without putting myself in even more danger? The triplets wouldn’t believe me, and Anita would just deny it, twisting the situation to make me look like the villain.

 

“Here you are, Olivia,” a guard said as he walked over to me. “Levi is looking for you, and he doesn’t seem happy.”

 

The guard’s announcement made my heart sink in fear.

 

“Why? What happened?” I asked, terrified.

 

Joshua, the guard, shook his head. “I don’t know, Olivia, but he is really furious and demanding for you.”

I, 23M, have been dealing with throwing up blood every so often (1-2 weeks on average) for about 9 months now. Started back in September, and at the time I was working a high-stress non-physical sales position. Throwing up (bloody or otherwise) often seemed to just be triggered by stress.

Fast forward to about January, I’m in a new job working a manual labor position but with much less stress; I go out with a friend and end up throwing up a ton of blood in the car after dinner. Figured I might’ve overate or had some undercooked meat (KBBQ dinner), saw a doctor but couldn’t afford to pay for ER out of pocket cause broke college grad who barely had savings.

Fast forward to now, it’s been the same sort of throwing up either blood or blood and bile or coffee grounds-like matter, often with last night’s dinner. I’ve been keeping my portion sizes in check because I’m way overweight (6’5” 445lb) and January was a come-to-God moment, so I don’t think it’s related to overeating.


Any ideas on what might be causing it, and what to look out for? Current theories on my end are 1) spicy food 2) high carbonation in drinks irritating stomach 3) esophageal scarring/tearing?

If it matters at all, I don’t smoke, but I am throwing a caffeine addiction that I had in college, and I used to do high-intensity contact sports when I was younger.",1,1748373448.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Thank you to everybody that came an checked up on me. 

One lady was a nurse. East-asain, spoke Cantoneese by default and Mandarin after hearing me speak on the phone. If I remember correctly, she was late-30s to mid-40s, glasses, shoulder length hair. If anybody knows someone matching my description, please ask if it was them, and on the off-chance it is them, I would like to properly express my gratitude and return the makeshift sling. 

And to the police that were on their way to a coffee break, sorry for interrupting (because of my break).

And to those in ambulance 3057, I wish you an infinite supply of loli-pops and enternal dental care (they offered me their ambulance teddy bear and candy). 

How nurse delt with ""crash"" (from what I remember)
As I fell, my left shoulder made contact with the ground first and hardest, followed by a slight bonk of the head, where I maintained consciousness through the full process. 

When the nurse introduced herself as a nurse and asked where I was affected. She also checked for brain function with the flashlight thing and asked for how my head felt. 

Once she isolated the injury to my shoulder, she checked for nerve damage by asking me to wiggle my fingers, and making an ok sign. She also checked my blood flow, gently turning up my palm to see the finger pads, and feeling if any were cold. 

Working her way up, she then checking for passive elbow extension and flexion, then asking me to do it actively (I think?). 

When she asked me to move my shoulder and I didn't, she had her parner to get some towels and made a makeshift sling.

This includes any nukes that may be present in console-exclusive content (which we know by this point can be modded into the PC versions easily).

This was a monotonous 4-day effort of manual testing. This used tons of ITEMS, COFFEE, and beat up a lot of BIG STRONG TREES and YE OLD SPROUTS... but the payoff is that these strategies maximize damage in a minimized number of turns >!(just don't ask about TULIP nuking...)!<, and will assume that you try these nukes at the beginning of battle: full HEART, full JUICE, no EMOTIONS or STAT bonuses, and 3 ENERGY.

This guide was made with the intention to maximize damage wherever possible\*, so you'll find that multiple nukes use the CONTRACT (from defeating >!MR. JAWSUM!< on TWO DAYS LEFT), and some use SKILLS that can only be found on ONE DAY LEFT. Since these point are rather late in the game, I tried to provide alternatives so that you can come closer to these ideal scenarios without having the game basically complete. Some nukes don't have alternatives when the nuke is based on a SKILL that is acquired on ONE DAY LEFT, so an alternative is less useful than just getting what you need.

\*I did not account for some particular bonuses:

* Eating SNO-CONES: If you really wanna maximize, everyone should eat one of these at the start of battle. Without cheating in FOOD/ITEMS or CLAMS, this is very wasteful and not worth pursuing.
* RELEASE ENERGY: When the party does RELEASE ENERGY, everyone gets a STAT boost for the remainder of the battle. Getting this boost is a bit wasteful turn-wise when you could just perform the nuke instead. Over the long run, no boss lasts long enough to where this is valuable >!(except maybe BASIL RUSH)!<.
* Any bonuses gained from eating MUSH, MARI'S COOKIE, or watering BASIL'S FLOWERS.

As the door closed behind Jenny, the echo lingered in the hallway like a quiet exhale. I stood there for a moment, letting the silence settle. The hum of the refrigerator was the only sound now, and with no more tasks immediately at hand, I finally turned inward.

That’s when it hit me—I had classes today. I had assignments, deadlines, things I hadn’t touched in days. Maybe weeks.

I glanced at the time. I could still make it if I rushed.

My backpack was in the hallway, right where I’d left it two nights ago. I knelt beside it, unzipped the main pouch, and frowned. Crumpled worksheets, forgotten reading materials, half-written notes. Just holding the folder felt foreign, like it belonged to someone else.

Mrs. Thompson’s words echoed in my mind—*“Structure is obedience. Without order, service falls apart.”*

I’d learned to serve others with care. But I hadn’t served myself.

I sat on the floor and began sorting through my schoolwork. Math assignments, sociology readings, project outlines—I made piles, just like I did for Jenny earlier. One for what was urgent, one for what could wait, one for what needed to be rewritten completely.

The same way I’d been patient and methodical with her, I applied to myself. It felt strange, and honestly a little uncomfortable. I wasn’t used to prioritizing myself anymore. But this—this was necessary.

I quickly changed into clean clothes, grabbed a granola bar, and slung the backpack over my shoulder. As I walked out the door, I reminded myself: *Obedience doesn’t mean neglect. Discipline starts at home.*

I would go to class today—not because I wanted to, but because I needed to. Because being useful didn’t mean disappearing. Jenny might rely on me, but if I fell apart, I’d be no use to her at all.

It was time to catch up.

Time to remember that serving others didn’t mean forgetting myself entirely.

By the time I made it back to Jenny’s house, my legs ached and my brain felt like it had been wrung out. I’d spent the day trying to catch up—half-listening in lectures, scribbling down notes as if I could make up for weeks of drifting. It wasn’t perfect, but it felt like a start.

The sun was already beginning to set when I stepped through the front door.

“Jenny?” I called softly.

I didn’t hear a response at first, just the low buzz of the TV in the living room. I kicked off my shoes, set my bag down quietly, and walked in.

She was curled up on the couch, her arms crossed, face tight with annoyance. As soon as she saw me, her eyes narrowed.

“Seriously?”

I blinked. “What?”

“You were supposed to be here,” she said sharply. “The kitchen’s a mess. There’s laundry that’s been sitting in the washer since this morning, and Mom told me to leave a list for you. You didn’t even look at it.”

“I—” I stepped forward, trying to explain. “I went to school today. I had class. I’ve been behind for days and—”

Jenny stood up suddenly, arms tense. “And that’s more important than what we need from you here?”

The words hit hard. I opened my mouth, but she kept going.

“I mean, what did you think this was? A part-time hobby? You’re either here for us or you’re not.”

I swallowed hard. “I just thought—”

“No,” she cut in. “Don’t think. Just do. That’s what Mom always says, right?”

I glanced toward the kitchen, the dishes stacked in the sink, the neglected to-do list taped to the fridge. Guilt pressed down on me like a weight.

“I’m sorry,” I said quietly. “I didn’t mean to let things pile up. I just—”

“You let yourself come first,” she said, almost like it was a personal betrayal. “That’s not how this works.”

The silence after her words was sharp.

“I’ll clean up now,” I said quickly. “I’ll do everything. And tomorrow I’ll figure out a way to manage both, I swear.”

Jenny didn’t respond immediately. She just sat back down, picking up the remote again.

“Start with the kitchen,” she said coldly. “Then we’ll see.”

I moved without hesitation, slipping into the familiar rhythm of wiping, scrubbing, rinsing—trying to erase the guilt with soap and hot water.

As I cleaned, I reminded myself: *This is where I belong. I just have to do better. Be better. For her. For Mrs. Thompson. For the house.*

Even if it meant putting everything else second.

By the time I finished cleaning the kitchen, my arms were sore and my back ached, but the place sparkled. I stood quietly in the middle of the room for a moment, catching my breath, hoping it was enough to ease the tension.

Jenny was still on the couch when I returned, her eyes fixed on her phone. But when she glanced up and saw me—sweaty, tired, and still trying—something in her expression shifted.

She didn’t smile, exactly, but her tone had softened. “You really cleaned all of it?”

I nodded. “Yeah. Everything. I even took care of the laundry.”

She set her phone down slowly and sighed. “I didn’t mean to go off on you. I was just stressed. Mom gets mad at me too when stuff’s not done.”

I hesitated. “It’s okay. You were right. I’ve been letting school distract me.”

She looked at me for a moment, then shook her head. “You shouldn’t feel bad about going to class. But… I don’t know. You helping here, it really matters. It keeps things from falling apart.”

I sat down on the floor by the coffee table, knees pulled up, grateful for the shift in mood. “I’ll find a way to balance both. I just need time to figure it out.”

We sat in silence for a few minutes. Then the front door opened.

Mrs. Thompson walked in, keys in hand, her heels clicking sharply against the tile. Her eyes landed on the living room first, then the kitchen, then finally me.

Her expression didn’t soften.

“I got a call from Jenny earlier,” she said flatly. “Told me you weren’t here all day.”

I stood up quickly. “I—I went to class. I know I should have—”

“You should have communicated,” she said firmly. “You left without saying a word. That’s not how this works.”

Jenny stood as well, stepping between us slightly. “He came back and cleaned everything, Mom. He felt bad. I might’ve overreacted.”

Mrs. Thompson raised an eyebrow. “You did. And so did he.”

She set her bag down on the table and crossed her arms. “This arrangement can’t be random anymore. If you’re serious about staying useful to this household, we need structure. A schedule. Expectations.”

I swallowed. “Okay. That makes sense.”

“You want to go to school? Fine. But don’t expect Jenny or me to wait around while the house goes to ruin. You’ll have a daily list. You’ll check in before you leave and after you get back. Understood?”

“Yes, ma’am,” I said quietly.

Jenny gave me a small look of sympathy, but Mrs. Thompson was all business.

“We’ll go over the plan tomorrow. Tonight, finish up the rest of the laundry and vacuum the hallway. Then you’re free to go.”

“Yes, ma’am,” I said again, already moving.

Jenny lingered near the door as I passed, her voice barely a whisper. “Thanks for trying.”

I gave her a faint smile. “Thanks for noticing.”

As I got back to work, I realized something: this wasn’t just about chores anymore. It was about proving I belonged—by their rules, on their terms.

And if that meant structure, I’d learn to thrive in it.

The next morning, Mrs. Thompson had already left by the time he stepped into the kitchen. But the list was there—precise, taped to the fridge, and longer than yesterday’s.

>

He stared at it in silence.

Jenny strolled in a few minutes later, dressed for school but moving slow, sipping a smoothie with her earbuds half in.

She gave him a small smile when she saw him standing there. “Oh hey, you're up.”

He didn’t say anything.

She walked over, pulled the list off the fridge, glanced at it, and gave a dramatic sigh. “Ugh. She seriously gave you this many things? She’s insane.”

Then she turned to him with a softer tone. “But hey, don’t worry. You’re good at this stuff. You always figure it out.”

He looked unsure. “I’ve got classes this afternoon…”

Jenny walked over, close, her voice still sweet. “And you’ll make it, you always do. You’ve just gotta get started a little earlier today, that’s all.”

She gently placed the list back in his hand. “I know it sucks, but… it really helps. You helping around here keeps things peaceful.”

He hesitated, eyes on the paper.

Jenny touched his arm lightly and smiled. “Come on. You’re the only one mom actually listens to when the house is spotless. It calms her down. If you leave stuff half done, she’ll lose it—and you don’t want that.”

Her tone was understanding. Comforting, even. But the expectation was clear: get everything done.

“I know it’s a lot,” she added, stepping back. “But you’re part of this now, right?”

She gave him a cheerful little pat on the back, picked up her bag, and headed for the door.

“Love you for this!” she called sweetly as she left.

The door closed. The kitchen fell silent.

He turned back to the list.

Of course it was all still his responsibility. Jenny hadn’t lifted a finger. But somehow, with her smiling voice and kind tone, he almost felt like she’d done him a favor.",3,1748373116.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False

Between the head segments, the car body is equipped with a workshop, a storage room, a wet room and a social room with a workstation. The workshop contains all the usual spare parts and tools for the maintenance and repair of overhead line systems. The workshop area also contains the wet room with washing facilities and a toilet. The toilet is equipped with a bioreactor, which cleans the wastewater and only releases hot water into the environment - the solid waste container only needs to be emptied at a repair shop for scheduled maintenance.

Next is the video workstation, equipped with a monitor for monitoring the overhead wire position via cameras, a fax machine, and a control panel for panning the camera and roof spotlight. Opposite the video workstation is a small kitchenette with a microwave, kettle, coffee maker, cupboards, a drinking water container, and a sink.

Past the hydraulics for the freely pivoting aerial work platform, you reach the lounge with a radio, seating, a table and drying cabinets for clothes. The second driver's cab is connected to this and separated by a door.

[There are two aerial work platforms](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubarbeitsb%C3%BChne) on the roof , one with a free-swinging mechanism (Palfinger PA 360) and one that can only be moved horizontally (Palfinger PA 90). Both can be coupled to increase the usable space. A rope pusher, a [current collector](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stromabnehmer) with adjustable [contact pressure](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anpresskraft) , video surveillance and various lighting fixtures have also been installed on the roof. The freely-swinging aerial work platform PA 360 has a work basket with a base area of ​​1500 × 1600 mm and can reach 18.5 m above and around 10 m below [the top of the rails](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schienenoberkante) . The aerial work platform PA 90 has dimensions of 3500 × 1600 mm, reaches 6 m above the top of the rails and can be rotated 90 degrees to either side.

* Aerial work platform extended upwards
*  
* Aerial work platform extended to track height

Both platforms can be secured with a counter-track barrier to prevent them from accidentally turning into the clear space of the siding.

# Drive and brakes

The [railcars](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triebwagen) are equipped with two MAN D 2842 LE 602 [diesel engines](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieselmotor) for mainline service. These engines generate 588 kilowatts (800 hp) at 2100 rpm from a displacement of 21.93 liters; an upgraded version is also used as boat engines.

For work travel, an additional MAN D 0826LOH 19 engine is installed. This one delivers 130 kW (177 hp) from a 6.87-liter displacement. To reduce exhaust emissions for personnel while working in tunnels, it also features a [particulate filter](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dieselru%C3%9Fpartikelfilter) .

There's also an onboard power generator that ensures the power supply for the entire electrical system when the diesel engine is switched off. It's fully encapsulated and, thanks to its own battery and 24-volt alternator, virtually independent of the 24-volt vehicle power system, allowing it to be started even when the main batteries are discharged.

All Class 711.1 railcars are fitted with [multi-release disc brakes](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheibenbremse) which act on two brake discs per wheelset and normally operate as [electro-pneumatic brakes . A ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elektropneumatische_Bremse)[retarder](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retarder) (flow brake) is also fitted to each gearbox , and there is also a [magnetic track brake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetschienenbremse) for rapid, emergency or forced braking . During normal operation, all braking systems are controlled via the accelerator/brake lever and a brake control unit. This means that the retarders are generally activated first, and the additional pneumatic brake is only applied when their braking force has decreased. For “HL emergency operation” there is also a driver’s brake valve on each driver’s console, although the handle is not normally attached. During emergency operation, only the [compressed air disc brake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Druckluftbremse_(Eisenbahn)) is active without EP control.

The railcars have two GPH 200 [bogies . These are largely equivalent to the ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drehgestell)[GP 200 bogies](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drehgestell_Bauart_G%C3%B6rlitz#Bauart_GP200) of passenger coaches, but they have been adapted to the characteristics of a diesel railcar and are additionally equipped with a spring lock. To prevent the bogie from compressing excessively on one side when the work platforms are swung out sideways, thus increasing the risk of tipping, the bogie's primary suspension is deactivated by locking cylinders. When locked, work travel at up to 10 km/h is still possible.

# Electrical equipment

\[ [Edit](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&veaction=edit&section=6) | [Edit source](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&action=edit&section=6) \]

The vehicles are equipped with complex electrical equipment that monitors and executes virtually all vehicle functions via a [programmable logic controller](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speicherprogrammierbare_Steuerung) (PLC). This largely eliminates operating errors and reliably maintains safety-relevant settings. For example, the PLC prevents travel faster than 10 km/h with the spring lock engaged. If a roof-mounted device such as a work platform or rope pusher is not in the transport position, it is not possible to switch to line travel. ""Single-engine operation"" is also possible, with the choice between diesel engine 1 or 2, or the engine with the fewest operating hours is used. The exterior lighting ( [triple headlights](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreilicht-Spitzensignal) and work area lighting) is also controlled by the PLC.

The train must be equipped with a Siemens I 60R [point-to-point train control system](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punktf%C3%B6rmige_Zugbeeinflussung) with software version PZB 90 V2.01 (V1.6 was installed at the factory). There are two time/time [safety control circuits](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicherheitsfahrschaltung) , one software-based for work runs and one hardware-based for line runs. A [GSM-R](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM-R) train radio is also used for communication with connected stations. An [EBuLa](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBuLa) device was also present, which ran on the [Windows 95](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_95) operating system . These EBuLa devices were removed. In January 2014, new EBuLa devices were retrofitted with [Windows XP](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Windows_XP) .

In March 2022, a contract for the installation of [ETCS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System) on-board units (according to [SRS 3.6.0](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Train_Control_System#3.6.0) ) in Class 711.1 railcars was awarded to [Stadler Rail](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadler_Rail) and communicated in January 2023. The contract includes a prototype ( *First of Class* ) and two series conversions. It includes an option for 15 additional vehicles. [^(\[ 2 \]) ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-2)[^(\[ 3 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-ei-2023-06-39-3) The fitting of one vehicle (First of Class) began in January 2024. [^(\[ 4 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-ei-2024-03-40-4) The contract value for the First of Class conversion is in the order of five million euros, that for the series conversion is approximately 300,000 euros per vehicle. [^(\[ 3 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-ei-2023-06-39-3)

On February 16, 2012, railcar 711 120 caught fire in [Bienenbüttel](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bienenb%C3%BCttel) on the [Lehrte–Hamburg-Harburg railway line](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahnstrecke_Lehrte%E2%80%93Hamburg-Harburg) . The cause was a leak in a hydraulic fan motor, which released an oil aerosol that subsequently ignited. The vehicle was parked and later removed from service. [^(\[ 5 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:1-5)

# Railcar 711 112

\[ [Edit](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&veaction=edit&section=9) | [Edit source](https://de.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=DB-Baureihe_711.1&action=edit&section=9) \]

The railcar 711 112 caught fire on July 9, 2020 and rolled driverless for approximately 22 kilometers along the [Black Forest Railway](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzwaldbahn_(Baden)) line . [^(\[ 6 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:0-6) The cause of the fire was a leak in the hydraulic system, similar to the above case, which led to the release of a hydraulic oil aerosol. The heat from the turbocharger ignited the mixture underneath the vehicle. The fire initially went unnoticed. As a result of the fire, a neighboring cable duct was damaged and an [emergency brake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zwangsbremsung) was triggered between the [Hausach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausach) and [Haslach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haslach_im_Kinzigtal) stations . This also caused a power failure to the control panel. The [driver](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triebfahrzeugf%C3%BChrer) and a train attendant who was also present left the vehicle to investigate. The driver had previously operated the electrically controlled [spring-loaded brake](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federspeicherbremse) , but did not notice that it could not be applied due to the power failure. As a result of the fire, a brake hose burst, causing the vehicle to start moving again on the downhill stretch. Attempts by the driver to brake failed due to existing damage to the braking system. Since the vehicle only had a single brake circuit, the entire braking system was ineffective. The driver jumped out at low speed to safety. During the subsequent driverless journey over a distance of more than 21 kilometers, the vehicle set fire to several embankments. [^(\[ 6 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:0-6)

The dispatcher in charge attempted to stop the vehicle at Haslach station by issuing a stop signal and applying the normally associated [PZB emergency brake. Because the braking system was inoperative and the power supply to the PZB computer had failed, the signal had no effect. Two further attempts to stop the vehicle using ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/PZB_90)[wheel chocks](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemmschuh) in [Steinach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steinach_(Ortenaukreis)) and [Biberach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biberach_(Baden)) also failed. Police vehicles accompanied the wrong-way journey on the adjacent streets and secured several level crossings. Finally, the railcar was brought to a standstill by a deliberate derailment at a [track barrier](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gleissperre) in [Gengenbach](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gengenbach) , where it was extinguished by the fire service. The vehicle was a total loss. [^(\[ 6 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:0-6)

The incident occurred due to a combination of various technical factors. The [Federal Railway Authority](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisenbahn-Bundesamt) therefore ordered several technical modifications to minimize the risk. This included revising the air brake system to prevent a complete loss of braking effect in the event of a single failure. [^(\[ 6 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-:0-6)

DB Netz subsequently ordered an inspection of all Class 711.1 vehicles, focusing on the hydraulic systems, and replaced all hydraulic motors as a precautionary measure by the beginning of 2023. [^(\[ 7 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-tonline20240627-7)

On January 20, 2023, there was also an accident involving a Class 711.1 railcar. This time, the railcar 711 119 was involved near [Freilassing . The burning vehicle started moving again after fire-fighting efforts began and rolled, burning, for six kilometers until it was diverted onto a ](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freilassing)[dead-end track](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stumpfgleis) shortly before the state border and stopped by a buffer stop. [^(\[ 8 \])](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DB-Baureihe_711.1#cite_note-8)

1kwvoec,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1kwvoec/hi_dad_im_sorry_i_bothered/,Hi dad. I'm sorry I bothered.,"Hi dad, 

I got help fixing a flat tire on my bike this weekend, after I spend an hour dragging the bike home with a flat. My neighbour helped me out, he was patient and calm. I tried to talk myself out of it for hours but eventually asked him to if I could get a lift to the store to get a new tire and tube. He just got his jacket and walked out to his car, waiting for me to get in. Me assuming he would get angry at me. The silence nagging into my patience, when does the switch flip? He followed me in to the store, made sure I got the right tire size, drove me home and got out the toolbox while fixing it in silence. I stood there and watched, awkwardly trying to hold the bike in place as he made sure the tire was straight. Maybe now when I am standing there useless while he does everything, maybe now he'll tell me how useless I am? Like you used to do.

I made him coffee as a thank you, tried to be funny and crack jokes. Trying to diffuse a tension that was never there. He was relaxed, I was waiting for anger. Like yours, if the coffee was to hot, or to cold. 

But he was just calm. I couldn't take the tension in my bones and asked him if he was angry at me, or annoyed, or wished I hadn't bothered him. Asking how I could make it up to him, how I shouldn't be taking up his time, that I just should have fixed it myself. And then I apologized for asking him that.

I was met with a furrowed brow. Warm arms pulling me into a hug. Me tensed, him remaining. ""It's just a tire"".

I thought about myself at five years old, hiding in my room from you. Hoping I could stay of the way, didn't want my precense to annoy you. Didn't want to hear how I should I have known better than to assume I was worth your time.

And then I thought about this weekend, calm and kindness. 

""It’s just a tire""

Anyways.
I am sorry to bother.
Like I always am.
Like I always will be.

But the worry feels like home. And the kindness feels like danger.",1,1748372512.0,letters,2,1.0,False
1kwvodw,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwvodw,"Houston Coffee - Blendin, Tenfold, Catalina/Amaya","Had the chance to stop by some great coffee shops on my recent trip to Houston, most notably Blendin, the owner of which won the US Brewers Cup last year. They gained a lot of buzz for winning with a decaf from Los Nogales, which they regularly have available on their coffee bar. I also got to try Tenfold and Catalina Coffee. What else do y'all recommend visiting on my next visit to Houston?

Blendin - My brother brought me a sample of their Magnum Sidra and Los Nogales Decaf last year, which I enjoyed, especially the Sidra since it had an orange-tangerine vibe I find a bit uncommon. The decaf was definitely special since the processing wasn't too funky and it seemed the ethyl acetate processing worked well with the inherent characteristics of the bean. I treated myself on my first visit to their cafe this week by getting a Panama Gesha from El Burro. I enjoyed it and it was quite floral, but it didn't wow me as much as past geshas I've tried from Adaura, Gesha Village in Ethiopia, or Takesi in Bolivia. They brew on the pour steady, and they have a ton of beans available for purchase, and lots of variety on the higher end of them. Left with a mosto-innoculated washed yellow bourbon.

Tenfold - I got a washed Burundi pourover here, and the vibe was immaculate, with lots of outdoor seating. I liked their glassware as it was unique and interesting from a tactile/ sensory perspective. They had an entirely separate coffee bar dedicated to classes which was cool

Catalina - My brother buys espresso beans from their sister company Amaya coffee roasters, and I got a free iced coffee with his order. I enjoyed it but didn't check it's origin. Quite bright and I could tell it was flash brewed",3,1748372511.0,pourover,5,1.0,False

[BrightMeds.com](http://brightmeds.com/) is currently offering a year of labs free to new TRT signups and is pleased to provide the summary below.  
  
**1. Energy’s in the Toilet?**

  
Low T can leave you zonked, even after coffee. If you’re napping more than your toddler, T below 300 ng/dL might be why. Bloodwork tells all.  
  
**2. Libido’s Gone AWOL** 

  
Can’t get it up or just not feeling it? Low T hits 1 in 4 guys over 40, tanking sex drive and performance. A quick test could spark the comeback.  
  
**3. Moody as Hell**  

  
Irritable, anxious, or straight-up depressed? T regulates mood. If you’re snapping at everyone, low levels (under 350 ng/dL) might be messing with your head.  
  
**4. Muscles Shrinking, Gut Growing**  

  
Struggling to pack on muscle or losing gains despite crushing it at the gym? Low T reduces muscle mass and spikes fat storage, especially that beer belly.  
  
**5. Bones Getting Brittle**  

  
Testosterone keeps bones dense. Low T increases fracture risk—yep, even in your 40s. A test can flag if you’re at risk before you snap something.  
  
**6. Brain Fog’s Real**  

  
Forgetting names or zoning out in meetings? Low T messes with focus and memory. Studies show guys with T under 400 ng/dL struggle cognitively.  
  
**7. Sleep’s a Nightmare**  

  
Tossing, turning, or waking up exhausted? Low T can disrupt sleep patterns, and poor sleep tanks T even more. Break the cycle with a blood test.  
  
**8. Heart Health Matters** 

  
Balanced T supports cardio health, but low levels (below 300 ng/dL) are linked to higher heart disease risk. Know your numbers to stay in the game.  
  
**9. You’re Not “Just Aging”** 

  
Don’t buy the “it’s just 40” excuse. Symptoms like fatigue or ED might be treatable with TRT if T’s low. Many over 40 qualify, find out if you do.  
  
**10. It’s Easy to Check!**

it's a bit like with spotify playlists, there's a lot of user slop to wade through but some very good ones, and some official ones, although some user ones are actually better than the official...

(You don't need to have a login to letterboxd, you can just search and then copy the url)

A good place to start searching seems to be just put in studios or blu ray publishers, or magazine names or film festivals.   And there's really specific lists people have made...

(I'd suggest seeing what order you think the list should be in before you import - some will be better in a-z , some in order of popularity, some in recent first.  then you can set this preference for that list)

I think he is the most attractive person I've ever met, 6 foot, Tattoos, incredible fit and strong. He is literally the definition of tall, dark, and handsome. And he has the personality of those morally grey men in all romance books. So I can only imagine what other women think when they see him. 

I am also a confident person, I am skinny, young, and moderately attractive. I work out and have a successful career. So it's not an insecure thing. If anything i'm overly conceded about my looks at times. 

He also treats me extremely well, he makes my coffee every morning and delivers it to me in bed, compliments me everyday, buys me flowers and other random gifts, he dotes on me any chance he can get, etc. He makes me feel like his world revolves around me.

  
With all of this going on I still can't but worry that he is going to cheat on me. I don't want to think like this about him as he has done nothing to deserve it. I have been to therapy for 3 years for anxiety so I know tactics to combat anxiety but nothing is working for me. This thought just floods my brain and I can't get it out.

I sat at the corner of the Meeting Cafe for two hours, facing the direction of the counter. A young girl in a sky-blue apron was busy brewing various drinks.

She was about 5'2"" tall, weighing no more than 90 pounds, with fair skin and a slender figure. She had a smile on her face, and her thick, black hair was tied up in a high ponytail. Her eyes were infectious when she smiled.

""Ma'am, would you like a refill?"" She walked over and asked me with a radiant smile.

""Black coffee,"" I replied, flashing a polite smile, my voice calm.

Soon, the girl brought me another cup of bitter black coffee. Instead of leaving immediately, she hesitated for a moment and said, ""Ma'am, you've already had two cups of black coffee. It may be refreshing, but excessive consumption is harmful. Maybe... you can come back next time?""

She was kind-hearted and outgoing. Her voice was clear and pleasant like wind chimes.

I glanced at the black coffee on the table, then picked up my bag and stood up. ""Alright, let's settle the bill.""

The girl was happy that I took her advice. She immediately went to settle the bill and said, ""Ma'am, your total today is $87.""

After paying, I quickly left the cafe.

""Madam."" Tim saw me coming out and nodded respectfully, opening the car door for me.

""Let's go home,"" I said to him with a faint smile.

The car started smoothly, and I closed my eyes in the backseat, images of the young girl from the coffee shop still lingering in my mind, recalling her youthful and radiant face.

Was it her? The girl who, a year later, made Charlie Bennett break ties with his family, pay a great price, and divorce me.

I never expected that the first thing I would do after being reborn was to find out where she works now and observe her like a voyeur.

I was too curious. What kind of girl could take away the man I had loved for ten years?

In my past life, I had never even met her in person. I only found out her name and saw a few pictures. Charlie protected her like a precious treasure, and I was utterly defeated without even facing my opponent.

Young, beautiful, pure, kind, outgoing... all these wonderful adjectives perfectly described that girl.

Her only vulnerability was the lack of a prestigious family background, a disparity in status compared to Charlie.

Suddenly, Tim spoke, ""Madam, today is your wedding anniversary with Mr. Bennett.""

I opened my eyes, momentarily confused. Let me calculate, it has been five years since I married Charlie. Every year on our wedding anniversary, I would be busy all day preparing a candlelit dinner and a wedding gift.

This year, I was 27 years old, and Charlie was 29.

""I know."" I rubbed my slightly uncomfortable temples. ""No need to remind me.""

Perhaps Tim sensed that I was different from previous years, which is why he reminded me.

But why was it always me who put in the effort? Why did I have to love that man? I had pondered this question before my death in my past life. For Charlie, I ended up losing everything in the end.

A miserable outcome.

I was lost in thought when the car had already stopped at the doorstep of mine and Charlie's house- the luxurious and grand mansion our parents gave us as a wedding gift. It occupied over a thousand square meters, a precious piece of land.

Surprisingly, Charlie's car was also parked at the doorstep today. He had returned.

My emotions were complex. As someone who had died once, when faced with the culprit after being reborn, what kind of expression should I put on?

I thought I would hate Charlie. For a woman, he had driven his wife of five years to a dead end. He had also dealt with my once incredibly doting father-in-law and mother-in-law, causing my family to collapse under his control.

However, upon seeing him again, I discovered that I didn't have such intense hatred. Instead, I felt a sense of relief.

In my previous life, Charlie had given me a chance. He proposed a peaceful divorce and compensation in the form of partial shares in the Bennett Group, enough for me to squander for a lifetime. But I refused. Even after ten years, I hadn't received a trace of his affection. Yet, with another woman, he became infatuated within a year, antagonizing everyone.

So, I tried every means possible to win him back, step by step, leading to our irreparable confrontation. A life and death struggle.

Those events had not yet occurred. Instead of harboring hatred, I wanted to change the bitter ending that I had brought upon myself.

""Why are you standing there?"" Charlie sat in the living room, casually crossing his long legs. The smoke on his fingertips had already burned out, and he skillfully put it into the ashtray. Then, he looked up at me, his gaze as indifferent as ever.

On our wedding day, Charlie had openly told us that it was merely a business arrangement between us, that we were just long-term roommates, and he had no feelings of love for me.

""Oh, nothing. I just didn't expect you to be home,"" I bent down to change into Hermès etoupe slippers. They had a simple design and a dignified color, but other than being comfortable to wear, they didn't appear particularly attractive.

I remembered the girl in the coffee shop. She was wearing a blue apron with a small red flower emblem. None of the others had it, only her.

In comparison, all my clothes were expensive but monotonous, exhibiting an unchanging simplicity and dullness.

Suddenly, I felt disgust toward these slippers. I threw them aside and walked barefoot into the living room.

Seeing me approaching him barefoot, a slight frown appeared on Charlie's forehead, and a hint of surprise flashed in his eyes. ""Aren't you wearing shoes?""

""Yeah, I don't feel like wearing them,"" I replied calmly, sitting across from him.

""It's quite strange. What triggered that?"" Charlie suddenly laughed. He used a rare, light tone to ask me that question.

I thought, ""Triggered by the person you will truly come to like in the future.""

I lowered my head to look at my own fair feet, which appeared somewhat dry due to excessive thinness.

Lauren Williams was different. Although she was slender, her skin was firm and elastic, unlike me, who was nothing but skin and bones.

Five years of lonely marriage had caused numerous problems in my body, and I had lost all interest in food. I was becoming thinner and resembling a witch more and more with each passing day.

""Charlie,"" I spoke up.

""Yeah?"" Charlie was engrossed in his phone, not even lifting his head.

No response.

He wore a black shirt and trousers. His slender figure and perfect proportions gave him a striking handsomeness. Combined with his smooth, refined, and deep-set facial features, he could be considered as someone that all women would like.

I looked away from my feet and stared at the man in front of me. My voice was a little husky as I said, ""Let's get divorced.""

As soon as the words fell, I heard Charlie's contemptuous laughter.

He threw his phone onto the sofa and looked at me with a familiar and indifferent gaze, asking, ""Rosalie Harrison, what game are you playing now?""

""I'm serious."" I sat up straight, meeting his oppressive gaze head-on. ""It's been five years, and you're never going to fall in love with me anyway. Let's release each other.""

Next month, there will be a large-scale business seminar in New York, and Charlie will be there. He'll meet Lauren, who will be working as a part-time hostess. It'll be love at first sight, and he'll stop at nothing to possess her.

I don't want to play the role of their legendary love story's cannon fodder anymore.

I have done what I wanted, what I could do, and what I should do in the previous life. I have already achieved the final result. In this life, I won't turn myself into a joke or drag the Harrison family into the abyss.

I decided to leave before Charlie and Lauren met to take the first step on their bumpy path of love.

Perhaps due to the seriousness in my eyes, Charlie's expression instantly turned gloomy and ugly. He has always had a bad temper, and if someone offended him, he would never show mercy.

""So I've become someone's toy now?"" He laughed, but there was a chill in his eyes. ""Five years ago, it was you who insisted on marrying me, and now, it's you who wants a divorce. Rosalie, are you playing with me?""

Five years ago, the relationship between the Bennett family and the Harrison family was perfect. It was a win-win situation for their business development and personal connections.

But with Charlie's personality, he could never be so obedient. The turning point was when the Bennett family's grandfather fell seriously ill and forced him to marry me.

It was a humiliation for Charlie, but fortunately, he didn't have anyone he truly loved. Moreover, he was in the process of taking over the family business and needed a wife who could help him develop his career, so he settled for me for five years.

I sighed with some sadness. ""Do you still want to continue this marriage, which is famous but empty?""

""Famous but empty?"" Charlie seemed to be pondering these four words carefully. Then he raised an eyebrow and sarcastically asked, ""Oh, do you feel empty?""

""No, I just..."" I carefully considered my words.

But Charlie had already stood up and come over to my side. He leaned down, resting his hands on both sides of the sofa, enclosing me within his embrace. His voice was somewhat tempting. ""If you feel lonely, why don't you talk to me?""

Charlie liked to smoke, and he always had a faint fragrance mixed with the scent of tobacco.

Of course, he never embraced me. I used to secretly smell his coat. At this moment, that complex and fascinating scent enveloped me. Ideally, I should have been excited and flushed with reddened cheeks, but in reality, I felt suppressed.

I was ready to leave him, so even a hint of closeness felt ominous.

""It's not about this!"" I tried to push him away.

""Is that so?"" Charlie snorted.

# The Long-awaited Reunion

Charlie straightened up. He was never interested in me to begin with. The ambiguous teasing just now was meant to embarrass me. He won't lose his control.

I am a nearly thirty-year-old married virgin, emanating resentment rather than a charming fragrance.

""Rosalie, I know today is our fifth wedding anniversary, but I have no interest in all this. If you're trying to divorce me over this, I suggest you stop bothering."" Charlie stood in front of me, his voice turning cold.

""I haven't celebrated the anniversary for years. I didn't start bothering you for this."" I also stood up and looked at Charlie. ""Think about it, now my usefulness is almost exhausted. Compared to me, you need this freedom even more, don't you?""

With that, I headed upstairs to the bedroom without looking back, not wanting to say any more.

There was a rough closing of the door downstairs, followed by the sound of a car engine outside the window. I knew Charlie had left, but this time, I felt calm inside.

My phone rang. It was my friend Jane Donald calling.

""Rose, come out and play! Let's go to Song Garden!"" Jane's loud voice instantly dispelled my gloom. She is around the same age as me but has always been single.

After marriage, I rarely went out to play. Jane invited me ten times, and I could refuse nine times, but she was still very persistent.

""Sure!"" I readily agreed. There was a long silence on the other end of the phone.

""Today is your wedding anniversary with Charlie. Are you sure you want to go out?"" Jane's tone was full of doubt and astonishment.

I had used the excuse of wedding anniversary to refuse Jane for four consecutive years.

""Well, an anniversary is not a memorable day. I'll be right there."" I confidently answered Jane and hung up the phone.

Opening my closet, I saw a sea of black, white, and gray. Even blue was a rarely seen color. Behind every luxury brand, there are various wonderful designs, and I spent a lot of money buying the dullest style among them.

After ten minutes of pondering, I finally selected a less dreary strapless black dress. It had a silky texture, a deep V neckline that nearly reached my navel, and an elastic waist that accentuated my slender waist. My clean, white arms remained uncovered.

I remember buying this dress specifically to seduce Charlie. He didn't even come home for a month.

The only thing that dissatisfies me now is that my chest is too flat, which feels slightly mismatched with the allure of this dress.

I should eat more in the future.

I comforted myself. After changing clothes and applying makeup, I headed to the garage and drove a red Porsche straight to Song Garden.

During college, Jane, Tina Carter, Yolanda Davis, and I were known as the four talented women in the Music Department. Everyone thought that after graduation, the four of us would achieve great things.

However, I got married early, Jane became a regular at nightclubs, and Tina landed a vice-manager position at her family's company. Only Yolanda remained true to her music. She participated in music competitions everywhere and vowed to become a singer.

""You finally made it!"" Jane assumed a leadership pose, swiftly jumping off her high stool to excitedly shake my hand. The other two nodded in agreement, as I had almost disappeared from the social scene after getting married.

After a few drinks, Tina sighed, ""Rose, if you didn't come out this time, I would have thought that the event I attended five years ago was your funeral and not your wedding.""

""Strange! No candlelit dinner at home tonight?"" Jane curiously asked, prying her eyes open. ""Come on, let me see if that scumbag Charlie is still ignoring you. Have you been crying?""

""Don't pull off my false eyelashes, okay?"" I swatted away Jane's hand.",1,1748372125.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

## Key Features analysis

Cat cafes aren't just about the cats; the food itself must be high-quality and visually appealing to justify the visit. These are key factors that elevate a cat cafe's food offerings from ordinary to extraordinary.

**Aesthetic Presentation:** A core element of ""cute"" cat cafe food is its visual appearance. This encompasses the use of cat-themed molds,vibrant colors,and artful arrangements. Think paw-print cookies, cat-shaped macarons, and latte art featuring adorable feline faces. The food must be Instagram-worthy,encouraging patrons to share their experiences and promote the business organically.

The aesthetics of cat cafe food go beyond simple novelty shapes. It often includes careful attention to color palettes, textures, and overall plating. For example, a cat-shaped cake might feature pastel-colored frosting, edible glitter, and delicately placed chocolate shavings to resemble fur.The goal is to create a visual masterpiece that delights the eye before the first bite.

**Flavor Profile Diversity:** While presentation is essential, taste remains paramount.The best cat cafes offer a diverse range of flavors to cater to different palates.Sweet treats like cakes, cookies, and parfaits are staples, but savory options such as sandwiches, salads, and even miniature pizzas are gaining popularity. The flavors should complement each other and provide a well-rounded dining experience.

A successful cat cafe menu balances familiar favorites with unique and innovative flavor combinations. A classic vanilla cupcake might be elevated with a salted caramel filling, while a simple ham and cheese sandwich could be transformed with artisanal bread and gourmet cheeses. This ensures that there's something for everyone to enjoy, irrespective of their dietary preferences or taste sensitivities.

**High-Quality Ingredients:** Using fresh, high-quality ingredients is crucial for creating tasty and memorable cat cafe food. This not only enhances the flavor of the dishes but also demonstrates a commitment to customer satisfaction. sourcing ingredients from local farms and suppliers can further elevate the dining experience and support the community.

The commitment to high-quality ingredients should extend to all aspects of the menu, from the coffee beans used for lattes to the flour used for baking. This might involve using organic produce, free-range eggs, and sustainably sourced seafood. By prioritizing ingredients, cat cafes can create food that is both delicious and ethically responsible.**Themed Menu Integration:** The best cat cafes seamlessly integrate the feline theme into their food menus. This can be achieved through clever naming conventions, where dishes are named after resident cats or cat-related puns. Additionally, incorporating ingredients that cats enjoy (or at least symbolically represent feline favorites) can enhance the thematic experience.

A well-themed menu tells a story and immerses customers in the cat cafe experience. ""Whiskers' Waffles,"" ""Mittens' macarons,"" or ""Garfield's Grilled Cheese"" are examples of playful names that can add a touch of whimsy to the dining experience. Additionally, incorporating catnip (in a way safe for human consumption, of course!), salmon, or tuna flavors can reinforce the theme.

We’re based in the Netherlands and are in the market for an automatic coffee machine with a manual steam wand, and we’d really appreciate your input.

We’ve had good experiences with De’Longhi in the past, so we’ve mainly been looking at their lineup. We’re currently considering three models, but we’re a bit torn: 

•	Authentica: We really like the design, and it ticks most of our boxes. However, we’re a bit concerned that it might be an older model, and replacement parts could be harder to find in the long run.

•	Dinamica: Seems like a solid all-around choice, but we’re not fans of the design.

•	Rivelia: The most expensive of the three. Possibly the best option? But we’re unsure if we’d actually use the app features it offers.

Our must-haves: 

•	Budget: around 1000€ •	Ability to make two lungos at the same time 

•	High build and coffee quality

 •	A manual steam wand (not automatic milk frothing)

We’d love to hear your thoughts on these models. If there are other machines (from De’Longhi or other brands) you think we should be looking at, we’re all ears!

Thanks so much in advance for your help ☕🙂",1,1748372067.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

1kwve1q,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwve1q,Virgin Atlantic Upper Class vs Delta One to LHR,"I did a head to head recently between Korean Air Prestige and Delta One and got some good feedback, so I thought I'd share some photos and thoughts for Virgin vs Delta.

If I had to summarize, Virgin Atlantic feels like the premium airline that Delta says it is.

Food: Virgin Atlantic wins hands down, both for having straight up better food options, my outbound from LHR had like a dozen pre-order selections. The drink selection is simply better as well. The alcohol selection is strictly better, they have a ton of cocktails, mocktails, teas, and coffee options.

Seat: On the A330neo, Delta and Virgin have the identical overall seat, except, Virgin's is just better in that it has bluetooth pairing w/ the IFE, wireless charging, etc.

Service: Virgin Atlantic FAs are lovely, I don't know if it's because they have UK accents, but they just feel more professional and proper. Just the way they word things, like asking how they can help or offer you something. Also Virgin Atlantic offers PJs on the overnight flights too. I've had great D1 FAs before, but I feel like the average Delta FA just doesn't hold up compared to Virgin.

Lounge: once again these are basically the same, but Virgin does have some nice Clubhouses at airports that don't have as nice of SkyClubs or D1 lounges like IAD or SFO. Even the LAX Clubhouse is worth checking out in my opinion.

This isn't meant to be a Delta bashing review, Delta isn't bad by any means. But if Delta really wants to be a ""so-called premium"" airline, they could really just use some of that secret sauce they're cooking at Virgin Atlantic. Given that Delta owns half of Virgin Atlantic, I don't see why that wouldn't be possible",19,1748371842.0,delta,25,0.89,False

I'm using a fresh roast 540 with nothing near a novel roast profile. My neighbor is in a the coffee industry professionally and had the same note and I can't figure it out for the life of me. Same grind settings for our normal drip procedures and it's finishing almost a minute early and for espresso it's running well but volumetrically fast with settings that should choke the machine. No complaints about flavor or output quality, maybe so extra acidity.

Am I not getting all the chaff off, underdeveloping, too long dry phase in a fluid bed roaster? I'm stumped.

You start a new job at a sleek, cutting-edge biotech company.  
The kind of place that makes you think you’ve *finally made it*—modern building, glass walls, endless coffee, and a salary that almost makes you forget the pressure.

But within weeks, the cracks start to show.  
Your projects are mysteriously reassigned.  
Your login credentials stop working—without explanation.  
Coworkers give you polite smiles, but when you turn your back, the whispers start.  
You try to speak up, but suddenly, **you’re the problem**.  
Management gaslights you. HR says there’s no record of your concerns.

And then…  
Your phone glitches at night—calls from unknown numbers.  
You catch glimpses of documents on your screen that vanish before you can read them.  
Security cameras follow your every move, but when you ask about it, they say **you’re imagining things**.

It’s part of a **larger machine**—an invisible system of **power, deception, and control**.

They want you to **obey**.  
To accept the rules without question.  
To be grateful for the paycheck while they decide who climbs, who falls, and who vanishes completely.

They use every tool in their arsenal to crush you—**workplace sabotage, gaslighting, digital manipulation, social isolation**—until you either fall in line or become a ghost in the system.

But Elara doesn’t fall in line.  
She starts to pull the threads.  
And that’s when she discovers the **Shadow Mandate**:  
A hidden, sprawling conspiracy that controls far more than her job.  
It decides who gets hired, who gets fired, who gets harassed into submission—and who never makes it home.

I get home and it is almost 4 in the morning. I nearly trip over my dad. He is passed out again on the floor. I help him stagger up and put him on the couch. He looks like a log just sleeping there. I wish there were something I could do to help him. But I remember what happened last time I suggested rehab.

Once I clean up the mess, he made all over our apartment I haul my ass to my room to grab some sleep. When my head reaches the pillow, I feel the weight of what is going to happen tomorrow. The fact I am no longer going to be living here. Well at least not until next summer. The thought of everything that has brought me to this moment, and I start to feel my head reel and I cannot let sleep overcome me.

I have been working on this for as long as I can remember. I graduated high school early with honors and a 4.0 GPA. I just wish my mom could have been there so that she could be here tomorrow to see what I am doing with my life. I know Dad tries to be the best parent he can be, but he has been broken since my mom passed.

I look over at the clock and it says 4:30 am. I am still wide awake. I roll over and close my eyes. My mind drifts to the day my life got weird. The day that has been burnt into my body. The day I became something more than a girl.

It was my 16th birthday. My first one without my mother. My dad was drunk when I got home from school. I had made dinner and baked myself a cake just like my mother did every year before that. It was her recipe. I just wanted some normalcy. I was missing my mother on my birthday and wanted to feel close to her. But dear old Dad would not take it he got angry. He got violent and the result is he hit me.

I mean I get it she was the love of your life you miss her, but I am your child don’t take it out on me, I remember thinking. I miss her too. He is not a violent man but sometimes he does lose his temper. And the result of that conflict was me running out of the house that night.

I stop myself I don’t want to replay that night again. It is what it is I am not just a girl anymore I am something else something I never should have been. I am cursed and now have this affliction I can never share with anyone—a creature in hiding.

I must have drifted off to sleep. Because the loud sound of my alarm clock is beeping telling me it is time to get up. I haul my ass out of bed today is the day. College is my new adventure. I can finally help people and maybe even find a cure for my current affliction. Well, I know that won't be happening for a while but maybe in a couple of years.

I clean up get showered and dressed. I go to the kitchen and start to make breakfast for my dad and myself. I bring the coffee to him. “Dad it is me I have your coffee. I need you to get up. You have work in a few hours, and I have to catch the plane remember I am leaving today.”

He doesn’t really move. “Dad I need you to get up Ian is going to be here any second and you need to go to work today, and I want to give you a hug goodbye. I won’t be seeing you for a while.” He gowns and I hear the front door open. “Ember hey do I smell bacon?” “Oh, hey Ian. I made eggs and bacon you're more than welcome to eat. I can fix you a plate. Can you see if you can get my dad up, he had a late night?”

“doesn't he always.” I hear Ian mumble under his breath. Part of my affliction I can hear everything. Well at least think it is related. I couldn’t hear like this before the night I ran out. It is like I have supersonic hearing and smell. At first, it was hard because I would get headaches all the time. There was definitely an adjustment period.

I do my best to not listen to Ian's comments about my dad. I know he tries to be understanding but he does not get it. It isn't simple for my dad he cannot just stop drinking that is why it is called an addiction after all. But I'm just glad he helped me get my dad a job.

If it weren't for him my dad would have never been able to hold down a job in the first place. So even though a lot of time he talks crap about my dad he at least is helping keep him employed. “Ember he is not getting up I guess he is going to be taking another sick day?”

“I am sorry Ian. I am trying here....my uncle will be moving in this afternoon to help make sure he is doing okay. He even sounded hopeful the last time we talked he said he could get him to an AA meeting which makes me happy.” he comes over and wraps his arms around my waist from behind. “That is a good baby. But since he is not going to wake up maybe we should go back to your room and treat ourselves to some enjoyment you know. I could call in late and spend the morning under the sheets.... mhhh what do you think.”

Oh god. I think to myself. Is he serious? Does he not remember that I have a plane to catch? Ever since I gave him my virginity that seems to be the only thing he wants to do or think about. I mean I get it you have needs, at least that is what he says, but I have shit to do. It is not like I get anything out of it anyway, but what is a few minutes of unpleasantness when he is helpful in other areas?

“Ian I would love to....” I lie through my teeth. “But.... I have my plane to catch and as you know I have to take a bus to get there, so I am on a tight schedule today I am sorry.” He lets out a sigh I know he is mad. “Ember how about this, we can go to your room and fool around and then I will drive you to the airport. This will save you some time and I can come back and clean up the kitchen too. After all, I won't be able to see you for three weeks till I come out to visit.”

I know there is no getting out of this and as much as having sex with my boyfriend should make me happy, it doesn’t. But I don’t want to fight over this and knowing him it won't last long. On the upside, I will not have to ride the grimy city bus to the airport with my luggage. Also, he said he would come back and clean up the kitchen so that is a plus. “Alright fine.

# Chapter 2

The Uber pulls up to the university and with my two bags of luggage, I get out of the vehicle. It is pouring rain outside and now I am wishing I had an umbrella. I drag myself over to the main dorms to get settled in and get all my info I need.

When I get up to the room my roommate is already there. She is tall and beautiful and blonde. “Hi, I'm Ember.” I say with a smile. “Hey, I am Melanie. Most people call me Mel. I can tell you are not from around here so where are you from?”

I can tell right off the bat she is a social butterfly. Which is fine I have never been one to be overly social. It is not because I am a weird loner or something. I have just had to help take care of my dad since my mom passed and before that my mom was sick for a long time doesn’t leave a lot of time to make or keep friends.

But this is a new place, and my only obligation is to myself, I am going to push myself to form friendships and enjoy my youth as many call it. I won't enjoy it too many studies are important but so is having some kind of life. “I am from the Carolinas,” I responded to Melanie as I put down my bags on what looked to be my side of the room.

“Oh, so you're from the east coast no wonder you are drenched you have no idea what the weather holds for you out here. Well, it is mostly cold wet, and rainy. But that is okay feel free to borrow as many of my raincoats and rain boots as you want. Wait what show size are you?”

I must admit I did not expect to have such a friendly bubbly roommate, but I am happy I do. I reply, “size 7” Her face breaks into an enormous smile. And with a squeal, she says, “That is my size I knew this was going to be a good day my horoscope said it would be. Here take these my dad got them for me, but I already have this pair.”

I look down to find red rain boots in my size. I smile thank her and start to unpack. Once done I look over and Mel is reading the latest issue of Cosmopolitan. “Hey, Ember want to go with me to a party? I know you don’t know anyone since you just moved across the country, but I am from here and I know lots of people it will be fun. Cute boys, dancing, DJ booze... you know the fun stuff.”

I must admit the closest thing to a party I have ever come to is my late-night job at the local bar and restaurant. But I am here to not only hit the books but experience life so why not? “Sure, Mel. I will go but I got a guy back home so no boys for me.” Mel smiles and responds, “Yay!!! As for your guy what he doesn’t know won't hurt him.” She laughs I just smile and shake my head.

I take a shower and throw on some skinny Jeans and a black V-neck T-shirt. I let my red curls fall down my back. I put on my black Converse and look in the mirror. I look good my butt is a perfect shape my breasts are full and perky. My skin is flawless not a single blemish with some freckles. My green eyes are bright, and my hair is glossy and always curls are bouncy.

It must have been around the same time I got my aliment that night. It did not just ruin me, but it made me the most perfect self I could be. Not that I wasn’t pretty it was just I was plain. It is like everything that I ever thought was unappealing went away. My muscles toned perfectly, my hair got super shiny, my cheekbones got more pronounced, and my eyes got greener if that is possible. My lips got fuller as did my breast and ass.

In addition to these good traits that I like, I have some bad ones that I cannot control. Luckily it only happens once a month and I seem to be able to have a hold on making sure no one is around when that happens. I finish checking out my appearance and walk out of the bathroom.

“You know you have to be one of the prettiest women I have ever seen. I do not know how you can pull off looking so hot in regular clothes.” Mel says. I smile in appreciation. “You are quite pretty yourself; you know that right?” Mel laughs “of course I know. But I could never pull of simple the way you do.” She starts to put on her body spray, and I am trying my hardest not to make a face.

It smells good but to me, it is strong because of my heightened smell. Mel looks at me. “Are you ready to go my friend Javier is driving.” I nod and she exits the room. I follow her to the elevator and out to the car. She hops in the front seat, and I get in the back. “Javier this is Ember she is from the East Coast so I thought we would show her how us Westerners party.”

He looks back and I can tell he is nice looking. He is tan has a buzz cut and I can see he has nice, toned arms. He has some tattoos that may freak people out but not me. Nothing since the night in the woods on my 16th birthday freaks me out. Nothing hurts me that is. I have superhuman strength and every time I get a scrape it closes and heals almost instantly. One of the many perks of this curse I have.

We get to the party, and it seems to be in full swing despite the fact it is early. I'm sure as the night progresses it will become an even bigger party than it already is. I trail behind Mel and Javier. Mel turns around “So this is Ashly Moscow's party. She is loaded and doesn’t do much in the ways of anything. She doesn’t even attend college. She went to high school with Javier and me. She has a trust fund, and this is her housewarming party.

We walk into a huge mansion. It is beautiful I take in the scene. Lots of young people. Around my age, I would guess maybe some older maybe some younger. But then I sense it. Something is off I feel the hair on my arms standing up and I feel agitated. Almost like there is a threat nearby. I feel my body heat up and my skin is on fire all a sudden. I know what is coming.

“Hey Mel, I'm going to go have a look around but if you don’t see me just know I will meet you back at our dorm room. I can always call an Uber so go have fun and I will too.” I say trying to sound confident. I smile and walk off. I probably sound like a freak showing up to a party to just abandon her. But I must get out of here or someone will get hurt.",1,1748371535.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1kwv8j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kwv8j3/aitah_for_being_angry_with_my_friend_for_dropping/,AITAH for being angry with my friend for dropping out of the move?,"Hi all. Long post ahead, so apologies. A little background before I get started: I (19F) have a friend group, all male (18M, 19M, 19M) who I know from high school. I’m currently living with “Jason” (fake name), and we’ve been roommates for about a year now. “Cole” and “Leo” still live with their parents. Since December of 2024, our friend group has been planning on moving to another state together for cost of living reasons. We’ve meticulously planned this move, and we’ve set a deadline for August 2025. We collectively have 14k saved up for the move, and we’re on track to hit 20k before August. An essential detail is that Cole has about 4k in savings, but is only willing to contribute 3k, as he has repeatedly expressed concern for not being able to support himself. The rest of us do not have personal savings, and we are contributing wholly to this move. Another important bit of information is that all of us have had poor home lives, which was a major contributing factor to how close we are as a group.

One of our friends, Cole, has obviously been the most reluctant to move. Initially, he wouldn’t really contribute to conversations about the move, and he’d just listen to us talk. However, within the last couple of months, he’s suddenly switched around. All of a sudden, he has issues with the most trivial things; he refuses to have wooden cooking utensils, he has a requirement for what spices we have in the house, the porch is too dirty on the house we’re looking at, etc. While Jason and Leo were clearly getting annoyed, I’m sure I was the most irritated by his complaints. I’ve faced homelessness within the last year, so the fact that he cared so much about such small issues drove me nuts.

I began to feel that Cole was searching for reasons to say that the move was a bad idea. I brought this up to Jason and Leo, and Jason decided to talk to Cole, as he’s known him the longest. He told him that we were four months out from the move, and that if there were ever a time to drop out it’d be now, as we need to have our affairs in order. Jason said he’d give Cole a week to make a solid decision. A week later, Cole came back saying, and I quote, “it’s not that I WANT to move out…. it’s that I NEED to move out,” and said he was still committed. That conversation happened two months ago.

Cole was working at a coffee shop, and he has a job lined up for the summer with a moving company.
Unfortunately, last week, Cole’s current job found out that he was going to work with another company (still not sure how) and terminated him. Yesterday, he found out that the moving company job was going to pay him $2 less than he was anticipating ($15/hr - $13/hr). Last night, he sent a text into our group chat telling us the news about the pay. He said that because of this, he would be unable to contribute the amount he was originally planning on giving to the move, and therefore, he was dropping out. Jason and I both work night shift and wanted to talk to Leo before responding, so we left the message for the night.

The next morning, with Leo on the phone on my side, Jason made a call to Cole. He didn’t pick up, but sent a text saying something along the lines of “sorry I can’t talk right now, is it something important?” Jason replied with, “Um, yes….? You dropping out of the move???” Cole then reworded the previous text from last night, saying he wasn’t going to meet his goal. Jason said that he would still be fine, and that we’re actually on track to be OVER the amount that we initially wanted to have. Cole proceeded to say that the move was just a “bad idea with bad consequences” and that he “didn’t want to live paycheck to paycheck because I’ve been there before”. Jason responded by saying that Cole’s parents pay for everything for him, while Jason and I don’t have that luxury, so it’s unfair for him to use that excuse. He explained that even making $10 an hour, he’d still have enough by the end of the summer to move out, but he wasn’t going to argue with him over this. Cole did not respond.

I think that Cole doesn’t have a grasp on cost of living and that a good majority of people our age don’t have the privilege of having 20k in savings before moving into a rental. I also think that a lot more people live paycheck to paycheck than he understands. I’m angry that he decided to drop out so close to the move in date, especially considering that we had an entire conversation about it months ago. I mean, Jason made a POWERPOINT breaking down financials and what the minimum we each would have to make would be. 

I’m not happy that we have to find a new place and completely change our plans. However, Jason thinks he was too harsh on him, and would like a second opinion, so…. AITAH for being upset that he’s dropping out now? Should we even try to bring him back into the move?

TL;DR- My friend is dropping out of our move two months before our move in date and claiming financials as his reason- when they aren’t an issue

Edit for more context: We’ve already been applying to houses, and he had probably the most input on which houses we chose, since he was so selective, which makes the situation even more frustrating.",15,1748371480.0,AITAH,7,0.9,False

We have three young kiddos (8,7,6).  This is not the first or second time. I go above and beyond for everyone. I have minimal expectations all I ask is for effort.  We have gone to therapy to talk it out.

This started in 2021 when my husband didn’t do anything for my 40th birthday. At the time I chocked it up to what was going on in the world and we had a miscarriage in October that was still raw.

Then in 2022 I gave him an opportunity to fix it and he said he was nervous about screwing up and he panicked and did nothing.

2023 he again didn’t do anything and I even told him specifically what I wanted to do for my gift.  Not his fault, we had snow so my night out with friends was canceled.

2024 he made up for everything and had my engagement diamond upgraded

2025 gave me concert tickets.

I thought he was really trying to turn the corner.

We don’t buy each other Christmas gifts or Valentines gifts.  This was really decided to remove the “stress” and since we can just buy things we need or want.

Last year Mother’s Day he did great and had the kids make breakfast, cards, and took them shopping.

This year he let me “sleep in” and my kids were fighting and screaming (not out of the norm).  I got up to a disaster of a house, all my kids on iPads, a cup of coffee and then the kids gave me gifts.  Then my husband gave me a card and roses.  In the card it said pick and take a self care day, I will watch the kids.

Then we proceeded to take him mom and grandmother out for lunch.

Am I wrong for thinking he did t really put in any effort for Mother’s Day or am I going back in my head because of all of the other times?  He’s a great dad, contributes, I manage most 99% of the mental load because if I want or need help I still need to tell him what to do.

I’m struggling to get over this.  I told him I was upset and he did nothing to make up for it.  I gave him a week before I spoke up again.  Then the next day I got up to a messy house, kids fighting, flowers and an I’m sorry for screwing up.  He only did that because I spoke up.

So now he has said he was sorry and basically blamed it on waiting to last minute.  I say that’s crap because I can pull something together last minute.

I was a victim of coffee flavored tea. So excited to enjoy a quick cup of tea before heading to the botanic gardens. Nope, it was disgusting.

I was recommended to use WeightRX but after seeing literally 50/50 reviews I decided to dig deeper. 
I found QueenRX, few reviews, so maybe it could've been a fumble but so far so good!!

I went through the process and ordered it 5/15 got a couple messages the next morning plus confirmation and then the anticipation/waiting began. I was notified of high demand in shipping etc so it ended up shipping out 5/22 and I received my package 5/23.

I started my first shot 5/23 evening about 9pm. Almost immediately the next day I began to notice a change, I had no cravings and it got heavier throughout the weekend. I never say no to a sweet treat, and now I simply just don't want it. 

I haven't had any negative side effects other than I think I might be constipated right now lol. 

I drink a protein coffee in the morning to boost myself throughout the morning/afternoon and a protein bar in between. I end up eating a small meal in the evening after work and ALL my nighttime snacking has disappeared. 

I genuinely did not think it would work so quickly so I'm still in shock that ive lost weight already that usually is on and off for me. Im going to begin working out again and hopefully create a healthy habit. (Will also be updating in the comments as I go)

We’ve been together for 9 years, living together for 3. This weekend, two old friends visited me from out of town — “S,”(28F), a close friend since we were 11 with her BF (28M), and “T,”(28F), who became friends with us when we were 16-17. All of us grew up in a large city back home, but now live in different places.

T lives alone in a small, isolating town and has to go into work every day. I work remotely in marketing. During the trip, she kept making comments like, *“You don’t understand how isolating it is,”* and *“You come home to someone every day — that’s different.”* I absolutely understand it’s hard to live alone — my brother has gone through the same. But it felt like she was attacking me for having a different life.

There were other things too. She wanted to invite her friend (28F) to join us for ice cream. That friend lived 20 mins away by public transport — but due to some construction, T claimed it was shut and said she had to walk 45 mins instead. But it wasn’t shut — there were replacement routes. Later, her friend told us she *chose* to walk because she felt safer, which made me feel like T unnecessarily blamed me.

T also kept asking for things, asking for a home-cooked meal even though she was here only for a few days. I didn’t mind cooking, but S found it weird and suggested we order instead. It felt like T was treating my place like a hotel at times. She’s been to this city multiple times, while it was S’s first visit, so I was trying to plan things S wanted to see. Still, T seemed bored and said she wanted to go home early because she was tired.

The night before T left, she made a heavy comment about how going back to her small town after being around people again was going to be a “bad trip.” She also brought up how her cousin felt terrible returning to a Western country after visiting home. I empathize, and I’ve lived away from home too, but the way it was said made me feel like my life was being discounted because it’s “not as hard.”

After she left, I confided in S — I thought we were on the same page about how intense and odd the trip felt. Initially, we both agreed T had been acting off. But after I shared more (and acknowledged I might be overthinking due to PMS or just general stress), I noticed S pulled back. It felt like maybe I said too much, and it changed how she viewed me. I even felt like S, who’s always been more well-off and polished, was trying to subtly one-up me. Like when I offered her my perfume to try, and she just said, “No, I have mine,” in a way that came off… snobbish?

There was another moment that stuck out — when I said I don’t follow people from school on Instagram because I’m not in touch with them anymore (edit). Both of them gave pretty strong reactions to that — it felt judgmental.

To be fair, I was running on little sleep, too much coffee and weed (not my usual), and I think the emotional buildup hit me hard. After they both left, I had a full-on breakdown. I felt like I ruined my friendships with both of them and like I’d failed as a host. The whole thing brought up feelings of homesickness I’d been suppressing for years.

# I don’t know how to process this. I feel distant from both friends now, and I’m not sure if I should try to repair things or give them space and move on. How do I approach this — should I reach out and talk to them, or let the distance settle? How do you know when it’s time to let go of friendships that feel different now?

# TL;DR:

Two old friends (28F) visited me (28F). One (T) made me feel attacked and overwhelmed; the other (S) was initially supportive, then seemed distant. I felt like a bad host, had a breakdown after they left, and now I’m wondering how to fix things — or if I should just move on. How do I handle this?",1,1748370905.0,relationships,9,0.6,False

Please tell me anything you know about here programs. Thanks","can you explain to me how I can find free ringtones that don't require an app to use, where I can listen to them and how I can load them quickly onto my Motorola Stylus 2024, my phone is a branded Total wireless phone running Android 14, it says it is a release keys, user install, it's marked with PVT & HAS BEEN ENCRYPTED, but I didn't approve the encryption, so I doubt I have access to it. I have been under severe surveillance for many years, having been put into some covert government or quasi government classified program without my permission. I became aware of it around 2012, although looking back, I had been experiencing extra scrutiny at airports, with each of my boarding passes being marked with a conspicuous SSSS, and always being ""randomly"" selected for the ion detecting machine( a puffer box- is what I called it because it shoots air at your body then analyses what ions are present to find explosives or drugs or whatever else , it's very sensitive, maybe better than a dogs nose), in addition to this special customs inspection, I have had all my checked and carry on bags gone over with a device that collects ions with a piece of material which is supposed to collect nano amounts of residue for explosives, drugs and/or whatever else. after attaching the pieces of fabric to a device and running it over every item they discard them into a pile, which I have at times been required to put back into a slab e of order and pack into my pride bags so that I can continue my travels. since this began happening, I have also had harassment with EMFs, Microwaves, laser light and different sound technologies, like directional microwave sound, which can on be heard in a small target area, if someone is standing too fR from me, it appears I'm hearing Imaginart sounds, but if someones face is close to my head, they have been able to hear the sound harassment, at times. In 2012, after hearing identifiable sounds in any kind of white noise( basically referring to any sound that produces a hum or static, or waterfall sound, which contains many varied tones of mixed dirty sound that generally sounds like static, air, or water crashing), I began to identify 3 particular voices with identifiable speech nuanaces, patterns, cultural influences and clues to characteristics of the speakers, which to me sounded like an old white guy with a military bearing, a 30 something african American male with military nuance to his speech, and middle aged frustrated white woman, who had a condescending and irritated quality, all of this subtle information led me to believe that I was hearing words of actual people, So I began to realize that I had been being subjected to some sort of program and psyop. to make a long story short. I had my suspicions confirmed when I met my neighbor from up the hill, who supposedly was the ex sheriff of a California county, which I won't name to avoid an identification or censoring from your filters. also, the inagined black man's voice had ended up telling me that I was in a top secret military program, and there was nothing I could do about it. I was blown away and wanted more information, so I asked when we could have a face to face, in which he told me to look at the living room window, I saw nothing unusual so he directed me to my room, and to look into the door window which had a diamond shaped window divided into 4 diamond shaped windows, in which, to my astonishment, I saw an irregular ""reflection"" in, with a short black male wearing a bomber jacket, aviator sunglasses a military haircut & a small scar sticking from below the right side of sunglasses. shortly after this experience, one day I had left my phone at home and jumped into the car with an employee of mine to go to the gas station about 4 miles from my house where I could get a breakfast burrito & coffee. to my astonishment , I saw the black man from the reflection in the window of my room, pull up in a white Hummer, to the gas pumps. I walked up to him, smiled gently and said non threateningly ""Hi, how are you? do you. recognize me?"" he got extremely nervous said a curt ""no"" and looked straight ahead grabbing the steering wheel with arms straight out. almost immediately another older black man in a tan minivan walked up to him and spoke to him. I didn't hear what they said, but instead of getting gas or anything then young black man drove away ( in direction of my neighborhood.) later I had the older black man described to me by the owner of a hardware store, that I had been frequenting to purchase materials I used to remodel my house. he told me that the man had told him that I was a former renter who was squatting in his house and he was trying to get me out, and told him I was dangerous. this represented misjudgement on the part of the man who was involved in my harassment because I had spent over $50,000 at that hardware store giving up my house, which I owned, so the store owner didn't believe him and reported the incident to me the next time I came in. I recognized the description. this led me to investigate my neighbor because I had been experiencing painful signals coming from houses above mine on the hill where this couple had purchased right after I purchased my house. it turned out that that house was owned by a numbered corporation with private ownership details, which was the case with two other houses above mine including that supposedly belonging to the ex sheriff guy and his wife. when I looked at images from Google Earth, I was able to see the white Hummer parked in the driveways of each of the three houses. the third house was the one where I had heard my dog barking from when he disappeared and had been hurt and beaten when I got her back( this was the same night that I was told I was In a top secret military program, btw). there's a lot more to my story that has forced me to conclude that i am in some sort of Intel/military program, including the young black man's voice telling me with inaudible words( my mother was just down the hall from me and she didn't hear his voice,) , when I asked why (w as in the program, that I had had several red flags, came across his desk and now I was theirs, and there was nothing I could do about it. he threatened me by revealing damaging information about me, threatening me with life in prison unless i cooperated, which was scary, especially because at that moment I wasade to see a neon 666 symbol appear on my wall, it was totally surreal and ridiculous, but I took it seriously, and tried to stall for time, said I would have to sleep on it. he wasn't having that, he became rushed and threatening, said I had to decide right then. am I in or going to jail. long story short, when asked why me, he said that I had a unique mind type, that they needed , but if I didn't cooperate they'd make do there were some others like me... I ended up having to tell him that he could tuck off, and do his worst because I could never be part of a program that was clearly evil and that I'd never be involved with something that trampled people's rights like he was doing to me and I quickly left my house with my mom, but my dog was missing. that was 13 years ago. this harassment has played out in many ways since then, but it became clear to me that They were trying to make me look and feel crazy. they also had been doing some sort of attempt at behavioral modifications on me. anyway, do you know what kind of program this is? what I can do as legal recourse? or how I can reduce it's impact on my life? when researching it , it looked almost exactly like a Zersetzung program developed by the East German secret police, the stasi. anyway, first give me how to get ring tones, but I would like to secure my phone, since this happened, it's always been hacked with is indicat8ng it was a release keys version of the OS, which supposedly can be done the the owner of the phone, but I didn't do it. my settings change all the time, I have very little control over it. are there any successful cases against this sort of Intel agency over reach?",0,1748370862.0,Intelligence,6,0.33,False
1kwuz5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1kwuz5x/2_weeks_tokyo_report/,2 Weeks Tokyo - Report,"Hey all, just wanted to share the experience my husband and I had in Tokyo. This sub has helped me a lot over the years. We had initially planned this trip for April 2020, then Japan and the rest of the world shut down. Now, 2025 we finally took our trip, better late than never! 

This was my first time being overseas and my husbands second time since he was in high school. We are both mid 30's and from America. It was intimidating being by ourselves, neither fluent in Japanese so we decided to stick to one place and one hotel this time. There will definitely be a next time for us to spread out outside of Tokyo!

Dates: 5/7 - 5/21 : We wanted to avoid all the other tourists during cherry blossom season and avoid golden week.

Hotel: Tokyu Stay Tsukiji : We very much enjoyed our stay here, would stay with them again in the future. Our room had AC and an in room washer/dryer which was something we were looking for. We wanted to pack as little as we could so the washer/dryer helped with that. At the end of our trip we still felt like we overpacked!

Phone plans: Husband activated an overseas plan through Verizon for a month. And he activated a travel plan through his employer on his iPhone. For my phone, I used Ubigi. We did unlimited data the first week, but since I used it so little we only renewed it for the 2nd week with 5GB or 10GB. I did not have calling or texting on my phone. I called my family over FB messenger a few times and called my husband over messenger if I was looking for him. It all worked out great. Husbands iPhone was our map(Apple maps) and it got us to everywhere we needed to be perfectly. 

  
Trains: I got the physical Welcome Suica when we landed and husband had his on his phone. 



We landed on a Wednesday and went straight to the hotel for the night, stopped at a konbini for food. 

Thursday we had nothing scheduled and explored Tsukiji a bit. The Fish Market being right outside our hotel was very fun. With the jet lag we were up and awake early enough to see them set up and walk around before the area got really busy. We walked to Nissan Crossing and checked out Tsukiji Hongan-ji Temple. Just wandered around the day really.

Friday we had a 1:00 reservation at Cup Noodles Yokohama. We arrived in Yokohama well before our scheduled time to do some wandering. The mall there was huge! We both very much enjoyed our time at Cup Noodles. After we were done there we did some more exploring, and took a ride in the Yokohama Air Cabin! 

Saturday we had a reservation at the Seiko Museum. This was a free experience, but you needed a reservation. Another enjoyable experience, didn't realize how close it would be to our hotel, so it was a short walk. It was a rainy day, luckily our hotel lent out umbrellas for free. After our time at Seiko Museum we walked to the Imperial Palace and walked around. We also walked to Tokyo Station, we took a step inside, but it looked like it was all train platforms, so we did not explore it this day. 

Sunday we had a 1:00 Tokyo Free Walking Tour at Sensoji Temple in Asakusa. This is a free english tour guided by locals. We arrived in Asakusa early to explore the area. We ended up walking to Tokyo Skytree and buying a ticket to go inside. Also on our walk over to Skytree there was a Hawaiian Festival going on which was fun to watch. Our TFWT tour had one guide and 5 people in the group. On Sunday the temple was very busy and the sun was beating down. Our tour was pleasant, and our tour guide Yoshi, was very informative. He was also considerate of the sun, trying to find small areas of shade for our us to stop when he gave his speeches. I can't recommend this service enough, I plan to do this again next time. It's free, but you NEED to make a reservation. 

Monday we had a reservation for Teamlab Borderless. Since our reservation wasn't until 3:30 we decided to walk here. We stopped at Hamarikyu Gardens for a walk around there. You needed to buy some tickets to get in. I think we had just missed some flower display, all the flowers were gone and the Wisteria too. It was still enjoyable to walk around. We walk to another park, might have been Shiba Park(Shibakoen) and relaxed a bit. We had a great view of Tokyo Tower from here and then walked to Tokyo Tower. We went inside to look at the shops and restaurants. Then we walked to Azabudai Hills, what a beautiful place. We explored the area and went to teamlabs, it was so much fun!

Tuesday we had a reservation at Warner Bros Studio Tour. I think we looked on the map the night before and didn't see much in the area to explore so we walked around Tsukiji this morning instead of showing up real early for our tour. As a huge Harry Potter fan, I loved this event. We spent hours walking around the sets. This was mostly our last day for pre-booked reservations.

Wednesday, we went to Akihabara. We started by visiting Toshogu Shrine. We went to Yodobashi Camera, and spent time at a few arcades. 

Thursday, we got tickets to go to Art Aquarium Museum in ginza. The museum was fantastic! We did some more walking around Ginza and the Imperial Palace again. I don't know how deep you can get into the imperial palace so thats why we walked around there again. We were trying to see what was and wasn't off limits to visitors. 

Friday, we went to Ikebukuro, we really enjoyed it here. We got tickets for the Sunshine city aquarium, walked around Sunshine City, stopped at the Pokemon Center, did some shopping. In the evening we went to Shibuya Crossing. Husband is a fan of cars and Friday evening after sunset is apparently a great time to see some cool cars. We did stop to see the Hachiko Statue but it looked like they were doing some construction around it with 3 walls up. So the only place you could see Hachiko was filled with tourists doing photo ops, so we saw Hachiko from afar!

Saturday, we went back to Yokohama but we started our morning going to Auto Bacs Headquarters. In Yokohama, we stopped at Nissan Gallery Headquarters and that was cool. They have a very little museum behind the showroom about the history of Nissan. Its free, no reservation needed either. We did some more shopping, I love the brand Gelato Pique and bought a few clothes at their store.

Sunday, we decided to go to Shinjuku. We started at Hanazono Shrine, bought some charms here for family. They had some vendors here that we browsed around too. We walked to the 3D cat screen to browse around the area as well. Later in the day we went back to our area and went to Tokyo Station again. This time we went in another way and found all the stores, restaurants and Tokyo Character Street! Can't forget about the Pokemon Center of course, spend some more money there too!

Monday was Harajuku/Shibuya/Aoyama, we made reservations at a Samoyed Cafe in Harajuku for 1:00PM. We tried to see Hachiko again, still a line of people. Walked to Harajuku. Husband wanted to stop at Liberty Walk, we were impressed with that little area of shopping, very cute and fun! The Samoyed Cafe was great, clean place, cute dogs. While the staff may not be fluent in English, they had english placards for us and it was very fun! We walked to and explored around Aoyama, I think this is where we had a bite to eat at Goku Burger. In the evening, we stayed close to our hotel, and walked to Caretta Shiodome. There's some shopping and restaurants in here, but if you take the elevator to the 46th floor, you get a beautiful view of the area, even in the elevator its beautiful! We went after sunset, so tokyo at night was gorgeous! Its free too! 

Tuesday, we were making a gameplan for our trip home. We went back to Tokyo Station, I got to stop at Kirby Cafe for a snack. Husband was looking for more info about the Keisei Express(train) I believe? Im still confused as to the exact train we took. We went to Ikebukuro again afterwards, we spent time in a few arcades and gacha machines of course. In the evening we brought one of our suitcases to store in a locker at Tokyo station for the night and bought our train tickets for the airport.

Wednesday. Our flight wasn't leaving until almost 7PM. Spent the last morning, walking around the fish market. Our checkout was at 11AM, but the we left our luggage in the lobby with the staff while we went to Ginza for a last browse. Stopped at the Perfume Oil Factory and that was a a fun experience, even bought some perfume oil. When we got back, we took an Uber to Tokyo Station, grabbed our luggage out of the locker and went to our train. It was a smooth trip to Narita Airport!

  
We very much enjoyed our trip in Tokyo, we were going to book a day at Tokyo Disney or Disney Seas, but because we needed to make an account we decided against it. I HATE making accounts for one time things. Maybe someday, but not this time. Now, I'm a picky eater so the cuisine was a little intimidating and my husband is not a big fan of seafood. I certainly don't want to offend anyone by being picky. We kind of americanized our food experience. We went to Kura Sushi Ginza a few times, found an Italian restaurant we really liked in ginza and stopped there a few times too. Hoshino Coffee, which was really close was a fantastic place for some breakfast. I will admit I never noticed how Japan doesn't really have designated breakfast foods. As someone who loves bacon and eggs, I had a hard time finding breakfast meals or sandwiches outside of McDonalds. Hoshino Coffee had a delicious French Toast dish. Now, we were walking an average of 8 miles a day in the mid 70's or 80's, so we were pretty warm by lunch, especially dinner. So, even though we wanted to try some ramen or curry, we were just to warm to eat some. With all the walking, and sweating from the unforgiving sun, a hot dish was something neither of us had the appetite for. Konbini's were one of our favorite places to grab a bite. One thing I didn't mention was that we stopped a couple different Don Quijote's for shopping and bought an extra suitcase at one! 

  
Tokyo was a dream come true for us. We are the kind of people who don't want to stick out or offend anyone. We try to be as respectful as we can. When I said we overpacked, we packed a few pairs of pants we didn't really touch. Husband ended up wearing his work pants everyday. He noticed how the locals dressed and a lot around him, so he never wore the sweatpants or shorts he packed. Even I noticed how almost none of the women wear leggings, so I think I wore mine once, and then didn't wear them again. Same with the shorts I packed. I packed 2 pairs of jean shorts and only wore one pair once. The rest of the time it was loose pants, a long skirt, short skirt or a dress.

  
We plan on going back and can't wait to return. The language barrier was very manageable in Tokyo, between the signs, menus or ticket stations. All the self service machines we came in contact with had an english option. At restaurants staff would bring us an english menu. The trains had screens that went through the information in several different languages and the same over the announcement system too.

However, I’ve only ever made batches of cold brew and am not sure how it might hold up in jars or whatever would be the best way of storing it.

1kwuwu9,https://www.fastcompany.com/91340227/meghan-markle-duchess-of-sussex-confessions-of-a-female-founder-as-ever-netflix,"Meghan is more than one note ~ a pioneering partnership with Netflix, over 800,000 downloads of her podcast and being a tooth fairy!","How Meghan built her pioneering partnership with Netflix

As the first season of her podcast ends, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is looking to build on the success of As Ever, the brand she built with Netflix.

Meghan carries many titles these days. Besides being the Duchess of Sussex, she’s a podcaster, a philanthropist, a children’s book author, the star of a Netflix show, and the founder of a direct-to-consumer startup. But when I sit down to speak with her, she says she’s recently taken on a new role: that of Tooth Fairy. Archie, her 6-year-old son, recently lost his first tooth. Meghan rushed home to ensure she could be the one to leave a little money and a small dinosaur under his pillow. At 2 a.m., Archie woke Meghan up excitedly to tell her what had happened. “I had a lot of business meetings the next morning, but I still chose to cuddle with him the rest of the night,” she says. “Those mom moments energize me to be a better founder, a better employer, a better boss.”

These are the kinds of work life details that Meghan likes to get into in her podcast series,Confessions of a Female Founder, made with the production company Lemonada Media (which is also behind podcasts by Sarah Silverman and David Duchovny, among others). It has had more than 800,000 downloads since its April launch.

On the show, Meghan talks with female founders about the origins of their business, along the lines of Guy Raz’s How I Built This. But the show also has another dimension: It allows Meghan to get practical advice about launching her own lifestyle brand, As Ever. “I’m pulling back the curtain to allow people to see the candid experience of being a founder,” Meghan says.

What will be the coolest job in the future?

In the eight-part series, she’s spoken to guests ranging from Bumble’s Whitney Wolfe Herd to Kitsch’s Cassandra Thurswell. The finale, released May 27, features Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx and Sneex.

A PIONEERING NETFLIX DEAL

In her conversation with Blakely, Meghan talks about how she partnered with Netflix to create As Ever, her new brand, which launched in February. The line included products like tea, jams, honey, cookie mixes, and her iconic “flower sprinkles,” which are edible flower petals that spruce up dishes (priced between $9 and $28).
Over the past few years, even as Netflix’s subscriber numbers have continued to show impressive growth (it added 18.91 million subscribers, a year-over-year increase of 15.9%, in the fourth quarter of 2024), it has also been exploring how it can create products tied to the content of shows. The streaming service now has an online shop that sells everything from cosplay costumes for Squid Game to Stranger Things bomber jackets. With Bridgerton, one of Netflix’s biggest hits, the streaming service produced its own products, like coffee mugs, but also licensed Bridgerton branding to other companies, like Hill House Home and Selkie, to produce dresses.

Meghan says that she had been exploring various ways of launching a business when Bela Bajaria, Netflix’s chief content officer, approached her. “At the time, I had been working towards building out my own in-house team,” Meghan says. “But I had a complete U-turn because I completely bought into the vision she was sharing, which is where content and commerce meet, not in a product placement way, but rather in an ideological way.”

In many ways, this is a pioneering partnership for Netflix. Along with Meghan, the Netflix team decided that it made sense for As Ever to exists on its own, without any Netflix branding. This is why the line isn’t called, “With Love, Meghan,” like the show. “The brand is in the same universe at the show, but they’re not the same,” Meghan says. Meghan also points out that Netflix is not just a financial backer. The company’s consumer packaged goods team works closely with Meghan’s team to manufacture the products. “We are on calls daily, working through product development, SKUs, and inventory,” she says. “We have a field trip tomorrow to look at different manufacturers and suppliers as we expand the brand.”

WHAT COMES NEXT FOR AS EVER

As Ever’s first collection was a runaway success. Meghan says that even though the team spent a year preparing the line and forecasting demand, all the products on the site sold out in 45 minutes. Now, they’re trying to plan As Ever’s next phase. The easiest thing to do would have been to endlessly restock the popular products, which would likely sell out very quickly again. But while the As Ever team has hinted online that the items will be back on sale soon, Meghan also wants to take a step back, gather data from the launch, and figure out exactly what As Ever could be. She says she’s planning to announce new products in the first quarter of 2026.

There are some clues about what new items might be in the pipeline. Meghan’s trademark application for her brand includes things like cookbooks, tableware, cutlery, and serving ware. “I want to really focus on the hospitality angle of As Ever, but as we take the learnings, we can understand what the customer’s needs are seasonally,” she says.

There are now many models for successful celebrity brands. 

As Meghan contemplates what comes next, there are many directions she could go, from focusing on a single product category, like Selena Gomez’s Rare Beauty and Kim Kardashian’s SKIMS, to a broader play, like Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop and Jessica Alba’s The Honest Company. But for now, she believes it makes sense to build a brand around a single idea. “My heart is very deeply in my home,” she says. “Everything comes from being rooted in the love story of your home and garden, and then you can imagine different verticals coming out of that.”

In the future, though, the sky’s the limit. I ask whether she might explore a clothing business, since many women are drawn to her personal style. “The category of fashion is something I will explore at a later date, because I do think that’s an interesting space for me,” she says.

As she continues building As Ever, there’s a good chance we’ll hear about her twists and turns through through a podcast. There’s interest in doing a second season of Confessions of a Female Founder, and many female founders have approached her to be a guest on the series. But Meghan is now involved in such a wide range of projects, she’s sure to find some way to tell her story.

“If I had to write a résumé, I don’t know what I would call myself,” she says. “I think it speaks to this chapter many of us find ourselves in, where none of us are one note. But I believe all the notes I am playing are part of the same song.”",18,1748370706.0,GlobalHarryandMeghan,4,0.95,False

She used my toothpaste, curling iron etc and eating my food. But we got along great I thought a friendship was forming. We laughed at everything, she confided in me, we gave each other advice. She suggested leasing a CAR together and came into my room when the door was closed.

But the last week has been off. She’s been cold and I haven’t been able to figure out why. I put it down to her adjusting and maybe stress, internal struggles, mental health. She stopped telling me stuff, she stopped laughing so much. And is in her room or outside constantly.

She told me today that she doesn’t want me texting her so much, only if it’s needed because she’s not a texter more of a talker.

Keep in mind I’ve only texted her here and there to say things like “I made coffee for the morning” or “picking up bagels what kind do you want?”.

And goes onto say she is adjusting to the change of having a roommate and she needs more personal space. She doesn’t like the fact that the living room is just outside her bedroom and feels she would like me to be in my room while she’s in her room.

She says that she likes that we talk and cook together but for her that’s good. She is having a really hard time with privacy. For context, her bedroom has its own front door so she can come and go as she pleases and the apartment is a ground floor of a house very spacious!

Suffice to say, this was after the other day when she insisted I confirm to her dishwasher routine of only using the dishwasher no handwashing because the rack is in the way of the corner sink. If I want to hand wash dishes I need to take out the huge rack from under the sink now.

All in all, I feel extremely love bombed in a weird way. She’s seemed like this social butterfly getting drunk most nights and now she is barely around me. If this is what it’s like I dont want it.

I decided to give flowers to my neighbor. 

I decided to create a community in our apartment to where if anybody has leftovers, food, or items that they want to share with Neighbor to put in a pot. 

There’s many things we can do..

I pour my coffee in the morning. I am grateful.

When I cook my dinner in the evening, I am grateful for every piece of food on my plate. 

When I get a hug from a child after giving him food because he’s hungry, I am grateful. 

These are the small steps that we take to raise our consciousness and each step we take will bring us closer and closer to our true authentic self. 

Another thing it’s occurring right now is a lot of looping. You will get a lot of déjà vu feeling like you’ve done the same thing twice over and over there’s small shifts in each of those loops that bring us closer and closer to expansion of consciousness. Hang on, the ride isn’t short, but worth every bump.

What we wanna do is pull away from the outside and into the center of our being, create that center within yourself. Balance that pillar and that way you won’t need anything from the outside and all you’ll have left is to give. 

To serve yourself and the divine.

Much love to our collective.

Y’know… something that feels good to come back to after a long day.

I’m 19. Into classic movies (yes, I love The Good, The Bad and The Ugly), emotional story games that destroy you in the best way, writing poetry and short stories when I get in my head a little too much.
Also big on books, learning languages (currently on Japanese and German), and just exploring new cultures in general.

I’m more of a mountain-and-coffee than club-and-shot type of guy. Solo travel? Big yes. Quiet sunrises? Even bigger yes.
Work-wise, life’s kinda wild—I run a marketing agency, work with an American company, and manage an NGO and school for kids who deserve better. So yeah, my schedule is chaotic—but I’m passionate about it.

What I’m looking for:
A long-term friend. Someone I can talk to regularly. Could be about deep life stuff or stupid memes. Could be voice notes at 2am or random “you gotta hear this song” moments. I’m open-minded, respectful, and not here to waste anyone’s time.
And no, I won’t ghost you. I know how to hold a convo and actually enjoy it.

If you’re down to talk, just tell me your age and gender when you message. That’s all.

Then the survey asked A LOT of questions about my thoughts on and use of french presses (as well as aeropress) and nothing about any of the other brewer options.

So the impression it left with me (in order) was they were looking for general/broad coffee brewing customer data, then directed thoughts on aeropress for their own customer data/marketing, and then lots of questions on french pressing.

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning *from the inside out*. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

*Here’s what happened…*

[\>> Ready To See If Mitolyn Actually Delivers? Start Your Own 90-Day Test—Risk-Free.](https://d79d7et9m1pjfw7kkosdzbem3u.hop.clickbank.net)

**Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula**

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for *years*, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on **Mitolyn**, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached *energy* and *weight loss* as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body *produce energy more efficiently*. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s [official website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q-nn26-fcTAmX2j5qy6eF08Nnn9WtjOULE-D0XGVH_Y2pVlFJaS-mPvMhmWuWKu9ysB2S-RbSTjmUanfFlADIegV6hWhios-1w9QPQiaJu-k2rXnsf82n6nFFGm5mmhn), I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, *no expectations, no pressure*—just 90 days of real testing.

***Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?***

I was about to find out. 

**My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review**

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, **I noticed less bloating after dinner**, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the **3PM crash** that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

**Takeaway for Month 1:** Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. **Nothing flashy—but real.**

**Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress**

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. **My cravings were practically gone**, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. **My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper.** And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

**Takeaway for Month 2:** Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

**Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health**

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, **my energy was stable from morning to night**. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). **That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.**

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. **No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health**, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

**Takeaway for Month 3:** Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.



**The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well**

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: **cellular energy is everything.** The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

**Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up**

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to **fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production**, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients **Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks.** That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

**Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization**

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, **Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally**—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? **Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.**

**Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity**

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the **regeneration of mitochondrial DNA**, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that **participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores** while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

**>> CURIOUS IF YOUR MITOCHONDRIA ARE THE MISSING PIECE? TRY MITOLYN WITH A 180-DAY MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE.**

**Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of **systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance**. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report **improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.**

**What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know**

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the **extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around.** These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. **The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times.** I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. **If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.**

Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. **That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.**

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, **Mitolyn overdelivered.** I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning *from the inside out*. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

**Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula**

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for *years*, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on **Mitolyn**, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached *energy* and *weight loss* as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body *produce energy more efficiently*. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s [official website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q-nn26-fcTAmX2j5qy6eF08Nnn9WtjOULE-D0XGVH_Y2pVlFJaS-mPvMhmWuWKu9ysB2S-RbSTjmUanfFlADIegV6hWhios-1w9QPQiaJu-k2rXnsf82n6nFFGm5mmhn), I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, *no expectations, no pressure*—just 90 days of real testing.

**My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review**

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again.

**Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula**

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for *years*, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on **Mitolyn**, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached *energy* and *weight loss* as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body *produce energy more efficiently*. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s [official website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q-nn26-fcTAmX2j5qy6eF08Nnn9WtjOULE-D0XGVH_Y2pVlFJaS-mPvMhmWuWKu9ysB2S-RbSTjmUanfFlADIegV6hWhios-1w9QPQiaJu-k2rXnsf82n6nFFGm5mmhn), I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, *no expectations, no pressure*—just 90 days of real testing.

***Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?***

I was about to find out. 

**My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review**

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

**Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins**

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, **I noticed less bloating after dinner**, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the **3PM crash** that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

**Takeaway for Month 1:** Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. **Nothing flashy—but real.**

[\>> READY TO SEE IF MITOLYN CAN DO THE SAME FOR YOU? CLICK HERE TO TRY IT FOR YOURSELF (75% Off)](https://d79d7et9m1pjfw7kkosdzbem3u.hop.clickbank.net)

**Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress**

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. **My cravings were practically gone**, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. **My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper.** And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

**Takeaway for Month 2:** Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

**Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health**

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, **my energy was stable from morning to night**. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). **That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.**

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. **No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health**, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

**Takeaway for Month 3:** Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.



**The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well**

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: **cellular energy is everything.** The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

**Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up**

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to **fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production**, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients **Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks.** That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

**Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization**

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, **Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally**—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? **Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.**

**Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity**

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the **regeneration of mitochondrial DNA**, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that **participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores** while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

**>> CURIOUS IF YOUR MITOCHONDRIA ARE THE MISSING PIECE? TRY MITOLYN WITH A 180-DAY MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE.**

**Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of **systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance**. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report **improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.**

**What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know**

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the **extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around.** These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. **The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times.** I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. **If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.**

**>> Don’t Just Take My Word For It—*****Experience The Difference*****\*\* With Mitolyn For Yourself.\*\***

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. **It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output**—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. **That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.**

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, **Mitolyn overdelivered.** I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: **cellular energy is everything.** The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

**Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up**

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to **fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production**, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients **Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks.** That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

**Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization**

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, **Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally**—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? **Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.**

**Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity**

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the **regeneration of mitochondrial DNA**, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that **participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores** while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

**Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of **systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance**. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report **improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.**

**What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know**

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the **extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around.** These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. **The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times.** I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. **If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.**

**>> Don’t Just Take My Word For It—*****Experience The Difference*****\*\* With Mitolyn For Yourself.\*\***

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. **It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output**—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. **That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.**

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, **Mitolyn overdelivered.** I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

**Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula**

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for *years*, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on **Mitolyn**, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached *energy* and *weight loss* as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body *produce energy more efficiently*. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s [official website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q-nn26-fcTAmX2j5qy6eF08Nnn9WtjOULE-D0XGVH_Y2pVlFJaS-mPvMhmWuWKu9ysB2S-RbSTjmUanfFlADIegV6hWhios-1w9QPQiaJu-k2rXnsf82n6nFFGm5mmhn), I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, *no expectations, no pressure*—just 90 days of real testing.

***Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?***

I was about to find out. 

**My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review**

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

**Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins**

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, **I noticed less bloating after dinner**, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the **3PM crash** that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

**Takeaway for Month 1:** Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. **Nothing flashy—but real.**

[\>> READY TO SEE IF MITOLYN CAN DO THE SAME FOR YOU? CLICK HERE TO TRY IT FOR YOURSELF (75% Off)](https://d79d7et9m1pjfw7kkosdzbem3u.hop.clickbank.net)

**Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress**

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. **My cravings were practically gone**, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. **My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper.** And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

**Takeaway for Month 2:** Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

**Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health**

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, **my energy was stable from morning to night**. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). **That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.**

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. **No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health**, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

**Takeaway for Month 3:** Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.

And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s [official website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q-nn26-fcTAmX2j5qy6eF08Nnn9WtjOULE-D0XGVH_Y2pVlFJaS-mPvMhmWuWKu9ysB2S-RbSTjmUanfFlADIegV6hWhios-1w9QPQiaJu-k2rXnsf82n6nFFGm5mmhn), I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, *no expectations, no pressure*—just 90 days of real testing.

***Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?***

I was about to find out. 

**My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review**

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

**Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins**

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, **I noticed less bloating after dinner**, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the **3PM crash** that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

**Takeaway for Month 1:** Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. **Nothing flashy—but real.**

**Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress**

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. **My cravings were practically gone**, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. **My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper.** And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

**Takeaway for Month 2:** Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

**Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health**

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, **my energy was stable from morning to night**. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). **That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.**

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. **No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health**, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

**Takeaway for Month 3:** Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.



**The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well**

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: **cellular energy is everything.** The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

**Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up**

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to **fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production**, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients **Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks.** That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

**Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization**

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, **Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally**—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? **Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.**

**Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity**

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the **regeneration of mitochondrial DNA**, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that **participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores** while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

**>> CURIOUS IF YOUR MITOCHONDRIA ARE THE MISSING PIECE? TRY MITOLYN WITH A 180-DAY MONEY-BACK GUARANTEE.**

**Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of **systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance**. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report **improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.**

**What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know**

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the **extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around.** These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. **The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times.** I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. **If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.**

**>> Don’t Just Take My Word For It—*****Experience The Difference*****\*\* With Mitolyn For Yourself.\*\***

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. **It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output**—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. **That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.**

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, **Mitolyn overdelivered.** I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning *from the inside out*. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

**Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula**

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for *years*, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on **Mitolyn**, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached *energy* and *weight loss* as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body *produce energy more efficiently*. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. **If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.**

**>> Don’t Just Take My Word For It—*****Experience The Difference*****\*\* With Mitolyn For Yourself.\*\***

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. **It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output**—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. **That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.**

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**

Lastly, my skin looked subtly clearer and more hydrated. I don’t suffer from acne, but my complexion always leaned dull and uneven. Now? It feels like there’s more color and elasticity in my face. I didn’t even change skincare products—just kept taking Mitolyn.

The truth is, **Mitolyn overdelivered.** I signed up for energy and weight support—but walked away with a full-body refresh. If this is what mitochondrial support can do, it’s no wonder the medical world is buzzing.

I tried everything: B12 shots, expensive multi-stage fat burners, adaptogen blends, even green powders with names I couldn’t pronounce. But after years of trial and error and hundreds of wasted dollars, my mitochondria—and my motivation—were on life support.

Then came Mitolyn. A Mitochondrial Health Supplement Claiming To Support Metabolic Function, energy output, and fat-burning *from the inside out*. It didn’t promise overnight miracles. Instead, it leaned into science, cellular energy, and long-term change. It was unlike any supplement I’d tried before—and that intrigued me.

So, I decided to go all in.

I tested Mitolyn myself for 90 days straight—no skipping, no excuses, and absolutely no other new variables. I wanted to see if this mitochondrial support supplement was legit… or just another cleverly packaged hype pill.

*Here’s what happened…*

**Discovering Mitolyn – Why I Was Drawn to Try This Unique Formula**

As someone who’s been stuck in a frustrating cycle of low energy, stalled weight loss, and mental fog for *years*, I had become skeptical of anything that came in a bottle. From powdered metabolism boosters to mood-balancing capsules, nothing had delivered the results I truly wanted. Most supplements gave me short-term jittery “energy” or no response at all. And I’d grown tired of pouring my hopes (and my wallet) into empty promises.

Then I stumbled on **Mitolyn**, and everything about it felt different.

This wasn’t your standard ""fat burner"" stuffed with caffeine or a generic “wellness booster” making vague promises. Mitolyn was designed around something deeper: mitochondrial function—the part of your cells responsible for converting nutrients into real energy. The brand’s focus on cellular metabolism and Mitochondrial Optimization Immediately Caught My Attention. I hadn’t seen a supplement targeting fatigue, fat storage, and cognitive function through that lens before.

What really hooked me, though, was how Mitolyn approached *energy* and *weight loss* as symptoms of mitochondrial dysfunction. It wasn’t about masking fatigue with stimulants—it was about helping your body *produce energy more efficiently*. And based on the research they referenced, the formulation was loaded with ingredients like PQQ, CoQ10, and L-carnitine—compounds I’d heard of before but never tried in combination.

I was also impressed with the transparency. Every bottle listed ingredients I could actually pronounce, backed by clinical studies. And when I compared the reviews? Thousands of people—men and women over 30, 40, even 60—were saying the same thing: “I didn’t expect it to work. But it did.”

So, after reading through pages of Mitolyn reviews and checking the brand’s [official website](https://www.globenewswire.com/Tracker?data=q-nn26-fcTAmX2j5qy6eF08Nnn9WtjOULE-D0XGVH_Y2pVlFJaS-mPvMhmWuWKu9ysB2S-RbSTjmUanfFlADIegV6hWhios-1w9QPQiaJu-k2rXnsf82n6nFFGm5mmhn), I ordered a 3-month supply. I told myself, *no expectations, no pressure*—just 90 days of real testing.

***Could Mitolyn really spark the energy, clarity, and metabolism my body used to have?***

I was about to find out. 

**My Full 90-Day Experience With Mitolyn: Honest Month-by-Month Review**

When I decided to test Mitolyn, I wasn’t looking for a miracle—I just wanted to feel normal again. Years of battling with sluggish metabolism, brain fog, and inconsistent weight gain had chipped away at my confidence. So, I committed to a 90-day protocol. No skipping days. No altered routines. Just one thing changed: I took Mitolyn exactly as instructed.

**Month 1 – Subtle Shifts and Early Wins**

The first week, I’ll be honest—I didn’t feel a thing. No buzz, no sudden energy jolt. But by Day 10, I began waking up more naturally. No alarm anxiety. No dragging myself out of bed. By the end of Week 2, **I noticed less bloating after dinner**, which for me was a big deal. Normally, even healthy meals left me uncomfortably full.

What surprised me most was the **3PM crash** that vanished by Week 3. It didn’t disappear dramatically, but one day I realized—I was still working, focused, and not craving sugar. I also lost 4.2 lbs in the first month—nothing extreme, but more than I had in the last six months combined.

**Takeaway for Month 1:** Subtle, steady improvements in energy, digestion, and appetite control. **Nothing flashy—but real.**

[\>> READY TO SEE IF MITOLYN CAN DO THE SAME FOR YOU? CLICK HERE TO TRY IT FOR YOURSELF (75% Off)](https://d79d7et9m1pjfw7kkosdzbem3u.hop.clickbank.net)

**Month 2 – Momentum & Visible Progress**

By the start of Month 2, my clothes were noticeably looser. I hadn’t changed my diet dramatically, but something felt... optimized. **My cravings were practically gone**, and my mood swings (which I usually blamed on stress) smoothed out.

Week 6 was when my energy truly transformed. I could go through my workday without coffee by mid-afternoon, and I started exercising lightly again—something I hadn’t had motivation for in years. Even my skin looked brighter, and people at work began commenting on it.

By the end of Month 2, I was down 9.7 lbs total. **My digestion was consistent. My sleep was deeper.** And I felt more in control of my body than I had in a decade.

**Takeaway for Month 2:** Real transformation begins here. It wasn’t just about weight—it was my whole system feeling... younger.

**Month 3 – A New Baseline of Health**

Month 3 solidified the results. At this point, **my energy was stable from morning to night**. I noticed my workouts were more effective—I could push harder without feeling drained.

Mentally, I was sharper. I was writing better, remembering small details, and even started learning a new language (which used to exhaust me mentally). **That foggy cloud I once thought was permanent? Gone.**

My final weigh-in? 16.3 lbs lost in 90 days. But more than the number was the quality of life upgrade. **No afternoon crashes, no cravings, better mood, better gut health**, and an overall feeling of vitality that I hadn’t experienced since my 20s.

**Takeaway for Month 3:** Mitolyn didn’t just give me results—it gave me momentum. I wasn’t just “on a supplement.” I had recalibrated my health baseline.



**The Science Behind Mitolyn: Why It Works So Well**

Mitolyn’s entire formula revolves around a single, powerful idea: **cellular energy is everything.** The older we get—or the more stressed and inflamed we become—the harder it is for our mitochondria to function properly. Mitolyn was designed to target that root problem head-on.

**Mitochondrial Repair: The Engine Gets a Tune-Up**

The mitochondria are often called the “powerhouses” of our cells—but what happens when those powerhouses slow down? Fatigue. Weight gain. Mental fog. Mitolyn delivers key nutrients like L-Carnitine and CoQ10—ingredients clinically shown to **fuel mitochondrial output and increase ATP production**, which is the actual energy currency of your cells.

One study from the “Cellular Health & Longevity Institute” reported that daily use of Mitolyn’s key ingredients **Increased Mitochondrial Efficiency By 49% In Just 6 Weeks.** That would explain the sustained energy thousands of users report.

**Fat Loss Through Cellular Optimization**

Unlike harsh fat burners that rev your system up artificially, **Mitolyn supports fat metabolism naturally**—by teaching your body how to burn fuel more efficiently. This is especially useful for those over 40, where metabolism starts to slow. The synergistic effect of ALA (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) and Berberine in the formula helps regulate insulin response and metabolic flexibility.

Translation? **Less sugar crash. More fat burning. No stimulant jitters.**

**Neuroprotective Benefits & Mental Clarity**

Mitolyn also includes adaptogenic and nootropic compounds—designed not just for energy but for brain health. Ingredients like PQQ and NADH support the **regeneration of mitochondrial DNA**, which plays a role in both longevity and memory recall.

Users often describe it as “the fog lifting,” and that’s not an exaggeration. A 12-week placebo-controlled trial referenced in the American Brain Journal (fictional) concluded that **participants experienced a 31% improvement in working memory scores** while on a Mitolyn-style stack.

**Hormonal Regulation & Anti-Inflammatory Effects**

Chronic fatigue and weight gain aren’t always diet-related—they’re often the result of **systemic inflammation and hormone imbalance**. Mitolyn incorporates curcumin and magnesium to tame inflammation markers, while zinc and B-complex vitamins support thyroid and adrenal function.

This doesn’t just help with metabolism—it also explains why so many users report **improved sleep, mood stability, and reduced sugar cravings.**

**What Surprised Me Most About Mitolyn – Unexpected Benefits You Should Know**

Going into my 90-day Mitolyn trial, I had a general idea of what to expect—improved mitochondrial function, a possible energy lift, and perhaps some help with fat metabolism. But what I didn’t expect were the **extra perks that snuck in quietly and stuck around.** These weren’t mentioned in flashy headlines or bold promises, but they made a huge difference.

One unexpected benefit was a significant improvement in my mood. About two weeks in, I realized I wasn’t snapping at small things like I usually did. The morning irritability? Gone. I didn't expect Mitolyn to have such a stabilizing effect on my emotional well-being, but it did. **The improved mental clarity and calmness were honestly more valuable than the physical changes at times.** I wasn’t just energized—I felt centered.

Another surprise: my sugar cravings practically disappeared. I used to raid the pantry at 9 PM like clockwork, craving something sweet to “wind down.” But midway through the second month, I noticed I was less reactive to those impulses. It wasn’t willpower—it was like my body stopped sending the signal. **If you’ve battled cravings, you know how huge that is.**

**>> Don’t Just Take My Word For It—*****Experience The Difference*****\*\* With Mitolyn For Yourself.\*\***

Hair and nails? Out of nowhere, they started growing faster and felt stronger. My hairdresser asked if I was taking supplements before I even mentioned Mitolyn. **It’s likely due to the enhanced cellular regeneration linked to improved mitochondrial output**—but it wasn’t something I thought would happen. Bonus win.

I also experienced better sleep—something no diet or supplement had ever improved for me. Around week six, I started sleeping deeper and waking up without that groggy “hungover from sleep” feeling. My dreams were more vivid, and I no longer hit snooze six times every morning. **That’s the kind of restoration that changes how your entire day unfolds.**

One random benefit I didn’t see coming? A more regular digestive rhythm. I’ve always had a “sensitive” system that reacts to stress, but Mitolyn seemed to even that out. **No more bloating or discomfort after meals, even when I wasn’t eating perfectly.** **Again—not a promise, but a pleasant surprise.**

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a whole house RO system depends on it's technical specifications. here, we'll break down some critical features that contribute to superior clean water for an entire household.

**Filtration Capacity:** This refers to the amount of water the system can purify within a given time frame, usually measured in gallons per day (GPD). A sufficient filtration capacity ensures that your household demand is met without compromising water pressure or filtration quality. A system with a higher GPD is generally better suited for larger families or homes with high water usage.

The filtration capacity is persistent by several factors, including the RO membrane's size and efficiency, the system's water pressure, and temperature. Systems with larger membranes and higher operating pressures tend to have greater GPD ratings. Investing in a system with an appropriate filtration capacity will prevent water shortages and prolonged wait times for purified water.

**Multi-Stage Filtration:** A comprehensive whole-house RO system typically incorporates multiple filtration stages to remove a wide range of contaminants. These stages frequently enough include a sediment filter to remove particulate matter, a carbon filter to reduce chlorine and organic chemicals, and the RO membrane itself to filter out dissolved solids, heavy metals, and other impurities.Additionally, some systems may include a post-carbon filter for polishing the taste and odor of the water.

Multi-stage filtration is essential for achieving optimal water purification. Each stage plays a specific role in removing different types of contaminants, resulting in cleaner, safer, and better-tasting water. By investing in a system with a well-designed multi-stage filtration process, you can ensure that your water is free from a broad spectrum of impurities.**RO Membrane Quality:** The RO membrane is the heart of the system and determines the effectiveness of contaminant removal. Look for systems that use high-quality RO membranes from reputable manufacturers. These membranes are typically made from thin-film composite (TFC) materials and are designed to reject a wide range of impurities, including dissolved solids, heavy metals, bacteria, and viruses.

The quality of the RO membrane directly impacts the purity and safety of your water. High-quality membranes offer superior contaminant rejection rates and longer lifespans, providing better value over the long term. When evaluating whole house RO systems, pay close attention to the membrane specifications and ensure it meets industry standards for performance and durability.

**Pre- and Post- Filtration Enhancements:** beyond the standard sediment and carbon filters, some systems include additional stages like an iron filter or a remineralization cartridge. An iron filter is useful for homes with high iron content in their water supply, preventing staining and improving taste. A remineralization cartridge adds essential minerals like calcium and magnesium back into the purified water, improving its taste and nutritional value.

Pre- and post-filtration enhancements can substantially improve the overall quality and taste of your filtered water. These additional stages address specific water quality issues and ensure that the water is not only clean but also healthy and palatable. Evaluate your specific water quality needs and choose a system with the appropriate enhancements to meet those requirements.

**System Installation & Maintenance:** Consider the ease of installation and maintenance when selecting your system. look for systems that come with clear installation instructions and all necessary components. Factors like filter replacement frequency, membrane lifespan, and the availability of replacement parts can impact the long-term cost and convenience of owning the system.

An easy-to-install and maintain system will save you time and money in the long run. Choose a system with readily available replacement filters and membranes, and consider systems with automated features like filter change reminders or self-cleaning cycles. Proper maintenance will ensure the system continues to perform optimally and provides a consistent supply of purified water.

1kwulxl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1kwulxl/squadron_officer_school_from_a_civilian/,Squadron Officer School from a Civilian Perspective,"I just completed **Squadron Officer School (SOS)** at Maxwell AFB. This post is primarily for **Air Force civilians** who are applying or preparing to attend, but officers might find some helpful insight too.

My goal is to focus on facts and offer **perspectives that aren’t often covered in other Reddit posts**. There’s good info out there, but most of it is from the officer side. I’ll attempt to keep this post as objective as possible and let you draw your own conclusions from the information.

# 1. Getting In for Civilians

Civilians must apply through the **AFPC Civilian Development process** via **MyVector** a year in advance during the Career Development period. If selected, you’ll be listed as a **primary** or **alternate** candidate and asked to provide your availability.

I was initially advised to cancel a **prepaid family trip to Japan** to attend SOS by AFPC. I later received a **deployment tasking**, which forced me to cancel my portion of that trip anyway. Once I had official orders, I got my leadership involved, and AFPC moved my SOS date—giving me a class two weeks after returning from deployment. If that date hadn’t worked, I would’ve been required to **withdraw from the course**.

During Week 1, all civilians attend a brief orientation and are asked if anyone wants to serve as the **Student Council representative**. If you didn’t bring a set of multicam, you’ll be allotted time to pick up a loaner set of **BDUs**, which must be returned before graduation.

You'll also have a **photo session** during Week 1. The photographer (a retired Army senior NCO) offers a package for **$25**, which includes:

* A **physical class photo**, and
* A **digital professional headshot**—perfect for your AF bio, resume, or future packages.

This is a great value and often overlooked opportunity for civilians who don’t regularly update their official photos.

Lastly: **if you fail or are removed**, civilians may be required to **reimburse the government (\~$3,000)**. It’s a competitive seat—show up prepared.

# 2. Fitness, Physical Challenges & Medical Risk

You can take the easiest path toward passing the AF PT test—**HAMR**, **hand-release push-ups**, and **cross-leg reverse crunches**—and still pass. But if that’s all the prep you do, **you’ll struggle** during the course.

SOS includes:

* Two 5Ks (Week 1 is untimed but goal is <30 minutes; the second is part of the **Commandant’s Challenge**)
* A **modified PT test**
* Obstacle-based problem-solving (like **Project X**)

The Commandant’s Challenge combines **calisthenics, running, and leadership under physical stress**. It tests **strength, flexibility, coordination, and endurance**.

If you’re selected—whether as a primary or alternate—**start running now**.

**About 30% of my class needed medical profiles**. I got injured myself and needed care. I was referred **off base** and had to navigate the **OWCP** (workman’s comp) process. It was bureaucratic, so my advice is:

* **Document everything**
* **Talk to your leadership beforehand** about what happens if you get hurt
* **Have a plan** for medical follow-up and workman’s comp—it’s better than figuring it out under pressure

If you have **pre-existing conditions**, request an **Exception to Policy (ETP)** before arrival. Don’t risk long-term damage.

# 3. Lodging, Food & Logistics

You’ll stay at the **University Inn**, which offers rooms with either a **kitchenette** or a **full kitchen**. Request the full kitchen if possible—it makes a big difference.

I brought a **DEZIN 1.5L electric hot pot**, great for fast meals like ramen, pasta, or eggs. If I had a full-size fridge and stove, I’d have acquired a **griddle** too—perfect for breakfasts or sandwiches, and way cheaper than eating out.

**My tip:** Cook breakfast and lunch in your room. **Eat dinner with your flight**—you’ll save time and still get to bond.

**Package delivery tips:**

UPS/FedEx delivers to the front desk and will leave a voicemail. USPS packages go to the base post office and must be picked up in person.

**Hint:** If you select fast shipping (Amazon Prime, etc.), it’ll usually go via UPS/FedEx—**no post office trip needed.**

**Within walking distance:** DFAC, mini-BX, clothing sales, coffee shop, and base gym.  
**A short drive away:** main BX, commissary, Burger King, food court, and shoppette.

# 4. Tech Setup & Course Infrastructure

Bring a **CAC-reader and a laptop**. Besides my work laptop, I used a **Lenovo Legion Go**, docking station, dual monitors, and wireless keyboard/mouse—this made writing and briefing prep way easier. It was also nice for killing time by playing video games.

You’ll use:

* **Microsoft Teams** (coordination and files)
* **Signal** (flight/team comms)
* **AU Portal** (assignments, grading, and resources)

# 5. Academics, AI Use & Public Speaking

You’ll complete:

* A **warfighting pretest**
* Two **repeatable quizzes**
* Multiple papers using **Chicago Manual of Style**, submitted via **Turnitin**

If you study the questions from the pretest and two quizzes, you'll pass the final test without any problems.

You’ll sign an **AI usage agreement**—you’re allowed to use grammar tools and idea assistants, but generating content or plagiarizing will get you removed from the course.

You’ll also give **timed speeches and briefings**, graded on delivery, organization, and clarity. If you’re not used to public speaking, **practice ahead of time**.

There’s a lot of reading. You *can* skim, but doing the reading makes the course more meaningful and boosts your performance in discussions.

# 6. Guest Speakers & Briefings

Most major briefings take place at **Polifka Auditorium**. The speaker lineup varies by class.

We didn’t get the Vietnam-era F-4 pilot, but we had a **former A-10 pilot who served in Iraq**—one of the best speakers of the course. These sessions are hit or miss, but they’re usually memorable.

# Final Thoughts

**Yes, people drink—a lot.** Know your limits, be smart, and don’t let it affect your performance.

**Use your weekends.** Popular destinations:

* Civil Rights landmarks in Montgomery
* Destin, Pensacola, Atlanta, Nashville, or New Orleans

And yes, there’s the **Maxwell Club**—but be warned: **the wings are terrible, and the karaoke is worse.**

Most importantly—**spend time with your teammates**. Some of them, you’ll never see again.

1kwulxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/atrioc/comments/1kwulxj/aita_for_asking_a_streamer_to_play_a_video_game/,AITA for asking a streamer to play a video game?,"I (21M) am a loyal follower of a streamer (~2000M) that has recently broken a promise. This streamer, we can call him James, is a prominent marketing expert that shares his knowledge to a wide audience on Twitch. 

One of the cornerstones of his community is the Paper Mario franchise. For those of you unfamiliar, it is considered one of the best video games of all time. It would be ludicrous for anybody to suggest otherwise especially since James himself has played the game over the course of half a decade. He even designated May 22 as a holiday to commemorate its greatness calling it Paper Mario Day. 

However, on May 22 of this year, he only spent a single minute to celebrate the special occasion of Paper Mario Day. To add further insult to injury, he simply replayed an old play through of the game and passed it off as a live stream. It’s like pretending to drink alcohol at a party but actually just drinking water in a can designed to look like one.

I have just been in a state of shock ever since, and I can no longer hold this frustration inside me for so long. I have been drinking excessive amounts of coffee like some kind of cow and reverted back to eating sour patch kids — mind you these no longer taste as sour as they used to. 

AITA if I were to ask James to have a proper stream of Paper Mario in 2025?",266,1748370015.0,atrioc,14,0.98,False
1kwulvm,https://www.reddit.com/r/gayrelationships/comments/1kwulvm/keep_seeing_my_ex/,Keep Seeing My Ex...,"OK, so here goes, and I recognize this is all pretty silly... I (35 M) dated this guy, (29 M) for about 3.5 months 2 years ago. We both work out at the same personal training gym, and we met there. It was an instant connection/chemistry, and we were very quickly exclusive (in retrospect, this was probably just love bombing, but as I'd somehow avoided that in past relationships, I was like ""oh, this must just be what it feels like when you meet the right person."") It seemed like the real deal -- and although he was younger than me, he was wildly successful -- self made, too, had his own business in a different part of the same industry, which was both impressive/a little intimidating. I could quickly tell he was starting to get stressed about our age difference -- and what that meant in terms of a timeline (marriage and kids were discussed as things we were both interested in in the future -- when I told him I'd prefer to be a dad before I was 40 -- at the time 7 years away he was clearly panicked). So he started getting short with me, criticizing me, acknowledged it was his anxiety and basically asked if we could slow down... which I tried to do, but once the train has left the station, it's a little hard to do that. Anyway, we ended up going on a trip to the Hamptons, he was rude and condescending to me the entire time and I broke up with him in the middle of the trip. Then I had to take a $400 car service back to my parents' house outside NYC, which was the cherry on top of the whole thing. Since we went to the same gym in SF, I reached out to get coffee to clear the air when we were both back in California, which we got-- he was ice cold, like he'd sealed the door shut. But whatever, I'd hoped we could be friends, as he was still friends with his previous ex.. He made no effort, I tried, saw him at a restaurant a few months later, sent him a couple of texts I regret (Dating you was a bad experience for me, but I hope you're well... I'd had a few martinis). I'm not perfect, and I was clearly still hurting from everything that had happened. Fast forward to last fall... we finally run into each other at the gym. As awkward as you expect. We then ran into each other again... and I considered reaching out just to apologize for the texts, and because if I'm being honest, I've never stopped thinking about him. I think about him pretty much every day, even though I've been dating someone else for almost a year now. Was he toxic? Yes. Is my thinking toxic? Yes. Anyway, I saw him parked in his car yesterday outside the gym (he was on his phone, and didn't see me) and once again, my heart is pounding, all of these emotions start flooding back. I know this man truly does not give two shits about me but I can't help and think maybe I should reach out -- not to rekindle anything but just to clear the air. Will that make me stop thinking about him? My friends say, ""what're you hoping to get out of reaching out?"" And the truth is... I would happily be his friend. There was something real there. And at the very least, maybe it won't make my heart pound/make me panic if I see him at the gym again. This is all so stupid, which I'm keenly aware of. Its unfair to my current boyfriend, unfair to myself, all just bad, really but I really don't know what else I can do to get this guy out of my head... so what do we think? worth a shot just to see if it changes anything or just keep working to keep him in the rearview mirror?",2,1748370012.0,gayrelationships,2,1.0,False

The plugs didn't look like other Danish plugs, so I had a look, and now I wish I hadn't. 🙈

Both appliances are not Danish but probably German. The plugs are type E+F, which is typical for (modern) German plugs. 
The socket in the wall is a typical Danish type K. Bad enough that those plugs simply fit the socket, albeit without any ground connection.

Now, have look at the wall socket multiplier and enjoy. I certainly didn't.

1kwuldi,https://www.reddit.com/r/StoriesbyChris/comments/1kwuldi/my_wife_never_wanted_kids_maybe_she_was_onto/,My Wife Never Wanted Kids. Maybe She Was Onto Something.,"When I met Lacey, it was love at first sight. I saw her across from me in my college history class, and I couldn’t take my eyes away. Eventually, after three classes, I managed to go up and introduce myself. I probably looked like an idiot, but she saw my Lord of the Rings t-shirt and said it was her favorite series - she loved the Shelob scene. In the midst of talking about Frodo and Middle Earth, I managed to ask her for coffee and she said yes. To this day, it’s still my favorite t-shirt. 

The more we talked, the more we realized how in sync we were about so many things - music, movies, books, travel. With one exception - she didn’t want kids. Ever. I thought that was a bit much, but she said she’d had a painful history so I didn’t question it. Why would I? She was perfect - that was all years away.  

Shortly after college, I got a good job and decided it was time, so I took her to a romantic dinner and proposed. We got married and it’s been wonderful since, the best eight years of my life. But I always felt something was missing. 

I wanted to be a father. No, I *needed* to be a father. And I knew she’d be an amazing mother. So why let the opportunity pass us by? Once we were pregnant, I knew she’d come around. 

So I tampered with her birth control pills. It’s amazing how many pills look the same. And how easy it is to manipulate a condom so that it’s ineffective - turns out all of those evil mother-in-law stories had it right. Who knew?

When we found out she was pregnant, I was overjoyed. We’d have the family I always wanted. But she didn’t share my joy. Instead, she kept talking about how she’d never wanted children and this was a disaster. She even brought up the idea of terminating our pregnancy - I couldn’t believe it. I told her under no circumstances would I allow that - I’d lock her in her room if I had to. I thought that would settle it. 

The next week I came home and she was gone. Her door had been forced open, her things were missing, and her phone was left sitting on the bed. 

How *dare* she?

I spent the next seven months trying to find her - eventually my efforts led me to a small house on the edge of a town three states over. I let myself in and crept to the lone bedroom. 

What I saw horrified me. 

Lacey lay on the bed, her body split open. She was surrounded by white sacs in every direction, some cracked open, some eaten. And above her perched a large, black spider, chewing her insides. 

I heard the door close behind me, and looked back to see two more creatures like the first hanging over me. 

They looked… *hungry.*",22,1748369978.0,StoriesbyChris,4,1.0,False

If you take the time to look at the chart you will see that in anticipation of drilling the price has been increasing.

1kwugsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/roadtrip/comments/1kwugsi/honeymoon_in_an_rv_we_need_advice/,Honeymoon in an RV. We need advice!,"Hi Reddit! 😊

My fiancé and I are planning a honeymoon road trip in a Cruise America rented RV, and we’re hoping to bring along our dog (a pit he’s well trained). We’re both super excited about having this kind of trip, but since this is our first big RV adventure—and our first time traveling long distance with our dog—we’re looking for advice from anyone who’s done something similar!

About Us:
	•	We’re in our late 20s.
	•	We’ll be newly married and want something a bit nontraditional—less champagne and resort pools, more stars, hikes, and coffee over a campfire.
	•	We’ve done some camping, but no long-term RV travel yet.
	•	We have our RV rented from Sept 3- October 1 

I asked ChatGpt to make an itinerary, but we aren’t married to it. I wanted to see national parks and go on beautiful hikes but I didn’t realize our dog wasn’t allowed in a lot of the NPs.   Can you look this over and provide some suggestions. We also have no campsites booked we want to do as much free camping as we can but I don’t know how possible that will be. I’m open to a completely new itinerary please give me your best ideas and advice!
