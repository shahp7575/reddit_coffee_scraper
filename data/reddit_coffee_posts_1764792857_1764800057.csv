1pdi6r9,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1pdi6r9/ai_bubble_is_going_to_burst_soon_someone_told_me/,“AI Bubble Is Going to Burst Soon.” Someone Told Me This Yesterday… and I Couldn’t Stay Quiet. [I will not Promote],"Yesterday I was sitting with a friend over coffee, and out of nowhere he drops this line:

“Bro, this AI bubble is going to burst. Everything is overhyped. Half these startups will vanish.”

And for a moment, I actually stayed silent.
Not because he was wrong… but because I’ve lived on both sides of that sentence.

I wasn’t supposed to build an app.
I wasn’t the “tech founder” type.
I was just someone who saw medical students drowning under textbooks, coaching materials, PDFs, and notes and thought:
There has to be a smarter way.

I didn’t join the hype train.
I wasn’t chasing VC buzzwords.
I was literally debugging React Native screens at 3 AM while half the world slept.

And yet, every headline today screams:
“AI is overhyped.”
“LLMs slowing down.”
“Bubble will pop.”
“Companies inflating numbers.”

Maybe that’s true. But here’s what I told him:

“Bubbles burst when things are built for investors… not for people.”

Because the week I finally launched my AI study app, I didn’t expect anything magical. But the first time a student took a picture of their handwritten notes and instantly generated MCQs? That wasn’t hype. That was relief.
The kind you can hear in someone’s message when they say:
“This saved me 40 minutes of revision.”

Hype doesn’t save time.
Real problems do.

That’s when I realised something important:

AI hype will burst.
AI usefulness won’t.

The bubble will take down:

Copy paste tools with no core value

“We added AI” startups with nothing underneath

Products built for pitch decks instead of humans


And honestly? Let them fall.
Let the noise disappear.

Because late at night, when I’m fixing backend logic or pushing new features, I’m not thinking about the bubble. I’m thinking about the student who’s going to open the app tomorrow and study a little faster, a little smarter, and maybe a little less stressed.

So yes, maybe the bubble will pop.
Maybe the news headlines are right.
Maybe investors will run.

But the students using AI to turn heavy textbooks into manageable revision sessions?
They aren’t going anywhere.

And neither am I.

If anyone else feels this wave of hype vs reality in AI would love to hear your side. This space is changing fast, but the people building quietly in the background… we see a very different picture.

1pdi3bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/content_marketing/comments/1pdi3bl/i_handled_36_agency_clients_at_once_and_the/,I handled 36 agency clients at once and the hardest part was not the work. It was asking for payments.,"This is not a promo or complaint. Just a real experience that I want to share because content and client work are not always as smooth as LinkedIn makes it look.

I used to run a personal branding agency. At one point we were handling 36 clients at the same time. Dealing with deadlines, strategy, copywriting, editing and expectations was difficult but we somehow managed.

But the one thing that stressed me more than delivery was something very simple. Asking for payment.

It used to make my stomach heavy to type  
""Can you please clear the invoice""  
even when the project was delivered and the results were good.

Sometimes I used to type a brave message and then delete it and restart the conversation with just a simple  
""Hi""  
because I did not want to hurt the relationship.

I thought this was only my personal fear until two days ago. I met three agency owners for coffee and they all said the same thing. They deliver great work, the client is happy, but payment reminders feel uncomfortable. They worry the relationship will break or the client will get offended.

It made me realise that creating content and delivering content may be the easy part. The emotional part of client work is much harder.

Curious how others here handle it.

Does it become easier with experience  
Do you hire someone to handle reminders  
Do you automate it  
Or do you not feel uncomfortable and send reminders easily

I was just trying to survive, you know? Then suddenly my boss calls me into his office.
Instant panic. My brain already writing my resignation note, my alibi, and my escape plan to another country. He looks at me with a serious face and says: We need to talk.

Great. Love that sentence. Not terrifying at all. But then he tells me they noticed how I’ve been handling the mess lately — solving problems, helping people without being asked, basically keeping the place from collapsing. And just like that… he offers me a better position. More responsibility (yay?), more money (YAY), and the fun part… everyone else in the room stopped breathing. I swear I heard jealousy hit the floor like a glass. I walked out trying to look calm, but inside I was celebrating like I won the lottery.

Humans sometimes appeared and disturbed them, and the toys had to react or 
hide.

There is one episode where the toys drink a lot of coffee (or some kind of drink) and become hyperactive. There were also scenes that took place at a beach.

Her age, the fact she’s unsteady on her feet and is needy (not financially, but with ‘can you do this or that for me?’) is why we even made the decision to live with her. 

MIL doesn’t have a car. She had a brand new leased one a few years ago, but didn’t get a different one when it was turned in. When she had the car, she did let me use it several times as needed for random things. 

Here we are today…the heat went out on my partners car, I have a newer Chevy Malibu. We’re heading out in the morning to go to Tennessee for 5 days, from Michigan. We decided to rent an SUV just for the room and comfort that a sedan doesn’t offer…and MIL hit us “does that mean I can use your car while you’re gone?!” (she’s not going) 

-This woman has not driven in about 4 years. She’s left the house only THREE times in the past year. She gets confused about what day it is, thinks that a store that’s been gone for 20 years is still in town, can’t even operate the coffee maker and other random signs of cognitive decline. -The windows in my car have 5% tint and I know it will reduce visibility for her. -The 92yr old man that lives across the street just totaled his car this past summer, was in the hospital for several weeks along with his wife who ultimately passed from her injuries. So I’m weirded out about allowing some elderly people to drive. 

The room fell silent after my partner said “that’s *my name* car” and I acted like I didn’t hear her. I know she’ll hit him up again about it. So would I be TAH to stand firm and say NO? She’ll be mad and say she needs independence, but sorry…her life, the life of innocent people on the road (and my beloved car, but that’s last on the list) are more important!

As it is right now based on the kinds of employees I see working and patrons inside, I always feel like I'm missing out on the potential missed opportunity in connecting with someone I find attractive and interesting. Could be their face, fashion style. Most cafes in my area are dotted with people enjoying coffee with someone or on their laptops doing work, and there's always a few I can pick out who I find instantly attractive. I see this every day because I walk to work in a downtown setting. The cafes are also interiorly designed like a scene in a movie. It's the aesthetics and lifestyle of it all. It's all very manipulative and designed to make you feel you're a part of some middle upper class societal norm, at the expense of the physiological and neurological effects occurring in your body. If I could think on coffee, I'd go more, for sure. My life would be so much more fun, going to cafes all over the city. But I get stupid and uglier and I still drink the dumb inducing brown water.

1pdhxf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AIEducation/comments/1pdhxf6/ai_bubble_is_going_to_burst_soon_someone_told_me/,“AI Bubble Is Going to Burst Soon.” Someone Told Me This Yesterday… and I Couldn’t Stay Quiet.,"Yesterday I was sitting with a friend over coffee, and out of nowhere he drops this line:

“Bro, this AI bubble is going to burst. Everything is overhyped. Half these startups will vanish.”

And for a moment, I actually stayed silent.
Not because he was wrong… but because I’ve lived on both sides of that sentence.

I wasn’t supposed to build an app.
I wasn’t the “tech founder” type.
I was just someone who saw medical students drowning under textbooks, coaching materials, PDFs, and notes and thought:
There has to be a smarter way.

I didn’t join the hype train.
I wasn’t chasing VC buzzwords.
I was literally debugging React Native screens at 3 AM while half the world slept.

And yet, every headline today screams:
“AI is overhyped.”
“LLMs slowing down.”
“Bubble will pop.”
“Companies inflating numbers.”

Maybe that’s true. But here’s what I told him:

“Bubbles burst when things are built for investors… not for people.”

Because the week I finally launched my AI study app, I didn’t expect anything magical. But the first time a student took a picture of their handwritten notes and instantly generated MCQs? That wasn’t hype. That was relief.
The kind you can hear in someone’s message when they say:
“This saved me 40 minutes of revision.”

Hype doesn’t save time.
Real problems do.

That’s when I realised something important:

AI hype will burst.
AI usefulness won’t.

The bubble will take down:

Copy paste tools with no core value

“We added AI” startups with nothing underneath

Products built for pitch decks instead of humans


And honestly? Let them fall.
Let the noise disappear.

Because late at night, when I’m fixing backend logic or pushing new features, I’m not thinking about the bubble. I’m thinking about the student who’s going to open the app tomorrow and study a little faster, a little smarter, and maybe a little less stressed.

So yes, maybe the bubble will pop.
Maybe the news headlines are right.
Maybe investors will run.

But the students using AI to turn heavy textbooks into manageable revision sessions?
They aren’t going anywhere.

And neither am I.

If anyone else feels this wave of hype vs reality in AI would love to hear your side. This space is changing fast, but the people building quietly in the background… we see a very different picture.

Hey folks, so earlier today I posted that the 5090 FE's were in stock and available at MSRP. I wanted to break down the process I went through to get my card.

# The Problem

I was after the FE edition, and pretty much each time I checked the NVIDIA site, it was showing as out of stock.

# The Solution - Stock Checker

After searching for some stock checker software, I came across a few options:

[**https://notify-fe.plen.io/?volume=0.98&repetitions=3&apiAlarmEnabled=true&refresh=10**](https://notify-fe.plen.io/?volume=0.98&repetitions=3&apiAlarmEnabled=true&refresh=10)



This dude is a genius and is getting a coffee from me for sure.

# How to Use It:

1. Select your country
2. Select the FE you want
3. Hit start
4. If you get a green light on the API state, that's good - it's now linked to the Nvidia site and actively monitoring stock
5. Click the settings icon and set the sound to repeat 3 times

# Mobile Issue

The problem I had was on my mobile in the Chrome browser - it pretty much timed out when it wasn't left open on the screen, or if the device went into screen-off mode. Back to the drawing board to solve this issue.

# Pattern Analysis - Finding the Drop Time

After doing some more searching, I found a site called [**nowinstock.net**](http://nowinstock.net) and searched for 5090 FE stock history.

I took the data and dumped it into Gemini and Claude with this prompt:

>

# Stock History Data:

    Date - Time | Store : Model
    Dec 01 2025 - 2:48 PM EST | NVIDIA Store : NVIDIA RTX 5090 FE Out of Stock
    Dec 01 2025 - 7:48 AM EST | NVIDIA Store : NVIDIA RTX 5090 FE In Stock for £1,799.00
    Nov 03 2025 - 4:57 AM EST | NVIDIA Store : NVIDIA RTX 5090 FE Out of Stock
    Nov 03 2025 - 4:47 AM EST | NVIDIA Store : NVIDIA RTX 5090 FE In Stock for £1,799.00
    [... full history continues ...]
    

# Gemini's Analysis

**The ""Golden Window"" for UK buyers: Tuesdays and Wednesdays around 2:00 PM (14:00)**

# Best Days to Check (UK):

* **Wednesday** \- most frequent (11 occurrences)
* **Tuesday and Friday** \- also strong (6 occurrences each)
* Mondays and weekends remain quiet

# Best Time of Day (UK Time):

* **14:00 (2:00 PM)** \- most common time for stock (corresponds to 9:00 AM EST drops)
* Secondary window: 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM
* Occasional evening drops, but mid-afternoon is most reliable

https://preview.redd.it/7jjjt9bj925g1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=eebe8736b573ea52823b71de0dce1692393ca95c



# Gemini's Prediction for Next Drop:

**Wednesday, December 3rd @ 14:00 GMT (2:00 PM)**

**Why?**

* Wednesday historically strongest day for restocks (11 total drops)
* Monday Dec 1 drop was statistically rare (Mondays only \~10% of drops)
* Pattern often corrects back to Tuesday/Wednesday rhythm after outliers
* Previous months showed clustering behavior

# The Result - IT WORKED! 🎉

I was driving so had an alarm set for **13:55**.

* Alarm goes off, I pull over on a side street
* Launch the site and **bang on 13:59** I hear the sound and the box goes green
* Clicked the link - initially only showed 5080 and 5070 FE
* Did a refresh and **there it was, in stock**
* Completed payment and order was placed and accepted
* **All done by 14:10** 

About 14:15 and 14:25-14:30 ish, the stock alerts from Hotstock and some Telegram/Discord trackers also went off.

**Gemini's prediction was bang on!**

# How Did Claude Do?

# Claude's Response:

**Most Likely Next Restock:**

* Date: Late December 2025 or early January 2026
* Specifically: 27-31 December 2025 or 2-3 January 2026
* Time (UK):
   * Primary window: 2:00-2:30 PM GMT
   * Secondary windows: 12:00-1:00 PM GMT or 3:00-4:00 PM GMT

**So, pretty much it failed.**

# Tips

* If you have a spare phone, you can disable screen-off and leave that site running
* It also works perfectly on a desktop browser

# What's Next?

Next step: figure out how to get DDR5 RAM at a reasonable freaking price!

Good luck, everyone!

1pdhqta,https://www.reddit.com/r/immigration/comments/1pdhqta/from_detention_centers_to_publishing_a_book_my/,From detention centers to publishing a book — my writing process & what surprised me.,"Hi everyone,

I hope this kind of post is okay here — if not, mods please remove.

My name is Mikhail, and I recently finished writing my first memoir after spending years stateless and moving through places like American Samoa, Vietnam, Nepal, Benin, and Eastern Europe.

I’m not here to promote or sell anything — I know the rules well.
Instead, I wanted to share a bit about the experience of writing about trauma, immigration struggles, and unexpected moments of beauty, and ask for advice from this community of readers and writers.

I spent nine months stranded in American Samoa without a valid passport, survived a wrongful detention in Congo, was deported multiple times, worked in a tiny coffee shop on Martha’s Vineyard, and even found love in the most unexpected place — West Africa.

Trying to turn all of that into a coherent book has been… overwhelming, healing, and strangely clarifying. Writing forced me to relive things I thought I buried forever.

My question for you all:

For those who enjoy reading memoirs —
What makes a personal story truly resonate with you?

Is it vulnerability?
Is it humor?
Is it political context?
Is it the travel and place descriptions?
Is it the emotional arc?

I’d love to hear what pulls you into a memoir and makes you keep turning pages. I’m revising my manuscript now and your perspectives would mean a lot.

Thank you for reading — happy to answer questions about the writing process or the experience of turning real-life chaos into a story.

— Mikhail

Brew started getting gross so I knew it was overdue. The machine has been in use for 2 years, just shy of 1600 drinks.

I’ve run the descale process without descaler 3x. The second time cleared a chunk of broken puck with white stuff inside it. I’ve also removed and soaked the infuser and pumped it after seeing the weird puck. The brew still has a sour chemical taste and there is white residue coming from the coffee extractor but not the water spout on a rinse. 

Is something up internally? I also replaced the filter and primed per the instructions but don’t think that’s the issue. 

As much as I love a latte at home this is really making owning one of these a bit of a pain. This process and the cost of the filters and descaler is making me want to go back to a simple pour over. :(",1,1764798643.0,superautomatic,2,1.0,False

1pdhk49,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1pdhk49/my_night_at_carroway_house_by_ajb/,My Night at Carroway House by AJB,"The Carroway house was there long before I was born. I remember my grandfather telling me how he used to play ding dong ditch, it was a badge of honour who could get the most swears from the irritated homeowners. Grandfather proudly showed off the scar he got from the pan thrown at his head.  The old bungalow loomed over the town high on a hill. At night, its lit windows glowed like the eyes of a beast, watching over us with the patience of an immortal being. Ivy climbed its brick walls like a second skin; trash dotted the overgrown lawn. Beer cans and condoms. Every time I passed it, even from a distance, I could smell the place. The stale scent of mold carried on the wind; it was as if the place was rotting from the inside.

An eyesore, my mother called it, and yet, nothing was done about it. No one condemned it, or did welfare checks on the aged owners. The Carroways had influence my parents said, whatever that meant. From the few glimpses I caught of them, I couldn’t see how. Mr Carroway, a squat man, more fat than sense, always walked around in a filthy wifebeater vest. Grease and coffee stains painted him like a pattern, paired with cargo shorts that revealed pale, balloon-like legs, he looked, for lack of a better term, like an off-duty clown. Mrs Carroway on the other hand, was made from plastic. A barbie doll left out in the sun for too long. Her wrinkly jowls were pulled back with Botox, her gnashing teeth shined like porcelain. Looking at her just felt wrong, especially when she stood next to her husband. A funhouse mirror couple. Every weekend they came into town, Mr Carroway touched everything in the display cases, leaving a trail of greasy handprints in his wake, while Mrs Carroway shrieked her shrill laugh. The town agreed they were a nuisance, but nothing was done. Whether from fear or this supposed influence, I couldn’t tell you. Then, something happened.

Two months had passed; the couple hadn’t been seen since. They were still in the house. Every night, thick black smoke billowed from the chimney, filling the dark sky like fog, permeating the air with an acrid, burnt smell. It clung to your clothes, burnt the hairs of your nostrils. People didn’t care, as long as the couple no longer bothered them. The Carroway house was an old, dilapidated house, owned by a strange couple gone missing. So, why am I writing about it? Because I am going to break inside.

Not by myself, of course, I have friends tagging along. Safety in numbers as they say. Alvin, my next-door neighbour, was a squirrely, hyperactive kid, raised on the iPad. He jumped when I mentioned going to the house, but insisted on filming it.

“Why?” I asked, frowning at his cheap handheld camera,

“For YouTube,” he said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world,

“We could be the next Sam and Colby,”

I scoffed, “Doubt it.”

It sounded like a stupid idea to me, but I let him bring the camera, if only to keep him quiet. If he did upload to YouTube, I doubt it would get many views. He better not do that stupid Wojack face for the thumbnail.

My other friend, Harris Simmons, was, unfortunately, a wimp, no other way to say it. Smaller than the rest of the kids in class, jumping at every sound, and with yellow skin, it made him a prime target for bullies. Born with jaundice, it gave him skin like candlewax, that and his initials earned him the nickname, ‘Homer Simpson.’ Alvin still called him that, much to his chagrin. It wasn’t as bad as the other nickname, ‘Foetal Alcohol Syndrome.’ Besides that, he was a good kid, went along with anything, even exploring a weird, scary house. I asked him if he truly was alright, he once admitted that the Carroways gave him night terrors. Harris nodded, his blond hair flopping,

“I’ll be fine, it might cure me of my nightmares.”

I wasn’t so sure about that. As we walked up the overgrown path, lined by thorny bushes, I could see Harris getting nervous. His waxy skin glowed with sweat,

“Guys, I don’t know,” he muttered, the wind whipping away his words, “This seemed like a good idea during the day, do we have to do this at night?”

Alvin scoffed, “It isn’t night yet,” he pointed his camera up at the violet sky,

Harris tutted, “Whatever, it’s going to be in a few minutes, and what if the old woman catches us?”

“No chance, my brother says she was taken away,” Alvin reassured,

“When?”

Alvin shrugged, “I don’t know, he said she was stalking the streets, singing and chasing after cars,”

“Taken by who?”

Alvin shrugged, “Police, ambulance, nuthouse, does it matter?”

“I guess not.”

Harris wasn’t convinced, biting down on his golden lip. I bumped shoulders with him,

“Hey, try not to worry, if anything goes wrong, we’ll protect you,” I glanced at Alvin, currently doing 360 spins with his eye stuck to the camera,

“Well, I will, anyway.”

Harris offered a shaky nod, shuffling along with his hands clasped. I gave him another reassuring pat, then, Alvin dropped his clunky camera, followed by a torrent of swears. Harris jumped, frowning at their friend.

They traipsed through the overgrown brush, snapping twigs, and crushing beer cans underfoot. The only sound in the otherwise quiet night. Looking back, I should’ve noticed that it was too quiet. We reached the front door, bunched awkwardly on the doorstep. Alvin was closest but instead of reaching for the handle, he just zoomed in and out with the camera. I sighed, even Harris twitched with irritation,

“Maybe it’s locked,” the fear returned full force.

Wordlessly, I grabbed the handle, it turned easily. Harris visibly deflated.  The door swung open with an ear-splitting creak, revealing a wall of darkness. Alvin went first, camera ready, mouth hanging open, then me, pulling Harris along. We stepped over the dark threshold, straight into the maw of the beast.

The moment I entered, the first thing that hit me was the smell. Grease. The stuffy air was thick was it. It was like the walls had absorbed the grease from a thousand meals. The front door led them into the kitchen, the core of the greasy stench. The kitchen was a mess. The counters were piled high with dirty dishes, layered with crusty mold that was once food. Pots and pans congealed with fat, sticking out of stagnant dishwater. The peeling wallpaper revealed dark patches underneath, I peered closer with a grimace, black mold. Finding a light switch, I flicked it, filling the air with the incessant buzz of fluorescent bulbs. It was like stepping into a 24-hour diner.

Our footsteps stuck and unstuck to the floor like Velcro. The windows were decorated with handprints, like after the Carroways ate their fried food, they pressed their hands and faces to peer out the window. Alvin audibly cringed, sticking his camera into the grime. Harris stood in the middle of the tacky floor, hesitant to go further but unwilling to run away.

“They really liked fried food,” Alvin noted, dipping a finger in the congealed in the congealed fat. It left an indent up to his knuckle,

“Ew! Don’t touch it!” Harris exclaimed, Alvin laughed,

“Hey Homer,” he spun round, brandishing his gooped finger at Harris,

“Same shade.”

Harris puffed up with anger, stepping forward to shove him. I ignored them, nauseous from the stench.

We left the kitchen, closing the door to hopefully cut off the smell. It didn’t work. The cold hallway was dark; I thought it was from the lack of light but no, the walls were plastered with black mold. Pulling my shirt over my nose, I gestured for the others to do the same. My father told me about black mold, if you breathed in even one spore, it would settle in your lungs and fester. Killing the pink tissue and shrinking the lungs until you hacked up black muck. Harris had his shirt pulled up to his nose, leaving only his watery eyes darting around. I couldn’t help thinking that his red shirt made him look more like Bart Simpson. Alvin had the camera close enough to the wall to scratch off dark flakes. I slapped him on the back.

“Stop it, asshole.”

As they walked further down the contaminated hallway, careful not to breathe, another sound joined the buzzing cacophony. It was like the crackle of an old TV. They passed a living room, sat against the wall was an ancient cuboid TV, complete with crooked rabbit ears. It was on but no one watched. The screen danced with fuzzy static, background music to our antics. Alvin ran around, chirping and zooming in on everything.

“Look at the state of this couch!”

Plopped in the middle of the room was a red satin couch, dark and shiny from years of use. As I got closer, there was a definite person shaped imprint. Mr Carroway’s fat body was forever embedded in the cushions, flattened by years of sweat and grease.

“Ew!” Harris shouted, peering over Alvin’s shoulder,

“I dare you to touch it, Homer,” Alvin smirked,

“No way, are you crazy? I’ll catch Ebola or something,”

“Aw, come on. Don’t be a loser,”

“How does not touching something gross make me a loser?”

“I don’t know, ask your mother.”

Harris flushed; it only made his cheeks more golden. I sighed, walking away from the stupid argument. I walked around the room, looking at the pictures hanging on the walls. The Carroways throughout the years. The first was of the young couple, in old timey wedding attire. The woman scowled out at him, the husband with his eyes closed, light reflecting off his shiny, bald head. Wait, bald? Mr Carroway wasn’t bald. He had disgusting, matted hair. Hair didn’t just grow back, did it? In the second picture, Mrs Carroway still scowled, with a few lines around her, with her blonde husband, hanging off her arm. No, that wasn’t right either. Mr Carroway had black hair. I didn’t bother looking at the rest, even at a glance I saw there was a different man in each one.

“Jeez, Mrs Carroway sure got around, huh?” I turned to my friends, only to find them still bickering. Alvin pressuring Harris to touch the couch, shouting ‘Doh’ as he did. Harris just seethed, trembling with barely disguised anger,

“If I touch the stupid couch, then you have to stop calling me Homer Simpson,” Harris told him, Alvin smirked,

“Yeah, sure, just do it.”

Harris took a hesitant step forward, like approaching a wild animal. His yellow fingers danced across the crusty couch; the plastic screech of the material set my teeth on edge. Harris barely held back a whine,

“It’s like touching a bald man’s head.”

The mention of bald reminded me of what I found, before I could reveal it, Alvin made another stupid joke,

“Bald like Homer?”

He laughed as Harris shot him a glare. Alvin walked away, still chuckling. I stuck out my foot, and Alvin went flying, him and the camera clattered to the floor. I shot Harris a thumbs up. Alvin grunted, face planting against the wall. He steadied himself with a hand, then jumped back like he was electrocuted.

He yelped, “What the hell?!”

He touched the wall again; his bruised face twisting with confusion.

“This wall is freaky,”

“Yeah, yeah, very funny,” I muttered, gesturing for Harris to follow me,

“No, seriously,” Alvin scrabbled for his camera, “Touch it.” He reached for my hand; I slapped him away.

“Alvin, you’re starting to piss me off.”

Starting to panic, Alvin grabbed Harris’s hand, and pressed it against the wall.

“God damn it, Alvin, I-,” Harris frowned, feeling up the wall. His eyes widened,

“Ugh,” he turned to me, “The wall is soft.”

“Soft?”

The living room walls were plastered with old newspapers, the few bare spots were a sickly shade of pink, mottled with the same mold as the hallway. Alvin raised his camera, pressing a finger to the wall again. There was some give to the wall, it even squished under his touch.

“God, how does that even happen?”

His finger came away shiny, “The wall feels like it’s about to crumble,”

I rolled my eyes, “It’s the mold.”

“It must be all over the place,” Harris said, rubbing his hand on his jeans, Alvin whipped his camera from the wall to Harris’s yellowed finger.

“We better watch the house doesn’t fall around us,” he sniffed his hand, frowning.

The TV buzzed away, the layer of dust added to the sour damp smell. Just as I was about to suggest we leave, my ears picked up another sound.

“Someone’s coming!” I hissed. Footsteps were crunching up the path. I heard a key entering the lock, we didn’t have enough time to run, we were going to have to hide.

“Scatter.”

Alvin ran first, still clutching his stupid camera. Harris didn’t move, rigid with fear. I had to drag him along by his sleeve. I heard Alvin thundering up the stairs, that idiot was going to get caught. I couldn’t even call out to him. Harris found a closet opposite the stairs; we dove inside just as the door swung open. The person lumbered in, their gait uneven. When we got our breathing under control, I cautiously opened the closet door, just enough to peer out. The closet was humid, already sweat dripped down my back, even more when she came into view.

Mrs Carroway. She was back.

“Alvin said she was gone,” Harris hissed, sounding close to tears, I nudged him to keep quiet.

I had never been this close to her. The stink of cigarettes and bacon overpowered the sour dampness. She was old, decrepit, whatever Botox she had had long faded as her face swam with wrinkles. Her cheeks dangled like the jowls of a dog. Her artificial red hair curled into a perm, dye staining her pale forehead, clashing with the lipstick staining her lips. She wore a neon purple windbreaker suit that swished with every movement. Harris gripped my arm, wetting my sleeve with his clammy hand.

Mrs Carroway ascended the stairs at a snail’s pace. Taking each step like it was a herculean effort, her red clawed hand gripped the banister, the wood creaked. Halfway up, she paused for breath, just as a thud came from upstairs. Mrs Carroway tilted her head. I motioned for Harris to hold his breath. Mrs Carroway stood still, hunched over like a hunchback. As I watched her, something flashed in her milky eyes, something that scared me. That, paired with the long pink tongue darting out to wet her lips, smearing the lipstick even more, made me think of a hungry animal.

I felt Harris’s hand slip from mine; he must have been terrified. Mrs Carroway straightened up, her back cracking like a gunshot, then, with speed that belied her age, the old woman rushed up the stairs. Stranger still, she ran up on all fours, her hands slapping the wood. I stared, mouth open, long after she ran-crawled out of sight. After a moment of silence, I poked my head out of the damp closet.

“We need to get out of here,” I hissed. Harris nodded, a quick spasm of fear. We hurried quickly and quietly back to the kitchen. The door had been locked.

“Damn it.”

Another heavy thud from upstairs made them jump,

“Shit, Alvin’s still upstairs,” Harris shivered, his golden skin iridescent with fear sweat. Harris wouldn’t last much longer without breaking down, we had to be careful if we had to get out.

“Harris, I know you’re scared but I need you to go and find another exit.”

Harris looked at me with wide eyes, looking like I just condemned him to death. I was quick to reassure him,

“You just need to be quiet, and go back through the living room. I have to find Alvin, then I’ll find you and we’ll get out of here together. Ok?”

Harris, though he trembled with fear, nodded. I patted his shoulder, ignoring the dampness of his shirt. With that, he hurried off, disappearing into the gloom. Then, it was just me. As the de facto leader, it was my responsibility to get everyone out of here, I would not fail. As I stopped at the first step, I would be lying if I said I didn’t hesitate. The old woman could be waiting just round the corner, ready to grab me, but I had to save my stupid friend. I was going to lord it over him.

The bare wooden steps were hollow, but didn’t creak, thankfully. As the landing came into view, the dim, flickering lights made it look like it was illuminated by candles. The stink of grease was at its strongest up here. The mold had spread to the upper floor. There were too many rooms, too many for Alvin to hide, and the old woman. I listened but couldn’t hear her awkward steps. A trail of yellow led its way into the bedroom, did the couple just carry buckets of grease into the bed? Something stopped me in my tracks; my feet rooted to the floor. There, in the middle of the stained floor, was a battered camera. Alvin’s camera.

I had to warn Harris, against my better judgement, I snuck back down the stairs, hissing his name. I checked the kitchen first, the yellow walls bright enough to burn my eyes. Wait, yellow. The kitchen walls shone as if covered in fresh grease. Mrs Carroway went straight upstairs. The walls, originally covered in newspaper, squished under my touch. The mold was gone, replaced with a new leathery texture. The soft, yellow texture felt clammy, like sweaty skin. I had to feel my way out of the kitchen, feeling nauseous for some reason. I ducked my head into each stinking room, but he was nowhere to be found. Maybe Harris had already escaped? I couldn’t blame him. I crossed my fingers, and headed back up the stairs. Alvin’s camera lay on the floor, untouched. 

A shuffling from the bedroom made me jump. Fabric shifted, someone getting into bed. If I was quiet and got to the others before they did anything, we could escape. Where could they be? Alvin dropped it in a hurry, it was still running.

I rewound the camera; its high-pitched whine made me look over my shoulder. The footage was just jumbled scenes at first, telling me that Alvin was running and forgot to turn off the camera. I watched it shake left and right, punctuated by Alvin’s heavy breathing. I watched him try to find a hiding place but each room he ducked into was weirder than the last. The yellow and mold were normal compared to these. The first room was dark, as the camera’s light glinted against the walls, they glistened. The walls were wet, covered in thick, dark sludge, it dripped from the ceiling in thick strands. It was like the room had been submerged underwater.

The second room was another bedroom, plastic wrap covered the furniture, even the bed. Piled high on the surfaces were rolls of stained bandages, dripping something pink onto the floor. I felt like I could smell it through the camera. Alvin’s exclamation rang out from the camera’s tinny speakers. As the camera shifted, a pair of bare feet came into view, bony and wrinkled. Just like a scene from a found footage movie, the camera swung round and Mrs Carroway’s face filled the screen. Her sunken, milky eyes glared, staring at me through the camera. With a sound like a plunger unsticking from a blocked toilet, Alvin was gone. The camera fell to the floor with a thud, the sound from earlier.

From the new crooked angle, I saw Mrs Carroway grab Alvin by the scruff of the neck, lifting him against the wall. Alvin’s face twisted in fear, his mouth opened in a silent scream, impossibly wide, until I thought the skin of his lips would split. I waited for Alvin to push the old woman away; it should’ve been so easy but Alvin didn’t move. His eyes darted frantically, twin orbs spasming in his skull. What was going on? Movement caught my eye; I peered in closer. Something about Alvin’s bare arms disturbed me. The skin seemed to be getting redder. He twisted his head, straining his neck until the tendons bulged. His body refused to follow.

With a sound like Velcro unsticking, Alvin lifted his arm.

His skin remained behind. Like a flesh-coloured sleeve, degloved, gooey like melted bubble gum. His exposed muscles twitched and pulsed, red, wet and shiny. the skin of his arms fused to the wall, slowly sinking into the plaster. Like sweaty skin stuck to a leather couch. His shed skin was gone, absorbed into the wall, and it was taking the rest of him. The wall was absorbing him. It was soft, malleable, he sank through like it was made from wet tissue. The skin was sucked from his body, stretching out to paint the wall. Pinks and reds mixed with the rotted wallpaper. The vivid colours burned my eyes. Alvin didn’t scream; he didn’t make a sound as he was painfully consumed. Swallowed up by the house.

I saw all of this through the camera. I saw Mrs Carroway run a bony hand along the quivering, pink wall, licking her lips as she did. She bent down, picked up his scattered clothes, and disappeared into her bedroom. The camera shook, almost falling from my trembling hands. What the hell did I just watch?

As I struggled to comprehend what just happened, the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I was being watched. Looking up, the camera slipped from my hands. There, staring out at me from the black void of the room was Mrs Carroway. Her head floated in the darkness like a grim spectre, her mouth spread open in a wet, toothless smile, spit dribbled as she smacked her lips. Something radiated from the woman like a stench, something that my body sensed before i realised what it was. Hunger.

She reached out, quick as a flash, bony fingers latching onto my neck. Her touch was boiling hot, searing my skin. She pulled me in close, face to slimy face, spitting as her pink tongue curled out, and ran along my face. She was tasting me. Her tongue writhed like a dying fish. Her breath was acrid, hot, my vision filled with her gnashing gums. Somehow, my panicked kicking made contact with her withered body, her grip loosened. I pushed the witch away. She collided against the wall, knocking over a table in the process. I didn’t waste the chance. I ran down the stairs, taking three at a time. I didn’t bother with the door; I just kicked out a window. The glass sliced at my skin, warm blood trickled down my arms. I didn’t care, I only cared about getting out. Finally out, I collapsed onto the soft grass, the cool night air sobering yet overwhelming my heightened senses. My body broke into violent tremors as a scream built up in my throat. It tore its way out, wrenching my throat as it did. Feeling lighter, I got up on trembling legs and ran. My gait as awkward as a newborn deer. I glanced back only once. There, at the shattered window, was the figure of Mrs Carroway, staring after me. Wide eyed, still smacking her red lips. I didn’t dare look back again.

No one believed my story, at first. They couldn’t disprove it when Harris and Alvin were declared missing. When the police finally went inside to investigate, they came running back out, spewing their guts. My parents refused to tell me anything, all they said was that Harris and Alvin could rest in peace. That didn’t comfort me. The Carroway house was soon spoken with the same reverence as Ed Gein’s house. Human flesh was found in the walls, bones in the bed and furniture. Apparently, they found Mr Carroway in one of the bedrooms, or what was left of him. I heard a rumour that his body was so deteriorated that they had to take in the whole bed as evidence. They couldn't separate him. The greasy smell made so much more sense. Mrs Carroway was taken away by the police, still smiling that dripping smile, even as she was pushed into the cop car. The adults said I hallucinated the entire thing, the house eating my friends. It took years of therapy, I came to accept that fact, but if it was a hallucination, then what the hell was on that camera?

The camera was never found.

1pdhjus,https://www.reddit.com/r/Memoir/comments/1pdhjus/from_detention_centers_to_publishing_a_book_my/,From detention centers to publishing a book — my writing process & what surprised me.,"Hi everyone,

I hope this kind of post is okay here — if not, mods please remove.

My name is Mikhail, and I recently finished writing my first memoir after spending years stateless and moving through places like American Samoa, Vietnam, Nepal, Benin, and Eastern Europe.

I’m not here to promote or sell anything — I know the rules well.
Instead, I wanted to share a bit about the experience of writing about trauma, immigration struggles, and unexpected moments of beauty, and ask for advice from this community of readers and writers.

I spent nine months stranded in American Samoa without a valid passport, survived a wrongful detention in Congo, was deported multiple times, worked in a tiny coffee shop on Martha’s Vineyard, and even found love in the most unexpected place — West Africa.

Trying to turn all of that into a coherent book has been… overwhelming, healing, and strangely clarifying. Writing forced me to relive things I thought I buried forever.

My question for you all:

For those who enjoy reading memoirs —
What makes a personal story truly resonate with you?

Is it vulnerability?
Is it humor?
Is it political context?
Is it the travel and place descriptions?
Is it the emotional arc?

I’d love to hear what pulls you into a memoir and makes you keep turning pages. I’m revising my manuscript now and your perspectives would mean a lot.

Thank you for reading — happy to answer questions about the writing process or the experience of turning real-life chaos into a story.

— Mikhail

1pdhi9o,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pdhi9o/theres_a_mirror_in_my_closet/,There’s a Mirror in my Closet,"It isn’t quite a Mirror in the traditional, reflective glass that perfectly replicates you on its surface kind of Mirror. The best way I can begin this whole thing is in the form of a question, have you found yourself in a position where things just aren’t right if you’re leaning on the right wall or trip face first in your closet, you might just land right where you were standing. At least that’s where it all started for me. I fell pretty hard on my wrist, it was swelling already and without thinking I walked straight to the fridge to grab an ice pack. I sat on the couch and rolled my wrist around trying to assess the damage before I noticed my rug. It was backwards. The design, a mountain range printed on a cheap wool I found at Goodwill, was suddenly rotated 180 degrees. Rather than the mountain peaks pointing to my feet, they now faced the TV. I live alone, who could’ve done this? Why? I was halfway through a text to my Sister before my heart stopped entirely. The Carpet was facing the wrong way sure, but my apartment was facing the entirely opposite direction. My head spun and suddenly everything around me was so unfamiliar it felt like this wasn’t even my apartment. Because it wasn’t. I sprinted back to my room desperately retracing my steps, turning the corner my wrist caught the dresser and pain shot up my wrist like static, but that was it, that’s what I missed. I had fallen straight through my closet and just kept walking, too focused on my bruising wrist to realise that I was in some weird mirrored version of my apartment.
I threw open the closet door and jumped head first into my clothes. This time I landed on my back, in my own apartment, in my own reality. I must’ve spent an hour checking every detail of my house before I was sure that I was home and safe. What just happened to me? Did that really happen? It was so short and so shocking I couldn’t process it.
Truthfully I didn’t open my closet for days, but it’s all I could think about. I replayed it in my mind over and over but no matter how bad I wanted it to be a dream, the bruises on my wrist reminded me that it must’ve happened. For days all I could think of was the foreign imitation of my apartment until one night, a few beers deep, I decided to put this to rest. I was being irrational. I didn’t drink enough water, my brain was producing too much creativity chemicals. Whatever it was, I was going to find out right now. I hesitated, opened the closet, pushed aside my clothes and for a moment I was relieved to see an empty wall. I could’ve stopped there and gone on with my night, but there was only one thing that could finally put me at ease. I lifted my arm, I guided my hand closer and closer to the wall, my fingers twitched and my hands shook like I was holding my hand out to a stray dog. I closed my eyes and braced for impact, at my arms length I opened my eyes, but my hand was no where to be found. Just the sleeve of my shirt leading right up to a plane white wallpaper. I ripped my hand back and slammed the closet door. I felt so nauseous. how could that be possible? Objects don’t just pass through other objects. Yet twice, I had done the impossible.

The only thing I could think of was to call my sister.
“Brie?”
“What time is it Kay?” She grumbled groggily
“2 O’clock” I responded feeling like I just woken my Mom up because I had a nightmare.
“Jesus Kay I have work tomorrow what do want?”
“I need you to come over”
“Fuck n-“
“Please, Brie. I’m scared”
All I heard for a moment was the sound of her fan and the rain sounds playing through a cheap speaker.
“I’ll be there in 10”

When she arrived in her pajamas, eyes half lidded and a cup of coffee in hand, everything suddenly seemed so stupid.
She walked in and brought me into her embrace. I calmed my nerves took a breath and focused myself again.

“What did you do to your wrist?”
“I’ll show you”

I took her to the closet and stood at the opposite end of the room

“Try to touch the wall behind my jackets”
“What? Why?”
“Kay did you wake me up for some dumb prank? What are you six? Are you gonna push me in and turn off the li-“
“Just do it please” I pleaded in an irritated whine
She rolled her eyes, grunted, made eye contact again and reached in.
She stumbled and fell over when she didn’t catch anything solid
I leaped forward and caught her hand. Pulling her out of the closet and falling backwards onto the carpet.
“What the fuck was that?”
She stood up and walked back into the closet.
Just as I had earlier, she slowly reached back into the closet only to find that suddenly, her hand was no longer on this side. She pulled back staring at her untouched hand, before looking up to me with a face I couldn’t read.

“How did you find this? What even is, THIS?”
“I don’t know, I walked in looking for my coat and I tripped”
“How far in did you go?”
“I fell and stood up, grabbed an ice pack and sat on the couch before I noticed”

Finishing my sentence I froze.
I still had the Ice pack.
I raced to the freezer disregarding my neighbors beneath me as I sprinted with heavy feet and weak legs to my kitchen. I tore the door open and grabbed the ice pack from the door.
The rest of my Icepacks are made by EasyCool©, with a polar bear shaped into the plastic. The ice pack from the other side, was made by FreezyBox™ with a raft of Penguins modeled on the side.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Montana Grizzlies vs. North Dakota State Bison: A Statistical Shootout with a Side of Shenanigans**

The Montana Grizzlies (4-4) and North Dakota State Bison (5-3) clash on Wednesday, December 3, 2025, in a basketball showdown that’s less “March Madness” and more “December Mayhem.” With Montana as a 3.5-point underdog on the road, the odds suggest the Bison are the favorite—but let’s not let the numbers fool us. This game is a statistical minefield where percentages, rebounds, and three-pointers could decide the victor. Let’s break it down with the precision of a point guard and the humor of a halftime comedian.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Who’s the Real Deal?

The betting lines paint a curious picture. Montana’s decimal odds hover around **1.53** (implying a **65% implied probability** of winning), while North Dakota State’s **2.50 odds** suggest a **40% chance**. That 25% gap? It’s about the same as the chance your Aunt Karen will accidentally text her ex during the game. The total line sits at **152.5 points**, meaning bookmakers expect a combined offensive explosion—though whether that’s a fireworks show or a controlled burn remains to be seen.

---

### Statistical Shenanigans: Rebounds, Shooters, and Road Struggles

**Montana’s Edge:**

* **Shooting Accuracy:** The Grizzlies are hitting **48.6% from the field**, a full **6.9% higher** than North Dakota State’s **41.7% defensive FG allowed**. If you’ve ever tried to sink a free throw after two cups of coffee, you’ll appreciate this edge.
* **Home-Court Advantage:** Montana’s 3-2 home record is nothing to sneeze at. Their **8.0 offensive rebounds per game**, led by Kenyon Aguino’s **1.9 RPG**, might not win a rebounding title, but it’s enough to keep the ball in play longer than a TikTok dance trend.

**North Dakota State’s Perks:**

* **Three-Point Threat:** The Bison average **9.1 made threes per game**, **3.0 more than Montana allows**. If they hit their usual rhythm, they’ll shoot like a rogue NBA all-star.
* **Road Redemption:** At 0-3 on the road, the Bison are about as comfortable in hostile territory as a vegan at a barbecue contest. But hey, maybe the pressure of a hostile c

Before me, my ex was married to a guy for 9 years. With several crises, comings and goings, which she justified to me ""due to communication problems and her selfishness."" According to her, for the last 4 years the ex did not pay attention to her, he did not ""touch her even with a stick"", and she felt very alone. So after those 4 years of drought and going crazy without understanding why he acted like that, she separated from him (everything seems to indicate that the ex had had a lover for years and was leading a double life).

They separate, the ex makes his parallel story public a month later and my ex hooks up with 5 lovers in a row.

She knows me, and we started a relationship that lasted a year. We fell in love a lot, but the explosions, the chronic dissatisfaction and the criticism towards me have been constant since month 4, the comings and goings, the scares, the bad mood and the emotional roller coaster that that entails, the idealization and contempt for hours... his therapist, during our relationship, diagnosed him with BPD with narcissistic traits😣 (And he sends me the clinical report and everything).

While she swears and perjures me that this has only happened with me, and never with her ex or with anyone, and that she doesn't understand it, that “not everything is in her”, (her favorite refrain), and that I should focus on what's mine because if not I will never be happy, I WAS GOING CRAZY, Literally driving me crazy.

In the last shitty argument, she started a monumental fight with me and I couldn't take it anymore. Obviously he explodes and brings out all his artillery against me in the form of very harsh disqualifications. I tell him that I don't know who he is, that I don't know what is true or false about what I experienced. So, she brings up the ex as an expert witness and says she sticks with her ex's opinion, which she says she finds “wonderful.” Obviously I don't believe him.

3 months ago she blew up all the bridges that existed between her and me, she defamed me, she got me into several important troubles but today I know absolutely nothing.

I swear I have a terrible desire to write to her ex, whom I met on several occasions (she introduced us) and we hit it off, and have a coffee with that person, who will surely have swallowed the inedible (because they had a little daughter in common), and whom I pity in her pain and uncertainty although of course I don't justify her double life.

1pdhb2u,https://i.redd.it/76adovbv525g1.png,The Ghost in The Machine,"# On Losing Your Personality and Finding the New Language

When you cross a border, you expect to change currency, climate, and clothing. You do not expect to lose your personality.

But every immigrant who moves from their native tongue to a new one experiences a subtle, devastating psychological phenomenon.

It is the moment you realize that your words no longer carry your weight.

# The 80% Filter

In your native language, you are a symphony. You are quick, witty, nuanced, and deep. Your sarcasm lands perfectly. Your anger is precise. Your affection is poetic. You can deploy five different shades of meaning in a single pause.

Then you move to the new language (English, French, etc.). Suddenly, you are reduced to the most basic 80% of your vocabulary.

You can convey facts. You can pass the test. You can order coffee. But you cannot deploy yourself.



* Your quick wit becomes silence, because the moment to deliver the joke is gone while you construct the sentence.
* Your subtle critique becomes blunt and harsh, because you lack the grammatical cushioning (the *might have been* or *could possibly suggest*).
* Your deep philosophical insight is reduced to a simple statement, because you do not know the vocabulary of abstraction.



You hear yourself speaking, and you sound like a simplified, younger, less intelligent version of the person you know you are. This is **The Ghost in the Machine.** The mind of the 100% person is trapped inside the 80% language machine.

# The Identity Amnesia

This is not a language problem; it is an identity crisis.

You begin to avoid situations that require the 100% self—deep debates, emotional confrontations, public speaking, or flirtation. You become known in your new community not as the person you are (quick, passionate, complex) but as the person the language allows you to be (polite, quiet, and literal).

You feel like a character in a bad translation: accurate, but devoid of soul.

It feels like amnesia, because you haven’t forgotten *who* you are, but you have lost the *tools* to express it. The feeling is of profound loneliness, even when surrounded by people. You are performing yourself through a tight filter.

# The True Measure of Fluency

True fluency is not defined by the government test score. It is defined by the moment you can successfully lie, flirt, or argue in the new language. These are the moments that require emotional quickness, cultural nuance, and the full deployment of your authentic self.

You have won the language battle not when you can pass a job interview, but when you can comfortably deploy your native-language sarcasm and have it land exactly as intended.

# The Rebuilding of the Self

The only way out is through. You must consciously re-build your vocabulary of emotion, humor, and depth, piece by painful piece.



* **You must accept the awkwardness.** You must allow the 80% self to make mistakes, deploy the clumsy joke, and deliver the blunt critique. The mistakes are the necessary scaffolding for the 100% self to emerge.
* **You must listen to the music, not just the words.** Stop translating word-for-word. Start listening for intent, tone, and cultural context.
* **You must be patient with the ghost.** Remind yourself every day that the person you are inside is not the person you sound like.



The journey of the immigrant is often described as leaving one place and arriving at another. But the deepest journey is the one where you lose your voice and then must undertake the painstaking, years-long process of re-growing your personality in a foreign soil.

When you finally master the language, it is more than a skill. It is the moment the Ghost is set free, and the 100% self finally occupies the machine.

when I caught you stooped and bent

hands in pockets, eyes turned inward

a falling shadow

under amber iron streetlamp

is that you dad? i ask

as you avoid my gaze

you nod, smile and shuffle by

a falling shadow

becoming oblique with time



the coffee’s hot now,

but you can’t quite keep awake

i don’t blame you,

crackling fire, blanket covered feet

muted football game on TV

just like i’d endlessly drift off

eight years old 

and desperate 

to watch the game with you

midnight milo with dad

commentators dull voices,

static glow, safe dreams



we always seem to communicate

through intermediaries

mum said this, your sister said that,

love is watered down 

wrung out

a falling fraying shadow

maybe it’s a question of medium

and yours is 

a diffuse 

crackling sort of thing

a fire lit house

yeast pastry pies

morning duplo towns

a standing presence

1pdh58p,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1pdh58p/just_went_to_my_first_aa_meeting/,Just went to my first AA meeting.,"Hey everyone,  
I posted earlier today about being super anxious about going to my first AA meeting, so I just wanted to update.

I went, and honestly, I’m really proud of myself. I’m still not completely sure if AA is exactly what I’m looking for, but the people there were incredibly kind. It was a closed meeting with about 20 people around a table, a mix of ages and genders, and the atmosphere was surprisingly warm.

When I told them it was my first meeting, they were SO welcoming, they gave me a chip, which went around the room first, and I had to stand up to receive it and someone asked if I was comfortable with a hug, which I guess I was? It felt weird and nice at the same time. Throughout the meeting, I noticed people were kind of tailoring their stories to me, I didnt know where to look! someone even said “the newcomer is the most important person in the room.” It also felt like they intentionally avoided sharing their wildest stories so they wouldn’t scare me off, or give the idea that ''well, that's not me, im not that, so I don't belong here''. Instead, they focused on the smaller, very relatable tendencies of ''taking it one step too far,'' as well as their experience during their first meeting, which honestly hit home.

I won’t lie that some of it did feel a bit culty and definitely more religious than I’m used to. The whole “higher power” stuff threw me off, and at the end we all held hands and said something together, which freaked me out a little. I also didn’t feel comfortable introducing myself with “I’m an alcoholic,” so I didn’t speak...

But overall… it was interesting. Kind of comforting, actually, to sit with people who have similar struggles and patterns. I didn’t feel judged at all. After the meeting a few people talked to me outside while I was having a cigarette, very gently, not pushy at all. Someone asked if I wanted to join the groupchat and another person immediately stepped in and not to pressure me, which I appreciated? They even gave me a little booklet.

Despite the moments that felt a bit off to me, in the grand scheme of things it was just a group of really kind people drinking tea and coffee in a tiny building in a cute town, talking about their lives. And honestly? Free therapy. Not mad about that.

Anyway, thank you to everyone on this page, I genuinely don’t think I would’ve gone without reading your posts. x",6,1764797494.0,stopdrinking,5,1.0,False

1pdh147,https://i.redd.it/p86g6mr7425g1.jpeg,Before & After,"So I stalked this thread months before & during my treatment. Everything has been great with zero issues so far. So I figured I would join finally. Go for refinement scans next week and have zero issues if I need to continue. Few tips and heads up. 

1. If you enjoy your coffee drink your coffee just black and iced. Trays in and all. Of course follow up with water.

2.Drink a-lot of water it helps fill the stomach instead of eating to avoid having to make that process a burden. Plus we could all drink more water. Gallon a day does wonders for the body. 

3. Simple. Just wear the trays. If it hurts just enough they’re doing the job & trust it. Months later you will look back grateful that you didn’t let yourself down. 

4. Appreciate the healthy habits that you are gaining from going through the process. 

5. I was never really big on the weekly pictures. I did it the first few weeks and just found myself getting discouraged. Because I wasn’t “seeing” progress. But after months I can look and really appreciate the overall change.

6. Ultrasonic cleaner with tablet. Everyday. At least once a day. Keeps them trays lookin crispy. Black coffee and all. 

7. Don’t be hard on yourself. If you have a occasion you don’t want them in. Enjoy a few hours without them. Throw an extra day onto the treatment week and move on. You’re perfectly fine. 

Peace & love everyone. If you’re thinking about it, do it.

It's easy to get stuck in that loop of thinking we need a massive, life-altering event to ""upgrade"" ourselves. We wait for the perfect moment, the right motivation, or some grand plan to fall from the sky.

But let's be real—the biggest changes often come from the smallest, most consistent actions. It’s less about a total system overhaul and more about installing a few simple software updates for your brain.

Here are a few things that have made a huge difference for me, maybe they'll help you too:

*   **The ""One Thing"" Triage.** When you wake up, before you even look at your phone, ask yourself: ""What's the *one thing* that if I do it today, will make me feel the most accomplished?"" It could be a 15-minute workout, sending that scary email, or just tidying one corner of your room. Do that thing first. The momentum it creates is insane.

*   **Schedule ""Do Nothing"" Time.** Seriously, put it in your calendar. Ten minutes to just stare out the window, listen to a song without doing anything else, or just sit. Our brains are constantly firing on all cylinders. Giving them a scheduled break isn't lazy; it's a strategic way to recharge, reduce anxiety, and actually come up with *better* ideas. It's a productivity hack disguised as a nap.

*   **Stack Your Habits.** You want to start journaling but always forget? Stack it onto a habit you already have. ""After I pour my morning coffee, I will write one sentence in my journal."" Linking a new, desired habit to an existing, automatic one is like a cheat code for your brain. It removes the 'when' and 'how' and just makes it happen.

Of course, sometimes the feeling of being stuck isn't just about a lack of good habits. It can be a deeper feeling of being overwhelmed or not knowing which direction to even point your energy. For me, that's when a bit more structure and emotional clarity is needed. I've found that having a structured plan can make a world of difference when your own thoughts are just a tangled mess. If that sounds like you, you might get a lot of value from **[this resource (affiliate link)](https://praneetbrar.com/digistore24/make-my-plan/#aff=maximizeme)**.

At the end of the day, growth isn't a destination. It's just the process of installing these tiny, positive updates, one day at a time.

I will call you names and say things that you might not be but to me you absolutely are. If you're not ready for that right now, or ever, then you shan't read this now, or ever.

Hello,

It comes very hard to me the things I'm about to say because both my mind and body, especially my mind, haven't settled in with the idea of you vanishing out of my life completely, but I don't want to leave you hoping or thinking that we can be friends after everything that's been felt or said. Despite me wanting to.

You were... more than an experience... you were my everything. Even if only for a little bit. It hurts me tremendously the choice you've made yet I do not hold anything against you and I have only good words and kind wishes to hope for you and your family's future.

It started beautifully, at least for me, and how sad it is to hope and keep wishing for something that would never begin to happen.

We've seen each other, Called each other, Laughed with each other, Liked each other, Trusted each other, Met each other, Kissed each other, Made coffee for each other, Made plans with each other, Got sad for each other, Thought about each other, And now we're broken up like two little gołąbki whom've never met each other.

Please, don't think even for one second that I liked or decided to spend my time with you because of your looks, your money or your body. These are things that, albeit you have, and people, myself included, would call you out of my league. But by courting you I would've raised myself to where your bar was, which was going to better myself objectively, not for you, but for myself. So it was always for the person that you've been and still are, which I can say I'm truly proud of and whom I loved and still love very dearly. You are amazing and words fail gloriously in its own wretched way at expressing your character's beauty.

There's not much to say... really... for me it got to that point where this is already a massive heartaching heartbreak where I need to take pauses while writing the same fragment because I break down and cry.

I've drank today, I've drank yesterday too, I've drank the day before, and I'll drink tomorrow, too.

I'm a mess, yes, I'm a fucking mess. Not just now, because of these awful news you've brought me, but in general, I'm a sad mess. You were a mess too when I've met you, when we got on call and talked... so many times... everyday... for so long... heart-wrenching things that you've told me, and I would have told you too! They meant a lot to me, and the fact you opened up and talked about all those things with me, I only hope it would've been in person, too. But perhaps that's all my dealer's served me, a short lived yet fateful 22, I look down sweating and shaking with fear and sadness in my eyes as I realize it's the next doom-laden chapter of my life and I bust going over 21. I've lost my all-in hand with everything I've worked for for so long.

I truly hope our paths' crossing was destiny-laden so I can hate this atrocious fate that has showed you in my way when, once again, when I was not in a place of peace and well being. I'd want to grab it and choke it as I stop breathing, on my slowly descend to hell, I'd look it into eyes for the last time, as I, traumatized and unable to move, wish it's demise.

If this were a page, it'd feel both unending and not enough, meaningless and more than a human can feel, overflowing with nothing else but tears, falling down due to loving to much, and not having been loved enough.

It hurts to say it's eliberating but also painful how I believe there aren't too many events that we've shared for me to cry this much, to feel this much, to break this much. Yet, it's less to swipe under the rug and forget about it, ignore it whenever it looks at me and step next to it the upcoming times I'll be having guests over.

I will be drinking, a lot, smoking, all the time, plus even more. My motivation has left me, my sporadically happy parrot died in its infinite cage due to its inability to find a soulmate with all that nothingness and space lying around crowdedly, suffocatingly and awkwardly having been misplaced around.

You are amazing, you are absolutely drop down gorgeous and breath taking, you're so pretty even your tears shine like diamonds, I'd compliment your eyes too but I fear of making it sound like a cliché and honestly I've been complimented by them more than I could ever write about them. You're tall, that's a good thing, a fucking model, a national treasure and currently a personal wealth that I've lost without ever having it. Smart and mature, yet still unable to home the depth of my feelings for you.

The kindest person I've ever met. Yes, you surpass my brother. The best cook, why does food actually taste good when made by people I love? I've never seen something more perfect in my life besides... you... an imperfectly perfect girl, woman and daughter, I'm just sad I can't see you as the mother of my children as well...

I didn't know our last hug would be... our... last... hug.... I should've never let you go to work.... I didn't know our last kiss would be our last, I wish I could remember it better. I wish I wouldn't have to delete duolingo again, I've just got 9 days on Polish and German and that fucking ""Mężczyzna"" word was finally getting  in my memory on how to write it, and I've learned verbs and a bit of grammar and pronunciation and asked some poles to help me learn and now it's all futile. I wish... things would've ended up differently... I wish it was me the one that'd get to make you happy, but I guess this is another colossal catastrophe proving I'm never enough no matter what, where I always end up losing in the end despite not doing anything wrong. Always too much or not enough...

I'm only disappointed we'll never be able to do all those things that I wish, that I dreamed of, that I lived in my mind repeatedly, endlessly, continously, over and over again, on repeat. Such things are: Taking you out on a date, Buying you flowers, Taking you to an amusement park, Watching horror movies while cuddled, Meeting your family, shaking your dad's hand firmly while mentaining eye contact as someone who's worthy of being there, winning your babunia's trust, hugging your mother and whispering her my thanks for raising such an amazing daughter, moving together, raising children with you, these are only a few. I really wanted to do everything with you, but you already did do a part of them without me; and mentioning eating kiwis together is too colloquial for my horrid soliloquy on paper written on some plastic surface with my cells' blood and sealed in tears.

If you've reached this far you're probably wondering if I changed my mind mid-writing or had I forgot to call you names, truth is, that was, while factually true, because I did call you names, kind names, pretty names, cute names, they are names! And when I said those things about yourself, I do believe with all my being that they're true and you won't have the opportunity to change my impression again.

Truth is, I love writing, and as every writer that writes with blood straight from their heart's blood vessels, I write better after omnious pivotal events happened in my life, you've finally reached the highest status of emboddyng a muse truly worth bleeding ink for. I loved you. You dum dum.

And oh God, have this not be my best and most poetry like ""letter"", I truly pity both myself and my heart for the eventuality that I get hurt worse than this in the gut wrenching future of mysery which awaits little poor me.

This morning, we went on a date to a coffee shop / botanical store. Nothing big, just casual conversation. It was so nice to just be with her (LLF) and merely exist as a couple. She even touched my leg and sat close to me (we haven't even so much as kissed in 7 months ya'll).

I dressed up in anticipation for this, with my favorite boots and leather jacket. I looked and felt good. Looking back, I'm glad we shared that hour. I hope more will come. 

The way I see it, our relationship has three outcomes: improvement, termination, or stagnation. I'm hoping for the first, because the other two terrify  me. I've been experiencing difficulty sleeping and not quite panic attacks when thinking about negative outcomes for my marriage.  

I wish years ago I was more assertive and clear about my expectations, otherwise I don't think we would be in this mess. I lost so much in my never ending compromises to her that, now I'm falling apart emotionally, neither one of us really knows how to fix me. I think she wants to send me her love, but I don't believe she knows how to speak my love language and I don't know how to read hers. This is so awkward. 

However, I'm committed to go down this road with her for as long as it takes for each of us to be seen, understood, and actively chosen. I refuse to accept that our 'now' is going to be our 'forever'. It helps that I don't have to do this alone and I've got people around me and echo chambers like this community providing some sense of solidarity and validation. 

For the community: how do you do nice things for LL partners but in a way that didn't come off as pushy, needy, or sucking up? I don't want to put my emotional welfare in her hands (that would be unfair to each of us) but I do want her to feel included, important, and loved. ",1,1764796169.0,DeadBedrooms,1,1.0,False

One Breath Prayer: You Are Deeply Loved
=======================================

Introduction: Embracing God’s Heart
-----------------------------------

Have you ever felt overwhelmed by life’s demands, battling doubts and fears that whisper you aren’t enough? It’s in these moments, when the chaos of the world seems relentless, that we need a reminder of God’s unwavering love. Introducing the One Breath Prayer: “You Are Deeply Loved.” This simple yet powerful prayer can transform your day, grounding you in the comforting truth of God’s affection for you.

The Power of a Single Breath
----------------------------

Similar to a deep breath that fills your lungs and calms your spirit, this prayer serves as a spiritual reset throughout your day. The beauty of a One Breath Prayer lies in its accessibility; you don’t need fancy words or a lengthy ritual. Just take a moment, inhale deeply, and allow the words to sink into your soul.

**Biblical Foundation:**

The conviction of God’s love is woven throughout Scripture. In Jeremiah 31:3, God says, “I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you.” This verse serves as a compelling reminder that we are cherished beyond measure, even in our darkest moments.

Practice the One Breath Prayer
------------------------------

**How to Incorporate the Prayer Into Your Day:**

1. **Morning Ritual:** Begin your day by repeating, “You are deeply loved,” as you sip your coffee or tea. Let this truth be the first thought in your mind.
2. **Mindful Moments:** During the day, take a brief pause—perhaps while waiting in line or enjoying a moment of silence. Breathe in, and affirm, “I am deeply loved.”
3. **Bedtime Reflection:** As you wind down, reflect on the day’s triumphs and trials. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and remind yourself once more, “I am deeply loved.”

### Reflection Questions:

- How does acknowledging God’s love affect your self-image?
- Where do you struggle to believe that you are loved deeply by God?

Encouragement to Overcome Doubts
--------------------------------

Our journey is often riddled with insecurities and self-doubt. Remind yourself of Romans 8:38-39, which assures us that nothing can separate us from the love of Christ. No failure, no fear, and no anxiety can diminish how God sees you.

### Personal Reflection:

Spend a few moments journaling your thoughts. What barriers are keeping you from fully embracing God’s love? In what ways can the One Breath Prayer help diminish those barriers?

The Ripple Effect of Love
-------------------------

When we embrace the truth that we are deeply loved, it not only changes our relationship with ourselves but radiates outward. As we secure our identity in God’s love, we begin to extend that love to others. Imagine the world transformed by the small act of spreading that love through kindness, compassion, and understanding.

**Biblical Encouragement:**

1 John 4:19 reminds us, “We love because He first loved us.” What a powerful chain reaction we can ignite!

### Practical Challenge:

Identify one person this week to share a message of love with—whether it’s a compliment, a note, or even sharing your own story of learning to embrace God’s love.

Conclusion: Embracing Your God-Given Worth
------------------------------------------

As you embark on this journey with the One Breath Prayer, “You Are Deeply Loved,” remember that you hold immeasurable value in God’s eyes. Allow His love to anchor you through life’s stormy seasons and illuminate your path.

### Call to Action:

I invite you to share your experiences in embracing the One Breath Prayer. How has it transformed your perspective on God’s love? Drop a comment below and let’s inspire one another on this beautiful journey of faith!

1pdgjxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1pdgjxr/planning_a_full_kitchen_renovation_in_my_old_house/,Planning a full kitchen renovation in my old house,"I live in a suburb just outside Auckland, in a 1980s split-level home we bought five years ago because it had good bones and was affordable for our growing family, me, my wife, two kids under 10, and a dog that seems to think the kitchen floor is his personal playground. The place was fine at first, but now that the kids are older and we're hosting more family gatherings, the kitchen feels like a relic from another era: cramped counters with chipped laminate, outdated oak cabinets that don't close right anymore, a tiny sink that's always overflowing during dinner prep, poor lighting that makes everything look dingy after sunset, and this weird layout where the fridge blocks the doorway to the dining room half the time. We've put up with it because life gets busy, but lately it's been driving us nuts, simple things like baking cookies with the kids turn into a chaotic mess with no space to spread out, and don't get me started on holiday meals where we're bumping elbows just to chop veggies.

Why renovate now? Well, we've saved up a bit, and with remote work letting me spend more time at home, I realize how much the kitchen sets the tone for the whole house. It's where we start our days with coffee and end them with stories around the table. Plus, property values here are climbing, so updating it could pay off if we ever sell, but honestly, it's more about making it work for us long-term without feeling like we're stuck in the past. I want to turn it into an open-concept space that flows into the living area, with a big island for homework sessions or casual meals, plenty of storage to hide all the kid clutter, better appliances like a double oven for when we actually cook instead of ordering takeout, and natural light from bigger windows or skylights to brighten things up. Imagine sleek white cabinets with soft-close drawers, quartz countertops that don't stain from spaghetti sauce spills, under-cabinet lighting for late-night snacks, and maybe even a walk-in pantry to organize all our bulk buys from Countdown—basically, functional but cozy, not some sterile showroom.

I've been researching online for inspiration, and I came across [kitchen mania](https://kitchenmania.co.nz/kitchen-renovation-auckland) which has some solid ideas on full renovations in Auckland, like using premium materials for durability and custom layouts that maximize flow in family homes. Their approach to blending style with practicality got me thinking about how to adapt similar concepts here, even if they're local. But before diving in, I need real talk from folks who've been through this.

How did you decide on your budget—did you start small and add on, or go all-in from the get-go?

What surprised you most about the demo phase, like hidden issues behind the walls or unexpected costs for plumbing reroutes?

For those with kids, how did you manage the chaos during construction? Did you eat out a lot, set up a temporary kitchen in the garage, or just tough it out?

Anyone regret skimping on certain features, like not getting that extra-deep sink or skipping the heated floors?

What's the best way to choose contractors? Go with big companies for reliability, or local guys for personal touch?

Did energy-efficient upgrades, like LED lights or better insulation, actually lower your bills noticeably?

How long did your reno take from planning to finish, and were there delays that threw everything off?

For open plans, how do you keep smells from cooking from taking over the whole house—hood vents, or something else?

What materials held up best over time, granite vs. quartz, wood floors vs. tile?

Anyone incorporate smart features like voice-activated faucets or app-controlled ovens, and were they worth it or just gimmicks?

Has the reno changed how you use your home daily, like more family time or easier entertaining?

Jessie’s breath fogged in front of her as she crouched beside her SUV’s flat tire, gloved fingers slipping on the lug wrench. Snowflakes clung to her hair, glittering in her hazard lights. Montana wilderness: undefeated.

“This is fine,” she muttered. “Just me and a frozen wheel. What could be better?”

Her first solo trip! Meant to be empowering. Healing. A chance to rewrite her story after years of letting others write it for her.

Instead: stranded on a snowy road in the dark.

Headlights approached from behind. Relief and caution tangled in her chest.
A pickup slowed. A man climbed out, late 30s, kind eyes, comfortable “real-person” confidence, snow dusting his hair.

“You look like you could use a hand,” he said.

Jessie exhaled. “Only if you enjoy heroic rescues in subzero weather.”

He chuckled. “I’m Ty.”
He crouched, loosening the stubborn lug nut with practiced ease.

“Jessie,” she said, hugging her arms, half from cold, half from nerves she didn’t expect.

“Do you do this often?” she asked.

“Fix tires? Sure. Rescue stranded adventurers? That’s more of a hobby.”

She laughed, surprised how easily it came.

He finished and stood. “There. You’re good to go.”

“Thank you,” she said and meant it.

They shared a smile that lingered a beat too long…
until he nodded politely and drove into the snowstorm.

Jessie watched his taillights fade, heart fluttering.
Ty gripped his steering wheel, annoyed he’d said so little.

Both assumed that was that.

Chapter 2 — Almost Recognition

Two days later, Jessie’s hair was curled after a spontaneous salon visit  “main character energy,” according to the stylist. Jessie hoped it was true.

As she reached for the coffee shop door, it swung open from inside.

Ty.

Her rescuer.
Different circumstances. Same soft smile that sparked something inside her.

“Sorry!” he said, stepping aside to hold the door.

Jessie waited for the moment he’d recognize her…

But he didn’t.

Different hair. Different context.
Same girl with butterflies.

“Thanks,” she whispered, walking past.

“You too,” he replied, though something inside tugged as he turned away.

Jessie watched him leave, biting back everything she wished she’d said.
Ty sat in his truck a moment, wondering why it felt like he’d just missed something important.

Sun Peak wasn’t finished with them.

Chapter 3 — Cabin Fire

Jessie’s escape to Sun Peak was supposed to spark her courage again.
Ty’s visit was supposed to rebuild his confidence after a breakup left him unsure of himself.

They both came seeking clarity.
They found… each other.

That evening, Ty took a walk by the creek behind the cabins, a small ritual to quiet the noise in his head.

He nearly walked past her cabin… until firelight drew his eyes.

Jessie stood on her porch, wrapped in a thick sweater, watching the sun bleed behind the mountains. Her hair glowed copper in the flicker of flames.

She turned, her face lit up.
“Oh! Flat tire guy!”

Ty laughed softly. “Door holder too. I do it all.”

“I didn’t think I’d see you again,” she admitted.

“I’m glad I did,” he said before he could second-guess it.

She gestured to the fire. “Come warm up. I have cocoa. I… made two… just in case.”

He stepped up, touched the mug she offered.
Their fingers grazed.
A spark. The kind they both felt, leapt silently between them.

“So… third time’s the charm?” she asked.

Ty smiled. “Seems to be.”

They stood close... Close enough for a kiss to begin…

But they held still.
Letting the moment breathe.

Chapter 4 — Bravery in Small Steps

A thunderous crack outside broke the quiet! A tree giving in to the storm.
Jessie flinched. Ty steadied her without thinking.

“You’re safe,” he murmured.

Something in Jessie softened. He followed her inside, fire crackling stronger than the wind outside.

They sat together, knees brushing.
Jessie confessed, voice barely above the flames:

“I came here to start a braver chapter.”

Ty looked at her like he could already see it.
“You seem brave to me.”

She shook her head gently. “Not until tonight.”

He smiled, small, sincere. “I get it. I came here to remember who I was. Before I got small for someone else.”

Jessie covered his hand with hers.
“Then maybe we can help each other grow again.”

She leaned in...slow, tentative, hopeful.

Their lips met.
Soft. Warm.
A promise disguised as a kiss.

Chapter 5 — Sparks & Stormlight

The power flickered, then went out.
Nothing but firelight and heartbeats.

Jessie bit her lip, tone playful again.
“Looks like you’re stuck here.”

Ty chuckled. “Good. Would be awkward if I left right after that kiss.”

Jessie laughed, flirty and relieved and wanting more.

Under a blanket, they leaned into each other.
Hands found hands.
Eyes found courage.

“You know what?” Jessie whispered, brushing her nose against his, “my flat tire was totally worth it.”

Ty pressed his forehead to hers.
“Best tire trouble I’ve ever encountered.”

The storm roared.
They grew closer.

Chapter 6 — The Bedroom Hearth

There was a second fireplace in the bedroom, Jessie mentioned — casually, though hope shimmered in her eyes.

Ty offered to start it. She kissed him, a quick encouragement, before he stepped out to the porch for firewood, the wind biting at him like impatience.

When he returned, Jessie was kneeling by the hearth, arranging kindling.
“You’re making this teamwork thing very tempting,” he said playfully.

She grinned. “Just following expert internet tutorials.”

The fire sparked to life.
They settled together beneath a quilt, warmth growing in every way that mattered.

The rest unfolded gently, privately,
a night of soft kisses, shared breath, tangled comfort…
the kind of intimacy the heart remembers more than the world ever needs to know.

Fade to snow.
Fade to firelight.

Chapter 7 — Morning Light

Ty woke to Jessie curled against him... Like she belonged there.

Her sleepy smile melted whatever doubt he had left.
“Morning,” she whispered.

“You stayed,” Ty said quietly… almost in awe.

Jessie tucked hair behind her ear, blush rising.
“I didn’t want to run away from a good thing.”

Coffee plans turned into laughter and pancake batter kisses in the kitchen, warmth growing between them like a second sunrise.

Jessie said it first:
“I think I’d like to see what happens next… with you.”

Ty’s heart, usually cautious, answered immediately:
“So would I.”

Chapter 8 — The Overlook

Sun Peak glistened with fresh snow. Jessie and Ty walked through town hand in hand, exploring the little shops like a shared secret.

Then, the overlook trail.
A climb.
A moment to breathe.

The valley stretched beneath them. Mountains standing proud as guardians of possibility.

Jessie leaned into him.
“I came here to figure out where to go next,” she said softly.

“And now?” he asked.

She smiled, brave at last.
“I think I can take my time deciding.”

Ty squeezed her hand. “No expectations. Just… us.”

Wind carried their laughter. The world waited below.

Not fate. Not forever.
Just enough.

Enough to hold hands.
Enough to want tomorrow.
Enough to keep walking, together.

As the flair indicates, unfortunately I lost my grandpa to kidney cancer about a year ago, maybe? It feels like he passed yesterday. He was sick with cancer since I was a child, growing up I obviously didn’t realize what was happening to him. 
As I got older, he got sicker. And kept saying things in passing like, “one day you’re gonna be on that show” referring to a singing show or “when I pass” I want you to do etc. My grandpa was very headstrong? Not sure if that’s the right saying/meaning, but he always downplayed how bad things really were so he could keep a brave face for everybody in the house(mostly us kids).

At some point I moved out of my grandparents house to stay with my dad, unfortunately while I was with my dad, my grandpa’s condition got worse, and he was in and out of the hospital for days before he passed. 

My father was there growing up, but wasn’t actually a father. He didn’t support me emotionally or financially. A lot of things i’ve learned was from my grandpa, he was very creative and would pull all the wires out of something to try and fix it before getting a new one. All of my “life lessons” and experiences came from my grandpa. My grandpa was my motivation to graduate, so he could see me walk across the stage after the journey I’ve been on, I knew he was sick, but didn’t understand how sick he was. 

My mind keeps going back to the day I found out he passed, I keep thinking and remembering how it felt to see his coffee cup where it always was, or the meds he took every night, his blanket on the couch, how pale and weak he was, he fell down multiple times before he passed and wouldn’t let anyone help him. 
My mind keeps going back to that night, when my grandma came home late. No one knew he had passed, and I found out from another side of family, that wasn’t even close with my grandpa. 

Every time I think about this, I think about the pain I felt in my heart, how I never got pictures with him, what I should’ve or could’ve done. I never got to see him before he passed,he signed a DNR the last time he went into the hospital. I can’t understand this, why he would sign a DNR but life is life I guess. 

Sooo moral of the story, how do you not let your grief consume your everyday life? I know it’s different for everybody, I thought I was doing okay. But I just wanna stay in bed and go back to how I was when I found out about it. maybe even before I found out. ",2,1764795961.0,cancergrief,0,1.0,False

Yesterday was his birthday. We both took time off work and I had been asking him what he wanted to do for his birthday the last few weeks and I kept getting responded with “nothing really”. Well the day came, I woke up first as always, waiting a few hours and went out and got his favorite coffee and breakfast and put it all together to serve him breakfast in bed. He woke up, saw it and seemed very happy. He opened the presents I got him and I ask him what he wants to do (mind you it’s almost noon now) and he said “nothing really, just relax here for the day”. I was like okay cool, what do you want to do? And he beats around the bush and says he’s going to go shower. Well after that I’m asking him and he’s beating around the bush so I was like are you wanting to game or watch tv? He said he wanted to game. I was like okay and thought maybe he’d want to do it with me but instead he just hops on his PC and plays by himself. I sat around by myself, log into my work computer for about an hour and make calls thinking he’d hear and come to my office asking why I’m working, since it’s PTO for both us. But nothing. I sat by myself in my room and just broke down crying. He literally just wanted a day completely to himself, and not have me around. Am I over reacting for being hurt by that? I get this is how it’d be if I was working and only he took PTO, that’d be fine and understandable. But idk, this just doesn’t feel right. We haven’t been in a good place for quite a while which is why I was happy we both took PTO and thought we could go out for the day and have fun, but he wanted to stay home. Then I thought we’d have a cute time at home together doing whatever and having a great day, but we didn’t. We’ve been in a not great place for quite a while, feeling separated and like roommates, so this just made me feel 10x worse.",14,1764795897.0,AITAH,73,0.85,False

Spkrs must be small,"I find myself in a interesting situation due to the size of the TV cupboard and the layout of the living room I am not able to buy regular sized bookshelf speakers (think 1280BTs) because they don't fit anywhere, these would be used for TV and a little bit of music, not a huge audiophile though.

And due to my budget ($200CAD), I'm left with four options:
- use my existing Logitech Z506 in a 2.1 fashion and don't use the surround speakers (I will put The satellite speakers one on the windowsill and the other one on the coffee table, and use my BT adapter to connect so it's out of sight, there's a perfect little space behind the couch that will fit most subs)
- get a 2.1 soundbar and stick it in the same spot as mentioned before, behind the couch. 
- buy passive compact bookshelf speakers off Facebook marketplace and I can put one on the windowsill and the other one on a small coffee table beside the couch. And then whenever I get some time I can get a sub to pair with it. All of these would connect to a Bluetooth amp. Haven't done too much research however if I buy something that is older and has been reviewed well for example the realistic minimus, or JBL G40 and pair it with a Fosi BT amp that would be what I'm aiming for

Because I am very new to the audio file/hifi world, I am quite familiar with sound bars but not at all with passive bookshelf speakers with amplifiers. My assumption is that if I do get the realistic minimus and pair it with a Bluetooth amp that would sound the best but I don't want to make that assumption, would I be correct?",0,1764795826.0,BudgetAudiophile,1,0.5,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Georgia Southern Eagles vs. Louisiana Tech Bulldogs: A Statistical Soirée with a Side of Sarcasm**

**Parse the Odds: A Numbers Game**  
The betting world has thrown its weight behind the Georgia Southern Eagles, who are favored by 2.5 points across most books (though some wags at FanDuel tried -2.0, probably still bitter about last year’s coffee spill incident). Decimal odds for Georgia Southern range from **1.71 to 1.77**, translating to an implied probability of **55-58%** to win. Louisiana Tech, the underdog, sits at **2.1 to 2.15**, implying a **32-47%** chance—depending on which bookie you ask and whether they’ve had their coffee.

The total points line is a chaotic dance between **145.5 and 147.5**, with most books settling at **146.5**. The Over/Under odds are almost even, hovering around **-110 for both sides**, suggesting bookmakers expect a high-scoring affair. For context, if this game were a buffet, it’d be the all-you-can-eat shrimp skewer section.

**Digest the News: Injuries, Updates, and Mascot Drama**  
No major injuries or scandals have marred this matchup. Louisiana Tech’s star point guard isn’t in a cast (yet), and Georgia Southern’s leading scorer hasn’t suddenly decided to pursue a career in interpretive dance. The most exciting update? Louisiana Tech’s mascot, the Bulldog, might finally learn to stop barking at the Eagles’ mascot, who’s just doing its job of squaw

Tech & Robotics pro seeking a life partner (26-34) for travel, pho, and a future family.","**The Intro** Hey there! I'm a 35 y.o. New Jersey native working in the tech industry, specifically in **automation and robotics**. Think of me as the guy helping build the future, less ""Terminator"" doom-and-gloom, and more ""making the world run smoother"".

I’m here with intention. I am looking for a genuine connection that could blossom into a long-term partnership and marriage. I’m dating with purpose, searching for my person, and I’m ready to build a family when the time is right.

To give you a better peek inside my brain, here are a few things about me:

**My Passport (Is barely cooling down!)** I actually just landed back home from Puerto Rico on December 1st! I prioritize seeing the world and I’m looking for my co-pilot. Here is where I've been lately:

* **Oct 2025:** A massive trip through Spain, Portugal, Andorra, and the South of France.
* **Oct 2024:** Pedaling through the Netherlands, chasing waterfalls in Croatia, and exploring Budapest, Hungary.
* **Nov 2023:** Experiencing the UAE.
* **2022:** Exploring the wilds of Alaska and the mountains of Austria (Gesäuse is still where my heart does a happy dance).

**My Current Goal** Achieving financial freedom. I’m working hard now so I can retire early and swap the tech life for spontaneous road trips, volunteer work, and maybe a tiny house near the mountains. (Also, finally mastering headstands in yoga—priorities, right?)

**If I could only eat one food for the rest of time...** It would be Vietnamese Pho, Japanese Ramen, or Curry. They are hearty, flavorful, and impossible to get bored of. Bonus points if we are eating it at a street stall in Hanoi while plotting the next day’s adventures.

**I spend a lot of time thinking about...** Retirement… but the fun kind! Picture this: You and me hiking Austrian alpine trails at 10 AM on a Tuesday, volunteering at animal shelters, and slow-traveling through Southeast Asia with backpacks and zero emails. Until then, I’m optimizing my budget and plotting our escape routes from the 9 to 5.

**On a typical Friday night I am...** Either curled up with a great single-player game (*Red Dead Redemption II*, *Ghost of Tsushima*) and a bowl of snacks, or at a cozy wine bar dissecting the meaning of life with friends. The ideal relationship would have a mix of both—I’m just as excited about a spontaneous road trip as I am about a cozy Netflix marathon (currently accepting applications for ""Stranger Things S05 or Dark (rewatch)"" viewing buddies).

**Who I'm Looking For (Is this you?)** I’m specifically looking for a partner **aged 26 - 34** who is ready to swap travel stories over coffee, debate the best national parks, or geek out over the latest tech innovations.

* You are ready to settle down, be a priority, and build something truly special together.
* You can dive deep into meaningful conversations but aren't afraid to get ridiculously silly.
* You have your own amazing passions and dreams that you're excited to share.

**You should message me if...** You are looking for a future husband, not just a text buddy. If you want to skip the small talk and share your weirdest life philosophies (or teach me a yoga pose I haven't face-planted on yet), I want to hear from you. I would love to see your pictures. I have shared mine below.

Let's break the ice! **What's your go-to karaoke song?** Mine might reveal my questionable taste in music, but I'm willing to spill if you are!

1pdgas5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amazontly/comments/1pdgas5/which_flameless_candles_should_i_choose_for_my/,Which flameless candles should I choose for my living room?,"Looking to add some cozy ambiance to your living room without worrying about open flames? Flameless candles might be exactly what you need.

These battery-powered alternatives give you that warm, flickering glow without any of the safety concerns. No more worrying about pets knocking them over, kids getting too close, or forgetting to blow them out before bed.

**What Makes Good Flameless Candles?**

The best options use LED lights that actually flicker like real candles. You want ones that look realistic, not like cheap plastic toys sitting on your coffee table. Pay attention to the wax material too – real wax exteriors look way better than plastic ones.

Size matters when decorating your living room. Pillar candles work great on mantels and side tables. Taper candles fit nicely in candle holders you might already own. Votives are perfect for creating clusters on coffee tables or bookshelves.

**Features Worth Having**

Timer functions are super convenient. Set them to turn on automatically when it gets dark, and they'll shut off after a few hours. This saves battery life and means you don't have to remember to turn them off every night.

Remote controls let you switch multiple candles on and off from your couch. Some even let you adjust the brightness or change the flicker speed.

Battery life varies a lot between different models. Quality candles with good batteries can last months on a single set of batteries if you use the timer feature.

**Finding the Right Style**

Think about your living room's vibe. Traditional ivory or cream candles work with almost any decor style. If you have a modern space, consider sleek black or white options. Some even come in fun colors for seasonal decorating.

The color of the light matters too. Warm amber or yellow light creates that classic candle feel. Some cheaper options have bluish LED lights that look fake and cold.

**Where to Start Shopping**

You can find quality options at different price points. [Check out this selection of flameless candles](https://athomewave.com/flameless-candles) to see what's available and compare different styles and features.

Sets usually offer better value than buying individual candles. A three-pack gives you enough to create a nice display without breaking the bank. Plus, having matching candles creates a more pulled-together look in your space.

**Quick Tips**

- Measure your space before buying to make sure the candle size works
- Read reviews about how realistic the flame looks
- Check what type of batteries they use (standard AAs are easier to replace than button batteries)
- Look for options with replaceable bulbs so they last longer

The bottom line: flameless candles give you all the atmosphere of traditional candles without the hassle or safety risks. They're perfect for homes with kids, pets, or anyone who wants to enjoy candlelight every day without the constant maintenance.

However, it has coffee stained and darkened my entire model even though I didn’t feel like I put it on thick? I used the -soft tone- wash. I’ve attached some images.

Picked up a mummy bag. Got some new long johns and some ski gloves. Replaced my shoes that were completely shot. Replaced my tent a couple months ago when a zipper failed. Got a stack of hand warmers.
Also have a good spot to camp, and a decent spot to fly. 

Lots of mornings around 20 degrees here in NOVA. Highs in the low 40s. So far I've been pretty toasty.

Just kinda homebumming it for the winter.

The good pizza place found out I was homeless and have been cool as fuck. Had me trace the buildings electrical system to figure out why their signs weren't working. Always offering to let me leave my stuff to charge. Just cool people. And phenomenal pizza slices for $5. You guys know my infatuation with pizza.

The locals recognize me now. People have been really friendly. It's slow flying, and not a lot of money, but it gets me what I need. People have been giving me bum bags, a coat, gift cards for food, bringing me food and water... you know, the usual.

So...

Wake up. It's four am. 'This getting older and not sleeping as much is for the birds.' 😆 Smoke. Get stoned. Stare at my phone until I fall back asleep.

Back awake a couple hours later. Another smoke. Halfway out of sleeping bag. Hair combed. Chargeables, sign, headphones, etc. in small backpack I bought for edc. No sense hauling my 55L pack around if I don't have to.

Out of tent. Gear up. Gloves and hoods on. (Standard issue homeless hoody/coat combo.) Out of camp. Down trail. Sneaky short cut. Off to sheetz.

Stuff charging. Coffee. Out to smoke. Back in. Chill for a bit. Breakfast bagel. More chillin' and chargin'. Out to fly, or back to camp.

Lately there's been some dudes trying to snake my flying spot. They drive in from out of town. Normaly if I see someone in my spot I let it go. Sharing is caring right? And I've seen a few travelers come through. It's policy to let other travelers make some money.

These guys are known by another homeless dude here. Douchebags. Just trying to snag other people's spots. Not cool.

I've got zero issues telling someone to get fuck off my spot, but so far have just gotten up earlier to beat them out there. One dude got snaked by me. The other went down to get in front of me. People told me all day they weren't giving those guys shit, while handing me money.

Haven't seen them since.

Back to sheetz to top off my stuff. Download some movies. Over to the pizza place. Ten bucks for a couple slices. Box in hand, off to camp.

(Got some Pho last night. Delicious!)

Eat. Catch a buzz. Smoke a cigarette. Kick a movie on. Wake up at four am.

Wash, rinse repeat...

* Use Spring water instead of my Brita filtered water



I did all of this and i can start to taste a little bit of the flavor notes but the aroma isn't there and really the flavor is lacking.  

Now chatGPT is telling me to try 14 clicks. (i'll see how that goes tomorrow)

i've brewed 5 cups now and can't get it right. 

I'm just wondering if there's anything chatGPT and I might be missing. 

  
i've only had my AP for a couple months. Don't usually measure things out, just eyeball it and go and i get decent coffee from most dark roasts iv'e tried. 

  
TIA yall

I used to smoke ciggerates and vape all the time but stopped because I learnt addictions are a sin. But have really strong cravings right now.

It’s been three weeks since I quite nicotine, am I allowed to start it again? as long as I don’t have the device in my mouth 24/7?

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Eastern Kentucky Colonels vs. Illinois State Redbirds: A David vs. Goliath Spectacle with a Side of Sarcasm**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of titans… if by “titans” you mean a 15-point underdog with +900 odds (yes, *nine* zeros) trying to pull off a miracle while the favorite looks like a college basketball version of Thanos snapping its fingers. Let’s break this down with the precision of a stathead and the wit of a late-night host who’s had one too many coffee-fueled rants.

---

### The Odds: A Mathematical Masterclass

First, the numbers. Illinois State (-15) is a *monster*. At DraftKings, they’re priced at **1.06**, implying a **95% chance to win**. Eastern Kentucky (+9.0) has a 9.5% implied probability—about the same odds as me correctly predicting the outcome of a coin flip while blindfolded and juggling flaming torches. The spread? Illinois State is favored by **14.5 to 15.5 points**, which feels less like a basketball game and more like a math test where the answer is “obviously 42.” The total is set at **153 points**, so if you’re betting on the Over, you’re banking on Illinois State scoring like it’s Black Friday at the NBA’s holiday sale.

### The News: Injuries, Momentum, and Metaphors

Illinois State enters this matchup as a program on a tear. They’ve beaten teams like No. 21 Kansas and No. 14 Illinois, and their NET ranking is higher than my self-esteem after a long week of bracketology. No major injuries are reported, which is surprising because their offense looks so dominant, I half-expect them to start passing the ball to the referee just for fun.

Eastern Kentucky? Well, they’re the team that’s basically the “Also Ran” section of the NCAA’s press release. Their only saving grace? A +9.0 moneyline that mak

Thanks for the creativity. I am sharing this on Medium, behind enemy lines.

We have all heard these. Let's just re-index. And if you have more, please do share. 

# 1- “It’s a business decision. It’s not personal.”

* **Literal meaning**: This choice is driven by business logic, and not petty emotions.
* **Real meaning:** It IS personal; I don’t like you. But since I am too much of a coward to own my emotions, I am going to frame this petty decision into an acceptable narrative to justify to myself and HR that I am not actually evil.

# 2- “No margin, no mission.”

* **Literal Meaning:** Without profit, we can’t go on.
* **Real Meaning:** We are about to cut something you like: Pay, Support, Coffee, toilet paper, plastic cups, some people- And we want to blame you and the numbers for it. If you had worked better, we would not be in this situation, but we are kind enough not to blame you directly.

# 3- “Headwinds.”

* **Literal Meaning:** External conditions are tough.
* **Real Meaning:** We ignored every single warning about this for two years up until now. Now that shit has hit the fan, we are going to blame the tooth fairy for our own overinflated ego and naïveté.

# 4- “It’s not downsizing, it’s rightsizing.”

* **Literal Meaning:** We’re resizing the company to the right level.
* **Real Meaning:** We like gaslighting ourselves. We made huge mistakes in budgeting and strategy, then hired a McKinsey consultant in order to come up with a fancy phrase to justify letting people go. The saved money from firing people might just cover the consulting fee.

# 5- “Change is good.”

* **Literal meaning:** Change creates new situations. maybe beneficial.
* **Real meaning:** You are being restructured for the 7th time this quarter. Your team is broken apart, your role is unstable, and you should set your LinkedIn profile to “Open to Work.”

# 6- “We’re doing a culture reset.”

* **Literal meaning:** We’re improving our culture.
* **Real meaning:** We’re getting rid of some people we don’t like, but we do not have the balls to call it that; so we are using fancy words like culture to sound not evil.

# 7- “Doing more with less.”

* **Literal meaning:** We need to be more efficient with less waste.
* **Real meaning:** We are going to let 50% of the company go. Those who stay now have to work twice as much, always be available, and say goodbye to any work outside this stupid building. You are welcome.

# 8- “Cost containment.”

* **Literal meaning:** We have to control the budget.
* **Real meaning:** Your salary, your team, your tools, your perks - these are the “costs” that we are going to cut. Leadership compensation, offsites, fancy lunches, and those colorful HR shits on every wall are just “strategic investment.”

# 9- “Our employees are our greatest asset.”

* **Literal meaning:** Our people matter most.
* **Real meaning:** We’re about to treat “our greatest asset” like a disposable line item. But we’re saying this now to have it in the bank, so the press release does not make us sound like the insufferable assholes you know we are - and we know we are.

# 10- “We need to optimize workflow.”

* **Literal meaning:** We want to improve processes.
* **Real meaning:** We’re going to remove steps, people, safety checks, QA, payment processing, testing, customer support, etc. And then act surprised later when everything breaks.",7,1764795204.0,OfficePolitics,0,1.0,False

I was especially curious because they offer single-origin beans from their family farm in Chikmagalur.
As someone who has grown up drinking South Indian filter coffee and has spent years trying to find anything in the US that tastes like the filter coffee you get on the streets of Bangalore. 
I’ve struggled a lot. I’ve tried Narasu’s, Kothas, even Panduranga Coffee Works straight from Chikmagalur, but nothing came close.
Le Mil’s changed that for me.
They roast locally in Berkeley and even use Indian chicory in their filter coffee blend, so I decided to give it a shot. And honestly, I’ve never been this impressed. Their chicory blend tastes almost exactly like the real thing. I don’t know how they nailed it because this is not easy but they did. 
I think I seriously underestimated how much of a difference fresh roasting in the US makes.

After reading so many Reddit negative stories of folks getting shafted by their managers and companies in general, I wanted to present the other end of the spectrum - when things work out. With luck, my story gives people some cheer and hope to those who are struggling with their present situation. I have been forced to express my gratitude for its own sake, because in my belief, feeling and expressing it makes you a better person.

My previous organization was a sector behemoth - on paper, making all the right noises and labels of Great Place to Work accorded every year. And to some extent, it was the case as well. But I was hired at the insistence of department heads who prevailed over my boss so that there could be redundancies built into the team. He is a workaholic and a terrible delegator of work. I was supposed to take work off his plate, instead he put me in mind numbing, repetitive data cleaning and reporting tasks right from the beginning. At first, I went along with it believing that this will give me a good sense of business and will set me up for a bigger role 6 months down the line. But that never happened. I was forced to keep at it for even longer than that, despite raising concerns and pushing back. All the while, this guy would humiliate me repeatedly-saying things that I still have not had the heart to tell my wife or even my closest friends. He never raised his voice, but the vitriol and nastiness spewed was always more than enough to make up for it. He never wanted me in the team and had in his twisted way started laying the groundwork to force me to quit or fire one way or another.

Once I decided I had enough and needed to move out, thankfully a new opportunity came along. I was well aware of the stellar reputation of the hiring manager within the industry. So, I accepted the offer, served the notice period and joined the new company.

And let me tell you guys - it's been a dream and a song since then. I can write peans about my manager. One of the most soft spoken, down-to-earth person you can come across. He is extremely sharp and immensely knowledgeable. He doesn't belittle anyone, infinitely patient, and happy to roll his sleeves and get his hands dirty on a daily basis. He works like a horse, but never shows off the long hours he puts in. Just silently chugs along and inspires everyone around him to do better and work harder everyday. His conduct is the personification of pure class. His reputation within the industry is well deserved.

There is just so much to learn under him that even if I get less money in subsequent year's appraisals and increments, it would be the least of my concerns. The bigger issue would be that I am not up to the mark in his eyes, or that I disappoint him with my work.
Circling back to the beginning of this post - what really made me write my first Reddit post is the realization that this man has not bothered me with a single call or expectation of finishing any tasks till now. Lord knows there is enough work for our team right now. In fact, when I told him that I can work on a particular task, he shut it down stating that I should enjoy family time and leave it to him and the team.

Yeah - He is the kind of guy I would take a proverbial bullet for any day.",3,1764795123.0,talesfromthejob,0,1.0,False
1pdg4ew,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/comments/1pdg4ew/sleep_pyramid_theory/,Sleep Pyramid Theory,"I feel like there’s so much discussion and debate here on what actually helps sleep and what doesn’t. I my opinion, you can combine all of this into a pyramid, where you first need to satisfy the bottom most level before worrying about the next. 

I haven’t created this but if I did, at the very bottom would be things that ACTUALLY ARE KNOWN TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT SLEEP, no debate.These are well studied and established, such as:
- drugs (alcohol, weed)
- coffee (caffeine)
- nicotine 

Maybe on the same tier or right above it, is anxiety and stress regarding sleep. At the end of the day, no matter what you do, if you are anxious or stressed you WILL NOT fall asleep. You can be anxious and not even be consciously aware that what you’re feeling is anxiety. 

After that would be sleep hygiene that are scientifically proven to affect sleep, such as:
- eating a super heavy meal right before bed
- improper breathing 
- getting sufficient physical activity during the day
- waking up and going to bed roughly around the same time 
 

Now at the very tippy tippy top of the pyramid  would be all the pseudoscience (bs) I see all over this subreddit. All of these things, the best sleepers in your life that you know, they do or do not do all of these and it has absolutely no affect on them. Here they are listed off the top of my head:
- blue light before bed (has no real affect, they only say this bc scrolling before bed can make you anxious)
- taking magnesium and drinking tea or whatever herbal supplement you wanna insert here

Basically what I’m trying to say with all of this is that you shouldn’t be majoring in the minors. Worry about the things at the bottom of the pyramid before spending a bunch of money on sleeping supplements and eye masks and anything else you see. 

Also please remember, if you don’t sleep well, it’s OKAY, nothing will happen to you, you will survive, nobody will probably even notice. This is important to remember because when you start freaking out over sleep, that just contributes to your anxiety which is at the bottom of the pyramid and very important for sleep.

She's always had ups and downs in her mental health since we met in 2011. A lot of it stems from body image and abandonment issues. There's so much to unpack here, but I'll save the details and focus on today's issue.

A couple of weeks ago, she finally opened up to me about having thoughts of self-harm because she ""hates herself"". She's always been hesitant to talking to a therapist, but she agreed to do it. Her first appointment is next week. 

Today, she texted me saying she's excited to start therapy because she feels like the self-hatred has completely consumed her. She feels like she's an awful wife, mother, sister, teacher, friend, etc. 

I'm hopeful that a lot of progress will be made as she starts therapy, but I want to do everything I can to continue helping her at home. Here's some things I do now to help:

* Telling her how much I love her often.
* Always complimenting her outfits, makeup, the ways she looks, etc.
* Explaining to her how good of a mother she is, focusing on the way our kids adore her.
* Encouraging her to find ways to be active. Going for a quiet walk at the end of the day, family hikes, going to the park, kayaking, etc. She hates being active honestly, this has been a huge uphill battle. Her body limits her activity, so she doesn't want to be active, so she sits around a lot. It feels like a vicious cycle and we can't break it. I'm not in the best shape either, but I tell her often how much an easy walk can change your mood for the better.
* I encourage her to take time for herself when she's overwhelmed.
* Brining her small gifts, or her favorite coffee as a surprise. Random flowers. Etc.

I don't want this to feel like a bragging session, but I'm just running out of ideas to support her and encourage her mental health.",1,1764795097.0,depression,0,1.0,False

-Daytime urination: Coffee remains an irritant to my bladder. Even one morning cup is just enough to escalate frequency all day. I'm beginning to wonder if this wasn't also the situation before the procedure, and I just didn't recognize it. Only drinking filtered water however and it's like being in my 20s again...

1pdg2uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1pdg2uw/aio_debating_whether_to_review_this_airbnb_host/,"AIO? Debating whether to review this Airbnb host, but I f*cked up bad too","I don't like to leave bad reviews because it screws with people's livelihoods, but in this situation I feel I have a duty to warn other guests about this person. If I do write the review, it would be without emotion to the best of my ability, leaving only factual issues. Here in this post I'll ~~probably~~ get a bit more colorful and extensive. We definitely feel scammed and frustrated out of our minds. AIO? At this moment I don't want to leave the review and cause more animosity, I'd rather leave things where they are and not open an avenue to more issues later on. But again... this lady is not someone I think people should be renting from!

The very first huge red flag was only a week or two into the stay. She wouldn't message us on the platform, instead texting me directly. I asked her many times to be sure she included both my spouse and I in texts and she never did. I even created the group myself and would message her on there, but without fail she would only text me. The red flag came when she asked me if we'd like to take our stay off of Airbnb and do a direct lease through the owner. We were immediately suspicious, why would I remove the protections of the platform?? She assured us that both sides would end up saving significant money so my spouse agreed to at least hear a quote. Two days later she says the owner has come up with an amount - it was the exact same amount we were paying on Airbnb. We were offended they would think we're that stupid. Even if we were interested, you told us you would save us money by forgoing Airbnb policies and protections only to come back with absolutely 0 change for us and only benefitting her and the owner. From this moment on we were very hesitant in our business dealings with them, had lost a significant amount of trust, and tried to just move on like it didn't happen.

I have stayed in two long-term Airbnbs and about 5 other short stays. Outside of that I have moved 8 times with regular rental homes. This stay in question was for 9 months and never in my life have I had such an invasive landlord. Every few weeks she'd say ""hey are you home, I need xyz."" To get something from her storage in the garage, totally understandable. To turn off the sprinklers, understandable but even she admitted she could have had me do it. She asked me to give her the keurig in our unit since we had a drip pot and her other unit suddenly didn't have a coffee maker. Then it was to ask me to come to her unit next door to see if I smelled whatever her last tenant complained about. She even asked if she could enter while we were on vacation to take away the air fryer and give it to another tenant. I told her no, we are not home and my dog is there. She resolved to have me get my dog sitter to leave it on the porch. I don't need an air fryer, but there were a couple times after that I wished I still had it.

On top of losing two appliances and being at her beck and call, this unit had a shared yard. Before moving in we confirmed that our dog would be able to use the yard. A month or two after move in she told us her new tenant had some issue with dogs and we wouldn't be able to use it during her stay. Once I saw that tenant move out I started using the yard again. Then she had a stay with an elderly person and she asked us not to use the yard since my dog is excitable. Frustrating, but understandable. Another time it was because her new tenant had SIX chihuahuas? Then another tenant with two scared dogs. There were more but honestly I don't remember them all. Between these times she wouldn't tell me when tenants left and I had yard use again, so I started guessing but over time I lost track of whether we were allowed to use the yard or not. I brought it up with her at some point about it not being fair to my dog, she said ""you can just take him on a walk or something."" True, but a huge reason we chose this place is because it was one of the few with a grass back yard. The whole point was to let my dog out, we wouldn't have chosen this place if we knew his access would be restricted so regularly. In addition to that, we were her long term tenants - why did we always have to be the ones to be restricted? Just because I didn't push back after it happened a couple times she figured it's fine? It's not, I just don't want to be entitled or mean.

Partway through our visit my dog had an accident which resulted in an outpatient surgical procedure and had him on bedrest as much as possible. The vet told us to keep him off cement, no walks, no extensive play. I explained to my landlord that I could not take my dog on walks for a while and we were still not allowed to use the yard, she would not budge and didn't seem to understand the medical severity of his situation. I had to have a solution so my dog can pee. **This is where I fucked up**, I fully admit. My solution during my dog's bedrest was to have an indoor potty pad. After explaining and not having her understand, it's the only solution I could think of where my dog could still pee without having to walk on cement - the was no grass around the property except for other people's front yards and even if I thought that was a good idea, we'd have to walk 1000 feet on cement and asphalt just to get there. The grass backyard would have been perfect but we weren't allowed to use it, I had to do something.

My dog is mat trained and knew exactly what to do. Once his four weeks of rest were done, we still weren't allowed to use the yard -and- my dog had gotten accustomed to being allowed to pee there. I took him out regularly once I could take him on walks again, but I always kept a mat in that spot so if he did decide to go it wouldn't soak into the floor. If he had to pee overnight for example, I would clean it as soon as I woke up in the morning BUT, due to the poor construction of the home *(a whole issue that's not fully relevant, but the foundation is leaning, doors get stuck, baseboards have gaps, the works. The home isn't even two years old)* we found out that the floor in that spot is not level at all. IF my dog missed the mat even a little bit overnight, I would wake up and find the liquid had trailed 3 feet down the hallway towards a doorway. I mopped regularly, did my absolute best to keep everything as clean as possible.

Over time this ended up being a disaster. I swear I had no idea what would come next but  you probably do. I learned a very hard lesson through all of this, made many mistakes and did not conceive of the consequences this could have. I learned the wood floors are not sealed. I learned that the liquid was even trailing to the door frame and edge of carpet in the room next door. I was mopping as soon as possible and shampooing the carpet until one day I -finally- took a good look at the door frame. Sh\*t. Yes, I caused water damage to the wood. Yes, eventually the wood floor paneling began lifting as well. Yes, that's extensive and urgent damage.

I called our host and took full responsibility for the damage, profusely apologized, and told her I wanted to let her know as soon as I noticed and we'd be happy to pay for the damages, of course. We had about a month left in our stay and she assured me we'd be able to work something out. However, from this point on she lost all respect and kindness with me.

I understand, I get it, I would be livid too. This situation is NOT okay and I did my best to let her know how desperately sorry I am and how willing I was to cooperate with her in getting this resolved amicably. I allowed her to get worked up sometimes because it's a huge problem and I felt terrible about it. She deserved to lash out a bit if she needed to.

She came by to inspect the damages and I could tell she was trying hard not to say something. I looked her in the eyes and said look, I know this is terrible and I am really sorry. Please say what you're thinking, I know we're going to have to work this out and I'm happy to discuss it. She said it will be extensive and costly and we're going to have to pay it. I told her of course, we're happy to pay for the damage we caused and again I do apologize. Then her mood changed.

Looking back, I realize she flipped once I said we'd pay for everything... She went into the living room and noticed the rugs needed to be shampooed from several months of dirt. ""These need to be replaced"". She saw a corner of the couch my cat had scratched a tiny bit (which I had totally forgotten about). ""We're going to replace all the couches too."" I asked her about an upholsterer, showed her how it's on a seam and all you have to do is snip the tiny exposed threads and sew the seam back up, it's a very simple process and wouldn't be noticeable. She said no, she knows it would never look new again, guests would complain, we're replacing all of the couches. She saw one of the dining table chairs looked dirty (I had been meaning to shampoo it, a guest used that chair to prop their feet up). She claimed she's replacing the entire set of dining chairs too. That one frustrated me a bit, I asked ""can't we try to clean it first?"" She said no, it will never look new so she's replacing it.  I totally understand this is more than wear & tear, but to immediately decide to replace over $1500 of furniture? Without even taking a second to consider basic cleaning, or even giving me a chance to deep clean for her to see if she'd accept the result? Right after I claimed we would pay them for whatever was damaged. Her mood switch was instant and she went from soft & polite to rough and almost rude.

I said it before and I'll say it again, I fucked up. The home needed a deep clean before she came over plus the wood damage - again, I'd be livid too if I were her. I apologized to her several times and was nothing but remorseful and cooperative. But at this point she lost all sense of respect and professionalism. **This is where she fucked up.**

At this point all of her messages were rude and threatening unless she needed something from me. If it was one of her regular entry requests, she would be overly kind and polite like she had been the whole year. But if we were discussing furniture and I proposed a different idea than she liked (like the upholstering), she would immediately get emotional and tear me down, saying how I trashed her house and I'm lucky she didn't evict us, I should be eternally grateful to her for 'going to bat for us' and 'fighting for our family'. ""We typically evict anyone that causes damages, but we like you guys and you were honest so be happy we're letting you stay. I don't normally do this, you should be thankful"".

First, I don't appreciate being threatened and manipulated especially when I'm trying to discuss a business issue. Emotions have no place in business discussions. I still felt I deserved some of it and let her say things like that without protest, understanding where she's coming from. But it just got worse, to the point she would raise her voice and get extremely emotional any time the discussion wasn't exactly what she wanted. She was derisive and interrupted so much, I don't think she even listens half the time. When she was on the phone with my husband she never let him finish his sentences so the conversation would go nowhere except her manipulative whining and berating. I got to finish sentences sometimes, but it would set her off even more.

I was never not thankful, remorseful, or anything of the sort. I never, ever raised my voice with her like she did with me. I never said anything intentionally rude or combative. I did my best to be kind to her while trying to sort out the situation. She would frequently use this type of talk when I brought up anything she didn't like. For example, we had agreed to let her contractor come one day but that morning I had a work emergency. I explained to her I would be very busy on a private call and that day was not good for me, can we reschedule? She came back very aggressively saying, ""Are you refusing me entry?!"" and the like. I tried again to explain it was a work emergency, not a choice, but she did not understand. My spouse noticed I wasn't doing well mentally after being berated and yelled at; he offered to call her for me. During that conversation she kept interrupting again, had a panic in her voice, and kept saying ""this is highly irregular! This makes me suspicious!"" With the few words she let him get out he tried to explain again that it's not a choice on our part, but she wouldn't have it. She demanded I force the entire zoom call to take a 30 minute break at the time her contractor was supposed to come. I'd been nothing but cooperative until that day and was tired of her freaking out again, so I apologized to everyone on the call and we were able to make it work for her.

While we were vacationing internationally she texted me asking us to make a partial payment towards the repairs before she even had quotes ready. We asked her to help us find a good time for a call between the three of us that worked with our international time zone. Vacation or not, we understood the importance of this and wanted to get it handled. At 9pm while on our cruise ship we had a call with her to discuss the finances of the whole thing. We explained that it doesn't make any sense to pay before she knows what the total is going to be. We reminded her we are happy to pay, that's not our issue at all, but I think after requesting this and being refused it just set her off. She claimed she was going to call the owner RIGHT NOW and see what he says. Turns out the owner also told her no, that doesn't make sense. We all agreed that no payment would be made until she knew what the cost would be.

Within a few days she sends us a breakdown estimate of some of the costs. It seems like she thought that would be sufficient to get some money from us before move out, we had to remind her that even the owner agreed we wouldn't have to pay anything until we know the full estimate. She seemed upset at that and turned the conversation around in her favor again - she instructed me to source all of the furniture that she wanted replaced. This didn't make sense to me at all. You know what furniture you want, what to look for, the quality you need, the colors you want, all of it. Why would you have a leaving tenant find the furniture for you? I do totally understand it's my penance and I was happy to help, but it left me really confused. As an owner I would never leave that up to a tenant, especially one I'm not on the best terms with and don't trust. Again I'm happy to help, but from her business side of it this seemed like a bad decision. I never would intentionally mess it up for her, but I wouldn't trust a tenant to do this.

I try to get more details from her without setting her off. I explain I'm happy to source the furniture and pay for the replacements, but I need more direction. She told me I can send her options I find for approval and simply told me it needs to be about the same size and color as what she had before. I start looking and send her some feeler options from Amazon to get a better idea of what she needs. She eventually approves the couch, an armchair, the rug... then tells me the ottoman won't work because she doesn't want it to come from Amazon. Her reasoning was that you can't guarantee quality on there, the ottoman MUST be sourced from Facebook Marketplace specifically.

The couch is fine from Amazon, but not the ottoman? You're taking a huge risk with furniture matching, and if you're actually worried about quality I'd be much more concerned about the couch... and on Marketplace there's no way you can guarantee quality, get reviews, and you even have the risk of it being dirty or damaged in some way you don't find at pickup. On top of all that! That makes her approval process for the item that much more risky - we can't find a guaranteed match, and just because you approve the photo doesn't mean you'd approve it when picking it up. You might have certain things you're looking for that I don't know about. The whole furniture replacement situation left me really confused. I'll say it yet again, I am happy to pay my penance, save you time, and help out with replacing these items. But her requirements and business sense were so wild. Between asking us to pay without knowing the cost, being weird about the furniture, and losing all sense of professionalism, I began to doubt her business acumen more and more.

We get all the furniture sourced and delivered, then only at this point she lets me know she wants all the new furniture in place before we move out. I put my foot down on this one, finally trying to stand up not just for myself but for her too - she doesn't want us moving heavy furniture up and down stairs in her place when she already doesn't trust us. I explained to her that removing, building, and moving in furniture is high risk for further damage. I don't want to take on that liability and frankly, didn't want to risk her finding something random and claiming it was us from moving furniture around. I didn't want to take on liability for not building it correctly or whatever else she would come up with. At this point we didn't trust her either and had a very strong sense she was going to nickel & dime us for all she can.

Of course she didn't like me pushing back but instead of insulting me this time she tried to be flippant and say, ""Oh well, then I'll just hire my handyman and charge you for that"". Good! That's what you should do, that's good business sense, and again we're happy to pay. That's the best option in this situation for all parties, I don't know why she had to toss it out like a veiled threat.

**Now comes move out day.**

We had a walkthrough scheduled with her and were not looking forward to it mainly because of her terrible behavior the last month. She'd been antagonistic and downright rude, insulting, and could not listen and maintain a conversation to save her life. We both are still feeling awful about the condition we left the place in and we were happy to pay for damages we caused. We were just waiting on her final quote that included all her materials, as agreed with the owner. The walkthrough was supposed to be quick and maybe a discussion of where/how to pay them.

From the moment we see her, she's in a contentious mood already. She's frowning, walking through and pulling out chairs and curtains, opening appliances, etc. We know it's a walkthrough and she should be doing these things, just maybe not as aggressively as she was with slamming cabinets and stomping her boots up the stairs so they echo through the home. She spends forever upstairs and starts to come down twice before going back and spending another few minutes. We figure she's just inspecting, make faces at each other acknowledging her attitude, and wait for her to finish.

When she is finally done she pulls out a chair to sit and ask us for money. We're shocked, we exchange bewildered looks, and wait for her to explain. She seems fully confident that today we were going to pay half of that partial quote she previously sent. This was never discussed, and additionally the owner agreed previously that we wouldn't pay until you had an estimate for everything? She admits she doesn't know the cost of wood yet, and even admits she has no idea how much wood costs and hasn't looked it up yet. Trying to be amicable, we settle into this discussion and silently agree between ourselves to work with her demands today to keep things civil.

It ends up turning into a full blown argument because every time my husband tries to explain something or ask a question, she cut him off. Both of us were very patient with her, my spouse is a saint and deals with prisoners all day so he's used to staying calm while others are aggressive towards him. I mostly sat to the side and let them talk business, chiming in occasionally with ""that's not what he said"" and ""please let him speak"". Eventually she gets so worked up she can't even finish her sentences, she's raising her voice, and full on insulting us and doing her threats again. We're blown away, we're just trying to ask questions and get this sorted out when she has a full on breakdown right in front of us. There's no way we can even continue discussing business because its getting out of hand and we cant get a word in edgewise.

I finally ask her stop and leave emotions out of it, we're trying to work something out here. She immediately flips from whining to a very aggressive face. ""I cant do this with you here, go downstairs!""  ..  excuse me? How on God's green earth is this a professional discussion in any form? I get livid but my spouse gives me a look and I let him handle the discussion going forward. I only interrupt to say ""let him talk"" occasionally when he has tried to say the same thing three times without her interrupting. She kept being manipulative, changing her excuses and her mood to try to get the upper hand at every turn. At this point I'm getting compassion fatigue - I've done nothing but been cooperative and patient, been constantly belittled and threatened, and she even told me to leave the damned room. I still feel bad for the awful situation, but dealing with her has been an absolute nightmare. Once my spouse realized she's going to keep playing games and not actually let a discussion happens, he makes an offer. I wouldnt have, but he was getting tired of it too. ​

We weren't even supposed to be giving her anything at all on move out day, but finally agree on a sum and ask her to draft us a receipt. For some reason she thinks we want a contract. She voice dictates the needs of the contract to AI and while she's editing it we say again we just need a receipt. She says she's got it all done and sends us a copy to sign. We read it, apparently she didnt expect this because she was very impatient. My spouse points out this contract says we are liable to pay 100% of anything they deem worth charging.

She chuckles and says, ""oh thats harsh isn't it! Sorry, I didnt even read it"" .. how tf can you think so lightly of legal documents? Why do you think we'd blindly sign anything, especially some ai drafted 5 minute document. Red flags and bells are waving and screaming in my head but I'm letting my spouse handle it as he sees fit (and trying hard not to set her off again - notice that once we agreed to pay she dropped the act immediately and was all smiles and laughs).

We tell her we're not signing it and she immediately flips out again, whining and exasperated that we wanted a contract and we tried to tell her no, we just asked for a receipt. She's got contracts in her head now and sees a benefit for herself so is pushing it hard. Finally my spouse is done. He's calm, his attitude didnt change, but its obvious she's shady, cant keep facts straight, doesn't know what she's doing, and we're in a high risk situation with absolutely no trust in legal or business sense.

He makes her an offer. We'll pay this whole lump sum right now, your estimates and a little buffer room, if you drop everything and we no longer have liability. Her mood instantly flipped again. She dropped her manipulative insults and whining and her poor pitiful me act and immediately was smiles and laughing yet again. She happily said okay, let me draft a contract for that! She writes up another one says we have paid x amount and this 100% fully releases us from any further liability.

Except the new contract had a typo. The amount was actually $100 over what we had agreed to. In the middle of this she had made a call to someone saying she's trying to get out but will be late, on top of that we're exhausted from dealing with childish behavior from an adult and being pushed into a corner, and the difference in amount was little enough. All things considered we told her the contract with the typo is okay for now, we'll just need the corrected one to be sent later that day. ​​She apologized for the typo and assured us she would send the corrected version. I highly doubted that but was happy to be done with it.

Turns out I was right - she didnt send it that day. Or the next one. I sent her my third followup text on the third day and she immediately comes out swinging. Same attitude as before, I should be grateful for her fighting for us, why am I asking her this when she already sent it. I'm trying to avoid her emotional response as much as possible and respond with strictly business and that upsets her too. She insults me, practically attacks me in 4 paragraphs, and says she sent it already. She sends me a screenshot of her sending the wrong document again. ""So you're saying you didn't receive this."" I tell her I did, thats not the correct document. She immediately stops being aggressive, realizes her mistake, and promises me she'll send it. ​​

The next day I text again, please email me the pdf showing the correct amount. I hate constantly bothering people and I dont want to talk to her either, but damn I just need you to send me what you promised four days ago. This time she doesn't say anything and just sends screenshots of the document with some parts updated. It's still wrong, part of the document wasnt edited, and I'm regretting having to ask her to fix it.

I point out where the issue is and ask her yet again to EMAIL the PDF.  An hour later she sends me screenshot again of the correct document. Regrettably I have to bother her yet again(!) to please handle business seriously and email me the pdf. I haven't been insulting at all, only asked ""thank you so much, please email the pdf when you have time today."" She comes back one last time with her belittling attitude. ""You can convert it yourself. I'm done communicating with you.""

And thats my story, so far.

I told all of this over time to my best friend. I complained that she was rude an unprofessional and seems to have no actual business sense even though she always likes to say, ""I've been doing this for 10 years!""

My friend said, yeah, she's been scamming people like this for 10 years.  You guys got scammed hard, she knew exactly what she was doing the whole time. Evidenced by her swift mood changes, constant interruptions, telling me to leave when I tried to regain control of the situation. By her telling me she replaced all the furniture when the last tenant left and immediately wanting to toss whole sets of furniture now. By not even bothering to look up wood costs and intentionally ignoring that we agreed to not pay until she had everything. The list goes on.

Here I am seeing two sides. The side where she's really dumb, has no working memory, is blatantly rude and cant handle a business discussion without having a breakdown. Or the side that yes, we were pulled along and manipulated this entire time. That as soon as she saw opportunities to get cash from us she went hard down that rabbit hole. ​​That her emotional breakdowns were intelligently planned and she's way more on top of the situation that she lets on.

Either way I am furious with the way I've been treated and how she handles business. I doubt I'll ever get the correct document emailed, and I am willing to bet she made a pretty profit from our lump sum agreement.

No matter what, I just want to be done with it but I cannot shake the feeling I need to speak up and warn future renters. Whether its incompetence or malice, none of it was okay and she is a nightmare of a person.  I hate speaking poorly of people but this last year has been a wild ride and I just need some help getting my head on straight.

  
TL;DR: I caused some damage to the home, apologized, cooperated, and my landlord became a monster. I've been told that its not incompetence, its malice. 

I'm conflicted and it really did take me a whole essay to write out all the issues and incidents that have happened over the last year. ",0,1764795014.0,AmIOverreacting,5,0.5,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Belmont Bruins vs. Richmond Spiders: A Statistical Slaughter or a Spider’s Web of Deception?**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a basketball clash that’s less “Game of the Century” and more “Why Are We Paying to Watch This?” Belmont Bruins (8-0) host the Richmond Spiders (6-1) in a Missouri Valley Conference showdown that’s as lopsided on paper as a pancake at a steakhouse. Let’s break it down with the precision of a coach’s clipboard and the humor of a player tripping over their own ego.

---

### Parse the Odds: The Math Doesn’t Lie (Unless It’s About Richmond’s Road Record)

Belmont is a **7.5-point favorite**, per the BETMGM line, with a total of 155.5 points. Translating the decimal odds (1.32 for Belmont, 3.5 for Richmond) into implied probabilities? **Belmont’s implied win chance hovers around 76%**, while Richmond’s sits at a paltry 29%. That’s the statistical equivalent of flipping a coin and betting your life savings on heads—except the coin’s weighted, and your opponent just smirked at your poor life choices.

Key stats? Belmont outscores opponents by **19.4 points per game**, led by Sam Orme’s 15.6 PPG and a rebounding average of **37.5 boards per game** (like a vacuum cleaner with a college degree). Richmond, meanwhile, allows a pedestrian 65.1 PPG but somehow manages to score 84.7. Their +19.6 differential is impressive… until you realize they’ve only played one true road game this season. Ever. It’s the basketball equivalent of acing a math test with a calculator, then being asked to count change at a gas station.

### Digest the News: Spiders in a Web, Bruins on a Roll

Belmont’s resume? Eight wins, four at home, and a defense that’s tighter than a drumhead at a jazz concert. Sam Orme, their Swiss Army knife of a forward, shoots 55.6% from the field—imagine if your coffee actually tasted as good as this. Tyler Lundblade adds 16.6 PPG, and together they form a duo as reliable as Netflix on a Tuesday night.

Richmond’s plight?

I've been debating on posting it due to the length of it and not knowing if this is the correct subreddit group for this type of question but renecently some more unnerving conversations have happened and I'd like some insight. Thanks so much and sorry if this isn't the correct subreddit group.


Topic of discussion:
Having Thanksgiving with family we had not seen in a year due to having a premature baby almost a year ago.

Prior to discussion:
Host called to let us know that some people had been sick recently (not them but some of the fam) and that they would prefer if we sit in the den while everyone else stayed mostly in the shop if we think that's a good idea. We agreed because being out of the NICU for almost 9 months feels wonderful and we do not want to risk the baby getting sick again and us having to take her to the hospital. Note: host (and family) are on speaker 2's side of our family.

Morning of Thanksgiving

*Speaker 1* is making coffee and walking around kitchen tidying up.

*Speaker 2* is washing bottles.

Speaker 2
So we're going to eat in the den today right?

Speaker 1
Yeah I guess so.

Speaker 2
Are we going to carry the baby through the shop while we fix our plates?

Speaker 1
Oh. I'm not sure. I guess we can or we can just go separately so one of us can stay in the den with the baby.

Speaker 2
Well are we going to introduce the baby to people outside?

Speaker 1
I mean we can if you want to sure.

Speaker 2
Is that any different from introducing the baby to people in the shop?

Speaker 1
Hmm no I guess not. We could just take the baby in the barn then I guess.

Speaker 2
No that's not what I'm saying.

Speaker 1
No but it does make sense. If they're going to be in the baby's bubble outside I really don't think it would be any different inside.  It's kinda like da*n the difference ya know?

Speaker 2
No that's not what I was saying. I'm not saying at all that I want the baby inside with people.

Speaker 1
Okay. Then the baby doesn't have to go inside with people. That's fine too.

Speaker 2
Why do you have an attitude?

Speaker 1
I don't?

Speaker 2
You're literally making a face at me.

Speaker 1
I'm just making coffee. I'm not trying to make faces. I'm really not trying to make you feel like I have an attitude.

Speaker 2
So why are you mad then?

Speaker 1
I'm not.

Speaker 2
I just feel like you're mad at me and have an attitude.

Speaker 1
Well you could ask me and I would tell you. But I really don't.

Speaker 2
Why's it gotta be that way? Why do I have to ask you every time?

Speaker 1
Because you think I have an attitude when I don't and if you ask me I can tell you so you don't have to assume.

*Speaker 2 moves into living room to be with baby*

*Speaker 1 moves into door way since we were still talking.*

Speaker 1
So I'm just supposed to ask you what each face means?

Speaker 2
Yes.

Speaker 2
All you're going to say is that they don't mean anything.

Speaker 1
That's because they usually don't but if I have a problem with what you're saying when you ask I'll tell you.

*Speaker 1 goes to get ingredients ready for dish they were taking to Thanksgiving *

Speaker 2
See why are you walking away? You have an attitude.

Speaker 1
*stops and turns around* I'm going to get the ingredients I need so they can be getting to room temp because I don't want to stand here talking about rather or not I have an attitude for 2 hours when I need my stuff to be ready before then so I'm going to do that now and it does not mean I have an attitude.

*Speaker 1 comes back into living room and sits down*

Speaker 1
I'm going to have to go get a measuring cup in about 2 and a 1/2 minutes and that will not mean that I have an attitude or a problem with what you are saying, at that particular point. Nor do I have one right now.

Speaker 2
*Insert Speaker 1's Name*, okay. So the reason why I say, you have a problem is because how else am I.. What else am I supposed to do? Sit here and go *Insert Speaker 1's name* What did that face mean? What did that word mean, what did this mean? Well what did that mean, am I supposed to just be asking 50 questions? 

Speaker 1
Yes.

Speaker 2
So when you go nothing, it meant nothing. I'm supposed to go well then, why did you make that face and you say I didn't make a face. So so I get to just look at you see how you're feeling and then I just get to feel wrong constantly. 

Speaker 1
Well, One. You weren't really looking at me? You were washing bottles. I was making coffee and be-bopping around the kitchen..

Speaker 2
I'm talking about anytime because this could apply to anytime that we have conversations like this. 

Speaker 1
Then yes. And when I say, oh, it meant nothing, believe me. Cause this face does not mean I have an attitude. Whatever my eyebrows are doing right now? Cause I can feel them, I can feel them doing something but memorize this. And just know this one look means nothing. And my next face, this one, whatever they're doing right now you're not even looking at me, so good conversation

Speaker 2
No because if I look at you then I'm going to get offended.

Speaker 1
But whatever I'm doing right now also means nothing.

Speaker 2
So I'm listening to you. I'm not trying to get offended. 

Speaker 1
Well, you can't hear me and then throw a face that you didn't see at me. But the one I'm doing right now, does not mean anything. 

Speaker 2
Baby, you always say all your faces mean nothing. 

Speaker 1
And most of the time they don't. And when they do I tell you, like, oh no it might have been, because I was doing this, or because I was doing that. And if it's my face that's your wholehearted problem I will certainly turn around and we can have a conversation like we did that last time where you talked to my back, because my back does not make faces and we got really far in that conversation if I remember correctly. 

Speaker 2
After we had a whole knock out - drag out - uhh - that is just ludecris *Insert Speaker 1's name*..

Speaker 1
Yeah, well, it's also ludicrous. For you to not be able to look at me without thinking I have an attitude and a conversation.

Speaker 2
Baby, if I'm supposed to control what I say, you should be able to control how you say it. 

Speaker 1
My face is not my words. Is it? 

Speaker 2
So you don't see how.. whatever. 

Speaker 1
And I don't know if you know this or not but your eyebrows also move, your forehead moves, your mouth moves. And sometimes it looks like you might not be liking what you're hearing or liking the way the conversations going. 

Speaker 2
Because I don't.

Speaker 1 
And do I look at you and say, Oh, you're having such a big problem with what I'm saying? 

Speaker 2 
Yeah, You could. Because I do. I mean cause it's the truth. I do have a problem with it.

Speaker 1
Okay.. And then what is that gonna do for the conversation? 

Speaker 2
Well, it's me being honest and telling you how I fell about something

Speaker 1
And if I was honestly upset with what you were saying, I would tell you 

Speaker 2
You act like I don't apply the same rules with how I'm feeling.

Speaker 1
I'm not acting like anything. What I'm telling you is, I don't I do not focus my attention on your face when we are in the middle of a conversation. Because your face does not equate what you are telling me. And if I need to know how you're feeling I ask you. And I don't say, oh, well, your face must mean your ill or your face must mean that you didn't like that, or your face must mean you have a problem with what I'm saying. I say, Hey, do you have an issue like? Is there a problem?  That's what I do. You can go based off of however you want to. But we have spent 20 minutes talking about my faces and rather or not, I have an attitude and nothing about the conversation we were having. 

Speaker 2
*Insert speaker 1's name*, that's a huge exaggeration, we've spent 20 minutes, talking about only that, and then you always go through our conversations the same way. You always do the same thing. 

Speaker 1
Do I not?

Speaker 2
Sometimes you don't.

Speaker 1
Okay, do I ever bring up your face? And the way that it must mean you feel?

Speaker 2
No.

Speaker 1
Okay. That's all I was saying. I didn't say I went through every conversation the same.

Speaker 2
Well you said that you handle me the same way in every conversation. 

Speaker 1
Did I or did I say I don't focus on your faces?

Speaker 2
But you said extra. You said other things with it, though. You said you don't focus on my face and if you have a question you ask it, and if you feel like I'm acting or feeling a certain way you ask me. Do you feel like you do those every time - Those 2 too? I understand the part of not focusing on my face, but do you feel like you do the other 2 every single time too? 

Speaker 1
Yes.

Speaker 2
Okay, I don't. 

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 2
And that's where you're not. You didn't hear your own self in your own conversation just then, because you had other things in that conversation. But yet you were only applying one to the entire conversation. 

Speaker 1
Okay. 

Speaker 2 
And then you were like, And we've talked 20 minutes about all of it. 

Speaker 1
Okay

Speaker 2
That's a little, that's being a little overzealous, there *Insert Speaker 1's name*? 

Speaker 1 
Okay. My bad.. We have spent *checks time on phone* 15 minutes not 20. Sorry. 

Speaker 2  
This so having a conversation with you, you make yourself right the entire time. You tell me all the things you've done, right. And that's what you.. that's what you just got through doing. 

Speaker 1
Okay. 

Speaker 2  
And then telling me how I've not continued the conversation well. 

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 2
That's what you just did. You literally just told me all things I did wrong. All the things you did right. And how we've not, how we've not progressed in the conversation. Do you.. Do you think that that's like appropriate? Or if I handled it that way, would you have a problem with it? Yeah you would. You'd say something about it too.

Speaker 1
Okay.

Speaker 2  
And we'd have a conversation about it because it wouldn't be appropriate, but, but, now that I'm bringing it up to you and saying that you've done it, You're not gonna, you don't acknowledge this and it's, Oh I didn't do that.

Speaker 1 
Is that what I did? 

Speaker 2 
The oh okay. Really cements it in there for me. 

Speaker 1 
Well, why do you have an attitude? 

Speaker 2 
Why do I have an attitude?

Speaker 1
Yeah, why are you taking my oh okay as bad?

Speaker 2  
How else am I supposed to take it? 

Speaker 1  
What else am I supposed to say? 

Speaker 2 
You could see whatt, okay, so you could do the same thing to me which is to see where I'm coming from..

Speaker 1  
And how do I acknowledge where you're coming from? How do I let you know that I hear you? 

Speaker 2 
Does oh okay mean that? Is that what you're trying to tell me? Oh okay means..

Speaker 1  
I don't know I'm asking you Because I don't have to be right, my oh okay doesn't have to mean what I think it means I'm asking you. How should I let you know that I hear you? What, what should I say? You got it?

Speaker 2 
You.. But you don't.. Do you not see that stuff? Do you not. See where I'm coming from there?

Speaker 1  
That I'm always right. And that I tell you, you're doing a poor job? Sure, I see that. 

Speaker 2
You literally just did.

Speaker 1 
Did I or did I tell you what I do?

Speaker 2  
What you do and the what I don't do or what I do that's wrong, and you did, and you don't see that you did that.

Speaker 1
Okay

Speaker 2 
Like, you really don't. You really think that you only.. 

Speaker 1 
*Insert speaker 2's name*, I'm asking you questions, I'm not saying anything. 

Speaker 2 
Yeah because your questions are to back me up and to tell me I didn't, and that what I'm sayin isn't right.. 

Speaker 1
Okay. If that's how you took it then you're right.

Speaker 2
Is that not the case? 

Speaker 1
No

Speaker 2
Is that not what your questions are for? 

Speaker 1
No. You're absolutely right. 

Speaker 2
Then what are your questions for?

Speaker 1
My conversation goes that you're 100% wrong. 

Speaker 2
I'm asking. Please tell me. What, What did they mean?

Speaker 1
That's what they were, that's what it was. 

Speaker 2  
You reallyy.. Can you explain to me what you meant?

Speaker 1  
Oh that you were wrong. Sorry. I will try not to make you wrong the next time I'm explaining what I do.

Speaker 2
Do you think that's a really appropriate response to our conversation? And to treat me like that? Because like I treated you differently. Like honestly.

Speaker 1
Yes, I do. 

Speaker 2
But why though? Why are you doing this to me?

Speaker 1
Because I always do according to you.

Speaker 2
But I'm asking you though.. Will you stop? Like *Insert speaker 1's name* that's no fair though. Please stop.

Speaker 1 
You look at my face and assume how I feel but when I say that it's I'm telling you what you're doing wrong. So I'm still doing that.

Speaker 2  
But I heard that part and I told you that. I was trying to say oh okay, whatever to that one but then I told you something that I felt and you just said oh okay. What I mean, what did the oh okay mean then??

Speaker 1 
The same thing you oh okay meant.

Speaker 2 
It means I hear you and that's fine, it can be that way..?

Speaker 1 
Precisely 

Speaker 2
But you don't feel that way.. And how was that.. How is that.. How is it you agreeing with me?

Speaker 1
Who said I don't feel that way? 

Speaker 2 
You want me to ask questions but then you don't answer and of the ones I'm saying. And you're not saying anything when you do answer them. You're just saying who said I don't feel that way. Like why are you not answering my questions? Why can't you just answer them?

Speaker 1 
Because when I answer them with an explanation, It's I'm telling you all the things you did wrong and all of the ways I'm right, so I will ask you questions instead. 

Speaker 2  
Why can't you just do.. Why can't you just do neither though?? Why are you doing both?

Speaker 1
What?

Speaker 2
Why are you doing either of those?

Speaker 1  
You mean giving you an explanation or asking questions? Because that's the way of conversations. 

Speaker 2
Asking questions to get out of it. 

Speaker 1
Is that what that is? 

Speaker 2  
You make me feel inadequate in this conversation. Like you're berating me.

Speaker 1 
Yeah, well, you make me feel like I treat you 100% like the enemy. 

Speaker 2
You are. 

Speaker 1
MMM.

Speaker 2
And you. I mean. 

Speaker 1
No wonder you feel inadequate then. That's how I would feel too. I'm glad you don't do that to me by thinking I have an attitude 24/7 because of my face. Or meeting every word I say with I'm berating you because I said it. So I'm glad you don't do that to me because I would hate to feel that way. Even though you do but when I'm say it, it's because I'm treating you like you're a problem. Sorry. I'm going to go find her paci and that does not mean I have a problem.

Speaker 2 
I see that that is how you could feel but like whenever I'm telling you those things and telling you this it's because I'm telling you how what you're saying is making me feel.

Speaker 1 
Precisely. No question there.

Speaker 2 
But because I bring it up it's a problem?

Speaker 1 
No. No problem.

Speaker 2  
Why do you say that but there is? Why are you saying that?

Speaker 1 
The problem is how I make you feel. You heard what I said and then got upset over how it made you feel. That does not mean that's how I take it when we have conversations.

Speaker 2  
You're point is that how it makes me feel isn't how it makes you feel, right? Is that you're point? 

Speaker 1
I wasn't really trying to prove a point but if you're asking, yes. That is how I feel and the same rule applies.

Speaker 2 
So that happens to you first; To you first.

Speaker 1 
Yeah. 

Speaker 2  
Who.. How do we... who proceeds with what? How are we supposed to move forward with that? If it happens to you first how do you move forward with that and if it happens to me first, how do I move forward with that? When the first person makes the other person feel this way, even if it may not have been meant to, it still made them feel this way. You get what I'm saying?

Speaker 1 
I'm not answering that. Because it's only opinions. If me not asking you how what I said makes you feel and me not asking you if there's a problem and trying to talk to you - The things I said I do really are all in my head and they don't happen everytime, then I'm not able to answer that because it'll be different every single time because we don't have concrete things we're doing. Now if you're asking me to come up with concrete things to do, I can try. But I'm only going to come up with things for me to do because I don't want to have to tell you what to do. You're a grown man, you can think of a way to move on from a conversation of fact check what you think.

Speaker 2
If you don't feel like your face should concern me, how am I suppose to fact check that *Insert speaker 1's name*? Besides asking you and when you say oh it doesn't mean that, what am I just suppose to believe you?

Speaker 1  
Did them eyebrows mean that you're not going to believe me?

Speaker 2  
Oh no, no I am. I am. 

Speaker 1 
Exactly. Just because you moved them doesn't mean they meant anything.

Speaker 2  
And when I have an attitude I'll just be like ""oh I have an attitude"" but when I ask if you have an attitude you're just going to be like ""oh no I don't.""

Speaker 1  
Because I don't.

Speaker 2  
But if were having a conversation with me you would be like ""you might.""

Speaker 1  
I don't. And sometimes I say that I do.

Speaker 2  
So when you say you don't, you don't?

Speaker 1 
Noo. And I will work on the prefixing the things that I say 

Speaker 2  
I don't like that because that feels very unnecessary and offensive.

Speaker 1 
I'm not trying to be offensive. I'm just trying to reassure you. You told me I need to tell you.

Speaker 2  
No I don't like it because it feels shiesty it doesn't feel kind to me. It feels like you're going ""Now *Insert speaker 2's name* don't get offended.""

Speaker 1  
Earlier you said you didn't want to ask every 5 seconds and that you wanted me to tell you so that is what I'm doing. 

Speaker 2  
How you feel and how you feel like you're getting ignored is the same way I feel too but I feel like yours is the only one that matters and mine is the ""oh you made me feel this way is so."" and that's how I feel like it always is and that's not fair.

Speaker 1 
Okay.

Speaker 2 
And you get to make yourself feel better in the end and I get to be left over here feeling the same way and I don't understand that. Like in the end you'll feel better, you'll have said you piece and gotten to get your point across and in the end I'll feel like my point is getting nulled and doesn't even matter anymore. And it all gets roped into you point and yours is the valid one and mines not in the end. And you don't see that do you?

Speaker 1 
No.

Speaker 2 
Do you feel like it's the other way around?

Speaker 1  
No.

Speaker 2  
So in the end you feel like everyone gets their point made?

Speaker 1
Yeah.

Speaker 2 
You feel like everyone gets their point made? I'm asking you I'm not trying to be redundant you feel like everyone get's their point made and everyone gets their point across?

Speaker 1
Yeah. 

Speaker 2  
You included?

Speaker 1 
Most of the time yeah - Very rarely do I not. I'm going to go get the baby some food, I'm not walking away from this conversation.

Speaker 2  
Don't do that to me man. Don't do that.

Speaker 1  
Oh okay.

Speaker 2  
I'm asking you nicely - I don't want you to do that to me anymore. I don't like it.

Speaker 1 
Well then how can I reassure you?

Speaker 2  
I don't like it.

Speaker 1  
I didn't say you had to, I'm asking a question. I'm waiting for you to answer you.

Speaker 2
Don't.

Speaker 1
So don't reassure you? Okayy that aught to go well as history repeats itself.

Speaker 2
Snide. Snide remarks.

Speaker 1
No I'm telling you how I feel about it. That aught to go well.

Speaker 2
Why do you insist though?

Speaker 1
Because if I can't reassure you then you're never going to know and you didn't say that I didn't need to because you would ask me from now on. So will you ask questions? Will you ask me how I'm feeling?

Speaker 2
Every time you walk away? That's what I'm supposed to do?

Speaker 1
If that's how it makes you feel because I'm not able to tell which times me walking out is going to hurt your feelings so if I have to preface it, I'm going to every time but if you will ask me then you only need to ask when it hurts your feelings.

Speaker 2
Just don't worry about it.

Speaker 1
So who is making your feelings invalid because I'm trying to reassure you and I'm trying to have an actual conversation over it and you just keep saying ""Don't. I don't care, I don't want to talk about it.""

Speaker 2
Because you said everybody gets their point across so then I should just feel better already anyways. Right? If everybody's gotten their point across and their point made then I should just feel fine in the end.

Speaker 1
That isn't what I said and it also isn't the end .. Weren't we still talking? 

Speaker 2
Yeah.

Speaker 1
So me walking away in the middle of the conversation without saying anything might offend you. How am I suppose to know?

Speaker 2
You said so how are you supposed to know?

Speaker 1
Yeah if I don't preface it.. And you don't ask me how I'm feeling about it.. Then I just come back to ""Oh you walked out."" and I don't want to do that..

Speaker 2
Okay well then I won't do that anymore. I won't, I won't, Iiii Won't.

Speaker 1
Well if it hurts your feelings then it hurts your feelings.

Speaker 2
And that's right.

Speaker 1
Okay so either I can reassure beforehand so that I don't get told I have an attitude or you can just ask me instead of assuming I do. 

Speaker 2
I just won't worry about it.

Speaker 1
But I'm giving you my options.

Speaker 2
You're giving me your options? And I have to pick one of them.

Speaker 1
You don't have to but if you don't I'm going to and if I have to pick it's going to be to prefacing my actions because that's the only one I can do. The other one you can do if you choose to, you don't have to.

Speaker 2
Prefacing your actions seems veryyy backhanded in my opinion and I don't like it.

Speaker 1
So then pick the other option.

Speaker 2
I don't like the other option either.

Speaker 1
Well then too bad. You don't get to not pick either option and assume how I'm feeling. That's the whole point of the conversation.

Speaker 2
So then I can just be more irate and upset about you prefacing - That sounds like that'll work.

Speaker 1
At least then you'll know how I'm feeling.

Speaker 2
So then I can just be more irate and upset about you prefacing.

Speaker 1
*Insert speaker 2's name* I don't know how I can make this make sense to you but yeah - If you're going to have a problem with me prefacing and it's going to cause problems.. it's the same to me as me going somewhere and coming back to ""Oh you just walked away from our conversation"" and now that's caused a problem. Those are BOTH my problems that I'm left to deal with and apologize for and make up for. Now we can remedy that by me explaining before I do something or you asking me. The one with you asking me only applies when you feel like my action meant something so that wouldn't be every time if that makes any difference but it does mean that you don't get to just jump straight to that, you'd have to ask me.

Speaker 2
*Silence..*

Speaker 1
Hey - No rush just think about it and let me know when you pick an option.

Speaker 2
No. I don't want to pick an option so I'm not picking any.

Speaker 1
Okay well then I'm going to pick prefacing.

**I have to walk out and I preface that - Speaker 2 doesn't look happy and doesn't talk when I come back in**

Speaker 1
Well back to the original conversation, it makes no difference if people are in the baby's vicinity inside or outside if they're still going to be in her vicinity. So if we decide that it'll be easier to make plates together and hold her inside the barn, I'm okay with that.

Speaker 2
No. I already said no. And I didn't want that originally. I wasn't even advocating for that. I wasn't even advocating for that and I said no. I. I said no.

Speaker 1
I wasn't asking what you said.

Speaker 2
And then I even said I wasn't even advocating for it. And then the whole conversation was not to make you want to take her in there.

Speaker 1
I didn't say I wanted to.

Speaker 2
Then why are you even bringing it up? Why does it matter?

Speaker 1
Because I would think that the way I feel matters and I want you to know how I feel about a specific topic we were talking about. But I understand if it doesn't. **Had to walk out and prefaced it**

Speaker 2
*Insert speaker 1's name* I said stop.

Speaker 1
And you said you weren't choosing.

Speaker 2
No. I'll choose then because I'm tired of that Alll Readyy. Sick of it.

Speaker 1
Okay.

**Never talked about again**

**Update from Thanksgiving get together: Speaker 2 sat in the den and worried all day because everything seemed strange because everyone was out side. They also decided that we should take turns getting food but we should go together thus defeating the purpose of taking turns but we had to stand outside the barn to have that discussion because nothing was decided with this conversation. It was a long day filled with panic and anxiety because this conversation went south and was never fully discussed instead we focused on feelings and argued about that.**",1,1764795010.0,NarcissisticSpouses,2,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Ball State Cardinals vs. Evansville Purple Aces: A Tale of Purple, Red, and Point Spreads**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for a showdown that could be mistaken for a color wheel fight: the Ball State Cardinals (0-0) take on the Evansville Purple Aces (0-0) in a game so evenly matched, the only thing both teams have in common is their undefeated records… and their shared confusion about why this game matters. Let’s parse the odds, digest the absurdity, and crown a winner before someone trips over a shoelace again.

---

### Parse the Odds: Numbers That Scream “Boring But True”

The odds here are as clear as a Netflix password shared over a crowded coffee shop. **Evansville is the favorite**, with decimal odds hovering around **1.34-1.36** (implying a **74% implied probability** of victory), while Ball State sits at **3.2-3.4** (a **29.8%-31.3% chance**). The spread? A tidy **6.5 points in Evansville’s favor**, meaning the Aces must win by *at least eight* to cover, while the Cardinals can “cover” by losing by six or fewer—or, ideally for bettors with a death wish, winning outright. The total is set at **136.5**, with Over/Under odds hovering around **1.91**, suggesting bookmakers expect a grind-it-out affair, not a shootout.

Why the gap? Well, Evansville’s recent schedule likely includes victories over teams like “The Local Community College All-Stars,” while Ball State’s “0-0” record is less a testament to skill and more a reflection of their December start date. The math checks out: when two teams with zero wins meet, the one with the cooler mascot name usually wins.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Drama, and One Banana Peel

Let’s be real: the only “news” here is the absence of *real* news. Neither team has faced a ranked opponent this season, and their rosters are as mysterious as a cryptic text from an ex. However, we *can* speculate!

* **Ball State’s star point guard**, Jordan “Handles Everything” Smith, is “recovering from a minor injury” sustained

The North Sea stretched out in every direction like an endless expanse of slate, its surface restless with ripples and swells that caught the gray light of a sky swollen with heavy clouds. James adjusted the tiller of his small yacht, the Seabird, and exhaled through his teeth. The cold air stung his lungs, sharper than the cup of coffee that had gone lukewarm in its steel thermos beside him.

It was supposed to be a solitary trip, one man, one boat, a short voyage across to the coast of Norway. He had told himself he needed the silence. He had told himself that isolation was cleansing, a way to burn off the fatigue of city life.

But out here, surrounded by heaving water and the endless sigh of wind, James already felt a prickling unease. Solitude had teeth, and they were starting to graze his skin.

He tightened his jacket, the fabric crackling in the cold. The Seabird creaked as it dipped into a trough and rose again, sails straining. Somewhere beneath, the keel hummed against the unseen pressure of the deep.

And then he heard it.

A sound, faint and almost lost beneath the slap of waves.

A melody.

James blinked and turned his head. At first, he thought it was the groan of wood or the trick of wind through rigging, but it lingered too long, too steady. Thin voices, high, soft, wavering as though carried through water were singing.

Children.

The hair on his arms stood on end. He couldn’t make out the words, but the cadence was unmistakable: a nursery rhyme tune, fragile and looping, drifting across the dark water.

James gripped the tiller harder. “It’s the wind,” he muttered to himself, his own voice startlingly loud in the hollow silence of the sea. “Just the wind.”

But the wind didn’t rhyme. The wind didn’t laugh between verses, like children trying not to giggle.

He shuddered and busied himself with adjusting the sails, forcing his thoughts to focus on practicalities. Compass steady. Course true. No vessels in sight on the horizon. That was good. Normal.

Normal was what he needed.

Hours passed. The day never brightened fully, clouds hung low, threatening rain but never delivering more than mist. James ate a protein bar, drank the last of his coffee, and tried not to listen for the sound again.

But the sea was a cruel trickster. Every so often, just as his mind began to wander into daydreams, he caught it again: a faint chorus, rising and falling with the swell, singing as though from just beyond the next wave. Always distant, never close enough to pinpoint.

It was worse than if it had been loud.

By nightfall, the sky was ink-black and the sea turned reflective, the yacht bobbing in darkness. James lit the navigation lamps, their glow painting the deck in weak red and green. The world shrank to the size of his vessel; everything beyond was void.

He sat in the cockpit, flashlight on his lap, and let exhaustion seep into his bones. Alone. Utterly alone.

The voices came back stronger in the night.

This time, he could almost hear words, fragmented, elongated, warped by the vast emptiness around him. He thought he heard ring around the rosie… but slower, slurred, and punctuated by whispers.

James clamped his palms over his ears. “Stop,” he hissed. His heart drummed against his ribs. “There’s nothing out there.”

The boat creaked, and for a split second he thought he heard footsteps above him, light, rapid, like children chasing each other across the deck. He snapped his flashlight on and swung it across the yacht. White beam cutting through mist. Nothing. Just the wet gleam of varnished wood, ropes coiled neatly, sails swaying overhead.

He laughed shakily. “You’re losing it, James.”

Still, he locked the cabin door when he went below.

Inside, the Seabird’s cabin felt claustrophobic. The walls were close, the air thick with diesel and salt. James lay in the narrow berth, boots still on, eyes fixed on the ceiling. The rhythmic slap of water against the hull was soothing, almost hypnotic.

Until it wasn’t.

A new sound joined the water’s lullaby. Tap. Tap. Tap.

He froze.

It was coming from outside, against the hull. Like small hands drumming on the wood. Too light to be debris, too deliberate to be chance.

He sat up, every muscle tight. “Waves,” he told himself. “Just waves hitting the side.” But even as he whispered it, the tapping continued, slow and deliberate, circling the cabin from one side to the other.

As though something was walking along the outside of the boat.

James grabbed his flashlight and climbed back up to the cockpit, breath steaming in the air. He swept the beam across the deck, into the water, across the sails. Nothing. Just endless sea, rolling black beneath a sky that had swallowed every star.

But the tapping had stopped.

He stayed above for hours, pacing the deck until his legs ached, straining to catch the faintest sound. He didn’t hear the voices again that night, but he felt them, their absence heavier than their presence, like children hiding in the dark, waiting for him to relax.

He didn’t sleep.

Dawn came reluctantly, pale light bleeding across the horizon. James’s eyes were bloodshot, his face drawn. He brewed another pot of bitter coffee and forced down a slice of bread. The sea was calmer now, smooth swells like the heaving chest of some sleeping giant.

For a few precious hours, there was only silence. He almost convinced himself the voices had been a hallucination, born from isolation, fatigue, the tricks of wind and water.

But then, just past noon, as the Seabird drifted through a patch of fog, he heard them again.

This time closer.

The singing was faint, but clear enough to make out words now. A childish chant, repeated over and over, weaving around the creak of the mast:

“We all fall down…”

The rhyme broke off in a burst of high-pitched giggles. James dropped his cup, hot coffee splashing across the deck. His hands trembled as he stared into the fog, which curled around the boat like grasping fingers.

“Hello?” he shouted, voice cracking. “Is someone there?”

Only silence answered. Then, splash. Something hit the water off the port side. James swung the tiller, straining his eyes. Shapes shifted in the fog, darker patches among the gray. He thought, just for a heartbeat, that he saw a small figure bobbing in the waves. A child’s head, hair plastered to pale skin, mouth open in a grin.

He blinked, and it was gone.

The voices erupted again, louder this time, circling the yacht.

James stumbled back, chest heaving. His pulse thundered. “Not real,” he whispered. “Not real, not real.” But his hands were already clenching the flashlight like a weapon, his eyes darting at every sound.

Something brushed the hull again, dragging, scraping, like fingernails trailing across wood.

He thought of shipwrecks, of the drowned, of stories he had half-listened to in bars about sailors lost at sea, bodies never recovered. The idea clawed at him: what if the children were real? What if they were still here?

The fog thickened, swallowing the horizon. The sea became a blind labyrinth, every sound magnified, distorted. James’s mind spun. He gripped the tiller and forced the Seabird forward, praying the fog would break.

But the voices stayed with him.

Hi! I need to decide where to move my family of 8 to rather quickly and I need your help. We aren’t “just testing the waters,” we are wanting to put our home on the market March 1. My wife and I took a 4000 mile roadtrip from Aug to Oct looking where we wanted to end up. We currently live about 25 min outside of Charlotte on 13 acres. We find Charlotte lifeless and hate the humid summers and the VERY rainy winters. Here’s what we’re looking for.
While we would love another large acre parcel, we know that most of the states we are looking at may make that unreasonable. We would love 3+ acres min. 
During our trip, we were looking in CO, OR, CA, and VA. 
-Because we have adult seniors to account for, we need to have access to decent healthcare within a short distance (not an hour or more away). 
-Will not be where it rains the majority of the time, ie. PNW. Charlotte rains all winter: yuck
-We need decent job access for service industry as well as manufacturing for CNC machinist
-Because we have 4 people in the mid twenties, they need community
-We want to be within 45-60 min of a larger city to get the benefits of entertainment
- No desert environment
- Weed legal
- Politically blue
- Ideally, we live in/around a medium size city 100,000-ish population so we still have activities very close like coffee shops, yoga, cute downtown, live music, etc without driving the hour into the large city. 
- Outdoor centric cities would be our preference 
We LOVED the Bend area but the reason we marked off Bend was the healthcare issue. We’d have to drive to Portland and that’s way too far. SO sad we had to mark it off. 
Kids don’t love Colorado but it’s still on the list. Focused more on west of Denver and Fort Collins area. 
We really like Northern California, Redding and cities around Sacramento, etc. 
And probably last on our list is to stay on the east coast in the Richmond-Staunton VA area. 
What are we missing? What cities around these areas (or others!) are solid options?

Thank you! It’s much appreciated.

———

Norna didn’t speak for while as she followed Lucifer she just couldn’t, she temporarily lost that ability for a bit she was so flustered. 
She looked over at the altar curiously,she couldn’t help but notice and love that it held some similarities to the ones she has for her own gods back home. With the fair linen that was spread neatly over it and a nice display of candles on it.She looked up at the perfect rows of endless pews in front of them in the chancel before slowly turning to look around entirely. Just marvelling over its old and meticulously detailed statues that surrounded them and the beautifully crafted stained glass that left a kaleidoscope of colour on the walls, illuminated by the sun. This place was unlike anything she had ever set foot in on Midgard,even she could sense an ethereal presence here that can’t be overlooked. How people who’ve never been to been to heaven managed to captured a glimpse of it from merely a book and passion is incredible. But it’s a great passion even she can relate towards her gods. It’s crazy and kinda sad that the list of similarities grew between the two practices yet they’re still worlds apart.When she finally faced Lucifer her face went bright red, her eyes again taking in his appearance.Blissfully bringing her back to reality, she smiled shyly, he’s just too gorgeous for his own good. While still giddy over the nickname at least she had enough time to find her voice again“It’s really pretty” she said, almost begrudgingly. She hated to say it, but it’s the truth, this place is truly breathtaking. The whole cathedral is an entire altar of art.

And here is my more shorter and common response.

————-

Tony laughed “Can’t tell you that! It’s supposed to be secret” he teased, the corners of his mouth curling with a mischievous charming smirk. If only Ava knew. He’s the furthest from working with the FEDS. He’s their worst nightmare. A phantom in a tailored suit, who basically has the city lassoed in a chain made of his threats and bloodstained promises. The kind of man whispered about in precincts, like a monster parents scare their kids straight with “So what’s new with you?” He asked, trying to steer the subject away from his work.

First off, thank you so much to everybody’s support in this community. I was really scared to start this medicine and have been in denial and have been trying to rawdog my anxiety for quite some time. I have health anxiety and went through something traumatic which caused me to have frequent panic attacks and exacerbate my anxiety.

I am 19 days into my journey so far — 7 days being 12.5mg and now 12 days being 25mgs. I feel such relief. It took about 10 days for symptoms to subside. About a week ago, 14 days in I started to incorporate coffee back into my diet. The first few days I had bad anxiety and a terrible headache, but drink half of what I normally do and make sure I eat and hydrate first.

My question is: For those who drink alcohol and do edibles, when did you incorporate these back into
 your diet? I have a date with this person I’m into in a few days and I’m wondering if I’d be okay having a glass of wine. By then I will be 16 days in on 25mg and 22 days overall. So a little over 3 weeks. I’m naturally a lightweight and don’t drink often at all for context.

James had lashed the tiller and let the yacht drift, unwilling to leave the cockpit despite the icy wind that cut through his jacket. Sleep was impossible. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw that pale head rising from the waves, the grin carved too wide, too eager.

The fog had not lifted. It hugged the *Seabird* like a cocoon, erasing distance, smothering light. Beyond the glow of the navigation lamps, there was nothing, only gray thickness, swallowing sound and shape.

And inside that blankness, the voices prowled.

Sometimes they sang; other times they whispered. He caught fragments: “…come play…,” “…don’t hide…,” “…we see you…” They never came from the same place twice. One moment they seemed beneath the deck, the next they floated above the mast, the next they giggled from directly behind his ear.

James spun, flashlight stabbing the fog. Always empty. Always nothing.

By midnight, his nerves frayed like worn rope. He was shaking, not just from cold but from the constant anticipation, the waiting for something he could neither see nor fight. The sea, once a place of calm rhythm, had become a stage for phantoms.

At some unknown hour, time dissolved in fog, he heard a new sound.

A splash. Then another. Then the rapid *slap* of water against the hull, as though many hands were striking it in unison. James’s heart lurched. He leaned over the side, flashlight beam skittering across the black surface.

Shapes moved in the water. Small, pale, darting just beneath the surface. He caught glimpses: a tiny hand breaking the waves, a head turning toward him with eyes open and shining unnaturally white.

“God…” James staggered back, gripping the mast to steady himself.

The shapes circled the yacht. Laughter bubbled up from the water, impossible, muffled and yet clear. High-pitched giggles, as if dozens of children were treading water around the *Seabird*, delighting in his terror.

Then came the *thud*. Something heavy struck the hull from below, jolting the boat. James stumbled and fell to his knees. Another thud, this one on the starboard side. Then again on port. The yacht rocked violently, as though battered by submerged bodies.

“No!” His scream cracked across the night. “Leave me alone!”

For a heartbeat, silence. Then, from all around, in perfect unison:

*“We all fall down.”*

The chant swelled, overlapping, louder and louder, until James clapped his hands to his ears and curled into himself, teeth bared in a grimace. The sound wasn’t only in the air, it vibrated through the hull, through the mast, through his own bones. The *Seabird* seemed to shiver with it.

He didn’t remember passing out.

When James opened his eyes, weak daylight seeped through thinning fog. His body ached from the hard deck, his throat raw from shouting. The boat was steady. The sea calm.

Had it happened? Or had he finally broken under the weight of exhaustion?

He forced himself below deck, brewing instant coffee with shaking hands. The bitter taste was grounding, though not comforting. He stared at the compass, needle steady, pointing east toward Norway. Land was still two days away. Two days of this.

His radio sat on the cabin shelf. He stared at it, torn. He could call for help, but what would he say? That he was being haunted by drowned children? That the sea was singing nursery rhymes? They’d think he’d gone mad.

But wasn’t that what was happening?

He gripped the radio mic, thumb hovering over the button. Static hissed softly. He imagined a voice answering, human and steady, dragging him back into the sane world. The thought was almost painful.

He pressed the button. “This is the *Seabird*. Anyone copy? Over.”

Static.

“Seabird to any vessel, I need assistance. Over.”

The static crackled louder, then softened. And then, laughter.

James dropped the mic as though it burned. High-pitched giggling spilled from the speaker, distant but unmistakable.

“No… no, no, no.” He slammed the radio off, heart pounding. He was cut off, the voices tainting even the lifeline meant to connect him to the world.

He was theirs.

That afternoon, the fog finally broke. The sea spread wide again, stretching into a clear horizon. James should have felt relief, but instead dread rooted deeper. The fog had hidden them. Now the children, whatever they were, had nowhere to hide.

He scanned the water constantly, eyes gritty, head pounding. Every whitecap, every swell looked like a pale face. He began muttering under his breath, nonsense phrases, anything to fill the silence.

The singing didn’t return until dusk.

It started soft, a single voice, no more than a hum. It drifted on the wind, fragile but insistent. James froze, one hand on the tiller. He knew ignoring it was useless, but acknowledging it felt like surrender.

The hum turned into song, the words clear now:

*“Row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream…”*

The irony made bile rise in his throat. He spun in place, scanning the horizon. Nothing. Just sea and fading sky.

*“…merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily…”*

The voice multiplied. Two children. Four. Six. A choir building, surrounding him.

*“…life is but a dream.”*

The last note stretched impossibly long, the pitch warping into something inhuman, vibrating through the rigging. James clapped his hands over his ears, but the sound drilled deeper, inside his skull. He dropped to his knees, teeth rattling, vision swimming.

Then silence.

James gasped, chest heaving. His ears rang. The boat rocked gently, as though nothing had happened.

But the dread didn’t fade.

He knew they were closer now.

That night brought the worst yet.

James had retreated below deck, lantern burning, knife clutched in one trembling hand. He sat hunched on the berth, back to the wall, listening. Every creak of the hull, every sigh of the sea was an omen.

Hours dragged. His eyelids grew heavy. He dozed.

And then the cabin door rattled.

His eyes flew open. The knife slipped in his sweaty grip. The latch jiggled, again and again, as though someone small was tugging on it, testing it.

James held his breath, muscles taut, eyes locked on the thin wood.

The jiggling stopped. Silence.

Then, tap. Tap. Tap. Right above his head. Footsteps. Small, light, scampering across the deck.

His pulse roared in his ears. He forced himself to stand, every nerve screaming. He reached for the lantern and crept to the companionway.

He pushed the door open.

The deck was empty.

But wet footprints trailed across the wood. Tiny. Bare. Leading from bow to stern.

James stumbled backward, bile rising. He swung the lantern wildly, light spilling across the boat. Nothing. The prints glistened, then began to fade as though licked away by the air.

And then he heard it.

A child’s voice. Right behind him.

“Found you.”

James spun, knife raised. The lantern swung with him, its flame flaring. The cabin entrance yawned dark. Empty.

His breathing came ragged. He felt eyes on him, dozens of them, just beyond the edge of the lantern’s glow. Watching. Waiting.

The boat shifted suddenly, a violent lurch. James slammed against the rail, knife clattering to the deck. The *Seabird* tilted as if something massive had shoved it from below. Wood groaned, water sprayed. He grabbed the rail, knuckles white.

Another impact, harder. The mast shuddered, sails snapping. The yacht rocked dangerously, one side dipping toward the sea.

And then hands. Pale, wrinkled, too small. Dozens of them gripping the edge of the boat, fingers curling over the rail, pulling. James screamed, yanking at the lantern to see.

The flame flickered across faces rising from the water. Children’s faces. Bloated, pale, eyes wide and gleaming like glass marbles. Their mouths stretched in joyous grins, water pouring from their lips. They giggled as they climbed, dozens of them, their voices overlapping in a chorus of play.

“Come play, James.”  
“Stay with us.”  
“Don’t leave.”

Their nails scraped wood as they pulled higher, their bodies slick and dripping.

James stumbled back, heart hammering so hard it hurt. He snatched the lantern and hurled it.

Flame exploded across the rail, oil splashing onto the nearest figures. For a moment, firelight blinded him, then the children shrieked, a sound that pierced like knives. They dropped back into the sea, hissing, giggles dissolving into shrill wails.

James collapsed to his knees, sobbing, ears ringing from their cries. The boat rocked, then steadied. Silence returned.

The rail was charred. The sea, once again, empty.

But James knew this wasn’t victory. It was only a reprieve.

I’ve been dealing with something that’s honestly scared me a lot, and I wanted to see if anyone here has gone through something similar.

A bit of background: I’ve always eaten a lot of spicy food, and a few years ago I ended up with stomach ulcers because of it. Then last year I got dengue, and after that my digestion never fully went back to normal. I was on strong medication for a while, and ever since then my stomach has felt more sensitive than it used to. Things got much worse this year after I developed the habit of drinking strong coffee on an empty stomach for months. I also became lactose-intolerant after the dengue, so milk or cream makes everything even worse now.

For the last 3–4 months, I’ve been having extreme regurgitation almost every single night. Not just acid but actual food, even hours after eating. Even water and coffee sometimes come back up. It happens whether I’m sitting or lying down. And it’s not small burps, it’s real chunks of food coming up, which hurts when I try to get it out. It’s stressful and honestly gross.

Because of this, I’ve had to stop eating a lot of things:
	•	rice at night
	•	eggs (especially omelettes)
	•	apples or anything with skin
	•	most dairy
	•	heavy gravies
	•	anything too spicy

I’ve also been anxious out of my mind because if you google too much, you start seeing words like “esophageal cancer,” which made me panic. I smoke one cigarette a day (I’ve reduced a lot), and that has added to my fear. I know this sounds dramatic, but it’s gotten to the point where my relationship with food is getting messed up. I’m scared to eat because I don’t know what’s going to come back up later.

I’ve booked a gastro appointment for tomorrow, but before I go, I wanted to ask this community:
Has anyone else had food come back up hours later — not just acid — as part of their GERD or gastritis?
Did it improve with treatment?

Finding this subreddit was honestly a relief, and I’m hoping someone here has been through this and gotten better.

(And yeah, I used ChatGPT a bit to help me frame this clearly.)

I can't think of any other way to describe him. He was friendly enough and usually kept to himself, but he didn’t say much and when he did, it was the weirdest shit ever. So, I didn’t talk to Ethan often. 

He used a whiteboard to communicate, which could get tedious, especially when he took forever to respond.

Yesterday, I was shopping with my mom, and we ran into my English teacher, who, for some reason, dumped Ethan Wilder’s books into my arms.

Apparently, Ethan missed summer school, so Mrs. Caine was on the warpath. 

She didn’t want to visit him directly, and my mother, of course, piped up with, “Oh, yes, Luke would *love* to help out!”

I did say, “No, I’m good.” But both my mother and my teacher collectively agreed that I was doing this, and I had zero choice. It’s worth noting that I’ve already graduated. Ethan was repeating a year, and since I was no longer a student, as well as a fully grown *adult*, I didn’t have to follow my teacher’s orders. 

However, being in the midst of two middle-aged women, with one being my mother, put me at a disadvantage. 

When I pulled a face, Mom called me adorable and tugged my cheeks, which made me want to crawl into a hole. 

Mrs. Caine dumped an entire semester’s worth of workbooks into my arms and then gave me his home address.

It’s the middle of summer, and the sun was baking the back of my neck. I had to walk to Ethan Wilder’s place with zero choice. 

I didn’t even get a fucking reward.

You’d think I’d get cash, but no, according to my mother, it was just a *gesture of goodwill.* 

I don’t have a car, and maybe it was my fault for not asking my teacher for a ride, but by the time I reached Ethan’s house, I was two steps from throwing up.

I had to gather myself on the doorstep. I was soaked through with sweat, and my head felt like it was going to explode. 

Ethan’s place was not what I expected, a regular suburban household with a white picket fence. Maybe I was just being a judgmental asshole, but Ethan didn’t strike me as a Brady Bunch type of son. 

I definitely had a mental image of where he lived, and this was not it.

I think Jake, a guy in my class, once said Ethan lived in the trailer park. I guess I believed him.

Knocking three times on the Wilder family’s door, I just wanted to get it over with. The sun was already setting, and I wasn’t looking forward to the walk back.

Mom disengaged herself from *mom* duties after 6 p.m., so it was my responsibility to make my own way home. 

Now, I know I said Ethan was weird, but I wasn’t expecting him to answer the door with a strip of duct tape over his mouth.

The stench that followed him, and clung to him, was like a physical entity slamming into me. It was a mixture of rotten food and feces. Ethan’s face had grown noticeably thinner, sunken eyes and hollow cheeks giving him a gaunt, almost skeletal appearance. 

His clothes were visibly filthy, with his jeans and shirt clinging to a wiry frame like a second skin. It was the lack of spark, of life, in his eyes, two hollowed-out caverns penetrating right through me, that sent me stumbling back, my heart in my throat. 

Before I could speak, the guy pulled out a roll of duct tape from his pocket and took a stumbled step towards me. 

Without a word, Ethan tore off a single strip, and before I could stop him, he plastered it across my mouth.

What the fuck. 

I didn't know what to say or do. Ethan Wilder was weird. 

But he wasn't *this* fucking weird. 

The moment was surreal and fucking confusing, and I couldn’t understand why I wasn’t running away, instead paralysed, while he glued it in place. 

We were two nineteen-year-old guys, so why did I feel like we were back in kindergarten?

I started to tear it off, but he manically shook his head, reaching for his whiteboard.

“Hi,” Ethan scribbled. “Come in.”

“No, it’s okay,” I said, then remembered my mouth was taped up.

I gestured to his workbooks in my arms, but he ignored them.

“Come in!” he scribbled. “You look like you could use a drink of water :).”

I tried to tear off the tape again, but Ethan stuck it back in place.

“No, Luke,” he wrote down, shoving the whiteboard in my face. “You can’t speak.”

I could see his lips stretching into a grin through the creases in his gag. 

He went back to his whiteboard, scribbling another message. I noticed it took him three tries to write the word *come* before he gave up and just drew a large arrow pointing inside the house. 

I didn’t know what to say. I wanted to laugh, but laughing felt wrong.

I didn’t realize how young and stupid I was, or how much I wanted my mother, until I was standing in front of Ethan Wilder, who wrapped his hand around my wrist and yanked me forward. 

I dropped the books, but he didn’t care, pulling me over the threshold and slamming the door.

Ethan’s grasp was strangely gentle, but I knew if I started tugging away, his nails would start to dig in. I had no choice but to follow him.

*This guy was a fucking psychopath.*

To my confusion, the main hallway in the Wilder household was one big mattress. 

I wasn't expecting it, already stumbling forward. Ethan still had a tight grasp on my wrist, yanking me into the lounge. 

It was what you would expect, a modern family-oriented living room with a couch, a coffee table, and a TV pinned to the wall.

Looking around, something cold slithered up my throat. 

I don't think I registered the walls at first. 

I think my brain skipped over them, maybe on purpose. But once my gaze left the crystal paperweights on the mantelpiece and the family photos, something snapped inside me, like a bungee cord severing, and my gaze was stuck, suddenly, glued to every corner.

**The walls,** I thought dizzily, my thoughts beginning to twitch and contort. I recognized the markings as *writing*, but that's where my brain short-circuited.

All I could see was writing. So much writing, so many markings scrawled into what had been picture-perfect paintwork. 

It didn't hit me until I was moving closer that the words were carved and scrawled and scribbled in dripping, intense scarlet.

But the more I tried to understand what I was reading, I could feel myself sinking deeper. For a disorienting moment, I forgot my own name. 

Then my mom’s name. I forgot why I was there in the first place, and then, after a stumbling step forward that dragged my body towards the walls, phantom fingers twining around my neck, I didn't know who I was. 

These words were pouring into my head and setting my blood alight, numbing my bones. It felt like my mind was being drained, sucked right through my skull by an invisible vacuum. I remember dropping to my knees, as if in prayer. 

But I don't know who I was praying to.

I could sense it in the air, a suffocating presence forcing me into a bow.

It allowed me to lift my head slowly, so I didn't take it in all at once.

And like a puppet, my body obeyed, paralyzed.

The writing on the walls, the indistinguishable scribbles splattered in scarlet, were fucking *talking* to me.

I could hear them, static whispers I couldn't understand bleeding into my skull.

The same words were written, carved, and scrawled in a language that twisted my gut, igniting thoughts and feelings I couldn't comprehend, already twisting and contorting my expression. 

Happiness. 

Joy that wasn't mine, that flooded my brain, tricking me into believing I was feeling pleasure. I was grinning through the duct-tape gag, my lips violently stretched across my face until I could taste blood.

But then there was despair. Pain and anger and pleasure coming together in a cocktail that filled my eyes with tears, my lips parting in a shriek I couldn't swallow.

I didn’t understand the words, and yet my body did.

I had to get out, the thought buzzed in my mind.

I had to get out.

I had to get out.

I had to get out.

I had to get out.  

But then my thoughts were backwards, the words mixing up and together and apart.

I couldn’t move. I couldn't think or breathe. Because my eyes were already reading and re-reading each scarlet word, and, like I was in a trance, I crawled forward, my trembling hands itching to *touch* them. 

I could sense my sharp breaths struggling against my gag, hysterical beads of laughter crawling up my throat. I reached out with trembling hands, pressing the palms of my hands against the writing, carving my fingernails into each indentation. 

I could feel the urge hit me like a wave of ice water, my own fingers twitching, ready to tear into my skin and imprint myself on these walls. 

It was the only way I was going to give back, the only way I could pledge myself to these words. 

Ethan grasped my hand, pulling me to my feet, and my head spun, my identity crashing back into me. 

Blinking rapidly, I shuffled back, swallowing bouts of barf filling my  mouth. 

It wasn't words that were carved into every wall in Ethan Wilder’s living room. It was something else, a language, a *thing* that made me want to scream and claw my hair out, rip the flesh of my bones. It made me feel fucking crazy. 

Reality seeped back into fruition, and I was staring at entrails ingrained into the wall, old red pooling from each marking.

*I was Luke....*

 The thought was delayed, already suffocated. 

*Nineteen years old.*

*I had a Mom, and her name was Iris.*

Ethan pulled me back, and like a doll cut from its strings, I stumbled toward him. 

I barely felt his hand still wrapped around my wrist. 

**“Sorry :)”** I couldn't register what he was writing for a moment, before clarity hit. 

The stink was worse, hanging stagnant in the air, and I had already clawed into my own arm, a single line of red drawn across my skin.  I could barely feel the sting. It felt alien to me, like it wasn't attached to my body. 

Ethan prodded his board, and his writing contorted into shape, actual English. 

**“That was my parents. They made a mess.”**

I nodded slowly, dazedly. I could still feel it, the sensation of drowning wrapped around me, suffocating my senses, slimy phantom hands covering my eyes and snaking into my mouth.

When Ethan twisted around and skipped upstairs, taking the steps two at a time, I followed, like something bound us together. 

I was half aware of my mind screaming at me to run. But the rest of me, polluted thoughts and contorted words, wanted to go further into the Wilder house. 

I started up the staircase, one by one. The walls upstairs were covered in writing too. 

**GET OUT.** 

**SAVE MY BABY. GOD. SAVE MY BABY. SAVE MY BABY. SAVE MY BABY.**

I could see the writer's slow descent into insanity through every warning. When I reached the top, I stepped on something that squelched through my toes. I didn't remember taking off my shoes and socks.

When my gaze found the floor, I was standing in something writhing, a slimy red substance pooling across the cream carpet. The smell hit me again. 

Putrid and thick. But I could barely register that somehow, it was moving, sinking into the flesh of my feet, bleeding into my blood. 

Part of me wanted to jump back, while this severed puppet version of me was swaying back and forth, while phantom hands tried to pull me back onto my knees. 

Ethan held up his whiteboard, and I steadied myself. **“Mom gave birth to my little sister right here.”** 

His words twisted in and out of view, blurring together. 

They became numbers, then letters, then numbers, and then *blank*. 

Ethan tugged me down the hallway, and I finally met his parents. Mr. and Mrs. Wilder looked like they *might* have been normal. 

Mrs. Wilder was still wearing her wedding ring. 

Through my foggy vision, all I could see were two unmoving, skin colored figures standing in front of the wall, and in one sudden, jolting movement, they started to writhe, flailing, like performing an interpretive dance. 

Ethan’s parents were completely naked, their skin ridged and wrinkly. Mrs Wilder was pulling out her entrails and smearing them across pretty pink paint. 

Mrs. Wilder’s mouth was stretched wide, a grotesque, horrific grin, like she was laughing, but only gasps of breath escaped her lips. Her laughter was silent, fingers carving those exact same words on the downstairs walls. 

The severed part of me could *understand* this unearthly, inhuman urge they had to replicate these words, carving and drawing them into every surface, everything that *could* be drawn on. 

The bedsheets were covered in nonsensical scribbles, the carpet torn into and shredded, bearing each symbol, which were slowly burning themselves into my entangled brain. 

The more I looked at them and tried to figure them out, I wanted to copy them until my fingers were bleeding, and then I would use *myself*. 

That sudden, poisonous thought was enough to bring me back to reality. 

Ethan had a tight hold on my arm, his fingers digging into my flesh, choking up the shriek building in my throat. 

I caught a glimpse of a twisted, unsettling grin that flashed across his face, contorting back to fear and pain. 

His eyes were hollow and crying out, and then they were empty caverns glittering lunacy I didn't think possible. 

The guy jumped up and down on his heels. I could see his grin through the tape, growing wider, more and more maniacal. 

Whatever Ethan Wilder had been fighting, he had lost. **“Do you want to see her?”** he asked, writing on the whiteboard.

“Her?” I spoke through the tape, my voice no longer mine. 

Ethan responded with wide, blinking eyes, jumping up and down like a toddler. 

His shirt rode up, revealing that twisting, contorted script carved into the flesh of his stomach. Even his face. 

Looking closer, real close, I could see scars where he'd marked himself, slicing each blank letter onto his own skin. 

Ethan, with barely contained excitement, kept shoving his whiteboard in my face, furiously scribbling with his pen.

I managed to take two steps back, but by now it felt like I was stuck in quicksand. 

My legs were trapped, frozen in place. 

Ethan held up his whiteboard, and every word he scrawled looked and felt physical, like it was skittering across the surface. 

**“When my sister was born, the nurse who delivered her ripped out her own eyes.”** He wrote, before erasing it with his sleeve. Ethan’s eyes were frenzied, like he was enjoying himself. 

**“The people in black told us she would turn our town mad.”**

Another step back, and I was struggling to breathe. 

**“They put her to sleep! And they refused to take her away, because they were scared of her. So they left her with us :(.""**

Ethan held up his whiteboard, hiding behind it.

**""The wall sickness took Mom and Dad. It made them want to wake up my little sister.”**

He erased that, and continued scribbling. **“I was scared of her and what it did to my parents, Luke! I didn't want to get the wall sickness too! Mom and Dad were too loud, and I had to be QUIET.”**

Ethan dramatised his words with a finger to his taped up mouth.”

He erased that, and added, **“So, I cut out their voices and stitched them back up! Everything had to be quiet. That's what the people said.”*""

He tipped his head to the side, and I heard an unmistakable laugh muffle through the tape. 

**“THEN I STARTED TO READ THE WORDS ON THE WALL andandand :)))))))”** 

His words started to shift and twist together, mimicking the words on the wall. 

Ethan was giggling through his gag when he pushed me through another door. 

I didn't realize how many doors were in the house. I counted two upstairs, but when Ethan was shoving me through one at the end of the hallway, I counted six. 

There were *six* doors. 

The room I stumbled into, Ethan by my side, was a nursery. 

Mrs Wilder had decorated the room a light purple, pastel colors blending together. 

I found myself in front of a crib, a tiny bundle of entangled blankets.

But there was no baby, only empty space bleeding between the cloth. The more I stared and looked for it, there was nothing, and in the nothing was *something*, but I couldn't *see* it.

I choked on my own hysterical shriek of laughter. I reached out and touched the blankets, touched the oozing space between the blankets and thin air, and the nothing in-between. 

It was that nothing, that snapped something inside me. 

I was already laughing, already tearing at my face, already being forced to my knees to pray. Ethan finally ripped the tape off his mouth. “I want you to do it,” he whispered, his words collapsing into tangled gibberish. 

I could feel my own tongue already contorting, ancient words dripping from my swollen mouth. 

But I swallowed them down.

Ethan let out a single shriek of laughter. **“I want you to wake Lula up!”**

I could sense myself already giving in to the walls. 

The six doors that were expanding into seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve–

But then it let go of me. 

Slowly, I sensed it, *felt* it detach itself from my mind. 

I could think again. 

Breathe again. 

Ethan was still howling with laughter, dancing in circles, and I was moving back. 

I was out of the door before it could grab me again. 

Before it could wrap itself around me, suffocating my brain, I ripped the tape off my mouth, and the sting snapped me out of it. I stumbled downstairs, and out of the door, back into the late evening sun shining in my eyes. 

It was so easy to escape. So easy to turn around and run. 

So, why didn't I in the first place? 

I went home and I went straight to my room. 

I showered and scrubbed myself until my skin was raw. 

I keep looking for the blank language on my skin, because it FEELS like it's part of me. I want to tell Mom about Ethan, but I don't know how to explain what I just saw. 

What almost fucking consumed me, body and mind. 

Please, someone tell me what the FUCK I just witnessed, because I think I'm going mad. 

Mom asked me what the markings are on my arm, but the last time I looked, I didn't have any. 

Now I do. There's a single word carved into my skin, and I can't read it. 

I can't fucking read it, and it's driving me crazy. 

It makes me want to write it until I can understand it. Until I can comprehend it. I've already scratched it into my dresser, and then my own walls. But the words, or ‘words’ still don't look right. 

Maybe if I try a different angle. I'll carve into my ceiling next. 

I need to understand them. I don't think Ethan did. 

I think that's why he ended up like that. 

Please help me understand what I saw, I'm fucking terrified. 

Edit: Can you also help me understand why there are two extra doors in my house?",5,1764793876.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The wind was whistling through the exterior corridor, carrying with it the gentle rustling of tree branches from the forest stretching behind the motel. The lights hanging at the ends of the hallway were dangling mindlessly, barely making any difference in the quickly decaying daylight. Harris was bent over the railing, staring blankly at the road ahead. He didn't even bother to look at the cars that passed every once in a while, just letting the cold breeze smoke the cigarette between his fingers. After his small fit, him and the Sheriff tried to collect every piece of information that seemed useful from that wretched house. After walking around the lower level for a while, dusting the place for fingerprints and picking up small objects to be sent to the Morgantown PD lab, they gathered their courage to go upstairs. They broke every rule in the book and Harris knew that. But he also started to feel like no one actually cared for it except himself. After witnessing the bloodbath in the kitchen, he felt like he started feeling more at ease for whatever this case could throw at him. And he would have done anything to not have to see that scene anymore.

Luckily, the upstairs looked more normal, judging the circumstances. No red stains or... pieces, that is. Besides the mostly non-existing roof, and the wood poles that lay broken on the bathroom and bedroom floors, the place looked remarkably intact. In the coat that was still hanging to the closet knob in the bedroom he found Dean McConnell's wallet, with ID and money still inside. He also found the small safe tucked away behind the large wood desk, which was untouched. After putting the desk back in its place, Harris checked the leather-bound notebooks that were laying on it. One of them was full of recipes, one contained small mementos, phone numbers of close relatives, passwords and what-not. The third one wouldn't have caught the Deputy's attention normally. After hastily checking a couple of pages, he noticed the tone of the writing was very mundane, and at times the handwriting was barely legible, as if McConnell was talking to himself. Most probably a diary, Harris thought to himself. He then noticed the timestamps. Recent timestamps. The latest entry was on January 29th, which Pineville S.D. estimated as the date the murder happened.

Harris winced when he felt the sudden burning sensation in his fingers. The light in his cigarette was already way past the filter line. He rubbed the butt on the corridor railing and threw it in the standing ashtray beside him, and went inside his room. He took a long look at the state of the place. The rancid, moldy stains on the ceiling, the translucent windows not made so by design, but lack of care, the carpet that he suspected was older than him, and the bedsheets that embodied the very essence of beige. He looked at the notebook on the small metal table by the window. While the rest of the evidence was now probably in the Sheriff's office, Harris insisted he take the diary for further inspection. He checked his wristwatch: too late to phone his wife. And he knew that sleep was a distant wish that couldn't be fulfilled. Not tonight. Not after what he saw. So he sat down at the metal table, and opened the notebook.



January 22nd

Finally, I'm here. Drive to the cabin felt endless, especially once I crossed the county line. Who would have thought there would be so much traffic going to West Virginia in the middle of winter? I appreciate the care that we always had when leaving the cabin, though. Every time we came back everything was in order. I hate the feeling of entering a house that remained unoccupied for longer periods of time. Things tend to be out of order, as if the mere absence of people dirties the place.

As suggested by doctor Rodriguez, I am writing this journal as a way to unload my thoughts and emotions. She suggested that I come here for a few days, write everything that goes through my mind. Or what goes through OUR mind. She didn't specify whether I should address these messages to myself, or imagine that I am talking to someone else. I'll just see where this leads.

Come to think of it, this might be part of the exercise. Maybe writing it the way I feel in the moment and addressing it much the same will help ease these feelings. Anyway, I am pretty tired now, it's been a long day. I'll go fix up the gas tank under the stove and get something going. Bought some essentials down at the grocery store on Main Street, and I'm feeling steak with green peppercorn sauce for tonight. Probably going to go straight to bed afterwards. So bye, journal, I guess?



January 23rd

03:12 AM

I can't fall asleep. I tried to force myself, and even though I feel like my eyes are going to melt away, I can't actually push myself over the edge. I just rolled around in bed for a few hours, struggling between freezing outside of the blanket and sweating profusely under it. I should have brought my laptop, even though doctor Rodriguez convinced me otherwise. She said it would distract me, cloud my thoughts. Cabin never had a TV, at least as far as I know, and only brought one book with me. Not a very good choice, tried reading a few pages, but it doesn't seem my style. So I guess writing is my escapism this night. Decided it might be better to write down the time for each entry in the journal. That way I can keep track of my thoughts. Doc said to let myself flow over the pages. She said to write about day-to-day life, but most importantly to write about what I feel deep down. About what bothers me, what hurts. But it's hard to do it. Never really opened up about these things to anyone. Baby steps, Dean, baby steps.

Tomorrow I'm planning to do some setup around the house. Or today, rather, I forget what time it is. I should unpack my bags, sort out the boiler for the hot water, bring out the wooly blankets from the storage room, setup the kitchen. Planning on improving some recipes that I've been working on for a while. I hope I can add that duck confit with blackcurrant reduction and cedar-infused rosemary to the menu when I get back to the city. But that's a problem for tomorrow. Or today. I'll try to go back to bed.

04:47 AM

I keep thinking about her. I miss her, so much. I know that's normal, but I just can't really accept it. I know it happened, but I don't want that. I don't want it to be true. I just wish I could pinch myself and wake up from this nightmare. I would even try to go to sleep with the hope that through some weird dream logic I could get back to the real world. To wake up next to her, watch her sleep peacefully next to me, like I've watched her so many times before. I don't know how to express it, it just feels like this huge pressure in my chest, and whatever I do, it just doesn't go away. I go to the restaurant and drown myself in work, trying as much as possible to avoid going back home. I stopped video calling my mom because of the fear of seeing her look at me with those sorrowful eyes. I just wait for her to check up on me, and I am tired of hearing the pity in her voice when she asks me how I'm feeling, knowing fully well how I'm feeling. I go shopping for ingredients and try to smile back to the cashiers, but it just doesn't work. I know this might seem like the weirdest thing to pinpoint, but it feels so weird right now. It is such a natural thing, smiling. Pretending to be happy, to be content. I feel like I can't even pretend anymore.

I never would have believed I would end up here. Even when the doctors told us the diagnosis, I couldn't even imagine. In my head, the plan was simple. Lots of TLC. She would take the sick leave, I can support the both of us. A bunch of procedures, X-rays and what-not, until the chemo started. Even when it was close to the end, and I was standing on the edge of that hospital bed, holding her feeble hand, watching the color drift from her face over the days. I still had all the hope in the world, because even in those moments she would smile, tell me that she is feeling somewhat better, and that she loves me. She always was the more optimistic of the two of us. She was weak, yes, but didn't it work like that? The treatment attacks the tumor, but it also attacks the rest of the body. And then everything will be fine. Right? When it finally happened, I wasn't even fully aware of it. The doctor warned me that the treatment wasn't really working to plan, and that the disease was most likely spreading again. But during the day-to-day trips she seemed... okay. She was moving more, talking more. She wasn't eating, she said the chemo was killing her appetite. She tried having a few mouthfuls of the food I brought with me from the restaurant. She said she could never pass on my ragu. I couldn't, or wouldn't, recognize the light that was slowly fading from her eyes as the weeks dragged on. In the very end, I think she just let go. Gave up. Whenever I close my eyes at night, I picture her in that final moment. Her green eyes, so full of joy and candor, now turned dull. Her face thinner, her almost transparent skin wrapped tightly around her cheeks. She pressed on my hand to tell me to get closer. She could barely even whisper. I still don't know what those few last words said, before she closed her eyes.

08:03 PM

Cooked the duck. Still not there yet, sauce is too sweet, needs more acidity. Shouldn't put lemon though, maybe I can try a bit of balsamic. As you can see, I didn't really have time for writing today. Or, as I can see. Still not sure how to address this. Did a bunch of stuff around the house, and after I was done with the prep work for the recipe I really felt like having a break. Went for a walk down the holler, almost reached the old Company Store before it started getting dark. Got back up the moment I saw the light dimming. No electrical lighting on the holler, and I don't really want to take the chances of getting face-to-face with a wolf.

Last night I fell asleep writing, basically passed out. Woke up around 11:00 AM, feeling even more tired. But I couldn't sleep anymore, my back was hurting again.

I found the old radio while looking through the living room cupboards, I completely forgot about this. It was nice having something to listen to while cooking, even if there are only two stations available and one of them is mostly static. Hopefully it will help me feel less lonely these days.

I should probably head to bed now, it's been a long day, and I feel like I will have more luck with the sleep tonight.

Was right about the sleep. Most restful night I've had in the past few months. Found a half-full bottle of maple syrup while looking for the coffee pot. Going to whip up some pancake batter and fry some bacon in its honor.

Just got back from town. Had to pick up a few things for the carbonara tonight. Pineville isn't really known for its guanciale, but I guess some garlic cured ham will do. No Italians around here to judge. Also met Otis, the Deputy. He told me there was a blizzard warning, supposedly it will hit tonight. He asked if I wanted to get a room at the motel, on the house, but it's more comfortable here. After the talk with him, I went back to the grocery store to double down on the food and household supplies. Now I have enough toilet paper and batteries to last a full winter.

10:47 PM

Well, Otis was right about the blizzard. It's hailing ass outside, and the wind beating against the side of the house is almost deafening when staying in the kitchen. It's weirdly calm, though. The whirring and beating sounds help muffle my thoughts. I'll do some reading before going to bed.



January 25th

06:22 AM

Just got done talking to Otis, he wanted to see if I was ok. Called the police last night, something weird happened. Most probably some punk kids snuck around the cabin, trying to scare me. I was downstairs in the kitchen. Even though the blizzard is still ongoing, there was a timeframe of about one hour when the wind was more gentle, and I could see the thick snowflakes landing more peacefully in the total darkness outside. At some point, I heard some ruffling outside. I turned off the radio and got up, put my ear against the wall, pretty close to the front door. I didn't hear anything for a few moments, but then it came again. I was pretty sure it sounded like footsteps.

I peeked through the curtains of the kitchen window, but couldn't see anything. I waited a couple of minutes, but couldn't hear anything else, so I turned the radio on again, went back to the crossword puzzle I had laying on the table. It's quite weird when you are focused on something, and then you pull back from it, even for a split-second, you realize that some things you were internalizing as being part of your own mind are coming from outside. That's what happened to me after I looked up from the puzzle, considering if I should pour a glass of wine. I realized that a specific rhythmical beat that I was hearing was not coming from the song on the radio. There was beating on the cabin's wall. \*Bang\* and then a moment of silence, followed by another \*bang\*. It was the sound of something small, but hard, hitting wood. I turned the radio down. The sound came again.

\*bang\* pause \*bang\*

\*bang\* pause \*bang\*

These mountains are full of wolves, bears, deer and other game meat. But they don't usually venture close to towns, even the more isolated hollers, like this one. Never heard of a bear beating on a house trying to get in around here. And they for sure cannot maintain a rhythm like this. There was a person outside of my house.

I listened for a few more seconds. I didn't turn off the radio, I didn't want to let the intruder know I was aware of their presence. And I realized the beating was now coming from the kitchen wall, and was slowly making its way towards the front of the house. As it turned the corner, the beating picked up the pace, just a bit. Just barely perceptible. There was a \*bang\* every few inches along the wall, and I was following it, pacing carefully to not let the floorboards creak beneath me. The moment the beating reached the window to the left of the front door, it took a brief pause before resuming on its other side. What I thought was weird in that moment, what I still think is weird, is that I couldn't see any shape or shadow in that moment. The curtains here are pretty thin, and normally you would be able to see the shape of another person walking outside, even at night.

\*bang\*

The door resounded.

\*bang\*

I could feel a slight increase to the force of the knock.

\*bang\*

I walked up to the door and carefully lifted the visor. I couldn't see anything, too dark. I should have left the porch light on. Or maybe the person knocking was crouched beneath the visor.

\*bang\*

I could feel the force of the knock at the height of my chest. Without realizing it, I knocked back.

There was a pause, and then it came.

\*bang\*

I hit again.

\*bang\*

\*bang\*

I knocked harder.

\*bang bang bang\*

\*bang bang bang\*

I thought the guy must be mocking me. I yelled ""Hey! Stop that!"".

The knocking stopped. I put my ear against the door. I waited for what felt like a good few minutes. And then

""Hey!""

The voice on the other side was quite high. Sounded clean, but somehow unsure. ""Who are you?"" I asked.

""Hey!"" it sounded a bit deeper, a bit more raspy than before. ""What do you mean hey? I asked who are you!"" I yelled back. ""Hey! Hey! Hey!"" I could hear the three words coming from different sides of the door. There wasn't just one guy.

""Get out of here, before I call the police!""

""Stop that!"" said one of the voices.

""Hey! Get out of here!"" said another.

Those guys must have been crazy or something. There was a barrage of sounds coming from the other side of the door, and the knocks resumed, now even more intense. I could barely hear Sheriff Waylon's voice on the other side of the phone while I asked for a house call. My mind was filled with those voices.

Hey! \*bang\* Get out of here! Hey! Stop! Get out of here! Police! \*bang\* Stop that! Hey! \*bang\* Get out of that! Call the police! I call! Stop! \*bang\* Hey! Get here! Out! \*bang\* Call the police! \*bang\* Hey! Hey! Hey!

The voices stopped soon after I finished the call. I ran upstairs and took the gun from the safe. Locked myself in the bedroom, and hid behind the desk, gun ready. At times, I could hear some sounds outside. What must have been footsteps, followed by the occasional ""Hey!"". What really shook me, however, was that they sounded remarkably similar to my voice now. Not the way you hear your voice in your own head, but the way you hear it on a recording somewhere, and you get disappointed because it never sounds the way you think it sounds, the way you want it to sound.   

Hey! Hey! Hey!

\*bang bang bang bang bang\*

The hard knocks woke me up from the trance I slipped myself into. They sounded tougher, more determined than even the ones before.

""Hey! Dean, you in there?""

I opened the bedroom door and crept down the stairs, looking around the house for any intruders.

""Dean! It's Otis Bailey from the Sheriff's Department! Are you in there?""

I could see the red-blue flashes of a police car peering through the curtains. Looked through the visor on the front door to see the figure of Otis standing on the other side.

Those intruders left before Otis got here, at least from what he told me. He took a good look around the house before knocking on my door. He saw some footprints around the house, which he showed me. There were indeed multiple sets of indents in the snow, circling the house back and forth, but the blizzard started picking up, and the wind was starting to cover the prints with snow. However, Otis pointed out that there was at least one set of prints leading away from the house, up the holler towards the old mine. Told him everything that happened. He assured me it must have been some kids, trying to prank me. I asked how can there be kids out in this kind of weather. He just shrugged. He asked again whether I want to go to the motel in town, but I refused. Apparently the blizzard will keep going for another few days.

Anyways, I'm pretty tired now, and could really go for some food. I'll get started on some breakfast.

12:15 PM

I hate this snow. It's been snowing non-stop for the past couple of hours. It's so cold that I can't even ventilate the place properly. I can only open the windows for a couple of minutes at a time before feeling like I'm freezing. It's especially bad after I cook, and I'm trying to get the smell out of the kitchen and living room. Kate asked me to fix the vent hood last year, when we noticed it wasn't pulling it's weight while frying some sausages. Should have done it then. No way I can fix it now.

02:34 PM

I'm starting to get really bored in here. Maybe I should have taken Otis' offer of driving me to the motel. At least I would be closer to everything else. At least I would get to go to a shop to see some people. It's very lonely being by yourself in the heart of the mountains here. Guess I never noticed it. I always came here with Kate, and it was the perfect getaway after months of work and busy schedules. We could come here, just the two of us, as a sort of romantic escape. No people, no responsibilities, just us.

11:17 PM

I spent the last few hours finishing the book I took here with me. Bought it a couple of years ago, when I went to a bookstore in Chicago with Kate. She told me it was her favorite book. I've never been much into horror myself. Read some Lovecraft and King in my sophomore year in high school, my friends were really into slasher movies and the likes. This one was really nice, though, especially the second half. I guess I like cosmic horror more than I thought. I predict that I'll have the image of an old, scrappy-looking wizard trying to fish out a leviathan out of a creek etched into my mind for a long time.

Had quite a lot of wine for dinner, I think I'm going to call it a night.



January 26th

04:15 AM

I just saw Kate in the house.

Of course, I didn't actually see her. It's just that I had the most vivid dream ever. I woke up to get a glass of water from the bathroom, and when I opened the bedroom door I saw her, standing there in the darkness of the corridor, her back towards me. I could see her figure pretty well in the silver moonlight protruding from the window. Her hair was tied in a loose bun, as she usually wore it around the house, and I could see she was wearing the earrings I got her for our first anniversary. She refused to wear any other ones. She said it helped her hear our hearts beating even when we were apart. She always was good with words, had a way of making my heart melt with every compliment.

I could see her hands moving by her side. She was slowly flexing and relaxing her fingers, as if her palms fell asleep. She was testing every finger, going back and forth between them. In that dreamy haze, I called out to her. ""Hey..."" that's all I could think of. I never dreamt of her after what happened. I guess it was a way for my brain to give me a bit of peace, at least while I was sleeping. I could see Kate stiffing her neck, but otherwise didn't move. A few moments later, I heard her respond in my own voice ""Hey!"". Next thing I know, she darted down the corridor into the small storage space next to the bathroom. At the same time, I drunkenly limped back into the bedroom and fell into the bed. At the same time, I woke up, sweating, heart pounding. I just started calming down. Don't think I can fall back asleep though.

08:32 AM

Indeed, couldn't fall asleep again. Still thinking about the dream I had. I guess I didn't want to let the rest of a night's sleep wash away the memory. Despite the almost disturbing setup of the dream, I am happy I can dream of her again. I spent the last few hours thinking of her, of us. Too much to put onto paper. I remember, during one of the first therapy sessions with doctor Rodriguez, she asked me if I could pick one memory of Kate that I loved the most. At that time, I told the doc that I couldn't possibly pick just one memory, that I would take any memory with her, be it good or bad, if that meant I could experience it with her.

Now, I think I finally chose a memory. When we were still quite young, when we had just moved from being friends to a full-on relationship, Kate invited me over to watch a movie at her place. We both laid down on the bed, blankets and stuffed animals all around us. We were stuffed from the homemade burgers we had cooked together. We flipped over the channels, until we landed on an Italian movie. At least as far as I remember, it was Italian. The movie depicted a first date between two people. The intriguing part, though, was that besides the date itself, the movie also showed the dialogues between each person's internal voices, as they were making decisions, thinking about the other person, and so on. The movie was pretty good, and we laughed a lot. I spilled red wine on Kate's bed, and I still hope she forgives me for that, but all-in-all we had a really good time. Even though the movie was a decent comedy, the discussion slipped into a somber analysis of the concept and inner workings of relationships. At that time, Kate was quite a bit more pessimistic than me. Stressful times, being a college student. But I still remember, clear as day, as she looked up at me and said ""It's sad when you think about it. Us, people, being so different from each-other, we are basically incompatible."" After I asked why is that, she said ""Because think about it: people are such evil creatures at their core. If relationships were such a natural thing, then why do you see so much abuse, so many broken marriages, so much suffering all around?"" I think I responded something among the lines of ""Because we are social creatures, and we need one another in the end.""

I kept thinking about that moment every now and then. I think about the certainty of human despise and the uncertainty on the world that reflected in her eyes at that time. And then I think about all the good times we had. I think about every joke that ever made her laugh. About all the places we've been to, and the curiosity and fascination she showed experiencing new cultures together. All the late-night talks about nothing and everything at the same time. All the times we cooked together, dancing to the music in the radio while flipping pans and mixing ingredients. All the times we hanged out with friends, and the knowing looks we gave each-other when we noticed something funny. All the silent moments, with her in my arms, slowly drifting to sleep. And I hope that I helped change her mind. I hope that I made her happy.

11:57 PM

Those damn pranksters came back again. They're knocking on the windows and the door. I think they recorded my voice the other night, they keep yelling in what sounds like my voice. Currently I locked myself in the bedroom, waiting to see if they go away.

11:57 PM

They keep at it. I'm gonna call the police.

11:57 PM

Fucking hell, the phone line must be messed up. Called a few times. The call went through only once, and I could barely distinguish what the dispatch guy was saying.

11:57 PM

This can't be happening!!! This can't be happening!!!

Relax, Dean, it will be fine. You have a gun, the door is locked and the police should be on their way. Any moment now.

11:57 PM

Shit, I think they broke in! I can hear footsteps in the house.

11:57 PM

What the fuck is going on? There is constant knocking on my door. It's too fast, I don't see how anyone could knock on a door that quick. After every burst of knocking, they are calling for me to come outside. It still sounds like my voice. Just what on Earth is happening?

11:57 PM

I can't do it anymore. They must have been going on for hours at this point. I hear rapid footsteps down the corridor, going to the bathroom. Then it comes back, just as fast, followed by bursts of knockings. After each knocking, the voice changes.

It drives me fucking nuts! How can it be?! At some point it sounded like Otis, but I know it can't be him. I would have heard his car come up the driveway, surely. Then it sounds like my mother, and doctor Rodriguez, and my friend Jeremy, and AND AND AND AND.

11:57 PM

I saw one out of the window. It got down on four legs and ran towards the house. It had a mocking imitation of clothing on, morphed to its skeletal body. It looked like a pitiful imitation of us. What the hell are these things? And why did it look like Otis?

11:57 PM

The knocking is getting so hard right now. I can hear them on the roof, trampling. They are trying to get in. They are trying to convince me to come outside. I don't think the cops are coming anymore. They are close to breaking the door down. They have Kate's voice.



January 27th

08:14 AM

Had some cereal this morning, about to head out to fix a leak in the roof, above the porch. It's been driving me crazy these past few nights.

19:03 PM

This day was productive, at least I'm happy about that. Still pretty boring out here. The snow completely covers the road up the holler. But at least the blizzard seems to be over. In a couple of days, I hope they can send the ploughs over here.



January 35th

01:06 AM

No updates, everything is fine at the cabin. Excited to go back into town!

15:89 AM

Must be really nice weather in New York now! I really miss Kate. Can't wait to see her again.

14:11 PM

I remember that time we used to go down to the creek. There was an old coal refinery down there. Remember when we would go down there? We were sitting on the edge of the water, skipping stones. You never were that skilled at it. But you liked seeing the miners work. Would you like to go there again?



January 29th

00:13 PM

Hey! It's Dean McConnell again. Sorry about that.

Everything is fine now. It's a bit warm in the house, a bit concerned for the state of the wood. But at least I got the radio back on. So many new things there. Such educational material. And such interesting voices.



5.

Deputy Harlan Harris leaned back in the creaky desk chair. He looked visibly tired. He read and re-read Dean's notebook since arriving at the Sheriff's Department. Sheriff Thompson was kind enough to provide him with a desk near the far end of the precinct, and Harris' back was hurting from sitting down so long. He got up and lit a cigarette, trying to piece together the information.

Dean sounded like he was in a lot of torment, and his handwriting slowly became more unclear as the pages progressed. He talked about someone harassing him, maybe pranking him, but the later entries point to something far more extreme. Dean thought he wasn't tormented by people by the end of it, he thought he was tormented by creatures. He also mentioned Otis Bailey, Sheriff Thompson's Deputy. He thought one of those creatures looked like Otis. Could it have been Otis? No one saw him since the ordeal, as far as the APB put out was concerned.

Harris thought Dean might have lost his mind halfway during his stay at the cabin, due to the loneliness and emotional turmoil he went through. But still, there must be a way to uncover the truth. He walked away from the desk, his boots hitting the marble floor. As he turned the corner, he saw a fleeting shape sliding into the Sheriff's office. Even though he only saw the person with the corner of his eye, Harris recognized the colors as that of Pineville S.D. A few moments later, as he was walking, he heard Sheriff Thompson's voice booming from his office.

I want to be sure I look after my car and maintain it. I have never been good at this with my old Honda (1st car and passed on by parents) which luckily didn't need much attention - any! I cleaned the outside occasionally not enough, and never checked the car over at all.

I was thinking about creating a box or two for car maintenance with things to help me keep on top of basic maintenance and cleaning etc and to have fun caring for the car.

I would love your thoughts as a complete newbie to taking care of a car - i love my mini it feels more than just a vehicle to get around , so I want to look after it.

So far I have purchased:

* Haynes book
* Castrol 1 liter 5w - 30  - A clear view dipstick for mini
* Cigarette lighter tyre inflator (used previously)
* Maguires, wash and wax, interior quick spray, big microfibre towel and mitt and X rain clean and repel spray.

Thinking about ...

* Tyres - changed my front tyres to normal, so something to deal with issues (back still run flat for now) i will have breakdown too.
* security cameras front and back
* no hose power wash to help with cleaning (live in a flat so no access to water BUT access to electric)
* Anti fog spray - although it's not too bad
* Cover 1/2 or just windscreen for ice/snow
* NEED a windscreen cowl seal as it is cracked

I have also signed myself up to a basic car maintenance course starting in the new year. Apparently I will learn an intro to:

* Maintenance & Replacement of Vehicle Tyres
* Understanding & Servicing Vehicle Brakes
* Conducting a Basic Engine Service
* Engine Ignition System Servicing
* Vehicle Suspension Components
* Vehicle Electrical Maintenance

Update-

Thank you everyone for your replies. Most were good ideas and very thoughtful. I suppose I’ve always had a feeling about the situation and I guess your responses have confirmed my feelings.

she might have a rule that she doesn’t talk shop or she is emotionally drained after work. Both of those could be factors.

since I brought up the mental health issues in the past (with no intension of getting unpaid advice, just friendly advice). That could be why she keeps bringing it up - trying to be a nice friend and empathise. But unfortunately I don’t appreciate this because it feels like she’s getting the gossip for an easy exchange of empathy. This might be my imagination, but it just irks me. In future I’ll try to keep it as vague as possible and switch topics. Of course I could just talk to her about it, but that could make things awkward and I want to keep things fairly ‘clean’ as my kid and their kid are friends.

someone mentioned that they could actually be a crappy psychologist. This could be the case, but I actually think they are ok. In saying that, they wouldn’t be my first choice - but clearly I am now biased!

all of these reasons are why I this person remains in my friend/acquaintance zone. I just don’t think our friendship style is a good match. The vibe is just off.

in future if I meet any psychologists as possible friends. I’ll just ask them upfront if they talk shop and to what extent.if they aren’t open at all, then I can just put them in the cautious friend/acquaintance zone as it clearly makes me feel uncomfortable. Psychology fits too much into everyday life in my opinion and there is too much overlap and I don’t want to spend my time avoiding skirting around boundaries. But I get if they don’t want to go further than brainstorming. - I don’t need/want that from them anyway. .

Original post-

I have a friend/aquaintance my circle who is an adult psychologist. We aren’t heaps close, but we have coffee together every 2 months or so. It’s our kids who are proper friends. My kid has has had some mental health problems over the past few years and I spent years trying to get them diagnosed. The psychologist friend often asks how it’s going, but all they do is empathise with the situation whereas I’ve been more interested in trying to brainstorm what the issue could be. When I talk to my non psychologist friends/acquaintances I find they not only empathise with me, but also try to brainstorm what the issue could be. They often come up with really good ideas which then relay to my kid’s health professionals.

I understand that the psychologist might not what to cross professional boundaries, but that happens in load of professions. There are a bunch of ways to talk around a topic. Eg. Financial advisors might not be able to give advice but they can brainstorm possible investments methods and suggest that i see my financial advisor about them.

Honestly, I don’t actually need advice from the psychologist friend, I’ve actually stopped bringing up the topic over a year a go, but they keep asking me about it. We have a stack of other stuff in common and don’t otherwise run out of stuff to talk about.

Are psychologists more cagey about talking about stuff that relates to their work. What is your experience?",1,1764793374.0,therapists,17,0.67,False

He was a wizard with polish and wax, but when it came to getting customers, we were both completely lost. The term 'digital marketing' felt like this huge, expensive monster. SEO, PPC, Funnels, Analytics... it was a whole other language, and every article I read made me feel dumber.

Then I fell down a Reddit rabbit hole and stumbled upon an old, forgotten comment. It wasn't from some guru selling a course; it was just a regular user laying out a simple, no-fluff plan. The advice was gold: Forget the complex stuff for now. Start with a dead-simple, clean website using a basic WordPress theme. Make it look great on a phone. The goal? Make the phone number and contact form so obvious a monkey could use it. And get good, sexy photos of his work. That’s it.

So that's what we did. Over one weekend, fueled by pizza and coffee, we built it. No fancy features, no blog, just a clean one-page site with amazing before-and-after shots. We put his phone number in the top right corner, big and bold. We added a simple 'Get a Quote' form. It felt way too simple, almost stupidly so. My brain was telling me, 'It can't be this easy.'

The next step in the old comment was to tackle Google Ads, but to think small. Don't target 'Car Wash.' Target 'audi detailing in [our specific town]' or 'headlight restoration [our zip code]'. We scraped together a tiny budget of $10 a day. Launching that first campaign was terrifying; it felt like lighting cash on fire. We watched the analytics like hawks, expecting nothing.

Then, two days later, he got a call. A real, paying customer who found him through our ad. The next week, another. We added Facebook ads, targeting people in our town who liked pages like 'Audi Club' or 'BMW Enthusiasts.' The old Reddit comment even mentioned 'retargeting,' so we used it to show ads to people who had visited the site but hadn't called. Slowly but surely, the calls started becoming a steady stream. My buddy's calendar filled up. It turns out digital marketing wasn't a monster after all; it was just a series of simple, logical steps that this one Redditor laid out perfectly years ago.

There is something for everyone and will not blow out entire paycheck in the process.

Anyway, I put together this whole guide and figured I'd share since I know I'm not the only one stressing about this: [Best Christmas Gifts 2025](https://3dprinteddecor.com/best-christmas-gifts-2025-for-everyone/)

Some stuff that's actually stood out to me:

**Budget picks (under $30):**

* That Tower Stack game is like $10 right now and honestly looks more fun than half the board games I paid $50 for
* Puzzle box for cash gifts - because let's be real, giving cash is boring but sometimes it's the right call

**Mid-range ($50-150):**

* Ember mug is finally on decent sale. My coworker has one and literally won't shut up about it (in a good way though)
* TheraGun Relief is like $110 vs the usual $160. My back is screaming just thinking about it

**If you're feeling generous:**

* That Roomba combo deal at $549 (down from $999) actually seems legit? I've been comparing prices and it's not one of those fake ""was $2000 now $500"" things
* Breville espresso machine for the coffee snob in your life

The guide has a bunch of other stuff too - kitchen gadgets, tech, random stuff like birdhouse kits (which actually seems pretty cool for a DIY gift?).

Main thing I learned: **check those Keepa links before buying anything**. So many ""deals"" that are just regular prices with fake discounts slapped on.

Also pro tip from my own disaster last year - don't buy tech stuff for people unless you KNOW their ecosystem. Don't buy iPhone for an Android-loving sister as she will literally never use it.

English is not my first language and, despite years of use, I still get stuck on the same vocabulary. Often it is a word I already looked up minutes earlier. It disrupts reading, breaks concentration and slows down learning.

I needed a system that keeps the words I encounter visible and organised. I built **iMeanIt** for that purpose, a Safari extension that lets you highlight any word on a webpage, attach a note and recall it instantly on every future visit. Highlights persist across refreshes and sessions. Notes can be exported as CSV for direct use in flashcard tools such as Anki.

All processing stays local in the browser. No tracking, no external servers, no clipboard access. It runs only on static text so it does not interfere with the page.

Although originally designed for English learners, iMeanIt is also available in Turkish, Spanish, French, German, Chinese (Simplified), Greek, Arabic, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Japanese, Korean, Hindi, Dutch, Swedish, Polish, Czech, Danish, Finnish, Hebrew, Vietnamese, Thai, Bengali, Tamil, Malay and Indonesian.

For researchers, students and language learners, it makes reading more efficient. Once a word is highlighted and annotated, it remains available for later recall.

***

**Rookie AI Content Creators: Is the Gold Rush About to Dry Up?! ⛏️😨 (Don't Panic!)**

Hey AiContentAutomators fam!

Anyone else feeling the pressure? Like we're all scrambling to stake our claim in this AI content gold rush *before* everyone else wises up? I know I am! And I've been chatting with a few of you in the DMs, and it sounds like we're all in the same boat.

Thing is, working harder isn't always the answer, right? We need to work SMARTER. So, I wanted to share three tools I've been experimenting with that have seriously helped me scale my content game. These are total game-changers for getting more done without burning out.

Ready to hear?

*   **Tool #1: Your Brain (Yeah, Seriously!)**: Okay, hear me out. Before you reach for ANY AI, spend 15 minutes REALLY mapping out your strategy. What are your goals? Who are you trying to reach? What problem are you solving? The clearer you are on *this*, the better the AI will perform. Think of it as giving your AI a solid foundation. A good plan lets you get more out of all the others tools. What if we all focused on thinking before automating?

*   **Tool #2: The Secret Weapon: (https://easy-peasy.ai/?via=aca) EasyPeasy.AI (Affiliate Link)** I love this one to create engaging content using a simple intuitive interface, it is a great platform to create compelling content. **Disclaimer**: *I may earn a small commission if you sign up via this link. It helps support my late night coffee habit while I test this stuff, haha!*

*   **Tool #3: A Solid Scheduling/Automation Tool**: This isn't *one* specific tool, more of a category. Buffer, Hootsuite, even good ol' scheduling within your social platforms. Automate the *distribution* of your content. No point crafting killer posts if they just sit gathering digital dust. Get them *out there*!

Seriously, those are three tools that have been helping me avoid the burnout. And they're all about working *smarter*, not *harder*.

But here's the real question...

What are *your* go-to tools for scaling? Are there any hidden gems you've unearthed? I'm always on the lookout for new ways to automate and amplify!

I use the Brave browser every day anyway, so when I noticed the built in VPN option, I figured I might as well test it. I was working from a coffee shop at the time and wanted a quick layer of protection on public Wi Fi. It is not free, which is a downside, but having everything in one place felt convenient.

Setting it up was almost instant since it is just a toggle inside the browser. I tried switching locations and checking my IP and everything worked as expected. The speeds were decent too, not the fastest ever but definitely better than the free VPNs I have tried in the past like Tunnelbear or the free Proton plan. The part I am not too thrilled about is that it only protects browser traffic unless you pay extra for the full device version.

I have seen people bring up Brave VPN in free VPN discussions, and honestly, it works fine if you already use the browser and just want basic protection for everyday browsing. If you want something that covers your whole device or works better for privacy or streaming, there are stronger options out there. I am curious how others see it.

Dust motes danced in the lone overhead light above the display of tarnished football trophies. Marcus Thorne, clad in a shockingly bright, red Alabama Crimson tide polo—utterly unsuited for Alaskan weather—paced the room. He had a stack of brochures so glossy they seemed to sweat and a legal pad clutched in a white-knuckled grip.
​“Look, fellas, I flew thirty-six hours—thirty-six!—to get from Tuscaloosa, Alabama, to Kodiak Island,” Thorne grumbled, checking his watch again. “I took a bus, a ferry, and what I’m pretty sure was a snowmobile taxi. I need to get this kid's letter of intent signed and get back before my fingers snap off. Where is this... Mandingo?”

​Ulabar and Uck sat stiffly at a laminate table. Uck, attempting to be subtle, was using a paperback copy of Moby Dick as a coaster for his tepid coffee. They watched the door with the anxiety of men waiting for a bomb to drop.

​The door creaked open, groaning in protest.
​Mandingo Graves entered, carrying his whalebone club, and the small room instantly shrank. He was wearing a tattered, thin Orcas t-shirt, entirely unaffected by the cold, and his sheer bulk seemed to displace the air itself.
​Mandingo’s huge eyes fixed on Thorne’s attire. “Small man smell like flowers and too much running.”

​Marcus Thorne froze mid-pace, the rehearsed, welcoming smile vanishing. He took a hasty breath, adjusting his tie. “Mr. Graves! What an absolute privilege. Marcus Thorne, Alabama Crimson Tide, We are offering you a full-ride scholarship to play quarterback. A four-year commitment to a premier Division I program.”
​Thorne slid a shimmering brochure across the table. It featured pictures of palm trees and a stadium that Mandingo probably could have fit his entire Kodiak village inside.

​Mandingo picked up the brochure, studying it with deep suspicion, then poked a picture of the Head Coach with his massive index finger. “Tiny Ball man. Speak loud?”

​“He speaks very loud,” Thorne assured him, a little too quickly. “And very strategically. We are talking about the SEC, Mandingo. We’re talking about national championships, professional futures, and an education that sets you up for life!”

​Mandingo pointed to the word on the brochure's header. “What is this word? Edu-kay-shun?”

​Ulabar leaned forward, intervening before Mandingo could attempt a physical demonstration of confusion. “He means, what are the primary focuses of the academic program, Mr. Thorne? Mandingo is very goal-oriented.”

​“Right, right. Well, it’s all laid out here,” Thorne said, relieved. “It involves a rigorous academic schedule alongside your football requirements. We need to maintain a 2.5 GPA, pass our core classes... We'll need your transcript and, of course, your SAT or ACT scores.”

​Mandingo’s face, usually set in a fierce earnestness, contorted with genuine panic. He stared at Ulabar. “Scores? Mandingo score touchdowns. Mandingo not score numbers on paper.”

​Uck delivered a swift, hard kick to Ulabar’s shin under the table.
​Ulabar didn’t flinch, but sweat beaded on his temple. “Ah, yes. The scores. Mandingo’s... academic aptitude is currently being assessed through a new, culturally sensitive tribal standard. We are awaiting the official translation. The important thing is his athletic profile. He runs the forty-yard dash in 4.5 seconds. While carrying a whalebone club.”

​Thorne’s eyes, which had glazed over at the mention of the ""tribal standard,"" immediately came alive at the speed. “4.5 at 239 pounds?! That’s… incredible. Listen, we can get him set up with a tutoring team, remedial classes, whatever he needs to be eligible. We just need him to sign this letter of intent. 

This guarantees his scholarship.”
​Thorne presented a folder crammed with legal documents. 

Mandingo picked it up, finding it alarmingly light. “Paper thin. Mandingo use thin paper for fire. Keep feet warm.”

​“No! No, Mandingo, this paper is very important!” Thorne nearly shrieked. “It is promise! It means you come to Southern State! It means guaranteed Ball!”

​Mandingo put the folder down to grab his club. “Promise is in the blood. Paper is for burning. But... you say guaranteed Ball?”

​“Guaranteed, Mandingo. Four years of the best Ball in the nation!”
​A deep, satisfied smile, frightening in its intensity, spread across Mandingo’s face. “Good. Mandingo like guarantee. If Mandingo make many touchdowns, Alabama give scholarship to Ice Tooth?”

​Thorne glanced desperately at Ulabar, who merely offered a small, helpless shrug.
​“We… we have a very competitive veterinary program, Mandingo,” Thorne managed weakly. “The point is, you’re in. You’re our guy. 
Now, tell me about the Anchorage Mammoths next week. What’s your game plan?”

​Mandingo tapped his club against the floor once, the sound echoing sharply and rattling the nearby trophies.
​“Mammoths big. But Mammoths soft. Mandingo run fast like wind spirit. Mandingo hit hard like mountain falling. Mandingo make quarterback run. Then Mandingo make touchdown. No more high school Ball after this. Mandingo go to big Ball place.”

​He grabbed the legal folder, rolled the expensive documents into a tight, ignored scroll, and tucked it casually into his pants like a forgotten fishing lure. He then turned and strode out of the office, leaving Marcus Thorne standing with his jaw hanging open, staring at the empty doorway.

​Uck took a slow, measured sip of his coffee. “Well, at least he didn’t pay you with caribou hair this time.”

​Ulabar stood, retrieving the glossy, crushed brochure from the table. “We have a week to explain what a ‘GPA’ is. And where exactly the nearest glacier is to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, for Ice Tooth.”

And before we even spoke, she had already dropped her Instagram in her bio.

That’s not a social media handle.
That’s a business account.

So I texted her like a gentlemen:
“Hi, how are you?”

She replies:
“Good, you?”

Amazing conversation. Top level. Shakespeare stuff.

Then she asked the most important question of 2025:
“What are you looking for?”

And for once in my life… I decided to be honest.
I said: One night stand.

She replied: FWB.

At that moment, in my head, Arijit Singh started singing.

Then she goes:
“Where do you stay? Alone?”

And I said yes… feeling like a king who just unlocked a DLC pack.

I said: “Let’s meet.”
She: “Ok.”
Me: “My flat?”
She: “Fine.”
Me: “Now?”
She: “Not now. Morning.”

Even the universe was like:
Relax bhai, thand rakh.

Next morning I message:
“What time are we meeting?”

She replied:
“I lettuce know when I get time.”

LETTUCE.

Not “let you”.
Not “let u”.
LETTUCE.

At that point I realised… I’m not in a love story.
I’m in a vegetable market.

No meeting that day.
Next day also no meeting.

But suddenly… we are talking about:
Family
Education
Food
Life
Future

Bro, I didn’t sign up for a biography channel.
I signed up for FWB.

She fully converted me from:
“Future hookup” to
“Emotional support system with no salary”.

Finally I got frustrated and I said:
“Listen yaar, final decision. Are we meeting or not?”

She said she has time tomorrow, after college.

Hope came back.

She then asked:
“Where are we meeting?”

And my clown brain said:
“My flat.”

She asked:
“What will we do at your flat?”

I said:
“Just… spend time.”

She: “Sex?”

Me: “Yes… we literally agreed FWB.”

And then she casually says:
“Actually… I’m seeing another guy. I’m kind of dating him. But it’s okay for you, right?”

MA’AM I’M NOT AN OPTION ON SWIGGY
“Buy one get one free boyfriend”

And after that…
She disappeared.

Ghosted.
Vanished.
Gone.
Offline.
No last seen.
No typing bubble.
Nothing.

One full week… finished… like a bad SIM card.

And the saddest part?
I didn’t get:
No date
No FWB
No hug
No coffee
No closure

I only got:
Experience. Trauma. Character development.

Now whenever I open Hinge…
my phone itself starts overthinking.

At this point…
Online dating feels like searching for drinking water…
in the middle of an ocean.

Does anyone have a recommendation for a decanter of some sort that I can use for my pour-overs?

Ideally glass for insulation, with the same or better control, heat maintenance, and preferably not involving buying a whole new electric kettle or switching to stovetop.
