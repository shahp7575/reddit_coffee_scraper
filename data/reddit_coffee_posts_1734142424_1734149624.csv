I had only one final so I can go home earlier than my roommate. Since I am the one who purchased a new fridge (technically my parents who are also very strict), I wanted to turn it off before I left due to possible leakage, cleaning, etc (and overall, it would just make me feel less anxious knowing my fridge is dealt with by someone I trust aka me) so there would be no damage that would harm the fridge, cause mold, or make my parents angry at me. I told my roommate that I was turning of the fridge before I leave days (DAYS!!!) in advance, and she already seemed annoyed and asked why and I explained to her. come to the day of, I find out from one of our mutual friends that after I turned the fridge off, she came to put some of her stuff in said friends fridge, and seemed bitter/sour about it. My thing is: I already told her days in advance, I explained why, and it's also my fucking fridge??? I don't get why she's being so bitter about it with other people but not saying anything to me. Its just really really annoying. How do I stop being angry about this or deal with it, we have not had any drama before this.

I can't eat:
- Avocados: i can no longer eat those as its high in fat.
- Squid: for some odd reason... if i eat it, It triggers heartburn. (Which happened today) years ago i'd eat it, no problem.
- Bananas: a small bite of banana and I'm in pain for 6 hours. 
- no mints and or citrus fruits. 

I do consume:
- chocolates here and there.
- avid Starbucks holiday coffee person. After the holidays, no more coffee.
- deep fried food

1hdu455,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1hdu455/i_work_inside_the_processing_plant_for_cartoon/,I work inside the processing plant for cartoon mascots. I've never seen the process. Until now.,"The factory I worked in was huge, with thousands of cylindrical machines. 

I pressed buttons.

White meant ready.

Red: Finished.

Yellow: Eject.

When the machine was ready, I pressed:

Forward.

Forward.

Left.

Forward.

I waited three minutes, then hit eject.

It paid well for what I did, which was sit and press buttons. I had a screen showing me a bird's-eye view of the machines, but I didn't see the process. 

The screen displaying it was locked. 

Unless there was an emergency, I didn't see anything. 

The music drove me mad.

It was *loud*, especially during processing.

It was always that same tune, *When you wish upon a star*, on repeat. 

Two weeks ago, I had a headache, so after pressing the usual buttons (forward, forward, forward, left, forward), I reached for my coffee, taking a scorching sip‚Äî

Spilling it all over myself, and the control panel.

‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù

I grabbed a napkin; my gaze glued to the panel which was toast. Right in the middle of processing product#127890. 

I was about to stab the emergency button under my desk when the music‚Ä¶ stopped. That constant tune bleeding into my brain came to an abrupt halt, and something else cut through the uneasy silence. Initially, I thought it was a machine acting up‚Äîbut no. 

Something ice-cold wriggled down my spine. 

*Screams.* 

I could hear agonizing screams. When the locked screen flashed up, I found myself staring inside Unit 56. 

All I could see was red dripping from the walls, the ceiling, spinning blades slowly descending from every angle, needles and saws inches from a guy. 

Early twenties. I could see where the work had begun on his face, peeling a chunk of flesh from his cheekbones. He stood with his arms by his sides, swaying, and after I stabbed a button with an eye symbol, he jerked suddenly, blinking rapidly, waking up. He was awake and aware, *inches* from a frozen saw. 

The boy's lips parted, a guttural cry rattling my skull. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶‚Äù  He broke into a sob. ‚ÄúWhat's going on? Help me,‚Äù he whispered, straining against metal arms restraining him. His cries fell into incomprehensible screams. I was aware I was covering my ears, trying to block them out.

‚ÄúI'm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm going to,‚Äù I choked out. ‚ÄúCalm down, okay?‚Äù I crawled over to the panel, stabbing at buttons. ‚ÄúWhat's your name?‚Äù

The boy broke down, and I noticed, my gut twisting, I could see his skull. 

‚ÄúSam.‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúI want to go‚Ä¶ home.‚Äù

I couldn't respond. 

‚ÄúWhy can't I feel anything?‚Äù Sam sobbed. 

I tried every button, but the panel was locked. 

I couldn't lift the metal bars restraining his torso. 

I couldn't save him. 

I was ready to go down there, and free him manually, when my talkie came to life. ‚ÄúEleanor?‚Äù My manager's voice crackled through my talkie. ‚ÄúIf there's a problem, press the overload button.‚Äù

I couldn't move.

Couldn't breathe.

‚ÄúGet him out of there.‚Äù I managed to whisper. 

It's like she was completely ignoring me. Like she was used to people disobeying her. ‚ÄúEleanor?‚Äù My manager repeated. ‚ÄúAll right, I'll continue processing from my end.‚Äù

No.

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù

I dived forward, and a guard entered, immediately restraining me, forcing me arms behind my back. I don't remember shrieking or moving. The control panel lot up bright red, and Sam started screaming again. But his screams didn't last long. 

I just stood there, FORCED to stand there, watching the machine continue, mercilessly slicing through Sam, splitting his bones apart, and stuffing his remnants, including his brain, into a shiny new Flynn Ryder costume. The flaps of skin resembling lips spread into a joyful grin. 

‚ÄúJ-just can't-get my n-n-nose right!‚Äù

‚ÄúEject the product, Eleanor.‚Äù

I managed to shake my head, paralyzed to the spot. 

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Her sigh crackled through the speaker. ‚ÄúEject the product, or you are *fired*.‚Äù

When I refused, again, she did it herself, and then fired me on the spot. 

The brand new Flynn Ryder mascot walked out.

And a girl walked in.

The screen flashed white, and I had no fucking control over it. 

*Ready*. 

Forward.

Forward.

Left.

Face the spinning blades.

*Forward.*

Before I could stop myself, I lunged forward and stabbed STOP. 

But I couldn't do anything past that. I was dragged out of there. 

Look, I've spoken to my therapist and she thinks I'm insane. 

But I'm BEGGING you. When you get the chance, please just take a second look at the Disney mascots. 

There's a human inside. 

And I'm sure, somewhere deep down, they're screaming to be let out.

Just don't ask it's real name. Walk away and don't look back.

Or, like me, you will go insane.",4,1734147459.0,Odd_directions,1,0.83,False

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have big ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC üòÖ I'm a achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everthing, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pok√©mon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play an TTRPG, but would love to. I suffer from a bit of learning curve.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf üôÉ

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office. I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube few years ago. My favorite horror movie is probably The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I watched all the SAW movies last month to kick off spooky season, and right now I'm making my way through the Friday the 13th movies.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills üòÖ But I'm trying new recipes all the time. I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats ü§§

I used to love writing‚Ä¶poems, short stories, lyrics. This is the first time I have felt like writing in quite some time. She is a muse in that way, but she would not need me for that. She is already so incredibly talented as is. She is an artist with unrivaled range across many disciplines. A bit pop a bit punk, this girl has guts, that is for sure. She is exactly my type in every way. She is stunning, gorgeous, delicate, intelligent, and caring. Her personality seems electric and so positive. She has a smile that I think could stop traffic. Part the clouds on a rainy day and bring out the sun. One that wars would have been fought over just for her to look in your direction one brief time. Her eyes are alluring like the sky just before a thunderstorm. She may be the only person in this world that can pull off red lipstick, in my eyes. There is not much I wouldn‚Äôt do to wear its imprint on my face, happily, for the rest of my days. She is like the smell of fresh wet concrete after a long summer, unique and unforgettable.

Filthy toilets,"I want to start with the positives here. Like many cafes in the Inner West, Matinee has great coffee (which I do get from time to time). Took the family there for breakfast this morning and the breakfast burrito that I got was also delicious (although for $24 it would want to be).

However $20 for a single waffle (which was overcooked and brittle) with a stingy amount of cream and small tub of maple syrup is a joke ($40 for two kids..). For an American style diner I would expect much better for a staple like waffles - especially for a cafe that‚Äôs often touted as one of Sydney‚Äôs best (at least in the Inner West). I also can‚Äôt believe they don‚Äôt have pancakes on the menu but I‚Äôm not complaining about that (less options is often better imo, particularly when done well). I‚Äôm more than happy to pay above average prices for above average food, or affordable prices for average food, but pick one or the other‚Ä¶ maybe I'm out of touch but I feel that the standards of many pubs and cafes in Sydney have dropped significantly since COVID, while prices/cost of living continues to get out of hand..

But my biggest gripe was the state that the toilets were in! All the toilets (M ,F, disabled) we tried to take our son to was completely trashed and filthy (toilet paper strewn everywhere, urine on the floor, bins filled to the brim - it was grim). I work in high schools and even in the student toilets I don‚Äôt see trashed bathrooms like these. I want to add that we were there at about 8:30am - plenty of time for the toilets to have been checked and certainly nowhere near long enough for them to have been trashed if they were cleaned overnight. The eating area (particularly down towards the toilets) also felt pretty grimy (for some reason there were styrofoam balls all over the place). As a local who‚Äôs usually pretty proud of our local food scene I was pretty embarrassed about the waffle and the state that the toilets were in first thing on a Saturday morning - presumably the busiest day of the week for a cafe that gets a lot of hype.

Matinee used to be run so well - it was a genuinely impressive cafe with great food, coffee, service and atmosphere. What happened? Did the owners change hands? Was this just a one off? Or is this another case of enshittification?",4,1734147168.0,foodies_sydney,1,1.0,False

1hdtyto,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs_Archives/comments/1hdtyto/a_storemans_thoughts/,A storeman‚Äôs thoughts‚Ä¶,"I am new to Reddit and just an uneducated middle aged Storeman so take everything here as fun thoughts to share. Below are a few thoughts I‚Äôve had over the years that I‚Äôve recently added to with the drone incidents that are being covered in the media.

What could the UFO/UAP phenomena be:

- man made, has a group broken off from mainstream connected society and continued to advance beyond our current connected countries 

- man made, did 1 branch of our ancestors not die off but their tech greatly leapt forward and they took to space or deep water exploration/civilisation

- Extra terrestrial aliens
- Demons & Angels | Souls
- Terrestrial aliens
- Earth defence system (past civilisation)
- Earth defence system (current)
- Underwater civilisation
- Deep underground civilisation
- Time travellers 
- Inter dimensional visitors
- Our creators / handlers

- Are part of the phenomena scientists, academics, tourists, mining operations‚Ä¶ what if part of what‚Äôs here isn‚Äôt the military faction 

Fun thoughts, JUST thoughts:

- Is it possible to cross over dimensions? 

- mushrooms come from cows and cows keep getting abducted/mutilations

- are black holes just solar system marble bags 

- Why hasn‚Äôt anyone gone and completely investigated cow mutilations, they were/are reported in the US and there were reports along the east coast of Australia according to Ross Coultart

- Pine gap have 3 fixed satellites that have continuous coverage over 1/3 of the earth‚Ä¶ basically they will know where things are going

- Classic UFO‚Äôs exhibited behaviour similar to that of Squid/Cuttlefish (rapid change of direction/colour change

- Do we actually live in a simulation? 

- Bob Lazar claimed to have worked at Area 51(s4 or something) back in the late 80‚Äôs, I remember his story as a kid in the 90s‚Ä¶ Area 51 was only confirmed to exist during Obama‚Äôs presidency in 2013. Governments can keep secrets, or at least try to.

- Accessible Australian National archives records have accounts of UFOs

- our ancestors of different cultures all describe similar beings and some had descriptions of angels, demons & orbs

- IF there is an earth defence system that‚Äôs not ours, what or who is/was it defending us from, and who created it

- MK Ultra, this is both interesting and terrifying

- Remote viewing and Astral travelling, the fact that this was actually pursued by the US military arm is mind blowing

- education and military used to appear to be closely linked, private contractors seems to have replaced education. There seems to be a large disconnect now where on the surface between education and military (as an uneducated Storeman) it appears that the military is open to throwing money at unconventional science 

- as a kid before mobile phones I never saw satellites, shooting stars yes, but never satellites. Now with apps and by just looking up I see them often. 

- Hundreds of thousands of planes fly every week. I live next to an airport, literally next to it. I see maybe 10 or 20 a day as I go about my life. Large planes really high up are visible but can be hard to spot. Any UAP/UFO are going to be hard to spot during the day. Anything without a light source/reflection will not be visible.

There‚Äôs so many more thoughts I want to add but I‚Äôm already distracted and writing this whilst I‚Äôm meant to be organising my car being towed..

Drones being ‚Äúreported‚Äù
- Adversaries 
- Local civilian group/individuals
- US military tech 
- US private contractor tech
- UAP/UFO
- PsyOp
- A great marketing campaign for a new Drone

Points to consider

- drones initially appeared over 3 US occupied RAF UK bases after Biden‚Äôs administration approved Ukraine the use of long range missiles, the 3 sites I think were going to potentially house nuclear weapons

- Publicly stating the objects as enemies will further heighten tensions and run the risk of escalating the potential for conflict 

- When some strange green lights coming down from space was first observed in Hawaii 2023 it was thought to be China‚Ä¶ later confirmed to be NASA‚Ä¶ the media in the West has a tendency to jump to conclusions that it always our enemies or competition 

- There is the chance that witnesses reports/pix/vids are a mix of UAP/UFO, commercial & private owned drones, black projects, military/commercial/private choppers, planes and satellites

- China moved A LOT of container ships around the world during 2020, what happened to all of them and are there still hordes of Chinese vessels just chilling off of countries coastlines?

I‚Äôm in my 30s and looking to meet single men in the same age range, but I struggle with dating apps‚Äîthey don‚Äôt feel natural to me. My best relationships have happened organically, so I‚Äôd prefer to meet someone in real life.

That said, I‚Äôm not sure where to go or what to do to find the right environment for meeting men. I‚Äôm outgoing and very extroverted but not a fan of bars, parties, or chaotic social settings. My interests lean toward ‚Äúnerdier‚Äù hobbies: video games, board games, anime, reading, hiking, tea, coffee, art, museums, and more structured or low-key social activities.

My therapist has suggested joining clubs or trying group activities, but I‚Äôm a bit stumped about what might work for me. I‚Äôd love ideas for places or events where I can meet men who share my interests, especially those who are passionate about health, personal growth, and (hopefully!) video games.

I realize this might be a tricky balance‚ÄîI sometimes meet people who share my gaming and nerdy interests but might not prioritize health or getting out of the house. I‚Äôm looking for someone who checks both boxes.

Where should I start? What clubs, groups, or activities would you suggest?

Edit: lots of replies already! I‚Äôm realizing that the reality is there‚Äôs not actually one club or place for me. Prince Charming doesn‚Äôt have a castle to go to, after all. I already go everywhere, join many things, and chat up everyone. I dated the grocery store manager recently because we chatted every time I shopped. Obviously that didn‚Äôt work out. 

It‚Äôs frustrating because I make so many local ‚Äúfriends‚Äù to all the places I regularly visit, but nothing worth pursuing. 

Where are the charming, handsome, mature, independent, successful, nerdy gaming men hiding? ",6,1734146731.0,AskMenOver30,24,0.71,False

1hdturd,https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/1hdturd/a_storemans_thoughts/,A storeman‚Äôs thoughts‚Ä¶ ,"I am new to Reddit and just an uneducated middle aged Storeman so take everything here as fun thoughts to share. Below are a few thoughts I‚Äôve had over the years that I‚Äôve recently added to with the drone incidents that are being covered in the media.

What could the UFO/UAP phenomena be:

- man made, has a group broken off from mainstream connected society and continued to advance beyond our current connected countries 

- man made, did 1 branch of our ancestors not die off but their tech greatly leapt forward and they took to space or deep water exploration/civilisation

- Extra terrestrial aliens
- Demons & Angels | Souls
- Terrestrial aliens
- Earth defence system (past civilisation)
- Earth defence system (current)
- Underwater civilisation
- Deep underground civilisation
- Time travellers 
- Inter dimensional visitors
- Our creators / handlers

- Are part of the phenomena scientists, academics, tourists, mining operations‚Ä¶ what if part of what‚Äôs here isn‚Äôt the military faction 

Fun thoughts, JUST thoughts:

- Is it possible to cross over dimensions? 

- mushrooms come from cows and cows keep getting abducted/mutilations

- are black holes just solar system marble bags 

- Why hasn‚Äôt anyone gone and completely investigated cow mutilations, they were/are reported in the US and there were reports along the east coast of Australia according to Ross Coultart

- Pine gap have 3 fixed satellites that have continuous coverage over 1/3 of the earth‚Ä¶ basically they will know where things are going

- Classic UFO‚Äôs exhibited behaviour similar to that of Squid/Cuttlefish (rapid change of direction/colour change

- Do we actually live in a simulation? 

- Bob Lazar claimed to have worked at Area 51(s4 or something) back in the late 80‚Äôs, I remember his story as a kid in the 90s‚Ä¶ Area 51 was only confirmed to exist during Obama‚Äôs presidency in 2013. Governments can keep secrets, or at least try to.

- Accessible Australian National archives records have accounts of UFOs

- our ancestors of different cultures all describe similar beings and some had descriptions of angels, demons & orbs

- IF there is an earth defence system that‚Äôs not ours, what or who is/was it defending us from, and who created it

- MK Ultra, this is both interesting and terrifying

- Remote viewing and Astral travelling, the fact that this was actually pursued by the US military arm is mind blowing

- education and military used to appear to be closely linked, private contractors seems to have replaced education. There seems to be a large disconnect now where on the surface between education and military (as an uneducated Storeman) it appears that the military is open to throwing money at unconventional science 

- as a kid before mobile phones I never saw satellites, shooting stars yes, but never satellites. Now with apps and by just looking up I see them often. 

- Hundreds of thousands of planes fly every week. I live next to an airport, literally next to it. I see maybe 10 or 20 a day as I go about my life. Large planes really high up are visible but can be hard to spot. Any UAP/UFO are going to be hard to spot during the day. Anything without a light source/reflection will not be visible.

There‚Äôs so many more thoughts I want to add but I‚Äôm already distracted and writing this whilst I‚Äôm meant to be organising my car being towed..

Drones being ‚Äúreported‚Äù
- Adversaries 
- Local civilian group/individuals
- US military tech 
- US private contractor tech
- UAP/UFO
- PsyOp
- A great marketing campaign for a new Drone

Points to consider

- drones initially appeared over 3 US occupied RAF UK bases after Biden‚Äôs administration approved Ukraine the use of long range missiles, the 3 sites I think were going to potentially house nuclear weapons

- Publicly stating the objects as enemies will further heighten tensions and run the risk of escalating the potential for conflict 

- When some strange green lights coming down from space was first observed in Hawaii 2023 it was thought to be China‚Ä¶ later confirmed to be NASA‚Ä¶ the media in the West has a tendency to jump to conclusions that it always our enemies or competition 

- There is the chance that witnesses reports/pix/vids are a mix of UAP/UFO, commercial & private owned drones, black projects, military/commercial/private choppers, planes and satellites

- China moved A LOT of container ships around the world during 2020, what happened to all of them and are there still hordes of Chinese vessels just chilling off of countries coastlines?

- I think it was Ross Coulthart that mentioned that a Chinese vessel recently deliberately destroyed a main fibre line and I think I heard somewhere that 90 Chinese vessels had moved towards Taiwan. So‚Ä¶ is it China messing with us so we don‚Äôt intervene? Or is it the US military looking to exercise some new laws they‚Äôd like to bring in

Once I got home I told my mother and she tried to take my blood pressure at home, thinking the calm enviorment would help. I glanced at the machine and seen my heart rate at 140bpm. I freaked out and took it off, I didn't even want to know what the reading was. I don't know what to do. I find myself just pacing around my house sometimes for no reason.

I'm not interested in giving everyone cheep heavily roasted generic coffee, thats why I'm here on this subreddit. But I'm also not sure I have the space, time, or talent to begin roasting consistent coffee for a party's worth of people in just a year.

If I wanted to work with a local roaster for this project, what would it look like to develop a very small batch of custom roasted coffee? Is this something a local roaster would consider (I live in NYC)? How would I go about finding them? How much do you think something like this would costs (~60g/person * 250 person ‚âà 15 kilo of custom roasted coffee)?

This is not an official r/pourover post or event. 

This Saturday, December 14, 2024 around 2:30pm there will be a *free* coffee cupping of James Hoffmann's Decaf project.   We plan for 3 roasters (Coffee Anthology, Methodical, and S&W) to be on the table, so you should have the chance to try 12 versions (9 decaf, 3 caf) of the same La Virgen coffee that James selected for this project.  This is hosted at the FLOW Coffee ATL pourover pop-up which is in the Tiendita basement of El Ponce at 939 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Atlanta, GA 30306.  A few notes:

1. Please RSVP for numbers here: [https://forms.office.com/r/tVwgHQTTnr](https://forms.office.com/r/tVwgHQTTnr)
2. There's no charge for the cupping, but a business is kindly hosting the tasting.  Consider buying a deliciously dialed-in pourover (e.g. Letty Gesha by Diego Bermudez), latte, bag of coffee beans, food and/or a gift from the Mexican gift store.
3. If you have a Decaf project set from a different roaster you'd like to share with others on Saturday, say so in the comments below.
4. This is before the official YouTube stream on December 15.  The live event isn't as crucial as previous James Hoffmann events, so we think that's OK.  But if you want to save yourself for the Sunday, we understand!
5. If you don't know what a cupping is, James Hoffmann Guest Creator Aramse has a nice 1 minute guide here: [https://youtube.com/shorts/yzdUhvBk0Ys](https://youtube.com/shorts/yzdUhvBk0Ys) James himself has a more in-depth 15 minute guide here: [https://youtu.be/cSEgP4VNynQ](https://youtu.be/cSEgP4VNynQ)
6. If you know what a cupping is and have your own favorite spoon, bring it along!
7. If you'd like to share/trade a small \~15g bag of an interesting specialty coffee you have, bring it along!
8. There is free parking at the venue. Route 2 of the MARTA bus also goes past the venue.

FINALLY - Many thanks to James Hoffmann, his team, and the roasters worldwide for making this massive decaf coffee tasting possible. This free event is designed to enable more people to take part in it!

How bad is it that I (31F) caught up with an old friend (28 M)  I hooked up with 7 years ago while starting to date someone new (40M)?,"Seeking input and opinions on how awful this may or may not have been. I had a friend well call Mike 7 years ago, we met at work and hung out a few times, and we then hooked up (had sex) once. He ghosted which was really crappy but I got over it. He then reached out to me in 2020 being super apologetic and holding himself accountable, he missed being friends. I decided to let him be on my socials and accepted the apology, I truly did value the friendship we had.  We were just friends on fb and ig. Since then we've been in our own separate relationships and didn't hang out but just commented on each other's posts.

I recently became single two months ago and I guess he did as well. I have zero sexual desire for him and it's strictly a platonic feeling from my end but I never hung out with him or talked a whole lot because we each had our own separate relationships and didn't want to upset our partners or make things weird even if it was just a friendly coffee. 

Anyway fast forward to now, I just started seeing someone new (40M) we'll call Josh, it's moving fast but I'm super happy, we went out on a first date about 3 weeks ago and haven't made things official but I care so much and am falling so hard, he feels the same and even said we love each other. We had sex, but then I felt like he was distancing himself and I got really freaked out and depressed. Mike had messaged me last week if I wanted to grab coffee and catch up and I left him on read, (were both bad texters). I've been worried about this new relationship with Josh (turns out I was catastrophizing and he wasn't trying to pump and dump me) but I really did need a friend to talk with, so I reached out and made plans for today. 

Boy do I fucking regret it, Mike and I caught up over coffee and things were fine, i talked about Josh a lot of the time and my worries and excitement. The cafe was closing since it was 6pm so we decided to grab a drink. Well Mike proceeds to get drunk, 3 drinks in 40 mins, tells me hes still attracted to me and makes me super uncomfortable so I tell him so, he def seems off the rails, kind of worried he'll show up at my job and be a lunatic (I work with Josh). 

I didn't DO anything, or have any intention of doing anything with himbut I still feel so guilty like I cheated. Am I over reacting? 

  
TLDR: Dating someone new who I'm seriously in love with, it's only been 3 weeks, and were not technically official. However, I'm self sabotaging and having a lot of feelings and fears of this person leaving on top of other life problems. Needed a friend, hung out with a friend I hooked up with 7 years ago who I see in a strictly platonic way in a spur of the moment -you're free I'm free lets catch up with some coffee- way, it went great but the cafe closed, he asked to grab a drink and  I said I could grab a quick drink with him,  but dude is unstable, gets drunk and says he has feelings for me. How awful am I as a person to have hung out with him period? Is this even worth mentioning to the guy I'm seeing? ",0,1734145748.0,relationship_advice,3,0.5,False

This indirectly led to my uncomfortable day. ","I figured out what happened with driver from the other day. I wanted to clarify. UPS could do some grief counseling or something. I just need another opinion on this.

His friend, another driver, had a heart attack while driving, which caused an accident. Immediately, the next day, he was given a lot of his friend's route. (That's not great.)

<Understanding the day I had>


He's a stoic (sort of toxic) masculine type of guy. It didn't make any sense to me because I was there for no reason. He didn't need a helper and he wouldn't let me do any work. He actually snapped at me when I tried. He just wanted someone to talk to. He called me 'baby' and 'sweetie'; told me I was pretty; kept asking if I was married; he hit on me;  then seemed upset when I didn't flirt back; kept saying, ""just let me get to know you"" then started offering me a quid pro quo type of situation just to entertain him.  (That's not what I'm there for.) Else: he literally started trying to get jobs at the different businesses we were delivering to. Like, on the clock, mid delivery, ""Are y'all hiring. I've got my CDL..."". He left incorrectly assigned packages in a random yard that we then had to come back to. At the end he said, ""I gave you an easy day right? Do you want to work with me tomorrow too?"" I didn't report him because he didn't attack me or anything like that but I do regret being rude to him. kinda

<Understanding why he requested me specifically.>


He actually wasn't a total creep. He asked for me, by name, because someone else I worked with liked me. I tend to have a cheerful work attitude and I bring a coffee or something for the person doing my training, i.e. a driver I'm working with for the first time. My alma mater taught that.

1hdt7yt,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1hdt7yt/my_gf_f20_and_me_f21_had_a_pretty_big_fight/,My gf (F20) and me (F21) had a pretty big fight recently due to my pride,"TL;DR: My girlfriend cancelled on our plans last moment due to the fact that her friends called her selfish for not joining her for their impromptu dinner plans. Days prior, the reason why our plan was made in the first place was because her friends cancelled on their plans to eat at a local coffee shop and instead switched it with a plan for a drinking session, my girlfriend disliked drinking and I guess to fill in with their switched up plan I parred it up with our formerly cancelled plans to go out with her.

Fast forward to the day of the plan, I brought her flowers and was so excited I came early at our meet up place, she had a class prior so I made it a mission to, for once, be so early for her I came an hour before our meeting time additionally, I did not eat for the entire day so that I could par up with her appetite, see, she hates it when someone finishes their meal before her and I get full very quick so I have to have an appetite for heavy meals when I am with her. 30 minutes in, she chatted me that her friends changed their plans once again from a drinking session to a dinner to cater to my girlfriend's request.

Now I have no problems with her meeting up with her friends, in fact, I have been pushing her to bond more with her friends since her time is spent mostly on me, it was just that day was planned, and I was waiting for her. For the past 2 days I have also been pestering her about making sure that she really had nothing going on for that day since that plan that I proposed to her has also been replanned for three times already, it involved walking to a park where the christmas season is being celebrated in and I was not able to walk through it last year so I was looking forward to it today.

Fast forward to the day of the ""plan,"" since I was already in the place of meet-up, she insisted on meeting me before going to her friends, I agreed because I thought we will be, at the very least, eating at a coffee shop nearby to make up for cancelling our plans but then she texted me again if it will be okay for me to accompany her to walk to their dinner destination, agreed. But then 10 minutes came, my order came and she was not even there. This disappointed me so much I threw away the bouquet I brought for her and pretended my order did not arrive yet so that I have an excuse to stay at our meetup place.

She arrived, saying that her friends were already there so I told her to go without me since ""my order was not there yet"" she reluctantly walked away and when I saw that it did not even take her a single look back to check up on me, I proceeded to just go home. I know I am so petty for being mad, I even told her that I don't like her male friend and that she should cut him off because him constantly getting his face close to her did not bode me well.

Now, I can count reddit to humble me down, can anyone please give me advice on how I could bring down my pride and make it up to her for. I was being mean and it's true, it's only rare for her friends to include her in their plans and omit drinking from their plans. Please anyone tell me what I should do to make it up to her for being so mean",1,1734144452.0,relationships,0,1.0,False
1hdt7xj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeachersInTransition/comments/1hdt7xj/leaving_changes_the_little_things/,Leaving Changes the Little Things,"I have been in a good fit outside of teaching - working nonprofit from home - full time for a week now. 

For context, I taught for over a decade in mostly public high school English. I resigned this fall when I realized my life was not one worth living. 

Here are just some things I've noticed: 

- I'm not as concerned about finances as I thought I would be. I think I underestimated how much of my own money I was draining into my role as a teacher. I also mistakenly believed that it would be difficult to find a starting salary near that of a certified teacher over a decade in. 

- It's easier to be patient - on the inside - with strangers. I've always been outwardly friendly and deferential to others, but now I really feel internally unbothered by inappropriate social choices in public places. I'm realizing that the examples parents set for their kids are not my immediate problem, and I am now not able NOR expected to remedy that in my professional life. 

- Food tastes better. The coffee. The tea. Celery. All of it. Sunlight, when I have an hour off for lunch and can take a walk outside, feels like a chemical high. 

- I daydream about good things - I daydream about the future. And my dreams at night are silly and vivid - not the constant nightmares with school spaces as the recurring setting. I thought nightmares were so much more normal than they are. 

- Being out - fully out and in another job - is absolutely nothing like summer break. This might be a personal thing, but I'm realizing now that I must have been absolutely bound by the knowledge that another school season was just a few days away. I enjoyed my summer jobs, but never stopped belonging mentally to the one that made me feel that dying in August would be the best possible thing to happen to me. 

- My former students are happy for me. I've run into a few (now graduated) since resigning, and they've expressed relief and kindness before wishing me luck. Their goodness has washed away the guilt I felt for leaving. 

- I - and you - CAN be good at other, new things. I felt immense regret for how I spent my skill-building years as an excellent student in what happened to be an awful choice of study. Now, I have team members asking me to teach them anything they don't understand - because even coworkers who don't know my background can detect that I'm an experienced and skillful teacher. That doesn't go away, even as I learn how to add new abilities to my arsenol. 

Just some last encouragement to anyone looking for the door: I feel like my new job placement came from pure dumb luck. Please remember that the dice will roll in your favor eventually. Do anything to cut and run, because now I feel a little silly for being so terrified to resign. I shudder to think what would have happened if I let my fears deny me another chance at life.

1hdt7sw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/1hdt7sw/relationship_rant/,relationship rant.,"Hey guys,

I‚Äôm a freshman and I met this chill girl during move in week. She helped me get acquainted with the campus and was good company. I asked her out, she agreed, and we have been vibing. But recently I‚Äôve been concerned for her health. She‚Äôs neglecting her sleep, eating little, and letting her grades slip. This finals season she absolutely lost her shit and flipped out at me because I refused to write her paper for her. I don‚Äôt know why she is acting so PETTY and entitled all of a sudden. I haven‚Äôt been the best boyfriend and probably spend too much time with my nose in a book but it just feels like she‚Äôs using my inadequacies to unjustly justify her bout of high-strung behavior. She was never like this before and she just snapped at me this December. On top of that I‚Äôve heard she‚Äôs been slandering my name and talking shit about me to her church friends ‚Äî that could just be a rumor tho. She‚Äôs calmed down since but it‚Äôs kind of awkward talking to her. I have faith that she‚Äôs a good person but after that experience I‚Äôve come to also learn that she is unhinged and unpredictable. Thank God I didn‚Äôt spend more time with her ‚Äî I would‚Äôve been slobbering over the idea of her like a puppy.   
  
However I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm a patient person and I like to keep an open mind. If someone crosses my lines, I will call them out for it and expose their red hand, however blunt I have to be. She nearly triggered me with her ranting and rambling which in turn nearly made me snap. I had to block her and then unblocked her a day later, when I told her off and to quit playing mind games. But she was still delirious and kept texting me a bunch of weird crap. A few days later she chilled out but at the same time she hasn‚Äôt even apologized or shown any action that indicates an apology. I can‚Äôt assume, but my senses tell me she is now just wandering by with our relationship, all dilly-dally, which is ironically what I find to be one of her most attractive features. She doesn‚Äôt live a life giving fucks, both before and after this strange occurance lol. However because of that she is probably scared to commit to something more serious and I‚Äôm kind of getting turned off by what I assume to be her internal illusion of blissful ignorance. I‚Äôve tried talking to her about her freakshow incident but she just deflects the conversation and says it‚Äôs no big deal and that she was just trying to be funny (it was not funny). Now, I feel like she feigns naivety when deep down I know she is mature. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll have to break up with her if she isn‚Äôt willing to place at least some trust in my hands. My affection for her is like coffee and honestly it can go one of two ways at this point ‚Äî repulsively bitter and impossible to swallow or sweet and analgesic. It‚Äôs not bad to have a sweet relationship but it can be kinda boring imo. My friends are all telling me she‚Äôs toxic as fuck and that I need to veer away but unfortunately I‚Äôm a very loyal person, so I think that may be the reason why I haven‚Äôt called it quits yet. In a perfect world I‚Äôd love a bittersweet relationship like something you see in the movies. I do think we have that potential to achieve that ‚Äî¬† but she would have to somehow repair the havoc caused by her end, which honestly I don‚Äôt even understand where she would even begin because it may bleed deeper than I‚Äôm aware of. I‚Äôve also suggested for her to seek mental help as it‚Äôs greatly helped me with my own shit but she told me she doesn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúreliant.‚Äù Love is quite confusing, alas ü•≤ü§°üò≠.   
  
PS. Make sure to get good grades and build your resume before participating in relationships. NGL, I feel like I‚Äôve somehow become more stupid once I dated her lmao",0,1734144436.0,ucla,3,0.25,False

2) All it has is a defrosting machine to defrost your food and heat it up

3) Most of the recipes are saved cold for days and delivered by heating in a microwave or a merry chef. The magic to make it look fresh are the chopped corianders and onions sprinkled on top

4) The masala Chas you drink is just two pack of Amul chaas poured into a glass with some chaat masala and coriander 

5) Have you ever noticed the food would go stale if you don‚Äôt consume it immediately? 

6) Agreed coffee is coming fresh from a coffee machine

7) May be time to rethink the way India consumes food. This is worse than what I used to eat when I was living outside India

1hdt4vr,https://i.redd.it/9kimfpkw8q6e1.png,Gravity Falls: Fright Night‚ÄîChapter 1: Returned to Gravity Falls 2/2,"The next day, Wendy was sitting at the Cashier, flipping through a magazine, her feet propped up on the counter. She barely noticed Dipper standing in the doorway until he cleared his throat.

Dipper stood there, looking at her, his thoughts racing. He hadn't planned on this moment, but the strange feeling had been gnawing at him all morning. His heart beat a little faster as he stared at Wendy, wondering if he was finally ready to do it.

Mabel, who was passing by with a basket of supplies, noticed her brother's expression. She raised an eyebrow and crossed her arms. ""You okay, Dipper?"" she asked, a teasing glint in her eye.

Dipper snapped out of his trance and looked at her, quickly lowering his gaze. ""Uh, yeah. I just... I was thinking, you know, since we're 22 now, it might be time to finally tell Wendy...""

Mabel raised an eyebrow, leaning in. ""Tell her what?""

Dipper shifted uncomfortably. ""That I like her. I've always liked her. I just... never said anything."" He looked down at his shoes. ""I thought it might be time to confess.""

Mabel's eyes widened in mock horror. ""Dipper, no! Don't do it like that! You can't just spring it on her like that. You need to make it special. You need to-"" she paused, thinking of a better plan. ""I got it! Go on a date with her.""

Dipper's eyes went wide. ""A date? How do I even do that?""

Mabel rolled her eyes and grabbed his shoulders, pushing him toward Wendy. ""It's simple, Dipper. Just ask her out! You've got this.""

Dipper took a deep breath, his heart pounding in his chest. With a nervous glance at Mabel, he slowly walked up to Wendy.

""Uh, hey, Wendy,"" he greeted, his voice cracking slightly. Wendy looked up from her magazine and smiled.

""Hey, Dipper. What's up?""

Dipper shifted nervously, scratching the back of his neck. ""So, uh, we've, you know, known each other for a really long time now, right?""

Wendy tilted her head, intrigued. ""Yeah, dude, like, forever. What's up with you? You look like you're about to explode.""

He let out a nervous laugh. ""Yeah, it's just, um... I've been thinking a lot about how, you know, we've been through a ton of stuff together. Like the whole summer of weirdness back when we were kids, and even after that, staying in touch over the years.""

Wendy nodded, setting the magazine aside and giving him her full attention. ""Totally, dude. Those were some wild times. I mean, how many people can say they fought gnomes and lived to tell the tale?"" She grinned, leaning on the counter.

""Right, exactly!"" Dipper said, his voice rising slightly. ""And, well, I guess what I'm trying to say is... you've always been there for me. Like, more than just a friend. You're... you're amazing, Wendy. You're brave, funny, and just... awesome.""

Wendy blinked, caught off guard by his sudden seriousness. ""Whoa, dude. That's... really nice of you to say. Thanks.""

Dipper swallowed hard, his palms sweaty. ""And I've always kind of felt... I mean, I do feel... more than just friendship with you. Like, I like you, Wendy. I've liked you for a long time.""

Wendy's expression softened, but there was a flicker of surprise in her eyes. ""Dude, I had no idea you felt like that. I mean, we've always been chill, and you're honestly one of the coolest guys I know.""

Encouraged but still nervous, Dipper continued. ""I just thought... maybe... we could, you know, hang out sometime? Like, go out. On a date, I mean. Nothing crazy, just... see how it goes?""

Wendy leaned back slightly, her lips curving into a thoughtful smile. ""A date, huh? You're full of surprises today, dude.""

Dipper felt his heart hammering in his chest. ""Is that... a good surprise or a bad surprise?""

She laughed, a light and easy sound that made him feel a little less tense. ""Good, dude. Definitely good. You're sweet, and honestly, I've always had a soft spot for you.""

His face lit up. ""Really? So, does that mean-?""

Wendy held up a hand, cutting him off playfully. ""Hold your horses, dude. I'll go out with you, sure. But you better bring your A-game, Pines. You know I don't settle for boring.""

Dipper grinned, feeling a wave of relief and excitement wash over him. ""Don't worry. I'll make it awesome, I promise.""

""Good,"" Wendy said, smirking. ""And, dude, no pressure or anything, but if you mess it up, I'm totally gonna make fun of you for the rest of your life.""

Dipper laughed nervously. ""Noted.""

Dipper's heart skipped a beat as he nodded enthusiastically. ""Alright, it's a date then."" He turned back to Mabel, his nerves still on edge, but now with excitement too.

Mabel, who had been listening from the doorway, couldn't resist stepping in with a mischievous grin. ""Ooh, Dipper's got himself a date!"" she teased, waggling her eyebrows. ""What's the plan? Fancy dinner? A moonlit walk? Or are you gonna make her fight zombies for a cute stuffed animal at the arcade?""

Dipper groaned, covering his face with his hands. ""Mabel, don't start.""

""Oh, come on! It's your first date! I have to make sure you're doing it right!"" Mabel winked, playfully hopping over to him. ""So, where are we going? Can I come? I promise I won't interrupt. I'll be super, super quiet. Like a ninja.""

Dipper immediately shook his head, his face turning slightly red. ""No, Mabel. I want to go alone with Wendy. You know, so we can... actually, you know... have a normal time?""

Mabel raised an eyebrow, genuinely confused. ""Wait, but why can't I come? I'm fun, right?""

Dipper sighed, trying to stay calm. ""I love your silliness, Mabel, I really do. But not... not when I'm on a date with Wendy, okay? I just want to spend some time with her without, you know, being interrupted by your... well, your Mabel-ness.""

Mabel blinked, her smile faltering for just a second before she shrugged it off. ""Alright, alright, I get it. You want some alone time with Wendy. I'll try to behave. I mean, it's not like I can't go spy on you later anyway."" She gave him a sly wink.

Dipper's eyes widened. ""Mabel!""

She giggled, tapping him on the arm. ""Relax, Dipper. You know I'll just keep my distance. But... if you need any tips or, you know, romantic advice... you know where to find me.""

Dipper rolled his eyes, feeling a little more at ease despite his embarrassment. ""Thanks, I think I'll be fine without the tips. But seriously, Mabel, thanks for understanding.""

Mabel grinned, her eyes sparkling with mischief. ""Of course, bro. I'll be waiting for all the juicy details later. You can count on me to make sure this is the most epic first date ever. Just... you know, without showing up in person.""

Dipper chuckled, shaking his head. ""I really appreciate that."" He turned toward the door, feeling a rush of excitement and nerves all over again. ""Alright, I'm off. Wish me luck!""

""Good luck, Dipper!"" Mabel called out with a wink. ""And remember, no kissing on the first date-unless it's totally epic and memorable, then go for it!""

Dipper could hear her laugh as he stepped out, his heart beating faster as he made his way toward Wendy. Mabel's teasing was always something to laugh about, but for once, Dipper was grateful that she'd agreed to leave him to his date... even if she was definitely going to be watching from the shadows.

Later that evening, Dipper and Wendy walked outside the Mystery Shack, heading toward a local restaurant. As they sat down at a table, Dipper couldn't help but feel both nervous and excited. He looked across the table at Wendy, who was casually scrolling through her phone.

Dipper glanced across the table at Wendy, nervously tapping his fingers against the edge of the menu. ""So, uh, Wendy... you're still working at the Shack, huh?""

Wendy looked up from her phone, smirking. ""Yeah, dude. Someone's gotta keep an eye on that place. Besides, it's not like Soos can do it all by himself, and Stan's still... well, Stan."" She chuckled, setting her phone down. ""Why? You think I should have moved on or something?""

Dipper shook his head quickly, feeling flustered. ""No, no! I didn't mean it like that. I just thought maybe you'd, I don't know, have your own... place or something by now.""

Wendy leaned back in her chair, crossing her arms thoughtfully. ""I mean, yeah, I thought about it. But, dude, the Shack's home, you know? It's where all the weird, crazy stuff happens. And honestly? I don't think I'd want to leave it behind. What about you and Mabel? You guys took off right after that summer. What's it been? Ten years now?""

Dipper nodded slowly, his expression turning a bit somber. ""Yeah... ten years. It feels like forever, but at the same time, it feels like no time has passed at all. It was weird leaving. Mabel and I, we were just kids back then, but we always knew we'd have to go home eventually.""

Wendy raised an eyebrow. ""And now you're back. What took you guys so long, dude? I figured you'd visit more often. I mean, Gravity Falls isn't exactly the easiest place to forget.""

Dipper sighed, his gaze dropping to the table. ""Life, I guess. School, college, trying to figure out what to do with our lives. Mabel went all in on her art and crafts business, and I got sucked into... well, let's just call it chasing mysteries in other places."" He gave her a small smile. ""But nothing ever felt quite like Gravity Falls.""

Wendy nodded, her expression softening. ""I get that, dude. Life's... complicated, right? But I gotta say, it's good to see you guys back here. It's been way too quiet without you two causing chaos everywhere.""

Dipper chuckled, his nerves easing a little. ""Yeah, Mabel and I do have a knack for that, don't we?"" He hesitated before adding, ""I missed this place. I missed you.""

Wendy smiled warmly, leaning forward slightly. ""Well, dude, it's good to have you back. Things just aren't the same without Team Mystery Twins running around town.""

Dipper's face lit up at the old nickname. ""You remembered that?""

""Of course I did,"" Wendy said, grinning. ""How could I forget? You and Mabel were like the ultimate tag team of weirdness. And now that you're back, I'm guessing it won't be long before Gravity Falls starts throwing more crazy stuff your way.""

Dipper laughed, shaking his head. ""Honestly? I wouldn't be surprised. This town has a way of pulling us into its weirdness whether we want it or not.""

Wendy smirked, raising an eyebrow. ""Well, you better not go disappearing again, dude. Gravity Falls doesn't need a ten-year gap between visits. Deal?""

Dipper nodded, his smile growing. ""Deal. No more disappearing.""

Mabel sat on the other side of the restaurant, casually sipping her soda, but her eyes never left Dipper and Wendy. She was sitting behind the cover of a menu, pretending to read, but it was clear she was spying on her brother. With a mischievous grin, she lowered the menu just enough to get a better look at Dipper, her eyes twinkling with curiosity.

""Well, well,"" she muttered to herself. ""What's this? Dipper, all alone with Wendy? Looks like someone's trying to rekindle the old Mystery Twins charm."" She took another sip of soda, her grin widening. ""Not that I mind-just making sure nothing too weird happens.""

As she continued her playful surveillance, something caught her eye. A figure in a long, leather coat walked past Wendy and Dipper, casting a shadow over the table. Mabel squinted, her curiosity piqued. The person's face was hidden.

She slowly raised the menu higher, hiding her face, and peeked over the top, trying to get a better look. The figure was moving fast, almost too fast.

Then, out of the corner of her eye, Mabel saw the figure glance toward her. The moment their eyes met, a chill ran down her spine. The stranger's eyes widened in recognition, and before Mabel could even react, he turned and broke into a sprint, disappearing into the crowded street.

""Hey!"" Mabel whispered under her breath, her heart racing. ""What the heck was that? Who was that guy?""

Without wasting another second, she jumped out of her seat, her soda forgotten on the table. She darted out the door after him, her footsteps echoing in the street as she tried to catch up. Her heart pounded in her chest as she weaved through the crowd, eyes locked on the retreating figure ahead.

Mabel chased the figure through the bustling streets of Gravity Falls, her sneakers slapping against the pavement as she darted around corners and weaved through clusters of people.

""Hey! Wait up!"" she called, her voice echoing. ""What's your deal, dude? Are you a spy or something?""

The figure didn't answer, only quickening their pace. Mabel groaned, determination blazing in her eyes.

As she ran, she encountered her first obstacle: a fruit cart blocking the sidewalk. The vendor looked up in surprise as Mabel launched herself over the cart, narrowly avoiding a stack of apples.

""Sorry! Mystery chase happening!"" she shouted back at the confused vendor.

The figure was gaining distance, slipping through the crowd like a shadow. Mabel pushed herself harder, dodging a man carrying a stack of books and almost knocking over a street performer's guitar case.

""Hey, watch it!"" the man snapped, but Mabel only waved apologetically as she powered forward.

She spotted the figure ahead making a sharp turn into an alley. ""Oh no you don't!"" she muttered, forcing her legs to move faster. She barreled through a group of teenagers, accidentally bumping into one.

""Hey, what the-?"" one of them yelled, but Mabel didn't stop.

As she reached the alley, she hesitated for a split second before plunging in. The dimly lit path smelled like damp concrete, and the air was cooler here. She scanned her surroundings, expecting to see the figure at the other end, but stopped dead in her tracks.

The alley was a dead end.

A tall brick wall loomed at the far end, and there was no sign of the mysterious figure. Mabel squinted, her breath coming in heavy gasps.

""What...?"" she muttered, stepping forward cautiously. ""He was just here! There's no way he could've climbed that wall that fast. Did he-did he vanish or something?""

She walked up to the brick wall, pressing her hand against it as if expecting it to ripple or give way. Solid.

Mabel stepped back, scratching her head. ""Okay, Mabel,"" she said to herself, ""let's think this through. Either you just chased a ninja, or... Or that was the weirdest game of hide-and-seek ever.""

She turned, looking back toward the mouth of the alley. It was eerily quiet, the chatter of the street outside seeming distant now.

""Where did you go?"" she whispered, her eyes darting around the walls for any clue. ""What are you hiding, leather-coat guy?""

Her curiosity wasn't just piqued now-it was on fire. ""This is so going in the journal,"" she muttered, taking one last look at the empty alley before heading back to the street. As she left, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was still being watched.

Later that night, back at the Mystery Shack, Dipper was already asleep in his room, unaware of his sister's wild pursuit. Mabel, however, was wide awake. She sat in front of her laptop, her eyes scanning the screen.

She stumbled upon a website called ""Serial Killer on the Loose."" The title caught her attention, and she clicked on it. The first image that loaded made her gasp-it was the same man she had chased earlier, his face obscured by a mask. The caption read: Wanted for Multiple Murders.

Mabel scrolled down, finding more photos and reports of the man in various places around the world, always with the same description-a man in a leather coat, masked, highly dangerous.

She found herself glued to the screen as a video began to play. The footage showed the man standing on top of a church, watching as a figure below struggled for their life. The image froze, and the news report continued. ""Authorities believe the suspect is responsible for multiple deaths globally. He is considered armed and extremely dangerous.""

Mabel stared in shock, her mind racing. ""A serial killer... in Gravity Falls?"" She whispered, her eyes wide with disbelief. It didn't seem real.

But then, as the adrenaline surged, she quickly shut her laptop. ""No, I can't let anyone know about this. Not yet. If the town finds out, there'll be a panic."" She glanced at the sleeping Dipper, who had no idea what was going on. ""It's just a serial killer. Nothing to worry about. I can handle this."" Mabel murmured to herself, trying to shake off the unease crawling under her skin.

Later, Mabel was sleeping, then suddenly, a loud knock echoed through the quiet house, jolting Mabel awake. Her heart raced as she sat up in bed, confused and disoriented. It was well past midnight, and everyone else was asleep.

She rubbed her eyes, her thoughts still racing from the chilling discovery on her laptop. ""Who could it be at this hour?"" she muttered, her voice barely above a whisper. Hesitating for only a moment, she grabbed her phone, checking it for any missed messages or calls, but saw nothing unusual.

A second knock came, more urgent this time.

""Alright, alright, I'm coming!"" Mabel said, trying to sound calm as she slipped out of bed. Her feet met the cold floor with a soft thud, as she walked out of her room. As she crept down the stairs, her mind raced back to the mysterious man she had seen earlier. She could still picture his masked face, his cold, calculating eyes.

When she reached the front door, she paused, her hand hovering over the doorknob. With a deep breath to steady her nerves, she turned the handle and swung the door open, expecting to find someone-or something-on the other side.

But there was nothing. The porch was empty, and the night air felt unnervingly still.

Just as she was about to shut the door, she spotted something on the ground-a folded letter, its edges slightly curled. She bent down to pick it up, her fingers trembling as she read the message scribbled on the paper:

""I'm not what you think.""

Mabel's heart skipped a beat. The words felt like a punch to her gut. Her mind screamed at her to close the door and lock it, but she couldn't pull her eyes away from the letter. Something was wrong. Something didn't feel right.

She glanced up, and in the dim light of the yard, she saw him. The man in the leather coat, his face still hidden behind the mask, standing in the shadows of the trees. His cold eyes seemed to pierce through the darkness, watching her. He didn't move-he just stood there, waiting.

Panic surged through Mabel's chest, and before she could even think, she slammed the door shut, her breath coming in short, panicked gasps. She backed away from the door, stumbling as she bolted up the stairs and ran straight to her room.

She threw herself onto her bed, burying her head in her pillow to muffle her frantic thoughts. Was it real? Was he really out there? She shook her head, trying to calm herself. It's just a nightmare. It has to be. Just a nightmare.

The silence in the house felt suffocating as she lay there, her heart still pounding in her chest.

The next morning, Mabel awoke to the sound of Dipper's voice calling up the stairs.

""Mabel! Breakfast is ready!"" Dipper's voice was groggy but cheerful, as if nothing unusual had happened.

Mabel blinked a few times, her mind slowly pulling her out of the fog of sleep. She rubbed her eyes, glancing around the room. Everything was the same as it had been the night before.

""Yeah, I'm up,"" she mumbled, wiping her face with the back of her hand.

As she got out of bed and stretched, she glanced at her window, half-expecting to see the man in the trees again. But the morning sunlight streamed in, bright and peaceful, casting a warm glow over the room.

Mabel breathed a sigh of relief. Maybe it had been a nightmare after all. She shook her head, chuckling at herself. ""No, I'm just being paranoid,"" she whispered to herself, though the uneasy feeling still lingered in her chest.

She quickly got dressed, trying to shake off the eerie feeling from the night before. As she made her way downstairs, Dipper greeted her with a smile as he poured himself a cup of coffee.

""Sleep well?"" he asked casually, looking over his shoulder at her.

Mabel hesitated, wondering if she should tell him about what had happened. But as she looked at her brother's innocent face, she couldn't bring herself to say anything. It would just sound too crazy.

""Yeah... I just had a weird dream,"" Mabel said, brushing it off with a forced smile.

Dipper nodded, sipping his coffee. ""Well, you're not the only one. I had this dream where everything at the Mystery Shack turned into a giant escape room, and I had to solve riddles to get out. Weird, huh?""

Mabel chuckled nervously, trying to focus on something else. ""That's... weird. But, you know, classic Dipper stuff. I guess it's time to eat, huh?""

""Yeah! Let's go, I'm starving,"" Dipper said with a grin, leading the way to the kitchen.

As Mabel followed, her mind kept drifting back to the man in the trees. It had to be a dream, she told herself. But if it wasn't...

She quickly pushed the thought aside as she joined Dipper at the table, hoping that whatever had happened the night before was just a figment of her imagination.

But deep down, she couldn't shake the nagging feeling that it wasn't over.

1hdsyg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1hdsyg0/i_hate_feeling_unwanted/,I Hate Feeling Unwanted,"(This got way longer than what I meant it to, but it just came pouring out, so... TL;DR: I want more than anything to find my special someone to love, but feel like no one wants to love me back.) 

I like girls. I like pretty girls. And I can tell when a girl IS pretty. Pretty, however, was never what drew me in.

The first girl I ever really felt anything special for, I was in middle school. Girl's name was Ashley. I just moved to the little Podunk town in middle America and the second I laid eyes on this girl, I knew there was something special about her. And when I say special, I don't mean the typical, ""Wow, that girl's gorgeous. I wanna see her naked,"" that the teenage boy in me had experienced before. It was... different. It wasn't just a want, but something closer-feeling to a need... like being underwater and not being able to take a breath. Yes, she was pretty, but something about her drew me to her like a moth to a flame. I was in *awe* of her. It almost felt like my life wouldn't be complete without her. There was a feeling of peace and magic that went with her whenever I saw her.

And so what did I do? 

Well, I did what any socially-awkward, Asperger's-diagnosed guy would do in my shoes: Admire her from a distance, and try for years to think of some way to broach my feelings. I fantasized about holding her in my arms and just admiring her while she napped, snuggling with her on cold winter mornings under the covers, and even just listening to her rant about the bad days she'd have, or just anything and anything she'd want to talk about. I just wanted so badly to be in her presence as much as I could be, and even a few seconds each day with or without a word between us was always the highlight of my school day.

In the end, of course, I managed to awkwardly eke out a desperate confession towards the last bit of high school (before we moved away for my senior year), and of course she declined me. Naturally I was devastated. It had been the only girl I ever felt such a way for, and it would be that way for decades after. 

The only other time I made a real attempt to ask another girl out was a girl in my senior year. I didn't have that ""special feeling"" that I'd felt for Ashley before, but everyone I ever knew always resorted to the old ""get back on that horse"" cliche. I'd never shared how deeply I had felt for Ashley before, but I knew that one rejection shouldn't have been any reason to despair. I'd just turned eighteen and we were approaching the end of high school, ready to head off into the open world beyond. I had held onto hope that in the wide world out there someone would find their way into my life and complete my existence.

And yes, I know, I'm an old, sappy romantic.

It was in the middle of spring my senior year when they had started selling carnations as a kind of spring pick-me-up at school. Kids the school over were buying them and decorating the school, book bags, sport fields, etc. with them. This girl I'd gotten to know a little (can't even remember her name now) was by no means special, but I liked spending time with her and wanted to try breaking out of my isolation again. I had bought her one of these carnations -- prettiest one I could find. That's when I approached her with it.

I didn't even get a word in when she saw me approaching with that flower in my hand before she burst out laughing and ran for the nearest exit -- in front of God, the world, and everyone else. Needless to say, the normally-rowdy halls got real quiet real quick, and all those eyes had only me to turn to.

I have never again experienced such humiliation or trauma.

Through my brief few years in college I never approached any girl ever again, what with that horrifying moment to haunt me for the rest of my days. I had put the thought of love and affection and ever having a partner that I could give my heart to entirely out of my mind. Or, I did until a particular class assignment in my Creative Writing course.

I don't have the piece I wrote anymore, but it had been a short story about whatever subject we wanted, so long as it was something we were passionate about. The goal was to stir the instructor's emotions with our craft, so I wrote about the only thing I really ever felt any passion about.

After that assignment, the instructor had taken me aside and asked if I had ever been hurt by my feelings for someone before. He had been able to tell from the piece I'd done that I'd not been particularly fortunate in that arena. He did tell me, though, that it was his opinion that if one could just pour the words onto paper of how they felt for someone, that one could tell if they were truly in love with a person. I hadn't really thought about it to that point, but when he mentioned this, I realized I had put a lot of what I had felt about Ashley on the page, if only to change the names and circumstances around. Even so, the emotions were there, and that's when I kind of figured out that, somewhere along the line, I had fallen head-over-heels in love with Ashley, and that was what had hurt so badly about her rejection.

Past that point, however, as I passed out of college and moved on with life, I found myself more and more isolated once again. I had purposefully forgotten as much as I could about Ashley and everything she'd ever made me feel. For all intents and purposes, I thought I had finally put that chapter of my life to bed and could move on, and I had -- up until a few months ago.

The first time I laid eyes on this girl at work -- we'll call her ""Dee"" -- it was like a riptide of nostalgia had come out of nowhere and pulled my feet right out from under me. Everything I had ever felt for Ashley before suddenly came flooding back as I almost swore I saw her ghost for a moment. Dee carried that same peaceful and pleasant aura with her with every step she took. She was pretty yes, but she was oh-so-much-more than that, somehow.

And, like the reboot of an old series, I suddenly felt that same desire as before -- I *needed* to know her. I had to meet her. My heart and every fiber of my being wanted to be immersed in her presence and just... *be.*

Now, for a while, I managed to resist. I have grown a lot since my youth, I've matured, and I immediately put a firm damper on myself, partly out of fear, and partly out of self-defense probably. I told myself even without knowing that she had to have a boyfriend or husband. She won't stop or talk or introduce herself. She's not interested. She's not in the market. She's out of your league. Etc., etc., ad infinitum. Anything and everything to try and kill it in the cradle. I didn't want to go through what I'd felt before because *to this* *day, all these years later,* I still bear the scars from my previous attempts, and that pain of rejection never really heals, especially when you've only felt such desire once.

Of course, however, no matter how hard I tried to tell myself otherwise, no matter how badly I wanted to convince myself that I would dearly regret it. I knew it would only end in heartbreak. But as I kept learning little things about her -- I accidentally passed by her desk one day and happened to learn her name, a coworker would mention her in passing, the two of us would share a ""hi"" as she would walk past my desk occasionally. We would never say much, but like before, every little moment I ever got to spend just in her presence, whether we would exchange words or not, were always the best, brightest part of my otherwise lonely and largely-meaningless days. Even my good days were only made even better when I saw her, and the sharpest edges of my worst ones were smoothed over when I would imagine her leaning on my shoulder, stroking my hair and just being with me.

Like a dam can hold back only so much water, though, I could only keep back how I felt for so long before Mother Nature's fucking curse finally won out.

It had been twenty years since I had previously approached a girl. Needless to say, in spite of all my practice and teaching myself how to ""act normal"" around others through the years, I had next to none in trying to approach a girl that my heart so badly wanted. The first time I remember giving in and speaking with her was rather impromptu. Though one of my coworkers had introduced us before, I had never really attempted to strike up an actual conversation with Dee before. That changed when I had asked her how her weekend had been the Monday after. Her answer of what amounted to ""meh"" was like a fuse being lit. I managed to hold my tongue the first time, but as we passed by later that day, I (rather awkwardly -- even *very* awkwardly) made the suggestion that if she wanted to do something together, maybe we could go to Cars and Coffee of a Saturday morning together.

Trying to think logically at the time, I had made the suggestion to try and introduce a bit of myself and my interests, while also hoping she would agree so perhaps we could spend a bit of time together doing something fun. (I'm quite old-fashioned, so I'd like to try and get to know someone to know they are who they seem to be before trying to enter into a proto-relationship.) Dee rather... awkwardly agreed (""Yeahsure!) before quickly turning away and heading back towards her desk.

In hindsight, that should have been my first hint to slam on the brakes -- strike one. Instead, of course, trying to remain hopeful, I put it in the ""ball"" column. After all, maybe she had been in a hurry, right? She could have been busy that day. She didn't necessarily feel weirded out by my out-of-the-blue proposal that *certainly* didn't come across as a completely idiotic attempt to ask her out completely at random.

Surely! :eyeroll:

Now, I work closely with a manager, my supervisor, whom he and I are kind of casually acquainted at this point. I didn't really have anyone else to talk to about this sort of thing, but (we'll call him) ""Jay"" had mentioned that he didn't think she was seeing anyone. I had mentioned Dee in passing before, so he had an idea of what was on my mind. As Dee was passing by my desk later in the week, I'd had some time to reflect on what I had said and wanted to have a chance to clarify. In the past, I had confided with Jay how I felt -- how Dee was the light of my day, and how I only wanted her to look in my direction and see me. With his encouragement and him describing the joy of ""seeing their face light up"", I had finally worked up enough courage to try to have a moment with her. I had asked her in passing if she would mind if we talked a moment after she came back from where she was going.

You can probably guess, at this point, she never *did* come back to talk, and that felt like a body blow in itself.

Strike, the second.

It was the following week when I'd pulled myself together enough to try and came up with more excuses for why she hadn't come back. (Are you seeing the despair and desperation in my thought patterns yet? I know I'm pathetic, so no need to remind me.) One particular day that week I'd had to step out at lunch for a dental appointment, so my thought was that I would ask as I was leaving if she would be interested in going and grabbing a bite to eat together sometime.

""I don't think so.""

That should have been strike three. I should have stopped the bleeding, cut my losses, and walked away right then and there. Should have. And, if I were wired differently maybe, I most certainly would have, just to try and avoid the real rejection that I knew would come if I didn't give up. For several weeks after I distanced myself, trying desperately to get out of this self-destructive spiral I was in. No matter what I tried, no matter how much I tried to find anything I could to free myself from her gravity, Dee stayed on my mind, and I couldn't break free. I still wanted her as badly as I ever had before, and I knew that probably would never change.

The lovesick fool in me, however, and whatever is fucked up in my head wouldn't let go of it, though. I remember happening to hold the door open for her one morning -- I had forgotten my badge and had to get the parking code to get into the garage. She had just so happened to enter as I was going out to my car to move it from the customer lot when she smiled at me and said a simple, ""Thanks, Anon (me).""

It felt like I was hooked all over again. No matter how many times I screamed internally that she just was saying thank you for the courtesy, my curse simply refused to die no matter what unhinged thing I tried to conjure up to kill it.

It was a while longer before I acted again. I finally managed to wrest back a little bit of my logic, and again I was trying to keep it buried and respect her space and what I presumed to be her decision. I knew what I needed was distance, time, and isolation from her, and I kept as much of it as I could for quite a while. I'm not sure what sparked it, but one day as I was passing by Dee's desk to retrieve some supplies, I mentioned in passing a funny story that happened that morning to me, when I had missed a patch of hair during my morning grooming. She wound up laughing a bit and we had a brief conversation. She didn't seem offended by my presence, and I was simply over the moon to feel like I might have broken the ice a little.

Dee, however, was simply playing it cool, as I would later find out.

I would tell her again the next day how the guys at game night had reacted to my story and the nickname ""Patches"" that they had given me, and how they joked that I looked ""mangy"". Again, she seemed somewhat amused, and even a bit interested in my gaming group. Again, I felt like maybe I was finally letting her see through to the real, more open part of me that I had struggled so long with. I didn't go over to visit every day, lest I come across as suffocating, and I always kept in the back of my mind that we were acquaintances at best, but whether I wanted it or not, an ember of hope still flickered within me that maybe she would come to like me for me.

It was shortly before the holiday when I had started letting my thoughts run away with my heart again, and I was watching a psychology video that had popped up on how to recognize your feelings for what they are. For whatever reason, the video took me back to my college writing course, and I had sat down out of curiosity again to see what I could pen when I thought of Dee. Like before, when I had thought of Ashley, the words just flowed from my fingertips and onto the page. In a single evening I had composed a poem longer than any I ever had in my life, rhymes and all. I spent hours tweaking a word here, rearranging passages there, and only at the end of it did I really understand that I had fallen in love with this girl who I barely even knew.

It felt like a weight was lifted off my chest when I finally decided to admit it to myself. ""I'm in love with this girl, and I would blissfully spend every moment of the rest of my life to try to make her feel as happy and as precious and as loved as humanly possible."" 

Don't even ask me how I could possibly feel this way if I barely knew the first thing about her -- I don't know how it works myself. I don't know if my desperation and loneliness conspired together to convince me I was, maybe I just convinced myself with the smoldering ruins of what remained of my optimism, or maybe it was even some kind of spiritual draw or something else beyond comprehension. At the risk of coming across as a little stalker-y, all I knew in that moment was that I would have given anything for someone to feel the same way I felt about Dee about me. I cannot begin to describe how badly all my life I have needed someone to care about me that way. I was smitten by this puppy love-like feeling, and I so badly wanted my partner to some day be her.

As the holiday drew closer I began to have thoughts about how I could best express myself. How could I show her what she had inexplicably come to mean to me? I've known a long time now that I best communicate in *any* manner other than spoken word, and the written one has always been a far superior  talent of mine. Again, being the old-fashioned lame-ass sap that I am, I immediately turned to the thought of hand-writing out the perfected version of the poem I had written while thinking of Dee. I wanted my efforts just as much as my words to express just how much and how highly I thought of her and how much happiness just thinking about her brought me, just like the poets of yore. In their spirit, I had planned to purchase a piece of parchment and artificially age it with a lighter and practice the art of calligraphy. I was eying a beautiful red satin lace ribbon to tie the letter together in a heart shape, and was searching for a unique long-stem rose to slip into the rolled sheet and present it to her later that next month for the upcoming Christmas and New Year holiday.

Now, in our workplace, some secret individuals had begun leaving little ""critters"" hidden about the office to find as kind of a fun little morale booster. I wasn't interested in the collecting, just the hunt, and I had helped my coworkers amass quite a collection each. At some point, however, I had heard through the grapevine that Dee was trying to collect some of these critters and I had happened to find one while away from my desk. I had tried to Secret Santa it to her by leaving it on the edge of her desk without being seen. Then, a few hours later, towards the end of the day, I heard a gentle knocking at my desk. My heart skipped a beat at first when I saw Dee standing there, holding that figurine that I had gifted her. Some foolish part of me thought in that moment that maybe she had come to express gratitude for the gift. And then, the words came.

""I am *not* interested.""

And for all the gleaming, warm, happy dreams I had built in my mind for months of what a life of love, compassion, care, and warmth might be like, it all evaporated instantly in a burning cloud of ash and ruin. The only reply I could even muster as ice filled my veins was a meager and pathetic little, ""Sorry for bothering you."" I'd never felt so small and worthless and unwanted and insignificant in my entire life. I've never experienced despair and depression this dark and deep before. The warm and happy dreams I had become accustomed to for those few months were replaced by being alone in that hallway holding out that refused carnation to empty air and those judging eyes on me all over again. All of my ""what ifs"" turned into ""why bothers"", and that glimmer of hope that I had that maybe one day I would find that one light in this otherwise-darkening world went out forever.

I don't know if anyone has ever experienced something like I've gone through. I'd like to think that I'm not the only one left these days who has put their entire life's highest hopes in finding that love that lasts a lifetime and just brightens the entire world around you. I don't know what's wrong with me and why I can't let go of things I know are out of my reach. I wish I could just turn it off and live more like a truly normal person, rather than this sad, lonely, and miserable excuse for an existence. I don't know what else worthwhile life has to offer outside of loving someone, but it's the one thing I held on a pedestal above all else. I always believed it was the greatest thing anyone could ever aspire to in life was to give yourself to someone, body, mind, and spirit.

Now I just don't know what's left anymore. I don't know if anyone ever bothers to read a post this size, but I have no one to talk to about it, and I just wanted to find somewhere to vent my emotions where maybe someone out there might have some idea what I'm feeling. I just wanted to feel seen for a moment.",1,1734143556.0,Vent,0,1.0,False

But does anyone happen to know off the top of their head why they would be involved in this? Crimestoppers?  How do yall feel about it? I kinda have mixed feelings because honestly they were involved in modding for a long time and I‚Äôve wondered if they were ever involved.  NOT ACCUSING, was just wondering.

1hdsx30,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hdsx30,Liquid AIO performance decreased after only a Year and a Half,"So back in July 2023 I bought an MSI Mag CoreLiquid 280R AIO and installed it on my setup. I regularly run some routine tests on my pc once in a while in order to check its running state and make sure everything‚Äôs always ok. Yesterday I ran a multi core stress test on cinebech while monitoring temps and noticed all of the 6 cores of my 9600k reaching 100 degrees Celsius almost immediately (like 3/4 seconds after starting the test). I‚Äôve found a picture of the temps I took a couple of days after  installing the AIO in 2023 while I was testing the cpu overclocked at 5.0 GHz, temps were stable at 85 degrees while running the same cinebench test back in the day. Anyway that same day I ended up clocking it down to 4.8 due to slight instability caused by some voltage drops at 5.0 GHz and I‚Äôve been running that overclock since then with no problems whatsoever. So it‚Äôs clear that the AIO isn‚Äôt performing as it should after just 1.5 years of work.
I checked the AIO temps by touching it, everything seems to function as intended; one tube is hot while the other one is cooler, I feel the water flowing and hear the pump functioning, however there‚Äôs one anomaly, the radiator gets partially hot and the rest remains cold to the touch. The only parts I‚Äôm feeling significantly hot are the ones on the top edge of the radiator where the hot liquid ‚Äúintake‚Äù is, then it gradually feels cooler while sliding my hand downward (I‚Äôll include a pic of how the radiator is mounted to make sure you understand what I‚Äôm talking about) also basically all parts of the radiator heatsink feel cold as ice except the part where the pump is mounted.
I‚Äôve read that this specific model of AIO from msi suffered some severe clogging problems for a lot of users. What do you think the issue could be? Just some air bubbles or a clogged radiator?

P.S. the first pic is the temps back in 2023 with the cpu clocked at 5.0 GHz while the other one was taken today with the cpu clocked at 4.8 GHz

Often speak too fast and often. During any season.

It‚Äôs annoying because I was told that‚Äôs normal for everyone.

Who end up doing nothing but translate.

Obviously that must mean the days all end the same for them

Selfishly I believe they try to add dimension to their lives by reading poetry.

And they smile when it‚Äôs about colorful women and unorthodox parallels about humanity.

***One:***

An awful, ungodly stench struck Charlie the moment he opened the creaking front door of the nearly abandoned apartment complex. He winced, reflexively jerking his face away from the entryway so that his lungs might find new air. The thief‚Äôs chest audibly rattled as he voraciously sucked in the atmosphere outside the doorway, hand still gripping the brass doorknob. Curious, Theo leaned into the building, inhaling a sample of the escaping vapors. With a chastising shake of his head, he exhaled, chuckling as he did. The younger of the two thieves ducked under Charlie‚Äôs arm and pushed forward, seizing the opportunity emasculate his colleague‚Äôs fragile sensibilities - teasing him for being so dumbstruck by an aroma. However, Theo‚Äôs chronic sinusitis had diminished his sense of smell, unbeknownst to his older colleague. So, despite Theo being able to detect the potent aroma, it was unable to restrain him like it did Charlie.

Theo admired Charlie as a mentor and felt a hint of jealousy towards him, so he found satisfaction in having something to hold over his head. His untimely demise in one of these flats would prevent Theo from ever disclosing this admiration.

‚Äú*C‚Äômon now, old man. No time to stop and smell the roses,*‚Äù Theo mocked, now leisurely strolling down the narrow, dimly lit lobby.

He wanted to move himself along, imaging himself running ahead to overtake Theo. But Charlie could not force his body through the partition and further into the corrosive scent, the intensity of which continued to increase as more stale air poured from the dilapidated building. Charlie struggled to identify what exactly could produce such a foul odor. It was acrid and gamey, reminiscent of meat spoiled in the summer sun; but at the same time, it also had a metallic and artificial quality, similar to the inside of a bustling factory. Stagnant, putrefied water closely resembled the stench, he considered, but it didn‚Äôt quite match.

Instead of following Theo in, Charlie raised a defiant middle finger as he bent over to retrieve the Vicks Vaporub from his backpack. From somewhere further down the hallway, he heard his partner flippantly squawk about Charlie‚Äôs feminine constitution. As he listened to the continued goading, Charlie could not fathom how Theo had developed such a bravado. The man was nearly as broke as he him, he had no girlfriend, and he carted around a body shaped like a neglected pear, one that had sat in the fruit bowl for a few too many days - rotting and sagging in all the wrong places. With Theo somehow¬†*still*¬†chattering on, Charlie sighed and smeared the waxy material over the crest of his upper lip as a barrier against the assaulting odor.

He wasn‚Äôt much better in comparison, though, Charlie lamented to himself. Gaunt and skeletal, he stood at a monstrous six foot seven inches. Though potentially commanding, his great height was offset by a total absence of muscle. Last time he checked, his weight clocked in at just shy of one hundred and twenty pounds. If Theo resembled a decaying pear, Charlie embodied an anemic popsicle stick. Perhaps, he mused, he and Theo were actually a perfect match - both objects that had well outlived their usefulness and only truly belonged at the heart of a landfill.

He at least possessed some companionship, he reflected, however meager it may be. Charlie could not stand the notion of being truly, utterly alone. He had grown to avoid it at all costs.

Protected from the disabling scent, Charlie took a beat to more thoroughly survey the street. Not that there was that much to see. The area was completely deserted and dilapidated, devoid of any sign of human habitation. That wasn‚Äôt always the case, though. Lutzwater boulevard used to represent the cornerstone of the city‚Äôs downtown, with this apartment complex acting as the linchpin that held it all together. Charlie relocated from the suburbs to the city at age ten, and could remember well the awe that the street‚Äôs opulence and glamour inspired when he rode his bike past with friends. A lot can change in thirty years, though. What remained was a mere shadow of what this place had once been. The many competing taverns and night clubs closed, the rowhomes that once contained up-and-coming senators and actors were derelict, and Lutzwater Heights, the nexus of it all, was almost empty. Only the son of the original owners, Christian, still resided inside, at least according to Theo‚Äôs contact.

Charlie didn‚Äôt let his eyes linger on any one part of Lutzwater boulevard for too long. The destruction was just too depressing, and in a certain sense, symbolic - the beauty of life and the promise of abundance in childhood turning to ash and shit as he aged.

One tiny piece of the deteriorating scenery, however, did strike Charlie in a way that gave him pause - it was something he had never noticed before. At its peak, Lutzwater Heights showcased an immaculately groomed front garden. Ochre and lavender flowers lined the entrance, greeting longtime residents, guests, and prospective residents of the prestigious building with an equal enthusiasm. Similar to the surrounding area, the garden had devolved into an abandoned wasteland, consisting only of overgrown shrubs and discarded liquor bottles. Close to his location at the stoop of the building, on the edge of the dead garden, however, sat a well that he did not recognize. He rode past the apartment complex thousands of times during his youth, and somehow never noticed the stone hatch with the accompanying wooden frame and bucket before now. The object‚Äôs presence was jarring against the backdrop of the dilapidated, contemporary architecture - and it would have been¬†*even more*¬†out of place when the location was at its prime. Now, it was able to partially conceal its uncanniness among the ruins. But thirty years ago, a pillory or a telephone booth sprouting out of the garden would have been less conspicuous than the well.

That said, it couldn‚Äôt have been new. To Charlie, that was infinitely more incomprehensible.

Another whiff of the horrible aroma broke his trance and reoriented Charlie to his current purpose on Lutzwater boulevard; Christian Lutzwater and his theoretical wealth. With information passed along from another career criminal, Theo believed there was a fortune hidden somewhere in the bubbling carcass of what¬†*used*¬†to be Lutzwater Heights, despite his parent‚Äôs real estate ventures going up in financial flames after their abrupt and cryptic disappearance over two decades ago.

*No idea how he could live with this fucking smell*,¬†Charlie thought, zipping his bag and placing the Vaporub in his coat pocket, assuming correctly that he would need to reapply the wax a few more times during their scheduled security system consultation/covert casing of the building and their target. Before following Theo into Lutzwater Heights, he rummaged through his wallet for coins to throw down the well, seeking to obtain good fortune from the pagan deities who might be able to affect the outcome of their so-called business venture. Without looking away from the inside of his wallet, he stood up and began to pace towards the well.

Unexpectedly, a sharp pain crackled from his big toe and radiated through his foot. Not paying attention, Charlie had slammed his boot into the well‚Äôs hard stone mid-stride. Apparently, he had misjudged his distance between the stoop, himself, and the well. Charlie felt sure that it had been a meter away, at least it had been before he started searching for coins, but the new throbbing discomfort sincerely disagreed with his previous assessment.

Apparently, the well was practically next to him.

Absentmindedly, he tossed the coins into the abyss without gazing into its inky depths. But as he did, pain and confusion had sidetracked his intended wish. Seeing Theo turn a corner and disappear from view, his mind was instead dragged back to its more fundamental concern as he provided the well with its tithe.

With his subconscious behind the wheel, Charlie wished to never be alone again.

As soon as the coins were swallowed by the blackness, the well instantly began to exude the ungodly odor, like fumes exploding from an exhaust pipe. Charlie didn‚Äôt understand what had changed, but he the let vapors propel him into action, finally sprinting to catch up with Theo. As he entered Lutzwater Heights, Charlie thought he heard the metal clink against the well‚Äôs bottom, but there was something off about that, too. The sound he heard wasn‚Äôt exactly that of a handful of coins briefly clattering against stone. Instead, a sort of quiet but frantic skittering emanated from somewhere in the darkness, like thousands of human nails tapping nervously against chalk - almost in perfect synchrony, but not quite.

\----------------------------------------------

***Two:***

Christian Lutzwater looked profoundly unwell. Huge, dark half-moons shadowed the flesh below his eyes, pulling his face down so much that he appeared unshakably joyless, the resulting creases injecting a deep gloom into every facial expression he could manifest. By Theo‚Äôs estimation, the man was only forty years old, but his emaciated cheeks and greying comb-over could have given anyone the impression that he was, at best, pushing sixty. Despite those features, his well-pressed, blue pin-stripe suit and solid black tie indicated he was still interested in appearances. At the kitchen table in the building‚Äôs largest suite, situated at the very back of the third floor, the thieves watched as Christian humbly brewed them a pot of coffee. As he did, Charlie clandestinely scanned the area, determining where they could install a remote camera or two when he wasn‚Äôt paying attention.

*‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶where do you need the cameras? In the entrance, the alleyways‚Ä¶?*¬†Theo paused, hoping Christian would pick up where he left off.

Despite not being an employee at Charlie‚Äôs security agency, Theo seemed to enjoy steering the consultations, occasionally giving the impression to their soon-to-be victims that he ran the company or that security was a family business he grew up in. In actuality, Theo didn‚Äôt know the first thing about installing security systems. Yet, his self-assured manner brought the trust of their targets more often than it didn‚Äôt.

As long as Theo successfully pulled off the his part in the robberies while wearing the uniform Charlie stole for him, he happily relinquished control. Time and time again, the blueprint worked. From Charlie‚Äôs perspective, why mess with a good thing just to feed his ego?

The operation was both clever and profitable. The thieves would steal from their marks a few days¬†*prior*¬†to installing the purchased security systems, which helped them avoid suspicion. It was a simple and easy to execute plan: they would attend consultations with their marks, confirm that they had valuable belongings and no preexisting security measures, and then they would strike. The marks suspected their wealth needed better monitoring - that‚Äôs why they had reached out to Charlie‚Äôs company in the first place, so it was no surprise when a burglary actually came to pass. After many of their targets were robbed, their only lingering regret was that they had not called Theo and Charlie sooner, as they imagined a security system may have been able to prevent the financial losses.

*‚ÄúThere are several sewer grates around the periphery of the property, a majority of them near the parking lot, ""*¬†Christian remarked matter-of-factly.

*‚ÄúI need them all covered by a remote video feed that I can have access to.‚Äù*

Theo, for all his virtues, did not have a talent for improvisation, and Christian‚Äôs answer had caught him off-guard. Stunned and at a loss, Theo turned to Charlie for help.

*‚Äú‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not sure that will cover the front gate or the entrance, Mr. Lutzwater.‚Äù*¬†Charlie mumbled, who was also recovering from the overwhelming strangeness of his original response.

*Who the hell would try to enter the complex through the fucking sewers?*

From across the kitchen table, Christian set his pallid gaze on Charlie, visibly upset by the insinuation that he didn‚Äôt know what he wanted. He was not accustomed to being questioned by anyone, let alone by some blue-collar nobody. Slowly, however, his expression melted from righteous indignation back to its baseline, sorrowful state. Only after a short time did Mr. Lutzwater grasp that his request could be seen as outlandish to anyone unaware of what writhed within his apartment complex.

Without breaking eye contact with Charlie, he slowly conjured a synthetic grin to his face, the corners of his mouth seemingly held up and in position by imperceptible marionette strings.

*‚ÄúOf course, the entrance will need to be monitored as well. I mentioned the sewer grates first because we‚Äôve had local children spraying graffiti on those areas - seems like I can‚Äôt get it off my mind,‚Äù*¬†he replied, following the statement with a mechanical chuckle and a sip of his coffee.

Feeling like the flow of conversation was back on track, Theo eagerly returned to the fold.

*‚ÄúYou sure you don‚Äôt want a camera for your apartment, too? Can never be too safe with gangs of delinquents roaming the streets,‚Äù*¬†Theo proclaimed with a toothy smile.

*‚ÄúOh, I don‚Äôt live here, young man. I visit the property daily to make sure everything is still somewhat maintained, but I‚Ä¶but I certainly don‚Äôt sleep here.‚Äù*

A subtle tremor of fear creeped into Christian‚Äôs voice when he implied he would¬†*never*¬†spend the night at Lutzwater Heights. Not only did the prospect of sleeping here scare him, but it appeared like he believed he said something that he should not have. He abruptly shifted the conversation to finalizing his order. After signing the agreement, he excused himself to the restroom, allowing Charlie the opportunity to plant a small camera into the kitchen‚Äôs smoke detector.

*‚ÄúOkay gentleman,‚Äù*¬†Christian proclaimed as he returned from the bathroom, sitting down across from Charlie as he did,¬†*‚ÄúI believe we have negotiated the first part of the deal‚Ä¶‚Äù*

‚Äú*What other parts are there, sir?‚Äù*¬†Charlie interjected. Mr. Lutzwater had already signed and paid for the security system. The older thief turned to his left, looking to see if his younger compatriot understood what Christian meant. But he was not at the table. Charlie darted his head wildly around its axis, trying to locate where Theo had gotten off to. Just moments before, he‚Äôd been beside Charlie, yet there had been no sounds of a chair scraping or Theo‚Äôs footsteps to suggest he‚Äôd left the table while he was briefly distracted by Mr. Lutzwater‚Äôs return.

When Charlie‚Äôs gaze found its way back to Christian, terror bloomed thick and ravenous deep within his chest. His pulse quickened, blood vibrating ferociously through his entire body. He blinked over and over again, but the image in front of him did not change.

Without warning, Mr. Lutzwater‚Äôs face has evolved into something else entirely.

*‚ÄúYou know what I mean, Charlie. How many times have we had this conversation? I need your answer. I need your answer now.‚Äù*

The phrase seeped listlessly out of one Christian‚Äôs new cavities. All of his facial features had been replaced by three oval slits, overflowing with impenetrable, inky darkness. Two vertical slits run parallel to each other over the top two-thirds of his skull, with one horizontal slit laying flatly under the both of them on the bottom third. The steel-blue skin in between the holes was smooth and blemishless, but it appeared dangerously taut, like a plastic bag that had been filled to brim and was primed to split and rupture at any moment - or, maybe, that tightness had already caused the skin to break, resulting in the three slits that were currently staring at him.

Charlie‚Äôs aching psyche interpreted the slits as a face, but they looked just as much like the holes in a power outlet as they did two long eyes and one even longer mouth. Yes, language had come from it, but the words had not emanated from his so-called ""mouth"". Instead, the statement leaked out of what Charlie assumed was Christian‚Äôs new left eye, causing the crevasse to widen slightly and tremble as it did.

*‚ÄúYou made your request - a cure for loneliness. That is something we can provide, but at a cost. We will want the first of your bloodline, as payment for our generosity.‚Äù*

*‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I‚Ä¶‚Äù*¬†Charlie blubbered.

In response to his indecision, all three slits began to ripple soundlessly, like a frustrated scream imperceptible to Charlie was being unleashed from all three orifices simultaneously.

Every night since the consultation, he had experienced the same nightmare. It always started as a memory, a replaying of events, but inevitably culminated with Christian‚Äôs transformation. But this was first one where he had actually answered the question. All the times before, the vision ended before he had made a decision.

For the remaining three days prior to the heist, Charlie‚Äôs sleep would be barren and nightmareless, but it would not be restful.

In that last nightmare, he agreed to the terms.

\------------

Each day, Theo checked the hidden camera‚Äôs recorded feed. In doing so, he determined that there may be something valuable secretly stored within the third-floor suite. In addition, he had confirmed that no one else currently lived inside Lutzwater Heights. No room had been rented out for at least half a decade.

Christian was not lying when he claimed that he visited the premises daily. Every day, about an hour before sundown like clockwork, Mr. Lutzwater would enter the apartment. Without wasting a second, he would pace over urgently to a painting on the wall. He would pull it aside, revealing that it was connected to the wall on a hinge. Because of the camera‚Äôs position, it was impossible to discern what lay beyond the painting; the camera‚Äôs angle hid that view. However, Christian very clearly took a key that hung around his neck, inserted it into something on the wall, and then reached in to the wall. To Theo, that meant there must be cash, jewelry, or something similarly worth our trouble concealed in that space.

Charlie squinted at the footage proudly displayed by Theo from his old and well-worn laptop. Something caught his eye that the younger thief had neglected to mention.

His lips were moving.

*‚ÄúWho do you think he‚Äôs talking to?‚Äù*¬†Charlie asked, praying that Theo had a good explanation.

*‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶he‚Äôs probably on a call. Bluetooth or something,‚Äù*¬†Theo replied while scratching the side of his head, clearly unbothered by the finding.

*‚ÄúHm. Yeah, I guess that makes sense.‚Äù*¬†Charlie halfheartedly remarked, lying mostly to himself in that moment. There was no evidence to back-up Theo‚Äôs deduction. Christian didn‚Äôt appear to have ear buds in, nor did he ever take out a phone to indicate he was taking a call, and whenever he was in that apartment, his lips were¬†*always*¬†moving.

But the camera never caught anyone else in that apartment, Charlie told himself.

Theo must be right.

company. You hustle, grind, and soon enough, your business takes off like a rocket. Next thingyou know, you‚Äôre a billionaire. But dealing with Chinese regulations? Yeah, no thanks. Youdecide to relocate the entire company to a small, obscure European island. Why? Because it‚Äôsfar from the prying eyes of government regulators.

With your company booming, you become one of the richest people in the world, with more than$60 billion to your name. That‚Äôs right, billions. And as if that wasn‚Äôt enough, your customers loveyou. Not just for your product, but for your personality. You become a public figure, a financialrock star, with more Twitter followers than Billie Eilish. Think about that for a second: a financialCEO is outpacing one of the biggest pop stars on social media. Your power? Unmatched.You‚Äôve got the world in the palm of your hand‚Äîmoney, fame, influence. You‚Äôre untouchable. Orat least, you think you are.

But there‚Äôs one tiny detail you overlooked. In 1970, the US government passed a law, the BankSecrecy Act, that forces every financial company to act as a spy-arm for them. By law, you'resupposed to track every American citizen‚Äôs financial transactions and report them to the feds.And if you don‚Äôt? Well, let‚Äôs just say Uncle Sam doesn‚Äôt like it when you don‚Äôt play by his rules.But here‚Äôs the thing: you're not American. Neither is your company. So, logically, none of thisshould matter to you, right?

Wrong. Despite not being American, despite your company not operating on US soil, the long
arm of the US government doesn‚Äôt care. You're too powerful, too influential, and you can‚Äôt just
dodge Uncle Sam that easily.

One day, without warning, you're sitting in your luxury villa on your private island, sipping yourimported coffee, when you get a call. It‚Äôs not a business call. It‚Äôs not even a PR call. It‚Äôs a legalcall. The US government has indicted you for violating their financial laws‚Äîlaws that you didn‚Äôteven think applied to you.

You laugh it off at first. I mean, you don‚Äôt even live in the US! But then it gets real. Your assets inUS banks? Frozen. Your ability to travel freely? Gone. And before you know it, you're detainedat an airport in Seattle during a business trip, caught by U.S. authorities who were waiting foryou.

Suddenly, all that wealth, all that power, means nothing. You're escorted to prison like some
common criminal, facing charges for not playing ball with the government‚Äôs surveillancemachine. And here‚Äôs the kicker: it doesn‚Äôt matter that your company was based offshore. Itdoesn‚Äôt matter that you weren‚Äôt American. If you so much as touched a dollar in their system,you‚Äôre under their thumb.

In the end, it didn‚Äôt matter how rich, powerful, or distant you thought you were. The USgovernment is the ultimate power broker, and when they decide to come for you, nothing canprotect you.",0,1734142432.0,CryptoCurrency,17,0.5,False
