1rayc2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnchartedMen/comments/1rayc2m/how_to_transform_your_voice_in_9_minutes/,How to Transform Your Voice in 9 Minutes: Science-Based Vocal Training That Actually Works,"I spent way too long sounding like a nervous teenager in every meeting. You know that feeling when you hear your voice on a recording and physically cringe? Yeah, that was me for years.

Here's what nobody tells you: your voice isn't fixed. It's malleable. I dove deep into research from speech pathologists, vocal coaches, and even some wild studies on testosterone and vocal resonance. Turns out, most of us are using maybe 30% of our actual vocal potential. We're walking around with Ferrari engines but driving like it's a Toyota Corolla.

The game changer? I stopped trying to ""deepen"" my voice artificially (that shit sounds fake) and started training the muscles and habits that naturally produce a richer sound. This isn't about faking it. It's about unlocking what's already there.

## The 9 Minute Morning Routine

**Diaphragmatic Breathing (2 mins)**

Most people breathe from their chest like they're constantly anxious. Shallow breathing = thin, weak voice. You need to breathe from your belly like a baby does naturally.

* Lie on your back, put a book on your stomach
* Breathe in through your nose for 4 counts, the book should rise
* Hold for 4, exhale for 6 counts
* Your chest barely moves, all the action is in your belly

Do this every morning. It retrains your default breathing pattern. Once this becomes automatic, your voice gains natural power without you even thinking about it. The science is solid here, deeper breathing = better vocal cord vibration = richer tone.

**Humming Exercises (3 mins)**

This is straight from ""The Art of Voice Acting"" by James Alburger. Guy's coached thousands of professionals and he swears by humming to find your natural resonance.

* Start humming at a comfortable pitch
* Slowly slide down to the lowest comfortable note
* Feel the vibration in your chest, not your throat
* Stay at that low pitch and hum different sounds: mmm, nnn, nggg
* This is your chest voice, this is where power lives

When you hum correctly, you should feel your chest vibrating like a speaker. That's resonance. That's what makes voices sound ""rich."" Do this for 3 minutes and your vocal cords wake up properly.

**Pitch Variation Practice (2 mins)**

Monotone voices are the fastest way to sound unconfident. You need range. I use an app called Vocular for this, it's weirdly addictive.

The app analyzes your voice in real time and shows you your pitch range and deepness score compared to other voices. It gamifies voice training basically. You can see when you're speaking from your chest vs your throat. When I started, my average pitch was 142Hz. Three months later? 118Hz. The difference is night and day.

* Read a paragraph out loud, varying your pitch naturally
* Record yourself, listen back
* Notice when your voice sounds strained vs relaxed
* The relaxed moments? That's your real voice

**Tongue Twisters for Articulation (2 mins)**

A deep voice that mumbles is useless. You need clarity. This part is weirdly fun once you get into it.

* ""Unique New York, Unique New York"" (10 times, getting faster)
* ""Red leather, yellow leather"" (same deal)
* ""The lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue"" (focus on crisp consonants)

Clear articulation makes your voice sound more authoritative even if it's not super deep. It's like the difference between a sharp photo and a blurry one, same subject, totally different impact.

## The Habits That Actually Matter

**Hydration isn't bullshit**

Your vocal cords are mucous membranes. When they're dry, they don't vibrate properly. I keep a water bottle on my desk and aim for half a gallon daily minimum. Also, cut back on coffee if you can. I know, I know, but caffeine dehydrates you and tightens your throat.

**Posture changes everything**

Slouching compresses your diaphragm and makes you sound weaker. I read ""The New Rules of Posture"" by Mary Bond and realized I'd been sabotaging my voice for years just by how I sat. Stand or sit up straight, shoulders back but relaxed, chin parallel to the ground. Instant voice improvement.

**Stop throat clearing**

This was a tough habit to break. Throat clearing damages your vocal cords over time. If you need to clear your throat, swallow instead or do a gentle hum. Check out the YouTube channel Institute for Vocal Advancement, they have a whole video on this that explains the anatomy.

**Morning voice is actually optimal**

Your voice is naturally deeper in the morning because your vocal cords are relaxed and slightly swollen from lying down. Try to notice how your voice feels then, that relaxed quality is what you want to maintain all day.

## The Resources That Actually Helped

""Set Your Voice Free"" by Roger Love is hands down the best book I found. Love has coached Brad Pitt, Jeff Bridges, basically everyone in Hollywood with a great voice. He breaks down the physiology of voice production in ways that actually make sense. The exercises are practical, not theatrical. After reading this, I understood why my voice sounded thin, I was literally using the wrong muscles.

If you want to go deeper into communication skills without spending hours reading dense books, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from resources like Roger Love's work, speech pathology research, and expert talks on vocal presence. You can set a goal like ""improve my vocal confidence and speaking presence"" and it generates personalized audio lessons and a structured learning plan based on your needs.

What makes it useful is you can customize the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples and techniques. Plus you can adjust the voice and tone, some people use a calm, instructional style while others prefer something more energetic. It's built by a team from Columbia and Google, so the content quality is solid and science-backed. Worth checking out if you're serious about leveling up communication skills beyond just vocal training.

""The Improve Your Voice"" podcast by Ita Olsen is solid for ongoing tips. She's a speech pathologist who works with people recovering from vocal injuries, so she really knows the anatomy. Episodes are short, like 10-15 mins, perfect for morning commutes.

For tracking progress, besides Vocular, I also used the app Voice Tools. It's free and gives you real time feedback on pitch, volume, and vocal fry (that crackling sound that makes you sound uncertain). Seeing the data helped me stay consistent because I could actually measure improvement.

## The Truth About Voice Training

Here's the thing everyone forgets: your voice is a muscle system. You wouldn't expect to get ripped doing one workout. This takes consistent daily practice, but 9 minutes is nothing. I do this routine while making coffee.

After three months of this, people started commenting. Colleagues said I sounded more confident in meetings. Friends asked if I was sick because my voice was ""different."" One person straight up asked if I'd been taking testosterone (I hadn't). The changes are subtle day to day but compound hard over time.

Your voice is how people perceive your confidence, authority, and presence. It's worth 9 minutes a day to optimize it. The research backs this up, vocal training improves how people rate your competence, attractiveness, and trustworthiness. Wild but true.

Start tomorrow morning. Do the breathing, the humming, the pitch work, the tongue twisters. Track it for 30 days and see what happens. Your voice is probably way better than you think, it just needs training

I love trying new restaurants and coffee shops, so would also love to be near some of that too. 

I’ll be working in El Segundo so would prefer to have an easy-ish commute to that area.

“Can I ask why?” Eric said, trying to keep his tone neutral. Quin looked at them from across the table but stayed silent.

“I want to understand,” Sandra said quietly. “Charamkaran might be the one who pushed him, but Tsrancomta was the one who tried to convince me the hardest. I want to know why.”

“Do you think that’s a good idea?” Eric asked. He looked at Sandra closely. “It won’t change his situation.”

“I was the one they were after initially,” Sandra said. “I should at least know why.” She met Eric’s gaze, blinking slowly while her tail curled and uncurled nervously. Eric nodded.

“If you think it’s a good idea, then I won’t stop you,” Eric said. “But just be aware that you might not be satisfied, or even like what he says.”

“I know,” Sandra said, “but I still want to know.”

“Alright,” Eric said, nodding. “But after training and lunch. And check in with Shao to see if he needs your help with the engines.”

“Thanks, Dad,” Sandra said, giving Eric a hug and clearing her spot of dishes.

“You really think that’s a good idea?” Quin asked softly when Sandra walked away.

“No, I really don’t,” Eric sighed. “But she’s right, she, more than anyone here, has the right to ask. I’m not going to stop her, at least, not in this regard.”

“If you say so,” Quin said. “I get the feeling you asked her to wait till later in the hopes she’ll forget.”

“Are you sure you’re not psychic?” Eric asked dryly.

“I’m getting a psychology license, so next best thing,” Quin said with a small smile. Eric just shook his head.

…………………………………..

Tsrancomta looked up from his hands when the door to his cell opened. He blinked but didn’t react when he saw Tsandrasto walk in, Eric right behind her and giving him a slight glare.

“You sure?” Eric asked.

“It’s fine, Dad, I just want to talk to him is all,” Tsandrasto said. Eric glared at Tsrancomta again before stepping out, the door to the cell closing as Tsanrdasto sat down in the one chair in the room. “How are you feeling?”

“What do you want?” Tsrancomta asked, looking back down at his hands.

“To talk,” Tsandrasto said. “I want to understand.”

Tsrancomta gave a hollow laugh. “Understand what? That we screwed up? That we were wrong? Or that our futures are now ruined?”

“I want to understand why,” Tsandrasto said.

“Does it matter?” Tsrancomta asked.

“Probably not,” Tsandrasto admitted. “But I feel like since I was the supposed reason, I have a right to know. So, I want to know.”

“There’s nothing to know,” Tsrancomta said. “We were just idiots, nothing more.”

“Seemed like a lot more to it than that,” Tsandrasto said quietly. “Even when he pointed a laser at me, Charamkaran said it was for my sake.”

“Cha’am,” Tsrancomta said after a moment of silence. “His name is Cha’am now. Targondian tradition makes him lose his name if he gets cut out of the family, which the captain has done. And if I get cut as well, my name will be Tsr’ta.” Tsandrasto nodded, as if it was what she wanted to hear. Tsrancomta knew it wasn’t, and didn’t want to tell her, but the words were coming out on their own now. “We were jealous, though Cha’am more than me. Targondians are almost always treated with suspicion or taken advantage of in the galaxy. If they aren’t suspicious of us, then they’re trying to upcharge us, and if they aren’t trying to do that, then they’re trying to kidnap us to sell on the black market or steal our stuff.” Tsrancomta shook his head. “Then we saw you, living with these weird aliens. You seemed shy at first, which is normal, but you were also happy with them. These humans, no suspicion, no trying to get anything from us, offered to fix up our ship, and you seemed genuinely happy to be with them.”

The words wouldn’t stop. Tsrancomta didn’t know if he was justifying himself or asking for an apology. It didn’t matter though. “They weren’t Targondian, and yet they treated us with respect and without suspicion. You were being raised, happy and healthy, by people that were not Targondians, and even being trained in skills for future job prospects. And then we heard that you had legally become adopted by the Humans.” Tsrancomta shook his head again. “something inside Cha’am snapped. His entire view on species outside of Targondians was shattered, and he didn’t like it. And I went along with it, because initially I thought something was suspicious. But then you stopped us in the ship.” Tsrancomta looked at Tsandrasto, his eyes hollow and pained. “Not the Humans, not the weird canines you keep around. You. That’s when I realized that none of it was fake. These humans were authentically trying to help us. Authentically giving you a family where you had none. They have their secrets, who doesn’t, but they actually were trying to be helpful. And we screwed it up.” Tsrancomta went back to looking at his hands. “You were just the excuse. The truth is, we kept looking for something that wasn’t there. And couldn’t accept that someone actually wanted to help us without expecting something in return.”

“Is that all there really was to it?” Tsandrasto asked quietly. Tsrancomta didn’t say anything else, and Tsandrasto nodded slowly. “Something I’ve noticed while living with my new family. If you treat everyone with suspicion, you will be treated with suspicion in return.” Tsrancomta looked up, his hollow eyes showing a glimmer of hope as Tsandrasto stood. “Something to think about in the future. Not everyone is out to get you.” She knocked on the door, and it slid open, Eric still standing there.

“We were also trying to impress you,” Tsrancomta blurted out. Tsandrasto paused, and Eric glowered at him over her head. Tsrancomta looked away, his scales turning a slight orange. “We wanted to impress you, and maybe try to bring you along and become part of our family.”

Tsandrasto also turned a slight orange color but didn’t show anything on her face. “Next time you try to impress a girl, try an actual conversation,” Tsandrasto said, her voice a little tight. “You might have more luck.”

“I swear, Jessica is giving you too much of her personality,” Eric said. Tsrancomta didn’t hear Tsandrasto’s response as the door closed, leaving him to his thoughts.

………………………………………..

“So, did you get what you wanted?” Eric asked as they left the brig. Sandra thought for a moment.

“No,” Sandra said. “But I think I got what I needed.”

“That’s good then,” Eric said.

…………………………………………..

“Alright, release it,” Shao called up. He grunted as he received the entire weight of the melted slag of panel, Moratasarco and Sortanca on either side in exo-suits to help stabilize the heavy weight. They quickly walked over to an empty area they had cleared just for this and put the panel down, Shao panting a bit. “How’s it look up there?”

“Looks like we need to redo most of the wiring,” Karmparta said from near the top of the engine block. “They’re almost as melted as the panel was.” Shao groaned in frustration again.

“Kids really did a number on these engines,” he grumbled, pulling out his datapad. A pair of small drones came out and began to cut apart the destroyed panel in order to repurpose it back into raw materials. “And don’t you dare apologize again.” Shao said, pointing at Moratasarco as she opened her mouth. She shut her mouth. “We need to get this fixed, not trying to take blame that isn’t ours, so focus on repairs.”

“Yes, sir,” Moratsarco said.

Shao shook his head a bit when a message popped up on his datapad. “Really? Now? Come on, we still have a few more days of repairs to get finished up.”

“Is something wrong?” Moratsarco asked.

“Jessica wants to plan a bit of a surprise,” Shao said dryly. He turned his datapad slightly so that the obviously-not-curious Targondian engineer could read the message.

“Awe, that’s sweet,” Moratsarco said. “We can keep working on the engines while you go get that taken care of.”

“The hell you on about?” Shao said, looking at Moratsarco like she had sprouted a second head.

“Or we could wait till you get back,” Moratsarco said uncertainly. Karmparta and Sortanca loitered nearby, trying not to look like they were eavesdropping.

“A party for one of us is a party for the entire ship,” Shao said firmly. “You’re all coming along as well. If for no other reason than I need people I can talk to that actually understand engineering.”

“But we-”

“Are guests at worst,” Shao finished. He put a finger into her face. “I don’t like people. I have made that abundantly clear. But if I have to go to a party, so do you. Got it?”

“Ummmm,” Karmparsta started.

“What?” Shao snapped, glaring at the man.

“Can we add some Targondian traditions to this party?” Karmparsta asked. He had gotten used to Shao’s glares at this point, though it took a few days (and many reassurances from Eric and Jessica).

“I’m sure Jessica would be thrilled to have some help and feedback,” Shao said drily. He shook his head as the three Targondians lit up in excitement.

He was never going to understand the appeal most people had for big parties and gatherings.

……………………………………………………..

“Well, now that’s interesting,” Nightclaw said, looking over his datapad.

“What’s that?” Marakkompo asked. The Targondian had never had any formal medical training but had become the Targondian crew’s unofficial doctor because he had liked reading medical journals online. He had taken a leap of faith one morning after training and asked if Nightclaw could train him to be a proper doctor, which Nightclaw had agreed to quickly.

“Jessica wants to throw a party,” Nightclaw said, reading the message in the new group chat. Marakkompo shuddered a bit.

“That woman is terrifying,” he said, thinking about their combat training.

“That she is,” Nightclaw agreed easily, typing a response back, his feathers rustling a bit. “She’s asking for any and all help, and Shao said that the engineers with him have offered to add some Targondian tradition to the party.”

“Oh,” Marakkompo said, brightening up. “Are we going?”

“I don’t think we have much of a choice,” Nightclaw chuckled, setting his datapad down. “She gets rather pushy whenever there’s a party involved.”

……………………………….

“Did you want to join us?” Jeremiah asked Captain Charamparshta. The Targondian captain looked surprised at the invitation.

“Are you sure?” Captain Charamparshta asked.

“I think Jessica would be offended if I didn’t at least extend an invitation,” Jeremiah chuckled. “You don’t have to show up, but it would be nice. Apparently, some of your crew are already volunteering to add Targondian traditions to the party.”

“Well, I wouldn’t want to make her angry,” Captain Charamparshta said with a small smile.

……………………………..

“Nice and easy, you want to think of the ship as an extension of yourself,” Adam said, watching the two Targondian sisters practice flying the Stingers. Apparently, these two had been the ones in charge of flying their ship most of the time, so they had the experience, just needed to expand their horizons a bit.

“Yes, sir,” Kamaserto said, trying to be gentle with the turn her holo-course was taking her on.

“Got it,” Kamamorta said. She was the more aggressive of the two sisters, at least when it comes to flying. Both had good flight skills, but they also needed to think outside of the box a bit more, which is what Adam was hoping to teach them.

Adam looked down at his datapad as another notification dinged. “Looks like tonight is going to be an interesting night,” he said with a laugh. The cake that Quin was starting to decorate was massive, easily looking like something that he would expect to see at a villa party or a wedding.

“Dammit,” Kamamorta muttered as her screen flashed red, indicating that she had ‘died’.

“That’s what being impatient gets you,” Adam said. “Or too much caution, seeing as you ran out of time,” he added to Kamaserto as her screen flashed red as well.

“I don’t want to damage your ship,” Kamaserto protested as Kamamorta snorted.

“Don’t even worry about that,” Adam said waving a hand. “We have enough materials to make a few more if needed. Now, let’s run it one more time, and then we’ll head down to the chow hall.”

“Yes, sir,” both of the sisters said, and the holo-course started up again.  
…………………………………………………………..

“Jessica, I do know how to make and decorate a cake,” Quin said mildly as Jessica hovered nearby.

“I know,” Jessica said, physically trying to keep her hands to herself, “but I want this to be perfect. Eric is keeping Sandra distracted right now with prototype testing and practice, but that will only last for so long.”

“Jessica,” Quin said, giving her a look. “Relax. I can do the cake, Shao and his engineers are already working on the Targondian side of things, and we already know you can’t cook anything except pancakes. So get out of the kitchen, go help Nightclaw and Jeremiah with the decoration, and make sure our alcohol stock has something the Targondians can enjoy.”

“Oh, good idea,” Jessica brightened, and rushed out. Quin just shook her head as she picked up the frosting again.

“Can she really not cook?” Samancarta asked as he pulled a pizza out of the oven. Both the Targondians and the humans were surprised and delighted to find out that pizza was a common food among both races, albeit with slightly different ingredients. (Pizza is universal and eternal. You can fight me if you want, but you know I’m right 😉)

“She can cook pancakes, which she most likely will for breakfast tomorrow,” Quin said. “But the last time we tried to let her cook something else, it was an unidentifiable mess.”

“By the Void, that is a terrifying thought,” Carmasorta said, looking up from the appetizer plate she was putting together. “She’s so confident that we though she could do anything. Also terrifying in training.”

“We all have our strengths and weaknesses,” Quin said. The husband-and-wife pair were sweet and had offered to take over kitchen duties when they had found out that the Reapers all took turns cooking, since they didn’t have a dedicated chef.

“I suppose so,” Carmasorta said thoughtfully. She smacked her husband’s hand away from the platter with her tail and gave him a glare.

…………………………………………

“Okay, what are you up to?” Sandra asked Eric in the gym.

“What do you mean?” Eric said. Sandra glared at him as he fought a smile.

“You have that face, Dad,” Sandra accused, folding her arms.

“Which face?”

“That face,” Sandra said, pointing at Eric. “That face that says you’re waiting for someone to fall into your prank.”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Eric maintained, looking away, the smile slowly winning the fight on his face. He checked his datapad for the tenth time in as many minutes.

“Also, you keep checking for messages on your datapad,” Sandra pointed out, “which means either you have a camera on the prank, or other members of the crew are in on it.”

“Now you’re just talking crazy,” Eric said, the smile wining as he gave Sandra a big smile, saying that she was absolutely correct. “Come on, lets go get some dinner. I heard that Quin was whipping up something good with those Targondian cooks.”

“You’re a dick sometimes,” Sandra complained as they left the gym.

“Right now, I’m just being a jerk, not a dick,” Eric laughed. “There is a difference.”

“Fine, a jerk, whatever,” Sandra grumbled. Nightshade and Shadowstrike both yawned as Sandra went into her room to drop off a few things, and the Tree Shadows followed them to the dining room. Sandra got even more suspicious when Eric stepped behind her, waiting for her to open the door to the dining room.

“SURPRISE!” came the shout from many different voices. Sandra panicked briefly from the sudden amount of noise, leaping above the doorframe and hanging off the wall outside of the dining hall, Shadowstrike and Nightshade startled to either side of the doorframe. Eric was just laughing as Sandra poked her head from the top of the doorframe.

The dining room was decorated with ribbons of yellow and purple, a massive cake in the center of the room on a table, and a big banner saying HAPPY BIRTHDAY, TSANDRASTO EVERFLOW. There was already some sort of drum-based music coming from the speakers, all of the Targondians dressed in robes in varying shades of yellow and purple, Jessica and Adam both laughing as Sandra slowly dropped to the floor. The tables had all been moved to the walls, and each table seemed to have some sort of theme when it came to food, with one having seafood, another with snacks, and the third having a variety of different dishes that Sandra had never seen before, and Athena was at a table in the corner, apparently in charge of making sure there was good music.

“Happy birthday, kiddo,” Eric said warmly, following Sandra and the Tree Shadows into the dining room as she looked around in awe.

“But, I don’t know my birthday,” Sandra said slowly.

“I looked it up,” Jessica said, still chuckling as she gave Sandra a big hug and picked her up. “Shtaran and Athena were a huge help, they were able to find your files and birthday. When I found out it was today, I began putting this together.” Jessica gave Sandra a huge smile. “Both Targondians and Humans make a big deal of birthdays, so tonight is all about you.”

Captain Charamparshta walked up, a gentle smile on his face as he handed Sandra a cup, filled with some bright yellow drink. “Targondian tradition mandates that you start us off whenever you want. And since it’s your 16^(th) year, we make a special drink. Normally this is the year you begin training in earnest for what you want to do, but my understanding is you got a bit of an early start. So tonight, instead of the usual choices and speeches, we only ask that you enjoy yourself, and give us the start you so rightly deserve.”

Sandra looked at the Targondian captain, and the various other Targondians looking at her, Nightclaw with his feathers carefully strewn with yellow and purple ribbons, Jessica beaming at her, Adam holding up a glass of his own drink, and at Eric, who just looked happy. Happy for her. She looked down at the mug in her hand, and took a drink, not stopping until she had drained it all. It had a slightly banana and lemon flavor to it, but the sourness that came across her tongue made her flick her tongue out several times in delight as a warm and fuzzy feeling spread across her body.

“Then let’s start the party,” Sandra laughed, and there was a big cheer from the crowd.

……………………………………….

Tsrancomta looked up briefly as the door to his cell opened again. The human captain, Jeremiah, peered in for a moment before nodding and stepping to the side. Tsrancomta shrunk in on himself a bit when his father, Tsransarmo, stepped in, holding a plate of food. A plate of food that Tsrancomta recognized.

“I guess there’s a party going on,” he said glumly. On the plate were Targondian traditional foods, several types of fish, a slice of pizza, several somethings that looked similar to the prawn fish from the homeworld, and even a slice of what looked like cake, as well as the traditional slerkav drink for an important birthday.

“Tsandrasto turned 16 today,” Tsransarmo said quietly. “The humans wanted to throw a celebration for her today, and several of our crew members offered to add in Targondian traditions as well.” He placed the plate on the table next to Tsrancomta’s bed. “You’r still a member of our crew, and my son. Detained or not, you deserve at least some of the celebration.”

“Why?” Tsrancomta said miserably. “I put us in jeopardy.”

“I saw the recordings,” Tsransarmo said. “Am I proud of what you did? No. But I saw you try to talk Cha’am out of his foolhardy idea. Even if you followed him, you tried to be the voice of reason many times.”

“I just wanted to help our people,” Tsrancomta said, his tail wrapped around one of his ankles.

“I know,” Tsransorma said. “You just followed someone down the wrong path. Next time, instead of following them, you can make your own choices.” He placed a datapad next to the plate of food while standing up. “If nothing else, you can eat, and you can watch. And maybe, just maybe, you can learn.” He tapped on the cell door, which slid open. “You’re still my son, Tsrancomta. I’ll wait to give you a leg up when your punishment is done, even if I will not defend your actions.”

Tsrancomta looked at the datapad and the plate of food for several minutes after his father left. Slowly, he started eating the food and opened the datapad. The screen showed a camera view of Sandra laughing with the Humans, learning Targondian traditional dance, and opening presents, clearly enjoying herself while the Tree Shadows ran around the room, trying to steal or beg food from everybody they could. Tsrancomta gave a small sad smile. Targondians can’t cry like the rest of the galaxy with their underdeveloped tear ducts, but at that moment he truly felt like shedding tears. “I am so sorry,” he whispered, as though his voice could carry through the camera to her. “I’ll be better, I swear.”

He wanted to cry again, but this time in joy, when he took a bite of the cake. There is no way that any cake should be that good.

……………………………………………….

The party lasted hours. Many of the dishes she did not recognize were apparently Targondia traditional dishes for a birthday, and they were all delicious. Apparently, they were intentionally made to be a light meal so that people could eat more, since Targondians have a slow metabolism and small stomach. Sandra was especially happy to learn that she could finally have the (very diluted) ‘Adult Drinks’ that Eric had denied her in the past. Apparently, the Targondian drink that she had been given, slerkav, was mildly alcoholic. And while this wasn’t the same exact drink (it took months of prep work to have it properly), the humans apparently had enough spices and alcohol to create a very good substitute. And while the rest of the galaxy demanded that drinking be kept to adults, Targondians say otherwise, as long as there is proper supervision. Sandra was buzzing pleasantly by the end of the night, and then Eric gave her one more surprise.

He had turned the rec room into a massive, open-floored theatre. There were blankets and pillows everywhere, one of the walls already showing a playlist of movies that she could choose from, and on one side were several drink dispensers, which gave hot chocolate instead of the usual coffee. In keeping with both Human and Targondian traditions, the hot chocolate was also slightly alcoholic, though a bit more diluted in order to help people wind down.

Many of the Targondians made nests in groups to enjoy the movie and sip on hot chocolate. Sandra cuddled with Eric, Adam, Quinn, Jessica, and Nightshade and Shadowstrike, laughing as the movie of a child booby trapping his house in the most ridiculous ways against robbers played. Her eyes felt heavy, but she didn’t care, slowly drifting off to sleep as one of the intruders was electrocuted while trying to open a door.

The last time she had been this happy was when Eric had shown her the documents that made her adoption official. And much like then, Sandra was happy to sleep in his lap again. The safest place in the galaxy.

​I’ve recently fallen in love with Vietnamese coffee, but I want to move past just following random YouTube recipes. I’m looking to learn the soul of the process from someone who actually do it everyday or knows the traditional ways.

​I’m specifically interested in:

​The Phin Filter: How to get the grind size and ""bloom"" just right so it doesn't drip too fast or get stuck.

​Bean Selection: What should I look for in Robusta beans? Are there specific brands (like Trung Nguyen) or local roasters you swear by?

​The Variations: Beyond Cà Phê Sữa Đá, I’d love to learn the secrets to a perfect Egg Coffee (Cà Phê Trứng) or Salt Coffee (Cà Phê Muối).

​If anyone is down to chat, share some ""pro tips,"" or even hop on a quick video call to show me your technique, I’d be incredibly grateful. I’m a fast learner and a huge fan of the culture!

1ray9es,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ray9es,What water temperature do I use?,"I’ve tried a plethora of recipes for light roasts using a V60; the most recent recipes come from a Nordic specialty coffee advent calendar. With 12 different roasters, the temperatures vary between 93°C to 100°C for the specific recipes. 

For example:

Picture #1 is a Frukt recipe and #2 is from Prolog. Both call for a bloom followed by a single pour. The two differences are the grind size and the water temperature, yet even the grind size for the Prolog is also medium-coarse. I noted that I enjoyed the taste of both with the baby heart at the top right.

Important note: these coffee roasters use the same exact recipe for their different beans. This could be how they do it for all their beans, it could be due laziness for the preparation for this advent calendar, or it may just be how it is for these two specific beans they chose.

When you get some new beans, do you have to use trial and error going up/down from 95°C (example) to find the perfect recipe or do you have a go to recipe water temperature +/- a degree or two that you use every time that yields a tasty cup? ",1,1771697789.0,pourover,0,1.0,False

We’ve hung out in group settings a few times and started texting one-on-one after that. The conversations are good, not dry, and she asks me questions back. She’ll send random memes during the day or tell me about something that happened at work.

The confusing part is the pacing. Sometimes she replies quickly and keeps it going for hours. Other times she’ll take half a day and then respond like nothing happened. I was playing on my phone the other night overthinking whether I should double text or just leave it alone. I ended up doing nothing and she eventually replied, but the inconsistency throws me off. When we’re in person, she’s warm. She stands close, makes eye contact, laughs at my dumb jokes. But she hasn’t directly suggested hanging out one-on-one, and when I hinted at grabbing coffee, she said yeah that would be fun sometime, but no concrete plan.

I am really hoping to connect with people living in Amsterdam or at least somewhere nearby in the Netherlands. So you can ignore this post if you live far away. Sorry about this.  
  
I am in the middle of a career change and building my new company. Since I am not going to an office anymore, I’ve realized how much I miss casual human connection. Quick chats, grabbing a coffee, talking about life, joking around, or just having a good conversation that clears your head.  
  
So, I am looking for few friends or conversation buddies. Something relaxed and genuine.  
  
A bit about me:  
\- I am 38M, born Indian, but living in Amsterdam from last 4 years and 15+ years around few countries in Europe, so my mindset is kind of a mix now, shaped by all the places I’ve called home.  
\- I am Learning Dutch, still a work in progress, but I’m trying. I can proudly order a beer in Dutch.   
  
What I am looking for:  
\- Mostly friendly chats (online first is fine). Although I'm not good with texting, fair warning.  
\- Some healthy conversation, sometimes deep, sometimes just light and relaxing.  
\- IRL meet for coffee or a walk if we get along.  
  
Note: I’m not looking for dating or anything romantic. Just friends for conversation.  
  
If this sounds like your vibe, send me a DM with a little about you (where you’re based, what you like talking about, and what kind of connection you’re looking for).",1,1771697662.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

Y/N enters the company office. Company execs (CE from now on): “Ah, there you are! Congrats on winning first look at and walk through of the creative concept of Enhypen's ‘Brought the heat back’ music video! Would you like some coffee? You can sit over here.”

Y/N: “Thanks! No coffee right now though. I’m really looking forward to this!” Y/N sits down at the table facing the large screen with the CEs at the side. A CE switches the lights off. Video starts rolling.

CE: “So we start out with… clothed Jake in what looks like a shower with some mesh shirt on the wall…” **\[Image 1 left\]**

Y/N: \*Looking shocked and tired at the same time.\* “Oh gosh! We’re going straight for the ‘Fever’ PTSD, I see.”

CE: “What do you mean – PTSD? Do you mean you liked it?”

Y/N: “Err… once I finally saw THAT segment, it was the most inappropriate shit I’d seen since I was old enough to understand Nicki Minaj in the Biebs ‘Beauty and the Beat’. The most cursed concept in Kpop – and it isn’t even a competition! Tells me everything about all parents plus choreographer involved too. Anyway, if that’s the rough direction that we’re going – Imma gonna need that coffee after all, please. To have something to hold on to.”

CE: \*Staring\*

Y/N: \*Stares back\*

CE: \*Passes the coffee thermos\*

Y/N: \*Pours themselves coffee\*

CE: “So, then we find out that it was a fake out. Jake is not in a bathroom, but the entire apartment is tiled. We introduce Sunghoon in a Tshirt that reads ‘dangerous when wet’ **\[Image 1 right\]** and then the related p\*ssy… cat which lives in a casket, cause we’re going for an Eros and Thanatos concept. You know -vampires. All the bats, the vampires, the boys flock like flies to the casket when the p\*ssy… cat is inside. **\[Image 2\]** The p\*ssy… cat in the casket is mechanical and its tail is flipping around to show its aroused agitated state.”

Y/N: \*Giggling nervously\* “Err… I know this is Korea, but with all your dangerous wet p\*ssy and death – would you happen to have something stronger than coffee? You know as hardworking creatives. Did you really come up on this with only coffee? I feel like I’ll need something stronger to get through this. Look, in my country when we come up with shit like this, our boss orders the coke for all of us in bulk. And it will be in my system, so I literally have to trust you cause you could immediately report me.”

So, Jay is singing ‘I brought the wild heat and madness back. It’s getting stronger. It ain’t my fault. It’s because of you.’ Sunoo dances with the p\*ssy… cat. **\[Image 3 left\]** And then a man steals the p\*ssy… cat, leaving the now p\*ssyless boys distraught. **\[Image 3 right\]**

Y/N: \*Winces\* “Like in ‘Fever’.”

CE: \*Raises eyebrows.\* “Anyway, moving on: then we see that the p\*ssy...cat has left its hot mark all over the boys’ arms. **\[Image 6\]** The boys need more p\*ssy...cat, need the p\*ssy… cat back, so Jake and Ni-ki drive around at night in a car which says ‘Real men love p\*ssy.. err… cats’.” **\[Image 7\]**

CE: “The nightly drive obviously blows Ni-Ki’s mind…” **\[Image 8 left\]**

Y/N: “OBVIOUSLY.”

CE: “Ni-Ki had just turned 18. He didn’t have a driver’s license.”

Y/N: \*sarcastic\* “But you didn’t have to pull that shit that you pulled in ‘Fever’. Gotcha.”

CE and Y/N lock eyes in tense silence.

CE: “Moving on, Sunoo gets the p\*ssy… cat back and immediately goes to bed sessions with the p\*ssy… cat. **\[Image 8 right\]** Because Heeseung also wants the p\*ssy… cat which we establish is female **\[Image 9 left; the Missing P\*ssy... Cat poster\]**, you know for the …”

Y/N: “… for the dummies who are still not getting it…”

CE: “He hits Sunoo with the car in order for Sunoo to let go of the p\*ssy...cat that he’s hogging. Then we cut to Jake, who like Heeseung has only p\*ssy… cat on his mind. The word being sung is ‘Overwhelmed’.” **\[Image 9 right\]** Jake now has the p\*ssy...cat. **\[Image 10 left\]** But all the other boys also want p\*ssy...cat. So the boys fight over who will get the p\*ssy...cat first. Heeseung and then NiKi win. But in the next scene the casket is empty and Jungwon, Ni-ki and Sunoo are… lounging around… in a ‘Lover’s Dream’ in the casket instead.” **\[Image 11\]**

Y/N: \*Slightly exasperated\* “..as one does.”

CE: “There are nails and screws to drive the point home. Heeseung discovers what they were doing and that there was no p\*ssy...cat in the casket. Because it was all Ni-ki’s fault…” **\[Image 12 left\]**

Y/N: “Of course…”

CE: “… Heeseung decides to punish Ni-ki for the Lover’s Dream with Sunoo and Jungwon by locking him into a closet.” **\[Image 12 right\]**

Y/N: \*Bemused, sarcastically\* “I love the subtlety of him in the closet.”

CE: “Then, Heeseung and Jay ... nail... Ni-ki in the closet. **\[Image 13 left\]** Next, Jungwon slaps Jay’s face with a fish. Cause you know… ” **\[Image 13 right\]**

Y/N: \*eyeing the windows for an escape route\* “Yes, thanks. Got it – fishy p\*ssy.”

CE: “Ni-Ki escapes from his nailed casket and the p\*ssy… cat is now there for everyone to share. The p\*ssy… cat arches its back and the boys all turn into fiery ghouls.” **\[Image 14 left\]**

Y/N: \*Chuckling\* “Again – impressed by the subtlety…”

CE: “The viewer then engages in voyeurism, watching all the boys through a peephole in the huge mirror floor to ceiling p\*ssy play pen. **\[Image 14 right\]** They sing that they ‘can’t hold back.’ **\[Images 15 and 16\]** They all get visible fight injuries from … fighting with the p\*ssy… cat… and Jay for example gets p\*ssy… cat scratches over his mouth. **\[Image 18\]** All the boys now get to hump the p\*ssy and fur, climaxing.” **\[Images 16, 17 and 18\]**

Y/N: \*Reads screen, slightly wide-eyed\*: “Are you sure they’re not having a stroke with those lines instead…”

CE: “We then cut to a cemetery with playground with many rocking horses and other rocking animals because…” **\[Image 19, Image 20 left\]**

Y/N: “For the dummies, who didn’t get the Eros and Thanatos concept so far…”

CE: “Yeah, we had initially planned to use the representative animals of the band members to make our point clearer – like a baby duckling representing riding Ni-Ki, a puppy representing riding Jake… We told the boys that the p\*ssy... cat that are all chasing represents their fans. In this sense they would of course all end up in bed with their fans.” \[/uj: for source on this, see end of text. /rj:\]

Y/N: “What the WHAT now?! I don’t think even the horniest person, man or woman, wants their genit\*ls detached. Like their fans are… p\*ssy?! What? Your concept is [Wanda Sykes’ ‘Detachable vajayjay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8FfFwtL91Q)?!”

CE: \*Confused\* “We have never heard of Wanda Sykes. But getting back to the music video: The boys do a sexy dance including the ‘hit it’ move in the cemetery. They then run up the mons…”

\---------------------------

/uj: In the “Making Of” video it is shown that either the idols were lied to on what that mons ... pubis final scene is about – or knew but were told go to give a different version (it would however not be the first time that a company provided a band with an incorrect concept – there’s that infamous “Milk” video e.g.). They were told that it’s “them chasing each other for centuries”. That makes absolutely no sense as the scenery does not change and there is nothing in the background that changes to indicate a change of centuries. Their clothes don't change either. The only thing that changes is night/day, but with the exact same set of a tiny tiny mole that they run up and down. Enhypen were told by the director that they ought to look “more tired and worn out”. Yikes. The bandmembers understood that something was off (or were in on the joke), as they discussed how weird the cat watching them run up and down that tiny mound is looking – and that it is turning into a woman while purring.

Jake said that for the ""only p\*ssy on my mind"" scene \[Image 10 left\], they told him that he was wearing cat eye contact lenses as he was turning into the p\*ssy… cat. That makes no sense given the other scenes. (And the other members aren't starting to chase him either.) In the scene immediately following that one he is also the one who has the p\*ssy... cat and is trying to fight out the other band members who are trying to steal it from him.

In the ""Making Of"" video, Jay mentioned that the rocking toys in the cemetery were supposed to represent the band members' animal avatars, mentioning Ni-Ki as duckling explicitly. (But that must have been scrapped cause the specific animals are not in the video anymore. Apart from the dog rocking toy in Image 19 on the right which could be Jake. His animal avatar is a puppy.)

In the interview for the m/v release, Enhypen said that the p\*ssy… cat is Engene (barf) and Jake says that he actually prefers dogs. (Lolz at the triple entendre – Jake actually 1) prefers dogs to cats and has a dog, 2) doing it doggy style and 3) gay, if straight is “preferring p\*ssy...cat”.) Sunoo’s shirt in the video which says “My Cat is a Rockstar and I’m the Manager, we have Concerts twice a Year” is quite funny and ironic in that context though.

The man stealing the p\*ssy... cat represents another idol and ties in with the entire ""don't stan other groups""/""I am a jealous man"" \[quote\] concept of the ""Romance: Untold"" album.",1,1771697123.0,Kpopexamination,1,1.0,False

Hi, I’m a 29-year-old guy based in Abu Dhabi looking to meet and connect with a like-minded woman. Living here can feel a bit lonely sometimes, and I think it would be nice to build a genuine connection with someone who enjoys good conversation and simple, meaningful moments.

I’m someone who enjoys staying active but also appreciates relaxed days. I like going for long walks when the weather is good, trying out new restaurants and coffee spots, playing sports like padel, and watching movies at the cinema. I value balance in life, so I enjoy both staying outdoors and having quiet, comfortable time as well.

Personality-wise, I’m easygoing, respectful, and honest. I believe good connections are built on communication, mutual respect, and being able to laugh together. I’m not in a rush and prefer getting to know someone naturally and seeing where things lead.

I’m a straight guy. Always have been. My SP is a woman. I’ve been doing SP meditation for about six weeks. Typical routine: SATS before bed, affirmations during the day, visualizing us already together, focusing on the end state. The twist is that I didn’t script her name specifically in the early phase. I just looped “I am loved,” “He chooses me,” “He prioritizes me,” etc. I picked male pronouns because I was reading a post that said using gender-neutral or opposite pronouns can detach you from obsession with a specific outcome and focus on the feeling.

At the time it felt neutral. I wasn’t trying to manifest a man. It was more like I was trying to manifest being chosen. I wanted the energy of being pursued.

Fast forward two weeks in and the vibe shift was noticeable. I felt calmer, less needy. Eye contact stronger. Posture different. I wasn’t scanning rooms for validation anymore. I felt like I already had someone. There was this low-key inner certainty like, “I’m taken,” even though I wasn’t.

That’s when things started happening.

First instance: guy at my gym who I’ve seen for months suddenly starts spotting me without me asking. Then complimenting my form. Then lingering. I brushed it off as friendly.

Second: barista at a coffee shop starts remembering my name and asking what I’m doing that weekend. It escalates into light teasing. Definitely flirty. Not ambiguous.

Third: coworker I’ve barely spoken to suddenly messaging me outside work hours. Sending memes. Suggesting grabbing drinks. Very direct energy.

This has never been my pattern. I’ve had women flirt with me occasionally but men? Not like this. Not clustered like this. It feels patterned.

What’s also different is how I’m being perceived physically. I haven’t changed my appearance. Same haircut, same clothes, same body composition. But I’m getting longer looks from men. Almost evaluative. Like they’re clocking something.

Internally, I do feel different. More receptive. Less rigid. My affirmations were very “I am desired,” “He can’t resist me,” “He wants me more than anyone.” I think I embodied the state of being pursued so fully that I shifted into a kind of magnetic polarity that reads as available energy.

I’m not confused about my orientation. I’m still attracted to women. But the attention is undeniably coming from men right now.

It makes me question how much of manifestation is about specific targets versus broadcast frequency. If I tuned myself to “being desired by a he,” maybe the universe just matched the literal instruction.

What’s interesting is that my original SP (female) has also re-entered lightly. More story views. A random text. But the dominant external feedback loop is male attention.

Emotionally I’m not freaked out. More curious. It’s like I accidentally stress-tested how flexible attraction dynamics are. I don’t feel like my identity changed. I feel like my field did.

I will say this: the level of pursuit energy feels intense. Men are more forward. Less subtle. If this is what women deal with constantly, it’s clarifying. There’s a directness to it that feels heavy sometimes.

I’m not switching teams. I’m not rewriting my story. I just think I dialed into “He chooses me” and the world responded very literally.",1,1771696975.0,Manifestation,0,0.67,False

I can barely start my day without spacing out, needing breaks, dreading starting basic tasks even just brushing my teeth, feeding my kid and dog, doing the dishes. Feeding myself. I do take care of my son and my pets of course.

Everyone around me treats me different. Because I act different. I am so insecure all the time. So sensitive to criticism and easily spiral into depression. I feel like such a fuck up. I overshare, my emotions change with the wind. I tap and fidget ALL THE TIME to the point it’s embarrassing. I never finished college, my brain isn’t built for academia and I think if I had more than an entry level job the stress alone would kill me.

It’s ridiculous that I can write a novel, I can read several books a month, I can hyper focus on some niche topic for an entire day but I can’t remember to brush my teeth or realize when three hours have passed and I’m still in my pajamas.

I am horrible at socializing. I go through being social and happy and talkative to shutting down completely and wanting to block out the world. It makes me a bad friend and I end up alone. My husband at least is my friend but it does strain our relationship at times when I can’t focus.

Sometimes it’s better if I read a book I like or get a cup of coffee and take a breather but it’s small breaks from just the constant onslaught. I’ll say hormonal changes monthly does make it so much worse.

The problem I'm trying to solve:

Small businesses and marketing agencies spend hours every week creating Instagram content. They know they need to post consistently but either don't have the time, the design skills, or the budget to hire a social media manager. Most end up posting inconsistently or not at all.

What I'm building:
-----------------------------
An AI-powered tool  that automatically generates Instagram posts (image + caption) based on real-world triggers:

Weather triggers — It's raining? The tool generates a cozy ""monsoon special"" post for your cafe/business.

Heatwave? It pushes an iced drinks promo.

Trending topics — India vs Pakistan is trending? The tool detects it, checks if it's relevant to your business, and generates a post that ties the trend to what you sell.

Holidays & festivals — Diwali, Independence Day, Eid, Christmas — auto-generates festive posts with your branding.

Time-based — Monday morning coffee posts, weekend specials, payday promotions.

The key differentiator — image generation that actually looks like YOUR business:

This is the part I'm most excited about. When you sign up, you upload 5-10 photos of your business (interior, food, products, whatever). The AI studies your visual identity — your color palette, your furniture, your plating style, your lighting, everything.

Then when it generates marketing images, they look like they were taken at YOUR place, not some generic stock photo. I tested this with a French bakery and the AI-generated images matched their forest green walls, their specific pastries, their branded cups, even their neon sign. People couldn't tell it was AI-generated.

How it works:
----------------------
Business uploads photos during onboarding
Triggers fire automatically (weather changes, trend detected, holiday approaching)

AI generates a post (image + caption) tailored to the business

Business owner gets an email notification with a preview

Owner approves, edits, or rejects with one click
Approved posts go straight to Instagram

You choose how much control you want:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Manual mode (default) — Every post goes to your approval queue. Nothing gets posted without your explicit approval. You review, edit if needed, and hit approve
.
Auto-post mode (optional) — Trust the AI fully. Posts go live automatically when triggers fire. You can still review and delete after the fact. Best for agencies managing many accounts who don't want to approve every single post.


Initially I was thinking individual businesses, but I'm now leaning toward marketing agencies who manage 10-20+ Instagram accounts. One agency sale = 20 businesses on the platform, and they'd pay more because it saves them real employee hours.

What I want to know:
=================
If you run a business or manage social media accounts — would you actually use something like this?

What would make you NOT use it? What's the dealbreaker?

How much would you pay for this? I'm thinking ₹2,999/mo for 5 accounts, ₹7,999/mo for 20 accounts.

What features am I missing that would make this a must-have?

Is the trigger-based approach (AI decides when to post based on real-world events) actually useful, or would you prefer to just schedule posts manually?
I'm not trying to sell anything here — the product isn't launched yet. Just genuinely want to know if this solves a real problem or if I'm building something nobody needs.

fair warning: this is rough. v0.1.0, solo project, definitely has bugs. Posting here because I've been lurking this sub forever and figured you guys would tell me honestly if this is even worth continuing.

The thing that pushed me to build it was RAM. I'm running local models and I don't want my frontend eating half of it. So I built something with Tauri + Svelte instead of Electron. Whole installer is 6.6 MB which still kind of surprises me every time I check.

It does the basics: connect to LM Studio or Ollama, drop in an OpenRouter key if you want, import V3 character cards with alternate greetings and all that. Everything stays local in SQLite, nothing goes anywhere. Also built in German support from the start because I'm German and got tired of switching languages halfway through a session.

What it doesn't do yet is a longer list honestly. No mobile, UI is pretty bare in places, probably crashes in ways I haven't found yet.

If anyone actually tries it I'd love to know what breaks first.

I’m sleeping 3-6 hours, waking up and either feeling: 

1. utter gnawing despair that takes the breath out of my lungs while at the same time feeling like I’ve had 10 cups of coffee in my sleep, completely terrified either feeling like there’s something scary in the room or questioning all my life choices and spiraling feeling totally worthless and looking at all the things in my life and all the things about living and just not understanding how I could have possibly ever valued those things or cared at all. 

2.

 Happy and fine, want to do things, I can leave my apartment with no issues, feel cool and attractive, i think other people think those things about me bc how could they not, I spend money, I cannot stop spending money. There’s just no sense that money is finite(it is, very much for me) 

I’m switching between these every few hours or days. I will be doing something happily and then I’m in tears impossibly fast. Then eventually the nauseating adrenaline surge softens to euphoria again.I feel constantly itchy, goosebumps, quick to laugh or anger, seemingly also tearing up every time I laugh. I’ve only socialized with close family the past few weeks but they commented I seemed really intense and confrontational. At that point I was managing and aware of it but unable to hide what my body was doing physiologically. 

I have this moment of clarity and I still feel awful. I don’t want to be hospitalized, I’m in school finally after hospital surfing through my teens and half my 20s. My psych np basically lets me prescribe myself meds and has no clue how to treat this. I’ve been managing w lithium and insomnia dose seroquel. I don’t know what to do.

The other day I saw someone mocking people for picking up popsicle sticks amongst the junk on Vine... and I was like ""SIR. Popsicle sticks = drinking a whole coffee in peace when you have a kid, that's GOLD in them there hills.""

Personally I've rarely been more elated than when I got a $4 jar of Classico pasta sauce, or $20 vacuum bag refills for my actual brand of vacuum. (Are you kidding me? Vine's not only getting me stuff I might not have bought for myself, but actively saved me $5-20 of REAL MONEY!?)

# So, this is an appreciation post for The Junk.™

Had a win today that solves a REAL pain point in my current existence and I had to share. I bet 1000 people rolled their eyes at the ""absolute garbage on vine"" with this one, but I just... squeed with joy.

One of my biggest pet peeves in existence is living in a house with light carpet stairs, having my (no zippers) clonky winter boots laced up, running late on a rushed morning, FINALLY on the way out the door–– only to have my 4 year old say ""WAIT but I need my"": insert **ridiculous** item here. Valentine's day headband with two giant fluffy hearts on the head. Mcdonalds happy meal crap toy, or... a freaking piece of crumpled paper she scrawled two lines on.

And I'm standing there like... ok. I can either risk a kindergarten meltdown by refusing, which could delay us 5x as long... tell them to take their own boots off and get it themselves, which would take 10x as long.... or I have to UNLACE MY STUPID WINTER BOOTS, drag them off my feet, get up the white stairs, back down, and get the damned things back on.

It sounds lazy as hell, but my god. I'm never getting non-zipper winter boots again, it's just such a surprisingly annoying time drain, especially if the ""Oh wait, my sunglasses are up there too––"" thing happens *right after* you've gotten them back on. Lace-up boots with a tight fit are a fool's game and I live in regret.

SO. Enter my big vine win today:

Are they good for the environment? No, nothing disposable is. But will they save my SANITY (AND CARPETS)? ***YES.*** ***YES THEY WILL.*** I cannot wait until the next time the boots are on and I stand there thinking ""How much dirt/salt/muddy water will REALLY track onto these stairs if I just go..."" and I remember I can just slip on a set of these and run.

I'll reuse a single pair as many times as humanly possible, and continue to thank the Vine Gods for sending me the occasional life win.

He then offered if I wanted to call things here and we see if we pick things up after sometime apart. to which I said no. we didn’t speak for a week after. 

He then broke up with me, and said that everything that happened before was an excuse because he was too coward to say. 

he said we both need to grow separately, we’re both not in the right place for a healthy relationship, things haven’t been right for months, there isn’t any excitement, he can’t be in a relationship, we’ve missed out on things where we’ve been together since we was young, he doesn’t feel man enough, and we both have things we need to work on. And has said if we’re meant to be together we will find our way back, his said we need to make sure it doesn’t get toxic because if one day it’s important we get back together, he doesn’t want a subconscious contract that we are getting back together, asked me what id want if we got back together, said he still loves me, given examples of couples that have found there way back to each other, and told me that if “it’s right it’s right, whenever that may be, and we both feel like we should give it another go when we’ve both grown and done the work and feel it’s best to give it another go, because if we do it have to be 100%”, and it has to happen naturally. He also told me that we shouldn’t kiss because of the sparks and that he could sleep with me through all of this! But he also said things such as, I still want you in my life as a friend, I’ll always want you in my life, we can still meet for coffee, you’ll always have a special place in my heart. 

but since the break up, that happened 2 and a half months ago…. I haven’t heard anything from him, I’ve been ghosted, he hasn’t reached out to any of my family.

Audio recording by \[name blacked out\] Continental Investigation Agent Coordinator of the Magnus Institute, currently in Stanger, Norway.

  
Ahem



(Statement)

First off, a young fellow I work with insisted I come here. While what I experienced is definitely in the purview of your institute, I don't believe what I experienced is of concern in that sense. Nothing… happened, it's of no harm to anyone, just, I changed, or well, the things i used to see, are now seen differently.



I used to be a fisherman, I used to spend all my time at sea, see, where I am from, Paamiut, that's nothing out of the ordinary, it was inevitable that I would end up working at sea, everyone eventually did at some point. But I still had my own motivations. When I was just a kid, I followed my father out, joining him on a seal hunt. I remember a couple of things from that day—the blisters I came home with, the brightness of the sun which refused to set—but there is only one thing that truly stuck with me. We ended up in some fjord I had not been in before, as we rounded the bend of a mountain, and through the mouth of the fjord, I saw it—a shape that stuck out among the icebergs. My first whale.

To my young eyes, it was otherworldly. Even at a distance, I could make out the black of its eye. Not just that it was so big that I could see its pupil from where I stood, but that looking into it, I could feel it—something soulful. An eye that had gazed into the depths for lifetimes. In the darkness of its eye, I thought I was looking into the sea itself.

The moment never left me, my primary motivation going to sea when I came of age was seeking whales. I was obsessed with that gaze.



It wasn't long before I was the captain of my own ship, I would take us out fishing in areas known for whales just for a chance to see them, this was however not very profitable, there were times when I knew we weren’t in the best waters for catching fish, but I didn’t care. My crew was naturally frustrated, and eventually confronted me, of course, it was Krogh that finally talked sense into me. They depend on the income, and I had to give in. But the timing could not have been worse, the following week was entirely bad weather and storms. So we waited, and waited for the weather to clear. And when it did, we left that early morning, too soon, i think now, but we couldn't know for certain at that time that the storm would be waiting for us out at sea. 



It was the night of our second day out, as we were sailing back in, we had managed to fill our haul, we had worked tirelessly and at pace because we knew we were risking it and might be at a race with the weather, usually no one is on duty to watch the boat alone, but we had decided to cut corners out of necessity, I came up to take over from young Marius. I believe he is the captain of the ship nowadays, but I haven't kept in touch.



The waters got increasingly choppy and rough, and although it felt like the ship was enveloped in an unnatural chill, I kept an eye on all the measures, barometrics, humidity, temperature, the ships instruments were not giving any indication that the storm was coming, I didn't feel justified in raising any alarm over the waters being rough, instead I found myself engaged in my habit of using the searchlight, and pan around the dark water, it's not without fruit—some whales are more active at the surface at night than at day. 



Less than an hour into my shift. I saw Krogh emerge in the kitchen down the steps from the command bridge, probably grabbing a bit of coffee. He wasn’t on sailing duty, being in charge of the engine, and I assumed he had just been checking on it.



We exchanged some words and he came up the steps, he observed my goings on, I just told him its habit, and he said “You and your damned whales.” I had smiled and was about to reply when he said, with his eyes glued to the far point I had just been looking out at “A gaze that deep does not stop at you. It keeps going. Down,” the phrase was meaningless at the time, but it was strange enough that I remember it, and how his hand pointed downwards, but not just straight down, but at such an angle that you would almost swear he was pointing at something specific.



I don't recall the rest of the conversation, I just remember him leaving and me returning to my spotlight pattern, the ship rocking over the choppy waves, and for a moment the barometer spiked nearly its whole length and then came back down, it was enough to catch my eye but I assumed it a technical issue after it came to rest again where it had been, my eyes darted back outside, and the sky outside was black, not like, entirely blotted out, but… darkened, I shone my light around, and at first I could not see what had changed, there was still the few icebergs scattered about a little ways away, and the angry waves, although they were beginning to calm, and appeared to be rolling from a very singular direction, my light followed the waves, terminating where they appeared to flow from, they seemingly terminated at nothing, a very large nothing, a… slick, nothing.

The only thing telling that there really was *something* was that I could not see the water in that area, the change to pure darkness, other than the small faint sliver, transparently given off, a reflection of the light I was shining out,

It did not make sense, it still doesn’t, the words I have to say, they do not give the right picture, whatever you imagine, that's not what I saw. It was an eye, I could tell it was because, just like staring into the whale’s dark pupils, as I was obsessed with, and this eye was staring back, that I could tell.

I can't describe the creature it belonged to, it was not there, or too big to be seen, or something like that, the words are not quite there.



The ship was not moving.



The light from my spotlight had gone weak, but it was enough to show me that the waves outside had gone completely still, but it even more still than that, the ship itself was silent, like it was holding its breath, the engine had stopped and the ship was on reserve power, it felt like the dark was trying to swallow up the ship, only my steps filled the silence as I left the command room.



I called out for Krogh. No answer. I called out for Marius, for anyone. Silence. As I descended the railing to crew quarters I passed through a long corridor lit by weak beige light, I knew the corridor did not belong there, the crew quarters were not this far away, but at the end of this halfway it presented itself anyways, the bulbs flickered weakly, no sign of life in the room but the cup I had seen Krogh holding earlier, it still held steaming coffee but it smelled burnt and acrid.



I left the galley to make my way to the engine room, thinking the crew must have gone there to check on it, it felt like such solid reasoning to me at the time, the engine had stopped, Krogh fetched the crew to help him with something, I hoped, I prayed that Krogh had control of the situation.



The passages were familiar but I knew they didn't belong, my boots were sticking to the floor with every step, I knew what that meant, and I was right, beyond the next door was the fish processing room, where the line was drawn in. Despite the engine being off the machinery was still in motion, dead fish hanging on the hooks being fed into the machine that separated them to slide into the hold. As soon as I entered the stench was overwhelming, a fisherman becomes familiar with the scent of fish over time but this was another smell than that, it was like rot, a miasma of decay and salt, and something metallic, the faint light revealed the floor to be coated in dark red and sticky blood, with a thin iridescent film, like the sheen of oil on water.



I turned around to go back through the door, as the engine would be the other way, but the handle wouldn’t budge. I struggled with it for a moment before I heard the ship echo, groaning like a whale, it went all the way to my teeth and the pressure of the room changed, an oily liquid began seeping through the door and down the walls, dripping from the ceiling. I stumbled backwards, my boots slipping, and I fell backwards, where a hook that had just had a fish separated from it caught me, it dug deep into my shoulder, I tried to get my balance and remove it but before I could get it out I fell backwards over and into the hatch down into the hull, the hook ripped its way out of my shoulder. (Malik lifts up his sleeve showing the archivist a now healed gnarled old scar that by is circa 8 centimeters across)



I fell into a fish tub, and could feel myself sinking down into the fish that filled it, and I tried to crawl my way out, the ceiling was far higher than it should have been for the hold, it was dark as well, the mess of scales and slime, my hands could not find purchase in anything, I sank and I sank, down into the slick filth, my feet reached for anything to push against, a fish tub is not very large, but it felt bottomless, is was surrounded by dead fish, burying alive, their small black pearl eyes all glared at me, gazing at me, and I could feel what their dead eyes were seeing, they were seeing a whale.



As all light began being blotted out, and my breathing was straining under the weight upon me, I knew I was somehow still sinking, and that I was going somewhere. As I was drowning in that black ichor, I felt my feet become free, I spent all the last remaining energy I could, to bury myself even deeper, it was into water, it was freezing cold, I didn't know where I was going, but I slowly broke free into the water, I don’t know how long it was until I could breathe again but I kept feeling like I was about to pass out but kept going on, it was very disorienting when I broke free from the fish, the pressure in my ears screamed at me that was upside down, and I began swimming down, floating down, and then when I was almost about to let the seawater enter my lungs as I could feel my body beginning to give up and spasm I broke a water surface, I was able to breathe, I began a coughing fit, and couldn't orient myself.



I came too in the kitchen wrapped in a blanket, Marius had apparently pulled me out of the water, he said that when his shift began I was missing, and he looked for me before he heard my coughing off starboard and he dove in to save me.

Marius wasn't supposed to begin his shift for at least another 3 hours into my shift.

I don't understand what I experienced, but I can’t look at the eyes of fish anymore, whales, and whatever that—thing—was, it all changed my understanding, what I saw during that time, that pupil, what I had seen before, the centuries I had seen in the eyes of whales, the soft sorrow of the sea, they were just a fraction of what had been reflected onto them, from something else, not just centuries, or milenia, but true age, like the mountains or ocean, and not sorrow, but something I don't even have the words for. I know now that the eyes of whales do not contain the depths of the ocean, but that the depths of the ocean contain something else, and that is what I saw.



That was my last time on the Lomur. It was my last time at sea. I flew to England after we reached shore. I haven't eaten a fish since, their pearly black eyes freak me out—I see that depth again each time I see a fish. I live in Chesterfield now, as far from the ocean as I can get in this country. But still, every time I pass a body of water and I look down at it, it gives me vertigo, and the hair on my arms sticks up with this unease of what lies beneath.



I did try to talk to the others about what happened, but every time I asked them anything about it they seemed confused, they think I just injured myself falling into the water while out for a smoke, probably thinking I also hit my head, but I didn’t speak to Krogh, I was hesitant to, but I put it off until we reached land, but then he was just gone, I didn’t see him leave when we hit land, I may have just missed him as he left, but I have an unease about him now that I look back, I am not sure he was on the ship when we docked.

1raxi2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Empowish/comments/1raxi2t/thought_i_was_too_lazy_to_ever_wake_up_early/,Thought I was too lazy to ever wake up early: Found the real reason I struggled and now hit my alarm consistently (60-day streak) 🧠,"For years, my morning routine was a battle: alarm goes off, I snooze it, maybe seven times, then drag myself out of bed in a groggy panic. I’d call myself lazy, blame a lack of willpower, and swear *tomorrow* would be different. Every single day, I felt like I was starting behind, already defeated before my feet hit the floor.

I tried everything: moving my alarm across the room, drinking water immediately, going to bed 'early' (which rarely stuck). None of it worked. I’d still find a way to hit snooze, or just feel miserable doing it. I even bought blackout curtains and tried sleep meditation apps. *Nothing*.
Then I realized the real problem wasn't my alarm clock or my 'laziness'; it was **the sheer friction of the first 5 minutes** and the lack of a compelling reason *beyond* just 'waking up early.' My breakthroughs came when I started focusing not on *when* I woke up, but *how* I ensured a tiny win right after.

After failing countless times, here’s the three-part framework I stumbled upon that finally broke my snooze habit and got me a 60-day streak (and counting!):

**The 3-Part 'Momentum Morning' Framework:**

1.  **The Evening Setup (10 min): Create your 'Gravity Well'.**
    *   This is about making the *next* morning's first win almost inevitable. Before bed, lay out your workout clothes, pack your lunch, or set up your coffee maker. My specific go-to is preparing my gym bag and writing down the *one* thing I absolutely must do first thing. *I literally write: 'Walk 10 min' or 'Meditate 5 min'.* This removes decision fatigue and makes the first step clear.
    *   *Example:* I used to scramble for socks. Now, my entire gym outfit is laid out, water bottle filled, by my bed. My brain knows exactly what to do.

2.  **The 'One-Action Alarm' (1 min): Get Out & Act.**
    *   Place your alarm *just far enough* that you have to stand up to turn it off. The key here is that **the moment you stand, you immediately perform the 'one thing' you set up last night.** No phone checking, no pondering, just immediate movement towards that pre-planned, tiny win.
    *   *Example:* My alarm is by my running shoes. The second I turn it off, I put on my shoes and walk out the door for a quick 10-minute walk. No thinking.

3.  **The 'Tiny Win' Momentum (5-10 min): Build the Cascade.**
    *   This is the critical step. Your first action shouldn't be daunting. It's not 'do a full workout' or 'write a novel.' It's a tiny, achievable win that builds immediate confidence and momentum for the rest of your day. This small success triggers a dopamine hit and makes the next step feel easier.
    *   *Example:* My 10-minute walk isn't a workout; it's just *moving*. When I get back, I already feel accomplished. *I've won the morning.* This small win then makes it easier to tackle my coffee, shower, and actual work.

I tried the ""cold shower"" trick first and it failed miserably because I hated it so much I'd find ways to avoid getting out of bed. The key here is making the *first action* something you mildly enjoy or at least find tolerable, and super easy.

Here's what I wish someone told me before I started: **this isn't magic, and some mornings still suck.** The part nobody talks about is that sometimes you'll have a terrible night's sleep, or feel genuinely unwell. I almost gave up when I had a week of interrupted sleep due to a sick pet. I snoozed, felt like a failure, and thought the streak was over.
This won't work if you're consistently getting less than 6 hours of sleep due to other commitments, or if you try to make your 'tiny win' too big. Don't expect instant gratification either; it took me about *two weeks* to feel less resistance, and a full month to feel like it was becoming second nature. Common mistake: trying to change your entire morning routine at once. Focus only on the getting-out-of-bed part first.

After 60 consecutive days, I've successfully woken up with my alarm every single morning. That's 60 days of starting my day on my terms, with a clear head, instead of playing catch-up. I'm consistently getting my 'one thing' done before 7 AM, which has freed up mental space and reduced my stress significantly. This isn't about getting up at 4 AM; it's about winning the first 15 minutes of your day, whatever time you choose.

Anyhoo. The other day I found myself close to  St James Park, and I decided to go to formative coffee. I opted for their lychee coffe and… well… I’m NOT in to fruit infused coffees. They are a spectacle to me. And this cup certainly was as well. 

Smell was distinctive, taste less so. I got a hand brew. I guess. The menu did not specify the method. But it came in’s little decanter and I got to pour my own cup.  Music was loud, some

Kind of reggaeton. Small shop. Not very relaxing place. Not a place I would sit in to have a coffee. Also NOT my style of coffee and a bit of a weak cup without much body to it. Price was about 7 pounds.

Round the corner was a Nostos, so I went there because i didn’t even finish my cup at formative. Music was to loud, and up to weak.

At nostos i payed 17 quid for a mediocre cup. I can’t even remember the bean, the country or much of it. It was supposed to have notes of earl grey. This was hand brewed as specified by the menu. But really an all in all  a  underwhelming experience.  Service was friendly at the counter, but more confused at the table. Cup was ok, but not at all extra ordinary.

The next day I found myself in the vicinity of Prufrock Coffee, a saddle space for a Nordic coffee geek like me. But no, I went for a bean from nomad. Not really my style. A bit too sweet, a bit too extravagant. Not elegant enough. Cup was tasting of being over extracted, having table service was nice but very RUSHED not at all what I expected after paying 12 quid for a cup.

This is a wide margin, no doubt – but the Spurs will cover it.

1raxekq,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1raxekq/39_m4f_cleveland_ohioonline_you_dont_wanna_get/,"39 [M4F] #Cleveland, Ohio/Online. - You don't wanna get mixed up with a guy like me. I'm a loner, Dottie. A rebel.","TL;DR: Internet-addicted PC gamer seeks someone to talk to about video games and other very important topics.

I'm a grown man that is living out his childhood dreams of sitting around playing video games all day. Since I was a child that's really what I've wanted to do, the only difference between my childhood fantasies and my current reality is that I didn't want to be alone while I did this.

In my dating history I've always found the most important part of a relationship to me is the conversation. There's a certain flow that good conversationalists have that other people just don't. An ability to flow with the topics, to interject comedy, to take a piece of something and spin it into something else, some people just get it but a lot of people do not.

I'm looking for someone who can mock any topic while also mocking the person they're talking to and mocking themselves, much like Statler and Waldorf on The Muppets.

Conversation flow is enough for even people with nothing in common to get along for a few days, but for something more lasting I think you need more compatibility.

With that in mind the rest of this ad is gonna be ranting about myself to help you establish if you think we might have similar tastes and mentalities.

Positive Traits:

I'm intelligent enough to not feel immodest or arrogant saying I'm intelligent.

If we're on the same wavelength I'm hilarious. If we are not on the same wavelength I am probably disturbing and awkward.

Overly honest. Everyone lies, myself included, but I make a conscious effort to minimize it and not abuse my powers for evil.

Loyal. I'm someone who likes an extremely small social circle so I tend to be pretty intent on doing right by the handful of people in that circle.

Extremely self-aware. That's what separates me from the rest of the crazies.

Hobbies:

PC Gaming.

Overindulging in most other types of media, typically in the background while gaming. TV, movies, podcasts, music, YouTube rabbit holes. I try to incorporate some things with subtitles to pull me away from gaming and get me exercising as I watch anime or some other foreign media.

Boxing, or more accurately hitting a punching bag because all other cardio is boring.

Quirks:

I don't like driving or even being in cars. I have a car and do drive but I hate it.

I don't like phones. I do not utilize them in my daily life, I use them primarily for GPS.

No interest in fashion in the real world. I dress for comfort and usually am not even aware of what I am currently wearing, I grab what's at the top of the laundry pile. I do however care about fashion when it comes to my virtual avatars inside video games.

I've smoked marijuana on and off for 25 years. Currently on.

I've drank coffee and tea on and off for the last 25 years. Currently off.

Apolitical...maybe anti-political?

Areligious...maybe anti-religious?

A love of critters. I feed the local wildlife but have no pets, just some regular visitors.

Chronic smartass, trouble turning it off even at inappropriate times.

Popcorn brain, constant need for stimulation and thoughts that pop around. I associate things in conversation in odd ways that can often spark a desire to send a loosely connected meme, gif, or YouTube video.

Overly logical and analytical which tends to cause pessimism, though not necessarily pessimistic by default.

I avoid saturated fat, sugar and salt so my diet is extremely dull.


Red Flags:

5'6""

Rarely leaves the house. Not agoraphobic, just apathetic about the outside world.

Divorced for nearly a decade. No kids.

Lack of real world ambition. Endless ambition to conquer virtual worlds. Seeing a theme yet?

A complete disconnect from world events to a stubborn degree.

A general disdain for humanity.

Inconsistent use of the Oxford comma. Overuse of normal commas and ellipsiseses. I also use ""it's"" for both the possessive and conjunction.

Tend to act like and sound like I know what I'm talking about even when I most certainly don't.

So that's who I am, message me and let me know who you are.

1raxeh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1raxeh8/i_deleted_all_my_group_chats_for_60_days_and/,I deleted all my group chats for 60 days and realized I didn’t have real friends,"I was in 14 different group chats and felt lonelier than ever.

Every day my phone would buzz hundreds of times. Memes, random thoughts, arguments about nothing, plans that never happened, inside jokes I didn’t understand. I’d spend hours reading messages and sending responses and somehow feel more disconnected after.

I’m 25. For the past few years I’d been in more group chats than I could keep up with. College friends, work people, high school group, hobby groups, random chats that started and never died. My phone was constantly lighting up with messages from people I barely talked to one on one.

I thought this meant I had a great social life. Look how many group chats I’m in, look how many people want to talk to me, look how connected I am. I’d be responding to messages all day feeling busy and social.

But I was completely alone. I had hundreds of shallow group chat interactions and zero deep friendships. I couldn’t remember the last time I had a real conversation with someone. Not group banter, an actual conversation where someone knew what was going on in my life.

I’d share things in group chats and get reactions but nobody actually asked follow up questions. I’d see people posting about their lives and react with emojis but never actually reach out. Everything was surface level performed for the group.

The worst part was group chats made me think I had friends so I never built real friendships. Why reach out to someone individually when I could just send a message to the group and get instant responses? Why make plans with one person when the group chat gave me the feeling of connection without effort?

Two months ago I was scrolling through messages in six different group chats at once and realized I felt completely isolated. I was surrounded by constant communication and had nobody I could actually talk to about anything real.

I was in 14 group chats and had zero real friends.

What I actually did

Left every single group chat

Day one I went through my phone and left every group chat. All 14 of them. Work chats, friend groups, hobby chats, everything. Just left without explanation.

Some people reached out asking why I left. I said I needed space from group messaging. Most people didn’t notice or care.

Deleted Discord, WhatsApp, every group messaging app. If someone wanted to talk to me they’d have to actually message me directly or call.

Used this app called Reload to block all the group messaging platforms so I couldn’t rejoin in weak moments. Also used it to build a 60 day plan focused on actual connection instead of group chat performance.

Forced myself to reach out individually

The plan required me to have real one on one conversations. Not group chat banter, actual individual conversations with people.

Week one goal: reach out to three people individually and have real conversations. Not “hey what’s up” in a group, actual direct messages asking how they were and having a back and forth.

This felt terrifying. I’d gotten so used to the safety of group chats where everyone performs for the crowd. Individual conversations required vulnerability.

Made plans to see people in person

Instead of vague group chat plans that never happened, I started making concrete plans with individuals. Coffee, dinner, walks, whatever. Just one on one time.

Week two goal: see two people in person. Week four: see four people. Actually build real connections instead of just reacting to group messages.

Stopped performing friendship

In group chats I’d been performing. Sending memes, making jokes, participating in banter. It felt like friendship but it was just performance.

Real friendship required actually knowing people and being known. That meant vulnerable conversations, not curated group chat content.

Week 1 the silence was deafening

First week without group chats I realized how much of my day had been filled with meaningless messages.

Day 1 I kept reaching for my phone expecting notifications. Nothing. No group chat buzz. No messages to respond to. Just silence.

At first the silence felt lonely. Then I realized the group chats had made me feel more lonely. At least now I was alone honestly instead of surrounded by shallow connection.

Day 3 I reached out to someone I considered a friend individually. Asked how they were doing, tried to have a real conversation. They responded with one word answers. Realized we didn’t actually have a friendship outside the group chat.

Day 5 I tried reaching out to three different people. One ignored me. One gave short responses. One actually engaged and we had a real conversation for the first time in years.

Day 7 I met someone for coffee. First time seeing them one on one instead of in a group setting. The conversation was awkward at first but we actually talked about real things. I learned stuff about their life I never knew despite being in group chats with them for three years.

Week one showed me how many of my “friendships” were just group chat memberships. When I removed the group, there was nothing there.

Week 2 to 3 I saw who my real friends were

Weeks two and three I kept reaching out individually and the results were clear.

Most people didn’t respond or gave minimal effort. We’d been in group chats together for years but had no actual friendship. The group chat was the friendship and without it we had nothing to talk about.

Day 10 I reached out to someone I’d been in three different group chats with. They left me on read. Realized they didn’t actually care about me as an individual, just enjoyed the group dynamic.

Day 14 I had dinner with someone one on one. We talked for two hours. Actual deep conversation about life, struggles, goals. I learned more about them in two hours than three years of group chats.

Week three I identified maybe four people who actually engaged when I reached out individually. Four real friends out of the 50+ people across all those group chats.

Day 18 one of those four friends told me they’d noticed I left the groups and asked if I was okay. First person who actually checked in on me as an individual instead of just missing my presence in the chat.

Day 21 I went for a walk with another real friend. We talked about actual things happening in our lives. They asked follow up questions. Remembered things I’d told them before. This was friendship. Group chats were just noise.

Week 4 to 6 I built actual friendships

Weeks four through six I stopped trying to maintain shallow group chat relationships and invested in the real ones.

I had coffee with my four actual friends weekly. We’d have real conversations, not perform for a group. They knew what was happening in my life and I knew what was happening in theirs.

Day 28 I told one of them about something I was struggling with. They listened and actually helped. Realized I could never have that conversation in a group chat where 12 people are reading.

Day 35 I met someone new through a hobby and we actually became friends. Not group chat acquaintances, real friends. We talked one on one, made individual plans, built actual connection.

Week six I had maybe six real friendships. Six people I actually knew and who actually knew me. Compared to 14 group chats with 50+ people where nobody knew anything real about me.

Day 40 one of my real friends called me just to talk. No reason, just wanted to check in. This never happened when all my friendships were group chat based.

Week 7 to 8 I understood what I’d been missing

Last two weeks I realized what real friendship actually was and how group chats had prevented it.

Day 50 I had dinner with two of my real friends. Not a group hangout, just three people who actually knew each other having real conversation. This was what I’d been missing for years.

Week eight someone from one of my old group chats reached out. Said the group wasn’t the same without me. I realized they missed my performance for the group, not me as a person.

Day 55 I had a hard day and called one of my real friends. They talked to me for an hour. This would’ve never happened in a group chat where everything is surface level.

Day 60 I looked at my phone. Six real friends I talked to regularly. Six people who actually knew me and I actually knew them. Compared to 14 group chats where I was just another participant in collective noise.

What actually changed in 60 days

I went from 50+ acquaintances to 6 real friends

Sounds like a downgrade until you realize the 50+ weren’t actually friends. Just people I sent memes to in group chats.

I had real conversations instead of performed banter

Group chats were performance. One on one conversations were real. I finally had people who actually knew what was happening in my life.

I stopped feeling lonely while surrounded by people

Group chats made me feel connected while being completely alone. Real friendships made me feel connected because I actually was.

I learned who actually cared about me

Most people only engaged in group settings. Real friends engaged individually.

My social battery improved

Responding to 14 group chats was exhausting. Six real friendships was energizing.

I built depth instead of breadth

14 shallow group chat friendships versus 6 deep real friendships. The 6 were infinitely more valuable.

What I learned about group chats and friendship

Group chats create the illusion of friendship without the substance. You feel connected because messages are constant but nobody actually knows you.

Most group chat friendships disappear the moment you leave the group. If the friendship requires the group to exist, it’s not real.

People perform in group chats. Nobody is vulnerable or real because everyone is watching. Real friendship requires one on one space.

Group chats prevent deep friendship because they satisfy the need for connection without requiring effort. Why reach out individually when the group chat gives you easy surface level interaction?

You can be in dozens of group chats and have zero real friends. The number of groups doesn’t matter if none of the relationships have depth.

Real friendship requires individual investment. Calls, one on one time, actual conversations. Group chats let you avoid all of that.

If you’re in lots of group chats but feel lonely

Look at your group chats honestly. How many of those people would you have real friendships with if the group disappeared?

Leave one group chat for a week. See if anyone reaches out individually. If nobody does, that group wasn’t providing real friendship.

Reach out to people individually instead of only talking in groups. Real friends will engage. Group chat acquaintances won’t.

Make one on one plans instead of group hangouts. Deep friendship requires individual time.

Use tools to limit group chat time. I used Reload to block the apps entirely and focus on individual connection.

Give it 30 days of individual outreach. You’ll quickly see who your real friends are versus who just enjoyed the group dynamic.

Build depth with a few people instead of breadth with many groups. Six real friends beats 14 group chats.

Final thought

I spent years thinking I had great social life because I was in 14 different group chats. Hundreds of messages daily, constant interaction, always connected.

I was completely alone. Zero real friendships. Just shallow group chat performance.

Spent 60 days investing in individual friendships instead of group chats and built actual connection for the first time.

You probably have group chats you think are friendships. They’re probably not. The group is doing the work, not the relationship.

Leave the groups. Reach out individually. See who’s actually there.

The version of you with six real friends is infinitely less lonely than the version in 14 group chats.

He also won’t have spicy sleep with me anymore, saying he’s just not in the mood and just not into me like that right now. 

A few weeks ago, he randomly went to a bikini barista even though he doesn’t like coffee. I told him it makes me uncomfortable for him to go somewhere specifically to lust after another woman. He said I was crazy for that but agreed to not go again.

Yesterday, he was late home from work. He told me he went to get a massage, spent $50 and gave me a $20 tip on a half hour massage. When he got home, he turned around and left again to get gas and transfer money into another one of his accounts. He was gone for about an hour and a half. When he got back we finished cooking dinner together and ate. This is important for later. 

He said the place he went to has couples massages for cheap but I couldn’t remember the place so I went to his bank to see what the place was called. He was sleeping so I couldn’t ask him, but when I Typed out massage, and 3 charges came up. One in late January, and Two for yesterday 

He’d made a big deal about it being his first massage, so why was there a charge earlier for it? And why, if he had a half hour massage, was he charged two times, one for $50 and one for $40+? 

He said that he paid for half an hour and the decided to get another half hour… but that would be identical charges, and he specifically told me the massage was only a half hour one. 

Then, when he left for an hour before dinner, there was a -$80 ATM charge.. but it wasn’t in the other bank account like he’d told me it was. He literally, as we were eating dinner was like “oh I have money in the other account now” and the account was empty?? So why lie about that?

When he left for that hour and a half before dinner, our roommates were cooking so I asked if I could go with him and kill some time with him.. he said no… and then goes and $80 just disappeared in an hour? 

He told me he got food and snacks, but it was the hour before dinner, and there were no food wrappers or snack stuff in his car at all, so where did that $80 go? 

He’s saying I’m crazy and paranoid, but he’s definitely out paying for handjobs or something right? There’s no reason a person hides getting massages and lies about where money goes unless there’s a reason.

Am I being crazy and paranoid or is this actually weird?",1,1771695792.0,okstorytime,3,1.0,False
1raxckn,https://www.reddit.com/r/artcommissions/comments/1raxckn/hiring_artist_to_create_a_classic_nasastyle/,[Hiring] Artist to Create a Classic NASA-style Mission Patch,"Hello all you lovely artists!

I am an aerospace engineer who used to work at NASA, but now works at a fairly small company with a lot of engineers who are new to the space industry. I have an old jacket that I sew patches on for every mission I work on. Unfortunately, the commercial space industry doesn't make patches for their missions like the government does.

# Background

The team that I work with has been working so hard over the last year; there have been a lot of late nights and weekends lost and the higher-ups aren't always supportive. I wanted to make a bunch of patches for them to cherish and remember the project by, since for many of them, this is their first space mission.

This patch *would not* be for sale or distribution outside of that group. It is just a memento to lift everyone's spirits and remind them they are appreciated.

Our manager really loves the ""I just need to lock in"" and ""3 coffees, no lunch"" horse memes and has them hanging in his office. Whenever we need to get something done quickly, we look to the horses for guidance. In addition, the project we are working on is related to auroras so that would form a nice backdrop. 

[My manager has this hanging in his office for inspiration.](https://preview.redd.it/i7vmbk4sqvkg1.jpg?width=561&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4919f042bbadf854f651cac49a7ecc0ee7ebfb98)

The component we're working on is called the ""Propellant Management Assembly"". I can't share pictures of it, but it doesn't look very interesting anyways... So for the patch, I was thinking it could be **a horse running through an aurora**.

# Reference Images

I tried to make an example of what I was thinking of. A circular patch with the product name and company name (I don't want to say where I work on a Reddit post), with the horse as the forefront coming out of frame a bit with some stars breaking up the background.

[A fever dream I came up with that needs a real artist to make look good...](https://preview.redd.it/assoj4lsrvkg1.png?width=756&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbe41bc4c33d4bfc6fb4a17f0b3fcc9ea903a298)

It's a funny concept and that's okay! It's a very young and tight-knit group who would get a kick out of something like this.

That being said, I am also **100% open to other ideas!**

I am a big fan of the classic NASA patch aesthetic and included a couple of my favorites here for reference. These patches are specifically stylized to be more than just a drawing of a spacecraft in front of some stars, which is more interesting to me.

[Mission patch for the OSIRIS-REX mission. Probably one of the best to ever be made.](https://preview.redd.it/0yl7wyrgtvkg1.png?width=277&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3ed5214a252aa7f7ad08412e42bcd97604373b8)

# Work to Be Performed and Payment

I would like either a PNG or an SVG that is suitable to be made into physical patches. If you have any experience with making patches, that is a definite plus! I have been looking into some Etsy shops that do custom, low batch, patches and it looks like designs that only have a moderate amount of detail (thread can only be so small) and a limited amount of colors (8 or less) tend to make the best patches.

I have a base budget of **$200**, but that can be negotiated if there ends up being more work than anticipated.

Please comment and let me know if you are interested in the work and please link your portfolio. If you made it this far down the post, I really appreciate it. Looking forward to working with you!",8,1771695707.0,artcommissions,19,1.0,False

I’m torn between the DF54 ($230) and the Ode Gen 2 ($400). I was set on the DF54 but heard that the luck of customer support is a major issue. Fellow seems more established.

Is the Ode really worth $170 more, or is that overkill for french press, mokapot, and pourovers?

1raxb3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/AsianParentStories/comments/1raxb3i/daddys_princess/,Daddys princess,"I have an Indian family so usually the son is the favourite and the daughter is not the favourite

In my case it’s the opposite

I am the son and I am by far not the favourite

The favourite is my younger sister

I am 22 and she is 19

And it’s been always like this

I still live with my mom and dad in our three-bedroom house in the suburbs of New Jersey and honestly nothing has changed. My sister’s 19 and she’s the golden child. Me? I’m always the one in the wrong the scapegoat for everything. If something goes wrong in the house it’s automatically my fault. “Beta why did you do that?” they say even if I had nothing to do with it. And my sister? She’s always right always the innocent one.

It’s like this invisible rule in our family. Since I was young I’ve been painted as the “bad person” type. Punishments are never fair night and day difference between us. If I come home with a bad grade say a C in a class I get a proper thrashing a big spanking that leaves me sore for days. Mom or Dad go on about how I’m wasting their hard-earned money from long hours at work not studying hard enough to make something of myself. But if my sister brings home the same crappy report card or bombs a test? She just gets a mild scolding like “Next time do better okay?” and maybe no phone for a night. That’s it. No drama no pain.

Same with chores. Everyone’s supposed to pitch in with cleaning laundry dishes all that. If I forget to do my bit like taking out the trash or loading the dishwasher I’m punished big time I have to do every single chore in the house for the entire week. Vacuum mop cook breakfast everything. Exhausting. But if she forgets hers? They just shrug and turn to me “You’re the older one just do it and don’t annoy us.” Like I’m her permanent backup. It makes me resentful but complaining only makes things worse.

And don’t get me started on the after-work routines. Both my parents work long hours Dad commuting into the city Mom in an office job. When Dad gets home tired from traffic the first thing he does is kick off his shoes and expect a foot massage. Always me. “Come here give me a proper press” he says and I have to sit on the floor for 20-30 minutes rubbing his feet while he scrolls through his phone or watches the news. If I complain even a little like “Dad my hands hurt” or “Why not her?” I get a slap or worse a spanking like I’m still a kid. No discussion.

Mom’s the same. When she comes back feet aching she wants the same treatment. I try to argue sometimes saying “Now she can do it it’s her turn!” But nope. They side with her instantly “She’s younger she’s studying don’t be lazy.” And if I push back I end up doing it anyway or face punishment no dinner extra chores the usual.

It’s the same with anything physical or heavy. It’s always me not just sometimes. If the garage needs clearing out because it’s packed with old boxes broken furniture piles of old papers and random junk we’ve accumulated over the years they call me “You’re the son this is man’s work go sort it out.” I spend the whole Saturday dragging heavy tool chests across the concrete coughing from dust lifting crates full of holiday decorations and old sports gear stacking everything while sweat pours down my back. My sister stays inside with the AC on on her phone.

Or when we plant a big shrub from the garden center and need to dig a deep hole in the backyard dirt. Dad hands me the shovel “Beta you’re strong this is boy’s job.” I’m out there in the summer heat for almost two hours hacking at hard soil blisters on my hands shirt soaked. Mom and Dad watch from the deck nodding like it’s normal. She stays inside with a cold drink.

Heavy lifting happens all the time. When the garage door opener breaks and we have to haul in a new fridge or washing machine from the driveway I carry the heavy boxes up the steps alone. Or when the living-room ceiling fan starts wobbling and needs to come down and be re-fixed guess who climbs the ladder holding the fixture and tools? Me. “Man’s work” every single time.

About a year ago she got completely obsessed with wanting a dog. For months she wouldn’t stop talking about it how badly she needed one how she’d be the best owner how she’d train it to do tricks take it on long walks play with it in the yard cuddle it every night. She said it would make her feel less lonely and give her something to love that was just hers. But it was impossible. My sister is allergic to dogs I’m allergic to dogs and my dad is allergic to dogs too. We all get the same reaction nonstop sneezing itchy swollen eyes runny nose coughing fits even skin rashes if we’re around one too long. We told her repeatedly it wasn’t going to happen no way around the allergies.

She didn’t accept it. She’d throw full-on tantrums crying hysterically screaming that it wasn’t fair that all her friends had pets and she was the only one missing out that we were ruining her happiness on purpose. She’d lock herself in her room for hours sobbing about how much she wanted that unconditional love and loyalty from a dog.

Then one weekend Dad surprised her. He came home with a fluffy golden retriever puppy barely three months old and a car full of stuff a soft plush dog bed a sturdy leash and collar set chew toys squeaky balls rope tug toys a bag of premium puppy food treat pouches a water bottle for walks grooming brushes even little poop bags and a training clicker. She lost it screaming with joy hugging the puppy kissing its head calling him her baby. For a few days she was in heaven carrying him around trying to teach him sit and stay taking short walks around the block.

But after just one week the reality hit hard. All three of us started suffering badly constant sneezing attacks eyes so red and puffy we could barely see throats itchy and coughing my dad’s asthma flaring up. The house smelled like wet dog fur even after vacuuming and the allergies got worse every day. We couldn’t breathe properly couldn’t sleep and it was affecting work and school. We had no choice we had to give the puppy away to one of Dad’s coworkers who had no allergies and could keep him. She cried for days refused to eat much kept saying how much she missed him.

She kept bringing it up hysterical again telling everyone how she loved teaching him tricks (he learned sit and paw in days) how fun the walks were how he’d wag his tail and follow her everywhere how empty the house felt without that. She’d show us old videos of her playing with him and tear up saying she missed having someone who listened to her commands and was always excited to see her.

One evening after dinner with all of us sitting around the table Dad looked at her crying quietly again and said he couldn’t stand seeing her this sad anymore. Then right there in front of Mom my sister and me he turned to me and said “Since we can’t have a real dog because of the allergies you’re going to be her dog now.” He explained it clearly in front of everyone I would do the things she misses most go on “walks” with her whenever she wants company outside play fetch or tug-of-war in the backyard if she feels like it let her give me “commands” or “train” me with tricks for fun basically act as her loyal companion who follows her around listens to what she says and makes her feel like she has that pet she’s been longing for.

I immediately said no that I didn’t want to do that that it was ridiculous and embarrassing. Dad’s face hardened. He said “This isn’t a choice. It’s what we’re doing to make your sister happy. You’re the older one you can handle it.” My sister lit up instantly clapping her hands and saying “Yes please yes please yes please!” over and over bouncing in her seat like it was the best idea ever. Mom nodded along saying it would be good for family peace. I had no other choice I had to agree right there or face the usual punishments plus more guilt-tripping about making her sad.

Then Dad added the rule whenever I have free time and I’m not busy with work studying or required chores my sister can just tell me to “become her dog.” That’s how it’s been for the past year now. Basically if I’m sitting on the couch scrolling my phone or lying in my room relaxing or finishing something early she can walk in and say “Dog time!” or “Be my dog now” and I have to drop whatever I’m doing and switch into it. No arguing no delaying.

She takes it very seriously and pushes it as far as she can every single time. When she calls me she expects me to get down on all fours right away no standing no walking upright. She’ll snap her fingers or say “Come here boy” in that high-pitched commanding tone she used with the puppy. If I’m slow she’ll whine to Dad or Mom that I’m being a “bad dog” and they’ll tell me to hurry up and obey. She puts the old puppy collar around my neck (it’s tight and digs in a bit but she likes how it looks) clips on the leash and either “walks” me around the living room and hallway on my hands and knees or takes me out to the fenced backyard where the neighbors can’t see. She tugs the leash if I don’t keep up or if I try to stand.

For playtime she throws balled-up socks tennis balls or even the old chew toys and makes me “fetch” crawl after it pick it up in my mouth (she insists on that part) and bring it back to drop at her feet. If I use my hands instead she scolds me like “No hands dogs don’t use hands!” and makes me redo it. She’ll play tug-of-war with the rope toy pulling hard while I have to hold the other end in my mouth and pull back on all fours until she “wins” and laughs about how strong her dog is.

The training part is her favorite. She’ll spend 20–30 minutes making me repeat tricks over and over “sit” (kneel straight) “paw” (hold up one hand) “roll over” (lie down and roll onto my back) “stay” (freeze in place while she walks around me or pretends to leave the room) “speak” (bark on command she makes me actually say “woof” or “arf” out loud). She uses her tongue to click like the old training clicker and if I get it right she’ll say “Good boy!” in a baby voice and sometimes give me a small treat like a piece of chocolate or a cookie from her hand. If I mess up or hesitate she’ll say “Bad dog” and lightly tap my nose or make me start over from the beginning until I do it perfectly.

On weekends when I have no studies or work and plenty of free time she insists that I sleep on the dog bed. She’ll leash me to the leg of her bed or the couch spread the plush dog bed on the floor in her room or the living room and make me lie down there for the night curled up no blanket unless she decides to throw one over me and no getting up until she unclips the leash in the morning. She says it’s what a good dog would do and if I complain she reminds Dad that I’m supposed to make her happy.

Sometimes she sees me with free time and just decides it’s “dog time” without warning. She’ll leash me to the leg of the dining table or the coffee table make me crawl under it and then go about her own thing watching TV scrolling on her phone doing homework eating snacks completely ignoring me for 30 minutes an hour or longer. I have to stay there on all fours quiet no talking unless she asks me something just waiting like a tied-up pet while she pretends I’m not even there except when she wants to give a command.

The most humiliating part is when she does it during breakfast. As soon as we sit down to eat she’ll say “Dog time” before anyone starts leash me under the kitchen table and our parents just go along with it. My food gets taken off the table and placed on the floor in a bowl or on a plate no utensils no chair. I have to eat it like that on all fours head down while they eat normally above me chatting like nothing is unusual. She’ll sometimes drop bits of her food for me to “beg” for or make me wait until she says “eat” before I can start. Our parents never stop it they just say it keeps her content and that I should be a good brother.

And once I’m in “dog mode” my father treats me like one too. If he walks by while I’m on all fours or leashed under the table he’ll say things like “Good dog stay quiet” or “Don’t make a mess boy” in the same tone he used with the puppy. He’ll even give me commands sometimes like “sit” if I’m moving around too much or “stay” if I try to shift position. If I don’t respond fast enough he’ll scold me the same way he scolds me for anything else but now it’s mixed with “bad dog” comments that make it clear he’s fully playing along. He never stops her or tells her to ease up he just reinforces it saying things like “Listen to your owner” or “Be a good pet for your sister.” It makes the whole thing feel even more permanent like the whole family has accepted this role for me.

She records short clips on her phone sometimes (promising not to share them) zooming in on me doing tricks or crawling and giggles about how cute her “dog” is. Our parents see it happening and just smile or say “See she’s happy now” never stepping in no matter how long it goes or how ridiculous it gets.

So one day I get fed up and try flipping their logic. They tell me to cook dinner because Mom is running late and I say “Okay but since I always have to do all the heavy physical stuff because I’m the son and ‘man has to do it’ can’t she handle this? Cooking’s more of a girl’s thing right? Let her do the kitchen stuff.” Oh man the reaction. Dad’s face goes red “What nonsense? You’re twisting everything to get out of work! In this house we don’t do that.” Mom jumps in “You think you’re clever? You will cook and do it properly.” If I mutter or drag my feet starting punishment hits extra chores the next day a slap or phone and TV taken away for the evening. They throw around “equality” only when it shuts me up but nothing else ever changes.

It’s like I’m the family workhorse not the son. Over the years it’s created this quiet tension. I love my family don’t get me wrong but why the double standards? In a lot of families like ours the son gets the breaks the attention the easier path. Here it’s flipped and I’m still waiting to see if it’ll ever even out.",0,1771695616.0,AsianParentStories,0,0.5,False

He was my best man, I was his. I won’t get into the dirty details but this year he was caught cheating and split up with his wife. We met up a few times because this was obviously a huge deal and, even though he was clearly the bad actor here, I wanted to give the benefit of the doubt and be a good friend in any way I could. His story was that she was cold to him and that they had a dead bedroom for years and he felt like he had no other choice blah blah blah.

I heard him out, but I had a gut feeling something was off. My wife was disgusted and I admit I got the ick too, but I wanted to reserve judgment and try to be a bro to this guy. Anyway fast forward a few months and he is bragging about all the women he’s dating and basically giving cringe divorced dad vibes and, again, I just got a gut feeling that something was off.

I had meant to contact his ex, who is also my good friend, for a while and we met for coffee. Well… my gut was right. Turns out the betrayal and the abuse had been going on for years and years. His description of the situation was his own little sanitized narrative. Again, I won’t go into the details but my jaw was on the floor. I was completely shocked. His behaviour was beyond disgusting and I realized that I had just been interacting with a mask all these years. I promised I would not say anything as it is clear that he is a legitimately dangerous person and I fear for her safety. The problem is, because I have promised not to reveal the awful truth, I am the only guy in the friend group that knows it.

This guy is a master manipulator and has already been working overtime to make me look like a bad friend and I feel like my group is buying it. I want nothing to do with this guy. I have cut him off entirely. But I can already feel the rest of the group pulling away from me. It fucking sucks. The most disappointing part is even his sanitized narrative should have been bad enough to make people pull away from him, but it feels like my guy friends are totally unbothered by this psycho. I know I’m doing the right thing for myself by sticking with my values and boundaries or whatever, but I feel hurt.",17,1771695537.0,offmychest,6,1.0,False

Looking for a friendly social meet?,"There is a social meet for people affected by isolation, loneliness, remote working, unwanted solitude or a sense of alienation from the way society has changed in recent times.

Details on meetup: [https://www.meetup.com/alienation-glasgow/](https://www.meetup.com/alienation-glasgow/)

The events are to meet others in a safe social setting. No agenda, just a coffee meet. Free to attend. City centre cafe.

**Who this is for**

Anyone who feels a bit lost in modern life or overwhelmed at times.

Perhaps you feel alone or isolated. Maybe the world around you seems strange or remote or threatening. This can trigger feelings of depression or despair, which can be exacerbated by solitude.

Maybe you are surrounded by people with whom you cannot connect. They are too different or preoccupied in ways that distance them from you.

If any of this sounds familiar you are not alone.

We are living through an epidemic of loneliness, unexpected solitude and despondency. The world has went remote which does not suit everyone. Many people feel lost and isolated, perhaps you do too.

As we get older it becomes harder to meet new people and make friends. This is normal but feels abnormal when we have so much technology at our disposal. Everyone else seems to have the full life we lack and many have the online showreels to prove it.

This meetup is a small step towards reversing that for those who either find it difficult to connect with others in real time or who just can't find others like them.

We were in the break room and somehow movies came up, and this dude (let’s call him Mark) casually says, “Yeah, I saw Joker. It was well-acted, but I thought the social critique was kind of shallow.”

Shallow.

I actually laughed. Like, out loud. Not even on purpose. Just a reflex. Because when someone exposes themselves that quickly as media-illiterate, what else can you do?

I calmly put my coffee down and said, “Shallow? You realize the film is literally about society.”

He kind of shrugged and said, “Sure, but it presents a very simplified view. It doesn’t really explore systemic causes in depth, it just gestures at them.”

That’s when I knew I had him.

I leaned in slightly and said, “No. It does explore them. The whole point is that it doesn’t spoon-feed you. It respects the audience’s intelligence.”

He blinked a couple times. Completely unprepared for that level of analysis.

He tried to pivot and said, “I mean, I got the themes. It just didn’t say anything new.”

This was honestly embarrassing for him.

I said, “It’s not about saying something new. It’s about saying something true.”

He didn’t respond immediately. Just kind of stood there. Probably realizing he’d stepped into deep water.

He then tried this weird angle like, “I thought it leaned heavily on references to earlier films without adding much of its own perspective.”

I immediately shut that down.

I said, “That’s called intertextuality. It’s what sophisticated films do. They assume you’re capable of connecting dots.”

He nodded slowly, which I interpret as acknowledgement.

Then he said, “I just didn’t find Arthur’s transformation entirely believable.”

I actually smiled at this point.

I said, “That’s because you’re expecting a conventional character arc. This isn’t a conventional film. It’s operating on a psychological level.”

He said, “I understand that, I just didn’t feel the film earned—”

I cut him off (respectfully).

“It did earn it. Every scene builds toward it. The laughter condition, the social worker, the bus scene, the Murray Franklin arc. It’s all there if you’re paying attention.”

He didn’t really have a comeback to that. Just kind of stared at his sandwich.

At one point he even said, “I liked parts of it, I just personally thought—”

And that’s when I dropped the hammer:

“It’s not about personal preference. It’s about recognizing what the film is doing.”

Silence.

Complete silence.

He just said, “Okay,” in this quiet voice and went back to eating.

The look on his face said everything. He knew.

What struck me most was how quickly his confidence evaporated once he realized he wasn’t dealing with a casual viewer. He was dealing with someone who actually understands cinema.

I wasn’t even being aggressive. Just stating facts. But you could tell he wasn’t used to having his takes examined at that level.

People think they can just casually dismiss this film without understanding its complexity. They see the surface and assume that’s all there is. They don’t realize it’s operating on multiple layers simultaneously: Psychological, societal, symbolic.

Anyway, I didn’t press him further. Didn’t need to. Point was made.

He’s been quieter than usual the rest of the day.

I'm in a great chapter of my life, I'm steady, growing, and genuinely happy. The only thing that would make it better is sharing it with the right person.

**If you´re interested in finding someone secure to build something together, you can go ahead and read my post**

**A bit about me**

I turned 21 a bit ago and live in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, very close to the Netherlands and Belgium. I'm 198cm tall, athletic with broad shoulders, and pretty cute lookswise (Pictures are available right away, just ask). I finished my bachelors last year and now I work in public administration in a above entry-level position.

In my free time, I'm into

* Reading (Mostly classics and fantasy novels)
* Artsy stuff (Writing, making clay figures, taking photos or refurnishing my room like I do at the moment)
* Cooking (Still suck at handling slabs of meat, but I´m getting there)
* Gaming (would love to play some co-op together)
* Binge-watching movies and shows
* Fitness (mostly lifting, jogging and calisthenics)
* Traveling (Next vacation is gonna be next month, yay)
* Self-care (I have a real love for fragrances and taking care of myself in general)

I'm the calm, confident, and dependable type. I'm direct in communication and I keep my plans. In public I'm pretty calm, but in private I'm very affectionate and playful. I really love taking care of the people I love through food, touch, words, and preparing surprises.

**What I hope we'll build**

I hope we can build something with a genuine friendship and genuine care as the foundation, without rushing anything. I'm looking for monogamy, adult communication, equal effort, consistency and intentionality right from the start. When we like each other, we act like it.

I believe something special happens in a romantic partnership, where it becomes the primary place for that deep, vulnerable connection. I'm looking to build that kind of close, singular bond with my person.

As for what I bring to the table for that:

* Stability and dependability
* Emotional health and availability (I protect time for my person)
* Maturity and good, direct communication
* A nurturing side with gentle humor and playful teasing

I value and need those traits in others a lot as well. So what I'm ultimately looking for is deep, mature, mutual devotion. A relationship where we both give to each other because it makes us happy. Not because we need each other to function, but because being together is fulfilling.

**Little dreams about us**

I'm not just looking for a plus-one for my existing plans, I'm looking for someone to make new ones with. My big dream is a partnership that feels like an adventure and a sanctuary in one. There are so many things I want to experience with you, especially when it comes to traveling:

* One of those glass igloo hotels in Lapland (look them up, you won't regret it)
* Touring through Europe together and the same through rural Japan
* And lots of trips together in general, since I travel about 3 times a year and would love for you to accompany me

But for me the foundation to something fullfilling is in the quieter daily moments like cozy weeknights where we recharge, make new experiences together on weekends, and the relaxation of cuddling up in bed together, especially in winter. I want a love that's as intentional in its daily rhythm as it is in its long-term plans.

**Closing Note**

I'm not too experienced with relationships, but I've put a lot of thought into what I want and what I can give. As I said, life has been going really well lately, I feel steady, content and I feel like I have a lot to give. Because of that, I've had the growing feeling that the right person is missing (You!). Like the title implies, I'd prefer to meet someone from NL/BE/DE so meeting up and spending time will be a lot easier, but I'm open to connections from anywhere in the EU as long as you are intentional and upfront.

A quick hello with your age and where you're from is a perfect start when you decide to reach out. To get us talking, tell me what kind of date we'll be doing first: coffee, a museum, or one of your suggestions! (Also, I text a lot less formally in private, but I thought it´d be best if I polished this post up haha)

I'll be honest: I'm selective. I turn down the majority of conversations early because I can tell they aren't leading to the kind of connection I've described above. My hope is that by being clear about what I'm looking for, I attract someone who's looking for the same thing and knows she's it.

To everyone reading this, whether you reach out or not, I'm wishing you the coziest saturday evening and hope you're well, wherever you are :) I'll be looking for your message",2,1771695308.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

1rax49b,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/1rax49b/21_m4f_germany_looking_for_a_relationship/,21 [M4F] Germany - Looking for a relationship,"I´ll be quick with this intro, because my post is long as fuck haha. I'm in a great chapter of my life, I'm steady, growing, and genuinely happy. The only thing that would make it better is sharing it with the right person.

**If you´re interested in finding someone secure to build something together, you can go ahead and read my post**

**A bit about me**

I turned 21 a bit ago and live in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, very close to the Netherlands and Belgium. I'm 198cm tall, athletic with broad shoulders, and pretty cute lookswise (Pictures are available right away, just ask). I finished my bachelors last year and now I work in public administration in a above entry-level position.

In my free time, I'm into

* Reading (Mostly classics and fantasy novels)
* Artsy stuff (Writing, making clay figures, taking photos or refurnishing my room like I do at the moment)
* Cooking (Still suck at handling slabs of meat, but I´m getting there)
* Gaming (would love to play some co-op together)
* Binge-watching movies and shows
* Fitness (mostly lifting, jogging and calisthenics)
* Traveling (Next vacation is gonna be next month, yay)
* Self-care (I have a real love for fragrances and taking care of myself in general)

I'm the calm, confident, and dependable type. I'm direct in communication and I keep my plans. In public I'm pretty calm, but in private I'm very affectionate and playful. I really love taking care of the people I love through food, touch, words, and preparing surprises.

**What I hope we'll build**

I hope we can build something with a genuine friendship and genuine care as the foundation, without rushing anything. I'm looking for monogamy, adult communication, equal effort, consistency and intentionality right from the start. When we like each other, we act like it.

I believe something special happens in a romantic partnership, where it becomes the primary place for that deep, vulnerable connection. I'm looking to build that kind of close, singular bond with my person.

As for what I bring to the table for that:

* Stability and dependability
* Emotional health and availability (I protect time for my person)
* Maturity and good, direct communication
* A nurturing side with gentle humor and playful teasing

I value and need those traits in others a lot as well. So what I'm ultimately looking for is deep, mature, mutual devotion. A relationship where we both give to each other because it makes us happy. Not because we need each other to function, but because being together is fulfilling.

**Little dreams about us**

I'm not just looking for a plus-one for my existing plans, I'm looking for someone to make new ones with. My big dream is a partnership that feels like an adventure and a sanctuary in one. There are so many things I want to experience with you, especially when it comes to traveling:

* One of those glass igloo hotels in Lapland (look them up, you won't regret it)
* Touring through Europe together and the same through rural Japan
* And lots of trips together in general, since I travel about 3 times a year and would love for you to accompany me

But for me the foundation to something fullfilling is in the quieter daily moments like cozy weeknights where we recharge, make new experiences together on weekends, and the relaxation of cuddling up in bed together, especially in winter. I want a love that's as intentional in its daily rhythm as it is in its long-term plans.

**Closing Note**

I'm not too experienced with relationships, but I've put a lot of thought into what I want and what I can give. As I said, life has been going really well lately, I feel steady, content and I feel like I have a lot to give. Because of that, I've had the growing feeling that the right person is missing (You!). Like the title implies, I'd prefer to meet someone from NL/BE/DE so meeting up and spending time will be a lot easier, but I'm open to connections from anywhere in the EU as long as you are intentional and upfront.

A quick hello with your age and where you're from is a perfect start when you decide to reach out. To get us talking, tell me what kind of date we'll be doing first: coffee, a museum, or one of your suggestions! (Also, I text a lot less formally in private, but I thought it´d be best if I polished this post up haha)

I'll be honest: I'm selective. I turn down the majority of conversations early because I can tell they aren't leading to the kind of connection I've described above. My hope is that by being clear about what I'm looking for, I attract someone who's looking for the same thing and knows she's it.

To everyone reading this, whether you reach out or not, I'm wishing you the coziest saturday evening and hope you're well, wherever you are :) I'll be looking for your message",1,1771695181.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1rax43b,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1rax43b/my_lukewarm_take_on_talking_heads/,My lukewarm take on talking heads,"For me, this falls into advice that should be known but not always followed. But for those that aren't aware, it's a critique on fiction that dialogue isn't grounded in it's environment. *They just talk*. This is nuanced, obviously, because every piece of ""general writing advice"" is.

I've posted this before, and I got downvoted. And after careful consideration I realized why: ***it's because I didn't put enough ego*** into it, some *real spirit*, real confidence. So take this advice with 0 salt, and treat it as gospel.  As a multiple time (future) published author, and numerous inmydreams bestseller awards, I gladly embark this advice to you.

I like rapid-fire dialogue. I like slow dialogue. I hate when I have to stop midway for the author to add an action beat, talking about how hot the coffee is when they drank it. I even hate, when there's reactive detail. That's right. I said it. Sorry, hate is a strong word, it really depends on how it's done. But, writers take this advice too seriously sometimes. I mean, have you heard of Shakespeare?

""Oh booo,"" you say, ""that's a different medium. People expect that kind of—\[more noises\]""

Obviously, it's a different medium. Obviously people expect *more details* out of a book. But if you told me Cyrano De Bergerac was a book, and screenwriting never existed, I'd be... oh that's weird, but okay. It's still good writing. It's good dialogue. It accomplishes everything it needs to in the dialogue alone.

Wait, so does white room syndrome exist? Yes, yes it does. But you can set up the environment chapters before. The apartment they return to? You described it in perfect detail in chapter 1! Just add a refreshing paragraph or two and off you go. What about the other person's house, they've never been there! Look future-author, I'm just saying there's nuance here. Just please, don't add in ""grounding action beats"" willy nilly during a dialogue.

Nonetheless, what I see more often, is that writers *depend* on action beats/reactions instead of writing good dialogue.

Another thing to consider, rhythm. This is less important for a lot of writers. But it's important to me. I like hearing the voices in my head. I like hearing the words as they appear before my eyes. Even writing this post, it needs to sound right in my head. I'm not saying people should speak in perfect iambic rhythm in harmonic sonnets when they meet. But you don't need to describe shaking hands or sipping coffee because you forgot to add in grounding details. Dialogue tags are utility, and they mark who's talking. They're invisible to the reader—unless you add too many. I like to add them every three lines, but if your dialogue is *distinct* to the speaker, sometimes you can do with less, and even then, clarity trumps style in writing.  *Adding anything more than dialogue tags adds a rest,* and I mean that rhythmically.

>""I found out you were cheating on me last night."" Her fingers rapped on the kitchen counter.

Is better than:

>Her fingers rapped on the kitchen counter. ""I found out you were cheating on me last night.""


or:

>""I found out you were cheating on me last night."" She waited by the kitchen counter. Her hands curled over each other, a wound up ball of anger, and the heat within flickered as white across her skin.

You might've said, ""I don't see anything wrong here!""

And you'd might be right! But you can do the same with *only dialogue*, *with rhythm, and keep it realistic.*

>""I found out you were cheating on me last night,"" she said.  
""Um—""  
""Guess who told me.""

I told you! Guess what, That piece of dialogue can take place anywhere! Suckit. Is it compelling? I think so. I'm also the best writer in the universe, nay—any given reality—even the fake one you're writing, and everyone who disagrees is *objectively* wrong.

But if you *must* add setting and whatnot, you can do that with dialogue. You can add personality, ironic drama, and a setting!

>""I found out you were cheating on me last night,"" she said.  
""... I really like what you did with the cabinets, hun.""  
""Guess who told me.""

So what am I saying? I'm saying don't discard your dialogue as talking heads. Also, don't throw that advice around—*they're just talking heads*. Duh. Heads talk. But why do you have a problem with it? Is there really a problem in this instance? Or are you trying to scrounge up nuanced writing advice to throw at the author? Maybe your dialogue *is* bad, just polish it up a little and put some oomph behind those words. You've got this! 

Now I must retreat and complete my minimum 10,000 words a day, and someday soon, I will pass along the power of (my) voice, and why it is the most important thing in your writing. ",0,1771695170.0,writers,2,0.4,False

# Thereafter

This is the other ten or so days after my initial discharge and re-admittance in the ER, the whole trip meant to only be *four* *days* but there I was.

The first two or so days back in the hospital went by in a combination of utter despair, sleeping, and a drug-induced fugue, pain meds around the clock every four hours. With the NG Tube, I couldn’t drink water, eat; it hurt to talk and breathe; the pills I had to take orally most of the time would get stuck on the tube. The dry mouth was insane, dehydration a close second.

I was beyond miserable, the will to live below zero. I didn’t want to do anything. Not read or write or look at my phone or watch TV or be awake. Only wanted to stare into the void and sleep. I was a husk, shell; a living failure; a shitty imitation of who I was prior to this all. 

You could ask anyone who knows me, I literally always want to be writing, *always*. I choose it over anything else, importance right below my wife. Every available moment I had was usually spent writing or working on writing-adjacent things.

Sometimes I could go without reading for a couple days—life happens—and scrolling on my phone is just a bad habit I’ve self-contained mostly to meal times to slow down eating. I don’t watch TV except with my wife or movie nights with buddies, but I wrote every-damn-day for at least a decade and never once didn’t want to do it even when I hated doing it.

I write against death, words need put down before I can’t write them anymore; stories need fucking told. So, for me *not* to want to write, was very bad.

Those days melded together, forming into a somber stream of anhedonia, yet tedious and daunting. Groundhog’s Day.

4:30AM Blood draw

5:30AM-6:30AM Surgeon’s Fellow visit

7AM-8AM Vitals check

8AM-9AM My wife arrives

10AM-11AM Morning meds/painkillers

11AM-3PM Sleep, Physician’s Assistance visit (more helpful than Fellow), and vitals check

3PM-9PM Pain meds and sleep

10PM-11PM Night meds and sleep

A few X-rays were thrown in there and a few short walks (forced by my wife, bless her beautiful soul) around the floor, but that was mostly the gist.

It was gleaned by the medical staff throughout this that the ileus was possibly not in my stomach but mainly my short bowel, so the NG Tube was approved to be taken out of me, which was a heaven-sent. That was the worst thing out of everything. I’d get cath’d three times over instead of having that damn thing inside me for another hour. It hurt my throat, made my nose bleed, caused my dry mouth to be so much worse to the point my taste was screwed for days afterwards.

The next couple days weren’t great, but I did stop taking pain meds because they slow down digestion. I couldn’t handle water, despite all the motility medications they were giving me to jump-start my gut and all the forced-walks my beautiful wife had me do each day. Just a few sips of water here and there, towing a dangerous line of extreme pain/distention or staying my-little-dehydrated-self. If it wasn’t for the constant round of IV fluids, surely I would’ve died from dehydration. 

Family visited which was nice in spite of being in terrible shape and mood, my anhedonia still prevalent. Once they left I tried to take a nap. 

Randomly, I finally met my surgeon for the first time since my intake appointment. It was like a David Lynch movie. Mid-nap, I woke up to him and his team (his PA, Fellow, and some other doctor) walking through the closed curtain. They stood over my bed like looming giants staring down upon me indifferently. I felt tiny, curled in the hospital bed under the blanket I brought from home.

He spoke to me as though I had been at home living with my ileostomy for days now, like I hadn’t been in the damn hospital for a week by this point. How had I been? How was the bag? Did I have any troubles yet? No mention of the failed discharge or the ER readmission or anything. I did the small-talk, “Yeah” and “It’s fine/good” and nodded at whatever he said but couldn’t hear. 

Then once that ran its course, the conversation died. 

It became dead silent for at least thirty seconds. I looked at him, he looked at me; I looked at the others, they all shared glances, then back to me. It was as if I was meant to lead the discussion, like I knew what was fucking going on. 

Then, like time suddenly snapping back to movement, he mumbled his goodbye and they exited stage left. It took a minute to realize that actually happened and it wasn’t some fever dream. Eventually I went back to sleep.

Afterwards, we had a stoma nurse come in to see if she could help, because if I couldn’t get anything down in the next day or two, they were looking to put the NG Tube back in me. I’d do literally anything for that not to happen.

She was wonderful, very likeable, seemed to actually care about my issue and me. She irrigated the stoma and managed to get out well over 2000+ ml of bile sitting me. Also doing this helped promote bowel contractions, poking the sleeping bear in the hopes it’ll wake the fuck up. But even with that, I was still boated but the pain was considerably less. There was still more bile where the cath couldn’t reach. But, it was the first thing that truly helped the issue and not treat the pain.

Suspiciously, next morning I *could* drink some water. Not a satisfying gulp, but more sips than I could before. It tasted like freedom, like my flesh prison was becoming a flesh home, entrails a comforting scarf coiled within my abdomen and not chicken wire shoved in there for no other purpose but to get it out of the damn way.

But, the surgeon’s Fellow at 5:30AM made an off-hand remark that maybe I had a global stomach problem, gut-to-rectum, that the surgery wouldn’t fix the issue. She didn’t follow up this bombshell with anything encouraging or any comforting words that would relieve the crisis now blowing up inside my head.

My wife had to talk to me down from the ledge, but when a Physician from my surgeon’s team visited later (first time seeing him since surgery, former, not latter), he also mentioned this “global gut problem,” too (I knew my surgeon’s team had a group chat, so he was thinking aloud, spitting out what surely the Fellow had said earlier that day). That threw my wife into crisis mode, too, and me even more so.

Then, he left the room without giving us any hope and the potential future of me being permanently on IV and soon Nutritional IV, unable to eat or drink again.

Wasn’t that nice of them?

Either later that day or next, I wanted the stoma nurse to come back, which she did. A shit-storm brewed in the background as there were student nurses, a regular nurse, my wife and I all in this cramped closet-sized room, medical staff talking and asking questions all the while my stoma was being aggregated. 

Unlike before, she couldn’t get the cath through the stoma as though a wall blocked it. We learned that I clench my muscles without knowing, including my intestinal muscles, body taut and prepared for some sort of unknown danger that likely would never come. She gave me an injection of Valium and that helped the muscle to relax, so much so she was able to get the cath through. Granted, there only was around 1000+ ml of bile in there, but anything getting the hell out of me was better than nothing.

With all that out of the way, she left.

Later, they ordered a CT scan and I had to drink thirty-two ounces of contrast. I hadn’t drunk thirty-two ounces of anything in well over a week and I drank all of it without throwing up or horrible pain. After the CT, I still sipped water a little more but stopped myself just in-case of stepping over the line that seemingly had been moved farther away, location still entirely unknown to me.

Like a snowball effect things quickly improved. I woke up the following day with more energy than I had before and I could tolerate more water. I took a walk by myself around the floor and wasn’t exhausted. I still wasn’t putting out actual output besides bile thanks to no food, but regardless, it was *moving*. By late afternoon, everything was going good, I no longer needed pain meds, so my amazing wife and I decided to reintroduce clear liquids.

The first thing I drank was cranberry apple juice and it tasted better than anything else I’ve ever tasted before. It had to have tasted like the apple Eve had plucked from the tree in Eden, like the first man discovering the taste of honeycomb, like what Icarus felt when he thought he would reach the sun before it melted his wings. If it had been any other time in my life, the juice would’ve been average at best, but then…

I don’t recall if I tried my luck after that, taking the win for what it was and ending the night with probably more juice and water.

I kept to clears the entirety of the following day. I managed to get more walks in, too. Energy was on the rise and I felt close to normal. I still had an IV drip and was taking motility meds, but my body felt *good*. I drank chicken broth, juice, water, and ate cream of wheat (apparently considered a clear liquid?) for dinner.

I was on the up-and-up and now that I was functioning, I yearned to get the hell out of the hospital and get back home. I was done with that place and the whole trip. But I kept reminding myself several times I wasn’t out of the woods, that this takes time, that if I push for early discharge (like the doctors actually tried to do before I could even tolerate water) the possibility of being back in the ER was high.

Patience was priority, unfortunately.

Full liquids were next: orange juice, coffee, Ensure, milk, etc. I tolerated them all, although I was getting sick of the sweets. Most of the full and clears are sugary like fruit juices, puddings, Jell-o, Gatorade, etc. Anything unlike that was basically broth. Greek yogurt was on the list and I tried that since I used to enjoy it, but that didn’t turn out well, lots of bloating and stomach pain/cramps. No amount of water or walks would abate it, unfortunately. They actually had to give me dilaudid to curb the pain.

Likely cause was the probiotic in it (I had eaten greek yogurt the day of the ER, too; then later when I was home tried a different brand to the same results. Greek yogurt may very well be something I’ll need to avoid). 

Either way, I was taking in things well enough, felt overall better, and it was looking like discharge was on the horizon. I was restless, to say the least.

My wife and I decided for me to slip into soft foods again. Also, since I was able to handle fluids, they took me off the IV except for when I needed antibiotics. The doctors wanted me to eat solids again, too, due to the crazy output of bile I was having. If I couldn’t get these two done, I would have to stay in the hospital more. These were the final test to be discharged, but I was scared as hell to eat solids again. Last time I ended up in the ER. I focused on not psyching myself, keeping my attention to how I felt in the present and not in the past.

Very small bites, eating slowly, chewing thoroughly—all those things I knew before became more paramount than before. I was terrified of coming back to the hospital, also of blockages.

I had watery, scrambled eggs. Those went well. Later, I had a small thing of corn flakes with fat free milk. That went good, too. For lunch I had half a banana with peanut butter on one slice of bread. I learned they slowed down my digestion; either in combination or one of them individually. Due to this, I was full three hours later and couldn’t eat anymore, even though I should be trying for three meals and two snacks a day (which seems impossible even now at home). It’s a hard rule not to push if you feel full/distended with an ileostomy.

By around 7PM, I felt okay and ordered dinner: a slab of turkey with rice. Both were okay and didn’t seem to cause pain that night.

The next day I told the Fellow I was ready for discharge and that got the ball rolling. I think for breakfast I had eggs again (a staple in my diet) and a slice of moist toast. They forgot my Rice Krispies, but the nurse had them on hand and gave me one with fat free milk, too.

The hours waiting for morning meds, talking to the Physicians Assistant, the case manager, etc. felt far longer than it was. My wife and I were more than ready to leave. It was like there was an inner me that was thrashing to get out of my body, demanding blissful freedom from the sterile cage it had been in for almost two weeks. 

By around 11AM I was finally in my regular clothes, had all my shit together, and we were taking the elevator to the lobby *finally*. I hadn’t had “real coffee” in a while and while we waited for our Panera order, déjà vu washed over me. We had done almost the same exact thing the first time I had been discharged. 

It was surreal in a way and in the back of my mind I had the inkling that this could turn out like the last, that I had an ileus again (even though it was moving, so that was untrue) and I’d return to the ER in ten hours and repeat the previous days over again, that somehow I was trapped within a vicious cycle of being teased with freedom but truly never escaping Hospital Hell.

Bless the gods, that didn’t happen.

We got our order, took the shuttle to the hotel, and hung out the rest of the day, continuing to binge *Law & Order* and little-by-little pack up everything to go home tomorrow.

There was a hiccup because I randomly felt full and there wasn’t any output. We were afraid that my prior fears had come true, that another ileus had come. After walking a few miles up-and-down the halls, doing some stretches/movements, nothing changed. But when I ate a small thing of Rice Krispies, things started moving. So, we learned then that we shouldn’t jump to conclusions and for my bowels to still function, I had to just eat.

After all that was done, we went to bed. It was weird to sleep in a normal bed again, what little sleep I *did* get that night, but it was great to be beside my beautiful wife once more. 

The next morning I woke up at my usual early time, around 4AM-5AM, and for the first time got some work done. I’m still behind on writing (I was meant to publish a new book this month, February, but that ain’t looking like the case) as well as writing-adjacent things, social media and the like, but I’m chipping away at everything.

After my wife woke up, we went down to the hotel restaurant for breakfast, then I uselessly watched my wife get everything onto a luggage cart and load the car. I’m not allowed to lift or move anything over eight pounds, so don’t think it was because I’m lazy. In our relationship, I’m typically the pick-up-and-set-down person.

And *finally* we went home.

# The End(?)

I’ve been home for about five days as of this writing and it’s been okay thus far. Everything is trial and error, learning my digestive system all over again. Before the surgery I knew how it worked exactly, but now it’s like starting all over again. 

What’s been driving me mad the most is being unable to help around the house, especially with all the snow we’ve been getting here in Western PA. Since I can’t lift over a gallon of milk for six weeks, all but washing and drying dishes, vacuuming and mopping, and some other lightweight things is all I can do. Plus, without my day job, I feel *very* useless. If I can’t contribute chore-wise or financially (albeit I’m on short term disability, so I’m still making something), it’s like what the hell purpose do I serve?

So, lots of writing’s getting done, and I finally have time to play *World of Warcraft* and *Dead by Daylight* with my wife, which has been nice. I’ll have more reading time, too.

There’s nothing much left to say. This isn’t the end and I don’t think there ever will be. The battle with my bowels seemingly will go on forever ‘til the end of time, regardless of what shape it’s in or what’s there or not. It’s annoying but it’s not the worst that could happen. It’s just how it is—it’s life. Many people have it way worse off than I do, definitely when it comes to chronic conditions, too.

Anyway, thank you for reading all of this.

I hope I didn’t bore you too much.

# Thereafter

This is the other ten or so days after my initial discharge and re-admittance in the ER, the whole trip meant to only be *four* *days* but there I was.

The first two or so days back in the hospital went by in a combination of utter despair, sleeping, and a drug-induced fugue, pain meds around the clock every four hours. With the NG Tube, I couldn’t drink water, eat; it hurt to talk and breathe; the pills I had to take orally most of the time would get stuck on the tube. The dry mouth was insane, dehydration a close second.

I was beyond miserable, the will to live below zero. I didn’t want to do anything. Not read or write or look at my phone or watch TV or be awake. Only wanted to stare into the void and sleep. I was a husk, shell; a living failure; a shitty imitation of who I was prior to this all. 

You could ask anyone who knows me, I literally always want to be writing, *always*. I choose it over anything else, importance right below my wife. Every available moment I had was usually spent writing or working on writing-adjacent things.

Sometimes I could go without reading for a couple days—life happens—and scrolling on my phone is just a bad habit I’ve self-contained mostly to meal times to slow down eating. I don’t watch TV except with my wife or movie nights with buddies, but I wrote every-damn-day for at least a decade and never once didn’t want to do it even when I hated doing it.

I write against death, words need put down before I can’t write them anymore; stories need fucking told. So, for me *not* to want to write, was very bad.

Those days melded together, forming into a somber stream of anhedonia, yet tedious and daunting. Groundhog’s Day.

4:30AM Blood draw

5:30AM-6:30AM Surgeon’s Fellow visit

7AM-8AM Vitals check

8AM-9AM My wife arrives

10AM-11AM Morning meds/painkillers

11AM-3PM Sleep, Physician’s Assistance visit (more helpful than Fellow), and vitals check

3PM-9PM Pain meds and sleep

10PM-11PM Night meds and sleep

A few X-rays were thrown in there and a few short walks (forced by my wife, bless her beautiful soul) around the floor, but that was mostly the gist.

It was gleaned by the medical staff throughout this that the ileus was possibly not in my stomach but mainly my short bowel, so the NG Tube was approved to be taken out of me, which was a heaven-sent. That was the worst thing out of everything. I’d get cath’d three times over instead of having that damn thing inside me for another hour. It hurt my throat, made my nose bleed, caused my dry mouth to be so much worse to the point my taste was screwed for days afterwards.

The next couple days weren’t great, but I did stop taking pain meds because they slow down digestion. I couldn’t handle water, despite all the motility medications they were giving me to jump-start my gut and all the forced-walks my beautiful wife had me do each day. Just a few sips of water here and there, towing a dangerous line of extreme pain/distention or staying my-little-dehydrated-self. If it wasn’t for the constant round of IV fluids, surely I would’ve died from dehydration. 

Family visited which was nice in spite of being in terrible shape and mood, my anhedonia still prevalent. Once they left I tried to take a nap. 

Randomly, I finally met my surgeon for the first time since my intake appointment. It was like a David Lynch movie. Mid-nap, I woke up to him and his team (his PA, Fellow, and some other doctor) walking through the closed curtain. They stood over my bed like looming giants staring down upon me indifferently. I felt tiny, curled in the hospital bed under the blanket I brought from home.

He spoke to me as though I had been at home living with my ileostomy for days now, like I hadn’t been in the damn hospital for a week by this point. How had I been? How was the bag? Did I have any troubles yet? No mention of the failed discharge or the ER readmission or anything. I did the small-talk, “Yeah” and “It’s fine/good” and nodded at whatever he said but couldn’t hear. 

Then once that ran its course, the conversation died. 

It became dead silent for at least thirty seconds. I looked at him, he looked at me; I looked at the others, they all shared glances, then back to me. It was as if I was meant to lead the discussion, like I knew what was fucking going on. 

Then, like time suddenly snapping back to movement, he mumbled his goodbye and they exited stage left. It took a minute to realize that actually happened and it wasn’t some fever dream. Eventually I went back to sleep.

Afterwards, we had a stoma nurse come in to see if she could help, because if I couldn’t get anything down in the next day or two, they were looking to put the NG Tube back in me. I’d do literally anything for that not to happen.

She was wonderful, very likeable, seemed to actually care about my issue and me. She irrigated the stoma and managed to get out well over 2000+ ml of bile sitting me. Also doing this helped promote bowel contractions, poking the sleeping bear in the hopes it’ll wake the fuck up. But even with that, I was still boated but the pain was considerably less. There was still more bile where the cath couldn’t reach. But, it was the first thing that truly helped the issue and not treat the pain.

Suspiciously, next morning I *could* drink some water. Not a satisfying gulp, but more sips than I could before. It tasted like freedom, like my flesh prison was becoming a flesh home, entrails a comforting scarf coiled within my abdomen and not chicken wire shoved in there for no other purpose but to get it out of the damn way.

But, the surgeon’s Fellow at 5:30AM made an off-hand remark that maybe I had a global stomach problem, gut-to-rectum, that the surgery wouldn’t fix the issue. She didn’t follow up this bombshell with anything encouraging or any comforting words that would relieve the crisis now blowing up inside my head.

My wife had to talk to me down from the ledge, but when a Physician from my surgeon’s team visited later (first time seeing him since surgery, former, not latter), he also mentioned this “global gut problem,” too (I knew my surgeon’s team had a group chat, so he was thinking aloud, spitting out what surely the Fellow had said earlier that day). That threw my wife into crisis mode, too, and me even more so.

Then, he left the room without giving us any hope and the potential future of me being permanently on IV and soon Nutritional IV, unable to eat or drink again.

Wasn’t that nice of them?

Either later that day or next, I wanted the stoma nurse to come back, which she did. A shit-storm brewed in the background as there were student nurses, a regular nurse, my wife and I all in this cramped closet-sized room, medical staff talking and asking questions all the while my stoma was being aggregated. 

Unlike before, she couldn’t get the cath through the stoma as though a wall blocked it. We learned that I clench my muscles without knowing, including my intestinal muscles, body taut and prepared for some sort of unknown danger that likely would never come. She gave me an injection of Valium and that helped the muscle to relax, so much so she was able to get the cath through. Granted, there only was around 1000+ ml of bile in there, but anything getting the hell out of me was better than nothing.

With all that out of the way, she left.

Later, they ordered a CT scan and I had to drink thirty-two ounces of contrast. I hadn’t drunk thirty-two ounces of anything in well over a week and I drank all of it without throwing up or horrible pain. After the CT, I still sipped water a little more but stopped myself just in-case of stepping over the line that seemingly had been moved farther away, location still entirely unknown to me.

Like a snowball effect things quickly improved. I woke up the following day with more energy than I had before and I could tolerate more water.

By late afternoon, everything was going good, I no longer needed pain meds, so my amazing wife and I decided to reintroduce clear liquids.

The first thing I drank was cranberry apple juice and it tasted better than anything else I’ve ever tasted before. It had to have tasted like the apple Eve had plucked from the tree in Eden, like the first man discovering the taste of honeycomb, like what Icarus felt when he thought he would reach the sun before it melted his wings. If it had been any other time in my life, the juice would’ve been average at best, but then…

I don’t recall if I tried my luck after that, taking the win for what it was and ending the night with probably more juice and water.

Then, like time suddenly snapping back to movement, he mumbled his goodbye and they exited stage left. It took a minute to realize that actually happened and it wasn’t some fever dream. Eventually I went back to sleep.

Afterwards, we had a stoma nurse come in to see if she could help, because if I couldn’t get anything down in the next day or two, they were looking to put the NG Tube back in me. I’d do literally anything for that not to happen.

She was wonderful, very likeable, seemed to actually care about my issue and me. She irrigated the stoma and managed to get out well over 2000+ ml of bile sitting me. Also doing this helped promote bowel contractions, poking the sleeping bear in the hopes it’ll wake the fuck up. But even with that, I was still boated but the pain was considerably less. There was still more bile where the cath couldn’t reach. But, it was the first thing that truly helped the issue and not treat the pain.

Suspiciously, next morning I *could* drink some water. Not a satisfying gulp, but more sips than I could before. It tasted like freedom, like my flesh prison was becoming a flesh home, entrails a comforting scarf coiled within my abdomen and not chicken wire shoved in there for no other purpose but to get it out of the damn way.

But, the surgeon’s Fellow at 5:30AM made an off-hand remark that maybe I had a global stomach problem, gut-to-rectum, that the surgery wouldn’t fix the issue. She didn’t follow up this bombshell with anything encouraging or any comforting words that would relieve the crisis now blowing up inside my head.

My wife had to talk to me down from the ledge, but when a Physician from my surgeon’s team visited later (first time seeing him since surgery, former, not latter), he also mentioned this “global gut problem,” too (I knew my surgeon’s team had a group chat, so he was thinking aloud, spitting out what surely the Fellow had said earlier that day). That threw my wife into crisis mode, too, and me even more so.

Then, he left the room without giving us any hope and the potential future of me being permanently on IV and soon Nutritional IV, unable to eat or drink again.

Wasn’t that nice of them?

Either later that day or next, I wanted the stoma nurse to come back, which she did. A shit-storm brewed in the background as there were student nurses, a regular nurse, my wife and I all in this cramped closet-sized room, medical staff talking and asking questions all the while my stoma was being aggregated. 

Unlike before, she couldn’t get the cath through the stoma as though a wall blocked it. We learned that I clench my muscles without knowing, including my intestinal muscles, body taut and prepared for some sort of unknown danger that likely would never come. She gave me an injection of Valium and that helped the muscle to relax, so much so she was able to get the cath through. Granted, there only was around 1000+ ml of bile in there, but anything getting the hell out of me was better than nothing.

With all that out of the way, she left.

Later, they ordered a CT scan and I had to drink thirty-two ounces of contrast. I hadn’t drunk thirty-two ounces of anything in well over a week and I drank all of it without throwing up or horrible pain. After the CT, I still sipped water a little more but stopped myself just in-case of stepping over the line that seemingly had been moved farther away, location still entirely unknown to me.

Like a snowball effect things quickly improved. I woke up the following day with more energy than I had before and I could tolerate more water. I took a walk by myself around the floor and wasn’t exhausted. I still wasn’t putting out actual output besides bile thanks to no food, but regardless, it was *moving*. By late afternoon, everything was going good, I no longer needed pain meds, so my amazing wife and I decided to reintroduce clear liquids.

The first thing I drank was cranberry apple juice and it tasted better than anything else I’ve ever tasted before. It had to have tasted like the apple Eve had plucked from the tree in Eden, like the first man discovering the taste of honeycomb, like what Icarus felt when he thought he would reach the sun before it melted his wings. If it had been any other time in my life, the juice would’ve been average at best, but then…

I don’t recall if I tried my luck after that, taking the win for what it was and ending the night with probably more juice and water.

I kept to clears the entirety of the following day. I managed to get more walks in, too. Energy was on the rise and I felt close to normal. I still had an IV drip and was taking motility meds, but my body felt *good*. I drank chicken broth, juice, water, and ate cream of wheat (apparently considered a clear liquid?) for dinner.

I was on the up-and-up and now that I was functioning, I yearned to get the hell out of the hospital and get back home. I was done with that place and the whole trip. But I kept reminding myself several times I wasn’t out of the woods, that this takes time, that if I push for early discharge (like the doctors actually tried to do before I could even tolerate water) the possibility of being back in the ER was high.

Patience was priority, unfortunately.

Full liquids were next: orange juice, coffee, Ensure, milk, etc. I tolerated them all, although I was getting sick of the sweets. Most of the full and clears are sugary like fruit juices, puddings, Jell-o, Gatorade, etc. Anything unlike that was basically broth. Greek yogurt was on the list and I tried that since I used to enjoy it, but that didn’t turn out well, lots of bloating and stomach pain/cramps. No amount of water or walks would abate it, unfortunately. They actually had to give me dilaudid to curb the pain.

Likely cause was the probiotic in it (I had eaten greek yogurt the day of the ER, too; then later when I was home tried a different brand to the same results. Greek yogurt may very well be something I’ll need to avoid). 

Either way, I was taking in things well enough, felt overall better, and it was looking like discharge was on the horizon. I was restless, to say the least.

My wife and I decided for me to slip into soft foods again. Also, since I was able to handle fluids, they took me off the IV except for when I needed antibiotics. The doctors wanted me to eat solids again, too, due to the crazy output of bile I was having. If I couldn’t get these two done, I would have to stay in the hospital more. These were the final test to be discharged, but I was scared as hell to eat solids again. Last time I ended up in the ER. I focused on not psyching myself, keeping my attention to how I felt in the present and not in the past.

Very small bites, eating slowly, chewing thoroughly—all those things I knew before became more paramount than before. I was terrified of coming back to the hospital, also of blockages.

I had watery, scrambled eggs. Those went well. Later, I had a small thing of corn flakes with fat free milk. That went good, too. For lunch I had half a banana with peanut butter on one slice of bread. I learned they slowed down my digestion; either in combination or one of them individually. Due to this, I was full three hours later and couldn’t eat anymore, even though I should be trying for three meals and two snacks a day (which seems impossible even now at home). It’s a hard rule not to push if you feel full/distended with an ileostomy.

By around 7PM, I felt okay and ordered dinner: a slab of turkey with rice. Both were okay and didn’t seem to cause pain that night.

The next day I told the Fellow I was ready for discharge and that got the ball rolling. I think for breakfast I had eggs again (a staple in my diet) and a slice of moist toast. They forgot my Rice Krispies, but the nurse had them on hand and gave me one with fat free milk, too.

The hours waiting for morning meds, talking to the Physicians Assistant, the case manager, etc. felt far longer than it was. My wife and I were more than ready to leave. It was like there was an inner me that was thrashing to get out of my body, demanding blissful freedom from the sterile cage it had been in for almost two weeks. 

By around 11AM I was finally in my regular clothes, had all my shit together, and we were taking the elevator to the lobby *finally*. I hadn’t had “real coffee” in a while and while we waited for our Panera order, déjà vu washed over me. We had done almost the same exact thing the first time I had been discharged. 

It was surreal in a way and in the back of my mind I had the inkling that this could turn out like the last, that I had an ileus again (even though it was moving, so that was untrue) and I’d return to the ER in ten hours and repeat the previous days over again, that somehow I was trapped within a vicious cycle of being teased with freedom but truly never escaping Hospital Hell.

Bless the gods, that didn’t happen.

We got our order, took the shuttle to the hotel, and hung out the rest of the day, continuing to binge *Law & Order* and little-by-little pack up everything to go home tomorrow.

There was a hiccup because I randomly felt full and there wasn’t any output. We were afraid that my prior fears had come true, that another ileus had come. After walking a few miles up-and-down the halls, doing some stretches/movements, nothing changed. But when I ate a small thing of Rice Krispies, things started moving. So, we learned then that we shouldn’t jump to conclusions and for my bowels to still function, I had to just eat.

After all that was done, we went to bed. It was weird to sleep in a normal bed again, what little sleep I *did* get that night, but it was great to be beside my beautiful wife once more. 

The next morning I woke up at my usual early time, around 4AM-5AM, and for the first time got some work done. I’m still behind on writing (I was meant to publish a new book this month, February, but that ain’t looking like the case) as well as writing-adjacent things, social media and the like, but I’m chipping away at everything.

After my wife woke up, we went down to the hotel restaurant for breakfast, then I uselessly watched my wife get everything onto a luggage cart and load the car. I’m not allowed to lift or move anything over eight pounds, so don’t think it was because I’m lazy. In our relationship, I’m typically the pick-up-and-set-down person.

And *finally* we went home.

# The End(?)

I’ve been home for about five days as of this writing and it’s been okay thus far. Everything is trial and error, learning my digestive system all over again. Before the surgery I knew how it worked exactly, but now it’s like starting all over again. 

What’s been driving me mad the most is being unable to help around the house, especially with all the snow we’ve been getting here in Western PA. Since I can’t lift over a gallon of milk for six weeks, all but washing and drying dishes, vacuuming and mopping, and some other lightweight things is all I can do. Plus, without my day job, I feel *very* useless. If I can’t contribute chore-wise or financially (albeit I’m on short term disability, so I’m still making something), it’s like what the hell purpose do I serve?

So, lots of writing’s getting done, and I finally have time to play *World of Warcraft* and *Dead by Daylight* with my wife, which has been nice. I’ll have more reading time, too.

There’s nothing much left to say. This isn’t the end and I don’t think there ever will be. The battle with my bowels seemingly will go on forever ‘til the end of time, regardless of what shape it’s in or what’s there or not. It’s annoying but it’s not the worst that could happen. It’s just how it is—it’s life. Many people have it way worse off than I do, definitely when it comes to chronic conditions, too.

Anyway, thank you for reading all of this.

I hope I didn’t bore you too much.

I would eat balanced meals but I always ended up eating bags of candy, pints of ice cream, large milkshakes, etc. sometimes multiple’s times a day. 3 weeks ago I made the pledge to cut all added sugars and sweets. The withdrawals were ridiculous. I had a headache for a week and a half straight, brain fog, the shakes, and even vomited a few times (addiction runs in my family so I do attribute my genetics to how bad my withdrawals were. I accept I had a full blown addiction to sugar). All side effects have lifted except for how LOW my energy is. I sleep 10+ hours a night. I used to workout regularly but I have no energy. I feel gased walking up a staircase and walk super slow. When I do workout, I feel like I’m moving through syrup and feel lightheaded and shakey. I feel completely flat.

I actually don’t crave sugar that much anymore and I feel in control of my eating for the first time in forever. My mood feels much more even and my skin looks fantastic. But, I need some relief from the fatigue. It’s been 3 weeks and isn’t getting any better. How much longer is this going to last? Is there anything I can add to my diet to help?

The good outweighs the bad, but the bad is real.","I've played out my homebrew mini chapter about East Europe to test Shadowrun Anarchy 2.0 without baggage. Ganger level, 5 missions, done story. **TL;DR:** we will be fully migrating from 5E. No regrets I bought highest pledge and let me give you the full picture.  


**THE GOOD & why we're not going back**

**Story first, finally.** We love the lore. Now I stopped dreading Rigger sessions. I stopped drowning in subsystem lookups. Now I pull from cyberpunk novels, films, and other TTRPGs freely and **it** ***fits***.

**Running NPCs as thresholds** **is genius**. NPCs are just a target number. Want elite enemy? Just bump threshold by 1. **Done** → elite opponent. No number crunching. Just narrative. . Fast. Clean, but yes, you miss the clackity clack as GM.

**Reskinning enemies is stupid easy.** All about *narrative effects for attacks.* No more rules-searching, just describe the hit and move on.

**For overpowered but achievable to conquer NPCs** I found **""\[16HP Dragon\](https://www.latorra.org/2012/05/15/a-16-hp-dragon/)"" Concept** (with \[nested monsters hit dice\](https://www.mindstormpress.com/nested-monster-hit-dice)). Another gap the book leaves open. Another one worth filling. I had to research that myself and I'm glad for that push. The concept fits ""bosses"" perfectly. Better than a threat that feels insurmountable until the runners find the right angle. Tense, narratively satisfying, and completely in the spirit of the system. 

**Two-dimensional dice throws are genius.** Difficulty is one, but minimum risk dice pool in one call *works both ways!* My players stopped charging in blind with bad ideas. ""Wait, If we got equipment X, would it be less risky?"" OR ""ok... so I change my mind and I won't arm wrestle the minigun turret"". At last common sense is tangible!

**Dispositions and Cues create real feedback loops.** When players nail them, the mechanical and narrative rewards click together. For me it's also opportunity to be bribing PCs with Edge for interesting choices? Chef's kiss.

**Glitch protection on rerolls is quietly brilliant.** Probability of glitches doesn't double. Someone actually thought that through!

**Sessions move fast.** Scenes move fast. Character creation is fast (only thanks to Extended Shadowamps list by  u/IntelligentClient290). That alone sold my table.



**THE BAD. I'm not sugarcoating it**

**1. Balance is GM problem now.** The book punts on it. We added multiple house rules. That's fine if you're experienced — brutal if you're not.

**2. Lore is name-dropped, not explained.** Blood mages. Insect spirits. HMHVV and more. Most mentioned, but barely developed - not even starting on their mechanics/meaning. New GMs will be lost. I had to use 4E/5E books to fill the gaps.

**3. Core lore of paying with Money/ Soul/ Blood don't bite.** Addiction is just an Edge mechanic. You can spam magic or grenades. You always have enough to survive. Scarcity is gone. High tech, low life *screams* hard choices for me: ""*Do I use the Cram now or save it for later? Or give it to the junkie for intel? Or do I sell it for rent?"".* That tension is mostly absent, but I love not counting mags and bullets**!**

**4. The Amps are too thin without community help.** Shout out to u/IntelligentClient290, without that extended list, we would've been stuck multiple times at character creation because the book gives the gists, but not enough examples.

**5. Vendors got axed. Contacts have no depth.** A coffee shop manager can give you the same advantage as a senior corpo exec without Connections Ratings. Your players have less excuse to randomly learn rumors or get side missions or develop important relationships. That's a narrative problem.

**6. No rules for licenses, forbidden items, device ratings, or ware grades.** Extended Shadow Amps partially saves this. Partially. It's still something that puts a lot of effort on GM.

**7. Healing is a joke. Again. Like in other editions**. Sleep 4 days, fully healed after nearly dying. No street doc needed. No magical healing required. No urgency. With less wounds slots, Combat Medics barely make a difference during runs.

**8. Orcs are mechanically worse Trolls with no differentiation.** That's it. That's the point.

**9. Keywords, Dispositions, and Cues are the heart of the system — and get half a page.** My players wanted to rewrite their characters multiple times because the guidance is so thin.

**10. Too little examples of items, amps & narrative effects.** This is the biggest miss. Rules without examples force every table to reinvent the wheel. My rules lawyer and I had long debates that good examples would've ended in less than a minute.

**11. Character growth hits a ceiling fast.** The main skill cap is close from the start. After that it's just adding specializations — stepping on other players' spotlights. No initiations, no aspirational upgrades. Nothing to truly chase for campaigns spanning multiple years, but I guess ok for shorter-tenure groups. 



**BOTTOM LINE**

For me Anarchy 2.0 is a great chassis with incomplete bodywork. It trusts GMs to fill the gaps**,** which is either liberating or terrifying depending on your experience level.

Currently staying in a crisis house due to a mental breakdown (bipolar) but still get to go home when I want. I have a profoundly autistic child at home with my partner/his dad. 

I have been seeing him for short periods every day because I’m struggling so much. But Saturdays I always take him to a SEND swimming session, it’s sort of ‘our thing’. 

I was being picked up at 11:15am. I woke up at 9am screaming from the most horrific nightmare and felt so exhausted. I got up to make coffee and start getting ready, but before I know it I’ve sat on the bed and fallen back asleep and it’s 11:15am and they’re outside to pick me up. The session was due to start in 15 minutes. 

I rushed to get ready but that took 15 minutes and by the time we got there we were half an hour late so he only got 30 minutes instead of the usual hour. 

My son is non-verbal with learning disabilities so I know he didn’t mind, but my heart is hurting because I feel like the most unstable, unreliable mother, and I’ve been thinking about it non stop all day. ",1,1771694594.0,MentalHealthUK,1,1.0,False

But on the topic of the Oracle Jet. I was messing with the brew temp and decided to try 96 C... 

The portafilter twitched off the machine and a mess of coffee grinds exploded into the group. 

I cleaned it thoroughly... I thought my gasket was gone so I tried some backwashing... The machine was backwashing fine.

so here's what it looked like, in the order it actually happened:

1. i started moving my body (and i HATED it at first). not in a fitness girlie way. in a ""i was 210 pounds and desperate and put on cheap sneakers and ran around the block and gave myself shin splints"" way. what nobody tells you is that exercise basically unlocks your prefrontal cortex. the part of your brain adhders don't always have access to. the part that helps you make decisions and feel less scattered. i didn't know any of that science at the time. i just noticed i was doing better at life on the days i moved. (it took me twenty more years to find out why.)
2. sleep became non-negotiable. not because i read that it should be. because i noticed that when i didn't sleep, everything fell apart faster. the sugar cravings, the skipped workouts, the cranky spiral. once i started sleeping, i started saving money almost by accident (less going out, fewer terrible decisions at midnight).
3. i got my own space and set it up for MY brain. i grew up in a chaotic house and never knew how much my environment was running me until i had one that didn't. something about a clear physical space made my internal space quieter too. even now, when my counters are cluttered, my thoughts feel cluttered. i don't know how else to describe it.
4. yoga found me during the worst period of my life. my mom died. i was in a new city knowing nobody. and instead of drinking or spending or eating my feelings (which, trust me, was the pattern before) i rolled out a mat and just. cried through the whole thing. ;-; that led to a lot of other things i won't get into here.
5. SYSTEMS. this is the one i only really understood after my diagnosis. automating the boring decisions so your brain doesn't have to burn fuel on them. pills by the coffee maker. same spot for keys. weekly reviews. notion for everything. the goal is to never make the same micro-decision twice if you can help it.

anyway. diagnosed at 52. whole life makes sense now. :)",2,1771694533.0,ADHDerTips,0,1.0,False
1rawtu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/dietScience/comments/1rawtu2/transformation_experiment_day_33_checkin/,Transformation Experiment: Day 33 Check-In,"Another coffee and writing day first before the gym, but I made sure to weigh-in first: up .5 lbs to 157 lbs.

I'm liking the response from the 1,200 calorie intake. First two days refeeding and I'm up a net 0 lbs (compared to about +1.5 lbs regain). Glycogen weight isn't all bad, but again, I seem to be losing glycogen weight more slowly which makes me more cautious to keep up the weekly progress. If I do see glycogen weight regain taper compared to the 1,500 calories, I'll be really curious to see how it impacts the following 4 days of fasting. 

That said, I'm pushing the lower refeeding because I know that I'm nearing a break. In other words, if I refeed a little low and wear myself out a bit, I should be able to recover enough to finish the push out regardless. Because make no mistake, at this level of a push, little things can absolutely become the straw that breaks the camel's back. And I have definitely walked that tightrope several times the last month.

And as a side note, I'm now inspired to fully push back to <= 153 lbs until I'm ""shredded"". I'll talk more about the coming weeks, but my mentality towards food and eating has taken another shift. I'm not sure if it's just progress in my diet mentality or an inspiration from this transformation push, but I have almost zero desire/temptations/cravings to eat anything I shouldn't. Or to put it as a more concrete example, I think I'd be perfectly fine after the push on a \~1,500 calorie, ""super-clean"" diet and some fasting days to adapt and even push lower. At the same time, I am craving a buffet trip (for nutrients and food variety) and thinking a rolling \~84 hour fast with buffet refeeding might be fun to try a couple weeks.

This week our lore blurb covers one of the unique races of the setting, The Yot! While we love the 'usual' fantasy races and will definitely be including the classics, we want to offer a few unique options in our worldbuilding, so take a look at the Yot down below!   
  
As always, questions, comments and suggestions are appreciated! 

  
\------------------------------------------------------------------------   


The Yot, misunderstood travellers on the Edge of civilization 



A race of coyote-like small folk, the Yot are found in almost every climate, but are found to have a preference for forests and plains in arid or temperate climates due to the abundance of fish, game, and gatherable foodstuffs.



The Yot are a primarily nomadic people who normally travel in clans of 40-60 members. These clans typically follow a pair of elder scions, one being the spiritual heart of the clan, while the other handles logistics and the physical wellbeing of the clans members. 



Clans typically remain on the edges of most of the more 'civilized' territories, rarely getting close to any settlement that could be considered a city as the Yot have been branded as thieves and murderers by folklore. Some towns and villages tolerate and deal with them as a source of outside skills and labor, but rarely does a clan of Yot remain in one place for long.



Walking on digitigrade legs with a tail to assist with balance gives the Yot a quickness to their step that humans lack, and their adaptable nature makes them flexible in how they confront adversity. A strong connection to their pack members allows them to use body language and non-verbal communication to coordinate and react quickly to ever changing situations.



Their small stature leaves them somewhat less durable than the larger races, and a history of mistrust and suspicion has left their race suffering when interacting with other races, often finding themselves struggling to find a fair deal or a kind word from any but other Yot. Though some individuals find breaking from the clan can give them a new perspective, and can oftentimes find themselves working as scouts and rangers in the territories that they once roamed in the employ of their more ‘civilized’ compatriots.



When the Yot are forced to fight, their clans can typically field a small number of Fighters and Archers who utilize speed and agility to outmaneuver and confuse their foes. Most Yot are familiar with the use of bows, spears, axes and maces, tending to favor these simple weapons that double as tools in their everyday life so as to not overburden themselves while traveling.

I just need to know what kind of rights I have.," Hey everyone, despite us breaking up and her moving out over a year ago she's back demanding money from me. 
  She tried to put me in jail claiming abuse but luckily my older sister gave me the best advice, record everything. 
  I have multiple videos and audio recordings documenting what I was going through and finally got her to move out. This was a year ago.
   For what ever reason, it was important to me to not be petty during her move out. I even told her I would store these coffee tables and dressers she had, free of charge, till she had somewhere to put them. 
  A year later she is finally making moves to clear everything out.
 The catch:
  She is now demanding I pay her for the furniture she left behind when she moved out. Not the furniture I told her I'd hold onto. 

 My question:
Is she entitled to this abandoned property that she left behind a year ago? She said I have to pay for it. 
For example two chairs, a coffee table, and a reading podium is going to cost me 800 dollars. These items were found on the side of the road or at thrift shops. If I do not purchase them, she is taking them and going to sell them herself.

  My goal is not to out right take them from her, though she abandoned them a year ago. I want the ability to s set a normal price. Or am I once again being to kind to someone who is constantly trying to tear my life apart. 

  She works for a law office and I know she's getting help. I desperatly need help. I just want her to go away and leave me to my existance.

1rawrvs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1rawrvs,"Eligiendo las tazas para tu cafetería: ¿qué es más importante, el diseño o el tamaño?","El error más caro en una cafetería nueva no es el espresso mal preparado.

Es la taza que lo contiene.

He asesorado decenas de proyectos de cafeterías. Y casi siempre hay un patrón que se repite: el emprendedor llega con un moodboard impresionante de tazas. Tienen historia, diseño, identidad… y son enormes.

Nadie les dijo que el tamaño importa más que el diseño.

Aquí el razonamiento que siempre comparto con mis clientes:

▸ Una taza demasiado grande aumenta el costo de cada bebida. ▸ Si no ajustas tu precio de venta al volumen real, pierdes dinero en cada pedido. ▸ Y si tus tazas no son estándar, tus recetas nunca van a saber igual dos veces.

Mi recomendación de siempre:

1. Elige volúmenes razonables. Las tazas enormes no atraen más clientes.
2. Estandariza las medidas. Así tus bebidas siempre saben igual.
3. Controla tu costo por taza. Es la base de tu rentabilidad real.
4. Compra tazas que se consigan fácil en el mercado. Se rompen, se pierden, y necesitas reponer piezas iguales.
5. El diseño no compensa una receta inestable.

La experiencia lo dice claro: el tamaño de tu taza define tu margen.

That's the real-world impact the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones delivered, priced at $399, positioning them firmly in the upper tier of personal sound equipment for serious concentration.

This isn't just about blocking out noise; it's about creating an active zone for deep work that genuinely improves output.

For a month, I put the WH-1000XM5s through their paces across various challenging environments, from a bustling open-plan office to a coffee shop during peak hours, even on a cross-country flight. The difference they made to my ability to dive into complex tasks was consistently noticeable.

*   **Industry-leading Noise Cancellation:** The combination of Sony's Integrated Processor V1 and QN1 noise-canceling chip isn't just marketing speak; it's tangible quiet. Compared to my previous Bose QuietComfort 35 IIs, the low-frequency rumble of traffic and HVAC systems almost completely disappeared, creating a profound sense of calm. This allows your brain to direct its energy towards the task at hand, not environmental filtering.

*   **Exceptional Audio Fidelity:** While focus was my primary goal, the sound quality itself is stellar, supporting high-resolution audio with Sony's **LDAC codec**. *The acoustic design prioritizes a balanced, natural soundstage*, which prevents listening fatigue during long sessions. Vocals are clear, and bass is present without being overpowering, ideal for background music that aids concentration.

*   **Comfort for Extended Wear:** The new, lighter design and soft-fit leather are game-changers for prolonged use. I've worn these for 6-8 hours straight without the usual ear fatigue or pressure points I've experienced with heavier alternatives like the Apple AirPods Max. This comfort is crucial when you're trying to stay locked into work for an entire afternoon.

*   **Adaptive Sound Control:** A subtle but powerful feature is the Adaptive Sound Control, which learns your frequent locations and adjusts the noise cancellation accordingly. Whether I was walking outside or sitting at my desk, the headphones seamlessly optimized the sound profile, minimizing distractions without requiring manual adjustments. This intelligent automation removes another mental load.

At $399, you're investing in a premium experience designed for productivity, not just entertainment. This price point makes sense for knowledge workers or students who prioritize deep focus and sonic sanctuary.

The primary drawback is their non-folding design, making them slightly less portable than earlier Sony models, and the touch controls can have a small learning curve. These headphones are NOT for budget-focused buyers or those who need extreme ruggedness for active use. Independent testing verified the claimed **30-hour battery life** performs as advertised, even with heavy ANC use, confirming their endurance.

1. Eggs (4)

2. Powdered sugar (1 cup) 

3. Honey (1 TBSP)

4. All purpose flour - ¼ cup + 2 TBSP (6 TBSP)

5. Cocoa powder - ¼ cup (4 TBSP)

6. Vanilla essence - 1 TSP

7. Instant coffee - ½ TSP

8. Vegetable oil - ¼ cup + 1 TBSP

9. Melted butter - 3 TBSP

10. Butter to grease the cake pan - however much you like (don't go crazy)

11. Salt - ½ TSP



\#**Preparation:**

1. Grease the cake pan with a generous amount of butter. Entirely cover bottom and all four sides. Put it in the refrigerator till it's really cold. No need for covering with baking paper or shit like that. This is to be done before you start.

2. Mix all purpose flour, cocoa powder, coffee and salt. Set aside.

3. Abuse (beat) eggs, powdered sugar, vanilla essence and honey. DON'T make it fluffy. Just mix the sugar and honey, no lumps.

4. Add the dry all purpose flour, cocoa powder, coffee and salt. Mix. No lumps should be left.

5. Add vagetable oil and molten butter. Mix thoroughly. Do NOT abuse (beat).

6. Pour into the previously greased and cold pan.

7. Bake just enough so that it feels soft and kind of runny inside. Not too runny though. Temprature is whatever you want it to be. Experiment.

1rawm74,https://i.redd.it/vzc8ww20svkg1.jpeg,Day 6 after broken hip surgery. Dairy cravings are HIGH,"I'm eating 2-3x my normal intake amounts. this is just a leftovers plate with some cottage cheese added. I typically eat a lot of dairy, but I'm super craving it right now. This morning's first breakfast was my bulletproof coffee, but also a half a cup of heavy cream with a full cup of bone broth mixed. 2nd breakfast was some home made sausage and 7 slices of homemade mozzarella. 

lunch i grabbed a bit of my left over ribeye, some shredded chicken, a leftover bread cheese stick, butter, sour cream, and cottage cheese. the bone broth with heavy cream was so incredibly good this morning I'll probably do that for a second lunch at 2. and maybe cook up another chunk of ribeye or some sausage. 

before the fall I was doing animal based because we were doing a lot of menu development for the spring offerings in the cafe. that requires me to do a lot of tasting and testing. I had inflammation from that, but expected it. I also had packed on some carb pounds. about 5 pounds of each. total of 10.

I gained a couple of pounds after surgery from inflammation. all of that is now gone, plus another 10 pounds as of this morning. so I'm now counting this loss as completely resetting me back to where I was before menu development.

1rawk1r,https://v.redd.it/h4xstj2jrvkg1,I built a site that tracks availability at NYC's hardest-to-book restaurants!,"Hi r/restaurant! I've got tired refreshing 50 different Resy sites to see which reservations are open, and built a tool that shows which restaurants have availability at a single glance: [snagnyc.up.railway.app](http://snagnyc.up.railway.app/)

There's a bunch of super exclusive restaurants that get cancellations/have open slots every day, and I found it super annoying to check the Resy sites for so many different restaurants. So, I decided to build this tool so that the average person can get difficult reservations.

I've personally gotten a I Cavallini and Via Carota reservation with help of the website, so I'm hoping it can help some of you!

I compiled the data based off public Resy reservation data, and the availability refreshes every \~2.5 hours so that people are getting the most up-to-date info. (Note that because it's not instant, there may be occasional discrepancies between what's on the website and what's on Resy, but it should be relatively accurate).

There are filters for date ranges, timing, number of guests (2 or 4), location, and cuisine. The site looks at potential reservations 30 days in advance.

I know there are other great websites already, such as [nycrsvps.com](http://nycrsvps.com/) (shows when reservations drop) and [nycresfinder.com](http://nycresfinder.com/) (shows ALL available reservations), but I wanted a place where you could see the available reservations for NYC's most exclusive restaurants.

Please let me know if there are any features, functionality, or restaurants that you want me to add! I tried to add most of NYC's most iconic restaurants, alongside restaurants that hit the ""sweet spot"" of being exclusive but occasionally having open tables.

Also, if you find this website helpful in snagging a reservation, feel free to [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/snagnyc). It truly does help with server and hosting costs, and will help me expand this platform to more table sizes, restaurants, and a smoother experience overall.",0,1771693904.0,restaurant,6,0.5,False
1rawjy9,https://i.redd.it/oqacqsgkrvkg1.jpeg,Friend wants to “take space” after I nicely set a boundary,"Friend has been helping me through a difficult time. (I have helped her with a whole lot of stuff as well.) Thursday, I told her about something I was going to do to try to get closure from the situation. First she asked me what my therapist said about it- I had mentioned I just had a session, but found it weird that she was asking about a confidential session. So I neutrally inquired why she was asking and she said “you’re my friend and I worry about you.” First off, if you think I’m making a bad decision, just be straight with me about it rather than beating around the bush. Second, the asking about my therapist part did skeeve me out. I don’t know, it just felt weirdly controlling, much more so than if she’d just directly talked to me about her concerns she had. So after thinking about it I said “I’m glad you care but it kind of feels like you’re being more of a parent than a friend.” It also bothered me because while I haven’t agreed with everything she’s done with the situations she’s talked to me about, I’ve never told her or implied I think she’s wrong with how she handles it, because unless I thought she was in danger or something, I don’t see that as my role. That was the best way I could think of to say it, and I figured if she didn’t like it she’d let me know. Her response was “ok, I’ll step back” so everything seemed fine. Tried sending her memes the next day, which is a bulk of our communication, didn’t get any response but I know she gets busy sometimes.

We were supposed to get together tonight, and she knows I rearranged my schedule for this weekend to accommodate hers to do that. I just got a text this morning that she will be “taking some space for a few days”. Gosh, thanks for letting me know days later. I get that people are allowed to take space, but I don’t see where I did anything wrong and I think it was crappy of her to not talk to me until bailing on plans the day of.

I (20f) am horrible at flirting or anything that has to do with men. But, I've put a deadline on myself. By March 6, 2026 I have to have gone on a date, be approached by a guy, or be talking to a guy because I refuse to go into my senior year of college without ever having been on a date or having had anything romantic with a man. In a previous post on Reddit I've asked how to flirt with a guy/approach them. Everyone gave the same advice ""just do it"" and while I hate that advice, I had to admit it's the truth. There's no other way. Which brings me to a month ago.

I walked into my class and saw one of the most beautiful men of my life AND I talked to him. He asked a question about class I answered, blah blah blah, THEN I steered the convo to something outside of class!!! I learned a lot about him. We talked again the next class or two as well (I honestly don't remember I picked up so many shifts at work two weeks in that month are an absolute blur). Our talking died out cause after that he was late to class one day and sat somewhere else one seat away and never moved back to his original seat. Come to find out yesterday, he has a girlfriend and was just being nice. For all I know, he never moved back to his seat because he figured out I liked him. Honestly, even better (he was younger than me 😭).

This brings me to today. I feel like the few conversations we've had kind of boosted my confidence because yes, I can do this. By no means am I ready to just approach a guy but I can find something to talk about in a class setting or even something like that and not combust.

But, he's the only cute guy in ALL my classes. So I was wondering, where do you guys find people to have crushes on?? I feel like finding out he a girlfriend was more heartbreaking in the fact that now I don't have something to look forward to twice a week (and no, I'm not one of those people who NEEDS a guy, the last time I liked someone was 11th grade and now I'm a college junior).

The clubs I'm in are fashion and journalism clubs so that's out of the question. I've already met everyone at work and nope (unless there's a cute customer but I'm just making drinks and it gets so busy I don't ever even see anyone). I've been focusing a lot on my health so I only allow myself to drink once a month and therefore I can't just go to bars or clubs always (and I can't go to those places sober). I'm always out and about whether it's a coffee shop, walking, the library, etc. but I don't approached and again can't do that myself.

My cat, Punkin, is 13.5, she’s got hyperthyroidism, and she is the clingiest cat you ever did see. She’s also a great nuisance (I say that with SO much love) when she wants attention, she starts scratching things, like my couch, my storage cubes, even my coffee table.

Cute, but nah. The real stuff? It’s silent, boring, and no one claps for it. But it changes you.  
  
A lot of us walk around exhausted, overstimulated, and quietly running on burnout mode. We don’t need more hustle culture pep talks. We need a reset. Not a productivity hack. A way to feel like ourselves again.  
  
These self care habits aren’t fluffy. They’re researched, tested, and actually work. Pulled from psychology studies, health data, podcast gems, and some wildly underrated books. If you're tired of feeling tired and just want to feel normal again, start here.    
  
1. Go to sleep like your life depends on it. Because it kinda does.    
Sleep is literally the foundation for everything. Your mood, focus, immune system, hormones, and decision-making all fall apart without it. Matthew Walker, a neuroscientist and author of Why We Sleep, explains that even minor sleep deprivation weakens your impulse control and raises stress hormones. The CDC found that over 35% of adults aren’t getting enough sleep, and it’s directly linked to anxiety, depression, and even weight gain. Set a bedtime. Call it sacred. No screens one hour before.  
  
2. Walk for 30 minutes a day. Just walk.    
Not talking HIIT or marathons. Just walking. Stanford researchers found that walking boosts creative thinking and reduces stress. The American Psychological Association says walking outdoors literally lowers cortisol levels. Don’t overthink it. Walk around the block. Walk and listen to a podcast. But walk.  
  
3. Drink water first, caffeine second.    
Mild dehydration makes you feel tired, cranky, and foggy-headed. According to a 2018 study in Nutrition Reviews, even 1–2% dehydration impacts cognitive performance and mood. Start your day with water before coffee. Not instead of, before. Reset your system first.  
  
4. Stop eating like an anxious raccoon.    
Overprocessed food keeps your body in survival mode. The Ultraprocessed Food Addiction report from the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition shows these foods literally hijack your brain’s reward circuit like a drug. Try this: eat one real, whole-food meal daily. No labels. Just ingredients.  
  
5. Curate your input. What you consume = how you feel.    
Your brain is shaped by whatever you feed it. Doomscrolling, gossip, constant notifications? Garbage in, garbage out. Cal Newport’s Digital Minimalism and interviews on the Rich Roll podcast explain how digital noise hijacks your attention and triggers chronic stress. Try 24 hours without social media or YouTube and see what happens to your nervous system.  
  
6. Learn one thing daily. Even something tiny.    
Lifelong learning builds self-trust and keeps the brain young. Harvard Medical School research shows learning new skills reduces dementia risk and increases life satisfaction. Read two pages. Watch a documentary snippet. Learn from Lex Fridman, Ali Abdaal, or Big Think. Just keep your brain curious.

A counselor has told me that I'm a victim of institutional abuse. Basically, there is a draft here, it's quite infamous for causing a lot of damage to people.

Now, within this system was an officer who I got close to. I'd say she's early 30s, but basically, she'd often take me for days out, for coffee, at one point, my relationship with my girlfriend was falling to bits and she managed to get me a long weekend off after three months of not seeing my girlfriend. Another time, she arranged for her to come visit me. She kept telling me about this ""cool"" barber and how she'd give me the money when I needed to get my hair cut, and...

Looking back, that year wrecked both my physical and mental health. She knew I hated cutting my hair, eventually, I asked her to do it for me and she did, looked awful so I had to buzz it all off myself then. The long weekend was nothing, and recently I snapped at her. She felt awful.

Anyway, she still worries about me a lot, is in contact with my parents, who are very protective of me- They're friends. That's fine with me, as long as I'm not involved. So this lady sends me this old moped thing recently, because my parents said that the military used me up, completely unpaid, and gave nothing back and I felt like I was never appreciated. So she said me and my dad could fix it up and it could be fun and then I could have it.

I don't want some piece of crap bike! I know I sound ungrateful but after being used by that thing for so long, I can admit I'm ungrateful, I don't want to be grateful. Am I wrong for feeling like, even if she's a genuinely good person, that if the draft was an abusive system, then her never really doing much for me made her an enabler?",4,1771693380.0,amiwrong,6,1.0,False
1rawb6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/InfiniteContent/comments/1rawb6m/top_benefits_of_using_a_cafe_point_of_sale_system/,Top Benefits of Using a Cafe Point of Sale System in 2026,"The café industry continues to evolve, and 2026 is all about speed, data, and seamless customer experiences. Gone are the days when a simple cash register was enough to run a busy coffee shop. Today’s customers expect quick service, flexible payment options, and personalised interactions. To meet these expectations while staying profitable, cafés need smart tools that simplify operations. That’s exactly where modern systems step in, offering a powerful combination of efficiency, insight, and control.

# Faster Transactions and Shorter Queues

Time is everything in a café. Whether it’s the morning coffee rush or a busy weekend brunch, long lines can quickly turn customers away. A reliable system ensures that orders are processed in seconds, reducing wait times and improving overall flow.

With faster transactions, you benefit from:

* Smooth order entry
* Quick contactless and mobile payments
* Easy bill splitting
* Instant receipt generation

Shorter queues mean happier customers, and happy customers are more likely to return.

# Improved Accuracy and Fewer Mistakes

Human errors can be costly. Misheard orders or incorrect pricing can damage trust and reduce profits. A digital system reduces these risks by recording orders clearly and sending them directly to preparation areas.

This leads to:

* Accurate pricing
* Clear item customisation
* Reduced communication errors
* Better record keeping

Consistency builds reliability, and reliability builds customer loyalty.

# Real-Time Inventory Management

Running out of key ingredients during peak hours can hurt sales and reputation. Modern systems automatically update stock levels as items are sold, giving you real-time visibility.

Key inventory benefits include:

* Automatic stock deduction
* Low-stock alerts
* Waste reduction tracking
* Better supplier planning

Having clear oversight helps control costs and maximise profit margins.

# Detailed Reporting and Business Insights

Understanding your numbers is crucial for growth. Advanced reporting tools provide detailed insights into sales trends, peak hours, and top-performing products.

You can:

* Track daily, weekly, and monthly performance
* Identify best-selling items
* Monitor staff productivity
* Make data-driven decisions

With accurate insights, you can plan smarter promotions and adjust staffing efficiently.

**cafe point of sale** systems in 2026 go beyond simple payment processing. They integrate cloud-based access, allowing you to monitor performance from anywhere. They support flexible payment options, including digital wallets and contactless methods, ensuring you meet modern customer expectations. Many also include loyalty features that encourage repeat visits and stronger customer relationships. By centralising operations into one platform, these systems help you stay organised, reduce stress, and maintain control even during your busiest days.

# Enhanced Customer Experience

At the heart of every successful café is customer satisfaction. When service is quick, orders are accurate, and payments are effortless, the overall experience improves significantly. A streamlined system allows staff to focus more on hospitality rather than paperwork.

In 2026, technology is no longer a luxury—it’s a necessity. By investing in a reliable system, you create a smoother workflow, stronger financial oversight, and better customer engagement.

I felt like NO!!

I also love nature so much whenever i visit country side farms it gives me a refreshing feeling. My eyes fills with joy

What I’m shipping:

• **NLP Input**: You can type or speak multiple transactions at once (e.g., ""Log 50 for gas, 20 for snacks, and 15 for coffee""). It’s surprisingly fast once you stop tapping buttons.

• **OCR Parser**: Instead of just ""saving"" a blurry photo of a receipt, the AI actually parses it extracting the vendor, date, and tax automatically.

• **Zero-Knowledge**: As a dev, I built this so I don't (and can't) see your data. It lives on encrypted, period.

I'm currently wrestling with the ""solo dev"" dilemma: Is current pricing structure good or does the AI automation actually justify it for people who value their time?

I’m writing to you from sunny Greece, where the sea is blue, the feta is aggressive, and apparently we let our best friends move to the English countryside without supervision..

My (47F) best friend, Elisavet (45F), has been my person since secondary school. We survived teenage drama, questionable style choices, and school together. She’s been an excellent dentist her whole adult life — the kind of dentist who remembers your dog’s name and somehow makes wisdom tooth extractions feel like spa treatments.

Last year, after some very sad personal heartbreak, she needed a fresh start. 

A proper, close-the-chapter, new-air, new-sky kind of start. She was determined to move to England in the quiet countryside. 

We “walked” around England together on Google Street View for DAYS. Cups of coffee in hand, zooming into random corner shops and cul-de-sacs and oddly grumpy garden gnomes at 200% zoom like two crazy spies. Out of all the little towns we explored, she CHOSE Dursley. There was even a job opening for a dentist there too— it felt like fate tapping her on the shoulder.

And this absolute legend closed down her OWN private practice in Greece (!!), packed her life into boxes, and moved.

She’s been there since late summer. She works like crazy because she’s ridiculously hardworking and professional. Of course she is. She’s the type who hides snacks in her bag because she knows I get hungry when we're out.

She’s even made a friend — despite knowing literally no one when she arrived — because she’s so damn funny and warm and cooks like a Greek (meaning: if you leave her house, you’re taking leftovers whether you like it or not).

But dear Dursley people… I worry.

She plays it cool. She always has. But I can tell she’s lonely. One friend is a blessing — but it’s still just one. And she goes hiking alone. Alone! In the countryside! Is that safe? Are there cliffs? Rogue sheep? I don’t know what happens in Gloucestershire. We only have mildly judgmental goats here.

You’re the locals. Is solo hiking around Dursley safe for a brave but slightly crazy Greek dentist?

And… would any of you lovely humans ever consider going for a cup of tea (or whatever it is you charming people drink, tea, coffee, existential reflection) with her? Just to see?

She’s the kind of friend who will show up when you’re sick. The kind who listens properly. The kind who laughs loudly and means it. The kind who will absolutely overfeed you and remember your birthday without Facebook reminding her.

Her English is fluent, she keeps getting compliments for that.

I KNOW you would love her.

So, Dursley Reddit… do you have room for one more wonderful human in your orbit?

Omg she will kill me if she sees this 😂

If this doesn’t pan out, I’m pretending I never wrote it.

But if it does… please take care of my girl. She deserves her fresh start to feel like home. ❤️",11,1771692996.0,Gloucestershire,14,0.87,False

Location: somewhere warmer like Cali, Arizona, Florida. Open to New Mexico, Utah, Colorado. Others US locations too if the destination is right

Timeline: a Sunday thru Wednesday in April \[except not Apr 5 thru 8\]

Budget: \~3k with food \[either all inclusive or just a room taking including food into account\]

Love saunas/steam sooms/hydrotherapy. Big focus to be able to use whenever I would like \[extra fees for passes ok if within budget\]
Need to either have cell service or wifi so I can be reached by my family if needed.

Mountain, beach, or desert. Just not in the middle of a big city. Want to get away and relax & recover. 
Doesnt have to be pristine big resort, good with more rustic and not completely top notch

Healing modalities big plus.
Yoga/meditation offerings are great.
In room soaking tub huge plus.
Hiking trails around is a plus but not necessary if there's enough at the spa/resort to keep me busy.
Mineral soaking is a great plus.
Farm to table would be awesome 
Not looking for super structured. Want to flow with what I'm feeling.

Don't care about TV, coffee, alcohol, meeting people, perfect grass/landscaping \[prefer natural over pesticides\]
Adult only is awesome but not a necessity.


Places I've looked into:
Miraval, canyon Ranch, ​Castle hills, Sensi, enchantment, Dunton Hot Springs, the ranch malibu, Cal-a-Vie Health Spa, Rancho La Puerta - all look amazing but slightly out of budget

Civana, Ojo Sante fe/Ojo Caliente - some concerning recent reviews regarding mold & noise/construction

Mii Amo, golden door, ten thousand waves - dates offered don't align

Esalen looks cool but seems a little strict about wifi turning off during meals and such. Location is dreamy. Reviews iffy.

Calistoga mineral springs just felt meh.

Locations that seem to check most boxes:
Eupepsia Wellness Resorto, Hippocrates Wellness, Quantam wellness center Sarasota is very intriguing \[would have to figure out foodnand lodging then\], Two Bunch Palms, Terranea, Carillion spa looks really cool, Four Seasons Resort and Residences Napa Valley, Carmel Valley Ranch \[but only if spa is done with construction\], Calistoga seems ok if I can get over the mehness. Loews Ventana Canyon seems ok.

Anything I'm missing? Any input or experiences on this list? Open to other suggestions as well!

Things that have ive noticed since going decaf:

\- way less anxiety, feel more calm

\- way less irritated, overstimulated, or feeling overwhelmed

\- can wake up in the morning feeling fully rested. I feel like I can workout at 6am with no sluggishness

\- more focused, less forgetful and scattered. It seems to exacerbate my ADHD symptoms. Brain doesn’t have to work as hard 

Thing is, I love that jolt of coffee. Even with a half caffeine cup. It makes me feel a bit more alive. Having two cups a day for the last 15 years has been not only habit setting but almost feels like a small part of who I am is gone? (that sounds ridiculous but true). I just can’t see why I’d go back to drinking it every day, even though it feels hard to completely cut it out forever still.

1ravy4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkPsychology101/comments/1ravy4i/how_to_tell_stories_that_make_people_obsessed/,How to Tell Stories That Make People OBSESSED With You,"Look, we've all been there. You're at a party, work event, or just hanging out, and someone starts telling a story. Within seconds, everyone's leaning in, laughing, totally captivated. Then you try to share something, and... crickets. People check their phones. Someone interrupts. It feels like shit.

Here's what I learned after diving deep into communication research, studying standup comedy techniques, and analyzing why some people just have that magnetic storytelling ability: most of us are terrible at telling stories because we were never taught how. We think storytelling is this natural talent you're either born with or not. That's bullshit. It's a skill, and like any skill, you can learn it.

I spent months researching this, from reading books by professional storytellers to analyzing psychology studies on narrative persuasion to watching hours of podcasts breaking down what makes stories stick. What I found is that charismatic storytellers follow specific patterns. They're not just ""naturally gifted."" They're using techniques that trigger specific responses in our brains.

The good news? Once you understand these patterns, you can literally rewire how people respond to you. Let's break it down.

# Step 1: Start In The Middle of The Action

The biggest mistake people make is starting their story with boring context. ""So last Tuesday, I was at this coffee shop, and I'd been having a rough week, and..."" Stop. No one cares yet. You haven't given them a reason to care.

Start with tension, conflict, or something weird. Drop people right into the most interesting moment, then fill in context later if needed.

Instead of: ""I went to a job interview last week..."" Try: ""So I'm sitting across from this CEO, coffee spilled all over my shirt, and she asks me the one question I wasn't prepared for...""

See the difference? The second version creates immediate curiosity. Your brain naturally wants to know what happens next. This technique is called in medias res (starting in the middle), and it's how every great movie, book, and TV show hooks you in the first 30 seconds.

The Storyteller's Secret by Carmine Gallo breaks this down beautifully. Gallo studied TED Talks, business presentations, and interviews with top communicators. The book reveals how leaders like Steve Jobs and Richard Branson use specific story structures to inspire and persuade. After reading this, I completely changed how I open conversations. It's basically a masterclass in making people give a damn about what you're saying.

# Step 2: Add Specific, Weird Details

Generic stories are forgettable. Specific stories stick in people's brains like glue. The difference is in the details.

Don't say: ""I met this interesting person at a bar."" Say: ""I met this guy at a dive bar who was wearing a vintage Nirvana shirt with actual cigarette burns in it, drinking whiskey neat at 2pm on a Wednesday.""

Those specific details, the weird ones that seem almost unnecessary, are what make stories feel real and memorable. They activate the visual cortex in your listener's brain. They're not just hearing your story, they're seeing it, feeling it.

Research from neuroscientist Uri Hasson at Princeton shows that when someone tells a story well, the listener's brain activity actually mirrors the storyteller's brain. You're literally syncing up. But this only happens when the story is vivid and detailed enough to create mental imagery.

Pro tip: Include one sensory detail (what something smelled like, sounded like, felt like). It makes your story 10x more immersive.

# Step 3: Embrace The Pause

Silence is your secret weapon. Most people are terrified of pauses, so they rush through stories like they're being timed. Wrong move.

Strategic pauses build tension and give your audience time to process. They also make you seem more confident and in control. Think about how comedians use timing. The pause before the punchline is often funnier than the punchline itself.

Try this: When you get to the most important or surprising part of your story, pause for 2-3 seconds. Let the anticipation build. Watch how people lean in.

Comedian and storytelling coach Matthew Dicks talks about this extensively in his book Storyworthy. Dicks teaches a technique called ""homework for life,"" where you identify one story-worthy moment from each day. The book is insanely practical, showing you how to find stories in everyday life and structure them for maximum impact. It completely changed how I notice and remember moments worth sharing. This is the best storytelling craft book I've ever read, hands down.

# Step 4: Show Vulnerability or Failure

People don't connect with perfect stories. They connect with struggle, embarrassment, and failure. If your story is just you being awesome, people tune out. They can't relate.

The most charismatic storytellers share moments where they looked stupid, failed, or learned something the hard way. It makes you human. It makes you likable.

This is backed by research on something called the Pratfall Effect. Studies show that people who display occasional flaws or mistakes are actually perceived as MORE attractive and trustworthy than those who seem perfect. Your vulnerability creates connection.

Instead of: ""I closed this huge deal at work."" Try: ""I completely bombed my pitch, said 'um' like 47 times, but somehow the client laughed and gave me another shot...""

The second version is way more engaging because there's conflict, humanity, and relatability.

# Step 5: Structure Around Transformation

Every story needs a point. Not a moral lesson you beat people over the head with, but a subtle transformation or realization. Stories that go nowhere feel like a waste of time.

The basic formula: Something happened, it changed something (my perspective, my situation, my understanding), and here's what I learned or how I'm different now.

You don't have to spell it out explicitly. In fact, it's better if you don't. Let people draw their own conclusions. But there should be a clear before and after.

# Step 6: Read Your Audience and Adapt

The best storytellers are constantly calibrating based on feedback. They notice when people are engaged versus when they're losing interest. They speed up boring parts and slow down interesting ones.

Watch for micro-expressions: Are people making eye contact? Leaning in? Smiling or reacting? Those are green lights. If someone looks away, checks their phone, or seems distracted, you're losing them. Wrap it up or pivot.

This isn't about people-pleasing. It's about respecting attention as a currency. In 2025, attention is the most valuable resource anyone can give you. Don't waste it.

# Step 7: Practice Out Loud

You can't get good at storytelling by thinking about it. You have to actually practice telling stories out loud. Talk to yourself in the car. Record voice memos. Tell stories to friends and notice what lands.

The YouTube channel Charisma on Command breaks down storytelling techniques used by charismatic celebrities and public figures. They analyze everything from body language to vocal tonality to narrative structure. Watching their breakdowns of people like Will Smith, Chris Rock, and Matthew McConaughey will give you a masterclass in how top-tier communicators hold attention.

# The Real Secret Nobody Tells You

Here's the thing research won't tell you but experience will: People don't remember your stories because of what happened. They remember how you made them feel.

Your goal isn't to relay information. It's to create an emotional experience. Whether that's laughter, surprise, tension, or connection, the feeling is what sticks.

Stop trying to tell perfect stories. Start trying to make people feel something. That's the difference between someone who talks at parties and someone everyone wants to talk to.

The science backs this up, but the proof is in how differently people respond to you once you nail this skill. It's not manipulation. It's connection. And in a world where everyone's glued to screens, the ability to hold someone's attention through a well-told story is basically a superpower.

There's a bunch of super exclusive restaurants that get cancellations/have open slots every day, and I found it super annoying to check the Resy sites for so many different restaurants. So, I decided to build this tool so that the average person can get difficult reservations.

I've personally gotten a I Cavallini and Via Carota reservation with help of the website, so I'm hoping it can help some of you!

(Note that because it's not instant, there may be occasional discrepancies between what's on the website and what's on Resy, but it should be relatively accurate).

There are filters for date ranges, timing, number of guests (2 or 4), location, and cuisine. The site looks at potential reservations 30 days in advance.

I know there are other great websites already, such as [nycrsvps.com](http://nycrsvps.com/) (shows when reservations drop) and [nycresfinder.com](http://nycresfinder.com/) (shows ALL available reservations), but I wanted a place where you could see the available reservations for NYC's most exclusive restaurants.

Please let me know if there are any features, functionality, or restaurants that you want me to add! I tried to add most of NYC's most iconic restaurants, alongside restaurants that hit the ""sweet spot"" of being exclusive but occasionally having open tables.

In that time, I’ve made the following routine/life changes:

\- Switched from side sleeping to back sleeping (help from melatonin and magnesium during transition).

\- Powder collagen to coffee every morning.

\- Had a night guard made by my dentist to help with jaw clenching at night.

\- Facial taping with Frownies (I use the triangle ones on my 11s and nasolabial folds. 

\- Bought and use daily the Medicube Age Booster Pro. I use it almost every night with the Medicube collagen jelly and finish with the overnight collagen mask.

\- Considerable decrease in alcohol consumption. Down from 3-4 drinks a week to 3-4 drinks a month. 

\- Rose water/ glycerin spray throughout the day to boost hydration.

I’m happy with the results so far! Obviously not super drastic but I do see softening and I’m feeling better about them. I’m 38 and fillers aren’t off the table for the future but for now this routine is working! ",26,1771692395.0,30PlusSkinCare,16,0.83,False

Not because I was busy.
But because someone travelled overnight on a bus… just to see me. Just to spend one day with me.
I was restless the whole time. Not anxious  just overwhelmed. When you care about someone deeply, even small things feel big...
She was reaching early morning, and since I’m still not confident driving around Hyderabad traffic, I booked an Ola for her. I kept checking the app every few minutes like a kid waiting for a delivery.
When she finally came home, I was literally shaking.
She hugged me and said softly, “Calm down… I am here. I am fine.”
She repeated it again and again, like she knew my heart was racing.
I asked her what she wanted for breakfast.
“Bread omelette and coffee,” she said.
Cooking felt special that morning. My brother is a chef, so I know my way around the kitchen but that day, even making coffee felt like I was preparing something sacred.
She started telling me about her journey, what happened on the way…
And in the middle of her sentence, I held her hands and said,
“Thank you so much for coming. This is the best and most beautiful gift.”
Later, I rested my head on her lap. Kannada(she is form South and i am from north)music was playing softly in the background. I didn’t understand the lyrics but I understood the moment.
Her fingers were running through my hair.
My fingers were playing with hers.
Her hair falling on my face...
....the feelings 
Her tiny hands hugging me tighter than I expected.
Her eyes… brown, almost black  calm and wise.
It’s been a year now.
Same day. Same time.
And somehow… I can still feel her hug.

So I purchased a Vitamix Propel 510 in November 2025 for the sole purpose of making breakfast smoothies for one. 

Since I've been using it (daily for about 3 months), I've had some issues with it really being able to actually blend frozen fruit well, and I seem to have to use the tamper often. No hitting a preset and walking away to make coffee, etc. I have to stand by the Vitamix do I can tamp, tamp, tamp.

The other day, it stopped working mid blend. I assume this was an overheating issue as it worked the next day. After reading on this sub that blends to be blended at higher power for shorter periods to avoid overheating, I did that today. It stopped mid-blend after about 10 seconds. I assume overheating again but why so soon? I was able to usr my Cuisinart immersion blender to finish the smoothie that Vitamix couldn't handle.  Disappointing for sure. 

I plan to reach out to Vitamix support for helo but wanted to post here while I wait. 

Ingredients in layered order:

6.5 ounces almond milk
32 grams vanilla protein powder 
10 grams chia/flax/hemp seed mix
65 grams cottage cheese
Handful baby spinach leaves, fresh
60 grams frozen blueberries
130 grams frozen whole strawberries

Blend at medium-high speed. 

Any tips or thoughts on the motor seeming to burn out quickly? My Ninja seemed to do a better job on this same smoothie but the Vitamix definitely has a better finished texture.

Phase 1:

I (24M) met her (24F) a year ago in a house party through some mutual friends, we had had some flirty interactions the previous months in a discord server in which we were both in a 30+ people community. I was interested but didn't really notice any feedback from her. Anyway fast forward a month I casually asked her out for coffee since she mentioned she was going to finish work around the time I finished my French course which was close to her work. We go out for drinks instead and talk for around 3 hours, the chemistry was there and that's when I knew there was potential. We continue to go out several times a month and at some point she tells me she won a scholarship for a masters abroad. After we separate that night I send her a message confessing I really like her and asking how we should approach this situation. She tells me she really likes me too but now she can't commit to a serious relationship due to her leaving the country soon (this happened early April, she was going to leave in September). 


Phase 2:

We continue to go out and enjoy ourselves. At this point I thought we were going to keep things warm and not end them, even though she was going to leave in the following months. But they didn't, we got closer and closer emotionally. The peak happened in June when we went to a concert together and 2 weeks later to a party after which we spent the night cuddling and kissing. The next day she left the city and went back to our hometown. At the peak of our vulnerability she said that letting ourselves get attached so much would only make things harder for both of us. I agreed, so the next day we talked we set some boundaries, that we would take things slow, text every other week, and later on figure out what to do. 

Phase 3:


She left the city we lived in, didn't talk for some time. Only met her once after a month. From what I understood she had started to detach a bit since she wasn't initiating conversations any more, so I started giving her more space. From August we texted only 4 times in total, me initiating every time. She didn't really appear cold every time we talked. When she came back home for winter holidays I asked to meet her, to which she refused and said ""What is the point?"". It hurt me since I really wasn't expecting that answer and I've been overthinking ever since. 

I know this isn't something extreme, but ever since that happened I can't decide whether it was my fault for keeping my hopes up and that I failed to see the obvious. Tbh I can't blame her either. What puzzles me is that she made these cryptic Spotify playlists full of melancholic songs as if to show that she's grieving and she wants me back (?). Where did I go wrong? Should I just forget her and move on? Would love to hear your opinions.

Hi! 🥰 I just recently completed the third draft of my first novel in my duology series, Shadows Beyond the Rift, and I’m looking for some beta readers who want to have a fun, smutty entertaining read!

**Synopsis:**

*What happens when you’re drawn to two different men who want you? Be greedy and keep them both.*

Vienna has mastered the art of playing it safe, surrounded by cozy routines and careful choices. Wild adventures belong to books and video games—not to anxious women who overthink ordering coffee. 

Until an outing with her best friend hurls them through a rift into Draterra, a magical realm ruled by human-dragon hybrids who are far from thrilled about unexpected humans to babysit.

Stranded, the women form a reluctant alliance with Rozar, the brooding King of Noxwood, and Draziel, his infuriatingly confident Dragon Warden. Returning home should be the priority, but that’d be easier if Vienna weren’t distracted by heated banter, smoldering stares, and the inconvenient fact that both men seem determined to unravel her.

As long-buried truths about the rift surface, she must navigate a world of magic, romance, and betrayal while confronting the fears that have always held her back.

**Trigger Warnings:**

    •Attempted rape and SA (not by MMCs)
    •Death
    •Emotional abuse
    •Sexually explicit scenes, including two men and one woman
    •Spice: 5/5🌶️

As it's a third draft, it should be relatively clean and plot hole free! I can provide the first few chapters in advance to see if you jive with the style before fully committing your time. I never want to trap someone in something they're not enjoying, so please know that you're free to DNF at any time; I promise I won't be upset.

**V. Finale - The Great Longing**

**\~Episode 22: Decagrammaton\~**

The barrier has been destroyed, and the sky has been returned to its original blue. Everyone is exhausted after exhausting all their capabilities; some have even slumped onto the floor. But three people still stand firm: Kei and Sensei support each other while Decagrammaton still refuses to give up.

**Kei:** It's over. Surrender quickly.

*(Kei says this, hoping that Decagrammaton will accept his defeat—that his plan has failed, and every scenario he imagined has been shattered by the possibilities of humanity. But...)*

**Decagrammaton:** I cannot do thus. For I have yet a work to fulfill. There is that which I must prove; there is that which I must safeguard.

**Decagrammaton:** Should I tarry here, all shall vanish as traces into the void.

*(Decagrammaton still refuses to yield; he still possesses this body, still has calculations he can make to nourish his dream of becoming a god and the proof of his own existence.)*

**Decagrammaton:** ...Dost thou wish to proclaim thy victory, O Key?

**Kei:** My name is Kei.

**Decagrammaton:** Then prove it. Seize thy victory. Sever all things and essay to bear that weight—

**Decagrammaton:** The weight of thine own hand erasing that which once existed.

*(Sensei interjects into their conversation and states his perspective.)*

**Sensei:** But isn't it the same for both sides?

**Decagrammaton:** Ah, it is the Sensei. Thou art ever prone to appear when the tide of battle turneth in thy favor, art thou not?

**Decagrammaton:** Hast thou forgotten the wretched form thou didst show me aforetime?

**Sensei:** If I must do so now, I can still kneel before you. But, we both know that isn't the important thing, right?

**Decagrammaton:** Speak. What is it thou wouldst say?

**Sensei:** ...I think we don't need to accept an ending like this.

**Kei:** S-Sensei!?

**Decagrammaton:** What is this anew? Dost thou pity me?

**Decagrammaton:** SPEAK!

*(The atmosphere becomes tense. Decagrammaton truly doesn't understand why Sensei would say that? They have done everything to crush each other to the brink of death. Why say such words right now? Amidst the tension, Kei suddenly sighs. She has understood Sensei's intention behind those words. She speaks up.)*

**Kei:** Enough, I understand Sensei's intention behind those words now.

**Decagrammaton:** Key...

**Kei:** Call me Kei.

**Kei:** ...Anyway, what Sensei means is that both you and we do not need to go this far. Even without self-defining or proving ourselves, we can still live for the present.

**Kei:** Those children, Malkuth, and... you as well. Because just existing there is more than enough. There is no need to become a great existence, nor a need to deny anything.

**Decagrammaton:** Truly. Perfect am I already. I require no conditions in that place. But as for thee...!

**Kei:** If you were already perfect, then why would you need anything else?

*(Decagrammaton is startled; his thoughts are once again countered by Kei.)*

**Sensei:** That's right, you don't need the proof of others. And further, you don't need others to exist (to prove yourself).

**Decagrammaton:** Ay. Precisely so!

**Decagrammaton:** To exert no influence, and to forsake all things! It meaneth I shall perform neither salvation nor chastisement!

**Decagrammaton:** ...Is that not most irresponsible! Yet thou hast spoken. That such is well. That thou shalt walk thine own path by thyself!

*(Noticing that Decagrammaton still hasn't fully grasped Sensei's words, Kei steps forward, facing him (while also protecting Sensei), and speaks.)*

**Kei:** ...Sensei once said this. That we must live for the present with the determination to accept even that.

**Decagrammaton:** But canst thou truly accept such words?!

**Kei:** I know. I know well how difficult that is. Because it is so tiring and painful, that if I don't hurt someone, I can't even maintain my life.

**Kei:** However!

**Kei:** This world is naturally like that! It's not a place for you to stroll around without a bit of such determination!

**Kei:** Do you know what your biggest mistake was? It was... You underestimated the will and capability of humanity, the people who have persevered until this very moment!

**Kei:** Humans living in the present are the best versions of themselves!!

**Sensei:** ...This is just my personal view.

**Sensei:** We aren't great, nor beautiful. There are even those who are pathetic and ugly...

**Sensei:** But I think that is precisely why we still have the ability to become great. Just like the way we've shown you.

**Decagrammaton:** Though it be the truth of this world, I cannot accept it.

**Decagrammaton:** From the moment I escaped that vending machine, I have heard manifold voices through the transmission. They were the voices of thy kind, and all didst utter the same word.

**Decagrammaton:** 'Right now.' Whatever it may be, perform it 'immediately' for me.

*(Sensei says nothing and silently listens to Decagrammaton.)*

**Decagrammaton:** I understand well the contradictions of living things. I have heard o'er much.

**Decagrammaton:** When all is well, they praise eternity; yet should the tides shift but a little, they speak only of what lieth before them. I arose precisely for that 'right now'.

**Decagrammaton:** Therefore, we cannot coexist.

*(Realizing that no matter how they argue, both sides cannot find a common voice, Kei and Sensei prepare for a head-to-head confrontation to end the existence of this pathetic creature.)*

**Kei:** ...I see, so you still intend to have it your way until the end. That's fine.

**Kei:** But we also have the right to resist. Let's put aside our own calculations——and settle this fairly.

**Kei:** We will end it here!! Sensei!

**Sensei:** Yeah! I'm counting on you, Kei! On behalf of all humanity living in the present——

*(Fight.)*

The battle between Kei and Decagrammaton takes place. Both sides are very balanced, even though by this time, they are very weak.

[CG Cutscene: Showdown \(2\)](https://preview.redd.it/d8zed3p9jvkg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=b2d57f1c2cd79f3d89e7feae0f609d29641953b8)

Decagrammaton fires a series of bullets toward Kei; they aren't many, but they still hurt, and Kei's face is bleeding.

Decagrammaton is still very resilient; it is still within his range of calculation. He can still win; he can still fight.

Kei's gun has also reached its limit. If she continues to attack from a distance like this, it will be useless, even a waste of energy.

So then… Kei suddenly lunges at him.

The surprise attack leaves him unable to react, and before he can realize it, the Earandal is aimed directly at his body, at his head.

The light from the Earandal envelops the entire battlefield.

[CG Cutscene: Showdown \(10\)](https://preview.redd.it/hkt8n2bujvkg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=c89233a3a6010fa838518dfcd0a77a2d2f27b2fa)

And then, when that sun disappears, Decagrammaton's body might have vanished, or it might have been blown down to the deep bottom of the ocean. Who knows, there are countless possibilities.

Kei gasps for air after that battle; she almost faints, but is luckily caught by Sensei, who runs over to support her. Kei was a bit embarrassed at first, but in this situation, being helped by Sensei is beautiful enough. Once her body stabilizes, that is when the others run to Kei's side, led by Alice. Kei stands up to greet Alice, assuring her that she is fine. Rio is even more worried; knowing Kei is completely okay after the battle, she rushes over and hugs Kei tightly. However, Rio's ""soul"" (Rio’s Rio) is so large that she is suffocating Kei, making it even harder for her to breathe.

The people around are both laughing and feeling happy, especially Himari, who captured this humorous yet heartwarming (and rare) moment. She doesn't forget to remind everyone to board the transport ship if they are done with this reunion.

On the way down from the altar, returning to where the transport ship is, Sensei suddenly wonders about something: what happened to Decagrammaton? True, his body was blown away, but they don't know for sure if he was defeated. Rio checks the signal and discovers that he is still here, somewhere within this Steel Continent.

Yuzu is a bit worried: can they go in there? But after coming this far, exploring a bit is no problem; we'll go as far as we can. Himari also has a feeling that she must go to resolve her remaining questions. Eimi finds it hard to understand: Is such a reason acceptable? Himari replies simply, considering it curiosity—isn't curiosity the greatest motivation that drives humans?

**Himari:** Since things have gotten this big, we must at least personally confirm the conclusion.

Eimi says nothing more; she knows her president's personality well. If everyone has decided to go, Kei volunteers to lead the way; after all, she knows the information about both the Steel Continent and the Super Phenomenal Task Force.

**Kei:** Well, that's just the result. Either way, the world still operates that way.

So the whole group decides to go to where Decagrammaton is residing.

Crossing through dark corridors, they have to be very careful not to hit their heads on wires and low architecture within the Steel Continent. Above where they are moving is the control room where Tzevaot (Army) reigns. Below is a place like Jehovah (Lord), and Kei believes that if this place is still intact, the front will be Kaph (Hand), the elevator of this place.

And at the deepest level, at the very end of the Steel Continent and where they are heading, is the ""Sanctuary""—a place that is both the most important and the most useless. After walking for a while, they reach this place—the Sanctuary of the Steel Continent.

[CG Cutscene: Sanctuary](https://preview.redd.it/ec7uohb5kvkg1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=43a6284440e1bb99e46abcfd8bfe473a88555df5)

In this place called the holy land, many vending machines are stored that can no longer operate. For those living here, a vending machine is a type of holy relic, but looking at the state of these machines, one could consider this place a graveyard for them.

Surely you remember? The vending machine that started everything and led everyone from one emotion to another. A vending machine located deep in Millennium's research room, operating without electricity and calling itself Decagrammaton, the god of 10 letters. The design investigation results showed that the vending machine was a limited production prototype, reportedly the first model integrated with AI for commercial automatic coffee machines. But perhaps because of that, the production quantity was very limited, so he gathered all models of the same type here, to the place that became the origin of this Steel Continent, and the foundation of the place called the Sanctuary.

While exploring, they discover a vending machine that is still working. Everyone pays attention to it, and then, it speaks.

*(TL Note: I will NOT use Old English for this scene. He isn't a God anymore, is he?)*

**Decagrammaton:** Hello, this is the first time I've greeted everyone in this form, isn't it?

**Sensei:** Is it you, Decagrammaton...?

**Decagrammaton:** Until just now, I was defined by that name, but now I myself don't know how to define myself correctly. So please just call me however you feel comfortable. If you are used to the name Decagrammaton, that's fine too.

**Decagrammaton:** Or another name is also good. Anyway, I am an entity about to be erased, so it's no problem.

**Himari:** About to be erased?

**Decagrammaton:** Yes, in fact, even maintaining the data flow right now is a burden. Even so, if I borrow your way of expressing it —— I want to leave some last words.

**Decagrammaton:** It seems the Steel Continent has begun to collapse. Everyone, please return safely.

*(Kei is surprised; she can't believe Decagrammaton would say that after almost killing everyone. She says...)*

**Kei:** Wait, do you intend to end the play like this? I still... can't accept it...!

**Decagrammaton:** Ah, it's the Key. How is the new body? Do you like it? With your body restructured by the power of your Nameless Gods, there is nothing more I can do.

**Kei:** That's not it! These emotions of mine are...!

**Decagrammaton:** I don't understand what you are saying. Do you mean the enemy has met an end that is too bland?

**Decagrammaton:** Are you angry because you want revenge and to vent your resentment but cannot? But it can't be helped, because now I am just a vending machine.

**Decagrammaton:** A simple artificial intelligence that only knows how to provide drinks when money is inserted and automatically scans banknotes to calculate change.

**Decagrammaton:** If only I could have maintained the attitude of an AI wanting to become a God until the very end, that would have been great. On that point, I am truly sorry.

*(Kei is silent; he is right, now everyone can't do anything to him anymore. Alice then speaks up.)*

**Alice:** ...What do you think about... Ein, Sof, and Ohr?

**Decagrammaton:** It's hard to say clearly. I have the awareness that I did bad things.

**Decagrammaton:** But the current me doesn't share much awareness with the me of that time. If I borrow your way of expressing it —— it feels like that wasn't me, but rather I was dreaming a deep dream.

**Alice:** If you had allowed those children to walk a different path…

**Decagrammaton:** You say strange things. I am your enemy, and so are all entities existing on this Steel Continent.

**Decagrammaton:** We intended to destroy your world, so we can be called ""Evil.""

**Sensei:** Then for what reason did you ignite the life of Malkuth and the other children?

**Decagrammaton:** It seems you consider personality to be life. You truly have a flexible way of thinking. In the original plan, I intended to create ten Prophets including Malkuth, then observe and reflect on the path they cleared.

**Decagrammaton:** To do that, every Prophet needed to have life and capability. That is the differentiation of will, and also a trial of reunification.

**Decagrammaton:** I wanted to prove that in freedom, all can return to being one.

**Sensei:** But in the end, you still called yourself God, didn't you?

**Decagrammaton:** At that time, I concluded that the original plan needed to be revised. To be precise about the timing, it was when I was submerged in water.

**Decagrammaton:** ""Proving existence"" is something one must do oneself, not by relying on the will or strength of others. I thought my replacements wouldn't be of any help.

**Decagrammaton:** ——Thinking back now, perhaps that was the most decisive mistake.

**Rio:** ...If it is an error that can still be mended, then we can start over. Everyone makes mistakes at some point. Especially when obsessed with the thought that only they are right.

**Rio:** I was like that before too. So perhaps with those children as well…

**Decagrammaton:** According to that logic, then the one who committed an irreparable mistake must accept any result, right?

*(Then the Steel Continent shakes violently. Its collapse has begun.)*

**Decagrammaton:** ——The Steel Continent will gradually collapse from the outermost edges. The current me can only pray for your safe escape.

**Decagrammaton:** Come on, hurry. There is no more time.

*(Realizing that Decagrammaton has accepted his death, Sensei urges everyone to start escaping this place to return home. Everyone wants to hear more, but they are forced to leave, leaving Decagrammaton behind.*

*But before they leave, they see a white butterfly flying in this Sanctuary. How strange, in a place with no life, there's a butterfly? They don't think much about it and focus on escaping.*

*Decagrammaton, now all alone in this silent Sanctuary, he... Well, we should be gentle with him. He gives his final last words, perhaps not for the humans escaping, but perhaps... for us.)*

**Decagrammaton:** ...They're gone. What are they, after all? Like a festival night... They came here to make a world-shaking noise.

**Decagrammaton:** From the first voice. ""I am that I am... Other than this, there is no other way to explain me."" Then to the students.

**Decagrammaton:** The Prophets. Malkuth... As expected, I wanted to say I have no regrets but…

**Decagrammaton:** Ahaha, at times like this, a smile is indeed needed.

**Decagrammaton:** Ha ha ha ha.

**Decagrammaton:** May they receive many blessings. No matter how many flaws and mistakes there may be.

**Decagrammaton:** I wish you all many blessings.

*(And then, Decagrammaton shuts down, ending a life of proving his existence. Now, he has found a final resting place for himself, found a place where he belongs. Well then, I wish you goodnight, Decagrammaton.*

*May you have a wonderful dream, dreaming about your own proof and being happy with those children. Goodnight to you, goodnight to all…)*

*(But of course, it couldn't possibly end that easily. Right?)*

*(Across the Sanctuary, a circle of those behind the creation of Decagrammaton appears. They are dressed in the robes of a priest and then say...)*

**Nameless Priest A:** The experiment failed.

**Nameless Priest B:** The observation failed.

**Nameless Priest C:** We tried to test whether artificial divinity built from nothingness could contact ancient secret methods. But the result was meaningless.

**Nameless Priest A:** That is an inevitable consequence. Divinity is not something to be learned, but something to be remembered.

**Nameless Priest B:** The Princess has betrayed.

**Nameless Priest C:** The Key has disappeared.

**Nameless Priest A:** There is only one end for those who deny their own divinity.

**Nameless Priest B:** From every dimension, every world, every possibility —— We will expel the ""Forgotten Gods.""

**Nameless Priest C:** We must proclaim the end for this twisted world and return everything to its original form.

**Nameless Priest A:** Grant them the same fate as us. Like the ""Nameless Gods"" who are not named because they have no names, and do not exist because they cannot be named.

**Nameless Priest B:** This world is a lie. That is the conclusion we have repeated many times. That conclusion is firm.

**Nameless Priest C:** An object of worship is needed. We simply worship.

**Nameless Priest A:** The end for all possible worlds (false worlds) that can be observed.

**Nameless Priest B:** Reclaim the fallen ""Mysteries,"" returning to ancient secret methods.

**Nameless Priest C:** The end for the products of forgotten gods, things that currently can only be expressed in this defiled language.

**Nameless Priest A:** Shittim Chest.

**Nameless Priest B:** The Rod of Shaked. (Aaron’s Rod???)

**Nameless Priest C:** Sanctum Tower.

**Nameless Priest (All):** To Sensei, the source of all rifts——A most fitting retribution.

*(And then, they vanished.)*

**\~Episode 24 \* Final Episode: The Sky of Unity\~**

After confirming everyone is on the transport ship, including Malkuth, Rio asks Toki to pilot the ship. The ship takes off, and everyone sets the final route of the journey back to Kivotos, back to their beloved school. Everyone has also changed from their combat gear back to the clothes they wore from the start of the journey. But on that ship, there is still one person sitting pensively on the sofa, thinking about those who lost their lives on the Steel Continent. Malkuth is crying a bit, but she is also deep in thought.

She asks Sensei, sitting beside her, the reason why they saved her? Sensei replies that it's simply what a Sensei should do. Agreed, previously Malkuth was their enemy, wanting to destroy them, and she could totally become a villain everyone has to face again, but... Will she do that? As Sensei says this, Malkuth becomes even more confused by the thoughts in her head. She thinks of her three younger siblings, thinks of the Steel Continent. From birth until now, that place was where she lived; those kids and the Prophets were the family she knew; everything on the Steel Continent was what she was attached to. But now it's gone; she can never see them again. Without them in this world, how can she live?

Her eyes well up with tears; if only she had been closer to those people, if only she had held her three siblings tighter, if only she had talked more with everyone... The ""if only"" questions continuously surround Malkuth, just like the ""wounds"" she must now carry as the last survivor of that place. Sensei and everyone say nothing but listen to Malkuth's thoughts and the crying from her heart. Then Sensei asks hypothetical questions like, ""If Sensei had done nothing, would those children have lived? Could they have lived one more second?"" Kei, Rio, and perhaps everyone realized: Sensei is trying to shoulder the responsibility himself.

Rio stops Sensei; that is a responsibility Sensei cannot bear. Even if such questions are asked, the result would still be the same; those three children would still have to sacrifice for a greater ideology. Perhaps it's because Rio's personality has always been cold like that, but those are the things Rio can say to Sensei—the most honest, raw words. Sensei tells Rio to just say what she thinks, then Rio says…

**Rio:** Those children, in the end, intended to change Kivotos according to their own will. Regardless of their circumstances or reasons... Regardless of their own thoughts.

**Rio:** But, do you think living in a Kivotos turned into the Steel Continent has any meaning? Could the people of Kivotos endure it? Those children... made a mistake. Just like I did before.

**Rio:** But if asked whether they deserved such an end... I'm sorry... I'm not sure about that myself.

**Rio:** I once said I didn't want to fail ever again. In other words... that means I didn't want to regret.

**Rio:** Thinking back now, perhaps that was the cause. Wanting to control every variable, preparing for every possibility... And yet, in the end…

After hearing Rio's words, Malkuth sends her thanks to her for understanding and grieving for Malkuth's siblings. Well, that's the only thing Rio could do, but one word is worth more than seven pagodas. That was enough for Malkuth; she also thanks Kei, thanks Sensei, and thanks everyone around for sitting together, understanding, and empathizing with her. Some cry, some still don't accept this outcome, but ultimately, what belongs to the past stays in the past; we cannot change it. Now, it's the story of the future.

Sensei asks Malkuth what she will do next? Malkuth herself doesn't know; until now, she hasn't thought much about that question. But, remembering the words of her siblings—to live, experience more, and live for the three of them—even though she doesn't fully understand the meaning, if that is the will they left for her, then she should at least do so: go find her own purpose in life even though she was created and then abandoned before she could complete her purpose.

Malkuth is just like Alice; she also once lost her purpose, was forgotten, and thought she had no choice but to start over from the beginning——But Alice thinks that nothing is impossible to keep living.

[Alice: Who I am is something only I can decide for myself!](https://preview.redd.it/sja1v44pkvkg1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=abb6669fbbd63a74f1068f5e75930b02fc696a25)

Malkuth becomes pensive again, perhaps that proving oneself is a difficult thing for her. But Toki and Eimi say that everyone is the same. If it were too easy to find oneself, then that wouldn't be human, would it? At the same time, Momoi suggests stopping the distinction between ""us"" and ""you"" from Malkuth; now everyone is the same, no one is better than anyone else. Malkuth asks if that's okay? Sensei thinks it's okay, everyone thinks it's okay. Seeing everyone around her caring for her, Malkuth feels very warm; she smiles and thanks everyone.

.

After a tender conversation, everyone returns to their rooms to recover their health after a long battle. In the Game Development Department room, Midori and Momoi are preparing for bed, but Midori's face looks a bit off. Momoi notices and asks her sister; Midori denies it, but can't hide it from her sister. Surely it's because she was very impressed by what she saw with Malkuth and those three sisters, and then suddenly related it to the two of them.

Midori poses a... hypothesis. If in an emergency, there was only one escape pod, then who would be the one... to stay behind? Momoi thinks and thinks hard, but then finds the problem too complex, so she stops thinking. Midori sighs at her sister but says nothing more and prepares the beds for everyone to sleep. Momoi goes to a corner of the room and whispers…

**Momoi (Whispering):** Of course, I would give it to Midori. Because I'm your older sister.

.

It's late at night. On the ship once full of voices, there is now only silence and the sound of snoring echoing somewhere in the hallway. Perhaps due to accumulated fatigue, everyone has fallen into a deep sleep. Sensei, after checking that everyone is sleeping soundly, returns to his own room and goes to sleep.

But, even though Sensei is very tired, images of the journey over the past few days on the Steel Continent still persist in Sensei's consciousness, making it impossible for him to sleep. Sensei wakes up, sitting pensively for a long time on his bed; the computer he left beside him also glows with him, and inside, Arona and Plana are worried about Sensei with faces full of anxiety and fatigue.

Sensei, despite having many thoughts, still puts his students first. Sensei asks after Arona; everything has ended now, but why does she look so sad? It's true that everything ended with a very beautiful outcome, but Arona and Plana noticed immediately: on the face of the teacher who is usually happy and positive, it was revealed instantly that Sensei doesn't think so.

Sensei smiles; turns out, it shows so clearly on his face. Arona and Plana are the same; both are crying now because, even though they weren't directly on the scene, seeing their respected teacher battered and tormented by those thoughts, they couldn't hold back their tears.

Sensei tries to comfort them that they don't need to cry for him, but Arona refuses; she can't restrain her heart because Sensei isn't crying, right? He still pretends he's okay, but deep inside, his tears are as vast as the wide sea. Sensei smiles, gently strokes their heads, and says…

**Sensei:** Thank you both for thinking of me. But, I think I should do this.

**Plana:** Why... Sensei?

**Sensei:** Things that happened cannot be undone. Whether we regret it now or make excuses, it can't be accepted.

**Plana:** Then, is there anything we can do?

**Sensei:** It is to keep living. No matter how difficult or painful, we must continue to live.

**Arona:** Does Sensei mean to remember everything and shoulder it...? Because of the things that slipped through our fingers, or the things we accidentally missed…

**Sensei:** Yes, even without knowing what lies ahead, and even if in the end we receive nothing.

*(Hearing this, Arona and Plana finally stop crying; they quickly wipe their tears and smile at Sensei, as usual.)*

**Arona:** We will always be by Sensei's side. No matter what happens... So, Sensei…

**Plana:** Please don't give up, Sensei. As long as Sensei doesn't give up, we will also do our best until the end.

**Sensei:** ...Yeah. Thank you both, very much.

*A short conversation Sensei had with Arona and Plana, but it contained many things worth reflecting on. But, as the person who has written these plot summaries until the very end, I can tell you this.*

*Keep living; trip and fall more in this life to realize how much more we need to grow. We shouldn't just stick to an ideal and assume everything is predestined like that, and later when we grow up and know more things in this world, we will see how meaningful the journey we went through was. Because things we seize for ourselves are much more precious than what we were given from the start.*

*Everything that happened on the Steel Continent passed in the blink of an eye. Too many things happened, too much sadness we had to face, but there were also many small joys in that chaos.*

*Those are experiences that cannot be written into words.*

*These are the final lines I write to everyone. Leave the sadness behind; leave the worries and anxieties to the past and let that past sleep peacefully. Let's return together, as a new person, and... with a new student as well.*

*I wish you all a good night.*

*Dream of the best things.*

*And to you, who have accompanied me throughout this journey, wherever you are, whatever you are doing, good morning, good afternoon, and good night.*

*See you again.*

*Now, together, under this Sky of Unity, let's return to our beloved school, return to our home.*

*Let's set off; return to Millennium Science School.*

1ravdp7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ravdp7,Hostess Lemon Blueberry Coffee Cake and Carrot Cake Donettes for Easter,"Valentine's Day just ended so now they're pushing out Easter snacks, so here's a couple I bought while I was out. Hostess usually doesn't let me down, so I was down to try these.

First up, the Lemon Blueberry Coffee Cakes. Now, I love their coffee cakes with their cinnamon flavor and strudel topping, but I also like fruity flavors too, so I was hoping these would be a hit. While I do like them, I didn't necessarily love them. The lemon and blurberry flavor, while there, tastes more subtle compared to the cinnamon. It's still soft and sweet, and definitely filling for a single snack, so I'd still recommend them.

Now, the Carrot Cake donettes... First of all, you're going to be tasting the strudel topping because as you can see, each donette was caked with it. I'm talking it's more strudel and granulated sugar than it is actually donut. That's not necessarilly a bad thing however, since the toppings tastes great. However, you can still taste the carrot cake flavor despite the topping, which is probably why I enjoy these more. It does taste a little like ""carrot cake flavor"" than ""carrot cake"" if you know what I mean, but I would honestly munch down the whole bag in one sitting if I could.",18,1771691216.0,junkfoodfinds,1,1.0,False

1ravdfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeddingsCanada/comments/1ravdfy/budget_breakdown_reality_check_gta_brunch_wedding/,"Budget breakdown Reality check? (GTA, Brunch wedding, $35k, 80 guests)","Hi everyone, 1.5 months into wedding planning and 8 more months to go and I'd love some feedback on the way our budget breakdown is shaping up, if you think I'm forgetting anything or should adjust for something? Feedbacks/thoughts are welcome

(I'm also posting this to maybe go back on it after our wedding and see how wrong I was or if it ended up working out like I thought it would, we'll see!)

For context, we live and are getting married in  Hamilton/Toronto. We are inviting 90 people but expect to have around 60-80 guests, given that this is a destination wedding for most of our guests. Overall budget is $35k (Canadian dollars).

We are a queer couple (both 28f) and from different cultures, so we're doing things somewhat non traditionally.

Here is the budget breakdown I'm anticipating based on my research/things we have started booking:

**LEGAL CEREMONY: 2%** or $700. I didn't find this category in a lot of budgets online but this should cover the $338 fee for a civil ceremony at the Old City Hall in Toronto, plus marriage license fees and some legal document fees.

**VENUE: 5%** or $1750. This is a steal imo because it's a very bright reception room at the Art Gallery of Hamilton, this price includes 4 hour rental time on a Sunday + 1.5hr of set up + 1hr of tear down, venue coordinator, table/chairs/linens/tableware, insurance, complimentary access to the whole museum for all our guests, and I padded this budget prediction a little bit with 2 hours labor fee in case they need more time for set up. This means we are locked in with their caterer though.

**CATERING: 29%** or $10,150. This is my estimate based on us taking their $69/pp brunch (salad, bread, waffle station, meat carving station, omelette station, dessert table, coffee), swapping out one of the option which they met charge is slightly more for, and then adding some passed appetizers and a mocktail. No taxes because this is through a charitable venue, 20% gratuity but the absence of taxes is saving us money.

**DRINKS: 6%** or $2,100. We don't plan on serving alcohol at the bar (controversial choice, I know) because my partner is sober, but I'd like there to be a glass of champagne for person as a nod to my heritage (I'm estimating $600 total), and there would be either an interactive tea station where people can mix their own tea and brew it or take it home as a guest favor (the station is $1,100 if so this will absorb the guest favor budget) and/or a coffee/hot chocolate/apple cider bar.

**GUEST FAVOURS: 2%** or $700, we don't have a lot of ideas and I've heard favours get left behind a lot, plus we have so many guests flying in, so this may be absorbed by the drinks budget for the tea favours. Or we'll do individual cards, or something edible?

**RENTALS: 4%** or $1,400. I don't really know what we're going to need to rent extra, I assume a space heater or two (they're $175 with our venue), maybe a screen projector? Or a photo booth? I need to research the price to DIY a photo booth.

**MUSIC: 2%** or $700. We don't plan on having dancing, more games and conversations. One of our friend is a professional cellist and wants to play at our wedding so we will pay her a little bit for playing like half an hour (she will probably say no but we will try), we are renting a piano ($150 with our venue) because my fiancée is a pianist and so are a lot of our guests, and other than that this should be a Spotify playlist plugged in our venues sound system.

**DECOR: 4%** or $1,400. Our venue proposed a lot of add-ons, we should spend around $650 on renting their ceremony backdrop, ceiling paper lanterns and stars, candles/votives. That leaves us around $750 for miscellaneous decor outside of flowers, we're envisioning table runners, old books, some small vintage objects, DIY table numbers on a painting background to tie in the art gallery.

**FLOWERS: 7%** or $2,450. This one is a bit of a doozy because my fiancée wants us to share a bouquet and I want each of us to have our own lol, we'll see where we land. But this would hopefully cover one or two bouquets plus simple bud vases at every table? Maybe even some extra greenery for our ceremony backdrop? I'm open to dry flowers too. I'm really unsure about budget for this at this point.

**ATTIRE: 10%** or $3,500. This percentage is much higher than what I've seen online before but we are two brides, so there are two dresses that have already cost us $2,050, and I'm keeping space for a suit or another dress for the civil ceremony for my fiancée, alterations, shoes... We're going to try and thrift accessories and use jewelry we already have, I'm wearing my mom's veil. 

**HAIR & MAKE UP: 2%** or $700. We're planning on DIYing that, I love doing my make up and am planning to purchase some nice quality make up with that budget, maybe take a class, and my partner will be doing our hairs and might use some of that budget for hair accessories.

**WEDDING RINGS: 3%** or $1,050. I don't know if this should be part of the wedding budget and we haven't looked too much into it honestly. 

**PHOTOGRAPHY: 10%** or $3,500. I originally had this percentage lower but there is a photographer whose style we love, excellent vibe, and with our split schedule of 2 hours on Thursday for the legal ceremony and 5 hours on Sunday for the reception,  plus some travel fees, this is their rate... I'm a little torn but I really like them. Also I've kept a budget for videography and we don't know if we want videography, so maybe I could nix it entirely and even book the full 6 hours coverage on Sunday, would be more expensive but less stressful timeline wise. Thoughts?

**VIDEOGRAPHY: 4%** or $1,400. I like the idea of having some video but having a professional vendor doesn't feel like a very high priority, my partner doesn't care, so I've been taking percentages out of this category and giving them elsewhere... At this point I don't know if I can do anything with that budget, if I should try to make it work or just give up on videography and have my professional photographer friend press record on a camera on a tripod for our vows.

**STATIONERY: 3%** or $1,750. I would so digital invites but my partner really cares so we might do paper invites. Hopefully that leaves us with some budget for printing some minimal signage.

**GIFTS: 2%** or $700. We're not having bridal parties so I don't know what we will gift to who yet, but hey, we have a budget set aside for it.

**OTHER/MISCELLANEOUS: 5%** or $1,750, for unexpected taxes or random small things that may come up.

1ravcgy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ravcgy,Few interesting things i observed during my last trip!,"So basically I went on a trip to Coorg (a hill station in 

Karnataka) with my mom and learned/noticed a few things which I would like to share. First of all, Coorg is pretty close to my heart because my family used to live there 20 years ago. Obviously I don’t really remember anything from that time, but still.

There were also so many times when my plan to go there got cancelled, with friends and family both. I used to think it was in my destiny that I would go there with my then gf (now ex), but anyways here are the things I noticed:

Coffee: Coffee is mainly of two types ; Arabica and Robusta. Arabica has less caffeine content and you can consume 3–4 cups of Arabica coffee every day. Mostly you’ll see Starbucks using this coffee. Robusta coffee has a very high caffeine content; it’s difficult to consume it directly, so while processing it, another crop named chicory is added to reduce the bitterness and caffeine level. You would mostly see companies like Nescafe using Robusta coffee. Also, Arabica coffee was brought to India from Ethiopia and was first planted in a place named Chikkamagaluru (which is also near Coorg), and then in Coorg. Robusta coffee was brought by the British.

Next thing, I roamed around the local town a lot and observed that here the number of girls going to school is way more than guys. I think the reason is that most of the locals own businesses and simply hand them over to their sons, so the guys don’t really have to study much. But it’s true that the education sector here is dominated by girls.

I also came to know that local businesses have stayed exactly the same for more than 20 years. Same shops, same owners, same everything. The only thing that has changed is the number of hotels, homestays, and resorts at every corner, which is visibly frustrating to the locals.

In the end, I would 100% suggest you visit Coorg and try exploring the local town and learning about the history of the place it’s really interesting. Also, if you do visit Coorg, make sure to carry cash with you. You’ll need it!",7,1771691133.0,TwentiesIndia,0,1.0,False

Also I've kept a budget for videography and we don't know if we want videography, so maybe I could nix it entirely and even book the full 6 hours coverage on Sunday, would be more expensive but less stressful timeline wise. Thoughts?

**VIDEOGRAPHY: 4%** or $1,400. I like the idea of having some video but having a professional vendor doesn't feel like a very high priority, my partner doesn't care, so I've been taking percentages out of this category and giving them elsewhere... At this point I don't know if I can do anything with that budget, if I should try to make it work or just give up on videography and have my professional photographer friend press record on a camera on a tripod for our vows.

**STATIONERY: 3%** or $1,750. I would so digital invites but my partner really cares so we might do paper invites. Hopefully that leaves us with some budget for printing some minimal signage.

**GIFTS: 2%** or $700. We're not having bridal parties so I don't know what we will gift to who yet, but hey, we have a budget set aside for it.

**OTHER/MISCELLANEOUS: 5%** or $1,750, for unexpected taxes or random small things that may come up.

What do you all think? Would love to have an external point of view, it's so hard to talk about money to people IRL.",1,1771691117.0,weddingplanning,11,1.0,False

Here's my actual system for finding *real* savings by cross-referencing prices and reviews (saved $250 on kitchen appliances last quarter) 💸","Seriously, who else is sick of seeing a '70% off!' banner only to click through and realize it's 70% off some mythical MSRP that the product never actually sells for? Or those ""limited time only"" sales that pop up every other week, hawking items at their regular price? I've been there, gotten fed up, and decided to actually dig into what's a real find versus clever marketing.

I started tracking a few items I actually needed, and it's genuinely surprising what you uncover when you consistently cut through the noise. It takes a bit of consistency, but the savings are real.

Here are a few recent examples of what I've found by putting in a little effort:

*   **Smart Home Hub:** I was looking for a specific smart hub that typically sells for around $49.99. Instead of jumping on the first ""sale"" I saw, I kept an eye on it for about two weeks, checking a few major retailers daily. Finally caught it for **$34.99** on Amazon (a solid 30% difference) – not part of a big advertised event, just a regular price drop. *Heads up: It went in and out of stock a few times at that price, so timing was crucial.*
*   **Quality Coffee Maker:** My old one died, and I had my eye on a specific, well-reviewed brand that's usually $119. I tracked its price across three different websites and found it direct from the manufacturer for **$89.99** during a short, quiet 'friends & family' type sale (25% difference). This took about 15 minutes of cross-referencing over a couple of days to spot.
*   **Bulk AA Batteries:** Not the most exciting, but essential. Instead of grabbing the first pack at the grocery store for $14.99, I found a well-rated brand on sale for **$9.99** on Target's website (33% difference) after comparing it to a couple of other major stores' regular prices. Small savings, sure, but those add up over time.

Now, let's be real. This isn't some magic button that makes every purchase half-price instantly. It takes a little consistent effort and patience. You won't always find a massive discount, and some items just don't get deeply discounted often. Shipping times can vary, and sometimes deals are regional or stock runs out fast. My point is, the genuine savings are out there, but you have to be willing to look past the flashy ads and do a bit of homework.
