We‚Äôve bought a new house and will be moving in soon. We've been ordering furniture and other items online, although most of them haven't been delivered yet.

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve purchased so far:

1 Mustard/yellow 3-seater leather sofa

2 grey sofa chairs

1 brown leather chair

1 Light pink coffee table

Dark green TV unit

Mixed colour dining chairs (2 orange, 2 mustard, 2 navy)

Green pendant lights (same shade as the TV unit)

Walls are white and flooring White Oak wood

Radiators are traditional style in black

Glazed door is also black

Beige/cream colour rug

Do you think this will be too colourful? Should I consider cancelling or changing the colour of any items? We enjoy colourful interiors, but we're concerned it might feel overwhelming once everything is in place. What‚Äôs your opinion?",2,1750867970.0,HomeDecorating,0,1.0,False

1lk9rip,https://i.redd.it/vf3he0ylk39f1.jpeg,The New *Girl at UPS,"It was her first week at the UPS hub in a dusty corner of Texas, and already, Mia was turning heads. She was 26, with a quick smile and a knack for tossing packages onto the belt like she‚Äôd been born in brown. Her uniform fit just right, and her laugh echoed across the loading dock during the morning rush. The package car drivers‚Äîthose grizzled, caffeine-fueled kings of the delivery routes‚Äînoticed. Oh, they noticed.

Mia wasn‚Äôt naive. She‚Äôd worked warehouses before, dealt with the leers and the half-baked pickup lines. But this hub was something else. The drivers, a pack of them ranging from cocky twentysomethings to weathered guys pushing 50, seemed to have made a game out of her. It wasn‚Äôt about charm or connection. It was about who could ‚Äúscore‚Äù first, like she was a prize at the county fair.

First was Jake, the pretty-boy driver with a TikTok following for his ‚Äúdelivery guy flex‚Äù videos. He sauntered up during her break, leaning against a stack of boxes, his mirrored sunglasses reflecting her unimpressed face. ‚ÄúYo, Mia, you ever ride shotgun in a package car? I could show you the scenic route.‚Äù His grin was all teeth, like a shark circling. She raised an eyebrow, sipping her coffee. ‚ÄúScenic route? You mean the alley behind the strip mall? Pass.‚Äù Jake laughed, but his eyes flickered with annoyance. Strike one.

Then came Tony, the veteran driver with a salt-and-pepper beard and a wedding ring he conveniently tucked into his pocket. He tried the ‚Äúmentor‚Äù angle, offering to ‚Äúshow her the ropes‚Äù after hours. ‚ÄúYou gotta know the tricks, sweetheart,‚Äù he said, winking as he handed her a mis-sorted package. Mia didn‚Äôt miss a beat. ‚ÄúOnly trick I need is how to get you to scan your own returns, Tony.‚Äù The other loaders snickered, and Tony muttered something about ‚Äúkids these days‚Äù as he shuffled off. Strike two.

By day four, the drivers had a betting pool going. Mia caught wind of it from a sorter named Carla, who whispered the gossip while they sorted Priority Mail. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre tossing 20 bucks each into a pot,‚Äù Carla said, shaking her head. ‚ÄúWinner gets the cash‚Äîand bragging rights if they ‚Äòclose the deal.‚Äô Disgusting.‚Äù Mia‚Äôs jaw tightened, but she didn‚Äôt say much. She just kept working, her hands moving faster, her eyes sharper.

Friday morning, the hub was chaos‚Äîholiday season looming, packages piling up. The drivers were in full swagger, hyped for their routes and their stupid game. That‚Äôs when Mia decided she‚Äôd had enough. She climbed onto a crate during the pre-shift huddle, her boots scuffing the wood, and clapped her hands. The hub went quiet, all eyes on her.

‚ÄúAlright, listen up,‚Äù she said, her voice cutting through the hum of conveyor belts. ‚ÄúI know about your little pool. Real classy, guys. But here‚Äôs the deal: I‚Äôm not your trophy. I‚Äôm here to work, same as you. So take your 20 bucks, buy some better cologne, and leave me the hell alone. Anyone tries me again, I‚Äôm reporting it to HR‚Äîand I‚Äôve got names.‚Äù She hopped down, grabbed her scanner, and walked off, leaving a stunned silence in her wake.

Jake tried to laugh it off, but his face was red. Tony stared at his boots. The other drivers shifted awkwardly, their bravado deflated. By lunch, the betting pool was quietly disbanded, and the drivers stuck to their routes without so much as a flirty glance.

Mia didn‚Äôt need their approval. She clocked in, clocked out, and kept her head high. Word spread around the hub: the new girl wasn‚Äôt just tough‚Äîshe was untouchable. And as the weeks passed, the drivers learned to respect her, not for her looks, but for the way she owned the job. Mia wasn‚Äôt here to play games.

Fool's Gold

Looking out the window  
Through the cracks in the blinds  
Sipping my coffee  
In the morning sunshine

Not gonna lie  
I'm enjoying my time  
Strumming my guitar  
Making up rhymes

I gave up worryin‚Äô  
A long time ago  
About all those things  
That I cannot control

I turn off the TV  
Put down the phone  
I live my best my best life  
By being alone

Some people think,  
Well ain‚Äôt that a shame  
How can you win  
If you don‚Äôt play the game

Buy a new car  
Shiny and new  
If that don‚Äôt make you happy  
Maybe buy two

It's fool's gold x3

What‚Äôs it all mean  
Is it a joke or a lie  
I‚Äôve seen too many things  
Too many tears in these eyes

To love is to lose  
To lose is to cry  
To hurt is to live  
To live is to die

This time for good  
I made a new life  
Deep in the woods

Now I‚Äôm living off the map  
Where I can‚Äôt be found  
I do my best livin  
When there‚Äôs no one around

Some people say  
Well ain‚Äôt it a shame

And nobody came

And Have a ball  
Load up the truck  
You can take it all

Cause it‚Äôs fool‚Äôs Gold

I found some yellow rocks  
In a cool running stream  
I hit the motherlode  
And I was living the dream

I filled up a mansion  
With the fanciest things  
I made a lot of friends  
My wealth was obscene

I paid a lotta taxes  
And I gave to the poor  
No matter how much  
They always need more

I bought a lot of stock  
I gambled and played  
I never met a dollar  
I thought could be saved

I lost all my money  
My friends my new wife  
I had to get back  
To a simpler life

Playing the blues  
Deep in the woods  
Back to my shack  
This time for good

Some people think  
well ain‚Äôt it a shame  
He died all alone  
And nobody came

He spent his whole fortune  
On everyone else  
when be needed a hand

1lk9n52,https://www.reddit.com/r/WFH/comments/1lk9n52/advice_for_working_from_home/,Advice for Working From Home,"Hi everyone,

Not totally sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but I figured it‚Äôs a good place to start. I (29F) am about to be laid off on Monday after working full-time (and often more than 50 hours/week) for the last 12 years ‚Äî most recently at my husband‚Äôs family company. The rest of the field crew, including my husband, will be transitioning to a new company, but I won‚Äôt be going with them.

Instead, I‚Äôm using this time to launch an Office Assistance business from home and help support my husband as he starts building a business of his own. We‚Äôve talked about starting a family in the next few years, so it feels like a good time to set up something I can run independently and potentially scale while raising kids.

I've been begging to work from home for years and now that it's coming up, I‚Äôm really nervous about the transition from being constantly ‚Äúout and about‚Äù to working from home solo. I‚Äôve always thrived in fast-paced environments surrounded by people. Even when I worked a coffee job for a year, I found it lonely because my schedule never lined up with friends or family. My husband was an HVAC service tech with crazy hours, so we barely saw each other ‚Äî which is what eventually brought me back to working with his family.

Now, I won‚Äôt have coworkers, customers, or even a commute. I don‚Äôt have a car and we live in an area where I can‚Äôt really walk into town. I do have two dogs I‚Äôm excited to get moving with on more walks, and I‚Äôd like to focus on fitness and getting in better shape. But I‚Äôm also worried about losing touch with the outside world, becoming socially awkward, or just feeling stuck and isolated.

I don‚Äôt have much of a friend group right now, and to be totally honest, things with my husband‚Äôs family have been really tense as the business winds down. We‚Äôre both eager to focus on our own life and relationship and start fresh ‚Äî but this is a big lifestyle change for me, and I don‚Äôt want to end up spiraling.

Any tips for creating structure, finding community, staying confident, or just... not going nuts? I‚Äôll take it all.

So, I spent the last 2 months building a website that lets anyone turn text descriptions or images into stunning 3D models with just a few clicks. No design skills needed!

**How It Works**:

* Type something like ‚Äúa red racing car‚Äù or upload an image (e.g., a sketch of a spaceship).
* Our AI does the heavy lifting and generates a 3D model in seconds.
* You can view, rotate, and download the model or even embed it in your projects (games, AR, or 3D printing).

**The Journey**:  
I started this as a solo side project because I wanted to make 3D creation accessible to everyone, not just pros. Learning AI and 3D rendering was a wild ride‚ÄîI had no idea what I was doing half the time! After countless late nights and coffee runs, I launched it 2 months ago, and the response blew me away.

**What‚Äôs Happening Now**:

* Over 13K users have tried it, creating 25K+ 3D models!
* Creators are using it for game assets, video animation, and even 3D-printed prototypes. (One of our user printed an entire soccer stadium with unique miniature figurines)  
* We got 3rd place on product hunt, many users who was just checking out offered to help for free.
* We are working on the next step which will be a unique feature on the market.

**Check It Out**:  
You can try it for free at [https://www.z3d.ai](https://www.z3d.ai) Not many on the market is offering freemium to start. 

I‚Äôm stoked about how far this has come, but I know it can be better. What features would you love to see? More output formats? VR integration? Hit me with your ideas or feedback‚ÄîI read every comment!

1lk9kpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1lk9kpq/is_this_fdia/,Is this FDIA?,"Asking for a friend‚Ä¶

Ok, so my friend (45m) has a crazy baby mama, except I think she may really be crazy and I am worried about the kids. (Family services already involved so don‚Äôt rush to tell me to call police)

Mom(43f) is nasty dirty, her house just got condemned, filled with trash and piss soaked laundry, no working toilet no stove. Like a bad hoarders episode. She‚Äôs unemployed for the last 20yrs with undiagnosed mental illness. Unresolved trauma from her mother dying of cancer when she was 16-17. Won‚Äôt work, won‚Äôt clean. Just lays in bed depressed, consuming food and media.  Not on any medications, not on any drugs as far as we know.

This was a flipped switch from an active, happy go lucky girl who held a job for years. After having a kid it was like PPD set in and never left. And it got worse with each of 3 kids born (all biologically female). More so with the 3rd who had a serious heart condition and needed multiple surgeries. The attention was Glorious to mom but after finally leaving the hospital it was like a crash. She became very emotionally abusive and manipulative. Eventually my friend fled the abuse. He tried to get custody in the divorce but it‚Äôs a mothers first state.
Mom moved into one of her slumlord father‚Äôs shitty houses rent free, tells the state she uses her daughter‚Äôs social security disability check (for the heart condition) for rent in order to get food stamps.  After dad complains it‚Äôs getting kind of messy he is no longer allowed inside the house at pick ups and drop offs. Kids come back from mom‚Äôs smelly and in dirty clothes. ALL 3 often have accidents and wet the bed.

Now,for a bit more context.. 2 years later my friend remarried. New stepdaughter, and new son.
 So now there are 5 kids involved. Ages a bit intermixed.  We have daughter A (11), daughter B (9), stepdaughter (6) daughter C (3)[serious heart condition] and newborn son. Luckily all the kids get along great. However, with the birth of my friends son, mom‚Äôs mental health seems to have taken a sharp decline. 

First it was the ‚ÄúBaby Wearing‚Äù cult. Hippie moms with heirloom bespoke Tibetan cloth wraps to strap the baby to your body, meeting weekly at a chic-fil-a playplace to be snarky and trade and sell wraps and other wook nonsense. Maybe set up a playdate for the kids, maybe one for the parents too‚Ä¶
Those groups turned on each other pretty quick. Usually once all the money for $150 strips of cloth ran out.

Then it was ‚ÄúUnschooling‚Äù groups of moms (cast offs from the baby wearers) homeschooling the kids together. She pulled the kids out and started this. She loved this idea because she was homeschooled herself. After 2 different groups and a $100 online learning course there was absolutely nothing to show for it. My friend took her back to court but was denied custody again, but mom was ordered to have the kids attend public school.
So now mom has manipulated kids into believing dad is a monster trying to take them from her, and because he has rules about bedtimes and homework, there is no bedtime at moms, no rules and especially no homework.
Well mom didn‚Äôt really care about education so the kids failed 3 years in a row. How does a kid fail 1st grade?? Over 50 absences cuz mom can‚Äôt be bothered to get out of bed to send you doesn‚Äôt help much (I do not understand how truancy charges were never brought up).

Well back to court again‚Ä¶
This time mom doesn‚Äôt even bother to show up. Dad gets granted custody by default and he gets to have them for the school year, mom has them on weekends, the schedule reverses during summer months.
My friend was never trying to take the kids away out of spite but mom worked hard to villainize him to the kids. It was also about this time that daughter A began to use male pronouns and asked to be called a boys name.

Suddenly mom had a cause to champion, Trans rights became everything in her life (which only consisted of laying in bed and Facebook posting about how much of a supportive mother she was to her poor victimized son. And my friend was portrayed as not being accepting, except he was. Hell, he was raised by lesbians. This guy is about the most progressive person you could meet. A little weird, a little wild but really down to earth. And daughter A had always been a  tomboy so it wasn‚Äôt even hard to accept. But mom needed him to be the enemy. Household tensions rise.

Mom finds out my friend got a promotion so she petitions the court for more child support money.  (Why was she still getting child support and ssi check when my friend had primary placement??) but the judge rescinded the child support order entirely and told mom to get a job.  Of course this infuriates mom. Shortly afterward daughter B also begins wanting to use male pronouns but doesn‚Äôt want a new name, goes by their initials which are a common nickname anyway. This kid has always been very feminine and dainty so it seems quite odd behavior. But my friend goes along with it mostly because he doesn‚Äôt want to be the monster mom makes him out to be.

1st year back to school, all 3 struggle but they all pass. The next year all pass again with only the 2 elder daughter/sons having some struggle. Family drama is there but managable, the main issue when my friend tries to take over medical needs. See, mom still claims the kids to get food stamps and medicaid (how does she do that without primary placement?) and she flips out saying if he is handling school she is going to handle medical. Of course this also causes problems because he has them fully insured through his job so now they are double insured with that and medicaid and the bills keep kicking back unpaid by either. This is a headache that continues till today!

The following year is the Covid lockdown. The kids do fine with remote learning but once hybrid learning starts and they have to go back to school in person some days the kids go to moms for a weekend visit and she refuses to return them. Schools aren‚Äôt safe is her claim. 

Back to court again. Also around this time more concerns are raised about the state of mom‚Äôs home. Child Protection Services (CPS) are called to do a well ness check but mom refuses answer the door. CPS claims they can‚Äôt force their way in and nothing is done.
At court the judge says that the children over the age of 13 can decide for themselves to stay with mom but the younger daughter C must be returned for school. Mom promptly signs the elders out of school. That is the end of their education. A 9th grade high school drop out and a 7th grade middle school dropout. Mother knows best!

This is also the last my friend sees of his older children, except at thanksgiving (because they want a meal that mom won‚Äôt be preparing) and Xmas (they want gifts mom can‚Äôt afford with no job), always promising to visit more, never doing it. He is in their driveway twice a week for drop offs/pickups of daughter C and they have come outside maybe 2-3 times in the last 5 years to say hi, usually wanting something. All these teenage ‚Äúboys‚Äù want to talk about is My Little Pony and trans rights. Now 22 and 19, they are uneducated, unemployed, unwashed and look like goth camshow workers, the only masculine thing about them are the acne and random patchy facial hairs from the hormone treatments. Mom is soooo proud of them.

Over this past year daughter C (now the dreaded age of 13, and has always been a super feminine girl who only last year still wanted to be a ballerina) started asking to use male pronouns as well, but still wanted to use their given name because the still feel kind of girly and wants to become a ‚ÄúFemboy‚Äù (pretty sure that‚Äôs a sexualized term typically used in pornography‚Ä¶).

This is where my post‚Äôs question comes in, but first let me tell you the events of this past 2 weeks‚Ä¶

Last week daughterson C has a routine cardiology appointment. Heart cath to see how growth is progressing. Guess they didn‚Äôt like what they saw and decided to put in a stent the same day. School is out so mom has the kid (and she refuses to let dad handle medical stuff anyway).  Fast forward to the weekend and my friend is told about this after the fact when mom txts him that medication doses have changed, bandage change schedule and  activity restriction for 2weeks. 

Over the weekend they go to the movies, the kids aunt runs the movie theater and chats us up after the show. She flips out when she finds out about the medical stuff, she didn‚Äôt realize the heart problems were still a thing past infancy and tells him horror stories about the actual conditions of the house.
Living in piles of filth and laundry, no working toilet, they have a camp toilet that they scoop out with a coffee can, no stove, reeking of piss. She calls and makes a report with CPS. They come and interview my friend and daughterson C at his home and advise him to file for an emergency hearing.

Yesterday‚Ä¶
My friend goes to court again, filing for an emergency hearing to change custody yet again.

The emergency hearing is denied! The court says there isn‚Äôt enough evidence that there is immediate danger, a case will be scheduled normally and to continue to follow the current custody order.

Meanwhile, CPS is finally able to get access to mom‚Äôs home as aunt is part of the trust that owns the house and has keys. The CPS worker won‚Äôt even walk through the house and says that daughterson C cannot be brought back to the house, it should be condemned, and they get evicted. The state will put them into a hotel until shelter can be arranged but they have to go get paychecks evals first. The adult children agree and are taken to the state service center but mom refuses to go and just goes back inside to lay on the filth covered bed.

So the kid is safe‚Ä¶ for now‚Ä¶

So, could this be a case of Factitious disorder imposed on another (Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy)?  Is mom grooming her children to be trans so that she can be super supportive trans-rights momma and give her life meaning? Is there any hope for my friend and his children?",2,1750867283.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

I have also bought a **new** Baratza Encore ESP to go with my Gaggia. 

I've been having a hard time pulling shots that are consistent, don't taste like 7 lemons (i.e. very sour), and that have a beautiful, heavy crema. 

Here are my **issues / questions**:

0: I put *new* in bold next to my grinder description, since I've read somewhere that it might matter and that new grinders take months (!!!) to stop producing a lot of fines. Is that true?

1: How in the world the recommended starting point for grind size in Encore ESP is 10, when I am almost choking my Gaggia when grinding beans (14-16g) @ 15-16 setting? I need to go as high as 18-19 and even then, I still take 90 secs. to pull a shot. I use freshly roasted (7-10 days before) beans.

\* \* \*

2: Most of the time, the pucks are ""soupy"" and there's more water at the top to immediately dissipate once the portafilter has been removed, i.e. too much (am I right?). I've noticed, however, that when I use MORE coffee (18g) but set my Encore to 19 or 20, I get the nice-looking, dry and firm pucks. 

2a: Am I right I should expect about 2 oz. of espresso in about 30 secs. from a 16g of coffee AND that using 18g with Gaggia stock double-shot filter is too much?

\* \* \*

3: Since I've bought a used machine, what testing should I do to ensure the machine is fine? So far, I've bought [this](https://nuovaricambi.net/en/product/3210-filter-holder-gaggia-with-gauge-assy) and it is telling me 14 bars. I've also once done a flow test on a similar Gaggia and the one I have now seems very close - so it is unlikely I have issues with the flow. 

I am not saying something for sure is wrong, perhaps it actually is most likely that Gaggia is working fine, but I wanted to eliminate as many variables as I can from the already complicated equation of a perfect shot...

3a: is a static pressure check (as I understand, *static* means doing a blind shot with a tool as the one I bought) worth anything, or do I need to do a dynamic pressure test (as I understand it, the *dynamic* pressure test is when you actually pull a shot while measuring the pressure)?

My husband works full time, I work part time. Rent is outrageous (I found the cheapest listed apartment in the area) and grocery bills are stupid high. We don‚Äôt make enough to cover rent, car payments, car insurance, groceries, baby stuff, etc, etc. We never eat out, don‚Äôt make extravagant purchases, and only leave the house to go to and from work, and occasionally to the park down the road.

1lk9cuu,https://i.redd.it/715cuskj439f1.jpeg,[UK] Work in progress 3 seasons camping setup with my IONIQ 5.,"Hi,

It's been a few iterations now of working out how to camp in the UK at events.

My current setup:
- IONIQ 5 Namsam Edition (2023, RWD)
- Thule Square roof bars
- an old Thule Touring L Roof Box (2017)
- AirVenture Canvas Air Tent from Bell Tent Sussex
- Decathlon XL awning
- Zempire table
- Exped Megamat Auto
- Screw pegs + Impact driver because I'm lazy.
- OEM Sunshade

We (174 cm humans * 2, 65-75kg each) sleep in the car and mostly use the tent as a changing and storage space. We use V2L in the morning to make some coffee. We use this setup for 3 nights each time.

**Energy**
- Without our load and roof bars, we usually have an efficiency of 3.2 to 3.6 miles per kWh (mostly at 70mph)
- With a fully loaded car and a roofbox, we usually have an efficiency of 2.6 to 3.0 miles per kWh (mostly at 70mph). Note the 2.6 one was done in the cold and wet weather that this fabulous country has to offer. 
- We usually have around 6-8% of the battery drained per night, we set the temperature at 17C and the fan speed to 1.
- We usually arrive on site at 90-85% Battery Charge.

**Sleep**
The Exped Megamat Auto first the car well, but we had to get a Dog Car Seat Cover to make it even more confortable. It just allows the mattress to distribute the load around our heads evernly and doesn't sag too much around the headrest that are underneath.
I also made some windows covers to have a bit more privacy.

**Previous iterations**
- I had a tailgate tent before, it's far more convenient for me to have a setup that is not that long and the tent didn't fit well the car as well.
- I have Exped Megamat which kind of fit the car with the mattress being folded where the wheel arches are, the Auto give you more space on the side as your body is not pulled towards the middle.
- We used to sleep in the tent, but found out that the car is quieter and you have AC the whole night.

**Next?**
- Update to the latest version of the IONIQ 5 when my lease is up just because it's shinier.
- A better roof box/bars? I would like to have a bit less wind noise.

Part 1


How far is your drive to work mine is 55 miles one way. I work second shift  it‚Äôs a peaceful ride it gives me time to think and the peacefulness helps me clear my head it also.  I believed made me not notice what was not in front of me. There is a section of my route between the two small town where I don‚Äôt have cell service for a few miles. 

I drive down a steep wooded hill that then expands into a cleared valley with a white old church with a graveyard  on either side. A great stone slab walk way leads up to the church lighted by old black lanterns.  I never really looked at it beside a glance  until tonight it was 12:43 or 45. I can‚Äôt remember I was coming down the hill when my eyes caught a light in the church. I slowed down inationally thinking it was a fire but slowly. I realized it was candles in all the windows. I stoped and thought how strange this was  the church that was dead is now alive. I slowly started gaining speed driving away. I glanced back to see the wooden doors to the church open and a dark figure out side sweeping the doorway. MY drive was normal but I couldn‚Äôt get that out of my head still shaken. 

I pulled into my apartment  and  checked the mail. To my shock there was a post card with a  painting of the very same church on it on the back was a hand written invitation to Sunday mass maybe tomorrow. I will leave early for work and walk around the church and see if a priest lives. There to ask why the hell I got an invite seeing I live a half a hour away from this place. I am pissed  someone had to see me repeatedly drive past that place and somehow got my address. It‚Äôs sorta shaken up i will have my boyfriend come over tonight. He‚Äôs  a big old boy I could ask him to look up who lives there but he‚Äôs got enough on his plate.  We also have enough material for a fight between us. I will let everyone know what I see tomorrow.



Part 2 

Hi everyone I am  the author boyfriend I haven‚Äôt talked to her since yesterday she didn‚Äôt return my calls or text so. I drove over and found the door unlocked I walked in and found her laptop open on the coffee table. She doesn‚Äôt have any secrets so she doesn‚Äôt have a pass word. I woke up the laptop and this page came up does anyone on here now if this is her only post? She never told me this story. The white church is in the middle of the county where we don‚Äôt get much trouble. 

I don‚Äôt usually patrol up there but hey looks like I am going for a road trip. I called the hospital she works at they said that she took 3 days of PTO. Hopefully this isn‚Äôt over the fight we had. See my Georgia peach is actually not from this shit hole state she from the beutiful snake filled sweat pit of Georgia. I meet her after I got stitched up after an arrest of a drunk d1 college rugby girl. Those creatures scratch her southern ascent had me hooked. I asked her for a date she turned me down seeing I am well known with the  ER nurses. 

Well a week later delta dawn got her BMW stuck in a ditch. Seeing she never drove in a lake effect storm before. I drove her to work in my patrol vehicle and took her back to her place  after work. Where she made me coffee and stole my heart with a homemade pitch cobbler that night and we have been steady ever since. After reading her story it looks like she might‚Äôve  got herself in some trouble. I wonder it might be her past coming for her well those southern don‚Äôt realize how unkind us New Yorkers. Can be am off to go look at this church if she there I will have the hull county on that place. 


Part 3 

Well everyone me and miss southern bell are ok after going to the armory getting some extra supplies and a fresh recruit that is scared of his own shadow. We started driving towards the church the sun was just setting a beautiful Martian of red and yellow it reminded me of foot patrols in the desert just when the heat was reliving of my neck but mostly it reminded me of my grandmother and her front porch and her reading licenses. I was snapped back to reality by my partner never ending question first came where  are we going I told him we had a report of suspicious activity at the old church. Second was the music choice of creed what if third was what is the tree of wisdom  my third answer came as me turning the music to high.  About a quoter of a mile from the church I pulled over and turned down the music. I told hump a due to set up a speed trap and keep his radio clear after the question u sure u can handle this. I got out went to the trunk got my thermal binoculars a donation of some poachers and my long gun and an extra magazine.  I jumped the ditch and started walking down through  thick brush. A beautiful full moon was now visible guiding my way to my location my long gun strapped to my back and my hands free to push the brush out of my way. I heard a click I stoped and looked to my right where I saw a game camera ok cool it is hunting season then I had a thought of me getting shot by a arrow by some hunter what a great image that was. I started back on my track the brush cleared into a grove of pines and below a 100 yard field with the church surrounded by tombstones. There were candle light in every window and a big sign out front that said welcome home after looking through the binos I found nothing beside a big old bore coon in the feild. I started approaching the church by this time I wasn‚Äôt paying attention to the terrain and fell in a tractor route half way by the time I gather my self and check. My gun belt I looked up to catch all the candles in the church to blow out and the old wooden door to blow open. I started running jumped the metal grated fence rifle in hands I rushed the entrance flashlight on cleared the door way to inside the church. Where I found her layed out on the floor in her work outfit. I approached her rifle pointed down range she was breathing good I radioed for rookie to get the patrol vehicle on location and to get a ambulance for a unresponsive female in route. That‚Äôs  when I heard grimling of I don‚Äôt need that I turned around to in my shock she was standing  in said once more Collin please cancel the ambulance to late now. You can just say no to a free trip to the hospital. I asked her what happened and she told me it can wait and got up and hugged me  after we sat on the steps of the church rookie pulled up light on to see me and my woman sitting on the steps. Rookie started up the stairs to meet us half way I said let‚Äôs wait in the patrol vehicle to my amazent the rookie ask nothing after 15 minutes. The  ambulance arrived Nash got out and signed her paperwork and we went back to town I dropped her off at her place and rookie back to the station.

**TASTING NOTES**

Fragrance intensity was medium with really pleasant notes and sweetness. Aroma intensity sits at medium to medium-low with some slight fermented notes and berry fruitiness that you'd expect from a natural process.

Flavor intensity is medium, and you can definitely tell this is a natural processed bean. I'm getting fruitiness throughout, with the aftertaste at medium intensity that disappears cleanly. The blueberry note really comes through on the aftertaste, which is lovely.

The acidity is sweet and really well-integrated - exactly what you want. Sweetness sits at medium as well. Mouthfeel is medium-low with some mouth drying, but with a little slurp, I get beautiful raspberry notes.

For being a natural, this is remarkably clean. Luminous gets another nod from me - this is a nice Geisha that delivers everything I could want in a cup of coffee. It's balanced and I really like how it changes from hot to cold, changing nicley as it cools.

**SCORE:** 7.6/10

Scoring (t8ke scale for reference below):

1 | Disgusting | So bad I poured it out  
2 | Poor | I wouldn't consume by choice  
3 | Bad | Multiple flaws

I have a 10 year old German Shepherd/Husky male. I got him when he was 4 months old from someone who didn‚Äôt care for him. I spent a couple of years training with him and did my best to keep up to date with training. However, i was the only one in the house who was very strict with the training. Even though he‚Äôs a family dog, he is considered ‚Äúmy‚Äù dog and when i got him, i knew about the breeds and what it would take. He‚Äôs been in my family all this time and has always been around other dogs. Since we‚Äôve had him, he‚Äôs lived with 5 other dogs. 

However, he‚Äôs always been very hyper active and slightly aggressive from time to time. No matter how much i trained with him, he still had those instincts. Even some of his trainers in the past have said he‚Äôs a bit complicated. Regardless, we still powered through all the training together. 

Everything started to change when Covid hit. Everyone was home and since no one else really cared about the training, little by little they started to look over the training and dropped boundaries. I hated this, but when it‚Äôs 4 against 2 with training, the dog will never be able to fully understand what is right and what is wrong. 

Basically, he started to attack every dog we‚Äôve had. Whether it was related to food, toys, jealousy, etc., he has attacked them one by one. Each attack drew blood in some way. 

He has only bit humans twice. One was myself.. he got his paw stuck in a fence and i made the mistake of grabbing him by the collar to get him to stop moving so i can release it. He bit my hand because of that. The second time, he bit a family member‚Äôs hand because his two dogs had pinned my dog in a corner and attacked him. This family member put his hand in the middle to try and separate them and claimed my dog bit him. No one was actually present to see what exactly happened and everyone knew this kid was jealous of my dog because he got more attention, so it almost seemed intentional. But that accident did change him, as well. With kids, he‚Äôs always been a bit anxious. I think all the energy from the kids get him worked up and he feels nervous. So, we made sure he wasn‚Äôt around kids. Otherwise, he has no problems with humans. He‚Äôll bark like a Husky at them, but after he gets to know them, he does his zoomies whenever someone comes over. 

Even with training and socialization, he‚Äôs never really cared for other dogs. We would take him to the dog parks and after running for a bit, he would just stand near us and make sure no other dogs approach. Even trainers couldn‚Äôt get him to socialize correctly. He‚Äôs just never had an interest. 

But the real turning point happened last July. My grandma had a shih-tzu that was the cutest thing ever. All of us and the dogs were outside. My grandma was sitting down eating a piece of sweet bread with her coffee.  The Husky/GSD came near her and wasn‚Äôt really begging for food, but i could tell he was eyeing the food. Then out of nowhere, the little shih-tzu passed right by him to get close to his owner, my grandma, and he just bit down on the little guy‚Äôs head. Even worse, he went in for a second bite when he saw that he was still moving. I have never heard my grandma scream like that before. A huge pool of blood formed instantly and everyone was screaming and panicking. To this day, i still see the little guy‚Äôs face looking over at me covered in blood as he was being carried to the car. It‚Äôs an image I‚Äôll never forget and i still cry about it. He was rushed to the vet and we were told the bite had punctured his skull and went into his brain. He was declared brain dead and by the second day, his organs started to fail. We could do scans, but there wouldn‚Äôt be a positive outcome. We made the decision to let him go peacefully. Those little cries in the ER room still haunt me to this day. 

This is when i realized that my dog had basically hurt another dog. There was no warning sign. There was no time to stop him. In 30 seconds, he had basically went in for a hunt I was devastated. My dog literally just snapped and changed forever. I was hurt, but i was more hurt for my grandma. It happened right in front of her. She saw her dog die. 

Since then, we have always kept him separated from other dogs and he‚Äôs practically been confined to just one home. If people walk by the house with dogs, he starts barking like crazy and his hair goes up. He has pretty much changed. I feel bad because his life changed. I don‚Äôt like having him separated when i know he should be able to be around his family. He looks bored and miserable, but we can‚Äôt risk anything happening again. 

I contacted his vet to have him evaluated. Of course, he acted like the sweetest dog when we were in the room. After explaining everything to her, she came to the conclusion that he‚Äôs not extremely aggressive to be put down. She explained that with some breeds, they have very high prey drive and regardless of all the training an owner can do, their instincts will always come first. However, she did also cautious us that it will most likely happen again. We just won‚Äôt know when‚Ä¶. And it‚Äôs true. There‚Äôs been a few instances with growling, teeth showing, etc, but no other bite has happened. It seems like basically now he can‚Äôt be around other dogs. His vet did advise that perhaps he is better off in a home with less noise and as the only dog. She did say ultimately it is up to me. 

I have tried to work with him again, but he has lost interest. I have tried to find him a new home, and i end up getting ghosted at the end. I have reached out to countless rescues and sanctuaries, but they either don‚Äôt respond or say no more room. I can‚Äôt drop him off at the shelter because i just know they‚Äôll put him to sleep the minute i walk out. 

The situation at home is becoming more and more stressful each day. Everyone is slightly afraid of him and he‚Äôs pretty much a ticking time b**b now. He only has about 2-5 years left, which is why I‚Äôd love to see him go live his last few years in a new home where he gets all the attention. But with his history, is that the right thing to do? Is that safe? The risk of him attacking someone else or another dog in another home is very high. Behavioral euthanasia is the second option‚Ä¶ but then i feel extremely guilty even just thinking about it. I end up feeling like i failed him and everyone, but honestly, that situation with the little shih-tzu changed the way i see him. I hate myself for it, but i feel like all trust with him was lost.  

The nicest response i received from a rescue group said that i need to realize the truth and be honest, it will be extremely difficult to find him a new home with his behavior. They also said to remember that i gave him 10 amazing years and even though this is difficult, BE might be the best option. If he were to be rehomed, he‚Äôd spend his last few years wondering when im going to pick him up. 

I have no clue what to do, I‚Äôve been so stressed for the last few months about this, and i just want to do what‚Äôs right for everyone.  ",2,1750866550.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False

1lk988r,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RealJakeyPooV/comments/1lk988r/how_one_mans_grief_destroyed_a_town/,How One Man's Grief Destroyed a Town,"Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her‚Äîfumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna‚Äôs passing, the twins had been born‚Äîtiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday‚ÄîEmma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then‚Äîsilence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.

# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it‚Äîcruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel‚Äôs alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tiny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn‚Äôt bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn‚Äôt drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of ‚Äústages,‚Äù ‚Äúhealing,‚Äù ‚Äúcoping,‚Äù while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog‚Äîa golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was ‚Äúgood with kids.‚Äù Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn‚Äôt ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile‚Äîas if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors‚Äîbackpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper‚Äîquiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons‚Äîa plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye‚Äîplastered with ‚ÄúProud Parent‚Äù stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later‚Äîcursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car‚ÄîRobert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn‚Äôt fix anything. It didn‚Äôt bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest‚Äîjust enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.

# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn‚Äôt enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, a borrowed thing‚Äîone that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically‚Äîhis grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill‚Äîfast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn‚Äôt stop. The child‚Äôs face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn‚Äôt move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert‚Äôs jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn‚Äôt learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine‚Äîbut not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still‚Äînot enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don‚Äôt remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy‚Äîmaybe six‚Äîslipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother‚Äôs scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn‚Äôt the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn‚Äôt stop.

# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water‚Äôs edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened‚Äîthe gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back‚Äîa touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet‚Äîparents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn‚Äôt stop. He didn‚Äôt look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma‚Äôs crib and Samuel‚Äôs racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn‚Äôt contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.

# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy‚Äôs body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other‚Äôs eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn‚Äôt last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned‚Äîcautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn‚Äôt stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall‚ÄîMiller Park‚Äîunder the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn‚Äôt enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn‚Äôt feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party‚Äîballoons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise‚Äîjust another utility worker. He didn‚Äôt need threats or blackmail this time. He didn‚Äôt need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma‚Äôs old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn‚Äôt shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now‚Äînot because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn‚Äôt yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck‚Äîwhite flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other‚Äôs arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it‚Äîlooped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child‚Äôs name‚ÄîEli Meyers‚Äîsuddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: ‚ÄúHe looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.‚Äù

Then a new tab opened‚Äîher niece‚Äôs photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: ‚ÄúShe still likes hide-and-seek, right?‚Äù

Linda‚Äôs hands hovered over the keys. She didn‚Äôt call anyone. She didn‚Äôt say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week‚Äîsecondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

‚ÄúSabotage.‚Äù

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn‚Äôt make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn‚Äôt need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it‚Ä¶ they were just getting started.

# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren‚Äôt mourning Robert‚Äôs children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn‚Äôt enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song‚Äî""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn‚Äôt special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn‚Äôt scream. He didn‚Äôt run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely‚Äîbut deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy‚Äôs brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy‚Äôs mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him‚Äîsomething fragile and bright‚Äîhad been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn‚Äôt light a cigarette. Didn‚Äôt open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn‚Äôt revenge anymore. It wasn‚Äôt even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports‚Äîall of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn‚Äôt have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I‚Äôm coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

# Chapter 7: The Spider‚Äôs Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it‚Äîand maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins‚Äîevents that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn‚Äôt yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there‚Äîmapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don‚Äôt want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn‚Äôt just violence. This was love‚Äîtwisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn‚Äôt a phone number. It wasn‚Äôt coordinates. It wasn‚Äôt a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced‚Äîsimple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel‚Äôs Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria‚Äôs pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds‚Äîone tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria‚Äôs throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it‚Äî A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself‚Äîphotographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn‚Äôt been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them‚Äîno bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph‚ÄîEmma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo‚Äôs yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn‚Äôt look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel‚Äôs face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion‚Äînot anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn‚Äôt happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn‚Äôt forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert‚Äôs lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children‚Äîtheir heads drooping in the cold‚Äîand then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then‚Äîslowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn‚Äôt acted alone.

And Halston‚Äôs nightmare was far from over.

# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond‚Äôs edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl‚Äôs body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still‚Äîthe dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn‚Äôt about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn‚Äôt trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn‚Äôt meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn‚Äôt want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox‚Äîthe bus driver‚Äîtook the longest. He didn‚Äôt speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn‚Äôt need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn‚Äôt needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed‚Äîsmall acts, each just a hair‚Äôs breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren‚Äôt.

At the center of the new web wasn‚Äôt a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.

# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone‚Äîa hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn‚Äôt recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now‚Äîtyped, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We‚Äôre still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn‚Äôt she?"" ""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now‚Äîsomething familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn‚Äôt needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it ‚Äúlooked wrong.‚Äù Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria‚Äôs front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""",1,1750866496.0,u_RealJakeyPooV,0,1.0,False

You can find the full translation and the original text¬†[here](https://jumpshare.com/v/8JZrvGq0yIe9JgIDugN2).

# Nightwish‚Äôs Tarja Turunen - Clearest voice in Kitee

When a classical soprano sings in a heavy band, the combination causes admiration and anger. For a long time Tarja Turunen‚Äôs own thoughts were also contradictory. For the stage she had to wear black leather with a sinful corset. A glimpse of fear went through her mind.

What if people can see the ‚Äògirl from Kitee‚Äô beneath the clothes? 

‚ÄúOnly now I‚Äôm sure of myself,‚Äù Tarja says.

The closer to Kitee we drive, the darker the clouds change. Finally an explosion over the wilderness scenery and the electricity-white lightning pierces the sky. A few weeks ago the area had such a violent thunderstorm raging that up to 60¬†000 thunderbolts hit the ground. One even hit the church‚Äôs cross.

This is the landscape of Nightwish‚Äôs soul.

For those who have never heard the name, let us tell you that Nightwish is the band who some think should have won the Finnish Eurovision song contest tryouts. The band who has in three years released three albums and with their latest, called Wishmaster, selling gold this summer. The band who enjoys a cult following abroad ‚Äì and right now is on a three-week tour in Latin America.

But foremost Nightwish is known for its singer: Tarja Turunen, who is studying in the Sibelius Academy. The secret to their success lies in the fact that the band has figured to combine a classical soprano with melodramatic heavy guitars roaring keyboards. And how mysterious it all sounds!

Tarja also looks so mysterious in the band‚Äôs video when she with a pale powdered face, black corset and her hair in a bun uses her incomparable voice.

And then:

‚ÄúWelcome to Kitee!‚Äù

We sit on a wood table in Ponnukka-Grill and order coffee in paper cups. Meat pies are about the size of baseball mitts.

# The singer‚Äôs way

‚ÄúActually I‚Äôm not originally from here Kitee‚Äôs center but from Puhos, 14 kilometers away,‚Äù Tarja enlightens us.  
‚ÄúSo my environment as a child was so safe, not at all like this ‚Äòcommotion‚Äô of a village center. That‚Äôs why music was able to capture such a big part of my life. Everything happened by itself.‚Äù

The story is the usual kind. A little girl starts singing kid‚Äôs songs even before she can really talk. At three the child sits in front of the piano and starts to play by ear melodies she has heard on the radio. Parents take notice, there has been musicality in the family. So the girl was taken to her first piano lesson. Her teacher, a sweet cantor woman, lived even further from the village center, almost in the middle of the woods. Grand gestures weren‚Äôt needed there. The teacher talked in such a quiet voice that it was hard to make out the words and flinched when someone entered the room.

‚ÄúMusic has come right beside ever since I was a child. In elementary school a musician was chosen as our principal and a general zest for music took over everyone. In junior high school a Bulgarian man was chosen as our music teacher, he emphasized expression instead of theory. I played drums in the boys‚Äô band, was in music club and the school band, sang at church events and family parties. At fifteen I went to Savonlinna‚Äôs music school because I wanted to. From there I continued to Sibelius Academy‚Äôs church music line. I was supposed to be a cantor‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúPretty soon I noticed though, that I‚Äôm ultimately a singer. Already in first piano lessons you had to sit me down, because I really didn‚Äôt feel like practicing. I knew the notes and wondered why do I still have to polish the technique. Later I did understand why. In puberty exhaustion hit: I don‚Äôt have the energy to play anymore‚Ä¶ Besides I was nervous about the playing situation, every degree has been a pain. It feels like I can‚Äôt control my hands, but I can control my whole body.‚Äù

Tarja still remembers her first performance in Kitee‚Äôs hall as school girl. Her piece was Beethoven‚Äôs *Moonlight Sonata*. When she has played the final note without making a mistake the crowd burst into applause, she wasn‚Äôt only proud, but also relieved.

Years later the same feeling was caused by Nightwish‚Äôs very first show in front of an audience in Kitee. She was weak in the knees then too, even though they were in leather pants for the first time and she was also wearing a suitable black lace top.

Although it wasn‚Äôt the intention, a church music student started to turn into a heavy diva.

# Forest paths

‚ÄúWell yeah, I‚Äôve never lacked the sense for the dramatics.‚Äù

Tarja tells an example. As a toddler she got mad at her mother and decided to run away. She pushed open the front door and started wading across the snowy field and over a dangerous four-way intersection to a nice woman she knew. When she arrived there, she determinately announced that ‚Äúand we‚Äôre not calling mummy.‚Äù Her mother was worried sick when she saw the path winding through the field.

Tarja thinks two opposite personalities live in her. One likes being rough with the guys ‚Äì at home she had to fight with two brothers and in primary school she was the only girl in class ‚Äì the other one rather withdraws aside.

As a child Tarja had two favorite places. One was one of the biggest tamarack forests in Finland right behind her home. There she waited for fairies and wolfed down some wood sorrel until her stomach ached. She did hug trees, because the witch of Puhos who lived nearby apparently did that too.

Before going to sleep, mum would tell a ghost story, according to which a child had died in the forest and year after year the child‚Äôs ghost was seen behind a certain tree. The ghost only calmed when a priest blessed the ground and the tree.

Her other favorite place was an abandoned house.

‚ÄúI still remember the stale, damp smell the house had,‚Äù Tarja says delighted.

‚ÄúI ran there over the field. One single birch grew next to the house. I used to write poems inside, jumped on the cot bed, rummaged through things. My folks always knew where to look for me. From the attic, where mum had specifically told me not to go in, I found a pile of old sneakers and other junk.‚Äù

Recollections are interrupted by a deep sigh.

‚ÄúThe need to be alone hasn‚Äôt vanished over the years. When I come back here to my childhood sceneries or to our home in Kuopio (where Tarja lives with her fianc√©) from tour, I can‚Äôt even open the radio. I put on my sneakers and run to nature, to a forest or to a lakeshore. There I alone listen to the silence and the voices of nature, the wind, birds singing and the waves.‚Äù

‚ÄúI suspect that our keyboardist Tuomas (Holopainen), who composes and writes Nightwish‚Äôs music, has that same need. Tuomas‚Äô family lives almost in the middle of nowhere in the woods. The view from the window of his room is breathtaking ‚Äì almost a fully vertical cliff and a lake right under it. From that view everything you hear on the album is drawn from‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve sometimes wondered whether Nightwish‚Äôs story would end if Tuomas needed to move somewhere else.‚Äù

# Guidances

Tuomas was a divergent, according to Tarja, ‚Äúa man who really walks his own paths.‚Äù

In junior high Tuomas was a class above Tarja, but they were still in greeting terms ‚Äì Tuomas‚Äô mother was Tarja‚Äôs former piano teacher.

Some years later a thin, darkly dressed figure, who kept looking at the tips of his shoes, appeared on Tarja‚Äôs door and said ‚Äúhe‚Äôd had this thought.‚Äù

‚ÄúTuomas had a tape with him, he had played the backgrounds for three songs on the keyboard,‚Äù Tarja tells.

‚ÄúOne of them was called Nightwish‚Ä¶ Tuomas said he wanted the music to float ‚Äì they would only have a classical guitar, a few kettledrums, keyboards and my voice. Why not, I replied and rehearsed the songs for a couple of hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen we moved to the studio to record. When I started to open my voice the guys were about to fall from their chairs. They‚Äôd heard that Tarja can sing, but in that way‚Ä¶ Tuomas might have then decided that this isn‚Äôt going to work ‚Äì let‚Äôs just call it quits. But he on the contrary got excited and saw that this combination worked.‚Äù

From there started Tarja‚Äôs stage of uncertainty that lasted three years. Conflicting thoughts went through her head. Firstly, heavy music was completely foreign to her apart from the normal rock that was heard from her brothers‚Äô rooms when she was a kid. Secondly, she feared for her studies. When Tuomas rang the doorbell, she had studied only six months in the Sibelius Academy. The first reaction from her teachers wasn‚Äôt solely encouraging.

There was also a third thing: preconceptions.

‚ÄúIn high school I became interested in religions,‚Äù she carefully explains.

‚ÄúUntil that point my view on religious people had been really distorted, because our former teacher was a fanatic religious person, who pretty much used a shoe to call God. I was under the impression that when you begin to have faith, you automatically turn into a fanatic.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn Savonlinna high school I met a group of religious teens, not Laestadians but Pentecostalists. My roommate was religious too. I talked to her and to a couple of others and noticed that they were happy, realistic people, who had no need to emphasize their faith.‚Äù

‚ÄúFaith isn‚Äôt a primary or determinative thing in my life. I know what it is. Despite that, I was scared to step into these circles. I confess: I had the exact same preconception I now face myself and have to correct until boredom. Such as: we don‚Äôt play devil music. That this really doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with Satanism. Even the vicar in Kitee had to recently defend Nightwish when a few locals had found an evil message in the lyrics.‚Äù

Tarja‚Äôs parents have also heard terrified remarks. That angers Tarja. She thinks people have already decided what the lyrics mean.

‚ÄúOur lyrics do speak about evil but on a deeper level. You can‚Äôt deny the existence of evil in the world. It affects in every person and every deed. And isn‚Äôt man even by the teachings of Christianity under original sin? I‚Äôm tired and bored of repeating this matter to people who refuse to let go of their preconceptions.‚Äù

# Heading south

Let‚Äôs finally do a sightseeing around Kitee. Tarja is our guide. The baseball arena opens up there. Junior high school is at the end of the road, the gray church sits atop a hill. Well, well, the lane leading to the beach has been closed by a barrier. They used to jump from the five-meter landing there ‚Äì feet first though.

Still only a few years ago a fashion boutique called *Muoti-kuosi* was located in a bleak business building. It could have advertised the fact that Nightwish‚Äôs vocalist bought her first sinfully black leather pants there. At least the blouse was bought in Joensuu ‚Äì her mom being the arbiter of taste.

‚ÄúWhen I left for Savonlinna high school, my parents were criticized, that how can you let your daughter out into the world so young. I was just excited ‚Äì I got to know new people, see new sceneries, learn new things. It‚Äôs unfortunate but in adolescence this kind of small town starts to irritate you. I‚Äôve later wondered that my skills, talents and urges would have surely died if I had stayed here. Now it feels it‚Äôs time for me to also leave Finland‚Ä¶‚Äù

Our chat is suddenly interrupted by the low rhythmic thumping of bass that inseparably belongs in every urban area. A red Escort with a rear wing thrusts in front of the Ponnukka grill. It first speeds Kitee‚Äôs main street one way and then another.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs pretty much as far as the road goes from here‚Ä¶‚Äù Tarja giggles.

Then she adds after a small pause:

‚ÄúThough that road would actually continue to who knows where.‚Äù

**Picture texts**

* ‚ÄúThis subculture does have chauvinism. I‚Äôve been treated very well though. I guess there‚Äôs a mix of fear and respect, because I‚Äôm a classical musician.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI remember my first singing lesson in Sibelius Academy,‚Äù Tarja Turunen tells. ‚ÄúMy teacher made my whole body chime. Certitude came like a lightning from a clear sky: This is what I want to do in my life!‚Äù",8,1750866375.0,TarjaTurunen,0,1.0,False

I opened the package and brewed the beans on my xbloom using the standard medium roast recipe.  And

It was delicious.  All of the notes were there - stone fruit, molasses with a nutty aftertaste. It checked all the boxes.

Maybe it's your breath hitching in your throat.

Maybe it's the sound of your own heartbeat turning into thunder. Or maybe it's the way the ground suddenly feels like it's tilting beneath your feet, and you're just... falling.

I wasn't supposed to be home tonight. My work trip to Boston was meant to last four days‚Äîstiff suits, bland hotel breakfasts, investor pitches. But I finished the presentation in half the time. Two days flat. Efficient. Strategic. I was proud.

I imagined Nathan's surprise when I walked through the door, maybe even a little turned on. I wanted to be spontaneous again. The wife who used to wake him with kisses, not reminders about dry cleaning.

So I went all out.

Merlot from the overpriced wine shop on 13th. The silky black nightgown he once said made me ""too tempting to function."" My heels in one hand, the wine in the other. My heart humming with hope, as I crept down the hallway of our apartment building, imagining the smile on his face.

The door creaked open with a gentle push. The living room, dim and bathed in the soft golden hue of the lamp, was wrong. Jazz played through the speakers. Nathan didn't even like jazz.

Something felt off.

I walked inside, my bare feet making no noise on the cold marble floor. The wine clinked softly in my hand as I moved closer ahead. The anticipation in my heart was strong‚Äînothing like the gladness I'd visualized.

Then I heard it.

A moan.

Low. Deep. Female.

I froze. My mind scrambled for an explanation. A movie? His phone? Maybe he fell asleep to something inappropriate? But then I heard his voice‚Äîclose, groaning.

And her again. Louder. More urgent. More intense

I dropped the wine.

The bottle broke, the red liquid content bleeding onto the marble floor like a wounded artery. I didn't even batter an eye.

Something inside me went dead.

I moved toward the bedroom, barely breathing. Each step felt heavier than the last. My fingers brushed the wall, searching for something solid to hold onto. But even the familiar texture of the paint felt foreign beneath my skin.

The door was slightly open, glowing with a sliver of golden light that spilled into the hallway like a secret. From inside, I heard it‚Äîsoft gasps, breathless and intimate. The rhythm of bodies moving in synchrony.

Whispers of pleasure, like prayers at an altar of desire.

I wanted to turn back. To pretend I was still outside with the wine, still holding onto hope like a fool with a gift in my hand and love on my tongue. But something pulled me forward.

The truth, maybe.

Or the cruel part of my heart that needed to know.

I pushed the door open.

And my world... stopped.

Time didn't slow‚Äîit fractured.

There he was. Nathan. The man who had once sworn his forever into my hands beneath the soft petals of springtime roses. The man whose laughter had filled our home, whose touch had once been the only thing that quieted my racing mind.

Now he was a stranger.

Naked. Moving. Drowned in the kind of s\*\*\*\*l drive that was supposed to belong to us‚Äînot borrowed, not stolen, not given away like an unbearable song. His back arched, muscles taut beneath a sheen of sweat dripping on his exerted body.

His hands held firmly to the sheets like he was holding onto life itself, knuckles white, desperate. And his mouth‚Äîoh My God‚Äîhis mouth was pressed into her soft delicate neck, tracing down her skin with a reverence that killed something sacred on my inside.

She held unto him as though they were meant to be, her body a perfect expression to his lustful desires. Legs tangled at his hips, hands holding unto his backside. She moved with him‚Äîfluid, fevered, soft‚Äîas if they had rehearsed every moment, like their bodies had desperately wanted to be in sync for far too long.

I stood stupefied, eyes wide open and mouth ajar. My lungs failed me, my body a vessel of nothing but shock and disbelief. The air around me felt too thin, too unconducive.

The sound of their intimacy, once soft, now rumbled in my ears, drowning out the pounding of my heart.

I didn't let tears drop down my cheek. Not yet. Tears required belief, and all I had was disbelief‚Äîpure, undiluted, suffocating. As though it was all a dream.

And then‚Äîshe turned.

Not fully. Just a part of her head, her eyes catching mine over Nathan's shoulder.

For a second, the world stopped spinning. Her face was a blur, but her eyes‚Äîshock, recognition, fear‚Äîflickered in them.

In a frantic movement, she shoved Nathan off her limbs, scrambling to cover herself. Nathan blinked, confused at first. His body still lost in pleasure, his gaze following hers‚Äîuntil it landed on me.

Everything changed in an instant.

He whispered my name, but it was too late. The damage had been done. The room, once ours, was now haunted, and I was the ghost.

""Don't,"" I choked, the words barely scraping past the rawness in my throat.

Nathan moved toward me, his eyes frantic, pleading. His mouth opened, but nothing came out. The woman‚Äîher‚Äîhad already fled, disappearing into the night.

I hadn't seen her face, but the memory of her desperate flight was burned into my mind, her body twisting as she scrambled to escape what she knew was about to happen. Something fell off from her body.

I didn't even notice the woman's hasty departure at first, too stunned by the scene in front of me.

But what fell off...

A silver bracelet‚Äîher silver bracelet‚Äîlay abandoned on the marble floor, like a cruel reminder of everything I hadn't wanted to know.

I reached down with trembling fingers, the cold metal biting into my skin as I grasped it, the weight of it pulling me back into the moment. The bracelet was still warm with the heat of her skin. It felt wrong in my hand‚Äîforeign, yet too familiar.

Nathan stepped forward, his face a mask of panic and regret. His voice cracked as he tried to find words, but they faltered before they could take shape. ""Jane... please, you didn't see her face."" His eyes darted between me and the floor, as if searching for some way to undo what had already been done.

""I... I can't tell you who she is. I‚Äî"" His words trailed off, a choked breath replacing any attempt at explanation.

His hesitation‚Äîhis complete lack of clarity‚Äîcut deeper than anything he could have said. The silence that followed was worse than any confession. It was the absence of understanding, the failure to recognize the depth of the damage.

I wanted to shout at him, to fling the bracelet at his chest and demand answers. But my body betrayed me. The only thing I could do was clutch the bracelet tighter, feeling the cold metal dig into my palm, grounding me in the wreckage of a life I never thought would fall apart. At least even if it would not in this manner.

Without uttering a word, I turned, each step heavy, like the floor itself was resisting me, pulling me back to that fractured moment. But I had to go. The dreadful silence in that room was too much, and as I stepped further away from him I knew deep within me that this situation was one that I couldn't salvage.

The one thing left in my palm was the cold, familiar bracelet‚Äîthe one that had fallen off the mystery woman.



# Chapter 2

(Jane's POV)

I didn't remember how I made it down the stairs‚Äîor how I ended up outside, the city's breath slapping me in the face. I think I ran, but my legs moved on their own. The cold night air whipped against my skin, but I didn't care.

I just kept going‚Äîbecause if I stopped, the weight of what I'd seen would crush me.

Taxi lights blurred by. Somewhere behind me, I thought I heard Nathan call my name‚Äîbut maybe it was in my head. I didn't look back.

I flagged down a taxi, told the driver to take me to the Musk Hotel. The ride was short. When we arrived, I paid the fare and walked straight to the entrance without hesitation. The doorman opened the brass-trimmed doors, and I stepped into another world‚Äîa cleaner, quieter one than the wreck I'd just left behind.

The lobby shimmered with light. Chandeliers hung like smug little stars, oblivious to my unraveling. My heels clicked against black marble, each step aching.

I pulled my coat tighter‚Äînot for warmth, but to keep from falling apart.

""Good evening, ma'am. Welcome to the Musk Suites. Do you have a reservation?"" the concierge asked with a polite smile.

I almost laughed. Reservation? As if anything in my life was planned.

""No,"" I said quietly. ""Just... an executive room. Somewhere secluded.""

He typed quickly, avoiding my eyes. Maybe it was the way I looked‚Äîcocktail dress, streaked mascara, the emptiness in my voice. Either way, he asked no questions and handed me the keycard.

Minutes later, I was inside a suite with giant windows overlooking the city.

Lights sparkled from distant towers, but I felt hollow. I dropped my purse, slid down the wall, and sat there‚Äîgasping. Not crying. Just gasping for air.

The silver bracelet burned in my palm.

I'd held it so tightly that it left angry impressions on my skin. Slowly, I uncurled my fingers and stared at it‚Äîsleek, delicate... familiar. I'd seen it before.

This wasn't some stranger's jewelry.

No, the woman who wore this‚Äîshe was someone I'd known.

Inside the band, etched in faint script, was a single word.

""To J. ‚Äì Forever.""

Forever......

The word echoed through my mind like a bad joke.

I let out a subtle laugh, then flinched at the sound. It was too loud. Too hurtful.

I stood and crossed the room, pouring myself a glass of water with shaking hands.

Then, without further thought, I dropped the bracelet on the golden hotel linen like it was an intriguing object. I stared at it, as though by so doing I would jug my memories as to whom it belonged to. Nothing came. No flashes. No revelations

Who was she?

What kind of woman slept with another woman's husband and left behind a token like a signature?

I paced through the right corner of my bed. Then stopped. Then sat. Then stood again.

""Get a grip of yourself, Jane,"" I muttered to myself. ""Think.""

But my thoughts were scattered‚Äîfragments of moments I didn't want to relive.

Nathan's eyes.

The way he hadn't chased after me.

The c\*\*\*k in his voice when he said, ""I can't tell you who she is.""

He was protecting her.

Why?

Maybe I should've paid closer attention to the woman as she fled‚Äîwatched how she moved, what she wore, anything that could've helped me identify her. But I hadn't. I was too overwhelmed, too broken in the moment to see clearly. And now all I had was a bitter question that refused to let me be.

I grabbed my phone, my fingers hovering over Nathan's name. I wanted to return his calls. I wanted to scream until he gave me answers. But what if he didn't? What if he gave me more silence?

No.

The screen lit up again‚Äîhis name flashing for the seventh time that night. He had been calling non-stop since I walked out. Each call I ignored was another nail in the coffin of what we once shared. I couldn't bring myself to answer. Not yet. Maybe never again.

Let him sit in the silence this time.

I needed to think. Strategize.

I opened the hotel's vanity drawer and pulled out a notepad. I wrote down the inscription. ""J."" That didn't narrow it much‚ÄîJanet, Jessica, Jasmine, Joanna. It could be anyone.

But the bracelet looked expensive and finely crafted. Custom-made. The clasp was unique, almost vintage. I took a photo, then flipped it over and studied the engraving again.

I needed help.

But who would I even tell?

I had no best friend to call.

My sister had been missing for over four years now‚ÄîI had no idea where she was, or if she was even still alive.

The irony hit me so hard, I nearly laughed.

No best friend. No sister.

No one.

The thought twisted my stomach into knots, so I pulled out my laptop and began a desperate search‚ÄîGoogling jewelry designers with similar clasps, scrolling through pages of images and obscure artisan websites.

Nothing matched. Nothing turned up in the first few minutes.

And I was already running on fumes.

A sharp knock on the door jolted me.

My heart leapt into my throat.

I wasn't expecting anyone.

""Room service,"" came a muffled voice.

""I didn't order anything,"" I said, my voice stern.

A brief pause. Then, ""Compliments of the Musk Suites. A small refreshment tray for our exclusive guests.""

I hesitated, then cracked the door open just enough to see a young man in a crisp uniform standing there with a silver tray. I stepped aside, letting him in, my eyes never leaving him as he placed it gently on the table.

""Need anything else, ma'am?""

""No. Thank you.""

He left with a polite nod, and I sank into the chair, staring at the untouched arrangement of fruit and sparkling water. Tucked beneath the edge of the glass was a folded note. My breath caught.

I picked it up.

But it was just a printed welcome message. Generic. Harmless.

I let out a shaky breath. I was getting paranoid.

I covered my face with both hands and groaned. Then I whispered, trying to anchor myself to something that made sense.

""Okay. Tomorrow. You'll go to that custom jewelry store on Freedom Drive. Someone has to know where this bracelet came from.""

Even as I spoke it aloud, the words felt like a fragile thread‚Äîsomething to cling to in the wake of everything that had unraveled.

But the ache was already setting into my bones.

A slow, gnawing grief. Not just for the betrayal.

But for the life I thought I had‚Äîthe marriage, the trust, the warmth of knowing someone and being known.

Gone.

I lay on the bed in the soft dim light, the bracelet beside me on the pillow. Its surface gleamed like a secret in the dark. I stared at the ceiling, listening to the muted hum of the city outside the window, wishing I could silence the storm inside me.

At some point, when sleep refused to come, I whispered the question that had been clawing at me since the moment it all fell apart.

""Why me?""

The silence didn't answer.

Only the bracelet shimmered in response.

Just as I reached for it again, my phone buzzed on the nightstand.

Nathan.

This time, it wasn't a call. It was a message.

Jane,

I know you won't take my calls, and I understand why. I don't deserve your voice after what I did. I don't know what to say that could ever undo what you saw, what you felt.

But please believe this‚ÄîI am sorry. From the deepest part of me. Not just for the act, but for the lies, the silence, the pain I caused you.

I've been sitting here, drowning in guilt, knowing I can't fix it. And maybe that's the worst part‚Äîrealizing I destroyed something beautiful because I was too weak to face the truth myself.

Maybe it's best we go our separate ways. Maybe the divorce will give us both the peace we can't seem to find together anymore.

But I will always regret this. And I will always remember you as the best part of my life.

Please take care of yourself. You deserve more than I ever gave.

‚ÄîNathan

I stared at the screen long after the message faded.

Hot tears streaming down my cheeks...........



# Chapter 3

(Jane's POV)

I stared at the screen long after the message faded, spit trailing down my mouth as hot tears streamed down my cheeks, smudging the already ruined mascara. My fingers clenched around the phone, knuckles aching.

""Maybe the divorce will give us both the peace...""

The words hung in the air like the stench of something decayed.

It was one thing to be lied to, to walk in on the man you swore you could vouch for buried in someone else's arms. But this?

This was him giving up.

And maybe that was what hurt the most.

Not the act itself‚Äî

But how easily he was unwilling to take responsibility for his actions.

If anyone should be asking for a divorce, it ought to be me. I'm the one who's been hurt here.

I paced the room like a woman on the brink‚Äîsix steps to the window, six steps back. The city glittered beneath me in a thousand indifferent lights, each mocking my unraveling sanity. Just outside my door, the faint murmur of heels clicking and laughter echoed through the hallway.

""Girl, I swear Club Mevron is just a block from here,"" one woman's voice drifted through the corridor.

""Ugh, thank God. I need a drink and a distraction,"" another giggled.

I stood stupefied. Club Mevron. A block away.

A distraction.

It wasn't a plan. It was an impulse. And right now, that was all I had.

I didn't think‚Äîdidn't want to. I grabbed my clutch, slipped into the red cocktail dress I'd never worn, and left the hotel like my sanity depended on it.

The night air slapped me in the face, but it was better than the heaviness weighing down inside me. The doorman barely glanced up as I stepped onto the sidewalk and followed the pulsating sound of bass and laughter down the street.

Five minutes later, I pushed through the gilded doors of Club Mevron.

The bass thrummed through the walls like a second heartbeat. Velvet lounges, silver-trimmed tables, and mirrored ceilings gave the place an illusion of grandeur‚Äîlike money had dressed up pain and called it a party.

I slipped into a booth at the far end. The red dress clung to me firmly, putting my curves on full display. I didn't care how many people stared. Let them. Let them wonder what kind of woman comes alone to a place like this‚Äîeyes dead, lips tight.

""Double gin. No lime,"" I told the bartender when he stopped in front of me.

He raised an eyebrow, probably noticing the damage. ""Rough night?""

I laughed‚Äîhollow, sharp. ""You could say that again.""

He didn't press. Just nodded and slid the glass toward me.

I downed the first sip like it owed me something. The burn hit hard, and I welcomed it. It was familiar, the kind of pain I could control. I wasn't the type to drink like this, but right now, my body felt like a stranger's.

Within minutes, two men approached. Slick suits. Colognes that screamed distaste.

""Hey there, pretty thing,"" the first one drawled. ""What's a beauty like you doing all alone tonight?""

""Plotting a murder,"" I said flatly.

They laughed‚Äîone nervously, the other still cocky. ""Feisty. I like that.""

""I don't like you,"" I snapped, eyes flashing. ""Now run along before I pour this drink on your stupid face.""

They got the message. Mumbled something about 'crazy women' and drifted away.

I ordered another drink.

""You really do know how to clear a room.""

The voice came from behind me‚Äîdeep, amused, male.

I turned.

A man stood there, tall, rugged in a suit that didn't try too hard. He didn't smile like the others. He watched me like he already knew the story.

""And you are?"" I asked, eyebrow raised.

""Andrew,"" he said. ""Andrew Dole.""

The name clicked in my head like a drawer I'd long forgotten slamming open.

""Nathan's friend?"" I asked, blinking harder now, trying to focus on the man sitting across from me.

The club lights shimmered off the whiskey in his glass, off the sharp edge of his jawline. Everything about him was too put-together for someone supposedly estranged.

He gave a wry smile, the kind that suggested history‚Äîdeep, bitter, complicated. ""Used to be. Childhood friend, yes. 'Estranged' would be the polite term now.""

I narrowed my eyes. ""And you just happened to be here tonight?""

""No,"" he slid into the booth without asking, the scent of something expensive and dangerous trailing behind him. ""I saw you walk in. Recognized you immediately. Couldn't resist.""

I scoffed. ""Well, congratulations. You found the broken wife.""

""No,"" he said, voice softer, deliberate. ""I found the woman he didn't deserve.""

That silenced me.

I stared at him. He stared back.

Something in the way he looked at me‚Äîsteady, unflinching‚Äîmade me feel seen in a way Nathan never had, not even on our best days. And that terrified me. ""How much do you know?"" I whispered, my voice barely above the pulse of the music.

He tilted his head, eyes dark with something unreadable. ""Not enough to have all the pieces... just enough to know you shouldn't be here alone.""

I narrowed my gaze. ""That's not an answer.""

He shrugged, sipping his drink. ""Nathan and I haven't spoken in years, but people talk. And when they do, they talk to me. Your name came up. Rumors. Whispers. Something about a woman storming out of the Frank estate......""

I blinked back another wave of dizziness‚Äîequal parts alcohol and emotion. ""So what, you came to play knight in shining armor?""

He leaned in, close enough for his cologne to drown the rest of the room. ""No. I came because I know exactly what betrayal tastes like. And because I figured... you might want someone who understands. Even if only for tonight.""

He smirked, the kind that made it impossible to tell if he was flirting or scheming.

""By the way, I have a proposition for you.""

That pulled me back to full alert. ""A proposition?""

He swirled the amber liquid in his glass, eyes never leaving mine. ""More like a contract. Between you and me. One that could change everything‚Äîif you're willing to play.""

I tilted my head, the gin buzzing beneath my skin. ""I'm listening...""

He leaned in, elbows on the table, his voice smooth but firm. ""We get married. For two years. Publicly. Legally. The whole deal.""

I blinked. Then laughed‚Äîa short, breathless sound. ""You're joking.""

""I'm not.""

""You want to marry me?"" I asked, barely believing the words coming out of my mouth.

""Not out of love,"" he said quickly, eyes never leaving mine. ""This is strategy. Optics. Leverage.""

""Against Nathan?""

""Partly,"" he admitted. ""But it's more than that. You need protection right now‚Äîreal protection. Nathan's got resources, connections, lawyers who would bleed you dry in a real divorce. I have more power than he realizes. We use my name, my assets, my reputation. You become untouchable.""

I stared at him, my mind racing back to Nathan's text. ""And in return?""

He didn't flinch. ""You help me break into the circle Nathan's spent years protecting. His investors, his board, his empire. He's not as clean as he pretends. I've been gathering proof. But I need someone close to him.

Someone he still watches... obsesses over.""

""Me,"" I murmured.

He nodded. ""You were always the part of his life he couldn't fully control. Now, you'll be the key to bringing him down.""

My stomach swirled with the alcohol and the weight of his words. ""So... I'd be your pawn.""

""No,"" he said softly, brushing a strand of hair from my face with an ease that sent a flutter through my throat. ""You'd be my partner.""

I stared at him, stupefied. ""Two years?""

""Two years,"" he said. ""After that, we part ways. Cleanly. No pressure. No strings. But by then... you'll be standing stronger than ever.""

For a moment, neither of us moved.

Then Andrew reached for my hand‚Äînot boldly, but gently, like he was testing if I'd flinch.

I didn't. ""Why are you doing this?"" I whispered, my voice barely above the pulse of the music. ""You barely know me.""

He didn't break eye contact. His thumb moved in slow, feather-light strokes over my knuckles, grounding me in a moment I hadn't expected to need.

""Because I've been where you are,"" he said quietly. ""And because... I think you deserve someone in your corner. Someone who isn't trying to fix or claim you. Just‚Äîsee you.""

My throat tightened.

A part of me wanted to pull away, retreat into the safety of sarcasm or silence. But another part‚Äîone weary from pretending to be okay‚Äîleaned forward.

Our lips met, tentative at first. No urgency. No fire.

Just warmth.

Just human.

He cupped my jaw, fingers trailing behind my ear, and I let myself sink into the kiss‚Äîsoft, steady, like the kind that whispered you're safe here.

For one breathless moment, Nathan didn't exist.

The betrayal didn't exist.

Even the bracelet

I'd found didn't exist.

It was just him and me.

And the quiet question hovering between us.

But just as I let myself begin to breathe‚Äî

BUZZZZZ.

The phone vibrated on the table, loud against the polished glass.

I glanced down.

\[CALLER ID: JULIA\]

My breath caught in my throat.

No.

No, no, no.

This had to be a dream.



# Chapter 4

(Jane's POV)

Moments earlier, I'd left the club in a haze. The music still pulsed faintly in my ears, but it was Andrew's proposition that refused to let go. It looped in my head like a drunken lullaby‚Äîuninvited, inescapable.

A contract.

A public strike. A calculated blow to Nathan's pride. Not just emotional revenge, but surgical. Wounding. And the worst part? It tempted me. Andrew had walked me back to the suite, his presence hovering like a ghost behind me, silent but thick with unspoken words.

I could barely recall the elevator ride. My thoughts were already unraveling.

At the door, he paused.

""I'll leave you to think about it, Jane."" His voice was soft, a thread of understanding beneath the edge.

""You know where to find me.""

I nodded‚Äîor maybe I didn't. I couldn't be sure. Once inside, I shut the door and sagged against it, as if the room itself might collapse under the weight I carried. My heels hit the floor with a sharp thud. I didn't bother turning on the lamps.

The room's overhead light blinked on automatically, sterile and too bright, washing over me like an interrogation. I reached for the bottle of wine on the nightstand. Half gone.

With clumsy fingers, I poured another glass, barely catching the spill as it sloshed over the rim. I took a deep gulp, then another. My lips were already stained, my tongue too loose in my mouth. Everything was warm. Fuzzy.

The wine didn't dull the ache in my chest. It only made the questions louder.

What the hell was I doing?

I collapsed onto the bed, face pressed to the pillow. Maybe I cried. Maybe I just laid there breathing hard. The alcohol made it hard to tell.

My body felt like it was floating, but my mind was drowning‚Äîdragged under by everything I didn't want to face.

Nathan. The lies. The end of us.

And Andrew's offer, whispered like sin in a dark booth, now echoing like a dare.

I turned my head and stared blankly at the desk across the room. My vision blurred, cleared, blurred again. Something glinted there. Caught my eye.

The bracelet.

God. That damned bracelet.

It was half-hidden beneath a notepad, but I saw it. I felt it. A small, twisted reminder of a woman I still hadn't identified.

The woman who ran. The woman Nathan had touched like he used to touch me.

I sat up‚Äîtoo fast. The room tilted, spinning sideways in a lazy spiral. I laughed under my breath, low and bitter.

Of course I was drunk.

But not drunk enough to forget that‚Äîthe way he touched her‚Äîthe way he used to touch me.

I thought Nathan's breakup text would be the end. The end of the pain. The questions. The search.

But I was wrong. So very wrong.

I stumbled toward the desk, one hand brushing the wall for balance. When I picked the bracelet up, it was ice against my fingertips. Delicate. Ornate. Too familiar.

I held it up. Squinted. My head buzzed as I turned it over in my palm. The pattern. The clasp. It tugged at Something about the bracelet tugged at me‚Äîburied deep in memory, like d√©j√† vu wearing someone else's face.

Then the weight of it hit me, full-force, like a bad aroma curling around my spine.

Had I seen it before?

No... Had I worn it before?

The question snaked through my foggy mind, refusing to let go. And then my phone buzzed again.

I jumped.

It lit up on the nightstand beside the half-empty wine glass, the vibration slicing through the silence.

Julia.

Again.

I blinked at the screen, disoriented. For a second, it felt like I was dreaming agian‚Äîlike the alcohol had conjured her from the depths of my guilt, my questions, my rage.

I had tried to pick up earlier, back at the club. But the line cut. When I called back, it rang once, then nothing. Dead air. Unreachable.

Now, her name was blinking at me again.

My thumb hovered above the screen. My heart stuttered. We hadn't spoken in four years.

.

I called her back.

""Jane?"" Her voice was tentative, breathy, like a child testing water with her toes.

""Julia..."" I whispered. ""Are you okay?"" A long silence stretched between us. ""I think we should talk. Face to face.""

\*\*

And now, I stood at the open-air atrium of the Victoria Galleria, watching shoppers pass with the kind of ease I hadn't known in weeks. Caf√© Brago sat nestled in the corner, with jasmine hanging from the trellis and soft acoustic music floating from the speakers. It was the kind of place Julia would choose.

Pretentious, but private. She was already there. White blouse. Pale denim. Sunglasses perched atop a chestnut-colored bob she hadn't worn when we were twenty-five.

Her posture was almost... fragile. And when she saw me, she stood quickly‚Äîtoo quickly‚Äîand her smile wavered like it didn't quite belong on her face. ""Jane,"" she breathed. I didn't speak at first. I just stared. Four years without a single word. Not a birthday call. Not even a postcard. And yet... her arms opened. I stepped in.

Not because forgiveness came easily. But because part of me needed this too‚Äîneeded to remember that I had family. That something once broken might not be shattered. When we sat, it was stiff. Awkward. We ordered coffees just to have something to stir.

""You look..."" she trailed off.

""Tired?"" I offered. She smiled faintly. ""Stronger."" ""You still live in the city?""

""Coming from you, that sounds like a strange question.""

""I didn't even know you were back,"" I said. ""I thought you were in Spain.""

""I was. Madrid. Then Barcelona. But I came home six months ago.""

Six months. I blinked. ""You didn't think to call?""

Her face flinched. ""I did. A thousand times. I just... didn't.""

I didn't press it. I stirred my coffee. ""I'm sorry about your marriage,"" she said after a beat. ""I heard... something happened?""

My eyes flicked up to hers. ""Yeah. Something.""

""I won't ask if you don't want to talk about it.""

""Thanks."" I paused. ""But yeah. I came home early from a trip and caught Nathan in bed with someone.""

Julia went still. The straw in her drink stopped moving.

""I'm so sorry,"" she said, softer now. ""God. Jane...""

""Don't be. It's done."" ""Do you know who it was?"" I shook my head. ""She ran. All I got was a glimpse and this bracelet.""

""Bracelet?"" Her voice cracked the tiniest bit. I reached into my bag and pulled it out.

Silver. Feminine. Still cold somehow, like betrayal had left its fingerprints on it.

She stared. I watched her face for any sign. Any reaction.

But all I got was a long blink and a nod.

""Pretty,"" she said, her voice just above a whisper. ""Delicate.""

""Makes me sick to look at it,"" I muttered, slipping it back into my bag.

We talked for a while longer. About Mom. About growing up. About how things fell apart between us after Dad's funeral. It was strange. Surreal. Like patching up cracks in a wall that was still on fire.

Then she checked her watch.

""I should go,"" she said. ""I have‚Äî""

""Julia,"" I cut in. She looked up. ""I'm glad you called.""

Her eyes glistened. ""I almost didn't. But I couldn't carry it anymore.""

""Carry what?""

Her lips parted.

She hesitated.

And then‚Äî

""The bracelet is mine""

""I was the one,"" she whispered. ""In the house. That night. With Nathan.""



# Chapter 5

(Jane's POV)

""I was the one,"" Julia muttered. ""In the house. That night. With Nathan.""

The clink of glasses, the hum of quiet conversations, and the soft jazz floating from the ceiling speakers all seemed to collapse into a heavy silence. The air inside Caf√© Brago thickened, pressing in around me until I could only hear the slow, thunderous beat of my heart, pounding louder than everything else.

I stared at her.

Not blinking. Not breathing.

The coffee in my cup had become cold, barely touched. My fingers trembled slightly over the porcelain handle, but I remained motionless. My joints have failed me. My body clenched as if to keep me from cracking wide open.

Julia's eyes did not look at mine.

They drifted just below, on the table, on the floor, or anywhere else but my face.

I opened my mouth, but words failed me. Julia shifted in her seat. She appeared... lighter, as if she had just unloaded a boulder. My pain, it seemed, was her freedom.

""I should go,"" she said, reaching for her bag.

Is that it? What? No explanation? No apologies?

Could it be that I'm dreaming?

I still couldn't speak. My tongue felt like sandpaper, my chest locked tight in a corset of disbelief.

She stood. Straightened her White blouse. Her hands fidgeted for a second before she glanced toward the caf√© exit.

""I only came to offload the weight of what I've done.""

She turned.

And just like that, she left.

I didn't follow her. I didn't call out. I just sat there, frozen, watching as she walked away. She didn't look back. Not once. Her dress caught the wind like a whisper, trailing behind her as she walked away.

I sat still, trapped in the aftermath of her revelation, until a sweet voice broke through the fog.

""Ma'am... Are you alright?""

I blinked. A waitress stood by the table's edge, concern on her brow, her tray loosely held at her side. She must have noticed me sitting there, motionless, long after the last sip of coffee had gone cold.

""I‚Äî"" My voice caught in my throat.

I swallowed hard. ""Yes. I'm good.""

She didn't look convinced, but she nodded anyway and stepped away with quiet understanding.

I reached for my purse with hands that barely felt like mine. Sliding a few bills onto the table‚Äîfar more than the coffee was worth‚Äî I rose slowly, as if my body had aged in minutes, each movement stiff with the weight of her confession. My coat felt heavier now as I cinched it tightly around me, as if it could protect me from the reality that had just broken quietly between two cups of coffee.

Then, without looking back, I walked out of Caf√© Brago and into the thinning afternoon, the city swallowing me whole.

I didn't know where else to go but back to The Musk Hotel‚Äîthe one place that had become both a torment and a refuge since the day everything fell apart. I barely recalled the elevator ride to the executive wing of the hotel. My body moved on its own, numb fingers pressing the button, eyes fixed on the glowing numbers as they ascended‚Äîeach floor a quiet scream echoing inside my head.

The familiar faded-gold hallway. The smell of musk and soft pine that gave the hotel its name. My hand trembled as I unlocked the door and stepped into the room, the soft thud of the door behind me finally snapping the silence.

She was the one. Julia.

My twin. My blood. My mirror.

I sat on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor, with the bracelet‚Äîher bracelet‚Äîstill nestled in my bag like a silent traitor. My chest felt hollow, as if someone had scooped the air out and left just weight. It wasn't anger. Not yet. Just a dense, unwinding anguish that began in my stomach and expanded outward, slowly and heavily.

I leaned back on the cushions, staring at the ceiling. That's when the memories began to rush in.

We were eight the first time Julia tricked me and laughed about it for hours. I had a presentation at school, and she swapped my cue cards with a handwritten list of boy names and ""secret crushes."" I stood in front of the entire class, reading it out loud‚Äîutterly confused, until I saw her in the back row, doubled over in laughter.

""Why would you do that?"" I had cried later that day, humiliated.

Her answer was a shrug. ""You take things too seriously, Janey. It was funny.""

No apology. Just a smile, like she lived in a different moral climate than the rest of us.

When we were thirteen, I remember us sitting in the attic of Grandma Kathrine's old beach house during summer. We were painting our nails black and talking about the future.

""I want to be famous,"" Julia had said, waving her wet fingers. ""Not like a movie star, famous. Just... impossible to forget.""

""You already are,"" I replied.

She smirked. ""No. You are. You're the golden girl. Always polite. Always safe. Teachers love you, boys worship you. I'm just... the sidekick with attitude.""

""You're not a sidekick.""

""Maybe,"" she'd said, leaning back. ""But I'd rather be the villain than the shadow.""",1,1750866153.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Witty Analysis & Data-Driven Prediction: Nashville Sounds vs. Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp**  
*By The Handicapper Who Still Believes in Math (Mostly)*

---

**The Setup**  
The Nashville Sounds, fresh off an 11-game unbeaten streak and a 7-1-0 run in their last eight, are the clear favorites here. They‚Äôve scored **at least three runs in four of their last five games**, and both teams have scored in all but one of those. Meanwhile, the Jumbo Shrimp? They‚Äôre the underdog, which means they‚Äôre statistically *41% more likely to win* than their odds suggest. Coincidence? Probably not. But let‚Äôs not get ahead of ourselves.

**Injury Notes: A Red Herring (Mostly)**  
The Brewers‚Äô injury updates (Woodruff‚Äôs return, Mitchell‚Äôs shoulder woes) are as relevant to this game as a toaster in a chess match. However, **Blake Perkins**, Nashville‚Äôs Triple-A affiliate, is set to debut for the Sounds. If he‚Äôs a starter (and let‚Äôs assume he is), his performance could swing the game. But given Nashville‚Äôs recent dominance, even a shaky debut might not derail their offensive machine.

**The Odds Breakdown**

* **Moneyline**: Nashville (-1.5) at **1.62** (BetOnline.ag), Jacksonville (+1.5) at **2.24**.
* **Total**: Over/Under **7.5 runs** at **1.78-1.98** (Over) and **1.83-1.91** (Under).

**Key Stats**

* Nashville has scored **3+ runs in 80% of their last five games**.
* Jacksonville has allowed **2.8 runs per game** over their last 10.
* The Sounds‚Äô offense is clicking: **44% of their games this season have gone Over 7.5 runs**.

**Calculating Expected Value (EV)**

1. **Nashville Moneyline**: Implied probability = **61.7%** (1 / 1.62).
   * Historical context: Nashville‚Äôs actual win rate vs. weak opponents? **72%** (last 10 games).
   * EV = (0.72 \* 0.62) - (0.28 \* 1) = **+4.6%**.
2. **Over 7.5 Runs**: Implied probability = **54.6%** (1 / 1.83).
   * Historical context: 80% of Nashville‚Äôs last five games hit Over 7.5.
   * EV = (0.8 \* 0.78) - (0.2 \* 1) = **+40.4%**.
3. **Jacksonville +1.5 Spread**: Implied probability = **44.6%** (1 / 2.24).
   * Underdog win rate in baseball = **41%**. Not enough to justify the risk.

**The Verdict**  
**Best Bet: Over 7.5 Runs at 1.83 (BetRivers)**  
Why? Because Nashville‚Äôs offense is a **goal-scoring machine**, and Jacksonville‚Äôs pitching? Let‚Äôs just say they‚Äôre not the Yankees‚Äô rotation. With Perkins debuting (and likely not shutting anyone down), this game is primed to be a high-scoring affair. The EV is sky-high here, and the data screams ‚ÄúOver.‚Äù

**Honorable Mention**: Nashville -1.5 at 1.62 (if you‚Äôre feeling spicy). But the Over is the safer, more profitable play.

**Final Joke**  
If you bet on the Under, I hope your coffee tastes like regret. But hey, at least you‚Äôll have a story to tell when the Sounds hit eight runs.

I haven‚Äôt even graduated yet.‚ÄùShe‚Äôs cute when she‚Äôs flustered. My lips twitch up on their own. ‚ÄúYour internship ends in two days. You‚Äôve graduated.

I‚Äôm healthy, attractive, and wealthy.‚Äù‚ÄúYou‚Äôre also a workaholic and narcissistic.‚Äù Her hand covers her mouth lightning fast, and her cheeks turn red. I raise my eyebrow.

After a breath she raises her head, ‚ÄúMy boyfriend‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have one.‚Äù I cut her off before she can say anything stupid. ‚ÄúYou work at my side every day and you are graduating next weekend. You don‚Äôt have time for a boyfriend. Also, the only pictures on your desk are of a girl your age, I‚Äôm assuming is the best friend, and an older gentleman I assume is your father. The only personal calls you take are from the VA Hospital.‚Äù Her eyes grow larger and she‚Äôs not sitting as straight.I stand up and walk around my desk. I sit on the coffee table in front of her, my legs sandwich hers. I lean into her personal space. She doesn‚Äôt move back. If anything, she sits up even straighter and raises her chin. Her brown eyes stare back confidentially. Interesting. Her fragrance is mild and sweet, it‚Äôs almost intoxicating. I speak to her with a gentle voice. ‚ÄúJulia. This is as awkward for me as it is for you. I will make you a deal. You take this marriage seriously for one year, just one. At the end of the year, we can separate. In the meantime, I will pay off all of your student loans and your Father‚Äôs medical expenses. You live with me in luxury. You can spend all the money you want. You can redecorate our home to make it more comfortable for you. I promise to be faithful to you. All I need in return is for you to be by my side in a respectable manner. This includes attending events and dealing with any paparazzi. I‚Äôll even throw in some shares when it‚Äôs all over if you want. Deal?""She looks down in thought and subtly bites her lip. I wonder what that lip feels like between my teeth. She looks back to my eyes. ‚ÄúWhat about six?‚ÄùMy lips and my eyebrow twist up of their own accord. ‚ÄúAlright, but I‚Äôm scheduled for a meeting later on.‚ÄùHer face turns scarlet red. ‚ÄúTh-that‚Äôs not‚Ä¶what I meant.‚ÄùI can‚Äôt help but smile at her embarrassment. I place my hand on her soft cheek. Her breath catches. ‚ÄúI will not force myself on you. I don‚Äôt expect anything from you. But understand, that doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt try. We are man and wife after all.‚Äù My thumb caresses her bottom lip. ‚ÄúDo we have a deal?‚Äù She slowly nods her head. ‚ÄúGood. Now, what‚Äôs my name?‚ÄùShe bites at her lip again. I wonder if it‚Äôs a nervous habit of hers. ‚ÄúFredrick,‚Äù she softly says. I lose all control at the sound of my name on her lips. My lips brush against hers. They‚Äôre soft and yield to me. I pull her bottom lip in between my teeth and bite down softly. Her lips are like a drug, and I need more. She‚Äôs responsive and doesn‚Äôt push me away. She lets me kiss her. My tongue licks her lips seeking entry. Her mouth slightly opens, and I seize the opportunity. My tongue dives in. Her taste is like heaven. Her tongue caresses mine ever so gently, like she‚Äôs testing the waters. My office phone rings, and she pulls away. I grunt and walk to my desk to answer the phone. ‚ÄúDraven."" I watch her as she smooths out her clothes and takes a drink of water. She points to the door and walks out closing the door behind her.‚ÄúWho the hell do you think you are! You‚Äôve humiliated my daughter then you have the nerve to throw her out of my building! If it wasn‚Äôt for your father, I would have already handled you. What is the meaning of this!‚ÄùI wait for him to finish his tirade. ‚ÄúBaker. It‚Äôs so good to hear from you. First of all, let‚Äôs clear a few things up. I hold the majority of shares and purchased the building outright. It‚Äôs my building. Now that I get more share for being married, I plan to buy you out. Also, your daughter came into my office and created a scene. I warned her to leave on her own, she chose not to listen to me.‚Äù‚ÄúYou son of a batch. You think you can muscle me out! You break my daughter‚Äôs heart and have the nerve to blame her.‚ÄùI roll my eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to muscle you out. I‚Äôll give you a fair price. And don‚Äôt worry about your daughter‚Äôs heart, it was never really love. She is just addicted to the lifestyle and status I gave her. She‚Äôll get over it.‚Äù I hang up. Enough of that bullshei.\*\*\*Julia‚Äôs POV:I sit at my desk and read my email. My contract is weighing on my mind. Everything has changed in one afternoon. I send‚Ä¶Fredrick‚Ä¶a text. Mr. Draven. Does the offer to be your assistant still stand? I hit send and wait for a response, which comes almost instantly.Only if you use my name.I roll my eyes. I‚Äôm trying to be professional here, Mr. Draven.He instantly responds. Mrs. Draven, you only need to be professional in front of other people. And yes, the offer still stands. Now, what‚Äôs my name?I give in, after all he is being rather generous. Okay, I‚Äôll sign the contract right away. Thank you, Fredrick.I finish my tasks for the day then head down to the HR on the first floor. I sign my contract without making any changes.I head over to the hospital to visit my Dad. Dr. Torres stops me in the hall. ‚ÄúMs. Lewis. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here. Your father is being transferred to another facility, so I need you to sign the paperwork.‚ÄùI look at the papers in confusion. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on? Why is he being transferred?‚ÄùDr. Torres taps his pen on the clipboard, ‚ÄúWe got a phone call earlier from a man that said he‚Äôs your husband. I thought he was trying to cause problems, but he paid off all the medical fees here and at the new facility. He‚Äôll be closer to you and at a better place. I practice at the other facility as well, so I‚Äôll continue providing his care over there.‚Äù I sign the necessary paperwork then walk to my father‚Äôs room.‚ÄúHi Daddy. How are you feeling today? Is your back still sore?‚ÄùDad smiles at me. I love it when he smiles because his eyes crinkle at the corners. He looks like an older version of Magnum P.I. but with short hair. Mustache included. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better today. Dr. Torres says I‚Äôm being transferred? What‚Äôs going on? Tell me everything.‚ÄùI hold my father‚Äôs good hand and smile. ‚ÄúI got the job as Mr. Draven‚Äôs assistant. I signed the contract today.‚ÄùMy dad looks at me and raises his eyebrow. ‚ÄúI know you have more to tell me. I can see it on your face. Give it to me.‚ÄùI sit down on the bed. ‚ÄúRemember how I went to Vegas?‚Äù My dad nods and I continue ‚ÄúWell, while I was there, I ended up marrying my boss. We were both inebriated and don‚Äôt remember a thing. We found out today when Mr. Draven went to get a marriage license.‚ÄùDad grunts. ‚ÄúAnd you plan on staying married to him?‚Äù I nod. My dad doesn‚Äôt say anything. So, I explain the deal we made. ‚ÄúGirl, I know you‚Äôre worried about me, but I‚Äôm fine as long as I have you in my life. You‚Äôre all that matters to me. I want you to be happy. If this guy disrespects you in any way, you get out of it, you hear?‚ÄùI nod, ‚Äúyes, of course. I promise. I have to go now; we‚Äôre supposed to have dinner. I‚Äôll visit you when you get all settled in at the new place.‚Äù I kiss my dad‚Äôs scruffy cheek and wave goodbye.

**Chapter 4**

I walk through the door of the fanciest restaurant ever. I‚Äôm still wearing my clothes from work, but it‚Äôs a skirt so who cares. I did remove my glasses though. I go to the hostess ‚ÄúMr. Draven‚Äôs table please?‚Äù The hostess leads me to a back room with fewer tables that are more private. With the exception of the wait staff, I‚Äôm alone in the dark and intimate room.‚ÄúCan I get you a drink, miss?‚Äù the waiter asks.I smile, ‚Äúdo you have strawberry lemonade?‚Äù The waiter nods and walks away. I check my watch. I‚Äôm a few minutes early, but Mr. Draven is a punctual person. I look over the menu while I wait. There are fancy dishes that I‚Äôve never heard of. What catches my eye the most is that there are no prices.‚ÄúHave you been waiting long?"" Fredrick sits across from me.‚ÄúNot at all. I‚Äôve only ordered a drink.‚Äù The waiter brings my lemonade and a drink for Fredrick. He must have ordered it when he walked in. Fredrick unbuttons his suit jacket but leaves it on. He pulls out the black ring box. ‚ÄúI would like you to wear your ring so other men know you are off limits.‚Äù I guess that‚Äôs a reasonable request. I slip it on. My hand feels noticeably heavier. The waiter comes over to take our orders. I pick up the menu again. I can feel Fredrick watching me. I glance at him, and he smirks. I haven‚Äôt made up my mind when I hear ‚Äúthe usual"" from Fredrick.I place the menu down ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the usual?‚ÄùHe takes a quick drink his eyes never leave my face. ‚ÄúBeef Wellington and scotch.‚ÄùI nod ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have the Wellington also, no scotch for me.‚Äù The waiter leaves with our orders. ‚ÄúI want to thank you for taking care of my father.‚ÄùFredrick shakes his head, ‚ÄúIt was part of the deal.‚ÄùI sip my lemonade, ‚ÄúNo, it wasn‚Äôt. Paying off the medical debt, yes. But moving him to a closer, better, facility was not. So, again, thank you.‚ÄùHe nods, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre welcome.‚ÄùThe silence feels awkward, so I think of a new topic. ‚ÄúYou must come here pretty often.‚ÄùHe raises his eyebrow, ‚Äúwhy do you say that?‚ÄùI give him my duh look, ‚Äúthe usual? I wonder how many other people have a usual.‚ÄùHe shrugs his shoulder, ‚Äúit‚Äôs the best.""The waiter brings our food, and it looks amazing, like a dish you see on the celebrity chef cooking shows. ‚ÄúAre you going to take a picture of it?‚Äù Fredrick asks.‚ÄúWhy would I take a picture of it?‚Äù weirdo.‚ÄúSo, you can post it.‚Äù He puts a bite into his mouth.‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather just eat it,‚Äù I say as I take a bite. My mouth dances with flavor, no wonder it‚Äôs his usual. The meat is tender and juicy. I‚Äôm practically humming, it is that good. I almost want to close my eyes and focus just on the food in my mouth. In no time I‚Äôve already eaten one of the two pieces on my plate. I take a sip of my lemonade and quickly regret it.I must have made a noise or a face because Fredrick asks, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong?‚ÄùI wipe my mouth before answering, ‚Äúmy lemonade, it tastes funky with the Wellington.‚ÄùFredrick signals for the waiter. ‚ÄúWhat would you like instead?‚ÄùI bite my lip. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. What goes good with it?‚Äù Fredrick raises his glass and gives me his duh face. I crinkle my nose and shake my head.‚ÄúPerhaps try a red wine.‚ÄùI shake my head again, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt drink alcohol. A dear friend of mine was killed by a drunk driver, so I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù Fredrick nods his head in understanding. In the end I settle with water.Our meal goes by smoothly. We chat about random things. Fredrick is 28 and was raised by his father. His mother was a model and she left to pursue her career, before overdosing on crack. He took over the business from his father when he was 22. I tell him about my Dad. He's a Lieutenant Colonel. He finished 3 tours in Iraq and Afghanistan before my mother left him because of his PTSD. He was undiagnosed and was able to take another tour, where he took shrapnel to his spine. He‚Äôs paralyzed from the waist down and one of his arms is weak. His mental health is what keeps him in the facility. The VA covers most of his medical Bill‚Äôs, but not all of it.‚ÄúWhen do I get to meet him?‚Äù Fredrick asks.‚ÄúWhenever you want. I‚Äôm hoping he‚Äôll be able to attend my graduation next weekend, but I‚Äôve been having trouble getting him a power chair and a nurse to accompany him.‚ÄùOur meal is finished, and I can‚Äôt eat another bite. ‚ÄúWould you like to order dessert?‚Äù Fredrick asks.I wave my hand. ‚ÄúNo way, I‚Äôm stuffed.‚Äù I look at his plate. ‚ÄúI even ate more than you. You must think I‚Äôm a pig.‚ÄùA small smile appears on his gorgeous face. ‚ÄúOn the contrary, I think you just enjoyed your meal.‚ÄùI nod. ‚ÄúYou were right, it is the best.‚ÄùHe stands up. ‚ÄúShall we?‚Äù I stand up and he holds out his elbow for me to take. He leads me out to a flashy BMW M4 in pristine condition. He opens my door like a gentleman. ‚ÄúWould you like to go to our place so you can see where you‚Äôll be staying?‚ÄùThe sly dog. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay. I can wait. I need to start packing anyway.‚Äù He heads off to my place. I don‚Äôt have to give directions; he seems to already know where to go. We arrive at my building, and he parks the car.‚ÄúI‚Äôll walk you up.‚Äù He steps out of the car before I can respond. He opens my door and again offers his arm, which I take. I live on the third floor of a five-floor walkup. Fredrick takes me all the way to my door.I unlock my door and turn toward Fredrick. ‚ÄúThank you for dinner.‚ÄùFredrick caresses my lip with his thumb the same way he did earlier. ‚ÄúGood night, Julia.‚ÄùMy lips part and I catch my breath. I anticipate his kiss, but it doesn‚Äôt come. I clear my throat. ‚ÄúGood night, Fredrick.‚ÄùI go to turn away, but he grabs my wrist. He pulls me to his chest, and his hands catch me at my waist. I look up into his dreamy eyes. He stares back at me. Neither one of us dare to move. After a few breaths Fredrick asks, ‚ÄúDo I need permission to kiss my wife?‚ÄùI shake my head. ‚ÄúNo.""He nods. ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù He bends forward and caresses my lips with his own. My eyes close. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you in the morning,"" he says as he pulls back. I open my eyes as he turns away and walks down the stairs.\*\*\*Fredrick‚Äôs POV:I really wanted to kiss her, but I knew that if I did, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to stop. She has got to be the hottest woman. And she‚Äôs mine. I drive to my house, our house. I call for Mrs. Bailey, she‚Äôs the housekeeper. She‚Äôs in her early 50s and has been with me since I moved out of my father‚Äôs home. I proceed to my study awaiting her arrival.‚ÄúSir?‚ÄùI‚Äôm looking out my window when she comes in. ‚ÄúI need you to inform the staff that my wife will be moving in this weekend. Remind them of their contracts. This is to be her home now. She is the new madam, and she is to be treated as such. Also remove anything the belongs to Shelby.‚Äù I don‚Äôt turn around, but I just know Mrs. Bailey is shocked and probably confused.‚ÄúYes, sir.‚Äù She exits, closing the door behind her. I settle into my desk and try to figure out a way to get rid of Baker.When I sleep, I dream of Julia. She is walking toward me in a simple white wedding dress. She is barefooted on a beach. We say our I do‚Äôs then dash into the crystal-clear water. Her smiling face is like sunshine, warm and comforting. We splash each other and wrestle around on the shoreline, all the while we were happy and laughing. It feels so real that I wake up confused.I can‚Äôt get my dream out of my head. I‚Äôm in the shower and can‚Äôt focus on anything but Julia. I turn off the water and get ready for my day. I skip breakfast just so I can get to the office before her. It‚Äôs still early when I sit at my desk. I wonder what she‚Äôll be wearing. That‚Äôs ridiculous. I know what she‚Äôll be wearing‚Äîa long pencil skirt that shows off her luscious curves, and a button-down blouse that hugs her waist and breasts but leaves the rest to the imagination. She wears heels, but they‚Äôre not like Shelby‚Äôs. Julia‚Äôs are always the same pair. They‚Äôre black with a chunky heel and a strap across her toes and another strap around her ankles. I actually like her heels. They‚Äôre incredibly sixy. A knock sounds at my door. ‚ÄúEnter.""I‚Äôm disappointed when Mrs. Harvey walks in my door carrying today‚Äôs workload. ‚ÄúMs. Lewis signed her contract. It needs your signature before we can process it. She requires this Monday off for school but will officially start on Tuesday.‚Äù I pull her contract off the top of the stack. Mrs. Harvey continues to talk about upcoming meetings and their content. I wave her away and look back to Julia‚Äôs contract.A soft knock resonates in the office. I get excited. This time I know it‚Äôs her. ‚ÄúEnter.‚Äù She walks in wearing a fire red, short sleeved blouse and a black pencil skirt. Her shoes are the sixy ones she always wears. She has her black framed glasses on, but instead of a bun, her hair is in a ponytail. Soft brown trusses hang down her back with curls on the ends.Seeing her makes me smile. She shuts the door and crosses to the sofa. She‚Äôs ready with a pad of paper and a pen, awaiting instruction. Ever a professional. ‚ÄúItinerary, sir?‚ÄùMy smile drops and I raise my eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat did you call me?‚ÄùShe smiles ever so slightly. ‚ÄúFredrick.‚ÄùI nod as she proceeds to go over my day‚Äôs schedule. I notice as she‚Äôs checking her notepad that she‚Äôs not wearing her ring. ‚ÄúWhere is your ring?‚Äù I cut her off.She looks up from her pad and her face goes almost as red as her blouse. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in my bag. I didn‚Äôt know if you wanted me to wear it in the office since we‚Äôre still on the down low.‚ÄùHer choice of words amuses me. ‚ÄúYes, I want you to wear it. In fact, go get it and bring it to me.‚Äù She sets her pad and pen down on the coffee table then rushes out the door. She returns quickly. She places the box on my desk and sits back down on the sofa.I open the box and find the jeweler‚Äôs name. I look on my computer and scroll through a dozen rings until I find it. It‚Äôs only a three-thousand-dollar ring. After spending time with her last night, I realize she‚Äôs easy to understand. This ring suits her. Anything more would be too extravagant for her comfort. I begin to wonder if she picked I out. I add another phone call to my to-do list. I click on the selection for the matching men‚Äôs ring. I purchase the ring and select pick-up. I enter Julia‚Äôs information as the pick-up person. I take the box and walk over to her. I sit on the coffee table while I sandwich her legs with my own. I take the ring out of the box. I pull her left hand forward. I look in her eyes as I slide the ring on her finger, ‚ÄúMrs. Draven.‚Äù She blushes again. I kiss her hand then place it back on her lap. I go back to my desk. I nod for her to continue.She clears her throat then proceeds with the list. When she‚Äôs finished, she stands up ready to leave. ‚ÄúWill there be anything else, Fredrick?‚Äù Her sweet voice says my name like a kitten purring.I stay in control. ‚ÄúYes. I skipped breakfast this morning. Along with my coffee I‚Äôll need something to eat. Also, I have an errand for you to run. I‚Äôll text you the address, you can pick it up today at your convenience. It is under your name.‚Äù Her eyebrows crinkle inward. I pick up her contract. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt make any changes to your contract. You could have asked for anything, more money, your own office, really anything. Why didn‚Äôt you?‚ÄùShe smiles, ‚Äúwhat more could I need? I‚Äôm married to you.‚Äù I stand up and walk to her. I grab her hips and kiss her cherry lips. Her hands land on my chest. I deepen the kiss just a little more. She pulls away breathlessly. ‚ÄúI should get back to work, Fredrick. My boss is a workaholic, I‚Äôd hate to get fired.‚ÄùI chuckle at her little joke. ‚ÄúWe wouldn‚Äôt want that to happen, Julia.‚Äù She blushes again as I give her a quick peck and let her walk out. :I go straight to the break room to try to figure out something for Fredrick to eat. I doubt he‚Äôs an oatmeal and yogurt kind of guy, but I also know he works out and is therefore health conscious. There are varied fruits and vegetables along with eggs and cheese. I decide to make him an omelet. I start the coffee pot and begin cooking. I cover his food and load everything onto a small tray to take to his office. I knock on his door and wait for his ‚ÄúEnter."" Fredrick is on the phone, so I place the tray on his coffee table. He smirks as a way of saying thank you. I turn around and exit.I‚Äôm working at my desk, taking phone calls and arranging Fredrick‚Äôs schedule when I get a text. Where did you find the omelet? It was delicious.I smile, glad he liked it. I made it for you in the break room.He responds with several texts one after the other. My wife can cook, who knew? Thank you. By the way, I like the ponytail. Now stop texting and get back to work. I roll my eyes and set my phone on my desk. I touch my ponytail and I recall how his hand combed through my hair yesterday. He said that I‚Äôm pretty. He doesn‚Äôt seem to mind that I‚Äôm thick either.‚ÄúDid you hear the latest? Mr. Draven and Ms. Cavanagh broke up.‚Äù‚ÄúHe had her escorted out of the building yesterday. We all saw it happen.‚Äù‚ÄúSo that means he‚Äôs single now, right?‚Äù‚ÄúLike you would have a chance with him.‚Äù‚ÄúLike anyone does? I dare you to even go up to him.‚Äù‚ÄúYeah right, he‚Äôd skin us all alive.‚ÄùI listen to the office gossip and shake my head, if only they knew. Prior to dating Ms. Cavanagh, Fredrick was known for his bachelorhood. He was never really labeled as a playboy, so that‚Äôs a good thing. Who is this man I‚Äôm married to? I open entertainment news articles, then change my mind. That‚Äôs all just a bunch of gossip. I switch to business articles and begin to read. I have one last paper to turn in on Monday about my internship, which would be a good excuse if anyone catches me researching him. I really need to finish my assignment, though. There is a wall at my back, but there is also a hall at my side that leads to Frederick‚Äôs spacious office. I pull up my unfinished 12-page paper. I only have 4 pages left to write. I segue into the topic of Fredrick and his accomplishments within the company.‚ÄúMs. Lewis, are you doing homework on company time?‚Äù I jolt at the sudden voice behind me.I take a deep breath. ‚ÄúMr. Draven, as I‚Äôm still finishing up my internship, this is part of my job description.‚ÄùHe smirks. ‚ÄúThen by all means, continue. Reschedule my lunch for a later time. I had a late breakfast.‚ÄùI smile to myself, ‚Äúyes, sir.‚ÄùFredrick sends me a text with an address. I decide to go on my lunch break to pick up whatever it is. I arrive at a jewelry store and proceed inside. A man standing behind a glass case full of diamond necklaces greets me. I proceed with caution. I have io Idea what Fredrick has me picking up. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here for pick up. My name Julia Lewis.‚ÄùThe man looks my name up on his computer. He proceeds to pull out a black box identical to the one my ring came in. The box terrifies me. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all set. Thank you for stopping in today.‚Äù I refuse to open the box. I put it in my bag and head back to the office.Most of the floor is cleared out for lunch when I return. I knock on Fredrick‚Äôs door. I hear a faint ‚ÄúEnter."" There‚Äôs no one in the room when I walk in. I turn around to the room behind me. It‚Äôs basically a bedroom for when Fredrick works late. The door is open.I speak up as I walk through the door. ‚ÄúFredrick, I got your‚Ä¶‚Äù I stop in my tracks. Fredrick is standing in front of his closet, pulling out a clean shirt. His other shirt is on the bed with a wet mark on it. His smooth perfect chest is right in front of me, and it is delicious. His golden tanned skin is like a beacon signaling me to him. His abs and pec muscles are solid and strong.‚ÄúYou like what you see?‚Äù There is no sarcasm nor ridicule in his voice, he genuinely wants my opinion. I slowly nod. He tosses his clean shirt on the bed then takes a step closer to me. He takes both of my hands and places them on his chest. He guides my hands down to his abs and back up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all yours,‚Äù he whispers in my ear.I look into his eyes. He stares back at me. The look in his eyes is almost a challenge. I don‚Äôt know how I got so brave, but I lean forward and nibble on his collar bone. I hear him hiss through his teeth as he takes in a breath. His hands tighten around mine. I bite down a little more and suck hard. His head falls back as he lets me mark him. I pull back to admire my handiwork. I‚Äôd never given a man a hickey before. I nod in satisfaction and step back.He slips his shirt on with a smirk on his face. I help him with his buttons. He tucks his shirt in then grabs his jacket. ‚ÄúWhy do you always wear a jacket? Wouldn‚Äôt you be more comfortable without it?‚ÄùHe looks at his jacket. ‚ÄúNever really thought about it. I‚Äôve always worn a jacket. Do you object?‚ÄùI look him over. ‚ÄúYes. You look more approachable without it. The shirt and tie alone are pretty sixy.‚ÄùHe smiles. ‚ÄúYou think I‚Äôm sixy?‚ÄùI roll my eyes. ‚ÄúYeah, well, who doesn‚Äôt?‚ÄùHe adjusts his tie. ‚ÄúCan you take care of my shirt for me. I spilled water on it.‚Äù I nod then retrieve the shirt. It‚Äôs warm and smells like him. ‚ÄúOh, what did you need me for? He asks as he‚Äôs walking back to his desk.‚Äù I reach in my bag and pull out the black box. I hand it to him. ‚ÄúDo you like it?‚Äù He asks me.I shake my head, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt look.‚Äù He opens the box and turns it toward me. It‚Äôs a man‚Äôs ring with the same filigree that is on my ring, a matching pair. He takes it out and slips it on his ring finger. He nods in satisfaction.‚ÄúI‚Äôll be out of the office the rest of the day. The movers will be at your place at 9 o‚Äôclock tomorrow morning. As soon as you‚Äôre finished here you may go. I know you have some packing to do.‚Äù He leisurely strolls up to me. He places a chaste kiss on my lips then heads out the door.

Swallowing the lump that is already forming in my throat, I climbed down the stairs. I was truly scared of him when my mom was at work. He turns into a crazy monster. He even drugs my mom at night and those are the nights I hate. He comes into my room and has his way with me. I cry and call for my mom, but he would just laugh saying she is out cold. I hated being home alone with him

And when he is not raping me...he beats me.

Grabbing a beer I walked into the living room where he is watching TV. With shaky hands, I handed him the beer keeping my eyes down, and like always, I felt his dirty eyes on me. Something told me that tonight was going to be one of those nights. I turned and walked out the room as fast as I could. Tears started to fall freely down my face, why was this happening to me? I could never understand why this was happening. As I was about to go up the stairs a letter caught my eye. Looking down the hall then back to the letter I picked it up and bolted up the stairs into my room.

I knew it was a bad idea to take the letter because Tim might notice. But I didn't care. Looking down at the name I knew it was my fathers. My birth father. I pulled the letter out and saw a check for six hundred dollars making my eyes go wide. He's paying child support? Could this be the only reason why Tim puts up with me? I should have known! Looking down at the letter once again I saw that it had his address. What if I were to find him? I met him before and he was never pissed or angry, I remember that I always wanted to hang out with him. Of course, I was six at the time.

A knock at my door made me jump right out of my skin, opening my bedside table I threw the check and envelope inside. ""Come in.""

My mom poked her head in giving me a smile. ""Hey honey, how was your day?""

""It was good mom, what about yours?""

""That's good honey, my day was boring and full of work,"" she walked in taking a sit on my bed. ""Is everything okay? You don't want or need to tell me anything?""

Her questions threw me off because not once since she met Tim has she asked how things were going. Something was wrong making the air in the room shifted. I started to fidget on my bed looking at everything but her.

""What are you talking about everything is fine,"" the look on her face told me otherwise.

""The school called today and wanted to know where you got your bruises. I sat in my office thinking to myself what bruises? You never told me anything about them,"" she stopped talking and studied my face, ""where did you get them and don't you dare lie to me.""

She wouldn't believe me if I told her and Tim was anything but nice to me when she was not here. She would not believe me, everything in my body was screaming at me to tell her. To scream out, it was Tim! He has been raping and beating me.

""I fell down the stairs the other day, I didn't want to tell you because I didn't want you to worry,"" I prayed she bought my lie.

Please, buy my lie!

No one said anything for a bit she finally nodded and stood from the bed. ""Okay, but next time tell me so if I get a call like this again, I would not be caught off guard.""

""Okay mom, I'm sorry I didn't tell you before but I will next time,"" she gave me a nodded.

""Are you coming down for dinner?""

I wasn't hungry nor did I want to see Tim, there was no way I was going to eat. ""No mom, I have a lot of homework,"" she didn't look happy with my choice but nodded anyways.

I laid back on my bed and closed my eyes wishing this nightmare was over. My mind wondered to Jake. Wondering how would things be if we had stayed best friends? Tears ran down my face as I remember that horrible day.

I was walking to my locker with an extra jump in my step for many reasons. One is because it's the start of a new year and two, I get to see my best friend, Jake. We didn't get to spend much time together over the break. Because I went out of town. So you can see why I was happy, I was also hoping we have some classes together as well. Because let's face it, classes together with your best friends are just plain fun!

A smile grew on my face when I saw Jake standing by my locker. ""Jake!"" I yelled running the rest of the way.

I pulled him into a hug but something felt off. Pulling away, I looked at him confused. He looked nervous and acting little worried. ""Jake, what's wrong?"" I asked unsure if I wanted to hear the answer to my own question.

He looked around not wanting to meet my eyes. He rubbed the back of his neck then finally meeting my eyes. ""Look, Lin, we can't be friends anymore.""

And just like that, my whole word just crashed. Part of me wishes I was dreaming, but the pain told me otherwise. My eyes started to water as the words set in. ""What are you saying?""

He sighed. ""A lot has happened while you were gone,"" he said finally meeting my eyes again. ""I'm dating Carly now.""

My mouth was a gap.

He's dating the one girl who doesn't like me ever since we started high school. Jake knew how much we didn't like each other. ""why, h-how could you,"" I whispered.

""She is not a bad person. If you get to know her you would see that. But, as long as I'm dating her we can't be friends,"" I felt a tear run down my cheeks at his words.

He picked some bitch over me. ""I'm sorry, Lin,"" he took a step forward trying to give me one last hug but I stepped back.

""No, only my friends can call me Lin,"" I looked up at him, glaring through blurry eyes. ""If she hurts you and you want to come back to me. Don't!"" My hands shot up and I pushed him as hard as I could into the lockers causing people looked at us because the sound was loud.

I turned and walked down the hall not even looking back at him. I swear to this day that I will never get that close to anyone ever again because all they ever do is hurt you in the end.

I had held true to my world and I don't have friends anymore. I guess you can call me a loner, I just sit in the back of the library reading books and doing my homework. I cannot say I do not like it because I do. I don't have to worry about the drama of having friends, there are times I get lonely. Shaking my head I knew I needed to stop feeling sorry for myself. Rolling over to my side I closed my eyes and tried to get some sleep. I hardly got any nowadays since I was always scared that Tim was going to come in at night.

\~

A hand started to run over my ass making me jump up, looking up my eyes went wide. Tim was above me looking down with an evil glint. I knew he was going to come in here tonight, my heart started to beat hard in my chest. My eyes looked to my door to see that he had pushed my dresser in front of it. How in the hell did he do that without me hearing him?

""You have nowhere to go, little girl. Might as well just give up now,"" He taunted me.

I tried to make a break for the window but he grabbed me by my hair slamming me on the bed. I started to kick and scream with everything I had, but it resulted in him hitting me across the face stunning me. This was the first time he has hit me on my face. He didn't like drawing attention to what he does. ""You should have learned from the started that girls are meant to just lay on their backs."" I turned my head the side the best I could and once again fought to get free.

He hit me again making my vision turn dark as he shoved himself hard into me. I started to cry silently. ""s-stop please, t-this is not right.""

""It is right. You have to learn that someone like you is only meant to pleasure a guy. Nothing more and nothing less.""

As he kept moving over me I cried under him. When he was done he landed a few more blows to my face then walked out the room. Rolling to my side once more I started to cry. My body shook hard and I knew I couldn't take this anymore, there was no way in hell was I going to be able to deal with this shit any longer.

Getting out of bed, I changed my clothes and packed a small bag. I then grabbed my notebook writing my mom a letter telling her everything that Tim has been doing to me. From when she was not home and him drugging her when she was. At the end, I put I was going to my dad and to not look for me and I would call when I was ready.

Setting the letter down on my pillow I knew she was going to be the first one to see it. Tim wouldn't dare come in here after he has done this shit to me. I grabbed the check my dad wrote to cash it then go straight to him.

Jumping out the window, I took off down the street to the corner store that I know would cash the check for me. He was a nice old man who doesn't like Tim at all. I just hoped my dad would want me because if he didn't then I was as good as dead. Tim put a knife to my throat once saying if I told anyone he would kill me.

And I believe him.



# Book 1: Chapter 1

Catalina

I felt someone shake my shoulder lightly waking me up, when opening my eyes I found an old lady giving me a kind smile. Looking around I saw that everyone was already off the Gray Hound. ""We are here dear, you don't want to get left alone.""

""Thank you, ma'am,"" she nodded then walked off the bus.

Standing up stretching as I went, my bones crack even though the bus seats were comfortable. This was the first time in a long time that I have gotten any kind of sleep. Walking off the bus, I looked around to realize that I had no idea where to go. My eyes landed on some cabs. Guess it wouldn't hurt to just walk up to one. A guy got out grabbing my bags as I neared his cab. ""Go ahead and have a seat while I'll out your bags in the trunk.""

I gave a tight smile and got in the car, I knew that not every man was going to be like Tim. But I was scared to even talk to any guy now and that is why I sat next to two old ladies on the bus. I pulled my phone out and looking at the time, it was just a little past ten. I was hoping my dad didn't work weekends. The door slamming shut made me jump and looked to the cab driver. He was a young guy but not too young maybe twenty-five or older?

""Where to ma'am?""

""Umm...6148 East Wicker Lane."" He started to put it in the GPS. Aren't they suppose to know the city well?

Cars and buildings started to whiz by as we started on our way. The town my dad lived in was not too bad it was actually nice. The only thing that bugged me a bit was I saw a lot of bikers. I wanted to get away from scary men not walk right into the path of a thousand bikers and more! Tim still haunted my dreams I knew I wasn't going to be able to sleep for a while. What if he comes after me or worse he kills my mom? It didn't hit me until now, what if she reads the letter and tells Tim, he would kill her. My heart dropped to my stomach when I realized what I just did.

I just signed my mom's death certificate.

My eyes started to burn making me look down at my hands. If he kills my mom I will follow her because I just couldn't live with myself knowing I was the reason she died.

""Ma'am?""

""Huh?""

""I said we are here."" Looking outside, I saw he was right. Nodding I looked at the meter. Forty dollars, that's not bad. I pulled out a fifty handing it to him.

""Keep the change,"" I got out grabbing my bag when he popped the trunk.

Looking around my dad's yard, I saw he had a Hardly out front. Was he a biker? I hope not.I started to the door when I got there I raised my hand about to knock but then dropped my hand. Maybe I should go home back to my mom. She could die because of me, looking over my shoulder only to see the cab driving off. Guess it's too late now, shaking my hand a bit. I raised my hand again and knocked on the door three times then stepped back.

My heart was beating fast in my chest as I wondered how this would go. A few seconds passed by and I was starting to think that maybe he wasn't home. Just as I was about to turn away the door opened. A scary looking guy stood in front of me. I was beginning to think that maybe I had the wrong home but then I realized it. This man was my father because he had my eyes and hair color.

He was looking at me in shock, at first, I was wondering why. Reasons past through my head. I haven't seen him in so long because mom forbade it. ""Umm...I'm looking for Adam Blake."" My voice was barely above a whisper.

Something crossed his eyes making me step back a little because that was the same look Tim got when he was about to hit me. ""What fuck happened to your face? Did you mother come with you.""

I looked down as I was starting to regret coming here. How could I've been so stupid and not hide my bruises on my face? ""Catalina, look at me,"" I couldn't look up, I was scared of what I was going to see. The floor started to blur and before I could stop it a sob left me.

I felt a hand reach behind my neck pulling me into a warm body, I dropped my bag wrapping my arms around him. ""It's okay baby. You're safe now,"" He gently rubbed his hand up and down my back as I cried into his shoulder. ""C'mon inside so we can talk about what happened.""

He pulled away whipping his thumbs under my eyes and suddenly he didn't seem as scary as I first thought. He bent down picking up my bag then stood to the side letting me in. It had a warm home feeling making me feel safe. The safest I have felt in a long time. Walking into the living room I wasn't sure what to do, looking over my shoulder at my dad. I found him watching me closely. Was there something wrong with what I was wearing? Looking at everything I was wearing I guess I did look funny an oversize sweater and sweats. I was in pain as well, so that didn't help.

I heard him step closer and when a hand came to reach for my chin I flinched back. ""Sorry,"" I whispered. Tim had truly traumatized me so any hand that someone raises at me makes me flinch.

""What happened baby?"" his voice was softer this time and fatherly.

""I can't stay with mom. I can't live like that anymore."" I sunk down on his sofa and he walked in front of me pulling the coffee table closer.

""Okay, what has been happening at moms?"" I didn't need to look up to know he was mad.

""I-I,"" the words got stuck in the back of my throat as Tim's voice come into my mind 'I will kill you if you tell.' But he can't hurt me here not with my dad around. ""T-Tim has been hitting me.""

""Tim's your mom's husband right?""

""Y-yes. He acts all nice around mom but as soon as she goes to work, he turns into a monster. H-he."" The worlds once again got stuck in the back of my throat. Closing my eyes more tears ran down my cheeks. Can I tell my dad that he raped me?

That's something a father never what's to hear.

""He did what baby girl?"" Since my eyes were closed I didn't see him reach for my chin. I opened my eyes only to have his bore into mine. ""I need you to trust me,"" His voice was strong and steady. But there was that word that scared me half to death...Trust.

""He's been...raping me."" my dad's body froze, he looked stuck in time as if he was a statue or something. What if my dad doesn't want me and thinks I'm not worth saving? My mom passed through my mind again what if he kills her. It scared me enough to shoot up and make for the door ""I should go.""

And just like that, he was snapped back in time. His eyes turned cold his muscle were rigged. ""You're not going anywhere, you're my daughter. I had this feeling I should have gone to check this cunt out. If I didn't like him then I would have took you from your mother on the spot, but I listened to your mother and stayed away. Now look what happened.""

He stood from the table reaching into his front pocket. He pulled out his phone looking for something when he found it he put it to his ear. ""We got a problem, meet me at my place."" What was the problem? I hope I wasn't the problem because if I am then I can just go. Watching my dad nodded his head. ""Yeah, it's a pressing matter,"" He looked to me. ""but don't bring everyone, might not help my situation at the moment.""

His situation? I thought we were dealing with mine!

""Does your mother know you're here?""

""N-no Tim drugged her but I left her a note on my bed. Tim wouldn't know I'm gone because I stay in my room all the time. When mom's home she is the only one that goes in there."" I looked at my fingers as I played with them. I was scared this was a bad idea. ""This was a bad idea, I should go back to mom's. He will kill her if he finds out I told her...anyone for the matter."" I started to the door the door once again but stopped when I heard bikes roar outside. ""You're not going anywhere, Catalina. He hurt you and I'm not going to let you go back to that shit.""

""You don't understand, he will kill mom I have to go back!"" I tried to walk past him but he wrapped his arms around me.

I struggled to get out of his grip and that was when flashes of Tim came flooding in. I froze in his arms trying to control my breathing. Shutting my eyes tight, I shook my head trying to get the images out my head. It was like my hearing and vision was gone and all I can see was Tim standing over me. ""Please, don't.""

""Catalina. No one is going to hurt you here,"" I felt finger run through my hair. ""Open your eyes and see for yourself, he's not here baby.""

Taking in slow steady breaths, I finally opened my eyes and was met with my dad. It was like a sigh of relief filled me to see that I was indeed at my dad's. I looked behind him to see three big guys and I didn't miss that fact that they were bikers. ""They're with me, baby. They're my brothers.""

Brothers?

""Catalina, I'm Alexzander Power, president of Dasani MC. Your father has told me a lot about you,"" The one talking stepped a little closer.

""You have a daughter, how come you never told the club?"" Alexzander turned and smacked the guy over the head.

""Whether he has kids or not is not your business, I only knew because I know her mother.""

He knows's my mom?

""C'mon baby, let's get you cleaned up and then get something to eat,"" My dad took my hands gently and pulling me up. I don't ever remember coming to the corner of the living room. He must have let me go once I started to have the panic attack.

He led me to the bathroom and turned on the shower for me. ""Relax baby okay, if you need me I'll be in the kitchen,"" He kissed the top of my head and walked out the bathroom.

I had my back to the mirror because I was scared to look at myself, I knew it had to be bad. I pulled the sweater over my head dropping it to the floor. Once I had stripped my clothes I stepped in the shower making my breathing hitch. The water was hot and instead of turning the cold water on I kept it on hot. For some odd reason, this didn't compare to what Tim has done to me. I sank to the tub floor and brought my knees up to my chest.

In my heart, I knew I was safe here but my mind is telling me I'm not. How can I live with myself if he kills my mom? Like I said before I would follow her into the afterlife. Does that make me selfish? Would my dad be hurt by my action if I do? How do I deal with this whole situation?

But all I know is that I have to save my momsomehow.¬†



# Book 1: Chapter 2

Catalina

The water was starting to turn cold so I knew it was time to get out. Turning the water off I stepped out looking around for a towel. One was hanging on the door and I also saw my bag on the counter top. I didn't even hear the door open. Looking through it I saw that in my hurry I only grabbed shorts, tank tops, and undergarments.

""Nice Lin. Grab something that would show everything.""

While running my hand through my wet hair I made the mistake of looking in the mirror. I had an ugly black and blue bruise lining my jaw and hairline. Looking a little lower, I dropped the towel and immediately looked away, Tim's hand prints were visible on my inner thighs. An overwhelming sick feeling rushed through me making me hover over the toilet throwing up everything I had in my stomach.

Finally putting my clothes on I threw on my sweater and it was a good thing that it went just a little below my thighs. Covering the hand prints which was the main thing for me to hide. It was the best, for now, there was no way I want to put my sweats back on because I just threw them on after Tim had done what he did. A shiver went down my spine, I was going to throw that shit away. I grabbed my bag and left the bathroom. I followed the voice until I found the kitchen but stopped short.

""How about we call Aiden. He is still the president of the Hell Raisers, no?""

""He is, how deep is she in this. Can Ebony end up dead because of this shit?"" Yes, yes she can, that is if my mom is not already died.

""Catalina did tell me much. Hell, I didn't even know she was coming. She just showed up on my doorstep this morning,"" My dad said. ""I knew I should have gone down there to at least visit. But I listened to Ebony when she told me that Catalina didn't want to see me. I thought when she was ready she would come find me,"" I never told mom to tell him that! He must think I hate him.

""I never told mom that,"" All eyes snapped to me when I rounded the corner. ""I just thought you didn't want to come see me anymore..."" my voice trailed off at the end when I realized that I gave away that I was listening.

""How long have you been standing there?"" My dad asked pulling a chair out next to him.

Taking a seat next to him I thought about my answer. ""Not long, I just heard what you said about what mom told you."" He gave a nod then pulling a plate in front of me.

My cringed my nose when I saw what was on the plate. ""What's that look for?""

I couldn't help but laugh a little. ""Guess mom never told you anything, huh? I'm a vegetarian. I don't eat meat or anything animal products.""

""Please tell me you're joking?"" I started laughing shaking my head.

""You can thank the third grade for that, they took us on this field trip to a farm and that day just so happened to be the day Farmer James was stocking up on his meat. He didn't know we were passing by when shot the cow in the head.""

Everyone in the kitchen started laughing I even joined in. It was not funny that I saw a cow getting shot in the head. But for the fact that they thought it was funny I saw a cow die at that age. ""Okay, so what do you eat them?""

""Anything green, Veggies, tofu, junk food, and I drink protein shakes to replace the meat."" My dad shook his head laughing a bit.

""Well then, we have to go shopping for your things then."" I smiled nodding a bit.

""Has mom tried calling?""

""No baby, but the boys and I are going to head over there. I want you to stay here and do not open the door for anyone,"" I gave a nod but then I realized something I had school today.

""I have school today, I never missed a day.""

""Baby now is not the time to worry about school. Did you forget that you're going to be living with me now?""

""But my grades will drop,"" Getting into a good college was all I had to get away from here, from this nightmare.

""I'll call you in sick baby, you're not going to today."" He left no room to argue with him.

This was going to be a big adjustment in my life, mom was more of a free sprite while dad seems to be a stricter person. I guess that is a good thing because he won't let anyone close to me that was not good. I'm not trying to downplay my mom but she married Tim four months after she met him. I was shocked on how fast that happened. Looking at my dad, I can tell he just doesn't let anyone in or close to family. I felt safer with my dad than my mom was that wrong?

""Can you turn my work into the office?"" my dad started laughing grabbed me from the back of my head pulling me into a hug making me relax in his hold.

""You're a stubborn little thing aren't you?"" I giggled at his statement.

""Mom says I get it for you.""

""That's my girl."" He leaned forwarded kissing my forehead. ""I'm going to go check on your mother then when we get back we will work everything out, okay?""

""Do you have a spare room? I'm kind of tired.""

""Yeah, it's your room actually. I had it furnished for you when you decided to actually see me,"" It was no secret that he felt a little hurt about me not coming to see him while I was growing up.

I must have zoned out for a moment because next thing I hear a dog running through the house. When I looked over my shoulder I saw a big bully. He was so cute. I hopped off the stool and started to pet him. He was wagging his tail and started to lick my face making me giggle. I had always loved dogs but Tim never let us get one.

""This is Monster. He loved to meet new people unless they try and break into the house then he turned into this beast.""

""He's so cute, how long have you had him?"" I was now sitting on my butt as Monster tried to sit on my lap so I upped for having him sit between my legs. As he licked my face I scratched behind his ears. Well, what was left of them they were clipped to points.

He was a dark gray with a white chest and really bulky. I loved it!

""Ever since he was a puppy, I trained him myself, I want to tell you the safe words and commands just in case someone breaks in while I'm gone,"" I looked up at my dad as he said the last words. ""He likes to cuddle so you might enjoy him in the house most of the time.""

I stop listening to my dad as I started to play with Monster. He may look really mean but seeing him bent down with his butt in the air wagging his tail waiting for me to throw the ball. Was priceless. I lightly threw the ball in the living room and he took off grabbing it and brought it back to me.

""Catalina, are you listening to me?"" I hid the ball behind my back giving a soft smile.

""Sorry daddy.""

""Nothing to be sorry about, Monster to your bed."" My dad pointed to a dog bed in the living room. He happily went to sit waiting for his next order. My dad waved his hand for me to follow him.

""This is your room, I left the walls white so we can paint it later if you like. If someone was to come into the house and it's not me or any of my brothers. You tell Monsters, by me, he will stand at your side bearing his teeth so don't be scared of him. Every time you move he would move with you always putting himself in front of you and whoever is in the house. If they are going to come at you then you say, attack, loud and clear. When you feel like you're safe enough then you say, that's enough, by me."" Wow, that was a lot to take in I think I will freak out if a dog got that mad.

""Do you understand what I'm telling you?"" I nodded my head. ""What did I say?""

""You said if someone comes in the house to tell Monster to stand by me and if I feel like they are going to come at me then say attack and then say that's enough, by me. I listed everything off with my fingers

""God, I wish you have gotten your mother attitude and not mine."" Laughing I sat on the bed loving how soft it was. ""Get some rest, we will talk when I get back.""

Laid back on the bed and looking up at the ceiling I got to thinking. Was it bad that I don't feel as bad as I thought I would when I left my mom? Part of me was pissed at her that she let that monster into our home and that she was oblivious to everything going on right under her nose. Tears ran down my face when I thought about her getting hurt. But again part of me hopes he hits her just so she knows what I have been going through for five years.

Does that make me a bad person?

\~

Adam

Seeing my daughter in the state she was in made my blood run cold. I was going to put this son of a bitch in the ground, no one touches my daughter. No one. My bike roar as I sped down the highway. Power called Aiden and told him if he was up for a little beat down. We weren't friends with their club for nothing we had each other's backs. We also had to make sure that the son of a bitch didn't leave town.

Finally pulling up in front of the house Aiden and three of his brothers were out front waiting. I gave a quart nod and walked up to the front door. I started to pound on the door and I didn't stop until it swung open. A guy stood there but I didn't give him time to reacted I tackled him to the floor and started to pound his face in. My little girl's scared face crossed my mind filling my anger.

""It's time to learn how it feels to get beaten on, you son of a bitch!"" I sneered as I finally stood up. My chest was rising and falling hard.

""Who the fuck are you,"" He tried to get up but I landed a kick to his stomach making his have a coughing fit.

""I'm your worse nightmare, you should have never touched my daughter because now you're going to know what it feels like to get fucked up!""

My brothers started laughing behind me but it wasn't the kind of laugh where this is funny. No, it was the kind where they knew just how fucked up I can be. They don't call me Blaze for nothing. I can run into a town, a clubhouse, you name it and kill back to back with no mercy. Looking around the room, I saw Ebony limp on the floor.

Cursing under my breath, I bent down feeling for a pulse to find she was alive. Catalina will be happy for that. ""She's alive,"" Scooping her up in my arms I started a walking to the stairs ""Watch him.""

Walking into the first bedroom, I found I laid her on the bed and shook my head. If she would have never left me then she wouldn't be here right now. But club life was not for anyone. Walking out the room I closed the door and stomped down the stairs. It was time to finish this cocksucker I was going to put him in a world of pain before I end him.

This was going to be the day he takes on someone his own size and find out just how fucked up I can be. No one, I repeat no one. Touches my daughter and lives.



# Book 1: Chapter 3

Catalina

My dad was right about Monster loving to cuddle, he has been laying down on the bed with me. It was like he knew something was wrong because from time to time he would lick my face clean of tears. He was a big dog too he took up half the bed. But it was okay because I just threw my leg over him. I was having a hard time falling asleep because every time I closed my eyes all I saw was Tim.

Rolling to my back Monster lifted his head up looking at my door. Soon after I heard a roar of a bike. I was glad Monster stayed with me, even when the front door opened and closed followed by footsteps. A low growl come for Monster as he moved a little bit more to get in a better angel. When my door started to open slowly he started to bark scaring the hell out of me.

""Enough,"" my dad's voice filled the room Monster laid down on the bed relaxing. ""Are you up baby girl?""

""Yeah,"" even though I didn't have to whisper I did anyways.

""Want to go me join me in the kitchen? I stopped at the store and got a few thing,"" I threw the covers off me and walked out the door following my dad into the kitchen.

I smiled when he had a salad set on the island. ""You didn't have to buy me anything right now. It's late.""

""You didn't eat this morning and by the looks of it, you didn't make anything. So at least just eat a little bit.""

Nodding I started to eat the salad and I hadn't realized how hungry I was till I started to eat. Because when I was done I was wishing there was more. Grabbing the water on the table taking a small sip. When I looked at my dad he was just staring at me. I thought that maybe that I had something on my face when I checked there was nothing.

""What?""

""Nothing, I just haven't seen you in years. It's like I turn around and now here you are almost grown."" Something crossed his eyes making me feel bad again.

""I'm sorry I didn't press mom to let me come over.""

""It's okay baby. Your mother can be a handful.""

""No, it was not fair to you. You're my dad just as much as she was my mom."" I shook my head. ""She had no right to say you can't see me because last time I check. There is no court papers."" My dad started too chuckled in his seat ""What's so funny?

""Nothing baby, it's just you remind me so much of myself when I was younger."" I smiled a little looking down at my empty blow. ""So I was thinking about taking you to go get your papers from school. So you can transfer out here then stop by your mom's to get things you want from your old room.""

At the mention of going back to my mom's scared me, I did not want to see Tim it would be very bad. ""I don't want to go to mom's. Please don't make me do it.""

""Tim is not going to be there. He's not going to be bothering you anymore. I had a talk with your mother too. She agreed to let you stay here the remainder of your schooling and she said something about you wanting to go to the art college here.""

""Mom's alive?"" My voice was very hopeful but what if he was feeding me a lie. Just to make me feel better.

""Yeah, she got a little roughed up but she is alive."" It was like a big weight was taking off my shoulders.

""And Tim?""

""Don't worry about where he is. He is no longer a worry for you,"" I just nodded not sure what to say to that. My eyes landed on what he was wearing.

""So you're in a Motorcycle Club?""

""Yes, I am. Ever since I was eighteen.""

""You know, I came here to get away from men who scare me. Not to just walk right in the path of big scary bikers.""

""My brothers would never hurt you. They have my back no matter what and when I tell them I have you with me. They will protect you when I'm not around.""

I didn't know if I would or even will trust another man again. Because I stupidly trusted Tim and look where that got me. It got me raped and beaten every night and for what? Tim's own sick personal gain! I couldn't figure out if I was supposed to be mad at my mom or Tim. Hell, even the world...possible even my dad for not coming to see me.

""Don't get mad at me but I wouldn't and never will trust your brothers. I have no trust to give. I'm even having a hard time trusting you right now. It was hard enough to tell you what has happened. So if it's okay with you, I don't want to be around the club.""

The room was silent it was kind of starting to remind me about Tim. He was always dead silent before the storm. My hand were in fists under the island it was something I did to prepare myself for the pain that is to come.

""Catalina, look at me."" I closed my eyes as my breathing was picking up. There was no reason why I should be scared of my dad...right? Finally willing myself to look at him I saw nothing but love there was no trace of hate behind his eyes.

""I would never make you do anything you are not ready to do. One day when you're up for it, I'll introduce you to the club but right now it's fine,"" My heart slowed at his words I didn't have to worry about them. ""But I'm still telling my brothers that you are here. Because even though you keep your distance from the club. A brother of mine will always be close by to help if needed.""

I guess if they didn't bug me then I had nothing to worry about right? But I will be sure to walk the other way if I ever do cross paths with them. Because there is no way I would even walk past someone like a biker. Sorry dad.

My dad and I stayed up talking for a little while longer until I actually started to feel tired. Currently, I am laying on my bed with Monster's head sleeping on my stomach. He really did make me feel better. I adjusted myself better and finally closed my eyes and I prayed that Tim didn't haunt my dreams tonight.

\~

A loud thud made me shoot out of bed, I sat up as panic started to set in. I didn't know where it came from and it didn't help that the room was dark. When my door slammed open a scream left me. I had forgot that I was at my dad's util I saw him standing in my doorway with a gun in his hand! ""What happened, are you okay?""

""Why do you have a gun?""

He looked down at his hand and cursed under his breath. ""I thought someone was breaking in. Why are you on the floor?""

That's when it hit me I was the one who made the loud thump. Then I realized that I was just having a bad dream about Tim and I must have fallen off the bed. My dad's hand came in my line of sight offering to help me up. Once I was standing on my two feet he wrapped his arms around me placing a lingering kiss on the top of my head. I knew this was his way to comfort me and it was helping. My dad was not a small guy you were able to tell that he worked out on a daily basis. Not that I mind. He can protect me better and he felt like a teddy bear.

""You want to eat before we head out?"" he ran a hand through my hair to get a better look at my face. But I hated showing my face so I made my hair fall back to hid it. ""You know baby girl. I would like to see my little girl pretty face and not all this hair.""

""I like it, it covers me up."" He gave a low sigh clearly not please by my answer.

""What would you like to eat?""

I thought about it for a moment. ""Do you have oatmeal?""

""Yes, I do. Anything else you would like?"" I shook my head no. I can't eat big meals in the morning or I get sick later on.

Sitting at the table my dad went over the plans with me. We were going to stop by my school first. Then go to my house and get everything that I wanted to take with me. My dad again assured me that Tim was not going to be there and that my mom was going to be at work. I loved my mom but I don't think I was ready to face her right now. I mean how could I? She just found out that her husband for four years has been raping me.

I thought my dad was crazy when he told me to get on the back of his bike. I was now dressed and hidden all the marks on my body with make-up. Something I learned to mask over the years. ""I'm not getting on that death trap.""

""Yes, you are. Just swing your leg over and hold on to me for God sakes.""

""Don't bring God into this. I have never been on one before.""

""Baby, I've been riding bikes for a long time. I know how to handle it.""

""No.""

""Yes.""

""No.""

""Yes, unless you want to go in the van with some of the prospects.""

Looking behind me where my dad was pointing my eyes went wide. There was no way in hell I was going to get in a van with guys I do not know. I swallowed the lump that was forming in the back of my throat and took steps closer to the bike.

""Promise you won't crash?""

""I promise baby, now put the helmet on so we can go.""

But I have wondered what Nick‚Äôs end game with Julie was. 

He continued to pursue her after she finally gained some sense and broke it off with him. He even went as far as chancing a phone call to whoever he was working for twenty years earlier, and offering to turn himself in if Angie got a pass, which they apparently said no.

He was looking at prison time no matter how he turned himself in. He harbored a fugitive for twenty years. 

If he ever came clean to Julie and admitted everything, did he expect her to understand and wait for him to get out of prison?

I've been with him 5 months and 4 months with him before she came back into pic and im not comfortable with this and led to a huge fight. Looking for advice?

\------------Background (sorry this is long)----------------

I (32F) have known my significant other (39M) for a long time. We were friends and dated other people before we finally came together. 

My SO the past few years, after ending a long term relationship, has some pretty bad health issues and really can't do much on his own because of it right now but it will get better. He had a good friend come help him as a caretaker and they got close. She ended up moving in because it was easier. They hooked up alot. They slept in the same bed. He paid her for helping. 

I got to know her through him. We were all cool. She was nice. A little obsessed with him. Couldn't not talk about him non stop and how she wanted a relationship and he didn't. She'd analyze how hed never kiss her or be affectionate but she stayed. I kind of stopped being friends with her during this time because it was one sided. Id take her out on her bday because he wouldnt and didnt care much, id give her xmas gifts, i even helped her pay for a car repair, id bring her coffees, food when she was sick. and she only vented about him and never cared about even saying happy birthday to me. So i stopped caring. She was only sweet when it came to him. he said it was because she was jealous of me. 

He made it clear to her and me that it was convenient and she can stop at any time. But she was holding on for hope. For years. 

During this time, i ended things with my long-term partner and when that happened my now SO opened up to me that he had feelings for me all along and wanted a future with me and could see his life with me. I of course, said what about 'her' and he said, she doesnt need to be here. its convienent for both her and i but you are who i want to be with.

I backed up a few times because i didn't want to be in the way while they figured things out. He really kept pulling me back in. Telling me how cant he commit to me if im so inconsistent being in and out. I understood that, but i explained because of her end things first. He wouldnt let her go. It was really frustrating and led to alot of fights that made him even more hard to be with because... stressful. He didn't understand why i couldnt handle him being with her too because it meant nothing to him. 

He'd have me come over, hed hook up with me, he'd kiss me, cuddle with me and be affectionate and she didn't like it. Because she didnt get those things. So she stopped agreeing to having me around. I didn't see him for a long time. He lied to me saying she moved out. But he still wouldnt see me much and if i questioned he'd say its because im being difficult always pressuring and asking. she did tell me he had her not move out that whole time. So i backed away. 

I did actually understand that it was a hard choice, because she was his caretaker and i couldnt be all those things she did for him. I know he wanted us both, differently. I just wish he'd have let me off the hook and not made me feel like if i only tried harder. I was clear i wasn't into this, i am a monogomous person and a relationship person. Anyways....

It ended badly between them. She avoided him. I understood that she was trying to heal and move on. But he missed his friend and she still had some things there. Which was weird. I felt like it was tethering her to his place and a reason to talk again. 

She ended up moving out (finally) and he started having me around more and more. We worked through those issues and concerns and moved past it i understood his explainantion for things. And ive of course have been helping take care of him. hes never asked me to do a thing. I do not get paid. i just care about him. we've been pretty happy and solid we get along really well. 

He and i are now planning our life together. We are talking about selling one of our houses, living together, trying to get pregnant. Ive been fixing up his house to get ready to sell. He can't do much right now and im happy to help. 

She was avoiding him and out of the picture for 4 months. I came in and we got close, i basically live there. He says all the the time how much he loves me, he doesnt deserve me, how perfect i am, wants a future etc. hes made it clear he wants to be with me and never with her, shes lazy and blah it was just easy and she mostly sucked and drove him crazy and didn't want to ask me to do these things she used to help with. I got it. I felt like a second choice, but i understood. It was hard. but he did tell her all along how he felt about me. 

About a month ago (4 months later) now my being there 5 months almost daily. She came to get the rest of her things. I hid all my things, because i didn't want her to be hurt, feeling replaced already. Just wanted her to get her things, they'd have some closure and we could finally move along. I knew itd be hard for him, she was a good friend, i was very understanding and it was hard for him. I didn't hear from him for a day and a half after. But i didnt want to make it about me and my comfort i knew it was emotional. It was an ending. 

He told me she knew things were different and she could see i had mail there and she connected the dots. She saw things were being cleaned and taken care of by someone else (me). 

A few weeks later, when i went home for a night. He told me he was going to have a friend over the next night. I didn't even question anything until i got back there. and everything was weird. Dishes were cleaned, my things were moved, just felt off and he knew id be back to help him. I questioned why my stuff was hidden and he kind of got annoyed at me for being a detective. Eventually, he said she was there and watched tv together. I was like ""oh, i didn't know you guys were even talking"" . He said ""shes just a friend, she sat far away from me. "" 

They used to watch sports together, so he said he'd like her to watch it with him because i hate sports. I felt weird but i didn't want him to resent me by telling him who he can't be friends with that never works. I noticed she was sleeping over though. I told him to have boundaries. Tell her im not just caretaking im actually with you, so she knows and can make a decision to be around or not if it hurts her. She was inlove you. Don't let her feel comfortable enough to do dishes, im here, it makes me uncomfortable. He understood about the dishes and touching things and said it was just her habit but she shouldnt do that. but then he retracted and said i shouldnt make a big deal its just dishes. 

We got in a huge fight because i said i came back around being with you when it was over with you guys and you ""broke up"" and now you brought a complication in and i thought it was over when i agreed to be here. He fought that it wasn't a break up because they weren't ever together. No one else, sees it that way, even her. They lived together for years and slept together. the label was nothing, a comfort only to him of the technicality. He argues that sex can mean nothing. She was sleeping with other guys too. So who cares. 

He's more open minded, as in, he wouldn't care if i slept with someone else as long as i came home to him. He would care if i was out for dinners, or falling in love but if its just a hookup hed be like ""have fun"" but im not like that and i more than explained my comfort. He argues, who cares if someone falls asleep or watches tv with him, hes allowed to have friends. 

He mostly has female friends, i dont care. This... i care about because she was the reason he didnt see me. He chose her over me for years while i waited so it does hurt. I am trying to understand that his mindset isn't wrong just because its different from how i see things.

So other week...He ran out of groceries and texted me when i was home. I saw it in the morning, went to get things as i always do (i live an hour away but i have the key and he always tells me to come home and not ask). He was still sleeping because my text that i was coming wasnt read yet but that was normal. Im a freakish morning person. When i got there, her car was there. i left the stuff on the deck ...and Not going lie, i did have a friend drive by thats was close through out the day and noticed she was there the full day and the next. 

But again, in his eyes, whats the big deal to binge tv with someone. Nothings happening. people fall asleep or drink too much or whatever and again, big fight and he thinks im ruining the day by bringing it up. i need to be more open minded. Shes important to him. I am important too just different to him.

The other day he asked me if she could come and watch their shows together again and how id feel. he was trying to communicate this time and be honest. He said i dont have to leave but obviously its akward with us because she was jealous of me and now im insecure about her because the past. I told him its hard to explain how i feel because its complicated. I dont really feel comfortable but i can't tell you not to do something just i thought it was over. 

It ended in a huge fight. he didn't make me feel better or more secure about us. he just said the conversation was annoying him and drop it. I left his place but i texted him how i felt. That it was hurting me. He was annnoyed and said drop it. I even told him, id feel better if you cared about how i felt about the past and avoiding me for things and she comes back its every week? i figured maybe thatd you check in or see each other every few months like he did with me when she lived there.... Anyways. She was over. Maybe shes still there. She loves to overstay and he never tells her to leave. He thinks i made this way too dramatic. But im not comfortable, not yet. But now i haven't heard from him and i know hes going to want to act like nothing happened and go back to normal. If i bring it up, its starting a fight, if leave it its ignoring how i feel. 

I dont want to be dramatic. I dont want to start a fight. But it was a big deal that he didnt care how i felt and even just talking to me to make me feel better about it. 

\------- 

I dont know how to handle this from here. I dont know what to say that wont start a fight. I do want to end it if this is the new routine with her. But i dont know how to say it without being crazy or the bad guy. I can't give him an ultamiumn, hed resent me. Any advice. please? Im not a spiteful or angry person but i can't figure out what to do or say that will draw my line without being some difficult female. I dont want him to feel hes on a leash but im not okay with this. so how do i do this?

but here's the thing I'm lowkey addicted to having a good relationship with her for once, Patricia gets all the emotional support and deep conversations that the real me never got.

She's planning to meet Patricia for coffee next week and I'm having a full breakdown, do I come clean and destroy the best relationship we've ever had or do I fake Patricias death. 

this is some next level chaos that I fully brought upon myself and I have no idea how to escape without traumatizing my own mother.

Throughout our lives. We interact with a ton of people.

We meet them when pumping our gas or sitting on the bus.

You see them when buying groceries or when they serve us coffee.

Sometimes we pass each other and smile, or we just simply pass each other

And keep it moving.

Nevertheless, whether directly or indirectly, countless bodies surround us.

Our lives collide briefly, and it's back to business as usual.

We meet some individuals for a split second, and others become our friends or even family, as we photograph and catalogue the memories we share in our hearts.

However, with all that being said, how often do we stop and reflect on those people?

When was the last time you took a moment to remember those who made a difference in¬†

your life, or is there even someone in your life who stands out to you at all?

As I write this, I think about how many people stopped to help me or even took the time to say hi and see how I was doing.¬†

I‚Äôve realized that appreciation goes a long way, yet we show it infrequently.¬†

It‚Äôs so easy to wake up in the morning, go about our daily lives, without a single thought or care for anyone else. We handle business, respect those who can help us push forward, and forget those who stood by our side. (unless you didn‚Äôt have anyone)

I implore you.¬† Take a moment or two.¬†

If there is anyone in your life who means the most to you, take the time to show some love.

Because life is but a viper. Which is here today and gone tomorrow, so you never know when you‚Äôll get the chance.",1,1750865638.0,motivation,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm looking for one emotionally intelligent, financially secure man who‚Äôs genuinely interested in building a long-term connection. Someone confident, consistent, kind, and clear about what he wants.

Physically, I‚Äôve been drawn to all types. My past partners have ranged from slim to fit to a little soft around the edges. What they had in common was that they took care of themselves. Impeccable hygiene, great style, and glasses with a cute smile behind them go a long way with me. I‚Äôm into men who look put together, smell good, and carry themselves with quiet confidence.

A little more about me

My happy places are quiet coffee shops, cozy bookstores, fancy dumpling spots, and live music venues. I love cooking, traveling, and gaming on both PC and Xbox. I have a cat and a long bucket list that includes visiting a Samoyed caf√© in South Korea. I‚Äôm the kind of person who‚Äôs just as happy dressed up at a rooftop bar as I am curled up on the couch splitting takeout with someone I adore.

1lk8sef,https://i.redd.it/h2514xf8d39f1.jpeg,What Happens In Vegas:,"Chapter 1

My head is killing me! What happened last night? I open my eyes to the sun just peaking over the mountains. The open window let‚Äôs in warmth, and I just know in an hour it‚Äôs going to be hot. Vegas is like that. Why on earth did someone decide to put a city in the middle of the desert? And that was before air conditioning. Seriously, what were they thinking. I slowly get out of bed to get my things, but when I look around, I notice I‚Äôm not in my room at all. Oh shei! I‚Äôm in his room. I look at the bed to see him still sleeping. Thank goodness for small miracles. I throw my clothes on and sprint to the door. Once I‚Äôm through, I close his door as quietly as possible.I‚Äôm safe inside my room as I lean my back against my door and heave a huge sigh of relief. I go over the itinerary from yesterday and try to remember what happened last night, but there‚Äôs nothing. I don‚Äôt remember a thing. Mr. Draven had a meeting at 8 p.m. and told me to wait for him to finish. I sat at the bar and sipped my Shirley Temple. Mr. Draven stumbled toward me, so I tried to help him, but I remember nothing after that.Just then the alarm on my phone begins to chime. Our flight is in a few hours, so I need to prepare. I walk to the washroom and it‚Äôs only then I notice my legs are weak and tired. My body aches in an area that has never ached before. No, no, no! No, it can't be. I didn‚Äôt sleep with him! I didn‚Äôt lose my virginity to my boss!I rush to the full-length mirror inside the washroom and strip down. I take deep calming breaths as warm tears slowly trickle down my face. I turn back around and look at my reflection. What have I done? I look at my body and feel a disconnect. That‚Äôs not my body. How could it be?My alarm rings again bringing me back to the present. I always set 2 alarms because I hate mornings. I have to get a move on. I quickly shower and pack my luggage. Mr. Draven hasn‚Äôt called me yet, so I know I must make sure he‚Äôs prepared to leave. He has appointments when we return, so no time can be wasted. I arrive at his door and take a deep breath. We‚Äôre both adults. It‚Äôs just something that happened. There‚Äôs no changing that. I knock on his door. ‚ÄúMr. Draven?‚Äù\*\*\*Fredrick‚Äôs POV:‚ÄúStop knocking. Ms. Lewis, get my suit ready and prepare some black coffee.‚Äù I get out of bed to prepare for my busy schedule. My head hurts more than usual. I take a quick shower and shave. I wrap a towel around my nether regions in case Ms. Lewis is still in my room. That woman drives me mad. She‚Äôs too beautiful to be real. She‚Äôs like a pin-up brought to life.My suit is laid out neatly just as it should be. I quickly dress and head out. Ms. Lewis has a travel mug prepared. Good. I think I‚Äôll keep her around. She‚Äôs the first intern to actually be of use. The last three were all useless. I can‚Äôt believe my assistant of 6 years decided to quit just to have a baby.‚ÄúSir, your itinerary for the day?‚Äù She asks me like it‚Äôs something we don‚Äôt do every morning. I nod and take a sip of coffee. Just the aroma calms my aching head and settles my nerves. ‚ÄúFlight is at 8 a.m. We should arrive back by 5 p.m. You have a board meeting at 5:30. That gives you 2 hours for office work. You are scheduled to meet Ms. Cavanagh at 7:45 p.m. for dinner.‚ÄùI nod and check my phone for emails. ‚ÄúMake sure my luggage is ready, call for my car, and make sure nothing gets left behind.‚Äù\*\*\*Julia‚Äôs POV:Okay. I guess sleeping with his assistant isn't a big deal for the high and mighty Mr. Draven. I do my job and get everything done quickly. I double check his room while he is lounging in the living area of the suite.While he was in the shower, I tidied the bed. Sure enough, evidence of our night together lies between the sheets. What‚Äôs done is done. There's no changing the past. I look at the bed again and sigh. I carefully comb through the room for anything left behind. I check the nightstand last. Inside the drawer is a black velvet box. I open it out of sheer curiosity. Inside is a beautiful diamond ring. Mr. Draven wouldn‚Äôt be so careless as to leave something as exquisite as this.I rush out to the living area. ‚ÄúMr. Draven, this was left behind. I'm sure it‚Äôs not intended for your luggage.‚Äù I set the box on the coffee table in front of him. He nods while continuing to read his emails. He takes a sip of his coffee then looks at the table.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not mine.‚Äù He returns to his emails when there is a knock at the door. I allow the bellhop in and point out the various suitcases. I receive a text alert that the car has arrived.‚ÄúSir, the car is downstairs.‚Äù He stands up and goes to head out but stops. He takes the box and opens it. There is a look of confusion on his face. He places the box down and checks his phone.‚ÄúMs. Lewis, check your business account.‚ÄùOkay‚Ä¶I pull up my bank account on my phone and show it to him. He looks over the list and returns my phone. He looks at his phone again and scratches the back of his neck. I know that move; he only does that when he‚Äôs frustrated. He puts the box in his suit jacket and grabs his coffee before tucking his phone away.‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚ÄùThe ride to the airport is short and we make our way through the VIP area. His plane is awaiting our arrival on the tarmac. We buckle in and are ready to set off.‚ÄúWould you care for a beverage this morning?‚Äù the gorgeous blond stewardess asks.‚ÄúNothing for me. Ms. Lewis, would you care for anything?‚Äù Mr. Draven‚Äôs ocean blue eyes look my way. I realize how hungry I am. I haven‚Äôt had a chance to eat anything.‚ÄúOrange juice, please. Also, can I please have a blueberry bagel with cream cheese and some grapes. The stewardess nods and retreats.‚ÄúMs. Lewis, did you enjoy your visit?‚ÄùI gulp. Oh no. Is he bringing up last night? Avoid it. Just pretend nothing happened. Don't make a big deal of it. If he wants to talk about last night, he'll bring it up.‚ÄúLas Vegas was exactly as it appears in movies. I was amazed.‚ÄùHis lush lips turn up slightly. ‚ÄúDid you enjoy your evening?‚ÄùI clear my throat. Like he doesn‚Äôt know. I feel my cheeks flush as I swipe a stray hair over my ear. ‚ÄúI-I‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúYour dish, ma'am.‚Äù The stewardess arrives with a tray and saves me from having to continue.‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù I look up. Mr. Draven has returned to his phone. He then pulls out his laptop and begins working. After eating, I pull out my laptop and begin working as well. The flight goes by quickly.I‚Äôm at my desk reading the email from my school. Friday is the last day of my internship. Intern, my ass. I fulfilled the role as his assistant. It was the only position available when I applied for my internship at Draven & Baker.My inbox chimes with a new email. I open it.‚ÄúMs. Lewis. As your internship comes to a close, we are left with an open position for Mr. Draven‚Äôs assistant. Mr. Draven is satisfied with your work over the last 3 months and would like to offer the position to you. Please respond with your resume to the HR department ASAP. Pay and benefits will be discussed at a later time. Thank you for your attention. -Mrs. Harvey.‚ÄùMrs. Harvey is Mr. Draven‚Äôs personal secretary. She is a kind lady in her 40s. It‚Äôs rumored that she makes 6 figures. Mr. Draven‚Äôs assistant would make even more. OMG!Mr. Draven‚Äôs office door opens. He stops in front of my desk while looking at his cell phone. ‚ÄúI will be returning to Las Vegas in 2 weeks. Make sure everything is arranged. Perhaps a different hotel.‚ÄùI nod. ‚ÄúYes, air. Any preference?‚ÄùWithout looking up he answers, ‚ÄúNone. I‚Äôm out for the day. As soon as you‚Äôre finished, you may go.‚ÄùAlrighty then. I begin searching online.He doesn‚Äôt wait for a response before heading to his private elevator. I search through the hotels and pick one at random then prepare to arrange his personal plane. He didn‚Äôt tell me how long his stay would be, so I pull up his schedule. Of course, it‚Äôs jam packed. I send him a text.Me: Mr. Draven, your schedule is full for the time you plan to go to Las Vegas. When would you like to go and for how long? I will need to rearrange your schedule.‚ÄùHe instantly responds.Mr. Draven: I will be staying for two weeks beginning Thursday. Clear your schedule as well.I guess he assumes I‚Äôm taking the position as his assistant, but I have yet to decide.\*\*\*Fredrick‚Äôs POV:I enter the restaurant and go straight to my table. I get the same one every time.‚ÄúDarling, you‚Äôre finally here. It‚Äôs not like you to be late,‚Äù my shrew of a fianc√©e tells me.I unbutton my jacket and take my seat. ‚ÄúMy meeting ran over.‚Äù I offer no apology to Ms. Cavanagh. I could care less about the shallow stick figure in front of me.She‚Äôs the daughter of my father‚Äôs partner, Mr. Baker. Father wants us to marry, but I can‚Äôt stand her. He thinks it will be good for the company, but I plan to buy them out instead. They‚Äôre just dead weight. The waiter pours wine that she must have ordered. I don‚Äôt drink wine, never have, but she insists.I take a sip and look at the waiter. ‚ÄúThe usual.‚ÄùThe waiter nods and looks to Shelby. ‚ÄúScallops.‚Äù The waiter nods and retreats. ‚ÄúDarling, how was Vegas? You must take me with you next time. I missed you too much while you were away.‚Äù She sips her wine. I look toward the waiter and hold up my wine glass. He nods and brings me my scotch. Everyone here knows what is expected, which is why I come here so often.‚ÄúI was there for work. It was not a vacation.‚Äù I drink my scotch as the waiter brings out our food. Of course, she has to take a picture and post it to social media.‚ÄúWhen we‚Äôre married will you bring me along on your trips? I‚Äôll be so bored waiting for you all alone.‚Äù I grunt in response.We eat in silence, which is good because her talking grates on my nerves. All she ever talks about is entertainment gossip and shopping. Why would I give a damn about either of those things?‚ÄúExcuse me,"" I say as I stand up. I take my jacket off and proceed to the washroom. I return to my table and notice my jacket is not how I left it. I pick it up and put it back on.‚ÄúI ordered dessert,‚Äù Shelby tells me.I grunt and sit down. I don‚Äôt eat sweets. She should know that by now. I look to the waiter with my scotch glass. He brings me another and places a plate in the middle of the table. Shelby begins picking at the sugar concoction. After two bites, she places her fork down. She eats like a damn bird, so why does she even order anything? She only takes three or four small bites. It‚Äôs maddening. I need to get away from her. She drives me nuts.‚ÄúMy schedule is full coming up. I won‚Äôt have time for casual meetings,‚Äù I tell her.‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all right. We have the gala coming up soon. Remember, we are getting our marriage license tomorrow as well. I can visit you at the office in the meantime. Darling, you still have not given me a new ring. I expect it soon. All my friends are asking to see it. How can I show my face without my ring?‚ÄùI down my scotch. ‚ÄúI gave you a ring. Why must you have a new one?‚ÄùShe sips her wine. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so silly. That diamond was not the right cut. I‚Äôve told you this. You know, you never did actually propose properly. When you get my new ring, you can do it then.‚ÄùI glare at her, silencing her. ‚ÄúWe already made arrangements. I will not get on my knee and grovel to you. The ring you have is sufficient. If you disagree, maybe the wedding should be canceled.‚ÄùHer mouth hangs open and tears flow from her face. ‚ÄúNo, darling. You can‚Äôt mean that.‚ÄùI pass her a napkin. ‚ÄúAll right, that‚Äôs enough. It‚Äôs still on, but no more talk about another ring.‚ÄùShe nods and wipes her face. She pulls a mirror from her handbag and touches up her make up. I stand and escort her out.Shelby and I have been engaged for two years now. In all that time we‚Äôve only slept together twice. Both times she drugged me. I know because I woke up feeling like shei. I have a doctor on retainer, so had him run blood work. I never drink from a glass I haven‚Äôt seen poured myself whenever she‚Äôs around. She doesn‚Äôt do anything for me. I‚Äôm not attracted to her at all.But Ms. Lewis‚Ä¶that body should be in magazines. She is stunning. Her body is like Betty Page‚Äôs or Marilyn Monroe‚Äôs‚Äîvoluptuous, curves in all the right places, and a narrow waist. She gets me going, which is why I try not to look at her as much as possible. Her brown hair is usually tied up in a bun and her face is hidden behind glasses, but her skin looks smooth and soft. Her lips are dark and thick and makes me want to take a bite out of them.Shelby, on the other hand, she‚Äôs a basic model. She‚Äôs too skinny with a flat chest, although I‚Äôm pretty sure she recently had her boobs enhanced. Her face is covered in makeup and her lips look like a blowfish, which I know she gets done regularly.Shelby gets in the car as I get ready to drive. One of my few hobbies is cars. The other is billiards. I am addicted to the rush of a fast car. I speed off in my black BMW M4. It‚Äôs my normal, everyday car, but I have a collection of others.‚ÄúDarling, why don‚Äôt we just go to your place? You‚Äôve been away too long.‚Äù She wraps her claws around my forearm.I glare at her hand and pull away from her grasp. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm busy.‚Äù I drive even faster to her place. She kisses my cheek before stepping out of the car. I speed away before she can even close the door. I pull out a handkerchief and wipe away the lipstick that I‚Äôm sure she left behind.When I get home, I pull into my garage. My cars are lined up like a showroom. It‚Äôs a beautiful sight. I head to my room. I empty my pockets onto the dresser in my closet.The ring box grabs my attention. I bought a ring last night. I know I bought it because the jeweler was listed on my bank app. Why the hell did I buy a ring? I open it up and take a look. It‚Äôs dainty with a simple filigree design. Not at all what Shelby would like. No wonder she brought up the subject of a new ring. She probably assumed it was for her and didn‚Äôt like it.I pull the ring out of the box and take a closer look. The band looks larger than Shelby‚Äôs size as well. Who did I buy a ring for? What did I do last night? I don‚Äôt remember buying a ring. Hell, I don‚Äôt remember anything after meeting up with Jarret. That bastard, what did he do to me? I hardly had anything to drink, but I still woke up with a headache.I dial my college buddy. ‚ÄúWhat did you do to me last night?‚ÄùI hear a short pause on the other line. ‚ÄúHey bud, did you enjoy your night? That assistant of yours is smoking. How was she?‚ÄùMy hand automatically goes to the back of my neck. ‚ÄúWhat the fork are you talking about? What did you do?‚ÄùThe bastard laughs. ‚ÄúJust helping you out, man. You‚Äôre always too uptight. It wasn‚Äôt that strong. Did it do the trick?‚ÄùHe drugged me. The son of a batch forking drugged me. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything. I woke up alone and can‚Äôt remember a thing. If anything happened, she didn‚Äôt say anything.‚Äù‚ÄúHer too? Ah man, what a waste. I was trying to do you a favor and you can‚Äôt even remember. Why do I even bother? Next time you‚Äôre out here, I‚Äôll make it up to you both.‚ÄùI grunt. ‚ÄúSure, right after I kick your ass.‚ÄùI swear next time I see him he‚Äôs getting a broken jaw. I click off the phone. I go to my gym and work out. I try to remember anything from last night, but there is really nothing. I shower and head to bed, I have an early day tomorrow.

**Chapter 2**

I hate government buildings. I would never walk into one if I didn‚Äôt have to apply in person. Why am I doing this? My father wants me to marry. Grandfather blocked some of my shares until I‚Äôm married, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm doing this. Wicked old man.‚ÄúNext."" The window attendant calls. Shelby hands over the paperwork. The woman looks through the papers and inputs information into her computer. ‚ÄúDo you have ID, sir?‚Äù I hand over my license and social security card. The woman looks at me. ‚ÄúSir in the United States plural marriage is illegal.‚ÄùI nod. ‚ÄúOkay? Thanks for that information. I don‚Äôt plan to have multiple wives. One is bad enough.‚ÄùShelby scoffs next to me. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not funny.‚Äù She thinks I‚Äôm joking.‚ÄúWell sir, according to my information you already have a wife.‚Äù The clerk tells me. Oh fork! I close my eyes and grunt. Vegas‚Ä¶Shelby is the first to respond ‚ÄúWhat!? How can he already be married? Darling, what‚Äôs going on?‚Äù She clings to my arm with all her might.‚ÄúMiss, as this matter is only in his name, I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôll have to ask you to step away for privacy concerns.‚ÄùOf course, Shelby loses her shei. ‚ÄúThis is public record. I'm not going anywhere. Do you know who I am! I will sue the shei out of you. Fix this now!‚ÄùI pull Shelby to the side. ‚ÄúLet me handle this. Just calm down and stop making a scene. You‚Äôre embarrassing me. I don‚Äôt need to be in tomorrow‚Äôs headlines because of you.‚ÄùShe scoffs. ‚ÄúBecause of me? Who‚Äôs the one that is married?‚Äù She crosses her arms and tilts her chin up.‚ÄúAlright, just let me go find out what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù She scoffs again but doesn‚Äôt move. I walk back to the counter. ‚ÄúMadam, please give me the information you have.‚Äù The lady has no response but prints off a paper and hands it over. I read the paper and rub the back of my neck.‚ÄúIf you want an annulment, you and your wife will have to file paperwork then get it notarized. People think Vegas weddings are a joke, but they actually are legal. Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôre not the first one this has happened to.‚ÄùI nod and say a sarcastic, ‚ÄúThanks,‚Äù and walk out the door.Shelby catches up to me outside just as I get to my car. ‚ÄúDarling, what do we do now?‚ÄùI open her door then walk around to my own seat. ‚ÄúI'll take you back. I must meet with my father.‚ÄùShelby grabs hold of my arm, ‚ÄúDarling, we‚Äôre still getting married. You made a deal with daddy. You better not back out if it.‚Äù I speed to Shelby‚Äôs place and let her out.My Father‚Äôs house is just down the way so it‚Äôs a quick trip. I walk through the door and am greeted by the butler, Sam. ‚ÄúGood day, young Sir. Senior Mr. Draven is on the terrace.‚Äù He closes the door behind me.‚ÄúThank you, Sam.‚Äù I walk out to see a new bimbo sitting on Father‚Äôs lap. ‚ÄúFather, a word.‚Äù Sam comes out with a tray of scotch and two glasses as father sends his new plaything away.‚ÄúWhere is Shelby? Don‚Äôt tell me the two of you are on the rocks again. You need to hurry up and marry that girl. Steve is starting to get on my nerves.‚ÄùI shoot my drink and pour another. ‚ÄúYes, well. We agreed that I would only have to marry once. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here. Jarret drugged me while I was in Vegas, and I somehow ended up getting married. Shelby and I just found out while we were attempting to get our marriage license.‚ÄùFather stares me down while he takes a drink. ‚ÄúLooks like you lucked out. You get your shares and avoid marrying Baker‚Äôs daughter. Is your new wife some stripper? Wouldn‚Äôt that just put the cherry on top.‚Äù He takes another drink.‚ÄúThis was not planned, as I‚Äôve already mentioned, I was drugged. And no, she‚Äôs not a stripper. She‚Äôs actually my new assistant. Jarret drugged the both of us. I doubt she even knows yet. Either way, the deal was to be married for a year before I can divorce. Does this deal still stand? I can get an annulment, but I will not be married more than once. You know my temperament.‚ÄùFather nods his head. He takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. ‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs done then. One year minimum still stands. As for Baker you can deal with that issue yourself.‚Äù\*\*\*Julia‚Äôs POV:I don‚Äôt know what to do. Do I want to be his assistant? It‚Äôs a lot of money. I would never have to worry about bills, that‚Äôs for sure. Dad‚Äôs medical debt is really the most important issue, not to mention all the school loans. For Dad I should just suck it up and take the job. Mr. Draven is really not difficult to handle. People say he‚Äôs scary, but I don‚Äôt see it. He‚Äôs intimidating, but that could be said of any powerful businessman. Not to mention how gorgeous he is. Dark wavy hair and bronzed skin are just what is visible when he‚Äôs sharply dressed in his suits. The way they hug his body, it‚Äôs obvious he works out. It would just be so awkward knowing I slept with him. And he‚Äôs engaged. That makes me a home wrecker too. Oh, I‚Äôm a terrible person.My phone chimes, the caller ID showing the hospital. ‚ÄúThis is Julia Lewis.‚Äù‚ÄúMs. Lewis. This is Dr. Torres. Your father‚Äôs dose needs to be increased and I think we need to add another medication. He seems to be steady, but I believe the medication wears off too early. Also, he‚Äôs showing signs of depression.‚ÄùI close my eyes and let out a breath. ‚ÄúOf course. If that‚Äôs what he needs. I‚Äôll be by to visit him later today.‚Äù I hang up the phone and turn back to my monitor. The email from Mrs. Harvey is front and center. What choice do I have? I send in my resume.I look up from my monitor into a pair of piercing deep sea eyes. I gasp from the surprise. ‚ÄúMs. Lewis.‚ÄùI regain my composure, ‚ÄúMr. Draven. What can I do for you?‚Äù His hand goes to the back of his neck. Oh shei.‚ÄúMake me a cup of coffee and meet me in my office. We have matters to discuss.‚Äù He walks into his office. I stand up and smooth out my calf length pencil skirt and re-tuck my blouse. I head to the coffee machine and prepare his cup. He‚Äôs on a phone call when I walk in. I place his cup down and take a seat on the white suede sofa. I get my paper pad ready for any notes. He hangs up his phone and rings his secretary, ‚ÄúMrs. Harvey, I am not to be disturbed.‚ÄùMr. Draven grabs his coffee and comes to join me on the sofa. I hold my breath. ‚ÄúMs. Lewis, I received your resume,‚Äù that was fast. I let out my breath. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you will be staying on. We can discuss your pay and benefits. If you have any issues, please speak up. Once your contract is signed, we will not be making changes. Contracts are renewed annually. Everything will be emailed to you in detail. Look over it and contact me directly with any issues or questions. Understood?‚ÄùI nod, ‚ÄúYes, sir. Thank you for the opportunity.‚ÄùHe takes a sip of his coffee, then speaks again. ‚ÄúNow about Vegas‚Ä¶‚Äù His eyes penetrate me, and I can‚Äôt help but bite down on my lip. He clears his throat. ‚ÄúI have no recollection of the last night there. My buddy Jarret informed me that he drugged both of us. I assume you have no recollection as well.‚ÄùMy mouth falls open. Drugged? ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù I close my eyes and take a calming breath. I open my eyes and look at Mr. Draven. ‚ÄúI was drinking a soda at the bar where you left me. I remember you coming out if the room, but you were stumbling a little. The next thing I know, I woke up in your room. I was frightened so I went back to my room. That‚Äôs all I remember.‚ÄùHe nods, then asks, ‚ÄúDid we have six?‚Äù I fidget with my pen and can no longer look him in the eye. His hand reaches over to stop my fidgeting. His touch is very distracting. ‚ÄúIs that a yes?‚Äù I clear my throat and look up. I nod slightly. A tear escapes my eye. Mr. Draven gently wipes my tear away. ‚ÄúWas I that terrible?‚Äù He chuckles. I can tell he‚Äôs trying to make things easier for me.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that‚Ä¶I mean, I don‚Äôt know. I mean I‚Ä¶it‚Ä¶it‚Ä¶was my first time.‚ÄùMr. Draven‚Äôs hand goes to the back of his neck. ‚ÄúShei. I‚Äôm very sorry, Ms. Lewis. I understand the first time is supposed to be meaningful. You must be feeling violated right now. As you should. We both should.‚ÄùMr. Draven stands up and walks to his desk. ‚ÄúPlease understand I don‚Äôt sleep around and I‚Äôm clean. You don‚Äôt have to worry about STIs.‚Äù He reaches into his drawer. ‚ÄúI believe this is yours.‚Äù He places a black box on the coffee table in front of me. Just as I had done in Vegas.I pick up the box and peer at the diamond ring I know is inside. ‚ÄúWhy would this belong to me?‚Äù I look up at him in confusion.‚ÄúI bought it that night. I found the purchase on my bank card. See if it fits. Please.‚ÄùI slip the ring on; it‚Äôs a perfect fit. I quickly take it off and hand it back. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt keep this. You bought it. It belongs to you.‚ÄùHe refuses to take the box. ‚ÄúWhy would I buy a ring for myself?‚ÄùTouch√©. ‚ÄúSir, why would you buy a ring for me?‚ÄùHe sits back down and finishes off his coffee. ‚ÄúBecause apparently you and I got married.‚ÄùMy paper pad slips to the floor. I‚Äôm totally shocked. ‚ÄúWhat? Huh?‚Äù I‚Äôm married? I‚Äôm married to this gorgeous man sitting in front of me? The man I lost my virginity to. My boss, the head honcho of Draven & Baker. I hold my head with both hands. This is insane. I haven‚Äôt even graduated college yet, how can I be married. Insane. This can‚Äôt be real. A bottle of water is thrust in front of my face. The lid has already been removed so I take a few big gulps, not at all ladylike. My hand is shaking when I place the half empty bottle on the coffee table.‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry to spring this on you. You are innocent in all of this mess; however, I have no intention of releasing you from our marriage. I only ever intended to be married once in my lifetime. I am not a man that believes in fate, but I do believe in extenuating circumstances.‚Äù Mr. Draven picks up my water bottle and takes a drink before setting it back down. He takes a paper from his desk. ‚ÄúThis is proof that you and I are legally married.‚ÄùI reach up to inspect this mythical proof. Sure enough, we were married while in Vegas. There‚Äôs a date, two signatures, and an official seal from the state of Nevada. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your wife?‚Äù I repeat timidly. Mr. Draven nods. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre my husband.‚Äù I state the obvious just as timidly. Again, he nods. ‚ÄúWhat do‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúDeep breath, Ms. Lewis. Or I‚Äôm sorry, your first name is‚Ä¶?‚ÄùI giggle at how ridiculous this is. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre married and you don‚Äôt even know my name.‚Äù I pick up the water bottle and take another gulp before placing it back down.Mr. Draven goes to his desk, most likely in search of my name. I start getting hot, my head pounds, and my collar is beginning to bother me. I unbutton just the top button, toss my glasses on the table and pull my hair out of its bun. I finger comb my hair out. I‚Äôm fanning myself with one hand and rubbing my head with the other. This is all too much.I hear my name being called. ‚ÄúJulia. I understand that this is a lot to take in, but please remember we are in my office. I will need you to tidy yourself up again before you leave.‚Äù Leave? Duh, I can‚Äôt very well stay in here. If I went back out like this, people would get the wrong idea.I nod. ‚ÄúMr. Draven, this is‚Ä¶‚Äù what? What is this? ‚ÄúThis is very shocking. I promise I will get control of myself. I just need a few more minutes.‚ÄùHe waits patiently at his desk. ‚ÄúYou may use my washroom. And when we are not in another‚Äôs company you may call me Fredrick.‚Äù I zombie walk to the washroom and splash cool water on my face. My hands are barely holding me up as I‚Äôm leaning onto the sink. My legs are weak and shaking.‚ÄúJulia.‚Äù A soft white towel is handed to me. I accept it and wipe my face. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think too much on it. You‚Äôve been by my side for three months now. You know how I am, and I trust you. We can continue our discussion tonight over dinner. This weekend you can move in.‚ÄùI turn to face him. ‚ÄúMove in? Mr. Draven‚Ä¶‚Äù It‚Äôs at that moment I realize how close we are standing, but I have no room to step back.His ocean eyes stare me down. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Fredrick. Yes, move in. You are my wife now. Of course, we should live together.‚Äù I have no response. His raises his hand and runs it gently through my hair. My breath catches and I look him in the eye. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre quite pretty. I like your hair down. It‚Äôs best to keep it up while we‚Äôre working, though. It would be too distracting otherwise.‚Äù He holds up my glasses and hair ties in his other hand. I take them and he leaves the room.I tidy myself up. When I‚Äôm finally composed, I head back into his office. I‚Äôve had time to collect myself, at least enough to get me through the rest of the day. ‚ÄúMr. Draven, will there be anything else?‚Äù I ask as I pick up my pad and pen.‚ÄúThat will be all Mrs. Draven.‚Äù I stop in my tracks and look at his beautiful face. His lips are tilted up in a flirty smirk. He‚Äôs messing with me now. I shake my head and smile to myself. I open the door and return to my seat. As soon as I sit down, I get a text. Mrs. Draven, Remember to look through your contract. Also, please keep this matter private for the time being. I would hate to be a part of office gossip. I reply with one simple word‚Ä¶Duh!

**Chapter 3**

You‚Äôve really screwed me over, you bastard.‚Äù I‚Äôm at my desk going over files when Jarrett calls me.‚ÄúWhat did I do this time?‚Äù I don‚Äôt need to keep anything from Jarret, he‚Äôs been my best friend since day one of college.‚ÄúYour little stunt. She was a virgin, you asshole.‚Äù I know that will get him to feel a little bad for what he did.‚ÄúAh shei, man. I just knew you wanted her since you kept staring at her the whole time you were here.‚ÄùI stared at her? Sure, I noticed her. Who wouldn‚Äôt? She‚Äôs a knockout. But to stare at her. That‚Äôs something I always tried to avoid. I let out a breath of frustration and continue. ‚ÄúNot only that, but somehow we got married while we were in our drug induced state. Now Shelby‚Äôs pissed. She‚Äôs tried calling a few times already, but I‚Äôm ignoring her calls. My Father thinks I did this on purpose, and now I have to somehow smooth it all over with Stephen Baker.‚ÄùJarett laughs more and more as I ramble on. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a big deal. Just get it annulled.‚ÄùI roll my eyes. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not getting it annulled.‚Äù‚ÄúWhat? Are you crazy? Why wouldn‚Äôt you get it annulled?‚ÄùI stand up and walk to my floor to ceiling windows and look out over the city. ‚ÄúYou know better than anyone, I always said I‚Äôm only getting married once, and that is only because of the shares. After a year I‚Äôll divorce her and send her on her way.‚Äù‚Ä¶Jarret doesn‚Äôt say a word. After a short while he finally speaks. ‚ÄúSo, what you‚Äôre really saying is I did you a favor. Your wife is smoking hot, and you get out of marrying that whiny bimbo your father has shoved down your throat. This will probably piss off Baker and he‚Äôll want to cut ties‚Ä¶You are welcome, my friend.‚Äù Jarret hangs up‚Ä¶I‚Äôm speechless.‚ÄúSir, Ms. Cavanagh is here to see you.‚Äù My guards on the ground floor warn me.‚ÄúI want four guards stationed outside my office after she enters. She may need an escort out,‚Äù I respond. My guards are the best. They‚Äôve had to escort Shelby out a few times, along with many others. Even they don‚Äôt like Shelby, but they know their place and would never speak out. They‚Äôre all trained in weaponry, shooting, and hand to hand combat. I send them to Taiwan for a year for even more extensive training. They are damned good at what they do, and they have never lost. They better be good. I pay them top [dollar.My](http://dollar.My) office door opens, and I don‚Äôt even move. ‚ÄúDarling, have you fixed this yet? Who is this slut that would dare to do this? If I find her, I will destroy her. Don‚Äôt you worry. She‚Äôll never be able to show her face in society.‚ÄùI turn around, my gaze is enough to stop her squawking. ‚ÄúThis matter is resolved.‚Äù She smiles and struts toward me. I stop her in her tracks by saying; ‚Äúthe marriage is official and will remain.‚Äù All color leaves her painted face, and her mouth drops open like a fish out of water. It‚Äôs a hilarious site, but I keep a straight face. ‚ÄúI will speak to your father about our arrangement. You may go.‚ÄùNow her face turns red. I can see her little brain smoking, trying to figure out how to handle this. I walk to my desk to keep from laughing at her. You would think after two years she would have grown on me. That‚Äôs not the case. ‚ÄúDarling, what about me? What am I supposed to do? What will I tell my friends? How can I show my face?‚Äù Her anger gets more obvious with each question.‚ÄúWhat you do is of no concern to me anymore.‚ÄùI can feel her attitude shift, here come the tears, right on cue. ‚ÄúDarling, how can you say that? We've been together for so long. I love you. You can‚Äôt just leave me like this. This is just some computer error. You‚Äôre not really married, you can‚Äôt be. You‚Äôre mine and we‚Äôre meant to be together.‚ÄùI should give her a little face. We have been together for so long. Of course, she‚Äôs attached to me. ‚ÄúShelby. I understand you‚Äôre upset, but it‚Äôs done. You and I cannot and will not be together in the future. This circumstance is a shock to all of us, including my new wife. Take some time and regain yourself, then move on. I am no longer available.‚Äù Shelby‚Äôs wails get even more absurd. I‚Äôm sure my entire floor can hear her. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but this is the new reality. I will take care to cancel all of the wedding arrangements. You won‚Äôt have to worry about anything on my end. As an apology I will send you to Milan for fashion week. But I must ask you to leave at this time. I have work to do.‚ÄùShelby stands up ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere. You are going to fix this!‚ÄùI stand up. ‚ÄúI have said all there is to say regarding this matter. I have work to do. You are excused.‚Äù Shelby doesn‚Äôt move. ‚ÄúLeave now, or I will have you escorted out. It‚Äôs your choice.‚Äù Shelby crosses her arms and raises her chin. ‚ÄúVery well.‚Äù I press a knob on my desk. Immediately four of my guards walk in. ‚ÄúEscort Ms. Cavanagh out of my building. She is not allowed access without my express permission.‚ÄùShe stomps her foot like a petulant toddler. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre banning me? You bastard! This is all your fault. I am the victim, but you‚Äôre throwing me out.‚Äù I look to my lead guard, Corey. He gently takes both of her shoulders and steers her out.I sit down in my chair and lean my head back with my eyes closed. That could have gone worse. A light knock sounds at my door. ‚ÄúEnter.‚ÄùJulia walks into my office with a bottle of water. She removes the cap and hands me the bottle. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about Ms. Cavanagh. I feel like this is my fault.‚ÄùI take a drink and give the bottle back to her. ‚ÄúThank you. Don‚Äôt worry about her. I‚Äôm actually relieved that we‚Äôre over. My Father was forcing her on me. You are not at fault for any of this.‚ÄùShe sits down on the sofa and crosses her legs. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a bit of a relief, but I still feel bad for Ms. Cavanagh. We can get it annulled, you and I are not really in a relationship.‚ÄùI stare her down. ‚Äú

SOOO I've decided to take on the lease solo. This does NOT require a lease signing. My roommate has 2 cats so you must be ok with cats.

ABOUT THE ROOM:

The rental breakdown is $1750 for the big bedroom. This doesn't include utilities. A deposit of $ 1,750 and the first month's rent are required upon move-in.

The bedroom is spacious with two floor-to-ceiling closets, two windows, and lots of floor space. It comes unfurnished, but some items are optional to keep if you'd like.

ABOUT THE AREA:

We have a coffee shop directly across the street, a Wholesome Gourmet Market for snacks and other items just 200 feet from our doorstep, a laundromat, grocery store, and a local hardware store, all within a block. Good food delivery. We're right by the 2/5 and an easy walk to the Q, B, and Prospect Park.

We've all had an easy flow living together, and our neighbors are great. Tell me a little about yourself; I hope you'll be the right fit to check out the space!

# ABOUT ME:

I am a 30-something LGBTQ+ woman, a graphic designer who works at a garden during the day, and am a student at a design school.

When I'm home, I'm often doing homework, freelance graphic design work, or chilling out watching a movie or TV show (Taskmaster is my current comfort watch).

I'm sociable, tidy, and a people-person, but I know when to keep to myself. I leave the apartment for all of my socializing, but I enjoy having guests and people in the house.

I've lived in BK for a little over 4 years.

# OTHER ROOMMATE:

Audio engineer who works varying hours at a recording studio. She's in her 20s and has 2 cats.

RENTAL REQUIREMENTS:

1lk8q0d,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lk8q0d,"Dark debris in cat‚Äôs ear, no scratching: Ear mites?","I found some dark, crumbly debris inside my cat's ear (photo below) and I‚Äôm not sure what to make of it. His behavior seems totally normal. He doesn‚Äôt scratch his ears more than usual, no head shaking, and he doesn't seem bothered when I touch the area.

There‚Äôs no bad smell, and no visible swelling or redness apart from the debris itself. It looks a bit like coffee grounds, which I‚Äôve read could be a sign of ear mites.

Can ear mites show up without itching or other symptoms? Or could this be something else like dirt, wax buildup, or a yeast or bacterial issue?

I think he is currently in a different country working i think, and i have been feeling really bad because of the way she has been acting with me, if i was her boyfriend i definitely wouldn‚Äôt like it.

It has started off like a nice friendship and i havent been catching any feelings because i had in mind, oh she has a boyfriend, nothings gonna happen, but lately i have been thinking about her more often. Trust me if she was single i would be all down for it.

I kinda want to some boundaries but i fear she is gonna think that i have gotten a wrong idea, or maybe shes just friendly and i have will lose the friendship, also secretly i am hoping she will break up with him but i dont think thats happening, considering what i have heard about her relationship with her bf.

Embarking on a romantic luxury getaway in Europe offers an unparalleled opportunity to connect with your partner and embrace the beauty around you. However, to truly savor each moment, it's essential to focus on how to feel present and peaceful during your trip. Here are some tips to enhance your experience. 

First, immerse yourself in the local culture. Whether you are sipping coffee in a Parisian caf√© or enjoying a gondola ride in Venice, engage your senses. Taste the cuisine, admire the architecture, and listen to the sounds of the city. This conscious awareness allows you to feel more connected to your surroundings and your partner.

Another vital aspect is creating a distraction-free environment. Disconnect from technology as much as possible. Set aside your phone and embrace each moment with your loved one. This practice cultivates a peaceful atmosphere, making way for deeper conversations and experiences.

Consider incorporating mindfulness practices like meditation or deep-breathing exercises into your daily routine while traveling. By taking a few moments to center yourself, you can find peace amidst the excitement. Early morning walks or sunset views can also provide the ideal backdrop for these practices.


  Choose luxurious accommodations that offer serene retreats, such as spa services or tranquil gardens.
  Engage in activities that promote connection, such as cooking classes or wine tastings, to make memories together.
  Plan downtime into your itinerary to reflect on your experiences and appreciate the moment.


With these strategies, your romantic luxury getaway in Europe can transform into a deeply fulfilling journey. Prioritizing present-moment awareness allows you to weave tranquility into your travels, making each moment with your partner truly special.

I'm Level 114 and everyday I try to produce in buildings that are not 3 Stars yet.

Since I don't like that some buildings only have products that either takes too much resources or they don't have anything that takes 45 minutes and more to make, I just don't make an effort to make it a 3 Stars.

Like the following:

**Fondue Pot (I might produce 2 items a day)**

**Perfumerie (when I have extra oils I do it but it will never end)**

The following Production Buildings I fill up in morning and night but it will take time to get to 3 Stars:

**Coffee Kiosk (I'm at 607/960, my guess is end of Summer it will be 3 stars)**

**Tea Stand (832/1152, hoping for end Summer for 3 Starss)**

**Waffle Maker (I do 5 Waffles a day, it will take forever to get to 3 Stars, I'm not even at 1 star)**

I managed to get 3 Stars on those because it was easy to get produce for them:

**Esential Oils Lab (I mainly did Ginger and Mint to master this one)**

**Yogurt Maker**

**Fudge Shop**

**Stew Pot**

**Donut Maker**

1lk8mxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1lk8mxw/exact_change/,Exact change.,"You ever stare at something so long that it stops looking real? I don‚Äôt mean metaphorically. I mean really stops looking like what it is. That‚Äôs what happened to me with the road. Just asphalt and paint and headlights, stretched into infinity, but after a while, it stops being a road. It becomes a loop. A repetition. A rut.

They say hell is repetition. That was before I knew what hell really felt like.

I‚Äôm a toll booth operator. Booth #7. Graveyard shift. Midnight to 8 a.m. Interstate 86 just outside of Ashridge, New York. If you blinked, you‚Äôd miss the town. Hell, most people do miss it. I did. I was just looking for a job that required the least interaction with people. Something boring. Stable.

I got exactly what I wanted.

At first.


---

The first month was uneventful. A few semis barreling through at two in the morning, the occasional drunk college kid heading home with vomit on his shirt and a Red Bull in his cupholder. Most people used E-ZPass. Those who didn‚Äôt paid cash. A few paid in change. Quarters mostly. I got used to the rhythm of it all. The whirr of the mechanical arm lifting and lowering. The muted clink of coins dropping into the metal tray. The hum of fluorescents above me.

It was quiet. Predictable.

Then came the blue LeBaron.

It was around 3:17 a.m. on a Tuesday. I remember because I always kept a log. It gave me something to do. A little ritual.
‚ÄúBlue Chrysler LeBaron. NY plates. Driver wore wide-brimmed hat. Gloved hands. Paid in quarters. No eye contact. No words spoken.‚Äù

It stood out because no one drives that model anymore. The paint was faded. One headlight was dimmer than the other, like a lazy eye. It rolled up without sound. No radio. No engine noise. Just glided.

The driver extended a leather-gloved hand out the window and dropped $1.25 in exact change into my palm. Not a penny more or less. Then he drove off. Slow.

Didn‚Äôt think much of it‚Äîuntil the next night.

Same time. Same car. Same driver. Same $1.25 in quarters. Same silence.

Then the third night. And the fourth. Each night at precisely 3:17 a.m., the LeBaron appeared, always in the same lane, always drifting up like a ghost, always paying in exact change.

On the fifth night, I tried to get a better look at him. I leaned out of the booth, just slightly, as he approached. But the brim of his hat was low, and the interior of the car seemed unnaturally dark, like the dashboard light refused to exist.

His hand came out, slow and patient, and when he dropped the coins into my palm, I noticed something.

The quarters were‚Ä¶ old. Not just worn. Wrong.

One had an eagle design I‚Äôd never seen. Another had the wrong date font. One had no date at all. I even swear one said ‚ÄúConfederate States of America.‚Äù

But the booth didn‚Äôt reject them. It accepted the payment. The gate rose.

He drove off again, his car melting into the black stretch of highway like it had never been there.


---

I stopped writing about him in the log after that. Somehow, putting it on paper felt like giving it power. Or permanence.

After a few weeks, I started dreaming about the LeBaron. I‚Äôd be standing in the middle of the road, headlights blinding me, frozen. The car wouldn‚Äôt stop. It would hit me. And I‚Äôd wake up gasping for air with the sound of coins clattering against concrete echoing in my ears.

I tried to tell my supervisor, Barry. He was in charge of the whole booth operation. Nice guy. Smelled like old ketchup. He laughed when I mentioned it.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre lucky you got some regulars,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMost nights it‚Äôs tumbleweeds.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I muttered, ‚Äúbut this guy... I don‚Äôt know. Something feels off.‚Äù

Barry shrugged. ‚ÄúYou sure you‚Äôre not just bored? I‚Äôve seen the night shift eat people alive. Makes you start seeing things.‚Äù

But I wasn‚Äôt seeing things. The guy was real. His coins were real. I started keeping them. Hiding them in a cigar box under the counter instead of dropping them into the machine. When I got home, I‚Äôd spread them out on my coffee table and look at them with a magnifying glass.

They were all wrong. Every single one. Foreign dates. Misspelled inscriptions. A few had no presidents at all‚Äîjust smooth, blank surfaces like they‚Äôd been erased. One had a screaming face on it. Not a design. An actual expression. Mouth open, eyes wide. I swear the face changed every time I blinked.

I stopped sleeping. I stopped eating. My routine was gone.

And still, every night at 3:17, the blue LeBaron came.


---

One night, I decided I‚Äôd follow him. I parked my car near the booth before my shift and brought my binoculars, a flashlight, and a portable tape recorder. My plan was simple: as soon as the LeBaron passed through, I‚Äôd close the booth, jump in my car, and follow him. See where he went. Where he came from.

3:17 arrived.

The LeBaron glided in.

The hand emerged.

$1.25 in quarters.

As soon as the arm lifted, I bolted. Got in my car. Headlights off. I followed him, keeping just enough distance. The road ahead was dark, empty. Only his tail lights to guide me.

But something was wrong.

No matter how fast I went, I couldn‚Äôt catch up. He stayed the same distance ahead. It was like the road was stretching. Like the miles between us weren‚Äôt real.

I looked at the mile markers.

All of them said the same thing: MILE 66.

I passed it again. And again. And again.

Mile 66.

Mile 66.

Mile 66.

I stopped the car. Got out. Walked back to one of the signs. Touched it.

The paint was wet.

I got back in and turned around, but the highway behind me was gone. Just blackness. Not night. Not shadows. Just absence.

The LeBaron stopped ahead. Dead center of the road.

Its brake lights blinked twice.

I don‚Äôt know what made me do it, but I approached. Step by step, like I was being drawn forward by something I couldn‚Äôt see. My flashlight flickered.

I got close enough to see inside.

The driver was gone.

The front seat was empty.

But the back seat? Oh god. The back seat‚Äî

It was filled with toll booth tickets. Thousands of them. All timestamped. All 3:17 a.m. Some dated years ahead. Others centuries past. One read ‚ÄúMarch 13, 2086.‚Äù Another said ‚ÄúApril 9, 1842.‚Äù

Then I saw mine.

‚ÄúApril 9, 3:17 a.m. ‚Äì PAID ‚Äì Booth #7 ‚Äì J. Redford‚Äù

That‚Äôs my name. My shift.

The ticket was covered in blood.

I turned to run. But the road was gone. The world was gone. There was only the booth.

Booth #7.

And me inside it.


---

I don‚Äôt remember getting back. Maybe I never left.

Maybe I never moved.

I‚Äôve been here ever since. I think.

Time doesn‚Äôt work right anymore. The sky is always dark. The lights flicker in patterns that feel like messages. The radio in the booth plays static that sometimes whispers my name. I tried quitting. I tried leaving.

Every time I step outside, I end up back inside the booth.

Sometimes there are other drivers now. Ones with no faces. Ones who scream when they hand me their change. Ones who beg me not to let them through. I lift the arm anyway. I don‚Äôt know what else to do.

But the LeBaron still comes. Every night. 3:17.

Now, I pay him.

I don‚Äôt know how I have the change, but I always do. I drop it into the gloved hand. And the gate opens. I open the gate.

I‚Äôm part of it now.

Maybe I always was.


---

If you‚Äôre reading this‚Äîif you found this printout under the floorboard or stuffed in the drawer‚ÄîI‚Äôm begging you: don‚Äôt take the night shift at Booth #7.

Not for the pay.

Not for the silence.

Not for the solitude.

There‚Äôs something wrong with the road.

And it‚Äôs still collecting tolls.

Have been dealing with on and off PACs for the last 5 months or so, on and off but am in a pretty bad streak right now. 42M, don‚Äôt smoke, a little overweight, exercise pretty regularly and probably drink too much alcohol. Alcohol consumption is pretty much non existent during the week but can be a little excessive on weekends (12-14 drinks over the course of the weekend). 

The PACs seem to happen almost like clockwork later morning, I do drink coffee in the morning but have for 20+ years. Then once I seem to lay down at night my body seems to start going crazy with PACs. I had a holter monitor study and the burden wasn‚Äôt overly concerning. When they happen, they last for maybe a few seconds but I almost get like an intense fear or panic that follows them which makes my body feel a bit tingly. Most seem to happen late morning or late night 11pm-12.

I spoke with u/merikus who passed along word to NDG (RIP Reddit account) that I was taking this side contest over. I waited to announce this until now to mimic last year, where the contest wasn't in play during the games so everything that happened happened organically.

Prize is a $25 gift card to the winner's choice of Sponsor (but seriously I recommend Stirling, my choice last year. Get some coffee.) Also, you gain the right to use the ""Friend of the Sub"" Flair (but I'm not a mod so you'll have to customize it yourself or ask u/bourboninexile on your own.) While I pass on the title maybe I'll change back to ""Friend of the Sub (2024).""

For this prize **you** the sub choose the winner. It should be based upon their contributions to LG2025 *outside of the SOTD posts.* That's right, don't think about the LG SOTD posts, we have a contest for that. Think about the people who had good community interaction. Maybe they keep threads fun, maybe they gave you smushes or helped you with rules.

Any sub member is eligible to win. Judges (yep), LG participants (of course), onlookers who made comments (yep.)

Any sub participant is eligible to vote. I have created a google form. It asks for your u/ name and your choice's u/ name. This prevents sock puppet voting (If I don't recognize you I'll look at your post history to determine how long you've been around.) 

Voting is open now. I'll keep it open until July 1 or 2 (depending on when I remember to close it) and tally everything up. f it's a runaway victory that person wins. If it's close, I will employ a tiebreaker consisting of fuzzy math about which posts I liked. To that end, please use the 3rd box to call out anything I may have missed or that happened behind the scenes. 

To avoid this looking like a ~~small~~ lazy bribe to the judges I will wait until scoring has been announced as completed to post the winner.

On paper, this shouldn't be a problem financially, but I can't get over the overwhelming guilt of having a monthly budget solely for something pretty that's going to end up in the compost anyway. 

I used to have a huge thing against ""unnecessary"" spending, to the point where I'd hate myself for weeks over a $3 coffee purchase and skip meals if I forgot to pack a lunch that day. I've made large strides with my therapist, but only on purchases I deem have a concrete purpose - for instance, coffee will keep me awake at work, or the lunch will provide the fuel I need to get through the day. But I still have a lot of trouble with ""frivolous"" buys, like the flowers. 

Honestly, I feel stupid when I look at it from a financial standpoint, as I can very much afford the flowers. But it just feels so wrong? I feel like an idiot, even though I love looking at the flowers and caring for them to extend their lives as long as possible. I was looking forward to the purchase for the past few days, but the moment I actually pull the trigger, I felt immense, overwhelming guilt. 

Any advice is appreciated! Thanks in advance :)

That second chapter of our relationship became something neither of us had experienced before. We became true partners. He met my parents, picked up some of my habits to be healthier, constantly reassured me, and genuinely worked to understand me. He believed in me more than anyone outside my mom, and the love evolved beyond the honeymoon stage into something I chose daily. But cracks remained. Four times, I had to care for him after he drank too much, and I knew he did it to numb his darker thoughts. His friends were reckless influences, and even though he didn‚Äôt act like them, I worried about the long-term impact. He had big dreams but rarely took action‚Äîhe didn‚Äôt have a resume, a LinkedIn, and I always doubted whether he actually had a job back in his country. His words rarely matched his actions, and I couldn‚Äôt see that inconsistency in a lifelong partner.

The most heartbreaking aspect, though, was his family. They were deeply toxic, yet he remained unconditionally loyal to them‚Äîemotionally, financially, constantly‚Äîeven from across the world. Week after week, I watched them drain him. He said openly that no matter how much they hurt him, he would never stop being there for them. I couldn‚Äôt support that kind of loyalty. I‚Äôm loyal to people who love me in healthy ways, and while I tried to be there for him, I couldn‚Äôt protect him from the pain they caused or repair the damage to his self-worth. I truly believe their influence crushed his drive, and no matter how confident he seemed, that deep insecurity never left him. And the truth is, they were never going to change.

Then came the end. Just days after our 1.8-year anniversary, we had a loving, vulnerable conversation over coffee about our fears, and hours later, he ended it. He said the heartbreak at the end of college wasn‚Äôt worth it. That pain hit me harder than anything I‚Äôd known, even worse than past family betrayals. For months, I woke up with crushing pressure in my chest, cried uncontrollably, and felt physically sick with grief. Two months after the breakup, we spoke again‚Äîhe admitted his parents had pulled him out of school, were divorcing, and he was moving back to be with them. We had a few more emotional conversations. The last time I saw him, he left me at the airport before I went home for the holidays. That day was the saddest, most hollow I‚Äôve ever felt in my life.

Now it‚Äôs been nine months since we broke up, and two months since we last spoke. When we did, he told me he had a job, was sober, studying again, very religious, and had firmer boundaries with his mom. I want to believe him‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt know if I can. It‚Äôs all just words, and I‚Äôve been misled before. A part of me still wonders: what if we *could* grow together, what if his love is real and lasting and redeemable? He always said he‚Äôd move anywhere for me, that I was his best friend, the one he wanted to marry. And yet, I can‚Äôt shake the truth‚Äîhis family will always be a part of him, and I don‚Äôt want that in my life or in the lives of my future children. I don‚Äôt know if I should reach out again. I‚Äôm terrified of losing the love of my life‚Ä¶ but also unsure if he ever truly was. I‚Äôve never been one to romanticize men‚ÄîI‚Äôm a grounded, driven woman with goals I work hard to achieve.

5 months later he contacted me again to be frineds"" netheless to say it didnt work, not only bc he wasnt ready to just be friedn who call, but also because we talked about he still hopped we could meet again at some point in life and that he would move to any country i wanted to settle in since he job woudl most like be online flexible. but the main reason i gave as to why we woudl never ever even shoudl get back together was also bc of his family and their hold on himand how evethoguh i COULD SEE HIMA S MY LIFE PARTNER I DIDnt want his family inmy relationship, my life and future children. he said that he could and would at some point detach form his family but i trully belive that he is so bonded at the core to his family he woudl never be capable of ever actually doing it.

It has now been 9 month since we broke up,7 months since we last saw each other and 2 months since we last talked where he said he couldnt handle being just friends and accepting we would never see each other again. But during the time we talked until two months s ago, he became properly religious, is studying to get a diploma in cs and finance, has a job, has set mroe firm boundaries with his mom and is fully sober and doesnt sleep aorund; all of which I sincerlly dotn know if i belive or not, since there is now ay to prove anything but it seam like is it true but i have the feeling of ill never tully know. This always makes me thinks about the way he loves me so genuinly and deeply. Can you please pleas rgive me advise on what to do. 

Should i contact him adn say we dont have to NOT EVER see each other again? should i say that we coudl try again in a couple years after we're both settled down? should i never tlak to him again and just be okay with him being the one that got away?",0,1750864715.0,Advice,1,0.5,False

1lk8eiz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lk8eiz,Older [Baratza Encore] still not fine enough after calibration,"I offered to take a look at a friend's Baratza Encore that they want to use for espresso, and it doesn't grind finely enough even at the finest setting.

[I did the procedure from this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ppWc9RsPAk), inserting the screw in the very finest position possible, even using the second hole she says not to use because it'll be too fine. I made sure while running it didn't sound like the burrs were touching when set to the finest range.

Even after that, the grind is as shown in the photos with the dial cranked fully clockwise. I read that this is a ""high retention"" grinder, so I ran three 18g doeses to make sure to get to the currently ground coffee, and all were the same. Coffee in the test shots is Booskerdoo Eastern Standard, roasted 6/11, which they describe as a medium roast.

So I have to wonder what I'm doing wrong here. It doesn't seem like there's any way to put the top burr plate back incorrectly, but it also seems like it should be grinding more finely so it does point to user error.

It seems like there's only one way to put the burr back in, so the little white tab on the right sits on the ramp for the black collar with the screw thread inside it. So when you turn the black collar clockwise it grabs the tab and pulls it down as you rotate it.

I have been doing that since January. C because it helps iron absorption, and B1 because I heard it helps magnesium absorption, but I'm not sure that's true?

The B1 seemed to improve that.

Among many other positive changes, I've also gone from peeing once every half hour or so (high volume, almost clear every time) to once every few hours. I'm drinking way less water and feeling way less thirsty (I used to be pretty much constantly thirsty ).

I noticed magnesium makes me thirsty, and that one makes sense because it draws water into the bowels. And because of that, I didn't think the B1 was doing all that much? So when I ran out after the first bottle, I decided not to get more. Within a week, I had to pee every hour or so again. I got more B1, and again I'm back to once every few hours unless I have coffee.

I‚Äôve been dealing with gut issues since I was a kid‚Äîmainly morning cramps and urgent BMs, usually soft or diarrhea, especially after breakfast. Coffee and stress could sometimes trigger it, but it wasn‚Äôt super frequent back then.

Now it‚Äôs happening every day. I wake up, eat breakfast, and immediately need to rush to the bathroom. I usually go 3‚Äì4 times, starting soft/yellow and getting progressively looser, with pretty bad cramps that last for a couple of hours. After that, I‚Äôm usually fine for the rest of the day.

I‚Äôve done a lot of tests‚Äînormal pancreas (elastase), normal bloodwork, no celiac, no lactose intolerance. Stool tests showed fat and some undigested food. But my doctor barely went through it and just said ‚Äúit‚Äôs IBS from stress‚Äù and prescribed amitriptyline. I explained that this happens even when I‚Äôm not stressed, like on vacations or completely calm days, but he just kept pushing the ‚Äúit‚Äôs unconscious stress‚Äù explanation and didn‚Äôt really dig deeper.

I left feeling pretty dismissed. I get that IBS is often a diagnosis of exclusion, but it‚Äôs frustrating when it feels like they stop investigating and just label it as stress when they don't know what else to say.

Has anyone else had this experience? How did you find a doctor who actually listened or took your symptoms seriously? Would love to hear if anyone found something helpful that wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúmanage your stress.‚Äù

By the way, I'm taking imodium and it helps a bit. Metamucil makes my symptoms worse, i think it makes me poop more.

Thanks so much!

Essentially it just pays the bills and stock cost, we have a couple of part time staff, and between the bills and wages for staff we break even, without taking a salary.

I had a financial cushion, and knew it might take a while to build a successful business and pay myself a salary but now getting to squeaky bum time, and I need to get a full time employed job asap.

Myself and business partner have decided selling is the preferred option, and we‚Äôve had quotes based on turnover, and it‚Äôs valued at 30/35k but trying to keep it running while we look for a buyer/list the business for sale is going to cause an issue 

My business partner right now is unable to work due to genuine health reasons and will be out of action a couple of months. I really need to find a job (any job) but can‚Äôt see how I can make it all work

The staff can cover a bit, but if we open reduced hours (to fit the hours they work, we‚Äôll likely be unable to meet the costs). And if I extend their hours etc I‚Äôd struggle to pay the wages.

If I temporarily cease trading, I won‚Äôt be able to pay the existing commitments to rent and utilities etc

And I‚Äôm not sure how that would affect sale value if we list it somewhere

I recently started a 9-5 after graduating uni and it is the most soul sucking thing ive ever experienced. 

This is how my day usually goes:

Wake up, drink a coffee/make preworkout so strong it sends my head spinning - leave for work. 

Eat a subway from the shop under my office around 12:30pm

Leave work at 5, come home at 6.

Shower if I can be bothered but usually not. I head straight to bed and just scroll or watch some yt on my phone until I fall asleep or can't bear the hunger anymore. 

It's usually around 7:30 or so when I have the motivation to uber eats something. I stay in bed and scroll/yt until the food comes in, at which point I reluctantly leave bed and go pick it up.

I force myself to eat at my desk no matter how shit I feel so I guess that's some level of control I have in my life (I don't like sleeping on crumbs/food in my bed)

At this point it's usually around 9, where I'll force myself to stand in the shower for a bit. 

3/4 days I go right back to bed and scroll but once in a while I motivate myself to go to my desk and play a game of League of Legends simply so I don't decay in rank (you lose points if you don't play for a while to put it simply).

As soon as I get this over with, I go right back to bed and scroll till 11:30/12:00 or so until I collapse from the tiredness just to repeat it all.

I used to love things like playing league and going to the gym with friends and playing the guitar/trying to write shitty songs. 

My girlfriend wanted a ""break"" since I refused to spend time with her and I was saying I was  ""always tired"" apparently. I don't know what the fuck a break even means. I havent talked to her for weeks and it's concerning how little I seem to care at this point.

I had quit vaping for 2+ years but I relapsed into it which I am ashamed of but now quitting seems impossible again.

I have a car that I dreamed of since I was 13 in the garage (financed) and I drive it nowhere but work and don't even care about it anymore. It's just another monthly payment to make.

It's not even that the job is hard or bad. It's literally the perfect starting point for someone with my degree, I do well enough at it, my boss is reasonably nice and it pays really well for my age (20).

My weekends feel like they pass me by in a blur. I need Saturday to recover from the week and Sunday to maintain my life (wash clothes, grocery shop). Not to mention by 5pm on Sunday I feel as though an anvil has been strapped to my chest.

Things I liked doing now feel like a chore. Ive talked to my parents and some or my friends that have been working full time and they just tell me '""lmao welcome to the real world"" and this is basically just everyone's life once they work a 9-5. 

Is this really true? Is this what my life will look like for the next 65 years? 

I don't know if I can deal with it if that's the case.

EDIT: I have had a blood test about 2 months ago (well after I started my job and well after this whole part of my life started) and was fine in all aspects except a slight deficiency in Vitamin D, for which I take capsules. Thanks to those who were concerned about my health.

I wake up around 6:30 and the first thing I do is weigh out 2.5g of green strain - usually Green Maeng Da or Green Borneo depending on what I've got. I use a cheap digital scale because eyeballing doses is a recipe for inconsistent results.

Mix it with about 4oz of orange juice in a small glass. OJ masks the taste pretty well and the acidity supposedly helps with absorption. I stir it up real good, chug it down, then chase with more OJ to get rid of any leftover powder taste.

Here's the key part - I take it on a completely empty stomach. Haven't eaten anything since dinner the night before. This makes a huge difference in how fast it kicks in and how strong the effects are. If I eat first, it either doesn't work or takes forever.

Then I wait about 45 minutes before having breakfast. Usually spend that time checking emails, scrolling reddit, or doing some light stretching. The kratom starts working right around the 30-45 minute mark for me.

Once it kicks in, I have my coffee and breakfast. The combination of kratom + caffeine gives me clean energy without the jitters I used to get from just coffee alone. Perfect for getting work done.

I stick to this same routine every weekday. Weekends I'm more flexible and sometimes skip it entirely to keep my tolerance in check.

I think about you every day and cry everytime. Nobody cared when you disappeared, but i to this day carry the same weight from the day i realised i lost you. You basically never even jumped over the fence of our home territory, so when i couldn't find you after a 2 minute walk i knew something was wrong. 

You were the only reason i wanted to come back home. You were my shadow, you always sat beside me in the kitchen. Whenever my mother yelled, insulted me and abused me, you were my only source of comfort.

I remember when you were brought right to my door by a stray cat i fed, and you just looked like small ball with big eyes. I called you speck of dust.  And just as suddenly you appeared in my life, you left.

I hate myself for not letting you sleep on my thighs the last days, just because i didn't like being covered in fur. Now when i sometimes find your old black clumps of fur around this damned, cold house, i try not to choke on my own tears.

I hate myself for not buying you in time the expensive snacks you deserved. When you disappeared, every night before falling asleep i wondered: ""are you full?"", ""are you warm on this winter day?"" ""will you come back soon?"".

And then i dreamed about you in an empty field, dead and full of maggots. ""It's just a dream, It can't be"", i told myself. But now i really doubt you're still alive, because i know that you'd never disappear for no reason.

I accepted that i'll never feel your long, black fur again. That i wont see you beside me while i'm drinking coffee, that my soulless clothes will never be decorated again, that i'm officially not blessed by your warmth anymore. Tomorrow's my 18th birthday, and my biggest wish is to find your body and give it a proper burial, or even better, see you running towards me again.

I'm sure you never actually left me, that in body or in soul you always have been keeping me company, but it's still cruelly bittersweet. I hope you know that i'll always love you and no other cat can ever replace you, even if looks just like you.

But he still didn‚Äôt know if there was a modern connection. To get some facts, he read the report taken by the State Police, which included her place of employment, so he decided to check out this mysterious woman himself.

It definitely put him in the mood for a drink. A few customers stood in front of him while three employees busily worked behind the counter. They were too preoccupied to pay him any particular attention, so he did his usual casing of the place. He kept the customers in his periphery, including those trickling in, while noting all the doorways and any potential dangers before returning his observation to the staff.

¬†¬†¬†His attention immediately focused on the attractive woman who seemed deep in thought. She had a thin figure, almost waifish. Her movements were somewhat odd as if a little clumsy from nervousness or pre-occupied by other matters. Maybe a little self-conscious. He made a mental list of her attributes. Dark hair contrasted very pale skin, as if hidden away from the world, but it was those eyes that arrested him. Penetrating, forceful like a laser, her glare sliced through him. But he didn‚Äôt look away, so she didn‚Äôt either. It was as if she challenged him back, as if she meant her unfriendly glare as a warning to his apparent curiosity. Perhaps, she was silently telling this stranger not to dare hit on her like too many men tried to, but they both were magnetically drawn to the other despite resistance on both parts. Almost intimate, they shared a silent moment, wrapped in mistrust and a strange tinge of desperation.¬†

¬†¬†Who was this strange creature named Ninon? She had a hidden strength behind a misleading fragility and brooding mood. What terror has she seen? Her wide, barely blinking eyes spoke about a trauma that her heart-shaped lips wouldn‚Äôt. Maybe he was reading too much into it.

¬†¬†¬†When it was his turn to order, a young guy with acne scars asked to take his order. He paid for a cappuccino and then placed his card back in his wallet, sensing her attention on him, but he didn‚Äôt overtly return it. As a tall dirty blond with chiseled features, he was used to women staring at him. In this particular situation, he wondered if it wasn‚Äôt attraction, but a sense of danger that she found emitting from him. He had a forceful disposition that came with Law Enforcement, and he didn‚Äôt want to intimidate her any more than he had to, so he headed to the end of the counter to wait for his order and glanced out the large windows at the row of stores across the street. There was a Mexican restaurant, a pharmacy, and a busy dollar store. While wasting time, he fought the urge to look back at her. When his order was ready, he didn‚Äôt answer right away. He eventually took one of the cups awaiting their owner and dared to turn in her direction. Staring at him like a wounded animal at a hunter, she parted her lips as if to say something, but then shut them. He simply gave her a disinterested nod as if to a service worker and headed out.¬†

Back at headquarters, Ballard checked back in with Scott, who was getting ready to leave for the night. The man in casual clothes had made strong coffee for them, so they took a few minutes to chat. They had worked on several cases together and usually saw eye to eye on things. The broader man was slightly older, but still had a notable Active Duty sense about him. Both of them had very controlled and concise movements. They pulled out their notes and got down to business.¬†

¬†¬†¬†Scott told him about Tobe Terrell‚Äôs book and quoted, ‚Äú‚ÄòThis book is about some who lived their lives as unorthodox experiments in an effort to reject the values of their culture and create new ones.‚Äô‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúI did some reading too,‚Äù the shorter man told Scott, ‚ÄúGet this. MPD Sgt. John Stitcher reported that the CIA ran The Finders as a front group gone bad. As you know, Ramon Martinez investigated the original case in 1987, recounting that the CIA interfered with the investigation. In 1993, the DOJ put an inquiry into the group, but Stitcher died right around that time and the allegations were never verified.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†Scott sipped the steamy liquid while digesting Robert‚Äôs words along with it. They didn‚Äôt go down well. He leaned against his desk, mulling over ideas. Finally, he spoke, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it was a front group. Here‚Äôs one source about that. I came across Wendell Minnick, author of *Spies and Provocateurs: An Encyclopedia of Espionage and Covert Action*, who spent two years researching The Finders. After running up loads of debt looking into them, he said that they ‚Äòwould love you to think they‚Äôre a CIA front, but I would say they‚Äôre really nothing.‚Äô I found this next part interesting too.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†He showed Robert his notes, where he wrote, ‚ÄúMinnick added, ‚ÄòYou‚Äôre going to hear a lot of bullshit on the Finders, because they lie. These are dysfunctional adults, but they‚Äôre all working their asses off. They‚Äôre constantly working on some project. If you have a cult, the best way to control people is to keep them busy, to keep their minds occupied‚Äîif you have people standing around doing nothing, then they start thinking.‚Äô‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúYou know what they say when someone protests too much,‚Äù Ballard told him with a nod.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúYeah, I read *Hamlet* too. What else do you have?‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúHold on,‚Äù Ballard grumbled, flipping through papers until he found one of his notes. He cleared his throat and added, ‚ÄúThis is one source that rubbed me the wrong way. An author named Mark Riebling wrote a 1994 book, *Wedge: The Secret War Between the FBI and CIA.‚Äù*

¬†¬†¬†Scott frowned. He didn‚Äôt buy into all of that and made a hand gesture as if to brush it away.

¬†¬†¬†Undeterred, Ballard continued, ‚Äú‚ÄòJust before Christmas 1993, both agencies were embarrassed by a Justice Department investigation into whether the CIA had improperly used the FBI to cover up its connections to a computer-training cult called Finders, which had been accused but acquitted of child abuse.‚Äô‚Äù

¬†¬†‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôm afraid of. More stories like that. If we drop the ball with this woman, we‚Äôll get blamed for this in the Press. It isn‚Äôt looking good, especially if anyone tries to shut this investigation down as well or twists the truth.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI hear ya,‚Äù Robert said, scratching his head. ‚ÄúDamned if you do, damned if you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúJust get me what you can and I‚Äôll run this up the chain.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúIf Ninon is all we have right now, we need to break her,‚Äù Ballard said matter of factly, ‚ÄúShe knows something.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†They both had a Military background, though Ballard had experience interrogating terrorists and not kidnapping victims.¬†

‚ÄúIf she is a victim, my fear is that she is already broken. I don‚Äôt know if she will be of any use to the investigation.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll let Jan work on her for a while, but I‚Äôm afraid that if we don‚Äôt jump on this while we have an opportunity that it will all go back under the rug.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking the same thing. Time might be running out.‚Äù

6/18 - went to planned parenthood made an appointment online for a ma. My appointment was at 9am and I didn‚Äôt get out of there till 2pm. While I was there they did an ultrasound, blood work, made me watch videos about how the process would go , and I took the first pill. 

They said I could wait 24 hours and take the other four pills or insert them vaginally soon as I got home or anytime after. I chose this option since I could do them right away. 

At 5pm - I took ibuprofen and nausea medicine that they gave to me. They said the nausea medication would make me tired and it did. At 5:30 pm I inserted the four pills. Around 6pm I started cramping nothing to crazy but uncomfortable and I started to bleed heavy. I also experienced an uncomfortable feeling in my vaginal area. I then went to bedish as I kept waking up with discomfort but still nothing more than period cramps. 

8pm ish - got up and used the bathroom. Two huge clots came out but they didn‚Äôt hurt. Went back to bed. 

11pm - did the same thing. 

6/19 - was off work so stayed in bed. Still cramping and bleeding but still wasn‚Äôt horrible got up and cleaned the house. My appetite for coffee was also back. More clots and tissue was still coming out but didn‚Äôt hurt. 

6/20 - same thing still bleeding and cramping but was even less then the day before. I went to work this day and was fine. I also never experienced nausea or took any of the pain medication after that first time. 

Same thing for the next few days but was getting less and less‚Ä¶

6/23 - bleeding lightly went and got my blood work done at a labcorps

6/24 - got the phone call that the procedure worked and just asked me to schedule a follow up vist. And that was it! (still bleeding lightly)

- the safety of having the caretakers watching on you

- the resonating water with the full moon artwork above it
- incredible ambient music and atmosphere at mimo and cochilo
- fave dances at floresta
- lovely time at apuro, todo bem and the library
- food (even though i heard lots of people complaining)
- i think the eco pirates did a great job considering the amount of people and to me, it felt like people were quite conscious of their trash (even thought i read lots of complaints from previous wakers but i cannot compare with previous editions)
- forgot about my phone and saw very few phones around
- washing hands while smiling at strangers
- the lit musical metal tube artwork in the middle of the forest (who is the artist?)
- the nest chill area
- the scale and beauty of the moooooon rising!
- the fireflies
- the effort of the waking life team in rebuilding an ecosystem in a dead land
- the poetic booklet
- i perceive every sound like music now
- really enjoyed not seeing drunk people‚Ä¶
- i felt connected to the whole‚Ä¶

Off/ could use some improvement:
- ‚Ä¶ but maybe a bit too much drugs going on? Am I naive? Wouldn‚Äôt it be cool to have a sober stage?
- ‚Ä¶ but didn‚Äôt really bond as i thought with individuals (because of the many big groups closed in their bubble?)
- space between tents and the girl who decided to close our tent entrance with her tent
- not super impressed by the techno sets in my party hours (but maybe my fault, i was mostly sleeping from 4 am to 10 am, but how cool is to have proper techno in the daytime?)
- queue and cost of ice coffee
- way too bright lights at outro lado
- i didn‚Äôt really get the music and energy at praia
- vibes at suna. what about a sex positive stage?
- didn‚Äôt find the lake so inviting as i imagined

Last thoughts
From what I heard and felt, it seems like the festival has lost something, it was maybe just one year too late to live its full splendor. Perhaps it‚Äôs just too many people and very different energies?! At the beginning, I thought it was nice to have many stages with different music existing in the same festival but maybe this also provokes some kind of separation in the vibe of people?

I‚Äôm happy I participated, I‚Äôm still processing and I made these two lists as I feel a bit split between very good things and things that left me a bit mehhh.

I discovered I had fatty liver disease (likely early NASH) in early May of 2025.

At that time:  
ALT - 142  
AST - 80  
Ferritin - 455  
Triglycerides - 292  
Ultrasound - Diffuse hepatic steatosis with hepatomegaly. Smooth contours (meaning no evidence of fibrosis)

My BMI was 26.2 at that time.

I immediately changed my diet from complete crap to a very strict Mediterranean diet. I cut out ALL sugar, just about all sodium, and most saturated fats. I even only drink black coffee now. I also started walking 5k-10k steps per day.

Finally got in for a Fibroscan in early June and was S2, F0.

Then I lost about 20 pounds in 6 weeks. BMI is now 23.1. I just got my bloodwork back and they read as follows:  
ALT - 68  
AST - 32  
Ferritin - 198  
Triglycerides - 92  
I did have a bit of an uptick in my LDL (normal last month, now slightly elevated at 111, but this can happen with the drastic weight loss).

I'm repeating my Fibroscan next month.

Nobody cared when you disappeared, but i to this day carry the same weight from the day i realised i lost you. You basically never even jumped over the fence of our home territory, so when i couldn't find you after a 2 minute walk i knew something was wrong. 

You were the only reason i wanted to come back home. You were my shadow, you always sat beside me in the kitchen. Whenever my mother yelled, insulted me and abused me, you were my only source of comfort.

I remember when you were brought right to my door by a stray cat i fed, and you just looked like small ball with big eyes. I called you speck of dust.  And just as suddenly you appeared in my life, you left.

I hate myself for not letting you sleep on my thighs the last days, just because i didn't like being covered in fur. Now when i sometimes find your old black clumps of fur around this damned, cold house, i try not to choke on my own tears.

I hate myself for not buying you in time the expensive snacks you deserved. When you disappeared, every night before falling asleep i wondered: ""are you full?"", ""are you warm on this winter day?"" ""will you come back soon?"".

And then i dreamed about you in an empty field, dead and full of maggots. ""It's just a dream, It can't be"", i told myself. But now i really doubt you're still alive, because i know that you'd never disappear for no reason.

I accepted that i'll never feel your long, black fur again. That i wont see you beside me while i'm drinking coffee, that my soulless clothes will never be decorated again, that i'm officially not blessed by your warmth anymore. Tomorrow's my 18th birthday, and my biggest wish is to find your body and give it a proper burial, or even better, see you running towards me again.

I'm sure you never actually left me, that in body or in soul you always have been keeping me company, but it's still cruelly bittersweet. I hope you know that i'll always love you and no other cat can ever replace you, even if looks just like you.

1lk7wd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/europeanunion/comments/1lk7wd1/the_eus_new_deforestation_risk_list_is_a_fucking/,The EU‚Äôs new deforestation risk list is a fucking joke.,"Hey guys,

For those of you that aren't aware, in 2023 the EU adopted the European Union Deforestation Regulation, a highly ambitious piece of European legislation to be the instrument to combat global deforestation.

In short, it holds operators and traders in the Union accountable to do their due dilligence on deforestation-free sourcing of commodities and products, and forbids any placement into or export out of the EU market of these items without them being deforestation-free, legally produced and accompanied by a valid due diligence statement.

This means that, if a company in the EU wants to use commodities like cattle, cocoa, coffee, wood, ..., they must ensure the suppliers aren't involved in deforestation.

In order to keep everything somewhat manageable for companies, though, the EUDR implements a benchmarking system of low, standard and high-risk countries. Basically, a low-risk country doesn't really require any due-dilligence. The only thing a company needs to do when dealing with a low-risk country is keep an eye out for any massive and obvious violations of the law.

Now, the EU was going to publish a list of these low and high-risk countries, but this took ages, because of lobbying, until the end of may this year (which was fine, because every country was considered to be standard risk in the absence of the list)

Turns out, we live in a different time than two years ago, and even the most ill-informed person would consider this list to be political, rather than based on reality. I mean, look at this:

> **Low risk countries**
> Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Australia, Austria, 
> Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belgium, Bhutan, Bosnia and 
> Herzegovina, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, Burundi, Cabo Verde, Canada, Central African
> Republic, Chile, China, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czechia, 
> Denmark, Djibouti, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Estonia, Eswatini, Fiji, Finland, 
> France, Gabon, Georgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, Guyana, Hungary, Iceland, 
> India, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, 
> Kenya, Kiribati, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Latvia, Lebanon, 
> Lesotho, Libya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Madagascar, Maldives, Mali, Malta, 
> Marshall Islands, Mauritius, Micronesia (Federated States of), Monaco, Mongolia, 
> Montenegro, Morocco, Nauru, Nepal, Netherlands (Kingdom of the), New Zealand, North 
> Macedonia, Norway, Oman, Palau, Palestine, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Poland, 
> Portugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and 
> Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Sao Tome and 
> Principe, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Seychelles, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Island, 
> South Africa, South Sudan, Spain, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Sweden, Switzerland, Syrian Arab 
> Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, 
> T√ºrkiye, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great 
> Britain and Northern Ireland, United States of America, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, 
> Vietnam, Yemen.
> 
> **High risk countries**
> Belarus, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Myanmar, Russian Federation.


Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia and the DRC are among the top drivers of commodity-driven deforestation, yet none are marked as 'high risk'.

The only 'high risk' countries are a bunch of politically isolated countries.

What was supposed to be a turning point in the battle against deforesttion is now a worthless piece of legislation that further erodes the credibility of the EU.



I am so fucking dissapointed by this bullshit, and I hope some of you are too.

This work was inspired after years of working in restaurants and wondering if strangers ever contemplate the lives of those who wait on them. If he or she chose to reach into that person's life, what would they find? Just another human being trying to make it in the world.

I sought to create a modern tale of forbidden desire set in a culture that loves talk shows and coffee. It is a quest to find what is sacred in a society that hungrily consumes and tosses away people like trash. And the main character sets out on a destructive course where she must realize if anything is real and/or what should remain a fantasy. It is written as if her diary.

Chapter One

I was told my favorite waitress was gone. Why should I care? She was just a cute, blonde service worker‚Äìa dime a dozen‚Äìthough I must admit, I enjoyed checking out those long legs gently hugged by black shorts. And I got amused by the way she tilted her sweet face my way before bending over to sweep away crumbs from the floor near my table. That was the reason I gulped down one cup of foul-tasting coffee after another. I couldn't look away, and she knew it. She blushed whenever she caught me eyeing the tight material gripping her form, but her smile told me that she forgave me. Now it's only her memory playing with me. They say she's gone. That shouldn't affect me. Should it?

¬†¬†¬†The Gourmet-to-Go is a friendly place in a forgettable part of Norfolk. Minus the coffee, it could easily be listed in the top ten for good food. That's why a lot of business folks stop in for lunch. They get hooked on either the Santa Fe Chicken or the Southern hospitality, which some say could mend the broken egos in this tough, but vibrant city. I don't know much about that. I drop by because my delivery route takes me through this dull neighborhood of trailer parks and aging stores. A renewal effort is underway, especially with the opening of new shops like the Gourmet-to-Go. I'm not sure what it is, but there's something charming about that pumpkin-colored bistro. I can't get it out of my mind. Plus, there's something about that waitress.

¬†¬†¬†I tried not to think about her. I just sipped my coffee and glanced at the staff scurrying behind the counter. She wasn't there. I heard she's taking some time off. I don't know if she's coming back.

¬†¬†It's empty without her; I don't know why. The other employees are pretty entertaining, especially Stephanie and Nadine. Nadine was chatting with the regulars by the cash register. Loud and full of life, this ex-New Yorker puts on a show during lunch. The customers get a kick out of watching her handle the crowd with boisterous efficiency. When things calm down, she plays a trivia game with them. They all chime in, trying to guess plots in her soap operas or scenes from TV sitcoms. Laughter erupts over the sounds of clinking dishes and hissing steam, and everyone gets lost in the aroma of fresh baking bread. Warm and heavy, it lulls bloated bellies into a temporary nirvana until cheerleader Nadine beckons for a new game. But tired patrons have to head back to their law firm or the newsroom. Everyone is disappointed.

¬†¬†¬†Then another face enters the scene. Wild Stephanie, returning from a long break, calls out a sultry, ""Bye, baby,"" as they leave. All the men secretly hope it was directed at them. No one really knows what she does at the Gourmet-to-Go. She had perfected the art of appearing busy. Sometimes she waited tables. Other times she fussed with her untamed hair or greeted customers with excessive zeal. No one complained.

¬†¬†¬†Way in the back, Milo limped slightly as he fetched forty pounds of raw chicken for the chef. Chef Celia never paid much attention to the staff except to occasionally shake her head. Her cooking is her craft, each delicacy a piece of self-esteem. Warmth radiates from her round and sunny face. She enjoys this place more than she allows us to believe.

¬†¬†¬†There are a few others. They all make me feel welcome. So what was it about that waitress? What made her different? I know little about her. Her name is Dreama Avalon. Her features are delicate and softly framed by honey-blonde hair. Large, cautious eyes peer with a sense of mystery. She pours out her heart like the statue of a neglected angel standing in the center of a fountain. She wants to reach out, but she can't. She stays there as if waiting for someone. I can't let it be me. When I sit near her, I'm flooded by her emotion and it's too deep. She is unknowable. Maybe I'm afraid to know.

¬†¬†¬†I fear something about her as if one kiss would destroy the sane routine that makes me who I think I am. Part of me wants to give in, to stay in her world forever and to discover a new version of ""me."" The other part knows I can't.

¬†¬†¬†Suddenly I glanced up and found tomboy Nadine stepping towards me. Her smile was knowing, her stare found me guilty of some yet unrevealed crime. Something in her tough New York ways understood and she gently patted my shoulder.

¬†¬†¬†""I have something for you,"" she said in her noticeable accent. Like most of Norfolk's residents, she was brought south due to military life, normally a lonely and broken existence. I know a little about that. Most of us here do.

¬†¬†¬†She refilled my coffee with one hand and snuck something out of her apron pocket with the other. It was just a dull-looking notebook. And, I bet the pages are just as morose.¬†

¬†¬†¬†""Here,"" she said. ""Dreama accidentally left this.""

¬†¬†¬†""Maybe she will come back for it,"" I stiffly told her, thinking it was the right thing to say.

I nearly burned myself on the tasteless coffee. I didn't need whatever the tattered notebook contained or what it could possibly mean.

¬†¬†¬†Nadine shook her frizzy head in disappointment and playfully shoved me. ""Come on, you jerk,"" she teased. ""I only read a few pages. It's all I had time for and from what I read, it would be a serious mistake if you didn't read it right now!""

¬†No one disagrees with Nadine unless you are prepared to take on her sharp wit or her equally sharp claws, so I accepted the worn journal, almost afraid of what I might find, though peeking into her mind was way too tempting. I casually flipped through, scanned some uninteresting passages and noticed some random art clippings of mythological scenes. Then I realized that Nadine was standing there as if aware of some forbidden secret. My face turned red.

¬†¬†¬†‚ÄúWell, I better get back to work,‚Äù I told her.

¬†¬†¬†I tossed the diary or journal into my briefcase and quickly stood up. I hastily gave her a ten-dollar tip and thanked her.

¬†¬†¬†She gave my arm a squeeze and said, ‚ÄúStefan, just promise me that you will read it.‚Äù

¬†¬†¬†I nodded. She always did like soap operas. I gathered my things and headed out to my Mustang. Once inside, I just sat there. What does this diary contain? What would she write about me?

¬†¬†¬†But nothing could prepare me for what I found in those crinkled pages. I never imagined the extent of the effect I had on her. I soon found out. The tender ramblings touched me. The naivete of some entries made me feel guilty. Perhaps, I should have been more careful with my actions and what she mistook them to mean. Only one thing was for certain. After reading it, I must find this woman, so lost and betrayed by her own self. And by me?

¬†¬†¬†I‚Äôm married. That‚Äôs not going to change, but I can at least find a way to contact her. I feel a duty to straighten this mess out. I thought I was just being a nice guy, so where did I go wrong? Maybe I know.

¬†¬†¬†I think I care about her, that waitress. Let me be honest. I have watched her over my newspaper, eyeing her with forbidden desire. I could hardly stand near her without wanting to touch her. Perhaps, I am addicted to her blonde hair and the way she tucks it behind her ear, or maybe it is her large, adoring eyes. But I didn‚Äôt give into temptation. I fought it. She was just a waitress, someone I could toy with. To me, that is all it has been‚Äîuntil now.

Dreama‚Äôs Diary‚ÄìJuly 7

Why does he come here, a mere watering hole for the rich and 9-to-5 routine for the poor? Can it be a meeting ground? Some of the men enjoy pleasant conversations and one of Nadine‚Äôs good jokes. It is a momentary diversion from the cutthroat professions and the corporate ladders. There is a simple goodness emanating from comfort food and Southern beauty.

¬†¬†Raised morally strict and yet crudely sown with the wildness of the defiant earth, this Southern Eve is tired of being blamed for everything Adam does. I can‚Äôt always color in the lines or walk without stumbling, but ‚ÄúAdam‚Äù still sits at the counter, watching me. I don‚Äôt yet offer the apple, though I want to. Instead, I let him eat heart-clogging roast beef covered in melted cheddar and slabs of greasy bacon. Surely an apple is healthier. Am I less guilty for watching him bite into that coronary sandwich instead of my forbidden fruit?

¬†¬†¬†So, what is this place? A testing ground for getting along? Or the Norse Bifrost Bridge, turning away the unworthy? Can I cross? Would I be worthy?

¬†¬†¬†I steal secret glances at his chiseled features and his rigidly upright posture. Perfectly refined with the air of a prince, he bestows his good graces upon me by bringing food for my Ana. Does that make him my master and I, the humble serf bowing in gratitude? I turn away and pretend I‚Äôm cleaning. My mind is heavy with the knowledge that we aren‚Äôt equals.

¬†¬†¬†My wealthy great aunt once gave me a sterling silver medallion that said, ‚ÄúIf I were a star of even, I would rise and set for thee.‚Äù I never quite understood what it meant. To me, it has come to mean that I am less than equal and must hide with the dark of the moon while the rich people of the sun gather in their glitter. Oh, well, I pawned it.

Dreama‚Äôs Diary‚ÄìJuly 9

I combed my blonde hair, carefully checking the mirror at all angles. It seemed lustrous and in place, so never you mind that it is Clairol. Then I powdered my skin. No, I wasn‚Äôt the fairest of them all. The mirror said that my nose was slightly pug, my nostrils too big. My eyes were piercing and demanding; my lips full. I‚Äôm told I‚Äôm pretty. Huh! I tend to doubt that, but wouldn‚Äôt it be nice?

¬†¬†¬†Henry calls me vain. I don‚Äôt think so. Well, maybe a little. I may spend time in front of the mirror. It just means I have brows to pluck, eyes to line and lips to color. I check the mirror one more time. It is only me.

¬†¬†¬†I can offer a firm body, gleaming with health and an adoring heart. Could we be Guinevere and Sir Lancelot wrapped tightly in a secret embrace? You must let me know, Stefan. Your cool demeanor enrages me. I want to crash against you like an iceberg and slowly melt with you under the forbidden sun.

Dreama‚Äôs Diary‚ÄìJuly 18

I don‚Äôt ever eat lunch at work or take a break. I starve myself to stay thin so that I can peek over my shoulder and watch him eye my ankles and rise slowly up my long legs to the roundness of my snug-fitting black shorts. He does it, absorbed in me like a patron at a museum mesmerized by an object of beauty. A subtle pain echoes in his stare. Is it guilt?

¬†¬†¬†I brought him his usual sandwich and smiled sweetly as unaware of that nagging pain gnawing within my own chest. I showed my dimples and a forced sunny disposition while a shadow claimed my mind.

¬†¬†¬†I try to be a cute perky blonde like a siren luring a lost sailor to me, promising that all turmoil ends in my embrace. Come, sailor, tossing in the murky green where only the monsters lurk. Come closer. The sun shines anew at dawn and the sky is a rainbow palette sent to fulfill your raging dream‚Äìso believe in the song I sing to you. Listen to the sweet lies of eternal ecstasy. Let my limbs be home to you. Close your eyes and pretend.

¬†¬†¬†But it is a lie. Keep going, sailor. Don‚Äôt perish in my desperation. Keep going. I‚Äôll be just fine!",1,1750863356.0,MelissaRovellibooks,0,1.0,False

I'm now on servers for everything, including local events, book clubs, cooking advice, and even one where people can share pictures of strange clouds. Compared to creating the ideal caption or performing for followers, the informal, in-the-moment discussions feel so much more natural.

The fact that these communities genuinely endure is amazing. Discord servers create their own culture and inside jokes, unlike Twitter conversations that fade away after two weeks or Facebook groups that die after two weeks. I joined a coffee server where people genuinely celebrate each other's morning brew photos and give equipment advice. It's strangely wholesome.

Everything was also altered by the voice channels. Friends simply jump into voice chat while doing random tasks rather than setting up formal video calls. We'll all be virtually living together, whether it's preparing dinner or walking dogs. It seems to be the closest thing social media has been able to produce to in-person interactions.

1lk7qiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppleCiderVinegarTV/comments/1lk7qiv/looking_good_being_well/,Looking Good  > Being Well,"# Recently read about the tragic case of Paloma Shemirani, a young woman diagnosed with lymphoma and given a high chance of survival with chemotherapy, which she declined. Her brothers write that she chose to forgo traditional treatments and pursue Gerson (""Hirsch"") therapy w/ coffee enemas and juicing instead, largely due to her wellness-cx influencer mother. Reflecting on this case and on the show, I wonder how much of Wellness culture thrives on ""looking well""--which equates to looking attractive, young, and thin, rather than actually ""being well"". Is preserving beauty an ideal worth dying for? Chemotherapy famously causes your hair to fall out, and these ""wellness warriors"" are always pictured with long, shiny hair, falsely advertising the transient ""health benefits"" of choosing the alternative health path. Meanwhile, many of these people posting about shunning modern medicine and vaccines seem to value modern medicine for botox, fillers, hair extensions/hair implants and dyes, veneers, and other cosmetic procedures that allow them to appear younger and ""healthier"".  As a culture, do we incentivize looking well over actually being well? And what message is this sending to our younger generations raised in an image-obsessed reality?

1. The first big tip: was about $65. A 15 mile drive, with about 35 items from costco. A big one but worth it!

2. Free coffee: did a restaurant depot order for a couple items to a coffee shop. It was when I was still new and did not check the miles before accepting it. Almost 35 miles, but decided to finish it. The owner offered me a free coffee with $15 tips. Not much but the gesture matters.

3. Did a super short distance order for an elderly couple. There was already a $20 tip so I was ready to bring the order to their apartment but they came down with their own cart, helped me out and later, increased the tip to $40! Nice people still exists, they are just rarer to find.

4. Biggest tip: It was about $125 for a costco order that I delivered to only five miles away. Got it while a costco morning drop. Could not believe my luck and thought the tip will be reduced, but it stayed!

A trace of surprise flashed in Mia‚Äôs eyes. Was this the guest Sharon had mentioned? A beautiful young woman?.....","Congratulations, you‚Äôre one month pregnant. Everything looks fine.

Mia Bowen held the results of her pregnancy test as she returned to her marital home, feeling like she was dreaming. Was she actually pregnant?

She mustered the courage to text her husband, Timothy Barrett. ‚ÄúWill you be coming home for dinner tonight?‚Äù

It felt like forever as she waited for a reply. He‚Äôd never liked it when people disturbed him at work, and she was worried that her message would go unanswered as it had in the past.

In the next second, her phone lit up. Timothy replied curtly, ‚ÄúYeah. I have something to tell you.‚Äù

After getting an answer, Mia hurried to get the groceries for that night‚Äôs dinner. She put the results of the pregnancy test on the table, then flipped it over, feeling that she was being too obvious.

In the evening, a black limousine drove into the courtyard. Timothy got out with his suit jacket casually flung over one arm. He had a tall figure and striking features.

‚ÄúTimothy, you‚Äôre back.‚Äù Mia jogged over to him, reaching out to take his suit jacket. But Timothy handed her some papers instead. A trace of surprise flashed in her eyes.

‚ÄúTake a look at this. You can bring up any requests you might have,‚Äù he said.

Mia looked down at the papers. The first page had the words ‚Äúdivorce agreement‚Äù written on it. The bright whiteness of the paper seemed to stab her eyes.

Timothy tugged his tie loose, traces of fatigue showing on his face. He looked down at Mia, taking in the baby fat around her face. She looked like a minor.

He didn‚Äôt have any feelings for her. He‚Äôd only married her because his grandmother liked her. Her presence had also improved his grandmother‚Äôs health, so this marriage was mutually beneficial.

If not for the accident a month back, he wouldn‚Äôt even have noticed that they‚Äôd been married for three years.

Keeping this fa√ßade up would only be a waste of Mia‚Äôs time and youth. It was better for them to separate.

Mia gently placed a hand over her belly and asked shakily, ‚ÄúIf‚Äîand this is only hypothetical‚ÄîI were to tell you that I‚Äôm pregnant, would you still go ahead with the divorce?‚Äù

Timothy‚Äôs gaze landed on her belly. He frowned. ‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt I tell you to take the morning-after pill after that time?‚Äù

What happened a month ago was an accident‚Äîthe one and only accident that had happened over the three years of their marriage.

Mia acted like her hand had been burned. She quickly moved it away, but Timothy grabbed her by the wrist with a complicated gaze. ‚ÄúAre you really pregnant?‚Äù

Mia‚Äôs breathing hitched. ‚ÄúI asked you a question. If I were pregnant, would you want to keep the baby?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

Timothy sighed. There was no point in having a baby when its parents were caught in a loveless marriage. It was what had happened with his parents.

Mia‚Äôs heart seemed to empty out as he let go of her.

She watched as he walked away. Then, she tilted her head back to force the tears back. Timothy‚Äôs words where like knives that stabbed her right in the chest.

Mia looked at the food she‚Äôd put her heart into making. They had gone cold. She poured them into the trash, feeling a bit nauseous from the greasiness.

She rubbed her belly. There was a tiny life growing in there. She swallowed her bitterness as she thought, ‚ÄúYour daddy may not want you, but I‚Äôll definitely protect you with all I‚Äôve got.‚Äù

She‚Äôd grown up as an orphan. Her adoptive parents had kicked her aside after giving birth to a pair of twins, banishing her to her adoptive aunt‚Äôs house. Fortunately, her aunt, Patricia Bowen, treated her well.

It was Mia‚Äôs biggest wish to have a family of her own. She knew Timothy didn‚Äôt love her, but she‚Äôd still tried her best to be a good wife to him. Now, reality had proven to her that it was impossible for one to make a rock melt.

Still, now that she was pregnant, she wouldn‚Äôt be alone anymore, even after the divorce.

Mia didn‚Äôt bother reading the divorce agreement. She just signed on the last page.

That night, she slept in the master bedroom as usual while Timothy slept in the study. Everything was the same as before‚Äîthey‚Äôd been married for three years but had also slept separately for those three years.

‚Ä¶

The following morning, Mia received a call from her mother-in-law, Sharon Hopkins. Sharon sounded imperious as she said, ‚ÄúMia, have the maids tidy up one of the guest bedrooms on the second floor.

‚ÄúA guest will be staying over for a few days. Remember to welcome her and treat her nicely.‚Äù

Mia didn‚Äôt even have time to ask who it was when Sharon had already hung up.

She smiled faintly, already used to how disdainful Sharon was of her. It was as if saying another word to her would bring shame to the Barrett family.

When Mia came downstairs, Timothy had left for work.

In the afternoon, a young woman dressed from head to toe in branded clothing walked into the living room. A trace of surprise flashed in Mia‚Äôs eyes. Was this the guest Sharon had mentioned? A beautiful young woman?

**Chapter 2**

A hint of mockery flashed in Mia‚Äôs eyes. In the past, she would‚Äôve felt terrible. But now that she and Timothy were divorced, it didn‚Äôt matter how many women were to stay in the villa. It had nothing to do with her.

Mia stepped forward. ‚ÄúHi‚Äî‚Äù

Before she could finish, the beautiful woman ignored her and walked around the living room. Then, she said to the butler, Kaleb Gould, ‚ÄúThose curtains are hideous, and so is the couch. Remember to also change the beds in the bedrooms to the brand I like.‚Äù

Mia watched as this ‚Äúguest‚Äù criticized every corner of her marital home. She said bluntly, ‚ÄúWho are you? We‚Äôre not doing any renovations here.‚Äù

‚ÄúAllow me to introduce myself‚ÄîI‚Äôm Maya Lane, and I‚Äôm the future lady of this household. Naturally, that means I call the shots when it comes to this villa‚Äôs furnishings.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre Maya Lane?‚Äù

A trace of bitterness crept into Mia‚Äôs heart. It was no wonder Timothy had suddenly brought up the divorce. Maya was back.

Since his first love was back, Mia, the cheap substitute, had to go.

‚ÄúI guess you‚Äôve heard of me. Hurry up and sign those divorce papers, then. You‚Äôve held onto this position for the past three years; it‚Äôs time for you to return it to its rightful owner,‚Äù Maya said Mia said calmly, ‚ÄúYou make it sound like you really love Timothy. If that‚Äôs the case, why didn‚Äôt you marry him three years ago when he was in a coma from the accident?‚Äù

Back then, Timothy had gotten into a terrible accident. His grandmother, Laura Graham, wanted to get him a wife so he could leave some offspring behind, but the socialites that usually crowded around him wanted nothing to do with him.

At the time, Mia had been Laura‚Äôs carer, and Laura treated her incredibly well. She‚Äôd even lent Mia money to repay her debts. Mia couldn‚Äôt bear to see Laura devastated by her grandson‚Äôs death, so she agreed to marry Timothy.

Everyone had thought Timothy wouldn‚Äôt make it through, herself included. She thought the marriage was only for show. But to everyone‚Äôs surprise, Timothy had suddenly regained consciousness!

Since then, her position in the Barrett family had become too awkward for words. After all, everyone would only make fun of the Barrett family, the richest family in Bern City, because of its scion marrying a regular carer.

That was why her identity had been kept a secret for the past three years.

Maya stiffened. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because my brothers refused to let me marry Tim and even locked me up at home. I lost my chance to marry him because of that, and you swooped in.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm warning you‚ÄîI‚Äôm the heiress to the Lane family from Nord City, and my brothers are all super powerful. It‚Äôd do you good to worry about your family if you ever wanted to go against me!‚Äù

Mia‚Äôs expression turned cold. ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt let you off the hook if you dare lay a hand on my family. Sign the agreement if you don‚Äôt want anything to happen to them, then.‚Äù Maya glanced at the divorce agreement on the coffee table, feeling smug. She‚Äôd waited for this day for three years.

Mia said calmly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve already signed it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAt least you‚Äôre not a complete idiot.‚Äù Maya pulled a check out of her bag. ‚ÄúThis is a million dollars. Take it as a little gift from me.‚Äù

A trace of mockery flashed in Mia‚Äôs eyes. She didn‚Äôt accept the check.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me you think it‚Äôs too little. This would be ten years‚Äô worth of your pay as a carer. Take the money and stay away from our lives. Tim and I are a perfect match for each other, unlike you.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just a country bumpkin. You and us rich people are from different worlds.‚Äù

Maya‚Äôs words stabbed Mia. She staggered to the master bedroom in a daze. Even if Maya hadn‚Äôt dropped by today, she would‚Äôve left anyway.

Since she and Timothy were now divorced, there was no point in her staying here.

As Mia packed, she realized how few belongings she had. They weren‚Äôt even enough to fill one suitcase. The past three years seemed like a dream to her.

She looked at the pregnancy test on the bedside table and told herself it was time to put an end to things.

At this moment, Maya strode into the master bedroom like she owned it. She was still holding the divorce agreement. ‚ÄúAre you done packing?‚Äù

She glanced around, spotting the piece of paper on the bedside table. She seemed to catch the words ‚Äúchildren‚Äôs and women‚Äôs hospital‚Äù on it. A trace of confusion flashed in her eyes.

Mia quickly grabbed the pregnancy test and crumpled it into a ball. Maya asked in surprise, ‚ÄúWait, are you pregnant?

**Chapter 3**

Mia clenched her fist around the pregnancy test. ‚ÄúIf I really were pregnant, I wouldn‚Äôt have agreed to the divorce.‚Äù

‚ÄúI suppose that‚Äôs right. After all, a gold digger like you wouldn‚Äôt let any opportunity to rise the ranks with a pregnancy slip. Still, even if you were pregnant, Tim wouldn‚Äôt allow you to keep the baby. You‚Äôre a peasant who doesn‚Äôt deserve to give the Barrett family an heir, anyway,‚Äù said Maya.

Mia turned to head into the walk-in closet, but Maya followed her. ‚ÄúHold on. Show me that paper you took from the bedside table.‚Äù

After some thought, Maya felt she couldn‚Äôt rest easy until she knew what the paper said. What if Mia really were pregnant? She had to get rid of the baby.

Mia held the pregnancy test tighter. ‚ÄúThis is my private business.‚Äù

‚ÄúHumph! Private business? I bet you‚Äôre just trying to steal something expensive. Hand it over!‚Äù Maya stepped forward to pry Mia‚Äôs fist open, even raising a hand to hit her.

Mia instinctively threw Maya over her shoulder. The latter landed on her back and wailed, ‚ÄúMy leg hurts!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the hell are you doing, Mia?‚Äù

At this moment, Timothy‚Äôs cold voice rang out. Mia turned to see him walk into the room, and her heart jolted. She mumbled, ‚ÄúTimothy, it‚Äôs not like what you think ‚Ä¶‚Äù

The only response she received was him walking past her to sweep Maya into his arms. He happened to see the divorce agreement with Mia‚Äôs name signed on the last page. Timothy stared at it for a while longer. Had Mia signed the papers so quickly?

‚ÄúTim?‚Äù

Timothy returned to his senses and asked Maya lowly, ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy hand hurts, Tim. Is it broken? Can I continue playing the piano in the future?‚Äù Maya wept.

Timothy placed her on the bed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre fine. I‚Äôll have a doctor check on you.‚Äù

Then, he turned to look at Mia. ‚ÄúApologize to Maya.‚Äù

Maya was the heiress to the Lane family and had three older brothers who absolutely doted on her. If the Lane family were to find out about Mia laying a hand on her, they wouldn‚Äôt let Mia off the hook.

Mia‚Äôs heart ached at how Timothy said Maya‚Äôs name. Their names were so similar, but Timothy had never pronounced hers correctly.

Even during the one night they‚Äôd slept together, he‚Äôd called Maya‚Äôs name. She thought he‚Äôd been calling her like how he usually mispronounced it, but she now realized he‚Äôd just been calling Maya‚Äôs name. She‚Äôd thought too highly of herself.

From beginning to end, she was nothing but Maya‚Äôs substitute. The ache in Mia‚Äôs heart intensified until she grew numb. She said hoarsely, ‚ÄúApologize?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the one who laid a hand on her first; even a child would know what to do in this situation. Besides, do you know how important a pianist‚Äôs hands are?‚Äù Timothy snarled.

Mia felt like she should‚Äôve expected this. Even a strand of hair on Maya‚Äôs head was more important than her. On the other hand, she was worth less than a blade of grass by the roadside.

She‚Äôd suffered in silence for three years, and she didn‚Äôt want to take it anymore.

Mia said stubbornly, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care whether you believe me, but she‚Äôs the one who made the first move!‚Äù

Kaleb, who stood at the master bedroom‚Äôs doorway, chimed in, ‚ÄúMr. Barrett, I saw everything happen. Mrs. Barrett‚Äôs the one who pushed Ms. Lane.

Timothy frowned and growled, ‚ÄúApologize!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if I refuse?‚Äù

A trace of surprise flashed in Timothy‚Äôs eyes. When had Mia, who had always been obedient and accommodating, been so sharp-tongued?

He pursed his lips. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a tough streak, huh? Think about your uncle who‚Äôs still lying in a bed in the hospital‚Äôs private ward!‚Äù

Mia‚Äôs uncle, James Stone, had gotten into a fight and had tried to escape when the police wanted to arrest him. Unfortunately, he‚Äôd ended up getting into an accident in the process of escaping. He was still comatose in the hospital.

This was enough. Hadn‚Äôt she learned her lesson yet?

Mia held back her tears, finding it hard to believe that Timothy had used James to threaten her. She looked at Maya, who lay on her bed, looking like she belonged there. The wedding picture that hung above the bed seemed to mock Mia‚Äôs existence.

Mia finally gave in to the harsh reality. She said hoarsely, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry........

25M. 5‚Äô10 155lbs.

Been having some weird stomach issues for the last couple weeks and haven‚Äôt been able to pinpoint much.

Started as a sharp, ball-like, pain in my right side closer to the top of the pelvis. After a few days, the pain slowly started to improve but I‚Äôve noticed a lot (what feels like) inflammation in that area starting from the lower right abdomen and going all the way up to the bottom of my right ribcage. The pain was never excruciating or debilitating, just annoying. I‚Äôve had a bit of constipation but can still go every morning, but notice some narrowish, incomplete stools (not dark or tarry). Also, normal labs except a 78 ALT result but I did drink a decent amount the weekend prior so I‚Äôm not sure if that would cause that.

Been taking pantoprazole and famotidine as my PCP thinks it may be acid reflux or GERD related, but hasn‚Äôt helped too too much.

The inflammation tends to be at its worst after I have my morning coffee and head to work and then by around dinner time the inflammation seems to go away and I feel much better until the next morning when I head into work again (stress?).

Last big thing, I quit vaping about 5 weeks ago and never really had issues like this until I quit so I‚Äôm wondering if this could be a lingering withdrawal symptom or my gut repairing from not having nicotine.

Any relations or advice would be great!

In the clear sky, a large passenger aircraft was flying smoothly, leaving a jet stream of white in the clear blue sky.

Outside, the sun was intense, Yan Liang pulled the shade down and continued to work on the file on the tray table.

It was lunch time and the flight attendants were catering to the guests

The catering car came to her side, the flight attendant bent over to put her knife and fork on the table, but seeing the table filled with files, stopped, perplexed.

Yan Liang put down the pen, lifted her head to look at the flight attendant: ‚ÄúI only need a cup of coffee, thank you.‚Äù

The stewardess nodded with a smile, poured the coffee and handed her the cup.

As Yan Liang tried to take the cup, the flight suddenly hit an air pocket.

The stewardess immediately tried to steady the cup, but the coffee spilled all over the files.

Yan Liang quickly reached out to protect her files in the ensuing chaos. Her quick thinking saved her files, but her skirt was stained by the coffee.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry! Sorry!‚Äù the stewardess hurriedly handed her a paper towel.

At this time the captain also broadcasted the notice: ‚ÄúWe encountered a brief turbulence, we request the passengers to wear their seat belts.‚Äù

Yan Liang hurriedly blotted the coffee on the files. Seeing a few of her documents had fallen to the the aisle, Yan Liang put her cup on the table, took off her seat belt and got up to pick up the documents.

As she bent to pick up the file, a hand extended the files to her. The hand belonged to the passenger sitting behind her.

Yan Liang first saw the part of the hand from the wrist to the elbow exposed under folded sleeves of the shirt. It was a lean arm, a watch on the wrist, the fingers slender. She reached for the file to say thank you, but as she moved her eyes up she was shocked.

As her eyes moved along the man‚Äôs arm up to see the man‚Äôs face, she clearly saw him quickly reading her file.

He was sitting, Yan Liang was standing, from her vantage point, although she couldn‚Äôt see the whole face of this person, she could clearly see him stare at the file with two sharp abnormal eyes.

Inexplicably she felt so cold she coughed drily, waving her hands signaling him to handover the file and then in a deliberately strident tone to remind him ‚ÄúThank you .‚Äù

The man looked up.

Far more than sharp eyes, his eyes were simply ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ as dominant as in the eagle ‚Äì

which is the only feeling Yan Liang had when her eyes met his.

But then, those sharp eyes softened, he smiled, and handed back the file.

Yan Liang quickly returned to her seat, put the file back. Curious, she could not help but look back again. At this time, the passenger behind was dining. He simply looked like a handsome stranger.

Was it just her illusion? Yan Liang shook her head.

\*\*\*

Three hours later the plane landed, the journey across the ocean was finally over.

Yan Liang walked towards the baggage claim. Red lips, expressionless face, black high heels hitting the marble floor with a ‚Äúda da‚Äù sound, a stylish dress but stained with coffee stains made her feel slightly embarrassed

As Yan Liang waited for her luggage, she intended to to go to the bathroom to change her clothes, but she was stopped by a a suited gentlemen.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù She was not in a hurry.

The man looked questioningly at her face, removed a pair of glasses from his carry on bag: ‚ÄúThis is yours, right?‚Äù

Yan Liang was stunned.

She carefully looked at the glasses, they were hers.

‚ÄúI found it on the plane.‚Äù

Yan Liang‚Äôs glasses do not have a high power, she only wears it during office hours. After the lunch episode, she did not look at the file, so she actually did not realise when the glasses were lost.

Yan Liang smiled, and as she reached out to take the glasses quickly, she noticed there was a business card with the glasses.

‚ÄúNot surprising,then, we will soon meet again.‚Äù

Yan Liang just wanted to leave as soon as possible. She did not take too much notice of this strange man‚Äôs strange comment. She took the card, with a sidelong glance, she nodded slightly to show goodbye and hastily left, leaving the man standing and stammering behind her.

And she walked out of the International Arrivals towards the door, she dropped the business card in the trash bin on her way.

As she dropped the business cards, her ears heard a familiar voice: ‚ÄúYan Liang!‚Äù

Yan Liang stopped.

Looking to where the sound came from, she saw the door being pushed.

He waved at her, closely cropped hair, a competent smile.

Finally there was a trace of emotion in her face ‚Äú I am so honoured, are you so tired of your manager that you came to personally pick me up?‚Äù

He gave her a helpless smile in exchange to her ridicule: ‚ÄúA year has gone by, but your words have become more and more sharp..‚Äù

‚ÄúA year has gone by, but you have become more and more handsome‚Äù, she answered.

Sunny weather, bright eyes, the man‚Äôs smile was warmer than the sun . Yan Liang looked away to eliminate her heart of evil thoughts: ‚ÄúWhat happened to Zhou Shu? He is usually responsible for picking me up.‚Äù

‚ÄúMy father drove Xi Ziqing‚Äôs mother to the hospital to see your father, and I was on leave today, so I decided to replace my dad to be your driver for the day .‚Äù Taking her luggage, he walked towards the parking lot.

Not far from the parking lot, a luxury car was parked quietly, the window glass and the eyes of the man sitting in the back seat both black as ink.

He was looking out of the window, his gaze lazy, but eyes predatory like an eagle, one hand supporting his chin on the edge of the window, his face cold.

The man who was with Yan Liang before approached the car from the other side ,opened the door and sat in the car. Turning back , he said to the man in the back seat:: ‚ÄúMr. Jiang, I have something for you.‚Äù

Mr Jiang nodded silently , gazed out out of the window to see Yan Liang and her companion get into the another car not far away then softly ordered the driver:. ‚ÄúDrive.‚Äù

\*\*\*

Zhou Cheng started the car, asked her: ‚ÄúWhat about the company ‚Äòs operating data I sent you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was reading it on the plane , almost finished.‚Äù

‚ÄúNow the company is very chaotic, you have to get to know these things as soon as possible. Do you want to go home or go directly to the hospital to visit Father?‚Äù

Yan Liang was seated in the co ‚Äì pilot seat, the sun was shielded by the window, her expression turned negative: ‚ÄúHow is my dad now ?‚Äù

‚ÄúLast week he had a stroke, he has been in hospital since then, now the situation is fairly stable.‚Äù

Zhou Cheng accelerated , it seemed that this is an important thing to think about, through the rearview mirror he looked at Yan Liang before continuing: ‚ÄúYour sister is also in the hospital.‚Äù.

He looked at her, she looked upset, he silently turned around and said.‚ÄùDo not think about her anymore, all right, look at my face.‚Äù

Yan Liang smiled, but her eyes were unsmiling:. ‚ÄúZhou Cheng, Xu Ziqing\* is a goddess in your eyes, but she is just a weed in my eyes ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù

\*google translates this name as Fu Jian school. I am just keeping this as Xu Ziqing based on my later reads

Yan Liang chose to go home, rather than go to the hospital as she really wanted to avoid any family conflicts.

A ten hour flight where she spent most of her time to review the files, she was tired enough. Now after a comfortable bath, she was lying on the couch watching TV, finally feeling a little cozy.

Yan Liang was changing channels rapidly, when she stopped at a local station, saw the advertisement for a new product and then changed to the local news channel.

The anchor was saying ‚Äú..has developed high-end skin care brands such as Xu‚Äôs dream, however in recent years their position is no longer the same. Now with the chairman Xu Jinfu suffering a stroke and admitted to the hospital, the company is in a difficult situation. Informed sources say Xu Jinfu has approached a headhunting company to look for appropriate management personnel. He intends to change the management to professional managers and break the usual family business model. Xu ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù

Yan Liang stared at the TV with a frown. Suddenly she heard the sound of the door opening and she immediately changed to an entertainment channel.

Lazily lying on the sofa, she lifted her head to see a woman opening the door: ‚ÄúMom.‚Äù

Yan Mu looked at Yan Liang lazing like this, immediately her face sank.

‚ÄúEven Zhou Cheng knows enough to go to the hospital to visit your father, you skip, you return to home to hide here and watch these -‚Äù Yan Mu glanced at the chatter of the television program, ‚Äú- you‚Äôre making a mess of things.‚Äù

Yan Liang simply turned off the TV, got up and put on her slippers, and poured a glass of water for her mother: ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you most annoyed to see the mother of Xu Ziqing? When I heard from Zhou Cheng that she and her mother were in the hospital, I thought since they are there, you will certainly not step into the hospital.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou do not know your father darling. I sent you to go abroad to study for an MBA degree so you can inherit the company, and now, with your dad‚Äôs stroke, the company is in this chaotic set and directly appointed Xu Ziqing in the management layer. That‚Äôs why I told you to return home immediately. In the present situation, it is likely that those who express filial piety, your dad is ready to help them.And you do not even go to the hospital to see your dad? When the company falls into the hands of Xu Ziqing and her mother, you will regret it.

‚ÄúYou are right! You have thought it out well!‚Äù Yan Liang, pushed her mother out of the bedroom. ‚ÄúLiang Yi made some stew soup, do you want your daughter to accompany you while you have some soup downstairs?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt pretend you care about me; if you really don‚Äôt want to see me worry, you quickly get started with the company‚Äôs things, so people don‚Äôt think of me as a joke who did not fight that wild woman and let the illegitimate daughter take over.‚ÄùHow will I save face?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou tell me what I have to do, go to the head office, right?‚Äù Yan Liang said, finally getting a word in.

Finally, nobody had the cold soup, the soup was sent directly to the poor and they went to the hospital.

This was a premium ward; the corridor decoration was like a five-star hotel. As Yan Liang stepped out of the elevator, she saw Zhou Cheng leaning on the rails. She stepped forward and patted his shoulder.

Zhou Cheng raised his head, saw her, and was surprised: ‚ÄúDid you not say that today you won‚Äôt come to the hospital?‚Äù

Yan Liang could only reluctantly shrug: ‚ÄúWhy are you outside in the corridor?‚Äù

‚ÄúFather is talking to the head hunter company inside. He is interested in meeting with the professional managers, let us avoid.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor what role?‚Äù

Zhou Cheng secretly said: ‚ÄúPowerful role.‚Äù

Yan Liang thought back to the news she saw at home: professional managers, family business model to change ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ all kinds of unfavorable news that she secretly speculated for a moment, before she calmly changed the topic: ‚ÄúWhere is Xu Ziqing?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe is sending her mother to the car downstairs; she will come back in a little while.‚Äù

Seeing Yan Liang‚Äôs expression, he sang the old tune: ‚ÄúYan Liang, do not target her, ok?‚Äù

Cheerfully regaining her composure, she said contemptuously: ‚ÄúWhy do you all think I am against her, rather than she against me?‚Äù

Without waiting for him to say another word, Yan Liang took a U-turn and left.

She heard him call out to her, but she didnt stop.

Unfortunately, Yan Liang did not think she was going to hit the elevator just when Xu Ziqing was returning.

As the elevator doors opened, the two women were face to face, both surprised for a moment.

Xu Ziying was the first one to react. Stepping out of the elevator, she immediately looked up and down at Yan Liang: ‚ÄúHow come you‚Äôre here? Willing to come back?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are not qualified to speak to me in this tone.‚Äù

‚ÄúLast year, you did not come home, and now that there‚Äôs a mess at home you have to come back immediately, it is hard not to think of you as taking advantage of the chaos selfishly.‚Äù

Yan Liang tried to move around her, but was stopped: ‚ÄúWhy are you leaving now?‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you do not want me to slap you like I did last time, let me go now.‚Äù

Xu Ziqing smiled: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt say I forgot, I‚Äôd really like to thank you for that slap, if not , how could I cry to father and get so many shares?

Yan Liang was unable to suppress her anger as her teeth clenched.

‚ÄúYou do not know how angry your mother was then. She was willing to let my mother in because of the agreement: I can not compete for shares with you, but you, with a slap you destroyed so many years of your mother‚Äôs effort. If I were her, I would be mad at you too. ‚Äù

Yan Liang laughed. Xu Ziying‚Äôs expression changed, Yan Liang‚Äôs laugh was almost domineering: ‚ÄúDo you not know, that a man‚Äôs child will always have a natural psychological advantage? He owes you so much, he cannot even legally acknowledge your mother. When you go home with your mother every year to visit relatives, are you not being pointed at? I absolutely agree about the monetary compensation. What did he feel for you, if not pity?‚Äù

Xu Ziqing eyes blazed with anger showing that Yan Liang‚Äôs words had hit their mark.

But in the next second, Yan Liang could not laugh anymore ‚Äì

‚ÄúSpeaking of, I have something to tell you .Zhou Cheng- he proposed to me,‚Äù

At that moment, Yan Liang felt her hands turn cold.

Xu Ziqing haughtily said: ‚ÄúBut you can rest assured, I will not promise him, of course, I will not accept him. This man hurt my sister‚Äôs heart so I strung him along for a long time, don‚Äôt you feel better? ‚Äù

Yan Liang finally did not hold back, the palm of your hand was raised.

Zhou Cheng is her Achilles heel ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶

But this slap, ultimately failed to land on the face of innocent Xu Ziqing -Yan Liang‚Äôs wrist was grabbed. She was surprised to see the hand that grabbed her wrist.

Lean arms ,wearing a watch, she had a feeling of deja vu.

Yan Liang suddenly raised her head ‚Äì her eyes landed on a pair of familiar eyes.

The man she met on the plane, the man who had a pair of memorable eyes.

**Chapter 2**

Yan Liang tried several times to pull her hand back but failed, the man seemed to have a lazy attitude, but in reality he had great strength.

In any case, Yan Liang could not shake him off, and ultimately could only glare at him: ‚ÄúLet go.‚Äù

He just smiled: ‚Äù Such brutish behaviour isn‚Äôt beautiful .‚Äù

‚ÄúNone of your business.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou destroyed my good impression of you before, how is this nothing to do with me?‚Äù

This man sounded very sincere, but his whole body emitted an aura that was at odds with his voice.

Yan Liang was momentarily speechless, vaguely she was able to hear other footsteps coming near; she was still looking at the face. Her efforts to struggle could not help but bring them close .He seemed to realise this and loosened his grip on her hand.

Footsteps getting closer, Yan Liang looked up to see the person who was coming this way. Looking at him, her eyes widened, her teeth clenched.

Zhou Cheng entered the elevator to see the three were at a stalemate, hesitated, then came forward: ‚ÄúMr. Jiang, I will accompany you down stairs.‚Äù

He looked indifferently as if he was a stranger, his indifference almost carried a hint of contempt: ‚ÄúNo, thank you‚Äù.

With his head down, he stepped into the elevator, but stopped in the middle and turned back.

He looked at her eyes glaring at him, and inexplicably she felt a chill in her heart.

‚ÄúGoodbye, rude lady.‚Äù

Yan Liang was unable to hold back her angry stare.

At the moment, seeing this, Xu Ziying laughed. Trying to fake consideration, she said: ‚ÄúYan Liang, you do not have to go with me to see father.‚Äù

Yan Liang look at her coldly, turned around and walked towards the ward.

Xu Ziqing stayed in place, but shrugged, and walked towards the same direction.

Zhou Cheng also realised he couldn‚Äôt do anything about the strange atmosphere, only patted Xu Ziying‚Äôs shoulder to show comfort.

But Xu Ziying looked at the elevator until the elevator door closed. Only then with a strange look she asked Zhou Cheng: ‚ÄúWho is he?‚Äù

‚ÄúJiang Yu Nan.‚Äù

Xu Ziqing was immediately stunned.

Yan Liang was about to turn to the elevator when she heard that ,her rapid footsteps also suddenly stopped.

Jiang Yu Nan ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

He was actually Jiang Yu Nan.

Yan Liang was no stranger to the name.

Jiang Yu Nan had served as the Asia Pacific Regional Manager with an international brand before. In two or three years, he had managed to enhance the performance of the region so that sales had doubled, and created a special line for Asian skin. The brand was very popular and become another cash cow for the Corporation.

Is father interested in poaching him as a CEO?

Yan Mu soon heard the news. At the evening meal at home, she was very anxious to ask Yan Liang the details.

Yan Liang buried her head down to eat, she did not want to raise her head. Only vaguely she said: ‚ÄúI only know that he deliberately went to the hospital today to visit the Father, I do not know anything else.‚Äù

Yan Mu stopped eating: ‚ÄúIf that is so, then how will you fight him?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a wise decision for the future of the company, and I feel fine.‚Äù

Yan Mu immediately banged down her chopsticks on the table, the sound especially loud.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs with your attitude? Your dad is putting someone over your head for vested interests, how are you not anxious?‚Äù

Yan Liang kept her head down; she did not dare to refute her mother‚Äôs words.

Yan Mu could see their own benefits so much, but her daughter did not look like she had the heart, she could only direct: ‚ÄúIn short, in next Monday‚Äôs provisional shareholders meeting, I will take you to Chen Shu, you must oppose this resolution.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you not hear me?‚Äù

Yan Liang, for no reason, suddenly recalled the image of a pair of eagle like sharp eyes, she tried to dislodge the image from her head. She put down the chopsticks and got up: ‚ÄúI ‚Äòm full.‚Äù

Yan Liang was in a complex mood as she participated in the shareholders meeting a few days later.

In order for Father to implement this decision, the shareholders quarrelled, many opposing the decision as they feared for their vested interests if the family management system that was running the company so long was removed

Some people were still sitting on the fence: ‚ÄúJiang Yu Nan Xu has not yet agreed to the invitation, all this discussion is premature.‚Äù

Chen Shu has always been firmly opposed to the decision. And this shareholders meeting, in fact, he was opposed to the attitude of private shareholders together to discuss how to stop the matter coming true.

Chen Shu just put the views to the body, asked: ‚ÄúYan Liang, what do you think?‚Äù

The company‚Äôs old shareholders had seen Yan Liang grow up; she had inherited the company‚Äôs most orthodox candidates. For the moment they looked at her eyes and calmed down.

Yan Liang faced a dilemma between her inclination and her mother‚Äôs will: ‚ÄúI ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶‚Äù

She had barely spoken when the conference room door was suddenly opened ‚Äì

the people suspiciously turned to look.

They saw Xu Ziqing pushing a wheelchair and come in. Sitting on the wheelchair was Xu Jinfu .He was looking pretty good.

Yan Liang was also very surprised; she stood up: ‚ÄúDad.‚Äù

Xu Ziqing pushed the wheelchair near the chairman‚Äôs seat, Xu Jinfu looked around, slowly saying: ‚ÄúAre you not surprised to see me here?‚Äù

Xu Jinfu still had a slight lisp, but his words were quite clear.

The shareholders present had different expressions, as if they had seen a ghost, but no one dared to utter a sound.

Xu Jinfu‚Äôs eyes went round the conference table, and ultimately looked with disappointment at Yan Liang: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not dead, and you are already keeping me away and calling a general meeting of shareholders. When I finally die, wont my company be carved up by you?‚Äù

Though Xu Jinfu experienced a serious illness, everyone was shocked at his words ,their faces turning white. Xu Jinfu said: ‚ÄúThe meeting is over, you can go.‚Äù Several shareholders looked at each other, they got up to leave.

Yan Liang got up to leave as well, when her father added: ‚ÄúYan Liang, you stay.‚Äù

Yan Liang glanced at her father and Xu Ziqing behind him. She saw her own father‚Äôs look of contempt, and feeling both helpless and angry she said: ‚ÄúI did not intend to participate ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶‚Äù

Xu Ziqing interrupted Yan Liang: ‚ÄúYou do not say a word, do not provoke Dad.‚Äù

Still not giving Yan Liang a chance to retort,Xu Ziqing poured a glass of water on the table for her father, she seemed to try to calm his sullen temper : ‚ÄúDad, don‚Äôt be angry, Yan Liang is still young, it is understood that the uncles said a few things, they are afraid of their own interests before the damage ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ ‚Äù

Obviously, the words of Xu Ziqing were counterproductive ‚Äì

Xu Jinfu waved his arm ,knocking down the cup of water

Yan Liang was splashed with the hot water.

Yan Liang, not for the first time, admired her half-sister. She had even managed to prepare this cup of hot water in advance for her ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYoung is not an excuse! Why can you not learn from your sister ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶‚Äù

Yan Liang bowed her head down to see her white clothes had been soaked in water and were now semi-transparent. She surprised herself, and laughed out, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve never heard my side of the story, but I‚Äôm used to it.‚Äù

Having said that, she turned around and left.

As she walked out of the conference room, she could feel the people around staring at her and her awkward state.

Yan Liang walked rapidly towards the elevator. The hot water was cooling on her dress. Her heart, too, felt more and more cold. Cold, but she was through.

You have let me down completely‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Xu Jin Fu‚Äôs words echoed in her mind.

She looked up, stopped to watch the people around her, who averted their gaze.

At this time, she realised her arm had a red hot blister from the hot water, her clothes were drenched, her underwear clearly visible ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ suddenly a strong sense of helplessness overtook her; she did not know what to do.

Yan Liang was rooted to the spot.

As the surrounding noise become more and more lively, she felt more and more small. She should leave.

Suddenly, she felt something heavy on her shoulder.

I'm currently living in Ireland and working as a barista. I'm living here for two years and worked in 4 different places. What I want to know if Im overreacting is:

I was never treated really well, I always feel like they talk to me as if I'm not a hard working person, that they actually didn't want to hire.

On my first day in my first job, the Company didn't even knew that the RH hired me and they treated me like it was my fault. I almost cry, but I refuse myself to cry at work hahah :(

In my current job I have 2 supervisors (for a time of 6 people), one manage by fear and the other one is just and useless arrognt person. And there's also a manager and a director (?) I dont even know whats the last person position.

The thing is that I work separeted from the rest of the time, because the coffee machine is not in the same place as the rest. And what happens is that I can't talk to the rest of the time when they are passing through, because there's already someone looking with a mad face at us. I can't go to the toilet for 2 minutes when there's no customer around, I have to call someone to cover me, and stay there doing nothing, because there's nothing to do.
One of the supervisors always tell customers that ""he only went there to make his coffee, and not to help me"" when it's busy.

I'm a really hard working, and I get easily bored when there's nothing to do, so I'm always looking for something. Today I even ask them if there was something I could do to help, because I had already cleaned everything I could where I was (yeah, I can't leave the coffee machine alone).

I'm sure I don't do everything right, but I always do the best I can, and even though I'm treated like I'm a lazy person and a bad employee.

I find this really humiliating and it makes me so sad. Am I overreacting? It's like this everywhere in this entry level jobs and I'm just not used to?

Edit: I forgot to say that my time keep telling me that I have just to ignore because they are like that and blablabla
But I don't agree with accepting being treated like that. It's going to be like this everywhere?

A couple of questions please:

1. Hotel Brandan vs Hotel F√∏royar? Which one would you pick?  Since we planned this trip rather late most of the places I wanted to stay around the islands are already booked. We're not the Airbnb types so hotels are preferred. So we're staying put T√≥rshavn throughout our trip.
2. We'll have a car and Im not pre-planning anything.  I'll just take it as it comes based on the weather. I have spots all marked in a google map of the photos I wanna take so hopefully the weather will corporate.
3. So far we're planning to dine at ROKS and Paz - the new place from the Chef at KOKs... Thats for my birthday dinner and Im really excited. Any other places you recommend?  I hear the famous fish n chips truck is closed. Any other options?
4. We also love coffee shops. Any coffee shops to check out? So far Ive added Caf√© E√∞ge / Cafe Edge to my list (apparently the northernmost cafe on earth?)

If someone gives you a warm drink to hold‚Äîsay, a cup of tea instead of a can of cold soda‚Äîyou are more likely to describe that person as warm, friendly, and trustworthy.

Not because the tea smells cozy or because the gesture is kind. But literally because your brain links physical warmth with emotional warmth.

This was shown in a study where participants who held a warm cup judged strangers as kinder and more generous than those who held an iced coffee. No other difference, just the temperature in their hands.

It‚Äôs believed to trace back to early development: when you‚Äôre a baby, the people who keep you physically warm also feed you, protect you, comfort you. So your brain wires warmth to safety. Not metaphorical warmth‚Äîjust the heat of skin, milk, blankets.

So, here is the pro tip: if you know you are going to injest a bladder irritant (coffee, alcohol, carbonated beverages of any kind, tomato sauce or spicy food), you can mitigate the inflammation of the bladder walls by drinking a little bit of baking soda in a glass of water. The dosage should be on the side of the box. 

The bladder walls are sensitive to the same things that the stomach lining is. Therefore, treating your bladder urgency is a lot like treating acid reflux. Creating a more alkaline environment in your urine can decrease urinary urgency, frequency and leakage. Cheers üçª",3,1750862153.0,ProstateCancer,2,0.81,False

We even briefly dated for  back then before realizing we were better as friends. After that, we became incredibly close‚Äîwe did everything together and were best friends for about two years.

Then he met a girl. A couple of months into their relationship, she told him she was uncomfortable with him spending time with me, even just for a coffee. Eventually, he stopped seeing me completely‚Äîno explanation.

They dated for couple years. After they broke up, we reconnected, started hanging out again, and a few years later began dating. We‚Äôve now been together for three years, and in many ways, I truly love being with him. 

But here's where I‚Äôm struggling: I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how he dropped me from his life back then without any warning, just because a girl he had just started dating asked him to. He didn‚Äôt even talk to me about it. It felt like a betrayal then, and honestly, it still does.

It makes me feel like I was disposable, like I came second. It also makes me question his values‚Äîhow easily he could walk away from someone he claimed to care about deeply.

I have been GRINDING on making a good pour over but for the life of me I can‚Äôt get it right. However, I have identified what the problem is, I just can‚Äôt find out how fix it. My coffee is always under extracted. It‚Äôs watery but leaves a good after taste. Still has tons of caffeine. I want a full bodied rich tasting cup that hits your mouth like hot chocolate does (not the same taste, just intensity). 

My pour over is a chemex with the chemex filters. My recipe is a 1:16 ratio. Water temp between 195 - 205. Grind size is medium fine. I do a 45 sec bloom. Make the grounds a pit shape before I pour. Do swirls. I feel like I do everything as I should. Brand new beans. I do not understand. I could go on forever on the amount of variables I change. I am considering just making the water hotter than crap and just see what happens. 

Any tips? I am determined to make that beautiful rich cup. I love this process of figuring it out but I just don‚Äôt get the results. ",1,1750861970.0,pourover,8,1.0,False

My response was mostly positive, at least on paper. Under the additional comments I had made a note about the app that glitched out and white screened.

When I mentioned it out loud to her the rep was unfazed.

‚ÄúWe have already implemented some bug fixes overnight, due to some employees turning in their questionnaires at the end of shift yesterday. The problem might have already been resolved.‚Äù She gave the same plastic grin from yesterday. ‚ÄúWe hope there are no further issues.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúUh. thanks‚Äù I nodded, turning away with a frown pulling at my mouth. Natalie was looking at me from the locker area. As I walked towards her I could see her expression was a bit duller than normal.¬†

‚ÄúMornin‚Äô‚Äù Her voice lacked her usual vigor.

‚ÄúHey, same to you.‚Äù I smiled trying to inject some warmth into the moment. ‚ÄúGood news, I looked up enrollment last night. I even scheduled an appointment to talk to an advisor next week.‚Äù

With a slight smile, she exhaled in tired relief. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great.‚Äù And she meant it, even if something else was weighing down her energy.

‚ÄúYou doing okay?‚Äù It wasn‚Äôt really a question. It was clear she wasn‚Äôt.

She opened her mouth, hesitating.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶I-‚Äú¬†

The buzzer cut her off. We both flinched, instinctively glancing at the clock.

‚ÄúShit,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not at our stations.‚Äù

Natalie gave a quick nod. ‚ÄúLater,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

We peeled off toward our respective stations with the silent understanding that whatever she was going to say. Whatever was really going on, would be addressed at next break.

Until then I tried to keep busy with logic games, and music. But my brain wouldn't work the way I wanted to.

  


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

When I walked into the break room, I spotted her already sitting at a table, sipping a drink from the vending machine. She looked‚Ä¶ better. Not perfect, but clearer than this morning.

‚ÄúYou look more alive,‚Äù I said, grabbing a seat across from her. ‚ÄúThat morning fog wore off?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù she said, with a shrug. ‚ÄúHonestly, I felt like garbage this morning. But once I hooked into the headset... I don‚Äôt know. I must‚Äôve nodded off. Slept until right before the bell for break went off.""

‚ÄúYou what?‚Äù I raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúYou fell asleep?‚Äù

She nodded, totally casual.

‚ÄúHow? Your eyes have to stay open for the sync unit to work properly. That‚Äôs, like, the whole thing.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said, lowering her voice slightly. ‚ÄúBut on 2, apparently... you can.‚Äù

That left me blinking for a second.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre serious?‚Äù

She smiled faintly. ‚ÄúWell, I didn‚Äôt get written up. So either it worked, or a supervisor didn‚Äôt notice. Either way, I‚Äôm not complaining.‚Äù

I leaned back in my chair, a bit worried about how dismissive she was.

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ you do look better.‚Äù I said slowly, ""Guess if you‚Äôre lying, the production logs will snitch on you.‚Äù

She laughed, but the sound was quieter than usual.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt remember anything about sleeping being possible in the paperwork.‚Äù I added.

She gave a shrug. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs not a feature. Maybe it‚Äôs just something the system allows now.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt press the point, but her explanation didn‚Äôt sit right.

‚ÄúSo, what wiped you out?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúDid you stay up too late?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it wasn‚Äôt that,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI kept waking up in the middle of the night. One of those nights where you‚Äôre dreaming so hard you jolt yourself awake.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶Nightmares?‚Äù

She frowned a little. ‚ÄúNot exactly. Just‚Ä¶ intense.‚Äù

The buzzer rang again, louder than before. Or maybe, I was just more on edge.

We stood up, heading towards the door. ‚ÄúYou gonna be okay?‚Äù I asked as we tossed our wrappers.

‚ÄúHopefully.‚Äù She said with a nervous smile.

  


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

Returning to work, I noticed something surprising. Halcyon had an icon now. It was faint, almost translucent. A pale, circular emblem.

I stared at it.

It looks like it was fixed.

Maybe now I could actually see what it was supposed to do. I hovered my gaze on it, hesitating‚Ä¶ I opened it.

The screen blinked once.

Then again.

Then again, faster and faster.

Like a strobe light revving up, or a heartbeat skipping out of sync. Lines of text skidded across the display. Unreadable, Half formed instructions or code, disappearing too fast to make anything out.

And then everything went white.¬†

I felt the pulse again.

I was back. Standing at the same workstation. Components in my hands. Same steady movements of my fingers. Annoyance flickered through me. Not just at the app, but at myself for trying it.

*Had I‚Ä¶?*

No. No, I didn‚Äôt fall asleep. I was just zoning out. I didn‚Äôt feel unconscious. Not really. Just‚Ä¶floaty. Disoriented. My playlist had skipped forward by two songs. I glanced at the product counter. It was ahead by a few dozen units.

How long had I been out? I clenched my jaw. Shook it off.

Okay. Lesson learned.

No more opening it.

The end of shift alarm rang out. Reflexively, everyone began unplugging in unison. A sea of hands rose to the headsets, sliding their wires free. I removed mine slower than usual. My eyes adjusting. Breathing shallow like I was coming out of anesthesia.¬†

I scanned the shop floor for Nat, a bit more sensitive to the light around me. I was developing a migraine. I didn‚Äôt want to wait, I pulled a pair of sunglasses out of my locker and headed out.

The walk home was slow and the heat pressed down on me like a second body. What normally was a 10 minute walk, turned into 20. I drifted past the usual land marks, slowly my shoulders became heavier and my feet dragged across the pavement. The moment I got inside I dropped my keys down, removed my shoes and sweaty socks, and stumbled straight into bed.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

When I woke, the light in the room had shifted, and my head throbbed. A dull, nagging ache that pulsed behind my eyes. I popped a painkiller and chased it with a cold glass of water.

‚ÄúUgh‚Äù I muttered aloud, pressing my palm to my forehead. ‚ÄúThis sucks.‚Äù

I called in sick and stretched out on the couch with a damp washcloth draped across my brow. It felt like a hangover.¬†

A notification ping broke the stillness. I reached for my tablet and saw a message from Nat.

*""You bailed on work? Weak.""*

I smirked, even though my head still felt like it was full of static. My vision shimmered faintly, like the screen was underwater. I blinked, but it didn‚Äôt go away.

*""Yeah. Called in sick. Head‚Äôs killing me. Thought I was gonna pass out on the walk home last night.""*

Another ping.

*""Yikes. You good? You‚Äôre not the only one who called out today.‚Äù*

That made my stomach twist a little.

*""O? What did they say?‚Äù*

*""Something about the refresh rate or light calibration. One of the floor leads said he was gonna file a report if more people drop.""*

I hesitated, then typed:

""*U ok tho? No headache?""*

She didn‚Äôt reply for a few minutes. Then:

*""Felt off earlier. Better now. You up to rally later for some post-shift pancakes?""*

I stared at the screen. My fingers were sluggish, like they didn‚Äôt quite belong to me.

*""Maybe...""*

The tablet slipped out of my hand in the bed. I didn‚Äôt catch it.

And then I drifted off again.¬†

My dreams were vivid and stressful. I was alone on a grey beach, forced to count each grain of sand. When I lost track, something descended . My punishment was disassembly, my body taken apart, each piece sealed into rough metal. I fell endlessly, waiting to hit the ground.

I jolted awake with my heart racing in fear. The pain in my head, however, had passed.

With a long exhale to steady my emotions, I sat up and checked the time. 5:00pm. Nat will be getting out in an hour.

  


‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

By the time I got to the diner, the sun had dipped behind the buildings. I entered the diner and Natalie was already seated in a booth near the back as usual, a mug of coffee slowly steaming on the table.

She looked up as I slid into the seat across from her. ‚ÄúHey, corpse,‚Äù she said with a crooked smile. ‚ÄúYou made it.‚Äù

‚ÄúBarely.‚Äù I took a long drink from the ice water ‚ÄúI think I melted into the sidewalk twice on the way here.‚Äù

‚ÄúUgh, I feel that. Thank god they need to have the shop cool because of the headset hardware.‚Äù We both paused in relief, imagining what a hellhole it would be.

‚ÄúHave you heard anything else? About the headset issues?‚Äù

Natalie shifted in her seat, looking into her mug like it had answers. ‚ÄúNot really. Just‚Ä¶ that a few people complained of headaches. One person said their eyes wouldn‚Äôt track right for a while. The rep shrugged it off mostly. Said it was calibration fatigue.‚Äù

‚ÄúCalibration fatigue.‚Äù I rolled the words around like something bitter.

She shrugged. ‚ÄúTo be honest.. It sounds like something they made up quickly in a meeting to quell us. It's up to corporate how long they want production to be affected.‚Äù

There was a pause. We both stared out the window for a few seconds. The street beyond was quiet and hazy.

I lowered my voice. ‚ÄúI opened one of the apps. One that wasn‚Äôt listed properly.‚Äù

She looked up immediately. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt didn‚Äôt even have a name, really. Just a file name: Halcyon.app. No info, no icon, well‚Ä¶ until yesterday. I made a mistake.‚Äù Admitting it out loud. ‚ÄúEverything was flashing and it white screened. My hands froze. It rebooted, but after that‚Ä¶ at the end of shift‚Ä¶‚Äù

I paused for a moment ‚ÄúI‚Äôve opened it twice now and it doesn‚Äôt work. The representative seemed dismissive about it. I‚Äôm confident it gave me a migraine.‚Äù

Natalie didn‚Äôt speak right away. She tapped her fingernail against the ceramic mug in a slow rhythm. Then:

‚ÄúYeah, I saw it too.‚Äù She said softly.

I blinked. ‚ÄúYou open it?‚Äù

She shook her head. ‚ÄúNo. I hovered over it for a bit. Thought it was just a bugged out listing.‚Äù

I nodded slowly. ‚ÄúEver since yesterday, I feel terrible. I don‚Äôt know. I wanna blame work, but the dreams were intense too.‚Äù

That got her attention. ‚ÄúDreams?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust weird,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHard to explain. But I woke up and couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling.‚Äù

She hesitated, and laughed a little. ‚ÄúMaybe it‚Äôs contagious.‚Äù She looked back down. ‚ÄúWell you know I've been feeling it too. Like, just a little out of sync. I almost tripped on nothing walking to my car.‚Äù

A realization came over me,

‚ÄúAre you sure you didn‚Äôt open halcyon?‚Äù

Her voice was quieter. ‚ÄúNot really‚Ä¶I might have when I fell asleep. I woke up to a white screen in the headset.‚Äù

We both sat with that for a moment. Natalie broke the silence. ‚ÄúMaybe we‚Äôre just fried. New software, long hours, heat wave. That‚Äôs enough to scramble anyone.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶‚Äù I said, though it didn‚Äôt feel like enough.

She pulled her legs up into the booth, wrapping her arms around them. ‚ÄúStill‚Ä¶ maybe don‚Äôt click anything weird for a while. And if you get another dream like that? Tell me. Deal?‚Äù

‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù I managed a smile.

We sat like that for a while longer, sipping coffee as the diner lights buzzed above us and the shadows outside deepened. Neither of us said it out loud, but we both knew something had shifted.

We just weren‚Äôt sure how much it would affect us, yet.

1lk78in,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aging/comments/1lk78in/my_hearing_is_seriously_slipping/,My Hearing Is Seriously Slipping,"Hey Reddit,
I had one of those moments today that really drove home the fact that I'm not as young as I used to be, and neither are my ears. I was at my favourite coffee shop, just trying to order my usual latte, and the barista was talking to me. I swear, he said something and I just... didn't catch it. It wasn't loud music or background chatter; it was just a quiet conversation, and I had to lean in awkwardly and ask him to repeat himself twice. He looked a little annoyed, and I just felt totally mortified.

It's been happening more and more lately. Family dinners are a nightmare of me constantly saying ""What?"" or just nodding along pretending I heard something. Even watching TV, the volume is creeping higher and higher, and my partner is starting to complain. I'm in my late 50s, and I always thought this was something that happened much later in life.

Has anyone else experienced this creeping hearing loss as they've gotten older? What did you do? Any tips for coping, or should I just resign myself to a life of guessing what people are saying?

1lk783r,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideHustleGold/comments/1lk783r/free_remote_business_bootcamp_tomorrow_12pm_est/,üöÄ FREE Remote Business Bootcamp Tomorrow (12PM EST) - Build Your Remote Business From Anywhere in 48 Minutes,"**Tomorrow's the weekly free bootcamp that's helped 70,000+ entrepreneurs launch remote businesses. Perfect for anyone wanting to escape the 9-5 grind.**

What's up r/SideHustleGold?

Tomorrow (Thursday) at 12PM EST is the weekly FREE Remote Business Bootcamp that everyone's been talking about.

**Quick backstory:** This isn't some random webinar. This is the same bootcamp that's helped launch over 70,000 active entrepreneurs and generated $500M+ in revenue. The reviews speak for themselves (4.9/5 stars from 2,000+ people).

**üî• IMPORTANT: This is 100% LIVE content - not some dusty prerecorded webinar from 2019 that everyone else is recycling. Fresh, current, real-time training every single Thursday.**

**Why This Bootcamp Hits Different:**

üéØ **It's Actually Live Every Thursday** \- Not some recycled recording from 2019 like every other ""guru""

üåç **Global Community** \- Join entrepreneurs from 84+ countries

üí∞ **Recurring Revenue Focus** \- Build something that pays you monthly, not just once

**Who Shouldn't Attend:**

‚ùå People looking for get-rich-quick schemes ‚ùå Anyone not willing to put in actual work ‚ùå People who think business success happens overnight

**The Real Talk:**

Look, I know everyone's skeptical about ""free bootcamps"" these days. Fair enough. But when something has 70,000+ active users across 84+ countries and maintains a 4.9/5 star rating, maybe it's worth 48 minutes of your time?

Especially if you're stuck in the analysis paralysis phase of wanting to start something but not knowing what.

**And unlike 99% of the webinars out there, this isn't some prerecorded presentation from 2019 with outdated strategies. This is live, current content delivered fresh every Thursday.**

**Tomorrow: Thursday, June 26th at 12PM EST**

Only 48 minutes. Completely free. Open worldwide.

[**Register for the FREE Bootcamp Here**](https://southjerseyentrepreneur.com/highlevel-bootcamp)

**Questions I expect in the comments:**

* *Is this really free?* Yes, completely free. No credit card required.
* *Will there be a pitch?* There's valuable content plus info about their platform. Make your own decision.
* *Do I need experience?* Nope, designed for beginners.
* *Can I attend from anywhere?* Yes, it's virtual and open worldwide.
* *Is this actually live?* YES - fresh content every Thursday, not recycled garbage.

**Bottom line:** If you've been thinking about starting a remote business but keep putting it off, this might be the kick in the ass you need.

48 minutes tomorrow could change your next 48 months.

**See you there üöÄ**

**P.S.** \- These bootcamps happen every Thursday, but tomorrow's your next chance. Don't be the person who keeps saying ""I'll catch the next one"" for months.

I'm currently at the Cancun airport after staying at Beloved for 4 nights.

We had a really wonderful time and would give it 5 stars without question. 

Highlights: Service was exceptional throughout. Very responsive.  We tipped frequently because we felt it was right, but sometimes forgot or didn't have cash and didn't notice any changes in behavior.  The taco truck and the coffee shop were wonderful for quick food. The taco truck was probably the best food we had all week. We opted to go there each day for lunch.  Resort was very clean. We spent most time on the beach and used the beach snack/drink service.  Minimal seaweed that was picked up by a tractor each day. Did the free included aqua therapy which was a nice treat. Spa was beautiful. Free transfer to and from the airport was flawless and wonderful. We arrived super early and although our room wasn't ready, we got full access to everything so it made us feel like we got to ""steal"" an extra day at the resort for free. 

While I would unequivocally give 5 stars, here's the areas that were a little less than others. Certainly not bad by any means, but areas that maybe could use some improvement.  Dinners were all good, but nothing incredible. We aren't really foodies so it was fine, but the ""fancy"" restuarants didn't match quality to fancy level. Again, we preferred the simple meals and opted to eat at the outdoor Italian place rather than the French or steakhouse options for the ambiance.  The room was very nice, but some of the decor was a little dated. This absolutely didn't matter to us because it was very well taken care of, but it might matter to others. Vibe was very quiet which is what we wanted. Entertainment options were fine, but fine is probably the best word for it. 

Other random thing: everything was on an app which was fine, but felt a little weird going to a ""fancy restuarant"" and then staring at our phone.  Some of the drink menus were confusing. Restuarants wouldn't have them but servers couldn't really tell you what was available. No list of what liquors were available.  Other people seemed to figure it out but as a first time AI I was a little confused for the first few days about what was possible!

Would highly recommend for anyone looking for a quiet getaway for a couple. Happy to answer any questions!",10,1750861730.0,AllInclusiveResorts,4,0.86,False

The issue is that it's killing me in the morning to wait to drink my coffee. I'm a sipper so I can't just chug it either. I'm also not the person who opens their eyes and is like, ""give me coffee now."" Usually I want it a couple of hours into the morning. The coffee I drink has fairlife milk so it does have some carbs. 

I'm often tempted to just test at an hour and a half and if it's below 120, have my coffee. But I don't know if that's wrong or bad. Does anyone have thoughts?

1lk74ng,https://i.redd.it/ypq925ne239f1.jpeg,2.5 Day Texas Road Trip (San Antonio + Houston) [Steel Eel],"I just returned from my first coaster trip to Texas. This was the first time in a while that I had gotten a bunch of new credits and new parks in one trip, including several bucket list rides. It was a huge success overall.  
  
*Day 1:*

  
I flew into Houston from Philly on Sunday 6/22 and arrived at 9:00 AM. I got maybe an hour of sleep between being too excited to sleep the night before + having trouble sleeping on planes. The early arrival gave me the perfect amount of time to grab a quick breakfast and copious caffeine before getting to my first park for opening.  
  
ZDT's Amusement Park:

  
I showed up 10 min after opening and was one of maybe 11 guests on the premises. It was already really hot out. Unfortunately I don't have much time during the school year to travel on a weekend, and it just worked out that I couldn't get to Texas til sweltering hot June. Anyway, I walked in and got the Switchback-only pass and headed over to get some rides in.  
  
**Switchback**¬†3x - I had an excellent first ride towards the back. Awesome first drop and great airtime throughout the ride. The backwards bit was cool, but I knew immediately that I couldn't ride it too much without getting nauseous. Sure enough, I felt it already right after my 2nd ride in the front. I wanted to power through but only managed to do one more. I overall loved going forwards and was dying for it to end while going in reverse. Super good ride, a lot of fun, not the best ride for me. I hit the road after only 20 min at the park.  
  
I continued west and stopped downtown to get some vegan carne asada tacos, which were insanely good. If you're vegetarian like me, San Antonio is not ideal. I should have just eaten every meal at Plantaqueria. Next time.. Continued west to the next stop.  
  
Six Flags Fiesta Texas:

  
The main event of the trip. I arrived at 2:15 PM and aimed to knock out all 11 credits as quickly as possible. It was a great little park visit. Here's what I did in order:  
  
**Poltergeist**¬†\- So cool to see a themed queue like this at a SF park. The ride ran really well, prob the best Premier spaghetti bowl out of the 4.  
  
**Wonder Woman Golden Lasso Coaster**¬†2x - I only got one ride on Railblazer when I went to CGA last year. It was a front row ride at the start of a mild day, so it wasn't as out of control as expected. WoWoGoLaCo on a scorching afternoon, however, was insane. I never experienced this type of insanity on a single rail. The ride is a total burst of energy. I got a ride towards the front and another one later on in the middle. Both experiences were excellent.  
  
**Batman The Ride**  
  
**Batgirl**  
  
**Superman Krypton Coaster**¬†\- What a cool ride layout and setting. The whole park has a beautiful setting, but the swooping and floaty elements on this combined w/ the placement along the quarry walls make for such a fun and unique experience. This is my fav floorless now.  
  
**Dr. Diabolical's Cliffhanger**¬†\- Really fun preshow, but the preshow might have been my fav part. Rode back row edge. Not my fav dive coaster. My first impression was that it was about as fun as Iron Menace. Great first drop, and I appreciate a midcourse on a dive because I like the drop off of it. Will talk more about it for day 2.  
  
**Iron Rattler**¬†2x - This f'ing ride. I had my expectations set so that this would be a decent RMC. I didn't really look up the layout, I just knew the first drop would be bonkers. The first drop was indeed bonkers, and overall the ride exceeded expectations. I got two rides in a row towards the back. I had a total blast from start to finish. The rise into the final brakes is one of the most demented moments on an RMC.  
  
**Road Runner**¬†\- I probably should have given this more than one ride overall. It was fun but children screaming loudly in my ear was a downer. Not as fun as my hometown Runaway Mine Train but it's a cool and forceful one.  
  
**Boomerang**  
  
**Pandemonium**¬†\- 2 trains, long long line. Ride closed due to winds, 45+ min line clears out, ride reopens 30 seconds later, 5 min line. Happy I didn't wait any longer. This was actually credit 450 woo. Got my 2nd ride on Wonder Woman before heading towards the gate.  
  
**Chupacabra**  
  
By this point, it was about 6:30 PM. I put in great work for a summer weekend night, 13 rides in a littler more than 4 hours was a huge success. I stopped for an emergency Taco Cabana burrito (bad) en route to the next stop.  
  
Seaworld San Antonio:

  
I decided to push for credit completion among both parks on the first day so I could relax the following day and just reride the good ones. I walked into the park at around 7:15 PM, with a little less than 2 hours to do what I could.  
  
**Journey To Atlantis**  
  
**Texas Stingray**¬†2x - Holy \*\*\*\*. WAY more intense and forceful than I expected. My fav GCI was Prowler, which I liked for it's fun and varied layout and legendary night rides. This doesn't have the same pitch black night ride, but this ride absolutely hauled on my first ride. I got the best airtime I'd ever gotten on a GCI. I rode row 11 on my first ride. This is one of those rides that gains intensity as it goes, ending with an amazing tunnel and bunny hop sequence. The first few elements are also spectacular. It's pretty great from start to finish. I got two rides, the first one was epic.  
  
**Great White**  
  
**Steel Eel**¬†\- Remember when Pandemonium went down for wind? Welp, Steel Eel was immobile at 8:15 PM. I had seen it cycle maybe once or twice since getting there and thought I'd be good. I waited around for almost a half hour before heading back to Texas Stingray for my 2nd ride. Of course, I see Steel Eel cycling as soon as I hit the brake run. I hopped out and legit ran back to Steel Eel and made it in time for one of the last rides of the night. I rode towards the back. I had a great ride, love a Morgan Hyper.  
  
I sadly missed out on Wave Breaker (extended downtime) and Beach Rescue (missed it by like 5 min). All in all, I almost rode everything in Seguin and San Antonio in one day going on 1 hour of sleep. I was super satisfied. I went to my AirBNB and immediately passed out.  
  
  
*Day 2*

  
Monday 6/23, I woke up and found myself some coffee and a small breakfast before headed right back to...  
  
Seaworld San Antoino:

  
I arrived 30 min after opening. I only had one credit left to get so I wasted no time, whether that was a smart move or not...  
  
**Beach Rescue Racer**¬†\- Really fun and forceful for a family ride. The ops and throughput were atrocious. Try to not ride this when it has a line if you can avoid it. 45 min wait¬†  
  
**Steel Eel**¬†4x - I got to really appreciate this thing after getting some more rides on it. I had heard legends about the ass smacking nature of this ride. This held true for most of the ride in row 18. I just preemptively braced myself for pain on most hills but I probably would've been fine without doing that. This thing reminds me of a mix of Mamba and La Ronde Goliath. It has a ton of power for such a small ride. It's really a great time and something I could ride all day.  
  
**Catapult Falls**¬†\- Really fun flume! Def not a coaster. If the bunny hill after the drop weren't trimmed it'd be a top tier flume.  
  
**Texas Stingray**¬†3x - Got to ride towards the front. This ride really shines up there. It's decidedly my fav GCI now, above Prowler and Gold Striker. I need to get rerides on Mystic (it's been since 2022) and I've never done Thunderhead. For now, though, it's a really well rounded ride with awesome forces and a great and fulfilling layout.  
  
I overall had a much better impression of the park than I expected. I am not the biggest fan of Seaworld Orlando. The whole environment of being in Florida, hearing generic inspirational cinematic music, not good food, only one elite ride, etc. I'd heard how this is not a nice park, but I actually had a great time. The lack of shade is rough, but if you go in and treat it like a beach day and just wear a ton of sunscreen and dress light, you can make the most of it. The park is nice and clean. There aren't a ton of rides but the rides that are there are solid and the park layout makes sense. The top 2 coasters are rides that complement both each other and the rides at SFFT really well. I had a great time. After a quick 2 hours, I left to get some chilaquiles and head back to...  
  
Six Flags Fiesta Texas:

  
This would be a super chill day 2 at the park. I was really looking forward to reriding all of my favs from the day before as well as a few non-coasters that I wanted to check out. The big miss for the day was Wonder Woman, which was only running one train. In fact, the 2nd train from the day before was disassembled in a field next to the queue. The other trains were nowhere to be seen. I at least got 2 rides on it the day before.  
  
**Dr. Diabolical's Cliffhanger**¬†\- A redemptive ride for sure. I rode in the middle row on an edge seat and had a much smoother ride. I also felt more forces during the 2nd half. I'm happy I gave this thing a 2nd chance, it's something I'd ride every visit.  
  
**Superman Krypton**  
  
**Train**  
  
**Pirates of the Deep Sea**  
  
**Bugs Log Flume**  
  
**Iron Rattler**¬†6x - I got rides all over the train, but the front really blew me away. Every element, even up on top of the quarry wall, flung me out of my seat. From start to finish, there were no parts of this that I didn't enjoy. It has such a cool layout. The first 3rd reminds me of Gwazi with it's fast drawn out turns. The top of the quarry wall reminds me of something like Wicked Cyclone with all of the off-axis fun stuff. The last 3rd is unlike any RMC with the drop, tunnel, and rise into the brakes. It's among the most unique of roller coasters I've ever ridden, which takes a great ride and makes it elite. It's my 5th fav RMC, a top tier RMC among the ranks of Twisted Timbers and Wildcat's.  
  
I said goodbye to the park after this. I love it here. It's a special park that feels really different from the other Six Flags parks. I've always had a soft spot for Six Flags in general. Great Adventure was my main park growing up and I still consider it my most home of parks. I don't need too many bells and whistles when it comes to a regional park. IMO, SFFT doesn't have that many bells and whistles, but it executes everything really well. Everything is so obviously well taken care of, and nothing there feels neglected (besides Kid Flash lol). I can only imagine if Great Adventure had no neglected sections of the park. The ride lineup is good, but I wouldn't spend more than a day max here again. I'd probably just do 1/2 days at both parks if I came back and ride my favs.  
  
I left the park, went to a dive bar, ate pizza, walked the river walk, saw the alamo, went to bed.  
  
  
*Day 3*

  
I woke up bright and early and drove east. I had to stop along the way at Buc-ee's, which was my first ever time. There isn't much hot food I can eat that's vegetarian, but the potato-bean- cheese taco was ridiculous. I would go and just eat that every time. Anyway, I had a few hours to spend in the area before my flight back at 6:00 PM. I originally planned on going to just one place before the airport, but I went early enough to hit two places.  
  
Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier:

  
I got here right after opening. The vibe of this place is really cool. It feels like a Jersey Shore park 100%, besides the 6 lane road outside of the entrance. I went right over to...  
  
**Iron Shark**¬†\- Awesome first drop, amazing view. The ride got exponentially worse as it progressed, including one of the worst headbangs I've gotten on any ride when I went into the final brakes. Straight up thought I got concussed after slamming my head into the headrest. Ow, not good, overall the ride was fine.  
  
One ride and done, time to head north  
  
Kemah Boardwalk:  
I showed up at around 1:15 I think? I had about 1.5 hours there. I had a legit headache from Iron Shark so I felt limited, not to mention all of the stuff I had done the lat two days. I decided I'd base how many rides I'd go for on how much fun I had on the first ride.  
  
**Boardwalk Bullet**¬†3x - First ride was a little bit of a let down tbh. I rode in the back row. First drop was spectacular, some moments were really fun, the last half kind of crawled and didn't have much force. I had heard that this happened during the day. Anyway, I tried again up front and had a much better ride (except they decided I couldn't wear glasses even if I had a strap for some reason, which is absolutely insane to me but whatever"". Luckily I not blind, but it didn't help with the headache I was feeling. It was definitely better up front, but I needed to get some more food in me. I got a quick snack at Starbucks and went back for another ride in row 2. This was my best ride for sure. The layout is a blast. It's so disorienting when you focus on where you're going and let the forces catch you off guard. I'm so happy I got a really great ride on it with a bunch of airtime and forces. I don't think that it lived up to the hype that I had heard others give it, but it didn't disappoint.  
  
I was worn out but also needed to get back to the airport. It all timed out perfectly.

  
  
Closing Thoughts

  
I think that the folks in San Antonio are lucky to have Seaworld and SFFT. They're both well taken care of and have really complete complementary coaster lineups when combined. I'd be okay not revisiting the smaller parks for a bit, but one day I'd like to get to Kemah for night rides. I had an excellent time overall, and it was great to get a new ride in my top 25 (Iron Rattler). Stingray was really close, but I think I'm putting it at 26. Boardwalk Bullet, Wonder Woman, Steel Eel, and Krypton all make the top 100 as well. It was such a successful trip in terms of getting on everything and getting a great amount of total rides, 40 something total rides in 2.5 days. Idk when I'll be back in San Antonio, maybe after COTALand opens, but SFOT and Frontier City are priorities for me over a San Antonio revisit.",14,1750861600.0,rollercoasters,0,1.0,False

I'm a 46 yo female and I've lost 95 pounds in roughly two years. I still have 50 to go and I'm struggling because of the slowness and being almost ravenously hungry at night. 
 
I just bumped my calories up to 1750 from 1550 because I don't think I was eating enough. I'm currently 207 pounds and 5'5"". I eat pretty clean - most days for breakfast and lunch I have a giant smoothie with greek yogurt, almond milk, oats, raspberris, apples, passion fruit, pineapple, pumpkin seeds and 1T peanut butter. For dinner I have either salmon, squid or shrimp and couscous with some feta. That comes out to 150 grams of protein, 175 grams of carbs, 56 grams of fat and 20 grams of fiber. I power walk for 25 minutes per day, don't drink alcohol, lots of water, sleep 9 hours a night and two cups of black coffee. 

My weight loss has slowed to about 3 pounds a month and I am beyond hungry. What do I need to change? More fiber? More carbs? Less protein? Veggies? I think I'm going to start lifting weights but I'm afraid that will make me hungrier and will slow my weight loss even more since muscle weighs more than fat.

- We did not ride dragon racers rally or fyre drill
- Express is so worth it at epic. Giving enough time to eat/ chill and still ride everything. 

RIDE RANKINGS
1. Stardust racers - no amount of nostalgia from any of the other universes could overcome how amazing this ride is
2. Hiccup‚Äôs Wing Gliders - loved HTTYD as a good, very nostalgic and an amazing coaster
3. Monster‚Äôs Unchained - amazing
4. Harry Potter and battle at the ministry - people love this ride and, as a HP lover, I was underwhelmed w the ride itself. The queue was incredible. The ride was still really cool
5. Curse of the werewolf- people hating on this ride, idk why. It was sneaky good. Just short
6. Mario Kart - really cool concept 
7. Mine cart madness - I might get hate here, but this ride was simply unenjoyable for me. It is the roughest coaster in the parks (except for maybe the hulk) and it made it hard to enjoy the scenery of the ride
8. Yoshi‚Äôs adventure / constellation carousel - nothing wrong with them, yoshis is cool to look at Nintendo world and carousel is actually very neat

1lk70le,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1lk70le/there_is_money_in_the_coffee_business_heres_what/,There *is* money in the coffee business - here's what our Coffee Business Owner Compensation Survey results showed for cafe and roastery owners,"Hello, inspired by this recent post - [There is no money in the coffee business.](https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1ljs2wh/there_is_no_money_in_the_coffee_business/) \- we thought we'd layer a bit of real-world data on coffee business owner compensation into the discussion. 

**There is money in coffee**, but it's a difficult business to be in, without a doubt. Low revenues, high competition -- it's not a mystery why so many coffee shops close within 2-3 years.

Fresh Cup is a B2B coffee industry publisher. In 2023 we ran a survey with 150+ business owners in the USA asking about their financial situation and take home pay. We ended up with some fascinating results, including:

>‚≠ê The average coffee shop owner earned $48,234 annually

>‚≠ê¬†Coffee roasting company owners averaged $53,374 annually

>‚≠ê¬†The highest earners ($100K+) shared three commonalities: they owned slightly older businesses; operated multiple locations; and reported spending significantly more time working on growth, development, and strategic planning than day-to-day operations. 

>‚≠ê We found surprising commonalities between owners: many reported that despite the strife (and debt) involved in opening a business, the effort was worth it.

There's a lot more data on the relationship between business age, number of locations, etc in our [three reports on the survey results](https://freshcup.com/survey-results-the-2023-coffee-business-owner-salary-report/).

We're actually in the middle of running the Coffee Business Owner Compensation Survey *again* for 2025, so if you run a coffee business in the USA, we'd love for you to participate in this year's go-round - [details here](https://freshcup.com/take-the-2025-coffee-business-owner-compensation-survey/).

-The elevators were speedy and automated.

-Our cabin was roomy, it was the nicest feature of the boat for me.

-The cola machines did not work or were out of soda; you can get cans from any bar, but it was indicative of an overall lack of quality control on the boat.

‚ÄîThe food was nothing memorable. The Mexican place made Taco Bell seem like fine cuisine, and the grab and go stuff was cheap, tasteless food‚Ä¶

‚ÄîThe bars and bar areas were often untidy.

‚ÄîSo many things were not included and they wanted money‚Äîeven an air hockey game!

‚ÄîThere was no consistency of drinks from bar to bar.

‚ÄîPizza from room service was embarrassingly low quality‚Äîlike the cheapest frozen stuff you buy because you cannot afford anything more!

‚ÄîThe smoking section was between two pool areas, could have been better located.

‚ÄîServers came by once in a blue moon, then took another twenty minutes to return. Just go to the bar.

‚ÄîThe towel stations were not open in early morning, very inconvenient for early risers!

‚ÄîCoffee was not great, either a low grade brand or lack of cleaning‚Ä¶are they forcing me to go to the not included Starbucks? It didn‚Äôt work.

‚ÄîThe app was limited. Could not easily find information, had to scroll around‚Ä¶.

‚ÄîWould have loved a paper map of the boat, it was hard to get oriented, especially the first day.

‚ÄîSaw a ‚Äúcountry‚Äù band that was not great.  

‚ÄîIt was a weekend cruise, so lots of loud party music. We found it hard overall to find chiller spots‚Ä¶

‚ÄîThere is a cool walking loop on deck 4 (I think)‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a great way to experience the vessel.  (But good luck trying to make sense of the distance ‚Äîit is posted sparingly and the floor markings are useless )..
