Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.

An appropriate approach may be a combination of:

Plato (cave metaphor)

Leibniz (monads/units of consciousness)

Spinoza (substance monism)

Bohm (holographic universe)

Pribram (holographic brain)

Koestler (holons)

Tom Campbell (virtual reality/units of consciousness)

The holons (Koestler) may provide the link between physics and personality/identity. They may be what Seth coined the \`gestalts´.

\------------

Seth differentiates between units of consciousness (CUs) and electromagnetic energy units (EEUs). Every gestalt, i.e. ANY gestalt is a conglomerate of CUs in non-physical reality. These CUs \`come together´ to form physical matter - as EEUs -  in \`our reality´. When they form physical matter as EEUs they operate as particles. When they operate in non-physical reality, they operate as waves, possessing wave characteristics. The CUs are the tiniest building blocks. They are infinitesimal small, but each one is endowed with the full creative power of All-that-is. They are transformed into EEUs once they physicalize/are physicalized. From the moment of physicalization/particle-ization on they begin producing subatomic particles (upwards). Thus, everything is made of CUs/EEUs, non-physical and in wave-form outside of our physicality (CUs), and as particles and EEUs in 3d. We all exist as interconnected wave forms outside of physical reality made up of CUs, and we exist as a conglomerate of EEUs in particle-ized form inside physical reality. After death we continue to exist as a gestalt, but we exist as a wave form. CUs form gestalts. Once a gestalt is formed (particle, atom, molecule, cell, organ, being, etc. it never ever vanishes. And it can never become less that it once was (Seth). A gestalt, once formed, never ceases to exist.",1,1743861723.0,freewill,0,1.0,False

i (19f) have never dated. i have an overbearing mother who rarely let me out of the house when i was younger and general anxiety around public places/people. all of my friendships and even possible romantic relationships have always been manipulative and end with me getting even more reluctant to meet other people because i always seem to be taken advantage of in some way. i’ve also only in the last year and a half found a good therapist and made really good progress on myself.

recently i met this really really sweet guy (20m) who i can relate to a lot and who shares a lot of the same problems that i do. he is probably the most supportive person i’ve ever met.

we’ve only gone on one official date. it lasted almost 9 hours. we just talked and drove around town all day, going to get coffee and food and the park to just hang out in the nice weather. he told me all about his past and i told him all about mine. we told each other what we enjoyed and what we didn’t. it felt so amazing to talk to someone who’s gone through just as much as i have.

i’m scared though. i’ve been worried since then that he’s been lying to me this whole time about things.

i know it’s too early for me to be so worried. but i’m also very hesitant about men. i do *not* want to fall for him and then find out he’s trying to take advantage of me in some way.

he’s only had one girlfriend before me. it wasn’t a good relationship for him. i don’t want to be bad for him, and i don’t want him to be bad for me either. i really like him. i want to trust him. he told me several times on our date that he wouldn’t hurt me and that he wanted to do anything he could to make me comfortable. he was very respectful of the boundaries i set. he seemed very conscientious of how comfortable/uncomfortable i was at any given time. he even let me take a picture of his license plate because i was anxious about getting in his car for the first time.

he seems like a really good person so far, but it seems too good to be true. can anyone who’s dated in the past or is currently dating give me advice on how to know if i’m safe with him and how to feel more comfortable with a new person?",1,1743861357.0,BPD,0,1.0,False

The man screamed through the gag, but it was muffled. Desperate. Almost quiet now.

The masked figure didn’t flinch. He stood calm, still, like he’d done this before—and he had. Twice this month alone.

The ropes creaked as the victim struggled against the chair, metal scraping softly on the concrete floor. A dim bulb swung above them, casting twitching shadows along the blood-slicked walls. The masked man leaned in, face unreadable behind cracked leather and stitched cloth. The knife in his hand gleamed, not clean—never clean—but polished by repetition.

“You’re not special,” the killer whispered. “You just made the list.”

There was one last sound—the wet, short kind that makes your stomach knot—and then only silence. A third corpse in thirty days. Dipric was keeping secrets again.

Perfect—this page will deepen the mood, give the reader insight into the town’s collective trauma, and build suspense around the murders. Here's page two:



Chapter Two — Ghosts Don’t Bleed

Dipric wasn’t a town used to violence. Not like this.

People were used to loss, sure—everyone lost someone in the war. A son, a father, a home, a limb. But the war had been elsewhere. Distant, impersonal, a thunder in the sky that came and went. The town bled then, yes, but it bled quietly. Together. With dignity.

This was different. This was evil. And it was local.

What terrified people the most wasn’t just the deaths—it was who had died.

All three men were ordinary. One was a baker. Another, a train station clerk. The last had volunteered at the town library. None of them had criminal records. None had enemies. And yet each had been found brutally tortured and executed like war criminals.

It made no sense. And in a town like Dipric, where people waved to each other from across the street and helped fix broken fences without asking, senselessness was the sharpest blade.

Some whispered about revenge. That maybe the war hadn’t left everyone behind. That maybe someone had come back broken, burned from the inside out, and was making a list.

Others—more superstitious—said the dead had returned. That these murders were penance. That ghosts were walking among them, avenging wrongs buried beneath years of silence.

It didn’t help that nobody really trusted anyone anymore.

Dipric was trying to heal. You could see it in the way people planted flowers again. In the new paint over bomb-blasted buildings. In the way kids ran in the streets without ducking at loud noises. But the cracks were there—just beneath the surface. Everyone knew it. Everyone felt it.

So the suspect list was short. Not because they had good leads.

Because it just couldn’t be one of them.

Not after all they’d survived together.

But someone was doing it.

And Ira Vane, whether he liked it or not, was about to tear this town open to find out who.


.
Got it. This page will capture the heavy winter atmosphere, the weight of trauma, and Ira Vane’s sharp mind cutting through assumptions. Here’s page four:




Chapter Four — Winter and Whispers

Snow crunched beneath the sheriff’s boots as he approached the cottage. His breath came out in thick clouds, curling in the cold like secrets that didn’t want to be spoken.

The house looked abandoned from the outside—shutters half-closed, chimney dead, frost crawling up the windows like old fingers. But then the door opened.

Ira Vane stood in the doorway, coat draped loosely over his frame, scarf wrapped tight, cane in hand. His eyes—grey and sunken—held the sheriff like a rifle scope. Sharp. Steady. Cold.

“Three men,” the sheriff began, voice muffled by his scarf. “Dead. All the same way.”

Vane stepped aside, wordless, and let him in.

Inside was warm, barely. A fire smoldered, not out of comfort, but necessity. The room smelled of tobacco, ink, and something unspoken—like damp soil at night.

“Where?” Vane asked.

“Different sides of town. But all vanished the same way—coming back home after late shifts. No one saw them. No witnesses, no noise. Just… gone.”

Vane lowered himself into a creaking armchair. “Winter helps,” he muttered. “People don’t look out their windows when it’s cold. Streets are empty by six. Easier to make a man disappear in the quiet.”

The sheriff nodded, hesitated, then said what everyone was whispering.

“You think this is someone from outside? Maybe a drifter? Someone still… carrying the war?”

Vane’s gaze sharpened. He leaned forward, elbows on knees.

“No.”

“Why not?”

“Because if this was war-related, if it was personal… I’d be dead first. Not some baker. Not a clerk.”

The room fell into a heavy silence. Even the fire seemed to pause.

“They were taken quietly,” Vane continued. “No signs of struggle. That means familiarity. Or trust. Or both. Whoever did this didn’t just kill. They stalked. They watched. They waited.”

“God,” the sheriff whispered, rubbing his face. “And no one saw anything.”

“They wouldn’t,” Vane said. “Not in this weather. Not when the cold already makes people afraid to leave their beds.”

He stood slowly, the cane tapping once on the wooden floor. Snow fell silently outside.

“This isn’t some outsider passing through. It’s not revenge. This…” he glanced at the frost-covered window, “this is homegrown.”





Perfect tension point. Vane’s refusal, grounded in the fragile peace he’s built, and the sheriff’s brutal honesty will create a powerful moment. Here’s page five:


---

Chapter Five — The One Thing Left

“I’m not getting involved,” Vane said, flatly.

The sheriff blinked, caught off guard. “What?”

“I said no.” Vane stood, walked to the window, and stared into the endless white outside. “I’ve seen enough death. Spilled enough blood that my hands don’t know how to be clean anymore. Dipric gave me a second chance. I’m not throwing that away.”

The fire cracked once behind him, a soft reminder of warmth in a conversation that was turning cold.

The sheriff rose, hands clenched at his sides. “We don’t have anyone else. You know that. We’re blind in a burning house.”

“You’ve got good men.”

“I’ve got scared men,” he snapped. “And people are locking their doors before sundown. Kids won’t go to school. Shopkeepers are carrying knives. And we’re one more body away from panic.”

Vane said nothing. He just kept staring out at the snow.

The sheriff’s voice softened. “I know what you lost, Ira. I know what it took for you to come back here and try to be a person again.”

Vane turned slightly, enough for the sheriff to see the tight line of his jaw.

“I’m not asking you to be a soldier,” he continued. “I’m asking you to be a husband.”

That stopped him.

The sheriff let the words hang. Then:

“Elena could be next.”

Vane closed his eyes.

For a moment, the only sound was the wind scratching at the windowpanes.

Then, quietly—like something inside him broke loose and whispered through his bones—he said:

“Tell me everything.”


Love it. That’s a great escalation—the war-broken town, a reluctant genius pulled back into the game, and now a taunt from a killer who sees murder as art. Here's page six:


---

Chapter Six — A Message in the Blood

“Any suspects?” Vane asked as they trudged through the snow, footsteps muffled by the frost-covered earth.

The sheriff pulled his coat tighter, shaking his head. “No one serious. Petty thieves. Men who scream at walls. Folks who broke under the war. They steal bread, not lives.”

“They don’t tie people to chairs and carve into them,” Vane muttered.

The house loomed ahead—a small shack near the lumberyard, forgotten by most, now infamous in silence.

“Third murder,” the sheriff said, unlocking the door. “Same style. No fingerprints. No forced entry. Victim was last seen walking home around eight. Body found next morning. No screams. No signs of a struggle.”

Vane stepped inside. The air was cold and stale, like it hadn’t breathed since the murder.

He walked slowly, eyes scanning everything: the uneven scuff marks on the floor, the overturned chair, the blood—dark and deliberate, painted across the wall and pooling under the victim’s feet.

The man’s body was still there, slumped and frozen, tied to the chair like a grotesque marionette.

Vane crouched, inspecting the bindings.

“Tied clean. No panic in the knots. Either he trusted the killer or was taken before he could resist.”

He stood and turned to the sheriff.

“This isn’t desperation. This isn’t madness.”

“What is it then?”

Vane looked at the body again, then the wall behind it—pausing.

There, etched faintly in blood-stained charcoal above the corpse, were four words:

Catch me if you dare.

Vane stared at them. For a long moment, he said nothing.

Then he whispered, almost to himself:

“This isn’t murder.”

The sheriff furrowed his brow. “What then?”

Vane turned, eyes colder than the snow outside.

“This is art.”


Nice—adds a layer of horror: the randomness makes it more terrifying, like death is stalking the silence itself. Here's page seven:


---

Chapter Seven — The Patternless Pattern

They stood in silence, both staring at the wall.

Then Vane stepped back, eyes scanning the room again—but this time with something colder in his gaze. Calculation.

“No connection between victims?” he asked.

“None. First was a school janitor. Second, a retired soldier. This one’s a blacksmith’s apprentice. They didn’t even live near each other.”

“No debts? No feuds? No one shared anything personal with the others?”

The sheriff shook his head. “We checked. Their lives barely overlapped. Different age groups, different circles.”

Vane’s brow furrowed. “Then the pattern is that there is no pattern.”

He stepped toward the door, opened it slightly, letting the winter air spill in.

“The killer isn’t choosing them. He’s finding them.”

The sheriff’s face paled slightly. “What are you saying?”

Vane didn’t take his eyes off the snow-covered street outside. “I’m saying… they died because they were outside. Because they were alone. Because he stumbled on them.”

The words sat like a weight between them.

“No planning. No surveillance. Just… opportunity.”

“Like a hunter,” the sheriff said, swallowing. “Waiting in the woods.”

“No,” Vane muttered. “Like a wolf. In the snow. Hungry for something that has nothing to do with the victim… and everything to do with the thrill.”

He turned back to the sheriff, voice low.

“The message wasn’t just for me. It was for the whole town.”

Catch me if you dare.


---

That’s beautifully layered—adds emotional weight, contrast between tenderness and dread. Here's page eight:


---

Chapter Eight — Wolves in the Snow

Vane lit a cigarette with shaky hands.

“I have a plan,” he said.

The sheriff looked up, hopeful. “What is it?”

“We bait him.”

The sheriff raised an eyebrow.

“We send someone out alone. Someone the town won’t question. We let him think it’s just another lonely soul wandering the snow… and when he moves in—we’re there. Waiting.”

The room went silent. Even the floorboards seemed to listen.

“You mean use one of my men as live bait?” the sheriff said.

Vane didn’t answer immediately.

“It’s dangerous,” he admitted. “And it’s a last resort. But it might be the only way to catch him red-handed. He’s too careful otherwise. We wait for him to slip… or we make him slip.”

The sheriff rubbed his temples. “That’s suicide.”

“That’s war,” Vane replied, his voice like frost.

They left the scene without another word, heads heavy, boots crunching in snow that no longer felt innocent.



Perfect tension—adds a subtle layer of mystery, maybe even foreshadowing that something’s already wrong with him. Here's the next page:

Chapter Nine — Echoes in the Steam

Morning light slipped through the frosted window, casting a soft glow on the old wooden kitchen walls. The smell of burnt toast lingered in the air, but the coffee was perfect — as always.

Elena placed the mug gently on the table beside him, watching him with concern hidden behind a tired smile.

“Another nightmare?” she asked, sitting across from him, hair still tousled from sleep.

Vane took the mug, nodded, but didn’t look up. “Only the fifth one this month.”

“That’s not nothing, Ira.”

He finally met her gaze. The warmth of the fire crackled behind him, but his eyes looked cold—distant.

“You wake up early on those days,” she added, stirring her own coffee absentmindedly. “Sit at the desk. Write things down.”

“I try to remember them,” he said, voice low.

“But the pages are always blank.”

She said it like she was afraid of the answer.

He didn’t respond.

“I think we need to go to the city,” she said. “See someone. These dreams are changing you. You’re… quieter. Distant. You watch shadows more than people.”

“If it happens again,” he said firmly, “we will.”

Elena studied him, searching his face like it might offer more honesty than his words.

“You promise?”

He took a slow sip. “Yeah.”

But even as he said it, he wasn’t sure who he was trying to convince.

That night, their breaths mingled in the warmth of their room, bare skin against skin beneath the quilt. Outside, the wind howled. But in here, it was just them — hearts racing for reasons neither snow nor murder could touch.

Elena moved slowly on top of him, her body lithe in the dim candlelight, a silhouette of trust, of desire. Her eyes were closed, lips parted with soft gasps, head tilted back as she gave herself over to the moment.

Vane’s hands held her hips, trembling — not from the cold.

But she didn’t see it at first.

Not until her eyes opened, catching the tension in his jaw, the faraway look behind his gaze, even as he moved with her.

She paused slightly, panting. “You’re somewhere else again,” she whispered, her breath shaky but warm.

His throat tightened. “I’m afraid, Lena.”

She leaned forward, hands pressing on his chest, her eyes now searching his. “Of what?”

“That this peace… you, this life we’ve built… it’ll be torn away. That something's coming.”

Her face softened. She kissed him—slow and deep, then pulled back just enough to let him see her as she said it.

“Ira, I have no fear,” she breathed, voice husky, “because I have you.”

She held his face between her hands, her body still moving in rhythm, slower now, more intimate.

“You just have to trust yourself again,” she whispered, her moan rising, eyes never leaving his.

And in that moment, lost in her voice, her warmth, and the sacred hush of snow beyond the window, Vane allowed himself to believe… just for a moment… that maybe, just maybe, he could win.

Sure! Here's the full scene formatted cleanly for easy copying:

Scene: Morning After the Nightmare

Morning light slipped through the frosted window, casting a soft glow on the old wooden kitchen walls. The smell of burnt toast lingered in the air, but the coffee was perfect — as always.

Elena placed the mug gently on the table beside him, watching him with concern hidden behind a tired smile.

“Another nightmare?” she asked, sitting across from him, hair still tousled from sleep.

Vane took the mug, nodded, but didn’t look up. “Only the fifth one this month.”

“That’s not nothing, Ira.”

He finally met her gaze. The warmth of the fire crackled behind him, but his eyes looked cold—distant.

“You wake up early on those days,” she added, stirring her own coffee absentmindedly. “Sit at the desk. Write things down.”

“I try to remember them,” he said, voice low.

“But the pages are always blank.”

She said it like she was afraid of the answer.

He didn’t respond.

“I think we need to go to the city,” she said. “See someone. These dreams are changing you. You’re… quieter. Distant. You watch shadows more than people.”

“If it happens again,” he said firmly, “we will.”

Elena studied him, searching his face like it might offer more honesty than his words.

“You promise?”

He took a slow sip. “Yeah.”

But even as he said it, he wasn’t sure who he was trying to convince.






Vane stood up from the table, running a hand through his messy hair, still shirtless.

As he turned to grab his coat from the chair, Elena called after him, smirking.

“Put some clothes on, will you? The sheriff’s coming over and his old ass doesn’t need a morning show.”

Vane chuckled, halfway into his shirt. “That man’s seen more horror than me, but one chest hair and he turns into a Victorian widow.”

Just then, there was a knock at the door — heavy and impatient.

“Told you,” she said, sipping her coffee with a smug grin.

Vane opened the door. Sheriff Mallory stood there, bundled up in two coats and a scarf that looked more like a blanket. His face was red from the cold, but his eyes were sharp, tired.

“You look like hell,” the sheriff said as greeting.

“You’re the one who knocked like you were trying to arrest my door.”

“Didn’t come for small talk.” The sheriff stepped in, shaking off snow. “I combed through the first and third crime scenes again. Nothing. No fibers, no boot prints. No blood trail. Hell, it’s like the bastard floats.”

Vane leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed. “You said there were two more sites?”

Sheriff nodded. “Yep. Two more. Unofficially. The bodies were dumped in the snow but killed somewhere else. That’s why I need you to see them. You’ve got the eye.”

Elena appeared from the kitchen, throwing a scarf over Vane’s shoulder. “He’ll go. But you owe me a proper loaf of bread from the city bakery, Sheriff.”

“Ma’am,” the sheriff tipped his hat. “You’ll get two if he helps me catch the freak.”

Vane sighed, putting the scarf on. “Let’s get it over with.”

Elena watched from the doorway, her smile fading once they were gone.

The snow crunched underfoot as Vane and Sheriff Mallory made their way through the narrow path behind his house, heading toward the horses tied near the edge of the woods. The sky was grey, sullen. Trees looked like black bones against the white.

Sheriff glanced sideways with a smirk. “You know,” he said, adjusting his thick gloves, “for a man who lived in this town half his damn life, you really pulled a trick on us.”

Vane raised an eyebrow. “How so?”

“You come back from the war with a face like thunder, walk around like death owes you money… and next thing I know, you’re holed up with the most beautiful woman in town like it’s a damn fairytale. And you never showed her off.” He shook his head. “Selfish bastard.”

Vane gave a rare grin. “Guess I wanted something war couldn’t touch.”

Sheriff chuckled. “Good luck with that. Around here, even love’s got frostbite.”

They rode in silence for a moment, the world around them eerily still. Snow began to fall again, soft and silent.

Then the sheriff spoke, quieter this time. “She grounds you. I can see that. That’s why I asked you to help, Vane. If we don’t find this bastard… she might be next.”

The grin faded from Vane’s face. He nodded once, jaw tight.

“Then let’s make sure that never happens.”

Page 7: The Gathering

The town hall hadn’t seen this many people since the end of the war. The cold winter air seeped through the gaps in the wooden doors, but inside, the room was thick with the heat of anxious bodies and whispered theories. The sheriff stood at the front, his hat clutched in his hands, while I leaned against the wall beside him, eyes scanning the crowd — every face, every nervous twitch.

""We've called you all here because we believe,"" the sheriff began, pausing to swallow the weight of what he was about to say, ""that the person behind these killings… is one of us.""

A ripple went through the room — some gasped, others shook their heads in disbelief. A woman in the front row clutched her husband's arm. Someone coughed too loudly. Everyone felt it — the sudden shift. It was no longer about a killer out there. It was someone here.

I stepped forward. ""We’ve ruled out every outsider. These murders weren't the work of a traveler or a foreign agent. Whoever did this knows our streets, our routines... our fears."" My voice cut through the silence, and the room tensed further. ""We need your help. Any detail — anything odd you’ve seen — it matters now.""

The tension in the room was thick enough to choke on. Eyes darted, suspicious. Friends glanced at each other with uncertainty. The killer, I knew, was watching too. Hidden among them, silent, maybe even smiling.

And so the real game began.

Page 8: The Killer’s Game

The rhythmic crackling of the fireplace mixed with the soft gasps of pleasure, the warmth of her skin against mine a rare comfort in the midst of all this chaos. Ellena giggled, her arms around my neck as she whispered something teasing, but before I could respond—

BANG BANG BANG!

A frantic knocking at the door shattered the moment.

“Shit,” I muttered.

“Don’t stop now,” Ellena teased, lips brushing against my jaw, unaware of the urgency beyond the wooden door.

BANG BANG BANG!

The sheriff’s voice came through, breathless. “Open the damn door! It’s urgent!”

Ellena groaned, rolling her eyes. “He has the worst timing.”

Grabbing a coat to throw over myself, I moved toward the door. Before I could even greet him, the sheriff barged in, red-faced, panting from the cold night air and whatever nightmare had dragged him here. His eyes flicked to Ellena, then to me—shirtless, disheveled.

""You can have that later,"" he snapped. ""Right now, we got a damn problem.""

My stomach tightened at his tone. He was never this rattled.

""What happened?"" I asked, already dreading the answer.

The sheriff took a deep breath, rubbing a hand down his face before handing me a small, bloodstained piece of paper. “Another one. And this time…” His voice trailed off.

I unfolded it. My name. My damn name. And below it, a crude smile drawn in fresh blood.

Ellena gasped behind me. “How—how did they know you were working the case?”

That was the worst part. They shouldn’t have.

Page 9: The Breaking Point

The train screeched to a halt, but the unease in my gut had settled long before that. Something was wrong.

The sheriff was waiting at the platform. Hat in hand. Eyes lowered. Shoulders heavy with something unspeakable.

I couldn't breathe.

I didn’t ask. I didn’t need to.

My legs moved before my mind could catch up, pushing through the crowd, through the snow, through the bitter wind that bit into my skin like knives. My boots thudded against the wooden steps of my porch, the door hanging open like a broken jaw.

I stepped inside.

The smell of iron choked me.

Ellena lay there—on the kitchen floor where we had laughed, where she had kissed me that morning, where she had made me promise we’d leave this town someday.

Her golden hair, damp with red.

Her lips—lips that whispered my name the night before—parted slightly, as if she had tried to say something.

Her eyes, empty. Staring.

Next to her, the policewoman assigned to guard her. A bullet to the head. Dead. Useless.

The walls screamed in fresh blood:

""A personal present for my favorite detective. :)""

I swayed. My hands trembled as I reached for Ellena. My fingers ghosted over her cheek, still warm. Still her.

My breath hitched. A sound crawled up my throat, something raw, something I couldn’t hold back. My vision blurred as hot tears slipped down my face, landing on her skin, mixing with the blood.

“No…” It barely left my lips. A whisper. A plea. A denial.

She was gone. Gone.

The warmth. The laughter. The only thing that made the war, the nightmares, the ghosts of my past worth enduring.

I gritted my teeth, squeezing my eyes shut, pressing my forehead against hers like I could breathe life back into her. But the warmth was fading.

The peace I had built, shattered.

The love I had found, butchered.

And in its place, a storm.

I lifted my head slowly, my chest rising and falling with jagged breaths. My fingers curled into fists, nails digging into my palms.

I turned to the words on the wall. That damn smile. That mockery.

Something inside me snapped.

This wasn’t about justice anymore.

This was war.

**—This dynamic feels reminiscent of Sakiko and Nyamu’s clashing priorities in their band.**

There’s a slight similarity, but it’s far less harsh. MYGO, thankfully, retains an amateurish charm. For Taki, that’s a saving grace—their smaller scale keeps tensions lighter.

 

**——In the final episode's live performance, Soyo was the only one who kept looking unenthusiastic the whole time, which left quite an impression. But what was going through her mind during that scene?**

As briefly touched upon in the movie version, Soyo still harbors a faint but lingering doubt: ""Do I really belong here?"" From her perspective, after causing so much trouble and leaving, she didn't voluntarily declare her return—she was ""dragged back by Tomori."" Given that, she's not bold enough to confidently claim ""MYGO is my band"" and instead remains reserved, thinking, ""I'm only here because everyone allowed me to stay."" She'd carefully maintained her ""kind and gentle"" persona, but after ignoring Tomori, fighting with Taki, and snapping at Anon, she can't bring herself to drop the act now. She feels awkward about having her true self exposed. Deep down, she probably knows she should properly thank the members, but her stubborn pride won't let her be that honest—hence that conflicted expression. This tension within herself might persist for a while yet.

That said, separate from her own inner turmoil, she was also thoroughly unimpressed by Anon's antics during the live (laughs). By Soyo's standards, wildly hyping up the audience isn't cool—she prefers a more refined, understated performance. Like Taki, she wants things done ""properly,"" but while Taki associates ""proper music"" with hard rock and punk, Soyo leans toward a more mature, subdued style. Anon tries to act professional, but her underlying desire to stand out is painfully obvious. Meanwhile, Tomori and Raana are purely focused on singing and playing, with no agenda—even if they had one, they wouldn't be slick enough to adjust. So when it comes to musical direction, MYGO is truly all over the place.

 

**——While Soyo struggles to be genuine with MYGO's members, she was able to interact with Mortis with the same gentle attitude she used to show. Why is that?**

Through spending time with Mortis, Soyo gradually came to realize that ""the child inside Mutsumi seems quite young,"" so she naturally began treating her like she would a child. To Soyo, Mortis feels less like a friend and more like someone to protect—this is simply how Soyo expresses the kindness she knows. While we've talked about how ""her true self comes out around MYGO members,"" Mortis might be the one person with whom Soyo can show her caring, gentle side without any pretense.

 

**——Does Soyo interact with Mutsumi and Mortis as if they're completely separate people?**

Pretty much. Her attitude toward Mortis—that kindness—is different from how she acts around Mutsumi. She and Mutsumi have history, after all, not to mention they're classmates. Mortis is a little kid she only recently met, while Mutsumi is a peer with whom she's shared complicated experiences. Even after reconciling—or perhaps *because* they've reconciled—things still feel awkward when they cross paths at school. She probably doesn't treat Mutsumi coldly anymore, but guilt over ""the awful things I said"" makes it hard to be open. She likely hasn’t managed to properly apologize, and that hesitation lingers. It might take a little more time before they can talk without reservations.

 

**—In Episode 12, when Soyo asks Mutsumi ""Planting something again?"" at the vegetable garden, does she perceive her as Mutsumi or Mortis at that moment?**

From Soyo's perspective, she's absolutely addressing Mutsumi. We even directed Kohinata Mika (Soyo's VA) to deliver the line with a slightly standoffish tone - think ""tsundere"" where the ""tsun"" hasn't completely faded yet. It was a very nuanced performance we requested.

This might be belated, but both *It's MyGO!!!!!* and *Ave Mujica* are deliberately structured to present radically different perspectives depending on whose viewpoint you follow. Personally, like all novels and films, I believe stories should belong entirely to their audience the moment they leave their creators' hands. That said, during interviews like this, I do share production insights when they don't contain spoilers, hoping they might enrich the viewing experience. After all, I too love interpreting films and literature through my own lens.

These script meetings where we align creative visions always result in absurdly verbose documents. My apologies for the text walls - even reviewing these transcripts gives me a headache.

 

**A garden in a doomed world destined to decay**



**Let's now discuss the five members of Ave Mujica. After losing her motivation to continue the band upon resolving her feelings about CRYCHIC, was Sakiko's decision to reunite Ave Mujica largely influenced by Nyamu pointing out her ""responsibility for creating Ave Mujica""?**

By the time of the reunion, Sakiko had virtually no remaining motivation for the band—it was purely out of responsibility. She felt guilty toward Mutsumi (""It's my fault for creating Ave Mujica""), but Nyamu—seeing further—countered: *""You shackled everyone with inescapable bonds.""* Worse, when Nyamu echoed Sakiko's own desperate words (*""I have nothing left but Ave Mujica...""*), the weight of her actions crushed her.

Every Ave Mujica member could've thrived elsewhere. They were acclaimed, skilled musicians—Sakiko had lured them with promises to form this elite band. Without Ave Mujica, their paths would've diverged. Faced with Nyamu's *""I won't run—so you can't either,""* fleeing would've doomed Sakiko to eternal self-loathing for betraying her ideals.

 



**—How did Sakiko react to Uika's lyrics about her?**

Their raw intensity shocked her—so unlike Uika's usual demeanor. Sakiko realized: *""This is what I've made Uika become.""* (This nuance isn't shown directly.) Previously, Sakiko would propose song themes for Uika to craft professionally. *""Imprisoned Herb""* broke this pattern as Uika's first unsolicited lyrics.

Unlike Tomori (who only writes MYGO's personal lyrics), Uika writes professionally for *sumimi* and Ave Mujica. Where Tomori needs personal catharsis to create, Uika channels others' emotions effortlessly. So when Uika delivered *""You Without Wings""* and *""Accept Me Burying What I Love""*—lyrics of obsessive devotion—Sakiko was stunned. Then Nyamu's ultimatum (*""Don't run""*) forced Sakiko to accept: *""Now I must bear Uika's obsession too...""*

 



**——Does Uika's lyrics being the catalyst for Ave Mujica's reunion parallel how Tomori's lyrics led to CRYCHIC's one-time revival?**

Earlier, Uika had told Tomori *""Some things can only be conveyed through singing.""* Yet in Episode 9, Uika was stunned when confronted with Tomori's raw, unfiltered lyrics—words so painfully honest they *over*\-communicated. Seeing them, Uika likely thought: *""Saki would adore these lyrics.""* But such lyrics are something Uika could never write.

For Uika, living with Sakiko was a miracle that should've been impossible—a wish she never dared believe could come true. Now that it had, the terror of losing it consumed her. When she heard Sakiko reunited CRYCHIC with Tomori and saw those lyrics pouring out Sakiko's heart, despair took hold: *""Saki will return to CRYCHIC... Tomori will take her from me.""* This forced Uika to finally voice her obsession in lyrics—the feelings she'd suppressed for so long.

Being an artist or idol was never truly important to Uika. Even her idol dreams were borrowed—she'd always lacked a sense of self until Sakiko became her sole light. Losing the one thing that made her feel *real* was unbearable. That desperation birthed those lyrics.



**—During Ave Mujica's reunion live, Uika and Sakiko avoid eye contact. Does this mean Sakiko has no intention of reciprocating Uika's feelings?**

At that point, absolutely none. Sakiko only feels responsible for recruiting Uika into Ave Mujica. Uika's vow to *""devote her life""* is agonizing for Sakiko—ironic, since *Sakiko* once demanded such pledges. Now the tables have turned: she's the one being bound by others' resolve. Uika's emotions are too heavy; Sakiko can't face her directly. Yet she can't ignore her either, so she steals glances—only for Uika to be too absorbed in singing her devotion to notice. Their mismatched gazes symbolize how *their hearts fail to meet.*

 

**——In Episode 12, when Ave Mujica gathers at RING and Sakiko declares, ""I shall become God,"" after addressing each member by name—does this signify a renewed resolve within her?**

Yes, it's more akin to self-hypnosis. She forcibly reset the situation back to square one. By this point, Sakiko has come to realize, ""There's nothing more I can do about this situation."" Everything concerning Uika—stemming from the Togawa family and her origins—was already predetermined, regardless of how Sakiko acted. Facing a fate that has repeatedly shattered her attempts to resist, she understood that ""fighting back"" was no longer an option.

Recognizing her own powerlessness and the overwhelming forces at work beyond her control, she made a decisive resolution: ""I'll forget everything that happens beyond my reach. But this miniature garden—Ave Mujica—I'll protect it alone."" In a way, she shed the arrogance she once held—the belief that ""everything is my responsibility"" and ""I must bear it all."" Yet, after defiantly leaving the Togawa household with her grandfather, spending cheerful moments with Uika, and muttering ""I hate this"" while Uika prepares coffee at home—this reveals her lingering dissatisfaction with the choices she's made.

Humans can't live solely doing what they want. I see this as a metaphorical ending—about ""protecting oneself while navigating life's great currents."" Sakiko embraced Ave Mujica as her garden, changing her approach: ""From here, I won't retreat anymore."" That's the essence of her story.

As evident from her fondness for Tomori's lyrics, Sakiko admires raw truth and strength that strikes the heart. Her ideal was someone who could defy fate and move forward unshaken—like her late mother, like MYGO. She wanted to become a strong woman like her mother and progress steadily like MYGO. But she knows she can never be that. Even so, while grappling with this realization, she lifts her head and declares, ""I'll do what I can."" To me, this makes her a compelling heroine.

The garden Sakiko protects is a carefully crafted microcosm meant to preserve Ave Mujica's world—yet even this could crumble at any moment. Like a sandcastle destined to collapse no matter how desperately she defends it, she chooses to carry it forward regardless. Though it diverges from her mother's ideal, she resolves to wear the mask of a god—despite being mortal—and guard it to the end.

 

**——There are scenes throughout the story where Sakiko is seen reading novels. Do the book titles carry any intentional symbolic meaning?**

The very act of Sakiko reading those books is meant to function as a metaphor in itself.

**——In Episode 12, what was Sakiko's state of mind when she wrote that letter to Tomori?**

By reuniting Ave Mujica, Sakiko had—however imperfectly—found a place of emotional stability. Much like Anon, once she resolved *""This is the path I'll take,""* her resilience strengthened. With that strength came clarity: *""I hurt Tomori. I need to make amends.""* She'd always been aware of her cruelty—tormented by guilt over rejecting Tomori's persistently outstretched hand. She'd even kept every note Tomori left in her shoe locker.

So while the letter's wording was gentle, it was, like Tomori's *""聿日箋秋""* lyrics, a **farewell declaration**. To Sakiko: *""I've reclaimed my pride, but I've burdened others too much. From now on, I'll bind myself only to Ave Mujica.""* Carrying the weight of five lives (including her own) is all she can manage. The letter was her way of saying: *""This is how I'll live,""* and with it, she bid Tomori goodbye.

This story began with Tomori and Sakiko's meeting—and ends with them parting ways, each voicing their farewell.

 

**——What was Tomori thinking when she read Sakiko's letter?**

Tomori likely thought, *""She's finally moving forward,""* but that's probably all. By the time she moved on from CRYCHIC, she must have understood: *""Our paths won't cross again.""* Her resolve was already set in Episode 7—this was simply **confirming what they both knew**.

 

**——Speaking of Uika, would you say her wishes were mostly fulfilled by the finale?**

Yes—but that’s precisely what makes Uika (or rather, *Hatsune*) unsettling. Her imbalance stems from having nothing to lose. With no emotional anchors, she can fully commit to a single obsession. This makes her a terrifyingly immersive genius—whether as an idol crafting personas, writing lyrics, or losing herself in Dolores’ stage performances.

After Sakiko—the object of her devotion—gave her those ""beautiful words,"" she’s now all-in on Ave Mujica (though *sumimi* hasn’t disbanded). Not quite euphoria, but close.

 

——ところで、初華(初音)の妹である本物の初華(以下、ウイカ)はどうしているのでしようか? 当然、姉の活躍は耳に入っていると思うのですが。

 

本編ではごくわずかな描写のみになってしまいましたが、島にはもう住んでいません。本土に引っ越して母娘2人で暮らしています。姉のことはきっとおもしろくないとは思っているでしょうが、どうでしょうね。才能とアンバランスの話でいうと、仮に島を出たのがウイカのほうだった場合、アイドルになれたかどうかはわからないですね。彼女は元気な島の子で、無邪気にアイド 「ルに憧れている、ある意味普通の子なので。 そういう子たちが大勢集まってしのぎを削る中、アイドルになれたのかどうか。たしかに初華には、実父の豊川定治の後ろ盾があり、援助を受けてはいましたが、それだけであそこまで成功することはない。初華自身の才能は大きかったということです。最初の頃の脚本では、定治と初華&ウイカの母の話なんかも結構尺を使って描いていたんですが、ほかの話との都合で入らなくなったのでばっさりカットしました。豊川グル ―プは、家の名を冠してるだけあって一族経営なんですね。今の豊川家を統括しているのは定治なんですが、定治は婿養子で、次の跡継ぎ候補だった清告(祥子の父)も婿養子ということで、一族内での風当たりは強かったんです。それを定治は実力で黙らせていて、清告にも協力してもらっていたのですが、誠実一辺倒の清告が地面師の詐欺にあって失脚してしまった。詐欺に引っかかったのは本当なんですが、ただこれも反定治派にハメられた面もあって。本来なら持っている財産で168億円くらいなら補填できたはずなのに失脚するはめになったのは、社内に清告を追い落としたい人がいたからだろう･･････という感じの設定があります。でもそんな話を見たい人はいないだろうということで、割愛しました。

**——Speaking of Uika (the real Uika, Hatsune's younger sister), what is she up to now? Surely she's aware of her sister's fame.**

The real Uika only receives minimal mention in the main story - she no longer lives on the island, having moved to the mainland with just her mother. While she's surely aware of her sister's fame, she probably doesn't find it particularly amusing.

When considering talent and balance: had Uika been the one to leave the island instead, it's questionable whether she could have become an idol. She was just a cheerful island girl with an innocent admiration for idols - fundamentally ordinary. In the fiercely competitive idol industry flooded with similar hopefuls, her success would have been uncertain.

While it's true that Hatsune had backing from her biological father Togawa Sadaharu and received financial support, that alone wouldn't have brought her to such heights of success. Her own considerable talent was the decisive factor.

Early scripts actually devoted significant runtime to exploring Sadaharu's relationship with Hatsune and Uika's mother, but these subplots were ultimately cut for narrative streamlining.

Regarding the Togawa Group: as befits a family-run conglomerate bearing their name, it operates through dynastic control. While Sadaharu currently leads the Togawa family, both he and Kiyotsugu (Sakiko's father, the former heir apparent) were sons-in-law who faced strong internal opposition. Sadaharu suppressed dissent through sheer capability and had Kiyotsugu 's cooperation - until the overly-principled Kiyotsugu fell victim to a real estate scam that caused his downfall.

Though the scam was real, anti-Sadaharu factions likely orchestrated the trap. Normally their assets could have covered the ¥16.8 billion loss, but Kiyotsugu was forced out because certain executives wanted him gone. This backstory was ultimately cut because... well, who'd want to watch that?

 

——そのあたりの設定は、祥子の物語に初華を巻きこむ必要性から生まれたのでしょうか?

 

基本、作劇の必要性から設定を“盛る”ことは無いようにしています。初華が祥子の親戚になったのは、「初華の執着の理由ってなんだろう」「執着するきっかけはなんだったんだろう」というところから、初華という人間を掘り下げていってたどり着きました。 その前から、彼女の性格的に「母親から祥子の話を聞いていた」とか「祥子と直接会ったのはたぶん1回だけ」というあたりは考えていて。初華が祥子と遊んだのはじつはたった1回、一緒に星を見たあの1日だけなんですね。もう何年か2人で遊んだりして 「いれば、あそこまで執着しなかっただろうと思います。

初華は、祥子以外に「家族」がいないんです。狭い島の中で、彼女の出自は公然の秘密になっていたと思いますし、三角家の中でも疎外感を感じていた初華が、一緒に暮らしたことを境にあれだけ祥子に執着するのも、ずっと「家族」に満たされない状況の中で、初めてごく対等に、普通の人間として一緒にいてくれたから。インプリンティングから後追いするような幼さ、長年満たされなかった反動としての独占欲が、制御不能に膨れ上がっていく。初華本人をして「気持ち悪い」と言わせるほどに歪でグロテスクですが、あれは恋愛感情ではなく、彼女が家族に向ける愛情の在り方をまったく経験してこなかった証左みたいなものだと思っています。

 

制作段階で一番紛糾したのが定治の背景なのですが、いろいろ話しあった末に「これしかない」という最終アンサーみたいな感じで決まりました。シリーズの中ではだいぶ異質な家族構成ですが、このシリーズでは未必の故意を作らないといいますか、「このキャラが悪者」というような構造はとらないことを前提にしているので、そうならないような筋道を必死で探しました。定治自身はもともと愛妻家ですし、初華の母とのことも妻に先立たれた後なのでいわゆる不義ではありません。初華の母も定治を思い、初華を私生児として育てる決意をしています。定治と清告って、どちらも妻と死別しているんですよね。ただ、定治が清濁併せ持った強い人物なのに対して、清告は祥子とちょっと似ていて、「誠実で信念を持っているが、それを折られると途端に弱くなってしまう人」として設計しています。

**——Were these settings created primarily to justify involving Uika in Sakiko's story?**

We consciously avoid artificially inflating settings just for plot convenience. Making Uika (Hatsune) related to Sakiko emerged organically from exploring the fundamental question: ""What drives Uika's obsession?"" and ""What initially sparked this fixation?"" This character study led us to naturally arrive at their familial connection.

From early stages, we'd established key aspects of Uika's personality - that she'd ""heard about Sakiko from her mother"" and ""likely only met Sakiko once."" In truth, they only shared that single day together stargazing. Had they spent years interacting normally, such extreme obsession likely wouldn't have developed.

Uika essentially has no ""family"" beyond Sakiko. On that small island, her parentage was an open secret, and even within the complex Togawa family structure, she grew up feeling profoundly alienated. That one day with Sakiko became so formative precisely because Sakiko - for the first time in Uika's life - treated her as a complete equal. This created an almost duckling-like imprinting effect, compounded by years of emotional deprivation into a grotesque, uncontrollable possessiveness (which even Uika herself describes as ""disgusting""). This isn't romantic love, but rather a distorted manifestation of having never experienced healthy familial affection.

The most contentious aspect during production was undoubtedly Sadaharu's backstory. After extensive discussions, we ultimately arrived at what felt like the ""only possible resolution."" While his family circumstances are quite unconventional for this series - where we consciously avoid creating unintentional antagonists or employing simplistic ""this character is the villain"" tropes - we painstakingly crafted narrative pathways to prevent such reductive interpretations.

Sadaharu was fundamentally a devoted husband, and his relationship with Uika's mother only developed after his wife's passing, meaning it wasn't infidelity in the conventional sense. Uika's mother, for her part, genuinely cared for Sadaharu and made the deliberate choice to raise Uika as her child outside wedlock. Interestingly, both Sadaharu and Kiyotsugu shared the experience of losing their spouses. However, where Sadaharu embodies a morally complex strength - capable of navigating life's ambiguities - Kiyotsugu was designed with similarities to Sakiko: a fundamentally principled person whose conviction, once broken, leaves them profoundly vulnerable.

This character dynamic creates an intentional contrast - Sadaharu's pragmatic resilience versus Kiyotsugu's brittle idealism - that mirrors the central themes of the series while maintaining our commitment to nuanced, multidimensional characterization rather than simplistic moral binaries. The narrative carefully avoids portraying any character as purely villainous, instead presenting each individual's motivations and compromises as understandable within their particular circumstances.

 

——清告の失脚は、初華をバックアップしようとしたことと関係があるのでしょうか?

 

定治のほうがその類の手腕には優れているので、初華のバックアップ自体は、多分事務所から連絡があったときに定治がしているはずです。初華が所属しているWin-Wing-productionは、言ってみれば豊川グループの息のかかった場所と言っていい。定治としても初華には、娘と呼んであげられないし、一緒に住むこともできないことに対する罪悪感があります。 だからこそ裏でバックアップしてきたわけなんですが、初華の存在を知った清告が問題を大きくしてしまい、反目する派閥がつけ入る隙を与えてしまったという流れです。

**——Was Kiyotsugu's downfall connected to his attempts to support Uika (Hatsune)?**

Actually, Sadaharu Togawa was far more adept at handling such matters—he likely orchestrated Uika's support through Win-Wing Production (a talent agency with Togawa Group ties). Sadaharu carried deep guilt over never being able to acknowledge Uika as his daughter or live with her, which drove his behind-the-scenes backing. However, when Kiyotsugu discovered Uika's existence, his clumsy interference escalated tensions, giving anti-Sadaharu factions an opening to exploit—ultimately contributing to his downfall.

 

——ちなみに初華と一緒にsumimiとして活動している純田まなは、劇中ではあまり掘り下げられていませんでしたが、どういう人物なのでしょうか?

 

彼女はAve Mujicaメンバーのように、生い立ちや過去に大きな闇を抱えているみたいなことはありません。まなは、 第10話で演劇の舞台に立っていましたけど、お芝居はあまりうまくありません。話題性ありきで舞台に立たせてもらえた感じで、 女優としては努力の分、にゃむのほうが上手というイメージです。まな役の反田(葉月)さんにも「女優の演技はあまりうまくやらないでください」とお願いしていました。

**——What about Mana, Uika's partner in** ***sumimi***\*\*? She wasn't explored much—what's her deal?\*\*

Unlike Ave Mujica's trauma-laden members, Mana has no dark past. Though she appeared in a play (Episode 10), she's a mediocre actress at best—cast more for clout than skill. Compared to Nyamu's natural talent, Mana survives on hustle. We even instructed her VA, Hazuki Tanda: *""Don't act too well—Mana's supposed to be awkward.""*

 

——では続いて睦についてですが、まず第10 話で奈落に落ちて睦とモーティスがひとつになる描写がありましたが、あれは何が起きたのでしょうか?

 

あれは睦とモーティス、両人格とも消えてしまった、というニュアンスです。じつは睦の内面世界のシーンでは、舞台の上にいる人物だけが「人格」を獲得している、という描写をしています。客席にいた無数の睦たちは、演じる「役」であり、人格というわけではありません。

もともとモーティスという人格は睦を守るために生まれたわけですが、そこに自我が芽生えて「自分が消える恐怖」のほうが勝った結果、主人格の睦を消してしまいました。でも、モーティスは睦を守るために生まれた人格なので、睦に存在してほしかったんですね。「Imprisoned XII」が流れるなか、「存在意義の消失」や「睦を殺してしまった罪悪感」「睦恋しさ」みたいなものが重なって、モーティスが睦の後追いをした。奈落の底でもうほぼ消えている「睦」と最後の邂逅だけは果たしたというシーンになります。だから、その後ギターを弾き始めたのはもう誰だかわかりません。睦もモーティスもいない、第3の人格というわけでもない。いろんな役が入れ替わり状況に対応するだけの状態という感じです。現在のムツミは、以前、みなみがにゃむに語っていた頃の状態とも若干違っていて、役ごとに人格と呼べるものがない。モーティスは幼く、自分の言葉を持てなかったので高度なモノマネで対応していたのですが、今はそれぞれの「役」がその状況で必要になったら勝手に出てきているような感じの、つかみどころのない人になっています。なので、モーティスの演技を見抜けるにゃむは、ムツミがギターを弾き出したシーンですぐ「アレはモーティスじゃない」と気付くのですが、対して海鈴は「指を真似するだけって言ってたのに、音を出してるな」くらいの認識だと思います。

**——Regarding Mutsumi: In Episode 10, there was a scene where she fell into the abyss and merged with Mortis. What exactly happened there?**

That scene signified the **disappearance of both Mutsumi and Mortis as distinct personalities**. In Mutsumi's inner world, only the figure on stage possesses a true ""personality""—the countless Mutsumis in the audience seats are merely ""roles"" without independent consciousness.

Originally, Mortis emerged to protect Mutsumi, but upon developing her own ego, her **fear of vanishing** overpowered that purpose, leading her to erase the core personality (Mutsumi). Yet, as a protector, Mortis paradoxically *needed* Mutsumi to exist. During *""Imprisoned XII,""* layers of **existential crisis**, **guilt over 'killing' Mutsumi**, and **longing for her** drove Mortis to follow Mutsumi into the abyss. Their final encounter occurred when both were nearly dissolved.

Thus, the entity playing guitar afterward is **neither Mutsumi nor Mortis**—nor a ""third personality."" **It’s a hollowed-out state where various ""roles"" surface situationally.** Current Mutsumi differs even from her earlier state (when Minami described her to Nyamu)—now lacking any coherent personality behind the roles. Mortis, being childlike, had relied on advanced mimicry to compensate for her lack of selfhood; now, the roles emerge autonomously as needed, making her profoundly elusive.

Nyamu, who could always detect Mortis’ acting, immediately recognizes *""That’s not Mortis""* when Mutsumi plays guitar. In contrast, Umiri only notes: *""She’s producing sound now, despite claiming to just mimic finger movements.""*

 

——状況に合わせて行動するようになったことで、逆にギターが弾けるようになったということですか?

 

バレエと同様、もともとテクニック自体は体に染み付いているので、「ギターを弾ける役」が出てきた感じです。最終話冒頭の円陣のシーンでも、初華の「悪いことするみたいだね」のあとに、ムツミが「ふふっ」と笑っているんですけど、それまでの睦では考えられない変な笑い方なんですよね。「睦はこんなときには笑わない」というタイミングで、あえて笑う芝居を入れています。

**——Does this mean that by adapting to situations, she's now able to play the guitar?**

Much like ballet, the technical skills were already ingrained in her body—it's more that a ""role capable of playing guitar"" has now emerged. In the final episode's opening huddle scene, when Uika says, *""Seems like we're about to do something bad,""* Mutsumi responds with an uncharacteristic *""Heh.""* It's a laugh that would've been unimaginable for the old Mutsumi—a deliberate acting choice to have her smile at a moment when *""Mutsumi wouldn't normally laugh.""*

 

——最終話のライブが終わったあと、ムツミが手にしていた鏡の中のムツミが笑っていたのはなぜでしょうか?

 

あれは、モーティスも数ある「役」のひとつに面影を残すのみになった、というイメージなのですが、もっと言えば『Ave Mujica』という物語最後のカーテンコールに、バンドの一員としてモーティスも出してあげたかったという、僕の親心みたいなものです。一応表側には「睦」として出ているので、せめて観客には見えない鏡の中で彼女を出したいと思い、あえてお願いしてああいう形にしてもらいました。なのであの部分だけはメタ構造になっています。考察されている方がいらしたらすみません。

**——After the finale's live performance, why was the Mutsumi in the mirror smiling?**

That symbolizes how Mortis has been reduced to just a faint trace among Mutsumi's many ""roles."" To put it more sentimentally, it reflects my own parental urge—to give Mortis, as a band member, one last bow during *Ave Mujica*'s curtain call. Since ""Mutsumi"" was the one visibly onstage, I specifically requested that Mortis appear in the mirror—**a hidden farewell just for us**. So yes, that moment breaks the fourth wall a bit. My apologies to sharp-eyed analysts!

 

——モーティスが消えたとき、にゃむはすぐ ―に気づいたということでしたが、第13話の演劇シーンでムツミと絡みながら表情を歪めていました。あれはどういう心理なのでしょうか?

 

にゃむの視点でいうと、みなみから聞いていた「化け物」が目の前にいるわけです。 そこに多少なりとも恐怖を抱いているというのがひとつ。あとは自分が愛憎を持って 「見つめた「モーティス」はもういないとわかっているのに、同じ姿の人間が確かにいることへの違和感みたいなもの。

今のにゃむは、マルチタレントを目指すどころか、芸事でいえばドラム以外何もできなくなっているのですが、じつは「マルチタレントになりたい」というのも若干の逃げが入っています。演劇表現科に通うだけあって、にゃむの本当の目標は女優なんです。にゃむは「どんな手を使ってでも女優になってやる」と思っていて、バラエティ番組に出たり、配信をやっていたのも女優への道を開くためのものだったし、普段の大人っぽい格好も「グラビアの仕事にでもつながれば」という意図あってのこと。「どこでもいいからとにかく一回芸能界に入り、そこから女優への道をつかんでやる」という二重構造の夢なんですね。そんな中、演技で圧倒されてしまった睦の前で「女優になりたい」なんて言えなかった。睦の演技に圧倒されたことを境にずっと女優の夢から逃げているところがあったんですけど、いよいよそれがイップスみたいになって、演技そのものができなくなったことに気付き、にやむは自分の存在意義が揺らいでしまったんです。故郷から無理矢理上京してきて、親兄弟に応援してもらっているのに、理想とは逆のことばかりが起きて、今や演技すらできなくなった。

原因はやっぱりモーティスに萎縮したことで、彼女のことばかり考えちゃうからなんですね。これを克服しない限りはずっと先が見えないので「モーティスから逃げない」は必然といえるのですが、ただそれだけだったらAveMujicaに残らなくてもいいわけで。そこに愛憎の“愛”の感情が入ってしまったので、モーティスのそばを離れられなくなってしまった。最初は憎悪だけで、夢の障壁たる睦はもう憎くて憎くてしょうがなかったはずなんですけれど、 その人のことで頭が占められる状態なので、 憎悪ってすぐ愛にひっくり返るんですよ。 ここでいう「愛」は、恋愛的な「この人と添いとげたい」みたいな感情ではなく、どこまでいっても「大嫌いで大好き」という、愛憎相半ばな心の作用に大きく突き動かされてしまうということです。だから第10話のモーティスへの告白シーンも、ただ「愛してる」 の意味だとは言えない。にゃむに限らず、この作品は基本的に「人には2つ以上の感情がある」という前提で書かれていまして、その意味でいうと、その2つ以上の感情が、一番大きく乖離しているのが彼女の愛憎かなと思っています。

**——Regarding Nyamu's distorted expression during the theatrical scene with Mutsumi in Episode 13 - what psychological state does this reflect?**

From Nyamu's perspective, she's confronting the very ""monster"" Minami had warned her about. There's an element of fear there, but more crucially - it's the profound dissonance of facing someone who *looks* like Mortis while knowing the entity she loved/hated no longer exists within that shell.

Nyamu's current state is ironic - far from being the multi-talented star she aspired to be, she's now incapable of performing anything beyond drums. Her ""multi-talented"" ambition was always a smokescreen; her true goal was acting (hence her enrollment in performing arts). Every variety show appearance, every livestream - even her mature fashion - was calculated to break into acting through any means necessary.

Yet after being utterly eclipsed by Mutsumi's acting prowess, that dream shattered. She's developed what amounts to performance yips - she can't act at all now. Having forced her way to Tokyo against her family's wishes, their support weighs on her as she fails spectacularly.

The root? Her obsession with Mortis. She's so consumed by thoughts of her that it's paralyzed her artistry. Overcoming this means confronting Mortis directly - hence her ""I won't run from Mortis"" resolve. But pure hatred alone wouldn't bind her to Ave Mujica. That hatred has twisted into something more complex - **not romantic love, but a volatile ""I hate you/I need you"" dynamic that defines their relationship.**

Her Episode 10 ""confession"" to Mortis transcends simple ""love"" - like all characters in this story, Nyamu operates on mixed emotions. But her love/hate dichotomy is perhaps the most extreme polarization of coexisting feelings. The distorted face? That's someone realizing they're chained to the very thing destroying them.

 

**——Finally, regarding Umiri—like Uika, would you say she's achieved her ideal self in a way?**

First, it's important to understand that Umiri is someone who *""has everything.""* A loving mother, exceptional musical talent, striking looks—she's the type who naturally becomes the center of attention wherever she goes. Her only flaw might be her tendency to take charge, which ironically stems from her competence and quick wit.

Her first band failed not just because of the boycott—it was doomed from the start. Umiri was the only pro-level member, dragging the others along. Even without conflict, she might've been the only one to pass auditions elsewhere.

With Umiri, we wanted to explore two things:**""Someone who has everything becoming fixated on the one thing she can't have""""Someone who wore a mask so long, she lost what was underneath""**

That's why all her dialogue feels *weightless*. People often wonder, *""Does she even mean what she says?""*—and the answer is no. Her words are purely surface-level. Having ""everything,"" she fundamentally *can't* understand those who've lost things. Remember her hollow *""Amazing!""* while clapping at Minami's drama in Episode 2? That's how she engages with the world.

Her dynamic with Taki works because Taki *pokes* at this. Umiri herself is confident in her talent—she left home in high school declaring *""I'll live by music alone""* and achieved it effortlessly. In a sense, she's someone who *""doesn't know her ideal self.""*

Then came CRYCHIC's reunion live. For the first time, Umiri felt **envy**. Seeing Sakiko and Mutsumi's expressions, Rikki crying—it was the first time she witnessed *""that moment when trust is restored.""* She'd never experienced that. Normally, her words betray her (*""I believed in everyone, then got betrayed""*—her trauma), making her the perfect avatar for Ave Mujica's *""Is this real or fake?""* theme.

Unlike other members, Umiri's struggles aren't existential. Without Ave Mujica, she'd be fine—her angst is closer to *""My life's too ordinary; I want drama!""* Hence her attraction to the band's theatricality.

She also embodies **""tragedy that's sincere to her but ridiculous to others.""** While Ave Mujica's core motif is puppets, we mixed in circus imagery for the finale's *""Octagram Dance""*:

**Sakiko**: Ringmaster.**Uika**: Star trapeze artist.**Mutsumi**: Puppeteer's marionette.**Nyamu**: Tamed beast.

**Umiri**: The **Pierrot**—a clown whose painted tears symbolize *""the sadness behind the laughter.""*

Oh, and her *""I don't gain weight""* line? Half-true. She just doesn't care about food.

 

**——Regarding Umiri smiling during Episode 10's live performance - was that purely part of the show's act?**

Within Ave Mujica's performances, the members fully embody their roles. While the performances do reflect the main narrative's drama, every expression, gesture, and movement is meticulously choreographed beforehand. So yes - that smile was staged.

**——When Uika hands Taki juice and Umiri interjects with ""Are you cheating?"", who was that remark really targeting?**

That was directed at Uika. Umiri had already begun frequently using the term ""ex-bandmates"" in reference to Taki's past connections, so this follows that pattern. Essentially, she's warning Uika: *""Forming a band with Taki? I won't allow that.""*

Umiri's character embodies a tragic irony - while she genuinely suffers from being misunderstood, to outsiders her struggles appear like *""aristocratic playacting.""* This explains why in Episode 1's climax, her phone outburst at Sakiko for skipping practice came from a place of authentic hurt - as she stated, she's still carrying scars from past betrayals.

This culminates in the finale's play-within-a-play, where Umiri's character Timoris declares *""The terror of not being believed""* \- which perfectly encapsulates Umiri's deepest fear: *""Being trusted by no one, connected to no one.""* Interestingly, this core concept of hers emerged quite early in development.",0,1743860874.0,anime,0,0.33,False

1js3tet,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1js3tet/aita_for_telling_my_friend_to_lose_30_pounds/,AITA for telling my friend to lose 30 pounds before giving me weight loss advice?,"As the title says. I (25F) have struggled with my weight and binge eating for years. I've been dieting since I was 18, always trying a calorie deficit in some way. Usually this results in me over-eating even worse once I inevitably quit. Or I join the gym and then stop going after 2-4 weeks.

 I often lose 20-30lbs and then regain it all or even more. I currently weigh 250 pounds at 5'5 and I finally decided I need to make a change sustainably, instead of swapping back and forth between starving myself and over-eating. I'm always so tempted to lose weight FAST that I just jump down to 1200 calories a day and try working out excessively, or even fast and work out, and it has never yielded long term results. 

I recently signed up for a gym membership and I've been eating my maintenance calories every day. I know the advice is usually to eat in a deficit, but I've never stuck to the gym before and I wanted to try eating my maintenance and then slowly cutting back after I have a routine. I don't want to quit the gym. I can't afford a trainer, so this is just advice I got online and I want to try out. For 3 weeks now it's been working great and I've been going to the gym regularly without quitting and without binge eating snacks at night. 

Here's where I may be the asshole, and everyone thinks I am. I invited my closest friends over for brunch and a yap session last weekend. They know that I'm trying to lose weight and have been here for many of my failed attempts in the past. Anna (27F), Sam (29F), and Kara (23F). Sam is a bigger girl, but she's very proud of it. She wants to be a plus-sized influencer and weighs somewhere between 350-400lbs by her own admission. However, recently she had a health scare related to her diet and was assigned a dietician or nutritionist (something like that, I don't remember which word) at her doctors office to help her get her health under control. She doesn't want to lose weight but has been advised to, but at the very least to get healthier. I have no problem with whatever she wants to do obviously, and support her either way. 

 So, I made us all a little buffet-style breakfast with fresh fruit, oatmeal, breakfast sandwiches, hard boiled eggs, coffee, sausages, and a few other things. When I was preparing my oatmeal, I added a scoop of a chocolate caramel flavored protein powder to it. Sam looked between me and my oatmeal several times, showing obvious confusion and even staring at my stomach for a minute before looking back to the protein powder. 

I didn't want to assume anything, but then she reached for the protein powder jar and started reading the nutrition label. She sighed very loudly and dramatically, and then loudly told me I shouldn't be adding extra calories to my oatmeal if I want to lose weight, and it doesn't make sense to add 110 calories for only 22g of protein. I told her I'm not trying to eat in a deficit this time, and that I'm just focusing on going to the gym and not binge eating, so it makes sense for me. I was a little irritated and to be completely honest, I did sound annoyed. 

This seemed to really upset her, and she told me that because she understands nutrition that I should consider listening to her, and that the oatmeal was enough on its own. This was when I got fed up and said ""You know Sam, I'll take your diet advice when you lose 30 pounds. Until then, let me try my own thing."" She looked like she might slap me, and then told me that's why I always fail my diets, because I don't listen to anyone. 

Kara and Anna were both really upset and scolded me right there, and the rest of the brunch was tense with everyone leaving shortly after. Since then, I've received several texts and calls from them trying to get me to apologize to Sam. I know this isn't a hill I should die on, but every time I think about it I get enraged at how condescending she was to me when I've been working so hard to get healthy and she doesn't even care about it. They don't want to hang out with me again until I apologize, and I don't want to. They claim I'm fat shaming Sam and it was an unfair comment to make because I'm trying to lose weight and that's not her goal, so it's not fair or proper for me to comment on her weight. 

I told my boyfriend and now he thinks I'm nasty for being mean to Sam, too. I really thought I was right but everyone is making me feel like I'm really wrong. 

so, please be honest with me Reddit. I can handle the truth but I need to know if this is the hill I should die on. Am I the asshole? ",9,1743860787.0,AITAH,9,0.91,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, and insomniacs of all ages, prepare yourselves for UFC Fight Night 256, where the punches are real, the stakes are high, and the start time is designed to test your dedication to the sport. At 2:30 AM MSK, when most people are dreaming of sugarplums, we'll be treated to a lightweight showdown between Josh Emmett and Lerone Murphy. But let's not forget the middleweight clash that promises to be a barnburner: Brad Tavares vs. Gerald Meerschaert.

Brad Tavares, the man who once stood toe-to-toe with Israel Adesanya and lived to tell the tale, is back in action. He's like the Energizer Bunny of the UFC—he just keeps going, even when faced with monstrous elbows and the occasional five-round striking war. Tavares is the favorite here, with odds hovering around 1.56 to 1.62 across various sportsbooks. He's the kind of guy who, if he were a stock, would be a blue-chip: reliable, steady, and unlikely to crash.

On the other side of the octagon, we have Gerald Meerschaert, a man with a record that reads like a novel—37 wins, 18 losses, and a penchant for submissions that would make a boa constrictor jealous. Meerschaert is the underdog, with odds ranging from 2.35 to 2.5. He's the wildcard, the guy who could turn the fight on its head with a well-timed choke or an unexpected strike.

Now, if you're looking to place a bet that won't keep you up at night (unless you're already up for the fight), consider taking Tavares straight up. But for those who like a little more risk and reward, the over on total rounds at 2.5 could be intriguing. Both fighters have the durability of a Nokia 3310, so this one might just go the distance.

In conclusion, whether you're rooting for Tavares' steady hand or Meerschaert's unpredictable flair, one thing's for sure: this fight will be worth the sleep deprivation. So grab your coffee, set your alarms, and get ready for a night of MMA action that promises to be as thrilling as it is exhausting.

——バンドの方向性の違いみたいなところは、祥子とにゃむの関係を感じさせますね。

 

若干似ているかもしれないですね。ただ、 あそこまで辛辣じゃないというか。やっぱりバンドの規模自体が違うので、MYGO はいい意味でアマチュアなんですね。それが立希にもある意味救いにはなっていると思います。

**—This dynamic feels reminiscent of Sakiko and Nyamu’s clashing priorities in their band.**

There’s a slight similarity, but it’s far less harsh. MYGO, thankfully, retains an amateurish charm. For Taki, that’s a saving grace—their smaller scale keeps tensions lighter.

 

――最終話のライブでは、そよだけがずっと浮かない顔をしていたのが印象的だったの。 ですが、彼女はどんな心境であの場にいたのでしょうか?

 

劇場版でもちょっと触れたのですが、そよの中では「ここにいてもいいのかな」って思いがわずかながらも消えずにあるんです。そよの視点からすれば、いろいろ問題を起こして出ていったあと、自分から「戻る」と宣言したわけではなく、「燈に連れ戻されて」ここにいる、という感じで。それを経た上で 「MYGOは私のバンド」って開き直れるほど豪胆な性格ではないので、「ここにいていいってみんなが言ってくれたから」という遠慮がある。せっかく「みんなに親切で優しい私」を取り繕っていたのに、燈を無視したり、立希とケンカしたり、愛音に啖呵きったりしたので、いまさら態度を崩せないんですよね。素の部分を見られてバツが悪い。本当はメンバーにちゃんと「ありがとう」とか言う」とか言ったほうがいいって自覚はあると思うのですが、そんなふうに素直にもなれなくて意地を張ってしまう、彼女のある意味の生真面目さがああいう顔で出ています。たぶんまだしばらくはこのままいくんじゃないでしょうか。

ただ、そういう自分自身へのわだかまりとは別に、ライブ中の愛音の振る舞いには、あきれているしダサいと思っています(笑)。そよの美学としては、観客の前で大はしゃぎするスタイルはカッコいいことではないし、演奏するならしっとり弾きたい。「ちゃんとや 「りたい」というところは立希と同じくあると思うのですが、立希がハード・ロックやパンクの方向を「ちゃんとした音楽」と思っているのに対して、そよはもっと大人っぽく落ち着いた感じが好みです。愛音はちゃんとやってるつもりでその実、あわよくば目立ちたいという気持ちが透けて見えている。燈と楽奈は純粋に歌ったり弾いたりしているだけで、「こうやりたい」というベクトルがないというか、仮にあったとしても器用に合わせるなんてできない感じです。だから MyGOは、バンドの方向性に関しては本当にバラバラなんです。

**——In the final episode's live performance, Soyo was the only one who kept looking unenthusiastic the whole time, which left quite an impression. But what was going through her mind during that scene?**

As briefly touched upon in the movie version, Soyo still harbors a faint but lingering doubt: ""Do I really belong here?"" From her perspective, after causing so much trouble and leaving, she didn't voluntarily declare her return—she was ""dragged back by Tomori."" Given that, she's not bold enough to confidently claim ""MYGO is my band"" and instead remains reserved, thinking, ""I'm only here because everyone allowed me to stay."" She'd carefully maintained her ""kind and gentle"" persona, but after ignoring Tomori, fighting with Taki, and snapping at Anon, she can't bring herself to drop the act now. She feels awkward about having her true self exposed. Deep down, she probably knows she should properly thank the members, but her stubborn pride won't let her be that honest—hence that conflicted expression. This tension within herself might persist for a while yet.

That said, separate from her own inner turmoil, she was also thoroughly unimpressed by Anon's antics during the live (laughs). By Soyo's standards, wildly hyping up the audience isn't cool—she prefers a more refined, understated performance. Like Taki, she wants things done ""properly,"" but while Taki associates ""proper music"" with hard rock and punk, Soyo leans toward a more mature, subdued style. Anon tries to act professional, but her underlying desire to stand out is painfully obvious. Meanwhile, Tomori and Raana are purely focused on singing and playing, with no agenda—even if they had one, they wouldn't be slick enough to adjust. So when it comes to musical direction, MYGO is truly all over the place.

 

——そよがMYGOのメンバーに素直になれない一方で、モーティスに対しては昔の 「ように優しい態度で接することができたのはどうしてでしょうか?

 

モーティスと一緒に過ごすうちに、「睦の中にいる子はだいぶ幼いっぽい」ということがだんだんわかってきたので、そよも自然に子供に接するように接しています。そよから見たモーティスは友達というより庇護対象に近くて、そよが知っている「親切」がああいう振る舞いなんですよね。「MYGOメンバーの前では本性が出ている」みたいな話をしましたが、そよの親切心とか優しい部分をてらいもなく出せる相手はモーティスなのかなと思います。

**——While Soyo struggles to be genuine with MYGO's members, she was able to interact with Mortis with the same gentle attitude she used to show. Why is that?**

Through spending time with Mortis, Soyo gradually came to realize that ""the child inside Mutsumi seems quite young,"" so she naturally began treating her like she would a child. To Soyo, Mortis feels less like a friend and more like someone to protect—this is simply how Soyo expresses the kindness she knows. While we've talked about how ""her true self comes out around MYGO members,"" Mortis might be the one person with whom Soyo can show her caring, gentle side without any pretense.

 

——そよの中では、睦とモーティスは別人物的な感覚で接しているのでしょうか?

 

そうですね。それこそモーティスに見せたような親切な態度とは違うと思います。睦とは今までの付き合いがありますし、なにより同じクラスなので。モーティスは出会って日の浅いちっちゃい子供、睦は過去にもいろいろあった同級生という距離の差もあるだろうなと思います。和解しても、というか、したからこそ余計に、学校などで会うとまたちょっと戻ってしまうというか。もう冷たくするようなことは無いと思いますが、きっと 「睦にはひどいことを言った」という自覚があるぶん素直になれなくて、まだ自分から 「ごめんね」って言えていないことをいろいろと考えてしまったりするのではないでしょうか? わだかまりなく話すのはまだ少し時間が必要そうですよね。

**——Does Soyo interact with Mutsumi and Mortis as if they're completely separate people?**

Pretty much. Her attitude toward Mortis—that kindness—is different from how she acts around Mutsumi. She and Mutsumi have history, after all, not to mention they're classmates. Mortis is a little kid she only recently met, while Mutsumi is a peer with whom she's shared complicated experiences. Even after reconciling—or perhaps *because* they've reconciled—things still feel awkward when they cross paths at school. She probably doesn't treat Mutsumi coldly anymore, but guilt over ""the awful things I said"" makes it hard to be open. She likely hasn’t managed to properly apologize, and that hesitation lingers. It might take a little more time before they can talk without reservations.

 

——第12話でそよが、家庭菜園の前にいる睦に「また何か植えるの?」と話しかけたときは、睦とモーティス、どっちだと思っているのでしょうか?

 

そよの認識では睦だと思っているので、そよ役の小日向(美香)さんにも、ちょっとつっけんどんな感じを出してもらっています。いわばツンデレのツンがちょびっと残っている 「状態ですかね。結構微妙なところを狙って演技してもらいました。

いまさらなんですが『It,sMYGO』 と「Ave Mujica』の物語は、誰の目線で見るかによって景色がかなり変わるような作りをしています。

僕としては、小説や映画などすべての作品がそうであるように、この作品もまた僕ら制作者の手を離れた瞬間から、物語の受け取り手に自由に楽しんでいただくのが良いと考えています。ただ、このようなインタビユーをしていただける機会には、あくまで制作時の意図として、作品上特に隠す必要のないことであればだいたいそのまま話していますので、作品を楽しむ一助くらいに考えていただけるとありがたいです。僕も映画や小説を読んで、自分なりに解釈したり場面をイメージしたりするのが好きなので。ただ、 脚本会議なんかで普段スタッフとイメージをやりとりするのと同じ感じで、言語化に頭を使いつつ話しているので、チェック用原稿を見ると毎回テキスト量の多さに頭を抱えます。長くてすみません。

**—In Episode 12, when Soyo asks Mutsumi ""Planting something again?"" at the vegetable garden, does she perceive her as Mutsumi or Mortis at that moment?**

From Soyo's perspective, she's absolutely addressing Mutsumi. We even directed Kohinata Mika (Soyo's VA) to deliver the line with a slightly standoffish tone - think ""tsundere"" where the ""tsun"" hasn't completely faded yet. It was a very nuanced performance we requested.

This might be belated, but both *It's MyGO!!!!!* and *Ave Mujica* are deliberately structured to present radically different perspectives depending on whose viewpoint you follow. Personally, like all novels and films, I believe stories should belong entirely to their audience the moment they leave their creators' hands. That said, during interviews like this, I do share production insights when they don't contain spoilers, hoping they might enrich the viewing experience. After all, I too love interpreting films and literature through my own lens.

These script meetings where we align creative visions always result in absurdly verbose documents. My apologies for the text walls - even reviewing these transcripts gives me a headache.

 

いずれ朽ち果てる終末世界の庭園

**A garden in a doomed world destined to decay**

ここからはAveMujicaの5人について聞きます。CRYCHICへの思いが昇華されバンドを続ける理由を無くした祥子がAveMujicaの再結成に動いたのは、にゃむに「AveMujicaを作った責任」を指摘されたことが大きいのでしょうか?

 

再結成時の祥子にはもうバンドへのモチベーションはほぼほぼ無くて、責任感からだと思います。彼女は睦に対して「私が Ave Mujicaを作ったせいで」という罪悪感を抱いていましたが、もうちょっと先まで見抜いていたにゃむからは、「お前は皆に二度と離れられない軛(くびき)を要求しただろう」と言われたわけですね。また祥子自身もかつて追いつめられて口にした 「わたくしにはもう、AveMujicaしかない……」という言葉をにゃむの口から聞いたことで、その点についての責任をより痛感したのだと思います。

Ave Mujicaのメンバーは皆、Ave Mujicaに入らなければ別々の場所で成功していたはずなんですね。みんな才能や技術があって、相応の知名度も 「持っていて。そういう人たちの前にいろいろなエサをぶら下げて、実力と話題性を兼ね備えたバンドを立ち上げたのが祥子です。Ave Mujicaさえ無ければこうはならなかった。「私はもう逃げないから、お前も逃げるな」くらいのことを言われてしまって、それでももしここで逃げたとしたら、祥子は自分の理想と矜持との乖離から、 自分を一生許せなかったんじゃないかと思います。

**Let's now discuss the five members of Ave Mujica. After losing her motivation to continue the band upon resolving her feelings about CRYCHIC, was Sakiko's decision to reunite Ave Mujica largely influenced by Nyamu pointing out her ""responsibility for creating Ave Mujica""?**

By the time of the reunion, Sakiko had virtually no remaining motivation for the band—it was purely out of responsibility. She felt guilty toward Mutsumi (""It's my fault for creating Ave Mujica""), but Nyamu—seeing further—countered: *""You shackled everyone with inescapable bonds.""* Worse, when Nyamu echoed Sakiko's own desperate words (*""I have nothing left but Ave Mujica...""*), the weight of her actions crushed her.

Every Ave Mujica member could've thrived elsewhere. They were acclaimed, skilled musicians—Sakiko had lured them with promises to form this elite band. Without Ave Mujica, their paths would've diverged. Faced with Nyamu's *""I won't run—so you can't either,""* fleeing would've doomed Sakiko to eternal self-loathing for betraying her ideals.

 

——祥子のことを思って書いた初華の歌詞について、祥子はどう思ったのでしょうか?

 

それまで初華が祥子に見せていた態度からは想像できないほど、重々しかったので、 Ave Mujicaに誘ったことで初華を 「こんなふうにしてしまった」ということを思い知ったはずです。これは劇中で明確に描いてはいませんが、これまでのAve Mujicaの楽曲は、祥子が曲と一緒に 「こういうメッセージを伝えたい」というオファーをして、それを初華が自分のセンスで歌詞に仕上げるという作り方をしています。なので、AveMujicaで詞を先に持ってこられたのは「Imprisoned 畑(インプリズントゥエルブ)」が初めてだった。MYGOの歌詞しか書けない燈に対して、初華はプロとして作詞ができます。 sumimiの詞も書けるしAve Muji caの詞も書ける。燈は自分で思って、自分の言葉にしないと詞にできない人ですが、 初華はいろんな人のいろんな気持ちをシミュレートして書けてしまいます。そんな初華が初めて曲先ではなく自分から持ってきではなく自分から待った詞が、「羽根のない君」とか「愛すべきもの葬る私を受け入れて」とか、メチャクチャ執着されている内容だったので、それを見てショックを受けていたところへ、にゃむから「逃げるな」と言われてしまったので、祥子も「この初華の執着も背負っていかなければ･･････」となっていたんだと思います。

**—How did Sakiko react to Uika's lyrics about her?**

Their raw intensity shocked her—so unlike Uika's usual demeanor. Sakiko realized: *""This is what I've made Uika become.""* (This nuance isn't shown directly.) Previously, Sakiko would propose song themes for Uika to craft professionally. *""Imprisoned Herb""* broke this pattern as Uika's first unsolicited lyrics.

Unlike Tomori (who only writes MYGO's personal lyrics), Uika writes professionally for *sumimi* and Ave Mujica. Where Tomori needs personal catharsis to create, Uika channels others' emotions effortlessly. So when Uika delivered *""You Without Wings""* and *""Accept Me Burying What I Love""*—lyrics of obsessive devotion—Sakiko was stunned. Then Nyamu's ultimatum (*""Don't run""*) forced Sakiko to accept: *""Now I must bear Uika's obsession too...""*

 

——AveMujicaの再結成において初華の詞が決め手になったというのは、燈の詞がCRYCHICの一度限りの復活につながったことと対比になっているのでしょこうか?

 

以前、初華自身が「歌って伝わる気がするよね」と燈に言っていたんですけれど、第9 話では燈が書いた生の言葉、伝わりすぎる詞を突きつけられて、初華は衝撃を受けています。それにおそらく燈の詞を見て「さきちゃんはこの詞が大好きだろうな」と思ったはずなんです。そういう燈の詞は、初華には書けない。

初華は「祥子と2人で暮らす」なんて、自分の人生で万に一つも起きないはずだった奇跡、絶対に叶わないはずだった願いが叶ってしまって、そうなると今度はそれを失うことが強烈に怖くなっていきました。祥子がいないことに耐えられなくなり、そこへ「祥子が燈とCRYCHICをやった」と聞き、さらに祥子への思いが詰まった燈の詞を見てしまって、「さきちゃんがCRYCHICに行ってしまう」「燈ちゃんにとられてしまう」という絶望とともに、自分の祥子への執着、ずっと秘めていた思いを詞に表してしまった。

初華にとって、たぶんアーティストやアイドルであることって、さほど大事なことではないんです。アイドルになるという夢も本物の初華からの借り物です。彼女はずっと自分というものがなかった人で、その中で出会った、己を照らした唯一の光ともいうべき祥子に執着し続けている。自分が自分として存在できる、そのたったひとつのものを奪われるのは、初華にはどうしても耐えられないことだったのだと思います。 その焦りが、初華にあの詞を書かせています。

**——Does Uika's lyrics being the catalyst for Ave Mujica's reunion parallel how Tomori's lyrics led to CRYCHIC's one-time revival?**

Earlier, Uika had told Tomori *""Some things can only be conveyed through singing.""* Yet in Episode 9, Uika was stunned when confronted with Tomori's raw, unfiltered lyrics—words so painfully honest they *over*\-communicated. Seeing them, Uika likely thought: *""Saki would adore these lyrics.""* But such lyrics are something Uika could never write.

For Uika, living with Sakiko was a miracle that should've been impossible—a wish she never dared believe could come true. Now that it had, the terror of losing it consumed her. When she heard Sakiko reunited CRYCHIC with Tomori and saw those lyrics pouring out Sakiko's heart, despair took hold: *""Saki will return to CRYCHIC... Tomori will take her from me.""* This forced Uika to finally voice her obsession in lyrics—the feelings she'd suppressed for so long.

Being an artist or idol was never truly important to Uika. Even her idol dreams were borrowed—she'd always lacked a sense of self until Sakiko became her sole light. Losing the one thing that made her feel *real* was unbearable. That desperation birthed those lyrics.

 

——AveMujica再結成のライブで、 初華と祥子の視線が合わないという描写がありましたが、祥子としては初華の気持ちに応える気はないということなんでしょうか?

 

あの時点ではまったくないと言えると思います。初華をAveMujicaに誘った、祥子はその一点について責任を取るだけです。初華の「一生をあげる」という言葉にいたっては、祥子にはむしろ辛すぎるんですね。もちろん最初にAve Mujicaを立ち上げるときにそう言ったのは祥子自身ですが、そのときにはまだその覚悟があった。ここでも逆転が起きていて、以前はメンバーに誓ってもらう立場だったのが、今度は自分が周りの状況に誓わされた形になっています。初華の気持ちは重すぎて、祥子は彼女のことを見ることができない。とはいえ、ずっと無視もできないので、様子をうかがうようにちらっと初華のほうを見ていますが、そのときには初華は想いを伝える歌に集中して祥子のほうは向いていない。あの視線の交錯は、そのまま「2人の思いは通じ合っていない」ということの表れです。

**—During Ave Mujica's reunion live, Uika and Sakiko avoid eye contact. Does this mean Sakiko has no intention of reciprocating Uika's feelings?**

At that point, absolutely none. Sakiko only feels responsible for recruiting Uika into Ave Mujica. Uika's vow to *""devote her life""* is agonizing for Sakiko—ironic, since *Sakiko* once demanded such pledges. Now the tables have turned: she's the one being bound by others' resolve. Uika's emotions are too heavy; Sakiko can't face her directly. Yet she can't ignore her either, so she steals glances—only for Uika to be too absorbed in singing her devotion to notice. Their mismatched gazes symbolize how *their hearts fail to meet.*

 

——第12話、RINGにAve Mujicaが集まったシーンで、祥子がメンバーひとりひとりを名前で呼んだあと「わたくしが神になります」と宣言しましたが、あの時祥子の中でまたひとつ覚悟ができたということでしょうか?

 

そうですね、自己暗示に近いと思います。つまり強制的に状況を振り出しに戻したんです。ここへきて祥子も、「この状況は自分にはもうどうすることもできない」ということに気付いています。初華に関することは、豊川の家と彼女の出生に端を発する話で、祥子がどう振る舞おうがすべては決ま

っていた話だった。そうなると、これまでずっと立ち向かっては粉微塵にされてきた運命に、立ち向かうという選択肢はもうなかったのだと思います。自分が無力すぎること、自分の関わらないところで大きな力が動いて いていることを知ったことで、「私の関わらないと ところで起きたことは全部忘れる」 「そのうえで」 でこの箱庭だけは守る」という方向に覚悟 倍が吹っ切れた。逆に言えば、それまで持 く持っていた「すべて自分の責任」「すべて 「自分が背負うべき」というある意味の驕りをそぎ落とされたと言ってもいいと思います。しかしながら、祖父に啖呵を切って豊川家を出ていったあと、初華と2人はしゃいですごし、初華の家に戻って初華がコーヒーを用意してくれている間に、祥子が「嫌いですわ」ともらすのは、やっぱり自分の選択に彼女自身が納得できていないからでもあると思います。

人間やりたいことばかりやって生きていけるわけじゃなく、「大きな流れの中で自分を守りながら生きていく」ことへの比喩的なエンドであってもいいと思ったんです。 祥子はAve Mujicaという箱庭を抱きかかえて「もうここからは動かない」という戦い方に変えた。そんな話だと思っています。

祥子は、燈の詞が好きなことからもわかるように、心を打つ真実と強さが好きなんです。彼女の理想は運命を打破して強く進んでいける人で、それは亡き母であり、 MYGOだったんだと思います。母のように強い女性になりたかったし、MYGOみたいに一歩一歩進んでいくことが本当の理想だった。でも自分は、きっともうそうはなれない。その思いを噛み締めながら、それでも「自分にできることをやるんだ」と俯かず顔を上げるのは、ひとつのヒロイン像だと僕は思っています。祥子が守る箱庭は、AveMujicaの世界を守るために飾り立てられた小さな箱庭で、それもいつ終わってしまうかわからない。どれだけ必死に守っても端から崩れていく砂上の楼閣みたいなもので、それでもそれを抱えて生きていくこと、母のような理想とは違ったとしても、神ならざる身でひとり、 神の仮面をかぶってそれを守り抜いていくことを、祥子は決めたんだと思います。

**——In Episode 12, when Ave Mujica gathers at RING and Sakiko declares, ""I shall become God,"" after addressing each member by name—does this signify a renewed resolve within her?**

Yes, it's more akin to self-hypnosis. She forcibly reset the situation back to square one. By this point, Sakiko has come to realize, ""There's nothing more I can do about this situation."" Everything concerning Uika—stemming from the Togawa family and her origins—was already predetermined, regardless of how Sakiko acted. Facing a fate that has repeatedly shattered her attempts to resist, she understood that ""fighting back"" was no longer an option.

Recognizing her own powerlessness and the overwhelming forces at work beyond her control, she made a decisive resolution: ""I'll forget everything that happens beyond my reach. But this miniature garden—Ave Mujica—I'll protect it alone."" In a way, she shed the arrogance she once held—the belief that ""everything is my responsibility"" and ""I must bear it all."" Yet, after defiantly leaving the Togawa household with her grandfather, spending cheerful moments with Uika, and muttering ""I hate this"" while Uika prepares coffee at home—this reveals her lingering dissatisfaction with the choices she's made.

Humans can't live solely doing what they want. I see this as a metaphorical ending—about ""protecting oneself while navigating life's great currents."" Sakiko embraced Ave Mujica as her garden, changing her approach: ""From here, I won't retreat anymore."" That's the essence of her story.

As evident from her fondness for Tomori's lyrics, Sakiko admires raw truth and strength that strikes the heart. Her ideal was someone who could defy fate and move forward unshaken—like her late mother, like MYGO. She wanted to become a strong woman like her mother and progress steadily like MYGO. But she knows she can never be that. Even so, while grappling with this realization, she lifts her head and declares, ""I'll do what I can."" To me, this makes her a compelling heroine.

The garden Sakiko protects is a carefully crafted microcosm meant to preserve Ave Mujica's world—yet even this could crumble at any moment. Like a sandcastle destined to collapse no matter how desperately she defends it, she chooses to carry it forward regardless. Though it diverges from her mother's ideal, she resolves to wear the mask of a god—despite being mortal—and guard it to the end.

 

——物語の要所要所で祥子が小説を読むシーンがありますが、書籍のタイトルにも演出的な意図があるのでしょうか?

 

祥子がその書籍を読んでいること自体が、 ある種のメタファーになるように考えています。

 

——第12話で祥子が燈に宛てた手紙は、どのような心境で書いたのでしょうか?

 

祥子はAveMujicaを再結成したことで、まがりなりにも自分の心の落ち着きどころを見つけたんですね。愛音と同じで、自分の中で「こうするんだ」と指針が決まってしまえば、多少なりとも強度は上がる。強度が上がれば視野も広がって、「燈にはひどいことをしたからあやまらないと」という思いが出てくる。これまでも、ずっとひどいことをしているという自覚はあって、 燈が絶えず差し伸べていてくれた手を払いのけていたことへの罪の意識にさいなまれてはいたんです。燈が下駄箱に貼ってくれていた付箋も、ひとつひとつずっと保管していた。なのであの手紙は、文面はすごく柔らかいですけど、燈の「聿日箋秋」の詞と同じ、決別宣言です。祥子的には、己の矜持みたいなものは取り戻せたけれど、これまでに周りに迷惑をかけすぎた。だからこの先は「自分が縛るのはAve Mujicaだけ」と決めた。自分含め5人の人生を背負うだけで精一杯だから、「私はそうやって生きていきます」と伝えて燈への別れの言葉にした。この作品は、燈と祥子の出会いから始まって、最後は2人がそれぞれに、別れを伝えて終わる物語です。

**——There are scenes throughout the story where Sakiko is seen reading novels. Do the book titles carry any intentional symbolic meaning?**

The very act of Sakiko reading those books is meant to function as a metaphor in itself.

**——In Episode 12, what was Sakiko's state of mind when she wrote that letter to Tomori?**

By reuniting Ave Mujica, Sakiko had—however imperfectly—found a place of emotional stability. Much like Anon, once she resolved *""This is the path I'll take,""* her resilience strengthened. With that strength came clarity: *""I hurt Tomori. I need to make amends.""* She'd always been aware of her cruelty—tormented by guilt over rejecting Tomori's persistently outstretched hand. She'd even kept every note Tomori left in her shoe locker.

So while the letter's wording was gentle, it was, like Tomori's *""*聿日箋秋*""* lyrics, a **farewell declaration**. To Sakiko: *""I've reclaimed my pride, but I've burdened others too much. From now on, I'll bind myself only to Ave Mujica.""* Carrying the weight of five lives (including her own) is all she can manage. The letter was her way of saying: *""This is how I'll live,""* and with it, she bid Tomori goodbye.

This story began with Tomori and Sakiko's meeting—and ends with them parting ways, each voicing their farewell.

 

——ちなみに祥子からの手紙を読んでいたときの燈は何を思っていたのでしょうか?

 

祥子がこうやって返答をくれたので「歩き出したんだ」とは思っているはずですが、 たぶんそれくらいだと思います。 CRYCHICを卒業した時点で、燈も「もうお互いの道が交わることはないんだろう」ときっとわかっていると思います。第7 話の時点で覚悟は決めていたので、「お互いにわかっていたことを確かめあった」みたいな感じだと思います。

**——What was Tomori thinking when she read Sakiko's letter?**

Tomori likely thought, *""She's finally moving forward,""* but that's probably all. By the time she moved on from CRYCHIC, she must have understood: *""Our paths won't cross again.""* Her resolve was already set in Episode 7—this was simply **confirming what they both knew**.

 

——では次に初華について聞きたいのですが、彼女の場合、最終話の時点では自分の希望がほぼ叶えられたということなのでしょうか？

 

そうですね。初華というか、初音の怖いところは、あのアンバランスさなんですよね。彼女は何も持っていない無敵の人で、自分自身のウェイトがものすごく軽いので、ひとつ決めたらそこに全振りできてしまう。それはアイドルとして求められる自分や、歌詞などの創作、ひいてはステージ上のドロリスであったり、ドロリスが演じる役に身を預けきる、没入型の天才という見方もできます。一途に想っている祥子になんだかすごく素敵な言葉を言われましたので、 有頂天と言ったらあれですけど、今は全体重をかけてAveMujicaに乗っかっていると思います。ちなみにsumimiはまだ解散していません。

**——Speaking of Uika, would you say her wishes were mostly fulfilled by the finale?**

Yes—but that’s precisely what makes Uika (or rather, *Hatsune*) unsettling. Her imbalance stems from having nothing to lose. With no emotional anchors, she can fully commit to a single obsession. This makes her a terrifyingly immersive genius—whether as an idol crafting personas, writing lyrics, or losing herself in Dolores’ stage performances.

After Sakiko—the object of her devotion—gave her those ""beautiful words,"" she’s now all-in on Ave Mujica (though *sumimi* hasn’t disbanded). Not quite euphoria, but close.

 

——ところで、初華(初音)の妹である本物の初華(以下、ウイカ)はどうしているのでしようか? 当然、姉の活躍は耳に入っていると思うのですが。

 

本編ではごくわずかな描写のみになってしまいましたが、島にはもう住んでいません。本土に引っ越して母娘2人で暮らしています。姉のことはきっとおもしろくないとは思っているでしょうが、どうでしょうね。才能とアンバランスの話でいうと、仮に島を出たのがウイカのほうだった場合、アイドルになれたかどうかはわからないですね。彼女は元気な島の子で、無邪気にアイド 「ルに憧れている、ある意味普通の子なので。 そういう子たちが大勢集まってしのぎを削る中、アイドルになれたのかどうか。たしかに初華には、実父の豊川定治の後ろ盾があり、援助を受けてはいましたが、それだけであそこまで成功することはない。初華自身の才能は大きかったということです。最初の頃の脚本では、定治と初華&ウイカの母の話なんかも結構尺を使って描いていたんですが、ほかの話との都合で入らなくなったのでばっさりカットしました。豊川グル ―プは、家の名を冠してるだけあって一族経営なんですね。今の豊川家を統括しているのは定治なんですが、定治は婿養子で、次の跡継ぎ候補だった清告(祥子の父)も婿養子ということで、一族内での風当たりは強かったんです。それを定治は実力で黙らせていて、清告にも協力してもらっていたのですが、誠実一辺倒の清告が地面師の詐欺にあって失脚してしまった。詐欺に引っかかったのは本当なんですが、ただこれも反定治派にハメられた面もあって。本来なら持っている財産で168億円くらいなら補填できたはずなのに失脚するはめになったのは、社内に清告を追い落としたい人がいたからだろう･･････という感じの設定があります。でもそんな話を見たい人はいないだろうということで、割愛しました。

**——Speaking of Uika (the real Uika, Hatsune's younger sister), what is she up to now? Surely she's aware of her sister's fame.**

The real Uika only receives minimal mention in the main story - she no longer lives on the island, having moved to the mainland with just her mother. While she's surely aware of her sister's fame, she probably doesn't find it particularly amusing.

When considering talent and balance: had Uika been the one to leave the island instead, it's questionable whether she could have become an idol. She was just a cheerful island girl with an innocent admiration for idols - fundamentally ordinary. In the fiercely competitive idol industry flooded with similar hopefuls, her success would have been uncertain.

While it's true that Hatsune had backing from her biological father Togawa Sadaharu and received financial support, that alone wouldn't have brought her to such heights of success. Her own considerable talent was the decisive factor.

Early scripts actually devoted significant runtime to exploring Sadaharu's relationship with Hatsune and Uika's mother, but these subplots were ultimately cut for narrative streamlining.

Regarding the Togawa Group: as befits a family-run conglomerate bearing their name, it operates through dynastic control. While Sadaharu currently leads the Togawa family, both he and Kiyotsugu (Sakiko's father, the former heir apparent) were sons-in-law who faced strong internal opposition. Sadaharu suppressed dissent through sheer capability and had Kiyotsugu 's cooperation - until the overly-principled Kiyotsugu fell victim to a real estate scam that caused his downfall.

Though the scam was real, anti-Sadaharu factions likely orchestrated the trap. Normally their assets could have covered the ¥16.8 billion loss, but Kiyotsugu was forced out because certain executives wanted him gone. This backstory was ultimately cut because... well, who'd want to watch that?

 

——そのあたりの設定は、祥子の物語に初華を巻きこむ必要性から生まれたのでしょうか?

 

基本、作劇の必要性から設定を“盛る”ことは無いようにしています。初華が祥子の親戚になったのは、「初華の執着の理由ってなんだろう」「執着するきっかけはなんだったんだろう」というところから、初華という人間を掘り下げていってたどり着きました。 その前から、彼女の性格的に「母親から祥子の話を聞いていた」とか「祥子と直接会ったのはたぶん1回だけ」というあたりは考えていて。初華が祥子と遊んだのはじつはたった1回、一緒に星を見たあの1日だけなんですね。もう何年か2人で遊んだりして 「いれば、あそこまで執着しなかっただろうと思います。

初華は、祥子以外に「家族」がいないんです。狭い島の中で、彼女の出自は公然の秘密になっていたと思いますし、三角家の中でも疎外感を感じていた初華が、一緒に暮らしたことを境にあれだけ祥子に執着するのも、ずっと「家族」に満たされない状況の中で、初めてごく対等に、普通の人間として一緒にいてくれたから。インプリンティングから後追いするような幼さ、長年満たされなかった反動としての独占欲が、制御不能に膨れ上がっていく。初華本人をして「気持ち悪い」と言わせるほどに歪でグロテスクですが、あれは恋愛感情ではなく、彼女が家族に向ける愛情の在り方をまったく経験してこなかった証左みたいなものだと思っています。

 

制作段階で一番紛糾したのが定治の背景なのですが、いろいろ話しあった末に「これしかない」という最終アンサーみたいな感じで決まりました。シリーズの中ではだいぶ異質な家族構成ですが、このシリーズでは未必の故意を作らないといいますか、「このキャラが悪者」というような構造はとらないことを前提にしているので、そうならないような筋道を必死で探しました。定治自身はもともと愛妻家ですし、初華の母とのことも妻に先立たれた後なのでいわゆる不義ではありません。初華の母も定治を思い、初華を私生児として育てる決意をしています。定治と清告って、どちらも妻と死別しているんですよね。ただ、定治が清濁併せ持った強い人物なのに対して、清告は祥子とちょっと似ていて、「誠実で信念を持っているが、それを折られると途端に弱くなってしまう人」として設計しています。

**——Were these settings created primarily to justify involving Uika in Sakiko's story?**

We consciously avoid artificially inflating settings just for plot convenience. Making Uika (Hatsune) related to Sakiko emerged organically from exploring the fundamental question: ""What drives Uika's obsession?"" and ""What initially sparked this fixation?"" This character study led us to naturally arrive at their familial connection.

From early stages, we'd established key aspects of Uika's personality - that she'd ""heard about Sakiko from her mother"" and ""likely only met Sakiko once."" In truth, they only shared that single day together stargazing. Had they spent years interacting normally, such extreme obsession likely wouldn't have developed.

Uika essentially has no ""family"" beyond Sakiko. On that small island, her parentage was an open secret, and even within the complex Togawa family structure, she grew up feeling profoundly alienated. That one day with Sakiko became so formative precisely because Sakiko - for the first time in Uika's life - treated her as a complete equal. This created an almost duckling-like imprinting effect, compounded by years of emotional deprivation into a grotesque, uncontrollable possessiveness (which even Uika herself describes as ""disgusting""). This isn't romantic love, but rather a distorted manifestation of having never experienced healthy familial affection.

The most contentious aspect during production was undoubtedly Sadaharu's backstory. After extensive discussions, we ultimately arrived at what felt like the ""only possible resolution."" While his family circumstances are quite unconventional for this series - where we consciously avoid creating unintentional antagonists or employing simplistic ""this character is the villain"" tropes - we painstakingly crafted narrative pathways to prevent such reductive interpretations.

Sadaharu was fundamentally a devoted husband, and his relationship with Uika's mother only developed after his wife's passing, meaning it wasn't infidelity in the conventional sense. Uika's mother, for her part, genuinely cared for Sadaharu and made the deliberate choice to raise Uika as her child outside wedlock. Interestingly, both Sadaharu and Kiyotsugu shared the experience of losing their spouses. However, where Sadaharu embodies a morally complex strength - capable of navigating life's ambiguities - Kiyotsugu was designed with similarities to Sakiko: a fundamentally principled person whose conviction, once broken, leaves them profoundly vulnerable.

This character dynamic creates an intentional contrast - Sadaharu's pragmatic resilience versus Kiyotsugu's brittle idealism - that mirrors the central themes of the series while maintaining our commitment to nuanced, multidimensional characterization rather than simplistic moral binaries. The narrative carefully avoids portraying any character as purely villainous, instead presenting each individual's motivations and compromises as understandable within their particular circumstances.

 

——清告の失脚は、初華をバックアップしようとしたことと関係があるのでしょうか?

 

定治のほうがその類の手腕には優れているので、初華のバックアップ自体は、多分事務所から連絡があったときに定治がしているはずです。初華が所属しているWin-Wing-productionは、言ってみれば豊川グループの息のかかった場所と言っていい。定治としても初華には、娘と呼んであげられないし、一緒に住むこともできないことに対する罪悪感があります。 だからこそ裏でバックアップしてきたわけなんですが、初華の存在を知った清告が問題を大きくしてしまい、反目する派閥がつけ入る隙を与えてしまったという流れです。

**——Was Kiyotsugu's downfall connected to his attempts to support Uika (Hatsune)?**

Actually, Sadaharu Togawa was far more adept at handling such matters—he likely orchestrated Uika's support through Win-Wing Production (a talent agency with Togawa Group ties). Sadaharu carried deep guilt over never being able to acknowledge Uika as his daughter or live with her, which drove his behind-the-scenes backing. However, when Kiyotsugu discovered Uika's existence, his clumsy interference escalated tensions, giving anti-Sadaharu factions an opening to exploit—ultimately contributing to his downfall.

 

——ちなみに初華と一緒にsumimiとして活動している純田まなは、劇中ではあまり掘り下げられていませんでしたが、どういう人物なのでしょうか?

 

彼女はAve Mujicaメンバーのように、生い立ちや過去に大きな闇を抱えているみたいなことはありません。まなは、 第10話で演劇の舞台に立っていましたけど、お芝居はあまりうまくありません。話題性ありきで舞台に立たせてもらえた感じで、 女優としては努力の分、にゃむのほうが上手というイメージです。まな役の反田(葉月)さんにも「女優の演技はあまりうまくやらないでください」とお願いしていました。

**——What about Mana, Uika's partner in** ***sumimi*****? She wasn't explored much—what's her deal?**

Unlike Ave Mujica's trauma-laden members, Mana has no dark past. Though she appeared in a play (Episode 10), she's a mediocre actress at best—cast more for clout than skill. Compared to Nyamu's natural talent, Mana survives on hustle. We even instructed her VA, Hazuki Tanda: *""Don't act too well—Mana's supposed to be awkward.""*

 

——では続いて睦についてですが、まず第10 話で奈落に落ちて睦とモーティスがひとつになる描写がありましたが、あれは何が起きたのでしょうか?

 

あれは睦とモーティス、両人格とも消えてしまった、というニュアンスです。じつは睦の内面世界のシーンでは、舞台の上にいる人物だけが「人格」を獲得している、という描写をしています。客席にいた無数の睦たちは、演じる「役」であり、人格というわけではありません。

もともとモーティスという人格は睦を守るために生まれたわけですが、そこに自我が芽生えて「自分が消える恐怖」のほうが勝った結果、主人格の睦を消してしまいました。でも、モーティスは睦を守るために生まれた人格なので、睦に存在してほしかったんですね。「Imprisoned XII」が流れるなか、「存在意義の消失」や「睦を殺してしまった罪悪感」「睦恋しさ」みたいなものが重なって、モーティスが睦の後追いをした。奈落の底でもうほぼ消えている「睦」と最後の邂逅だけは果たしたというシーンになります。だから、その後ギターを弾き始めたのはもう誰だかわかりません。睦もモーティスもいない、第3の人格というわけでもない。いろんな役が入れ替わり状況に対応するだけの状態という感じです。現在のムツミは、以前、みなみがにゃむに語っていた頃の状態とも若干違っていて、役ごとに人格と呼べるものがない。モーティスは幼く、自分の言葉を持てなかったので高度なモノマネで対応していたのですが、今はそれぞれの「役」がその状況で必要になったら勝手に出てきているような感じの、つかみどころのない人になっています。なので、モーティスの演技を見抜けるにゃむは、ムツミがギターを弾き出したシーンですぐ「アレはモーティスじゃない」と気付くのですが、対して海鈴は「指を真似するだけって言ってたのに、音を出してるな」くらいの認識だと思います。

**——Regarding Mutsumi: In Episode 10, there was a scene where she fell into the abyss and merged with Mortis. What exactly happened there?**

That scene signified the **disappearance of both Mutsumi and Mortis as distinct personalities**. In Mutsumi's inner world, only the figure on stage possesses a true ""personality""—the countless Mutsumis in the audience seats are merely ""roles"" without independent consciousness.

Originally, Mortis emerged to protect Mutsumi, but upon developing her own ego, her **fear of vanishing** overpowered that purpose, leading her to erase the core personality (Mutsumi). Yet, as a protector, Mortis paradoxically *needed* Mutsumi to exist. During *""Imprisoned XII,""* layers of **existential crisis**, **guilt over 'killing' Mutsumi**, and **longing for her** drove Mortis to follow Mutsumi into the abyss. Their final encounter occurred when both were nearly dissolved.

Thus, the entity playing guitar afterward is **neither Mutsumi nor Mortis**—nor a ""third personality."" **It’s a hollowed-out state where various ""roles"" surface situationally.** Current Mutsumi differs even from her earlier state (when Minami described her to Nyamu)—now lacking any coherent personality behind the roles. Mortis, being childlike, had relied on advanced mimicry to compensate for her lack of selfhood; now, the roles emerge autonomously as needed, making her profoundly elusive.

Nyamu, who could always detect Mortis’ acting, immediately recognizes *""That’s not Mortis""* when Mutsumi plays guitar. In contrast, Umiri only notes: *""She’s producing sound now, despite claiming to just mimic finger movements.""*

 

——状況に合わせて行動するようになったことで、逆にギターが弾けるようになったということですか?

 

バレエと同様、もともとテクニック自体は体に染み付いているので、「ギターを弾ける役」が出てきた感じです。最終話冒頭の円陣のシーンでも、初華の「悪いことするみたいだね」のあとに、ムツミが「ふふっ」と笑っているんですけど、それまでの睦では考えられない変な笑い方なんですよね。「睦はこんなときには笑わない」というタイミングで、あえて笑う芝居を入れています。

**——Does this mean that by adapting to situations, she's now able to play the guitar?**

Much like ballet, the technical skills were already ingrained in her body—it's more that a ""role capable of playing guitar"" has now emerged. In the final episode's opening huddle scene, when Uika says, *""Seems like we're about to do something bad,""* Mutsumi responds with an uncharacteristic *""Heh.""* It's a laugh that would've been unimaginable for the old Mutsumi—a deliberate acting choice to have her smile at a moment when *""Mutsumi wouldn't normally laugh.""*

 

——最終話のライブが終わったあと、ムツミが手にしていた鏡の中のムツミが笑っていたのはなぜでしょうか?

 

あれは、モーティスも数ある「役」のひとつに面影を残すのみになった、というイメージなのですが、もっと言えば『Ave Mujica』という物語最後のカーテンコールに、バンドの一員としてモーティスも出してあげたかったという、僕の親心みたいなものです。一応表側には「睦」として出ているので、せめて観客には見えない鏡の中で彼女を出したいと思い、あえてお願いしてああいう形にしてもらいました。なのであの部分だけはメタ構造になっています。考察されている方がいらしたらすみません。

**——After the finale's live performance, why was the Mutsumi in the mirror smiling?**

That symbolizes how Mortis has been reduced to just a faint trace among Mutsumi's many ""roles."" To put it more sentimentally, it reflects my own parental urge—to give Mortis, as a band member, one last bow during *Ave Mujica*'s curtain call. Since ""Mutsumi"" was the one visibly onstage, I specifically requested that Mortis appear in the mirror—**a hidden farewell just for us**. So yes, that moment breaks the fourth wall a bit. My apologies to sharp-eyed analysts!

 

——モーティスが消えたとき、にゃむはすぐ ―に気づいたということでしたが、第13話の演劇シーンでムツミと絡みながら表情を歪めていました。あれはどういう心理なのでしょうか?

 

にゃむの視点でいうと、みなみから聞いていた「化け物」が目の前にいるわけです。 そこに多少なりとも恐怖を抱いているというのがひとつ。あとは自分が愛憎を持って 「見つめた「モーティス」はもういないとわかっているのに、同じ姿の人間が確かにいることへの違和感みたいなもの。

今のにゃむは、マルチタレントを目指すどころか、芸事でいえばドラム以外何もできなくなっているのですが、じつは「マルチタレントになりたい」というのも若干の逃げが入っています。演劇表現科に通うだけあって、にゃむの本当の目標は女優なんです。にゃむは「どんな手を使ってでも女優になってやる」と思っていて、バラエティ番組に出たり、配信をやっていたのも女優への道を開くためのものだったし、普段の大人っぽい格好も「グラビアの仕事にでもつながれば」という意図あってのこと。「どこでもいいからとにかく一回芸能界に入り、そこから女優への道をつかんでやる」という二重構造の夢なんですね。そんな中、演技で圧倒されてしまった睦の前で「女優になりたい」なんて言えなかった。睦の演技に圧倒されたことを境にずっと女優の夢から逃げているところがあったんですけど、いよいよそれがイップスみたいになって、演技そのものができなくなったことに気付き、にやむは自分の存在意義が揺らいでしまったんです。故郷から無理矢理上京してきて、親兄弟に応援してもらっているのに、理想とは逆のことばかりが起きて、今や演技すらできなくなった。

原因はやっぱりモーティスに萎縮したことで、彼女のことばかり考えちゃうからなんですね。これを克服しない限りはずっと先が見えないので「モーティスから逃げない」は必然といえるのですが、ただそれだけだったらAveMujicaに残らなくてもいいわけで。そこに愛憎の“愛”の感情が入ってしまったので、モーティスのそばを離れられなくなってしまった。最初は憎悪だけで、夢の障壁たる睦はもう憎くて憎くてしょうがなかったはずなんですけれど、 その人のことで頭が占められる状態なので、 憎悪ってすぐ愛にひっくり返るんですよ。 ここでいう「愛」は、恋愛的な「この人と添いとげたい」みたいな感情ではなく、どこまでいっても「大嫌いで大好き」という、愛憎相半ばな心の作用に大きく突き動かされてしまうということです。だから第10話のモーティスへの告白シーンも、ただ「愛してる」 の意味だとは言えない。にゃむに限らず、この作品は基本的に「人には2つ以上の感情がある」という前提で書かれていまして、その意味でいうと、その2つ以上の感情が、一番大きく乖離しているのが彼女の愛憎かなと思っています。

**——Regarding Nyamu's distorted expression during the theatrical scene with Mutsumi in Episode 13 - what psychological state does this reflect?**

From Nyamu's perspective, she's confronting the very ""monster"" Minami had warned her about. There's an element of fear there, but more crucially - it's the profound dissonance of facing someone who *looks* like Mortis while knowing the entity she loved/hated no longer exists within that shell.

Nyamu's current state is ironic - far from being the multi-talented star she aspired to be, she's now incapable of performing anything beyond drums. Her ""multi-talented"" ambition was always a smokescreen; her true goal was acting (hence her enrollment in performing arts). Every variety show appearance, every livestream - even her mature fashion - was calculated to break into acting through any means necessary.

Yet after being utterly eclipsed by Mutsumi's acting prowess, that dream shattered. She's developed what amounts to performance yips - she can't act at all now. Having forced her way to Tokyo against her family's wishes, their support weighs on her as she fails spectacularly.

The root? Her obsession with Mortis. She's so consumed by thoughts of her that it's paralyzed her artistry. Overcoming this means confronting Mortis directly - hence her ""I won't run from Mortis"" resolve. But pure hatred alone wouldn't bind her to Ave Mujica. That hatred has twisted into something more complex - **not romantic love, but a volatile ""I hate you/I need you"" dynamic that defines their relationship.**

Her Episode 10 ""confession"" to Mortis transcends simple ""love"" - like all characters in this story, Nyamu operates on mixed emotions. But her love/hate dichotomy is perhaps the most extreme polarization of coexisting feelings. The distorted face? That's someone realizing they're chained to the very thing destroying them.

 

**——Finally, regarding Umiri—like Uika, would you say she's achieved her ideal self in a way?**

First, it's important to understand that Umiri is someone who *""has everything.""* A loving mother, exceptional musical talent, striking looks—she's the type who naturally becomes the center of attention wherever she goes. Her only flaw might be her tendency to take charge, which ironically stems from her competence and quick wit.

Her first band failed not just because of the boycott—it was doomed from the start. Umiri was the only pro-level member, dragging the others along. Even without conflict, she might've been the only one to pass auditions elsewhere.

With Umiri, we wanted to explore two things:**""Someone who has everything becoming fixated on the one thing she can't have""""Someone who wore a mask so long, she lost what was underneath""**

That's why all her dialogue feels *weightless*. People often wonder, *""Does she even mean what she says?""*—and the answer is no. Her words are purely surface-level. Having ""everything,"" she fundamentally *can't* understand those who've lost things. Remember her hollow *""Amazing!""* while clapping at Minami's drama in Episode 2? That's how she engages with the world.

Her dynamic with Taki works because Taki *pokes* at this. Umiri herself is confident in her talent—she left home in high school declaring *""I'll live by music alone""* and achieved it effortlessly. In a sense, she's someone who *""doesn't know her ideal self.""*

Then came CRYCHIC's reunion live. For the first time, Umiri felt **envy**. Seeing Sakiko and Mutsumi's expressions, Rikki crying—it was the first time she witnessed *""that moment when trust is restored.""* She'd never experienced that. Normally, her words betray her (*""I believed in everyone, then got betrayed""*—her trauma), making her the perfect avatar for Ave Mujica's *""Is this real or fake?""* theme.

Unlike other members, Umiri's struggles aren't existential. Without Ave Mujica, she'd be fine—her angst is closer to *""My life's too ordinary; I want drama!""* Hence her attraction to the band's theatricality.

She also embodies **""tragedy that's sincere to her but ridiculous to others.""** While Ave Mujica's core motif is puppets, we mixed in circus imagery for the finale's *""Octagram Dance""*:

**Sakiko**: Ringmaster.**Uika**: Star trapeze artist.**Mutsumi**: Puppeteer's marionette.**Nyamu**: Tamed beast.

**Umiri**: The **Pierrot**—a clown whose painted tears symbolize *""the sadness behind the laughter.""*

Oh, and her *""I don't gain weight""* line? Half-true. She just doesn't care about food.

 

**——Regarding Umiri smiling during Episode 10's live performance - was that purely part of the show's act?**

Within Ave Mujica's performances, the members fully embody their roles. While the performances do reflect the main narrative's drama, every expression, gesture, and movement is meticulously choreographed beforehand. So yes - that smile was staged.



**——When Uika hands Taki juice and Umiri interjects with ""Are you cheating?"", who was that remark really targeting?**

That was directed at Uika. Umiri had already begun frequently using the term ""ex-bandmates"" in reference to Taki's past connections, so this follows that pattern. Essentially, she's warning Uika: *""Forming a band with Taki? I won't allow that.""*

Umiri's character embodies a tragic irony - while she genuinely suffers from being misunderstood, to outsiders her struggles appear like *""aristocratic playacting.""* This explains why in Episode 1's climax, her phone outburst at Sakiko for skipping practice came from a place of authentic hurt - as she stated, she's still carrying scars from past betrayals.

This culminates in the finale's play-within-a-play, where Umiri's character Timoris declares *""The terror of not being believed""* \- which perfectly encapsulates Umiri's deepest fear: *""Being trusted by no one, connected to no one.""* Interestingly, this core concept of hers emerged quite early in development.",4,1743860514.0,BanGDream,0,1.0,False

1js3ol1,https://i.redd.it/ohb74of8s0te1.jpeg,Red(?) Curry Colada,"A mashup inspired by curry-based cocktails from @schmuckordie and @verygooddrinks over on Instagram, and a memorable recent trip to Bangkok.

This was a bit of a journey, with lots of trial-and-error and tinkering along the way, but my final spec was:

- 650 ml rum (350 ml light rum I'd infused with dehydrated bananas and wanted to use up, 150 ml light rum I fat-washed with the oil from a packet of red curry paste, 100 ml light rum I'd infused with mango and lemongrass, 50 ml Plantation OFTD) 

- 225 ml citrus blend (1:1 lemon/lime super juice)

- 225 ml cream of coconut (1:1 coconut milk and rich simple syrup)

- 25 g red curry paste bought from a grocery store in Bangkok

- 200 ml pineapple juice

- 200 ml coconut water

- 200 ml whole milk

Method:

- Mix all ingredients except whole milk in a bowl and let sit for about an hour (tasted along the way and realised there wasn't enough heat or booze, which is why I added the OFTD and the curry oil fat-washed rum).

- Pour the mix over whole milk, stirring gently, and let the gnarly mix sit for another hour or so. 

- Strain through cheesecloth/coffee filters, switching vessels once the liquid drips clear. Filter a second time for an even clearer final product. I didn't expect it to lose that much of the red colour, but it still tastes very much like Thai red curry.

- Bottle and store in the fridge, ready to go whenever you want a smooth, refreshing tropical drink with a bit of a spiced curry kick. Lime leaf garnish is optional, but adds a lovely aroma. 

I'm sure I could've done many things differently/better, but I'm enjoying this whole process of learning by doing (and making mistakes). I just really, really appreciate how supportive the cocktail community is, and how willingly people share their drinks/recipes/processes! ",1,1743860381.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

These days I’m in a little local singing group, and this year it’s our 20th anniversary of the group’s founding, and the local youth choir’s 40th anniversary year, so both groups decided to do a coffee morning fundraiser together to raise money for music for our anniversary concerts later in the year.

I have a friend who I’ve known for just over a year. We met because our kids became “best friends” at school. He’s the first friend I’ve made in literally years outside of a workplace or hobby, and I get on well with him and his husband. He’s also without any doubt some type of neurodivergent but undiagnosed, so I don’t know if what happened today is just a clash of our triggers. 

I mentioned to him that our group were singing and would he like to come and see us, but he didn’t have to if it wasn’t his thing. He said he wasn’t bothered about hearing the kids at 11, but would come to hear us at 11:30. I honestly fully expected him to not show at all or to show up super late, but to my surprise he showed up halfway through the kids singing - unfortunately they ran way longer than we’d anticipated and didn’t finish until 11:50. He jokingly complained to me in the interval that we hadn’t started at the time I told him and we laughed. I then went to get ready to go on, and when I came out with my group he was nowhere to be seen! 

I kept glancing up between songs wondering if he would come back but he never did. It very much threw me off my game because I was worried something bad must have happened to his kid or husband. I ran to check my phone when we finished and there was no message, further fuelling my anxiety something bad must have happened - surely if he had just got bored and left he would’ve texted to let me know?? 

I texted him asking why he’d left, and the response I got was that he realised he had dropped his money out of his pocket, went outside to look for it, got angry and went home. He followed this up with “Sorry I missed you. I got pissed off. All I got was 40 minutes of kids singing!!” (It was 20 minutes but ok…) 

This pissed me the hell off because I’d been really worried - who turns up to support a friend and then leaves before they even start unless something bad has happened?? 

So, and here dear potatoes is where I may be the a-hole, I responded that I was now pissed off too so I guess we’d both had a great morning. He replied asking why I was pissed off, and I told him “Because you left. If you didn’t want to come just don’t come.” His response was that “others things” happened and it’s not like we were performing just for him. I childishly replied “whatever” as I was too mad by this point. 

I will admit it I know it triggered me a lot more than it should because growing up my dad would miss my concerts or have to dash out partway through to take calls or go back to work, and I do acknowledge that I’m probably a lot more triggered because of that than anyone else would normally be. But I just can’t get over *actually turning up* to support a friend and then leaving 2 minutes before they start because you’re mad you dropped money and we didn’t start bang on time?? I mean I’m broke, I get it, £20 is no joke, but stay for the concert anyway seeing as you’re already there??

My husband is on my side and even brought me chocolate back from the shops, gave me a hug and said “Sorry your friend was a bit of a dick today.” 

I don’t want to throw the whole friendship in the bin or anything but how the hell do I move forward from this?? Any advice very much appreciated and thanks fellow potatoes 🥔🩷 

Edit: I have now received the following essay of a response to my childish “whatever”: 
“I never promised I was coming, actually never agreed to come. Choirs offer zero interest to me, even the good ones. I did turn up, for you alone. I was told you’d be on at 11:30, you weren’t, and I had to wait through something I had no interest in for 40 minutes, I was getting impatient. Then told I had to wait 15 more. I didn’t have breakfast, got up earlier than I needed to, in order to see you at the time you were meant to be on. I would’ve been sat for an hour waiting for a concert I didn’t want to watch in order to support a friend. And I still turned up, I’ve already apologised twice for leaving but that got a passive aggressive ‘whatever’. I didn’t have breakfast or a drink, waited 40 minutes, I intended to get a coffee, realised I’d lost £20 I’d brought to support your choir. Went looking for it and couldn’t find it. Got very annoyed, hungry, thirsty and had no money to change that. Went home. I can tell you now and forever, I will never have a desire to go and sit and listen to a choir, moreso on a Saturday morning. I apologised twice for leaving, and I’ve given a thorough explanation why. I never even made a commitment to turn up. Did anyway. If I hadn’t even bothered turning up, after making no promises that I would, this conversation wouldn’t even be happening.” 

I’ve responded explaining I didn’t expect him to show, was surprised he did, and find it incredibly rude to actually show up to something and then leave - either show up and stay or don’t show up at all. And now I know how much he hates choirs, I’ll never mention them again. 

Christ on a bike, I just wanted to invite a friend to something important to me 😖 ",2,1743860117.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,4,1.0,False

*Something big lands behind Max and lets out a bellowing roar*

Max: ""Hah... the vermin leader himself has graced me with his presence.""

*The glowing energy condenses into a small orb, and he pockets it.*

""This wouldn't be any fun, if I just blew everything up.""

**Why would fun matter to you worm.**

Max: ""Because that's all this is. I could've leveled your entire city... I could've has my companions tear your guards limb from limb already...""

""This, was a statement... you're prey, existing to be toyed with. You fucked up, and now you're finding out.""

**You disrespect me by not even turning around to talk to me, you will pay for that.**

*Max slowly turns his head, looking over his shoulder, draconic slits focus on his new target.*

Max: ""Why would I respect you? You've done nothing but show cruelty to your people... you've allowed this wretched kingdom of slavery and abuse to exist... you're nothing more than a bug to be squashed.""

*The Vampiric Black Dragon laughs*

**Workers are paid here, there is no slavery! Don’t tell me you align yourself with the terrorists of the resistance?! You are truly laughing stock then.**

Max: ""Paid... don't make me laugh, pest. I've seen your wages... I've seen your working conditions... lung cancer... work incidents... the corruption in your policeforce...""

""Resistances exist for one singular reason... corrupt leadership. I intend to disband the resistance... by making them obsolete. Today, is the day you die.""

""Your citizens are gone. Your kingdom in shambles. I, am in control here. Not you.""

**Do you think I have only one city?! I will rebuild, this will do nothing to me.**

Max: ""Do you think you'll have the chance? This city is just the beginning... I'll blow this one up, I'll hang your head on my wall... and then just repeat the cycle. I'll remove the oppressed from the city, and blow it up again, killing whatever crook you put in place there, just the same.""

**You bore me intruder, get out of my city.**

Max: ""Now why would I do that?""

**Because you have taken my people from me, what else could you possibly want.**

Max: ""Retribution for the people you've wronged. As I just stated... your head, on my wall.""

""I'll enjoy the process of taxidermy on a vampiric dragon all too much.""

Max: ""I am Maximillian Silverweave. Gold-Mercurial Greatwyrm, Eastorean God of Alchemy, Founder of the Interstellar empire of ARMADA, Slayer of corrupt Kings and Emperor alike... I have more wealth and influence than you could dream of having... I have more cities under my gilded wings than you could imagine...""

""You are nothing but a wyrm to me. A tiny pest... a miniscule obstactle. I say these things, for you are nothing to me. You're merely ENTERTAINMENT!""

**Then be entertained!**


*the giant dragon sprays acid at Max, acid that merely pings off the armour of guards but melts the gold off of the pavement Maximillian doesn't even turn. Instead, he wraps his wings around himself like a cocoon, the golden scales melting off the flesh... though only for a moment.*

*It's not long before the acid starts turning to gold itself, coating the affected area in a new layer of scales. Maximillian grins smugly, visible through the purple crystalline membranes of his wings.*

Max: ""I just said I'm a god of Alchemy. Neutralizing an acid is something quite easy to someone with this domain.""

""Now... your acid won't do much to me... and I doubt my venoms will do much to you, mister Vampire... so how about we settle this like proper men of our stature and duke it out?""

**Fair is fair, I will kill you and take your title, then your people will truly cower in fear.**

*The Wyrm lunges for max and the guards move as a unit, pushing him towards the emperors waiting jaws.*

*Max can't help but laugh.*

Max: ""Kill me, huh... many have tried... some have succeeded. Yet here I stand today.""

*his wings unfurl as his fists blaze, turning to his enemy... and making a mad dash, only to duck below and try to slam his jaw shut with a fiery uppercut. It’s like punching solid tungsten, the blow is just absorbed as the emperor bears down on him, wrapping Max in a crushing bite*

*Max places both his gauntlets to each part of the jaws, barely holding back the crushing force. Though rather than just trying to push the jaws away, he's gripping both firmly, trying to keep them, and himself, in place.*

Max: ""Do you know how bad of an idea... it really is... to let a golden greatwyrm near your guts?""

*He inhales deep, intense heat starting to come off of his throat and chest, and a bright light starting to burn from each as well.*

**U-uh aaaarrrgh**

*the guards charge, seeing the opening, spearing, slashing, cutting at Max with unseen and unimpeded force*

Max: ""Mutually assured destruction it is, then....""

*A single message goes out through the drone: ""Send Aoi and Clarissa to clean up remaining hostiles... I'll be back... momentarily.""*

*As the guards stab and slash at Max, gashes are opened and the energy starts to spill out, he pulls himself into the king's maw... only to detonate in a blaze of flames that could level a city block. The Emperor contains most of the blast, downsizing it to a small explosion roughly the size of a hand grenade, killing most of the guards and injuring one*

*Rachnia's voice can be heard over the drone this time.*

Rachnia: *""What happened? I felt honey blow up... did he blow himself up to kill another target again?""*

Ssinjin: From what I can gather, yes, yes he did, an unfortunate loss I’m afraid… wait.. what do you mean by again?

Rachnia: *""Ugh... he keeps doing this... even though he knows it'll fuck him up for days!""*

Ssinjin: days? Think permanently, he’s dead…

Rachnia: *""Oh... he didn't tell you?""*

Ssinjin: Clearly not, because I missing something…

Rachnia: *""Ever heard of a philosopher's stone?""*

Cryso: Hah! That old wives tale? Don’t tell me, he’s made one?

Rachnia: *""Not quite. He could... but he made something far better. Imagine a philosopher's stone crossbred with the concept of a lich phylactery... and you get about the gist of what he made.""*

*""Each of us have one... though mine and Max's have fused into a divine core when he ascended.""*

Ssinjin: I’ll need a better explanation later but I’ll take what I can from that that information… whatever that information means…

Rachnia: *""Point being, I just saw him dash out of our bedroom and head out the front door again... shouldn't be long.""*

Ssinjin: right…

*Rachnia was right, it's not long before Max puffs into the room, next to the drone. At the same time, Clarissa and Aoi arrive at the scene of the detonation, ready to sweep the area clean of hostiles.*

Max: ""okay... that.... still really fucking hurts.""

Ssinjin: y-you’re back?!

Cryso: that woman wasn’t kidding…

Max: ""Well yes, did the message not send? I did say I'd be back...""

*He's rolling his shoulders and cricking his neck.*

""Fuck, I'm gonna need to ask Zack to help me out later again... think a joint regenerated wrong again...""

Ssinjin: you just died… how can you be so calm?

Max: ""Well... this form of regeneration is a lot less painful than the one I had when I first met Lala, and she killed me like, what... four dozen times before she'd listen? Aoi burnt me to a crisp six times too before she calmed down... oh and a few months ago she literally burnt my wings off when she was in an enraged panic due to... uh... certain horrible circumstances.""

""Enemy had child soldiers and everything... it didn't do her psyche much good...""

""I guess the answer is... I'm used to it?""

Ssinjin: I see… well I’ll ask more questions later, for now let’s hop to it.

Max: ""Yeah... probably for the best to clean up what's left, right now. How many civs are left in the city?""

""Once they're all out... I can send in a crowd of dullahan and yokai to find Ventash'ma's soul.""

Cryso: Nobility district is empty, in the blast we had a few civilian casualties but otherwise we are alright. Farming district is coming along smoothly and so is the factory district.

Max: ""Goddamnit... send in a few dullahan in advance. Make sure those casualties are accounted for... we can get them new bodies...""

*The drone nods, and it's not long until several Dullahan appear in the nobility district, appearing behind unobserved doors as they tend to do.*

Ssinjin: I’ve learned not to question things with you now…

Max: ""I have lived a long, long, eventful life. I'd be willing to fill you lot in on  just what has all happened... another day... when sitting down with a hot pot of tea or coffee is actually... justifiable.""

""Not during an evacuation.""

Cryso: well with you back let’s get back to it, we have little time to lose.

Max: ""Indeed. Evac should continue smoothly in those two districts... but it seems as though raiding the royalty district is all that remains.""

""Well, aside from finding the missing soul, that is.""

Cryso: So let’s get raiding then!

*Maximillian carefully adjusts his two golden gauntlets as he stands there, testing the jets on the back of them, paired with the front covers flipping open and closed once more, revealing the holes where shotgun blasts would come from.*

Max: ""I presume we're not going to waste any time running through the city to get there, are we? You've got the dragon express right here.""

*He stretches his wings out on his back.*

Cryso: Oh… umm…

Ssinjin: We aren’t combat trained, only Muina is…

Max: ""Ah.""

""Uhhh... guess I should bring her along then.""

Cryso: I actually need her here, can you take the place on your own?

Max: ""That'd be alright. Not like I'm exactly alone either.""

""I've got two of my daughters and Aoi here, after all... well, three daughters, but Eliza isn't properly combat trained either.""

Cryso: Thank you, I’ll see you soon then, happy raiding!

*Max bows and vanishes from where he stands in a single puff of gold once more, appearing back in the nobility district where Clarissa and Aoi had gone.*

Max: ""Well well. Seems like the Emperor really was all bark, huh?""

Clarissa: ""I don't think many people are ready to get blown up like that.""

Aoi: ""sounds like an issue of skill on his part.""

After reading a goodly number of posts here, I see that a fair number of people are still having issues after a week of cutting out caffeine. Nine days should be the max for withdrawal symptoms. Four days should be the norm.

From my perspective, something is VERY wrong if you're still suffering after a couple of weeks. It sounds like a lot of you have zero resources *and* have blown your adrenals out. Make sure your hydrating several times a day, add a small pinch of sea salt to the water. If you have some alkalizing minerals, add a small amount as well.

Take a broad range of supplements to build up reserves, this should include vitamin C at least 3 times a day (1 or 2 grams). After adding supplements, if you're not feeling good after a couple of months....See a Doctor!",3,1743859971.0,Biohackers,3,0.8,False

She follows the road toward the cliffs. Maybe for the view. Maybe because of the painting. Maybe because some part of her knows the answers aren’t in that room.

The town doesn’t stop her.

The path curls upward. Weeds break through cobblestone. The grass near the edge of the cliffs is brittle and gray, even in spring. She hears waves but doesn’t see them—just a thick blanket of fog below, endless and churning.

Then she hears it.

A voice.

Whispering—no, singing—beneath the fog.

It’s a lullaby.

One she hasn’t heard since she was a child.

Her mother’s voice.

But her mother’s been dead ten years.

Maren edges closer to the cliff.

And she sees something impossible.

In the fog below, just for a second—her old house. The one that burned down. Whole and untouched. Light in the windows. Her bike is lying in the yard.

Then it’s gone.

Like it blinked out of existence.

Maren stumbles back, heart hammering in her ribs. She pulls out the charm stone, gripping it tight.

The lullaby fades. The fog churns.

Ashburn watches.
Maren doesn’t remember the walk back to the inn.

She barely remembers her hands turning the key in the lock or the way the door creaked open with the weight of something old. Not age—memory. The room is exactly as she left it. Unsettlingly so. Like it’s been waiting.

She tosses Mr. P onto the bed and leans her back against the closed door. Her eyes sting, her bones hum. The weight of the fog, the painting, the house—it presses against her ribs like a held breath.

Eventually, the silence wraps around her like a cold shawl. And sleep comes for her not like a wave, but like a tide rising without her noticing.

⸻

She dreams of

A hallway too narrow, its walls the color of old teeth. Her feet are bare, silent on the stone floor. The corridor bends in ways that feel wrong, like it was built from memory instead of blueprints. No doors, but openings. Arched and yawning. Each time she passes one, a whisper trails after her—too quiet to understand, but full of urgency.

She turns.

There’s something down the hall. She can’t see it. Can’t hear it.

But it knows her.

And that should terrify her.

Instead, she feels ashamed. Like a child being called home after breaking something sacred.

She starts to cry, but no tears come. Just a choking sound that isn’t hers.

⸻

She wakes up.

The room is silent. Early morning light glows faintly behind the thin curtains. There are no shadows in the corners. No dream residue. No pounding heart.

But her hands are still clenched into fists around the blanket.

And her pillow is damp.

Mr. P has fallen to the floor.

She picks him up, brushing dust off his little belly. “Sorry, bud.”

She doesn’t remember what she dreamt. Not really.

But when she looks out the window, across the rooftops of Ashburn, she feels that same shame bloom in her chest again. A hollow sort of ache.

Something is pulling her deeper.

And she doesn’t know why yet.

But she will.

Maren is halfway through tying her boots when she hears it—a soft shuffle, like paper brushing wood. She freezes, breath caught in her throat.

Silence follows. No footsteps retreating. No creak of the old floorboards.

Just silence.

She creeps to the door and presses her ear to the wood. Nothing.

When she opens it, no one’s there. But a small slip of paper lies at her feet, pale against the dark wood. Folded once, no name.

Just her.

She bends down slowly, her heart a small, steady drumbeat behind her ribs. The paper is thin, rough around the edges like it was torn from something older. She unfolds it.

The writing is faint. The ink faded to a dull brown.

“Look for the place that no longer casts a shadow.
It remembers. Even if you don’t.”

No signature. No clue who left it.

She glances down the hall—still empty.

The charm stone in her coat pocket pulses with a faint warmth, like it recognizes something.

She reads the note again.

No longer casts a shadow.

She doesn’t know what it means. But it curls into her like a hook in soft flesh.

Ashburn is speaking.

And something deep inside her wants to listen.
Maren pockets the note and leaves the inn just as the sun begins to droop toward the horizon. Ashburn is glazed in a syrupy amber light, and for a moment, it looks beautiful. Unreal. The kind of beauty you only notice in dreams you’re afraid to wake from.

She doesn’t know where she’s going. Just that she needs to go. Someone wanted her to.

The first person she sees is an older man sitting on a bench outside the general store, whittling a piece of driftwood. He hums something off-key—an old sea shanty, maybe. His eyes are soft and clouded, like smoke trapped under glass.

“Excuse me,” she says. “I’m… looking for a place that doesn’t cast a shadow.”

He doesn’t look up. Just chuckles, low and raspy.

“Well now, that’s a peculiar thing to want.”

“What does it mean?”

The man sets down his carving. It’s a bird. Or it was. The beak’s chipped. The wings look… wrong, too long. Bent backward.

“Depends on what you’re remembering,” he says. “Some places don’t throw shadows anymore ‘cause they already gave ‘em away.”

He pats the bench next to him.

Maren doesn’t sit.

He nods, as if that’s fair.

“Don’t go to the lighthouse yet,” he says. “It’s not time.”

“I didn’t say anything about—”

But the man has already started humming again, carving into the wood with new focus.

Across the street, a woman stands on the porch of a narrow, slanted house. She’s watering a planter of dried-out herbs. The watering can is empty.

Maren crosses over.

“Hi,” she says. “Sorry to bother you.”

The woman smiles like she’s heard a private joke.

“Shadowless places, mm?”

Maren stiffens. “You heard—?”

“No,” the woman says. “But you’ve got the look. The girl before you did too.”

Maren’s throat goes dry. “What girl?”

The woman blinks slowly. Her smile fades.

“The town takes in what it needs. Just like it forgets what it must. That’s how it survives.”

“That doesn’t mean anything.”

“Of course it does,” the woman says gently. “You’re just not listening yet.”

She pours invisible water over the same patch of soil, then turns and disappears into the house, the screen door creaking shut behind her.

Maren stands there for a long moment, the note in her pocket suddenly heavy as stone.

She turns to leave and finds that the man on the bench is gone too.

The carving sits in his place.

The bird.

Bent wings. No shadow beneath it.
Maren approaches the carved bird like it might bite her. It’s rough, splintered in places—its wings too long, crooked like someone snapped them and tried to make them look beautiful anyway. The grain of the wood ripples down its back like feathered scars.

Its eyes are just shallow divots, but it feels like it’s looking at her.

She picks it up.

The air shifts. A breeze curls through town that didn’t exist a moment before, tugging at her coat, stirring the dust in tight circles around her boots.

Then the bird turns warm in her hand.

Not hot. Not dangerous. Just warm enough to feel alive.

Maren looks down the street.

The shadows have lengthened—but only in one direction. Everything behind her stretches long and dark, but ahead… no shadows at all. The light there is flat and pale, like the sun forgot to follow.

She follows.

The town seems to twist with her as she walks—not dramatically, just slightly off-kilter. Streets that were straight now lean. Doorways feel narrower. Windows slightly taller. The further she walks, the more wrong the angles feel. Like a house built by someone who only ever heard about houses.

She clutches the bird, its warped wings digging into her palm.

And then she sees it.

A narrow alley between two houses she swears wasn’t there before. The kind you wouldn’t look at twice unless something led you to it.

At the end of it is a wall—concrete, stained with lichen and salt. And carved into that wall is something that makes her stop breathing for a second.

Her name.

Not just “Maren.”

Maren Blackwell.

Etched deep and clumsy, like it was done with a nail. Under it, in smaller letters, almost hidden:

We remember you.

Maren’s heart kicks up in her chest.

She steps forward, and the carved bird grows hotter, buzzing softly like a phone call just before it rings.

There’s something at the base of the wall. A bundle of fabric. At first she thinks it’s trash, but then she sees the edge of a photo peeking out from under the folds.

She crouches.

It’s a Polaroid.

The picture hasn’t developed all the way—still fogged with those familiar, chemical swirls—but two things are clear: a shadow of her own profile… and someone standing behind her.

Someone she doesn’t recognize.

Their face is blurred. Deliberately.

They’re holding something.

Maren flips the photo over.

Scrawled on the back, in the same hand that etched the wall:

You forgot first. We only followed.

She hears something behind her. A step. But when she turns, the alley is empty again.

Only the bird in her hand… and the photo… and her name in the wall.

Ashburn has remembered her.

She just doesn’t know why yet.
Maren’s breath comes tight as she straightens, the photo trembling in her fingers. The carved bird is hot now—almost too hot to hold—but she doesn’t let it go. The alley presses close, the walls slick with damp and time.

She steps backward, pocketing the photo, and—

A sound.

Wet.

Not footsteps. Not a voice. Something that moves without bone.

She whirls.

At the far end of the alley, something is unfolding.

It was a shadow. She thought. But shadows don’t rise.

It’s wrong in the way that makes your stomach drop before your mind understands why. Its limbs—if they are limbs—bend wrong. Not like broken bones, but like they never learned how to bend right in the first place. It drips, even though the air is dry.

A dragging, sloshing sound.

Maren takes a step back, heart hammering.

The thing lifts its head—or what she thinks is its head—and the light around it warps. Not darker, not brighter—thinner. Like a veil being stretched.

She doesn’t wait.

She bolts.

The carved bird pulses in her hand, once—like a warning.

She runs hard out of the alley and into the street, breath sharp and cold in her chest. When she glances back—

Nothing.

No creature. No warping light. No alley.

Just two leaning houses, pressed too close together.

Like it never existed at all.

Maren doesn’t slow down until she reaches the Larkspur House. She fumbles the key, hands shaking, and lets herself in.

The woman at the front desk is gone.

The whole inn feels heavier.

Maren climbs the stairs two at a time and slams the door to Room 13 behind her. Only then does she let herself breathe.

She sets the carved bird on the desk. It’s cooled down again. Innocent. Just wood.

Mr. P has flopped halfway out of the duffel bag. His felt eyes look up at her like he knows everything.

“I didn’t imagine that,” she mutters. “I didn’t.”

She slides the photo out of her pocket. The figure behind her… clearer now. Not their face—still smeared like breath on a mirror—but their shape.

Feminine.

Tall.

Holding something out to her.

Maren stares at it until her eyes blur.

She doesn’t remember ever taking this photo. But something deep in her gut says it is her.

She falls into bed, clutching the stone charm in one hand and Mr. P in the other.

Sleep comes fast. But it doesn’t come clean.

⸻

She dreams in colors she’s never seen. Hums in her bones. Buildings with no doors. People with no faces. Laughter that weeps.

She wakes up gasping. No sweat. No scream. Just confusion so vast it makes her ache.

There’s a note under her door.

Plain paper. Black ink.

Just two words:

Try again.

The paper feels heavier than it should. Damp at the edges, like it was left out in a fog. Try again—the words seem harmless. But Maren feels the same chill from the alley last night creep up her spine.

She presses the note between the pages of her journal and gets dressed. The carved bird slips into her coat pocket without thought. Mr. P watches from the bed, one flipper up like a salute.

“Keep the fort down, Commander P,” she mumbles, trying to joke, but her voice is rough with unease.

The Larkspur House is empty again—no old woman, no sounds from the other rooms. It’s as if the place only ever breathes when she isn’t looking. Outside, Ashburn feels different. Not wrong, not yet. Just shifted. Like a photograph that’s been nudged slightly off-center.

She heads for the café near the town square. Elaine’s, says the hand-painted sign above the window. Inside, a few people sip coffee and pick at pastries, eyes cast out toward the gray horizon. No one looks startled when Maren walks in.

The woman behind the counter—forties, strong arms, warm eyes—nods at her.

“Morning, love. Fog’s lifting.”

Maren orders a coffee. It comes in a mug that’s slightly chipped. She asks about the note.

“Note?” the woman repeats, then shrugs. “We all get one, sooner or later.”

Maren’s stomach tenses. “What does it mean?”

The woman wipes her hands on her apron. “I think it means whatever you need it to. Some folks leave. Some stay. Some… forget they ever got one.”

Maren frowns. “And what happens to the ones who stay?”

The woman’s eyes are kind but distant. “They remember. Eventually.”

Before Maren can press further, a sound outside the café window catches her attention.

A bird.

Sleek. Black. Familiar.

It lands on a post and tilts its head at her.

The carved bird in her pocket grows warm.

Without thinking, she leaves the café, coffee half-finished.

The bird hops from post to fence to low wall, always just far enough ahead. Leading her.

Maren follows.

Through winding streets, past closed-up houses and wind-worn porches. The town isn’t deserted—just withdrawn. A curtain flutters. A rocking chair shifts with no one in it.

Finally, the bird stops at the edge of an overgrown garden. An old greenhouse crouches at the center, glass panes fogged and cracked. Ivy clutches the roof like claws.

Maren steps forward.

A scream tears through the air—high, but distant. Not human.

She turns, heart hammering—but there’s nothing behind her.

When she looks back at the greenhouse, the bird is gone.

Instead, the door is open.

Inside, the air is thick and heavy, warm like breath. The plants inside are… wrong. Familiar shapes twisted just enough to unnerve. A rose with too many petals. A vine that shivers on its own. A tree in the corner bearing fruits with faces.

One of the panes in the back is shattered, jagged like a bite mark.

And on the floor, something that shouldn’t be there: claw marks. Deep and long. Whatever made them didn’t belong in a place built by hands.

She kneels beside the marks, fingertips brushing the edge. They feel recent. The soil is disturbed, but there’s no scent of rot—just something sweet, cloying. Like sugar turned.

A creak.

She stands up fast, heart racing.

A man stands in the greenhouse doorway. Tall. Beard. Eyes like old coins.

“Did you follow the bird?” he asks, voice like gravel and cigarettes.

Maren doesn’t answer. Not yet.

The man smiles. Not kindly. Not unkindly.

“You’re closer now,” he says. “Closer than most get on their second day.”

She steps toward him. “What am I close to?”

His smile fades. “The edge.”

She swallows. “Of what?”

But the man only lifts a hand and points behind her.

When she turns, the plants have shifted. Every flower turned to face her. The fruit faces are grimacing. Their petals curled inward, like ears.

Listening.

Maren turns slowly back to the man, the pressure of all those watching flowers thick in her chest.

“They weren’t like that before,” she says, voice dry.

He nods. “They change when it’s listening.”

“It?”

The man doesn’t answer directly. He steps into the greenhouse, his boots crunching gently against scattered glass and damp soil. Up close, he smells faintly of cedar smoke and something older. Not unpleasant—just… ancient.

“You think this is about forgiveness,” he says, not looking at her.

Maren tenses. “I didn’t say anything about—”

“You didn’t have to.”

He kneels and brushes dirt from something partially buried beneath a vine. A corner of metal glints. A nameplate? She can’t see.

“Some people come here for closure. Some for punishment. Some because the spiral calls them.”

“Spiral?”

He glances at her now. His expression is unreadable. “Time bends funny here. So do choices. Ever think maybe this is where things come after they break?”

Maren’s jaw clenches. “I don’t understand.”

“Not yet.”

She looks past him, toward the glass wall with the missing pane. The light shifts.

That warping veil again—thinness, like something breathing through the seams of the world.

Then—

Movement.

Fast. Wet. The shape from the alley, only now it’s closer. Pressed just outside the greenhouse, half-hidden behind the warped glass. A mass of bone and sinew, but not built like anything meant to walk. It stretches a limb—too long, too wrong—across the glass, and the pane fogs with its presence.

Maren stumbles back.

The man doesn’t move. Doesn’t even look.

“They can’t come all the way through yet,” he says quietly. “Not unless you invite them.”

She shakes her head, eyes fixed on the thing outside.

“I didn’t—”

“But you will,” he says. “Eventually. That’s what this place does. It opens the door. Makes you curious enough to reach for the handle.”

The creature doesn’t press forward. It watches.

If it can watch.

Then it dissolves—not vanishing, but slipping away sideways. Like ink dragged across wet paper.

And it’s gone.

The man picks up something from the ground and hands it to her—a shard of the broken pane. The edges are dull now, but inside the glass: a swirl. A spiral, faint but there. Etched deep within.

“You’ll need this,” he says.

Maren stares at the spiral. It makes her skin crawl.

“What the hell is happening here?”

The man’s mouth twitches like he might smile. Or frown.

“That’s the wrong question.”

He walks past her, disappearing through the greenhouse door without a sound.

I've been experimenting with fasting and high-protein eating to try and lose weight—ideally, I'd like to drop 30kg as quickly as possible. I know that's a steep goal, and a lot of people have told me it's not realistic within the timeframe I was hoping for.

Still, I gave it a shot. I started with OMAD (one meal a day) and carnivore for three straight days. It was tough but manageable. After that, I pushed myself into my first extended fast. My goal was 72 hours, but I only made it to about 65 hours.

Honestly, I feel disappointed. Not just because I didn’t hit the full 72 hours, but because I felt *awful* the entire time. Everyone talks about how fasting can make you feel sharp, focused, and even energized—but that wasn't my experience at all. I was just plain miserable.

I stayed hydrated with water, lemon, tea, vinegar, and coffee. I also kept up with electrolytes. Still, I felt drained, foggy, and emotionally low. When I finally broke my fast with a high-fat, high-protein meal, I didn’t bounce back—I still felt terrible. And with two kids who need me present and functioning, I knew I couldn’t stay in that state. So I ended up eating pasta… and surprisingly, I felt *much* better after that. I even woke up the next day feeling okay.

So now I’m left wondering: What went wrong? Why didn’t I feel any of those “fasting highs” people talk about? Why did I feel so awful despite doing everything ""right""?

Right now, I’ve skipped breakfast and plan to stick with OMAD and carnivore again today. I’ve lost about 4kg this week, which is something… but I’m feeling hesitant about trying another long fast anytime soon.",1,1743859419.0,fasting,8,0.57,False

Example
So I’ve been meaning to replace a battery in a computer system for a bit now, but because of my OCD it’s preventing me. 
Why? 
It’s because I’m afraid of touching the battery and it leaking, now I have not even opened the system yet, so I don’t know if it even is. To make matters worse I don’t even touch my parents TV remotes because I’m afraid of the battery leaking.
Major triggers: In the past I did have a working remote that the battery did start leaking and every time I touched it I did wash my hands after, until opening it and discovering it. (10 years ago)
Now it’s worse due to a couple of tech jobs in the past where the battery in laptops vented or one that had moisture under the battery compartment (could have been coffee which that location). (2-3 years ago). 
You may think after leaving those two I would be fine, but nope I had a spot I hung my keypass on and now I feel that could be contaminated as well as anything I touched before reaching the shower.

* Feel broken-in (but not saggy)
* Hold up to frequent wear
* Pair easily with basics (tees, hoodies, casual shirts)
* And not cost a fortune

Curious — what do YOU look for in everyday denim?

* Fit? Fabric? Fade? Price?
* Any underrated brands or tips for styling?

Not homeless, got all 4 limbs BUT so what if I can't enjoy life regardless. CPTSD causing crushing bouts of prolonged severe anxiety turned out to be the last straw. BACK TO CLONAZEPAM (Klonopin).","Everyone either mention the two above, or having a family, or being able to get education...

...and I surely would appreciate, and DID appreciate life before...
...before repeated emotional trauma.
Additionally the exposure (a good non-pharm. coping/therapy method don't get me wrong!) was just a bit too far too soon and...messed me up even more.
I went through NINE semesters of med school 1.5 a year away from getting an M.D. title.
I broke down even more.

Alcohol makes my body feel poisoned, so I drowned my sorrows in benzos. Abused them.
Even though I MAY STILL GO BACK and FINISH...
I Broke down again, and again.

Started abusing both clonazepam and alprazolam but addiction to the latter for me was worse, because alprazolam (Xanax) lasts 4-5h and clonazepam (Klonopin Rivotril etc.) about 4 times as long.

My anxiety is all day-long and chronic but the trauma-related attacks of sheer panic are just soul crushing. Alprazolam won't do the trick because they can last for entire days.

I got diagnosed with ADHD in the meantime and by sheer miracle.
When I started failing med school due to anxiety making me a literal living mess, I got myself some Ritalin out of desperation for studying...kind of a forced ADHD diagnosis. A sin of mine that um paid off actually.

And thinking how it being a stimulant is basically the polar opposite of benzos these being CNS depressants or colloquially ""downers""...I was initially quite careful starting on 10mg.
Nothing.
Let's try 20mg said my doc a week after 10mg use.
""Ok"".

Dude. Helped my anxiety,
my depression,
my lack of energy and lethargic mindset,
 my boredom,
 my focus,
 my creativity...

Later down the line /a digresssion here/ it alleviated anxiety caused by XANAX WITHDRAWAL.
Then I paid attention and my strong black double Coffee slightly HELPS my anxiety too, unless I went further, but that's due to heart and BP obviously.

Took the tests, the funny simulated one, the questionare, evaluated by a psychologist/analyst...ADHD plain as day.

Later, my benzo habit got tapered, I got switched to Lyrica - pregabalin.
It worked wonders for generalized anxiety especially. 2 or 3 years and plop tolerance ruins all of it.
And 1200mg / 24h is no longer a medical dosing, and I get that.

Benzos got even more demonized than before but I had regretted so badly going overboard with them.

When Lyrica lost effectiveness...my main-line anxiolytic agent became...Ritalin. Or just methylphenidate as this was not the original formula.

I used twice as much methylphenidate as per doctors instructions.
When asked why - for anxiety, staggering the doses...since it fits with the dopamine fingers into my brain being a glove I could take 30mg instant release and go asleep.

But my new doc was kind enough to understand. Iost my will to seek new things educate myself make friends etc.
I'm 31. Sometimes I'm met with ""Ahh so young you shouldn't be taking such strong meds!""
When it comes to my own alley - that of mental anguish - that nearly drove me S. At worst point,
That caused me to become a chain smoker as first cig came a decade before getting Ritalin and never been able to quit - being at med school I got comments by my ""peers"", obviously,
and I may already be caring a mutation in my lower Airways up to 3 decades too soon...
...after my family members became distant as I'm a ""junkie"" if I plead for one medication that helps me function just-well-enough, and another that helps Save my sanity...

Doc gave me 2mg klonopin daily, dosed twice 1mg. Despite previous mistakes.
I'll never repeat them due to how much anguish this med can relieve. Never increase dose without asking psych doc. It's there and I already feel safer...
...which arrogant people will contribute to addiction despite having had a 3 year break, impossible physical aspect with mental diminished as if I F up and start abusing the med and chase that blasted dragon and eventually WILL have the med stopped forever - I wouldn't forgive myself

Currently 1mg - (5-6h) - 1mg considering clonazepam...

1. Pregabalin dropped from 1500mg daily to 900mg by using clonazepam for a week. Mind you, I'm V-E-R-Y dependent on this med. Goal is 600mg daily but at that point I'm fairly sure it won't work at all - and may quit altogether.

2. Methylphenidate (Ritalin) dropped from 108 mg [YEAH] (usually 40mg - 40mg - 28mg type deal immediate release 3h between doses).
Without propranolol additionally, (great nonaddictive med for somatic anxiety symptoms) hell my heart and BP would be too far...I wouldn't take it.
One week passed. From the average 108mg I went to 54mg daily taken in prolonged release formula.

So.
2mg of clonazepam dosed twice in 1mg doses for a week.

Results are,
1. Lyrica 1.5k mg /24h down by 600mg to 900mg
2. Ritalin used as per doctor's instruction. The abhorrent 108mg in spaced doses cut down by HALF into single 54mg XR formula. The Ritalin can now be used for ADHD proper and not handle ADHD AND anxiety disorders at once.

Hurr durr 2mg of clonazepam. Hurr durr BZD addict relapsing.


Humans and human life are too complicated to be put into 0 - 1ish labels of thinking.

My intention is by no means a glorification of clonazepam of benzos in general.

It's just that some people have less left to lose than meets the eye, and also, 5 years can give a lot to think through, mature, and maybe given how their lives are s*itty regardless and dose 2x max 24h medical max of two meds one no longer working another used off label due to necessity...

Well for me the effects are here. Once I go down to 600mg Lyrica daily so both meds are in medically allowed dose range..don't know.

The 2mg daily of clonazepam is 3 weeks tops but if things go messy and I start abusing another med, then clonazepam is back to action right away.

1js36yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1js36yg/the_mug_wasnt_hers_but_she_kept_it_anyway/,"The Mug Wasn’t Hers, But She Kept It Anyway","He left in spring.

The kind of spring that still smelled like winter. Where the mornings carried frost, and the sun came late, as if it didn’t want to show up for either of them.

He didn’t shout. Didn’t cry. Didn’t even explain.

He just started talking about distance like it was something they could survive— as if space wouldn’t eventually hollow everything out.

She knew better. And still, she let him go like he was just late for something. A train. A job. A better version of himself.

The apartment didn't collapse. It just... quieted.

Drawers still opened. The fridge still hummed. His toothbrush stayed in the cup for six days before she moved it—not out of grief, but because it started to rot from disuse.

The only thing she couldn’t throw away was the mug. A dumb, white ceramic joke from a place she’d never been.

*World’s Okayest Brother*.

It didn’t match anything. She had better mugs. Prettier ones. Ones that didn’t remind her of long drives in silence and songs they both half-sang out of tune.

But those mugs made her feel like she was starting over. And she wasn’t ready for that lie.

She drank from it every morning.

Not because she was stuck. Not because she wanted to wallow.

But because there was a kind of strength in choosing to remember. To say: *Yes. That happened. Yes. He loved me once. And yes—it ended.* And not flinch.

Some days, she almost forgot to reach for it. Those were the scariest.

Because healing, real healing, didn’t look like moving on.

It looked like forgetting without trying to. Like waking up and not immediately thinking about where he would’ve parked. Like seeing something funny and not needing to send it to him.

It looked like freedom—but felt like amputation.

So she drank from the mug.

She didn’t cry while doing it. Didn’t stare out the window, waiting for something cinematic.

She just sat. Took her coffee. Let the warmth bleed into her palms. And whispered, *“Good morning.”*

Not to him. Not to the mug.

To the version of herself that was still alive inside that ritual. The version that chose to remember without needing to forgive.

The version strong enough to say:

*“This is mine now. Even if it never was.”*

He said it like it was a favor.

“I think it’s better if I go. I don’t want to make this harder than it already is.”

And she nodded. Because she’d heard that tone before. Because when people leave you the right way, they think they’re doing you a kindness.

What he didn’t know was: There is no right way to abandon someone who still wants to be chosen.

She didn’t argue. She just packed what he didn’t think to take. She folded the hoodie he’d left on the chair and put it in the basket by the door. She lined his books up like a librarian trying to make sense of someone else’s library. She made it clean.

Because order felt like ownership.

She couldn’t keep him. But she could keep the way he left. She could choose what stayed behind. And so—she kept the mug.

It wasn’t love. It wasn’t a souvenir. It wasn’t a mistake.

It was proof.

That someone once left something behind *without asking for it back*.

She grew up in houses that weren’t hers. Foster homes with plastic forks and rooms where her name was misspelled on the bedroom door.

She was the “quiet one.” Which really meant *the one they didn’t notice until she broke something.*

Toys were borrowed. Clothes were inherited. Nothing stayed hers long enough to feel like it mattered.

Even the few gifts she got were barbed:

“Don’t lose it.”  
  


“That costs money.”  
  


“Be grateful.”  
  


Nothing was a gift. Everything was a test.

So when she was sixteen, she stopped asking. Stopped hoping.

Started collecting tiny things people wouldn’t notice were gone:

A lighter with no fuel  
  


A single earring from a pair she never wore  
  


A ribbon from a gift someone else received  
  


Worthless things. But they were hers.

She made a kingdom of discarded objects—a shrine of things nobody loved enough to keep.

Because maybe, if they didn’t want them, they wouldn’t take them back. And maybe, just maybe, that meant they wouldn’t take *her* back either.

So when he left—and forgot the mug— she picked it up like it had weight.

And when the lamp flickered that night, and she cried, and she whispered *“This is mine now”*— she wasn’t talking about the mug.

She was talking to every voice that had ever taken something from her and called it love.

She was saying:

*You don’t get to take this too.*

*You don’t get to make this hurt and then take the proof with you.*

*You don’t get to make me invisible again.*

She keeps it still. Not because she misses him. Not because she needs the ritual.

But because the mug never looked her in the eye and said:

*“You don’t deserve to keep anything.”*

1js36lp,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1js36lp/was_trying_to_back_out_of_a_group_ended_up_losing/,"Was trying to back out of a group, ended up losing the one I wanted to keep","For about 15 years I worked a  job and made this small friend group, we called coffee club. There was Paul (45), Monica (41), Laura (41) and myself (46). Every Friday all four of us would go get coffee together once we all got to work. We'd hang out and chat for an hour or two and then go back. Occasionally others would join us, but it was usually just us 4. During the week, I could count on going and grabbing a cup from Starbucks with Laura. Sometime Monica would come, but usually not. At lunch the 3 of us, Laura, Monica and I would go for a walk around downtown just to get some fresh air and stretch our legs. 

This was a great way to spend time together. I got real close with Monica and Laura. We went to Laura's wedding. They supported me when my wife miscarried and were 2 of the biggest cheerleaders when we finally had our 1st. We helped Monica through her fertility issues.  We all supported Paul when his parents passed. Point is, we were friends.

Ok some details about them. Paul, while he never came out and said it, is from money. He went to small private schools, and has no loans from them. Travels a lot, like when I met him he had been to twice as many countries as his age, and goes to a new one at least 2x a year. He left our professional, public sector job to work part time at a global corporation that will give him a cushy place to stay in his travels. No kids and his wife supports his lifestyle.

Monica may have middle or upper middle background, but is married to a high earning middle manager from a global energy company. They spend like money pours out of the faucet. 

Laura is a little more down to earth. I was probably closest to her because our kids are the same ages. However, she is exactly what people should think of when they say western standards of beauty. This caused her a lot of friction at work, and was tough for us because people made assumptions about us that were just not true. She married a doctor and they live the affluent lifestyle. 

I am not white. I come from a very blue collar background. I struggled getting into a role i wanted at that agency because I got hired into facilities and they ""had trouble seeing me as anything but"" even though I had my MS and other experience. Try as hard as I could, I didn't connect with anyone except those 3. And at that age I was desperate for friends outside of my marriage. 

Anyway things were going OK when the pandemic happened. These were the people we kept in our circle. The the protests. It made things kinda tense. Laura was awesome. Reached out, was supportive. Paul and Monica went dark. Didn't hear much from them at all. No worries, we all got things to deal with.

Then I got a different job. Left the agency for something that fit me personally and I didn't have to fight stereotypes. And local government is so much less stress than federal. I am happy, Paul is working his thing so it's just the 2 ladies left at the agency so we don't meet up as often. But I notice a shit with Paul and Monica, they start acting and talking more exclusive about money matters. It's hard to explain unless you've been the only minority in a group. Point is, there is a rift growing between me and them.

Last year I meet up with Laura and I tell her I am going to step back from the group. I want to stay friends but I just am not connecting with them anymore. She is sad about it but assures me we are still good. A couple of months later she stops responding to my texts. No kids play dates,  no nothing. 

I get it. I started the split because I wasn't comfortable anymore, but I thought I could keep the friend I was closest with. And i understand that with this administration it sucks to be a federal employee right now. But even my attempts to reach out about that are going without a response. 

Now I'm just sad. And kinda lonely. I have my groups and kids and wife. I just miss my friend.

This is especially true if you have a strong desire to master a craft and have high ambitions. To some, perfectionism is so insidious that they're completely paralyzed by the fear of making the slightest mistake.

Perfectionism is known to be one of the most common trauma responses but nowadays it's so ingrained in everyone's psyches, perhaps because of how narcissistic our culture has become, that it's rare to find someone who feels truly content with life and at peace with who they are.

I grappled with perfectionistic tendencies my whole life and for years it prevented me from truly expressing myself, daring to take risks, developing my talents, and going for what I really wanted in life. Because of this devilish voice constantly telling me I was never good enough, I almost gave up on my dreams several times.

Now, we'll discuss the origins of perfectionism and then explore how to finally overcome this internal demon.

# Perfectionism Explained



Simply put, the root cause of perfectionism is connected to an external sense of self-worth and attaching our self-esteem to our performance and results. In other words, our sense of value is directly correlated to our grades, our performance at work and how much money we make, with our titles and accomplishments, being the smartest person, executing the perfect morning routine, or having the healthiest habits.

In summary, our sense of value is always based on what other people think about us and how well we can do anything. Taking one step further, high levels of perfectionism are also usually connected with having experienced a lot of shame.

When we don't feel loved and accepted by the people who matter the most, usually our parents, we tend to compensate by fabricating an immaculate persona. We have the childish belief that if we somehow can become perfect, we'll finally be accepted.

In that sense, perfectionism becomes a strategy to earn love and not be abandoned. In this process, we tend to forsake who we truly are and our authentic desires, and start operating based on what we believe will give us the most validation, or at least avoid frustrations.

We learn that love is always conditional and it's dependent on our performance, that's why we start conflating real love with validation. The root cause of these tendencies tends to be an unresolved mother and father complex but since I already have a [full series](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1if7vef/conquer_the_puer_aeternus_and_puella_aeterna/) on it, I won't go into detail here.

Now, I don't want to reduce everything to having experienced some sort of parental trauma since perfectionism can also be amplified by experiences such as bullying, comparison between siblings, cultural standards, environments that foster competition, and also by individual tendencies.

Moreover, I find that if you have a strong desire to master a craft and have high ambitions, it's impossible not to grapple with perfectionism since we're always pushing to reach the next level. But ironically, perfectionism is the greatest enemy in the pursuit of achieving excellence.

We have the illusion that these impossibly high standards will keep us motivated and safe but the problem is that underneath we're always afraid of failure. Then, we stop taking creative risks and experimenting with new things.

But because of this intolerance to making mistakes, we also stop learning. We start expecting to be great at everything on the first try. We forget that everything has a learning curve and that we'll suck in the beginning. However, enduring the learning process is one of the greatest skills we can learn if we want to master any craft.

Each new level demands that we maintain a beginner's mindset and detach our sense of value from our performance. Otherwise, we'll never feel content and will constantly dismiss our accomplishments. Forget about feeling any kind of joy when performing what you love the most.

Perfectionism turns everything into the ultimate contest. I remember when I first started lifting, I had this crazy idea that I had to start living and performing like an athlete. If I didn't follow my program and diet with absolute perfection, I'd feel like shit.

At the beginning of the pandemic (are we allowed to use this word again?), I got into specialty coffee. I started watching every video I could because I wanted to be just like James Hoffman, haha. I was researching all of this equipment and what was just a hobby started to feel like work once again.

It's crazy, but perfectionism robs us of the joy of doing something just because we like it. We feel guilty for not spending our time constantly being productive or at least learning something useful. But I find there's another way of accomplishing our goals without relying on self-loathing.  


# The Unheard Solution



One of the main factors to overcome perfectionism is learning how to unlock intrinsic motivation. In other words, we have to learn how to do things because we enjoy them rather than look good for other people, receive validation, or avoid some kind of pain.

We have to do things out of our own volition regardless of external pressure, that's exactly where the flow state enters. The moment we feel locked in and completely in the zone, are also the moments we tend to find the most enjoyment.

We get transported to another plane, worries about the external world vanish, and we get completely lost in the activity. When I'm playing music, I feel like my hands are moving by themselves. The same thing happens when I'm writing, the gap between my thoughts and typing them disappears. The sentences just flow.

The enjoyment of being fully immersed in this state is exactly what disrupts perfectionism. We unlock this deep desire to do something just because we enjoy it and what other people think stops mattering so much.

But for it to happen, we must create a safe space, preferably with an activity that has nothing to do with our profession. The best ones always demand creativity and being active with our bodies.

One of the greatest obstacles is inverting our values from always expecting perfection to allowing our creativity to be fully expressed. In the beginning, you'll notice yourself trying to get it right but you have to approach this with a beginner's mindset and knowing that the main objective is to find enjoyment and learning to express yourself. Of course, eventually you'll want to get good in this activity but this can't come to the detriment of experiencing flow.

Here's an example, many of my clients take up drawing and start following courses. The little devil of perfectionism will constantly tell you to focus strictly on technique and making things right. That's why I always advise them to set half the time to technique and the other half to experimenting and free-flowing.

If you deal with high levels of perfectionism, you probably have a hard expressing your feelings and emotions as well. That's why the main objective is learning to express what's in your soul and not look good for others. You have to stop trying to be like Picasso or Van Gogh and accept your own unique voice.

This practice will help you symbolize and make concrete what's in your unconscious and shadow side. Here's a timely moment to remember that the shadow isn't made of only undesirable qualities and often our gifts and talents are repressed.

By creating this safe place and engaging in these practices, we can finally start accepting our positive shadow again. Carl Jung also explains this process in terms of working with the inferior function and integrating the [animus and anima](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1he1msm/the_definitive_animus_and_anima_guide_not_about/). Also, Jung's terminology for the flow state is “numinous experiences”. But I digress.

Over time, you'll expand your emotional vocabulary and learn to communicate better. Not only that, by taking creative risks and daring to do things you've never done, you'll notice yourself more relaxed. You'll realize that you won't die by making mistakes.

Experiencing flow helps us diminish impossible high standards, especially when it's transported to other areas of our lives and professions. Over time, a huge shift happens, our lives stop being dictated by the public opinion and we're finally free to be who we are.

The quest for perfection is replaced by a great respect for our crafts and the desire to excel. Not for other people, but because this makes us feel alive. And when we put our talents in service of other people, our lives also acquire meaning and purpose.

**PS**: I expand this process of overcoming the mother and father complex and finding meaning through Flow in the third chapter of my book **PISTIS - Demystifying Jungian Psychology**.

Of course, eventually you'll want to get good in this activity but this can't come to the detriment of experiencing flow.

Here's an example, many of my clients take up drawing and start following courses. The little devil of perfectionism will constantly tell you to focus strictly on technique and making things right. That's why I always advise them to set half the time to technique and the other half to experimenting and free-flowing.

If you deal with high levels of perfectionism, you probably have a hard expressing your feelings and emotions as well. That's why the main objective is learning to express what's in your soul and not look good for others. You have to stop trying to be like Picasso or Van Gogh and accept your own unique voice.

This practice will help you symbolize and make concrete what's in your unconscious and shadow side. Here's a timely moment to remember that the shadow isn't made of only undesirable qualities and often our gifts and talents are repressed.

By creating this safe place and engaging in these practices, we can finally start accepting our positive shadow again. Carl Jung also explains this process in terms of working with the inferior function and integrating the [animus and anima](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jung/comments/1he1msm/the_definitive_animus_and_anima_guide_not_about/). Also, Jung's terminology for the flow state is “numinous experiences”. But I digress.

Over time, you'll expand your emotional vocabulary and learn to communicate better. Not only that, by taking creative risks and daring to do things you've never done, you'll notice yourself more relaxed. You'll realize that you won't die by making mistakes.

Experiencing flow helps us diminish impossible high standards, especially when it's transported to other areas of our lives and professions. Over time, a huge shift happens, our lives stop being dictated by the public opinion and we're finally free to be who we are.

The quest for perfection is replaced by a great respect for our crafts and the desire to excel. Not for other people, but because this makes us feel alive. And when we put our talents in service of other people, our lives also acquire meaning and purpose.

**PS**: I expand this process of overcoming the mother and father complex and finding meaning through Flow in the third chapter of my book **PISTIS - Demystifying Jungian Psychology**.

1js32c4,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1js32c4/aita_for_constantly_asking_my_sister_to_repay_me/,AITA For constantly asking my sister to repay me,"Earlier in the week my (22F) sister and I (22F) ordered Uber Eats which I paid for. Today, I was doing an Amazon order, and my sister asked if I could get her something in the order. I asked her to send me the £15, and she got really angry at me for asking her to send such a little amount of money – and said I should just pay it for her. She was really condescending and made me feel awful about it.

This has always been a sensitive spot for her – we've had a lot of arguments about this in the past. For reference as well – I'm a student and working a part-time minimum wage job. Money is a HUGE anxiety point for me, and she is very aware of this. She is unemployed, yes, but has been out of Uni for almost a year and has not had a job this whole time as she's been travelling. And, maybe this is a low blow – but she also has a boyfriend with a well-paying job who pays for a lot of her social outings (drinks, food, a few clothing pieces, etc.)

This has happened a lot in the past: once I ended up paying for her and her friends' drinks, around £30 on my sister and her friend – they were asking me to. I texted my sister the total and asked her to send it to her friend – she said she would. A week goes by, I ask again, she says she will. She ends up telling me that she told her friend I'd cover it, as it was EMBARRASSING that I would be chasing people up for such a little amount of money. And she refused to pay me back or tell her friend. Swallowed those costs.

Again – at our birthday party last year, we agreed that we would split the basic costs for food and drinks. I bought a lot of the alcohol that her friends drank. Day after the party, when I asked her to transfer me £100, she said that it was 'in the past now', and she didn't want to spend any more money on the party. I had to get my MOTHER involved. She had a fuss, said I was crazy, etc.

I know it's stingy to ask people to pay you back. I probably wouldn't have asked her to pay me back if it was just the food or the Amazon order. I promise I'm not someone who asks someone to transfer me £3. But this stuff ADDS UP – and the anxiety I get from thinking about how many £10 or £15 I've spent here or there that does not get returned back to me in any way is crazy. Money has a LOT of value to me, especially in this climate where costs are high and wages are low. Sorry if I don't want to offer two hours' worth of work to you. I'm happy to buy my friends a coffee and not expect it in return, and I would never get angry at someone for asking me to transfer them for something – unless it was something I didn't ask for or even like £1.50 (which someone has done to me, and I STILL did it). The shaming and the gaslighting are infuriating me, and it's not just £15, it's £15 on top of everything else I've bought for her that doesn't get returned back.

I don't know. I know everyone thinks of money differently, but this is how I feel, and I kind of feel I have to put my foot down on this. Am I the asshole?",5,1743858508.0,AmItheAsshole,26,0.86,False

I’ve been working on this story for a year and a half now, and I got it to a point I felt confident to submit, but I’m hearing nothing but rejections from agents and have no idea where to go from here. I’ve studied query letters and how they should be written, but keep finding myself at dead ends. 

This is my query letter I’ve been using, any feedback would be so helpful, I believe in this story so much and I’m willing to do anything to get it seen. Removed names for privacy reasons. 

————————————————————————

Dear [Agent’s Name],

Twelve year old Milly Roberts has always felt like a background character in her own life. Nerdy, adopted, and more comfortable in the pages of a book than in the real world. 

But inside those books, she’s a hero, and no hero inspires her more than Moonflower Jones, the fearless warrior from her father’s bestselling fantasy series.

When Milly accidentally brings Moonflower to life, she thinks she’s finally found her place. Her idol is real, and they’re going to have epic adventures together! 

But Moonflower is horrified to learn she was created by Milly’s father and all her struggles and battles were never real. Enraged, Moonflower sets out to rewrite her own reality and escape her fate. 

Soon, creatures from her books spill into Milly’s world, bringing chaos and destruction with them.

If Milly doesn’t stop Moonflower, her town will be destroyed and her family erased forever. But standing against her childhood hero means accepting that real courage isn’t about being fearless. Milly must embrace her flaws and find the hero within herself before Moonflower writes her out for good.

MY HERO MOONFLOWER is a 52K middle-grade fantasy that blends the magical realism and coming of age themes of The Midnight Children with the heart and adventure of Eva Evergreen, Semi-Magical Witch. 

As a finalist in the BBC New Comedy Awards 2023 and a performer on Series 3 of Rosie Jones’ Disability Comedy Extravaganza, I draw on my experiences growing up care-experienced and disabled to infuse my work with humour, heart, and strong resilience.

I have attached a sample for your review. Thank you for your time and consideration, I look forward to the possibility of discussing MY HERO MOONFLOWER with you.

Best regards,
(my name)

————————————————————————

Most kids dream of being famous, but me? 

I swing swords at fire breathing dragons in kingdoms only I can see. There, I’m the fearless Moonflower Jones, hero of The Forgotten Realms.

Though here at Sir Arthur Primary School, I’m just Milly Roberts, with crayon freckles smudged across my cheeks and mousy brown hair like a burst couch.

When I was little, Dad wrote Moonflower just for me. Back then, he was home enough to read it every night. 

‘For my brave little adventurer,’ the dedication said. 

I used to trace the words with my finger, like they were proof I still existed. When he was off on book tours or shut away in his office, Moonflower was the part of him that stayed. After a few visits to the headmaster, I wasn’t allowed to bring it to school anymore, but Mum and Dad didn’t know that. 

Funny thing about Dad’s office, the silly old man thinks it’s locked. After a few bruised knees, I learned that a firm twist and a wee shove was all it took to pop it open! 

Last night, I’d waited until I heard the low hum of Dad’s late-night typing. His usual rhythm of “tap tap… pause… mutter something under his breath… tap tap tappity tap.”

That was my cue. I slipped inside, tiptoed past the piles of papers and coffee cups, and went straight for the bookshelf.

There it was. The Adventures of Moonflower Jones.

The air screamed. Not like a breeze, more like the book knew I was coming. Which, okay, creepy. 

My hands tingled as I clutched it tighter. Heat rushed my face and my chest was a balloon about to burst.

It wasn’t stealing. Not really. Besides, I’m twelve, that’s way too young for jail. ",2,1743858367.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False

1js2zs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1js2zs4/omg_the_db_sub_has_500_k_subscribers_and_3_year/,OMG the DB sub has 500 K subscribers and 3 year post divorce update,"I (46/F) used to post here a LOT starting about 8 years ago.  I had been in a dead bedroom for almost 20 years at that point and I was starting to have a nervous breakdown over it.  At that time the sub only had about 50,000 and was somehow more interactive despite having a lot fewer subs.  I wrote and corresponded with a lot of people at that time.  This sub gets a lot of shit for being ""toxic"" but generally, divorcing over a DB is verboten, being upset over a DB is verboten, there's no one to talk to about it in the first place, and if you haven't been there you really won't understand otherwise.   I don't really write with people on Reddit anymore, the only person I write to is someone I met on r/fragrance where we talk about perfume and nothing more.  

 I made a holy shit the sub is up to 100 K about 6 years ago.  Now here we are at 500 K subs.  Don't worry r/Nails and r/instant_regret and r/boltedontits are still a LOT bigger.  

I've kept this ID because it's served as a chronicle and a journal for what happened when I had a nervous breakdown over the end of my marriage, and the end of my life as I knew it!  Twenty years of a DB and finally having it come to a head will do that to you.  I couldn't eat, drink, sleep, or concentrate for over a year, maybe longer.  Only good thing that came of it was I lost a bit of weight and was blissfully skinny (covid and menopause put about 15 ponds on me subsequently, so that side effect didn't last forever.)  Divorce really is like a death.  It's the death of your future, your partner, your life as you knew it.  It's psychologically derailing.  I can't even describe how horrible it is to go through, and I had an ""amicable"" divorce.  God knows how people with acrimonious divorces actually go through it.  

My marriage over the DB derailed for nearly 5 years until I finally got it together enough to divorce.  I was already moved out, in another state, and living separately from my husband.  I still wore my wedding band, we spoke every day, and saw each other weekly during our 2 year long separation.  Eventually it was now or never, I sobbed and drank my way through it, and luckily I lived in a state where once I got the ball rolling it only took 2 months.  No 1 year or anything like that.  It was one of the few times of my life where I was happy to go to work every day and really put the whole thing on the backburner.  I still couldn't really breathe when it was time to actually sign the papers.  I did it though by sheer force of will.  

Three years ago on April 4 of 2022 I was legally divorced, and I finally took off my wedding band.  I didn't feel much better.  It took another two years to recover from actually divorcing.  Two years before I started to gradually, slowly, feel more normal and not in a sense of waking grief and guilt and shame and loss.  I couldn't even say the words ""divorced"" or ""EX husband"" or anything like that out loud, it was just too much.  There was so much so process and so much work to do it just took forever.  

It sucks having your first break up be a divorce at 42 but there I was.  I had no way or means or experience of dealing with it.  

I guess it was for the best to put myself through that.  I can say I feel better than I did during the really horrible days at the end of the marriage, and that counts for something.  I couldn't even breathe at the end.  Now I feel more like myself, and when I think of how bad and crazy I was, I feel relief that I actually went through with it.  

My ex husband and I are still best friends and I think we've forgiven each other (for the most part.  Some things are difficult.  I was not perfect either.)  We text every day, see each other once or twice a month, and talk on the phone once a week.  I can't help it, I'm a loyal person what can I say.  He's the only person I've been with, and truly a good friend.  I've asked if he wanted a break, or even not to speak to me, and he said no.  

I guess the only update is that I feel better.  What's happened in the meantime?  Oh I moved to another state right when Covid locked down so that was a strange experience.  I did buy a house before the market went bonkers so that was a stroke a of luck.  I'm going through menopause which is the poisonous barbed monkey wrench of hell that is ruining my life on the daily.  My ex still lives in our old house.  I still have my dog and he goes back and forth between us.  We are heading for a major recession and I'm worried I'll have to retire into my car.  I've already lived in my new city for 5 years and it feels familiar, and homeish, but I know I will not live here forever.  I made a few work friends, and there's a few places I like to get coffee and such. Over the years on this sub it seems only the women who leave DB's are okay going solo, and I inadvertantly am one of them.  Once you are not ""trapped"" you feel like you can breathe again.  I've never dated in my life and I'm not one of those people who just have relationships fall into their lap.  

Having lived through the whole DB thing for so long and having it derail my entire existence is such a strange thing in hindsight.  I do not regret getting married, but sometimes I wish I had really known how it was going to affect me later on.  I had an extreme case (Day 1 DB, best friends marriage otherwise, all that) and now at age 46 I can't believe how fast time is going.  I'll be 50 years old in a few years!  Where is the time?  I am more concerned with job security, housing, and my own health. I guess when you get older your priorities change.  Also, when your household income gets cut in half, on the double the bills on half the income plan, your priorities DEFINITELY change lol.  

Anyway happy 500 K.  It's not a great place to be in and I sympathize with a lot of you.  Good luck, no matter what you decide to do.  ",9,1743858286.0,DeadBedrooms,2,1.0,False

Here’s what pet parents should know:

# 🐕 Common Causes of Head Shaking in Dogs

# 🦠 Ear Infections 

The #1 culprit! Caused by an overgrowth of yeast or bacteria, often triggered by allergies, moisture, or ear shape (we see you, floppy-eared dogs). If your dog’s ear smells funky or has discharge, it’s time for a vet visit.

# 🌾 Allergies (Food & Environmental) 

Itchy ears from allergies can make dogs shake their heads frequently. Food allergies (think: chicken, beef, dairy, wheat) or environmental triggers like pollen and dust are common causes.

# 🐜 Parasites 

Ear mites are especially common in puppies and can cause black, coffee-ground-like debris in the ears. They're super itchy and contagious—especially in multi-pet households.

# 🌿 Foreign Bodies (like foxtails) 

If your dog starts violently shaking their head all of a sudden, they may have something stuck in their ear. Grass seeds and debris from a romp outside can lodge in the ear canal and need immediate attention.

# 🧬 Skin Conditions 

Mange, flea allergy dermatitis, insect bites, or even breed-specific conditions like ear margin seborrhea can affect the ears and cause discomfort.

# 🕯️ Excess Earwax 

Some breeds (like Cocker Spaniels or Bulldogs) just produce more wax, which can trap moisture and lead to infections.

# 🩺 When to Worry

Head shaking is a normal reflex—but persistent, sudden, or intense shaking paired with symptoms like:

* Redness or swelling  
* Odor or discharge  
* Scratching or pawing at ears  
* Loss of balance or appetite  

...means it’s vet time! 🚨

# 💡 What You Can Do

* Get a diagnosis first. Don't guess—your vet can pinpoint the cause with ear swabs, skin scrapings, allergy testing, and more.
* Use proper ear cleaning techniques. Skip the Q-tips! Clean with vet-approved solutions and always reward your dog afterward.
* Maintain year-round flea and tick prevention. This helps avoid both parasites and allergic reactions.
* Try a probiotic. Believe it or not, gut health is linked to skin and allergy health. Probiotics can support the immune system.
* Avoid table scraps and known allergens. Especially if food sensitivities are suspected—elimination diets can help identify triggers.
* Check ears regularly. Make ear checks a part of your routine grooming. Early signs are easier (and cheaper!) to treat.

**Fun Fact:** The shake reflex helps dogs remove water, dirt, and irritants from their ears—like a built-in spin cycle. But when it’s happening *constantly*, it's their way of telling you something’s not right.

I really think there's a lot of places to be our third spaces. Yes, it costs to get around and for many free time is a luxury. For me, making the time and effort has been life-changing. I plan my week around my time outs. 

I visit the local library with my kid often. The kids area has little benches, lots to read and lots to play with. While he's busy I can get some reading done myself or study. I've visited with a friend along and had 2 hours to chat while we watched our kids, for free and comfortably. 

We visited the kzn museum in PMB last week, great fun. Met our friends there and had a nice afternoon walking the exhibits with our kids in tow. 

I visit the public pool regularly, I've paid for the months in summer (120 rand for the month) and now that it's cold I pay per visit, it's 18 rand to enter for the day where i live. Sometimes I drag friends along to do laps together, sometimes there's other swimmers to chat with. Usually it's empty except for the lifesaving club and some pensioners. 

I've spent hours trawling antiques and second hand shops in town in Durban.

I took my kid to the new humble coffee this week.

KZNSA art gallery is free to enter and often has evening events. 

I've also got into the habit of picking up stuff to read when I have time to use up at a bargain books or exclusive books depending which mall we're at. Most of them have somewhere to sit. 

Also to add, the shongweni market and the iheart market and market031.

Obviously I can't do this all at once. Maybe I can only make time for one of these things to happen once in a while or once every two weeks, except for the library we visit often (walking distance from home).

All of these are free or cost a minimal amount, safe and fun :) I love knowing I don't have to spend money everywhere we go.

They do fit nicely. I can’t really make them work though. I‘m very close to burr touch and I still have super fast shots (20gr in 60 out in under 15sec at 6 bar peak pressure. Mind that I use a Weber unibasket which is fast). 
I never had these issues with the stock burrs or the gorilla gear 64mm burrs I had inside before. I did season the burrs with a little bit more than a kilo but that didn’t really do anything. I tried to align them and got a somewhat decent alignment. Yet same issue. I also used higher shims to accommodate for the height difference of the original and these burrs. It didn’t help. 

Does anyone have similar experiences? Do they need more seasoning? I didn’t expect them to deliver peak performance after ~1kg but at least they shouldn’t be awful. They do channel a lot (never really had that problems before). They don’t even taste good. Less flavour and bitter finish. 

I decided to give them a try after reading coffee chronicler’s review. They shouldn’t have any trouble with espresso grind size and he also described the taste as very balanced. Mine are neither balanced nor really espresso capable. I might get a longer shot at burr touch but I wouldn’t really call that espresso range then. 
Anyone with similar experiences here? Do they simply need more seasoning? Is there something I missed or did I simply got a flawed model?

1js2r1j,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreserveThatFood/comments/1js2r1j/how_vacuum_sealing_keeps_food_fresh_longer/,How Vacuum Sealing Keeps Food Fresh Longer,"# Chef's Guide: How Vacuum Sealing Revolutionizes Food Preservation (with Science!)

Hey fellow food enthusiasts! Professional chef here. After 15+ years in restaurant kitchens, I've become evangelical about vacuum sealing - a technique that extends food shelf life up to **5 times longer** while preserving flavors that would otherwise fade. Let me break down why this method is transformative for both home cooks and pros alike.

## The Science: Why Oxygen is Food's Enemy

That innocent oxygen molecule? It's actually the culprit behind most food spoilage. Here's what happens:

* Oxygen fuels aerobic bacteria and mold growth
* It triggers oxidation (making fats rancid)
* It activates enzymes causing browning in fruits and vegetables

When you vacuum seal, you create an anaerobic environment where these spoilage mechanisms simply can't function. It's like pressing pause on the decomposition process!

## The Game-Changing Benefits of Vacuum Sealing

* **Extended freshness:** Foods stay fresh 3-5× longer than conventional storage
* **Preserved flavor & texture:** Natural qualities remain intact without moisture loss
* **Reduced waste:** Less spoilage means significant reduction in food waste
* **Better freezer storage:** Prevents freezer burn by eliminating air pockets
* **Enhanced sous vide cooking:** Creates perfect packages for precision cooking

## What Foods Benefit Most from Vacuum Sealing?

| Food Category | Normal Storage Life | Vacuum Sealed Life | Notes |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|-------|
| Meat & Fish | 6-12 months (frozen) | 1-3 years (frozen) | Prevents freezer burn completely |
| Hard Cheeses | 1-2 weeks | 4-8 weeks | Maintains texture without mold |
| Dry Goods (rice, nuts, coffee) | 3-6 months | 2-3 years | Preserves flavor compounds |
| Fruits & Vegetables | 1-2 weeks | Up to 5 weeks | Pre-freeze soft items before sealing |

**Not recommended for:** Soft cheeses, mushrooms, fresh garlic, and delicate herbs (the pressure damages their structure).

## Essential Equipment for Successful Vacuum Sealing

As a chef, I recommend investing in:

1. A quality countertop vacuum sealer (FoodSaver and Weston are reliable brands)
2. Heavy-duty vacuum bags/rolls (get BPA-free ones suitable for freezing and sous vide)
3. Jar attachments for dry goods storage
4. Container attachments for marinating and storing delicate items

## Pro Chef Techniques for Maximum Effectiveness

* **Pre-freeze soft or moist foods** before sealing to prevent crushing and liquid extraction
* **Leave 3 inches of headspace** when sealing items for freezing (liquids expand!)
* **Double-seal edges** on high-value items like premium meats
* **Always label with contents AND date** - trust me, you won't remember what it is in 3 months
* **Clean the sealing strip** after each use to ensure perfect seals every time

For meats specifically: pat dry before sealing. Moisture is the enemy of a good seal!

## Why This Matters: A Chef's Perspective

In my kitchen, vacuum sealing means I can buy premium ingredients in bulk during peak season, preserve them at their best, and enjoy them months later. I've vacuum sealed everything from freshly caught salmon to summer berries, and the difference in quality preservation is remarkable.

Beyond the practical benefits, there's something deeply satisfying about opening a vacuum sealed package of food you preserved at its prime and finding it almost identical to the day you sealed it. It's like time travel for your ingredients!

I have combination skin and I’ve struggled with acne in the past. Before this I used CeraVe Hydrating Face Wash and CeraVe Daily Moisturizer in the morning and evening, with Clindamycin (AM) and Tretinoin (PM every other day) used respectively. My skin really hasn’t been changing, I have noticed a decrease in frequency of pimples, but I feel like I always have at least one pimple. Then recently I decided to stop drinking coffee, and to start washing my face in the morning with water only. I’m not sure which habit change it was, but my skin has been looking a lot less irritated and red. My acne scars aren’t as prominent and my skin looks more smooth. 

However, over the past couple of days I have been getting a couple of more pimples than usual. They aren’t big and taking over and they aren’t particularly irritated either. But there is one here and there on my face, one on my chin, one on my cheek, two on my left eyebrow. But again they aren’t really inflamed or anything. So I was wondering if I could get some help if anybody thinks that this could be from washing my face with only water in the morning, and if it is just the beginning of a breakout or if it is a good sign of purging or something like that. 

I am also wondering if cutting out the coffee is what made my skin less inflamed, and that washing my face with just water is only going to make it worse.

TL;DR - I stopped drinking coffee and started washing my face with water only in the morning. My skin looks clearer and less inflamed, but now I have a couple more pimples than usual (not particularly inflamed either). Is this a sign of purging or a breakout? Is it like the coffee or the washing with water is the cause of my skin looking better?",1,1743857349.0,SkincareAddiction,2,1.0,False

It feels like we're in some digital golden age atm. Just looking at people on Twitter/Reddit, the energy and enthusiasm to create is so palpable. Anything is possible! Anyone else here feel the same way?

I'm looking for other solopreneurs in Sydney, AU to connect with. Keen to chat with anyone from any experience level. It can be as easy as chatting over coffee or sharing some thoughts/experiences, to keeping each other accountable or sharing progress updates with each other. Also happy to meet anyone virtually via text/video.

Feel free to comment here and I'll DM you!

**About me**:
I'm 25 M. Was working in a FAANG company for about 2 years until I decided to resign. Doing this **no next job lined** and in a bad market was quite a leap of faith. I just felt such a strong urge to go out there and create something of my own. I wanted to explore more of the world (in terms of technology) in this stage of my life.

I have virtually zero experience making my own product or selling to customers on my own. I do have proficiency in TypeScript/Python/web-dev. I also believe I’m highly resourceful and I’m driven to make this whole thing work. Other passions include PKM and learning new things as efficiently as possible. 

You can find me at the NSW State Library most days from afternoon - closing time. Currently, I'm working on an AI Obsidian plugin with plans to take alpha users soon.

i’m just curious if anyone can speak on this. 

for context, i have a BA in Sociology w a minor in Law. had plans to do law school after, but now i’m reassessing cause 
• work life balance 
• student debt
• potentially making a check off struggling people 
etc. 
i looked into potentially doing paralegal instead, or some type of legal admin. 

so i’ve taken a huge break, did a fuck ton of travelling and worked many different jobs. mostly bartending, but i also taught english at one point, office jobs, dog day care, coffee shops, you name it. 

in many of the jobs i worked i dealt with / witnessed sexual harassment, unfair treatment, power trips, bigot bosses who had filing cabinets worth of complaints and nothing done about it. i’ve always been one to call out this garbage when i see it and have quit jobs over it, or in a case or two gotten someone fired who definitely deserved it. 

i realized this is what drove me to law — i just wanted to use it to take down scumbags. i care about social justice but i realize it might be an oblivious job search if i’m not focused on something specific. seeing how much people think they can get away with shit from an entry level staff position is insanely frustrating. i think i’d like to make a career out of ridding the working world of people like this. 

i’m curious if maybe anyone works in HR and can speak on it? or maybe some sort of people management or social work? a non-profit as well? 

i know the description maybe sounds a bit grandiose, i realize there are no batmans to speak on their experience but i’m just wondering if anyone works in some sort of office / admin setting and gets the satisfaction of using the rules to fuck up the people who break / take advantage of them. perhaps without a super expensive fancy degree. thanks!!

Because of this, I've found it difficult to meet new people around the city. 

About me: I'm 38F, living with my common-law hubby of 8 years. We have 2 very anxious dogs and are happily child-free. I work for a health authority doing HR and learning/development type work. Politically speaking, I'm quite left leaning and I'm not religious. 

I'm hoping to meet some like-minded women (somewhere in their 30-40s) who are also child-free. Folks who enjoy going for coffee/drinks on a patio, trying out good restaurants (my hubs is sooo picky), going for walks in cute neighborhoods, exploring book or thrift stores, and just hanging out.

If you also WFH, maybe we could co-work at a coffee shop once in a while. I've been getting into running for about 4 months now, so maybe a running partner (provided you're beginning like me), but I much prefer walks.

For the sake of ease and no misinterpretations, I find it difficult to have meaningful friendships with those who are rather conservative-minded (like Alberta-separatist type), those who are against equity/diversity/inclusion principles or practices, or folks who are overly religious. I would respect that you have your beliefs, but they are so different than mine. 

Anyway, if this sounds like something you're interested in, feel free to message me! ",3,1743857188.0,CalgarySocialClub,1,1.0,False

**Weekend Rundown of Fun:**  
[**1. Flyball Tournament - Fools for Flyball hosted by New River Rapids**](http://www.nextthreedays.com/FeaturedEventDetails.cfm?E=842412)

**Admission: Free**  
New River Rapids, a local Flyball team, presents the two-day Flyball Tournament titled ""Fools for Flyball"". Flyball is a very fast-paced (and loud) relay race for dogs featuring four dogs on each team. The tournament will feature 20 teams competing and all racing takes place inside the gym of the Blacksburg Community Center. At first glance, Flyball is quite the contract to more traditional obedience based events. Loud with barking dogs and their handlers getting them amped up, it's like attending a rock concert versus a symphony. But don't let the apparent chaos fool you, these dogs are amazing athletes and spend many hours in training and practice. The event is free to spectate, and a food truck will be on site on both Saturday and Sunday. Cabo Fish Taco will be on site on Saturday and the Copper Dog & Co. will be on site on Sunday. Leashed spectator dogs are also welcome.

Is Metro safe to work at? 2 of the drivers who've been attacked while driving over the last few weeks talked about what happened at a press conference yesterday.,"Madison Bus Drivers are the frontline when it comes to homelessness, drug use and mental illness.  Trying to control these problems in an enclosed space while also driving a 10 ton vehicle through Madison's rush hour is an impossible job without enough pay or support from the city.

One of the bus drivers was trying to protect other kids from a drunk 17 year old.  The other was hit in the face with a coffee mug and had a concussion yet was asked if he wanted to continue his shift.

>“My situation was about me protecting myself and the kids on the bus,” Janz said. “Eight minutes of having to sit there and take this. I’m sitting here in front of you guys to help everybody. Help my drivers, passengers, workers trying to go to work. I show up every day.”

New River Rapids, a local Flyball team, presents the two-day Flyball Tournament titled ""Fools for Flyball"". Flyball is a very fast-paced (and loud) relay race for dogs featuring four dogs on each team. The tournament will feature 20 teams competing and all racing takes place inside the gym of the Blacksburg Community Center. At first glance, Flyball is quite the contract to more traditional obedience based events. Loud with barking dogs and their handlers getting them amped up, it's like attending a rock concert versus a symphony. But don't let the apparent chaos fool you, these dogs are amazing athletes and spend many hours in training and practice. The event is free to spectate, and a food truck will be on site on both Saturday and Sunday. Cabo Fish Taco will be on site on Saturday and the Copper Dog & Co. will be on site on Sunday. Leashed spectator dogs are also welcome.

Leaving my house felt like a chore but i did it anyways. Because it was important (and urgent).

I'm usually quick with shopping, i know exactly what i want and i don't settle for less. It took me less time to pick out the stuff and buy it than reaching the place. i was alone and i was feeling physically uncomfortable for some reason.

I am rather lowkey, i keep to myself, i don't like loud people and I don't want any trouble.

Looking around the store, saw people just chilling; enjoying with their partner or kids or parents. Maybe i would've enjoyed it if i was with my partner, because i like doing things for people. But I was alone today, it was just me and I already knew what I wanted.

I went and I picked it out. Paid my dues and then I was done. It took me maybe 5 minutes to get everything and complete the checkout and it took me 40 minutes to reach there.

Somehow, I was unsatisfied.

Maybe I just don't like going out alone. I don't understand the point - is it to explore? Is it to experience? Explore what? experience what? Everything around here is just a waste of money, every experience here is just me pulling out my credit card for them to charge it.

I would rather sit in peace and look at the trees with wind blowing through. Look at the flowers growing from them (they've changed colors now). Look at the rain falling down from the sky and how it makes ripples, when the puddles start forming (you get it?). Even if I try to do that, I know there'll be someone at the counter waiting to charge my credit card for it.

For some reason I don't like walking around stores in vain, but I did anyway, and didn't find anything useful.

To make good of the outing, I went to a coffee shop. Before even walking in, I knew what I wanted. I wanted an Iced Latte, no sugar. I went to the counter, looked at the menu, flipped some pages, not even looking at what they have to offer. I just looked for the item saying ""Iced Latte"" on their menu and even if they didn't have an iced latte on the menu. I would've still asked the barista to make me an iced latte.

Then I sat down alone on a two people booth with the seat in front of me empty. I thought of putting my bag there and sitting in the other seat myself. But I kept the bag with me because I don't feel that it's safe sitting in the other seat. I was on my phone all the while just logging my transactions of the outing so far. The travel to the shop, the gifts, the payment at coffee shop, thinking about going home instead of sitting here. Because, at least at my home, I have a window that I can look out of and I can see the trees and the flowers in the month of April (its spring). Still, I sat down trying to experience this experience, and I had my coffee.

I saw people sitting with their partners at the coffee shop, having a conversation while I was sitting alone with my phone talking to ChatGPT. Trying to come up with a note to write for my partner for our anniversary. People came and went, and I still sat down with the seat in front of me empty. I finished my drink, looked around at the shop, but there was nothing to look around at, there were people and there were chairs, some were empty and some were filled. There were paintings on the walls but I don't remember what they look like, because there was nothing interesting about them. I remember the barista because he was in my line of sight. I saw the napkin they gave me. It said that they give out free ""soil nourishing"" coffee grounds if you want to put it in your plants. I called my partner asking if they'd like that, but they said that they didn't need it. So I didn't go and ask the barista. I picked up my bag and went home.

I'm happy that I bought the stuff (one item off my checklist, and one brownie point earned), but I feel like I just wasted two hours of my life doing nothing. Alone and no one to share this experience with. I would have much preferred to just order all the stuff at home and look out of the window.",0,1743856006.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.5,False

I’m solo parenting our 2 kids for 3 weeks and it’s only day 2, I already want to run away forever and just cry. I have a 2 year old and a 7 month old, my 7 month old screams and cries all day unless held. My 2 year old wants to be with me 24/7 as well because she misses her dad. I got maybe 2 hours of sleep last night on and off from getting my son back to sleep and my daughter (after my son woke her multiple times) I ordered coffee this morning because of how terrible this is all going and it came half full so I’m still extremely exhausted. 

My cat also decided to poop on the floor this morning which I had to clean as well, then my son had a blowout before I could even take a sip of my coffee. We’re also all getting over food poisoning/stomach bug so we’ve barely been able to eat lately or rest at all. My husband left for this voluntary training for this entire month which has no benefits and I’m just extremely frustrated and defeated. My son won’t sleep, he wakes up every hour wide awake, he’ll then wake my daughter which she takes about 2-3 hours to get back to sleep. I’m getting no sleep, I have no family nearby, no village at all, and my husband is 9 hours away in a different state. 

I’m extremely anxious about asking for help (I actually asked my family for help this time already and was told “you’re a parent now you need to figure this out on your own” so that was great) I just want to give up honestly, I’m so exhausted but I’m so anxious/stressed I’m able to stay awake anyway.

I am hoping to serve coffee at a local farmers market and pop up events and the one market in particular has no electrical hook up.

I know I could probably get a small generator or a large battery bank to run an electric machine off of but I think I would prefer the flexibility of a machine that I could run off of propane. 

Ideally I prefer a direct lever machine but I think I could settle for a spring lever for now. I am even open to and considering converting an electric machine to propane myself. 

Any ideas on what machines out there fit the bill for that use case? I see the fracio lpg1 but I’m pretty sure it’s a spring lever, not direct. 

Coffee will not be our main push at the market but will be instead served alongside bagels. I’m considering doing what I can for now with my flair 58 and df64v. We would steam milk on bellman and flair wizard and heat those and the brew water  on a propane burner. I know this is not going to be efficient, but I would call the coffee side of things something along the lines of “worth its wait” and market it as a slow bar and probably text people when it’s ready or give them an estimated time if it’s over 15 minutes. 

Any help finding a machine that fits this use case would be greatly appreciated. ",1,1743855702.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Here is what my 82 year old narcissistic mother did during the entire weekend to cause chaos and stress: (we were unexpectedly staying in same house for days) 

-Got  jealous and angry every time my daughter called or texted me with plans and details for her wedding.  Spent the time after the phone calls ranting, “why doesn’t she call ME? She doesn’t care about ME!”

-Got up every morning, went to my daughter’s space where she was with her bridesmaids, the days before wedding, and confronted her about why she wasn’t spending time with her.  She did this in front of her friends, before they had coffee.  Every morning.  

-Harassed me as I worked on bridal and bridesmaid’s bouquets, saying I wasn’t doing it right, and coming out of her room over and over to critique me, even after multiple people asked her kindly to leave me alone to focus.  

-As we were decorating the venue, went behind me moving vases and changing decor around , until someone had to distract and remove her.  

-She stood around loudly proclaiming “the photographer isn’t taking enough photos of OUR family, just theirs”, in front of the groom’s family.  They all heard and saw. 

-Acted angry and punitive to me after event, as I stayed down to fully clean her house after company left.  I spent two days cleaning, washing laundry and straightening up, as she slammed doors, ignored me and attempted to play mind games, all because she was jealous of my role as mother of bride and floral designer.  

-As I was packing to leave, approached me with “when are you coming back to see me? You never come see me.”

I left, and my nervous system was a complete wreck for days.  It basically ruined the joy of the wedding for me, and I have been low contact for days now, as she has blown my phone up, alternately acting mad, and wanting to discuss how “wonderful” the wedding was.

1js27m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Songstuff/comments/1js27m8/stop_shouting_into_the_void_indie_music_marketing/,Stop Shouting Into the Void: Indie Music Marketing That Actually Builds Real Fans,"Music marketing is weird, right? Like, one moment you feel like you’ve cracked the code, and the next you're yelling into a digital void while 10k other artists are dropping new releases on the same Friday.

Here’s the thing—no one-size-fits-all. What boosts one artist might flatline another. But after plenty of trial, error, blood, sweat, and flyer paper cuts, patterns start to show up.

Stuff that's been working for lots of indie artists right now:

- **Consistency beats virality**  
One viral video might get you attention. Ten good ones build recognition. Everyone’s chasing the big breakout, but it's the steady drumbeat that keeps listeners ticking back its way.

- **Spend less time yelling “listen to my song!” and more time making people care**  
Your music is the tip of the iceberg. What’s underneath—your story, your vibe, your identity—is what actually hooks people long term.

- **Spotify is your storefront, not your marketing plan**  
If you drop your song and cross your fingers hoping Spotify will save you, you’re basically opening a coffee shop in the woods and waiting for strangers to wander by. Send people there. Tell them why it matters.

That could mean:

- Filming cheap but interesting promos with your song in the background  
- Talking about why you wrote the song or what it helped you get through  
- Making it easy to share with short edits, clean cover art, and smart descriptions  

And let’s talk about playlists.

User-curated and algorithmic playlists are useful, sure. But they’re only part of the deal. A playlist can introduce you to a listener. Only your honesty, character, and experience can turn that person into a fan.

People don't just follow songs, they follow stories.

Also:

- **Build one genuine connection a day**  
Reply to DMs. Tell someone their cover was cool. Mention a local band you dig. Community isn’t an illusion—it’s your whole support system.

- **Email still matters**  
Everyone hangs out on social media, but when platforms fizzle or fade (RIP Myspace), your email list stays yours. Offer unreleased demos, get fans involved in vote polls, or share tour updates directly from your inbox. Keep it real, not spammy.

What hasn’t worked so well?

- Paying random “promo accounts” to toss your song on an IG story for $15  
- Posting the same “OUT NOW” flyer 12 different times  
- Trying to mimic major label campaigns without the major label budget  

Most people don’t scroll through social hoping to find a music ad. They scroll to feel something. They stop when you show them your world in a way that feels human, not calculated.

When you approach marketing like a conversation instead of a sales pitch, everything shifts. You’re not “building a brand”—you’re giving folks more ways to see you.

Marketing doesn’t have to be loud or flashy. It has to make people see themselves in your story, or at least, want to hear more from it.

So, what’s been working for you? Or not working?

My releases were a lot more in the last year in my relationship which recently ended since I  haven’t  mastered non ejaculatory sex as well, but have had a few successful experiences with it.

I’m almost 30 days in and I consider myself as a fairly attractive individual with the kind of attention I’ve gotten from the opposite sex my whole life. But what I experienced at a McDonald’s yesterday was quite something, I was having my coffee looking outside the window scrolling through my messages on my phone when I noticed from my peripheral vision that I was being looked at, I look up and I see this young 20 something year old woman just staring at me. I thought she’d just glance and get on with her stuff. Post that every time I looked in her direction I saw her staring at me, I saw her looking at me almost 7-8 times. She had this young bloke who was blabbering to her non-stop and she’d just keep looking at me.  It felt a bit odd since I felt like every move ( like even lifting up coffee cup) was being looked at. I can only imagine what celebrities go through. 

There definitely is something like a spark which awakens within you when you practice SR and I believe women can somehow sense it rapidly, since you’re emitting raw masculine vibrations and the feminine Yin Craves the masculine Yang, SR is like a loud Bat Signal for Masculinity in the Vibrational and spiritual realm which the souls pick up fast.

Just an experience I wanted to share with you’ll, attraction and attracting a high vibrational woman into your life is not always the end goal, however it is a byproduct of this practice.

Stay strong and enjoy the journey brothers.

1js24rm,https://i.redd.it/im1m2cydd0te1.jpeg,Dating Pool ◇,"Nowadays when discussing the dating pool; there basically two options out there - online and real life dating.

So I'm just gonna give out my own personal opinion on the matter based on my experience from about 10 years or more.

Let's start with online dating.

The first thing that comes to mind, is that it used to be much better back in the day.  The Internet was something hip and trendy and you could actually meet some cool people out there in Tripoli and the general environment was much, much safer before all those creeps, scammers and thugs got their fingers on a keyboard.

You only had to do very little skimming on social media - it was mostly FB platform - and most likely you could find company employees killing time from their office pc and Internet access.  Internet cafes were a thing and people would spend an hour or two ""surfing"" the internet and checking their email account.  

It was actually cool in the sense that you get to go outside, have a coffee ( and smoke inside lol ) while being online and surrounded by different people - it was a social gathering and often times you could meet girls too. 

Its not uncommon to strike a conversation or ask for help from the guy next to you or maybe become new friends and go out for a snack.

At anyrate people felt safer to meet online dates because it just meant that they were somewhat well-to-do and progressive.  

It was the ideal outlet for those looking for friendship, marriage or simply down to fucking after the first date.

Nowadays online dating is a cesspool and I've honestly stepped back from the scene since maybe 2018 and that's kinda late too.  

I don't know if its the dating scene or society as a whole; but there's just tons of freaks out there with very distorted agendas or plans you don't wanna be part of.

Generally speaking, I don't go on blind dates and a video call for reassurance is a must.  

The first time I ever got married was from FB 😅 albeit it only lasted a month and it took 2 years to divorce.  

My last gf ( post divorce ) was also met on FB - she turned out to live near my place, freshly divorced too and we spent the past 4 beautiful years together.

Today I only trust people ( potential dates ) that I meet in person here and there - although its not easy to meet women in the real world, since there aren't that many ( if any ) opportunities to interact with the opposite sex in Libya.

Over the past few years I've developed a knack for nurses and pharmacists ( such as my ex ).  Its easy to get their WhatsApp number with the pretext that I might need to ask about some meds or need advice bla bla bla and we both know its a load of BS 😄 but it works in most cases.

Other than that, there's no other way of meeting women outdoors - im not into cat calling girls from a street corner nor am i into asking girls for their number at intersection stoplights anymore. 

I guess being younger does make you more self confident and somewhat crass. 

Oh and supermarkets.

If some lady asks me to help her grab something from the top shelf or asks me ""have you tried this product ? Is it any good ?""
There's a good chance that we'll exchange contacts before heading to the cashier.

All in all I don't trust online dating anymore, since people can easily hide their true nature and identity behind fake texting, profiles, filters etc. and its literally a can of worms out there.

Meeting potential dates in the real world is the way to go; a sort of reverse trend if you will.

Hello everyone, I need advice on how to make text take up the whole page. The top is what I see when I edit, the bottom is what is actually visible to visitors. Also, If any of you know how to align the title name that would be super awesome too. I can align the title when I insert a title block myself, but the one given by wordpress is undeletable and uneditable. Thank you for any suggestions! I use .com because I don't know how to code and this is my first time building a website just for fun and to learn something new.",1,1743855265.0,Wordpress,2,1.0,False

i (19f) have never been in a real relationship - mostly due to my overbearing mother, being isolated at home most of my life, and also having BPD.

i’ve recently met this really sweet guy (20m) at an event and i instantly connected with him. for most of the night we talked and held each other when it started getting cold outside. it was the closest i’ve been to a person in a really long time (not since some less than fond times when i was still in high school).

i gave him my number, and he texted me soon after the event ended. i was so excited to have him in my contacts and i dreamt about him *all night*. 

we went on a real date within 2 days of first meeting, and it was the most fun i’ve had in years. we talked all day, and i mean *all day*. morning to sunset. we drove around town and i showed him all the cool places i know from when i went out back in school. we got coffee and food and candy and played a card game. he told me about his past and i told him about mine. we relate on a lot of things and it feels so good to have someone who understands a lot of what i’ve gone through. 

this all sounds so good typing it out, but i still feel like i can’t believe any of it. this is where my problem lies and i need some advice.

i’ve been bouncing between completely adoring everything he tells me about himself and his life and completely believing that he’s lying to me about it all. this, i know, is a result of the BPD. i’ve been through a lot of trauma and *a lot* of bad experiences with men/people in general. i’m terrified that he’s like everyone else - that he’ll eventually hurt me and try to ruin me. i want to believe he’s a good person. i want to trust him.

he says he’s been through a lot of the same things as i have. we have similar pasts. relate on a lot of things. he told me he’s only dated one other girl before me and that they had a long but hard relationship. she was abusive to him. i feel so sad for him because i know (sort of) how it feels to be abused. he seems scared that i’ll leave him already or that i’ll try to hurt him. i’m scared of the same things.

he repeats to me a lot that he wants to be honest with me and that he wants me to be able to trust him. he seems to care that i’m nervous about this relationship - like he doesn’t want me to be scared of him or us together. it’s new to me and i don’t feel like i can trust it yet. i told him that i’ll need time to trust him, and he seemed relatively okay with that answer. he tends to listen to me when i set boundaries and tell him no - with an exception for buying little things for me like candy and drinks but he will still listen if i buckle down on my answer.

i don’t know how to feel more comfortable with him. i want to be. i want to get to know him more. i’m just so, so scared of him using me. i can’t trust my gut because it always tells me something is wrong no matter what the situation is. i just love how i feel with him, even if i’m anxious at the same time. he makes me feel anxious in a good way mostly. my anxiety is less focused on stupid things when i’m with him, but still there. he makes me feel happy and giddy. i laugh a lot with him and smile a lot more than i ever do at home.

i’d like some advice on how to know if a guy is genuine. if he really does like me and wants to treat me well and get to know me. i’m worried i’ll get too anxious to see him or talk to him again. we have another date planned for the next upcoming days and i would like to get this advice before then!!",3,1743855176.0,dating_advice,13,1.0,False
1js22jl,https://www.reddit.com/r/PreserveThatFood/comments/1js22jl/how_vacuum_sealing_keeps_food_fresh_longer/,How Vacuum Sealing Keeps Food Fresh Longer,"# Chef's Guide: Vacuum Sealing Revolution - Extend Your Food's Life by 5x!

Hello fellow food enthusiasts! As a professional chef who's obsessed with reducing food waste and preserving peak flavors, I'm excited to share how vacuum sealing has revolutionized both my professional and home kitchen. This scientifically-proven technique can extend your food's shelf life up to 3-5 times longer than conventional storage methods!

## The Silent Food Killer: Oxygen

In professional kitchens, we know that oxygen is the enemy of freshness. Here's what happens when air meets food:

* Oxygen feeds aerobic bacteria and mold, accelerating spoilage
* It triggers oxidation, causing fats and oils to become rancid
* It activates enzymatic browning (that's why your sliced apples turn brown)

By creating an anaerobic environment through vacuum sealing, we essentially press pause on these decay processes. This simple principle transformed how top restaurants maintain ingredient quality and has become accessible for home cooks too!

## Why Every Home Cook Needs a Vacuum Sealer

After years in professional kitchens, I can't imagine life without vacuum sealing. Here's why it's so powerful:

* **Preserves Quality**: Maintains original flavors, textures, and nutrients
* **Prevents Freezer Burn**: Creates an airtight barrier against moisture loss
* **Reduces Food Waste**: Extends usability window of ingredients
* **Saves Money**: Buy in bulk and preserve smaller portions
* **Enhances Cooking**: Perfect for sous vide and marination

## Best Foods for Vacuum Sealing (Chef-Approved)

| Food Category | Normal Shelf Life | Vacuum Sealed Shelf Life | Chef Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|--------------------------|------------|
| Meats/Poultry | 6-12 months (frozen) | 1-3 years (frozen) | Perfect for portion control |
| Fish | 3-6 months (frozen) | 1-2 years (frozen) | Maintains delicate textures |
| Hard Cheeses | 1-2 weeks | 4-8 weeks | Pre-slice for convenience |
| Berries | 1-3 days | 1-2 weeks | Flash freeze before sealing |
| Coffee | 2 weeks | 1+ year | Preserves aromatic oils |
| Nuts | 2-3 months | 1-2 years | Prevents rancidity |

**Pro Tip**: Avoid vacuum sealing soft cheeses, mushrooms, and fresh soft herbs – their delicate structure can't handle the pressure!

## Essential Vacuum Sealing Equipment

From my experience, here's what you'll need for effective vacuum sealing:

1. **Vacuum Sealer Machine**: Choose between countertop models (more powerful) or handheld versions (more portable)
2. **Quality Bags/Rolls**: Look for BPA-free, freezer and microwave-safe options
3. **Specialized Attachments**: Consider jar sealers for dry goods and marinators for quick flavor infusion
4. **Labels/Markers**: Always date and identify contents (crucial for rotation)

## Chef-Proven Vacuum Sealing Techniques

After thousands of hours preserving ingredients, here are my top techniques:

* **Pre-freeze Delicate Items**: Flash freeze berries, sliced fruits, and softer items before sealing to maintain structure
* **Double Seal Edges**: For long-term storage, create two seal lines for insurance
* **Leave Headspace**: Allow at least 1 inch at the top of bags for proper sealing
* **Blanch Vegetables**: Quick-blanch vegetables before sealing to deactivate enzymes and preserve vibrant colors
* **Dry Everything Thoroughly**: Moisture is the enemy of a good seal

Vacuum sealing has saved my restaurants thousands in reduced waste while maintaining exceptional quality. For home cooks, it's a game-changer that pays for itself within months through decreased food waste.

They insisted that I join them for coffee. I agreed, and off we went. After some time, my brother complemented how well my skin glowed in the light of the setting sun. His gf joined in, saying how well I'd transformed after boards.
 She asked what I had been doing and I gave a generic reply somewhat similar to ""eating clean, mostly"". My brother, out of nowhere turned to his gf and told her that told that she needed to take some tips from me since she'd been looking ""real tanned and bloated lately"" (his exact words) and faintly laughed. Like ACTUALLY softly laughed. This was quite careless from his side, since he knows she's been stressed due to work. This was quite obvious and even I knew that. (Shes an article at deloitte, and stressed due to financial year ending workload)

To this, I was disgusted honestly because she truly looks like and is an actual ANGEL. His gf just looked at me, then at her drink and didn't say anything. (Shes the type to avoid kalesh as much as possible).
I asked my brother what the hell was wrong with him and how this was a real shitty thing to say. He tried to play it cool like it wasn't a big deal, and put his arm around her shoulder, but her face clearly said the opposite. 
I then went off on him, told him how pathetic his comment was, and how he needed to apologise right now. 
He didn't say anything for a few moments. I then looked at his gf and said how beautiful she was and she didn't need to change anything for anyone; and to not let anyone get to her.

Silence followed. We soon left and separted paths. I was quite startled, and went home. Overthinking won over me, and I didn't know what to feel. That night, his gf texted texted me, mostly thanking me. After some messages, she told me that she was planning to break up with him; and how this was not the only incident where such thing had happened.

Honestly, I wasn't trying to be a hero or anything, but I couldn't let him disrespect her. Idc if he's mad at me, but I'm gonna visit her and have a long talk. 
Even if they break up, I'm sure imma be in touch with her. Just wanted to get this off my chest, thanks for reading <3.",204,1743855120.0,OffMyChestIndia,64,0.91,False
1js21cn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMoonShots/comments/1js21cn/kendu_setting_the_kendu_standard/,Kendu - Setting the Kendu Standard,"**Kendu Introduction**

Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is just over a year old, we are on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  
Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.  
Kendu has an incredible amount of IRL products and events which I am covering below!!!

See the bottom paragraph to read about the **Kendu Standard**

**The Kendu Brand**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  
It is crazy that we have all these products at a market cap of 12 million, Kendu is doing all of this whilst most of its holders are down.... Imagine what will happen when Kendu's holders are millionaires, with a lot of money to create!!!

Kendu Creator is a website that allows people to 3d print a Kendu mask to make videos on social media. These videos can be non crypto related like taekwondo or running or weightlifting, with these videos flooding social media, Kendu is gonna extend its reach even further!!!   
If one of these videos go viral, Kendu will see massive gains

Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far. Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy) and merch.

**Some Thoughts About Previous Successful Coins**

Shib had a ATH of 44 billion in the bull run in 2021, Pepe had an ATH of 10 billion in a bear market..... In both situations there was far less money in crypto, yet these coins reached face melting ATHs.   
Shib, Doge and Pepe all proved that all you need is a solid community, KOLs don't matter and that the only thing you need is an army of obsessed workers. This is what Kendu has.  
With more money in crypto, far more understanding and belief in memecoins and a proven path, Kendu can top the highs of the previous memecoin hall of famers, Kendu belongs up there with them.  
Kendu is everywhere on social media and we are matching what Pepe, Shib and Doge managed on their run to the top.  
IRL we clear every memecoin ever, all the signs are there

At Kendu, the mission is simple.... we build, build, build until we reach the stars.

**The Kendu Standard**

What is the Kendu Standard?

It is the standard to which Kendu is setting, the standard to which all memecoins will aim to meet after Kendu runs to the billions. Kendu is revolutionising the game with its IRL products and events, the sheer amount of quality and quantity of Kendu's IRL alpha has never been seen or done before..... no coin comes close.  
The Kendu standard is the metrics we try and hit when we engage with social media posts and it is the standard we give ourselves. 

Shib, Pepe, Doge or whatever coin that has existed before, has came nowhere near to Kendu's IRL expeditions and soon with enough holders, Kendu will top every coin in social media metrics. This is the Shib opportunity of 2025, but we are not copying Shib, we are transforming the memecoin game.

**Join the winning team, join Kendu**

Check out our tg, you don't need to be a holder and just get a feel for the Kendu vibe. I am sure you will love it : ) We are a very welcoming and hard working community and any questions are always welcome!

It’s my birthday weekend & I’m somewhat new in town. A friend is taking me to lunch/brunch/midday meal & I want to be in nature. I’m thinking of an easy to moderate hike amongst the trees & maybe see some wildflowers. Any ideas for an itinerary? A few months ago we did brunch in Los Gatos then drove up the hill to St James Park, I think it was. Nice but I’m aiming for some WOW! 🤩 today to honor my anniversaire. I’d love a bakery-style cafe for French toast or even better crepe-style, super thin pancakes & coffee, then finish with decadent cupcakes. Is Croissante good or should we drive to the Village Bakery & Cafe near Palo Alto? Willing to cruise ~30 minutes for true standouts. I hear Marvel Cakes is the best around here. Appreciate any recommendations! Btw we are middle-aged ladies who’ve been close friends since meeting in our university dorm over Thanksgiving break freshman year a looooooonnnng time ago. We still like to have as much fun as we did back then — sans copious alcoholic beverages. Merci beacoup 😎",1,1743854988.0,SanJose,0,0.6,False
