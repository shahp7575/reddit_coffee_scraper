I (27F) had never really attempted dating until this past July. I decided to take the plunge and try Hinge, and the results have been okay. I‚Äôm not the kind of woman who gets inundated with likes, and I know that looks are a big part of that.

Most of the likes I receive are from people who I know I wouldn‚Äôt be compatible with, but I‚Äôve managed to match and talk to nine guys and go on dates with five of them. All of them asked for at least a second date, and I accepted all but one. 

I dated one guy for about a month, and it was really hard on my self esteem. He was objectively more in shape and attractive than me, but I assumed that it didn‚Äôt bother him if he kept going on dates with me. I really liked him, but I now don‚Äôt think he was ever that into me. He shared that he was on the spectrum, and that plus my lack of experience made it really hard for me to read the cues for how invested he was. He said talking in between dates was stressful for him, he would suddenly cut dates short after only 90ish minutes, and he never really initiated touch other than quick, tense hugs (even when I tried to subtly initiate myself). Our time on dates was fun, we laughed a lot, similar intellectual level, and learned that we had very similar values and goals in life. I tried to assume his autism was the explanation for the disconnect, but I felt really uneasy because of the mixed signals. 

On our last date he asked a lot of questions about health and fitness, and it felt like he was wondering if I was trying to lose weight. Normally after other dates, he would always say he had a great time and initiate plans to see me again, but this time he went silent for a week before calling me to say that we didn‚Äôt have similar values. When I said I was confused and asked what values we differed on, he didn‚Äôt know what to say. 

It‚Äôs been several months and I‚Äôve moved on from him, but I feel so much more insecure about dating now. Before, I trusted that if a guy asked for a second date, he was at least somewhat into me physically. Now I don‚Äôt feel so sure. 

I matched with a guy on Sunday and we ended up on a quick coffee date last night before he was leaving town for a week. He was sweet, smart, funny, confident without being cocky, and much cuter than in his profile pictures. He‚Äôs updated his hair and facial hair styles since his photos were taken, and he is easily the most attractive guy I‚Äôve gone out with. I was really into him, conversation flowed easily, we seemed to have similar priorities in life, and we laughed a good bit. At the end he nervously asked for another date, I accepted, and we swapped numbers and went our separate ways. He shook my hand at the start of the date, but that was it as far as touch. I was hoping for a hug at the end. We exchanged the customary ‚Äúhome safe ‚Äî had a great time‚Äù texts when we both got home. 

As the day has gone on, I just keep wondering if he was really into me, or if he just wants to be. We seem to be compatible in so many ways, but I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôll keep dating men who are attracted to my personality but not my body. 

I know that he flew out today to meet up with his sister for a week long road trip, so I didn‚Äôt really expect to hear from him today, but I‚Äôm disappointed that I didn‚Äôt. He mentioned that he would send me pictures from his trip, so I want to wait for those, but the lack of texts isn‚Äôt helping my anxiety.",1,1738383104.0,dating,1,1.0,False

Google has unveiled an AI-powered phone assistant capable of managing calls, scheduling appointments, and interacting naturally with humans.

* ‚ÄòAsk for Me‚Äô can contact local businesses to gather pricing and availability information for services like auto repairs and nail salons.
* Users enter requirements through a search interface, with Google's AI handling the phone call and providing a summary via text or email within 30 minutes.
* A separate ‚ÄòTalk to a Live Representative‚Äô feature waits on hold with customer service lines and alerts users when a representative is available.
* Both features utilize Google's advanced Duplex AI technology for natural-sounding voice interactions.

**What this means:** With much of the younger generation hating phone interactions, these new Google features could have major mass appeal. With much of customer service also transitioning to artificial intelligence, the future is (for better or worse) likely looking like a wave of AIs calling other AIs. This innovation could redefine customer service and personal assistance, though it raises privacy and ethical concerns about AI-human interactions. \[[Listen](https://podcasts.apple.com/ca/podcast/ai-unraveled-latest-ai-news-trends-chatgpt-gemini-gen/id1684415169)\] \[[2025/01/31](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/master-ai-machine-learning-pro/id1610947211)\]

I‚Äôd love to hear some advice from the general crowd here.

# A bit about me:

I'm a male in my early thirties, working a stable job in corporate finance, with an annual income approximating six figures. I moved out from my family home five years ago and currently live in my own place with my cats. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, baking, and taking care of my pets. I also stay active through yoga, spin, and golf. On Friday nights and/or weekends, I usually bring my parents out for meals, or hit up a new restaurant/bar that I always wanted to try.

# Where I'm looking:

I primarily use dating apps like **Coffee Meets Bagel, Bumble, Hinge, OKCupid and Amble**, and also attend social events (Never Strangers, Social Butterfly, etc) from time to time to meet new people.

# The dating experience so far:

Many of the people I‚Äôve encountered tend to fall into a few recurring patterns:

* **Overly sheltered** ‚Äì Still living with their parents and heavily reliant on family and friends for even the most basic life decisions, and much worse - relationship advice.
* **Painfully boring** ‚Äì Stuck in routine 9-to-5 jobs, with no real hobbies or interests beyond watching Korean dramas, listening to K-pop, and eating the same Japanese/Korean food on repeat.
* **Lacking ambition** ‚Äì Either unemployed or working menial jobs with no motivation for personal growth, and little intellectual curiosity or street smarts.

# Overall experience:

The dates I‚Äôve had often lack stability and a sense of emotional responsibility/accountability. Many seem to drift through life without real ambition, merely going through the motions. A common mindset I‚Äôve encountered is the warped idea of *‚ÄúI don‚Äôt chase, I attract.‚Äù* ‚Äî despite having little to offer in return. Some even appear intimidated by the achievements I‚Äôve worked hard for. Worst case scenario, they define relationship criteria with shallow factors such as *""religion, MBTI, horoscope, etc""*.

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I agreed.

‚ÄúThis morning started like any other. I woke up, started a coffee pot, and made sure my son was up for school. I know he‚Äôs 23 and in college, but that boy could sleep through an earthquake.

I found him already awake for once.

‚ÄúDo you want any coffee, honey?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúNo thanks, Mom, I‚Äôm meeting with my group at Starbucks to study for the project,‚Äù he replied, taking a sugar cube from a box and putting it in a plastic bag.

‚ÄúWon‚Äôt Starbucks have sugar?‚Äù I questioned.

‚ÄúOh, it‚Äôs this new brand,‚Äù he explained hurriedly, ‚ÄúFrom Bulgaria‚Ä¶you should try it sometime.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo thanks, honey. You know how I like my specific brands,‚Äù I explained.

‚ÄúYep, I knew you wouldn‚Äôt wanna try it,‚Äù he said, smiling too widely. ‚ÄúBy the way, I‚Äôm spending the night at Kyle‚Äôs tonight to work on the project.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay, honey, have fun,‚Äù I replied as he left.

I poured my coffee, and got my pure cane sugar from the cupboard, but was disgusted to find it infested with ants. *Jackson left it open, I thought.*

So I took him up on the sugar. I went to his room and added 2 cubes from the box. I thought it was strange that the box only held ten cubes, but figured I‚Äôd pay him back if they were expensive.

I sat down, finished my coffee, and put my cup in the sink. I started to feel dizzy, tried to steady myself on the sink, but accidentally cut myself on the knife from dinner last night.

That‚Äôs when I saw the wires under my skin. I peeled back more of my skin, and it was all metal and wires under there. I had to know if I was robot everywhere. I peeled back more and more of my skin, and sure enough, it was all metal.

I can‚Äôt drive anymore, so I grabbed the knife and started walking to Starbucks. I had to know if my son was a robot too. But as I walked down Main Street, everyone was looking at me. They could all see I was a robot, and they hated it.

Some bitch came up to me, feigning concern. I could see in her eyes that she was there to capture me. So I stabbed her and ran to Starbucks.

I tried to talk to him calmly, I did, but he wouldn‚Äôt stop yelling to call 911! He clearly wasn‚Äôt going to let me check for metal willingly, so I tried to stab his arm quickly, but he moved and‚Ä¶well, he wasn‚Äôt a robot.

That‚Äôs the last thing I remember before the world faded into a lava lamp of colors.‚Äù

The officer pulled out the plastic bag containing my son‚Äôs sugar cube.

‚ÄúIs this the sugar cube in question?‚Äù¬†

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

To someone you loved. You still love? You hate.

What to do?

To move on. To connect again? To mourn.



When we met I was a wreck.

Running like a train on a track, along for the ride even though I was the one running my hardest. Why would I do my best for me? That wretch isn‚Äôt worth the effort to try.

Put in the extra step for my parents? They don‚Äôt even know me, so how could they¬† care?



But you. You were worth it. I would tear apart worlds, sunder mountains, and drink seas to hear your laugh.¬†

And for a mere moment I thought you felt that way about me too. You cared for me, you helped me heal my hurt, helped me see myself as someone who might be worth loving.¬†

I guess it was all a lie?¬†

When the show is over, and the credits roll, you don‚Äôt look for my name anymore.¬†



You formed the basics of me.

My parents taught me how to read, how to write, how to hold my cutlery at the table.¬†

But you taught me how to love, how to grow, how to find myself.¬†

When I look within, you‚Äôre the redeemable parts of the worst of me. The light in the dark, the raft on the ocean.¬†

How can I live in a world knowing that you exist but not being able to know you? Knowing I‚Äôll never get to hold your hand one more time? Never get to light the fireplace for you in the morning, or watch the flicker of a smile at a dumb joke?



So how can I not go back to my hole? My latest delve into a colossal depravity hoping to feel something other than self pity and resentment.¬†

If someone so wonderful could be lying about whether I‚Äôm worth loving, Who could tell the truth?

You were the closest I ever came to being loved and it was all only in my head from the beginning?¬†



I can‚Äôt taint the image of you by hoping that you were malicious. It‚Äôs easier to believe I was a fool for thinking myself loveable, than to count you a monster who doesn‚Äôt care. I‚Äôve seen you care. I‚Äôve seen the love you show others. Just not me.

But mere weeks was the best you could muster. The length of your commitment was measured not in centuries, eons, or even years, but a particularly mediocre sum of days.¬†



So where does that leave me?¬†A confused and hurt heart full of cut strings? A head of misery trying to parse some meaning out of your silence?¬†



Do I love you? Do I hate you? When someone else catches the focus of my eyes I can push away your siren's song for a moment and for a flicker of time, it feels like I can move on. But when the false hope fades and I‚Äôm left alone again, the thought of you comes crawling back. You. Always you.



I never got to tell you. Not the whole truth that is. Sure, I took the steps a young man should, we spent hours into the evening telling secrets and sharing an embrace when we could.



But I never got to tell you what you mean to me. You never heard the whisper in the night when I couldn‚Äôt sleep because my mind was racing with the thought of when I could see you again. You never knew that every time I see the stars I think of when we hiked to the tallest hill and watched them late into the night. When I smell a campfire I think of the blanket you keep in the backseat of your car to use while roasting smores. I think of you when I wake up on a Saturday morning alone and try my best to enjoy a coffee with a croissant, but it‚Äôs never the same without you there.



You don‚Äôt know that you fill my waking thoughts even years after we said goodbye. I miss you. In a way that can‚Äôt be truly put into words, because how do you explain a sunset to someone that‚Äôs never seen it? How do you describe the majesty of the mountains, or the rage of the ocean and the calm of snow? How can I say what you mean to me when it‚Äôs so monumental I can‚Äôt even describe it to myself?¬†



I say these things because I need to say them, not because you need to hear. You‚Äôre fine on your own. You‚Äôll find someone who makes you happy in ways I can‚Äôt. You‚Äôll get that job, move to that country, and live the life you wanted. You will find a fulfilled and joyous life, of that I have no doubt. Whatever that looks like to you, you‚Äôll achieve it. I just wish with every fiber of my being that I was a part of that tapestry. A piece of the mosaic that makes up who you are.

I suffered a tbi in late 2019.
I have ever, since I got out of the hospital the following year, had impulse control issues with spending, social interaction, and coffee.

The biggest one is spending cause I'm afraid I'd starve to death if it weren't for community meals and food banks.
Any book recommendations on impulsivity control, especially around spending?
I live on my own and have a cat I care for so much, that I will starve before she starves. I do have a psw though 5 days a week. If it weren't for my impulsivity I could make some big changes and be much more independent!

1iexfu2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1iexfu2/what_are_signs_a_guy_likes_you/,What are signs a guy likes you?,"Post tips for any situation!! But here's mine specifically:

I worked with him for a few months but we didn't exchange numbers until I left. We only actually worked together 2 times or so before I left, but we always got along and had a good amount in common. About a month ago is when I left and we texted almost everyday at first but it's dwindled down since then. Ik there are some signs that a person might be interested in you such at copying texting habits and sentence composition, but this could be nothing.

I'm meeting with him tomorrow as friends at a coffee shop.(I hope he's not on reddit and finds this lol) This is the first time I'll be around him with the intent being that we are friends (co-workers to friends transition is weird for me). I'm sure it will go over well bc again we got along well at work, and I'm not even sure I'm into him as a crush or anything (we get along but we're almost opposite lol, and I have school to focus on). I'm going into it on the fence about where I stand and because of that I want to know what signs to look out for in a guy that he might be into you.",1,1738380765.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False
1iexfgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/comments/1iexfgo/2914_the_ledge/,[2914] The Ledge,"""Mt. Fortune, if you wanted the easy way to the view you could go through that wooden arch way door frame thingamajig and up a short path, but that's no fun. Trust me, this climb will be a lot better."" I stated confidently to the four others nodding eagerly.

Instead of the easy path we walked a different path, well-worn into the scrubland despite not being an official track, which led to the base of the cliff the lookout sat upon. I took a moment to take in the beauty and scale of the climb ahead of us, the early morning sun painted the usually sandy colored rocks making up the 40-meter climb in a warm red and pink glow. The ledge I planned to stop and have lunch on jutted out from the cliff face around 5 meters under the lookout, casting a long shadow across the landscape.

""Bloody beauty isn't it"" I spoke out loud to no one in particular. Josh, my boyfriend, spoke up.

""I dunno love, the views always better with you in it"" he gave me a playful nudge and a wink. There was a playful groan from the other three members of our expedition, Steve turned away from the group and started stretching by swinging his arms and flexing his forearms. The rest of us took this as a queue to start preparing for the climb ahead as well and began to mimic his movements. After ten minutes of looking like a group practicing ti-chi in the park we started to put our harnesses on, drain the last of our coffee and, chalk our hands.

The five of us stepped over the small and sharp boulders lining the bottom of the cliff, the bag of chalk and my anchor equipment softly thudded against my hip as I walked. From the base of the cliff the climb looked both more imposing and less challenging than expected. Cracks in the surface of the rock allowed me to visualize the path and holds required to reach the ledge for our planned lunch. I could already see a few anchors left by previous climbers, although they were rusted with age. I was glad I brought my own camalots and hammer to create new anchor points.

I was the first up the cliff, rope dangling from my harness. I set the first anchor around 5 meters up and moved on. Josh was after me, with his classic lean climber build he was not so heavy as to cause Tara, who was next up the cliff any difficulties when she was belaying him. After Tara, came Eric, her boyfriend, who's larger 'gymbro' build would've caused difficulties for any in our group except for Steve. Steve, while an avid climber and the most accomplished in our group, had not lost any size from his old professional sports days. He still looked ready to slot into the defensive line of any team and tackle anyone down to the ground.

So, we climbed, single file like ants up the face of the cliff. The cracks I saw at the bottom made the climb itself easy for Tara and I, even easier for the taller blokes with us. The trees shrank below us and after a few hours, blisters and only one fall from Tara with a decent catch from Eric, I made it onto the ledge. The view was beautiful, unobstructed by the fencing and signs around the proper lookout, the landscape was of full display. The hundreds of acres of land in the national park were like a serine painting, a green ocean blowing in the wind, only broken by the shining tips of waves of the nearby lake. A pair of arms slipped around my waist.

""Worth the climb hey?"" Josh whispered in my ear.

""Yeah. Yeah, I think so"" I replied. The ledge itself was fairly large and flat, with a slight incline towards the edges. It would have stretched six meters and stuck out of the cliff face around two. The size meant it was easy to move around without being tied to an anchor point, the fear of the 30-meter fall dissipated by the security of solid rock beneath my feet.

""Wow, that was a climb! It was a bit scary there for a second"" Tara exclaimed as she made it to the ledge, and begun watching Eric make the short climb up as well. She had a huge smile on her face, as usual, I couldn't tell if it was because she was out with her friends, relieved her boyfriend caught her fall or because we were planning on repelling down after a quick bite to eat. Maybe a combination. Josh, gave her a high-five and complemented her ever improving skills.

""Only one fall today, remember when we all did the Broken Back climb?"" Both Tara and I gave an involuntary shudder. All of us were slipping while trying to complete that climb when caught by unexpected rain. It took weeks for all the bruises to heal. Luckily Eric pulled himself up to the ledge in time to prevent Josh continuing his reminiscing of the story. With Eric now belaying Steve, Tara unclipped herself from the anchor and I started to point out the areas of interest we could see.

""We should definitely take the jet-ski out there sometime"" Tara said looking over the white peaks of the waves forming on the lakes surface.

""Maybe a few rods as well?"" Eric offered from the edge of the ledge.

""Hey, hold on, give me some more slack"" Came a Steve's voice from below the ledge, Eric gave him a little more slack. ""Did none of you guys see this cave?"" Eric called out. The four of us on the ledge shared a confused look.

""Mate, are you messing with us?"" Josh called back. Steve was always up for a laugh but he took his climbing seriously and he sounded as confused as the rest of us.

""Mate, deadset I am staring at the opening to a cave. It's big enough for me to fit in, how'd you all miss it?"" His voice had a slight echo, as if he was hanging in front of a cave. I'd been focused on the route to the top, Josh always admitted he spent most climbs staring at my bum, Tara was too inexperienced to look around much and, Eric was probably doing the same as Josh. It wasn't impossible to imagine that I mistook a large cave at an angle for a simple crack in the face, still it seemed unlikely we'd all miss it. In my research on the area before I planned for the trip, I didn't read anything about cave systems. I made a mental note to do some googling once we returned to reception.

""Hey, I've got both feet on the ground down here, I'm just going to unclip for a second and have a look around"" Stated the even more echoed voice below. I was planning my words to respond with when it called out ""and before the climber safety officer says anything I'll make sure to reclip before the edge."" I was slightly embarrassed by the call out, but it was better to be known for being too safe than dead.

""Babe, can you grab this? I've gotta check it out to"" Eric hastily handed Tara his rope and started back down and across to the cave.  
""What the? Guys, there's a new freshly painted white door in here. Not just newer than those relics of anchors, but like, freshly painted."" it was obvious he was yelling out but Steve's voice was quieter now, more echoed than before. I shared a nervous glance with Josh, what was Steve on about? Was this some kind of mental break, why would there be a fresh door in a random place like this? How could it be fresh, unless someone had climbed all the way up here with it on their back.

""He's right guys, wow, how did we miss this? This caves pretty sizable"" Eric's voice called out from beneath the ledge. Tara had an awkward look on her face.  
""I'm not a huge fan on confined spaces like caves"" she said quietly, just so Josh and I could hear.

""Hinges work well and there's a little pool of water behind it"" We had to strain our ears to hear Steve now, Eric repeated the statement for us. From the sounds of the echoes, he was near or in the entrance now as well. There was a short period of silence, it was starting to get awkward when a collection of shouting and undistinguishable noises emanated from below us.

""MY CAVE!"" was screamed in a voice similar to Steve's burst into our eardrums, somehow coming from every direction at once. A wet thud, like a hammer against meat, broke the startled silence brought on by the outburst, Then a scream. Tara must've recognized the scream because she threw herself onto her stomach and reached over the edge of the ledge. Just in time to see her boyfriend be dashed across the rocks at the bottom of the cliff. She let out a whimper before a hand shot out from under the ledge seizing her throat. She was thrown from the ledge with inhuman ease.

Josh instinctively pushed me behind him and spread his arms. Tara made an awful sound when she hit the ground. Josh's eyes were wide, leaking tears, his head constantly darting across the edges of the ledge. Scanning for the assailant. What had Steve found in that cave, who did he wake up?

""Steve, Eric? Guys?"" His voice was cracking already.

""I'm still here, Josh"" Steves voice sounded like a calm whisper, yet it carried to us both. Josh took a large swallow of air and opened his mouth when Steve cut in. ""I threw Eric, I had to. I threw Tara, I had to. I was shown I had to.""

""Who showed you? Why did you have to? They were our friends!"" Anger like I'd never seen before had crept into the voice of the man I loved.

""The waters showed me my future; I have to do what the waters insist. They were our friends Josh, just like how you and Amy are my friends. I still have to kill you both though."" I went cold when my name was mentioned. Josh motioned something to me, I didn't understand it, but when he pointed upwards with one finger, I understood he wanted me to start climbing the ten meters to the lookout.

""Why Steve, why do you have to do this? Why do you have to throw us of this cliff?"" Josh called out as I took my first step up the face, it was only when I started climbing, I realized I had been shaking.

""I already told you, besides I'm only going to throw one of you off the cliff because you've already started climbing"" Steves voices betrayed patient annoyance like a teacher to a young child. Josh spun searching for where Steve could see us, after failing that he joined my mad scramble up the cliff face. I clawed my way up the cliff face and allowed myself one look down. Steve was standing below us on the ledge, meters away, blood was flowing from his nose but he appeared to pay it no mind as he launched himself up after us. Josh was nearly level with me a few meters from the top when he let out grunt. Steve had a grip on his ankle. Josh tried to kick Steve away but he swung his head to avoid the first few kicks and dug his teeth into the Achilles tendon of the immobilized leg. Josh let out a sound of anguish and his leg hung limply. He grit his teeth and let spittle fly. Steve left his injured prey and started to move towards my position, I pulled my legs up as much as I could and prepared to keep going, but I knew Josh wouldn't be able to keep up. Josh rose his hand to mine; I reached out and gave it a quick squeeze. Josh let out a small laugh.

""Hammer babe"" His eyes gestured to my hip. I quickly handed him the tool. He let go of his hand holds, I could've sworn I saw him wink and get out one last ""I love you"" before he half tackled half head locked Steve on his way down. The pair slammed into the ledge below. I did not waste time and quickly assented to the look out, while the grunts and thuds echoed out below.

The lookout was fenced, no doubt to stop people trying to climb down to the ledge, or falling off the edge. As I was getting over the curved netting, a pang of pain shot through me when anti-climbing spikes caught my thigh. Blood trickled down my leg as I began limping away the edge towards the path. The path back to the car and back to safety. I was a few hundred meters away from the lookout, just before the first corner into the dense bush when Josh called out.

""Babe Stop! Please can you help me up"" The voice was coming from back towards the lookout. But didn't echo right, and I was far enough away that I shouldn't have been able to hear his call from the cliffs edge. I had turned towards the sound, but I took a half step backwards away from the cliff. ""You heartless Bitch!"" A mix of Josh and Steve's voice thundered with fury, from all directions. Just before I turned to run, I saw a silhouette that could only be Steve sprint out from behind the lookout platform, where he had been lying in ambush, directly into the bush land. He was now running parallel to me. I thought hard trying to remember the map of the path I had seen in the morning. I knew it had multiple turns and switchbacks. I knew that the route Steve was taking would be faster, but if I was to go into the bush in my state, I'd too easily get lost. Besides, on the path I might be able to find people that could help.

I sprinted the entire path, cautiously scanning the edges of the path but quickly moving past them. I must've been nearing the end of the path when I heard crashing through branches above me. I looked up and saw him falling from a high branch through the foliage, he was almost on top of me when his progress was suddenly halted. With a snarl he started clawing at the vines which had encircled his forearm. I just kept running leaving a trail of blood drops from my wound.

I heard his thud behind me, maybe only 30 or 40 meters away, on the soft gravel I could hear his footsteps getting closer, his ragged breathing getting closer. Just as I thought he was within touching distance, through the log doorway the desolate carpark came into view. My white Camry and Erics red Jeep the only vehicles in site. I bolted through the doorframe, the only sounds I heard were my own desperate footsteps and beating heart.

I was close to my car now, I had to turn around, I had to see how much space I had. I allowed myself a quick glance and didn't see him. Still running I allowed myself a longer glance and this time I saw him. Standing stationary at the doorframe, covered in mud, branches and, leaves his handsome features were obscured by blood, part of his lip had been torn away revealing his teeth. Most striking of all was his left arm, the upper part had chunks of muscle missing and his forearm was twisted at a strange angle. No doubt Josh had put up a fight, I felt tears welling up again when I thought about him. Steve had stopped running, but his head still tracked my movements. I shuffled backwards to my car and felt around the front left trye for my keys. I always stashed them there, and Steve knew it. I was relieved when Steve stayed in place and I felt the familiar cattle tag I kept with my keys. With shaking hands I dropped my keys, Steve leaned forward ready to sprint, then relaxed back into neutral posture. My shaking hands allowed me to feel around for my keys and pick them up. I unlocked my car and collapsed into my seat. With shaking hands I started the engine, I jumped when the CD I had been playing started playing an upbeat tune, I slapped at the power button until it quieted. Still behind the wooden door frame Steve knelt down and picked something up from the ground. A bloody pebble, one stained from the gash in my thigh, he dragged the pebble from the middle of his forehead to the end of his nose. He let out an ear-splitting growl, it sounded like the calls of tortured animals being forced through a human throat.

I put the car into drive. As I started making my way out of the carpark I saw Steve for the last time. He was in my rear vision mirror; he rose his bloodied and broken arm, gave three slow waves and turned back into the bushland.¬†¬†",1,1738380730.0,DestructiveReaders,0,1.0,False
1iexexc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aquariums/comments/1iexexc/all_my_fish_are_dead/,All my fish are dead,"So I had a nightmare day with my 20 gallon tank. I had 4 xray tetras and 2 black neon tetras for about 2 years. I realized how empty my tank looked and decided to ad more fish. I came on this subreddit and asked what I can add and was advices 10 total tetras and an accent fish. I completed the xray and the black neon tetras into two groups of 5. Then went with a dwarf gourami for the accent fish. When I was ready to purchase the guy selling them to me advices to get two gouramis. He was very adamant saying how he has a tank with two doing great and they are community fish. I took a look at the tank at the store and saw they had about 10 of them together so I assumed it would be fine. Everything was well for two months. Then yesterday morning i was getting ready to feed the fish and noticed two dead tetras floating, I panicked. Turns out my mother confused my filter plug with the coffee machine ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è(living with other people is hard) not the first time I told her not to touch it. I was so sad. I started to clean the dead ones out found a total of 5 dead fish. I gave a solid partial water change and all was well. I‚Äôm not sure how long it was off for. I‚Äôm assuming 2-3 days. I was on my last week of cosmetology school trying to crunch in hours (school is from 9am-8pm so I was barely home and mom was in charge of keeping up for me till I graduate only one week). This wasn‚Äôt a crazy task since my tank has done wonderful for the last two years and this last week of school all she had to do was feeds. I had no idea this would happen. I watched my tank closely for the next 24 hours. I did a feed and everyone who was left ate just fine.  By lunch time today up came another two bodies and a gourami picking at it. Then I noticed the gouramis that were once peaceful to each other where now fighting. Quickly I separated them and one is in a bucket now and I‚Äôm preparing my emergency 10 gallon tank to keep it there for now. Then it‚Äôs around dinner time and I see the gourami that is still in the 20 gallon chasing the last few fish and one is already twitching and barely swimming. At this point I have no more tanks and can‚Äôt move the two surviving tetras in with the other gourami. What happened?!? Did the water conditions turn the gouramis into killer fish? I‚Äôm doing another partial water change but at this point I don‚Äôt even know how to rebuild my now two separate gourami tanks with new fish if they‚Äôre all just going to get murdered. I am so incredibly annoyed with my mom and she is going to reimburse me for basically killing all my fish, but I do understand I should have still taken at least 10min of my day to peek at my tank. I‚Äôm also a mom to a toddler so the time I had was for him. But I‚Äôm off school finally at home and this happened. I don‚Äôt blame my mom she is 65 and forgetfully I guess, I did reiterate I have mentioned multiple time not to touch the filter plug though. So what can I do now? Do I just leave them alone?  When my tank has perfect conditions can I assume they will be peaceful fish again? I don‚Äôt want to risk any more lives. ",1,1738380682.0,Aquariums,2,1.0,False

I've been dealing with depression for over 12 years now. It comes and goes and up until a year ago I had been able to handle it, be as functional as possible and even be happy a few times. 

However, this last year, for some reason I still don't know, depression hit me hard and it doesn't seem to disappear. I just wake up every day and I'm always tired, coffee just doesn't do it for me anymore and it has gotten so difficult for me to live and take care of myself. My meds stopped working, I got fired and since I can't afford it, I stopped seeing my psychiatrist. 

Death has been in my mind for a while now, but I can't die just yet. My mom and my dog need me. My mom has a lot of issues, she's ill and not able to walk right, so she needs a lot of help. I go with her to doctor's appointments and stuff like that and every time we get home from the clinic or the hospital, I feel even more tired, physically and mentally drained. But I don't let her see me like that, I don't want to worry her. 

I also have 2 aunts that I'm usually close to. One or them, specifically, has been like a second mom to me and has been there for me. I used to be there for her as well, but lately I haven't been able to even respond her messages. I feel bad, sad and really guilty because she just went through surgery and is now recovering, but I just don't have the energy to visit her and talk to her, support her. 

I really hate that. I hate myself for basically being dead inside even though I know it's not my fault. 

I already feel bad, so... I guess I'm just wondering of anyone here has gone through something like this and how did you guys fixed it ü§î I don't even know if it's even possible to do so.",1,1738380607.0,depression,0,1.0,False

What are these new accountants learning in school? What are they doing in their free time? More importantly‚Äîwhat are they lacking? Because basic hygiene, self-awareness, and the ability to eat a meal without turning into a human Rorschach test are clearly not part of the curriculum. Let me tell you about Todd‚Äîthe absolute menace we just fired. 

We hired this guy last year. Todd was, without exaggeration, the filthiest accountant I‚Äôve ever met. Every day, his shirts looked like a toddler used them as a napkin. Coffee, spaghetti sauce, mystery stains‚Äîthis man was a biohazard in business casual.

Then came Tuesday.

We took some big clients out to lunch. Todd, against all logic, orders a hot dog and drenches it in mustard. First bite‚Äîdirect hit on his shirt. It looked like he lost a duel with a condiment bottle. The clients noticed. We noticed. Todd? Clueless.

And then‚Äîdear god‚Äîhe shook the client‚Äôs hand.

With mustard fingers.

I watched in horror as our client pulled back, staring at his hand like Todd had just cursed him. The lunch ended immediately. The client spent ten minutes in the restroom. When he returned, he only fist-bumped from that moment forward.

Back at the office? Todd wore that stained shirt for the rest of the day. Boss saw him and sighed like a man who had truly given up.

And today‚ÄîFriday‚ÄîTodd was finally fired. Boss pulled him aside, gave him the standard ‚Äúit‚Äôs not working out‚Äù speech, and let him go before the weekend so he could ‚Äòfind a new job.‚Äô

1iex3u7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1iex3u7/i_had_decompensated_liver_disease_but_recovered/,I had decompensated liver disease but recovered too quickly and have struggled to get my liver function taken seriously ever after (also have Gilbert's),"38M, history of severe alcoholism, sober 7 years now, briefly diagnosed with liver disease on good data/solid symptoms and labs (incl ammonia >100, bilirubin >3), until I treated it too quickly using things from recent clinical research on liver disease, and nobody will pay attention to my liver history anymore

History: I was heavily alcoholic for about 5 years, drinking about one 750mL bottle of whiskey every 2-3 days during that time. I was also a heavy coffee drinker and I learned later that coffee can be extremely hepatoprotective (See ""Coffee: the magical bean for liver diseases, World J Heptaology, 2017).

Four years after getting sober, healthcare practitioners advised me to stop drinking coffee, and I did stop caffeinated coffee (my bilirubin rose from 1.2 to about 2.2) and then a year later I quit all coffee (and then my bilirubin rose to 3.3).

I also developed very intense symptoms and labs that went on for two months after quitting all coffee (which I learned later helps to reduce liver fibrosis and inflammation):

* significant throbbing right abdominal pain requiring me to use a heating pad
* ammonia over 100 (normal is <60) and bilirubin of 3.3 (normal is <1.2)
* sleepy all day but unable to sleep more than a few hours at night, felt like something biochemical preventing me from sleeping, had to cancel plans and take time off work due to it (this is one of the first symptoms of Grade 1 hepatic encephalopathy, and I had it BAD)
* unexplained weight loss (10lbs in 3 months) and muscle loss, wife said I felt bony like an elderly person
* spider angioma and ""paper money"" skin, many purplish capillary threads visible on eyelids, face and across my body
* jaundice
* confusion, not behaving like myself, inability to tolerate stress

I got help trying to figure out what was going on from r/AskDocs (thank you all, someone took time to really help me) and realized it could be liver disease.

Because I learned that each day with high ammonia or portal hypertension could damage me brain further, and frankly I felt terrible with the decompensated symptoms, I did everything I could to support my liver function -- drinking all the caffeinated coffee i wanted again, BCAAs, third-party-tested liver-safe herbs prescribed by a licensed professional going off the best clinical research for reversing fibrosis (it's almost like a drug and they have some impressive clinical studies in China for reversing fibrosis and restoring liver function quickly). Even if you are not familiar with the research, just assume for the sake of this discussion that liver fibrosis and portal hypertension CAN be lessened quickly according to studies mainly from China (I might go and pull up some studies later).

So I found out what it was and was feeling a ton better. The only problem is that I had a lot of delays in getting a FibroScan to get fully diagnosed. My PCP was out of the country for weeks, when she returned she had no understanding of liver disease and told me I had high bilirubin from drinking coffee again and to stop drinking coffee (the last thing I should be doing), so I had to find someone else for a second opinion. The second doctor agreed it was liver disease and gave me Lactulose, but I live in a city with horrible medical infrastructure and couldn't manage to get referred or scheduled for the one place in town with a FibroScan. I eventually gave up and booked a FibroScan and hepatologist appointment two months later in another state.

By the time I finally got the FibroScan, I felt amazing, my ammonia was normal, my bilirubin was back to the normal range, and the scan showed my liver stiffness at the very upper end of normal (on the border with fatty liver or the first stage of disease).

**Because that scan was technically normal, doctors (including the only hepatologist I've seen, the one who did the scan) have been unwilling to consider that I could have had liver disease at any point in the past.** They seem very fixated on the scan and uninterested in my history and the fact that I was very intensely treating my liver for months prior to the scan and seeing my symptoms reduce during that time. I also have the Gilbert's gene and doctors want to disregard all my bilirubin readings, even though I had upper-normal bilirubin levels (1-1.2) for years before the period of liver decompensation, and for me, bilirubin over about 2 tends to correlate with times I had poor liver function.

Why do I care? I think I could still have long- and short-term risks of liver disease, like HCC (which can be a risk even if your fibrosis heals, since the cellular structure is still deranged) and possibly a recurrence of some degree of liver disease. I haven't been paying much attention to my liver in the two years since that FibroScan, I quit drinking coffee as much, my bilirubin rose to 2.4, and I'm having brain fog and certain symptoms again like I had the previous time when my bilirubin was rising.

I should do more to stay on top of my liver health, but it's hard to give the right effort and get doctors to monitor my liver function, when they see the FibroScan and GS gene and say, you're fine, you should stop thinking about it.

  
Maybe I should stop mentioning the FibroScan. If you found yourself skeptical that I could have had liver disease, would you feel differently if you just saw the history prior to the FibroScan? ",1,1738379655.0,AskDocs,3,1.0,False

1iex2n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1iex2n1/hr_the_ledge/,[HR] The Ledge,"‚ÄúMt. Fortune, if you wanted the easy way to the view you could go through that wooden arch way door frame thingamajig and up a short path, but that's no fun. Trust me, this climb will be a lot better.‚Äù I stated confidently to the four others nodding eagerly.¬†

Instead of the easy path we walked a different path, well-worn into the scrubland despite not being an official track,¬†which led to the base of the cliff the lookout sat upon. I took a moment to take in the beauty and scale of the climb ahead of us, the early morning sun painted the usually sandy colored rocks making up the 40-meter climb in a warm red and pink glow. The ledge I planned to stop and have lunch on jutted out from the cliff face around 5 meters under the lookout, casting a long shadow across the landscape.¬†

‚ÄúBloody beauty isn‚Äôt it‚Äù I spoke out loud to no one in particular. Josh, my boyfriend, spoke up.¬†

‚ÄúI dunno love, the views always better with you in it‚Äù he gave me a playful nudge and a wink. There was a playful groan from the other three members of our expedition, Steve turned away from the group and started stretching by swinging his arms and flexing his forearms. The rest of us took this as a queue to start preparing for the climb ahead as well and began to mimic his movements. After ten minutes of looking like a group practicing ti-chi in the park we started to put our harnesses on, drain the last of our coffee and, chalk our hands. ¬†

The five of us stepped over the small and sharp boulders lining the bottom of the cliff, the bag of chalk and my anchor equipment softly thudded against my hip as I walked. From the base of the cliff the climb looked both more imposing and less challenging than expected. Cracks in the surface of the rock allowed me to visualize the path and holds required to reach the ledge for our planned lunch. I could already see a few anchors left by previous climbers, although they were rusted with age. I was glad I brought my own camalots and hammer to create new anchor points. ¬†

I was the first up the cliff, rope dangling from my harness. I set the first anchor around 5 meters up and moved on. Josh was after me, with his classic lean climber build he was not so heavy as to cause Tara, who was next up the cliff any difficulties when she was belaying him. After Tara, came Eric, her boyfriend, who's larger ‚Äògymbro‚Äô build would've caused difficulties for any in our group except for Steve.¬†Steve, while an avid climber and the most accomplished in our group, had not lost any size from his old professional sports days. He still looked ready to slot into the defensive line of any team and tackle anyone down to the ground. ¬†

So, we climbed, single file like ants up the face of the cliff. The cracks I saw at the bottom made the climb itself easy for Tara and I, even easier for the taller blokes with us. The trees shrank below us and after a few hours, blisters and only one fall from Tara with a decent catch from Eric, I made it onto the ledge. The view was beautiful, unobstructed by the fencing and signs around the proper lookout, the landscape was of full display. The hundreds of acres of land in the national park were like a serine painting, a green ocean blowing in the wind, only broken by the shining tips of waves of the nearby lake. A pair of arms slipped around my waist.¬†

‚ÄúWorth the climb hey?‚Äù Josh whispered in my ear. ¬†

‚ÄúYeah. Yeah, I think so‚Äù I replied. The ledge itself was fairly large and flat, with a slight incline towards the edges. It would have stretched six meters and stuck out of the cliff face around two. The size meant it was easy to move around without being tied to an anchor point, the fear of the 30-meter fall dissipated by the security of solid rock beneath my feet.¬†

‚ÄúWow, that was a climb! It was a bit scary there for a second‚Äù Tara exclaimed as she made it to the ledge, and begun watching Eric make the short climb up as well. She had a huge smile on her face, as usual, I couldn‚Äôt tell if it was because she was out with her friends, relieved her boyfriend caught her fall or because we were planning on repelling down after a quick bite to eat. Maybe a combination. Josh, gave her a high-five and complemented her ever improving skills.¬†

‚ÄúOnly one fall today, remember when we all did the Broken Back climb?‚Äù Both Tara and I gave an involuntary shudder. All of us were slipping while trying to complete that climb when caught by unexpected rain. It took weeks for all the bruises to heal. Luckily Eric pulled himself up to the ledge in time to prevent Josh continuing his reminiscing of the story. With Eric now belaying Steve, Tara unclipped herself from the anchor and I started to point out the areas of interest we could see. ¬†

‚ÄúWe should definitely take the jet-ski out there sometime‚Äù Tara said looking over the white peaks of the waves forming on the lakes surface.¬†

‚ÄúMaybe a few rods as well?‚Äù Eric offered from the edge of the ledge.¬†

‚ÄúHey, hold on, give me some more slack‚Äù Came a Steve‚Äôs voice from below the ledge, Eric gave him a little more slack. ‚ÄúDid none of you guys see this cave?‚Äù Eric called out. The four of us on the ledge shared a confused look. ¬†

‚ÄúMate, are you messing with us?‚Äù Josh called back. Steve was always up for a laugh but he took his climbing seriously and he sounded as confused as the rest of us.¬†

‚ÄúMate, deadset I am staring at the opening to a cave. It‚Äôs big enough for me to fit in, how‚Äôd you all miss it?‚Äù His voice had a slight echo, as if he was hanging in front of a cave. I‚Äôd been focused on the route to the top, Josh always admitted he spent most climbs staring at my bum, Tara was too inexperienced to look around much and, Eric was probably doing the same as Josh. It wasn‚Äôt impossible to imagine that I mistook a large cave at an angle for a simple crack in the face, still it seemed unlikely we‚Äôd all miss it. In my research on the area before I planned for the trip, I didn‚Äôt read anything about cave systems. I made a mental note to do some googling once we returned to reception. ¬†

‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôve got both feet on the ground down here, I‚Äôm just going to unclip for a second and have a look around‚Äù Stated the even more echoed voice below. I¬†was planning my words to respond with when it called out ‚Äúand before the climber safety officer says anything I‚Äôll make sure to reclip before the edge.‚Äù I was slightly embarrassed by the call out, but it was better to be known for being too safe than dead. ¬†

‚ÄúBabe, can you grab this? I‚Äôve gotta check it out to‚Äù Eric hastily handed Tara his rope and started back down and across to the cave. ¬†  
‚ÄúWhat the? Guys, there's a new freshly painted white door in here. Not just newer than those relics of anchors, but like, freshly painted.‚Äù it was obvious he was yelling out but Steve‚Äôs voice was quieter now, more echoed than before. I shared a nervous glance with Josh, what was Steve on about? Was this some kind of mental break, why would there be a fresh door in a random place like this? How could it be fresh, unless someone had climbed all the way up here with it on their back.¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs right guys, wow, how did we miss this? This caves pretty sizable‚Äù Eric‚Äôs voice called out from beneath the ledge. Tara had an awkward look on her face.¬†  
‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a huge fan on confined spaces like caves‚Äù she said quietly, just so Josh and I could hear. ¬†

‚ÄúHinges work well and there's a little pool of water behind it‚Äù We had to strain our ears to hear Steve now, Eric repeated the statement for us. From the sounds of the echoes, he was near or in the entrance now as well. There was a short period of silence, it was starting to get awkward when a¬†collection of shouting and undistinguishable noises emanated from below us. ¬†

‚ÄúMY CAVE!‚Äù was screamed in a voice similar to Steve‚Äôs burst into our eardrums, somehow coming from every direction at once. A wet thud, like a hammer against meat, broke the startled silence brought on by the outburst, Then a scream. Tara must‚Äôve recognized the scream because she threw herself onto her¬†stomach and reached over the edge of the ledge. Just in time to see her boyfriend be dashed across the rocks at the bottom of the cliff. She let out a whimper before a hand shot out from under the ledge seizing her throat. She was thrown from the ledge with inhuman ease. ¬†

Josh instinctively pushed me behind him and spread his arms. Tara made an awful sound when she hit the ground. Josh‚Äôs eyes were wide, leaking tears, his head constantly darting across the edges of the ledge. Scanning for the assailant. What had Steve found in that cave, who did he wake up? ¬†

‚ÄúSteve, Eric? Guys?‚Äù His voice was cracking already. ¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm still here, Josh‚Äù Steves voice sounded like a calm whisper, yet it carried to us both. Josh took a large swallow of air and opened his mouth when Steve cut in. ‚ÄúI threw Eric, I had to. I threw Tara, I had to. I was shown I had to.‚Äù ¬†

‚ÄúWho showed you? Why did you have to? They were our friends!‚Äù Anger like I‚Äôd never seen before had crept into the voice of the man I loved. ¬†

‚ÄúThe waters showed me my future; I have to do what the waters insist. They were our friends Josh, just like how you and Amy are my friends. I still have to kill you both though.‚Äù I went cold when my name was mentioned. Josh¬†motioned something to me, I didn‚Äôt understand it, but when he pointed upwards with one finger, I understood he wanted¬†me to start climbing the ten meters to the lookout. ¬†

‚ÄúWhy Steve, why do you have to do this? Why do you have to throw us of this cliff?‚Äù Josh called out as I took my first step up the face, it was only when I started climbing, I realized I had been shaking. ¬†

‚ÄúI already told you, besides I‚Äôm only going to throw one of you off the cliff because you‚Äôve already started climbing‚Äù Steve's voices betrayed patient annoyance like a teacher to a young child. Josh spun searching for where Steve could see us, after failing that he joined my mad scramble up the cliff face. I clawed my way up the cliff face and allowed myself one look down. Steve was standing below us on the ledge, meters away, blood was flowing from his nose but he appeared to pay it no mind as he launched himself up after us. Josh was nearly level with me a few meters from the top when he let out grunt. Steve had a grip on his ankle. Josh tried to kick Steve away but he swung his head to avoid the first few kicks and dug his teeth into the Achilles tendon of the immobilized leg.  Josh let out a sound of anguish and his leg hung limply. He grit his teeth and let spittle fly. Steve left his injured prey and started to move towards my position, I pulled my legs up as much as I could and prepared to keep going, but I knew Josh wouldn‚Äôt be able to keep up. Josh rose his hand to mine; I reached out and gave it a quick squeeze. Josh let out a small laugh.¬†

‚ÄúHammer babe‚Äù His eyes gestured to my hip. I quickly handed him the tool. He let go of his hand holds, I could‚Äôve sworn I saw him wink and get out one last ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù before he half tackled half head locked Steve on his way down. The pair slammed into the ledge below. I did not waste time and quickly assented to the look out, while the grunts and thuds echoed out below. ¬†

The lookout was fenced, no doubt to stop people trying to climb down to the ledge, or falling off the edge. As I was¬†getting over the curved netting, a pang of pain shot through me when anti-climbing spikes caught my thigh. Blood trickled down my leg as I began limping away the edge towards the path. The path back to the car and back to safety. I was a few hundred meters away from the lookout, just before the first corner into the dense bush when Josh called out. ¬†

‚ÄúBabe Stop! Please can you help me up‚Äù The voice was coming from back towards the lookout. But didn‚Äôt echo right, and I was far enough away that I shouldn‚Äôt have been able to hear his call from the cliffs edge. I had turned towards the sound, but I took a half step backwards away from the cliff. ‚ÄúYou heartless Bitch!‚Äù A mix of Josh and Steve‚Äôs voice thundered with fury, from all directions. Just before I turned to run, I saw a silhouette that could only be Steve sprint out from behind the lookout platform, where he had been lying in ambush, directly into the bush land. He was now running parallel to me. I thought hard trying to remember the map of the path I had seen in the morning. I knew it had multiple turns and switchbacks. I knew that the route Steve was taking would be faster, but if I was to go into the bush in my state, I‚Äôd too easily get lost. Besides, on the path I might be able to find people that could¬†help. ¬†

¬†

I sprinted the entire path, cautiously scanning the edges of the path but quickly moving past them. I must‚Äôve been nearing the end of the path when I heard crashing through branches above me. I looked up and saw him falling from a high branch through the foliage, he was almost on top of me when his progress was suddenly halted. With a snarl he started clawing at the vines which had encircled his forearm. I just kept running leaving a trail of blood drops from my wound.¬†

I heard his thud behind me, maybe only 30 or 40 meters away, on the soft gravel I could hear his footsteps getting closer, his ragged breathing getting closer.¬†Just as I thought he was within touching distance, through the log doorway the desolate carpark came into view. My white Camry and Eric's red Jeep the only vehicles in site. I bolted through the doorframe, the only sounds I heard were my own desperate footsteps and beating heart. ¬†

I was close to my car now, I had to turn around, I had to see how much space I had. I allowed myself a quick glance and didn‚Äôt see him. Still running I allowed myself a longer glance and this time I saw him. Standing stationary at the doorframe, covered in mud, branches and, leaves his handsome features¬†were obscured by blood, part of his lip had been torn away revealing his teeth. Most striking of all was his left arm, the upper part had chunks of muscle missing and his forearm was twisted at a strange angle. No doubt Josh had put up a fight, I felt tears welling up again when I thought about him. Steve had stopped running, but his head still tracked my movements. I shuffled backwards to my car and felt around the front left trye for my keys. I always stashed them there, and Steve knew it. I was relieved when Steve stayed in place and I felt the familiar cattle tag I kept with my keys. With shaking hands I dropped my keys, Steve leaned forward ready to sprint, then relaxed back into neutral posture. My shaking hands allowed me to feel around for my keys and pick them up. I¬†unlocked my car and collapsed into my seat. With shaking hands I started the engine, I jumped when the CD I had been playing started playing an upbeat tune, I slapped at the power button until it quieted. Still behind the wooden door frame Steve knelt down and picked something up from the ground. A bloody pebble, one stained from the gash in my thigh, he dragged the pebble from the middle of his forehead to the end of his nose. He let out an ear-splitting growl, it sounded like the calls of tortured animals being forced through a human throat. ¬†

I put the car into drive. As I started making my way out of the carpark I saw Steve for the last time. He was in my rear vision mirror; he rose his bloodied and broken arm, gave three slow waves and turned back into the bushland. ¬†",1,1738379547.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Are there any indoor places to just exist in the evenings, with a book or laptop, without the requirement to spend money?

I‚Äôm a 25f, as far as medical history I have asthma, panic disorder and OCD. The only daily medication I take is Wellbutrin 200mg. Pretty heavy drinker, usually 2-3 times a week and I drink hard liquor, occasional cocaine use. I smoke socially.

I‚Äôve been having off and on stomach pain for the past couple weeks, i‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs due to me upping the dosage on my Wellbutrin (100mg to 200mg) but that‚Äôs really the only thing that‚Äôs changed in the past few months. I haven‚Äôt been eating a lot because of this, I have almost no appetite and I have to force myself to eat once a day.

Last night I was at the bar with some friends and my stomach started hurting really bad, like I was sweating and in visible pain. I decided to force myself to throw up to see if it would make me feel better because I thought the alcohol just wasn‚Äôt sitting right with me, so I put my fingers down my throat and made myself throw up. My puke looked like loose tobacco or coffee grounds, I didn‚Äôt think much of it at first and went home but this morning I decided to google if that was normal and I guess it‚Äôs not normal at all and everything is saying to go to the ER. My stomach was a little uncomfortable earlier but not in PAIN like it was last night. Also after I forced myself to throw up my stomach felt better.

I called an ask a nurse hotline at my local hospital and explained what was going on and she said I should go to the ER. I called my doctor after to ask her if I should go and she asked me how my pain level was today, I told her it was maybe like a 2/10 but more uncomfortable than anything and she said that makes her think it isn‚Äôt a medical emergency and I don‚Äôt have to go to the ER. We have an appointment next week and she said we can talk about it then.

I ended up getting some food after and I feel totally fine right now, but with my OCD and panic disorder I‚Äôm kind of freaking out and wondering if I should still go to the ER to get checked out.

I was on 250mg IR twice daily when I begged my nurse to switch me to the ER version to help with the gastrointestinal side effects. So now instead of taking half tablets at 250mg twice a day, I'm now at 500mg once a day until my next dose increase next week to 1000mg for 10 weeks. 

I'm about to take my third dose of ER, but the side effects I'm having seem almost worse now? I went from being able to eat here and there on IR, to not even wanting to touch coffee on ER or eat whatsoever (I'm a coffee fiend, so this is extremely abnormal for me). I'm also severely fatigued (if I had to guess, it's from lack of nutrients), but once I'm asleep, I can only stay asleep for a maximum of 2 hours and I'm up again (also, whats with the insane nightmares on ER? Definitely didn't have this issue on IR). Both have given nausea and diarrhea, but it's eased very minimally on ER.

As per my nurses request, I check my blood sugar a couple times a week fasted, as well as a couple hours after eating. Those numbers come back completely normal. I'm not diabetic. 

I guess I'm just overall confused because it's the same dose, and I feel worse on it. Does this get better eventually? 

Your girl with very high testosterone & androgen levels who gained 110lbs in less than a year after pulling the nexplanon implant is just over it. I'm tired of breaking down constantly because my body has continuously worked against me for as long as I can remember - and this definitely isn't helping right now.

‚ÄúAh, come on, watch the hat!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs well past its time, buddy. Get a new one before you attend your court hearing!‚Äù

The orange glow of daybreak illuminated the street entrance of the Boston Museum of Science, granting light to the street, the sidewalk, and the various parked police cruisers that occupied the stretch of road. On the sidewalk, Cindy Moon and Philip Sheldon watched as Montana, one of the enforcers, was forced into a van with his compatriots, the aptly named Fancy Dan and Ox. Fancy Dan wore an expression of obvious fury, only slightly hidden behind his cracked sunglasses. Meanwhile, the Ox squirmed in his seat, clearly intimidated by his compatriot‚Äôs anger. Shoved into his seat, Montana joined Fancy Dan in his angry staring contest with the Ox. 

Finding the courage to finally speak, the Ox muttered a sad ‚ÄúW-What? Why are you guys looking at me like that?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are we glaring at our utterly incompetent third wheel?‚Äù Fancy Dan growled. ‚ÄúBecause you fucked us over! You were supposed to kidnap the lab experiment, not give away our plan!‚Äù

‚ÄúHey! I‚Äôm not incompetent! You guys got beat up too!‚Äù The Ox retorted.

The veins on Montana‚Äôs forehead bulged. ‚ÄúBecause you set him on our trail, you no good *moron!*‚Äù

Before the insult brigade could continue, police slammed the doors at the back of the van shut. Watching the van drive off, Cindy sighed before looking at Sheldon. ‚ÄúWelp, I‚Äôm glad I don‚Äôt have to see those guys again.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt be so sure,‚Äù Sheldon said. ‚ÄúCourt case might need witnesses, that sort of thing. Then again, I‚Äôm probably sufficient in that regard, so you don‚Äôt have a ton to worry about.‚Äù

Cindy nodded, then looked out at the rest of the police cruisers. ‚ÄúSoooo‚Ä¶ when do they show up at Alchemax headquarters?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe police? Not for a bit unfortunately,‚Äù Sheldon remarked. ‚ÄúStory like this‚Äôll get written, but I‚Äôve gotta give everything to the authorities, let them sort things out. I‚Äôll need the go ahead from them before I publish the story.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow long will that take?‚Äù Cindy asked.

‚ÄúWho knows? I certainly don‚Äôt. Maybe the police do but it‚Äôs probably not a good idea to go asking. Too early, and it disrupts their work.‚Äù Sheldon rolled his shoulders. ‚ÄúTruthfully, I think for today it‚Äôs best you put it out of your mind and get some rest. It was a long night.‚Äù

Cindy yawned. ‚ÄúYeah, longest night of my life honestly.‚Äù

Sheldon grinned. ‚ÄúYou mean the longest night of your life so far.‚Äù

Cindy groaned loudly, eliciting a chuckle from Sheldon. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the spirit kid. You‚Äôll learn eventually.‚Äù

As the two finally began to settle, a police officer approached them, then pointed at Cindy. ‚ÄúMiss Moon? I‚Äôm your ride home. It‚Äôs time to go.‚Äù

Cindy frowned, then looked back at Sheldon, who simply smiled at her. ‚ÄúGo. They‚Äôre waiting for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know, and they‚Äôre gonna be mad,‚Äù Cindy said.

‚ÄúSure, but you‚Äôve gotta go home eventually,‚Äù Sheldon said. ‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt be mad forever.‚Äù

Cindy pouted, but ultimately took Sheldon‚Äôs words to heart. Turning around, she began to follow the officer to his cruiser. However, before she could open the door and get inside, Sheldon called out to her, ‚ÄúCindy!‚Äù

Cindy turned back towards Sheldon. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Smirking, Sheldon stood up. ‚ÄúYou did good out there, kid. Above and beyond anything I‚Äôve ever seen in a fellow journalist, and I‚Äôve seen a lot of journalists! Take that to heart.‚Äù

For a moment, Cindy couldn‚Äôt believe her ears. She stared at Sheldon, confused. Then, as the words rang through her mind, she found the edges of her mouth curling into a smile. She nodded to Sheldon, then skipped over to the cruiser, her step full of pep. The engine of the cruiser roared, and soon enough Cindy was whisked back home. 

After the car disappeared from sight, Sheldon groaned, stretching to unkink some knots in his back. It had been a long night, even for him, and it was time to get some rest, though there was still one matter to attend to. Turning around, Sheldon began to walk towards a nearby alley, only to be approached by one of the police officers on the scene. He was an older man, a lieutenant, and one Sheldon knew well. 

‚ÄúDaniels,‚Äù Sheldon remarked, crossing his arms. 

‚ÄúPhilip,‚Äù Daniels said, taking his hat in his hands. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs always something with you, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù

Sheldon smiled, ‚ÄúHeh, you know me! Can‚Äôt keep myself out of trouble, even at our age.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well, maybe you should try sometime. It‚Äôll mean less trouble for me,‚Äù Daniels remarked. ‚ÄúAs if I don‚Äôt have enough to deal with.‚Äù

Sheldon chuckled before patting Daniels on the shoulder. ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt be such a prude. I make your life interesting!‚Äù

‚ÄúToo interesting, Sheldon. Too interesting,‚Äù Daniels clicked his tongue before turning his back on Sheldon. ‚ÄúBut enough pleasantries. I wanted to ask you something.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm an open book, Daniels, you know that,‚Äù Sheldon said.

‚ÄúThen tell it to me straight,‚Äù Daniels turned around to face Sheldon. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve given us every detail you have about this story you‚Äôre writing. Every single thing, right?‚Äù

Sheldon shrugged. ‚ÄúEverything I was going to write about.‚Äù

Daniel‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúAnd the things you were going to leave out?‚Äù

Sheldon paused for a second, then narrowed his own eye to match Daniel‚Äôs gaze. ‚ÄúNot important enough to mention.‚Äù

For a moment, the two simply stared at each other, locked in silent mental battle, scrutinizing each other endlessly. Then, Daniels grimaced, and broke eye contact with Sheldon. ‚ÄúPah. Fine then. You have your reasons to keep things from me, and I trust they‚Äôre good.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho said I was keeping something from you?‚Äù Sheldon asked.

‚ÄúPlease, I know you, Philip. You‚Äôve got a little quiver in your brow when you‚Äôve got something to hide,‚Äù Daniels said. ‚ÄúBut even if it‚Äôs my business, I trust you to make the right call.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ feeling‚Äôs mutual my friend,‚Äù Sheldon said.

‚ÄúIt really isn‚Äôt, but thanks anyways for the sentiment,‚Äù Daniels said. ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll leave you to it. Got a crime scene to map out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? My intern gets a ride but I don‚Äôt?‚Äù Sheldon joked.

‚ÄúPlease, you hate riding in a cruiser,‚Äù Daniels said, turning his back on Sheldon yet again. ‚ÄúAnd I know Philip Sheldon loves the subway more than anything. See you later, old friend.‚Äù

With a cursory wave, Daniels left Sheldon to his own devices, entering the Museum of Science. Sighing, Sheldon turned around and resumed his journey to the alley, entering it to get out of sight of the police. Lighting a cigarette, he blew out a puff of smoke before leaning against the wall. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ you didn‚Äôt croak after all.‚Äù

‚ÄúGuess so.‚Äù

Sheldon looked up, watching as Kaine crawled down from his perch higher up on the alley wall. Leaping to the wall opposite Sheldon, he took a seated position about 8 feet up, letting Sheldon look him in the eyes without craning his neck. ‚ÄúYou know, I was pretty worried, seeing you all smoky down on the stage. I thought you‚Äôd bought the farm.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, for a minute I thought I bought it too,‚Äù Kaine said. ‚ÄúBut I should‚Äôve known Parkers were made of sterner stuff. We always are.‚Äù

Sheldon took another puff from his cigarette, ‚ÄúSo, where to now for the‚Ä¶*Scarlet Spider*?‚Äù

‚ÄúTch,‚Äù Kaine snickered. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I thought‚Ä¶ I thought I‚Äôd want to leave again, get that truly fresh start I was looking to get when we first got off that boat. Now though, it‚Äôs not so appealing. After tonight, Alchemax won‚Äôt come after me, not publicly. Not much of a reason to run now, and there‚Äôs gonna be even less of a reason once Alchemax is gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúGot any connections anywhere?‚Äù Sheldon asked.

Kaine shook his head. ‚ÄúThere are people in my memories, the memories that I got but didn‚Äôt make. They mostly live in NYC, but it doesn‚Äôt feel right for me to go there right now. There‚Äôs too much bad blood, it wouldn‚Äôt be good for me or for them if I showed up.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, you‚Äôve got no-one?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, basically.‚Äù

Sheldon frowned, then dropped the cigarette and put it out with his foot. Pushing himself off the wall, he turned to face the alley‚Äôs exit. ‚ÄúWell, if that‚Äôs the case, I‚Äôve got a spare room at the house. You can stay there while you figure things out.‚Äù

Kaine‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúAre‚Ä¶ are you sure? I wouldn‚Äôt want to‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not imposing! Hell, Doris and I probably won‚Äôt be doing much for a few weeks after tonight, so you‚Äôre welcome to stay with us.‚Äù


For a moment, Kaine was silent, unsure of whether or not he should accept the generosity Sheldon was offering him. He felt a tug at the back of his mind, that Parker pride, telling him to say no, to find his own path. In many ways, listening to the Peter Parker in him had been what kept him alive, and it had been the thing that had guided him ever since he had gotten free.

But when he looked at the rest of his options, this was a lifeline he couldn‚Äôt refuse. Slipping off of the wall and onto the ground, Kaine trudged beside Sheldon, pulling his hood over his head. ‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll bite.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, we‚Äôll take the subway,‚Äù Sheldon said. ‚ÄúHappy to have you kid.‚Äù

Kaine shuddered, suddenly overcome with emotion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm happy to be here.‚Äù

And with that, the two began to walk towards the nearest subway station, guided by the sun‚Äôs morning light. As they got onto the train, Kaine took a seat and found himself finally relaxing. He wasn‚Äôt being hunted. He wasn‚Äôt alone.

He was in the safe and comforting arms of someone who gave a damn about him. 

&nbsp;


*****

&nbsp;

After a thirty minute drive, the police cruiser finally arrived at the front steps of Cindy‚Äôs house. After getting out and waving goodbye to the officer as he drove off, she turned to face the front door. Taking a few steps forward, she reached for the doorknob, only to stop midway through the action. Even after everything Sheldon had told her, she was still dithering. She didn‚Äôt like upsetting her parents, she didn‚Äôt like the hour long lectures, and she certainly didn‚Äôt enjoy the prospect of hearing those lectures after being out all night nearly getting killed.

But slowly, Cindy‚Äôs hand resumed its course for the door, paired with a few different realizations. She was tired, and wanted to sleep in her bed. She had no intention of putting up any kind of resistance after all the fighting she‚Äôd done last night. Most presently of all though‚Ä¶ she missed her parents, and she was ready to be in their company again. Grabbing the doorknob, Cindy opened the door and stepped inside, ready for the verbal beatdown she was bound to receive.

Yet as she closed the door behind her, there was only a pregnant silence. The living room she found herself in was empty, occupied only by the couch and TV that were always there. Cindy nervously squirmed, wondering where everybody was before the voice of her brother echoed throughout the house.

‚ÄúCindy?!‚Äù

Racing in from an adjoining room, Albert Moon Jr. tackled Cindy, nearly knocking her over. Wrapping his arms around her waist, he hugged her tightly, prompting Cindy to chuckle before hugging him back. As the two embraced, Cindy‚Äôs father, Albert, rushed into the room, as well as her mother, Nari. Without hesitation, the two joined in, enveloping Cindy in a mess of squeezing arms. Cindy shuddered, shocked by the sudden wave of affection, but she tried her best to return the gesture, though her arms were only so long.

‚ÄúOh, thank god you‚Äôre back home and safe!‚Äù Nari remarked. ‚ÄúWe were so worried that you‚Äôd gotten hurt, or worse!‚Äù

Cindy smiled, unsure of how to respond. Her mother wasn‚Äôt exactly distant, but she was the workaholic of the family, and often didn‚Äôt have the luxury of spending much time at home. She could tell that Nari was here on short notice, given the unkempt nature of her hair and clothing. They‚Äôd always been close, even when there were at least two to three-hundred miles between them. Eventually, after about a minute, Cindy was released, though her family remained close. 

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm so sorry for making everyone worried!‚Äù Cindy said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt mean‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright Cindy, the police called ahead and told us what happened,‚Äù Albert said. ‚ÄúJust calm down. Right now, all we care about is that you‚Äôre safe.‚Äù

‚ÄúR-Really?‚Äù Cindy said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not mad?‚Äù

Albert grimaced. ‚ÄúOh, we‚Äôre mad‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúFurious, actually,‚Äù Nari said, frowning. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôve been up all night, and so have you. It‚Äôs not a bridge anyone here has the energy to cross. There‚Äôs a lot to be discussed, but right now, you‚Äôre probably exhausted.‚Äù

Cindy blinked, though it was hard to open her eyes each time she did so. It was true, she felt completely run down, to the point that she might fall asleep at any moment even while standing up. ‚ÄúUh, yeah. I‚Äôm definitely‚Ä¶ ready to go to bed.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen go up and rest,‚Äù Albert said, his expression somewhat hidden behind his glasses. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll talk later.‚Äù

Cindy nodded, and without giving it much thought, began trudging up to her room. There was still a pit in her stomach, she had no clue what kind of punishment she was going to receive, and it was probably going to be a big one, but at least she was back home with her family. 

Walking into her room, Cindy fell face first into her bed, and fell asleep immediately. The spring mattress had never felt so comfortable. 


&nbsp;


*****

&nbsp;

‚ÄúAlright, Kaine. We‚Äôre almost there.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you say so.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my house‚Ä¶ I know so.‚Äù

Kaine followed Sheldon down a quiet, suburban street, which was an oddity in the middle of an urban city like Boston. The two had taken the subway to Central Square, a station near Cambridge, and were currently walking through a neighborhood that wasn‚Äôt dissimilar from Queens. The mix of houses near various urban centers. The driveways paired with grassy yards. The power lines snaking through tree branches to reach each utility pole. Kaine was in a whole different city, yet this neighborhood felt like home in a way only Queens could feel like home. 

Eventually, the two arrived at a quaint, two-story home sandwiched between all of the other houses on the street. It was painted in a faded blue, with a few windows peppered around the front. The front door was decorated with a small wreath, as well as a welcome mat on the ground. Despite the presence of a driveway, there wasn‚Äôt a car to be seen. Walking up to the front door, Sheldon pulled out his keys and unlocked it before stepping inside, allowing Kaine to follow him in.

The interior of the house was incredibly homey, to the point that it almost felt stuffy. A flower-patterned couch sat in the living room, alongside a TV that looked at least ten to twenty years old. A yellow and white stripe pattern gave flavor to the walls, and the various shelves and coffee tables littering the room were filled with either potted flowers or pictures that could very well be dated back to the sixties and seventies. Through one doorway, Kaine could see a small kitchen, with an old gas stove and various cabinets with old white paint. Through another, Kaine could see a stairwell leading up towards the second floor. Sheldon stepped forward. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm home, Doris!‚Äù

Immediately, an elderly woman with graying hair emerged from the kitchen, clad in a blue sundress. She moved slowly, age clearly wearing on her bones, yet she still sported a confidence that would only come from having a wealth of life experiences. Her eyes landed on Sheldon first, though they darted to Kaine as well. She met his gaze for a moment, then smiled, displaying an incredible level of warmth without even saying a word. 

Doris looked back at Sheldon. ‚ÄúGood! Was just getting ready for bed! Who‚Äôs this?‚Äù

‚ÄúAh, this is Kaine!‚Äù Sheldon said, clapping Kaine on the back. ‚ÄúHe was a part of last night‚Äôs investigation, and‚Ä¶ he doesn‚Äôt have anywhere else to go.‚Äù

Doris frowned. ‚ÄúOh, how terrible! He doesn‚Äôt have any family?‚Äù

Kaine grimaced. ‚ÄúNot exactly‚Ä¶ no.‚Äù

For the next few minutes, Kaine and Sheldon explained everything that had happened that night. There were points where Kaine danced around a topic, such as his powers or his past, only for Sheldon to fill in the blanks. Kaine feared that these facts would frighten Doris, but not once was she rattled by these revelations. It was clear that she had heard stories like this many times before. As the two men finished recounting the previous night‚Äôs events, Doris glanced at Kaine. ‚ÄúYou poor boy. You‚Äôve been through quite a lot, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I guess you could say that,‚Äù Kaine said.

Doris nodded. ‚ÄúWell then, I think I‚Äôm in agreement with Philip then. You can stay here for as long as you need.‚Äù

Kaine‚Äôs eyes widened. ‚ÄúAre you sure? I don‚Äôt want to be a bother-‚Äù

‚ÄúHush dear,‚Äù Doris said. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a bother. If my husband says you‚Äôre a good boy, then I believe him. Come, I think I know where you could stay.‚Äù

Doris turned and started walking up the stairs, prompting Kaine to glance at Sheldon in surprise. Sheldon smirked before gesturing for Kaine to follow Doris. Sighing, Kaine walked after Doris, following her to the second floor before entering a room at the end of the hall. Entering, Kaine was met with a small room with a circular window and a slanted ceiling, which matched the shape of the roof. The room was lightly decorated in baby blue paint, with a small bed with white sheets in the corner. A dresser was placed opposite the bed, and flanked with boxes full of old toys and clothes that were well suited for someone with a slimmer build. Doris turned around, ‚ÄúThis was my son Stanley‚Äôs room, though he hasn‚Äôt slept here for a while. He‚Äôs been living in Miami for the past twenty or so years, he works for one of the tech companies down there.‚Äù

Kaine smiled. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt thank you enough, Mrs. Sheldon. I‚Äôm honored that you‚Äôd let a stranger into your home like this.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh don‚Äôt mention it!

This world has a tendency to be as mean as the worst people who live in it. It‚Äôs only right we try to make it just a little nicer.‚Äù

Kaine blinked. Her words sounded eerily familiar to the advice a certain different wise figure had bestowed upon him. ‚ÄúRight, I erm‚Ä¶ thank you.‚Äù

Doris placed a hand on Kaine‚Äôs shoulder, though she had to reach up as he was at least a foot taller than her. ‚ÄúIf you need anything, we‚Äôll be around the house. Just holler.‚Äù

Kaine nodded, and with that Doris left the room, allowing Kaine to settle in. Looking back at the bed, Kaine yawned, stretched his arms, then crawled into the bed to rest. As he laid in the bed, glancing out the window at the rest of the neighborhood, he was suddenly overcome with a sense of Deja Vu. He was ten years old again, panicking at the sight of the school bus as it was pulling away from his house. He was seven, watching Uncle Ben rake the fall leaves out of the yard. He was fifteen, crawling out of the window to go web-swinging for the very first time, to be Spider-Man for the very first time.

Shaking, Kaine felt a few tears fall from his eyes. It had been so long since he‚Äôd felt comfortable, and the Sheldon household brought him back to memories that felt real enough to be his. This place didn‚Äôt feel temporary. This place didn‚Äôt feel fleeting.

It felt like home.

Cindy didn‚Äôt know what time it was when her door creaked open, only that it woke her up all the same. Groaning, she turned towards the door to her bedroom, barely conscious as she spotted a smaller figure standing in the doorway. She knew exactly who it was. ‚ÄúUgh, what‚Äôs wrong, Al Jr.?‚Äù

Cindy‚Äôs brother rubbed his eyes. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt sleep.‚Äù

Cindy frowned. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù

Albert Jr. lowered his head, ‚ÄúI-It‚Äôs stupid. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just scared. You left so quickly and then you were gone for so long and I-‚Äù

Albert Jr‚Äôs words trailed off, but even in her groggy state, Cindy understood. Slowly, she leaned over the edge of her bed and grabbed a sleeping bag that laid underneath, sliding it out to a spot next to her bedframe. Albert Jr. frowned. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not five.‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say you were five,‚Äù Cindy said. ‚ÄúNo judgement. If it helps you sleep, just go ahead.‚Äù

Albert Jr. stared at the sleeping bag in silence, then begrudgingly walked over and got in it before closing his eyes. Cindy rolled back onto the bed proper, smiling to herself. Albert Jr. was at that age where he found any kind of help or affection gross, mostly as a faux way of pretending to be grown up. He didn‚Äôt realize that all of that love was the best part of being alive yet, and Cindy knew that. She‚Äôd been in exactly the same spot he‚Äôd been in. Eventually, he‚Äôd be less embarrassed about these sorts of things. She‚Äôd just have to bear with him on it.

Besides, it meant a lot to Cindy that her brother cared so much about her, and she was sure it was vice versa for him. As she closed her eyes, she felt satisfied, and confident that things were going to be alright.

And then she heard the voices of her parents speaking downstairs. 

‚ÄúAre you sure this is a good idea? You know this is what she wants to do!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter. That man put her at risk, and we can‚Äôt just forget about that.‚Äù

Cindy gulped. That didn‚Äôt mean what she thought it meant, did it?

‚ÄúYou know this‚Äôll break her heart, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe so‚Ä¶ but if it means she‚Äôs safe, it‚Äôs worth it. Starting tomorrow morning, Cindy‚Äôs internship with Mr. Sheldon is **Over.**‚Äù

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

For some context, me (26F) and my girlfriend Cairo (26F) have been together for about eight months now, and we met at a local store we both go to a bunch (it's a kind of spiritual shop if that's important in any way). We were always in there around the same times, and I thought she just seemed so cool from day one. She was always so kind and ready to have a conversation with everyone and anyone in the shop, including me. Just a totally bubbly and sweet soul.

I was so nervous, but during one of our general friendly chats, I asked her if she would want to go get coffee with me sometime and the rest is history. So, three nights ago we were hanging out at my apartment and making dinner together. I had been thinking for a while that I wanted to tell her I loved her, and I thought that night would be perfect. Me and Cairo had set up the little table on my balcony, candles and the sun setting. Seriously, it was like something out of a shitty romance book. We were sitting and eating, and I just looked at her when she was laughing at some stupid joke I made and I just blurted out those three little words.

She immediately went silent, and she had this look on her face that, in all these three days of rolling it around in my head, I could only describe as confusion. I quickly tried to tell her she didn't have to say it back, that I just wanted her to know, but she stood up and kind of spluttered for a moment before just saying something like, ""I'm so sorry, I need to think,"" and practically bolted out of my house. I just sat there.

I don't know how much time passed by, but it was dark when I went back inside to get my phone to text her. I was so out of it, I just sent her a message asking if she was okay. She answered quickly, saying, ""Yes. I'm sorry, I don't know what's wrong with me. Just give me time, please.""

I haven't texted her since, and I don't know what I should do. Was I too intense? Did I spring it on her horribly? I haven't been able to stop crying like a baby, and I just need some advice on when I should try talking to her again.",5,1738378724.0,relationship_advice,6,1.0,False

The sweeper for the ride was someone named Tony, who spent hours going all over the place to bring people back into the group.

I was super nervous about the ride and took it very seriously, huddling in the group and saving every match I had. The thing is, I‚Äôve never had to ‚Äúfuel‚Äù before‚ÄîI just never needed to on a 1.5‚Äì2 hour ride. But at around the 2-hour mark, I could feel myself absolutely bonking. I started shoveling down kids‚Äô protein bars and grabbing whatever I could during the coffee break just to stay with the pack, but my energy level was really perilous. I knew that if I lost the group, I was absolutely done. At that point, I had no matches left to burn.

Then, at around 2:15, disaster struck. While riding the desert flats, my JetBlack trainer lost connection, and suddenly, I had no watts. I absolutely panicked. I jumped off the bike, unplugged and replugged the smart trainer, jumped back on, and re-paired it. The whole process took maybe 20 seconds, but when I looked up, the group was off in the distance. I was devastated.

But then, I saw him‚ÄîTony, coming back alone for me. I rode in his draft, fought my way back into the pack, and finished the ride.

I buy and always have handy easy to eat food such as soup, dumplings, ramen, youghurt, peanut butter, tuna, cold cuts and fruit so I don't necessarily have to cook if I don't want to. Oh, and ice cream also :)

I have my bestie penpal I message everyday.

I try and create a work material everyday to know I am doing something productive.

I throw one item out each day; we were pack rats and we did not even know it.

If I buy something new, I donate two things. One shirt in, two shirts out.

I have a list of the most important thing to do tomorrow. I only have on thing each day to do.

I always have instant coffee in case I am too tired to make regular coffee. I never drank instant before the last year.

I leave the house and I walk 10,000 steps everyday. This is the only exercise I get.

I've isolated since I was a little kid and until recently (36 *sigh*), I'd never made a long-term effort at building community. Interactions with friends got so underhanded and condescending that I finally moved to a new state with a grand total of no friends. 

After most interactions, I'm racked with anxiety over how I came across as awkward or pathetic to guys and creepy or off-putting to girls. I've decided that in order to build the resources I need, I ultimately need to maintain a bunch of relatively shallow support networks. 

I have a local therapy group I've been going to which has been life-changing. It's a circle of other isolated people who openly and vulnerably talk through the deepest, realest stuff. I've never had that with family, much less friends. 

When it comes to friends, I've been chasing down local music groups to play guitar with people, getting people's IG when we chat at coffee shops (if they're interested in becoming study buddies), and working on getting involved in local volunteer groups. 

The idea is to set my expectations at bottom-basement level. If a coffee shop person ghosts me, I have no investment. Same for music groups. I feel like there are drawbacks to maintaining only shallow friendships, but the feeling of having nobody around gets to you after a while.

Did full panel bloodwork as I've struggled with a myriad of mental health issues and wanted more insight. Have high cholesterol for my age and liver enzymes show some indication of fatty liver. 

Otherwise, showing that I have mostly heathy ranges on my bloodwork. 

Mentally my drive is medium/low without some form of stimulant. I drink 2-3 coffees per day. Libido is low. Energy levels feel sub optimal. I work in Sales and sit most of the day, also live in a place with limited sunlight exposure at the moment. 

Here's what I'm doing to combat it right now:

* Lifting weights 3-6 times per week, high intensity
* 15 min of cardio \~3 times per week
* Sauna for 15-30 minutes, 3-5 times per week
* Sleep before 11, wake at 8:30 (3mg Liposomal melatonin + sleep mask)
* Eliminated refined sugars besides honey 
* Eliminated dairy and grain products 
* Eliminated 90% processed foods
* Rare use of boxers/briefs - mainly cotton when using
* Supplement list for test includes: Boron (3mg), Shilajit, Zinc (50mg), Beef Organ Supplement, Pine Pollen Tincture, butea superba (800mg powder, 33mg extract), Methylated B complex.  

  
Diet currently is pretty restrictive, as I'm working on an intense gut healing protocol. The daily diet looks like:

**Breakfast:** huge morning smoothie with mixed berries, avocado, spinach, broccoli sprouts, 10-20g fiber, 25G collagen, and more. Aiming for 50-60g protein. 

**Lunch:** 250g Ground beef, sweet potato, olive oil, sauerkraut, lettuce

**Snack:** Sardines, Dates, dark chocolate, Raw honey

**Dinner:** Chicken/beef, sweet potato, mixed root veggies. 

I add salt/mineral packs to my water.

I am 100% sober.

  
I've been following this for about a month and feeling definitely better, however I'm looking to absolutely maximize this and get my levels to like 700+ at least. I'm convinced this is a root problem of many of my issues mentally has to do with my test being low, or my test being low is hinting at a deeper root cause. I did blood work back at age 23-24 and had very similar numbers. For additional context, I smoked a shit load of weed from age 14-22 and figure that has crashed my test in development.

Would appreciate any and all insights and suggestions to get myself back on track. Any great supplements, protocols, practices, etc... I am wide open!

1iewli0,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1iewli0/we_keep_counting_one_more/,We keep counting one more.,"(Inspired by [X](https://www.reddit.com/r/notneccesarily/comments/198v6rm/story_notes_camping_trip/). Very first link.) 

Last night me and 3 other friends went on a camping trip. I regret going. We all had packed our own chairs but had big enough tents to fit 2 people. Savanna had brought the ice chest of drinks, Daniel brought a few snacks, and my closest friend Lana had ridden with me in my car. We chatted and sang along to some songs as we started getting closer to the parking lot. Her and I were the first ones there so we sat in my car still talking. Savanna and Daniel arrived in their separate cars, and started grabbing everything out of their trunks. Lana grabbed her chair while I grabbed the tent and my chair.  We all walked to the campsite, too scared to venture too far from the parking lot, so we walked far enough away to just barely see it. 



Lana set up everyone‚Äôs tents, I set up the chairs, while Savanna and Daniel were having their typical sibling arguments over where to put the snacks and ice chest. They eventually settled down and Daniel walked off somewhere. The four of us chatted when Daniel came back and groaned in frustration. ‚ÄúYou girls will start the fire but didn‚Äôt have the decency to set up my chair?? I see y‚Äôall‚Äôs priorities.‚Äù We all stared at each other in confusion because I remembered setting up everyone‚Äôs chair‚Ä¶ I slowly counted everybody, however getting to the last person my head just felt fuzzy, and like they were just a black blur. I wiped my eyes and tried again but my mind kept going blank. I asked Savanna and she started counting but with the same result. Daniel huffed in confusion as he realized the 4th chair was in fact empty.

As the fire started fading and our conversations lessened, we realized it was time to pair up and sleep. Grouping up Daniel realized he was the only person without a partner. I stole a glance at Lana and she returned the confused expression. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry Daniel you have that person right there.‚Äù Stated Lana, pointing right behind him. He whipped around so fast he almost lost his footing. ‚ÄúDude! Lana that is so not cool, you can‚Äôt scare me like that what the fuck!!‚Äù Yelled Daniel. Lana gave him a terrified expression realizing what she said and started mumbling to herself, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I thought- I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù. We all grouped up and I said ‚ÄúWhat the hell is going on?? Why do we keep counting five people when there is only four?‚Äù ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs get some sleep‚Ä¶ maybe we can figure it out tomorrow‚Ä¶‚Äù someone behind me said.

Daniel slept with me while Lana and Savanna slept in their tent. I woke up in a cold sweat to hear Savanna screaming her lungs out. Me and Daniel tore open the tent and ran over to her to figure out what happened. Daniel started shaking her and yelling while I followed where she was looking. ‚ÄúD-Daniel‚Ä¶ oh my god‚Ä¶ what the fuck‚Ä¶‚Äù I stuttered. He looked over and let out a loud scream. Lana‚Äôs head was cut off hanging by the hair from the top of the tent while her body remained in her blood soaked sleeping bag. Daniel grabbed Savanna by the arm and bolted while me and someone else followed in pursuit. Savanna started prying away from Daniel and ran in an opposite direction. He started yelling after her until her screaming stopped. ‚ÄúDaniel!! Who the hell is following behind us?‚Äù I panted out. He shot a confused look that soon turned to rage and slowed down. ‚ÄúKeep running!! I‚Äôll buy you some time!‚Äù He jumped behind us, pocket knife in hand while I heard grunts of struggle behind me. It soon died down and I ran like hell. As soon as I reached the parking lot I wasted no time lunging into my car and peeling out onto the main road. My legs felt like they were on fire from the running and my lungs felt like they were going to burst.

I‚Äôm currently parked and sat inside of a small coffee shop just barely out of town. I‚Äôm writing this down while I watch the police cars zoom past to the forest I just left.

One Piece is still my favorite story ever told, however its by no means perfect and above having its fair share of criticism, especially in the certain parts of the timeskip (looking at you Punk Hazard and Wano)

I definitely agree that there has been poor storytelling elements post-timeskip, but was there a moment where you felt the magic was lost?

For me, it was Kinemon‚Äôs mickey mouse survival. I truly believe him staying alive is a disservice to the samurai‚Äôs arc, especially as his own character arc was entirely completed by that time, and it took away from Wano‚Äôs stakes.

Second place is Vegapunks yap session. That shit was such a bunch of nonsense. Dude yapped about brewing coffee for half a chapter I mean come on..

All that being said, I still believe in Oda as an author to (hopefully) stick the landing for this final saga. 
Just curious what yalls thoughts are..

My name is David, and I‚Äôm a 29-year-old IT tech from New Jersey on a quest for a meaningful, long-term relationship with someone who shares my values and passions.

**A bit about me:**

I‚Äôm about 5‚Äô10‚Äù, bald but naturally blond, and I sport a stylish beard. My usual attire includes black band shirts and black jeans‚Äîthink laid-back, metalhead vibes with a touch of nerdy charm. If that sounds like your kind of aesthetic, we might just click! (Pics here: [https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0](https://imgur.com/a/la9rWt0))

**What I‚Äôm into:**

When I‚Äôm not diving into the worlds of extreme metal (Black Metal is my jam) or gaming, I enjoy spending time with friends doing things like:

‚Ä¢ Camping trips under the stars

‚Ä¢ Exploring museums

‚Ä¢ Renaissance faire adventures

‚Ä¢ Watching movies (especially showing my best friend ones he hasn‚Äôt seen)

‚Ä¢ Playing board games or video games

Recently, I‚Äôve started learning a new language („Åì„Çì„Å´„Å°„ÅØ!) and experimenting with building Gundam model kits.

**Professionally:**

I work in IT and hold a Bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science and Information Systems. My job keeps me busy but also lets me hang out with a great group of coworkers.

**Personality-wise:**

I‚Äôm laid-back, lighthearted, and always quick with a joke to brighten the mood. I don‚Äôt drink, smoke, or do drugs (not even coffee!), but I‚Äôm completely cool with others enjoying their drinks around me. My friends would probably describe me as funny, reliable, and someone who thrives on meaningful connections.

**What I‚Äôm looking for:**

I‚Äôm hoping to meet someone younger (ideally between 18 and 24) who‚Äôs also looking to build a future together. I‚Äôd love to find someone whose experiences and goals align with mine, so we can grow and share meaningful moments side by side. While I don‚Äôt have a timeline in mind for things like eloping or kids, I value the idea of creating a life full of shared adventures and growth.

I‚Äôm especially drawn to someone with an average or slim body type. I‚Äôm not a fan of tattoos, but piercings aren‚Äôt a big deal, so don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if we connect on other levels!

If you‚Äôre a fellow nerd, gamer, or someone who shares my love for metal, movies, and meaningful connections, I‚Äôd love to hear from you. Send me a message and a picture‚ÄîI‚Äôm looking forward to getting to know you better!",2,1738377607.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

""Nope. Not in five years of friendship,"" I replied. I didn‚Äôt drink coffee‚Äîmy stomach had an issue with it. So, I bit into my chocolate bar instead.

""What do you think changed, Elena?""

""Her apartment?"" I laughed. ""I mean, if you're asking what's recently changed in her life, she just moved. Not far from here.""

""Maybe that‚Äôs why she asked to meet up here?""

""Still extremely unusual. I mean, it‚Äôs Alice we‚Äôre talking about. There are plenty of not-so-crowded places around here.""

Leyla lifted her head, her expression shifting like she had just spotted something‚Äîor someone‚Äîshe‚Äôd been waiting for.

""Speak of the devil. There she is.""

""The devil?"" I laughed again.

""No, Shithead! Alice!"" Leyla had always been an¬†unpleasant woman.

I turned around to see Alice just a few steps behind me, walking with her long black hair swaying elegantly.

""It‚Äôs unusual for you to ask to meet up in a crowded place like this,"" I said as she sat down in the last chair at our table.

""Really? Oh. I guess I didn‚Äôt think it through,"" Alice replied casually.

Her answer made me uneasy. Something felt¬†off about her that night, but I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it.

I watched as Alice and Leyla talked.

It was Alice. She looked like Alice. She wore Alice‚Äôs favorite outfit. But something about her didn‚Äôt feel right. Leyla didn‚Äôt seem to notice‚Äîor maybe she didn‚Äôt care.

""How about,"" Alice said to both of us, ""I invite you guys to my new apartment? It‚Äôs close by.""

We all agreed, and soon, the three of us were walking toward her new place.

We passed through the apartment gate, and I trailed behind Leyla and Alice, who were chatting as if they had the world to themselves. I paid close attention to Alice. The more I observed her, the more I felt like something was wrong.

""Alice,"" I called out her name.

""Yeah, El?"" she responded.

""What are the last four digits of my phone number?""

Alice laughed. ""How should I know? It‚Äôs your number, El. I have it saved, but I don‚Äôt remember it off¬†the top of my head.""

Weird. The last four digits of my number were her birth date and month‚Äîa long-standing inside joke between us. She used to remember it effortlessly.

""Here we are,"" Alice said proudly.

Alice showed us her living room. It was stylish and cozy, with a single bedroom.

""What does the bedroom look like?"" Leyla asked, moving toward it.

""The electrical system is broken,"" Alice explained, opening the bedroom door and flipping the light switch. ""I‚Äôll get it fixed first thing tomorrow.""

The light didn‚Äôt turn on‚Äîjust as she said.

When they¬†returned to the living room, my eyes caught something on the ceiling. It was dark inside, but with the help of the light from outside, I could see that the bulb in her bedroom wasn't installed.

So, it wasn‚Äôt the electrical system.

When I turned to close the door, I noticed something hanging at the bottom of the closet door. It looked like long, dark fabric.

My gut told me to check it out.

When Leyla and Alice weren‚Äôt paying attention, I slipped back into the bedroom. Kneeling down, I touched the fabric.

It wasn‚Äôt fabric.

It was hair. Long, black hair.

A chill ran down my spine.

Was it a wig? Or...was it someone?

Again, my gut urged me to open the closet door. Just a little‚Äîjust enough to see inside.

The moment I realized what it was, I bolted upright, ran to Leyla, grabbed her hand, and dragged her out of the room.

""El? Hey! What the hell? Where are you taking me? What about Alice?"" Leyla muttered, confused.

I didn‚Äôt answer.

""El?!""

""Quiet. I‚Äôll tell you later.""

Once we were outside the apartment building, I explained.

""So, what was it? A wig?"" Leyla asked, baffled.

""No,"" I replied, trembling. ""It was a person. A dead person.""

""What?! Who?!""

""Alice.""

""What the fuck, El? That‚Äôs absurd!"" Leyla shouted hysterically. ""Alice was just with me in the living room!""

""It was dark, but I was close enough to see it was Alice. Dead. In the closet. Which means there were two Alices. I don‚Äôt know which one‚Äôs real. But if the one in the closet is the real Alice, then we‚Äôre in grave danger.""

""Then who was the Alice who met us at the caf√©?"" Leyla‚Äôs voice trembled.

""I don‚Äôt know!""

""What do we do now?""

""We tell the building guard and ask for help.""

Reluctantly, Leyla agreed.

Drew, the building guard, accompanied us to Alice‚Äôs apartment. We knocked. No answer. Drew unlocked the door with his spare key, and we stepped inside.

We found Alice in the closet.

Dead.

Leyla and I screamed in horror. After discussing with Drew, we decided to call the police and wait outside the apartment.

While we waited, I noticed someone leaving the apartment across from Alice‚Äôs. A beautiful woman with long black hair.

The moment I saw her, I felt uneasy‚Äîthe same uneasiness I‚Äôd felt when Alice approached us at the caf√©¬†earlier that night.

I brushed it off and returned to my conversation with Leyla and Drew. But then, I felt someone watching me.¬†I turned my head to see the woman who had come out of the apartment across from Alice's. She stood there, a few meters away from me, staring at me with a strange and eerie expression.

And then, for a fleeting moment, her face shifted.

It became Alice‚Äôs face.

Seconds later, it shifted back.

Some of you may recognize this story - if so, hi guys! And I apologize, this is a bit of a long one, but hopefully enjoyable in its sad cringey sort of way.

So a number of years ago I worked for a quite large NFP, I think we had probably around a thousand users at the time. Well, they used to be an NFP, not sure if they still are, at least fully. They got tired of selling all the Koolaid and started drinking it themselves, which is to say the execs wanted a lot more of the pie.

One morning I walk in and sit down at my computer and before I can log in the junior sysadmin says ""Hey, we got hit by ransomware"" and just starts laughing. He was a funny guy, and I couldn't always tell when he meant to be funny. I knew he was serious though. To myself I was like ""Well I don't need coffee now,"" and logged in to check for myself - maybe preserve my device. Lo and behold, those lovely little text files we all know and love sitting all over my desktop.

I confirmed I was seeing it too, and he laughs again and goes ""Yeah I'm watching files be encrypted realtime on the server. You should see this."" Walk over and take a look and sure enough one by one they're being encrypted, and just then the sysadmin walks in. He goes to his desk and the junior says ""Hey, we've got ransomware."" Without seeing anything he just goes ""No we don't.""

I go ""Yup, I just confirmed it, mine is locked too.""

He just snarkily goes ""Well maybe YOU have ransomware,"" as if to accuse me. I asked if he'd even taken a look knowing full well he didn't. He logs into his system and as it turned out HE had it too, something he was more than a little grumpy about. He looked over the shoulder on the junior and just rolls his eyes. After a few minutes the manager comes in and sees what's going on.

The manager himself was not a terrible sysadmin but he obviously didn't know a thing about ransomware, despite reading all day and watching lots of tech YouTube. He's throwing out completely absurd and unhelpful suggestions and I'm just shooting them down left and right. ""Pull the plug on the servers, now,"" I tell them. ""If we haven't taken stock of what's infected, it's clearly spreading across the network and we need to save what we can, or at least stop the spread.""

The sysadmin said something to handwave the suggestion saying we still didn't know what was infected, and one of the helpdesk said there were a bunch of tickets about ransomware from basically every site.

Just about then our fearless CTO walked in to say his usual (occasional) good morning. His demeanor said nothing was wrong to him, meaning he'd just gotten in as always. ""We have ransomware throughout the network, including servers,"" I told him to head off the denials. Apparently I hadn't headed them off. ""We don't know that"" the sysadmin said, still apparently doing nothing. ""Shut it all down"" is all I can say.

We showed him the files being encrypted, and the example of my desktop. He went to the sysadmin and just talked with him, who continued to deny everything. The manager went over to talk with them, again offering suggestions not based in reality. ""I found a product that can reverse ransomware!"" he said triumphantly. This was before some of the ransomware had started having decryptors published and other resolutions. Our AV had no idea what to do with it - Symantec as I recall.

""You can't reverse ransomware,"" I say. ""You need the encryption key and it won't know that.""

""This says it can!"" This goes back and forth for a bit, and having finally given up to let him chase his tail, I pull out my phone and send an all staff email informing everyone of the situation, and to shut down their computers. No point in letting the ransomware run wildfire.

The CTO never wipes his stupid selling you something smile off his face, and announces to the room ""It looks like you all have this under control. I have to leave to start my vacation for the long weekend. Let me know if you need anything!"" And like that, he's gone. I'm stunned. I knew he wasn't good for anything but I'm still shocked that he would just shrug off a company wide ransomware attack.

The manager comes back in with a blank look on his face and says ""It won't work, it needs to be installed before the ransomware attack."" I say again ""Because it needs to identify the key, which it gets in the process of it happening. Can we shut everything down now?""

Finally the manager starts managing enough to say ""Shut it down."" Our junior goes ""Oh, it finished encrypting a while ago,"" and shuts the servers down. The manager goes to his desk - I find out later he's got his head down and is sobbing because he knows what this means.

In a roundtable I suggest at this point it's faster for us to just start wiping devices and sneakernetting MDT image reinstalls. ""Do you know how long that'll take"" our Sr Helpdesk asks. ""Probably all weekend. But we have to get this back up, I'm up for it if you all are, but I'm not doing it alone. Get the MDT server restored first, and we can get running. Unplug from the network, reinstall from the image, and once that's done we can reconnect everything and get back online.

""Fine, let's do it.""

The sysadmin finally began recovering servers, and by Monday everything was back up. We had a few gripes about users who ""knew"" their system wasn't infected and were mad that they lost all their data that they should've had on the file server, but for the most part it was about as smooth as it could be.

I found out later they only wanted \~$30,000 in Bitcoin. We ended up losing \~$350,000 a day because the CTO couldn't be bothered to engage seriously - or probably to even know what the actual impact would be. Of course the Manager, Sysadmin, and ""Security"" officer who wasn't really all took the fall for him to have his unbothered vacation.

And in a final very neat postscript, I found out much much later that it was the sysadmin that caused all this. He'd been using his regular account which was a FOREST ADMIN, including password, on random sketchy sites and he got us popped. They used our own SCCM against us which explained how it was able to go so wildfire.",8,1738377133.0,sysadmin,5,0.78,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Setting up your first kitchen is an exciting milestone, and knowing the right first home essentials can make all the difference in creating a functional and inviting space. As you embark on this new journey, consider the must-have items that will transform your kitchen into a place where culinary creativity thrives.

To start, investing in quality cookware is essential. Look for a versatile set that includes:

- 1 large skillet
- 1 medium saucepan
- 1 stockpot for soups and stews

Additionally, don‚Äôt forget about essential kitchen gadgets. Consider adding:

- A reliable chef's knife for all your chopping needs
- A cutting board, preferably made of bamboo or plastic
- A measuring cup set for accurate ingredient quantities
- Mixing bowls to prepare and combine ingredients with ease

Next, small appliances can significantly enhance your cooking experience. A microwave and a toaster are invaluable for quick meals and snacks. If you enjoy coffee, a coffee maker should be part of your first home essentials list too. Moreover, a blender is perfect for smoothies and soups, making it a great multifunctional tool.

Storage solutions are also vital in any kitchen. Allocate space for:

- Pots and pans
- Food containers to keep leftovers fresh
- Spices and herbs for flavoring

Lastly, don't overlook the importance of dishware. A basic set of plates, bowls, and glasses will allow you to host friends and family while enjoying meals. With these first home essentials, your kitchen will not only be equipped for cooking but will also become a warm gathering place in your new home.

Almost as much a I disliked Skyler in Breaking Bad, i‚Äôll concede that he has some cracking vocab times and offers his fair share of comic relief but overall I think he‚Äôs a horrible person. 

This persona of wanting the best for everyone; Devon, his baby, his friends and Mark is a facade at best and narcissistic perfectionism at worst. I don‚Äôt doubt that there‚Äôs going to be a reveal as to the bad vibes between him and Mark‚Ä¶ beyond Mark being severed and the Gemma fallout etc. And I appreciate his book was essentially one of the main catalysts for the innies, especially Mark, beginning their revolution. But nevertheless, I still struggle to find him a likeable character. Ever since the dinnerless dinner with him outing Mark and myriad reasons beyond that. I can even see him becoming a Lumon turncloack if it meant furthering his career as a writer or otherwise. The only thing that could redeem him for me personally is if he embodies a ‚ÄòHeroic Sacrifice‚Äô trope which they could potentially be building him up for, but I don‚Äôt think so.

What are your thoughts? Because for the most part many people seem to like him, I think because of the bangers he drops - which again I admit he does. The defence i‚Äôm preempting is that he‚Äôs just an innocent soul but I feel that this is invalidated when they were in the birthing hut‚Ä¶ as soon as Devon left to get coffee, his demeanour totally changed as soon as he was alone with Mark, going from his over caring and overly nice persona to being dispassionate or cold at the very least.

In the last 2 years I quit 3 times.

Once for a month. No withdrawals.

Once 6 months later... serious muscle aches in legs..

And now 5 days ago... experiencing nothing again..

At every 2 week mark. I crave coffee very hard, give in. Have one and I feel the coffee for the first few cups.. then it just becomes something that you must have first thing in the morning.. you know the story.. 

Anyway, I have been craving hot chocolates or icdd chocolates as a substitute this time around. 

But also to note, I recently had my own coffee shop.. this made end up drinking 3 medium flat white per day. Most I've ever consumed regularly...


Anyway, qll my friends have always said of this 24 hour headache they'd get, the famous coffee headache for not having caffeine in over 24 hours... I always thought it was odd I never had anything happen... despite being 37 and coffee daily since like 12..

So one day, when reading up about Phenylalanine, as I have PKU... I noticed that phe actually is said to help people with caffeine withdrawal... this I thought must be why I get next to no withdrawals...I always have 10x the normal person's Phenylalanine levels in my blood.


Anyone want to try getting Phenylalanine supplement and trying for themselves, or tried and did or didn't work?

I hope to make it easy the 30 days mark, and beyond this time around.. just weird that I find so much delight in a chocolate drink now.",2,1738376495.0,decaf,0,1.0,False

The woman he‚Äôs going with is someone that he works with that he supervises, since he‚Äôs kind of like the boss. She had an incident at work with a different employee that was being rude to her. My boyfriend said that they were going out to talk about the incident so he can come up with a game plan to speak to that other employee. 

Now I know that he needs to meet with her to both calm her down and get all of the facts, but it just feels kind of icky that they are going out for dinner at a somewhat fancy restaurant. Wouldn‚Äôt a conversation like this take place more over coffee, or at the office? 

I should mention that this is my first relationship, so I don‚Äôt really know what is considered normal or acceptable. We‚Äôve been together for almost 3 years. 

There was also a time that I found pictures of this woman in a thong on my boyfriend‚Äôs phone. When I confronted it about it he said she was just showing him her new tattoo.
