1ka2fvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/type2diabetes/comments/1ka2fvj/new_and_confused/,New and confused,"Hello! 

Two weeks ago my primary care provider (PA) diagnosed me as a type 2, but I'm pretty confused and seeking advice from you lovely ppl bc I know nothing about diabetes. 

When she entered the exam room she said ""I am so sorry to tell you this but you have type 2 diabetes. You blew right passed pre, and into diabetes. If you don't make some serious lifestyle changes you're gonna die young"". W out giving too many personal details, I'm 37, I work out, my diet isn't fantastic but it isn't trash either. I am not overweight. I also have crohns disease. 
She immediately put me on metformin. 

When I went to pick up the prescription my long time pharmacist raised an eyebrow and asked me what my levels were. My a1c at the time of diagnosis/blood work was 5.1 my glucose was 128. I went home and immediately shared my blood work with a friend who is a nurse, and another friend who showed their MD friend. Both said ""this is by no means type 2"". 

I was very confused. This happens to be one diagnosis that I just do not know a lot about. I have a lot of different problems having crohns so I don't consider myself illiterate when it comes to medical stuff but I am out of my depth when it comes to diabetes knowledge. 
At my follow up apt I voiced these concerns while adding that I genuinely do not know anything about diabetes. She doubled down and said these are absolutely type 2 numbers. 

I've been having severe problems at night that are preventing me from sleeping, and the metformin (I'm assuming) absolutely helped them. I also went out and bought a meter. My highest at home reading has been 109 after my morning coffee but no food. All my other readings have been under 100. 

From what I'm seeing from this sub (thank you all for sharing, I'm learning a lot) it's really making me question if I'm missing something else that could make her *so* sure that I have type 2 diabetes. 

Thanks in advance for any help/suggestions!! ",1,1745864045.0,type2diabetes,0,1.0,False
1ka2fpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1ka2fpq/explore_the_krute_carry_on_suitcase_review_is_it/,Explore the Krute Carry On Suitcase Review: Is It Worth the Hype?,"The Krute Carry On Suitcase with wheels (model B0CR129145) has been a welcome addition to my frequent travels. I wanted something lightweight, practical, and perfectly sized for airline carry-on standards, and this suitcase seemed to tick all those boxes. With a sleek hard-shell design and features like a USB charging port, TSA security lock, and smooth wheels, it was hard not to be excited to test it out and see how it held up in real-world conditions.

**Stylish and Practical Design**  
The suitcase's exterior strikes a nice balance between modern aesthetics and durability. Made from a blend of ABS and PC material, it feels lightweight yet strong enough to handle typical travel wear and tear. I love that it’s available in vibrant colors like Light Blue, which not only looks great but is easy to spot at airport baggage areas. At just over 22 inches tall, it complies with most airline carry-on limits, which is a huge relief for someone who hates waiting at baggage claim.  

Surprisingly, even though the material feels slightly pliable under pressure when empty, its performance impressed me once packed. I’ve loaded it up with heavy items and tossed it in car trunks, and it held its shape well. It’s not indestructible, though, as I’ll explain later.  

**Roomy Interior and Thoughtful Compartments**  
Despite looking compact from the outside, this carry-on offers about 40 liters of storage capacity—plenty for a long weekend or short business trip. There are functional compartments and straps inside to keep things organized. On one recent trip, I packed a mix of clothes, toiletries, and even some fragile souvenirs (hello, delicate coffee mugs), and everything made it home safely.  

Having two separate interior sections made unpacking stress-free upon arrival, especially with the zipped divider keeping items in place. However, more small dedicated pockets for smaller accessories like cables or jewelry would be a nice touch.

**Highlights**  
- Smooth and silent 360° spinner wheels for effortless maneuvering.  
- TSA-approved lock for added security.  
- Dual USB charging ports that function seamlessly with a power bank inside.  
- Stylish design available in bold colors that help it stand out.

[Check Krute Carry On Suitcase price on Amazon.](https://bagsby.com/check/b0cr129145/)  

**USB Charging Convenience**  
One feature that felt almost futuristic was the inclusion of USB charging ports. There’s nothing worse than your phone dying halfway through a long layover, and I was thrilled to charge on the go. All I needed was a power bank to connect inside the specially-designed pocket, and voilà—no more hunting for a power outlet in crowded airports.  

**Smooth Rolling and Handling**  
The wheels on this suitcase glide effortlessly across various surfaces. From bumpy sidewalks to smooth airport floors, pushing it around took no effort at all, even when fully loaded. I especially noticed how quiet the wheels were—they didn’t squeak or rattle, which can sometimes be an annoyance with cheaper options. The telescoping handle feels sturdy and provides multiple height adjustments for comfortable pulling or pushing.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
While there are many positives, there are some critiques to address:  
- The retractable handle wobbles slightly when extended, which makes me question its long-term durability.  
- There’s no side or bottom grip, making it slightly tricky to lift into overhead compartments.   
- The middle section of the case can dent or show marks under extreme force, such as being thrown around by airline staff.  

**Peer Products**  
Comparing this suitcase to other carry-on options like Samsonite Omni PC or Travelpro Platinum Elite, several differences stand out. The Krute Carry On Suitcase offers comparable storage space and an unbeatable USB charging option not typically found in similarly-priced competitors. However, Samsonite excels in overall build quality and has a more rigid shell that resists deep scratches. Meanwhile, Travelpro focuses on luxurious interiors and expandable space, which the Krute model lacks.  

This product carves out a niche for travelers who prioritize functionality and affordability over premium materials or expandable capacity. Its price point and appealing features make it an excellent mid-tier option.

**Value for Money**  
At its core, the Krute suitcase balances affordability and utility well. While it may not be the cheapest thing out there, the solid construction, TSA-approved lock, and bonus features like USB ports elevate it to a sweet spot of cost-effectiveness. Is it worth the investment? If you travel a moderate amount and don’t need ultra-premium materials, absolutely. Just make sure you're treating it carefully during flights where baggage handlers might not be so gentle.

1ka2eys,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestWirelessProducts/comments/1ka2eys/can_soundcore_a20i_true_wireless_earbuds_deliver/,Can Soundcore A20i True Wireless Earbuds Deliver Superior Sound Quality Review?,"The Soundcore by Anker A3948 True Wireless Earbuds has become an integral part of my daily routine. My experience testing these earbuds has been intriguing, and while I'm mostly happy with their performance, there are a few points worth mentioning for anyone considering them. Here's a detailed breakdown based on daily use, exploring both their strengths and areas where they could improve.

**Design and Comfort**  
These earbuds are impressively compact and lightweight, making them perfect for portable use. I toss them in my bag without a second thought, and they hardly take up any space thanks to the slim charging case. The included lanyard is a small but thoughtful touch, ensuring I never lose track of them. When I wore them during lengthy meetings or while jamming to my playlist during a commute, their ergonomic design kept my ears comfortable. I appreciate that they didn’t feel intrusive, unlike some bulkier earbuds that can become a nuisance after hours of use. That said, the plastic build, while durable, doesn’t quite scream “premium.” It gets the job done but might not wow those who are picky about materials.

**Battery Life and Convenience**  
Battery life is where these earbuds truly shine. I’ve clocked up to 28 hours of playback when factoring in the charging case. A single charge delivers around 9 hours, which easily covers an entire workday for me. On one occasion, I forgot to charge them overnight, but a quick 10-minute charge provided an impressive 2 hours of playback. For someone like me who often forgets to plug in devices, this fast-charging feature is a lifesaver. The convenience of automatic reconnection to the last device used also adds to the seamless experience.

[Don’t miss **Soundcore A3948** deals—check Amazon here.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0btybvr4s/)

**Performance and Customization Features**  
When it comes to sound quality, these earbuds didn’t disappoint. Using the Soundcore app, I could access 22 preset EQ settings that allowed me to tweak the audio to my liking. My favorite is the BassUp preset, which boosted the bass just enough for my podcasts and playlists to feel richer. I’m a fan of the degree of customization – from adjusting tap controls to personalizing sound profiles, there’s plenty of room for tailoring the experience. Despite its many ups, audiophiles might find the soundstage a bit narrow compared to high-end models. For most casual listeners like me, though, it’s more than enough.

**Call Clarity and AI Technology**  
Making calls with these earbuds has been a game changer. The dual microphones, combined with the AI algorithm, ensured my voice was clear even when I stepped into noisier environments like coffee shops. My coworkers never complained about background noise during virtual meetings, which was a common gripe with my older earbuds. However, there was the occasional dip in quality when transitioning between silent and noisy areas mid-call, which was a tad annoying.

**Strengths**  
- Lightweight and comfortable design for extended wear.  
- Customization options with the Soundcore app, including 22 EQ presets.  
- Fast charging and extensive playback time.  

**Negative Attributes**  
- Plastic materials feel a bit basic.  
- Sudden call quality dips during transitions between noise levels.

**Water Resistance and Durability**  
Water resistance is an often underrated feature, and these earbuds nail it with an IPX5 rating. A sweaty workout session or light rain during a walk never made me nervous about damaging them. While I wouldn’t dare take them swimming, they can handle everyday mishaps admirably. However, with a lightweight build comes a slight fear of wear and tear. Only time will tell how well they hold up against frequent use.

**Product Alternatives**  
Comparing these to similar offerings, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 and Jabra Elite 3 come to mind. The Galaxy Buds 2 outshine in aesthetics and offer a more premium feel, but their battery life doesn’t match the A20i’s endurance. Jabra Elite 3 leans on durability and ruggedness with slightly better call quality, but it lacks the extensive customization that Soundcore delivers via its app. The Soundcore earbuds feel like the perfect middle ground for users who want diverse functionality without overly straining their budget.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Considering the solid mix of features, these earbuds are a strong contender in their price range. While not everyone will fall in love with the plastic build, the overall functionality and sound customization make this product feel like a smart investment. It strikes a great balance between affordability and premium features, appealing to a broad audience. Whether you’re an everyday user or someone who frequently makes calls on the go, these earbuds feel worth the splash.

1ka2etd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ka2etd/should_you_consider_the_yabano_cm6816_espresso/,Should you consider the Yabano CM6816 espresso machine? Honest review inside!,"I’ve been daily testing the **Yabano Espresso Machine, CM6816**, over the past couple of weeks and, as a coffee enthusiast who takes caffeine breaks semi-seriously, I’ve had a chance to dig deep into its quirks and perks. A machine promising to deliver espresso, cappuccinos, and lattes with its 3.5Bar pressure is a tempting invite for coffee drinkers like myself who prefer crafting their own brews. While my experience has been satisfying overall, there were moments when I raised an eyebrow—sometimes impressed, sometimes concerned.

**Compact Design and Kitchen Fit**  
This machine arrived neatly packed, and right out of the box, it had a compact form factor that my limited counter space loved. Its dimensions (13.43""D x 10.94""W x 7.6""H) mean it doesn’t dominate the kitchen, leaving me room to actually prep other ingredients for breakfast. At just 4.66 lbs, moving it around felt like carrying a textbook. The black metallic design made it look sophisticated without shouting for attention. My friend, who has a minimalistic kitchen aesthetic, was immediately impressed when she saw it sitting cozy in my corner. The size, however, may make it a tight fit for someone needing to prepare drinks for a big family all at once.

**Ease of Use and Operation Simplicity**  
What stands out here is just how beginner-friendly it is. As someone who often wakes up groggy, the straightforward button interface became a lifesaver. Unlike complex machines that make you feel like you’re prepping for a space launch, this device gets straight to the point. Pour water, scoop in coffee grounds, lock the filter, and voila! Four cups of espresso come out quickly. My coworker—who’s never brewed a fancy drink before but was intrigued by this—managed to whip up a decent latte in under ten minutes without needing a crash course in “espresso machine wizardry.”

**Upsides**  
Here are just a few positive features that have kept this espresso machine on my radar:  
- **Beginner Friendly**: Easy for first-time users without complicated configurations.  
- **Compact Yet Functional**: Doesn’t hog counter space yet delivers solid functionality.  
- **Creamy Foam Fun**: Lets you craft cappuccinos and lattes with a creamy milk frother that works decently.  
- **Effortless Cleanup**: Removable parts like the drip tray and portafilter make cleaning painless.  
- **Affordable Entry-Level Brewing**: A gateway espresso machine for budget-conscious coffee enthusiasts.

**Frothing Experience: Mixed Feelings**  
Speaking of the steam wand, I gave it a spin to whip up some frothy cappuccino goodness. It produces creamy foam after a little bit of learning on how to position the milk container just right. On my first try, my latte foam was too dense (rookie mistake), but by day three, I could practically hear the foam cheering me on with its perfect consistency. However, I’ve read from others that frothing milk for larger drinks can be a bit of a time drain due to its power; my experience lines up with this. My cousin, who wanted extra creamy lattes, got a bit impatient waiting. She ultimately resorted to using her trusty electric frother gadget instead.

**Limitations**  
Yet, not everything about this espresso machine is roses and rainbows. Here are some downsides I noticed:  
- **Limited Pressure**: The 3.5Bar pressure is acceptable for casual home brewing but fails to deliver robust cafe-quality crema that higher-pressure machines can achieve.  
- **Build Quality Concerns**: Light plastic components make it feel less durable compared to premium, sturdy metal models.  
- **Manual Off Switch Issues**: I’ve occasionally walked away, forgetting to double-check the side-positioned “OFF” button. A more visible auto-off feature could seriously save sanity.  

**Comparing Against Other Espresso Makers**  
Over the years, I’ve dabbled with a few espresso machines like the De'Longhi Bar Pump Espresso or Breville Bambino Plus. While these models boast high-pressure functionality and better crema, they often come with hefty price tags and bulkier setups. The Yabano machine fills a unique niche as a compact, entry-level option that delivers decent results without driving you to contemplate dipping into your savings account. On the other hand, its primary rivals, such as the Mr. Coffee Steam Espresso Maker, might offer competitive pricing but lack the user-friendly design and simple milk frothing components. While it doesn’t outperform the high-end competitors, it can certainly hold its own for modest expectations.

**Price Worthiness**  
I’ve been weighing the cost of this little powerhouse not just in dollars but in coffee satisfaction. Sure, you aren’t getting Breville-level vibes or competition-worthy shots of espresso; however, you’re also saving enough to rationally enjoy other luxuries, like premium coffee beans without blowing your entire budget. This machine serves up a great value proposition for budding latte artists or anyone exploring their caffeine-love journey. The low investment, combined with ease of operation, makes the deal worthwhile even with its compromise on pressure.

1ka2eqx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ka2eqx/explore_the_bella_steam_espresso_maker_review_for/,Explore the BELLA Steam Espresso Maker Review for Barista-Quality Coffee at Home,"The BELLA 35105-043A Steam Espresso Maker is like having your own mini barista at home. Given its compact build and sleek oatmilk color, it easily blends into my kitchen's aesthetic without hogging counter space. I've always wanted to craft cafe-style lattes and cappuccinos, and with this product, I finally got the chance. Its 3.5-bar steam pressure creates that rich, full-bodied espresso with a golden crema on top—the kind that makes sipping coffee feel indulgent. Yet, no device comes without quirks, so let's unpack its features and my hands-on experience while testing it.

**Compact Design and Build Quality**  
The espresso maker is small enough to fit snugly on any countertop, making it perfect for apartments or smaller kitchens. It's surprisingly lightweight, which I both love and don't. On the one hand, it's easy to move around when cleaning; on the other, its lack of heft means you need to hold it steady when locking or unlocking the portafilter. Plus, since the entire exterior is made of plastic, it’s not quite as premium-feeling as some pricier models. Despite this, the oatmilk color gives it a refined, modern vibe that many people might appreciate.  

**Ease of Use**  
The first night I began using the espresso maker, I found it straightforward. I ran plain water through the glass carafe to prep it, as instructions suggested. Operating this machine is refreshingly simple: a single knob lets you toggle between brewing and steaming. There's minimal guesswork, which is fantastic for someone like me who didn’t exactly ace their coffee-making 101 class. However, I did notice that locking the portafilter sometimes causes the machine to slide slightly since the feet lack strong grip. Anti-slip mats should honestly be included but, alas, they are not.

**Positives**  
- Builds up to 3.5 bars of pressure for solid espresso shots.  
- Integrated steam wand creates creamy microfoam for lattes and cappuccinos.  
- Features like the dishwasher-safe glass carafe and removable drip tray make cleaning a breeze.  

**Favorable Aspects**  
- Comes with helpful tools like a 2-in-1 measuring scoop and tampering tool.  
- Reusable stainless-steel filter reduces waste and brewing costs.  
- Maintains a neat, clutter-free look with its cord tie.  

[Check BELLA 35105-043A price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0cyj7w2ss/)

**Milk Frothing Performance**  
Let’s talk about frothing—the quintessential step for making cafe-level drinks, and honestly, it's where this little machine punches above its weight. The steam wand had me intimidated at first because of its low positioning, but once I figured out the angles, wow! The frothy, smooth microfoam it produces is genuinely cafe-worthy. I used oat milk and was pleasantly surprised by how well it frothed up. My wife, who loves cappuccinos, even commented on how the froth had a velvety texture she hadn’t expected from an affordable espresso maker.

On the flip side, positioning the milk pitcher under the wand requires some creativity since the wand is quite close to the base. I had to turn the machine slightly sideways to accommodate my bigger cups, which felt awkward.  

**Negatives**  
- Lightweight frame lacks stability, requiring extra care during use.  
- Milk frother being low to the base makes steaming slightly cumbersome.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Rubberized feet for a more secure setup.  
- Improvements to the steam wand's height for better ergonomics.  

**Espresso Quality**  
The coffee itself? Surprisingly good. Using Lavazza medium grounds, I got a balanced, flavorful shot of espresso that had more body than I’ve achieved with machines three times the price. While it’s not a ""true"" espresso like you’d get from professional-grade machines, it’s darn close. Still, keep in mind this is a steam machine, so don’t expect that unmistakably intense, pump-driven espresso. But for most casual coffee drinkers, this creates a very satisfying cup.

**Challengers in the Market**  
When compared to rivals like Nespresso, Keurig, or even Breville's entry-level models, the BELLA Steam Espresso Maker mainly stands out for its affordability. Machines like Nespresso are known for convenience and consistency due to their capsules but lack the hands-on engagement I personally enjoy. Breville’s compact alternatives offer more premium builds and better grind control but come with a much steeper price tag. The BELLA excels as a budget-friendly piece of equipment for beginners experimenting with lattes or cappuccinos but might feel limiting for espresso aficionados looking for customizable features.  

**Affordable Quality**  
The price-to-performance ratio of this espresso maker is honestly hard to beat. If you're the kind of person hesitant about dropping hundreds on a coffee machine just to test the espresso waters, this model is a no-brainer. With the reusable filter alone, you’re saving money compared to machines requiring proprietary pods or capsules. Add in the easy cleanup, and you’re looking at a product that offers way more than what you'd expect in this price range.

I was waiting in line to get a coffee on the street. A crow snatched my eye and flew away. The old woman in front of me saw my situation and gave me an olive. ""Put this on your eye."" she said. I thought it was an ancient healing method (Yeah, i'm stupid). I put an olive in my eye. I got my coffee and sat on a bank. A man sat next to me. He licked my eyes and swallowed the olive. He stuck his tongue into my eye cavity. The tip of his tongue moved into my brain like the arm of an octopus. It tickled my brain. Then stick his tongue back. ""Go to a doctor, you have very little life left."" he said. Then I went to a doctor. The doctor opened my mouth, spat in it and said ""You healed."" (I didn't ask the doctor anything about my eye because I could hardly afford the cost of this treatment.) I went out and met the old woman who gave me olive.  ""Where's the olive?""  she asked.  ""A man ate it.""  I said.  ""You owe me an olive!""  said the old woman and put handcuffs on my wrists.  She dragged me to her house.  She kicked my stomach.  Then she sold me to an organ mafia on the darkweb. Two members of the mafia took me to a doctor to have a look at the quality of my organs. The doctor was the doctor I went to before. The doctor told them that I'm not worth a penny, that I'm going to die soon.  In this case the mafia boys thought of something for me. So my debt to the old woman has now passed to the organ mafia. I started working with them. My job was to lure people on the street into their traps. One day I paid my debt. I was freed, they even gave me free eyes. I put on my new eye and returned to my 10 square meter house. On the first day of my freedom, my doorbell rang. I opened the door, it was the doctor in front of me. The Doctor said ""Now you owe me."" He knocked me out with one blow.  When I woke up he had me tied to my bed. He placed a glass tube in my stomach.  He turned me into a living bong. He bubbling and smoking me. ""We're going to hang out like this every day with you. I'm your best friend now. See you tomorrow darling.""  he said to me and left the house. While I was lying on the bed, a crow entered my room and took out my two eyes. Everything went dark. My stomach started rumbling with hunger. The crow dropped a piece of cheese in my mouth and flew away with my eyes.

I’m hoping to connect with someone who enjoys real conversation, the kind that isn’t just about passing time, but about actually seeing the person on the other end. I like a mix of deep thoughts and light moments. Sometimes the best conversations flow between the two.

I’m 27, based in England, but I’m open to connecting with people from anywhere. I work from home, which means I get to enjoy my morning coffee whenever I want, and occasionally find myself chatting with my puppies like they are my colleagues. I’m good at cooking, especially when I get into a new recipe, and baking is something I find really satisfying. I also enjoy being outside, running, hiking, or just going for a walk to reset my head. I have come to really value the calm parts of the day, the ones most people rush through. I’m flexible with timing, so whether you are an early riser or a night owl, we should be able to make it work no matter your time zone.

Genuineness is something I really appreciate in others. I try to live in a way that’s intentional without being overly serious. I care about being consistent, honest, and kind. I enjoy talking to people who appreciate the little moments in life and who are genuinely interested in getting to know one another. If you are someone who enjoys conversation that does not feel rushed, and you appreciate the little moments in life, I’d enjoy hearing from you.

If this post is still up, I’m still looking to connect!

https://preview.redd.it/7wijvk4g9mxe1.png?width=863&format=png&auto=webp&s=22663256f2b7c6d13e1ca53f40d43756582363b4

1. The retention is almost zero, which is extremely positive, as most grinders tend to have some retention. However, I should mention that I sprayed each batch with water because I noticed static electricity in the coffee I used. I haven’t had time yet to test how it reacts with other coffee varieties or with more precise sieves.

2. The accuracy of finer grind sizes is impressive for such a small grinder. This suggests that the shape of the burrs significantly affects the overall quality.

3. The OutIn Fino grinder is designed with a clean, minimalist aesthetic that aligns with contemporary café and home barista environments. The design is simple and doesn’t distract from the utility of the product.   

4. Beyond appearance, the OutIn Fino grinder provides a highly customizable and intuitive workflow. The inclusion of micro-adjustments for grind size supports a wide range of brew methods, helpful for you if you want to experiment and refine your process of coffee making.

The OutIn Fino grinder uses recycled aluminum for the body and BPA-free, recyclable plastics for non-structural components. The packaging is made of recycled cardboard and printed with soy based inks. Additionally, the motor is energy-efficient, reducing overall power consumption during use. (They’ve focused on sustainability aspect a lot)

Funnily enough it’s the lack of color options that might be annoying for a lot of users. Nano was available in a lot of colors but same cannot be said about Fino.",1,1745863748.0,OutinNano,0,1.0,False

Why do we need it?
Is it that important?

The extant to which we struggle in our daily lives, particularly if you’re a working professional, love, care, affection and empathy are the things that can work wonders to brighten up your otherwise tiring and monotonous life. 😬

- Had a bad day at work?
- Your manager/boss slammed you for some or no reason?
- Had a tiff with your teammate?
- Mentally and physically burned out after work?
- Or just drained out by travelling back home from work?

🥲

Imagine you coming back home and your lover, wife, mother or even your dad, gives you a welcoming hug and hands you a hot cup of tea or a mug of cold coffee! 😍

A smile on their face, making you sit, asking you how was your day? Did you have food? All’s good? 😇

Imagine what just this little much of a gesture can do to your morale! 🥹

This may seem or sound “Just little”. But when you see it from the eyes of the person handing you the cup of tea, it’s UNCONDITIONAL. 🥰

Unconditional love 🫶 
Unconditional care 🤗

1ka2aqc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ka2aqc/the_showers_brought_me_flowers/,The showers brought me flowers,"“Aprils showers bring May flowers”

I’ve had so many “showers”. The adjustment to my agrophobia trashed so many relationships I held near and dear. I’ve always had anxiety, but it swelled to new heights when COVID hit. It felt unmanageable for so long, and my agrophobia also held me captive in my own life. It made me isolated from the ones I love. It made me hate myself. 

Here are my positive steps I made this month:

Going to visit my family member for 5 days. I was out of my house for an entire 5 days. I was safe in my family member’s home but I can’t remember when is the last time I did that. 

Going to the doctor’s office twice this month. Once to get a blood work form, and then today to review my results. Today I had to sit in a crowded room of **20 people for an hour and a half.** That would not have been doable before. 

I then **walked by myself to a coffee shop**. It felt freeing. One minute I was standing in front of the doctor’s office to get picked up, the next thing I knew I was walking. I felt so pent up after being in that stuffy place for 2 hours, that once I set my mind to a small treat I started walking. I walked past incredibly loud traffic. Constant traffic. 

I know this is an ongoing battle, but I’ll be damned if I don’t stop to acknowledge my triumphs while I navigate my new normal. ",1,1745863690.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

Then my emotions lowered a bit cuz I was losing a lil bit of hope but right then she keeps asking to call me during the week and I planned to hang out again and confess my feelings, (it's been a month and a bit by that time), we go as the usual at a coffee shop and then I say ""you wanna go on a rooftop and grab a bottle of wine ?"" She happily agree's, we go there and she tells me smth super private abt a thing with a guy she barley trusted me with this, anyway she tells and I say yk since u trusted me I think i should tell you smth too, her tone changes to a more flirty one so i figured she already knew what was I abt to say and I started by ""yk when I told u I wrote 49 pages in notes abt someone? Yeah that was you"" i told her that on the second hang out that i wrote that much abt a person (just so yall know 49 pages in notes its abt 4-6 pages A4 with normal sized handwriting)
Then i explain my feelings and stuff she says i said it really nice AND WITH THE EXACT WORDS ""I feel the same"" and she rests her head on my shoulder, then we dance and while i was talking (I wasnt planning that but) she started kissing me like straight up woke up with her toungue in my mouth wich took me by surpise but yk heat of the moment I went with it, thr night was beautiful evrething felt so real it almost was like a dream (also my first kiss since I never had feelings for a girl like littleraly never) she said she liked that night too until the end and then she went home cuz her parents called her, anyway nothing bad that i got after that day And I tried to talk her thru text, she seemed a bit dry, it was just a surface talk but it could be cuz yk I still was a little uncomfortable around her Easter was soon so i just said eh maybe she is just not in the mood to talk, that was our whope dynamic usually we sometimes went a whole week without talking just maybe at school during smoke brakes, i knew since it was vacations also her bestfriend we gonna call her A is moving in with her for the whole week like a sleepover while my crushes parents are away we gonna call her D okay next day during easter i didnt text her cuz ik she was busy with family and stuff and I say alr i leave her be, and next day i texted her again to see whats up (we had plans to watch a movie at her place) she says shes with A cuz her family called her, I says alr thats nice and she corrects a spelling mistake of mine and am like she never did that before but alr whatever, and I waited the whole week and friday i decide to ask hey u wanna go out atleast this weekend ? Sent that message at 9 pm, and I say alr idk maybe she drank as a last sleepover day or smth, she texted me next morning saying that she wont come out this weekend cuz she is not feeling well, i alr i hope u feel better sooner but i gotta tell u smth important if u don't got the energy now ill tell u later, she just leaves me on send till 7 pm and says u can tell me now i check my phone from time to time, and am like a bit hurt for responding half hearted but whatever and i ask in a nice way, that i want some clarity cuz after the moment we had we barley talked I said I know she wast with A and stuff but still, atleast give me some clarity to know of u wanna continue what we started, she answers with she thought abt it for a long time and she dosent think we are compatible on a long term, she says sorry for taking so long, i say thats alr and if she could tell me the reason why does she think that i might have an idea but I want to see if its the same, she tells me to tell her the idea cuz she dosent wanna get into too much detail, i tell her cuz of me being a bit boring bcs am not fully comfortable with her since she means a lot to me she says that normal and it's not that, I ask her to please tell me cuz she was diffrent and it would help me to move on, she leaves me on sent for 50 mins and says, u rushed things up like there were times where u were acting like we already were in a long term relationship also the 49 pages (btw i changed the number a bit so it won't be the exact same but its very close to the real number) kinda scared her a bit, I was like alr it could be I remember some stuff that yeah might been to early to do so but nothing too big, and abt the pages I tell her they are in notes like I said before and it's not that much in real papper, also this is a very new situation for me cuz like I never had feelings for someone before and ofc I might do mistakes and I tell her now that atelast I acknowledge my mistake could we atleast try and talk it out?, she said she corrected a spelling mistake (I planted 2 mistakes both obvious the first one she ignored it  and after the 50 min brake she corrected the second) and by how the text sounded it didn't seem like it was her way of talking I was pretty positive that it was A, it said that she dosent like when ppl insist abt smth like this and she wants to make herself understood I say okay I understand mb for insisting didn't realized it in the moment goodbye and that was all am like all annoyed cuz this wasn't even between us anymore this was a damn triangle I know she is the type of girl who would at least talk this problem out cuz I think it could be solved easily with a bit of talking also i never had a relationship so this situationis super new to me and she didnt either, but am like 90% sure her bestfriend is just destroying things between us cuz like am okay if she rejected me that wasn't the problem but I know things could've worked out if she didn't get into our situation, she just avoided me at school today and A was just all smiling like nothing happend coming to greet me and a friend like she didn't know anything it passes me off but am slowly losing feelings on purpose is that alr ?

1ka2an4,https://i.redd.it/kwb6b1439mxe1.jpeg,Starting From Scratch,"I’m living alone again after having a roommate for six years and need help designing my living room! This photo is from the show unit. Mine is completely empty. It’s only about 18 ft by 12 ft — there is more space between the door and kitchen in my unit. If it matters there is vinyl wood flooring by the door and in the kitchen, light carpet in the living room, and dark wood cabinets in the kitchen. I have two recliners, which I’d be fine to part with since they’re older, but nothing else. I’m not married to the idea of having a dining table. Maybe a coffee table that rises? It’s a small space and I want it to be cute, functional, and inviting as it’s just a small one bedroom apartment. ",2,1745863684.0,DesignMyRoom,0,1.0,False

If you’ve been struggling to lose weight despite trying countless diets, exercise routines, and even supplements, I know exactly how you feel. That was me—frustrated, exhausted, and honestly, on the verge of giving up. But then, **Matcha Slim** entered my life, and everything changed in a way I never thought possible.  
Today, I want to share my real experience with Matcha Slim because if you’re serious about transforming your body and health, this could be the breakthrough you’ve been desperately searching for.

# My Struggles Before Matcha Slim

Before discovering Matcha Slim, I was stuck in an endless cycle:

* **Strict diets** that made me miserable
* **Intense workouts** that left me sore but didn’t move the scale
* **Expensive supplements** that did absolutely nothing

I hated looking in the mirror. I felt bloated, tired, and ashamed of the body I lived in. No matter how hard I tried, the stubborn fat refused to budge. I needed something **natural**, **effective**, and **sustainable**. I didn’t want another ""magic pill"" scam—I wanted REAL results.

That’s when I stumbled upon **Matcha Slim**.

# What is Matcha Slim?

Matcha Slim is not just another weight loss tea. It’s a **powerful blend of organic matcha green tea**, fortified with **taurine**, **spirulina**, and **L-theanine**—ingredients that are scientifically proven to boost metabolism, detoxify the body, and promote natural fat burning.

Unlike other products that pump your body with harmful chemicals, Matcha Slim supports **holistic health**. It boosts your energy, sharpens your mind, and melts away fat — all while **tasting amazing**.

# Why I Chose Matcha Slim

Here’s why I decided to give Matcha Slim a try:

✅ **100% Natural Ingredients**  
✅ **Clinically Tested Formula**  
✅ **Zero Side Effects**  
✅ **Positive Reviews Worldwide**  
✅ **Sustainable, Long-term Results**

It wasn’t just another celebrity-endorsed fad. The science behind it made sense, and the real user testimonials were overwhelmingly positive. Plus, it was backed by a **100% satisfaction guarantee**—so what did I have to lose (besides the stubborn fat)?

# My Personal Results with Matcha Slim

**Week 1:**  
The first thing I noticed? **ENERGY**!  
Normally, I dragged through my mornings, but after drinking Matcha Slim, I felt **awake**, **focused**, and **full of life**. I didn’t even need coffee anymore. Plus, my cravings for junk food started to disappear naturally.

**Week 2:**  
The scale started moving — FINALLY! I lost **4 pounds** without changing anything drastic in my routine.  
I just replaced my morning coffee with a cup of Matcha Slim and stayed hydrated.

**Week 4:**  
By the end of the month, I had lost **12 pounds** effortlessly.  
My jeans were loose, my belly was flatter, and friends started commenting on how radiant and fit I looked. I wasn’t just losing weight; I was **reclaiming my confidence**.

**Today (3 months later):**  
I’m **35 pounds lighter**, and I feel like I’m living in a brand-new body.  
I have more energy than I did in my twenties, my skin is glowing, and best of all—I genuinely enjoy life again.  
And guess what? There’s been **zero rebound**. The weight stays off because Matcha Slim addresses the root causes, not just the symptoms.

# What Makes Matcha Slim So Effective?

Let’s break down the magic:

🌿 **Matcha Green Tea Extract**:  
Boosts metabolism by 40%, burns calories faster, and floods the body with antioxidants that slow aging.

🌿 **Spirulina**:  
An incredible superfood that detoxifies the body, strengthens immunity, and improves gut health.

🌿 **Taurine**:  
Accelerates fat burning and improves athletic performance, making every movement more effective.

🌿 **L-Theanine**:  
Relaxes the mind without making you sleepy, reduces stress eating, and sharpens focus.

All these ingredients work **synergistically**, meaning they amplify each other’s effects, resulting in faster and more sustainable fat loss.

# The Best Part? It’s Incredibly Easy to Use!

Unlike complex weight loss programs, using Matcha Slim is ridiculously simple:

* Mix the powder with water
* Drink it once or twice a day (I do it before breakfast and sometimes before dinner)

That's it. No complicated schedules, no meal replacement, no starvation. Just a delicious drink that feels like a treat!

# Are There Any Side Effects?

This was one of my biggest concerns before trying it. I can confidently say:  
❌ No jitters  
❌ No stomach issues  
❌ No crashes

Only **pure energy**, **better digestion**, and a **sense of well-being** I hadn’t felt in years.

# Is Matcha Slim Worth It?

Absolutely, 1000% YES.  
I used to waste **hundreds of dollars** on gym memberships, weight-loss programs, diet foods, and supplements that left me disappointed. Matcha Slim costs a **fraction of that** and delivers **real**, **visible**, **life-changing** results.

Honestly, if you value your health, your confidence, and your future, you owe it to yourself to try it. Don’t spend another month feeling frustrated and defeated. Your dream body, better health, and a more vibrant life are just one decision away.

# Final Verdict: Matcha Slim is a Game-Changer

I never thought a simple drink could make such a massive difference in my life.  
But Matcha Slim isn’t just a weight loss product—it’s **a gateway to a better version of yourself**.

* A more energetic you
* A more confident you
* A healthier, happier you

Don’t let another day slip by.  
You deserve to feel amazing in your own skin.  
You deserve a solution that **works**.  
You deserve **Matcha Slim**.

👉 **Take the leap — grab your Matcha Slim today.**

If you’ve been struggling to lose weight despite trying countless diets, exercise routines, and even supplements, I know exactly how you feel. That was me—frustrated, exhausted, and honestly, on the verge of giving up. But then, **Matcha Slim** entered my life, and everything changed in a way I never thought possible.  
Today, I want to share my real experience with Matcha Slim because if you’re serious about transforming your body and health, this could be the breakthrough you’ve been desperately searching for.

# My Struggles Before Matcha Slim

Before discovering Matcha Slim, I was stuck in an endless cycle:

* **Strict diets** that made me miserable
* **Intense workouts** that left me sore but didn’t move the scale
* **Expensive supplements** that did absolutely nothing

I hated looking in the mirror. I felt bloated, tired, and ashamed of the body I lived in. No matter how hard I tried, the stubborn fat refused to budge. I needed something **natural**, **effective**, and **sustainable**. I didn’t want another ""magic pill"" scam—I wanted REAL results.

That’s when I stumbled upon **Matcha Slim**.

# What is Matcha Slim?

Matcha Slim is not just another weight loss tea. It’s a **powerful blend of organic matcha green tea**, fortified with **taurine**, **spirulina**, and **L-theanine**—ingredients that are scientifically proven to boost metabolism, detoxify the body, and promote natural fat burning.

Unlike other products that pump your body with harmful chemicals, Matcha Slim supports **holistic health**. It boosts your energy, sharpens your mind, and melts away fat — all while **tasting amazing**.

# Why I Chose Matcha Slim

Here’s why I decided to give Matcha Slim a try:

✅ **100% Natural Ingredients**  
✅ **Clinically Tested Formula**  
✅ **Zero Side Effects**  
✅ **Positive Reviews Worldwide**  
✅ **Sustainable, Long-term Results**

It wasn’t just another celebrity-endorsed fad. The science behind it made sense, and the real user testimonials were overwhelmingly positive. Plus, it was backed by a **100% satisfaction guarantee**—so what did I have to lose (besides the stubborn fat)?

# My Personal Results with Matcha Slim

**Week 1:**  
The first thing I noticed? **ENERGY**!  
Normally, I dragged through my mornings, but after drinking Matcha Slim, I felt **awake**, **focused**, and **full of life**. I didn’t even need coffee anymore. Plus, my cravings for junk food started to disappear naturally.

**Week 2:**  
The scale started moving — FINALLY! I lost **4 pounds** without changing anything drastic in my routine.  
I just replaced my morning coffee with a cup of Matcha Slim and stayed hydrated.

**Week 4:**  
By the end of the month, I had lost **12 pounds** effortlessly.  
My jeans were loose, my belly was flatter, and friends started commenting on how radiant and fit I looked. I wasn’t just losing weight; I was **reclaiming my confidence**.

**Today (3 months later):**  
I’m **35 pounds lighter**, and I feel like I’m living in a brand-new body.  
I have more energy than I did in my twenties, my skin is glowing, and best of all—I genuinely enjoy life again.  
And guess what? There’s been **zero rebound**. The weight stays off because Matcha Slim addresses the root causes, not just the symptoms.

# What Makes Matcha Slim So Effective?

Let’s break down the magic:

🌿 **Matcha Green Tea Extract**:  
Boosts metabolism by 40%, burns calories faster, and floods the body with antioxidants that slow aging.

🌿 **Spirulina**:  
An incredible superfood that detoxifies the body, strengthens immunity, and improves gut health.

🌿 **Taurine**:  
Accelerates fat burning and improves athletic performance, making every movement more effective.

🌿 **L-Theanine**:  
Relaxes the mind without making you sleepy, reduces stress eating, and sharpens focus.

All these ingredients work **synergistically**, meaning they amplify each other’s effects, resulting in faster and more sustainable fat loss.

# The Best Part? It’s Incredibly Easy to Use!

Unlike complex weight loss programs, using Matcha Slim is ridiculously simple:

* Mix the powder with water
* Drink it once or twice a day (I do it before breakfast and sometimes before dinner)

That's it. No complicated schedules, no meal replacement, no starvation. Just a delicious drink that feels like a treat!

# Are There Any Side Effects?

This was one of my biggest concerns before trying it. I can confidently say:  
❌ No jitters  
❌ No stomach issues  
❌ No crashes

Only **pure energy**, **better digestion**, and a **sense of well-being** I hadn’t felt in years.

1ka29kb,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingadvice/comments/1ka29kb/not_sure_if_first_date_went_well_and_if_she_is/,"Not sure if first date went well, and if she is interested on a second date, and don’t want to be pushy","I want opinions on if she seems interested since it seems to me like she’s giving mixed signals, and also advice on how to text her on the following week and try not to be pushy but show that I’m interested in her and how she’s doing.

So I’ll give some context on how the date went. We are 21M and 23F and we met on bumble. We scheduled to meet 3pm, I arrive at 2:52 and she’s already there and we greet and start walking to a coffee shop she picked. On the way there she tells me that she has never been on a date before and that she’s really anxious. I tell her that I too just started dating (this is was my 7th date ever).

So we sit and order etc, and we talk and we have a lot of common interests (movies, series music etc, even politics and religion came up which I know is a no no for a first date but we agreed on everything), and at some point she pulls out her phone and she had made a long list of questions to ask to have stuff to talk about, I found that very cute and the questions were pretty fun and interesting, and in general we had really fun conversations and laughed a lot, even when there were a couple awkward pauses we just laughed.

At some point though, a friend calls her and she mutes the phone and she picked it up like 30-40 minutes later to text and told me she will be going to find some of her friends that are going to another coffee shop nearby. So after about 20 minutes we get going. 

The date was a bit over 2 hours, I’m just worried because maybe she had that as an exit strategy and she wanted to just leave, even though the vibes were good. I’m pretty inexperienced so I don’t know how to read that situation.

At the end of the date, she goes for a hug first and we say goodbye and she said it twice for some reason haha.

Then later I text her and we have the following conversation (translated from another language):

Me: I really had fun today :))

Me: Do you want to do something again this week?

(She replies 1hr later when usually she replies almost instantly)

Her: Me too, I’m just a bit sick so I don’t know when I will be able to (I did a test, it wasn’t Covid or flu)

Me: oh okay I hope you get well soon
 
Me: whenever you feel better feel free to text me to make plans if you want

Me: however if you don’t want to you can just tell me it’s alright

Her: thank you so much \^\^ I will text you when I feel a bit better 

Me: alright talk to you then

Her: alright \^~\^

-

Note: she actually did say at some point on the date that her throat was a bit sore

So I don’t know how to read the situation on if she actually wants to do a second date or if she is just making excuses because she is not interested. I just don’t want to wait a week or two to figure it out if she just ghosts me.

My friends told me to text her in a few days how she’s feeling and to recommend a date on the next weekend if she is feeling good then. However I feel like that is a bit pushy and since she hasn’t dated before it might be a bit overwhelming to ask for a date again.

Sorry for the long post, I just really clicked with her, much more than my other dates, and I love her personality and and she’s really cute, and don’t want to ruin this. I just want some advice on how to move forward and on how to read the whole situation on if she’s interested or not because it’s causing me a lot of anxiety lol.

It started with using on weekends, then occasionally during the week — just a puff here and there — but now it’s every day. Sometimes, I smoke immediately after work until I go to bed. I would have a lot of munchies — which I thought was normal.

In recent months, though, I started asking myself why I smoke so much. The first thing that came up was that it helps me fill a deep sense of emptiness. Looking back, I realize that smoking became a way to cope with feeling overwhelmed — by life, work, friendships, finances, dating, meeting new people — all of it. Instead of facing those feelings, I began isolating myself. But isolating only made me feel even lonelier, which led me to smoke more and binge eat — to the point where I am physically hurting from being so full. I would instantly regret it, feel disgusting yet I would repeat the next day… and lately, I've been feeling incompetent, lazy, unfun, not smart enough, like a useless human being… I think I’m going through a burnout so smoking has been a coping mechanism. 

A few days ago, I heard about binge eating disorder (BED) on a podcast and thought, Shit, that sounds like me. I used to believe the binge eating was just from the munchies after smoking, but now I realize it’s deeper. Some days, I don’t eat at all, just drink coffee, and because I have no energy, I don’t go out and end up eating huge amounts in one sitting… 

I don't know what to do. I feel seriously guilty calling my doctor about this. Like I'm making this up and I need to get off the weed, but... it’s not that easy. How did you realize you had a BED, and how did you tell you doctor ? Do they usually take this seriously ? It it even worth mentioning it ? ",1,1745863493.0,BingeEatingDisorder,0,1.0,False

1ka27hm,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ka27hm/uncover_if_the_bella_steam_espresso_maker_truly/,Uncover if the BELLA Steam Espresso Maker truly delivers in this detailed review,"The **BELLA 35105-043A Steam Espresso Maker** is an intriguing gadget for anyone looking to enjoy café-level drinks in the comfort of their own kitchen. As someone who enjoys experimenting with coffee brewing methods, this compact espresso machine has become a welcome addition to my routine. While the promise of consistent-quality espresso drinks is a key selling point, the product has certain quirks worth noting.

**Compact Yet Stylish Design**

The design of this steam-powered espresso maker is undeniably sleek. Its oatmilk-colored exterior fits seamlessly into modern kitchens, presenting a clean and sophisticated appearance. Measuring just 6.41"" in depth by 12.51"" in width and standing at 12"" tall, it doesn’t hog countertop space — perfect for those like me, with limited prep areas. Despite its aesthetically pleasing design, I immediately noticed the lack of rubber feet on the bottom, which means it tends to slide around slightly, especially when operating the portafilter. Placing a non-slip mat underneath resolved this, but it’s still noteworthy.

**User-Friendly Features**

One thing I appreciated was how simple this espresso maker is to operate. With a straightforward toggle switch, brewing is intuitive even for beginners. The included 2-in-1 measuring tool, which doubles as a tamper, assists in achieving the right grind for robust flavor extraction. Combined with the reusable stainless steel filter, I was able to avoid purchasing disposable filters while maintaining a sustainable daily brewing practice. Still, I wish the tamper were sturdier; its lightweight plastic construction feels less durable than I’d hope.

**Check BELLA 35105-043A price on Amazon.**

**Microfoam Wand Elevates Coffee Experience**

Ah, the steam wand — this feature stole the show for me. Crafting velvety foam for cappuccinos and lattes seemed almost effortless. I found the microfoam quality surprisingly rich compared to other espresso makers in the same category. However, the wand’s low positioning required me to creatively angle my milk pitcher, which was a little awkward. Despite this minor inconvenience, the results — creamy and stable milk foam — were well worth the effort.

**Performance and Espresso Quality**

The 3.5-bar pressure system achieved by boiling water in a die-cast aluminum boiler delivers decent espresso in a pinch. While it doesn’t match the finesse of higher-end machines with pump-driven systems, it still produces a satisfying and flavorful crema layer. I ran Lavazza medium roast coffee grounds through the system and was pleasantly surprised by the bold taste. That said, true espresso connoisseurs might find it slightly lacking in precision and depth, as it’s not a traditional pump-driven machine.

**Highlights**

- Compact and stylish design ideal for small spaces.
- Includes user-friendly accessories like a 2-in-1 tamper/measuring scoop.
- Steam wand delivers excellent microfoam for lattes and cappuccinos.
- Reusable stainless-steel filter supports eco-friendly brewing.
- Lightweight build, easy to clean with dishwasher-safe components.

**Disadvantages**

- Lightweight body can feel less sturdy, especially while locking the portafilter.
- Steam wand placement makes frothing techniques more challenging.
- Lacks rubberized feet, which may cause the unit to shift during operation.
- Plastic tamper doesn’t feel premium or durable.

**Other Options**

In comparing this device to competitors such as the Nespresso Pixie or Keurig K-Café, a few contrasts stand out. Machines like the Nespresso models prioritize convenience, sporting pod-based systems that yield consistent results with minimal input. However, they lack the hands-on customization offered by the BELLA espresso maker, which lets you choose your grind and manual frothing settings. Similarly, the Keurig K-Café integrates a milk frother but doesn’t produce espresso with the same richness or intensity as this BELLA steam espresso maker.

Additionally, premium pump-driven espresso machines such as Breville’s Bambino Plus deliver greater brewing consistency and foam texture but at a significant cost difference.

**Cost Efficiency**

Given its budget-friendly price point, this steam espresso maker offers immense value for the money. It’s not trying to compete with $500 espresso machines, nor should it. For casual coffee enthusiasts or those stepping into the espresso world, it’s a bargain if you’re willing to overlook some minor design flaws. On a tight budget, this might be your top pick for creating barista-quality drinks without the steep investment required for professional-grade models.

I’ve had so many “showers”. The adjustment to my agrophobia trashed so many relationships I held near and dear. I’ve always had anxiety, but it swelled to new heights when COVID hit. It felt unmanageable for so long, and my agrophobia also held me captive in my own life. It made me isolated from the ones I love. It made me hate myself. 

Here are my positive steps I made this month:

Going to visit my family member for 5 days. I was out of my house for an entire 5 days. I was safe in my family member’s home but I can’t remember when is the last time I did that. 

Going to the doctor’s office twice this month. Once to get a blood work form, and then today to review my results. Today I had to sit in a crowded room of **20 people for an hour and a half.** That would not have been doable before. 

I then **walked by myself to a coffee shop**. It felt freeing. One minute I was standing in front of the doctor’s office to get picked up, the next thing I knew I was walking. I felt so pent up after being in that stuffy place for 2 hours, that once I set my mind to a small treat I started walking. I walked past incredibly loud traffic. Constant traffic.

1ka25mr,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1ka25mr/explore_appliance_sliders_by_animalgifts_are_they/,Explore Appliance Sliders by Animal-Gifts Are They the Best Kitchen Gadget Review?,"The Animal-Gifts B0C287T9N7 Appliance Sliders for Kitchen is an intriguing gadget that I decided to test out after stumbling upon rave reviews online. As someone who spends far too much time rearranging counter-top appliances in search of the elusive perfect layout, I was genuinely curious if these self-adhesive kitchen sliders could make my life easier. Spoiler: they did, although not without some quirks that I’ll delve into.

**Ease of Movement and Surface Compatibility**  
One of the first things I noticed was how smoothly the appliance sliders worked. They’re designed to fit under small kitchen appliances like air fryers, blenders, and even toasters. The idea of effortlessly sliding a heavy pressure cooker across the counter sounded too good to be true, but I was amazed when it actually lived up to the description. The teflon-coated surfaces are perfect for reducing friction, whether you’re working on hardwood, tiles, or even carpet. I threw everything at these sliders—literally. My pressure cooker, coffee maker, and rice cooker were suddenly gliding like figure skaters. But beware, if you have textured countertops like mine, the sliders sometimes need a firm nudge to get going.  

**Good Points**  
- Effortless movement of heavy kitchen appliances.  
- Long-lasting adhesive that sticks to glass, metal, and plastic.  
- Applies quickly in just three steps.  

**Overall Design and Dimensions**  
Measuring extremely compact—less than an inch in diameter—you’re looking at a gadget that doesn’t add unnecessary bulk to your appliances. Its small size might make you skeptical at first, as it did for me. Can something so tiny bear the weight of a bulky mixer? The answer is surprisingly yes. Available in a neutral silver color, the sliders don’t clash with my stainless steel appliances, which is a nice touch for those who care about aesthetics as much as functionality. Still, a broader range of colors could make this even better for different kitchen setups.  

[Check Animal-Gifts B0C287T9N7 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0c287t9n7/)

**Installation Process**  
Applying these was an absolute breeze, and trust me, as someone with a low patience threshold, I appreciated this. The self-adhesive backing does most of the work. You clean the base of the appliance, peel the backing, and stick the slider to your desired spot. That’s it! But here’s some real talk—make sure the appliance’s feet are perfectly clean. I skipped this step with one device, and the slider started peeling off the next day. Prep properly, and you’ll be fine.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Struggles with textured countertops for seamless sliding.  
- Limited color options—why only silver?  
- Requires meticulous surface cleaning before application.  

**Wide Range of Applications**  
If versatility had a name, these sliders could easily claim it. I was skeptical when I saw how these are marketed as ""suitable for just about anything,"" but they truly proved their mettle. From helping me reposition a monstrous Instant Pot to shuffling around a humble toaster, there wasn’t a single appliance left out. I even used these sliders to test moving a vase across my living room—because why not? They lasted without showing signs of wear, but I’d be curious to see how well they hold up over months of daily use.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing these sliders to other brands like Rubbermaid or Gorilla Grips showed me where this product excels—and falls short. While Rubbermaid offers sliders with more intricate shapes for specific appliance bases, they don’t always have the same friction-reducing smoothness. Gorilla’s offerings are bulkier, so they’re better for furniture but less practical for small appliances. What sets the Animal-Gifts sliders apart is their adaptability across multiple appliance categories. However, the competitors often come with reusable stickiness, which these currently lack.

**Affordable Quality**  
Affordability is where these sliders really shine. The set includes 24 individual pieces, making them an economical alternative to expensive sliding trays or pads. It’s nice knowing you can outfit multiple appliances instead of buying individual products for each one. Plus, you’re saving your countertops from scratches, which makes them a double win. I wouldn’t call this the gadget I never knew I needed, but I definitely don’t regret investing in it—it’s practical, simple, and worth the minimal price tag.

# 👩‍🎨 Real Experience with The Smoothie Diet™ (via Lauren, a Friend from My Yoga Class)

Lauren’s one of those people you always see with a mason jar in hand—usually green, occasionally purple, always blended.

We met in a local yoga class a while back, and she’s been my go-to for smoothie inspo ever since. So when she told me she’d just wrapped up [The Smoothie Diet](https://theworldhealth.org/smoothie-diet-official)**™**, I had to get the scoop.

She’s a freelance illustrator and works from home, which means she’s just a few steps from the fridge at all times—*temptation central*.

For her, snacking had become more about boredom than hunger, and she felt it was catching up fast. “I wasn’t trying to become a supermodel,” she told me, “I just wanted to zip up my jeans again without threatening the zipper’s life.”

Lauren stuck with the full 21 days, swapping breakfast and lunch for smoothies while keeping dinner relaxed but clean.

She loved the **fruit smoothies that burn fat**—especially the ones with pineapple and mint—and said the **shopping lists and prep guide** helped her avoid that “what am I doing?” fridge stare at 7 a.m.

By the end of week two, she noticed her energy picking up—she wasn’t dragging through afternoon Zoom calls, and her skin looked noticeably brighter.

She did say a few of the smoothies were too sweet for her taste, especially the banana-heavy ones. “I just threw in a little spinach or cucumber to calm them down,” she said. “Easy fix.”

Lauren ended up losing 7 pounds without counting a single calorie.

More importantly, she said it helped reset her habits. “I still do a smoothie every morning now. It’s just easier—and I don’t get that 10 a.m. sugar crash anymore.”

I sit with a pencil, a blank open page,
A battlefield silent, a bird in a cage.
The words tap their fingers, they yawn and they sigh,
While I mutter, “Come on! Just give it a try!”

First comes a title — too clunky, too neat,
Then maybe a rhyme that trips over my feet.
I reach for a metaphor, trip on a pun,
Erase half the stanza — and barely begun.

The clock on the wall taps a beat of its own,
My coffee cup cools, my patience has flown.
I scribble and doodle and wrestle and fight,
‘Cause sometimes the words don’t know how to write.

But somewhere inside of this chaos and din,
A melody hums and it pulls me back in.
A whisper of magic, a flicker of light,
A crooked little line that somehow feels right.

It stumbles and stretches and dances and hums,
It leaps through the verses, it twirls and it drums!
And just when I think that I’ve got it all tamed—
The poem just laughs… and forgets why it came.

Still, here it now sits: a mess and a song,
Perfectly clumsy, exactly as long
As it needed to be — not grand, but it’s true:
A poem about poems… and writing one too.

I’m hoping to connect with someone who enjoys real conversation, the kind that isn’t just about passing time, but about actually seeing the person on the other end. I like a mix of deep thoughts and light moments. Sometimes the best conversations flow between the two.

I’m 27, based in England, but I’m open to connecting with people from anywhere. I work from home, which means I get to enjoy my morning coffee whenever I want, and occasionally find myself chatting with my puppies like they are my colleagues. I’m good at cooking, especially when I get into a new recipe, and baking is something I find really satisfying. I also enjoy being outside, running, hiking, or just going for a walk to reset my head. I have come to really value the calm parts of the day, the ones most people rush through. I’m flexible with timing, so whether you are an early riser or a night owl, we should be able to make it work no matter your time zone.

Genuineness is something I really appreciate in others. I try to live in a way that’s intentional without being overly serious. I care about being consistent, honest, and kind. I enjoy talking to people who appreciate the little moments in life and who are genuinely interested in getting to know one another. If you are someone who enjoys conversation that does not feel rushed, and you appreciate the little moments in life, I’d enjoy hearing from you.

1ka23mz,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1ka23mz/should_you_consider_the_babyzen_yoyo2_stroller/,Should You Consider the Babyzen YOYO2 Stroller Review for Lightweight Travel Needs?,"From the moment I laid my hands on the Babyzen YOYO2 Stroller - Black Frame with Aqua Seat & Canopy (model number YOYOu00b2), I could see why it had earned such a positive reputation. Having tested many strollers over the years, I found myself genuinely excited to see how this one would perform in real-world scenarios. Compact, stylish, and seemingly durable, this stroller immediately stood out. But like every product, there’s always more than meets the eye.

**Design and Aesthetics**

Straight out of the box, the sleek and modern design was the first thing to capture my attention. The black frame paired with the aqua seat and canopy offers a chic look that easily fits into any urban environment. It’s one of those strollers that turns heads on the sidewalk. Beyond looks, the build features faux leather accents, which feel premium and are easy to clean – not that this stopped my toddler from finding ways to add their unique ""artistic touch"" (snack crumbs included). The aluminum alloy and stainless-steel frame feel robust, and at just 14 pounds, the lightweight construction impressed me, especially after lugging around heavier strollers in the past.

**Ease of Use and Portability**

One thing every parent understands is the value of a stroller that folds seamlessly, particularly when dealing with an energetic toddler. This stroller earns massive points in my book for how quickly it collapses into its compact folded size (20.5” x 17.3” x 7.1”). Whether navigating a packed coffee shop or squeezing it into the narrow trunk of my sedan, its portability was unbeatable. The padded shoulder strap made carrying it convenient, which came in handy during a family trip to the zoo. If juggling a diaper bag, snacks, and a toddler sounds like a circus, a user-friendly fold-and-carry system like this one feels nothing short of magical.  

[Check Babyzen YOYO2 Stroller price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b0857159b3/)

**Comfort and Features**

Naturally, the comfort of my little one was a major priority. The soft faux leather material used for the seat adds a touch of luxury, while the 5-point harness system provided both safety and adjustability. I appreciated how snug yet comfortable the straps felt against my child’s body. My toddler seemed relaxed during stroller rides, nodding off under the toffee-colored canopy on multiple occasions. Speaking of the canopy, while it’s perfectly functional, I do wish it extended a bit further to offer better sun protection. The all-wheel suspension made bumpy sidewalks bearable, even when pushing it with one hand as I hastily texted my spouse about dinner plans.

**Strengths**

- Lightweight yet durable aluminum alloy and stainless-steel build.  
- Seamless folding mechanism with a practical carrying strap.  
- Luxurious faux leather seat material with an easy-to-clean surface.  
- Smooth all-wheel suspension for a better riding experience.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- Limited sunshade coverage from the canopy could be improved.  
- Tire material being plastic may not hold up as well on rougher terrains.  

**Target Audience**

During testing, I couldn’t help but think of how perfect this stroller is for urban families who prioritize portability and style. It’s an excellent pick if you often navigate public transport or live in a compact space. However, if you’re someone who enjoys adventurous off-road strolling or needs a stroller with ample storage, this might come up a little short for your needs.

**Competitive Options**

Compared to other lightweight strollers in its category, like the UPPAbaby MINU and Bugaboo Bee, the Babyzen YOYO2 holds its ground when it comes to portability and design. While the MINU offers a bit more storage space, its bulkier frame makes it less travel-friendly. On the other hand, the Bugaboo Bee feels comparable in luxury but doesn’t match the YOYO2 in terms of foldability and weight. For frequent travelers or parents seeking chic functionality, the Babyzen YOYO2 often feels like the most versatile option, even if alternatives have slight advantages in specific areas like terrain suitability.

**Best Value**

Considering its robust features like the all-wheel suspension and premium construction, the price-to-quality ratio feels justified. You get a stroller that’s reliable, aesthetically pleasing, and incredibly travel-friendly, but it doesn't stray into overpriced territory. As someone who has spent a fortune on baby gear over the years, the Babyzen YOYO2 strikes the right balance between affordability and luxury.

Looking for someone who’s tired of swiping and wants something deeper. I’m a laid-back, 5’8” guy with a warm sense of humor and a love for balancing cozy nights with spontaneous adventures. After work, I unwind with gaming (RPGs, indie titles, or anything with a good story) or exploring underrated spots—like Astra Lumina, that trippy forest art exhibit I checked out last month. Concerts, museums, and low-key hangs are my vibe, but I’m equally down for marathoning shows or debating the best way to eat a taco at 2AM.

I value loyalty, honesty, and emotional openness. Life’s messy, and I’m not here to judge—just to build a partnership where we can laugh at inside jokes, hug it out when things get tough, and push each other to grow. You’re introverted but have a big heart, maybe a little nerdy about something (tell me your obscure passion), and prioritize health without taking life too seriously.

If you can make some pho, you have my attention.

Not on apps because they feel impersonal. If you’re a homebody who occasionally craves live music or deep talks under the stars, let’s chat. No rush—just two weirdos seeing if our chaos aligns.

About me: Peanut butter-skinned, 160lbs, affectionate, and the designated Wi-Fi fixer in every friend group. I’ll make you laugh, remember your coffee order, and stick around when things get real.

1ka20z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon_Training/comments/1ka20z7/first_marathon_race_report/,First Marathon Race Report,"I ran my first marathon yesterday in Eugene, Oregon and used reddit alot for tips and training advice so I figured I should share and maybe get some pointers. The race itself was great, well organized, and super fun! Ending the race on the infamous Hayward Field track is epic.

I am a 50 year old female who has been running casually but consistently for 14 years, averaging 15-20 miles per week when not training for a race. Did a couple 2 hour halfs about 10 years ago and then my running partner moved away so didn't feel motivated to sign up for races on my own. Fast forward to last fall, I signed up for a half which I ran in december in 2:01:33 at a 9:16 min/mile pace.

At this point distance was feeling really good. After that half I was loving 10 mile runs and 13 miles didn't seem enough of a challenge, so I signed up for my first full. I followed Hal Higdon's novice 2 all the way through.  However, I couldn't really fit in the cross training days because I work 2 to 3, 12 hour shifts on my feet every week, and can't work out on those days, and need to also prioritize my family. I ran consistently 4 days a week and sometimes could fit in a 5th. I added a little mileage in to my easy days because I really wanted to get to 40 miles per week at the peak. I resisted zone 2 running because it felt uncomfortably slow and my easy pace felt very easy and talkable (could my garmin HR be wrong?). Most of my long runs were in zone 3 for the majority of the time per my watch. I did my long runs at a 10:30 pace and my speed runs (up to 8 miles) at a 9:00-9:10 pace. My 20 miler felt hard but great, and my last two miles home are always the flattest and was able to speed up to a 9:30 finish my last 1.5 miles. I decided my goal pace for the marathon would be 10:00 min miles for a 4:22 total time.

Week of race: I had the taper flu, the taper tantrums, poor sleep, terrible spring allergies, you name it. I was a mess. My 3 mile runs marathon week felt hard for some reason and I thought I was doomed. I carb loaded 8g/kg for 2 days prior, and hydrated well.

Race day: I woke up at 4:30 and ate a bagel with peanut butter, banana and honey and one 12 ounce cup of coffee (all which I had practiced). I sipped on 500ml of water, and finished this in about an hour. I was off to the shuttle at 4:45. I sat next to a guy who had run Boston on monday and was running the marathon today (what?!?). I thought of him the whole time. I used a running belt to carry my 8 gels and gummies (I like to mix it up) and I decided to carry a throw away 480 ml water bottle with Scratch electrolytes and carbs in it in my hand so I wouldn't have to stop for a while. One of my two headphones didn't work for some reason when I got to the starting line so that was my only bummer of the morning.  I also didn't do a full warm up, I went to the bathroom twice and got my things organized and time went quick.

The race: I felt absolutely fantastic for the first 13 miles! I really wanted to hit my target 4:22 and so I was running more at a 9:50-9:55 pace to account for bathroom stops, etc... Because I had my handheld water/electrolytes for the first 7 miles and all my fuel in my belt, I didn't stop at all until at least mile 8 for hydration which was different than during training. I bought a new belt for the marathon that allowed easy access to everything without stopping AND I had pockets on my shorts. During training I always had to stop to get things out. I fueled every 3 miles with either a Maurten, a Gu, or Clif blocks. After I finished my handheld I took one water and one gatorade at every stop. Around my 13, I felt a twinge of something in my right quad, just sort of an injurious uncomfortable feeling but not over the top bad that stuck with my for the rest of the race. For some reason during races this is always the spot that gets me, but never during training and then it extends to the right side of my knee (IT band?). Mile 13 was always hard for me mentally as well during my last two long training runs, as things are starting to get hard yet you are only at half the distance you know you need to go. I still was able to keep pace overall and feel pretty good to mile 20. I had a pee stop at mile 10 and mile 15ish, and was starting to think I was overhydrating. Mile 20-26 was hard, and I was cursing everything. I don't think I ""hit a wall"", but my quads were just sooooo tired and felt like they were freezing up. The rest of me felt fine. I had thought I would feel great for this portion as I did at the end of all my long training runs, but that definitely did not happen. I had to pee twice (again that is 4 times on the course, was I over hydrated?) although also using this a a great excuse to stop for a minute. I also stopped at all the hydration stops for gatorade and a quick stretch in the last 6 miles. This slowed my pace down considerably to an 11:00 minute mile. With the bathroom stops early on, my final time was 4:36:44, 10:34/mile. This was slower than my training long runs, where did I go wrong? Is it normal to feel like your quads are just done at the end of a marathon? I definitely think strength training might have helped. Any suggestions? Because of course during those last 6 miles I said I would never do this again, but of course I will:)",2,1745863064.0,Marathon_Training,3,1.0,False
1ka20sp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenXWomen/comments/1ka20sp/coffees_drinks_lunches_etc/,"Coffees, Drinks, Lunches, etc.","I have spent most of my life as an extrovert. I truly do enjoy seeing people and getting out of my house. If I am home alone too much I start to get antsy. 

But lately I feel like I'm being pulled in all sorts of directions. My parents want me to come over and help with something at their house (even though a sibling lives there and could help. Former interns want to meet for coffee and career guidance. A friend invited me to an event for her dog. A person in my volunteer group keeps trying to meet for lunch. Another woman who is a friend of a friend wants career advice over coffee. Another salesperson keeps trying to pin me down for something and take me out to lunch. Then kid events - a band concert at school one night, a parent conference the next week. 

I am a mom of two and I have them 1/2 of every week. I am in a relationship as well. Once you take out the nights with my kids and the time I set aside for my relationship, I have maybe 2 nights a week that are mine all mine. I don't mind doing something every so often (drinks or dinner) but it lately feels like every week has a demand on my time. 

Last week I had only one night that could have been mine and was supposed to meet a former colleague from two jobs ago for drinks after her repeated invites and I ended up having to cancel because I was so exhausted and I could tell she was peeved. This week I had one night to relax and the party for my friend's dog is that night and I really don't want to go but then worry that I'm an asshole if I skip it. 

Do others feel the same way? How do you navigate this? For work/networking requests I'm thinking of saying ""I'd love to chat but it's very hard for me to get away from my desk most days so if we could do a Teams chat or a phone call that would be great"" - the social ones are harder. Sometimes I do want to see someone but it's like ""Hey, I would love to see you but I need it to be a week when nothing else is going on because otherwise I'll feel stressed and tired."" but would someone think that is rude?

1ka2060,https://i.redd.it/aqgpyw127mxe1.jpeg,"No Fixed Address, nomad, UK citizen, living out of three bags for 1-2 years","I'm new to this subreddit and just wanted to share my experiences with people to see if anyone can relate to my life situation.

I've seen a lot of posts on similar forums about the minimalist/digital nomad lifestyle but I find them hard to relate to because they're... well... quite bourgeois.

I'm a blue collar worker, I don't own a home, I don't have a cushy work-from-anywhere laptop job, I don't have significant passive income from owning assets, and I don't have a rich family funding my lifestyle.

**Background**

I'm a single man, 35 years old, and life has been pretty rough the last couple of years. I've been in trouble with the law and cut off from my family support network. I've struggled on-and-off with my mental health for most of my life, although I'm in a happier and more stable place mentally right now than I have ever been. I got a good education when I was younger but I crashed out of my career and took up work as a dishwasher out of desperation in my mid-late 20s, then worked my way up as a cook/chef.

I moved to New Zealand, then Australia, for a little while and got a taste of the travelling lifestyle, but I always had a home base with my family in the UK to store my belongings, at least until \*the incident\*. Long story short, I had an fight with my dad when during a visit to the family home, he started it but I beat him up pretty badly. Maybe it was the fight-flight response, maybe it was years of built-up rage from all the physical and emotional abuse. I got carted off in a police van, spent 2 nights in a cell, charged with assault & sentenced - community service, probation, and a fine.

I still have a good relationship with my mum, but he controls the family home and finances, we don't talk any more and there is no chance of reconciliation. This was 2 years ago. Being a criminal with an unspent record makes it harder to find work and housing but I managed to get a job with on-site accommodation, kept my head down, saved as much money as I could & did some evening classes in mental health counselling.

I have friends scattered around the UK and the world, many own their own homes, have solid stable careers and have started families. Whereas I, by most metrics, have thoroughly failed at life.

I had plans to move to Australia in July and intended to carry on my job in the UK until at least May or June, but lost my job sooner than planned, along with my workplace accommodation. I left the job on good terms, they just didn't need me any more, I still use it as my mailing address for banking etc. but nearly everything is paperless now.

Flights were already booked before this happened and I had commitments in the UK until June so I decided to sell/donate most of my belongings, condense my entire life into as few belongings as possible, and fully embrace the nomad lifestyle.

**Finances**

Thanks to the money I've saved from work and cheap accommodation, paid medical trials, and some lucky stock market & crypto gambles, I have enough money saved up to survive for at least 2 years if I live cheaply. About 3/4 of it is stashed away in an ISA and invested in low-risk assets.

I also have about £2000 coming in from accrued annual leave/PTO and medical trial payments over the next 2-3 months.

As a chef, my skill set doesn't lend itself well to earning money remotely online, but it's generally very easy to find work wherever I go as long as I have a valid work visa for that country. I've done online ghost-writing in the past, it didn't pay much back then (less than the UK minimum wage when I crunched the numbers) and I imagine most of that kind of work has dried up now thanks to ChatGPT.

**Belongings**

I have one box of belongings stored at a friend's house. Mostly tools, cooking equipment and items of sentimental value.

I have three bags to carry my belongings around with me wherever I go - my luggage/packing strategy is probably less than optimal, I've chosen it because it's what fits within typical long-haul airline luggage limits (without paying large excess fees). All my luggage was bought from a Charity/Thrift/Op shop, or from a closing-down sale. I'm sure I could 'nomad' more efficiently with luggage and gear that's purpose-built for this lifestyle, but I'm just using what I've picked up along the way.

\- Large SwissGear holdall (< 20kg)  
\- \~30L sturdy cotton backpack capacity (<10kg)  
\- Small laptop bag with shoulder strap

Clothing: 1 week's worth of t-shirts, underpants and socks. 2 smart cotton button-up shirts. 2 pairs of shorts, 1 pair of cargo pants, 1 pair of jeans, 1 pair of smart cotton trousers. 1 pair of thermal long johns. 1 cotton fleece jumper. 1 soft shell jacket.

Basic toiletries & medicines: toothbrush, toothpaste, mouthwash, hair brush, matte paste, shower gel, shampoo, roll-on deodorant, electric trimmer. >1 year's supply of asthma inhalers, allergy meds & melatonin. Analgesics & supplements.

Electronics: Razer Blade 15 laptop (2nd hand), cooling pad, Google Pixel 8 phone (2nd hand, refurbished) with a £5 per month PAYG data plan with Asda Mobile. Soundcore noise-cancelling headphones. Small bag of cables, chargers and travel adapters. Small USB travel fan.

4 books. 1 towel. Sleep mask. Travel pillow. Bialetti Moka Pot for coffee. Small plastic bowl. Metal teaspoon. Sealable plastic container. 1 cotton shopping bag from Lidl for dirty laundry. Small mesh bags and containers to organise small items. Box file with important documents and paperwork. RFID-blocking passport wallet.

There's usually just enough space in my luggage to bring a few extra items with me wherever I go.

**Food**

Access to cooking facilities can't always be guaranteed. My typical travelling diet consists of a bowl of salad leaves with cold wholegrains/legumes (rice, lentils), & hummus. Sometimes I add a couple of boiled eggs. That'll be one meal. Another meal will be Greek yogurt with granola, nuts, seeds. Lots of fresh fruit. I'm mostly vegetarian but will sometimes canned sardines or mackerel. I often treat myself to a restaurant meal and will keep an eye out for affordable places to eat out. Working in kitchens I gained a bit of weight so I'm trying to lose the dad bod now by 2:1 fasting, eating healthily, cutting out sugar, LOTS of walking, usually 3 hours a day.

**Itinerary & Accommodation**

I just spent 2 weeks in the UK spending quality time with friends and seeing my sick grandma. Did some couch surfing, stayed in cheap airbnbs between £20-40 per night, one night in a Travelodge near the airport.

Currently I'm in Budapest, Hungary staying in a short-term stay in a shared apartment in a suburb on the Buda side of town, and after that I'll be spending the next 2 months slowly working my way from Budapest to Istanbul, via Romania and Bulgaria, sleeping in hostels, Airbnbs and hotels along the way for between £15-30 per night. My money goes a lot further in Eastern Europe. I have a lot of my accommodation booked and in some places it's possible to get a whole apartment for less than £150 per week. All flights and a lot of my accommodation are already booked.

After that, I'm flying back to London for some commitments I have there, and in July, I'm flying to Perth Australia, where I have a work visa and plan to work for at least one year and save as much as I can.

Between now, and starting work in Australia, my budget for accommodation and living costs is about £4000, although I have a very healthy emergency fund if I need to use it.

I will eventually need to get back to work - hopefully I'll be able to find something with one-site accommodation when I get to Australia.

  
The thing that gets me now is the loneliness. I haven't experienced loneliness in a very long time because I've always worked around a lot of other people and actually got exhausted by all the human interaction, so that on my off days I would just isolate myself in my room and try to recover my energy.

Since I left work, packed my bags and started travelling, the loneliness is finally starting to bother me. I'm having all these great and interesting experiences but I just have nobody to share them with, at least nobody who seems to care.

Practical Steps for Fixing My Broken Marriage
---------------------------------------------

<div>When you find yourself thinking ""fixing my broken marriage,"" it means you're ready to take action toward healing and rebuilding. Marriages face challenges, and it’s normal to encounter rough patches. The key is not to give up but to look carefully at what can change and grow. Putting practical steps into motion can make a significant difference in restoring a relationship that once felt strong and loving.

### Understanding What Went Wrong

It’s important to identify the root causes of the breakup or the difficulties in your marriage. Sometimes, the problems are clear, such as lack of communication or trust issues. Other times, the damage is gradual and harder to pinpoint. Take time to reflect on your relationship history together. Ask yourself and your partner, “What made us grow apart?” or “What moments caused pain or distance between us?” This honest self-assessment lays the foundation for meaningful change.

### Commit to Open, Honest Communication

Open communication acts as the lifeline of any relationship. If communication has broken down, begin by creating safe spaces to talk. Set aside distractions and time limits to ensure conversations are productive. Try to speak calmly and listen actively without making immediate judgments or jumping to defend yourself. Use “I” statements like, “I feel hurt when…” to express feelings clearly without assigning blame, which helps reduce defensiveness.

### Rebuild Trust Step by Step

Trust often erodes in a broken marriage and needs care to restore. Transparency is key here. Share your daily schedules, plans, or thoughts with your partner to show reliability. Avoid secret behaviors that might raise suspicion. Apologize sincerely when you mess up, and be patient with your partner’s timeline for healing. Trust rebuilds slowly, but consistent, honest actions create a stable path forward.

### Focus on Small Acts of Kindness

Rekindling love may sound like a big grand gesture, but small, thoughtful acts have powerful effects. Simple routines like making a cup of coffee, leaving a kind note, or doing a household chore without being asked communicate care and respect. These little moments build a bridge between you and your spouse. When you focus on kindness daily, it reduces tension and creates positive interactions.

### Seek Professional Help When Needed

Sometimes, issues in a marriage are tough to handle alone. There’s no shame in seeking guidance from a couple’s counselor or therapist. A trained professional can help identify unhealthy patterns, teach communication tools, and provide a neutral space for both partners to express themselves safely. If you’re unsure where to start, many online directories list licensed counselors specialized in marriage therapy.

### Set Realistic Goals Together

Healing a marriage is a process that requires patience and clear intentions. Sit down with your partner and set small, achievable goals. These can include weekly date nights, daily check-ins about feelings, or working on specific habit changes. Tracking progress together not only motivates but also helps celebrate your wins, no matter how small. When goals are shared, it strengthens your sense of teamwork.

### Learn to Forgive and Let Go of Resentments

Holding on to past hurts keeps wounds fresh and blocks healing. Forgiveness doesn’t mean forgetting or excusing mistakes; rather, it means freeing yourself from bitterness. Talk through old grievances with your partner when the time feels right. Recognize the human flaws in both of you. Releasing grudges opens the door for renewed trust and emotional intimacy.

### Prioritize Emotional and Physical Intimacy

Emotional closeness fuels physical intimacy. Work on reconnecting by spending quality time together, sharing dreams, fears, and joys honestly. Try not to rush physical intimacy if you or your spouse are not ready; instead, build gentle moments of affection such as holding hands or hugging to reestablish comfort and connection. Emotional safety creates a stronger foundation for a healthy physical relationship.

### Manage External Stressors

Daily stressors like work pressure, financial difficulties, or family conflicts can wear down a marriage. Identify what external pressures affect your relationship and develop coping strategies as a team. This might be budgeting sessions, clearer work-life boundaries, or even mindfulness exercises together. When external stress is managed well, it reduces unnecessary conflict and allows you to focus energy on healing your marriage.

### Stay Committed Even When Progress Feels Slow

Fixing a broken marriage doesn’t happen overnight. There will be good days and setbacks. What matters most is persistence and genuine willingness to grow together. Keep reminding yourself why you want to fix your marriage and visualize a hopeful future with your spouse. Your commitment can inspire your partner to join you in working toward a stronger, loving relationship.

By taking thoughtful and consistent steps, you can move from feeling stuck in a broken marriage to rekindling connection and trust. Each effort contributes to building a healthier, happier partnership where both of you feel valued and supported. Remember, healing begins with the choice to try and the courage to rebuild, one moment at a time.

</div>Emotional Healing and Rebuilding Trust in Troubled Relationships
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding Emotional Healing

When you find yourself trying to fix a broken marriage, one of the most important steps is emotional healing. Emotions often run deep in relationships that have faced difficulties, especially when trust has been broken. Healing emotionally means addressing the pain, anger, and hurt rather than pushing it aside. This allows you to move forward with a clearer heart and mind.

You need to recognize that healing is a process, not an event. It begins with acknowledging your feelings honestly and being patient with yourself. Whether the issues stem from betrayal, miscommunication, or accumulated resentment, giving yourself time to understand these emotions lays the groundwork for rebuilding.

### Steps to Start Emotional Healing

- **Acceptance:** Accept how you feel without judgment. Your emotions are valid, and accepting them is the first key to healing.
- **Open Communication:** Speak transparently with your partner about your feelings. Honest conversations pave the way for mutual understanding.
- **Seek Support:** Consider counseling or support groups tailored for couples. Sometimes, outside help provides new perspectives and tools for healing.
- **Set Boundaries:** Establish healthy boundaries to protect your emotional well-being while you work through pain.
- **Practice Self-Care:** Engage in activities that nurture your mental and physical health, such as exercise, meditation, or hobbies.

### How to Rebuild Trust After It’s Been Broken

Trust is the cornerstone of any strong relationship, and when it’s damaged, fixing it can feel overwhelming. However, by committing to intentional actions and patience, trust can be restored. It starts with both partners understanding the importance of transparency and accountability.

[Check How You Can Save Your Marriage in 4 Weeks (Tested &amp; Proven)](https://importantlink.com/saveyourmarriage)  
  
Here are effective ways to rebuild trust with your spouse:

- **Be Consistent:** Keep your promises and be reliable in your actions. Small consistent behaviors show that you are dependable.
- **Apologize Sincerely:** If you’ve caused hurt, a heartfelt apology can be the first step toward reconciliation. It shows humility and respect for your partner’s feelings.
- **Show Patience:** Understand that rebuilding trust takes time. Your partner may need reassurance, and rushing the process can cause setbacks.
- **Transparency in Actions:** Share your schedules, feelings, and plans openly to help your partner feel included and secure.
- **Forgive and Let Go:** Forgiveness is a mutual process. Holding on to past grievances prevents both of you from advancing emotionally.

### Creating a Stronger Connection

As emotional wounds mend and trust is slowly restored, it's essential to focus on strengthening your connection to prevent future breakdowns. Being intentional about how you relate to each other nurtures intimacy and understanding.

Try integrating meaningful practices into your daily routine that build positive interactions:

- **Regular Check-ins:** Spend a few minutes each day asking about each other’s feelings and thoughts. This habit keeps communication open.
- **Express Gratitude:** Acknowledge your partner’s efforts and qualities. Feeling appreciated can motivate both partners to maintain a healthy relationship.
- **Shared Activities:** Engage in hobbies or projects together. Shared positive experiences reinforce your bond.
- **Physical Affection:** Simple gestures like holding hands or hugging release oxytocin, which supports emotional closeness.

### When Professional Help Makes a Difference

If the emotional damage or trust issues feel too deep to handle alone, seeking professional guidance can be a game changer. Therapists trained in relationship counseling can help navigate complicated feelings and teach healthy communication skills.

Marriage counseling offers a neutral space where both you and your partner can express yourselves freely without judgment. A counselor can:

- Identify destructive patterns and help replace them with positive ones.
- Encourage empathy and active listening.
- Guide you through forgiveness and rebuilding exercises.

Sometimes, the support of an expert makes all the difference in turning a troubled marriage into a relationship filled with trust, respect, and love.

### Keeping Commitment Alive

At the heart of fixing a broken marriage is commitment. Both partners must be willing to put in the work, stay patient with the process, and keep their focus on healing and growth. Remember, emotional healing and trust-building do not happen overnight. Trust is fragile but can become stronger than ever when carefully nurtured.

If you are motivated to repair your relationship, take consistent action. Embrace honesty, listen with empathy, and allow space for change. Over time, your efforts can bring back stability and a renewed sense of togetherness.

### Conclusion

Fixing your broken marriage is a journey that takes time, patience, and commitment. By taking practical steps such as improving communication, setting aside quality time together, and seeking professional help when needed, you can begin to rebuild the foundation of your relationship. These actions not only address the surface issues but also create space for growth and understanding.

Emotional healing plays a vital role in restoring trust, which often feels fragile in troubled marriages. Allowing yourself and your partner the grace to express feelings openly can break down walls and foster genuine connection. Rebuilding trust means showing consistent honesty, keeping promises, and being vulnerable without fear of judgment. This emotional work is just as important as practical changes and often leads to deeper intimacy.

Ultimately, fixing your broken marriage is about both hearts and actions coming together. When you invest in both emotional healing and tangible improvements, you create a path forward that honors your commitment and hope for a stronger future.

1ka1u40,https://www.reddit.com/r/heartbreak/comments/1ka1u40/in_pain_hurting_myself_unnecessarily/,"In pain, hurting myself unnecessarily","Beginning of this month, my (35M) relationship with my now ex (30F) had ended. It all happened so incredibly fast. The reason was either we had two clashing wounds meddling with each other, or she was genuinely seeking romantic affairs though snapchat.

I've been struggling with depressions and anxieties throughout most of my life. I've had episodes where I was absorbed in thoughts where I was occupied with negative aspects and how to resolve them. In this, she supported me and tried to help me find enjoyment in things. I've appreciated this, despite not being able to show it well through pure love and romance. I have always put myself out there to help her in her needs, life issues and making sure our housing situation was well taken care of in her crowded life of work, her non profit organisation, and logistical problems. I've always been present for her and I did that with love.

We've always had check-in moments where we talked about our needs, if what we are doing for each other is still good, if we feel loved, and if we still go towards the future we had envisioned. I worked with the information at hand and the communication we had done. I had always thought what I did for her to be good.

Since March, some changes appeared jn her behaviour where she started doubting her life since she was turning 30. This only revealed when we were some weeks into the month, where I tried to find out what's happening with her whilst becoming more and more afraid of our relationship becoming worse. At some point, her time spent with friends increased exponentially and there was hardly any time left to spend together. I started pulling, and it seemed that she only started to distance herself.

During all of this, she was secretive with her phone. Not very subtle either. When having dinner and I would look at her, I would see her typing and quickly flipping down her phone. I usually get coffee for her in the evenings. When I walk from the Kitchen into the livingroom, I would see the couch where she would be sitting. She on multiple occasions was typing in what looked like snapchat. And when I walk into the livingroom, she clicked away the chat window and started randomly swiping through her phone menu screens.

I confronted her about it. She distanced herself more, and pushed back on me telling I am controlling her and that it wouldn't matter if I would know who and what she is texting, I wouldn't understand it anyway. I let it be and I tried working on myself to get into a positive window.

Fast forward into early April, where we did a little concert in the evening. When back home, she went to shower and we would go to bed as she had early work the next day. Just after she stepped into the shower, a few snapchat messages popped through, which I heard from the livingroom. I was shocked. Did she sent a nude through snapchat? The entire evening she seemed pretty open with her phone, she sent photo's to family and friends through whatsapp and there seemed to be no snapchat going on.

I tried to shrug it off thinking perhaps she wanted to send it over snapchat too. After she was done showering, I got undressed and walked to the bathroom to dump my clothes in the laundry bin. On the faucet next to the bin, her phone laid open, with a chat. She startled and snatched her phone quickly to close her screen. I was lost. We tried sleeping, but after two hours of pain and suffering, I turned on the lights, waking her up and confronted her if there was an affair going on.

She started shouting and crying saying ""Oh no, you are not about to do this. Not now. You turn off the lights or I am stepping out the door."" More mumbling happened which I responded to with ""I think we should take some space by taking a break"". She got up, packed some things and left for her parent's place.

In this month, I did a lot of talking with friends, my therapist, and her parents which I wanted to thank for their hospitality and openness in our relationship. I have been blaming myself so much for this breakup. If I was half the man I was when we got together, she wouldn't find the necessity to find someone else (assumed there was an affair). I shouldn't have been such a depressed loser and just lived life in full and she would still be with me. I shouldn't have been so insecure about her changes and less time together, she may have felt at ease doing more in her life.

I had a wound where in a previous relationship where I took some space to do my own things more, that my then gf got sad that I took more distance. I still believe this lingers with me to believe distancing so much is a recipy for a broken relationship. She had been in a relationship in her early 20s where she was controlled and wasn't allowed to do things with her friends. This is what she said she wanted to relive time as she got to 30 years. Quarterlife crisis, she refered to.

I wonder deeply if our wounds were aching and conflicted with each other. I wonder if my depressions spurts of lack in romance pushed her to finding someone else. I feel like everything that happened, was because of me. Because I couldn't be the stable factor as a man in the relationship. Despite doing everything for the relatioship which we talked about we needing.

Also looking to start my masters this summer. All in all, I'm excited to see what the future holds.

I'm fit and work out daily. I especially like to do distance running and I'm getting stir crazy waiting for it to warm up so I can jog outside in the sun! I love camping and traveling as well. Unfortunately there's only a few good weeks of weather for the outdoors where I'm at, but I'm determined to make the most of it this year! Watching movies, reading, going to museums, appreciating art and music are some of my favorite hobbies/interests. I mostly listen to punk but I'll listen to anything from classical to rap. I also like to try new wines when I watch movies. Despite the sheer cold where. I live, I always have a cold brew coffee in the morning.

I recently got into baking and would definitely be interested in any recipes you have. I'm still a beginner but I've really been on a kick for it lately. Tea is something I'm also looking to explore deeper as well.

Working on trying to design a few more tattoos to add onto my arm. Been considering getting a neck tattoo but I figure taking awhile to make a decision isn't a bad thing in this case haha.

Obviously consult with your doctor to be safe but just sharing my experience.

I've been taking it for a few months now just to help with anxiety and sleep but holy crap. The effect its had on my ADHD and focus has been wild.

It's not like Adderall or anything crazy and there isn't any ""on switch"" moment but it's enough to give my mind some flexibility to THINK.

I'm a lot less jittery after my coffee and less prone to chase 100 things down at once. The best part is no zombie feeling or crash afterwards.

I did some digging into the science behind it and apparently it boosts the GABA receptors in your brain to calm down and overactivity which makes those mental tabs a lot more manageable.

Obviously not medical advice but if you're struggling with ADHD, focus, or feeling overwhelmed, give L-Theanine a shot.

So I'm a painter with no exhibitions and a writer who publishes no books. The following perfumes are ones I gathered with no intent, yet ended up being similar, evoking scent memories of junk drawers and cedar closets and rummaging where I had no business while a child. Something I also really love about perfume is that smell sometimes feels like a missing link in the creative process and experience in other art forms.

**Death & Floral - Shadow Monsters On Wooden Cabin Walls**  
*Pure dark chocolate tincture, jasmine sambac, blood orange, tobacco absolute, light woodsmoke (Scent of the Month: March 2023)*

Very basement cedar closet where the old fur coats no one will ever wear again are kept.

**Stone & Wit - Her Skirt Was Stars**  
*Chili pepper, dark chocolate, mezcal, labdanum, vanilla*

More chocolate forward, think raw mexican chocolate bar. The spice is what makes it different from the rest. The smokiness is probably what gives it a wood vibe.

**Black Hearted Tart - Idyllwild**   
*A warm, woodsy fragrance with a nutty sweetness. Creamy cashew milk, roast coffee beans, and brown sugar create coziness. Earthy cedarwood and resinous benzoin are rounded out with light touches of camphor and moss.*  *(Discontinued and no longer available).*

This has a sweet cream tinge to it. My boyfriend also said it made me smell like curry, which I have no explanation for.

**Mythpunk Olfactive - Changeling**  
*blood orange, orange blossom, tuberose, aged patchouli, smoked cacao absolute, coffee sco2, and vetiver Bourbon*

Old books kept on a book shelf polished with orange oil, also I feel like I detect envelope glue.

**Mythpunk Olfactive - Black Witch Moth**  
*star anise, hawthorn, gauzy vanilla marshmallow, tuberose, golden patchouli, sandalwood, wild myrrh, coumarin, dried moss, moonlit musks*

This one is more...romantic? Maybe this is the cent of your Glam-ma's vanity drawer where she kept her floral perfume.

**Alkemia - Misdeeds After Midnight**  
A hedonistic adventure of late night coffee liqueur, white rum, and a splash of creme de bergamot; Black Forest raspberries dipped in salted caramel; and Arabian rosewater infused with vetiver root tumbling wantonly together into a seductive bed of vanilla musk and golden amber.

Probably the least cut wood of the bunch, but still feels related to the rest by vibes.

The Poem by Me

**THE YOU IN MY NIGHTSTAND**

Its face was the used page of a diary,  
all bleeding ink and bent corners.

A voice like a scratched record,  
no one to listen to it.

A dried ink pen for a spine,  
chewed up brittle plastic.

With a brass locket for a heart,  
hung on a tangled chain and empty of sentiment.

It peered at me with mica-flake eyes,  
squinting into fluorescent light.

I paid it with a copper penny to suckle  
And closed the drawer to no complaint.

My memory smelled like cedar and lint,  
felt like a knuckle in the eye.",1,1745862374.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

I've always loved the excitement you feel when trying a new coffee shop for the first time. I might be the only one, but I just love tasting and experiencing new things that involve coffee.

So I came up with an idea: the coffee passport. It's a way to mark the shops I've visited and categorize them by country and city. It took me a while, but that idea is finally a reality.

This project would be even more awesome with the help of a community, people who could help add more coffee shops from all over the world so that others can enjoy them too.

For me, this is like playing Pokémon, but with coffee shops.

The site is called [CoffeeZip.xyz](http://CoffeeZip.xyz) and it's totally free. I don't do this for money, coffee is my passion. So if you want to try it, feel free!

1ka1oev,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ka1oev/can_the_utopia_kitchen_uk0167_french_press/,Can the Utopia Kitchen UK0167 French Press Elevate Your Coffee Experience Review?,"The Utopia Kitchen UK0167 Stainless Steel French Press immediately caught my eye for its sleek design and promises of café-worthy coffee. Being an avid coffee drinker and someone who experiments with various brewing methods at home, I had to give this one a try. Spoiler: it didn’t disappoint, but there's plenty to say about it—good and not-so-good.

**A Truly Stylish and Sturdy Coffee Gear**  
A coffee maker’s aesthetics matter, especially if it’s going to sit on your kitchen counter day after day. This French press, with its stainless steel finish, looks premium and feels robust. It screams durability, and anyone who’s familiar with the frustration of breaking delicate glass presses will appreciate this one. Beyond its good looks, it sports a double-walled design that impressed me from the get-go. It’s not just a feature—it works! My coffee stayed hot for what felt like ages, which is perfect for those slower mornings where sipping coffee is more of a ritual than a rush.

**Filter Game On Point**  
This French press boasts a 4-layer filtration system. Curious, I tested it with coarse-ground coffee, as recommended. No stray grounds sneaked into my mug, which, for a perfectionist like me, is a huge win. It made for a cup that was clean, flavorful, and aromatic. I’ve tried other coffee presses in the past that left me chewing on fine grit—an absolute no-go. This one tackles that problem head-on. Extra filters are provided, too, which is a nice touch for long-term use.

**Brewer for All Occasions**  
Versatility is often overlooked in kitchen gadgets, but Utopia Kitchen’s French press surprised me. Brewing my morning coffee was seamless, but I also put it through its paces in other scenarios. During a camping trip, it made tea just as effortlessly as coffee. Bonus points for not relying on electricity—no power, no problem. Its lightweight yet strong build made it ideal for throwing into a travel bag without fear of breaking it.

[Ready to snag Utopia Kitchen UK0167? See Amazon’s price.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01g2ccwgy/)

**Ease of Maintenance**  
One thing that kept me coming back to this press was how simple it is to clean. Assembly and disassembly took almost no thought, making me feel slightly smug about skipping the overly complicated alternatives on the market. A quick rinse or some dish soap and it's good as new. Honestly, between its fuss-free care routine and adaptability, I find myself using this French press even more than I initially thought I would.

**Key Benefits**  
- Long-lasting stainless steel design that looks classy and holds heat well.  
- No coffee grounds slipping through thanks to its advanced filtration system.  
- Ideal for both home use and outdoor adventures.  
- Comes with extra filters for added convenience.  

**Flaws**  
Every coffee maker has its quirks, and this French press isn’t an exception. While I thoroughly enjoy its performance, there are a few things to keep in mind.  
- The double-walled design keeps coffee toasty, but if you don’t preheat the press, some heat is lost faster than expected. Lesson learned—always warm it up!  
- Compared to traditional glass presses, it’s heavier. This isn't a dealbreaker, but if portability means ""ultra-light"" for you, it might feel bulkier than some alternatives.  

**Rival Brands**  
Competitively priced coffee makers abound, and two other options quickly came to mind while testing this product: the Bodum Chambord and Stanley’s Classic Vacuum French Press. The Bodum Chambord has its own polished charm, but the glass construction feels fragile next to the steel armor of the Utopia Kitchen press. As for Stanley, its press focuses more on outdoor ruggedness, while this one transitions effortlessly between home use and adventure. Utopia combines style and function in ways its competitors sometimes miss.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Given its mix of practicality and premium touches, this French press offers excellent value. The build quality is top-notch, and the additional filters make it feel like an all-in package rather than leaving you hunting for spares down the road. You could spend more on other options, but there’s no denying that this model punches well above its weight class.

Despite not being sure about my weight exactly because i only have Access to one scale, i think losing 10kg would be good regardless, and then i can go on from there. 

Ive started counting calories a few days before, trying to keep it within 1550-1780. Though i cant be fully sure when it comes to dinners because of portion sizes so i just estimate them as more because i feel like its a LOT. 

In the morning i drink a mug of coffee, then go to school. At like 4-5 pm i eat dinner at home, and i also like taking a snack home to eat (my village doesnt have shops so i bring it) that's typically like 500 kcals.

I have a vegan restaurant mystery in PA and am hoping someone can help solve it.

I was on a road trip throughout Pennsylvania recently and happened upon a fantastic vegan restaurant, and I cannot for the life of me remember its name, or the town, but I do know it was not in Philadelphia or Pittsburgh.

Here is what I have to go on: The menu featured an amazing vegan meatball sandwich, served on ciabatta, and there was also a buffalo tofu sandwich. The tofu was softer, not like a ""meaty"" consistency.

The restaurant was on a small-town main street. There might have been a pharmacy or hardware store on the block.

The restaurant seating was a mix of chairs at one side of the room with a coffee table, and then normal tables and chairs were on the other.

The owner was super kind, and the day I went, his young child was also there. (If the owner winds up reading this -- we had a brief conversation about how you stop by PeaceFood when you're in New York City!)

I did try and figure this out from HappyCow, but there are a LOT of entries on there, and I have not had any luck thus far. Google, as per usual, has returned a lot of slop results, so no luck that route. Craigslist also a bust.

I would love to return so if you have any ideas, please share.

Mad scientists the players helped earlier in the adventure can pitch in as Allies, but outside of some descriptive text there's no details about the area. The players had to check their gun prior, so my players were very much trying to figure out what kinds of weapons they could improvise.

Luckily, I had decided the adventure as-written hadn't included enough details and so the night before I wrote up a list of booths and their potential effects:

* Unbreakable butcher’s knives and Cleavers that never need sharpening
   * Can be used as impromptu weapons (str+d4)
* Mathematically-calibrated horseshoes
   * Can be used as improvised thrown weapons (Str+d4)
* Gentle (and not so gentle) sleep aids
   * No effect
* Automatic shepherds
   * Can be wound up and used as a distraction
* “Intelligent” barbed wire
   * Will curl around someone who falls on it, causing damage like Bloodwire (2d4, Athletics check to avoid being entangled)
* Hangover cures
   * No effect
* Bigger and better mousetraps
   * Could be used for raw parts when MacGyvering.
* Portable electric batteries
   * Could be used as a power source when MacGyvering.
* Self-cleaning spectacles
   * No effect
* A new version of the world famous clockwork de-moler
   * Can be activated
* Automated Turkish coffee maker
   * No effect
* New high efficiency rocket packs
   * Can be used by a player, will also explode for 3d10 in a medium burst template if it takes damage
* A knock-off of the famed Corliss Engine
   * will explode spectacularly if it takes more than 20 damage, all at once or cumulative; the explosion is 3d10 in a large burst template
* Electro-magnetic player organ
   * Serves as hard cover

As the players moved around the convention they sometimes asked me what was nearby and I just read down the list. This had some interesting results.

* Unbreakable butcher knives and mathematically calibrated horseshoes were thrown at the Automaton, to no effect
* One of the mad scientist allies used MacGyver to combine the Automatic Shepherd and the Intelligent Barbed Wire, in an attempt to ""Battle of Hoth it."" This succeeded, but...
* As the automaton stomped around after the players it found itself near the rocket pack booth; this only came up because the players asked what it was near. Its orders were to destroy all the booths, so it had to roll Smarts (d4) to understand it shouldn't stomp on the rocket packs right next to it... but it did scoop one up and fling it. The unfortunate scientist who rigged the automatic shepherd became a small crater in the floor.
* The Automaton can now barely move and is lurching after the players, who are having a lot of trouble getting through its armor. However it picked up one of the other rocket packs, which on its next turn it might throw... or one of the players might be able to shoot it, causing it to explode in the robot's hand.

The session had to end early so no resolution to this combat yet but I'm interested to see how it concludes.",2,1745861960.0,savageworlds,0,1.0,False

I am currently on a trip from Australia to New York to visit as many studios and broadcast facilities as I can. I started working for one of the big national broadcasters in Australia a little over 2 years ago, and this is a trip to just visit and see what is going on at the cutting edge of the industry.

I am kindly asking if you’re interesting in meeting up and giving me a tour of your facility or broadcasting centre. You’d have my eternal gratitude and I will owe you a favour and will bring you lots of coffee or whatever you want in return haha.

I really appreciate any tips, connections or tour hookups that you can offer, one of the big places I am touring this week is SiriusXM’s NYC Studios, which is super exciting.

I've always wanted to save the places I've visited, kind of like collecting them. I used to travel a lot, and having a map of all the coffees I've tried sounded like a dream to me.

So I came up with an idea: the coffee passport. It's a way to mark the shops I've visited and categorize them by country and city. It took me a while, but that idea is finally a reality.

This project would be even more awesome with the help of a community, people who could help add more coffee shops from all over the world so that others can enjoy them too.

For me, this is like playing Pokémon, but with coffee shops.

The site is called CoffeeZip. xyz and it's totally free. I don't do this for money, coffee is my passion. So if you want to try it, feel free! I just thought someone here might like it.

1ka1hz3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawyerAdvice/comments/1ka1hz3/what_can_i_do_about_perjury_on_restraining_order/,What can I do about perjury on restraining order?,"Location: MO. Someone filed a restraining order against me last year and it was evidently filled with extreme lies about me. I didnt go to court because I feared it would be too much for my depression.

This person claimed I was dangerous and she was in fear of the safety of herself, family and friends. I did nothing to support this and most people I meet frequently comment on how kind and helpful I am compared to others.

A few weeks ago I began working with her best friend at a coffee shop. After being offered the job I realized that she worked there and I messaged the manager saying I don’t think I can work there because I didn’t want there to be any conflict/problems. This girl told the manager and me that she knows who I am and she has no problem working with me.

The girl who filled the restraining order had her mom follow me from school to my home last week. This girl never once believed I was dangerous, she lied on the restraining order out of hate in order to hurt me. If she actually believed I was dangerous her best friend would have never let me work with her and her coworkers and her mom would’ve never came near me to talk to me. Their actions prove that she lied.

I have spoken to several people that we both previously worked with and they have all confirmed that she lied about several things on the restraining order because she was vindictive towards me. I have never hurt someone in my life, I have no history of violence whatsoever, I am going to school currently for nursing so I can help people and she committed defamation against my character as a way to hurt me.

This girl had spent a year on social media watching videos I made of myself singing and playing guitar. If I go on my Snapchat profile it shows that she viewed all of these for up to a year before the restraining order. She claimed on the order that I was following her because I made a video of myself singing and playing guitar outside of her workplace target. I would go outside and make videos of myself doing this everyday for over a year and she was aware but singled out that one video on the order without mentioning the hundreds of others I did as a way to make me appear worse than I am.

I was on probation for something else and because of this order of protection I had consequences from the po. Not to mention the damage this restraining had on my mental health and life and the amount of therapy it has taken for me to even begin feeling somewhat better. She intentionally lied on court documents.

I don’t want this girl to get in trouble in any way. I would never press charges or go after her in that kind of way. All I want is the restraining order to be permanently gone and for her to admit wrongdoing and to apologize for all the harm she caused me. Even then that won’t change anything, it won’t fix my mental health, it won’t remove the scars from my wrist, it won’t make my depression go away or make my probation that should’ve ended last year end any sooner but I just hope, I have to believe that if it goes away, if she apologizes then maybe I can finally move on and this depression can finally start to go away.

I don’t know what I can do because I don’t want anybody to get in trouble or to start any drama, I just want the truth to be out there because the thing I value most in this world is kindness and she told people i was dangerous and I would never hurt someone. She made these claims after she spent 6+ months bullying me. It’s wrong and it’s not right and if someone could please tell me if I have any options to stand up for myself it would really help me.

I (20M) work in retail and I don't know what to do anymore.

Despite the opening I actually am not complaining about my job. I don't know what to do, I feel incredibly lonely, I am close enough with my family and I don't feel as though I can talk to any of them about this, so I want to just post this on reddit, I don't feel I have anyone to talk to and maybe writing all this out will help.

I have been learning day trading for the past 3 years jumping around different retail jobs to just get by while I learn, my whole family is on board with this and are supportive. As far back as I can remember all I have ever wanted is to make as much money as possible, my family are not well of but are also not poor so I'm not entirely sure where this comes from.

Recently I asked out a girl (20F) from work, she's really nice and really pretty, she's 100% my type and I like almost everything about her from what I've seen so far, I've only been ""talking"" to her for about a month now, but we would talk occasionally at work when we could. We've only been on 2 dates and have met for coffee once after work too, we've called plenty of times and have spent hours on the phone to each other, sometimes playing video games and sometimes just talking.

Up until now I've never been even remotely close to having a relationship, I've spoken to countless people and always end up getting led on or I've just missed the memo somewhere. I am autistic and I find it hard to tell a lot of the time so I just take everything at face value. Previously to this girl, lets call her Beth for the sake of this post. I was speaking to someone else, maybe 3 years ago now and we went on 5+ dates just for her to text less and less and cancel on dates, making up horrendous excuses that I could never have questioned, ie: I can't meet, my nan went into hospital. and i think thats fucked me up a little, I find it hard to trust people since, and 9/10 my doubts are normally true.

Going back to Beth, I really like her, but I'm worried she doesn't feel the same about me, at the start she would message me more and would be more eager to meet. But now, she always seems to be busy studying for university or looking after her brother etc. She messages me once or twice a day and dismisses most invitations to do anything, however she seems interested when she does talk to me. I am giving her the benefit of the doubt as she is so nice when we do talk, and is so friendly in person too.

I really like it when we meet or call, but inbetween I find myself overthinking too much, I hate saying it and I hate feeling like this, I feel like a masssive wimp. I feel so alone now, I almost regret asking her out in the first place, I just feel so shit and sad all the time, I've cried countless times and lost sleep over it, and its pathetic really and I don't know how to get around it, its even more stupid because I've not even known her that long, but I can't really control how I feel. I wish she'd either tell me she's not interested so I can move on, or just show a bit more effort, i don't know. I think I am just scared to lose her, she seems perfect and it never seems to work out for me, and honestly im just fed up of it idk.

Feeding back in to the start, for as long as I can remember all I've wanted is to make as much money as possible, I want to have a nice car, and a motorbike, I want to buy my parents a new house so my siblings can all have their own bedrooms, and to just provide for my future family.

I had a motorbike about 2 months ago, I really liked it but unfortunately it kept breaking down and I couldn't afford to fix it, I used my motorbike as an escape. If i felt sad or lonely or just bored, I could go out on it and just rip it around the ring roads and out on twisty turny a roads. But I don't even have that anymore now.

I just feel so lonely, I have friends, i have family, but I just feel like I want a partner.

again, for as long as i can remember, all i've wanted is to make money. But now thats not the case, I think it would help, but now, all i want is for someone to love me the way that i love them.

I should be getting a new job, paying much better for the meantime, but I don't know if it's even going to help.

I'm fed up of social media

I'm fed up of second guessing everything anyone says.

Im so fucking lonely.

I just want to have \*someone\*

I'm not good at writing, I am sorry that this post has been all over the place, but I just wanted to get whatever was on my mind off my chest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>### Unlocking the Power of Adaptogenic Mushrooms

Adaptogenic mushrooms have taken the wellness world by storm for good reason. These fascinating fungi offer a natural way to support your body's resilience against stress, boost energy levels, and promote overall wellness. If you’re looking to enhance your health with nature’s gifts, understanding the unique benefits of the top adaptogenic mushrooms can be a game changer.

### What Are Adaptogenic Mushrooms?

Adaptogens are natural substances that help the body adapt to stress and restore balance. Adaptogenic mushrooms contain compounds that support the immune system, reduce inflammation, and help regulate hormones and nervous system responses. This makes them especially valuable for people facing daily stressors, fatigue, or immune challenges.

By incorporating adaptogenic mushrooms into your diet, you can directly influence your body’s ability to handle physical and mental demands more efficiently.

### Seven Must-Know Adaptogenic Mushrooms and Their Health Benefits

#### 1. Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum)

Often called the “Mushroom of Immortality,” reishi is revered for its calming, immune-enhancing properties. It promotes restful sleep, reduces anxiety, and supports heart health by lowering blood pressure. Reishi is a perfect choice if you want to manage stress naturally and improve overall vitality.

#### 2. Cordyceps (Cordyceps sinensis)

Cordyceps is well-known for boosting energy and athletic performance. It improves oxygen utilization and supports lung function, which is great for endurance. Athletes and busy professionals alike benefit from cordyceps’ ability to reduce fatigue and increase stamina.

#### 3. Lion’s Mane (Hericium erinaceus)

Lion’s Mane stands out for its incredible brain-boosting capabilities. This mushroom supports nerve growth and cognitive function, helping with memory, focus, and mental clarity. If you want to sharpen your mind or protect against age-related cognitive decline, lion’s mane is a smart addition to your routine.

#### 4. Chaga (Inonotus obliquus)

Known for its powerful antioxidant properties, chaga fights inflammation and supports immune defense. This mushroom encourages healthy skin and cellular regeneration and assists in balancing blood sugar levels. People dealing with chronic inflammation or wanting overall immune resilience will find chaga helpful.

#### 5. Shiitake (Lentinula edodes)

Shiitake mushrooms are not only delicious but packed with compounds that support cardiovascular health. They help lower cholesterol and boost the immune system. Regular consumption of shiitake may help prevent infections and promote heart wellness.

#### 6. Maitake (Grifola frondosa)

Maitake has gained attention for its ability to regulate blood sugar and enhance immune function. It may also help with weight management by supporting healthy metabolism. If you’re looking to balance your energy and blood sugar, maitake can be a valuable ally.

#### 7. Turkey Tail (Trametes versicolor)

Turkey tail is renowned for its immune-strengthening polysaccharides. It supports gut health by promoting beneficial bacteria and is often used as a complementary therapy for cancer support. Turkey tail helps maintain a healthy balance within your body’s systems.

### How to Incorporate Adaptogenic Mushrooms Into Your Lifestyle

You might be wondering how to add these powerful mushrooms to your daily routine. Luckily, they come in various forms like powders, capsules, teas, and extracts. Here’s how you can use them effectively:

- **Powders:** Add mushroom powders to smoothies, coffee, or oatmeal for an easy nutrient boost.
- **Capsules:** Capsules provide a convenient way to get precise doses without any taste.
- **Teas:** Brewing mushroom teas is a gentle way to enjoy their benefits, especially for reishi and chaga.
- **Extracts:** Concentrated extracts offer high potency for targeted health needs.
 
Consistency is key — taking these mushrooms regularly can help you experience their full adaptogenic benefits.

### Why Choose Adaptogenic Mushrooms?

While many natural remedies claim to reduce stress or boost energy, adaptogenic mushrooms offer a unique blend of benefits backed by traditional use and emerging scientific research. They work holistically by supporting your immune system, improving mental function, and helping your body balance itself naturally.

By choosing the right mushroom based on your health goals, you empower yourself with natural tools to live a more balanced and energetic life.

### Final Thoughts on Embracing Mushroom Power

Exploring adaptogenic mushrooms unlocks a world of health benefits that go beyond simple nutrition. From calming your nerves to enhancing brain function and fortifying immunity, these mushrooms offer a holistic approach to well-being. As you begin incorporating them, listen to your body and choose varieties that align with your wellness goals. Remember, these natural allies work best as part of a balanced lifestyle including good nutrition, sleep, and exercise.

</div>How to Incorporate Adaptogenic Mushrooms into Your Daily Wellness Routine
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Adaptogenic mushrooms have become a popular addition to many wellness routines, known for their natural ability to help the body adapt to stress and support overall health. These unique fungi contain powerful compounds that can boost immunity, fight fatigue, and improve mental clarity. If you're curious about how to benefit from these incredible mushrooms, integrating them into your daily habits is easier than you might think.

### Choosing the Right Adaptogenic Mushrooms

Before diving into your routine, it’s important to select mushrooms that suit your needs. Some of the most well-known adaptogenic mushrooms include reishi, chaga, lion’s mane, cordyceps, turkey tail, maitake, and shiitake. Each has distinct properties:

- **Reishi:** Promotes relaxation and supports immune health.
- **Chaga:** Rich in antioxidants and promotes skin health.
- **Lion’s Mane:** Enhances brain function and memory.
- **Cordyceps:** Boosts energy and athletic performance.
- **Turkey Tail:** Supports gut health and immunity.
- **Maitake:** Helps regulate blood sugar and supports weight management.
- **Shiitake:** Immune booster with heart health benefits.
 
### Integrating Mushrooms into Your Morning Coffee or Tea

One of the simplest ways to add adaptogenic mushrooms to your daily routine is by mixing mushroom powders into your morning beverages. Mushroom coffee blends or pure mushroom powders dissolve well in hot water and often combine with traditional coffee or herbal teas without overpowering flavor.

For example, adding a teaspoon of lion’s mane powder to your coffee can help sharpen your focus throughout the day. If you're after stress relief and calmness, reishi-infused tea is an excellent evening choice to wind down.

### Cooking with Adaptogenic Mushrooms

Whole or dried mushrooms into meals is another tasty option. Shiitake and maitake mushrooms can be sautéed with vegetables or added to soups for a nutritious boost. Chaga, often used as a tea, can also enhance the flavor and nutrition of homemade broths.

Here’s a quick idea: try making a hearty mushroom stew using a mix of fresh shiitake, maitake, and turkey tail mushrooms to support your immune system while enjoying a delicious meal.

### Using Supplements for Consistent Dosage

Supplements like capsules, tinctures, or extracts offer convenience and precise dosing. If you want a straightforward way to ensure daily intake, adaptogenic mushroom capsules are a great option, especially for those with busy lifestyles.

When choosing supplements, look for products that are organic, well-extracted, and standardized to contain high levels of bioactive compounds. This ensures you receive maximum benefit in each dose.

### Adding Mushrooms to Smoothies and Snacks

Another creative way to integrate adaptogenic mushrooms is by blending mushroom powders into your favorite smoothies or mixing them into energy bars and protein bites.

Combining lion’s mane or cordyceps powder with fruits, greens, and nuts can create a nourishing snack that keeps you energized and focused throughout the day. Tailoring flavors like chocolate or vanilla mushroom protein powders can make your snacks both healthful and tasty.

### Maintaining Balance and Listening to Your Body

While adaptogenic mushrooms are generally safe, it’s important to start slowly to monitor how your body reacts. Begin with small doses and gradually increase them as you become more familiar with your body's response. This approach can help avoid any digestive discomfort or allergic reactions.

In addition to dosage, maintaining a balanced approach by combining mushrooms with a healthy diet and lifestyle enhances their benefits. Regular exercise, adequate sleep, and hydration complement the adaptogenic support you’re giving your body.

### Practical Tips for Daily Use

- Pick one or two mushroom types to start with to avoid overwhelm.
- Incorporate mushroom products consistently at the same time each day.
- Store powders properly in a cool, dry place to preserve potency.
- Experiment with recipes and beverages to find what fits your taste.
- Combine with other wellness habits for a holistic approach.
 
By making adaptogenic mushrooms part of your everyday routine, you not only support your body’s stress response but also enhance mental and physical wellness in a natural, sustainable way. Whether through a morning latte, a comforting soup, or a convenient supplement, these powerful mushrooms can elevate your health effortlessly.

1ka1cst,https://www.reddit.com/r/deardiary/comments/1ka1cst/42825_the_pampered/,4-28-25 The Pampered,"I woke up about an hour ago, around 9:40 AM to the sound of my parents in the kitchen sitting, taking, and laughing together. I got up and used the restroom, washed my hands and my face, applied my vitamin C and my lotions, I still smell like country apple by bath and body works from last night's shower. I went into the kitchen and the smell of fresh coffee overwhelmed my senses, I had a cup of coffee, sat down, and smoked with my parents for a while. 

I went outside for fresh sunlight, the scent of florals, especially honeysuckle is strong this year.  They surround the premises. I think we should plant rose bushes again though, we used to have a rose bush but I accidentally killed it. I just wasn't good with plants back then.

Speaking of growing plants, I'm currently growing some spinach plants, tomato plants, and some bell and jalapeno peppers. I should have started growing my watermelons and cantaloupes in the beginning of April but I'm a bit late on that, so I will be planting them soon. It's not too late, not for the south, it stays hot down here for a while. 

I'm currently back in my room, though it's warm outside but it's nice and cool in here. I'm stress-free, bills are paid, plenty of food, all nestled in a secluded area that is safe and even protected by the few neighbors I have, the majority being old war vets. My parents, who are the same age and who had all of their children in their thirties (I'm the middle child, mom gave birth to me at 35), are, as a result, a tad older than other parents of people my age. They're in their 60s now, and while that may be true, they still look and get around like they are 10 years younger. They definitely look a lot younger than most people their age and comparing them to others their age, their physical issues are far less severe. Even in the case of potentially losing them one day, the property and assets will be passed down to me, something my siblings, parents and I have discussed already.

I'm writing about this because I told myself that I was going to try and focus on all the positives, there's a lot of positives. There have been times in my life where I have gone into mental spirals. While I live primarily happily, I think I blame  this on the seclusion I feel, but at the same time I enjoy it. I'm not sure, my life isn't terrible, especially compared to most. I do know there has been more than one time I have taken an attempt on my life, however, at the current moment I feel normal.

I wrote about astrology in my last entry, technically I have a triple stellium, Aquarius (which is also my sun sign), Capricorn, and a 5th house stellium. (Which also takes up my Capricorn). Quite heavy indeed, but considering how genuinely serene my life can be, I'm starting to believe Saturn has a crush on me.

Get in line, buddy.

Funny enough, all of my siblings and both of my parents are also stelliums. My dad, Pisces stellium. My mom, Cancer sun and stellium. My older brother, Capricorn stellium. My younger sister, Leo sun and stellium. Stelliums are supposedly a bit rare, I wonder what it's supposed to mean in the astrology world if an entire family unit is full of a bunch of stelliums.

Living in such a secluded state can be really incredible when you need your alone time, but it can be very upsetting when you crave companionship. It's one of the reasons why I have such a mix of real life and online experiences. I love my alone time, but sometimes I wish I could find love with someone more easily. It's already hard enough from what I've seen and heard, but on top of it to live out here, then also the fact that I was homeschooled for most of my life. I didn't get to know many people, men or women that I could potentially be interested towards in my town until I began working.

I was not impressed.

One girl who I met through my sister that I was interested in turned out to be really out of pocket and one guy that I found attractive I just knew was a fuck boy from the beginning, my intuition simply told me when he was asking me out, I said no, my intuition was proved right later. I do not like dating apps. The times I have dated throughout my life, because of  the fact that I do not use social media really and do not use dating apps they feel like I wouldn't check them either, had a couple people freely cheat online because they thought I'd never know. My dear, I'm not stupid. If (s)he's a player, they already lost. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

My dad was born in the south, florida, but he was raised in Maryland. My mom was born in Illinois and raised there. My mom, despite her Northern accent, has Southern roots. My grandma and great grandma were born and raised in the South which is why despite her accent, she has many Southern ideals and phrases that she says. I was born in Florida and we lived in a very bad neighborhood for a time, the area was littered with crime and organized crime alike and my parents worked really hard to provide better things for us so, I was raised throughout the south as we moved.

They have always wanted better for us, that's exactly why they don't kick me out, they are very kind people, they know that they already have everything set up in a way that if anything were to happen, we (their children) are set regardless. This is why I like to call them conservative hippies, there's this side of seriousness to them and responsibility to where they take care of things very well, but another side of them is relaxed and they do not take life seriously to which drifted into there children to which we also try not to take life too seriously, although mental health can put a damper in that. That's why I try to speak positively.

My dad has some frustrations with the south at times, I remember he said ""there's really nice people down here, but they're uncultured."" I thought it was a bit harsh, I still do, but to an extent he's not wrong. The amount of times I've tried to bring up certain knowledge or topics that my parents have conversed with me about, more specifically to older people or middle-aged people here, there is a lack of understanding within those topics. Even with some of the younger people, but not all, so I see where my dad was coming from, but I think what he meant to say was that they often only delve themselves within their own culture, which is hard not to do. Plus the South and the US and general is a bit of a melting pot of culture, but I think my dad was more referring to the people who were raised in the specific area we're in, which is much more secluded. It's hard to gain culture when you are so secluded and have not traveled much like we have. The south is a different entity on its own and it's massive. It's hard to go outside of that when you're so stuck into it. Plus it's fun, the people are friendly, it is what it is. I myself am Southern, how could I hate southerners? Well, there's always going to be those few bunch of people who you dislike, but still.

I think I'm going to do my makeup today, I'm currently watching ""The Love Witch"" which I've watched plenty of times before, I love love love her makeup. I think I'm going to do something like that today. I even have the perfect nude lipstick to use with the look. I also might repaint my nails, I'm not sure, I love the red but I sort of want to switch over to a dark green. I have a sparkly version that's exactly like the red but it's in green, that would look so pretty. I could do it with green makeup instead of the blue. 

I'm tired, might go for a walk, I got to eat too. Food is cooking, it smells great, I made some chicken stock and bone broth, I'm using some too cook a roast, I'm going to make homemade mashed potatoes and gravy too, and we have some Frozen green beans that I will season up. I might make cornbread, not sure yet. I have also got to tend to my plants.",1,1745861456.0,deardiary,0,1.0,False

I'm currently on a hunt to find a place near Washington Rd that I can sit and charge my laptop while working on my blog/doing applications. 

I'm looking for somewhere where i won't necessarily have to buy anything. I'm currently struggling with homelessness so I can't ""go home"" I only need a few hours a day, I'm not looking to set up camp, I keep myself clean, tidy, and smelling good. I just need somewhere to charge and work. 

places I've tried: 

Starbucks by the BP: It was the perfect spot for 2 days (2 hours each day) but I was told if I didn't buy anything I had to leave. I guess they changed their open door policy after 7 years in Jan 2025!! 

McDonald's: I was here on and off for about 2 weeks. I see a lot of people in here on laptops for hours, eating outside food, drinking from tumblrs etc. I decided to bring my refillable cup one day and was told I'm not allowed back if I don't purchase anything from them. I asked if there was any particular reason that day had I done something wrong since a lot of people hang out and the manager said my cup could have been filled with their machine. I saw multiple people bring their own drinks but I digress. 

anywho! Unfortunately I just CAN NOT afford anything these days. not even a $2 cup of coffee to be able to sit. 

is there a local library I can walk to on foot? a park? another spot with open door policy? please let me know!",2,1745861424.0,Augusta,17,0.6,False

He'd fought in a war, been stabbed in a bar fight and survived his wife and both their children, so it would be fair to say he’d lived through a lot and was a hardened guy. Yet the note stuck to his fridge by a Looney Tunes magnet still filled him with an unbridled, almost existential, dread:

**Colonoscopy - Friday, 8:00 a.m.**

He'd never had a colonoscopy. The idea of somebody pushing a camera *up there*—*ugh,* it made him nauseous just to think about it.

“But what is it you're scared of, exactly?” his friend Dan asked him over coffee and bingo one day. Dan was a veteran of multiple colonoscopies (and multiple forms of cancer.)

“That they'll *find something,*” said Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom.

“But that's the whole point of the procedure,” said Dan. “If there's something to find, you want them to find it. So they can start treating it.”

“What if it's not treatable?”

“Then at least you can manage it and prepare,” said Dan, dabbing the card on the table in front of him:

“Bingo!”

When Friday came, Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom was awake, showered and dressed by 5:30 a.m. despite that the medical clinic was only fifteen minutes away.

He arrived at 7:35 a.m.

He gave his information to the receptionist then sat alone in the waiting room.

When the doctor finally called him in at 8:30 a.m., it felt to him like a final relief—but the kind you feel when the firing squad starts moving.

Per the doctor's instructions, he undressed, donned a paper gown and lay down on the examination bed on his left side with his knees drawn.

(He'd refused sedation because he lived alone and needed to drive himself home. And because he wanted the truth to hurt *like it fucking should.*)

Then it began.

The doctor produced a black colonoscope, which to Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom resembled a long, thin mechanical snake with a light-source for a head, and inserted the shining end into Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom's rectum.

With his focus on a screen that his patient could not see, the doctor worked the colonoscope deeper and deeper into Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom's colon.

Mad scientists the players helped earlier in the adventure can pitch in as Allies, but outside of some descriptive text there's no details about the area. The players had to check their gun prior, so my players were very much trying to figure out what kinds of weapons they could improvise.

Luckily, I had decided the adventure as-written hadn't included enough details and so the night before I wrote up a list of booths and their potential effects:

* Unbreakable butcher’s knives and Cleavers that never need sharpening
   * Can be used as impromptu weapons (str+d4)
* Mathematically-calibrated horseshoes
   * Can be used as improvised thrown weapons (Str+d4)
* Gentle (and not so gentle) sleep aids
   * No effect
* Automatic shepherds
   * Can be wound up and used as a distraction
* “Intelligent” barbed wire
   * Will curl around someone who falls on it, causing damage like Bloodwire (2d4, Athletics check to avoid being entangled)
* Hangover cures
   * No effect
* Bigger and better mousetraps
   * Could be used for raw parts when MacGyvering.
* Portable electric batteries
   * Could be used as a power source when MacGyvering.
* Self-cleaning spectacles
   * No effect
* A new version of the world famous clockwork de-moler
   * Can be activated
* Automated Turkish coffee maker
   * No effect
* New high efficiency rocket packs
   * Can be used by a player, will also explode for 3d10 in a medium burst template if it takes damage
* A knock-off of the famed Corliss Engine 
   * will explode spectacularly if it takes more than 20 damage, all at once or cumulative; the explosion is 3d10 in a large burst template
* Electro-magnetic player organ
   * Serves as hard cover

As the players moved around the convention they sometimes asked me what was nearby and I just read down the list. This had some interesting results.

* Unbreakable butcher knives and mathematically calibrated horseshoes were thrown at the Automaton, to no effect
* One of the mad scientist allies used MacGyver to combine the Automatic Shepherd and the Intelligent Barbed Wire, in an attempt to ""Battle of Hoth it."" This succeeded, but...
* As the automaton stomped around after the players it found itself near the rocket pack booth; this only came up because the players asked what it was near. Its orders were to destroy all the booths, so it had to roll Smarts (d4) to understand it shouldn't stomp on the rocket packs right next to it... but it did scoop one up and fling it. The unfortunate scientist who rigged the automatic shepherd became a small crater in the floor.
* The Automaton can now barely move and is lurching after the players, who are having a lot of trouble getting through its armor. However it picked up one of the other rocket packs, which on its next turn it might throw... or one of the players might be able to shoot it, causing it to explode in the robot's hand.

The session had to end early so no resolution to this combat yet but I'm interested to see how it concludes.",2,1745861352.0,Deadlands,0,1.0,False

Initial vomiting episode was clear with some light brown and yellow—normal. This last run of vomiting was completely brown, but not the texture of coffee grounds. Looked like diarrhea. No red, no taste of blood. 

Should I be concerned with the color? Or is it likely just from my coffee? Was thinking the berberine caused this, but am beginning to consider this could be noro.

Per the doctor's instructions, he undressed, donned a paper gown and lay down on the examination bed on his left side with his knees drawn.

Then it began.

The doctor produced a black colonoscope, which to Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom resembled a long, thin mechanical snake with a light-source for a head, and inserted the shining end into Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom's rectum.

Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom's eyes widened.

With his focus on a screen that his patient could not see, the doctor worked the colonoscope deeper and deeper into Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom's colon.

(The room felt too cold, the gown too tight. The penetration almost alien.)

Five feet deep—and:

“Good heavens,” the doctor gasped.

“Is something wrong?” asked Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom. “Is it cancer—do you see cancer?”

“Don't move,” said the doctor, and he left the examination room. Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom's heart raced. When the doctor returned, he was with two other doctors.

“Incredible,” pronounced one after seeing the screen.

“In all my years…” said the second, letting the rest of his unfinished sentence drip with unspeakable awe.

1ka19n0,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1ka19n0/shithole/,Shithole,"Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom was seventy-one years old. He'd fought in a war, been stabbed in a bar fight and survived his wife and both their children, so it would be fair to say he’d lived through a lot and was a hardened guy. Yet the note stuck to his fridge by a Looney Tunes magnet still filled him with an unbridled, almost existential, dread:

**Colonoscopy - Friday, 8:00 a.m.**

He'd never had a colonoscopy. The idea of somebody pushing a camera *up there*—*ugh,* it made him nauseous just to think about it.

“But what is it you're scared of, exactly?” his friend Dan asked him over coffee and bingo one day. Dan was a veteran of multiple colonoscopies (and multiple forms of cancer.)

“That they'll *find something,*” said Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom.

“But that's the whole point of the procedure,” said Dan. “If there's something to find, you want them to find it. So they can start treating it.”

“What if it's not treatable?”

“Then at least you can manage it and prepare,” said Dan, dabbing the card on the table in front of him:

“Bingo!”

1ka18z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ka18z7/does_the_utopia_kitchen_uk0167_french_press/,Does the Utopia Kitchen UK0167 French Press Redefine Coffee Brewing? Full Review,"The **Utopia Kitchen UK0167 Stainless Steel French Press Coffee Maker 34 Oz** provides a unique mix of sleek design and practical functionality. As a coffee enthusiast who loves experimenting with brewing techniques, I found this French press both reliable and pleasing to use. This product is made of durable stainless steel with a smooth finish, offering exceptional heat retention and elegant looks, but there's more to unpack about its features and performance.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that strikes you is its robust construction. Unlike cheaper glass French presses, which often crack or shatter, this one is entirely made of double-walled 304-grade stainless steel. The finish is polished and smooth, feeling great to hold and incredibly sturdy. Its design also ensures coffee stays hotter for longer, which is a must for anyone, like me, savoring their coffee over a couple of hours. However, I will point out that the steel does make the coffee maker heavier, which could be a minor inconvenience for some users who prioritize portability.  

[Time to check **Utopia Kitchen UK0167** pricing on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01g2ccwgy/)  

**Ease of Use**  
This French press doesn’t require a lot of effort or skill to use. With its included four-layer filtration system, I noticed fewer grounds making their way into my cup compared to other coffee makers I’ve tried. Whether you intend to brew enough for a single serving or a group of people, the 34-ounce capacity lets you achieve just that. It is user-friendly; the entire setup can be disassembled quickly for cleaning. Plus, as someone who often camps, I found this manual operation ideal for outdoor trips where electricity isn't available.

**Coffee Quality and Filtration**  
One of the most critical aspects of a French press, in my opinion, is the filtration system. This one genuinely impressed me. Those fine stainless steel filters are effective at capturing even the smallest grounds, delivering smooth and rich coffee. Compared with cheaper models, the difference in taste is clear. It bears mentioning that I’ve had guests commenting on how the cup feels “cleaner” compared to coffee from other French presses. However, if you’re used to less robust filtration systems, you might notice the occasional bit of fine sediment, which is pretty common with French press brewing in general.  

**Advantages**  
- Double-walled stainless steel keeps coffee hotter for extended periods.  
- Sturdy and durable design ideal for both indoor and outdoor use.  
- Four-layered filtration system ensures smoother, sediment-free coffee.  
- User-friendly assembly and maintenance processes.  

**Disadvantages**  
- Heavier compared to glass French press coffee makers.  
- Lid design could leave room for slight spills when pouring too quickly.  

**Portability and Versatility**  
For someone who enjoys travel and camping, this stainless steel French press feels like it’s built to endure. Its sturdy body means you can pack it without worrying about accidental damage. It also doubles as a versatile tool since it’s perfect not only for brewing coffee but also making loose-leaf tea or even cold coffee when left overnight. That said, the weight is worth noting for hikers or ultralight travelers, as it’s not the most compact or feather-light option.

**Competing Products**  
In comparison to glass options like the Bodum Chambord, the steel construction of this French press ensures better durability, and the added heat retention eclipses competitors in colder environments. Meanwhile, products such as the Fellow Clara, while offering similar sturdiness, fall into higher price brackets, making this one appear much more economical. However, for those who are only casual coffee drinkers, there are budget options like the Kona French Press, which, although less durable, might seem better suited for occasional use.  

**Worth Every Penny?**  
The balance between cost and features is spot-on with this French press. Compared to pricier models, you’re getting just about every perk it offers—durability, performance, style—without emptying your wallet. If long-term use is a key priority, the investment is unquestionably justified, especially for coffee enthusiasts or frequent travelers. A thoughtful design with a budget-friendly tag often feels like a rare find, but this manages to tick both boxes.

I was diagnosed recently in my mid 20’s. Medication has made a MONUMENTAL difference in my life. 

Something I haven’t worked out yet: my
Morning routine! I used to structure my morning routine around making and drinking my iced coffee. However, now that I am on a stimulant, I don’t want to be adding caffeine into the mix. 

At the end of the day, I don’t really like coffee enough to switch to decaf but am missing that fun little drink and it’s routine in the morning. It was a nice ritual to get me up and moving.

Suggestions on something I could pivot to instead of coffee? I have a total sweet tooth (think the Starbucks refreshers) and would love it if it had a few simple steps— it kind of tricks my brain into thinking I’ve been productive right off the bat when I wake up.

1ka1590,https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane/comments/1ka1590/shithole/,Shithole,"Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom was seventy-one years old. He'd fought in a war, been stabbed in a bar fight and survived his wife and both their children, so it would be fair to say he’d lived through a lot and was a hardened guy. Yet the note stuck to his fridge by a Looney Tunes magnet still filled him with an unbridled, almost existential, dread:

**Colonoscopy - Friday, 8:00 a.m.**

He'd never had a colonoscopy. The idea of somebody pushing a camera *up there*—*ugh,* it made him nauseous just to think about it.

“But what is it you're scared of, exactly?” his friend Dan asked him over coffee and bingo one day. Dan was a veteran of multiple colonoscopies (and multiple forms of cancer.)

“That they'll *find something,*” said Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom.

“But that's the whole point of the procedure,” said Dan. “If there's something to find, you want them to find it. So they can start treating it.”

“What if it's not treatable?”

“Then at least you can manage it and prepare,” said Dan, dabbing the card on the table in front of him:

“Bingo!”

When Friday came, Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom was awake, showered and dressed by 5:30 a.m. despite that the medical clinic was only fifteen minutes away.

He arrived at 7:35 a.m.

He gave his information to the receptionist then sat alone in the waiting room.

When the doctor finally called him in at 8:30 a.m., it felt to him like a final relief—but the kind you feel when the firing squad starts moving.

Per the doctor's instructions, he undressed, donned a paper gown and lay down on the examination bed on his left side with his knees drawn.

(He'd refused sedation because he lived alone and needed to drive himself home. And because he wanted the truth to hurt *like it fucking should.*)

Then it began.

The doctor produced a black colonoscope, which to Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom resembled a long, thin mechanical snake with a light-source for a head, and inserted the shining end into Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom's rectum.

Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom's eyes widened.

With his focus on a screen that his patient could not see, the doctor worked the colonoscope deeper and deeper into Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom's colon.

One foot.

Three—

(The room felt too cold, the gown too tight. The penetration almost alien.)

Five feet deep—and:

“Good heavens,” the doctor gasped.

“Is something wrong?” asked Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom. “Is it cancer—do you see cancer?”

“Don't move,” said the doctor, and he left the examination room. Mr. Ashmnemusthphephnom's heart raced. When the doctor returned, he was with two other doctors.

“Incredible,” pronounced one after seeing the screen.

“In all my years…” said the second, letting the rest of his unfinished sentence drip with unspeakable awe.

:

**New York City**

*On a picture perfect summer’s day.*

*The Empire State Building*

*Central Park*

*The Brooklyn Bridge*

*—and millions of New Yorkers staring in absolute and horrified silence at the rubbery, light-faced beast slithering slowly out of a wormhole in the sky above.*

We work in the offshore, small vessel so it's our job to do the accommodation cleaning ect.

Because it's a small crew we are really feeling the lack of help, getting more pissed off with his ""I've been relaxing"" attitude while we are out in the heat doing jobs he's set.

The Mr. Coffee 2191951 Programmable Coffee Maker has become my daily go-to for brewing a perfect cup of coffee. Compact in design, it nestles neatly on my limited counter space without dominating the visuals of my kitchen. Its sleek black finish, with minimal chrome touches, feels timeless and unobtrusive. As someone who has tried many coffee machines in the past, I found this particular drip coffee machine to stand out for its simplicity and convenience.  

**User-Friendly Features That Simplify Mornings**

One of my favorite features of this coffee maker is its programmable functionality. I’m not exactly a morning person, but knowing my coffee can be scheduled to brew even before I roll out of bed adds a sense of calm to my routine. The “Brew Later” feature works like a charm, and with just a few button presses, I can set it up the night before. Walking into the kitchen and being greeted by the aroma of freshly brewed coffee feels like a morning victory every single time.  

[Check Mr. Coffee 2191951 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b081dnwg7n/)

**Thoughtful Design for Smaller Kitchens**

This coffee maker is compact at just over 10 inches high, fitting snugly into small kitchens or apartment spaces. It complements tiny countertops and doesn’t scream for attention. Its 25-ounce brewing capacity strikes a balance between serving just enough for me and an extra cup for a guest. The ergonomically designed carafe with ounce markings is another bonus, aiding quick and accurate filling. No measuring mishaps here!  

**Key Benefits**

- Compact dimensions allow it to fit easily into spaces where larger coffee makers might feel overwhelming.  
- Programmable “Brew Later” feature simplifies planning busy mornings.  
- Auto pause enables mid-brew pours without a mess, which is perfect for impatient coffee enthusiasts like me.  

**Minus Points**

- The carafe, although ergonomic, can feel fragile for clumsy folks.  
- The reusable filter, while effective, requires consistent cleaning to ensure a smooth brewing process.  
- Limited capacity might not suit households with multiple coffee drinkers.  

**Performance and Brewing Quality**

This machine might be petite, but it truly delivers when it comes to brewing quality. The reusable filter works in tandem with the built-in filtration system to produce coffee that tastes rich and satisfying. I’ve tested it with both pre-ground coffee and freshly ground beans, and it performs equally well. What’s more, the brewing speed is impressively quick, ensuring no wait time when I’m rushing in the morning. It also includes a two-hour automatic shut-off feature for safety, which I appreciate on those days when I have the memory of a goldfish.  

**Competing Brands**

Compared to other machines within its price range, such as the Black+Decker 5-Cup Coffeemaker or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the Mr. Coffee Programmable Coffee Maker offers a far more seamless and user-centric experience. While competitors may boast similar brewing capacities, they often lack the robust programmability and thoughtful auto-pause implementations that this one has streamlined. However, I must admit, some higher-end challengers have sturdier carafes and quieter brewing processes.  

**Worth Every Penny?**

This coffee maker balances affordability and good design remarkably well. It competes against pricier options by offering programmability, auto shut-off, and a reusable filter—all in one compact frame. For its features and performance, it feels like you’re getting the most bang for your buck. Instead of splurging on fancier machines, this one ticks all the essential boxes without overloading on unnecessary bells and whistles.

As someone who values a proper cup of joe, I was immediately intrigued by its build and features. There are some definite highs here as well as a few bumps worth mentioning, so let’s dive deep into the nitty-gritty of what this manual coffee maker brings to the (kitchen) table.

**How the Double-Walled Design Keeps It Together**  
One of the standout elements of this French press is its double-walled construction, crafted from 304-grade stainless steel. I particularly appreciated how the coffee stayed piping hot for what felt like forever. On a lazy Sunday morning, I brewed a pot, wandered around doing chores, and came back to find it still steaming. Compared to some single-wall French presses I’ve tried before, the insulation here is unquestionably superior. Despite its sturdy build, it feels surprisingly lightweight, which is a saving grace for my wrists early in the morning. However, the outer surface does feel warm to the touch after extended use, so it’s not entirely burn-proof.

**The 4-Layer Filtration System: A Win for Purists (Mostly)**  
I have years of experience battling tiny coffee grounds sneaking into my cup, and this French press genuinely surprised me with its four-layered filtration system. It successfully blocked the finest grounds from entering my mug about 95% of the time, which is better than most presses within this price range. That said, on occasions when I used coffee that was more finely ground than ideal, a sneaky bit would find its way through. For the best experience, stick to coarse-ground coffee—it’s what this press is truly designed for.  
[Check Utopia Kitchen UK0167 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01g2ccwgy/)  

**Durability Meets Aesthetic Appeal**  
Sleek, silver, and polished to perfection, this French press makes for quite a centerpiece whether it’s sitting on your countertop or traveling with you for an outdoor brew session. Built with a stainless steel exterior, durability is clearly a priority, and it shows. I’ve accidentally bumped it against my countertop a few times, and it has emerged unscathed. What’s more, the simple yet modern design makes it blend seamlessly into a kitchen full of other stainless appliances. On the flip side, the shiny surface does pick up fingerprints, so you may have to give it a quick wipe-down now and then if you care about how presentable it looks.

**Key Benefits**  
- Excellent heat retention thanks to its double-wall insulation.  
- Sleek and durable stainless steel finish that complements modern kitchens.  
- A multi-layered filtration system traps the smallest grounds for a smoother sip.  

**Shortcomings I Noted**  
No product is without its quirks, and this one isn’t an exception. While I’ve been quite impressed, there are just a couple of usability factors worth noting.  
- The plunger feels a bit stiff initially and may require some break-in.  
- Highly fine coffee grounds occasionally bypass the intricate filtration system.  
- Cleaning can be a little tedious due to small nooks and crannies in the filters.

**How It Fares Against Competitors**  
When considering similar products on the market, several options come close but don’t hit every mark. A classic alternative like the Bodum Chambord French Press offers a glass carafe, which is visually appealing and easier to spot when cleaning. However, it lacks the insulation benefits of double walls, so coffee cools much faster. On the flip side, the Fellow Clara French Press stands out for its intuitive design and non-stick interior, though its price is significantly steeper. Compared purely in terms of value and efficiency, the Utopia Kitchen model hits a sweet spot between premium features and affordability.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Given its robust construction, strong heat retention, and solid performance, this French press delivers exceptional value. While glass carafes may have a certain charm for some, I personally prefer the ruggedness of this model. It feels like it’s built to last, especially for anyone who’s clumsy with kitchen tools. If you need a coffee maker that won’t collapse under the weight of daily use or carefree camping trips, this might just fit the bill. Similar products might offer additional flair, but they often fall short in terms of durability, making this one a smarter spending choice.

he kept saying i was a boring person with a boring personality. i tried to keep it together but i felt really ugly in my stomach and felt so offended that my own friend was starting to diss me for being a hard worker. i kept wanting to change myself after that.

I’ve been diving deep into personal development lately — reading (and listening to) tons of books focused on mindset, habits, self-growth, financial freedom, and overall becoming the best version of yourself. It's been life-changing, and it made me realize... I’d love to connect with others who are on a similar journey!

I'm hoping to start a Personal Growth Book Club right here in Jersey City.
A little about me — I’m 29yrs old woman, child-free, and looking to meet others who are excited about growing, learning, and building a positive community. Everyone is welcome, no matter your age, gender, or stage of life — but I will say that since my days off are midweek (Tuesday–Thursday), I’d love to meet people who have a little flexibility to meet up during the week sometimes!

Here’s the plan:

~ As a group, we'll pick a new book each month — focused on topics like mindset shifts, goal setting, abundance, financial literacy, health, personal empowerment, etc.

~ We’ll vote on which book to read first!

~ Everyone reads at their own pace, and then we meet up (maybe at a casual dinner spot, coffee shop, or a park) to discuss the book — and probably a lot more too!


A few example books/authors that match the vibe:

Atomic Habits by James Clear

The Mountain Is You by Brianna Wiest

The 5AM Club by Robin Sharma

The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F* by Mark Manson

The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel

Anything from Mel Robbins, Jay Shetty, or similar authors.

We’ll stay connected through GroupMe, so if you’re interested, just join the chat here: https://groupme.com/join_group/107336858/QXBlOej5

**Start Q&A Portion**

* [Q&A: Will we ever get more games in the HUB?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFSbXXK95vc) - ANSWER: They *have* been discussing this recently. While not in Version 1.1, there is a possibility of seeing more games in addition to the [FICSIT Productive Packer Deluxe Mini-Game](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/FICSIT_Productive_Packer_Deluxe) *(Wiki Link)* on the the HUB Operation SCADA-HMI Terminal Desk that was added in Update 5. Any additional HUB game added *(if that happens)* will be one at a time.

* [Q&A: Could we have a drivable Vehicle for collecting Wood, Leaves, and Biomass?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSsIAObl9m4) - ANSWER: As was shown in [Optimization Coming in 1.0 - Foliage](https://youtu.be/yIKjR5jVv9Y?t=191) *(Video Bookmark)*,. the ""colliders"" for various types of Foliage was removed from Vehicles, which means you won't destroy *most smaller foliage* by driving a Vehicle over them, however, foliage that requires at least a Chainsaw to remove will be still be able to be destroyed by running over with a Vehicle. **Any foliage destroyed should appear in your Inventory.**

* [Q&A: Any plans to adapt the game for Ultrawide Monitors?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTutYodVln0) - ANSWER: The issue of [First Person FOV Modifier](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Settings#Camera_2) (Wiki Link) **can not be set below 1** has been reported on in [this Q&A Post](https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/post/66e074b2772a987f4a8a9ada), and [*other Q&A Posts*](https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/search?sort=1&search=fov%20modifier&date=All%20Time) which results in hand equipped items being ""zoomed in"" and appear closer to the player cutting off some of their appearance and making them seem far too large.
   * **Developer Comment (Bendh) in Q&A Post:** *""Hey, There is currently a shader bug which would cause equipment to break when using to high of a player FOV hence we changed the limit. We will have an internal discussion if we want to change this back to the original min / maximum and just accept it will look terrible or we want to keep it like this for now and find a proper solution in the long run. Thank you for your understanding.""*
   * Mikael will re-check with Ben to determine the current state of any ""fix"".

* [Q&A: Are there any updates on the performance issues regarding Holograms?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkXktJnQaCU) - ANSWER: Yes, this is a not a memory leak but a **render issue** where a hovering hologram will constantly replicate itself, and additionally in some cases your entire HUD will replicate over and over. *No fix yet, but they are fully aware of this issue.*

* [Q&A: Will there be any new Buildable types in 1.1?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLSmLcLkM68) - ANSWER: Mikael plans on talking about this in the Friday Video.

   * **⭑ UPDATE:** View [State of EXP and 1.1 - Specific Separate Buildables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk0bnT3VoTA&t=342s) *(Video Bookmark)*. ANSWER: **Not in Version 1.1**, *but perhaps later.*

* [Q&A: Any plans to explain Fluids in-game?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZ99Flu6vFE) - ANSWER: Fluids is a complex discussion, and Mikael does not understand it as well as Snutt did. He does plan on talking about this in the Friday Video. They may add better explanation about Fluid dynamics in game, but based on game development priorities, don't expect this anytime soon.

   * **⭑ UPDATE:** View [State of EXP and 1.1 - Throughput Monitors for Pipelines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kk0bnT3VoTA&t=362s) *(Video Bookmark)*. ANSWER: **Not in Version 1.1**.

* [Q&A: Can you add an internal video recording for Photo Mode dolly?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJbaOf55dNY) - ANSWER: Currently [Photo Mode Dolly Function Recording](https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/wiki/Photo_Mode#Recording) (Wiki Link) requires the use of external screen capture software. They *may* add a video capture feature in-game, but that is **very low on the priority list** so don't plan on it happening soon.

* [Q&A: Will Dedicated Servers get more love with crashes?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hu4095msuX0) (4 minutes) - ANSWER: Dedicated Servers are actively being looked at, and get bug fixes in most Game Patches and Updates. **Game development will continue after release of Consoles**. Dedicated Servers is part of any future plans for Satisfactory and is an area that often gets worked on less due to game development priorities, but they hope to do better going forward.

* [Q&A: Will we be able to change control type in 1.1 seamlessly (for Controllers)?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGl3HTjphEQ) - ANSWER: They have heard this feedback and are exploring ""options"".

* [Q&A: Will the Console Release with a physical CD version?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvuV_kubDPc) (3.5 minutes) - ANSWER: Much of the details related to the Console release have not been decided yet, with a release of a physical CD version one of them. Stay tuned.

* [Q&A: Will keyboard get auto-harvest in line with Controller support?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qTHj0R745Ig) - ANSWER: On a Controller holding the ■ Button or **X** Button activates a ""auto-collect"" feature, while on the PC you have to hold down the **[E] Key**.
   * That said, while holding [E] if you tap **Tab** twice then release [E] you can automatically collect Flora while walking. *Mikael* u/MikaelCoffeeStaStu *seemed to NOT be aware of this.*

* [Q&A: Will Consoles have Lumen support when Satisfactory drops on Consoles?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p3WTHTWFY0) - ANSWER: **No!** In fact Unreal Engine Global Illumination (Lumen) is not fully supported, but can be optionally turned on in the PC version, but this ability won't be in the Console Version.

* [Q&A: Could you post the Save Files used for the Trailers so we can explore them in detail?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abw2xBk0Few) - ANSWER: Mikael likes this idea, and will pass it on to the Production Team.

* [Q&A: Will the Stream Starting Soon background get a refresh for the 1.1 Launch Stream?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG51gZ3QPg4) - ANSWER: No, but they do have plans for this. Stay Tuned.

To Be Known is To Be Loved

Written by: AJ Alderman

The wind knows the rider before the horse does. Long before sunup, boots scuff barnwood and the rawhide creaks with memory. A buckaroo doesn’t announce himself… he just is. A silhouette stitched into the mesa’s edge, hat pulled low not in mystery, but in reverence. Out here, to be known is not to be seen, but to be trusted. The land doesn't care for noise, only for the kind of silence that speaks from the chest.

He moves like water, slow when he can, fast when he must… always listening. The cattle don’t flinch when he rides through, and that’s a kind of love, ain’t it? Unspoken, wide-eyed, mutual. There’s a gentleness to the way he loops the rope, as if he’s telling the steer, “I see you, I need you, I won’t hurt you.” Love, in the hands of a working man, looks like sweat and callus and quiet intention.

And the horse… the horse knows everything. He knows what the rider’s holding back. When the world falls off the edge of the plain and a man’s only company is his own breath, the horse still walks beside him like a brother that doesn’t ask questions. To be known is to be loved, and the horse loves him for who he ain’t trying to be.

So when the fire dims and stars poke their cold fingers through the sky, and the coffee’s gone bitter, he sits still. Ain’t got much to say. Ain’t much he needs to. The land knows him. The wind knows him. The old dog at his feet knows the rhythm of his sigh. And that’s enough. That’s everything.
Because out here, to be known is to be loved… and to be loved is to still be riding come morning",6,1745860202.0,Cowboy,1,1.0,False
1ka0ryb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NativePlantGardening/comments/1ka0ryb/when_is_too_late_for_60day_cold_stratification/,when is too late for 60-day cold stratification seeds? (maryland zone 7),"hi all! last fall i got a few seed packets from prairie moon nursery to try my hand at milk jug winter sowing with about 15 seeds sowed per species. two species germinated, and three did not:

packera aurea; rudbeckia fulgida; phlox divaricata


mid march, when i checked the containers and saw nothing happening with those three species, i decided to start a cold stratification in the fridge with coffee filters. i kept the containers going to make sure i didn't prematurely write them off, and to this day, still nothing.


if the fridge stratification works by comparison (i'm on about week 6), is mid/late may too late to work with newly germinated seeds? if not, what would be the recommended procedure for acclimating them, since they will not have experienced a ""spring"" and will jump straight into summer sun and temp, if that matters?

Na busca por mais cafés diferentes, aproveitei que uns amigos viajaram para fora do país e trouxeram uns pacotes para mim. Estou com um blend do Equador torrado pela Prodigal (NYC), um do Peru torrado pela Sey (NYC), um Pink Bourbon da Colômbia torrado pela Libertario (CO) e esse da foto, um blend de Pink Bourbons da Colômbia torrado pela Phil & Sebastian, que é canadense. 

O relato vai ser sobre esse último, o Jungle Berry. É um blend de três Pink Bourbons cultivados em Hulia, na Colômbia. O processamento passou por dois estágios de fermentação. 

Olha, foi um dos melhores cafés que já bebi. Fiz na v60, mugen e levei uma dose para um amigo fazer no orea v4. Absurdo. Café limpo, que deixa sua boca salivando e pedindo mais goles. 

Na extração, o tamarindo vem bem notável. Na boca, é berry puro. Suculento demais. Acidez cítrica leve que pegava a boca inteira. Foi uma experiência bem legal. 

A v60 me trouxe mais o tamarindo, o orea v4 trouxe bastante berry (meu método favorito) . Na mugen, usei uma moagem muito fina e as notas ficaram meio apagadas. Preciso fazer mais testes. Mas, todos os métodos me entregaram um café limpo. Nem parecia que passou por dupla fermentação. 

Em breve vou abrir os outros pacotes que comprei e conto por aqui. Adianto que tomei um gesha da Prodigal na casa desse amigo e foi o melhor gesha que já bebi. Então, estou bem ansiosa por esse blend do Equador deles que comprei. ",1,1745860020.0,cafebrasil,0,1.0,False

1ka0q43,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ka0q43/discover_the_yabano_espresso_machine_review_is/,Discover the Yabano Espresso Machine Review: Is This Coffee Maker Worth It?,"Owning the Yabano Espresso Machine, item model number Espresso Machine, has been an interesting journey in my coffee-making adventures. As a self-proclaimed coffee enthusiast, experimenting with new gadgets is always a treat. This sleek black espresso maker caught my attention because of its compact design, built-in steam wand, and affordable price. It seemed perfect for someone like me who craves homemade brews but doesn’t want to commit to a massive, counter-hogging machine.

**Compact Design and Build**  
I was amazed at how little space this espresso machine occupies. With dimensions of 13.43 inches deep, 10.94 inches wide, and 7.6 inches high, it comfortably fit in a corner of my tiny kitchen without appearing intrusive. Weighing just 4.66 pounds, it’s incredibly easy to move around. However, the metallic finish is paired with plastic components, which initially gave me some doubts about its long-term durability. After a few weeks of daily use, the construction has held up well, though it’s definitely not as robust as stainless steel competitors.

**User-Friendly Operation**  
This machine is ridiculously beginner-friendly, which is a significant plus. I don’t need to spend hours deciphering a manual when I’m desperate for caffeine. Pour water into the tank, scoop in some ground coffee medium-coarse as recommended, and lock the portafilter into place—it’s that straightforward. At first, I struggled a bit to secure the filter holder because the locking mechanism feels very tight. Honestly, it requires a bit of practice, or as one user mentioned, flipping the machine upside down for alignment practice (though this isn’t ideal unless you love cleaning). 

[Ready for a Yabano Espresso Machine? Check Amazon for prices here.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c1ghhcgm/)

**Steam Wand and Milk Frothing Experience**  
I’ve always dreamt of making lattes with perfectly frothed milk, and finally, I can! The built-in steam wand is simple to use. While the wand delivers creamy foam that’s good for cappuccinos and lattes, achieving the texture I wanted took some tinkering. I even enlisted my roommate in trying our luck with oat milk, almond milk, and regular dairy. The frothing experience was fun. However, there’s this screeching noise when frothing that reminded me of my cat when he’s displeased. It felt amusingly odd the first time, but the milk texture made up for it.

**Performance Under Pressure**  
The 3.5-bar pressure system is modest and doesn’t rival the crema-heavy espresso shots you get from high-end machines with higher pressure systems. Yet, it brews a decent espresso with balanced flavors that have impressed both me and some friends who tried it out. The warming feature is also efficient, and the temperature seems consistent, though I’d happily take an upgrade in pressure if I was planning on leveling up my at-home coffee experience.

**Strengths**  
- Compact and lightweight, making it easy to store or shift around.  
- Beginner-friendly controls allow hassle-free espresso brewing.  
- Produces decent quality espresso for its price.  
- Built-in steam wand is helpful for enthusiasts attempting their first lattes or cappuccinos.  
- Straightforward cleaning process as the portafilter, drip tray, and nozzle come off easily.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The locking mechanism for the filter is overly tight and requires practice to secure comfortably.  
- Plastic-heavy build may not age as gracefully as models with more robust metallic finishes.  
- Steam wand noise can catch users off guard.  
- Lack of an auto-off feature can be risky. Missing this critical safety aspect means I must consciously check if the machine’s red light indicator (placed inconveniently on the side) is off before stepping out.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Before buying this machine, I researched competitors like the De’Longhi EC155 and the Mr. Coffee Café Barista. De’Longhi offers higher pressure (15 bars), superior durability, and a more polished espresso but at a significantly higher price. Meanwhile, the Café Barista boasts an impressive range of automated features but takes up more counter space and is harder to clean. The Yabano serves as a middle ground—affordable, easy to use, and compact. It lacks the advanced tech of high-end machines, yet its simplicity is a win for casual users seeking an entry-level espresso maker.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Comparing this machine with its competitors, it’s a solid cost-effective choice for beginners or those experimenting with homemade espresso drinks. While it lacks the premium features of pricier counterparts, its performance aligns well with its price tag. As someone who used to spend exorbitant amounts on coffee shop lattes, having this machine is like owning a small barista setup without breaking the bank.

1ka0q1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1ka0q1u/does_the_utopia_kitchen_french_press_review/,Does the Utopia Kitchen French Press Review Reveal the Best Coffee Maker?,"The Utopia Kitchen UK0167 Stainless Steel French Press Coffee Maker quickly found its way into my daily coffee routine. Being someone who brews coffee every single morning like it’s a sacred ritual, I was genuinely excited to try this product. Let’s face it—those pod coffee makers can never give you the same sense of satisfaction as sipping a freshly brewed French press coffee. Here’s my honest take on this iconic brewing tool.

**First Impressions and Design**  
This stainless steel French press stands out with its sleek and modern look. The polished finish feels durable and upscale. I couldn’t help but admire its robust, double-walled construction designed to retain heat longer. It’s larger than some other presses I’ve used, with a 34 oz capacity, making it perfect when you’re hosting friends or tackling a groggy Monday morning solo. The handle feels sturdy yet comfortable while pouring, but I did notice that it can get a bit warm if the press sits around for too long, which is worth noting for the clumsier coffee drinkers out there.

**Functionality and Brewing Experience**  
Using this product was as straightforward as brewing coffee should be. The 4-layer filtration system ensures no tiny grinds sneak into your cup, something I deeply appreciated since I despise chewing my coffee (please, no thank you). The French press works well with coarse-ground coffee, delivering that rich, perfectly brewed cup every time. I also tried brewing some loose-leaf tea, and boy, it was a game-changer. Versatility and functionality score high in my book with this one. 

[Check Utopia Kitchen UK0167 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01g2ccwgy/)  

**Key Benefits**  
- Polished stainless steel for durability and heat retention.  
- 4-layer filtration system keeps grounds out of your cup.  
- User-friendly and straightforward manual operation.  

**Versatility and Portability**  
This French press proved its worth beyond just my kitchen counter. I packed it on a road trip and found it super convenient to use outdoors. The lightweight design (just under 2 pounds) and solid stainless steel make it a viable option for camping trips or an office desk setup. Whether you need your caffeine in the woods or just a small break at work, this little brewer has your back. The 34 oz size also means using it for multiple servings or for brewing cold brews is no problem at all.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Handle can get warm with prolonged use.  
- Stainless steel exterior attracts fingerprints easily.  
- Not completely scratch-proof without extra care.

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Cleaning has previously been my least favorite part of owning French presses, but this one did surprise me. It’s straightforward to assemble and disassemble, and the filters didn’t put up a fight during washing. A quick rinse with soapy water keeps it sparkling clean. Still, drying it out thoroughly is a must, particularly to avoid any lingering water spots on the shiny exterior. 

**Competition in the Market**  
While I enjoyed the Utopia Kitchen UK0167 for its reliability and premium feel, you might want to compare it to other products like the popular Bodum Chambord or Frieling’s stainless steel French press. The Bodum Chambord has more of a traditional glass-body design which some users might prefer for visual brewing, but it lacks the heat retention offered by Utopia’s double-walled construction. Frieling's press surpasses this one in scratch resistance but often comes at a much heftier price. If heat retention and affordability are what you prioritize, this press holds its ground impressively well. 

**Value for Money**  
When considering the quality versus its price, this French press is definitely worth its weight in coffee beans. Its durable construction, large capacity, and consistent brewing results deliver excellent bang for the buck. Sure, there are pricier options packed with more luxurious bells and whistles, but this press keeps things simple and functional without compromising the experience. In terms of long-term performance, it punches above its weight in the affordability department.

1ka0pzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1ka0pzi/does_the_waterdrop_10ua_under_sink_water_filter/,Does the Waterdrop 10UA under sink water filter deserve your attention? Review inside!,"The Waterdrop 10UA Under Sink Water Filter System promises to deliver clean water with convenience and innovation. After testing it daily in my kitchen, I found both impressive features and certain drawbacks worth sharing. Here's my detailed experience with this intriguing water filtration system.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
I have to admit, the sleek stainless steel case of the product stands out right away. It’s not just aesthetically pleasing but also durable. The unit feels sturdy, and I’ve personally noticed it resists scratches and minor impacts well. It's small enough to fit snugly under my kitchen sink without any issues, yet doesn’t compromise on its filtration capacity. Plus, its FCC electromagnetic safety certification gives extra peace of mind, especially when it comes to electronic appliances installed near water.  

**Performance and Functionality**  
The core selling point of this water filter is its ability to reduce 99.9% of chlorine, bacteria, and viruses, as claimed by the brand. From my experience, the water tasted noticeably cleaner and felt fresher—which made a difference when brewing coffee or tea. What really grabbed my attention is the UV LED purification method. Unlike traditional mercury lamps, the LED system eliminates the risk of mercury leakage, and its performance was hassle-free even after heavy use.  

**[Check Waterdrop 10UA price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0bpm3v7z6/)**  

**Ease of Installation**  
Installing the system didn’t require any advanced plumbing skills, which was a huge plus for me. Everything fit right into my existing setup! There’s a 1/4 - 3/8 adapter included, so I didn’t need to purchase additional parts. Within 15 minutes, the system was operational. That seamless process made me appreciate how user-friendly it is.  

**Long-Lasting Purification**  
The promise of up to 50 years of lifespan for the LED UV light was initially difficult to believe, but after comparing it with older mercury-lamp filtration systems, it’s clear they’ve opted for a futuristic—and frankly game-changing—solution. Knowing I won’t have to deal with mercury lamp replacements or their risks is definitely a relief.  

**Key Benefits**  
- Durable stainless steel housing resists damage from daily wear.  
- LED UV system ensures long-lasting and safe water purification.  
- Compact size fits seamlessly under most sinks.  

**Energy Efficiency and Smarts**  
One of the features I quickly came to appreciate is the intelligent detection system. It automatically switches the UV light on and off depending on water flow, which not only conserves energy but also prolongs the UV light’s lifespan. It saved me from worrying about whether I’d accidentally leave something running unnecessarily. A quiet and thoughtful touch!  

**Negatives**  
- The water flow rate is limited to 2 liters per minute. For larger households, this could be a bottleneck.  
- At 2.4 stars on customer reviews, I noticed some users were skeptical of long-term consistency.  
- The LED light might not suit everyone’s preference due to its price compared to mercury lamps.  

**Competing Products**  
In the world of under-sink water filters, brands like APEC and iSpring offer tough competition. APEC’s systems tend to have higher flow rates, while iSpring’s multi-stage filters focus on removing a wide array of contaminants. The product excels with its UV light technology and stainless steel build, but APEC and iSpring might appeal to those prioritizing higher filtration capacities or more advanced multi-filter options. However, what stands unique here is the ease of maintenance and incredible durability, especially with the 50-year UV light assurance.  

**Money's Worth**  
Considering the package, the water filter is fairly priced for those who prioritize a long-lasting, safe LED-based system over frequent cartridge replacements or dealing with hazardous mercury lamps. On the other hand, people looking for ultra-high filtration through multiple layers might find better value elsewhere. But for families like mine who want reliable yet low-maintenance purification, it’s an investment worth considering.

1ka0oub,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1ka0oub/my_aunt_cheated_on_my_uncle_and_their_youngest/,My aunt cheated on my uncle and their youngest daughter (16) is suffering. Do I tell my parents?,"Hi everyone, I'm needing some advice. I'm using fake names as this is still not out and I don't want to risk anybody in my family seeing this. 

My younger brother, we will call him Thomas (M20) told me a few months ago that our cousin Johnny (M19) told him that his mom Kathy, our Aunt, had an affair and cheated on my Uncle years ago but this information only came out recently. Johnny's younger sister and our cousin Sydney (F16) found out about the affair was she was very young, like 12 I think, because she was playing on her moms ipad when messages came through she was not supposed to see. She opened the message and saw more messages along with explicit photos and videos of her mom and what turned out to be a coworker. This apparently had been going on for years. Sydney kept it a secret for all these years, obvi too young at the time to really understand what was going on, but has always hated her mom and nobody every knew why. A few months ago Sydney and my Uncle Collin, her dad, got into a big fight and it came out during the fight that Kathy had the affair. 

My brother and I talked in length about the situation and at the time decided it was not our place to tell our parents. Currently only my brother, me, my bf of 3 years, Johnny, and Sydney know about the affair. This came out in October 2024, and since then Sydney has been ""acting out"" but us cousins all know why and nobody else in the family does. By ""acting out"" I mean she's staying out super late with friends, not getting up for school in the morning, missing classes, has maybe a 2.0 GPA, and skips out on family events. To my parents and the rest of the family they believe shes out with boys and doing stupid stuff and her parents are just letting her get away with it. Over thanksgiving my mom asked me to take her for a Dutch run (coffee stand thats trendy with the teens for sugary drinks) and see whats going on. Of course I already knew but I also wanted the chance to check in with her. We got in the car and I told her I knew and we talked. She told me that her parents are either fighting aggressively (yelling, screaming, throwing shit) or having super loud sex all the time and the reason she's never home or stays out late is to avoid that. Which is like totally understandable and thats what I was kinda assuming. The fighting I assumed would happen, not the (hate?) sex. Thats a little wild.  I asked her if she was doing anything like drinking or drugs or doing stuff with boys and of course she said no and I do believe her because I opened up to her about some of the crap I did in highschool (I was a horrible child and got into bad stuff thank god my parents whooped me and got me back on track) and just told her I don't care what you do as long as you aren't doing anything that could ruin her life. She just said she's just talking with her friends and sleeps over at her bestfriends house most nights to get away from all the crap at home(She recently had her first kiss at 16 and her friend group is from youth group at church so I don't think she's that kind of kid or around anything bad luckily). We ended the talk with me promising her I would tell anybody and that I was here if she needed anything and her promising to just stick to hanging around her girlfriends and not doing anything super dumb. Johnny, her brother, left for the military a few weeks after the affair came out so she's been completely alone in this. On top of the fighting and loud sex, my Uncle has been crying to her and refuses to get help or tell anybody because Kathy has manipulated him into believing their life will fall apart if he does. 

Since then, Kathy and Collin got their vows renewed in Vegas, Collin got a tattoo for their family with all their initials in the tatto, Kathy started ozempic and is apparently getting a boob job, they took Sydney out of school for 2 weeks to go to Mexico aware of her hanging-by-a-string 2.0 GPA, and is letting Johnny whose freshly 19 marry his gf who he wanted to dump when he went to basic training. Sydney did confirm with me that Uncle Collin wants a divorce, Kathy isn't allowing it and wants to stay together. I don't wanna make this too long but for more info my Uncle Collin is in his 50s and had one failed marriage before marrying Kathy. Collin and my dad have butted heads over the years on and off. They are both A type personalities with a dash of male narcassism (we do love them dont worry lol) and my Uncle does have a issue with some jealousy towards my dad because he is more successful than him in life (successful company, still with my mom whose my dads first and only wife, successful kids, and the fact my dads the youngest brother). Uncle Collin and my dad have gotten better with each other over the years and have always been there for each other no matter what. I add this info to the story because I do believe is relevant for those of you wondering why my Uncle decided to keep this from my dad. With all that said though, In my family, no matter the problems we have with each other, we believe in leaving those issues at the door when family needs us because family comes first. So I do know if Uncle Collin told my dad, my dad would be there for him through it all. 

Theres so much more history I wont dive into with Kathy and Uncle Collins relationship but its genuinely a full family crash out for them and almost every week my mom will call me and basically say wtf is going on with them? My mom and I super close, and she's a terrible actor, so I would know at this point if she knew and I don't think my mom would be calling me wondering wtf is going on with them if she knew. My dad isn't an outwardly emotional individual all the time and he just kind of ignores the issues with Uncle Collins family because he knows it would cause issues if he had an opinion and he doesnt want to bad mouth his brother. 

A couple weeks ago at Easter dinner with the family, Sydney came and she looked like a freakn ghost. She looked so entirely shut down in every way possible. Seeing her like that and after talking with my boyfriend about the situation I called my brother to tell him I think it's time to tell our parents. Sydney and Uncle Collin clearly need support and have none. I'm coming from a place of being extremely worried about Sydney. She is basically being completely ignored by her parents and is in this super unstable environment. Syd has no plans for her future, probably won't get into college, and I'm worried she'll get kicked off the volleyball team at school because of how low her GPA is. It's probably the only thing keeping her at school at all these days. I feel like she needs another set of adults in her life to get her back on track and support her. She is one of those kids that most people think she's at least 18-19. Tall, beautiful, smart, and mature beyond her years which I now realize is probably from all this trauma she's been dealing with for years. 

  
I'm not 100% sure if its a good idea to tell my parents, and if I do how do I tell them? I've already kinda decided I'm going to but I guess I'd like others thoughts and advice because I've never delt with a situation like this. I mean of course if everyone thinks I'm idiot for wanting to tell them I'll listen lol. But just to add incase anybody thinks Im an AH for not saying something sooner, I wanted to give Uncle Collin the choice and time to say something on his terms because of him and my dads history. Now, I think its been long enough and I'm worried about Sydney. My parents are awesome people, and I believe they would handle it well and be reasonable with whatever way they want to go about addressing the situation. However my dad is protective as hell, and there is a possibility he kinda looses his shit on Kathy, and then Collin for not prioritizing supporting his daughter in this situation. We've never really had something like this happen in my family, and loyalty is one of our biggest values as people so I'm a little worried about the fallout from telling my parents. Thanks everyone for any advice adn thoughts.",1,1745859861.0,whatdoIdo,1,1.0,False
1ka0olx,https://www.reddit.com/r/camaro/comments/1ka0olx/has_anyone_had_their_exhaust_butterfly_valves/,Has anyone had their exhaust butterfly valves deleted (5th Gen L99 Convertible)?,"Hi, this is my first post here! I have a 2011 Camaro SS Convertible (L99, automatic) that's been in the family since new and was handed down to me during the pandemic. I immediately got to maintenance work (fluids, brakes, fuse pull, etc.) even if it had only 13xxx miles since it wasn't used very often.

I also had an axleback exhaust custom-fabricated and installed around 2 years ago - since for some reason, the L99 convertible is shockingly quiet. I wasn't so sure if I just got a lemon but my car came with all the bells and whistles (Boston system, clusters near the shifter) so it should've been noisier.

Now it seems like the culprit is the Exhaust Butterfly valves, which, after some research, I've confirmed to only be on the convertible units.  I never really noticed it until last week, when I had the resonator deleted and replaced by an X-pipe. For some reason, this caused the valve to suddenly make an irritable grinding noise at certain revs and startup. I assume it's caused by unexpected airflow beyond what the valves are used to.

My exhaust guy recommended cutting away the small section where the valve is, and just replace it with standard piping. My fear is that it will cause a CEL or the car's readings to go haywire. I checked [Camaro forums](https://www.camaro5.com/forums/showthread.php?t=275303&page=3) and others seem to say that removing it will expose a ""coffee grinder"" noise with AFM, which is also strange. 

Others also welded the valves instead of removing them.

Can anyone provide any insight on what the best thing to do here is? (And the best option if no one in my area can disable the AFM). Thank you!",1,1745859847.0,camaro,1,1.0,False

I couldn’t possibly assign you a name, but I’ll tell you that today I’m picturing you with brown hair, the color of dark coffee. You have large, brown eyes, soft with care and wrinkled around the edges from age. You look at me like you already know me. Now I realize I’m describing my dad. Oh well. Tomorrow, the image will change again. 

It’s as good a day as I’ve had in a while. The food trucks have come. This is both the best and most dangerous day. I realize you probably don’t know anything I’m talking about. The food trucks come from time to time, delivering food, as you’ve probably guessed, but it can be hazardous collecting it. 

We had food trucks before, but those were different. Those trucks parked along a street, and you stood in line and paid for food that you ordered. Just talking about it makes my mouth water. Somehow, I can remember the smell wafting from the trucks better than the taste of the food: fish tacos, crab cakes, pork BBQ, fries. I wonder how these would taste to me now. I don’t think I could go back to eating anything else if I got a taste for real food. 

We don’t get real meat anymore; it’s plant-based or grown in a lab now. We don’t get any of that meat today either, at least I don’t in my package. I can only assume the packages are all more or less the same. They used to come with notes from the charity: *Together, society is stronger*. I guess I can’t complain if they sneak trash in with our supplies. This package doesn't have a note, which is fine by me—until I dwell on it too long and find the lack of any communication with us unsettling.

They tried to hand them out in the beginning. People crowded and stormed the trucks. They say some were trampled to death. Now the trucks are armored, and they never stop. They roll through, launching packages at the sides of the street. No one knows when they’ll come. They don’t keep a schedule. It’s safer that way—for them. They also don’t keep the same route. I guess that’s better for us. The Ungovernables would have taken control of those routes long ago. This way at least gives the rest of us a chance. 

It’s sometime in the late morning by the time I hear the trucks coming. I withdraw from my hideout. Eagerness erases some of my caution, and I find myself running along the uneven sidewalks, ducking behind mounds of brick and plaster. All around me I catch glimpses of others doing the same. 

We look like a pack of wolves, I think, but I know we’re not coordinated like that. Wolves synchronize for their hunt. But this isn’t a hunt. This is scavenging. The rules are simple: snatch something as fast as you can and then get out of the way, retreating to hoard your prize from the other vultures. 

I spy a package just ahead, two car frames up. I race to reach it, hunched over, staying as low as I can, moving as fast as I can in my bowed position. The package is a bulging white envelope. I reach out for it as another hand reaches around the corner. 

I jerk my face up at the same time the girl in front of me jerks hers up. Her eyes grow wide, her mouth drops open, just as startled to see me as I am to see her. I’ve already started to reach for my knife without thinking. Now my hand freezes. She’s not an Ungovernable—they don’t hesitate. Her jet-black hair is cropped short. Her eyes are deep brown, desperate, and fearful. She’s younger than I am, probably no older than sixteen. All of this I register and process in an instant, without even intending to do so. 

I don’t hesitate now. I reach out and snatch the package. Her hand lurches forward after I’ve pulled mine back. She is too late. I feel bad for her. I know she is hungry. I’m hungry. She still has time to find another package. She will find another package. I tell myself all this as I turn and flee like a coward. I know she won’t pursue me. I saw it in her eyes. Besides that, why risk a fight when it’s safer and smarter to find another package? 

Teenage girl I found on the street in West Baltimore, I don’t know your name, but if you ever read this, I’m sorry. 

She’ll find another package, I assure myself again. I could look for a second package as well, but I don’t. I play it safe and head back to guard my haul. Rule number three: it’s not worth the risk of losing what you already have in the pursuit of more. I make it back to my gas station intact. Home. That’s what this place is to me now. 

In the back room I take inventory of my spoils. This gives some indication of how long they plan to leave us between food trucks. Food makes up the bulk of the package with thirty packets, wrapped separately in cellophane, the kind of food that only needs water to hydrate. That’s enough to last fifteen days, more if I cut at least some of the packets in half. The last food truck came twenty days ago, the longest they’ve taken to come. I’ll have to ration this. 

Besides the food, there are a few packages of soap and some toothpaste, though I can’t risk washing more than my hands in this cold weather. There’s no heat, at least not in the old buildings with oil furnaces. I can’t even heat my food with anything more than the lukewarm water that comes from the “hot” faucet in the bathroom. 

That’s rule number two: no fire. Fire is a signal that means only one of two things: one, you’re new to this, and that puts a target on your back, or two, there’s a riot, and that’s prime ground for looting or robbing. Either one will attract the Ungovernables. That rule, at least, I didn’t learn the hard way. 

Before coming here, I wandered from place to place. People huddled together in groups then. It gave us a sense of safety in numbers. Sometimes I miss those early days, not as much as I miss my old life, of course, but as chaotic and frightening as the adjustment period was, at least I wasn’t alone. 

I tuck everything back in the envelope and prop the package under the desk with me. In case of emergency, I will take it with me—that and this journal.",2,1745859771.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

TW for SA, violence, and abuse

I (17FTM) have an ex (17M), I'll call him Z, who treated me horribly in our relationship. We were together for about 6 months.

I first confessed to him about 3 months before we actually started dating. He got into a relationship with my best friend (18enby), who I'll call N, shortly after I confessed. I didn't want to interfere with their relationship at all, so I kept quiet about my feelings.

A month or so goes by and Z mentions in passing that his relationship with N is an open relationship. I know this was mutually agreed to by both Z and N, but looking back I'm not sure if N was pressured into this at all. I don't really think much of this at that time.

That is, until Z tells me that he has feelings for me a week later. I'm surprised, given that he turned me down last time because he ""only liked women"", but I offer to test the waters a bit with him given that I still had feelings myself.

A few days later, we're at my house in the basement, and Z tries to kiss me. I'm fine with that part of it, but he got really handsy really fast. I didn't know what to do, because we never got the chance to talk about boundaries regarding this kind of thing nor did he ask me if it was okay.

I had a past relationship with another person (I'll call them D) who sexually assaulted me multiple times. This has left me with a very skewed view on romance and relationships, which I am working on in therapy.

I felt honestly helpless in this situation with Z, like I had felt before, but I thought maybe that was just my trauma speaking. We ended up sleeping together and there was no protection involved (although I have a birth control implant, which Z knew about)

I had a lot of pain and bleeding as a result of this, because I have endometriosis (which Z also knew about). He was very rough on me, and as a disabled person I couldn't really do much about it.

Every time after that when Z would be over at my house, he would get increasingly more risky with his behavior. He once started licking my feet without asking, which was really fucking weird. Every time I saw him, we would sleep together. I was hardly ever asked what I wanted, but he had no problem demanding I do certain things and saying that I would be hotter if I was born male. It made me really dysphoric, because it's not something I can change — obviously I wish I was born male but that's not a choice of mine.

Z also made a variety of sexual comments about my twin sister, asking what underwear she wore and if she had ever been with a man. My sister is a lesbian.

Z constantly made me feel like a burden because of my disability. He would make fun of me for using my wheelchair, take my crutches or cane, and one time he completely ignored me when I passed out in the basement. I don't remember much of that situation but he was scrolling tiktok on his phone when I passed out and still scrolling when I came to. I don't know how long it was.

I broke up with Z after I did finally gather up the courage to tell him I didn't want anything sexual. He was upset by this. He threatened suicide and played the victim. He was removed from all the discord servers of my friend group and we pretty much all cut contact with him, including N and my sister.

About 6 more months pass and I incidentally end up sitting next to Z at school. I was freaked out, but he started talking to me like nothing was wrong. I don't know why, but I played along, even unblocking his phone number at the end of the conversation. He immediately starts blowing up my phone with ""funny"" instagram reels and tells me he still loves me. I should have blocked him again then, but I didn't. It's my mistake, but if you've ever been manipulated you know it feels. You feel like you can fix them. I couldn't fix him.

At some point he ""coincidentally"" runs into me at a local coffee shop. He tries to talk to me, but I'm studying, so we mostly just sat there. I'm not sure if it was actually a coincidence at this point but I can't prove it either way.

I eventually get overwhelmed by Z constantly reaching out and tell him that I need space. He doesn't really listen. He reaches out a few days later saying he's going into a depressive episode and needs help. I tell him that he needs to talk to his parents or therapist and that I am not qualified to help. I offer him resources. He refuses everything and says he just wants me.

I don't respond. We don't speak again until this morning, when N texted me a screenshot of Z flirting with another member of our friend group. The man Z was flirting with is openly straight. N tries to get him to block Z. I'm not sure if he did.

I talked to N about it this morning, and N reveals more details to me about Z taking advantage of them as well. I'm obviously disgusted, and am doing my best to comfort N while trying to think of what to say to Z.

I eventually text Z a long message, but it boils down to ""what you've done is horrible and you need to stay away from me and the friend group"". Z responds with ""alright"" as a one word answer.

At this point I'm considering legal action. I really can't deal with this anymore and I want at least some sort of restraining order. He sends me into panic just seeing him in the hallway. I know it might ruin his life, though. And I don't know if I'm ready for that, I guess. I would make sure N is okay with it before I reported him, as they're equally as involved as I am. I just would like advice on whether this is actually an appropriate reaction and how to go about it if it is.

1ka0j0x,https://www.reddit.com/r/CatAdvice/comments/1ka0j0x/neighbours_cat_is_a_little_too_friendly/,Neighbours cat is a little too friendly,"I just moved into a new place and one of my neighbour’s cats will try and get into my house through any open window or door. 

To be clear, I like cats a lot and this one is very sweet but there’s a reason I don’t own my own cat and it’s because it’s not convenient for my life right now as I work long hours and have friends with pet hair allergies. I didn’t grow up with cats or dogs so have no experience handling them and I’m quite nervous petting them as I can’t read the body language well, I’m afraid of being scratched or bitten.
I can tell this cat is very well loved by its owners and it has a tracker and phone number on its collar so I don’t know why it’s so desperate for attention from me and I don’t see it happen to the other neighbours. 

It will run up to my car as I pull up to the drive way and will try and climb into the car when I get out. I go to hang up my washing in the garden and it will see me from a window and literally sprint across the fence line and into my house and refuse to leave. It jumps on my counters and licks scraps off plates, even things I’m sure aren’t good for it. 

It can’t be lured out with canned tuna anymore, it knows my tactics and also I don’t like feeding other people’s cats in case it has medical issues /allergies so that was my last resort. It doesn’t eat the tuna anyway, just sniffs it and walks away. Playing kitten noises worked for a while, now that doesn’t work and I feel bad doing it. I tried putting coffee grounds outside so it won’t like the smell but it’s obviously not working.

I’m at a loss, people in my life our telling me to just pick it up and carry it outside but im sure if it doesn’t scratch me it will just run inside again. If it was just coming over for a pet and just sat politely in my kitchen it would be fine but it causes mayhem knocking over plates and I can’t leave it unattended. 

My only theory is that the old owners must have fed it/played with it and this was its ‘second house’ maybe. The old owners came round and commented that the cat used to play with their dog so maybe it can still smell the dog and wants to play? Either way I don’t want to encourage it to keep coming over. Any tips for making it not like my house as much? 

TO BE CLEAR: I will not be doing anything that would upset/hurt the cat, I want it to stop coming so much out of its own volition.

But in dating, it can trip you up.

Let’s say you met someone over coffee/ lunch/ dinner (honestly, one of the worst ways to meet).  
They say, *""I enjoyed meeting you,""* and you felt it too.  
Yet later, there’s little to no engagement.  
Confused? Wondering why the words didn’t match the actions?

Here’s the thing: most people find it hard to say, *""I don't think this will go anywhere.""*  
It's easier to say something polite and move on.  
So instead of overthinking, **watch the actions**.  
**Are they walking the talk?**  
**Are you?**

Words are cheap. Behavior isn't.

**Another tip if you’re serious about finding someone:**  
Stop doing coffee, lunch, or dinner first meets.  
Instead, suggest an activity.  
  
It could be something as simple (and mundane) as a walk. Yes, even if it's too hot or too cold.

If it's hot, wake up early at 5:30 AM.  
If it’s cold, bundle up and meet maybe a bit later.  
No excuses - because finding your person is worth a little discomfort.

1ka0ifz,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpainAuxiliares/comments/1ka0ifz/jobs_that_arent_tutoring/,Jobs that AREN'T tutoring,"I'm awaiting my acceptance for this year and hoping for either Pais Vasco or Madrid. I was wondering if anyone had any experience finding a job that was not tutoring. I know it's unrealistic, as my level of Spanish is at about B2, but I am someone who actually enjoys working and staying busy. I was hoping to find something like a coffee shop or a touristy place. Or, I was hoping to add more to my resume by finding extra work at a firm related to my degree. Any advice or experience helps!

And if I'm completely wrong and our work visa doesn't cover that, please correct me. I got the impression that we can find other work. Thanks!",2,1745859444.0,SpainAuxiliares,3,1.0,False

Having side effects.,"My dosage went from 2.5 to 5 mg 3 weeks ago. Near the beginning of the second week, my family was hit with a stomach bug and I too was having stomach issues but not vomiting. They all seemed to get better within a day but I just kept getting back and forth worse and better and worse and better. Started my third dose on Saturday and I'm still having liquid versus solid coming out, and every time I eat, I get bloated very quickly, even if it's just the bite of a sandwich. I try to drink at least 64 oz of water a day, I am also on Vyvanse for my ADHD. I drink coffee but I feel like I have to stop because when I do that, it makes it worse. I'm curious to know if anyone is similar to me and if they found ways to deal with the side effects of bloating, cramping and diarrhea without going overboard on taking Imodium. I did read a couple days ago that taking a fiber supplement will help. The positive is my weight loss is going down and I'm almost 20 lb down now in a matter of 7 weeks. My muscle mass still seems steady and my hydration based on my scale says that I'm still hydrated but on the lower end. Will upping my water intake to about 96 oz help? I don't want to lower the dosage because I like the weight loss however I didn't expect this halfway through this month's dose upgrade and I'm wondering if the stomach bug to hit my family is what started it. Looking for advice, and I understand this is not medical advice and I'm not asking for that, just any advice from people who have gone through a similar experience that would be very helpful.

1ka0gqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1ka0gqu/delve_into_appliance_sliders_by_animalgifts_is/,Delve Into Appliance Sliders by Animal-Gifts: Is This the Ultimate Kitchen Gadget Review?,"The Animal-Gifts B0C287T9N7 Appliance Sliders for Kitchen was a surprising discovery in my never-ending quest for organizing my countertop gadgets. Being someone who constantly tinkers in the kitchen, I needed a solution that made moving heavy appliances like my air fryer or mixer a breeze. Testing these appliance sliders in my daily kitchen routine gave me quite a perspective—there’s a lot to love, but also a few quirks to consider.

**Compact and Thoughtful Design**

The first thing that caught my eye was how small and discreet these sliders are. Measuring just 0.25 x 0.25 inches, they don’t add bulk or ruin the aesthetic of my appliances. Their round shape and silver color kept the look clean and subtle, fitting perfectly under every kitchen device I tried them with. Applying them was simple enough too—self-adhesive backing made it a three-step job: clean, peel, and stick. Since I tested them on a variety of surfaces, including my hardwood countertop, tiled backsplash, and even some carpeted areas, they impressed me by sticking firmly without budging.

**Pluses**

- Compact and hardly noticeable under appliances.  
- Self-adhesive is strong and easy to attach.  
- Works across multiple surfaces like tile, hardwood, and carpet.

[Check Animal-Gifts B0C287T9N7 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0c287t9n7/)

**Performance and Everyday Usability**

Using these sliders felt like unlocking a new kitchen superpower. I no longer have to awkwardly lift or struggle to push my espresso machine or rice cooker around. The PTFE (Teflon) material ensures smooth gliding with minimal effort. I even tested rotating my toaster and blender 360 degrees while they were on the sliders—it was smooth sailing every time. Plus, keeping the height of the appliance slightly raised has the added benefit of keeping the bottom safe from spills or pesky water splashes.

On occasions when I was in a rush, I appreciated how these sliders helped me slide things to the side without feeling like I was putting extra effort into scratching my granite kitchen top. However, I did notice that excessive dragging led to a faint noise on certain surfaces like glass, which felt like a minor tradeoff for the convenience they bring.

**Wide Range of Applications**

The versatility of these sliders can’t be overlooked. They’re sold as a set of 24 pieces, and I found myself sticking them everywhere—on pressure cookers, coffee machines, even utility devices like my humidifier. The adhesive function worked surprisingly well on surfaces like metal and plastics, making them useful in scenarios beyond the kitchen. I could even use them on heavy lamps in my living room!

**Good Points**

- Wide application for countless appliances.  
- Makes appliances easier to move and prevents countertop scratches.  
- Cost-effective with a full pack to use on multiple gadgets.

**Areas for Improvement**

As much as I enjoyed the convenience, I encountered a few small hitches. The adhesive is strong, but removal wasn’t necessarily easy, especially if you stick them on wrong and need to adjust placement. I unpeeled one while trying to realign the slider, and it took a bit of effort—and some residue cleaner—to properly fix the spot. Another limitation I noticed was with heavier solid tools; pushing my oversized stand mixer required significantly more effort compared to lighter gadgets, as the sliders occasionally stuttered while gliding.

- Adhesive removal can leave residue on certain surfaces.  
- Heavier appliances may not glide as effortlessly.  
- Minor squeaking noises on highly smooth surfaces like glass.  

**Direct Competitors**

Comparing these sliders to alternative solutions like felt pads, silicone adhesive stickers, or rolling trays offered some striking contrasts. While rolling trays are excellent for unidirectional movement, they tend to be bulkier and take up more space. Felt pads, though smooth, are usually not self-adhesive and don't offer the durability these sliders boast. Silicone pads share a few similarities, but they tend to limit movement due to their friction-heavy material, especially on tiled surfaces.

The primary advantage of these sliders was how seamlessly they stuck on varying appliance materials and allowed multidirectional movement, something that outperformed rolling trays. However, silicone pads do have an edge for noise reduction and are slightly less likely to leave behind sticky residue.

**True Value**

Considering the practical utility and the overall performance, I found the value proposition of these sliders to be spot on. Buying something like sliding trays for each appliance would have cost me significantly more, but this 24-piece pack gave me the freedom to outfit almost every device in my kitchen at a fraction of the price. While it’s not a perfect solution for truly heavy-duty use, it’s a game-changer for small to mid-sized kitchen gadgets.

I’m mildly hypomanic right now, and feel like I only “need” 5-6hrs of sleep a night instead of my regular 8-9. After about six hours I wake up feeling rested and wired like I’ve already had multiple cups of coffee. 

However, my brain still needs its 8hrs a night of sleep, and if I let myself get out of bed after the six hours multiple days in a row I’m guaranteed to get a migraine. I have to force myself to keep trying to sleep, and only manage very light sleep (dreaming, but aware that I’m asleep and what position I’m in on my bed etc) for those last two hours, and it feels like such a waste of time.

If you're considering launching a business in the Mile High City, there's more to it than just having a killer idea and a laptop at a coffee shop. Proper *corporate formation and structuring* are **critical** to laying a strong foundation for success — and avoiding legal disasters down the road. 🚀

Here's a quick lowdown I found super helpful:

✅ **Entity Selection Matters:** Should you be an LLC? Corporation? Partnership? Each choice has its own legal, tax, and operational implications. Choose wisely — or you could be setting yourself up for unnecessary headaches later.

✅ **Governance Documents Are NOT Optional:** Think of your bylaws, operating agreements, and shareholder agreements as the rulebooks for your business. Without them, even small misunderstandings can turn into major battles. 🥊

✅ **Securities Law Compliance Isn't Just for Wall Street:** Even issuing stock to a friend or a silent investor can trigger securities laws. Skip the legal formalities and you might find yourself in very hot water with regulators. 🔥

✅ **Getting it Right Early Saves You Later:** Smart structuring now = avoiding chaos during fundraising, mergers, or selling your company in the future.

[Linden Law Partners](https://lindenlawpartners.com/corporate-formation-and-structuring-in-denver-colorado/) (a Denver-based law firm specializing in startups and businesses) breaks this down beautifully and really emphasizes how crucial it is to work with experienced counsel when setting up your company. They literally *help you build it right from the ground up*.

**Moral of the story?** Don't DIY your corporate structure just because you watched a few YouTube videos. 📺 Call a pro, save yourself future migraines.

If anyone wants, I can share more on what specific steps they recommend too. Happy to help!

the past year but more severely the last 6 months atleast a few times a day i get bad chest pain, shortness of breath yk the usual and i
- automatically assume that im having a heart attack
- the pain gets worse as i focus on it and i hage the symptoms all written down in my notes app to copy and paste inti google or chatgbt multiple times a day and read the same thing over and over which just convinces me im having a heart attack more
- have to leave wherever i am and go home and turn off the lights and lay flat on my back to “save myself”
- often call my closest friend to reassure me that im not dying 
- make doctors appointments to get checked for heart issues but cancel like an hour before because i get too anxious to go 

(this is not jsut for heart attack i also think i’m dying when my veins go a bit too purple and my lips get pale)

i also get worried people are listening to me so i have to cover up the slits in my door and window and be very quiet and have the lights off so they can’t tell im awake and hyper focus on people’s conversations outside my dorm room to make sure they aren’t talking about me but usually i still end up believing theyre talking about me and get more panicked which leads me to chest pains or vertigo or nausea which makes me think i’m dying

i also was convinced i was bleeding internally for a few months bc i kept throwing up coffee grounds but i smoke a lot so it was probably just that.

i don’t know if this is just really bad health anxiety but i can’t stop checking my same symptoms and if i have the symptom and dont check it it’s like i don’t feel safe and any moment i could die

1ka0dx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SandalsResorts/comments/1ka0dx0/sandals_barbados_review_positive/,Sandals Barbados Review- (Positive!),"My husband and I just returned from Sandals Barbados on Friday after a lovely 5 night stay and I wanted to give my review after being truly nervous to go reading all of the overwhelmingly negative reviews about the resort. For reference this was our third Sandals experience (we have stayed previously at Royal Bahamaian and Ochi):

ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE  
Transport to and from the resort was so easy and painless. From touching down on the runway to feet in the sand was only 1 hour! The van from the airport to the resort was small as there were only 4 people (2 couples) arriving at our time. Once we arrived to the resort we were handed a mimosa and after a few minutes were escorted to our room. We had a similarly easy experience with our departing transport though it was a much larger caravan. Check-out was also simple, our bags were picked up a few hours before the shuttle left and other than turning in our keys by 11 we just needed to arrive to the shuttle on time. Easy-peasy.

ROOM  
We booked the lowest tier room on the Barbados side- Caribbean Deluxe. It was a modest size, though plenty big for what we needed. It also had a nice balcony overlooking one of the smaller/quieter pools on the Barbados side and just a few steps away from Cafe Parisienne for sweet treats and coffees. The room itself could use some updating, but I find that to be pretty standard for the other resorts we have visited (and we have booked Butler level rooms at our two previous Sandals visits). We had some issues with the shower- one of the two spouts only dripped out water so it did not offer great water pressure. Also the spout for the tub was pulling away from the wall by about an inch... it still worked but definitely could use some maintenance. However, our room was always serviced and restocked with towels/drinks/soaps etc. at the end of each day. The air conditioning and ceiling fan worked fine and considering we did not book a vacation to stare at the walls of our room for 6 days, I was not at all inconvenienced by the small details.

FOOD/BEVERAGE  
I thought the food was as good or better than other Sandals locations. We are foodies from outside NYC so obviously this food does not compare to fine dining in the states, however it is solid, filling and full of variety which is what we were looking for. We had breakfasts at Greenhouse, La Parisienne, American Tavern (Buffet), and Spices (Buffet). All served your standard breakfast fare- nothing spectacular but solid and filling. We enjoyed the Jerk Shack for lunch most days but also ate at Neptune's by the Infinity Pool and had pizza from Dino's. The main standouts for dinner were Butch's Chophouse, Soy and Bombay, though we also really enjoyed Chi and Greenhouse. We were less impressed with La Parisienne for dinner but did enjoy the escargot. As always, the drinks were plentiful and I never experienced a long wait for a drink from any of the bars on either the Barbados or the Royal side. We also did not have any trouble getting reservations for the restaurants we wanted to try.

STAFF  
Most of the negative reviews I had read for this resort were about rude staff members and I think that could not have been farther from the truth! Almost every single staff member we encountered from transport, to check-in, to the bars and dining, maintenance workers, gardeners (the list goes on) greeted us kindly, were helpful in assisting us with whatever we needed, or just friendly with a smile. Maybe a handful of times there was a staff member who was there to do their job and didn't provide any ""extras"", but that didn't really bother us. 

GROUNDS  
The resort was beautifully maintained, though it was pretty noisy in certain locations due to maintenance/construction. I understand that can be frustrating to some, but there were always areas of the resort that were quieter to retreat if the construction noises became too much. The flowers and foliage were beautifully kept and everywhere you looked was something interesting and new to see. The pools were clean and there was great variety of quieter locations and more rowdy areas depending on your mood. Our favorite was the infinity pool on the Royal side, though it was difficult to find chairs with umbrellas on most days. The beach was not big but it was beautiful. We did not swim in the ocean because it looked a little rough but we did walk the beach and thought it was very picturesque. Also, the two resorts (Barbados and Royal Barbados) are literally right next to each other- you couldn't even tell which side you were on most of the time without a map. Despite this, the entire area was easy to navigate and flat so simple to walk and get wherever you needed to go. 

To sum it up, we were really baffled by the barrage of negative reviews we read prior to our trip and we were thrilled we did not let them influence our choice to vacation at Sandals Barbados. Of the three locations we visited this was our favorite! If you are thinking of booking I would say do it- go with an open mind and ignore the little things. No vacation will ever be ""perfect"" but we loved our time in Barbados!

As someone who can’t function without their morning coffee, I’ve gone through my share of coffee makers, from drip machines to pods, but this French press really stands out. With its stainless steel finish and double-walled design, I could tell it was built to endure some serious caffeine demands.

**Design and Build Quality**

The sleek, silver exterior immediately caught my eye when I unboxed it. Constructed from 304-grade stainless steel, this coffee press feels luxurious and sturdy. The double-walled insulation isn’t just for aesthetics—it works! I left coffee sitting in the press for a bit while dealing with morning chaos (read: kids and their cereal disasters), and when I came back, it was still piping hot. I also appreciated its slim dimensions, making it a space-saver in my already cluttered kitchen.

**Brewing Performance**

I’ve had my fair share of bad French press experiences—coffee grounds sneaking into my cup and a pressing mechanism so flimsy I wondered if it would eject the coffee instead of brewing it. This wasn’t the case here. The four-layered filtration system ensured my coffee was rich but free of those pesky grounds. For someone who leans toward coarse-ground beans, this was a game-changer. The manual operation adds a touch of ritual to the process; honestly, it felt much more personal and rewarding than hitting a machine’s button.

**Versatility and Usage**

If you're looking for a coffee maker you can take on the road—this is it. Its 34-ounce capacity isn’t just perfect for lazy weekend mornings at home, but also for camping trips. Yes, I tested it outdoors! This French press performed like a champ under less-than-ideal conditions. No electricity? No problem. Just boiling water and my ground coffee were all I needed. Plus, it’s not just for coffee. My partner decided to whip up some loose-leaf tea in it, and it worked just as brilliantly.

**Strengths**

- Double-wall insulation retains heat effectively.  
- A heavy-duty construction that feels built to last.  
- The included extra filters are thoughtful and extend the product’s lifespan.
- Filters out coffee grounds effectively for brewing perfection.

**Areas for Improvement**

- While the stainless steel looks premium, it’s a fingerprint magnet.  
- The lid can feel a bit tight during the first few uses, but it loosens up over time.  
- Its weight, while reassuring for durability, makes it less backpack-friendly for camping.

**Alternative Products**

During my research, I checked out a few other French presses to see how this one stacks up. The Bodum Chambord is a classic choice but doesn’t feature the double-wall insulation, meaning your coffee could cool down more quickly. Another contender, the Coffee Gator French Press, boasts a similar stainless steel finish, but it’s bulkier and a bit pricier. The standout for the Utopia Kitchen model is its combination of stylish design and practical features, all at a competitive price.

**Value for Money**

Whether you’re a frequent coffee drinker or just someone looking for a reliable brewing method, this French press packs a lot of punch for the price. It’s not the most expensive option, but it feels like it could be. Between its sturdy design, efficient brewing process, and high level of portability, it proves to be worth spending your money on. I haven’t had to worry about replacing parts yet, thanks to the extra filters, and maintenance is seamless.

1ka0cgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ka0cgt/time_looped_chapter_104/,Time Looped (Chapter 104),"At precisely one minute to twelve, Will’s entire group was standing at the top of the school’s staircase. They had been warned that leveling up on their own risked getting them wiped out, yet had chosen to do it, nonetheless. It had forced them to skip a lot of school classes, but working together, they each had managed to gain five levels in addition to their token boost. Will himself had increased his rogue and crafter classes to level three and the knight to level two. Alex was going to have to use mirror copies on this one.

“Ready?” Will asked, looking at the others.

“For fuck’s sake!” Jace walked by him and opened the door with a swing.

*Show off!* Will followed, keeping his hand on his mirror fragment.

At first, it didn’t seem like anyone else had arrived. The rooftop appeared completely empty.

The view was magnificent, as always, revealing the rest of the city. For a moment, it almost seemed like just a normal day. There were no mirrors or traces of weirdness that mixed in with the bustle of modernity. The moment the door closed behind the entire group, everything changed.

“I told you not to go hunting,” the acrobat said. She was dressed in her usual biker outfit. Behind her stood five others. For the most part, they were older than Will’s group, though there was one teen—a tall lanky girl in a fancy high-school uniform that didn’t seem at all familiar.

“You didn’t think we’d really be stupid not to?” Helen stepped forward.

“Let it go,” Spenser said. “It’s their first alliance. Besides, we need them.”

Frowns appeared on several faces, indicating that this wasn’t the well knit group of people they presented themselves to be. Everyone was here due to their own self-interest in the goal of defeating an enemy that outmatched them in so many ways.

“Fair enough.” The biker girl shrugged. “It was just a suggestion. Besides, it’s your loss, not ours.”

“Why do you think that?” Helena asked.

“You get one temp skill token for every day you go without killing wolves. Since you’ve already done that, you won’t be getting any.”

A wave of regret drenched Will. He was the one who had convinced the others to level up as much as they could. Jace had backed him, of course, and Alex had remained neutral, but in retrospect, maybe it wasn’t the correct decision. If skill tokens were anything like class tokens, people didn’t have any obligation to use them right off. People could gather several of them before taking advantage.

“Well, what’s done is done.” The biker shrugged. “Now let’s get on to the next part. Goals and introductions.”

“Before that, should we be staying here?” Will asked. “What if the archer takes us out?”

“Starting areas act like safe zones. It would be too boring otherwise. We’re all given a chance to extend our loops and prepare. The only way to get yourself killed is to *leave* your zone and go wolf chasing.” She smirked as she said that. “But as you’ve seen, even then you’ll be mostly safe. No one wants to tip their hand early on. Not even archer.”

Will clenched his free fist. All that could have been explained on the message board. Other than Spenser, this was the first time he met his allies and had already come to the conclusion that he didn’t like them.

Half of them were outright bored, staring at the city, while the biker and a fat, balding man in black jeans and a Metallica t-shirt were staring them down in utter disdain.

“So, our goal,” the woman continued. “The alliance exists to take down archer. Short and sweet. After that, it’s every person on our own. However, there’s one more thing that I didn’t mention earlier.” She paused, her eyes moving from one person to the next, as if evaluating them. “We’re also to help each other complete hidden quests until that happens.”

There it was. Everyone in Will’s party suspected it. There was no reason why they were so intent on attracting the group if it wasn’t for the challenge requirements. Clearly, they considered the children weak and inexperienced. Having to babysit them was undoubtedly a lot more cumbersome than trying to execute their plan on their own. Yet, there was no way of going around the rules of eternity.

“The more skills we get, the better shape we’ll be in,” the biker continued. “Plus, the archer isn’t the only danger out there.”

As the woman spoke, Spenser checked his watch. It seemed casual enough, but Will knew that he was doing more than checking the time. From what he remembered, the item let him know the location of hidden prizes and enemies.

“And now, introductions. There’s no point in going by names, so we’ll call each other by class. It’s more useful and easier to remember.”

“So, you’re the bitch?” Jace asked.

Will would have lied if the thought hadn’t crossed his mind, but he wasn’t as suicidal as Jace. Tensing up, he prepared for a response. If anyone had said that to Helen, she’d have snapped the unfortunate’s spine in two. There was no reason to think that the biker would act differently.

“Cute.” The smile didn’t leave the woman’s face. “Next time you say that, I’ll tear your head off.”

The combination of words made Will feel sudden pain.

“I’m the acrobat,” the biker said. “And as long as the alliance stands, I give the orders.”

In other words, she was the boss. Looper hierarchies still remained unclear, but it was a good guess that she had to be the strongest among the bunch.

“Since you already know me, I’ll go next,” Spenser joined in. “I’m the martial artist.”

“Don’t we get some skills explanation?” Will interrupted the flow. “Like strengths, weaknesses and the like?”

“Why?” the acrobat asked, amused. “Even if you understand what we’re saying, you won’t remember it. You’ll have lots of chances to see our skills first hand, provided you stay alive long enough.”

She turned to her left, looking at the girl.

“I’m the summoner,” the girl said with a slight bow. “Very pleased to meet you.”

There was no trace of an accent as she spoke, but it was a safe bet that she was foreign. There was a good chance that she was an exchange student or a tourist passing through the city, although why would someone go to this place remained mind-boggling. The vest and skirt of her uniform were a combination of deep blue and red squares. Straight cyan sleeves and a perfect collar, complete with tie, were visible underneath. The ensemble was completed by cyan calf-length socks and polished black shoes with actual buckles.

“Sage,” the balding man said.

Everyone on Will’s side blinked and looked intently at him, as if that way they’d find some clue that he was telling the truth.

“It’s just a class name,” the man flowed.

“The druid,” the final member of the acrobat’s party said.

She seemed like a kindly old woman in her early sixties that one would imagine working in a store or chatting away in a coffee shop. Upon a closer look, it was apparent that all joy and desire for life had been drained from her, just like the beige set of clothes she was wearing.

“The rogue,” Will said in response.

“We know who you are,” the sage smirked. “We’ve been watching you since you passed the tutorial. How did you cheat your way through that on the first go?”

“It’s not the time,” a sharp edge appeared in the acrobat’s voice. “He’s right, though. We know all about you. That’s why you were invited in the first place. Now, since we’re all set, let’s make it official.”

In near unison, everyone from the woman’s party took out their mirror fragments and tapped on them. Not wanting to be left behind, Will took his out as well.

 

**FORM ALLIANCE**

**\[There are better options.\]**

 

The boy froze. It was natural to assume that some sort of fragment activation would be necessary to form an alliance. What he wasn’t prepared for was the guide’s advice. So far, everyone in his group had agreed that the alliance was their best option to figure out things quickly, and their only option was to take down the archer. If that were the case, why did the guide suggest differently?

Around him, his classmates tapped their fragments. As they did, their classes flashed on the reflective surface before quickly fading beneath the message.

“Something wrong?” Spenser asked Will.

For two long seconds, Will kept on staring at the fragment.

“No,” he said at last, and tapped the message.

The words instantly faded away. Already he felt regret for his decision, but it had to be this away. Anything else and the phase would end there.

“Perfect.” The acrobat clapped. “Now we wait.”

“For what?” Helen asked.

“Oh, right. It’s your first one.” The acrobat stretched. “I told you that the starting areas are safe zones, right? Well, that’s not entirely true. People of the area can still kill each other without penalty. Also, the restriction only applies until noon, give or take. Once it’s over, this entire city becomes one big free for all.”

“Remember the goblin invasion at the end of your tutorial challenge?” Spenser asked. “It’s like that. Only all four factions get to join in.”

Droplets of cold sweat appeared on Will’s forehead. The goblin invasion remained the most devastating thing he had experienced so far. The creatures were weak, but came in such high numbers that every moment was a constant battle for survival. It was thanks to the combined efforts of his group, and considerable help from Danny, that he had managed to succeed on the first go. If what their allies were saying was true, this time it would be champions pouring in, each with as many skills as the looped themselves.

“Don’t look glum, though,” the acrobat chuckled. “We’re here to protect you. Besides, it’ll also be our first treat of the day.”

The sage and the druid drew weapons from their mirror fragments.

“I know you were told that all challenges during this phase were hidden, but that’s not entirely true.” The acrobat made her way to the edge of the roof. “Each loop, right at the start of the battle royale, three challenges are revealed to us.”

Immediately, Will scrolled to the map section of his mirror fragment. Surely enough, countdown timers had appeared beneath three of the challenge markers. Two of them were too far away to matter, but the third was less than a thousand feet away.

“Don’t bother,” the acrobat said, seeing Will’s reaction. “Or do.” She drew a chain sword from her inventory. “The challenge locations can be anywhere, and we’ll only know once the chaos begins. The main thing is to stick by.”

Having twenty seconds until all hell broke loose wasn’t reassuring. At the same time, it didn’t seem that the woman knew about his special ability. The eye was a lot more useful than what Danny had made it out to be. Was he the only one who knew?

Will looked at Spenser. The man was focusing entirely on his watch. That had to be a special skill or item. Maybe a bit of both.

“What about the spear fucker?” Jace asked. “He was also part of some alliance. Will those guys fight us?”

“Not if you do what we tell you. We came to an arrangement. Archer is the sort of bastard everyone wants to take down. While we focus on that, we’ll be good. Just don’t start any fights.”

Will felt the phone in his pocket ping. The noise made several people look in his direction, but no one reacted more than that. The boy pretended nothing had happened when his phone pinged again. And again. It got so worse that he took it out just to stop the noise.

Ten messages had stacked up, all of them from Alex. Instinctively, Will glanced at the goofball. His friend looked back. He definitely wasn’t holding anything. At the same time, he had been remarkably quiet this entire time. Ever since Will knew him, he had never seen him not say a word, especially in a tense situation.

Uncertain what was going on, Will looked at the phone again. All the text contained one single emoticon: a duck.

*Oh, shit!* Will thought.

 

**Unifying reality.**

 

A message appeared in front of Will’s eyes. The next thing he knew, glints of mirrors were visible all over the city.

First impression: a super nice staff member greeted us like we were VIPs and explained the difference between outdoor and indoor seating.
My mom (in true mom fashion) said, “Let’s sit inside, it’s too hot,” and Operation: Indoor AC Rescue was a go.

We ordered coffee and food, and boom – it landed fast, tasted great, and looked Instagram-worthy (if I was the type to click before eating, which I’m not because… hunger).
The coffee was spot-on. The food? Absolutely no complaints – except maybe that I didn’t order double.

Bonus points: the bill didn’t need a loan or a side hustle to pay off. Very decent prices for the quality.

Not a paid review, just a happy stomach and a happy mom.
If you’ve got parents to impress or just need a cozy spot to chill without burning your wallet, The Brew Room is a solid choice.

Would 100% go again. Maybe even pretend it was my idea next time.

# About Me



I'm 30M 170 cm tall and weigh about 58.4 kg (or 5'7"" and 128 lbs.) I've been running for about 5 years now. My 5K PB going in is 18:30, 10K was 40:33, and full marathon 3:38:43. The 10k time wasn’t exactly an all-in effort and set during a tempo run. The full marathon was run in some pretty tough conditions and paced a little too conservatively.



The goal for this year is to get me closer to that elusive sub 3-hour marathon time, and eventually get a shot at Boston. This half marathon was a check up of sorts to see how much progress I could make, explore what training works for me, and to run a race where I felt like I ran to my full potential.



# Training



I signed up on New Year's Day. I was reticent of getting ahead of myself, as I had just gotten back to consistent training in December and the back half of last year was marred by a litany of issues. After dealing with an overuse injury from my full marathon last April, I was largely sidelined for May and had to see a PT. Thankfully, this was a very good learning experience, and I found out I had fantastically weak hip flexors. It makes sense, I am seated for most of my day. After getting some exercises prescribed, I was right as rain and even PB’d a 10K a couple months later. However, travel and illness would hound me from October right up to the start of December.

&nbsp;

In terms of deciding a goal pace, I threw my 5K PB into the VDOT calculator. It spat out a pace of 4:01 / km ( 6:28 / mi.) A mixture of bemusement and shock took over. I knew what that pace felt like and thought “ain’t no way.” But I figured if the goal pace was too hard, I could always just dial it back in training. 4:10 / km (6:42 / mi) or even 4:15 / km (6:50 / mi) were still more than respectable paces.

&nbsp;

For this training block, I decided that my 85 km / week just was not going to cut it for my goals. Not having the consistent mileage to backup my pace would likely see the floor being kicked out from under me about 15-ish km in or so. So, I went down the rabbit hole and tried to see what it’d take to get there. What I arrived at was getting my consistent mileage up and adding in tempo segments to my long runs. I’d go from 85 km (52 mi) to over 100 km (62 mi.) I would ramp this up to 125 km (77 mi) as a peak week over the course of 12 weeks. For the exact structure, you can find my set-up in this [comment right here](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jfgg51/official_qa_for_thursday_march_20_2025/misu3nu/).

&nbsp;

There was one semi-serious hiccup with training. I started to feel a bit tight in my left IT band about three weeks in. I immediately pulled back and took an impromptu de-load week. I made a mistake with my plan. I had scaled up the mileage, but not the strength work needed. So, I threw in an additional hip flexor routine (about 8 mins of work) 2-3 times a week, and that took care of it.

&nbsp;

Aside from this, the other obstacle was the weather. I knew if I wanted to go the distance, I’d need to get outside as much as I could. Race conditions would be relatively cold (5 - 10C / 41F - 50F,) and getting used to breathing in cold air would be a necessity. Only, this would be one of the snowiest winters in recent memory. Shoveling really took it out of me on some days, since it was a full body cardio and strength workout to clear the driveway. The snow eventually accumulated to some 2 metres (6 feet) in my yard. I’m definitely investing in a snowblower next year.

&nbsp;

Running through the snow was a nice change of pace, as it felt more like a trail run than anything, but it also meant I wasn’t hitting my target paces easily until March. When I was stuck inside, my treadmill was limited to 8.4 mph / 13.52 kph or 7:09/mi / 4:26 /km. As a compromise I would hike the incline up to about 5-6% to compensate for those speed days.

&nbsp;

One key thing I had to learn how to do was to take my gels on at a faster running pace. My marathon pace was a positively leisurely 5:08 / km (8:16 / mi ) pace. Which was incredibly easy to take on gels at. So much so that I could basically shotgun a GU in seconds. At 4:01 / km (6:42 / mi) though, that’d be more difficult. I figured out my strategy eventually. I’d open the pack, sip some, swallow and then catch my breath. Repeating until I downed the whole thing. My gel of choice, Precision Fuel & Hydration not only had a lovely peach flavour, but I found it went down really easy even without water. Only thing… the caffeinated version doesn’t taste like this,  and instead tastes like jet fuel.

&nbsp;

In terms of key workouts, there was one I really wanted to nail about a month out from the race. A 3 x 5 km at race pace with 1 km floats in between. [You can see the detailed breakdown here](https://www.reddit.com/r/running/comments/1jh00zm/achievements_for_saturday_march_22_2025/mj60npl/), but in short, I smashed it, averaging 3:57 / km on those 5 km segments and against some awful wind at times. I felt pretty confident about being able to pull out 4:01 / km pace, assuming the winds weren’t totally brutal.

&nbsp;

Which brings me into the wind. Holy smokes, I don’t think I’ve ever been so beaten up during a block. Towards the last few weeks of training and during the taper, 45 kph winds would be a consistent theme. Dealing with them was an exercise in frustration, even on a track, where it’d be a tailwind half the time. I knew I couldn’t take the easy way out and just run on the treadmill. What would happen if the race was windy?

&nbsp;

# Pre-race
I decided on a 14 day taper for this race. The mileage reductions for week 1 would be about 85% of peak, and the following week would be down to 60% of peak. The key for this process was to maintain muscle tension. I had made this mistake for my full marathon by removing most if not all speedwork, and my legs definitely didn’t feel poppy on race day. For this taper, I was religious about keeping strides in, even for the final week of the taper. In addition to that, my final session would feature 3 x 1600 m just a little past race pace to remind my legs how to run fast for a sustained period.

&nbsp;

4 days out I decided to book a massage. This RMT was referred to me by my PT. As it so happened, he used to be a marathon runner as well, and qualified for Boston multiple times. I rarely have anyone to talk to about running, but to be able to speak to a veteran runner, that was an absolute treat. We discussed what I was going to be attempting and he decided that he wouldn't brutalize my legs too much. The main area of concern though was my lower back. That will definitely need fixing in the days and weeks to come.

&nbsp;

2 days out from the race, I started to carbload. I had tried one using 10g of carb per kilo of bodyweight in training and I learned some really good lessons from that. First… don’t take on carbs that have a lot of fat or protein. It takes a while for your gut to break them down and that’s not going to be a good time when you have to pile on more in a few hours time. Second, get most of these early in the day. Bigger breakfast, big lunch, reasonable dinner. Third, that 10g per kg of body weight load did not feel great for me, so I went down to 8.5g / kilo instead.

&nbsp;

My shakeout run the day before had some very nasty 30 kph (18mph) winds with 60 kph (37mph) gusts. The race itself would be similar to this, but milder so I decided to do some last minute mental training. I accelerated past race pace against this wind. It was tough, but mentally it was important for me to do this. I needed to know what “too hard” felt like.

&nbsp;

The night before, I never sleep well, that’s what the sleep 2 nights out is for. I couldn’t help but look at the weather. 19 kph (11 mph) with 40 kph (24 mph) gusts wasn’t bad, but I couldn’t help but feel like this would be a tough race. And boy, was it.



# Race



I woke up at 4:00 AM and had my usual breakfast, 2 PB&J bagels and about 380 mL of black coffee. No GI issues, so I was feeling good about running. I arrived about 40 minutes before start time. My warm up was an uneventful 2.9 km in the parking lot, with some 100 m strides sprinkled in to get the nervous energy out, and to prime my legs for what was to come. With about 15 minutes to go, I downed a non-caffeinated gel and made my way to my corral. Unlike last year, this time I was in the right place and not too far back. I had packed a space blanket in case it’d be cold, but with the sun out and so many people around, it wasn’t a concern at all. I guess I have a piece of a Chuck McGill cosplay now? The tongue of my right shoe was bothering me so I adjusted it. Remember this for later.

&nbsp;

My strategy going in was pretty simple. Do the pace and stick to it. Don’t try to bank time. Don’t sprint down any hills, coast, keep your strides reasonable, and save that energy for the uphills. Also, keep an eye on the pace. I know I have a bad habit of accidentally accelerating when excited or annoyed (looking at you lane 1 walkers at my local track.) There were 4 main hills in the back half of the race that I planned around. I had taken to giving them nicknames to make them easy to remember.

&nbsp;

Conditions for the day were Sunny, 5C (41f) slowly rising to about 12C (53f,) winds coming in from the northwest at 17 kph (10.5mph,) humidity at 60 %.

&nbsp;

My kit for the day was relatively standard: hat, sunglasses, sweatband, Shokz, singlet, arm sleeves, fleece gloves, 5” shorts, heart rate band, and Nike Vaporfly 3s.

&nbsp;

A couple of special additions made its way into my kit. The first, a small Canadian flag temporary tattoo on my left arm. The one closest to the heart. I won’t get too much into the reasons why this was applied, but to keep it short, I’ve been feeling a bit more patriotic as of late. The second, my socks. I had initially decided on no-show socks, but after reading about what happened in Vancouver, I decided to go for crew length blue and green, Vancouver’s colours.

&nbsp;

# 0 – 3 km “Go For Broke”
At 07:30 sharp, we were off. Going off my experience last year, I was determined to not get caught in the crowd. It was difficult once again, since it was a mixed start with marathoners and half marathoners mingled. This wasn’t the worst, since it kept me going out too fast for too long. I had Jack Daniels’ words burning in my mind, and I wasn’t keen on missing out on my goals due to some nerves in the first mile. The adrenaline was incredible, knowing that this was what the past 12 weeks was for was really something else.

The first three kilometres was a loop around Mississauga’s downtown. We’d be somewhat shielded from the windy conditions, but there were still sections where we got battered. I would just need to keep pace and from there on, Burnhamthrope road would be much more open and I could run my own race.



# 3 – 7 km Run ~~With~~ Against the Wind
Once I turned out onto Burnhamthrope Road, I knew this was going to be the actual start of the race. The wind was coming from the northwest as I was running southwest, so it was a bit of a headwind, but this section would be entirely downhill offsetting that disadvantage. Still, it was tough going. Being as short as I am, I started using some groups that were going about the same pace as me to block some of the wind. At times I found I needed to slow down. I was going well above my target pace and clawing at what would be a 10K race pace. Right after the 4 km mark I would pop my second and last gel. This time with 100mg of caffeine. This packet would save me so much more grief than I could ever describe. The little perk up kept me laser focused and the carbs would play a key role in the later stages.



# 7 – 11 km Art Class is in Session
The downhill section of the course was effectively over. Elevation changes would be the order of the day as we proceeded through the University of Toronto’s Mississauga campus. We got a mild series of mild inclines and declines, a tease of what was to come. I saw an aid station coming up just after the 9k mark and decided that this would be my only stop. I grabbed a cup, sipped some, and promptly spilled some on myself, streaking my bib with the lovely red fruit punch flavour sponsored electrolyte beverage. What a happy accident.



# 11 km – 14km That Hill Ain’t Right
From here on, the hills continued into the forested suburbs of Mississauga road. Just before the 12 km marker, the first hill hit me. It was earlier than I anticipated, at least according to the course elevation chart. To keep things fun, I gave these hills names in training. The first one I called Bobby. Bobby hill was meant to be a 2.7% grade for 700m. NOPE. Turns out he was 4.6% grade for about 600m. Dismayed, I willed my legs to keep going.

13 km was the turn-around for this race. The Mississauga half is a “there and back again” type of course. I’m used to doing hairpin turns in my neighbourhood, so that wasn’t too bad. But this is when the race got absolutely hellish. We were now facing northwest, running directly against wind gusts of 40 kph (24 mph) and with more hills to come.

The second hill was Peggy at 14 km. Peggy hill was meant to be 2.6% for 1.270 km. Well, kind of, but not really. She averaged out to be 1.5% over 2.5 km. Less grade, but more distance. It was here I had my slowest split. 4:15 / km. Going uphill that long really tested me like I’ve never been tested before. Especially in the wind I had to hang in there and just know that I would have one more “big” one then a much more mild grade coming up. Only, there’d be another spanner in the works.


# 14 km – Murphy’s Law


Just after passing the 14 km mark, Murphy’s law kicked in. My right shoe lace had come undone. I swore viciously, this had never happened during a race or time trial before. If anyone around me during that is reading this, I’m so sorry you had to hear that. I had no choice but to pull over and re-tie it. My mind flashed back to the corral. Like an anime moment it became immediately clear what happened. It wasn't just the tongue. It was the knot being slightly too tight. My flow was broken up, and for the first time feel my muscle fatigue. I went down to a knee faster than I thought I would and skinned my pinky and ring finger knuckles a bit, drawing some blood on the sidewalk. With that mishap taken care of, and some more red on my singlet, I soldiered on.



# 15km – 21.0975 km – The Gloves Are Off

It was here I had to make a decision. I had taken my gloves off to tie my shoes and stowed them in my pocket for later use, but if I wanted to make it, I couldn’t have extra fabric on me. The areas near my pockets were warming up. So, at the 15 km mark aid station, I threw out my gloves. I would’ve liked to avoid this, but I was really in the trenches at this point. In hindsight, I really didn’t need them in the first place. The sun made things plenty warm.

&nbsp;

I can’t remember if it was here or earlier, but I was breathing pretty hard by now. In an effort to catch back up, the hills of 15-16km really were getting the better of me. The better of everyone really. Especially since we were running straight into the head winds now. A fellow runner noticed how hard I was breathing and shouted out some encouragement. I returned the favour best I could. We were all in this hilly, windy hell called the Electrolit Half Marathon, and we were going to finish it.

&nbsp;

Just after the 17 km marker was the steepest hill of the lot. Cotton. A short distance to be sure, but Cotton hill would be pretty nasty. According to the elevation chart, it was 12.67% for 100 m. Nope. Turns out it was about 6.7% for 400m. To be honest, I'm not sure which would've been worse. But I didn’t have time to think about it, because the final hill was up. Hank hill. Right after Cotton. An absolutely mild 1.8% for 1.4 km. This one was more or less accurate to the elevation chart, so I was relieved that some of the intel was correct. By now I was heading northeast. The wind I was running against was now more of a crosswind. Not exactly having the wind at my back, but given the circumstances, I welcomed it.

&nbsp;

After passing the 18 km marker, this is where things started to really hurt. A side stitch started to wreak havoc on me. My tired legs were still good, likely on account of the adequate carb intake, but the stitch was demanding attention. I haven’t had a side stitch in years. Whether it was being thrown off my rhythm by the shoelace, or me pushing so hard to get back on pace against hills and wind, it didn’t matter. I had to fix this and fast. I could feel my pace slowing. I desperately tried to get control of my breath again, but to no avail. Reluctantly, I shut my mouth and started inhaling through my nose, and out through my mouth. I knew this would fix it, but at the cost of some pace. The stitch wasn’t gone entirely, but it was enough to get me through. I got myself back up to pace. I knew I just had to hold on a little longer. I was back in the shade of Mississauga’s condo towers now, and felt immensely better.

&nbsp;

I passed the 19km marker and felt the terrain even out. Sweet relief. I rounded the final corner and saw the 21 km marker. This was it. I glanced at the clock and it read 1:25. I knew that my chip time must be in the 1:24 range, so I put everything I had left into the final kick, hitting my 5K PB pace. Little did I know, that was the difference maker.



# Post-race



Upon finishing, I exchanged pleasantries with a few fellow runners. We were pace buddies at one point or another out there. We all congratulated one another, but more importantly we cursed the wind and the hills for pushing us to our limits.

It wasn’t until I got back to the car that I managed to pull up the chip time results and the actual elevation data. 1:24:56 was the final time. Given the wind, the hills, and the shoelace thing, I’m absolutely delighted with this time. I have no regrets about the race that I ran, I left everything out there on the roads, and that's all I really wanted for today.

I had my fair share of doubts going into this race. I knew the VDOT calculator was relatively accurate, but only if the training was dialed in correctly. I would worry throughout training I wasn’t doing enough speed work, or that my taper was too light, but I kept reminding myself “do you really think you know better than the dude who ran a 2:16 marathon, or the gal who did 2:25?” Trusting the process was something I had to learn to do and it’s paid off here. Now the question looming large in my mind is… can I extend this speed out and hit sub 3?

Maintaining healthy gums is crucial for overall oral wellness, and your diet plays a significant role in preventing gum disease. Many people don't realize that certain foods can dramatically increase the risk of periodontal problems, leading to inflammation, bleeding, and potential tooth loss. Understanding which foods to avoid can be a powerful strategy in protecting your oral health and preventing the progression of gum disease. Nutrition impacts every aspect of our body, and your gums are no exception to this fundamental rule.

Why Diet Matters in Gum Health

Gum disease is more than just a minor dental issue. It's a serious condition that can lead to significant health complications if left untreated. The foods we consume directly impact the bacterial environment in our mouth, either promoting healing or contributing to inflammation and decay. Research shows that certain dietary choices can either support or undermine your gum health.

Key Foods to Avoid for Healthy Gums

1. Sugary and Processed Foods

Sugar is public enemy number one when it comes to gum health. These foods create an ideal environment for harmful bacteria to thrive:

• Candy
• Soft drinks
• Processed snacks
• Baked goods

High sugar consumption feeds destructive bacteria, leading to plaque buildup and increased risk of gum inflammation. The American Dental Association reports that sugar consumption is directly linked to higher rates of periodontal disease.

2. Acidic Foods and Beverages

Acidic foods can erode tooth enamel and irritate gum tissue, making them more vulnerable to infection:

• Citrus fruits
• Tomato-based products
• Vinegar-based dressings
• Wine and carbonated drinks

These foods lower the mouth's pH balance, creating an environment where harmful bacteria can multiply rapidly.

3. Starchy and Refined Carbohydrates

Refined carbohydrates break down quickly into simple sugars, which feed harmful oral bacteria:

• White bread
• Pasta
• Potato chips
• Crackers

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

These foods stick to teeth and create a breeding ground for bacteria that contribute to gum disease.

4. Alcohol and Caffeine

Both alcohol and caffeine can cause dry mouth, reducing saliva production. Saliva is crucial for neutralizing acids and washing away food particles:

• Beer
• Wine
• Coffee
• Strong caffeinated teas

Dry mouth increases the risk of bacterial growth and gum inflammation.

5. Sticky and Chewy Foods

Foods that stick to teeth provide prolonged exposure to sugars and acids:

• Dried fruits
• Caramel
• Gummy candies
• Granola bars

These foods can remain on teeth for extended periods, increasing the risk of bacterial growth.

Healthier Alternatives for Gum Protection

Instead of these problematic foods, consider incorporating:

• Leafy green vegetables
• Fatty fish
• Nuts and seeds
• Probiotic-rich foods
• Water

Protecting Your Gum Health: Beyond Diet

While avoiding harmful foods is crucial, comprehensive gum health requires:

• Regular dental check-ups
• Proper brushing techniques
• Daily flossing
• Staying hydrated
• Managing stress

Professional Insights

Dentists consistently emphasize that diet is a fundamental component of gum health. Dr. Sarah Thompson, a periodontist, notes, ""What you eat directly impacts your oral microbiome. A strategic diet can be as powerful as any dental treatment in preventing gum disease.""

The Long-Term Impact of Dietary Choices

Making informed food choices isn't just about immediate oral health. Chronic gum disease has been linked to serious health conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and respiratory issues. By protecting your gums through diet, you're investing in your overall health.

Conclusion

Understanding and avoiding foods that contribute to gum disease is a powerful preventative strategy. By making mindful dietary choices, maintaining excellent oral hygiene, and staying informed, you can significantly reduce your risk of periodontal problems. Your gums are a window to your overall health, and every meal is an opportunity to",1,1745858615.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False
1ka06lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1ka06lw/find_out_if_the_baby_trend_pathway_35_jogger/,Find Out if the Baby Trend Pathway 35 Jogger Travel System Fits Your Needs,"The Baby Trend TJ75B73B Travel System Pathway 35 Jogger has been my go-to for testing lately, and it has some interesting points worth sharing. Being a parent who frequently juggles trips to parks, malls, and everyday errands, finding a reliable stroller and car seat combo is no small feat. This product provides a lot of convenience while keeping safety and functionality as top priorities. Below, I’ll break down my experience with this travel system that offers an intriguing blend of features and areas for improvement.

**Aesthetics and Design**

The modern aesthetic of this stroller caught my eye right away. With its sleek, metallic frame complemented by the optic grey polyester canopy, it offers a sophisticated yet casual look that fits in well with city strolls or outdoor adventures. The build feels sturdy without seeming overly bulky, which I appreciate since I have to fold and store it in my trunk regularly. The artfully designed adjustable canopy, complete with a peek-a-boo window, is a lifesaver—it allows me to keep an eye on my little one while still providing ample sun protection. This canopy proved especially useful during an outdoor picnic when the sun suddenly became intense.

**Performance and Ease of Use**

Performance-wise, the stroller’s all-terrain wheels truly stand out. The ride over bumpy gravel paths and uneven sidewalks was impressively smooth, thanks to the rear 16-inch rubber wheels. Locking the front swivel wheel for jogging also made morning runs manageable. When I tested it on dirt trails at a nature park, it handled unexpected bumps easily, keeping my little one comfortable. The quick-release feature for the wheels made cleanup simple, especially when mud got involved.

Handling this travel system daily, I noticed that the 5-point harness ensures maximum safety for my baby. Adjusting it for a snug fit took just a few seconds, and my child seemed comfortable even on longer outings. The multi-position reclining seat was another noteworthy feature, as my toddler could nap peacefully while I ran errands.

**Merits**

- Streamlined folding mechanism allows for quick and compact storage.
- Integrated parent tray with cup holders and storage makes outings more convenient.
- Ally 35 Infant Car Seat includes superior side-impact protection, providing peace of mind.
- Stroller accommodates up to 35 pounds, offering longevity for growing babies.
- All-terrain tires and lockable swivel wheel adapt well to both smooth and rugged terrain.
  
**Comfort and Convenience**

The parent console has been a game-changer for carrying keys, snacks, and coffee cups. It felt like every little aspect, from the ergonomic carry handle to the spacious storage basket, was designed with busy parents in mind. During one outing, I managed to fit a diaper bag, groceries, and my toddler’s toys—all without needing additional bags. 

The integration between the car seat and stroller is seamless, and transitioning between the two is a breeze. The stroller’s folding mechanism does require two hands, which might be cumbersome for those who want a one-hand option, but it didn’t ruin my experience by any means.

**Limitations**

- Folding requires two hands, which isn't the most convenient in situations where you're holding a child.
- The stroller’s weight, at over 35 pounds, may prove challenging for petite users to lift into a car trunk.
- The car seat fabric could be more breathable, especially during hot summer months.
  
**Safety Features**

Safety is a huge consideration, and this travel system doesn’t disappoint. The tether strap and adjustable 5-point harness prioritize your child’s security. My personal favorite feature, however, is the integrated rebound bar on the car seat, which adds extra stability while driving. During testing, the stroller maneuvered securely without tipping even when I adjusted to a brisk jogging pace.

**Competing Products**

Testing this alongside some other market contenders like the Graco FastAction Fold Jogger and Chicco Bravo Travel System revealed unique strengths. The Baby Trend Pathway 35 Jogger system is a clear winner when it comes to wheel performance on rugged terrains, an edge it holds over the Chicco Bravo, which struggles slightly in such conditions. On the flip side, the Graco system folds one-handed in a sleeker motion—something that this Baby Trend model could improve.

Compared to more expensive options, this product maintains its affordable price point while not sacrificing safety or key features. If jogger strollers are your priority, Baby Trend rides above as a value-packed solution at its price tier.

**Cost Efficiency**

With all the features crammed into this stroller and car seat combo, this travel system proves itself a worthy companion. Considering the seamless integration of a high-quality car seat, all-terrain capabilities, and practical add-ons like storage trays, you’d be hard-pressed to find a product offering the same flexibility at this price range.

This menace of an owl quick got me hooked, and it's no exaggeration to say that she helped me went through some rough times , and gave me the courage to face my struggles. I know I sound like a massive weeb and a loser, but she genuinely changed my life.

When she announced hee graduation, I, alongside many others, were devastated. Not just because of her departure, but also the sadness and agony of seeing jer not able to continue to do what she enjoys doing. But at last, the end of ""Mumei"" as come.

Thanks to my lovely boss, I was not able to watch her final stream, as well as her final 3D. But it did gave me just enough time to create this cocktail. I wanted to make a gin base cocktail with black tea and berries as the main focus. Black tea because no coffee for the birb, and to give it a brown colour. Berries because of well, her obsession with berries in Minecraft. I ended up using grenadine syrup for the berry flavour. And as the picture shows, the blood red syrup was way stronger than expected. I also added a bit of lychee liqueur and lime juice for added complexity and balance. For the garnish, I wanted to make a lemon peel in the shape of a wing, but I didn't have the time for that. This cocktail have a refreshing taste with hints of berry notes, and the exact recipe is as follows.

1oz/30ml gin
3oz/90ml black tea
⅓oz/10ml grenadine syrup 
⅓oz/10ml lychee liqueur 
½oz/15ml lime juice 
Shake it with ice
Serve with a champagne coupe 
Garnish with a lemon peel

Dear Mumei, thank you for your hard work all these years, your time in Hololive was unfortunate and unfairly cut short, but your impact on us fellow hoomans can not be understated. May you rest well and be healthy. The world might forgor, but we hoomans will never will. Thank you for being a part of many lives and making them that much happier.

1ka04bg,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1ka04bg/why_cowsar_z5812h_countertop_ice_maker_review_is/,Why COWSAR Z5812H Countertop Ice Maker Review Is Worth Reading Before Buying,"Using the COWSAR Z5812H Countertop Ice Maker has truly been an eye-opening journey in the realm of compact ice machines. I’ve had it perched on my kitchen counter for months now, churning out ice cubes for everything from quick cocktails to iced coffees in the sweltering summer heat. It shouts efficiency and convenience, but like most gadgets, it has its quirks.

**Design and Build**  
This ice maker is ridiculously portable, thanks to its compact dimensions of 11.42 x 11.3 x 8.66 inches and a weight of around 14 pounds. It fits seamlessly between my coffee maker and blender, barely occupying any counter real estate. The sleek black finish adds a touch of modernity, giving it that “not-an-eyesore” appeal. I can pick it up and move it wherever I need ice-making to happen, particularly handy during barbecues in the backyard. However, I would not call it a super lightweight product—good portability involves a bit of muscle if you're planning on constant re-positioning.

**Effortless Efficiency**  
What impressed me the most is the efficiency. It can whip out 9 bullet-shaped ice cubes in just six minutes. Did I time it? Heck yes, multiple times, and it’s consistent. The full capacity of 26.5 pounds of ice in 24 hours is not just a spec but a reassuring promise. Whether it’s keeping pitchers of iced tea chilled or refilling my cooler before fishing trips, this little powerhouse hasn’t let me down. The bullet-shaped cubes look cute but also melt slower than those jagged home freezer ones—ideal for drinks that need to stay cold longer.

**Key Benefits**  
- **Quick ice production**: Your first batch in just six minutes.  
- **Compact size**: Fits neatly on countertops without hogging space.  
- **Self-cleaning functionality**: Maintains hygiene with minimum effort.  

[Check COWSAR Z5812H price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0b6bxyvvq/)

**User-Friendliness**  
The user interface and controls are a dream for someone like me who dreads overly complicated gadgets. You just fill up the 1.2-liter water tank, hit “on,” and voila, it starts making ice like magic. There’s an indicator light that blinks when the water’s running low or when the ice basket is full. Is it foolproof? Pretty much. Several of my tech-averse relatives, including my aunt who still uses a flip phone, found it ridiculously simple to operate.

**Feature Overload: Practical or Gimmicky?**  
The self-cleaning function deserves a standing ovation. By holding the on-button for five seconds, the machine cleans itself out—fewer worries about mold or grime. I make sure to run this feature monthly. However, I noticed it doesn’t clean every corner, especially around the edges of the ice tray. So, while it’s not entirely perfect, it sure beats scrubbing manually every week.

**Quiet Operation**  
The promise of “low noise” is a definite win for this unit. Even while grinding away at making ice, it makes less noise than my kettle does when boiling water—something like 40 decibels. Did I notice it running in the middle of Netflix binges from the kitchen? Nope. I cannot say the same for my old ice maker that sounded like it was constantly protesting its existence.

**Downsides**  
- **Cleaning is not perfect**: Some spots require manual handling despite the self-cleaning feature.  
- **Storage capacity could be higher**: The basket fills up quickly, meaning I often need to transfer ice to a separate container.  

**Competing Products**  
I’ve also tested rival countertop ice makers from brands like Euhomy and Igloo. Both made ice but had limitations the COWSAR Z5812H doesn’t. For instance, Euhomy’s model, though energy-efficient, felt slower and bulkier. Igloo’s option prioritized aesthetics but lacked a self-cleaning feature, which is non-negotiable when cleanliness matters. Where this ice maker carves its niche is by combining speed, compactness, and user-friendly controls. Comparing them side by side, I’d say this product is ideal for anyone who dislikes excessive maintenance but loves speedy convenience.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Is it worth its price tag compared to standard or even high-end options? Absolutely. The balance of quality, speed, and ease of use makes it a bang-for-the-buck purchase. Many premium ice makers offer durability but often fall short of being so compact while maintaining usability. This one strikes the sweet spot, especially for someone unwilling to splurge but still wanting reliable performance.

1ka048g,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ka048g/explore_the_yabano_espresso_machine_review_is_it/,Explore the Yabano Espresso Machine Review Is It a Worthy Addition?,"Testing the Yabano CM6816 Espresso Machine for daily coffee indulgence felt like a true experiment in bringing café vibes to my home. This compact espresso maker boasts a 3.5 Bar pressure system and comes equipped with a milk frother—two essential features to help whip up lattes and cappuccinos like a budding barista. While I wouldn’t claim to be a coffee connoisseur, I drink enough of it daily to appreciate good espresso without splurging on high-end coffee makers. The Yabano CM6816 had its strengths, and I discovered a few areas that could use improvement.

**Compact Design and Storage Convenience**

The petite size of this espresso machine is a game-changer for those with limited kitchen space. Measuring approximately 13.43"" by 10.94"" by 7.6"" and weighing only about 4.66 pounds, this coffee maker snugly fits beside my toaster without overwhelming the countertop. Its lightweight design means I can easily stow it away when I need extra workspace. The machine’s black metallic finish gives it a sleek, understated look that complements most kitchen styles. However, I couldn’t help but notice some parts felt a bit plasticky, making me wonder about its long-term durability.

**Ease of Use for Beginners**

Using the Yabano espresso machine is as straightforward as it gets. It simplifies the complexity of espresso brewing into just a few steps—perfect for people like my cousin, who only recently started dabbling in homebrewing. The buttons and controls are intuitive, and the manual gives clear guidance. This machine even surprised a friend of mine who swears that all coffee machines are “complicated gadgets.” Four cups of espresso can be brewed at once, which makes this a win for small households or guests.

[Check Yabano CM6816 price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c1ghhcgm/)

**Good Aspects**

- Lightweight and compact, perfect for small kitchens.  
- Produces up to four cups of espresso simultaneously for group coffee sessions.  
- Built-in milk frother delivers creamy foam for cappuccinos or lattes.  
- Relatively easy to clean with detachable components like the drip tray and portafilter.  

**Steam Wand Performance**

Highlighting the Yabano espresso machine’s charm is its built-in steam wand. With a few tries, I managed to create frothy milk for my vanilla latte. My teenage niece, exploring her newly discovered love for cappuccinos, spent a delightful Sunday morning experimenting with frothing oat milk. The steam wand folds out when needed and functions adequately, though perfect foam might require practice. I did notice, however, that it takes slightly longer than expected to achieve the desired texture, and the wand occasionally produced a faint whining noise during use.

**Disadvantages**

- Frothing takes extra time to perfect, especially for beginners.  
- Some components feel less durable due to heavy use of plastic.  
- Limited 3.5 Bar pressure impacts the crema quality in the espresso produced.  

**Competitors**

While the Yabano espresso machine shines in compactness and affordability, it faces tough competition from similar entry-level options. Compared to a Delonghi machine, for example, Yabano sacrifices pressure power for the sake of portability and simplicity. Machines like the Nespresso Essenza are more user-friendly for pod enthusiasts but lack the versatility for cappuccino-making that comes with an integrated steam wand. Yabano outdoes many peers in price, giving budget-conscious buyers more value for money. Still, a competitor like the Breville Bambino amps up its durability and overall brewing quality, albeit at a much steeper cost.

**Price Performance**

Considering its array of functionalities and compact, beginner-friendly design, this coffee maker offers excellent bang for your buck. Budget limitations often force compromises, but this machine strikes a balance between usability and affordability without sacrificing too much quality. The built-in milk frother, adjustable settings, and the ability to brew multiple cups at once only enhance its cost-effectiveness. Sure, it’s not high-end in construction, but for its target audience—casual coffee drinkers and espresso rookies—it more than delivers.

When I hit a rough patch financially, I felt vulnerable and turned to our mutual friend D for help. He let me crash on his couch until I could get back on my feet. M knew about my situation and offered sympathy—until I learned otherwise.

One evening after hanging out with M and D, D pulled me aside and told me M was furious at me. I asked M what was wrong and she said she’d just broken up with her boyfriend and some of that anger spilled onto me. I believed her and felt relieved we’d cleared the air.

The relief vanished a day later when D confessed M had actually been calling me a loser, selfish, manipulative, even “toxic,” and urging him to kick me out. Learning she’d been disparaging me behind my back—especially while I was already at my lowest—felt like a betrayal. I’ve been struggling to keep my life together, and her words cut deeper because she knew how much I was relying on D’s support.

I couldn’t bring myself to confront her, so I’ve been avoiding her in class and ignoring her messages for weeks. M has noticed the distance and wants to talk about the sudden shift in our dynamic. I’m torn between protecting myself from more hurt and giving her a chance to explain. A part of me misses our friendship; another part fears she’ll simply confirm her cruelty.

January 25th, 2020. Time Unknown. Location Unknown.

At Mildred's request, Jason eventually sat down, but not before completely rebuilding the chair he was about to sit in, cleaning up its appearance in seconds and making it more aesthetically pleasing and ergonomically comfortable. After that, he settled in and turned a distracted gaze toward her.

""Well?"" Jason asked impatiently. ""What's the matter?""

""Jason."" Mildred explained patiently. ""Right now, you are experiencing extreme stress due to the cognitive boosts provided by your GenesisFrame. I need you to try and calm down, dear boy. Relax for a moment. Close your eyes. Take a long, deep breath.""

Jason frowned. ""Huh? Why even bother? I'm fine. There's just SO many problems to fix! I'm surrounded by reminders of my former laziness! It's impossible to focus!""

Mildred held up her palm. ""I know some of the problems of which you speak. When you are able to look at the world around you with a critical eye, you can be overcome with feelings of hatred, disgust, and eventually despondency. This is the curse of intelligence. It plagues many great minds, and now it is plaguing you. The difference is, entities like myself, Solomon, Raphael, and Ose all gradually gained intellect over time and adapted to it. You have amassed too much, too quickly. It is overloading your emotional centers.""

Jason fidgeted in his seat. He kept looking around the room, scowling nonstop while also trying to listen to what she was saying, albeit without a great deal of success. ""Right, right... emotional centers... uh huh... look, can this wait? I need to-""

""JASON!"" Mildred barked, making him flinch in his seat. ""Pay attention!""

The Wordsmith looked at her in shock. ""What? WHAT? Why are you yelling?! Calm down!""

Despite his surprise, Mildred's gambit succeeded. She managed to fully bring all his attention onto her.

""Listen carefully, dear boy."" Mildred explained succintly. Your GenesisFrame is a powerful machine. It is currently tuned to its highest sensitivity, overloading your mind with stimuli. You need to drastically dial down its settings, only increasing them over time. Do you understand?""

Jason finally listened. He slowly nodded, then thought for a moment. ""I didn't realize I could do that. Hmm. One moment...""

It only took a single second, and Jason was able to adjust the power consumption and load on his cerebral cortex. Just like that, the tension in his body immediately alleviated a great deal, albeit not completely. He looked around the room, still noticed some of the imperfections around himself, but paid less attention to them.

""That was... a miserable experience."" Jason muttered.

""A child raised in the jungle their whole life would have a similar reaction to suddenly being placed in a crowded subway with thousands of people speaking at once."" Mildred explained. ""Too much stimuli can be extremely dangerous for one who has not acclimated to lesser levels properly. That being said, we can confirm your GenesisFrame is functioning properly. Your cognitive speed and thought quality has improved drastically.""

Jason nodded. ""This feels like an upgrade over my old MindCore in every way. It seems like I can do anything I put my mind to, now.""

He looked thoughtful for a moment, but Mildred interrupted his internal dialogue with a dose of reality.

""Unfortunately, dear boy, that is not the case. If you attempt to use your powers of prediction like you did before, your GenesisFrame will certainly perform better than a baseline brain, but it will not compare to your original MindCore.""

She continued to explain. ""Your GenesisFrame is tightly focused on inventions, creativity, construction, deconstruction, and other things related to physical and metaphysical phenomena. It is not particularly suited for battle, nor for reading the emotional states of other Sentients. Naturally, it is still superior to any baseline human's brain. You are definitely going to feel and act more intelligently than before. But compared to a proper MindCore focused on other such things, it will not beat them in their specialization.""

Jason sat silently for a minute or two. He thought to himself about a great many things, then slowly massaged his ear between his fingers.

""I think... you're underestimating what this particular MindCore can do."" Jason said slowly. ""I don't have the constraints other people do. They would not only need to visualize and think about inventing something, but then actually build it with their own two hands.""

He looked at Mildred with a serious gaze. ""I can visualize something, then create it nearly instantly with my Wordsmithing. There are limitations, of course... but I can essentially make use of the GenesisFrame's full capabilities at 99% efficiency.""

To emphasize his point, Jason closed his eyes. With a single mental command, he reactivated the GenesisFrame at full power. His mind started to tingle, but he ignored all the abrupt, forced thoughts about things that should be annoying him in his environment, then turned his attention to a singular concept.

In a flash, a sword began to appear inside his Mind Realm. It started off simple. A basic handle, hilt, and blade. After that, the blade became thinner. Its weight balance shifted, and the handle also changed as he began altering its material composition.

Rapid-fire, Jason started trying out different quantities of iron, steel, titanium, tungsten, and many other common alloys. Then, with his knowledge of different sorts of Wordsmithium, he altered the blade again, and again, and again.

Unlike with the chairs, table, or computer monitors, this mental project did not take only a few seconds to complete. Instead, a minute dragged on. Then two minutes. Five...

Time accelerated inside his Mind Realm. Jason became frustrated and stymied as he tried adjusting parts of this new sword, only to repeatedly come up short due to his lack of knowledge in blacksmithing, metallurgy, and other such topics.

He opened his eyes. He stood up and frowned.

""Hm. Not quite right."" Jason said, turning the GenesisFrame's settings back down to a low-power mode. He met Mildred's gaze. ""I'm lacking in knowledge.""

""As I expected."" Mildred immediately retorted. ""You cannot create new paradigms until your existing knowledge-base has been shored up. Simply put, you need to do some reading, child! Reading, study, perhaps even attending college or university.""

Jason looked displeased. ""I don't have time for that.""

""Time waits for no man,"" Mildred acknowledged, ""but studying essential concepts will empower your GenesisFrame tremendously.""

Jason thought for a minute. He wandered around the Spynet, thinking to himself while occasionally glancing at the monitors.

""..._Nah_."" Jason finally concluded, waving his hand. ""Studying will take way too long. I have a better way.""

Jason once again reactivated his GenesisFrame at full capacity. He closed his eyes so the outside world wouldn't distract him, then he focused on thinking about Wordsmithing.

Before long, a hazy idea became reality. An invisible bodysuit appeared in front of his mental-self. The false Jason rapidly traveled around it, his arms and hands moving at lightning fast speeds as he cut, trimmed, and manipulated the suit to add microtechnology and magical artifacts to it.

After five minutes of concentrated thinking time, the suit was completed. Jason wasted no time in uttering a Word of Power.

""**Materialize. Shape. Form.**""

Mildred narrowed her eyes. She perceived... _something_ that appeared in midair for a split second, before silently falling to the ground. Her existence as a spiritual life-form made her more sensitive to such phenomena, but she could not actually see what Jason had just made.

Jason looked at the ground, his eyes fixating on seemingly nothing. ""**Wear.**""

An instant later... Jason disappeared!

One second, he was standing before Mildred.

The next, he completely vanished, as if he had teleported away!

Mildred widened her eyes. She squinted, feeling that Jason was... still in the same spot... perhaps. But she wasn't entirely certain...

Then, Jason's face seemingly poked out of a hole in the air. The rest of his body was completely hidden, but his face was somehow visible.

""It's a new type of stealth suit."" Jason explained. ""It has all sorts of magical technology built into it. My ability to create weapons and armor is subpar, but magical-based technology isn't too difficult. This stealth suit should allow me to move around, undisturbed.""

Mildred looked at him with wonder in her eyes. She couldn't believe how amazing this single item was... and he had made it with only a few minutes of thought! What other incredible feats could he achieve in the future once his GenesisFrame had matured and he'd grown even better at using its capabilities?

""What do you need a stealth suit for?"" Mildred eventually asked. ""Don't tell me you're going to try assassinating demons already?!""

""No, definitely not."" Jason replied, his face still bobbing up and down oddly in the air. ""Right now, I have a critical lack of knowledge. I need to remedy this issue at once. I'm going to infiltrate several key facilities around the world as quietly as possible. This suit is equipped with technology and magic-foiling stealth systems. It should perform excellently at obfuscating my movements.""

Mildred nodded, but she seemed unconvinced. ""I can pass you my knowledge, dear boy. It's not too difficult. I have a wealth of information at my disposal I've collected over the years! Sadly, I am nowhere near as adept as Solomon. His information and intelligence reserves greatly dwarf mine.""

""Yeah, I don't doubt the _Knowledge-Thief_ who scares the Volgrim shitless has more information than you."" Jason remarked idly. ""I'll be back in a bit.""

Jason's face disappeared as he retreated into his stealth suit. A moment later, he entirely vanished from the spot.

...

Inside the United States Library of Congress, an invisible specter teleported into a quiet corner of one of the interior rooms. It started slowly walking around, using magic to mass-read and swallow entire shelves of books in seconds.

This specter was none other than Jason. Using Words of Power, he downloaded millions of words every minute, starting from the local history section and quickly working his way outward.

It took him time to do this, time he'd rather not waste. But it was necessary. His GenesisFrame was not like Solomon's Crown; it did not have unlimited storage capacity. But even a trillion books wouldn't take up that much of its room. Only extremely complicated audiovisual works, such as music, movies, and the life memories of other Sentients would rapidly fill up its capacity.

Even so, Jason already had an idea of how to fix this problem.

External data storage! 

He could easily copy important things worth keeping into a massive data cluster hidden somewhere in the Milky Way. It could be in Realspace, or it could be hidden inside a folded dimension. Either way, he could shove essentially an infinite amount of information there, only connecting to it when he needed its contents for a new project.

This was not a quick project, but a long-term one. All he was doing today was rapidly collecting most of human civilization's core information. Later, he would use it for his own purposes. Eventually, he could transform humanity's collective knowledge into a cudgel to beat the demons into submission!

If they didn't submit, they would die.

Jason's heart no longer held any compassion for other species. He had lost everything he valued. No longer would he take risks with the lives of his loved ones.

He flitted from room to room, taking to the air to silently levitate above the thousands of daily visitors the Library of Congress received. A lot of them were lawyers and judges, but there were also reporters, ordinary citizens, and tourists too. This time of year, it was rather cold outside, so people entered to warm themselves, but during the summer foot traffic would easily quintuple.

Jason was lucky that he could come here while so few people were around.

As he devoured the contents of a shelf of books regarding historical blacksmithing practices, a television in the corner played a news broadcast.

""President Johannesburg's agenda is considered controversial by his critics, but he continues to press on with his Ecuadorian Eclipse Act, insisting it will bring jobs back to the United States. After the failed policies of his predecessor, President Johannesburg has a lot to prove. Thanks to excellent strategies employed by his campaign staff, he's swept the House of Representatives, holding a forty-seat majority, but unfortunately he lost the Senate by two seats. Only time will tell if this ends up obstructing him from realizing his vision of the American Dream.""

Jason glanced at the monitor. He had long forgotten about the politics of this era after living for hundreds of years in the future. And when he was a kid, worrying about politics was the last thing on his mind.

Even so, he knew that a time would come, sooner rather than later, where he had to meet with the so-called leader of the free world.

This prospect would have been extremely intimidating, even outright terrifying to the version of himself who had only left the Cryopod for a few years. He was younger and far less experienced back then.

But these days?

_Eh._

What was meeting a 'President' compared to meeting the true leader of the Milky Way, a multi-million year old monster named Unarin?

In Jason's eyes, the President was a mere mortal. He held some political power, but it paled in comparison to Jason's hard powers of magic.

Jason paused his book-collecting to think for a few moments. With his accelerated brainpower, this was like taking an hour to ponder the matter ever so casually at a coffee shop.

_Was_ the president a mere mortal? What did the demons think about him? Did they fear him? Laugh at him? Find him annoying but nothing to worry about? He commanded the strongest human military in the world, so he couldn't be _nothing_.

And then again, Jason quickly realized he had no real knowledge of what humanity's military capabilities truly were. What if they were much stronger than they seemed on the surface? What if the humans possessed weapons and technology that could make a Demon Emperor pause? That meant it could threaten the Wordsmith as well.

Interlocking pieces of a puzzle slowly snapped together in Jason's mind. Unfortunately, despite his incredible new brainpower, he realized that Mildred was right. He was no longer as effective at deductive reasoning as before. He had respecialized into an inventor, someone who could create blueprints for his Wordsmithing to bounce off. When it came to investigating conspiracies, he was rather... subpar.

_I'm still faster than a normal human, and my baseline self, but it's nothing too amazing._ Jason thought. _Right now, I'm setting up my plans, but the existing humans, the demons, angels, and Titans have had thousands of years to build their own infrastructure while I'm starting from scratch. I can borrow the manpower of the Illuminati, but they're small potatoes compared to the US military._

Jason watched as the broadcast turned to a story about flooding in Indonesia. His vision wavered as the faces of injured children, sick mothers and fathers, and broken families reached his eyes.

_So much suffering. So much pain._ Jason thought. _What am I really doing all this for? Just to dominate and control? No. That cannot be the only reason. Phoebe would hate me if she knew I had turned into a tyrant. I need a more noble cause to focus my intent. Uplifting humanity so we can defeat the demons, overthrow the Volgrim, and humble the angels is merely one piece of the puzzle. All that would happen is my species swapping from the oppressed to the oppressors._

_We need to become better than we are now._

Jason turned his eyes toward the windows outside, where he could peek at a small slice of Washington DC. There were a couple of girls sitting on a bench, sipping cocoa and talking about their day.

Inside the library, a young man was studying the history of Robert E. Lee for an upcoming college assignment. His brow knitted together in frustration as the dense and boring historical information bogged down by overly gratuitous and flowery wording struggled to burrow into his brain.

A professor of anthropology grumbled to himself about the kids these days while sipping an iced mocha latte. His mustache became wet with the liquid as it slipped between the gaps in his facial hair to enter his mouth.

All these people were individuals living their own lives. It was far too easy for Jason to take a broad view of them, looking at them like cats that needed to be herded.

A debate raged inside Jason's mind. Were humans mostly good, with sociological and economic pressures pushing them to do bad things? Or were they mostly bad, only kept in line by the firm and guiding hands of higher authorities?

This was not an easy question to answer. It wasn't a mere philosophical thought, either. How he answered it would surely affect the way he looked at and treated his fellow humans. It would alter his plans for the future, and this could lead to a disaster in the future, causing even more pain and suffering to those he ultimately wished to protect.

Jason raised his head to look at the ceiling. The Library of Congress was the world's largest library, with tall rising pillars, stained glass windows with grandiose designs, and architecture that bled elegance everywhere he looked. It was a shining pillar of what humans could accomplish when they used their minds to create art in the form of architecture.

As he looked around himself at this impressive feat of human engineering, Jason felt that humanity... couldn't be all that bad.

It had tyrants. It had dictators. It had authoritarians who sought to force their will upon others.

But it had far more good people, working tirelessly for little to no gain only to make the Earth a better place. Ornithologists who studied endangered birds and worked to protect them from extinction. Oceanographers who pushed and lobbied for cleanup efforts to save the oceans from ecological collapse. Climatologists who mapped the planet's slowly increasing heat index as humans carelessly polluted it for short term gains.

The number of bad people were far outnumbered by the good. But the bad people held a monopoly on violence, using their power to suppress those less eager to jump to using such vile tactics. In this way, they had slowly wrapped their hands around the necks of their more peaceful peers.

Perhaps, in a different era, these tactics would be necessary. After all, it took great strength to hold back the demons, angels, and Titans.

But the Wordsmith was here, now. It might finally be time to upend the old paradigm and install a new one.

_I can't just casually throw away all the 'bad' people right now._ Jason thought. _They still have some purpose for me. I need to put them in check. Make them learn who their new master is. Watch them to ensure they can't commit any future atrocities. After that? Who knows. As long as I resist becoming an even worse tyrant, I should be able to raise humanity's spirits to the apex._

Jason gazed at the ornate stained glass skylights. He couldn't see it, but in his mind's eye, he imagined being able to gaze upon the Volgrim ship currently orbiting Jupiter in absolute secrecy.

_There is still so much yet to do._ He mused.

With a shake of his head, he returned to devouring the books from before.

At Mildred's request, Jason eventually sat down, but not before completely rebuilding the chair he was about to sit in, cleaning up its appearance in seconds and making it more aesthetically pleasing and ergonomically comfortable. After that, he settled in and turned a distracted gaze toward her.

""Well?"" Jason asked impatiently. ""What's the matter?""

""Jason."" Mildred explained patiently. ""Right now, you are experiencing extreme stress due to the cognitive boosts provided by your GenesisFrame. I need you to try and calm down, dear boy. Relax for a moment. Close your eyes. Take a long, deep breath.""

Jason frowned. ""Huh? Why even bother? I'm fine. There's just SO many problems to fix! I'm surrounded by reminders of my former laziness! It's impossible to focus!""

Mildred held up her palm. ""I know some of the problems of which you speak. When you are able to look at the world around you with a critical eye, you can be overcome with feelings of hatred, disgust, and eventually despondency. This is the curse of intelligence. It plagues many great minds, and now it is plaguing you. The difference is, entities like myself, Solomon, Raphael, and Ose all gradually gained intellect over time and adapted to it. You have amassed too much, too quickly. It is overloading your emotional centers.""

Jason fidgeted in his seat. He kept looking around the room, scowling nonstop while also trying to listen to what she was saying, albeit without a great deal of success. ""Right, right... emotional centers... uh huh... look, can this wait? I need to-""

""JASON!"" Mildred barked, making him flinch in his seat. ""Pay attention!""

The Wordsmith looked at her in shock. ""What? WHAT? Why are you yelling?! Calm down!""

Despite his surprise, Mildred's gambit succeeded. She managed to fully bring all his attention onto her.

""Listen carefully, dear boy."" Mildred explained succintly. Your GenesisFrame is a powerful machine. It is currently tuned to its highest sensitivity, overloading your mind with stimuli. You need to drastically dial down its settings, only increasing them over time. Do you understand?""

Jason finally listened. He slowly nodded, then thought for a moment. ""I didn't realize I could do that. Hmm. One moment...""

It only took a single second, and Jason was able to adjust the power consumption and load on his cerebral cortex. Just like that, the tension in his body immediately alleviated a great deal, albeit not completely. He looked around the room, still noticed some of the imperfections around himself, but paid less attention to them.

""That was... a miserable experience."" Jason muttered.

""A child raised in the jungle their whole life would have a similar reaction to suddenly being placed in a crowded subway with thousands of people speaking at once."" Mildred explained. ""Too much stimuli can be extremely dangerous for one who has not acclimated to lesser levels properly. That being said, we can confirm your GenesisFrame is functioning properly. Your cognitive speed and thought quality has improved drastically.""

Jason nodded. ""This feels like an upgrade over my old MindCore in every way. It seems like I can do anything I put my mind to, now.""

He looked thoughtful for a moment, but Mildred interrupted his internal dialogue with a dose of reality.

""Unfortunately, dear boy, that is not the case. If you attempt to use your powers of prediction like you did before, your GenesisFrame will certainly perform better than a baseline brain, but it will not compare to your original MindCore.""

She continued to explain. ""Your GenesisFrame is tightly focused on inventions, creativity, construction, deconstruction, and other things related to physical and metaphysical phenomena. It is not particularly suited for battle, nor for reading the emotional states of other Sentients. Naturally, it is still superior to any baseline human's brain. You are definitely going to feel and act more intelligently than before. But compared to a proper MindCore focused on other such things, it will not beat them in their specialization.""

Jason sat silently for a minute or two. He thought to himself about a great many things, then slowly massaged his ear between his fingers.

""I think... you're underestimating what this particular MindCore can do."" Jason said slowly. ""I don't have the constraints other people do. They would not only need to visualize and think about inventing something, but then actually build it with their own two hands.""

He looked at Mildred with a serious gaze. ""I can visualize something, then create it nearly instantly with my Wordsmithing. There are limitations, of course... but I can essentially make use of the GenesisFrame's full capabilities at 99% efficiency.""

To emphasize his point, Jason closed his eyes. With a single mental command, he reactivated the GenesisFrame at full power. His mind started to tingle, but he ignored all the abrupt, forced thoughts about things that should be annoying him in his environment, then turned his attention to a singular concept.

In a flash, a sword began to appear inside his Mind Realm. It started off simple. A basic handle, hilt, and blade. After that, the blade became thinner. Its weight balance shifted, and the handle also changed as he began altering its material composition.

Rapid-fire, Jason started trying out different quantities of iron, steel, titanium, tungsten, and many other common alloys. Then, with his knowledge of different sorts of Wordsmithium, he altered the blade again, and again, and again.

Unlike with the chairs, table, or computer monitors, this mental project did not take only a few seconds to complete. Instead, a minute dragged on. Then two minutes. Five...

Time accelerated inside his Mind Realm. Jason became frustrated and stymied as he tried adjusting parts of this new sword, only to repeatedly come up short due to his lack of knowledge in blacksmithing, metallurgy, and other such topics.

He opened his eyes. He stood up and frowned.

""Hm. Not quite right."" Jason said, turning the GenesisFrame's settings back down to a low-power mode. He met Mildred's gaze. ""I'm lacking in knowledge.""

""As I expected."" Mildred immediately retorted. ""You cannot create new paradigms until your existing knowledge-base has been shored up. Simply put, you need to do some reading, child! Reading, study, perhaps even attending college or university.""

Jason looked displeased. ""I don't have time for that.""

""Time waits for no man,"" Mildred acknowledged, ""but studying essential concepts will empower your GenesisFrame tremendously.""

Jason thought for a minute. He wandered around the Spynet, thinking to himself while occasionally glancing at the monitors.

""..._Nah_."" Jason finally concluded, waving his hand. ""Studying will take way too long. I have a better way.""

Jason once again reactivated his GenesisFrame at full capacity. He closed his eyes so the outside world wouldn't distract him, then he focused on thinking about Wordsmithing.

Before long, a hazy idea became reality. An invisible bodysuit appeared in front of his mental-self. The false Jason rapidly traveled around it, his arms and hands moving at lightning fast speeds as he cut, trimmed, and manipulated the suit to add microtechnology and magical artifacts to it.

After five minutes of concentrated thinking time, the suit was completed. Jason wasted no time in uttering a Word of Power.

""**Materialize. Shape. Form.**""

Mildred narrowed her eyes. She perceived... _something_ that appeared in midair for a split second, before silently falling to the ground. Her existence as a spiritual life-form made her more sensitive to such phenomena, but she could not actually see what Jason had just made.

Jason looked at the ground, his eyes fixating on seemingly nothing. ""**Wear.**""

An instant later... Jason disappeared!

One second, he was standing before Mildred.

The next, he completely vanished, as if he had teleported away!

Mildred widened her eyes. She squinted, feeling that Jason was... still in the same spot... perhaps. But she wasn't entirely certain...

Then, Jason's face seemingly poked out of a hole in the air. The rest of his body was completely hidden, but his face was somehow visible.

""It's a new type of stealth suit."" Jason explained. ""It has all sorts of magical technology built into it. My ability to create weapons and armor is subpar, but magical-based technology isn't too difficult. This stealth suit should allow me to move around, undisturbed.""

Mildred looked at him with wonder in her eyes. She couldn't believe how amazing this single item was... and he had made it with only a few minutes of thought! What other incredible feats could he achieve in the future once his GenesisFrame had matured and he'd grown even better at using its capabilities?

""What do you need a stealth suit for?"" Mildred eventually asked. ""Don't tell me you're going to try assassinating demons already?!""

""No, definitely not."" Jason replied, his face still bobbing up and down oddly in the air. ""Right now, I have a critical lack of knowledge. I need to remedy this issue at once. I'm going to infiltrate several key facilities around the world as quietly as possible. This suit is equipped with technology and magic-foiling stealth systems. It should perform excellently at obfuscating my movements.""

Mildred nodded, but she seemed unconvinced. ""I can pass you my knowledge, dear boy. It's not too difficult. I have a wealth of information at my disposal I've collected over the years! Sadly, I am nowhere near as adept as Solomon. His information and intelligence reserves greatly dwarf mine.""

""Yeah, I don't doubt the _Knowledge-Thief_ who scares the Volgrim shitless has more information than you."" Jason remarked idly. ""I'll be back in a bit.""

Jason's face disappeared as he retreated into his stealth suit. A moment later, he entirely vanished from the spot.

...

Inside the United States Library of Congress, an invisible specter teleported into a quiet corner of one of the interior rooms. It started slowly walking around, using magic to mass-read and swallow entire shelves of books in seconds.

This specter was none other than Jason. Using Words of Power, he downloaded millions of words every minute, starting from the local history section and quickly working his way outward.

It took him time to do this, time he'd rather not waste. But it was necessary. His GenesisFrame was not like Solomon's Crown; it did not have unlimited storage capacity. But even a trillion books wouldn't take up that much of its room. Only extremely complicated audiovisual works, such as music, movies, and the life memories of other Sentients would rapidly fill up its capacity.

Even so, Jason already had an idea of how to fix this problem.

External data storage! 

He could easily copy important things worth keeping into a massive data cluster hidden somewhere in the Milky Way. It could be in Realspace, or it could be hidden inside a folded dimension. Either way, he could shove essentially an infinite amount of information there, only connecting to it when he needed its contents for a new project.

This was not a quick project, but a long-term one. All he was doing today was rapidly collecting most of human civilization's core information. Later, he would use it for his own purposes. Eventually, he could transform humanity's collective knowledge into a cudgel to beat the demons into submission!

If they didn't submit, they would die.

Jason's heart no longer held any compassion for other species. He had lost everything he valued. No longer would he take risks with the lives of his loved ones.

He flitted from room to room, taking to the air to silently levitate above the thousands of daily visitors the Library of Congress received. A lot of them were lawyers and judges, but there were also reporters, ordinary citizens, and tourists too. This time of year, it was rather cold outside, so people entered to warm themselves, but during the summer foot traffic would easily quintuple.

Jason was lucky that he could come here while so few people were around.

As he devoured the contents of a shelf of books regarding historical blacksmithing practices, a television in the corner played a news broadcast.

There's some good points here, and some things I could walk away from. Some of this could be cleared up with some simple communication between men and women, but as right now I just want to leave some thoughts. Feel free to get angry or whatever, I'm trying to be better at listening and understanding.

Anyhow I've heard it from men and women that I should start dating fat people. I am 30, and I will not date a fat person. I am not into body shaming, if a doctor says your weight is fine then you do you, even so it's none of my business what you do with your flesh vessel. NEVER  take diet pills or do some kind of self mutilation to lose weight, I'd rather you be you.

That being said, I've had this conversation too many times, and I want to respond to the strangers on the internet. I accept fat people, but I will not date a fat person. It's not about body. It's about lifestyle. I work out, I eat healthy food, I walk everywhere, and I work on my feet all day. In the morning I have to get up and move around. I am 6 ft and weight 140ish pounds. The lifestyle of a fat person is hard on me. I have dated fat people before. They do none of what I describe above. We get up in the morning, immediately they turn down my offer to go on a walk or hike, and they begin serving me pop, or coffee loaded with creamer. They then want me to sit and watch TV for 3 hours drinking several sugary drinks and sugary snacks one after another. No wonder they gained weight! It's lifestyle, it's habit, it's depressing, and it's not for me. Sorry not sorry, I'm not going to date that person.

Further more, I've had this conversation before. A pretty girl with a heavy friend tried to set me up with her heavy friend. Pretty girl had a boyfriend. I asked her, ""Why didn't your boyfriend pick the heavy person?"" She got flustered and couldn't answer. She had no problem with her boyfriend picking her over the heavy friend. She doesn't expect him to feel bad about picking her over her heavy friend, though there are many many overweight lonely people out there. Sure, I'm single and 30- but not desperate. I like being single, and I love it more every day. Just because I'm single doesn't mean I need to start dating whoever is available. I'm especially not going to date someone because they are fat and lonely.

*inspired by conversation with u/simon_hibbs*

There's a reason why I don't use the word ""determinism"" as determinism is too loaded of a word that leads to people being misdirected with their prejudicial sentiments regarding what it could and should mean.

The case is even more so with the term ""fatalism,"" which points further towards the truth, but people's emotional predispositions override the truth perpetually.

No one pursues the truth that they claim to be pursuing. The truth is self-evident in nature, and the self-evident is that which all perpetually avoid.

All things and all beings are always acting in accordance to and within the realm of their inherent natural capacity to do so at all times. An inherent natural realm of capacity of which has an inevitable result.

>Fatalism is another matter. It's not a coherent concept. Humans are no less causal and involved in future outcomes than any other natural phenomenon.

Fatalism does not deny human integral participation in the system. That's simply a strawman that people have projected onto it due to their sentimental predispositions towards a word. Fatalism simply means that the fates of all beings are ultimately predestined.

>The future may be inevitable. I can't say for sure that it isn't.

Inevitability is simply what will be for all things and all beings. All things abide by their nature, a nature of which is given to them via infinite antecedent and circumstantial coarising factors, and allows a being to behave within a certain realm of capacity, of which has an inevitable result.

The very predicament and inherent futility of this conversation is that most everyone is looking for something ""actionable."" They are looking for a weapon or defense to wield or something ""worthwhile"" as opposed to the honest witnessed reality that includes the truth of all subjective beings and not just one or some.

They end up abiding by something completely sentimental while avoiding the truth that you claim to be pursuing.

If and when the truth is witnessed by anyone, they turn around and walk the other way. Such is the nature of the human condition, other than those who are absolutely forced to witness the truth and nothing other than it, or one who has had the infinite privilege of being liberated beyond all pretenses of any kind.

All things and all beings are always acting and  behaving in accordance to and within the realm of their natural capacity to do so at all times.

It is the case that for the extreme extreme majority, that simple biological survival and sentimentality will always supersede the pursuit and witnessing of the truth of things as they are, just as they are.

Ironically, allowing them to validate and avoid the very character that they are most likely unaware of and thus perpetuating the vehicle and being by which they identify by. All along playing it nonetheless, and acting just as they would act according to their inherent nature and realm of capacity.

Even one who witnesses the absolute will still have to play the very character that they play and abide by their natural realm of capacity to do so. The only distinction is that one no longer is more convinced of the character than the truth of the absolute.

All things are in constant flux. The blind presumption is to assume that flux can change for the better or change *freely* based on the subjective will of any individual, let alone all individuals.

>If you are thirsty and there is tea and coffee available, it might be that you will drink tea, or that you will drink coffee. Only one will occur. But which will occur is due to facts about you, as you are now, and how you choose, which is a process you perform due to your nature.

All things and all being act according to their nature and within the realm of their capacity to do so at all moments. There is no equivalent ubiqutious capacity of any kind, and freedom is not the standard for all beings.

>Maybe you will see that you can respond differently in different situations and with different perspectives offered to you.

There is no maybe for me, personally, in regards to the absolute. There is only what is. The inevitable eternal result, and only the unfolding of the fractalized freedomless trajectory that takes me there.

>True. When you are next hungry or thirsty, it may be the case that you will obtain or make yourself food or drink, or it may be the case that you will not. That's a decision you will make.

It's not just a decision you will make. You need to have the opportunity to do so. You need to have a mouth, you need to have access to food, you need to have the capacity to eat, and innumerable other factors.

1ka000r,https://i.redd.it/o6c0d5xlslxe1.jpeg,World Bath Bomb Day Haul,"Went to two stores in Illinois this weekend with my husband to smell the new bombs and chose a couple. One of the stores let me know that they got to select which bombs they would like to receive based on what they thought would sell best in their store, which seemed like an interesting concept. 

The only ones I was not able to encounter between the two stores were: all the fun of the fair, champers, Chelsea morning, peppermint matcha cataplasm, mugwort cataplasm, Sadie, marshmallow and rose cataplasm, chamomile and yarrow cataplasm, we put the whole fruit in, wedding, and yog nog. I understand specifically why the cataplasm ones were not as popular because it’s a higher price ($9.50) for a smaller bomb, and at least one of them I did get to smell (oaty lavender) had no scent throw. 

Generally all the citrusy bombs were very typical generic citrus and not too interesting to me. The sun hat bomb is adorable, but scent wise underwhelming. Similarly the butterfly was lightly scented, but beautiful. I’m not a big gourmand/coffee fan so I was not tempted by sticky dates, sweet as honey, let the good times roll, or sonic death monkey. ET had no scent throw and the ruby bomb (that was supposed to smell like the spongebob balm) was underwhelming too. 

I did pick up a super milk though which is a little sweeter smelling than the spray. Green fairy is supposed to be based off absinthe and is a light green scent with some sweetness. The cardamom and tea scents shine in the matcha blueberry bomb. Narcosis is a very complex interesting floral with some greener woodsy notes. The coconut cataplasm is pure coconut vanilla. Moonshine has woodsy earth and minty notes that remind me a lot of a fresh scent like mix of dirty and fresh as. And one of the sleeper bombs for me was the house shaped mo-ment for life, it has lovely ginger notes and would be perfect for an invigorating post workout or early morning bath. 

All in all super happy with the new collection, wish there was less citrus but the otherwise unique bombs are great. And as a bonus my husband and I got to make free Edamummy bombs to take home at one location! Was thrilled to finally get to try a pressing, it was so fun and I plan on possibly reusing the molds for a craft.

But by late 2024, I was seriously struggling to stay focused at work.

I work from home (marketing stuff), and honestly, it got to a point where I couldn’t concentrate for more than 15 minutes without getting distracted. It wasn’t just work either—I'd start a book and leave it half-finished, or sit down to do something important, then somehow end up scrolling Reddit or lost in a random YouTube rabbit hole.

A buddy of mine mentioned he was using something called The Genius Wave. I figured it was just another productivity app or some motivational course, but it’s actually an audio program that uses specific sound frequencies (they call it 7-second brain stimulation) to help rewire your brain for better focus, creativity, and memory.

[The Genius Wave](https://preview.redd.it/s56kl918slxe1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=eaad54b0475ca03674f1b9b7eac1794c895fea6e)

At first, I thought it sounded way too woo-woo for me. But it didn’t cost much to try, and it didn’t require me to overhaul my routine, so I figured, why not.

I started listening to it first thing in the morning for about 10 minutes while drinking my coffee.

Not kidding—within about two weeks, I noticed I wasn’t getting distracted as easily. I could sit and knock out a full task before even thinking about picking up my phone. Plus, when I got new ideas for work, they seemed to come quicker and with way less mental effort.

I’m not saying it’s some magic cure for laziness, but The Genius Wave definitely helped me get my brain firing again and feel more in control of my focus. I still use it a few times a week, especially when I know I’ve got heavy workdays ahead.

Anyone else here tried brainwave audio stuff? Curious if different programs worked for you too—would love to swap recommendations. 🎧🧠

I recently got my hands on the Soundcore by Anker A20i True Wireless Earbuds, item model number A3948, and have been using them regularly during work, leisure, and workouts. Packed with features like Bluetooth 5.3, app customization, and a hefty 28-hour battery life, this little package had me intrigued. As someone who relies heavily on convenient and portable audio solutions, I was eager to see how these would perform in real-world scenarios. While they certainly impressed in several areas, there were a few quirks worth mentioning.

**Design and Portability**

Straight out of the box, the earbuds are compact and come nestled in an equally small charging case. The inclusion of a lanyard makes portability a breeze, and the sleek black design feels modern yet understated. I found the earbuds incredibly lightweight, barely registering their presence, even during extended use. Kudos to their ergonomic in-ear fit, which comfortably sealed off external noises while staying snug during movement.

I often threw the case into my gym bag without a second thought, and it held up to the abuse like a champ. While I appreciate the portability, the plastic build could feel a tad fragile, especially in comparison to some competitors that use a sturdier material. Still, for the minimalist in me, this design checks most boxes. 

[Check Soundcore A3948 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0btybvr4s/)

**Sound Quality and Customization**

Music feels like a personal concert with these earbuds. The customizable EQ options offered through the Soundcore app blew me away. There are 22 preset equalizer modes available, but it was the BassUp feature that left a lasting impression. By enabling this preset, the bass levels go from mild to punchy, letting you savor those beats exactly the way you want them. Whether I was listening to some mellow acoustic tunes or blasting bass-driven tracks during my runs, the audio felt full-bodied and immersive.

However, for audiophiles seeking studio-grade precision, these buds might fall just short. The sound is great for casual listening, but ultra-critical ears may notice it lacks some depth in mids and highs.

**Battery Life and Charging**

Let me tell you, battery life had me sold on these earbuds. A full charge offers nine hours of playback, which extends to a commendable 28 hours with the charging case. The speed of charging is fantastic too. I often found myself in a pinch, needing to head out quickly, but just a 10-minute charge gave me an extra two hours of playtime. It’s ridiculously convenient for a forgetful user like me who never remembers to charge things beforehand. This is easily one of the standout features of the product. 

**Call Quality and Microphones**

Call clarity? Surprisingly good. With two AI-enhanced microphones packed into these earbuds, even my calls in busy coffee shops sounded crisp. The algorithm does a fine job of focusing on your voice while tuning out background chaos. On one call, my friend asked if I had switched to a noise-canceling headset, which speaks volumes about the product’s effectiveness.

One thing to note, though—these perform best indoors. In windy outdoor conditions, the microphone struggles a bit to maintain the same level of clarity.

**Positives**

- Highly customizable sound with 22 EQ presets via the app.
- Lightweight, compact, and ergonomically designed for long-term comfort.  
- Extensive battery life with 28 hours of playtime (with case).  
- Quick 10-minute charge adds two hours of playback.  
- AI-enhanced microphones deliver clear voice quality for calls.  

**Shortcomings**

- Plastic build can feel flimsy compared to some alternatives.  
- Sound may lack analytical precision for high-end audiophiles.  

**Competitive Options**

The wireless earbuds market often feels saturated with choices, but a few rivals stand out as direct comparison points. Take, for example, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 or the Jabra Elite 3. The Samsung earbuds offer some top-tier soundscapes and even active noise cancelation, but they come at a noticeably higher price point. Similarly, Jabra’s option provides weather resistance and a more polished build but can’t quite match the battery mileage here.

Where the Soundcore A20i excels is in its customization via the app, extended battery life, and affordability considering the feature set. If you prioritize all-day use and slight personalization tweaks, this product easily takes the edge over pricier contenders.

**Budget-Friendly**

When evaluating the financial value of this gadget, I’d say it perfectly blends affordability with performance. Easy connectivity through Bluetooth 5.3, the solid playtime, and rich app-driven options add up to a device that punches above its weight. Sure, the materials could be more premium, but that trade-off means it doesn’t break the bank.

1k9zwr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1k9zwr8/explore_the_animalgifts_appliance_slider_review/,Explore the Animal-Gifts appliance slider review for the best kitchen upgrade!,"Testing out the Animal-Gifts B0C287T9N7 Appliance Sliders for Kitchen has been an interesting experience in my day-to-day kitchen routine. As someone who loves experimenting with home gadgets, I was curious if these small adhesive sliders could simplify countertop appliance management without sacrificing durability or performance. Here's how it all went!

**Installation Simplicity and Build Quality**  
I kicked things off by testing how easy it was to install these sliders. With a self-adhesive backing, they promised a no-fuss application, and they truly delivered. All I had to do was wipe the surface of my appliances clean, peel off the adhesive sticker, and stick them on. It took less than ten minutes for my air fryer, blender, and coffee maker. The sliders themselves are round, lightweight, and made from PTFE (Teflon) material with a smooth finish. Despite their tiny size, they felt quite sturdy and adhered well to glass, wood, and metal surfaces in my kitchen.

**Easy Movement on Different Surfaces**  
The standout feature of these sliders is their ability to make heavy kitchen appliances glide across countertops effortlessly. I tested them on a mix of surface types, including tile, hardwood, and even carpet. On my quartz countertop, my instant pot slid smoothly to the corner without a single scratch. Lifting and dragging your appliances is officially a thing of the past with these. They reminded me of ski pads the way they glide!

[Check Animal-Gifts B0C287T9N7 price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0c287t9n7/)

**Space-Saving and Practical**  
For smaller kitchens like mine, where countertops are prime real estate, these sliders shine. By making it easier to move my appliances around, I could push them into far corners without fear of damaging the surface or wasting space. They keep my workspace clear and organized when I'm preparing meals for the family.

**Durability Over Multiple Uses**  
I was initially skeptical about how long these adhesive-backed sliders would last under regular use. After repeatedly sliding my air fryer and rice cooker over the course of a week, the sliders held up remarkably well. They didn’t lose their stickiness or show signs of wear. One Amazon reviewer mentioned that they reuse the sliders across various appliances, and I feel this idea could work if you handle them gently.

**Advantages**  
Using these handy sliders regularly has brought several perks.  

- Makes moving heavy appliances super easy and scratch-free.  
- Works on multiple surface types without compromising control.  
- Saves counter space by allowing easy storage of bulky gadgets.  
- Sturdy build ensures durability despite daily use.  

**Hurdles**  
However, not everything is perfect, and a few things might need improvement:  

- The adhesive can occasionally struggle on textured appliance bottoms.  
- Not silent; occasional dragging noises can occur depending on the countertop finish.  
- You need to ensure precise placement during installation, as repositioning weakens the glue over time.  

**Peer Products Comparison**  
Comparing these sliders to alternatives in the market like appliance sliding trays or larger sliders, the verdict feels clear. Sliding trays, while effective for movement, tend to take up more counter space due to their bulky design. Meanwhile, larger sliders come with limitations when used on different-sized appliances. These small, round sliders offer more versatility and adhere to a wider range of surfaces. Their simplicity beats the complicated mechanics of trays, and their lightweight build makes them more adaptable for daily use.

**Price Performance**  
If you’re like me and skeptical about spending too much on kitchen gadgets, this product is a great middle ground. A pack of 24 sliders stretches your dollar significantly by providing enough for multiple appliances. It's definitely a cost-efficient solution that doesn’t compromise on functionality. Similar products often come in smaller packs or at comparable prices for fewer pieces, which makes this set stand out.

1k9zvu6,https://i.redd.it/d2tg3acqrlxe1.png,Turning Stress Awareness Into Action: How Leaders Can Build Personal Stress-Management Plans That Actually Stick,"**TL;DR:**  
Awareness alone doesn’t create change. Leaders need simple, identity-aligned habits tied to real-world cues and meaningful rewards. Today’s post breaks down how to create a personal stress-management plan that transforms insight into daily leadership resilience.

---

Over the last month, I’ve been running a deep-dive Stress Awareness series focused on helping leaders rethink stress as a strategic signal rather than a personal weakness. One key insight that’s become crystal clear: **awareness without action changes nothing.**

It’s easy to attend a workshop, read a great article, or hear a compelling idea about stress management—but without a system to apply it, even the best insights fade.

So today’s focus is on *strategic action planning*—how leaders can translate what they know into daily, sustainable habits that actually strengthen leadership over time.

---

## Why Action Planning Matters for Stress Management

Research consistently shows that behavior change doesn’t happen through good intentions alone. Sustainable change happens when we design our environment, habits, and mindset to support our growth automatically.

One of the most widely accepted frameworks in behavior science is the **Habit Loop** model, popularized by Charles Duhigg. It emphasizes that every habit has three parts:

- **Cue** (the trigger that initiates the behavior)
- **Routine** (the actual behavior or action)
- **Reward** (the immediate benefit you experience)

When leaders intentionally build small habits around these loops, stress management stops being a task and starts becoming *who they are.*

This approach is particularly important for executive and leadership roles, where cognitive overload, decision fatigue, and chronic stress are constant risks. Leadership resilience isn’t built by “trying harder”—it’s built by *designing smarter.*

---

## How to Build a Personal Stress Management Plan

If you’re serious about embedding real change, here’s how I recommend approaching it:

**1. Identify a Cue**
Choose a consistent, reliable trigger in your day. Examples could include:
- Finishing a meeting
- Closing your laptop at the end of the workday
- Brewing your morning coffee

The more automatic the cue, the easier the habit sticks.

**2. Define the Routine**
Pick one small, stress-reducing action you can immediately perform after the cue:
- A 3-minute mindful breathing exercise
- A short gratitude reflection
- A quick stretch or brief walk around your space

Make it *simple enough* that even on tough days, it feels doable.

**3. Create a Reward**
Associate the new routine with a positive, meaningful reinforcement:
- A moment of self-acknowledgment
- Logging a quick success in a journal
- A physical reminder like a calming token or sensory reset

Rewards matter. They close the loop and signal to your brain that this behavior is worth repeating.

---

## SMART Goals for Stress Management

To avoid vague intentions like ""I’ll manage stress better,"" translate your habit into a **SMART goal**:
- **Specific:** “Practice 3 minutes of mindful breathing after closing my laptop at 5 PM.”
- **Measurable:** Track the number of days you complete the routine.
- **Achievable:** Keep it simple and manageable, even during busy periods.
- **Realistic:** Choose a behavior that fits your current work-life rhythm.
- **Time-bound:** Commit to practicing for the next 30 days, with a check-in at the halfway point.

---

## Why Tracking Matters

Behavioral science shows that tracking habits—even informally—significantly increases the chances of them sticking. Some options:
- Wearables (like HRV or RHR tracking for physiological stress indicators)
- Apps (Daylio, Clarity, or even a simple checklist app)
- Physical journals (especially helpful for leaders who prefer analog tools)

Tracking isn’t about judgment. It’s about building self-awareness and noticing patterns without shame or perfectionism.

---

## Accountability Amplifies Success

If possible, set up an **accountability structure**:
- Partner with a peer or colleague
- Set weekly or bi-weekly check-ins
- Celebrate progress and troubleshoot setbacks

External accountability dramatically increases behavior change success, especially when the system is framed positively rather than punitively.

---

## Closing Thoughts: Identity Drives Behavior

At its core, successful stress management planning isn’t just about behavior change—it’s about **identity shaping**.

Leaders who succeed at building resilience don’t just ""do"" habits. They *become* the kind of leader who embodies intentional energy stewardship, emotional regulation, and presence under pressure.

Every small habit reinforces that identity. Every moment you manage stress intentionally strengthens the kind of leader you are becoming.

---

If you’ve been following any part of my Stress Awareness Month content—or you’re just jumping in now—this is one of the most important takeaways:

✅ Insights are valuable.  
✅ Reflection is necessary.  
✅ But **action is where leadership transformation happens.**

I’d love to hear from you:

- What’s one habit you want to build that would make a meaningful difference in how you lead under pressure?
- What’s worked (or not worked) for you when trying to build more sustainable stress management practices?

Let’s swap ideas. 👇

1k9zrd3,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1k9zrd3/does_the_cowsar_z5812h_countertop_ice_maker_truly/,Does the COWSAR Z5812H Countertop Ice Maker Truly Deliver? Comprehensive Review,"Testing out the COWSAR Z5812H countertop ice maker over the past few weeks has been quite the experience. This compact and portable ice machine caught my attention for its promise of quick ice production, self-cleaning capabilities, and a sleek design that fits into nearly any kitchen or bar setting. I pushed it to its limits, making ice non-stop for get-togethers, casual weekends, and the occasional late-night drink-mixing session. As much as I appreciated how well it performed, there were some quirks worth highlighting along the way.

**Compact Design and Build**  
What instantly stood out to me about this countertop ice maker is its size. Measuring just 11.4 inches in height with a weight of about 14 pounds, it sits comfortably on my kitchen counter without commandeering too much space. Its minimalistic design, complemented by the carrying handle, makes it a versatile option for home bars, camping trips, or even small offices. The ice scoop and basket included in the box felt like thoughtful additions, though I did find myself wishing they were made from slightly more durable materials.

**Quick and Efficient Ice Production**  
This little machine is an absolute workhorse. It churns out 9 bullet-shaped ice cubes in only 6 minutes, which felt like a lifesaver on hot days when cold drinks were in high demand. Over a 24-hour period, it boasts a capacity of 26.5 pounds of ice, far exceeding what my household could use in a single day. Whether it’s for cocktails, keeping my iced coffee cool, or chilling food platters, this thing keeps up without a hitch. The unique bullet shape of the ice cubes is also a nice touch—they melt slower and don’t clump together as traditional cubes might.

**[Check COWSAR Z5812H price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0b6bxyvvq/)**  

**User-Friendly Operation**  
Simplicity is a big win here. You just fill the water reservoir, press the ""on"" button, and in no time, those ice cubes start dropping. I appreciated the indicator light, which alerts you if there’s insufficient water or if the ice basket is full. It’s the kind of straightforward functionality that even my tech-averse parents could master without needing my help.

**Self-Cleaning Feature**  
The self-cleaning function is a standout, activated by holding the ""on"" button for five seconds. It takes a lot of stress out of upkeep, especially given how many times I’ve skipped cleaning other kitchen gadgets until they’re downright disgusting. Keeping it on a monthly cleaning schedule has kept it running efficiently, and knowing the ice-making parts are clear of buildup is reassuring.

**Low Noise Operation**  
One of my biggest worries with appliances like these is whether they’ll disturb the peace, especially since I often use it late at night. This ice maker runs at under 42 decibels, which is quiet enough not to bother anyone lounging in the next room. Honestly, the humming noise it produces is softer than my refrigerator, which was a pleasant surprise.

**Advantages**  
- Compact and lightweight design with a carrying handle for portability.  
- Produces 9 ice cubes in just 6 minutes, making it perfect for impromptu gatherings.  
- Straightforward controls make the machine easy to operate for users of all ages.  
- Self-cleaning mode ensures minimal maintenance and hygienic ice production.  
- Operates quietly, making it ideal for home use, even in smaller spaces.  

**Shortcomings**  
- The included scoop and ice basket, while functional, feel a bit flimsy.  
- Ice cubes start melting fairly quickly if left in the basket too long, as there’s no chilling mechanism.  
- The water reservoir’s capacity might be limiting for larger events—frequent refills are required.  

**Product Comparisons**  
Having tried similar portable ice makers like those from GE or Frigidaire, the COWSAR machine holds its own in terms of portability and speed of operation. The Frigidaire model I used in the past had a slightly larger reservoir, meaning fewer water refills were needed, but it lacked the self-cleaning feature that I’ve come to appreciate so much. On the other hand, some high-end GE models can keep their ice chilled within the storage basket, a feature noticeably missing here. However, for its price range and intended use, this ice maker strikes a great balance of functionality and affordability.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
The value you’re getting here feels solid for the features offered. While it doesn’t include every high-end capability, it’s a dependable solution to everyday ice-making needs. Comparably priced options sometimes skimp on convenience features like the self-cleaning mode or fail to deliver quiet operation. It truly stands out for people who regularly entertain guests, need ice on-the-go, or live in smaller spaces where a large appliance isn’t viable.

1k9zqrf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyGearReviews/comments/1k9zqrf/uncover_why_the_baby_trend_pathway_35_jogger/,Uncover why the Baby Trend Pathway 35 Jogger Travel System review stands out!,"**Testing the Baby Trend TJ75B73B Travel System**  

Having spent several weeks putting the Baby Trend TJ75B73B Travel System through its paces, I feel pretty comfortable sharing my thoughts. This stroller and car seat combo in ""Optic Grey"" has been a notable addition to our outings with my nephew. With safety and convenience high on my checklist, a system that promises both is enough to pique my interest, and I wasn't disappointed—well, mostly.

**Design and Aesthetic Appeal**  

The sleek design really stood out to me. Sporting a modern optic grey color, the travel system looks chic without being flashy. The polyester seat material not only feels durable but is also easy to clean (spilled juice and cookie crumbs didn’t stand a chance). As someone who insists on functionality, I also appreciated that despite its polished look, practical elements like the spacious undercarriage basket weren’t overlooked. This feature is definitely a win for carrying diaper bags, toys, and sometimes even groceries.  

**Performance on Various Terrains**  

I’ve tested this jogger stroller on a variety of surfaces—smooth pavements, grass, and even those pesky bumpy park trails. Let me tell you, those 16-inch all-terrain rear bicycle wheels are a godsend! It rolled effortlessly and securely, even when my curious toddler passengers decided to wiggle around. Its lockable front swivel wheel added extra control when I was maneuvering tighter spaces. There were some bumps, though, literally and figuratively, that I’ll touch on later.  

[Check Baby Trend TJ75B73B price on Amazon.](https://babycareshop.com/p/b07964g4ch/)  

**Safety Features That Provide Peace of Mind**  

One of my biggest concerns when selecting a travel system is safety, and this product doesn’t slack. The five-point harness gives a snug and secure fit for infants, and the tether strap adds another layer of protection in case of unforeseen bumps. I also appreciated the included Ally 35 Infant Car Seat, which boasts superior head and side impact protection. Installing it with the compatible base was more straightforward than I expected.  

**Upsides**  

- Lockable front swivel wheel improves handling in tighter spaces.  
- 12-inch front and 16-inch rear bicycle wheels create a smooth, sturdy ride on uneven terrain.  
- Ally 35 Infant Car Seat includes top-notch impact protection features.  
- Adjustable canopy shields kids from harsh sunlight while allowing a view through the peek-a-boo window.  
- Extra storage compartments are perfect for busy days out.  

**Negatives**  

Not everything about this system is sunshine and rainbows.  
- The weight feels on the heavier side, making lifting it into car trunks tricky for petite users.  
- Folding the stroller isn’t as seamless as I’d hoped, with the process requiring a bit more muscle and coordination.  
- While the seat boasts several recline positions, getting the perfect angle for a particularly fussy baby wasn’t always easy.  

**Comfort for Both Parent and Child**  

During family walks and errands, the reclining seat turned out to be great for my nephew, who seemed to enjoy both napping in and observing the world from it. For me, pushing the stroller was surprisingly comfortable—the handlebar was just the right height. I also appreciated the parent tray, complete with cup holders and a covered storage compartment. A hot coffee stays upright, a small miracle for my unpredictable mornings!  

**Product Comparisons**  

Comparing this system with others on the market is where things get really interesting. For instance, the Graco FastAction Fold Jogger surprised me with its lighter frame and one-second fold mechanism, which is something the Baby Trend system lacks. However, Graco’s smaller wheels didn’t hold up nearly as well on rugged trails, where the Baby Trend excelled. The Chicco Bravo Trio, another rival system, has a more compact design but offers less storage room, which can be a dealbreaker when you’re lugging around half your home essentials. Each has strengths, but the Baby Trend TJ75B73B holds its own if lifestyle versatility is what you’re after.  

**Value for Money**  

Speaking of cost, the investment feels justified for what you’re getting. When you consider the number of features packed into this travel system—like the premium safety standards, sturdy build, and convenience extras—it holds up well compared to other brands in the same price range. Still, if weight and folding ease are major factors, you might feel hesitant. It’s all about determining your priorities.

Hi, friend! If you’re here, you might be dealing with that jittery, worried feeling we call anxiety.

1k9zqge,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1k9zqge/investigate_the_yabano_espresso_machine_review_is/,Investigate the Yabano Espresso Machine review is it the best budget buy,"Using the Yabano espresso machine (model number: Espresso Machine), I’ve had the pleasure of testing its capabilities over several weeks. I wanted an entry-level machine for my daily espresso and latte fix without resorting to expensive coffee shop runs. This compact, fully automatic gem seemed to fit the bill for its practicality and features, albeit with some caveats.

**Design and Build Quality**

One of the standout features of this espresso maker is its compact design. Measuring 13.43""D x 10.94""W x 7.6""H and weighing 4.66 pounds, it doesn’t hog much counter space. This is crucial for someone like me, with a kitchen cluttered with gadgets. The sleek black metallic exterior contributes to its modern aesthetic. That said, the machine’s plastic construction feels a bit lightweight and lacks the premium sturdiness of pricier models. I occasionally worried it might not hold up well under consistent use. 

**Ease of Use and Operation**

Operating this espresso machine was unexpectedly straightforward, even for someone who isn’t a hardcore coffee enthusiast. The buttons are intuitive, and the setup is painless. The machine’s ability to brew up to four cups at once has proven useful for family brunches or when I need an extra caffeine kick to power through deadlines. It’s pretty forgiving for beginners, and I never once felt overwhelmed trying to figure it out. Just make sure when locking the filter holder, you align the handle at the lock position. It took me a couple of tries at first, but I got the hang of it.  

[Want the best deal for Yabano Espresso Machine? Check Amazon for pricing.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b0c1ghhcgm/)

**Milk Frother and Steam Wand**

Let’s talk about the steamer: the built-in milk frother is a delightful addition. At first, I struggled a bit to achieve that silky, frothy consistency for my cappuccinos, as it takes some practice. But with some trial and error—and spilling a fair amount of milk—I managed respectable lattes and cappuccinos with creamy foam. A relative even mentioned how café-like the froth looked when I served her a drink! It’s not as powerful as higher-end machines, so if milk frothing perfection is your goal, you might lean toward an additional stand-alone frother. The wand folds neatly out of the way and can be cleaned by removing the rubber tip, which is a thoughtful feature.

**Performance and Brewing Quality**

With a 3.5-bar pressure machine like this one, the espresso isn’t as robust or velvety as you’d get from a higher-pressure model. Still, I won’t call myself disappointed—it brews a decent shot that matches the quality you’d expect at this price. I’ve tried a variety of coffee grounds, but medium-coarse grounds worked best for optimal extraction, as recommended. A tip here—if you use a very fine grind, it may turn bitter or clog. Experimenting with fresh beans opened up layers of flavors I hadn’t expected from such an affordable device.

**Maintenance and Cleaning**

Cleaning the espresso maker and its components turned out to be simple enough. Parts like the portafilter, nozzle, and drip tray are removable, which makes washing them under running water a breeze. However, a few areas of the machine, like the inside of the coffee basket, required a bit more of a scrub, especially after using flavored syrups. While it didn’t feel too burdensome, remember that a careful, thorough cleaning ensures the integrity of flavor in future brews.

**Highlights**

- Compact design easily fits tight counter spaces.  
- Straightforward buttons make it beginner-friendly.  
- Produces rich foam with a moderately effective steam wand.  
- Components like the drip tray and portafilter are removable for easier cleaning.  
- Affordable option to get into espresso brewing at home.

**Areas for Improvement**

- Plastic build can feel a bit flimsy compared to metal alternatives.  
- Does not feature an auto-shutoff function, so you’ll need to remember to turn it off manually.  
- Milk frothing functionality, though decent, isn’t flawless and takes practice.  
- Limited pressure means less crema and boldness compared to higher-end machines.  

**Competing Brands**

I’ve explored competing machines like the De’Longhi Stilosa and the Mr. Coffee Café Barista. Unlike Yabano’s espresso machine, the De’Longhi provides 15-bar pump pressure for extracting intensely flavored espresso. The drawback? It’s bulkier, so good-bye to precious counter real estate. Mr. Coffee Café Barista, on the other hand, has an automatic milk frother and a push-button interface, which is a huge plus. However, it’s priced significantly higher. What makes the Yabano stand out is its affordability and simplicity, catering mainly to beginners who want a no-frills espresso setup.

**Cost Effectiveness**

For the price range, you’re getting a machine capable of delivering espresso, lattes, and cappuccinos without breaking the bank. While it naturally lacks some of the advanced features found in premium models, it covers the basics quite well.

Why do we need it?
Is it that important?

The extant to which we struggle in our daily lives, particularly if you’re a working professional, love, care, affection and empathy are the things that can work wonders to brighten up your otherwise tiring and monotonous life. 😬

- Had a bad day at work?
- Your manager/boss slammed you for some or no reason?
- Had a tiff with your teammate?
- Mentally and physically burned out after work?
- Or just drained out by travelling back home from work?

🥲

Imagine you coming back home and your lover, wife, mother or even your dad, gives you a welcoming hug and hands you a hot cup of tea or a mug of cold coffee! 😍

A smile on their face, making you sit, asking you how was your day? Did you have food? All’s good? 😇

Imagine what just this little much of a gesture can do to your morale! 🥹

This may seem or sound “Just little”. But when you see it from the eyes of the person handing you the cup of tea, it’s UNCONDITIONAL. 🥰

Unconditional love 🫶 
Unconditional care 🤗

And “Just this much” can “Just make your day”! ❤️",1,1745857450.0,FeelingDown,0,1.0,False

Using them daily feels like second nature, nearing the point where they're a constant pocket companion. These earbuds pack an impressive punch for an affordable pair, marrying sleek design with practical features I didn’t know I needed. They claim all the right buzzwords: customizable sound, extended battery life, water resistance, and more—but the real test, obviously, is how they perform in everyday life.

**Sleek and Versatile Design**

The first thing that stood out to me was the design. Small, lightweight, and paired with a compact charging case, they’re super easy to carry around. It's a massive win for those of us who hate lugging bulky accessories everywhere. I appreciated the added lanyard, which came in handy during a beach walk when I didn’t want to shove the case into sandy shorts pockets. Their clean black finish gives off a subtle, professional vibe—I could definitely wear them during a work meeting or while running on the treadmill. The ergonomic fit surprised me—it doesn’t pinch my ears, even after hours of use, which is a rare feat.

**Good Points**

- Bluetooth 5.3 ensures a ridiculously smooth connection.  
- Portable, compact design makes them easy to tote without a second thought.  
- Comfortable, lightweight fit that doesn’t irritate during extended wear.  

[Check Soundcore A3948 price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b0btybvr4s/)

**Unpacking Battery Life**

Battery life is a significant draw here. A single charge gives up to 9 hours of playtime, which extends up to 28 hours when paired with the charging case. Honest confession? I’ve definitely pushed that 9-hour claim to its extreme when diving into a mix of podcasts and Spotify playlists during a road trip. And even when I forgot to recharge, a quick 10-minute charge gave me 2 precious extra hours of use. For someone constantly on the go (coffee shop hopping, late-night gaming sessions, or pretending to jog in the park), this charging speed is a lifesaver.

**Customized Sound Experience**

What really sold me, though, was the customization available via the Soundcore app. This thing offers 22 preset EQs, with options to tweak every aspect of sound to your liking. Experimenting with settings was addictive—I kept switching between BassUp (great for those bass-heavy tracks) and lighter tones for audiobooks. Admittedly, the presets are varied enough that most people won’t need to fuss with manual equalizers. You can also configure the touch controls for each earbud, which is oddly satisfying for control freaks like me.

**Drawbacks**

- No active noise cancellation, so external chatter can get distracting.  
- The touch controls are sensitive, and accidental taps are a common occurrence until you get the hang of placement.  

**AI-Enhanced Clear Calls**

Voice calls were smooth and clear, thanks to the AI-enhanced dual microphones. I used these for a couple of impromptu work Zoom calls while sitting at a crowded coffee shop, and my colleagues were none the wiser—it handles environmental noise impressively well. That said, don’t expect miracles in overwhelmingly loud surroundings; voices may occasionally sound slightly distant.

**Rain or Sweat: It's Waterproof!**

The waterproof rating is nifty; wearing them during a drizzle or intense workout session posed no issues. They shrugged off my sweaty gym sessions without skipping a beat. It’s like having a “ready-for-anything” buddy in earbud form. However, while they resist water, they don't quite survive a dunk in the pool—lesson learned after one clumsy bathroom accident. 

**Competitive Options**

Comparing these earbuds to similar models like Apple’s AirPods or Samsung’s Galaxy Buds, there are noticeable trade-offs. While AirPods may have sleeker integration with iOS and better active noise cancellation, the Soundcore earbuds deliver approximately 80% of the experience for a fraction of the price. They also have better battery longevity in my experience. Samsung Galaxy Buds offer slightly better sound balancing, but they’re bulkier compared to Soundcore’s ultra-light design. Overall, for casual users or anyone with a tighter budget, these shine brightly in comparison.

**Quality for Price**

Looking at the feature set—28-hour playtime, Bluetooth 5.3 stability, customizable EQ presets—it feels like you’re getting an absolute steal. While dedicated audiophiles may splurge on higher-end products, these earbuds offer an incredible bang for casual listeners. They’re more than sufficient for phone calls, music, podcasts, and even Netflix binges. Since prices fluctuate online, I’d recommend hopping over to Amazon to snag a deal before it’s gone.

I’ve never posted anything like this before, but after everything that happened, I can’t keep it to myself anymore.
Maybe writing it down will help me make sense of it.
Maybe it’ll just make it worse. I don’t know.

About four months ago, I moved into a small rental house just outside town. It wasn’t anything fancy — two bedrooms, old carpet, leaky faucet — but it was cheap and I needed a fresh start.
The landlord barely said two words during the walkthrough.
He handed me the keys, told me to ""stay out of the attic,"" and left.

I didn’t think much of it at the time.

The first few weeks were uneventful. I worked during the day, unpacked at night, and slowly made the place feel like home.
It was... lonely, sure.
The neighbors kept to themselves.
Sometimes I felt like I was the only person on the whole street.

About three weeks in, I found the first note.

It was a Sunday afternoon. I was rearranging the kitchen cabinets, trying to figure out a better place for my coffee mugs.
When I pulled out a dusty stack of paper plates left by the previous tenant, something fluttered out and landed on the counter.

A piece of yellow lined paper, folded twice.

No envelope. No signature.

Inside, written in shaky black ink:

""DON'T TRUST THE WALLS.""



That’s all it said.

No explanation. No context.

At first, I laughed it off. Probably a leftover joke from the last person who lived here. Some bored teenager, maybe.
Still, something about the handwriting made my stomach twist.
It was messy but deliberate, like whoever wrote it had been in a hurry... or scared.

I tossed it in the trash and didn’t think about it again.


The second note showed up three days later.

This time, it was tucked into the bathroom mirror frame — a tiny piece of paper folded so small I almost missed it.

Written in the same shaky hand:

""It watches when you sleep.""



Now, I was creeped out.

I’d cleaned that bathroom top to bottom when I moved in.
There was no way I missed a piece of paper stuck behind the mirror.

I checked every cabinet, every drawer, every closet in the house after that.
Nothing else.
For a while.



Then the dreams started.

I don’t remember most of them.
Just flashes:
Standing in the hallway.
Hearing soft tapping from inside the walls.
Seeing something long and thin move just out of the corner of my eye.

When I’d wake up, the house would be silent.
Except once — around 3:17 AM — when I swear I heard whispering through the bedroom vent.

Words I couldn’t understand.
But they sounded... wrong. Like someone imitating human speech without fully knowing how.


Last night, I found the third note.

It wasn’t hidden this time.
It was sitting right in the middle of my bed when I came home from work.

Bigger paper this time. Full-sized. And the message was longer:

""The cracks aren’t cracks. They’re mouths.""



I don’t know if I should stay here anymore.
But the worst part is...
I checked the front door.

Still locked.

Windows, locked too.

Nobody could’ve gotten inside.

At least, nobody I could see.

**What is Death and Reborn for newcomers?**

**Death and Reborn is an alternative universe to Ongezellig, using elements from the series, the Mayamails and the comic Maya Sweet 16 to create a sequel to Ongezellig.**

**Synopsis: Following a harmless word from Coco, Maya explodes in anger and hits her sister, telling her how much she hates her. Riddled with remorse, Maya decides to commit suicide the following night by cutting her wrists. Saved by Coco just in time, she is placed in an induced coma in hospital, leaving the Schoppenboer family and her classmates in shock. After two days, Maya woke up and went to a mental health institute for troubled teenagers. There, Maya was finally able to talk to a therapist about her unhappiness and work on her social anxiety and ADHD. While in hospital, Maya made her first friends. As time went by, Maya felt more at ease and began to mend fences with her family, especially Coco.**

**This tragic event changed the lives of several Ongezellig characters, who you'll discover in my various fanfictions.**

**AU Death and Reborn is a story that is close to the atmosphere of Mayamail or Maya Sweet 16, dark and sad but with a message of hope. And sometimes even moments of joy.**

**BAD MOTHER – Part 2**

***March 2002.***

*Soei was eagerly waiting for her boyfriend, Ravi, who was supposed to arrive at her place in just a few minutes.*  
*They had known each other for just under two years, ever since a college party. Ravi was 23 at the time, Soei was 20. They had clicked instantly, started dating, and soon fell in love.*  
*They didn’t live together yet, but it was something they were planning. Soei was still a university student, while Ravi had just entered the workforce.*

*The doorbell rang, it was Ravi. He was relieved to finally hear from his girlfriend; she hadn’t replied to his messages for several days.*  
*Soei opened the door. They kissed, but Ravi immediately noticed that Soei seemed anxious.*

“***What’s going on? You haven’t contacted me for days, and then suddenly you asked me to come over as soon as possible. And now you look worried.****”*  
*“****I’ll explain everything... Do you want some coffee?****”*

*Ravi nodded and sat down on a chair, leaning against the table. A few minutes later, Soei came back with two cups of hot drink and sat down across from him.*

“***Ravi... I have to tell you something… I’m pregnant. Six weeks.****”*

*Ravi was shocked by the news. A long silence followed.*  
*Then he finally spoke, hesitantly:*  
*“****But… we were using protection…****”*

“***I know, and I was careful too… But like they say, contraception is never 100% effective. We’re part of the exception...****”*

*Another silence settled. Ravi took a sip of coffee, then asked:*  
*“****And… what do you want to do?****”*

*Soei took a few seconds to gather her thoughts, then said:*  
*“****I’ve thought about it… and I want to keep the baby. I’ve felt love for this little being growing inside me. I know it won’t be easy: I’m still a student, I live in a studio apartment… But I want to give them life. And all the love I can.****”*

*Ravi smiled at these tender words, but anxiety crept back in. His girlfriend was still studying, and he had only just started working.*

*Soei continued:*  
*“****Ravi… The reason I asked you to come is also to ask you something. Do you feel ready… to become a father?****”*

*Ravi took some time to think, then answered:*  
*“****Honey, I love you, and that’s not going to change. This child you’re carrying… they’re mine too. And I also want to give them love and an upbringing.****”*

“***But we need to be realistic,”*** *he added*\*\*\*. “We’ll have to get organized: find an apartment for the three of us, change our lifestyle, and think about things we’ve never had to before...\*\*\**”*

*That’s how Soei and Ravi made a promise to become a family.*  
*The following months were tough. Ravi found a one-bedroom apartment in Baarle, on the Dutch side, which allowed Soei to continue her studies in Tilburg, not far from there.*  
*He took on a second part-time job to provide for their future family. From that day on, he never stopped working, sometimes to the point of exhaustion, out of love for his partner and their unborn child.*

*On September 21, 2002, without warning, Soei’s water broke. An ambulance came to take her to the hospital in Tilburg, but the staff quickly realized that labor had already started.*  
*Soei gave birth in her own room.*

*Maya was born.*  
*(This is why her official documents state that she was born in Baarle, even though the town has no hospital.)*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**A Sunday in March 2019**

The weather was cold and misty. Soei woke up late, having gone to bed in the middle of the night after a long discussion with her husband. It was already 11 a.m., which was unusual for her.

She got up, put on her dressing gown, and stepped out of her bedroom. She noticed some noise coming from Maya's room. Curious, she approached and found her two adoptive daughters, Coco and Mymy, inside.

""**Good morning, girls. What are you doing in your sister's room?**"" questioned Soei

""**Good morning, Mum! We thought it would be a nice surprise for her return if we cleaned her room. It was messy, and I think she'll feel better in a clean and tidy space**,"" replied Coco.

""**That's very kind of you. I'm sure she'll appreciate it.**"" congratulated Soei

Soei kissed both her daughters on the forehead, then her gaze fell upon Maya's old stuffed toy. She picked it up.

""**Maybe I should help by washing this good old toy... It smells a bit... odd, to be honest,**"" she thought.

She went downstairs to put it in the washing machine. Upon reaching the ground floor, she found Ravi dusting the living room.

""**Oh! Darling! Are you feeling better? Did you sleep well?**"" greeted Ravi

""**A bit better, yes. I did sleep a lot.**"" replied Soei

""**Would you like a hot drink?**"" proposed Ravi

""**Yes, a mint tea, please. That's kind of you.**"" thanked her

While he was boiling water in the kitchen, Ravi said:

""**I see you came down with Maya's stuffed toy.**""

""**Yes. I thought it was time to wash it. It's probably been ages since it was last cleaned.**""

Soei went to the washing machine to place Maya's toy inside and started the wash cycle.

Ravi poured the hot water into a cup, added a mint tea bag, and handed it to his wife.

She thanked him before changing the subject:

""**We're still leaving at 2 p.m. to see Maya, right?**"" she asked.

""**Yes, that's fine with me. We'll just need to hurry to finish the cleaning and prepare the meal.**"" Ravi replied

""**Alright. I'll quickly finish my tea, help you with the cleaning, then I'll go wash up while you prepare the food. Does that work for you?**"" concludes Soei

Ravi nodded.

Soei was keen for the whole family to be present that afternoon to visit Maya. She wanted to show her that she wasn't alone and that they didn't blame her after what she had shared the previous day.

The Schoppenboer family arrived at the hospital as planned. Hearts remained heavy after recent events, but everyone was relieved to see Maya alive and in relatively good health.

However, Maya felt uncomfortable. Her social anxiety was still present. She regretted opening her heart to her family, feeling that she had hurt them. She was ashamed of her suicide attempt and the pain she had caused. She remained silent throughout the afternoon.

Soei was saddened by the situation, reflecting again on her unplanned pregnancy and the decision to keep the baby. She had hoped to give her child a joyful life, and 16 years later, she realized the suffering her daughter endured to the point of wanting to end the life that had been given to her.

On Monday, Soei and Ravi returned to the hospital. They didn't want to leave Maya alone with her demons. They discussed the next steps: her hospitalization in a mental health institution.

Maya was a bit more talkative this time. She had questions: could she go home before leaving for the institution? Soei said yes, they would need to prepare her things for the next day.

The following day, Soei and Ravi took a day off to take care of their daughter. They started with a final medical check-up at the hospital: everything was fine, Maya could be discharged.

On the way home, the atmosphere was gloomy. Maya remained distant.

But a small sign of hope appeared: upon discovering her clean and tidy room, she also noticed her freshly washed stuffed toy, still smelling of detergent. She hugged it tightly and sniffed it for a long time, as if rediscovering it. A shy smile appeared on her face, the first since she woke up.

Packing was done in a strange atmosphere. Soei and Maya found it hard to talk. The mother looked at her daughter for a moment and thought: ""***I think you must hate me... and you have your reasons. I didn't give you life under optimal conditions... and then I remember... the first months were complicated for both of us... that must have left marks on you.***""

Later, at the institution, Soei, Ravi, and Maya attended a meeting with the healthcare team. They were informed about the planned treatment, the medications that would be prescribed, and the possible side effects. They were warned that Maya would probably sleep a lot at first, and her activities would be adapted to her condition.

The team also provided examples of activities planned during the stay, as well as classes to help her keep up with her studies.

To conclude, the therapist and psychiatrist introduced themselves. Soei felt reassured; she had a feeling that her daughter would be in good hands.

Upon leaving the office, they found Coco and Mymy waiting for them in the hallway. Together, they headed to Maya's new room.

There, they met Anna, her future roommate, a teenage girl with anorexia. She greeted Maya warmly:

""**Hoi Maya! I'm Anna, your 'roomie'. Nice to meet you!**""

""**H-hoi...**"" stammered Maya, surprised by the welcome.

Then came the time for goodbyes. Maya said goodbye to Coco and Mymy, who wished her a full recovery. Then it was Ravi's turn, who told her he would think of her every day.

Finally, Soei approached. She made a gesture of affection not seen in years: she hugged her daughter tightly and whispered in her ear: ""**I love you. You're strong. I know you'll get through this**."" She kissed her tenderly on the cheek. Maya seemed surprised but pleasantly so.

The farewells were difficult. Soei, unwilling to let go of her daughter, finally resigned herself to leaving her in the hands of professionals who would try to heal her distress.

Back in the car, she watched the institution fade into the distance, gradually disappearing from view. Another separation between mother and daughter had just taken place.

**When night came, Soei was once again lost in her thoughts.**

Lying in bed, she was ruminating over Maya’s birth and her first year of life.

*""I understand why you're suffering, my daughter... given the difficulty of the life I gave you... ...Perhaps... I would have loved you more if you had been planned for, if I had given you better living conditions. We couldn't have found anything better than that cramped two-room apartment in Baarle. Ravi had to work twice as hard to support us. And I was focused on my studies. The three of us slept in the same room; those short nights exhausted us all. I had to manage my last year of university, fatigue, and the baby all at once to give you a future...""*

*Soei recalled that terrible year, before a buried memory resurfaced.*

*""...Then my postpartum depression hit. I was crushed by guilt, exhaustion, and I already considered myself a bad mother... I didn't know how to give you the love I had promised you."" And one day, I broke down. I preferred to put my studies first. I left you with my parents for over a month, when you needed us to bond.""*

*A few silent tears fell from Soei's eyes.*

*""...I succeeded in my studies, but at what cost? I set such high standards for myself that I passed them on to my children. I put success before well-being. And that wasn't what you expected of me...""*

*She paused for a moment in her thoughts before continuing.*

*""...this ordeal had left its mark on us, especially on you. I damaged the bond between us. I noticed your socialization problems, especially at nursery school. And then I stupidly thought that conceiving a second child, a desired one this time, could bring us closer...""*

*Her thoughts stopped abruptly.*

*""No... I don't want to go back to this project, I've already suffered too much.""*

*She turned to look at her husband, who was already asleep.*

*""...In the end, you're right... We have to change. We have to put their well-being first. I hope it's not too late for you, Maya...""*

The Schoppenboer family went to see Maya every weekend.

The first time was difficult: Maya, under the effects of medication, was in a dazed state. The visit was cut short to let her rest. Nevertheless, it marked the start of a new tradition that Soei would establish: hugging her daughter. That first time, despite her state, Maya responded to the gesture and hugged her mother back as best she could.

Soei and Ravi kept regular contact with the medical team, who reported Maya’s first signs of progress: her participation in activities and adherence to the treatment.

Subsequent visits confirmed this progress: Maya seemed less exhausted and looked healthier. She even started talking about her activities at the institution, at first briefly. But even the simple act of recounting her week, however briefly, was a major victory for someone who used to remain completely silent in front of her parents. As the weeks went by, Maya began to share more details, although she remained discreet about the content of her therapy.

Each visit from the Schoppenboer family came with two traditions: the first, offering a bag of ***kruidnoten***; the second, a long hug between Soei and Maya. A sign of a budding new mother-daughter relationship.

At the same time, the family was redecorating Maya’s bedroom to make it brighter and more cheerful. New shelves were installed, along with lights and neon fixtures. And when Maya would return home, they planned to decide together on how to decorate the walls.

Everything seemed to be getting better for Soei and Ravi, until May 4th, 2019.  
A phone call.  
From the police station in Baarle-Hertog, Belgium.  
Mymy had decided, in her own way, to unify Baarle-Nassau and Baarle-Hertog under the Dutch flag.  
They had to go pick her up.

Despite the diplomatic incident she caused, Mymy received only a warning.  
But it was the last straw for Soei, who already knew some of her adoptive daughter’s ""exploits.""

So, after punishing her, Soei decided to send Mymy to a therapist too. Because she was seeing Maya's progress. But more importantly, because she didn’t want Mymy to have even bigger problems in the future.

A few days later, good news arrived at the Schoppenboer home: Maya had made enough progress to return home on weekends.  
The whole family pitched in to welcome her back.

**Friday, May 10, 2019**

The afternoon was drawing to a close. Soei had been waiting for this moment for several days. She left for the psychiatric institute with Ravi, Coco, and Mymy. Tonight, Maya would be home again. For the first time in over a month.

Once they arrived, they checked in at the front desk and waited for Maya to come out. She appeared two minutes later, dragging a suitcase full of clothes to wash.

Soei immediately took her daughter into her arms, hugging her tightly before saying: ""**I'm so happy you're with us this weekend.**""

Ravi followed suit, then Coco and Mymy.

Back at home, Maya discovered the changes made to her room while she was away. She thanked her family for the gesture (even though she seemed inwardly uncomfortable, she hadn’t asked for anything because she felt she didn’t deserve that much attention).

That evening, they decided to go out to a restaurant. It was an opportunity to see how much Maya had improved: her appetite was back, and she was eating with enthusiasm. She was even a little more talkative than usual, sharing stories about her week at the institute.

The next morning, Soei was the first to wake up and started preparing breakfast. She wanted to treat her daughters to some warm stroopwafels. Ravi soon joined her to take care of the drinks, both hot and cold.

Mymy came down first, quickly followed by Coco. “**Well, I see Maya’s kept her old habits, she’s the last one still in bed,**” Ravi remarked jokingly. “**No,**” Coco replied. “**I saw her go into the bathroom.**”

At those words, Soei’s anxiety returned. It was the first time her biological daughter had been alone in the bathroom since her suicide attempt.

She immediately went upstairs and stood in front of the door. “**Maya? Are you there? Everything okay?**” The answer came quickly: “**Yes, don’t worry, Mom. I’m just finishing up. I’ll be down in a few minutes.**”

Relieved, Soei returned to the kitchen, where her daughter soon joined her. Clean, and in good spirits.

The family shared breakfast, then lunch, continuing the pleasant start to the day.

After the meal, the three sisters did the dishes together. Once that chore was done, Mymy went back to her room, still grounded, while Coco got ready to meet up with Cleo, Yfke, and Zoey for a band rehearsal.

As for Maya, she didn’t lock herself in her room for the rest of the day. She sat down on the couch, grabbed the remote, and looked for something to watch. Ravi sat in the living room armchair and said: “**I barely recognize you. It’s been ages since I last saw you here watching TV… What are you in the mood to watch?**”

“**Uuuh… I don’t know yet. I’ll see what catches my interest.**” wondered her daughter

Eventually, Maya landed on a channel playing reruns of popular American sitcoms.

Seeing her like that, Soei felt it was the right time to strengthen their mother-daughter bond. She went to get the family photo album, thinking about a promise she had made to herself: to look through it again with Maya, just the two of them, once she was doing better.

With the album in hand, she sat down next to her daughter: “**Maya, would you like to look through our old family photos together? Maybe remember some good times?**”

“**Of course, Mom. Come sit,**” Maya replied, surprised but happy about the idea.

She made room for her mother to sit beside her. Together, they slowly turned the pages of the album, commenting on memories. Soei would sometimes add context: “**The first picture we took together after you came home. Our little apartment in Baarle… where you were born.**”

\[…\]

“**Your first day of preschool! You had such a hard time leaving me, I still remember your tears. It was tough for you. I think it took around ten days before you started to feel more at ease.**”

\[…\]

“**You and… Noga… Do you want to skip this one?**”

Soei took the matter of Noga, the family’s former cat, very seriously. She remembered it had been one of the roots of Maya’s distress: the fact that the cat had to be given away to other relatives because of Coco’s allergy, and had died a few months earlier.

“**No, Mom, it’s okay. Can I hold the photo?**”

Maya took the picture out of the album and looked at it for a long moment. Soei, meanwhile, focused on her daughter’s reaction.

**“*****Je bent allergisch?*****”**

That sentence, spoken by Soei to her second adopted daughter ten years ago, would forever alter the fate of the Schoppenboer family. What would have happened if the situation had been reversed, if Coco hadn’t been allergic? It probably wouldn’t have erased all of Maya’s problems, but she would’ve had stronger emotional support at home. Maybe she would’ve felt less resentment toward Coco, maybe she would’ve opened up more… Maybe she wouldn’t have seen Coco as the one who took her cat away, but as a sister.

But fate had decided otherwise. What seemed back then to be a difficult but acceptable temporary choice turned into a deep trauma for Maya. From that moment on, she began to think that Mymy and Coco were there to replace her, that she was being erased from the family, starting with Noga.

“**Mom? Mom, are you listening? Can I keep this photo of Noga and me?**” wished Maya.

Soei snapped out of her thoughts and replied: “**Uh… What? Of course. If it helps to have a memory of Noga, you can keep it.**”

Then came a more cheerful photo: the one of Maya’s tenth birthday present. The famous Blobfish plushie. Soei remembered the day they bought it perfectly. She was with her daughters at Intertoys. Maya had slipped away between the aisles and found the plushie section. She looked at each one until she fell in love with the Blobfish.

Soei thought her daughter’s choice was odd—that fish wasn’t exactly the cutest, but Maya clearly found it very comforting. In the end, she was convinced when she saw Maya hugging it tightly.

Soei kept flipping through the pages of the album. Gradually, an unease settled again. Maya’s smile grew sadder and eventually disappeared completely in the later photos.

“**Maya… you know… looking at your photos last time, I saw how unhappy you were… and I feel guilty for not noticing sooner. I’m your mother. I should have seen it, I should have done something…**”

“**Mom… don’t blame yourself. I think even if you had realized earlier that something was wrong, I wouldn’t have been able to open up to you.**”

Once they reached the end of the album, Maya relaxed, lay down on the couch, and rested her head on her mother’s lap. The gesture brought memories back to Soei. Maya used to do that when she was little. She saw it as a sign of trust, their bond was slowly rebuilding.

Soei gently stroked her daughter’s hair and began to hum:

**“Maya bobok, Maya bobok.**  
**Kalau tidak bobok digigit nyamuk.**  
**Mari, nona, Maya puas saya.**  
**Kalau tidak bobok digigit nyamuk.”** (1)

“**Ma… Mom? It’s been so long since you last sang that to me!**”

Soei smiled and replied softly: “**Yes… You remember? »**

It was the Indonesian lullaby that Soei's grandmother had taught her, and which she sang to Maya before going to sleep.

Maya was touched by the gesture. They stayed like that for a long time, before moving on to something else.

The next day, the family came over to see Maya for the first time since her hospitalization. For once, it was she who received congratulations, while Mymy was gently teased, and even slightly scolded, for her failed invasion of Baarle.

Soei noticed that her daughter wasn’t entirely comfortable with so many people in the house, but she also saw that Maya had stayed present throughout the entire visit. It was another sign of progress.

In the end, the weekend passed too quickly. But Soei would remember it as one of the most beautiful moments she had shared with her biological daughter. For the first time in a long time, a real connection had formed between them. After all, not everything was lost for Maya. She just needed to be shown that she was loved.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The following week was even better for the Schoppenboers.

First, Saturday seemed to mark the beginning of a bond forming between Maya and Mymy. Soei learned that they had spent a long time in Mymy’s room playing together and talking for quite a while. By the end of the day, they seemed closer.

But the best moment came on Sunday: Coco invited Maya to go for a bike ride. Soei was surprised to see her biological daughter leave the house with Coco of her own free will. And a few hours later, she could tell that a certain complicity had formed between the two sisters. The mother didn’t know what had happened, but she was delighted by this reconciliation. She began to believe that her family might actually be able to rebuild things with Maya.

The weeks went by, and Maya’s mental health visibly improved. Around mid-June, an important meeting took place with the medical team. Soei was thrilled to hear the encouraging words of the therapist and the psychiatrist, who praised Maya’s participation in workshops, and especially the fact that she had finally made some friends. Maya would now be able to spend a month in the day hospital, coming home each evening, before returning to a normal life.

On the way back, in the car, Soei started the conversation:  
“**Maya? The medical team told us that you made some friends?**”

“**Oh? Yes? Oh right! I made some friends there… First, there’s Anna, the person I share a room with. Then I got along well with Bram, who already knew Anna, and… um… Arno, who is… a friend… I met through Bram.**”

“**That’s wonderful. I’m really glad you made some friends there.**”

Maya responded with a smile, happy to see her mother so pleased. A short silence followed, then Maya asked:  
“**Mom? Dad? Would it be possible for them to come over one day? Maybe for a weekend?**”

Soei turned to her daughter, who was sitting in the back seat.  
“**Yes, of course. I’d be delighted to have them over and get to know them.**”

Maya answered with a beaming smile, the kind Coco often wore.

The hospitalization had gone even better than expected.  
One of the symbols of this success was the reconciliation between the sisters: Coco and Mymy even gave Maya two bracelets.

A few weeks later, Soei met Anna, her daughter’s former roommate. Anna made an excellent impression on her throughout the weekend, and Soei was happy that her daughter had finally found someone to spend time with.

But the relationship between Soei and Maya would soon be put to the test.

It was Sunday, August 4th.

The Schoppenboer family had spent the day at the beach. On the way home, Soei and Maya headed to the kitchen, thirsty.

Soei poured her daughter a soda, and they started chatting about trivial things.

After a moment of silence, Maya timidly asked:  
“**Mom… There’s something I’ve always wanted to ask you… but never dared…**”

“**Yes? What is it, sweetheart?**” listened Soei

“**Well… I’ve been thinking about Coco and Mymy… I was wondering… um… why did you adopt them? I know you didn’t adopt them to replace me. But I’d really like to know why. And also, why adoption?**”

Soei immediately felt uncomfortable.

She had known that, sooner or later, Maya would ask this question.

Because it brought her back to a very painful moment in her life.

Overwhelmed by emotion, Soei replied in a confused voice, tinged with sadness and anger:  
“**MAYA! Why would you ask that…? You know it hurts me, don’t you? Why are you being so intrusive?**”

But Soei quickly pulled herself together. After all, Maya’s question was innocent, without any hidden motive. She was just curious and eager to understand why Mymy and Coco had come into their lives.

As Soei opened her mouth to reassure her daughter, she realized the damage was already done when she saw Maya’s reaction.

“**Ma… mom… I’m sorry… I’m so sorry! I didn’t mean to hurt you! I swear!**”  
Maya’s breathing became faster and more intense.

Her body began to tremble.

Soei understood immediately.

Maya was having a panic attack.

(1) Maya, sleep, Maya, sleep.

If you don’t sleep, a mosquito will bite you.

Come, young lady, Maya, make me happy.

If you don’t sleep, a mosquito will bite you.

This is an Indonesian lullaby called *""Nina Bobok,""* in which a girl named Nina is told to sleep before she gets bitten by a mosquito. In this version, the name Nina has been replaced with Maya.
