It would do this based on a few general measurements performed with a specific combination of grinder and coffee beans.

The idea is that I want to change the grind size slightly to optimize my brewing. Then I want an estimate of the expected grind time needed in order to get my desired amount of coffee.

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ih78ze,https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddytrailblazer/comments/1ih78ze/wrote_up_how_each_hsr_girl_smells/,Wrote up how each HSR girl smells,"**March 7th:** Most of the time its very, very floral perfume. The kind that the most girly girl would like. However,  she has a very noticeable sweaty musk when she's in Hunt form. She trains alot and doesn't always have the time to take a shower and she doesn't spray perfume at times like that. Because of her dedication, she also doesn't wash her Xianzhou outfit as much as she should and it defintely has a sweaty smell, especially around the pits. What she tries to hide is that she's naturally a very sweaty person, despit her ice affinty and the pit stains while in Hunt form are very noticeable and the lack of washing has caused the smell to build up. So you either get the sweetest, most flowery smelling girly girl or a very musky sweat.

**Himeko:** Mainly coffee but also the faint smell of the scented candles she has around her room. For as much of a coffee lover as she is, she also loves the ambiance that the candles bring so they're almost always lit, so the smell has kinda drifted off onto her. Pleasant but at the same time, because of the coffee, there is a chance of teh bad coffee breath.

**Doll Herta**: Mix of oil, rubber, and slightly rotten wood. Mainly rubber since her ""skin"" is made out of a rubber like substance but  you can also smell the cheap wood that the puppets are made out of (Rubber skin over wooden frame) - cheap because she mass produced so many puppets and she's not the best with money (Leaves that to Asata). When she's damaged or working really hard, you can smell the oil.

**Asta:** Honestly depends on what she's doing. She obviously wants to smell good and you would expect a rich person like her to splurge on the nicest smelling perfumes and soaps but since she doesn't try to flaunt her wealth, she gets what she thinks is normal-nice soap and just forgoes perfume of any kind. Because of that and the fact that she is usually busy running the Herta Station, she often gets pretty sweaty and you can run into her having a bit of BO from time to time, especially since she uses cheap deodorant that doesn't last, which, combinded with the fact that her uniform is sleeveless, is a recipe to get a whiff. She tries to smell good and, to her credit, she does freshen up a bit more when she goes on vacation with Topaz but she can easily go the other way. Can be pretty and girly smelling but just as often can be a bit sweaty and smelly.

**Kafka:** Bath bombs before she starts work - she spends alot of time bathing, as evident by the Fermata LC. However, she can smell a bit gunpowdery after ""work"". Smells nice and pleasant, which you wouldn't expect, considering her company being a dead guy and two other people that will be expanded upon later. Smells of fresh roses.

**Silver Wolf:** Gamer gremlin girl has the stereotypical gamer smell: Sweat and very bad BO. Very musky but doesn't care at all - cares so little, in fact, that the only reason she's even allowed to wear shorts is because Kafka forces her to shave her legs (otherwise her game accounts would be taken if she went out with hairy legs). Doesn't bathe often (Mainly when Kafka puts her foot down and forces her to) and just gets her clothes from a pile on the floor so they aren't often washed - often not a big deal for her because she almost never goes outside and mainly just uses her hologram. Doesn't own a single stick of deodorant - sweaty pit stains are common on her.

It basically asks you questions about your partner (like what they're into, their hobbies, whether they're more practical or sentimental, etc.) and suggests specific gifts based on their personality. All the recommendations are handpicked - no generic ""best gifts for her/him"" lists.

Some stuff it's helped my friends find:

* A custom star map for my buddy's astronomy-obsessed girlfriend
* This really cool coffee roasting kit for someone's coffee snob husband
* A vintage-style record player for a music lover (that wasn't crazy expensive)

1ih73cy,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucksbaristas/comments/1ih73cy/dear_brian_niccols/,Dear Brian Niccols:,"I believe there may be a ""lost in translation moment"" in the interpretation of customer feedback.

I have heard many customers and baristas echo the statement, pretty overwhelmingly in fact: ""I miss the days when Starbucks wrote on cups.""

Getting back to Starbucks definitely does involve those cup writing days. But it wasn't the writing on cups specifically, it was the era and the atmosphere of those times.

During that time, we didn't have sticker printers for the drinks. We didn't have mobile orders, deliveries, or even drive thrus.

""I miss the days that Starbucks wrote on cups"" refers to the feeling of visiting a coffee shop, ordering at a register, and having a conversation with a human being.

The sticker printers ushered in a new era of impersonal interaction. Cup writing became obsolete. Stickers printed out and it might be the customer that just ordered at register, or it might be a person 5 miles away on their app. 

Seeing printers spit out stickers, the barista rushing to package delivery orders, place mobiles on a handoff plane so th no customer having yet arrived, all while waiting for the drink you ordered at the register is the interruption that hinders that ""Starbucks feeling"" that we all want to get back to.

Writing a message on every cup, is not a supplement for the impersonal transaction that the sticker machines, mobile ordering, drive-thru speed, and deliveries create. 

So while I understand that ""writing on every cup"" may feel like it adds a personal touch, the cup writing that is currently mandated does not reflect what customers and baristas were actually asking for.

""I miss the days that Starbucks wrote on cups"" does not translate to ""I wish my cup were written on.""

It translates to:

""I miss the days when I was treated like a human being, Starbucks had no stocker machines, and my humanity was not reduced to a slip of paper that is spit out from a machine.""

Please do bring us ""back to Starbucks.""

The most effective way to do so, woukd ne to eliminate mobile ordering, deliveries, and the sticker printers altogether.

This may not seem like it's feasible since they are so integrated. 

But mobiles and eliviroes are the number one interruption to our ability to provide good service. They have been since day one of their implementation.

The fact that baristas have been repeating this pretty much unanimously for years, and recently you are quoted as saying that the mobile ordering system needs to be revisited for this reason, is a punctuation mark on how the corporate culture does not listen to the voice of store level employees. 

As a 20 year employee who lives the opportunity to create genuine joy through my work, I invite you to sit with me for a coffee tasting. I'd love to connect over coffee, and chat about the good ol days that we can Gen get back to in a positive and constructive way. I do believe that the location of my home store woukd not be too inconvenient for you to visit, and I'd welcome the opportunity to be a part of getting back to Starbucks in a meaningful way.

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this whole thing.

1ih72lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ih72lg/rewrite_for_all_those_we_cannot_save/,(Rewrite) For all those we cannot save,"A knock on my cabin door interrupts my solitude.


Separating myself from my coffee, I grab my uniform jacket and head towards the door, calling out, ‚ÄúWho is it?‚Äù


‚ÄúEnsign Smith, sir. We received a signal.‚Äù
Opening the door, I continue ahead of the enlisted crewman. ‚ÄúWhat do you have for me?‚Äù


‚ÄúNot much, sir,‚Äù came the voice from behind. ‚ÄúWe received it a couple of minutes ago, and I immediately left the bridge to get you.‚Äù


Arriving on the bridge, I take in a quick scan of my crew working diligently. ‚ÄúSignals, what have you got for me?‚Äù


‚ÄúAudio and visual transmission, sir. About 45 seconds long before it cuts out.‚Äù


‚ÄúPut it on screen,‚Äù I command as I take my place in the center of the deck.


Sounds of blaster fire fill the deck, static giving way to an alien face shouting to be heard over the sounds of a battle raging on around them. An explosion nearby causes the figure to flinch and move the camera, allowing me to catch a glimpse of a soldier of our enemy entering a doorway. A few more moments of shouting before the transmission is cut. 

In the deafening silence of the deck, I am transported back by the voice of my senior signals crewman. ‚ÄúThat's everything we have, sir.‚Äù


Immediately, I begin formulating plans and possible outcomes. ‚ÄúDo we have a lock on the location yet?‚Äù


‚ÄúNot yet, sir. We should in a couple of minutes.‚Äù


‚ÄúAs soon as you do, send a probe. I want everything we can get on that planet.‚Äù 

Turning to the other side of the command deck, ‚ÄúLinguistics, anything?‚Äù


‚ÄúNot much, sir. It's not long enough for us to build anything solid. There are some similarities in pattern to a few other races, but that could just be coincidence.‚Äù


‚ÄúWe have a lock, and the probe is en route, sir. ETA is 13 hours,‚Äù came a voice from my signals crew.


Spinning on my heels, I turn my attention back to signals. ‚ÄúGood. As soon as we begin getting data, I want it sent to my terminal and notified.‚Äù


I then retire to quarters. I hate the delay of space. Fidgeting in front of my crew is a bad look, so I always await news in my personal living area. I am pacing when a rapid knock on my cabin door derails my train of thought.


Another ensign, out of breath, ‚ÄúWe're receiving data, sir.‚Äù


I don't wait for the ensign as I swiftly make my way to the command deck. As I enter through the door, I immediately look to my crew and approach my terminal. ‚ÄúIntel, what do you have for me?‚Äù


‚ÄúEnemy presence confirmed. Standard array of 3 Juggernauts, 5 Battle-cruisers, 2 Carriers, and planet-stripping layout. Standard large garden planet, sentient native race, just coming into their industrial time frame by the looks of some of the untouched places yet. Must have stumbled upon them. Interestingly, the planet was on our radar to be checked out for the possibility of life, but wasn't on the docket for another few months.‚Äù


‚ÄúGood work.‚Äù I nod and turn my attention homeward. ‚ÄúCommunications, open up a channel to the council for me.‚Äù


A few minutes later, I am face to face with the council representative of all listening outposts. ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, this is Colonel Loprey of Paynal Station. We have received a transmission requiring immediate attention. Enemy presence confirmed already on planet. I am sending you everything I have.‚Äù


‚ÄúUnderstood, Colonel. I will take this to the council immediately. Thank you.‚Äù


After a few hours attempting to sleep, I give up fighting my racing mind and drag my exhausted body from my bed. After showering and putting on a fresh uniform, I decide to head to the bridge. Leaving my doorway, I see a young ensign shuffling down the hall with the look of a dog with its tail tucked between its legs.


Realizing the new presence in the hallway, the ensign stops and stammers, ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I'm sorry, sir. The council has denied your request for action.‚Äù


Rushing to my terminal on the command deck, I open up a message from the councilwoman.

*‚ÄúI'm sorry, commander. We can't save everyone.‚Äù


I look up, scanning my crew around the deck, looking for something, anything, an idea on how to proceed. A mix of solemn faces and those looking to distract themselves with continued focus on their work. I had heard rumors, transmissions getting to listening outposts too late, ships can't make it in time. Arriving to the smoldering ruins of planets or just as the last enemy ships leave the area. It happens, but I had hoped it wouldn't happen to me, my crew.


Just then, a large banner flashed up on the main screen. A still image from the transmission we received, ‚ÄúIf you receive this transmission, do not respond. The council has been notified. No action is to be taken.‚Äù


I stand up from leaning over my terminal. Squaring my shoulders, I clear my throat. ‚ÄúAlright, everyone. That's it. The council has made their decision. Archive the data. Unfortunately, we can't save them all. Shift leads, if anyone feels they'd like some extra time off to process this, they have my blessing.‚Äù


With that, I turn and proceed to my quarters with a very controlled and measured pace. Upon return, I collapse into my lounge chair and pick up my personal data pad.

---------------------------------------------------


A knock from an exterior door.
Odd. We all looked around and counted ourselves. Sure enough, all twenty-three of us were present. It was a mixed air of emotions because while our supply shipment was over a week late, the noise from the door sounded like none any of us had heard before. Not to mention that as far as we knew, we were the first of our species to make it this far south on our planet. Since the tardiness of our supplies, emotions have gone from annoyed, to upset, to concern and now genuine fear. Slowly rising from our seats and exchanging glances, the youngest of us managed to summon the courage to check the door. With a shriek, he flung the door wide open and stumbled backwards as six large creatures entered in, pointing weapons first at us and then our surroundings. The first one quickly raised his weapon supporting hand  in front of him and spread his digits apart. While he froze and stared at us, the other five spread around and searched our quarters as if searching for something. 


After a few moments, short barks came from the five searching our quarters and then the first one seemed to relax, putting his hand and weapon down and then removing his facial covers. From a pouch on his back he pulled a small pad and drug his finger along making strange markings. He turned the pad to us to reveal the markings and tapped under them twice. ""Willum"" a voice said from within the pad and their leader placed his hand on his chest. He repeated this again and then repeated the word himself. From there uneasy introductions were made. 


Then came the teaching of our language to the speaking pad. It began like teaching a small child but by the end of the day it was like speaking to one of our own. As progress was made, our unease lifted and we shared food with the aliens within our dwelling. It was quite perplexing, while two of them looked similar to Willum, the other two were clearly different species from Willum and each other. We took turns teaching the talking pad and during our break away from it we noticed that Willum and his crew seemed uneasy. Not hostile or impatient, just... uneasy. Like they knew more that they were unsure about sharing.
When we were done, Willum took the pad and wrote in his own language. Then turning the pad towards us, he tapped a square on the screen and his markings were translated to ours and the voice within spoke the words aloud! ""Hello, my name is Willum and this is my crew."" Then, Willum tapped a circle at the bottom of the screen and spoke in his own language and when he was done, he tapped it again. Again, the pad spoke in our language! ""We have come from beyond your star to rescue you.""


Immediately there was an eruption of questions and Willum raised both of his arms to settle the room. He spoke at length and explained the ancient race that had come to ravage our planet, the other races rescued from their planets which his two non-human crew members attested to, and the lack of time we had left. For a while he answered questions, but not all of them. He said we needed to spend the night processing our new fates. He told us to rest and that we'd reconvene in the morning. Rest, because he knew as well as we did that none of us would sleep that night. Except for his crew, which took shifts inside of their ship.


In the morning we gathered our personal belongings and squeezed into their ship. Willum showed us images of our planet from their probe above. Many of us cried as we watched the fires and smoke consuming our planet. We noted that the last populated port where we all gathered before leaving for this leg of our journey, seemed yet untouched. So it was there we landed. With our combined efforts, we convinced the townspeople of what had befallen our planet. Once we had settled everyone down and Willum had answered questions, he informed us that he and his crew would need a bigger ship. They told us to give them two days. Gather everything we could and prepare to leave. If they didn't return after two days, we could either flee to our research post in the south and pray, or go out swinging.


So we did what they asked. They took off on their ship and immediately the town was buzzing. The library and school were emptied of every book. Every single document and historical item gathered. Livestock gathered, fields and seeds prepared. Everything that could be packed, we did. On the evening of the second day, we all gathered in the town hall to discuss what to do next, when suddenly the ground shook beneath us and a low hum filled our ears. Outside in an empty field, a ship a great multitude larger than Willums set down. When the main ramp let down, Willum and his crew emerged with smiles on their faces and told us to load as quickly as we could. They assured us that we were safe temporarily and that the blood splattering their armor was *mostly* not theirs. Something about very lax ground security measures in uncontested space. 


With immense effort and surprising speed, we managed to squeeze everything we wanted onto the freighter. Somehow the humans had even managed to nose their ship in, and we packed our belongings right up alongside it. As soon as the last items were packed, buildings and people triple accounted for, we collapsed. Some did not rest the entire time we loaded the ship and were soon asleep atop crates and random home furnishings. With our anonymous approval, the humans did not miss a beat getting us into the air. We crowded view ports and watched as our burning world shrunk behind us. Many wailed, some sang farewells, one of the towns priests led prayers. 


After a while, when everyone had settled and most had slept, Willum came to us with news. Contact had been made with their grand council and arrangements were being made for us. We were heading to a station for a quarantine and to give them time to decide where we should go. Apparently, as soon as word got out what Willun and his crew had done for us, at least a dozen different races immediately offered to take us in. 


---------------------------------------------------


Sitting atop the human ship in the cargo bay, I saw one of the humans fidgeting with a map of our world on his speaking pad. After a bit, he had spread it out and began writing ‚Äú723rd G.H.O.S.T‚Äôs‚Äù above and ‚Äú.583067000001"" below it. When I asked him what it meant, he explained that 723rd is their unit. The lower number is for this being the 58th planet humans have encountered like this, 3,067 survivors - 000001 For all the ones we couldn‚Äôt save.

I wanted to figure out what had happened because we completely shoved the stuff under the rug. For two months. It hurt so much. She even stonewalled me at work, later apologizing for doing it saying she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to lose the chance of keeping me as a long term friend‚Äù. So I said, okay then let‚Äôs finally talk about it. she said ‚Äúgive me a few days to figure out my car stuff.‚Äù she ignored me for a week. 

two months of cat and mouse and one morning i had a realization that she didn‚Äôt respect me at all and didn‚Äôt deserve my attention or energy. Not even as a friend. so i went to work, and‚Ä¶ to be honest without even feeling like i had to ‚Äútry‚Äù, i stonewalled her back. 

She OBVIOUSLY hated it. But I didn‚Äôt really care because she didn‚Äôt care to ever get back in a timely manner, or breakup with respect. And, had actively punished me with surprise stonewalling. I had put in the work to find closure without ANY communication. She texted promptly that night. A week late response to me asking for a coffee or call to clear the air, mind you: ‚Äúi‚Äôve been thinking about it and I‚Äôd rather have this convo over text‚Äù. I ignored it and kept up the stonewall the following day. it doesn‚Äôt even feel vengeful as much as it feels liberating for respecting myself. 

I‚Äôm just so sick of being discarded. And using my words and walking with forgiveness in my heart while people breadcrumb me. it‚Äôs not that i have hatred for her, but that i‚Äôm done giving it energy. 

AITA for dropping her like this? 

edit: she had asked me to be her boyfriend later down the line. when i asked her (after the wordless breakup) if we were still texting she said ‚Äúi can go either way, seeing as we set this up as a casual thing‚Äù. i felt pretty gaslit for having been told that boyfriend line was ‚Äúa casual thing‚Äù.",2,1738635467.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

I [ 30F] gave my friend Allie  [27F] unsolicited advice on how to handle issues with her boyfriend Dave [32M] and now I am being told to stop spreading gossip amongst the friend group and being told I am ‚Äútwo faced‚Äù and ‚Äúfake‚Äù.
I met Dave back when I was 16 through mutual friends. We were never really close, and honestly did not like each other and used to bump heads. I remember him being super impulsive and always causing issues in our friend group. I was not much better, I was boozing my way through life and dealing with my parents divorce and a very toxic relationship at the time. Fast forward seven years, and I was living with my boyfriend through the pandemic, got sober and cut out a ton of people in my life. I wanted to reinvent myself and be better. During this process I was really depressed and super lonely, so I decided to download Instagram in an attempt to reach out to people and maybe reconnect with a few. I added Dave, and we started to chat and catch up, he was living with room mates in the next city over and expressed interest in getting coffee and possibly reconnecting. We met up that following week, and it was awkward at first but I was happy to be around another person. We made small talk and caught up, he had gone to culinary school and realized it was not for him. I got into the medical field and realized it was a lot harder than I thought it would be. We talked for a few hours and realized that we both had significant others and decided that we would like to have them both meet and set up a double date. The double date went well, and slowly he started to introduce my boyfriend and I into his very tight knit friend group that he had been a part of for the last 20 years. My boyfriend and I both had a lot of trauma and issues with making friends due to back stabbing and never feeling good enough, so when we got together we vowed we would find like minded people to hopefully make real friends with. We always struggled with this, but when Dave brought us into his friend group everything just clicked. We started getting invited to annual family camping trips, birthday parties, and so many events that seemed like they were reserved for his closest friends. I had always wanted what it is that we had now found through Dave, and for that I am forever grateful. 
 
Ok, now onto the issue. Dave‚Äôs girlfriend Allie and I have made a conscious effort to become closer over the years. She had expressed to me how it is difficult for her to make female friends, and I had the same worries I confided in her. It did not happen right away, but we started to make plans to hang out just the two of us. At first it was to smoke weed and hang out and get food so it was a lot of surface level stuff. But then one day she let out how Dave had been cheating on her, apparently he had admitted to her that he had been cheating for months and how he told her just to hurt her and get back at her because when they first got together she had blacked out and ended up in a male friends bed naked and without recollection of what had happened the night before. She was so distraught and seemed like she just wanted to vent. I listened to her but tried to stay neutral while also showing support. She became distant and less like herself, whenever we did hang out with other people she was always in a bad mood and seemed like she didn‚Äôt want to be there. I made sure to reach out to her and hang out with her when I could, going on little walks or going to the gym with her just to be around, but she would always talk about how bad things were going in her relationship with Dave and would always tell me how she was depressed because of how toxic things were. I would often run into him at their place when she would tell me these things about him, and I felt extremely uncomfortable and uneasy because she had just finished telling me about how he was being emotionally abusive towards her and then would flip and hug and kiss him when he would walk in the door and completely  do a 180. I know It was obvious that I felt uneasy knowing all that I did, so I would excuse myself  and say I had to be  home or that I needed to run an errand or something. This dynamic continued for a few years, we would not really speak all too often, but she would reach out to me and vent about their fights, and whenever we did meet the conversation would always go back to how bad they were doing, how bad their fights were, or how depressed she was because of how he was treating her. I did my best to stay neutral, but at one point I just got tired of not saying anything and I started to ask her point blank ‚Äúwhy do you stay if you‚Äôre so unhappy?‚Äù. The first time I asked that she said she was trying to figure that out, and sometimes she would say that she loved him and she would make excuses for how he would treat her and absolve him of any blame. I tried to understand her, because I knew that relationships were complicated. I tried to be there for her, but at the same time started to feel guilty because I just wanted to get to know her and hang out with only her and not always have Dave around, especially if all I ever heard were negative things and she was always complaining about him. I would vent to her too about some issues with my boyfriend, but I did my best to not do that too often because I did not want the friendship to be founded on just complaining about our boyfriends.  She would complain to me that she had another female friend she confided in that kept telling her she needed to dump Dave, and that the other friend told her she felt uncomfortable being around Dave because she did not agree with how Dave treated Allie. Allie made it clear she was not going to leave Dave and she just wanted a supportive friend in her corner. So I continued to say the least amount possible about how I felt in order to maintain peace between Dave and I and to keep the friend group together. Then she dropped the bomb on me that he cheated AGAIN, and still she continued to stay and vent about his infidelity and how she did not know what to do. She would say things like ‚ÄúI‚Äôve told him, if he cheats a THIRD time we are DONE‚Äù. I started to feel angry with her, like WHY are you putting yourself through this? Why do you keep making excuses for this man, saying you‚Äôre depressed and suicidal and then when he is around you do a 180 and kiss up on him and act like nothing is wrong. It make me physically uncomfortable to be around them, around him, and to know as much as I did. I started to feel like she did not have a life outside of him or a personality outside of him. And I felt terrible for thinking that, but that‚Äôs how I felt. I started to not be able to hide how disgusted I was with the whole situation, and would start to speak up and ask her why she would put up with the way he treated her. I started to ask her if it was worth staying and if maybe she would pack a bag and leave for a few days after one of their ‚Äúthrowing things and screaming‚Äù matches. She would say she couldn‚Äôt leave because of what it would ‚Äúdo to him‚Äù and that he did not ‚Äúhandle that well‚Äù because of his apparent abandonment issues or trauma or whatever excuse she was making up about him. She would start to cancel plans and say that he wanted to hang out with her and he was lonely and how he felt like I did not like him  and how apparently he was jealous that Allie and I hung out because I was ‚Äúhis friend first.‚Äù It seriously gave me the ick. I started to be very vocal about how I was HER friend and my loyalties were to her, I don‚Äôt know but something about him claiming I was HIS friend and that he was jealous of my relationship with Allie struck me as a red flag and made me feel super uneasy. It reached a point where I was starting to reevaluate my friendship with Allie because I felt like she just got together with me to complain about Dave, and we never really learned much about each other or had a stronger bond because that‚Äôs all she would talk about. If I were to talk about getting food she would want us to eat with Dave because he ‚Äúwanted to hang with us too‚Äù, or if we had plans she would joke that he wanted to hang out too because he felt left out. I really reached a point where I wanted to let her know I couldn‚Äôt be her friend if all I was going to be to her was someone to vent to, and if everything always had to revolve around Dave I was going to go crazy. I asked my mom for advice and she urged I try and talk to her, and maybe try to understand her situation. But I will admit I struggled with that, and I did now know how to bring it up without causing a rift. Well, a few days ago Allie and I hung out, and as usual she complained about about how bad of a fight they had a few days prior where he allegedly accidentally slammed a drawer into her hip and her her while he was flinging her stuff out and telling  her to get out. I straight up told her that‚Äôs a huge red flag and sounds abusive, and she followed up by saying things would get better and how they were both doing therapy now and she thought it would help them. How he always felt bad after these fights and would apologize and they would apparently work through things. She always kept mentioning how he was depressed and felt like no one wanted to be around him and how he felt like I didnt like him and was apparently in a rut. I was obviously unfeeling and did not care, and found it weird how she kept bringing this up. Also, an added detail is that we all have a group chat between myself my boyfriend Dave and Allie. Sometimes Dave would text me separately in response to things we were talking about in the group chat. I always found it weird because I didn‚Äôt understand why he would need to talk to me separately, but would respond to be cordial. I also didn‚Äôt want to cross any boundaries where I would make Allie feel like he was cheating again. A few days ago we hung out and I let her know I felt weird about that, and how i was trying  to respect my relationship and also create a boundary, I let her know that Dave and I were friends but that we were not friends like Allie and I were. I let her know that I didn‚Äôt even know what Dave and I would talk about, and how it‚Äôs not like we would go out and get coffee or hang out outside of the friend group. She then hit me with ‚Äúoh I know you guys text at night‚Äù in the most accusatory tone. I felt sad initially, and immediately confused. I asked what she was talking about , and she backtracked and said she did not mean for it to sound that way. She then told me that she know Dave and I would text, I let her know we rarely would talk and the last time we talked  was on New Year‚Äôs Eve and only because he had texted me outside of the group chat which I found weird. I then asked her point blank if she was not ok with me talking to Dave separately and if that made her uncomfortable and she said it did. I let her know she did now have to say anything else and that I would respect that. She told me it was because of her history with Dave and that if things were different she wouldn‚Äôt feel that way. Now that I look back on that I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt have had to be the one to be told not to text him, and she should have told Dave instead. But hindsight is 20/20. That night Dave, Allie, my boyfriend  and I all hung out and Dave was acting a little weird and looked really uncomfortable but I thought it was maybe because of how he‚Äôs been depressed according to Allie. We all hung out, had dinner, and made plans to go on a couples trip sometime in the next few months.

Yesterday around noon, save texts me saying , ‚ÄúAllie tells me everything you guys talk about and it makes me feel really uncomfortable and like you‚Äôre being super fake. It was really hard for me to send this to you, but I think we both deserve that .‚Äù

I immediately how my boyfriend, and we are both kind of in shock. I was at brunch with my dad so I had to think about when I could call him to ask first of all, who the hell he thought he was talking to like that. And two, where the hell this was coming from. 

I compared myself and realized I needed to be strategic about my answer, I replied, ‚Äú That makes me really sad to hear, but appreciate your honesty and willingness to express how you‚Äôre feeling. I also have some thoughts, if you‚Äôre willing to hear me out. I would like to hop on a phone call later with you, if you are willing. ‚Äú

He then continues to blow me up with ,‚Äù Yeah I‚Äôm open to it . I‚Äôm really feeling a lot of self loathing right now And shame . Also Allie is gonna be real mad that I sent this but I‚Äôm sick of the two faced bullshit . Let‚Äôs all just be real here ya know .‚Äù

At this point  I was fuming and decided to give it time leave it alone while I thought about what to say. An hour later he texted me and said ‚Äú Hey, I‚Äôm taking a long drive and feeling a little more level headed. I love you lots dude and don‚Äôt wanna make this out to be bigger than it is. I just wanted to clear the air on a few things. LMK if/when you want to chat and I‚Äôll try my best to be direct and honest. ‚Äù

I was pissed off because I don‚Äôt know why he couldn‚Äôt have started off with THAT instead of outright attacking me. Why treat me like that and then backtrack and just say sorry? I left it alone and thought about whether I wanted to deal with this or sit on it for a few days. My boyfriend said he wanted to get involved because who was Dave to talk to me like that. I let my boyfriend know I didn‚Äôt want any more people dragged into this and I wanted to handle it myself, but that I was planning on callling him and when I didn‚Äôt I wanted my boyfriend there to listen in to make sure things did not get out of hand. A few hours later I called Dave, he answered and was immediately  apologetic. Saying he knew he handled things poorly, and how he had read the texts he had sent me and realized that the language he used was not okay and how he was coming from a place of anger and pure emotion. I said nothing but let him say what he needed to, he then said he would like to talk but that he was in the middle of something and that he would call me back in a few hours if I was willing. I said ok and left it at that.

A few hours later he called me back, and without letting him know my boyfriend recorded the conversation on his phone. Dave started off again by being apologetic, and letting me know that he had lashed out because he and Allie had had an really bad fight that morning where Allie had told him I had told her to ‚Äúpack her things and disappear‚Äù for a while. He then said he understood it was me saying she should take space , but how apparently she would be end up leaving for the night and turn off her phone then come back home at 5 am drunk. We had a long conversation where it was revealed that she would use my unsolicited advice and weaponize it against Dave and tell him what I suggested she do while they were in the middle of arguments. Which started to explain why he thought I hated him, he said he felt like people were conspiring to have her leave him. I let him know that as far as the ‚Äútwo faced fake bullshit‚Äù he referred to when he first messaged me, that‚Äôs not me being  fake. That was me trying to find a middle ground between being a supportive friend to Allie but also being cordial with Dave. I told him I was super uncomfortable knowing all that I did and that what he interpreted as being fake was me showing what it is to be an adult and not cause drama for no reason. I let him know that I shouldn‚Äôt have known what was going on in their relationship to begin with, and how I seldom talked about mine with allie for that reason. I let him know the situation  has gotten toxic and unhealthy for me and how I am being dragged into their issues. Dave let me know he understands Allie needed a friend to talk to and how that‚Äôs important but how he‚Äôs told her on multiple occasions that there are some things he doesn‚Äôt need to know, and I agreed. He was also honest and said he had looked through her phone and read messages between us and he knows it was wrong but he would see when she would vent to me and I‚Äôd give advice, he says he knows it was wrong to snoop and how they have an open phone policy but that made me feel sick and like I can‚Äôt talk to her ever without him knowing alll the details. We talked about a lot and came to the conclusion that I forgave Dave because I understood where he was coming from and if I were in his shoes I‚Äôd probably feel the same, but that I would take a step back from my friendship with her because I felt betrayed and back stabbed. I let him know that I did not want to cut ties with them because of this, but that I now have a lot to think about. He keep saying how much he loved me and how I was ‚Äúthe homie.‚Äù To which I responded that we are still friends and things might be weird for a little but it will be ok with time. I also made sure to let him know to never talk to me like that again or we would have serious issue. He acknowledged that and agreed. After about 20 minutes we reached a resolution and ended things on a good note. But now I have so much anger toward Allie and I feel so betrayed. She used the thing so said in fights with Dave, crated the narrative that I did not like him and was urging her to leave him, and then relaying to me that he felt like I didn‚Äôt like him and how he wanted to be around me when I was with her. I feel like she did this on purpose and maybe thought neither of us would talk about this. I feel hurt because now I know I can‚Äôt trust her, and like she baited me into feeding into the negative talk about Dave only to turn around and use it against him and crate a rift between eveyone. She texted me that same night saying ,‚Äù Hey dude, I know you and Dave talked so I‚Äôm really just texting you let you know that I understand if you‚Äôre feeling betrayed by me in any way or all the ways. I fully intend on giving you space if you need it and an open ear to hear what you have to say if needed. Unless you don‚Äôt want to talk about it that‚Äôs okay too, just know I care about our friendship and will literally jump through all the hoops to keep this friendship going. No pressure to respond AT ALL to respond to this.‚Äù

I have not responded to this and don‚Äôt know if I will. Part of me wants to kick her to the curb and tell her off for being manipulative and her being the two faced friend. Part of me feels guilty and like a bad friend for giving advice she didn‚Äôt ask her when I knew she didn‚Äôt want it and just wanted someone to talk to, but I got so tired of hearing her complain about the same thing over and over. I feel like  bad person and if I had just kept my mouth shut this would have never happened, I feel like I was tricked into disliking Dave, and like maybe that‚Äôs what she wanted all along. I also feel horrible for thinking that. I have such a hard time caring about people and I let myself care about her, and she‚Äôs my only female friend but at the same time I know I can‚Äôt ignore this and just hope it goes away . I tried calling  her a few minutes ago but she‚Äôs still at work (we share locations). Part of me is relieved she didn‚Äôt answer because I don‚Äôt know what I would even say. Do I apologize, do I confront? How do I do that without burning a bridge?

The Patagonia Black Hole Duffel Backpack Straps in 2025: Are They Worth the Hype? Review & Comparison

For adventurers and travelers alike, the Patagonia Black Hole duffel bag has long been a go-to choice for its rugged durability and practical design.However, one common pain point has always been its carrying options. While the duffel handles are suitable for short distances, lugging a fully loaded bag across an airport, up a mountain trail, or through a crowded city can be incredibly cumbersome, and can cause strain on shoulders and back. This is especially true if the duffel is heavy, which many who utilize these bags find to be the case. the good news is that the solution exists in the form of backpack straps, and in 2025, the discussion around these straps, whether original, replacement or aftermarket, is as relevant as ever. In this thorough guide, we'll delve deep into the world of Patagonia Black Hole duffel backpack straps, explore their evolution, address common concerns, and provide actionable advice to ensure you're making the best decision for yoru travel needs.

Understanding the Need: Why Backpack Straps Matter

Before we dive into specific strap options, it's essential to understand why backpack straps are such a game-changer for the Patagonia Black Hole duffel. The standard handles, while sturdy, aren't ergonomic for extended periods or when carrying heavy loads. The lack of even distribution across the body causes the bag to dig into one shoulder and cause posture issues. This is notably problematic if you have to juggle other bags or gear or if you have any kind of upper body issues. By adding backpack straps, the duffel transforms into a surprisingly capable ‚Äòtravel duffel backpack,‚Äô alleviating the pressure on your hands and shoulders, distributing weight more evenly across your back, and freeing up your hands for other tasks like managing tickets, phones, or that cup of coffee you desperately need.

The Patagonia Black Hole Legacy: A Quick Recap

It's vital to note that Patagonia designs the Black Hole duffel with the understanding that it's often going to be carried on the shoulders as a backpack.This is why so many include the backpack straps as standard. However, there's a lot to be said about their ergonomics and design. Patagonia's Black Hole line is synonymous with durability and sustainability, crafted from tough, recycled materials engineered to withstand the rigors of travel and outdoor adventures. Known across the world, the Patagonia brand attracts a varied crowd, from college students to seasoned hikers. Its target users are environmentally conscious,value quality and sustainability,and have an interest in the outdoors. The Black Hole duffel,known for its abrasion-resistant,weather-proof exterior,has garnered worldwide popularity for its ability to withstand the elements while keeping your belongings dry and secure. This reputation has led to a large consumer base, many of whom find the added backpack strap benefit to be crucial for any extended trips.

The Evolution of the Patagonia Black Hole Duffel Backpack Straps

Patagonia understands the need to offer comfortable and adaptable carrying options. The brand utilizes padded, removable shoulder straps on models like the 40L, 55L and 70L Black Hole duffel bags, a very practical feature for those who require versatility.These straps allow you to carry the duffel as a backpack when needed but are easily detachable when not required, which is ideal for storage. The Black Hole series is designed so that the straps can stow into their own pocket along the side of the bag. Despite this versatility, a number of customers still seek additional modifications, replacement straps, or even ‚Äòpatagonia black hole duffel backpack conversion kit‚Äô solutions to further tailor their bag to their needs.

Types of Patagonia Black Hole Duffel Backpack Straps

There isn‚Äôt one single type of backpack strap; the market offers a variety of options, each with its pros and cons. When considering a new strap purchase, you need to thoroughly consider what you're looking for. Let‚Äôs break down the primary categories:

1. Original Patagonia Straps: These are the straps that come standard with many Patagonia Black Hole Duffel Bags, frequently enough available in the 40L, 55L and 70L variations. They are typically padded and designed for comfort, and are created from robust materials that align with the bag‚Äôs durability. These are usually the first point of failure,and finding replacements is a large query for customers.2. Replacement Straps: Over time, even the most durable straps can succumb to wear and tear, or simply go missing while traveling. This is when you need to consider a ‚Äòpatagonia black hole duffel strap replacement‚Äô. The good news is that many third-party retailers offer suitable replacements, some with unique features or padding for increased comfort, and also Patagonia replacement parts for purchase. These replacements can be crucial for those who want to continue using their duffel without having to purchase a brand new version.

3. Aftermarket Conversion Kits: For older models or for duffels that may not come with straps, aftermarket conversion kits provide a solution to ‚Äòadd backpack straps to patagonia duffel.‚Äô Such kits usually include straps with an attachment system that fits onto the loops and handles of the duffel, such as webbing straps and buckles. These are the optimal choice for those who want more out of their older models or would like to add some extra features.

4. Third-Party Straps: Many companies offer specific ‚Äòduffel bag backpack straps‚Äô designed to fit a variety of duffels, including the Patagonia Black Hole series. These often incorporate unique design elements, like specialized padded sections, a sternum strap for added stability, or hip belts for weight transfer, increasing the comfort and function of the bag.Key Features to Consider

Before investing in any strap option, consider these key features:

* Padding: The amount of foam padding directly impacts carrying comfort. Look for straps with thick, high-density padding, particularly if carrying heavy loads, as well as a good mesh outer lining, which allows your back to breathe and does not hold sweat.
* Adjustability: Ensure straps can be adjusted to fit a variety of body types and preferences. The longer the adjustable range, the more adaptable it will be for various kinds of cargo and carrying options.
* Attachment Points: The straps shoudl be securely attached to the duffel bag using robust loops and buckles,as this increases the overall lifespan and durability of your kit.
* Durability: Straps should be able to withstand wear, tear, and the strains of travel, made from high-quality stitching and materials.A strong webbing material paired with quality buckles will go a long way into extending the life of your straps.
* Sternum Straps and Hip Belts: While not always essential, sternum straps and hip belts can provide additional support and stability, especially in reducing strain on the shoulders. This is crucial for long-term trips, or when the bag is overly heavy.
* Material and Construction: Consider the strap material to see if it aligns with your intended usage. You may want something more waterproof like a polyester or nylon blend if you intend to use it outdoors and in various weather conditions.

Comfort: Are Patagonia Duffel Straps Comfortable?

The question on everyone's mind is, ‚Äòare patagonia duffel straps comfortable?‚Äô The answer, like many things, is nuanced. The original Patagonia straps are generally considered adequate for carrying moderate loads over shorter periods. Given the bag is intended to be a travel duffel backpack, they are designed for this purpose. However, if you're carrying a heavy load or plan to wear the duffel as a backpack for extended durations, you might find that the provided straps aren‚Äôt quite suitable, particularly if you have existing aches. In these cases, investing in superior replacement straps or aftermarket kits with added padding and ergonomic designs becomes important. Many third-party options use thicker and stronger foam variants or gel pads and additional contours, which helps the user to comfortably shoulder the bag for a longer period than the original.

Proper Attachment and Adjustment: how To

Many users, particularly beginners, often seek details on ‚Äòhow to attach patagonia duffel straps‚Äô. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Identify Attachment Points: Locate the attachment points on your duffel, usually D-rings or reinforced loops.
2.Connect the Straps: Attach the straps securely to these points using the provided buckles or clips. Ensure you hear a click, or feel the secure point of attachment, before loading it up.
3. Adjust the Length: Adjust the straps so the duffel sits comfortably on your back, with the base resting just above your hips without sagging down. The higher it sits, the easier it is indeed to walk.
4. test the Fit: Load your bag with a representative weight, put it on, and walk around to test the fit and adjust as necessary.
5. Use Additional straps: If available, use the sternum strap and hip belts to provide additional support and weight distribution.

Patagonia Black Hole Duffel: Which Size Needs Backpack Straps the Most?

While the need for backpack straps is universal for those who desire extra comfort, the need for them increases with bag size, particularly with the 55L and 70L options. While the 40L version is often manageable by the handles,the larger 55 liter and 70 liter versions tend to become more troublesome. Here's a quick rundown:

* Patagonia Black Hole 40L Backpack Straps: Often more than sufficient for smaller loads, but could provide even more comfort and ergonomics with custom replacement straps. The 40L can be used as a weekend bag or a day trip bag without the need for backpack straps, but users still seek to optimize for comfort and convenience, so replacement straps remain a popular purchase.

* Patagonia Black Hole 55L Backpack Straps: The 55L tends to be the most popular variation, and for good reason, as the straps are more frequently enough needed on this size. The 55L is large enough for long trips, and can quickly become a pain point when carrying through crowded airports or city centers. The 55L needs an ergonomic carrying experience, and most buyers will opt for upgrading their original equipment or purchasing a replacement set after initial wear and tear.

* Patagonia Black Hole 70L Backpack Straps: This size is the largest and most demanding. While the 70L is usually reserved for expeditions or lengthy travel, it also requires the most robust carrying options, and requires the very best straps on the market. The 70L simply will not suffice for short trips; therefore, comfortable backpack straps become crucial.

finding Replacement Straps: Where To Look

Finding a ‚Äòpatagonia black hole duffel strap replacement‚Äô can be tricky, as Patagonia doesn't always offer an immediate direct replacement for the straps if you need them immediately. Luckily,the consumer has many diffrent resources available in their quest:.

* Third-Party Retailers: Online marketplaces and specialty travel gear stores offer a wide selection of replacement and aftermarket strap options for the Black Hole Duffel.
* Outdoor Gear Retailers: Stores that specialize in outdoor gear frequently enough carry a range of duffel bag straps, many of which will work perfectly as replacements.
* Reddit and Online forums: Forums like the r/PatagoniaClothing sub-Reddit can be a great source of recommendations from users who are familiar with the patagonia product line, as well as which other gear works best.* YouTube and TikTok: Platforms like YouTube and TikTok frequently enough feature videos from users on ‚Äòhow to put backpack straps Patagonia on Black Hole‚Äô or ‚Äòhow to attach patagonia duffel straps,‚Äô that offer some critically important insight into how it's done or what aftermarket straps are currently trending among customers.

Comparing the Alternatives: More Than Just Patagonia

While Patagonia straps are a popular choice, exploring alternatives can expand the list of options, such as ‚Äòbest duffel bag with backpack straps‚Äô, or ‚Äòdurable duffel bag with backpack straps‚Äô from other brands. These duffels sometimes incorporate more diverse options:

Because of the issues I‚Äôve seen on this sub and my own test pieces I want to leave the staining part to someone who would know better.

I took my tabletop to a furniture repair shop who quoted me pretty high (I thought) to stain and add a top coat.

How much should a service like this be? It‚Äôs really just sanding, staining, and adding a top coat right? Are there other options available? Staining it myself is sort of a last ditch option at the moment because I would have to do it completely outside and the piece would have to be left outside to dry in a not so secluded area.

i had just bought a few acres after my husband had passed and settled into what would have been our dream retirement home.

as i stepped out onto my porch, sipping my morning coffee, i noticed a lone deer grazing in my front yard. it's brown eyes seemed to lock onto mine, and for a moment, we just stared at each other. she was a beautiful buck. i brushed it off as mere curiosity, after all, deer were common in Virginia‚Äôs rural area.

weeks passed and i began to notice strange occurrences around my home. sometimes, tools would go missing, only to reappear in strange places. or i would hear whispers in the wind, faint but unmistakable. and then, there were the shadows. dark, twisted, almost human-like shapes that seemed to move of their own accord, darting around the edges of my vision.

on one a crisp sunday night, i was closing the curtains, and that when i caught a glimpse of the deer standing farther back than usual, near the treeline. it‚Äôs eyes seemed to gleam in the fading light, and for a moment, i could've sworn i saw something else standing just beyond it. a darker shape, tall and imposing, that seemed to blend seamlessly into the trees.

my heart skipped a beat as i spun away from the window, my mind racing with questions. what the hell was going on? why the hell is this deer behaving so strangely? and what the fuck was that other presence lurking just out of sight?

i tried to shake off the feeling of unease, telling myself i was just spooked, but the image of those piercing eyes and the dark shape beyond lingered in my mind. i knew wanted to get to the bottom of this, but did i really need to solve this mystery? as i turned to head back to my routine, i couldn't shake the feeling that i was being pulled into something much larger, and much more sinister, than i could've ever hoped for.

that night, i barely slept. my ears straining to pick up any sound that might indicate what was going on. just as the first light of dawn was creeping over the horizon, i heard something. a low, rustling sound, like leaves being disturbed. i froze, my heart pounding in my chest, as the sound grew louder. then, the window creaked open, and a cold breeze swept into the room. i spun around, my eyes scanning the darkness, and that's when i saw it. the same deer, standing in my bedroom, its eyes glowing with an otherworldly light.

i tried to scream. my voice was frozen in my throat. the deer began to move closer, its eyes fixed on me with an unspeakable hunger. and, just as all hope seemed lost, everything went black.

when i came to, i was lying in bed, my heart still racing. it was morning, and the sun was streaming through the window. i must have dreamed the whole thing, i told myself‚Ä¶except i knew then that it wasn't just a dream.  i felt a shiver run down my spine. something was out there, watching me, waiting for me.

as the days passed, i found myself growing increasingly uneasy. the deer's nocturnal visits became a constant presence, a lurking shadow that hung over my home like a specter. i tried to convince myself it was just my imagination running wild, but the sense of being watched persisted. every evening, around dusk, the deer would appear in my yard, its large brown eyes fixed intently on my house. it would stand there, motionless, watching with an unnerving intensity that made my skin crawl.

i tried to shoo it away, but it wouldn't budge. instead, it would back away slowly, its eyes fixed on me. glaring at me. taunting me. i turned around to close my door and she was gone. it‚Äôs as if it had disappeared, but i knew that she would be back. and next time, i had a feeling that she wouldn't be alone.

i stopped going out as much. i didn‚Äôt look out the windows. i couldn‚Äôt bring myself to make a huge mistake.

sunday rolls back around and i woke up to the sound of rustling leaves and snapping twigs. i looked out the window, and my heart nearly stopped there were hundreds of deer in my yard, their eyes shining like a sea of lanterns. they were packed tightly together, their bodies swaying gently in the breeze. the deer seemed to be... pulsing, as if they were connected by some unseen force. when suddenly, almost.. as if in perfect synchrony, they turned their heads towards my house. towards me. i felt a cold sweat break out all over my body as i realized that i was the focus of their attention. whatever they were waiting for, it was me. i was left shaken, wondering what had just happened. was it some kind of bizarre animal behavior? or was it something more... evil?
as i stood there, trying to make sense of it all, i felt a creeping sense of dread.

months passed and the deer's behavior became increasingly erratic. they would appear in my yard at all hours of the night, their eyes glowing like embers in the dark. they seemed to be patrolling the perimeter of my property, as if they were guarding something. for a while i felt safe, but it soon faded and i became more weary.

it started to feel like i was under siege, with the deer gathering in my yard like an army of sentinels. i couldn't sleep at night, my ears just begging to catch the sound of their hooves on the grass.

soon, the leaves changed colors and september hit.

i saw something that made my blood run cold. as i looked out the window, i saw one of the deer approaching my front door. it sniffed at the threshold, its ears twitching nervously. suddenly, it let out a high-pitched bleat, and the other deer forcefully gathered in the yard, turning to face my house in complete unison. they seemed to be waiting for something to happen, their eyes fixed on my front door with an unnerving intensity.

as i stood there, my eyes fixed on the figure beyond the treeline, i felt it again. a sense of dread washing over me. the deer, still motionless, seemed to be waiting for something to happen, their eyes fixed on the figure with an unnerving intensity. a figure, shrouded in darkness, didn't seem to be moving. just stood there, its presence seeming to fill the entire yard. yet i couldn't make out any features. only thing i could sense, was its eyes on me..boring into my skin. suddenly, the lead deer took a step forward, its hooves clicking on the pavement. the others eagerly followed. their eyes fixed on the figure as they moved closer. a sense of unease growing inside me, as if i was witnessing a scene from a horror movie. the deer, now gathered at the edge of the porch, seemed to be waiting for the figure to make its move. i, on the other hand, was frozen in terror, unable to do anything but watch as the events unfolded before my eyes. i could only stand there, my heart pounding in my chest.

and then, just as it had appeared, the figure disappeared. vanished from thin air. the deer, still gathered at the edge of the porch, seemed to relax, their ears twitching nervously as they sniffed the air.

that‚Äôs when it finally hit me. i had to get out of there. i grabbed my keys and made a run for my car, not stopping until i was miles from my house. i looked back in the rearview mirror, i saw the deer gathered in my yard, their eyes glowing devilishly. i knew then that i would never be able to go back to that house again.

i‚Äôm sitting in a dennys parking lot writing this down in case they find me. if you ever find yourself living alone, near the Appalachian Mountains, don‚Äôt look further. don‚Äôt look into the woods. if you hear something, pretend you didn‚Äôt. save yourself and learn from my mistakes.

stay safe folks. i‚Äôll try to do the same. ",4,1738634207.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

1ih6kua,https://www.reddit.com/r/vtm/comments/1ih6kua/chat_gpt_vtm/,Chat GPT + VTM,"I was testing Chat GPT with some diferent scenarios to and I somehow got this:

If **Caine and Lilith** returned as an **old, happily married couple** who just want to be **left alone**, Kindred society would **utterly implode**. Centuries of myths, wars, and political struggles would be revealed as **completely pointless**, and the reactions would be absolutely **hilarious** and **chaotic**.  

---

## **1. The Initial Reaction: Mass Confusion and Existential Crisis**  
### **Elders, Methuselahs, and Antediluvians: ""Wait‚Ä¶ WHAT?!""**  
- **Camarilla Elders**‚Äîwho have spent **centuries manipulating vampires** based on the ""divine wrath of Caine""‚Äîwould be in **total disbelief**.  
- The **Antediluvians** (Third Generation) might have **feared his return**, expecting divine punishment‚Äîonly to see **Caine laughing, holding Lilith‚Äôs hand, and reminiscing about their garden back in Nod**.  
- Some might **refuse to believe it**, thinking it's a **test** or **illusion**. Others might just **lose their minds** on the spot.  

### **Younger Vampires (Anarchs, Neonates): ""You mean we‚Äôve been fighting over NOTHING?!""**  
- Younger Kindred, especially **Anarchs**, would have the biggest **WTF moment in vampire history**.  
- They‚Äôve spent centuries **fighting oppression, rebelling against elders, and fearing Gehenna**, only to find out‚Ä¶  
- **The big bad vampire god just wants to enjoy a quiet afterlife with his wife?!**  
- **Some will laugh. Some will cry. Some will just quit vampire society entirely.**  

### **The Bahari (Lilith Worshippers): ""We have dedicated our existence to hating her husband, and she‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ happy?""**  
- The **Bahari**, who have treated Caine as a **hated villain**, would have the biggest **identity crisis** of all.  
- Imagine their faces when Lilith just **kisses Caine on the cheek**, smiles, and says:  
  - *""He‚Äôs not that bad once you get to know him.""*  
- Some might **deny reality** and call Lilith a traitor.  
- Others might just **give up and go home**.  

### **The Sabbat: ""Gehenna Was Supposed to Be a War, Not a Love Story!""**  
- The **Sabbat** has spent **centuries preparing for the end times**, believing Caine would return as either:  
  - A **divine punisher** who would help them slay the Antediluvians.  
  - A **tyrant** they would have to rebel against.  
- Instead, they find **Caine casually feeding birds in a park with Lilith** while holding a cup of coffee.  
- Some **Sabbat zealots will explode from sheer disbelief**.  
- Others might **go on a killing spree out of frustration**, trying to force Gehenna to happen.  
- The more reasonable ones will just **retire and start drinking**.  

---

## **2. The Funniest and Most Chaotic Reactions**  

### **Caine and Lilith Do a Public Appearance, and It Goes Terribly Wrong**  
Imagine they do an **interview** or a **public speech** for Kindred society. It might go something like this:  

- **Caine**: *""Listen, kids, all this talk about me punishing vampires? I don‚Äôt care. I left you all alone for a reason.""*  
- **Lilith**: *""And those of you who worship me as a goddess of vengeance? Sweeties, I moved on ages ago. I garden now.""*  
- **A Ventrue Prince in the crowd**: *""But Lord Caine, surely you have returned to bring judgment upon the wicked?""*  
- **Caine**: *""No, I came back because Lilith wanted to see if our old house was still standing.""*  
- **Lilith**: *""It wasn‚Äôt, by the way. Someone built a McDonald‚Äôs there.""*  
- *Cue the entire Kindred audience losing their minds.*  

---

### **The Camarilla Tries to Keep the Masquerade Intact‚ÄîAnd Fails**  
- The **Inner Circle** might **try to cover it up**, telling vampires:  
  - *""No, no, this isn‚Äôt real! Caine is supposed to be a terrifying legend, not some old guy feeding pigeons!""*  
- But when **video footage** leaks of **Caine and Lilith dancing in a jazz club**, the Masquerade is pretty much done for.  

---

### **Thin-Bloods and Caitiff Are the Only Ones Having a Good Time**  
- Thin-Bloods, long considered **failures and rejects**, might be **overjoyed** to find out Caine doesn‚Äôt care.  
- **Thin-Blood 1**: *""So we‚Äôre NOT a sign of the end times?""*  
- **Caine**: *""Nah, you guys are fine. Live your weird half-vampire lives in peace.""*  
- **Thin-Blood 2**: *""Wait, does this mean I can finally be a Twitch streamer without worrying about Gehenna?""*  
- **Caine**: *""Sure, kid. Do your thing.""*  

---

## **3. What Happens Next?**  

### **Caine and Lilith Refuse to Get Involved, and Vampires Keep Freaking Out**  
- Despite their **godlike power**, Caine and Lilith refuse to **interfere** in Kindred politics.  
- **Ventrue Princes, Tremere Warlocks, and Methuselahs** keep trying to convince them to take sides.  
- Meanwhile, Caine and Lilith are just **living their best lives**, completely ignoring vampire society‚Äôs chaos.  
- **Example Headlines in Kindred Newspapers**:  
  - *""Caine Spotted at Disneyland. Anarchs in Crisis.""*  
  - *""Lilith Opens a Bakery. Tremere Demand Explanation.""*  
  - *""Gehenna Canceled: What Does This Mean for the Jyhad?""*  

---

### **Vampires Have No Idea What to Do Next**  
- Some Kindred **fully accept this new reality**, choosing to **leave their old ways behind**.  
- Others **go into denial**, pretending Caine and Lilith never returned.  
- A few **desperate Elders and zealots try to manufacture a ‚Äòreal‚Äô Gehenna**, refusing to accept that **the end times they feared will never come**.  

---

## **Final Conclusion: The Funniest and Most Chaotic Vampire Crisis in History**  
If **Caine and Lilith** returned as **a loving old couple** who just want to **be left alone**, it would be the **greatest Kindred meltdown ever**.  

- **Centuries of myths and power struggles? Meaningless.**  
- **Vampire society? In ruins.**  
- **The Camarilla, Sabbat, and Bahari? In existential crisis.**  
- **Thin-Bloods and Neonates? Vibing and thriving.**  

Meanwhile, **Caine and Lilith are just chilling**, drinking coffee, and watching the **vampire world lose its collective mind** over something that was **never a big deal to them in the first place**..",0,1738634085.0,vtm,2,0.25,False

Is this a genius financial flex or the setup for the *biggest slush fund in U.S. history*? Let‚Äôs dig in.

# üìå What‚Äôs Actually Happening?

This isn‚Äôt some small policy tweak‚Äîthis is **the U.S. government creating its own investment fund** to secure key industries, grow national wealth, and play financial chess against foreign powers.

üí∞ **Where‚Äôs the money coming from?**

* No direct taxpayer funding (*allegedly*).
* Could come from **asset sales, reallocations, surpluses (lol), or even straight-up fiat printing.**
* Basically, it‚Äôs Uncle Sam‚Äôs **national hedge fund**‚Äîbut with way fewer risk disclosures.

üìà **What‚Äôs it investing in?**

* **Tech, Infrastructure, Energy, Defense**‚Äîaka the stuff the U.S. *really* doesn‚Äôt want foreign players messing with.
* Might even **buy up stakes in global companies** to counter China‚Äôs aggressive investments.
* Wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if they throw a few billion into AI, semiconductor manufacturing, or quantum computing.

üö¶ **Who‚Äôs running this thing?**

* Supposedly an **oversight board** will keep it in check.
* But let‚Äôs be real‚Äî**politicians picking stocks?** What could go wrong?

# ‚öñÔ∏è Why Now?

üåç **Global Financial Chess** ‚Äì Foreign sovereign wealth funds have been **buying up U.S. assets for years.** This could be a counterplay to keep strategic industries *American-owned.*

üèõ **Political Speedrun** ‚Äì Executive order = **no waiting for Congress to bicker about it for two years.** Straight into action.

üí∞ **""America First,"" But Make It Financial** ‚Äì The idea is to **secure capital for key industries without relying on Wall Street firms** that are just trying to max out their bonuses.

# üö® Big Brain Move or Financial Dumpster Fire?

‚úÖ **The Bull Case:**

* Could **strengthen national economic security** and **create long-term revenue.**
* Helps the U.S. **compete with foreign investment giants** instead of playing defense.
* If well-managed (*big if*), could stabilize the economy and act as a buffer in downturns.

üö® **The Bear Case:**

* **Who‚Äôs actually in charge?** Wall Street guys? Political appointees? Either way, expect *shenanigans.*
* **Government running a hedge fund?** Bro‚Ä¶ have you *seen* the national debt? üíÄ
* **The ‚ÄúTrust Me, Bro‚Äù Problem** ‚Äì No real public input, potential for cronyism, and *zero* guarantee this won‚Äôt be mismanaged.

# üé≠ Final Thoughts ‚Äì Are We Buying This?

This is either:  
**1Ô∏è‚É£ A financial masterstroke that lets the U.S. finally play offense in global markets,** or  
**2Ô∏è‚É£ A taxpayer-backed meme fund that turns into an absolute mess in five years.**

What‚Äôs your play?  
üîπ **Bullish on the U.S. government running its own investment strategy?**  
üîπ **Bearish because, let‚Äôs be real, when has a government-run fund** ***ever*** **been efficient?**

Had a nice conversation with Trey Dexter, the owner of Primitive Coffee (partnered with Nate Underwood of Harding House) and he is looking to add more food options to be able to have something for a lunch until close. They do close earlier that many, but you can also get a beer at 7 AM Mon-Sat.

* Jackalope is seeking part time help canning beers. Inquire at their location in WeHo. And Diskins Cider will be having their Anti-Monopoly Cake Decorating Contest on the 16th. 

* If the grapevine is correct, the former Czann's property is about to be occupied by another Nashville brewery as their second location. Heard from a reliable source, but yet to be confirmed in person, Living Waters will be taking over the space soon. With licensing times in the county, I suspect it will take months, but crossed fingers.

*  Ran into Kyle at Fait la Force last time I was up there. Matt (Flip) is also over at Southern Grist and Monday Night. Good to see both active in the community (Matt since day 1, Kyle got back in awhile ago). 



**Outside of Nashville**

* **Asheville**: Late last year, Hillman was able to reopen its locations, about 3 months after the flooding from Helene. Zillocoah is well on the way to reopening. As of January 21st, they had the building resealed, so they can safely lock up. They have a [Go Fund Me](https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-restore-our-happy-place-and-gather-again) that has raised over $115k. 

* **Chattanooga**: I had previously posted a post about Naked River Brewing in Chattanooga. I recently heard the goal was to make this location another Buds & Brews location, but Jake Raulston, original owner and brewer, was not onboard. This is allegedly what led to shutting the brewery down and firing all of the employees. I have confirmed Jake still has the lease and is trying to resurrect the brewery, but has to get a new liquor license as Mike Solomon got control of the license for that property when he bought into the brewery and served as CEO.

before:
- somewhere around 146 lb, I gained a lot of weight since the middle of my senior year of high school (1 year ago) due to mental health struggles and poor self control
- frequently eating after 8pm, often until midnight or after midnight
- very very large portions of carbs and a lot of sugary drinks (sometimes several per day)
- little exercise
- poor sleep

now:
- don't have a scale but buying one soon
- stop eating after 6 or 7pm (depends on my schedule), except for VERY occasional eating at social events (which I have few of üíÄ)
- very low carb, I try to reserve carb intake for some berries with this vegan coconut yogurt (low carb, most of the carb in it is fiber) and a piece or two of dark chocolate per day
- still working on the sleep, I think this will help me lose weight more easily
- walking or exercising within an hour after any meals
- no snacks
- swapped sugary drinks for coffee (black or if I'm having it with a meal, with half and half) or unsweetened tea (no dairy)
- I slowly decreased from having a couple bites of pasta once a day to none, and I am eating cheat desserts much less often
- added more protein and fiber

I got a lot to say about this experience but the first thing that struck me was the amount of professionalism that the servers and staff had. It really felt like a mini restaurant just for students! Their dinner although being a bit pricier than lunch has a much longer time period and has more variety of complete meals. If you go right at the start (5pm) with an empty belly, you can do what I did and have a late lunch, dinner and dessert all together. I really like that they give you time to come back and eat whenever you'd like within the time frame (you just have to show your ticket). The only complaint I have about the outward appearance of the place is mostly towards the students eating there. Tables were very dirty and it was hard finding one that wasn't covered in used plates, cutlery and leftover food scattered around. I eventually did find a seat but even then I had to wipe the area with a tissue before settling in. Students, please don't leave this to custodial staff. You're old enough to pick up after yourselves. 

Onto the food! 
First I tried some salsa verde chicken enchiladas which werent the best but still edible. They were a little cold and the salsa verde was more.. salsa amarillo. It was a bit sour but that could be due to the tomatillos being a little underripe. When balanced with the fresh arugula and beans however, it made for a delightfully flavorful bite. Also, the herbs here are grown on site!! Isn't that amazing? You can see them in a little illuminated greenhouse by the entrance. Next, I tried some French vanilla from the hot drinks dispenser. Im a bit wary when it comes to drinks from machines but this was surprisingly good. Smooth, sweet and creamy and had that distinct French vanilla taste. 
The enchiladas and salad left me kinda hungry though so I grabbed some smoked turkey and wild rice soup. This was really good. The smoked turkey made for a delicious and unique flavor and paired perfectly with the wild rice and vegetables. 
After a few hours, I came back for dinner. Dinner was a tad bit dissapointing if I'm honest. The only thing I enjoyed was the garlic friend basmati rice (which I drizzled some Tabasco on. Don't ask. I go insane for hot sauce) and the raw broccoli and spinach which.. well they're vegetables. Can't go wrong with fresh veggies. I tried really hard to like the haddock but it just wasn't it. The spices didn't go well and didn't taste Cajun at all. The haddock which is usually known for being a mild tasting white fleshed fish had a ""fishy"" flavor more akin to what you'd find in tilapia. The potatoes also weren't the best. I mean- how do you go wrong with potatoes?? üò≠üò≠
Dessert was a bust.
The jello had this indiscernible flavor and was kinda stiff and sticky at the same time. The macaroon bar was okay but it was really dry. My boyfriend had a bite and he spit it out immediately. I had really high hopes for the tart because I love tarts but it missed :(

I'd definitely come back here to try some more stuff. It's hard to do a review on a buffet just because of how varied the options are so my rating will always be different based on what they're serving that day. I highly recommend you do check it out though. Plus points for a really cool waste receptacle and a dirty dish conveyor belt. As well as numerous halal options, many drink options and the friendliness of the staff.

From what I‚Äôve seen pleco are inexpensive get rather large and don‚Äôt have huge maintenance costs. Not to mention being hardy and freshwater fish 

The basic design would be a large cylinder about coffee table height. A grassy uneven bottom. With a few caves that are either open on top or sides or the bottom. I‚Äôd want this tank to be colorful and clean looking to contrast with its black scaly body.

This is a ‚Äúdream tank‚Äù so I don‚Äôt plan on making it anytime soon I just wanna hear thoughts. 

My main question would be maintenance/ over all requirements. 
I don‚Äôt know if these fish need a pump since they have their labyrinth. 
I don‚Äôt know what to feed a bigger pleco since they don‚Äôt feed on algae at that size. 
I don‚Äôt know if any other companions or flora would be beneficial. 

Usually plecos are treated like a cleaning tool or a pest. However this tank is for a big pleco and only that so I would want it to be as happy as possible. Like what temps aren‚Äôt ideal or what diseases to look out for. I would want a more wild caught species since most domestic breeds don‚Äôt show off their scales. If possible I‚Äôd like to put some smaller fish in but since I want it to reach a larger size that would probably be an issue 

 As stated in the title I would want to pet it. I‚Äôve seen them thrown from one tank to another and crawl across a beach. I‚Äôm sure  I could wield them out of the tank for minutes and they would survive all the same. Because of this I‚Äôm not sure what method to take to get it use to being handled. Unlike other fish I haven‚Äôt heard of plecos or catfish being known for intelligence. Ideally I‚Äôd like to have it come out on its own rather than occasionally getting a pet in before it hides. Also what if  there is a shallower section where I can move it and pet it while it moves back to the depths. 

If you any examples of tanks or videos that could be useful for this project please let me know in the comments below. Every time i see a pleco in the corner of a tank I always wonder why people don‚Äôt make a bigger deal of those monsters of fish kind. ",0,1738632377.0,Aquariums,3,0.5,False

You're Cheeky FFM- I am still feeling this one but be warned, IT.PACKS.A.PUNCH! Don't spray too much, especially on your clothes for those who do this because it's STRONG but the dry down is good. I haven't had to reapply like MA. Pink Obsessed is still my go to but I can live with this one. Now the mini, WOW, SUPER strong to the point I nearly had to wash it off and I didn't spray that much.

* This really cool coffee roasting kit for someone's coffee snob husband

As I've descended down the rabbit hole of grinder and burr reviews I feel almost more confused than when I first started out! I currently have an entry-level set up that my spouse and I have been happy with for the past year- a Breville Baristra Pro Touch and Ode Fellow Gen 1 with SSP burrs. While the user experience for both has been enjoyable with delicious cups brewed along the way, it still feels at times that I could push things further (mostly with espresso) that is limited by gear ceiling.

We would like to start with upgrading our grinder and then eventually our machine after a year or so. Our price range is around the two-thousand dollar range with an absolute maximum of $2,800 at this time. The main issue that has been troublesome in guiding a potential purchase is that my spouse and I look for different things out of our coffee. We each drink 1-2 espresso milk-based drinks a day +/- a glass of cold brew daily. Additionally, I drink 1-2 single cup V60 pour over daily.

For espresso, I enjoy both light and medium roasted coffees and enjoy acidity along with flavor note separation. My spouse on the other hand is very sensitive to acidity and prefers only medium roasted coffees that highlight a balanced and ""nutty"" flavor profile, that from anecdotal experience, seem to be a popular choice among S. Korean and some Japanese roasters from our travel experience. A friend of ours has a Niche Zero + Lelit and we occasionally have lattes together. My spouse seems to enjoy coffees produced with that grinder more than I have. Due to these differences, we generally settle on purchasing medium roasted coffees that we both enjoy together. For pour over, I enjoy lightly roasted single origin washed coffees that highlight brightness and sweetness.

We've been eyeing the Wug2 with SSP Lab Sweet and Mazzer 151A burrs as a versatile single dose option that can handle both espresso and filter, but those aesthetics are not particularly to our liking and I fear that changing out the burrs daily, while advertised as only taking 5 minuets, would get old quickly. The more I've searched, I'm not entirely sure if there is some combination of grinder and burr set in our price range that could satisfy both of our preferences for taste profile within the realms of both espresso and filter coffee.

Does anyone have any suggestions or is it better to purchase two separate grinders- one dedicated for espresso and the other for filter? If that is the suggestion, counter space is not a major concern for us and I did consider the Timemore 078 with Turbo Burrs at one point as an upgrade from my Ode Gen 1.

Thank you for your help, time, and reading this far!

My spouse on the other hand is very sensitive to acidity and prefers only medium roasted coffees that highlight a balanced and ""nutty"" flavor profile, that from anecdotal experience, seem to be a popular choice among S. Korean and some Japanese roasters from our travel experience. A friend of ours has a Niche Zero + Lelit and we occasionally have lattes together. My spouse seems to enjoy coffees produced with that grinder more than I have. Due to these differences, we generally settle on purchasing medium roasted coffees that we both enjoy together. For pour over, I enjoy lightly roasted single origin washed coffees that highlight brightness and sweetness. 

We've been eyeing the Wug2 with SSP Lab Sweet and Mazzer 151A burrs as a versatile single dose option that can handle both espresso and filter, but those aesthetics are not particularly to our liking and I fear that changing out the burrs daily, while advertised as only taking 5 minuets, would get old quickly. The more I've searched, I'm not entirely sure if there is some combination of grinder and burr set in our price range that could satisfy both of our preferences for taste profile within the realms of both espresso and filter coffee. 

  
Does anyone have any suggestions or is it better to purchase two separate grinders- one dedicated for espresso and the other for filter? If that is the suggestion, counter space is not a major concern for us and I did consider the Timemore 078 with Turbo Burrs at one point as an upgrade from my Ode Gen 1. 

Thank you for your help, time, and reading this far!

Hear each others life stories. I tell her we can discuss exact $ after since we are in a bit of a public place, she agrees. Overall a fantastic date and we are both giddy and impressed.

Afterwards we text a little and she says she only does platonic. She might be into more, but not right away. Idk, just unexpected. I was going to send her an amount based on physical but now I'm not sure what to do. Sbe was fantastic and I believe I'd really enjoy the platonic with her, but I have plenty of people that'll let me buy them dinner to hang out with no other price tag attached.

I‚Äôve worked hard to climb the ladder, get promoted and make good money. But now the work is draining me and making horribly depressed. The last 4 years I have survived 3 rounds of layoffs and have gone from a top performer to midrange to lower performer because of the horrible internal changes and constant restructuring. We recently had RTO, which would be fine even with the 1 hour commute, but we have zero amenities, we have no break room, no microwave, no fridge, no coffee pot. I share a room with 7 other guys who also make calls, have virtual meetings and it‚Äôs over stimulating to work in compared to my home office. One drinking fountain and one bathroom with a single stall that‚Äôs always in use. Our schedule expectations has no lunch break, or breaks at all. And I find myself still needing to take client calls and support them on weekends and evenings. I took a 2 week vacation last month and with the post holidays I fell into the bottom 30% of the org for results and got written up. There was no consideration for my time off to give me quota relief and I worked during my vacation to not fall below that mark but still missed it by 1%. 

All of this wouldn‚Äôt matter and I would just quit and find something else, even if it made less money, except I have a 4 year old and family to think about and support. I‚Äôm missing time with them, even now at 7pm I‚Äôm typing on Reddit taking a short break before I grind out more work to get to perform. I think I‚Äôm at my breaking point.

We are friends and I just expressed my feelings to her,"TLDR: Alright, its going to be a long one and I need your suggestions as I am completely out of my mind. 

We two met each other last year around May and was introduced by a common friend. The moment I saw her, I had a crush on her. Skip a couple months, we started doing trips together just us, going to coffee shops, hot chocolates etc. She also started enjoying my company she said that. I do drive her around here and there quite a few times a month. We meet every week with our group for coffee catchup. We both actually felt the warmth and became very good friends in a short span of time. Started liking the company. I started LIKING her A LOT every single day. 

She is a very good person, and looking for a long-term in fact permanent committed relationship. She's humble, loyal, down-to-earth, matured and a very happy-go-lucky girl. Whenever i look into her eyes, i feel a kind of spark and feel something. I love when she opens her hair, she looks so pretty. Her smile is very unique, i haven't really saw anything like that. I am an introvert guy, silent, less talkative. And she's completely opposite. Extroverted, talkative, excellent story telling skills. I was actually looking for a such a person who is completely opposite than me. I value the differences and I feel if we have that, we can create unique experiences every single day. Whenever I am around her, it feels like something connects, and something fits. We started spend good amount of time together, went on road trips, shopping, grocery shopping, etc. 

With all these influx of emotions, I decided to finally let her know last week. She loves watching stars so I decided to take her to a place in the night out of the city lights, for stargazing. Enjoyed the drive, and spend the time watching stars. I had her hot chocolate and we shared good moment sipping the hot chocolate. I got a feeling that it is the right time to let her know, I told her can i ask you something. I then went ahead and asked if we could go on a date together. She took a pause and told why do we wanna ruin the friendship we have together. And she told me to let her know what everything is going in my mind. I let her know every single thing I felt, that how much I like her and how much she means everything to me, how much her company means to me. Every single thing. 

This is what she said. Heads up, it didn't turn in my favor. She thinks she is not ready for it and when i confessed my feelings to her, she kind of little freaked out. ""Not ready"" is a strong word, but she's not in a state to do this. She said she has a past trauma, and its so bad that it keeps coming in intervals and she had it recently where she breaks down and reaches him. She feels this void and want to focus on herself atm. With all this going around, she won't be able to give the love i need. She's currently ""empty"" - referring to a glass. And even if she ignores, and come with me , it won't be genuine. I felt her pain in her eyes while she was explaining this. I told her I am not in a state to rush, i wanna take baby-steps and i am ready to wait. Because that's what love is right, you wait and don't rush. I told her I don't have any expectations, I just wanna give you love and we can deal this shit together. I will make sure to give you a lot. But, she said for how long will i wait, she's not sure how long it will be and its not a good idea to keep me holding. Told me move on, go on other hinge dates, eventually you will find someone who's ready to ""give"" and not just receive. 

After hearing all this, it killed me inside. I cried the shit out of me after returning. This sucks a LOTTT. The thing is, for the first time, i never felt irritated or angry or feel like punching when she explained. Instead, I felt at peace and calm. Only thing is I am hurt a lottt, feeling like someone tore the book out in between. My love for her is genuine and I don't wanna give up on her. I want to take her out of the feeling she is going. I don't feel like giving up because for all that I know, she's worth it. Its rare to find a person like her with good human, heart and behavior and i do have the feeling of keeping her.

1ih52tr,https://i.redd.it/w1fvihp0r0he1.jpeg,Sos. Too dark for 10 dpo?,"Hi! I know line darkness is only a rough indicator of level of hcg, and truly should be used as a pregnant or not pregnant measure‚Ä¶. But I‚Äôm having a hard time believing I can have this much in my system less than 3.5 weeks pregnant. Do you think that it‚Äôs possible that this is 10 dpo/cd24???

My lmp was 1/10, and slightly lighter than usual but nothing crazy. 
I am actively avoiding pregnancy and randomly tested today after my beloved coffee made me sick. A symptom I did not get until 8+ weeks with prior pregnancies. Help!! I had a high risk pregnancy last time (identical twins). I tried to schedule a doctor apt today, but there are a ton of waitlists or they don‚Äôt take my insurance. I need to make decisions on next steps but have no clue how far along I am, and finding care asap seems pretty challenging.",1,1738629796.0,lineporn,5,1.0,False

I've tried looking for a coffee shop (NOT boba/milk tea) and haven't found a place that offers this within reasonable detour on my way to work in Oakland. Any recommendations? I travel from 150th to Oakland via 580, but willing to make a detour between 580 and 880. Going too far south of 880 would not be convenient for me.",3,1738629686.0,sanleandro,2,0.81,False

1ih50wg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1ih50wg/erm_friend_said_a_weird_thing/,Erm.. friend said a weird thing,"I have a friend I play video games with. We met via videogames and have played together regularly for the last 2 years. 
He knows I'm married, kids, buying a house, etc. 
He's single, kids, lives on the other side of the country and 8+yrs older than me.

Anyway we are great friends and chat regularly via text and discord. (My husband has full access to my phone & all socials and I have access to his, it's nothing more than platonic texts and the occasional selfies if on a trip or have a new pet/hobby)

Well, today I asked him when we are going to find him a ND girlfriend since honestly, he has the patience to game with me (I'm like a squirrel on coffee), I think he would be a great partner for a ND woman.

He said ""The only ND chick I want to game with is you."" 
 
I replied ""haha awee that's sweet."" (My default when idk how to reply to a complement) when in reality I was like ""uhoh"" and now I'm wondering if maybe he's catching ""the feels""?

Normie words? overthinking? Weird slip up?
