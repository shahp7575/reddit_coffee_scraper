My friends called me crazy for how hard I looked during this period of my life. I was lucky to do some contracting work in between all this to keep myself busy.

I am PST time zone so I wake up at 6 AM to get my coffee and start applying for position posted by recruiters/ HR in EST or CST. I look and apply for about 2 hours or until nothing new is there. I refresh the page at 10 AM PST to factor in PST schedule. I refresh at 12 noon PST to see what is new. I refresh again at 3 PM PST to do the same. I relax for a while and I refresh again at 8 PM PST (I do this because I speak an Asian language so it allows me to interview for jobs with recruiters overseas). I repeat this procedure from Sunday to Friday afternoon every single day and week. (Sunday evening because Asia is on Monday schedule already)

was waiting for background and everything cleared with a company that I see a decent career in. I wish everyone the best of luck and don't give up.

\*I lost track of a lot more emails for applications and what not so I think realistically it was closer to 3200 roughly applications in total with the remainder belong to auto reject or no answer.

My wife seems quite upset over this though saying it's a bad habit and not sustainable when we go back to work. My argument is it doesn't matter, he'd still be up and one of us will still have to bite the bullet. I know witching hour is at it's worst right now and it'll eventually pass.

Do you have any experience eating the same meal for a whole day (but different meals for each day)?   
How does it affect weight loss?

Assuming, I want to eat 2000kcal, here is what I mean: 

* Calculate that my simple, favourite meal (e.g. Beef Stew with Rice, Julienne Soup or Hunter's Stew) gives me 1800 kcal when I eat 800g of it
* Let's say I leave 200 kcal for coffee, tee and other minor, easy-to-calculate things
* Prepare 800g of my meal in the evening and eat it all the next day, no matter if I split it into 3, 4 or 5 portions.

To give my body various macros, vitamins etc, the meal would be different each day

Pros that I see: 

* Extreme simplicity in calorie calculation (you count it once a day)
* It is easy to see how much I eat today - should I slow down or am I at a good point
* Much easier shopping
* Faster cooking

Lyrics by: Kole Mitchell McKinley

 

**Act 1, Scene 1** 

 

*Light ups on Jason asleep in bed. His room is littered with Pizza box garbage, 90’s memorabilia like TMNT, and his TV screen buzzing with a left on Sega/Dreamcast video game flickering. We hear Jason’s alarm go off.*

 

Dad:  Hey Jas, you up? Jason? Jason?!?

 

*Jason springs out of his racecar bed and starts scrambling getting ready for school.*

 

Jason:  Yeah Dad! Been up for hours just getting dressed!

 

Mom:  Did you clean your room?

 

*Jason throws the blanket over his bed.*

 

Jason:  So clean you could eat off the floor!

 

*Jason takes a bite out of a piece of pizza in a box on the floor.*

 

*Music Starts. Jason pops his toothbrush in his mouth.*

 

Dad:  Did you finish that paper for English class?

 

Jason:  \*Sigh

 

*Jason exits bedroom to kitchen with skateboard in hand, he puts his toothbrush in a vase on a shelf on his way to the kitchen.*

 



 

Dad:  I said, did you finish your paper?

 



Goin’ My Way

*Music a la 90’s rock, driving* 



Jason:  YEAH, DAD OF COURSE I DID!

I WROTE THAT PAPER LIGHTNING QUICK



 

Mom:  Did you finish your breakfast?

 

Jason:  MMHHMM-SO GOOD MOM! 

SHH HERE- ALL YOURS SID.

WELL, I GOTTA JET BE GOOD YOU KIDS!

 

*Jason gives the dog his bowl of oatmeal and skateboards out the door and down the street toward school queuing a montage of other kids getting ready for/going to school.*

 

Jason:

 

SOME KIDS GET UP EARLY AND DO THEIR CHORES,

BUT THAT’S A BORE TO ME.

 

I’D RATHER STAY UP LATE- LIKE WAY PAST EIGHT,

DRINK SOME COKE-A-COLA STRAIGHT,

MAYBE EVEN MASTUR-

 

 

Neighbor: Morning Jason!

 

 

Jason:

 

WHEN IT COMES TO TROUBLE I’M FLIRTIN’

WHAT THEY DON’T KNOW CAN’T HURT EM.

I DON’T KNOW WHY BUT I'M CERTAIN,

THAT EVERYTHING IS GOIN’, 

YEAH EVERYTHING'S GOING' MY WAY!

 

Neighbor:

 

YEAH, EVERYTHING IS GOING HIS WAY!

 

*Kids off to school dance break/skateboard trick montage section. There is about 32-64 bars of music here.*

 

Jason:

 

JUST ANOTHER DAY BEFORE THE WEEKEND,

YEAH, ONE LAST DAY TILL I CAN SLEEP IN,

CAUSE’ SUMMERS A STRUMMIN’, 

NO BUMMERS FORTHCOMIN’

EVERYTHING'S GOING' MY WAY!

 

SCHOOL IS OVERRATED, THAT’S THE TRUTH,

Jason: Oof-

 

Bret:  Nice wheels Shepherd! Hah hah.

 

Chumps: Hah hah hah

 

*Bret gesture for the chumps to stop laughing and they do.*

 

Jason:  Listen Bret, I would love to hang and be your practice dummy or whatever but-

 

*Bret thumps Jason on the back of the head.*

 

Jason:  See, I had a feeling you made an excellent bully, and I was right! Have a great day.

Bret: Boo ya!

 

Chumps: Nice! Haha Boo Ya! Yeah, good one Bret! Hah hah!

*Jason appears outside an open classroom window.*

 

Miss Blackwell:  Who would like to go first? Brittney?

 

Brittney: Umm- My dog ate it?

 

Blackwell:  You don’t have a dog.

 

Brittney: Right. Sorry…

 

Jason: Psst- Psst-

 

*Kaylee sees Jason waving outside the window. Jason gestures.*

 

Kaylee:  Uh uh- No way.

 

Jason: Just a distraction please?!

 

Kaylee: Fine.  Um- Miss Blackwell can you open the door?  It’s a bit toasty in here.

 

Blackwell:  I don’t see the harm.

 

*Miss Blackwell crosses to open the classroom door just as Jason thuds into the classroom through the window.*

 

Blackwell:  Jason Shepherd did- did you just come through that window?

 

Jason:  No.  You looked a little flushed.  I was merely creating a cross-draft.

 

Blackwell:  Well then, now that we’re all comfortable why don’t you share your paper with the class?

 

Jason: Let’s give someone else a chance!

 

Blackwell: No!  We’d like to hear yours.  You did do it, didn’t you?

 

*Music starts.*

Blackwell:  I think I will. Dwight you’re in charge.

Kaylee:  Are you nuts?  You’re totally gonna get busted!

 

*Jason’s cell phone rings.*

 

Jason:  Say “Harry Shepherd’s office.”

Jason:  Come on! Help me out.

 

Kaylee: No.

 

Jason: Do it.

 

Kaylee: No!

 

Jason: Do it!

Jason: 

 

Hello?  Oh yes Miss Blackwell.  It’s true.

 

*Music starts again.*

Chorus:

Jason:

 

IT WAS JASON, OH SWEET SON JASON, SO DEVOUT.

 

So I said, 

 

“BACK OFF GRIM REAPER”, I. AIN’T. 

DONE. 

LIVINGGGGGG. 

YET!

 

*Dramatic end to song.*

 

Jason: So with all my strength I burped that sucker out you bet!

And I owe it all to my son.  I’m sorry Miss Blackwell.  I should stop talking now. My throat is still very sore.  Thank you.

 

*Jason hangs up the phone and pockets his cell immediately as Miss Blackwell enters the classroom.*

 

Blackwell:  Jason!  I’m SO sorry.  You take all the time you need handing in that assignment.

 

Jason:  Thank you.

 

Blackwell:  So who would like to go next? Taylor!

 

*A school bell rings, the students all exit but Dwight stays seated. End scene.*

 

**Act 1, Scene 3**

 

*Later that day. Jason and Kaylee are walking down a hallway at school.*

 

Kaylee:  Only two more classes till summer! You wanna see a movie later to celebrate?

 

Jason:  Yeah, that sounds good to me-

 

*Miss Blackwell appears in a doorway to a classroom.*

 

Blackwell:  Just who I was looking for!

 

Kaylee: See ya.

 

*Kaylee exits.*

 

Jason:  As much as I’d love to chat I really have to get home to my dad-

 

Blackwell:  Oh really?

 

*Miss Blackwell steps aside to reveal Jason’s parents standing in the classroom.*

 

Dad:  How could you lie to us Jas?  You told me you wrote that paper.

 

Blackwell:  Unfortunately, that essay counts for 1/3 of Jason’s grade.  Without it he will fail and have to go to summer school.

 

Jason:  What? I can’t go to summer school?!

 

Mom:  There must be something he can do?

 

Blackwell:  I’m teaching an English course at the community college until 6pm.  If he can get it to me by then… I’ll consider counting it. But- don’t even think about plagiarizing, I want it hand-written.

 

Jason:  A thousand word story in only three hours?!

 

Dad:  That should be no problem, as making up stories seems to be your God given talent!

 

Mom:  Better get started.

 

*Jason’s parents and Miss Blackwell all exit as they leave him alone in the classroom to write as the clock ticks by.*

 

Jason:  This is hopeless. Ugh… Think!

 

*Music starts.*

 

Goin’ My Way (Reprise)

 

GOTTA GET THOSE JUICES FLOWIN’

‘CAUSE SUMMER'S GONNA BLOW IF,

I CAN’T MAN UP AND WRITE MY OWN- ESSAY.

 

*Jason’s Dad’s voice echoes “Making up stories seems to be your God given talent…”.*

 

Jason:  I got it! 

 

*Music builds.*

 

They say a little lie and grow bigger and bigger.

One man will pay the price.

People everywhere stopped and stared at the…

 

BIG.

FAT.

LIAR.

 

Done!

 

YEAH YOU BET THAT THIS WILL SHOW EM’,

MY WORDS WILL EVEN THOREAU EM’,

YEAH, EVERYTHING’S GOIN’ MY WAY!

 

*The song ends and Jason looks at the clock as it reads 5:45pm.*

 

Jason:  No!  Why did Bret have to destroy my skateboard today?

 

*Jason rushes out of the classroom. End scene.*

 

**Act 1, Scene 4**

 

*Lights up on Jason running down the street to the community college as a large limo speeds by and clips him, Jason is knocked down but seems okay.*

 

Limo Driver:  Sir? I think we just hit a kid.

 

Marty Wolf:  I’m on the phone!  Sorry, apparently we ran over a kid or something.

 

*The limo driver stops the car, gets out, and helps Jason to his feet.*

 

 Driver:  Are you okay?

 

Jason:  Yeah, but you’ve got to help me out.  I have to get to the community college in two minutes!

 

Driver: Um-- all right.

 

*The driver opens the door and gestures to get in. Jason starts to get in the Limo and is stopped by Marty Wolf.*

 

Wolf:  What’s going on?  Am I now running a taxi service I don’t know about?

 

Jason:  Relax.  I’m just going right down the street. You are luck I don’t sue you for whiplash.  In fact my neck does feel a bit stiff- ah- ah-

 

Wolf:  Can it. Get in. The shoes. The shoes! Watch the shoes!!

 

*Jason climbs over Marty into the limo and spills his papers out of his backpack.*

 

Jason: If you only knew the day I’ve had.

 

Wolf:  Must be really hard being 11.

 

Jason: I’m 14 actually.  Jason Shepherd.

 

Wolf:  Marty Wolf.  Famous Hollywood Producer.  I’m in town filming my newest picture…

 

Jason:  Oh yeah you’re that dude. No offense, but the last few years you have made quite a few stinkers…

 

Wolf:  It’s called a dry spell. All it takes is one hit to get you back to the top.

 

Jason:  That’s what I’m hoping with this story I’m handing in.

 

Wolf: Oh wow- Tell me more, tell me more.

 

Jason: Well, I tried to get out of it but the teacher busted me.

 

Wolf:  What’d you go with?  Dog ate your homework?

 

Jason:  No.  Dad choked on a meatball.

 

Wolf:  Yeah?  Let me guess, your teacher called your old man to confirm and you imitated his voice on the cell phone?

 

Jason:  Actually, yeah… pretty much.

 

Wolf:  Here’s where you went wrong Johnny.  You should have forged the doctor’s note, made your dad your sister, and changed the meatball to a chicken wing. Much easier to swallow.

 

Jason:  Wow, you’re good.

 

Wolf: No, no, no.  I’m the BEST.

 

Driver: We’re here.

 

Wolf:  Okay, God bless you Jared.

 

Jason:  It’s Jason.

 

Wolf:  And it always will be!  Keep practicing those lies, Jiminy. ‘Cause you can take it from me…  The truth?  It’s overrated.  Now GET OUT!

 

Jason:  Thanks for the ride gentlemen. 

 

Wolf:  Ciao!

 

*Jason exits the limo leaving behind his paper on the floor of the limo.*

 

Wolf:  Heyo- you left your… hmmm

 

*The limo pulls away. End scene.*

 

**Act 1, Scene 5**

 

*Lights up on Kaylee and Jason waiting in line at the movies.*

 

Jason: I swear.  I was running across town to turn my paper in and some limo hit me.  They offered me a ride and I spilled all my stuff.  I must have left my paper behind!

 

Kaylee:  Oh come on, you have told me the story a million times already. You’re a liar.

 

Jason:  I am a liar in general, that’s true.  But this time I’m telling the truth!  There was some guy in the limo. Marty something? Maybe he took it!

 

Kaylee:  Look this all MAY be true, but don’t you see why your parents and Miss Blackwell couldn’t believe you?

 

Jason: But now I’m literally dying in summer school. This is the worst summer ever.

 

Kaylee:  Hey, hang in there, at least you get to enjoy your weekends! 

 

Jason:  Yeah, but I shouldn’t even have to go to stupid summer school. 

 

*Jason and Kaylee make their way to their seats to watch a movie.*

 

Kaylee:  If it makes you feel any better my parents are taking a summer adventure without me.  Some river-rafting trip down the Grand Canyon…  But do I get an adventure?  NO.  My big adventure is staying with my grandma pearl and her toe fungus.

 

Jason:  Well you can hang out at my place, my sister is in charge and she’ll be off with her boyfriend.

 

Kaylee: What about your parents?

 

Jason: They are taking a two-week long vacation at some fancy resort and spa in Iceland for their anniversary, radio silence the next twelve hours.

 

*The movie projector flickers on.*

 

Kaylee:  It’s starting!

 

Jason:  It’s just the previews…

 

*A deep narration voice starts to speak as the preview plays.*

 

Narrator:

 In a time…

When a lie can grow bigger…

and bigger.

One man, will pay the price…

 

*Jason is sitting on the edge of his seat.*

 

Next summer, people everywhere…

will stop and stare.

Marty Wolf Pictures Presents…

Kaylee:  What do you think? Wanna se it?

 

Jason:  See it?  I think I wrote it.

 

Kaylee:  What? Hey-

*Jason grabs Kaylee and runs out to the movie theater lobby. Music starts.*

 

Let’s Take An Adventure

90s rock groove

 

Kaylee: Jason what is going on? Were gonna miss the beginning!

 

Jason:  I can’t go through my life having my parents think I’m a liar…

Jason:  Listen-

*Jason pulls a wad of cash out of his pocket.*

 

Jason: Three years of yard work and baby-sitting money.

 

Kaylee:  God- Do you just like carry that around with you?

 

*Smaller but with cute intensity.*

 

Jason:

*Both Jason and Kaylee run out of the movie theater lobby to their separate homes and throw a bag together in a packing montage.*

 

Both:

 

YEAH! WE DESERVE AN ADVENTURE

AND IF IT COMES TO IT WELL HAVE REVENGE OUR WAY!

 

LET’S TAKE AN ADVENTURE! 

OH- LET’S TAKE AN ADVENTURE!

*Music ends. Both Jason and Kaylee are packed and off on their way to LA. End scene.*

 

**Act 1, Scene 6**

 

*Jason and Kaylee have arrived in LA and are leaving the airport baggage claim with their bags.  Jason sees a limo chauffeur, Frank, with the name “STROOG” in bold letters.*

 

Jason:  Follow my lead.

 

Kaylee: Okay.

 

Jason:  Hi!  I’m Mr. Stroog.

 

Frank:  Hah- You serious?

 

Jason:  Is there a problem?

 

Frank:  No, no.  Uh- You’re just kind of young to be the biggest bedazzled denim distributer of the Midwest, you know?

 

Jason:  It’s a family business.  I’ve been bedazzling denim since I was a baby. 

 

Frank:  Okay.  I’m Frank.

 

Jason:  Frank, we want to get some sightseeing in before we bedazzle this whole town.

 

Frank:  Okay.  

 

*Frank leads them to the limo.*

 

Frank:  So here’s a little place I like to call Los Angeles!

 

*Music starts. Frank starts driving the limo throughout LA, we see the Hollywood sign, walk of fame, Chinese Theater, and surfers/beach goers on Venice Beach.*

 

How Awesome Is This?

Frank:  

 

(*HIP-HOP, RAP a la Fresh Prince)*

WELCOME TO THE PLACE I LIKE TO CALL HOME,

SO SIT BACK AND RELAX WHILE THIS CHAUFFER ROAMS.

 

MANY COME ALONG JUST FOR SOME FORTUNE AND FAME,

OTHERS JUST ON BUSINESS OR PLEASURE- THE SAME.

 

TRY TOO HARD TO FIT IN AND YOU MIGHT GET DISMISSED,

FROM BEACHES, TO BACKLOTS, TO “HEY, ARE YOU ON THE LIST?”

 

WE’VE GOT STARS LIKE MARILYN, MICHAEL, MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY,

REMEMBER IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS JUST ASK ME,

 

HOLLYWOOD BABY!  HOW AWESOME IS THIS?

OF ALL THE CITIES, IT’S NUMBER ONE ON THE LIST!

YEAHHHH- HOW AWESOME IS THIS?

 

*Jason points out the Universal Studios Tours sign.*

 

Jason: Look!

 

SOME SAY LA, “THE SECOND CITY OF SIN!”

BUT WITH SIGHTS LIKE THESE, I MEAN TEN OUT OF TEN.

 

DID I MENTION THE RAD FOOD?

EATING OUT HERE IS NEVER A MISS,NO MATTER YOUR MOOD, LIKE HOW AWESOME IS THIS?

*Frank throws a handful of takeout menus and restaurant fliers through the window to the kids to read.*

 

Kaylee:  Hey we’d love to take one of those movie set tours! Can you drop us off right up here?

 

*Music stops.* 

 

Frank: Erm- yes ma’am, of course!

 

*Kaylee and Jason smile at each other. The Limo and Music stop right outside the “Universal Studios” look alike Backlot.*

 

Jason:  Thanks for the lift Frank. I think she’s secretly hoping to meet Reese Witherspoon. *(or ad lib celebrity)*

 

Frank:  Oh- Here’s my card.  If you need a ride, give me a shout.

 

Jason: Thanks!  
  


*Jason and Kaylee hop out of the limo and onto the back of a Tour Cart just as it is about to take off.*

 

Tour Guide:  Welcome Ladies and Gentlemen!  I’m Adam your tour guide…

 

Kaylee: So what’s the plan?

 

Jason:  When we get to Wolf’s building we hop off, storm his office, and make him admit he stole my story.

 

Kaylee:  That’s it?  That’s the lamest plan I’ve ever heard.

 

Jason:  Trust me.  It’s gonna work.

 

Tour Guide:  So stay tuned!  This is the back lot where many of our hit movies are made.  And, speaking of movies, in just a few days we’re beginning filming… next summers smash hit movie- Big Fat Liar!

 

Jason: Here. Lets go!

 

*Jason and Kaylee hop off the cart ducking through the bustling back lot set full of moving set pieces and characters dressed in various styles of costumes.*

 

Kaylee: Security!

 

*Jason sees the Marty Wolf Pictures Building.*

 

Jason: This way.

 

*Jason and Kaylee exit, end scene.*

 

**Act 1, Scene 7**

 

*Interior of Marty Wolf Pictures.  A female receptionist sits behind her desk taking calls for Marty. She is a dog lover. She has dog bobble heads, wearing a dog collar, and has a picture of her dog on her desk. Her name plate on her desk reads Astrid Barker - Receptionist. A man in a hat and sunglasses is seen yelling up at a closed office door.*

 

Jaleel:  My name is Jaleel White.  Urkel was a character I played when I was a child!  Watch yourself, Wolf. Watch yourself.

 

*Jaleel storms out of the office building just as Jason and Kaylee Enter.*



Jason: I don’t think I have ever seen so many I love dogs bumper stickers on one car.



Kaylee: Look-



*The kids walk towards the front desk.*

 

Astrid:  Marty Wolf Pictures, please hold.  Marty Wolf Pictures, please hold.  Marty Wolf Pictures- Can I help you?

 

Jason: We’re here to see Marty Wolf.

 

Astrid:  Do you have an appointment?

 

Jason:  I ask you, Astrid, what kind of sick world is this…

when children need an appointment to see their own father?

 

Astrid: Mr. Wolf doesn’t have any children.

 

Jason:  Not that he knows of-

 

Kaylee:  Shhh!

 

Jason: Look this is going to be an emotional reunion for all of us, so once you let us in you're probably going to want to hold all papa's calls and you know what clear the rest of his day while you’re at it.

 

Astrid:  Mr. Wolf doesn’t see anyone without an appointment.  Marty Wolf Pictures.  No, she stepped out for the day. I’d love to take a message. Got it.

 

Jason:  Fine.

 

*Jason pulls Kaylee aside.*

 

Jason: Help me out.

 

Kaylee: No.

 

Jason: Help me out.

 

Kaylee: No

 

Jason: Help me out. Help me out. Help me out.

 

Kaylee: No. No. No. Okay!

 

Jason:  Oh-

 

*Jason looks around and then sneaks with Kaylee down the hallway out of earshot.*

 

Jason:  Here.

 

*Jason hands his cell phone to Kaylee.*

 

Astrid:  Marty Wolf Pictures.

 

Kaylee:  Hi, Astrid Barker please?

 

Astrid:  Speaking.

 

*Jason mimes what to say next.*

 

Kaylee:  This is Deloris del Rio down in parking.  Do you drive a Saturn?

 

Astrid:  Yes.

 

Kaylee:  Well it’s umm-

 

*Kaylee pulls away the phone.*

 

Jason:  Parked on a dog.

 

Kaylee: I’m not going to say that!

 

Jason: Come on!

 

*Kaylee goes back to the phone.*

 

Astrid:  Hello?

 

 Kaylee:  Your car is parked on a dog.

 

Astrid:  My car is parked on a dog?

 

Kaylee:  Yea ma’am, in the tail area to be more specific.

 

*Jason starts pretending to be the dog. He starts to whimper and whine.*

 

Kaylee:  It’s gruesome actually.

 

Astrid:  Hang on, I’m coming! Don’t die!  Just stay!  Keep breathing!

 

*Astrid drops the phone, grabs her keys, and runs out of the building. Kaylee hangs up the phone.*

 

*Jason and Kaylee exit the closet and creep down back to the now empty lobby.*

 

Jason:  All right, you keep look out.  I’m sure this thing will be over in just a few minutes.

 

*Jason exits towards Marty’s Office, while Kaylee sits at the reception desk and answers calls.*

 

Kaylee:  Marty Wolf Pictures.  No he is not, can I take a message?  Mr. Wolf is about to go into a meeting.  Uh- uh- San- Sandler? Mhm.  Can you spell it?

 

*End Scene.*

 

**Act 1, Scene 8**

 

*Inside Marty Wolf’s office. Marty is having a melt down.*

 

Marty:  We’re not just looking for SOME personal organizer Monty!  The thing is my life!  If you have lost it then you have killed me!  Simple as that!  

 

Monty:  I understand that.

 

Marty:  No you don’t!  You always say that. No you don’t.

 

Monty:  Did you check your jacket pocket?

 

*Jason appears in the doorway to Marty’s office.*

 

Marty:  What do I look like a moron?

 

Monty:  No, it’s just if you can recall-

 

Marty: Fine, Monty, fine.  If it will make you happy, I’ll check my jacket pocket.

 

*Beat.*

 

Marty:  It’s in there. 

 

*Marty pulls out and kisses his organizer while clutching it tightly.*

 

Marty:  Oh, thank god-

 

Jason:  Um- hello. Excuse me.  Hey, how’s it going?

 

Marty:  Ah, who are you?

 

Jason:  Jason Shepherd.  Remember me?  I wrote Big Fat Liar.

 

Marty: Ah- Monty hold all my calls.  Give me a few minutes alone here with Mr. Shepherd.

 

*Monty exits the office. Music starts.*

 

The Big Bad Wolf 

Marty:

 

WELL, WELL, WELL…

WOULD YOU LOOKIE HERE,

IT’S MR. JASON SHEPHERD,

FROM ACROSS THE SPHERE.

 

YOU CAN IMAGINE MY SURPISE,

BOY I DID JUMP.

SEEING YOUR LITTLE FACE HERE,

MAKES ME FEEL LIKE QUITE A CHUMP.

 

SO LITTLE MAN WHY SO BLUE?

YOU’RE IN THE WOLF’S PRIDE LAND, SO WHAT CAN I DO?

 

Jason:  You know why I’m here. I want you to call my dad and tell him you stole the story from me.

 

Marty:

 

YOU WANT ME TO CALL YOUR DAD, OH WOW THAT’S RICH!

YOU TRAVLED ACROSS THE COUNRTY AND THAT’S YOUR PITCH?

 

Jason:  It’s the truth, and you’re the only one he will believe.  You make that call and you will never hear from me again.

 

*Beat.* *Marty crosses to his desk and takes Jason’s paper out of a drawer along with a box of cigars.*

 

Marty:

 

YOU KNOW WHAT JASON, YOU GOT IT, YOU’RE RIGHT!

YOUR STORY IS GOLD, COME ON BUD, HOW BOUT A LIGHT?

 

*Marty tosses a lighter to Jason as for him to light his cigar.*

 

Marty: Whoops!

 

 *Jason does and Marty ashes on the paper setting it on fire dropping it into a waste basket.*

 

Marty:

 

OH MY GOSH, NO, WHAT HAVE I DONE?

I’LL PUT IT OUT QUICK, NOW STEP BACK SON!

Jason: No!

 

*Marty* *grabs a bottle of alcohol off his desk and douses the fire, only making it worse.*

 

Marty:  Oops! Hmhmhmmm.

 

Jason:  You’re sick! All I wanted was for you to call my dad and tell him I wrote the paper?

 

Marty: Or what?

 

YOU’LL SPITBALL ME?

A WEDGIE, OH NO I’M SCARED!

THIS IS HOLLWOOD BABY! AND THESE RULES AIN’T FAIR.

 

SO LISTEN REAL CLOSE, FOR IT’S NOT JUST A HUNTCH,

WHEN YOU PLAY WITH THE WOLF YOU’LL BE FOR LUNCH

 

*(chorus)*

I’M THE BIG BAD WOLF,

KING OF FILMS AND LA SUN,

ANYTHING I WANT YEAH I GET IT DONE.

 

FOR I’M THE BIG BAD WOLF,

AND THIS ALPHA WEIGHS A TON,

SO BETTER LACE UP QUICK AND START TO RUN.

 

*Marty jumps onto his desk and has a Tap Dance Break.*

 

Jason:  I’m not leaving until you make that call!

 

Marty:  Oh, I’ll make a call all right…

 

*Marty calls security on his desk phone.*

 

Marty:  Yeah we got a code W… Yep, another angry writer refusing to leave.

 

*While Marty is on the phone Jason sees a Digital Personal Organizer on Marty’s desk and he takes it. Marty slams the phone down without noticing.*

 

Jason: No!

 

Marty:

 

YOU SEE THAT JAS,

WELL, THE WOLF JUST WON.

SO PACK YOUR BAGS NOW, CAUSE WE- ARE DONE!

 

NEXT!

 

*Song ends and two security guards enter.*

 

Jason: I tried to play fair Wolf, but you don’t know who you are messing with!  You asked for it! Come on!

 

*The two security guards drag Jason out.*

 

Marty:  Don’t call us, we’ll call you! Never! Wolf out!

 

*End scene.*

 

**Act 1, Scene 9**

 

*Lobby Marty Wolf Pictures. Jason is being booted from the building. Kaylee sits at reception still taking calls.*

 

Jason: I’m telling the truth!

 

Security Guard:  Yeah, and I wrote the nutty professor! (or ad lib any movie)

 

*Kaylee abandons her post and follows Jason out of the building. Exterior Wolf Pictures.*

 

Jason: What can I say, Kaylee?  It’s a dog-eat-dog town! They play by their own rules here.

 

Kaylee:  Does that mean we are going home?

 

Jason:  Yeah, we’re going home…right after Wolf admits he stole my story!

 

Kaylee:  Umm…didn’t you just find out Wolf isn’t going to admit the truth?

 

Jason:  He’ll do it.

 

Kaylee:  How?

 

Jason: I have his life in the palm of my hand.

 

*Jason reveals he has swiped and is holding Marty’s personal organizer.*

 

Kaylee:  Great, so we’re stealing now?

 

Jason:  It’s not stealing, it’s borrowing; and besides he stole from me first!  This thing has got Wolf’s  Schedule, alarm codes, and credit card numbers.  Now we just need to come up with a plan.

 

Kaylee:  Jason…

 

Jason:  I can’t go home till my dad knows the truth.  You didn’t see the way he looked at me.  It was like- I wasn’t his kid anymore…

 

Kaylee:  Okay. I’m with you but does this plan maybe include food, or a place to sleep?

 

Jason:  The guard!

 

Kaylee:  Let’s get out of here.

 

Guard:  Hey!

 

Jason:  This way.  Let’s check out that warehouse!

 

*Jason and Kaylee run off to evade the security guard.  Scene change from outside Wolf studio building.*

 

**Act 1, Scene 10**

 

*Interior of an old Hollywood storage warehouse.  It is full packed with costumes, set pieces, games, and various memorabilia. The area is dimly lit.*

 

Kaylee:  I think we lost him.

 

*Jason crosses to a panel on the wall and flips a giant power switch illuminating the whole warehouse.*

 

Both: Woah.

 

Jason:  I think we found our temporary home.

 

Kaylee:  Look at all this stuff!

 

Jason:  Time to have some fun.

 

Kaylee:  What do you have in mind?

 

Jason:  I think it’s time to go shopping.

 

*Music starts. Music montage of “I wish” by Hairbrain as Jason and Kaylee run through the storage putting on wacky clothes. Jason and Kaylee alternate showing outfits, then Jason shows off a few, then Jason disappears as Kaylee continues changing and then roams through the warehouse.*

 

Kaylee:  Jas?

 

Jason:  I’m at the beach!

 

*Kaylee walk to the opposite side of the warehouse to reveal Jason in swim trunks, Hawaiian shirt, and sunglasses under a large beach umbrella, next to him is a pile of empty coke cans.  He is also holding a coke can shakily while pulling his cell out to dial.*

 

Jason:  Hey Frank!  It’s Mr. Stroog, meet us outside the studio gates in 10!

 

*Jason then hangs up and proceeds to chug the last of the can he is holding and then picks up a paddle ball and bounces it rapidly.*

 

Kaylee:  What’s with the cokes?

 

Jason:  The machine.  It’s rigged. They’re free.  They’re free!

 

Kaylee:  Well I couldn’t sleep much either.  Too much cool stuff! 

 

Jason:  Frank.  Outside.  Ten minutes.

 

Kaylee:  Copy!

 

**Act 1, Scene 11**

 

*Lights up outside we see an impatient Frank standing outside his limo right outside the studio gates.*

 

Frank:  How totally awesome is this? Stupid.

 

*Jason and Kaylee enter arm in arm strolling up to Frank.*

 

Jason: Good morning Frank.  Let’s get moving, LA is not going to bedazzle itself!

 

Frank: Yeah.

 

*Frank opens the door for them and hops in after and locks it behind himself.*

 

Frank:  The biggest bedazzled denim distributer of the Midwest my butt!  I have a lot of words for you little mister, but I’ll keep it to the facts.  You owe me a hundred dollars for yesterdays little joyride plus tip, you almost cost me my job, and-

 

Jason:  I’m sorry-

 

Frank:  I don’t wanna hear it!

 

Jason:  I can explain.

 

Frank:  D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D Hear that?

 

Jason:  Just-

 

Frank:  D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D

 

Jason:  I know, I just-

 

Frank:  D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D

 

Jason:  If you-

 

Frank:  D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D

 

Jason:  Don’t- 

 

Frank:  D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-  D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-

 

Jason:  Sorry, we just came here to get even with this Marty Wolf Guy.  He stole my story and is making it into a big movie and-

 

Frank:  Woah- Woah- Woah- Did you just say Marty Wolf?

 

Jason:  Yeah.  Do you know him?

 

*Music Starts.*

 

The Meanest Man Alive

*Smooth Jazz Patter*

 

Frank:  Know him?  Let me tell you a little something about Marty Wolf…

 

Frank:

 

MARTY WAS THE GUY THAT YOU WANTED TO DRIVE,

A GOLD MINE FOR SURE TO ANY CHAUFFEUR ALIVE…

HIS TEMPER ALWAYS SHORT, THE KIND YOU’D PRAY TO SURVIVE.

 

BUT ONE DAY LAST YEAR, I MADE A MISTAKE.

ASKED HIM FOR A FAVOR, I JUST WANTED MY BREAK.

 

HE COULD HAVE SAID NO, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IT RIGHT THERE.

INSTEAD HE CALLED ME A LOSER, RIGHT TO MY FACE I SWEAR.

THAT’S WHEN I KNEW HE WAS THE MEANEST MAN ALIVE OR ANYWHERE.

 

*Music vamps.*

 

Frank:  I just asked him if I could get an audition and he takes my headshot, writes loser across my forehead and faxes it to every casting director in town…

 

Kaylee:  Oh, you poor thing.

 

Frank: So if you wanna mess with the Wolf I got your back.  Oh, and I know someone else who might want to help, I’ll shoot her a text.

 

*Frank starts to drive.*

 

IT’S MARTY’S EX WIFE, SHE GOES BY PAT.

SHE’S A SENIOR V.P. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

 

SHE WORKS WITH HIM STILL, HOW SHE DOES IT I’LL NEVER KNOW.

HE LEFT HER WHEN HE HEARD THE CANCER WAS STARING TO GROW.

 

YEAH, THE MEANEST MAN ALIVE HE TRULY IS,

HE WOULDN’T BE WHERE IS IF IT WASN’T THE BIZ.

THE MEANEST MAN ALIVE THAT’S FOR SURE,

HE’S THE SPAWN OF SATAN AND THERE’S NO CURE!

 

Kaylee:  Oh my gosh…

 

Jason:  This guy sucks!

 

*Frank gets a text.*

 

Frank: She’s in.

 

*Frank stops the limo as we see they have arrived out front Wolf Pictures. We see an old man carrying a cardboard box full of his things and Frank rolls down his window to talk.*

 

Frank: Vince? What happened?  Vince is Marty’s stunt coordinator.

 

*Vince saunters over to the limo window.*

 

Vince:

 

Well Marty finally did it he fired me-

 

HE WAS SO LOUD AND RUDE BUT I KEPT MY LID.

ALL ‘CAUSE I ASKED FOR ONE DAY WITH MY KID.

HE LOOKED AT ME AND  SAID, “THAT AIN’T GONNA FLY!”

“GUESS WHAT, YOUR GONE, OKAY? BYE-BYE-BYE

 

 

THEN THAT MEAN OLD WOLF JUST LAUGHED AT ME AND SCREAMED,

SO I JUST ZONED OUT, I COULDN'T TAKE THAT HORRIBLE FIEND.

 

HE’S THE MEANEST MAN ALIVE, YEAH THAT I’VE DEEMED,

I BET HE SLEEPS THROUGH THE NIGHT TO THE SOUND OF SCREAMS.

HE’S THE MEANEST MAN ALIVE, YOU COULD SAY THAT AGAIN

NEXT TIME I’LL KNOW TO NEVER CALL HIM A FRIEND.

 

*Music ends.*

 

Vince:  It’s just- it’s my daughter's birthday.  They got a clown and everything!  See…

 

Frank:  Aw- Vince.

 

*Vince holds up a party invitation shaped like a clown's face that has blue skin and crazy orange hair.  Jason rolls down his window.*

 

Jason:  Can I borrow that?

 

Vince: Huh?

 

Frank:  They are cool.  They’re with me.

 

Vince: Um- yeah sure.

 

*Vince hands Jason the birthday invitation though the window.*

 

Jason:  I think I’ve got it.  Vince I wouldn’t worry about Marty Wolf for too long.  Frank anywhere close by we can go and pick up some supplies?

 

Frank:  You got it boss!  Vince, enjoy the birthday party.  Oh, and if you ever need a ride, you call me, okay?

 

*Frank hands Vince one of his cards and pulls off.*

 

Kaylee:  So what’s the plan?

 

Jason:  Well I was thinking--

 

*Just then Jason’s cell phone rings.  Jason sees it’s his dad.*

 

Jason:  It’s my dad.

 

Kaylee:  Take it!

 

*Jason answers the phone. Jason’s dad appears on the other side of the stage in a spotlight on the phone.*

 

Jason:  Hello?

 

Dad:  Hey, Jas.

 

Jason:  Hey, Dad!

 

Dad:  Just called to see how you were doing?

 

Jason:  Umm doing good.  Ya know, staying out of trouble.

 

*Frank slams on the breaks and honks the horn.  The other cars honk back.*

 

Dad:  What’s that noise?

 

Jason:  Just doing an experiment with the different frequencies of horns for science class.

 

Dad:  Just wanted to check in cause you looked upset when we left.

 

Jason:  Yeah, about that, Dad.  I just want you to know, I totally get what you said about the whole trust thing.  I think when you get back; you’ll see I’ve been trying really hard to earn it.

 

Dad:  Glad to hear it, pal.

 

Jason:  Love you Dad.

 

Dad:  Love ya.

 

*Jason hangs up the phone.*

 

Jason:  Call forwarding.  Gotta love it.  What about your parents?  Think they’ll call?

 

Kaylee:  They are in the middle of a canyon.  No phones.

 

Jason:  Right.  Hey, thanks for coming out here with me.

 

Kaylee:  I came for the adventure, remember?  Now tell us this plan!

 

Frank:  What the lady said!

 

*End Scene*

 

**Act 1, Scene 12**

 

*Lights up on Marty Wolf’s house.  Marty is in bed sleeping next to his plush stuffed monkey named Mr. Funny Bones.  An alarm clock rings.*

 

Marty:  It’s showtime Mr. Funny Bones! Look out! Pss! Pss! Pss! Ow! Pss! Pss! Pss! Cut it out Marty! Pss! Pss! Pss!  Let’s dance Mr. Funny Bones!

 

*Marty hops out of bed, stretches and then “Hungry like the Wolves” starts playing.  He proceeds to picks the monkey, start dancing, and then spanking himself to the rhythm with the monkey.  During this action we see a limo arrive outside Marty’s house.  Jason, Kaylee, and Frank hop out and are dressed in all black.  Kaylee is carrying a backpack and they all have walkie talkies.*

 

Jason:  Okay we all know our jobs right?  Let’s do this!

 

*Jason and Kaylee sneak in through the front while Frank keeps lookout in the back.*

*At this point Marty is blasting the music and has left the monkey on his bed while dancing like a maniac in his living room.  Jason sneaks up to the master bedroom, while Kaylee heads straight offstage for the bathroom. Jason looks around Marty's closet and finds his phone and earpiece layed out.* 

 

Jason:  Mr. Earpiece, meet Mrs. Mega Glue.

 

*Jason puts a nice glob of super glue onto Marty’s earpiece and then enters back into the bedroom just as Kaylee enters.*

 

Kaylee:  Shampoo “a la arancia”, check!

 

Jason:  Nice!

 

*Jason holds up his walkie talkie.*



Jason:  Agent Viper to Agent Falcon, all clear inside.   How’s the backyard look?

 

Frank:  Agent Falcon?  Erm- all clear!

 

Jason:  Okay, we’re coming out. You still have the blue dye?

 

Kaylee:  Check!

 

*Kaylee holds up the backpack.* 

 

Jason:  All right, let’s go.

 

*Jason and Kaylee start to exit the bedroom down to the backyard but Jason doubles back for the monkey.  As Jason and Kaylee are making their way down from the bedroom they have a close encounter with Marty as he is still dancing but drinking his coffee and then exits.  They quickly exit the house to the backyard.  Jason checks Marty’s personal organizer, while Kaylee opens the backpack and passes each one of them a bottle of blue dye.*

 

Jason:  According to Marty’s organizer we have about five minutes until his morning swim, so let’s be quick.

 

Frank:  Can you imagine the look on his face-

 

Kaylee:  We’ve got to go, daydream later! Move! Move!

 

*All three exit the stage and we see a pale Marty  in a speedo, diving cap, and goggles walk onto the stage, dance, stretch and the exit the opposite side of the stage and just then a diving sound effect.  Shortly after, we see a Marty painted/dyed bright blue. Marty enters, dances back up to his bathroom, while drying and taking off the goggles and swim cap last before hopping into the shower. Still oblivious to his color, we hear the shower shut off, and we see a blue arm reach out for a towel. Marty steps out of the shower with full blue body and bright orange hair.  Marty is still humming happily until wipes the fog off the mirror and sees himself for the first time.*

 

Marty:  OH, MY GODDDDDDDDD!!!!

 

*End Scene. End of Act 1.*

Then I went and bought a thermometer to test the water temp in the cup (pre-heated) to see what I'd get. I have..
PID set to 103c predicting the offset from boiler to water will be ~10c. 
So I'm aiming for 93c into the basket
In the cup, I'm struggling to get 72c
Predicting I'm getting 93 into the basket, should I be losing another 11 degrees into the cup. It's preheated fyi. 


More background:
Instantly thinking the thermometer is shite, I tested it with the kettle at a temp of 95 degrees. Measured 90 in the cup. Taking into consideration temp drop into the cup I thought it was a rough way of getting something.
Based on this crude test the maths suggests I should get at least 87 in to the cup from my GCP. I'm stumped.


Before I go dropping big coin on something with an E61 group head, has anyone had a similar issue?
Or
Has an explanation for such a variance in Temp set at the PID and in the cup?

I am on day 15 without sweets and added sugar, and after an unsuspected painful withdrawal (the deceiving monster of depression hit me for a couple of days), the cravings smoothed out and became manageable, and my mood elevated. I feel very motivated this far, also because of the unsuspected benefits

1. I'm back in my critical pair of jeans (probably due to water loss, but I don't care)

2. my taste improved (even milk tastes really sweet to me, let alone sugar-free banana oatmeal bread)

3. my sense of smell became animal-like (which is rather irritating when you are in public transport and you smell the alcoholic even when they are not sitting close to you—or myself for that matter)

4. my vision improved

5. I feel my brain is more direct (if that makes any sense)

So wonderful, so far. But this morning I woke energized and fine and had my usual two coffees—and boy, they really kicked me badly. I was shaking, felt nauseous and was close to a panic attack. I had a lot of difficulty during the balance poses during my morning yoga, and my trembling got so bad during meditation that my teeth started clattering. I really felt like I couldn't do it because I didn't have the energy to sit upright. So, my question: 

Does the lack of sugar somehow interfere with the absorption of caffeine?

1ibxsx8,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ibxsx8,Am I overreacting for leaving a date after waiting for a while?,"So, as the text says I (f23) went on a date with a woman (f28). I met her on Bumble. We set a date for drinks on Friday evening, but I asked to reschedule because I had just received a painful email from my ex, and didn’t exactly feel romantic. The next day we met up at a book café. I was already there to read a bit, and settle into the environment. However, she was half an hour late and arrived sweating, panting, and trembling. She said it was due to drinking too much coffee, which she does while she smokes weed. (I live in the Netherlands, so it’s totally legal to smoke, but not with excessive amounts of coffee. Bad combo.) When I saw this, I offered to get drinks to give her a moment to settle in, and I didn’t make a big deal out of it. Shortly after our drinks, we left to have a walk through the same park that I proposed to meet up at for our second date. I showed her a secret entrance, that she didn’t know and mentioned she had struggled finding, but there’s also big main entrances. She also mentioned she had gone there before… 

She was very into me. She immediately kissed me, after I translated a poem to me, and was constantly trying to get closer to me. I thought it was a bit much for a first date. I was more concerned with getting to know her.. At the end of the date she asked me to share some of the worst things I had done. I shared two drunken stories, but she then came with a story about an ex where she had left a lot of cash, and that she had broken into her house with the police after not receiving word from her ex. Although I don’t judge and understand that if a person leaves you no choice, you kind of have to, it did leave me wondering why for heaven’s sake she would bring such a thing up on the first date… Oh well. You could say that was definite a “red flag” for me.

Also, she just didn’t make an effort to look good for the date. Her eyebrows were lined weirdly and chalky. She was wearing a plain black t-shirt, while I had made an effort with both my clothes and make up. 

Now, for our second date I proposed to meet up at that same park for a walk with my dog and a little smoke. I made sure to leave there about 15 minutes early, so my dog could do her thing and I didn’t have to rush there. Once I arrived there, I checked my phone to text her, and saw that she would be 15 min late. This really annoyed me. She knew I would be taking my dog. The weather was cold and unpleasant, and we had specifically set that time. I’m Dutch. I show up on time. I get nervous being 1 minute late… So, I decided to go into the park with my dog, away from the traffic, and after about 15 minutes of walking we reached the end and my dog was pulling to go home. I look at my phone, don’t see any of her texts, and given the fact that last time she said she was 10 min late and it turned out to be 30, I figured I’d wait a few more minutes before leaving. I did that, and then walked home with my dog. 

The texts in the pictures are what followed after that. In her defence, she did try to call me and text me over Instagram, but I hardly use it and have my notifications turned off. I did tell her I hardly use Insta, which she could’ve know, bc she sent me 2 videos on there, which I responded to with a great delay, while I respond quickly over WhatsApp and normal call.

1ibxs39,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1ibxs39/i_just_realized_how_toxic_a_subreddit_was/,I just realized how toxic a subreddit was,"So. It’s dawned me heavily that a Reddit community I was in was heavily toxic. They would constantly talk about how “if he wanted to he would” and I just did a chat got search and found out why it’s so toxic. I remember being called out on Snapchat for saying it and thinking about it now I’m kinda glad I got out of that toxic environment. It wasn’t as safe as I thought it was. Cause like they banned me for constantly venting about my issues related to the subreddit and then said I had contribute to the betterment of myself and other people to not be banned which is ironic cause I used to respond to a lot of people and help others. But they only looked at the most recent times and it showed I only posted and commented on my own stuff. I don’t think they understood that I didn’t have the mental capacity to help others at the time. I haven’t had it like I used to since starting Reddit. In fact. In the beginning. All I did was ever comment trying to help people. But that’s besides the fact 

I hate how they enforce the idea that if someone wanted they would. Like it’s true to an extent. But they were full force believing it word for word. And it just kinda worries me now. Cause chat gpt is right. It’s very judgmental sounding. And it doesn’t allow the other person to even have a say or explain their behavior. It also makes a judgement based off their personal knowledge with the person and not the actual persons thoughts, life style or thinking patterns. I love how chat even talks about how we need to be more understanding and accepting of others peoples own ways of developing relationships since everyone is different. It even talks about how communication is key to a relationship and a lot of that community focused on telling others to go no contact with the other person which isn’t as effective for everyone as it helps or hinders different people. 

While I don’t think my view point on my situation changes now thinking of it, it does make me want to focus more on communicating and working on ways we can better a relationship in the healthiest manner. While I don’t think I can say I’ll implement these ideas into the situation with classroom guy, I do find it very helpful for my future crushes/limerences cause now I can think about what actually builds a healthy relationship rather than focusing on what I solely can do to “make the situation better”. Cause NC isn’t always the solution. I’ve always found myself more stable staying in contact and having consistent interaction. So now I think what I need to focus on is how I can create healthy boundaries and cultivate a relationship that focused on what we (the guy I like and I) know about each other and how we can work together to make the best of this relationship.  

I know this might seem naive but I just feel better knowing that I’m not thinking in a black and white mannor. I’m allowing there to be uncertainty rather than basing everything off assumptions. Cause in the end: we really don’t know this person. The most we could get out of the interactions and time apart is their priorities. And it doesn’t always mean they don’t care. Classroom guy. When I saw him for coffee last Sunday. He reiterated to me that he wanted to be there for me. And he even said he enjoyed our time. And so I feel like being in that community would have totally washed me from that realty: something he said instead focusing on what he actually wants and means. 

I know this sounds stupid and I’m gonna get backlash. But I just feel like being out of that community has helped me cause there’s no pressure to do what they all do. And while I’d love for more emotional support, it allows me to think on my own rather creating a hive mind. Which is very common on Reddit. 

It’s just what I’m kinda thinking now. I doubt I’ll use any of this info to help classroom guy situation. But I will use some of it for sure. Right now I’m being very avoidant. I gave up talking to him for a week in exchange for five bucks. (Sorry classroom guy) and it’s been very helpful. I think giving him space has helped him but also benefited me cause now I can reset and think of healthier ways to approach our relationship. I want to create a more balanced dynamic when I continue talking to him (ie texting less cause he clearly doesn’t interest in texting first.  (Hasn’t texted first for the last 6 months but that might just be his nature)). I don’t know. I know I shouldn’t prioritize money over friendships but this literally ain’t gonna last after this semester cause I am getting tired of Initiating everything. So yeah. It doesn’t matter to me. He won’t notice or care anyway. He never does.

At first it was great, we hung out a couple times a week, and I genuinely enjoyed spending time with them. 

When we moved in we set some weekly/bi weekly chores. Nothing crazy ex: take 10-15 minutes and sweep/take out the trash/wipe down the stove etc. The first week they chipped in. After that nothing. I would bring it up every week or two and they said they would get on it but they never did. The house we live in has a tiny kitchen, no dishwasher, and one bathroom. It’s been three months. And I have been doing the chores for them like the conflict avoidant midwesterner I am. I’m not a neat freak, I’m normally relaxed and level headed but it’s getting to the point where I’m getting annoyed and shits getting disgusting, like dried period blood on the bathroom floor disgusting. 

I’ve never had a roommate situation like this, in the past I’ve always had really mature communication with the people I live with and it’s been great. But now I’m the house cunt cause I got bitchy over a roll of toilet paper. 

Last week, I was using the bathroom and one of my roommates had used the last of the toilet paper, and not replaced it. This isn’t the first time this has happened and I had about a half pot of coffee that morning so I was in a tough situation. 

After I made the dirtiest trek of all time to get TP I sent a text saying “Hey y’all can we please try to remember to restock the toilet paper from the drawer in the hallway if you use the rest in the bathroom?”

My roommate who didn’t replace the toilet paper replied “Sorry, I meant to restock and forgot. But I feel overall we do a decent job of remembering. Would you disagree?”

I just had my morning shit ruined and getting questioned if it was an issue ticked me off, so in a fit of pettiness I replied “A 'my bad' would have been just fine. I’m just bringing it up because I don’t want to waddle with shit on my ass to get the tp.”

Now two of them won’t talk to me. 

I don't know if they've picked up of the fact I'm annoyed that I'm the only one cleaning or if they're actually mad about the TP comment.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**First and foremost, and to make it abundantly clear:** This is not an attack in any capacity to people who are utterly obsessed with Caleb, or people who despise him for whatever reason. This is **MY** *opinion* and my thought process, and hopefully someone find some solution on what do i do with Caleb on my game, so they enjoy theirs.

So, here we go *de mujers:*

On a game like LaD's i don't like to rush through the story because of the lack of constant updates, i like to take my time with it, however; because i was hyperfocus on obtaining blue tickets to pull for the Pulse Hunter as so many of us, and thanks to the prize tickets from the inquiry event of this New Lunar Years/ Caleb re-introduction event; i did finished the recent story update which was Caleb's branch.

I was apprehensive to go through it because for the first two days this subreddit was a Nightmare Alley type of circus with people either dropping dead of happiness with Caleb (up to the point as being his main wrecker), and other one's wanting to attempt drop an atomic bomb to the servers so he could be delete it. I read by accident some things like he k!ll a child and i was flabbergasted (he did not do it, btw) and make me apprehensive to read it.



[me the first two days of the released on the subreddit, official and unofficial:](https://preview.redd.it/swk83bepbpfe1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=119e92cb183b205a8de34e4ce17ea448f60562ef)



I have mixed feelings about Caleb: i LOVE his character design and how different he looks from the rest of LI's; he doesn't have a sharp jaw, a small nose or a small face. His face is long, he have cheekbones and fatty cheeks, a big nose, thick eyebrows the ''boy next door looks'' with a jock body, i simply love it. On a tactical level, his regular companion has a good crowd control even with 3\* memories, and i enjoy the fact that Infold is adding more tech related visuals on the animations, a fresh air of the more mysticism or mythological designs. Also i enjoy he's playful, because the only playful character we had before Caleb come was Rafayel; Sylus, Xavier and Zayne share different nuances of being the stoic man.

I wish i know who is the english voice actor of Caleb, because,, what's he's doing? **that 🫵**. Love me some sensual high male voice. Shoutout to him and he keeps getting booked, properly pay and celebrated

**Now**, why i don't like about him? Yandere tropes, and i highly dislike Dark Romance too, or territorial personality LI's, I saw an image (i don't know if is real) of Caleb holding MC hand and saying to her: ''You can't leave without my permission'' and i wanted to puke for 3 minutes and a half. I don't enjoy the pipsqueak alias neither but that's more manageable for me, as someone who has Sylus as his second main (first Zayne, can be seeing in my flair) i don't like the ''kitten'' nickname, but i think the alias is going to be toned down and Infold all more repertoire to the nicknames, like they did with the ''kitten'' one with Sylus, so in my mind that'll be a point less in the dislike list.

[I do really like this high tech approach to the visuals, 🤧.](https://preview.redd.it/2s2ffewsbpfe1.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=21e01a1061c3fb18964648e75b471b8dc1ccb588)



After reading the central story, and seeing he didn't kill any child like someone said (i don't remember the post and honestly i don't want to research from posts from those two days), i want to share this. I think a lot of people who validly doesn't like Caleb, in my opinion; could be for different reasons, and not necessarily because this is their first otome visual novel game (which can happen) but also because they are more emotionally attached to this game than other ones.

One of the reason could rely on the fact that, the vast majority of us has one or two mains but thoroughly enjoyed ***ALL FOUR*** different mains, as someone who download the game on January but only started playing on October, is pretty common seeing people with one flair dedicated to one of the mens, but drool for other ones. So, when a new addition of a love interest is not attractive for them; BREAKS the mold of the constant sense of unity... Like *''what do you mean i can't drool for the 5 ones?''* or others dislike the idea of the fifth love interest because the game has multiple core afflictions in terms of: universal diamond resource, and how some people who are willing to spend on the game, complains of the high price of some packages and makes it unsustainable long term.

[According to this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveAndDeepspace/comments/1i35m8n/comment/m7k9kja/) now with Caleb's addition and no signs of more free pulls (F2P) or better tailored packages (P2P), is going to be between 315 pulls with a maximum of 560 to get all five LI, that makes people reject Caleb from what it implies on a operative level than maybe his personality (and a valid one). Videogame businesses pay their employees regardless how much they make on sales, and because sales fluctuate; they make money without directly selling to the players (meaning F2P players are important), and also; **they'll need all the spectrum of spenders** to keep the income coming [($398 million dollars in revenue of 2024).](https://www.pocketgamer.biz/asian-developers-dominate-as-2024s-top-10-new-mobile-games-surpass-3-billion/) Now, this last part of this paragraph is for another post, to talk with respect about the weak sides of the game as a whole.



[Love me some playful love interests 💗.](https://preview.redd.it/21jmvasubpfe1.jpg?width=640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=839f966981d125de3375ca7dad3c264ebb950084)



I had experience playing another very popular (and quite honestly trendsetter and visionary) otome game called Mystic Messenger, as lots of us did. There was around 7 different love interest in the game from the beginning. And for people experiencing this break of sense of unity because they don't like Caleb but on different levels, all the rest of the four men, they found themselves in a difficult position of how to compartmentalize. And i want to use MM as a point of comparison.

You have to remember something, Love and Deepspace put us in the skin of MC who HAS A SHAPED PERSONALITY, we do not infuse our personality on her, and the story on LaD's is in constant evolution, different from example as Mystic Messenger which story *has a beginning* and *an end.* On Mystic Messenger we have around 7 to 9 **DIFFERENT ENDINGS,** depending of our behaviour, in LaD's WE don't have different endings, meaning that just because we can select three different answers on text messages, social media publications or in this case, on the central storyline; doesn't affect the outcome simply because for now, there's no end.

Our behaviour doesn't make the love interest affinity to get lowered or higher like in Mystic Messenger, or they like us less... We are in the skin of a character which story is shaped on a certain way, and we relived the experiences from her point of view, we ***DO NOT HAVE*** control of the outcome of events. I can understand people getting triggered by Caleb, but also criticizing the actions and saying ''i wouldn't do that'', yeah, because we are not MC, we are playing a character with a story, a personality and an agenda, and we are on the ride with her, ***NOT CHOOSING*** how the ride is going to be ***FOR HER.***

So a simply solution, understanding and accepting MC is not us and we are not choosing the destination of how the story is going to end, but we can choose who with she connects with; and just using Caleb as a tool, knowing he's there as an available option, an option some of us don't like and pretend basically he doesn't exist (which honestly is fairly simple, unselected him from visiting you in the coffee shop as i did), strip down his memory room, do not play kitty cards with him or the claw machine unless we need diamonds, finishing his routes and bond because is part of the inquiry missions for the rewards **WE CAN CHOOSE** who to spend those with. Is not difficult to ignore a love interest in a game we don't like, but i can see why people have an issue with this last part because they are very attached and used to a certain behaviour or liking all love interest (usually) to a certain degree.



*tl;dr: Just see Caleb as a way to get more checks (aka red diamonds) and forget about him, and focus on your main or main(s).*

Hopefully you have some similar interests and if you don’t then maybe you’ll entertain me for a while.

I’m a 24M from Chennai, and I honestly don’t know where to start, but here goes. For a while now, I’ve been feeling stuck in life. The people I studied with, worked with, and even had fun with at one point—most of them don’t feel like they’re my people anymore.

I’ve been working from home for the past 1.5 years, and while it felt great initially (no traffic, no office politics, more time for myself), over time, it’s created this huge void. I barely have any social interaction, and now it feels like I’m just existing, not living. My mental health has taken a hit, I’m out of shape, and even though I’m financially stable, I feel far from satisfied with life. Everything feels flat—nothing excites me anymore.

I even tried stepping out of my comfort zone by attending some tech meetups, but those were barely helpful. Social interaction there was limited to 5-10 minutes during coffee breaks, and honestly, it felt superficial.

So, I thought, why not create my own space instead of depending on others? I know there are people out there who feel exactly like me—those craving genuine friendships and meaningful conversations. I’ve shared this idea in other places and found that so many people feel the same way: isolated, frustrated, and longing for connection.

The problem is, while people are great at opening up anonymously online, in real life, they overthink and hesitate—so many “what ifs” stop them from taking the first step.

A few years back, I struggled to interact with new people. I’d get awkward, fail to hold conversations, and ended up losing even the few connections I had. But I’ve decided not to let that stop me anymore.

I want to reshape my life into something engaging and fulfilling—not the same old routine. I’m committed to building this safe space for people like me who need genuine friends. I know it’ll take time and effort, but I’m ready to stay consistent.

This is **MY** *opinion* and my thought process, and hopefully someone find some solution on what do i do with Caleb on my game, so they enjoy theirs.

So, here we go *de mujers:*

On a game like LaD's i don't like to rush through the story because of the lack of constant updates, i like to take my time with it, however; because i was hyperfocus on obtaining blue tickets to pull for the Pulse Hunter as so many of us, and thanks to the prize tickets from the inquiry event of this New Lunar Years/ Caleb re-introduction event; i did finished the recent story update which was Caleb's branch.

I was apprehensive to go through it because for the first two days this subreddit was a Nightmare Alley type of circus with people either dropping dead of happiness with Caleb (up to the point as being his main wrecker), and other one's wanting to attempt drop an atomic bomb to the servers so he could be delete it.  I read by accident some things like he k!ll a child and i was flabbergasted (he did not do it, btw) and make me apprehensive to read it.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Keeping your kitchen organized can transform meal preparation into a more enjoyable experience. With so many options available for home organization on Amazon, you can easily find solutions that fit your style and needs. Here are effective strategies to help you optimize your kitchen space using Amazon home organization products.

### Assess Your Kitchen Needs

Before diving into the world of Amazon shopping, take a moment to assess your kitchen. Identify areas that feel cluttered or disorganized. Consider the following:

- **What items do you use daily?** Focus on keeping these accessible.
- **What items can you store away?** Less frequently used gadgets can be tucked into cabinets.
- **Do you have a pantry?** Determine the best ways to maximize that space.

### Utilize Vertical Space

One of the most efficient ways to organize your kitchen is by making full use of vertical space. Amazon has a plethora of shelving units and wall-mounted solutions. Consider these:

Claim Here: https://digitalgooglyus.com/amazon-home-organization-kitchen  
  
- **Wall-mounted shelves:** Great for displaying cookbooks or spices.
- **Magnetic strips:** Perfect for holding metal items like knives or utensils.
- **Over-the-door racks:** Use these on pantry doors to keep snacks or cleaning supplies neatly organized.

### Invest in Drawer Organizers

Junk drawers can quickly become a black hole of clutter. On Amazon, you can find various drawer organizers designed to help keep your utensils, tools, and gadgets tidy. Here’s how to get started:

- **Start with a plan:** Measure your drawers and select organizers that fit well.
- **Categorize items:** Group utensils with similar functions together. For example, keep all cutting tools in one section and cooking spoons in another.
- **Use adjustable organizers:** These can expand or shrink based on your needs, which makes them a versatile choice.

how about we played a game?

Imagine this:
You are walking sidewalk when all of the sudden big storm hits you. There is crazy raining, wind makes you almost trip and thunder can be heard. 

You hide in the close by coffeeshop. It's quite crowded, many people decided to pick it as their shelter just like you. You will notice last empty chair. Slowly you walk beside the group of people, hoping that they will not notice that last comfy spot is still available.

You drop on chair with sigh of relief. Trying to fix your hair while finally noticing who is sitting in front of you (E). She is quite busy on her phone with the frowning eyebrows. 
She has tall glass with matcha latte in front of her.

1ibxgkl,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ibxgkl/am_i_the_asshole_for_breaking_up_with_my_best/,Am I the asshole for breaking up with my best friend?,"I’ve never posted on reddit before but this is something that happened a few months ago and it’s been eating at me. 

Some context, my best friend (17f), and I (17f), got in a fight near the beginning of the school year. When I say best friend, I mean best friend. Whenever either of us had a bad day the first thing we would do was tell each other about it. We both knew everything about each other, good or bad. Whenever either of us experienced issues at home we would have sleepovers to cope. We bonded over music, fashion, art, and I fully believed we were ride or dies until the end of time. 

That was until we started fighting. It’s hard to explain since there wasn’t one specific reason, but it all started because I am bad at responding to text messages. This was something we talked about a lot, basically she felt like I didn’t care about her because I wouldn’t answer my phone right away when she would text me. I am a busy person, I’m very involved in our school and I work a part time job. I would tell her constantly that I couldn’t drop everything I was doing to respond to her messages right away, but that didn’t take away from the love I felt for her, and I told her that if she ever urgently needed something she could call me and I would always answer. 

We were in a school club together and when we went to a summer camp for that club things started to feel different. She got elected president of the club and it seemed like it was really going to her head. The whole trip she was avoiding me. During this camp all of our time was scheduled, and it was honestly very stress inducing and we had no time to unwind. We had a few hours of free time one day (the only free time we had the whole trip) and I stopped by the cabin to take a dump 💀. Right after I joined her at the campfire and tried to talk to her but she gave me the silent treatment, and ditched me at the fire by myself. Later that night I found her with a mutual friend and asked her what was wrong, basically she felt that we “weren’t taking advantage of our time at camp” and she was upset because she wanted to go on this big swing at the camp but had no one to go with (I was shitting)and the line was too long to get on anymore. I told her I was sorry but I needed to take a second to shit and pull myself together, especially since the whole event was so overstimulating. She told me it was okay but then continued to ignore me the rest of the trip, and I remember hiding in the bathroom and crying because I loved her and it felt like she didn’t give a rats ass about how I felt. 

After this trip we pretended like everything was fine, but the next week was the homecoming dance when everything went down. My other friend (15f) is also a part of our club and went to camp with us, but she left a day early when she found out her grandma was in the hospital. I remember sitting with her in the cabin bed before her dad picked her up and she was saying how upset she was that she had to leave camp and miss homecoming. On the night of homecoming that friend ended up driving back from the hospital and was able to go after all. Since I have my license I told her I would pick her up and we could go to homecoming together. When I showed up to homecoming I saw my best friend, I said hi and told her she looked pretty(she did), but she said “you didn’t answer my text” and stormed off. I genuinely didn’t know she had texted me, but when I checked my phone I saw she had asked me when I was coming, but the text was sent while I was driving to the dance. I really don’t understand why she was so upset, she did have my location on my phone so she could’ve seen that I was on the way, but the entire night she avoided me. I tried to dance with her twice, I walked up to her and said hi and started to dance and both times she walked away and pretended I wasn’t there. Long story short I ended up having a panic attack in the bathroom for most of the night because of this, and I remember running into her after I left the bathroom, she saw I was crying but instead of saying something to me she sent me a text saying she was “sorry for upsetting me” or something along those lines. Basically I responded saying I needed to talk to her, but after the dance I sent her a voice message where I definitely took everything too far. I was bawling my eyes out and I listed all of the ways she had hurt me since we became friends, which I could get into but this post is already long enough so I won’t unless someone asks. I was a hot mess and I felt betrayed by the one person I trusted more than anyone. We fought back and forth for awhile until we agreed to stop being friends for awhile, but it ended with both of us apologizing and saying how much we loved each other. 

After this happened I believed that if we stopped talking for awhile we would reconnect and it would be like it was before, but she instantly unfollowed me on everything and I fully thought she hated the fact that I existed. I would see her around school and I would have to hold back tears every time I saw her face. We are still in the same club and I remember talking to our club advisor about everything that happened, since she had heard my ex best friends side of the story but not mine. Our club advisor decided that she wanted to sit us down so we could work out our issues so we could peacefully be in the club together. We had a club meeting a few days later and our advisor told me we were going to talk afterwards, I was so scared of confronting my ex best friend that it was all I could think about the entire meeting, and I had another panic attack (I do have anxiety but panic attacks weren’t a common thing for me before this whole fight). The meeting ended and my ex best friend left. I talked to my advisor, asking why my ex best friend left when we were supposed to talk. Apparently my ex best friend had texted the advisor saying she wasn’t ready to talk to me yet but the advisor had failed to tell me, so I had a huge panic attack during our meeting over something that wasn’t even happening anymore. 

A few days later I was at work when my ex best friend sent me a super long text message saying she hoped I was okay and that she was sorry for the pain she caused me, and she said “it will take some time and work” but that she wants to be able to work together again. Ever since then we had a few awkward exchanges at club meetings but never really talked to each other.  It has been three months since she sent me that text and we’ve been able to spend time together at club outings, it’s just incredibly awkward. 

I know this is an AITA post and feel free to let me know if I am an asshole but I honestly feel like the situation is much more complicated than either of us just being an asshole. My emotions around her are so torn, I miss her and still care for her so much but at the same time I hate her for how she treated me. Should I try and get coffee with her and find common ground, should I text her, or should we just continue the awkward small talk until we both leave for college in 6 months and pretend like we never knew each other? Please let me know what to do, a part of me really does want to sit down and talk to her but I’m not sure how to initiate it and the whole idea is so scary that it makes me want to just stick with the awkwardness.",2,1738054774.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Here's a breakdown of the best [**Bialetti Moka Pots**](https://latteholic.com/collections/buy-bialetti-moka-pot-online-in-india) for one cup:

# 1. Bialetti Moka Express 3 Cup



Why it's great for one: The Bialetti Moka Express functions technically as a 3-cup system but remains a well-known option for single coffee drinkers. One Moka pot by Bialetti contains enough caffeine for your personal cup while still leaving a bit extra for additional servings or sharing.

Pros: The small aluminum body featuring a unique design combines compact size with user-friendly operation.

Cons: This model takes up a touch more space than an absolute minimalistic countertop would allow.

# 2. Bialetti Moka Express 1 Cup



Why it's great for one: For solo caffeine consumption choose this compact compact Bialetti unit.

Pros: Compact and space-saving. Ideal for travel or limited kitchen space.

Cons: Due to its compact size the unit might not function effectively for those who drink plentifully without requiring refills.



# Important Considerations



""Cups"" vs. Actual Volume: Bialetti labels their espresso cups ""cups"" even though they differ in size from American coffee mugs. Moka Pot production yields 150ml of coffee product from each pot filled to the 3-cup level.   

**1.Bialetti Moka Express**



Coffee Grind: When preparing coffee with Moka Pots utilize specially formulated Moka-Pot appropriate coffee grounds.

Water Level: You need to fill the water chamber until the valve turns into view. Overfilling can cause messy eruptions.

Heat Source: Rising heat to high levels will blacken your coffee so choose medium heat instead. Medium-low heat is usually sufficient.

**Beyond Bialetti**



While Bialetti is the most recognized brand, other companies offer excellent single-serve Moka Pots:



Silit Silit Sizz: The cool appearance of this product combines with its lasting stainless steel material.

Groovelife Moka Pot: Offers a modern take on the classic design with various color options.

The [**Bialetti Moka Pot**](https://latteholic.com/collections/buy-bialetti-moka-pot-online-in-india) designed for one cup will match your specific needs best but this selection also depends on personal style choices. Your decision needs to take daily coffee quantities together with counter space availability and your preferred design style.",2,1738054680.0,mokapot,0,1.0,False
1ibxfsa,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeSpeech/comments/1ibxfsa/journalist_released_from_swiss_detention_his/,Journalist Released from Swiss Detention - His Personal Statement,"I’m free! I wrote this on the plane and I’m posting it just after landing at Istanbul. On Monday evening I was brought to Zurich airport in handcuffs, in a small metal cage inside a windowless prison van and led all the way to the plane by police. This is after three days and two nights in a Swiss prison cut off from communication with the outside world, in a cell 24 hours a day with one cell mate, not even permitted to contact my family. On Saturday in a police interview in the presence of my lawyer they accused me of “offending against Swiss law” without ever telling me what crime I had committed in Switzerland or listing any charges. As far as I know I have not been charged with any crime whatsoever and I was held in “administrative detention.”

On Sunday morning, they took me from my cell for questioning by Swiss defense ministry intelligence agents without the presence of my lawyer, and they again refused to allow me to contact her or my family. I refused to talk to them without my lawyer and told them take me back to my cell. During my imprisonment I refused every meal and every cup of coffee or tea they offered me except the last meal, after I knew I would be going home. I accepted only water, which is the right of every human being. All of this was after I was abducted off the street around 1:30pm on Saturday while on my way to the Palestine teach-in by undercover agents, handcuffed, forced into an unmarked car and sped straight to the prison. My “crime”? Being a journalist who speaks up for Palestine and against Israel’s genocide and settler-colonial savagery and those who aid and abet it.

I came to Switzerland at the invitation of Swiss citizens to talk about justice for Palestine, to talk about accountability for a genocide in which Switzerland too is complicit. But while I was hauled off to prison like a dangerous criminal before I even had a chance to say a word, the Israeli president Isaac Herzog, who declared at the start of the genocide that there are no civilians in Gaza, no innocents, received a red carpet welcome in Davos, a carpet soaked in the blood of the more than 47,000 known victims of the genocide and the thousands more still under the rubble, or who died of deliberately inflicted starvation and denial of medical care. And on this very day Netanyahu freely travels to Poland to make a mockery of the Auschwitz commemoration despite an outstanding ICC arrest warrant. That is the perverse, unjust world we live in.

This ordeal lasted three days but that taste of prison was more than enough to leave me in even greater awe of the Palestinian heroes who endure months and years in the prisons of the genocidal oppressor. More than ever I know that the debt we owe them is one we can never repay and all of them must be free and they must remain our focus. The police gave me my phone back only at the gate of the plane so I’m only seeing now the extent of the overwhelming support and solidarity from all over the world. I’m deeply grateful to each and every person who stood up for me. I’m especially grateful to my lawyer Dina Raewel and her team, to our friends in Zurich who I learned afterwards demonstrated outside the prison, to my family and my colleagues at EI and so many others. I honestly had no idea what was happening outside that concrete room! Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

1ibxfnm,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeightLossAdvice/comments/1ibxfnm/weight_loss_help_for_a_short_woman_with_adhd/,Weight loss help for a short woman with adhd?,"This is a bit long so bear with me plz. 25 F. I am very short at 4”11 and weigh about 180 lbs. I barely eat but I guess what I eat isn’t the greatest.

 I have tried so hard to eat healthy but I work from home and live with my elderly parents who constantly need me. I work 9 am-5/6/7pm depending on the day and during the day my dad will sometimes need me for something. 

When I get off I either go with my dad or myself to get groceries or food and we either cook or eat dinner. By that point if we had to buy groceries, it is like 10pm when we finish eating. I actually don’t eat a lot of fast food I just don’t eat a lot of protein and I guess a lot of my calories are coming from drinks. I love coke (the drink). If i’m dying for it I will have half of those tiny bottles and save the other half for another day. I try to have poppi and other options. I also like my coffee with sugar but try not to have too much (about a tbs max of sugar goes in and no flavor creamer. or if I have creamer no sugar just splash of creamer with milk). Also note I am sorry but I hate any alternative sweetener. I can handle poppi, half cane sugar half artificial sweetener sodas, and fairlife because they aren’t too artificial tasting but everything else is foul. 

I eat once or twice a day. For lunch I usually have chicken salad and crackers or a tiny bit of leftovers from the night before, or cheese and crackers. sometimes I have chips with cottage cheese to get some protein in. 

I have tried protein drinks and I don’t love them but sometimes have fairlife with my coffee or a chobani drinkable protein yogurt thing. If I don’t eat, I have coffee or something and even then sometimes I don’t even have that. 


Dinner is where I get most of my calories. I like tacos, burgers, pasta, chicken kabobs, steak, chicken tenders. I just like to eat easy stuff because I feel like I don’t have time ever. I try to eat less bread that I would want, eating vegetables to fill up volume, and making healthier choices to lessen the calorie count a bit like low cal tortillas, only eating serving amount of pasta, fat free cheese on my burgers. salad and oven baked potato wedges with my chicken kabobs. I rarely eat rice. 

I don’t like fish at all or pork that much. I like bacon (turkey and pork) and pepperoni but that’s about it. I don’t really like ground turkey either so I opt to get very lean beef instead since ground chicken doesn’t tend to taste like beef in pasta or something. I do like cultural foods since i’m a poc I like indian food, italian food, persian food, mexican food, chinese food and korean food the most if that helps. I hate how picky I am but that’s how I am. I try to like things and I am always willing to try something but I just end up not liking it. It also sucks because that’s also one reason why I can’t meal prep. I don’t like eating the same thing more than once or twice a week. I wish I could meal prep ingredients kinda like chefs do but I don’t have the fridge space. My parents are foreign and keep all kinds of food in the fridge and freezer that they do eat it’s not clutter there just isn’t much space for me, I get like a little corner of the fridge and freezer. I know when I have enough money to move it will be easier but ugh it’s so hard right now. 

I rarely have dessert but if I do it’s a couple bites of a cake (if there’s some from an occasion or something). a chocolate chip cookie or very very rarely, a small cinnamon roll. Again these are if we have these and I try not to buy them so it’s not often. 

 Went to the endo and they tested me and still don’t know what’s wrong with me cause it’s not pcos or hypothyroidism or diabetes. she even put my on a 1200 calorie deficit and had me log the food and I did it and some days I ate even less than 1200 in the day and I didn’t lose a single pound the entire 2 weeks. 

Is it just because I am sedentary? I never knew how to work out tbh and I have always been lazy due to my adhd or just busy. I have a lot of responsibilities so I don’t know how people work and find time to workout as well because another issue for me is falling asleep late. so I can’t wake up earlier than 8 am. I even got prescribed trazadone but I forget to take it half the time or take it too late. :/

I tried working out and I was so good. I went everyday for over 30 minutes for 4 weeks. Didn’t lose a single pound yet again (and yes I was doing full body and doing proper workouts as per the gym trainer people) but I enjoyed it for a bit. had to quit because I got ringworm from the gym despite being a germaphobe and always sanitizing EVERYTHING before and after including the equipment, my phone, hands and airpods. I got kinda traumatized and quit. Tried walking but I don’t feel safe being alone and my sister started working till 7 pm every day so I can’t go with her anymore. Plus I have really bad knee, shin and foot pain so I can’t walk too fast for too long or do stairmaster or knee heavy type workouts. I have had this pain since before I was “fat” being fat has just made it worse so it sucks. Also note before you say it, there are no water aerobics classes near me. I checked :( 

I have gone to numerous doctors and they still can’t tell what’s wrong with me. Each doctor refers me to another. I have never lost weight in my life. It’s just slowly been adding on and the bulk of it happened in college due to being depressed since I didn’t know I had adhd + covid + being poor + being on birth control. I only gain about 2 pounds a year now since then so it’s not rapid but nothing brings it down. The only thing that did was weight medication (it won’t let me say it and post this). and I had to stop it due to digestive problems. Got a colonoscopy scheduled soon and if I am cleared I can get back on it but I don’t want to. 

Please can anyone help me? What do I do? I feel like I am at my wits end. I just want to feel pretty again. I am treated like I am invisible these days and my boyfriend is so sweet to me but I can tell he notices my weight gain but doesn’t say anything. He always says i’m beautiful but I want to feel hot. I just want to feel irresistible again and while I don’t think all thicker women are ugly I just know I am not supposed to look like this. I feel like I don’t even know who I am anymore. Am I just making up excuses and should just hit the gym more? Or is there something else I can do? Also would love recommendations to dietitians that have experience with adhd that take insurance and do remote sessions/plans!! 

TLDR: I have tried everything. I have tried eating under 1200 calories and it doesn’t seem to work. I have adhd and am very picky plus don’t have time or fridge space to meal prep. Maybe I need to do it for longer. I tried working out or walking but I have joint pain. Willing to start working out again but need more guidance.

All the examples of the times I should have known better: FEEL FREE TO SKIP AHEAD 
This “friend” has done numerous things such as taking pictures of me, laughing at them, and continuing to do so despite me requesting that she stopped. It took several tries before she finally apologized for making me uncomfortable, she later started crying which I now feel was manipulative. She would always ask me to edit her school work, literally every day (we are student teachers for context) and would take time out of my own planning to help her. One time, in my favourite class (she wouldn’t know because she never really listened to me) she made us switch laptops so I could edit her work. It got to the point where I was doing it most days even when I didn’t want to, I just didn’t know how to say no. She would make petty comments if I hung out with friends from my cohort or even simply sat somewhere else…she would continue to make such comments. One time, over text when I was with my cohort friends, I asked where she was. She replied that she would tell me “only on one condition.” Which was odd, she ended up telling me. Along with taking pictures she even made a comment about loyalty testing friends partners, saying “I would never do that to you” implying that my bf would probably leave me for her? She was also surprised I had a bf before my current one, which I found offensive. On top of this she would ask me to make her coffees and then get petty if I did not (I did when I went to her house). I one time went to shoppers asked her if she wanted anything and she didn’t reply in time and I would be late to class waiting and she was petty about that too. Whenever I talked about my problems it seemed like she was never listening and after talking to my best friend about this, she made me realize that body language, lack of eye contact, and multitasking are all indicators of listening. This friend often did not care about actually helping me. This is just a bit of background. 

Our friend ship ended: CURRENT SITUATION 
We were put into a group project, four of us where two of the members are sisters. The two sisters reached out to us over email on Thursday or Friday and sent over a google slides/ doc so we could collaborate. The two sisters were ahead and took care of part 1 and asked us to contribute for part 2. Me and this friend communicated over text and she said she would get to it on Sunday and I said I was going to work on it Saturday. She minimized the activity in text (indigenous focused) and said we should just take the group out to mediate … her dad is getting surgery so I assumed she wasn’t giving it much thought. Anyways. I crafted an activity that was well thought out and emailed EVERYONE including this friend Saturday night, I asked for feedback and input from EVERYONE. She never replied to the thread while the others did. This friend messaged me today, Monday 8pm, a day before the presentation asking if the other members had discussed anything. I told her “I emailed the one I made and you didn’t really contribute at all but you can lead the discussion after I explain it” … offering her a part. She blew up on me saying I didn’t include her and that I was rude for not contacting her directly (which is untrue. I messaged on sat saying I was working on it and she didn’t respond). She said we should have worked on this portion together because the other girls were doing the activity. I just had time on sat night and still believe the group should have input on the activity as it is the most important part. I also offered her a part in the presentation but she lost it after I said I already emailed and contacted? 

She started freaking out and telling me not to contact her, calling me fake, and made a remark about my self esteem. I stood up for myself for once and am glad the friendship was over. But i am a people pleaser and offer people more compassion than they deserve at times. I feel she was highly irrational, erratic, disrespectful our whole friendship, selfish, and just a bad friend. She is an adult (27) and I am 23…but she acts like a child. She didn’t have an idea for the project and that’s fine but she could have at least replied to the email chain, and added her thoughts or maybe crafts a discussion question or requested the other member to assign her part? REGARDLESS, she could have just accepted the part I assigned, but she started raging about joining a new group. 

Look friend or not, be accountable for your own education and communicate with your group, why should I have to hold her hand? The second I said one honest thing she freaked out, and now she’s going to bad mouth me to everyone in her cohort… the same things she did to another friend who “had to apologize to her” to be back in the group… 

I’m done, when you realize you’re happy you don’t have to spend the day with someone or worry about your other social connections, or sacrifice ur time/resources for someone who literally only takes and never gives… man why? 

And just for a chuckle, the only nice thing she did for me in our 3-4 month friendship was give me frother for lattes which she demanded to receive back…? Like are you kidding me? 

I needed to vent and I’d really like to discuss with others who run into toxic friends to often… how do we improve our boundaries and make better friends? ",1,1738054530.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

Coming home tonight at nearly midnight, I take my usual turn off the highway and towards my little village. There aren't any overhead lights on the turn off so when I saw something in my headlights, I swerved quickly and just avoided hitting a dead deer laying across the turn off. I'm in a fairly low car so it definitely would have done some damage. 

It's cold here tonight, around -13C, and my car was warm enough that I really didn't want to go out there. But I know it would take some time to call for a city worker to move the deer and it was in a really unfortunate location for those turning off. So I put on my big girl panties, my reflective vest and grabbed my little flashlight and set off. With some work, I dragged it off the road and a distance into the ditch so any scavengers won't get hit.

He went into my sister’s room and now she’s gone. (Part 3),"I’m writing this as we prepare to leave Father Moretti’s house. A lot has happened—horrible, *horrible* things—and I’m the one to blame. What was I even thinking? How will I ever forgive myself? It hurts just to put pen to paper, but I can’t allow a single detail to fade from memory.

We fled our home six days ago. We searched for Father Moretti’s house all night, and by the time we found it, it was nearly dawn. Dad kept glancing nervously in the rearview mirror the whole drive, and Mom was half-conscious from fear and exhaustion in the back seat. My heart pounded with every twist in the road, terrified that *thing* might appear in front of our headlights at any moment. But by some miracle, it never did.

Father Moretti’s house is tucked behind a row of barren trees—a small stone building with stained-glass windows that catch the early light in rainbow shards. The walls are streaked with moss, and the yard is overgrown, but it still feels like a church somehow, like a piece of holy ground hidden and forgotten.

When Father Moretti opened his door, I almost didn’t recognize him. I remembered him from when I was little, but he looked much older now—probably in his eighties. His hair was a fine dusting of white, and his hands shook slightly. Still, there was an energy in his eyes that made him seem stronger than he appeared.

He studied us like we were ghosts from his past. When Dad introduced himself, Father Moretti muttered, “Martin Hill… David’s boy,” and his gaze softened with recognition before he let us in.

Inside, it felt part-home, part-chapel. The walls were lined with worn shelves crammed full of religious texts, prayer books, and ancient scrolls, but there was also a sofa with faded cushions, a well-used kitchen table, and a kettle perched on an old stove. Candles and crucifixes hung everywhere, like he wasn’t sure if the place was meant for living or worship.

We settled around a scarred wooden table. Father Moretti eyed us warily. When Dad told him why we were there—how we’d seen Rufus change into that *thing*, how it came for me, and how Amelia was gone—Father Moretti let out a low, humorless chuckle.

“I waited my whole life for this town to need faith,” he said bitterly. “And now you come to me with such a bizarre story… when I’ve no strength left to offer?”

He motioned toward the door. “You should leave.” My chest tightened as Mom began shaking her head, pleading through broken whispers. Dad’s voice cracked as he begged for help, desperation in every syllable. Father Moretti stared at us a long time, his expression unreadable, then sighed.

“All right,” he said at last, more gently. “I’ll let you stay. No one has ever come to me seeking God until this day. Now that someone has finally come, it would be the greatest of sins to turn them away, even if I have lost much of myself in the wait.”

I practically collapsed with relief.

He brewed tea and prepared a simple meal. None of us had much appetite, but he insisted that we eat. He asked us to explain everything again in more detail, scribbling notes and muttering words I couldn’t make out. I caught fragments—mentions of protection, evil, his family’s responsibility. He didn’t seem to fully understand everything he was saying, but it was clear he knew more than he let on.

When we finished eating, he asked us to rest. He moved his own belongings upstairs so we could all stay together in the larger room downstairs. He promised we were safe in his home.

Later, as we settled into the room Father Moretti had given us, Dad told Mom and me to rest while he went to talk to him. Mom had developed a slight fever. She lay down on the creaky bed, muffling her sobs in a pillow. I sat next to her, holding her for a moment. I wanted to stay and comfort her, but my curiosity got the better of me—I needed to know what Dad and Father Moretti were discussing. So I slipped out.

I found Dad just outside Father Moretti’s study. He gestured silently for me to come closer. Inside, Father Moretti was completely absorbed in his books and scrolls, muttering to himself. I could only make out one phrase: “I have to remember… I have to remember…”

Dad motioned for me to leave him be for now, so we went back to our room and tried to collect ourselves.

It must have been hours before Father Moretti finally emerged and went down to his basement. He returned with a large bag of charcoal. Without a word, he stepped outside and began placing small crucible pots around the house’s perimeter. He filled each with charcoal, lit them, and soon a thin ring of smoke rose around the entire property. The smell drifted inside—not sharp or stinging, but warm, earthy, and almost comforting.

When he came back in, Dad asked about it.  
“It’s to keep evil away,” Father Moretti replied. “I don’t remember how I got it or how it works, if it even does. But don’t worry, it won’t harm your breathing.”

That night, over dinner, Dad thanked him for letting us stay and for poring over his books all day trying to find something useful.

“But Father,” Dad continued, voice trembling, “I don’t understand. How can a dog—the one I’ve had for a decade—become… that? And I need my daughter back. It took Amelia. The whole town searched for her, and we found nothing, not a single clue. I don’t know what to do anymore. I—” He broke off, gripping the table, eyes wet with tears.

Father Moretti set down his fork and rubbed his temple. For a long moment, he didn’t speak, and silence filled the room. Finally, he sighed and leaned back in his chair.

“I’ll be blunt, Martin,” he said, sounding both steady and frustrated. “I’m old, and my memory’s weak. I can’t even make a decent cup of coffee without that dusty old recipe book.”

His gaze drifted toward the window, like he was searching beyond it. “My family has preached faith in Millbrook for over a century, but we didn’t just spread sermons—some Morettis dealt with the supernatural. Some even left Millbrook to learn from secret organizations about… something.” He paused, frowning as he tried to recall. “I can’t remember. It’s all so faint.”

He sighed again, heavier this time, and looked back at us. “They wrote books, journals, left behind knowledge so others could follow. I’ve spent the day reading them, trying to piece together anything that might help. I found two things: the sacred smoke boundary and—” He stopped abruptly, his brow furrowing. His expression turned guarded, and for a moment, he seemed to wrestle with himself. “Well, I suppose there are things I’m not allowed to reveal. Secrets that must stay within the Moretti family.”

Dad leaned forward, jaw tight. “Father, if it can help us—help my daughter—why keep it hidden?”

Father Moretti’s eyes softened, but his voice stayed firm. “Because some knowledge isn’t meant to be shared lightly. I need to see the evil with my own eyes before I can do more.”

Dad was silent for a moment, then said, “Then come with me, Father. Come to my house. I’ll show you the footprints I saw. The water might’ve dried up, but something must be there—an imprint.”

Father Moretti shook his head. “A faint footprint isn’t enough.”

Dad’s chair scraped as he stood abruptly. “Then what do you want me to do, Father? How do I bring you proof?” he asked, desperation leaking into his voice.

Father Moretti didn’t flinch. He folded his hands on the table. “Calm down, Martin. I want to help you—I do. But finding proof is never easy. I know your daughter is out there and she needs you, but if you rush into things, you might end up regretting it.” With that, he left for his study, not even finishing his meal.

That night, Mom tried to soothe Dad, insisting Father Moretti was only being cautious. Dad rested his head on her shoulder, saying, “I know, Sarah. But I… I can’t stand doing nothing while Amelia—”  
Mom started to cry, placing a hand on his head. “Our girls are brave. Amelia will be okay.”  
After a long pause, Dad murmured, “I’ll find a way, Sarah, if it’s the last thing I do.” Then he closed his eyes.

*I know you will, Dad. You always find a way*, I remember thinking as I peered out through a slightly open curtain. The smoke rose thickly from the pots. Beyond it, I felt a presence—like eyes on me. I tried to tell myself I was just being paranoid, but deep down, I knew I wasn’t.

In the days that followed, an unsettling routine took shape. Father Moretti kept burning charcoal. The smell seeped into our clothes and hair until it became a permanent reminder of why we were there. Mom and Dad tried to act normal, but it was obvious they could think only of Amelia. Dad spent hours coming up with ways to prove our story, but he also helped Father Moretti with chores from time to time. Mom looked hollow, with dark circles under her eyes. She kept trying to distract herself by assisting in the kitchen or tidying the cluttered bookshelves, though her face betrayed her exhaustion.

I think it was the night of the fourth day when I heard Dad shouting. He was with Father Moretti in his study. I ran to him immediately.

“If you want proof so bad, I’ll *get* it for you!” Dad yelled, striding toward the front door. “I’ll walk out there right now, track down that bastard, and drag it here—or let it tear me to shreds so you’ll have your precious *proof*!”

Father Moretti just flipped through his books, not reacting. Mom grabbed Dad’s arm. “Martin, have you lost your mind? It’s too dangerous!”

Dad looked right at her, his voice trembling. “I can’t wait any longer, Sarah! Amelia’s out there, alone, and God knows what that *thing* is doing to her!”

“Martin, please,” Mom’s voice shook. “It could kill you.”

Dad hesitated, obviously torn. He looked at me, then back at Mom, and sighed. “I don’t know what else to do,” he whispered, tears in his eyes. “We’re running out of time.”

Silence hung heavy in the room, broken only by the crackling fire and the rustle of Father Moretti’s pages.

Then, almost without thinking, I spoke. “There’s another way.”

Both Mom and Dad turned to me, their expressions a mix of confusion and hope. Even Father Moretti paused, glancing over his shoulder.

“What do you mean?” Dad asked, his voice cautious.

I hesitated, my heart pounding. “It’s just… I think it’s still out there. Watching us.”

Mom frowned. “Clara, what are you talking about?”

“Sometimes, at night,” I began, my voice barely above a whisper, “I hear things. Rustling in the trees. Movement just outside the boundary of the smoke. I always told myself it was nothing, that it was just my imagination. But what if it’s not? What if it’s still waiting for us to let our guard down?”

Father Moretti turned fully, studying me. “Go on,” he said quietly.

I took a deep breath, trying to steady my nerves. “I think we can lure it out,” I said. “Make it think we’re vulnerable. If we can get it to come close enough, maybe we can catch it—or at least get the proof you need.”

Mom shook her head, panic flashing in her eyes. “No. Absolutely not. That’s too dangerous.”

“It’s *already* dangerous,” I argued, my voice stronger now. “If we don’t do something, we’ll never find Amelia. We’ll never stop this thing.”

Dad looked at me, his expression unreadable. “And how do you suggest we do that?” he asked.

I swallowed. “We let the smoke die down,” I said. “Make it look like we’re getting careless. We act normal—like we’re not scared anymore. And then…” I hesitated, the weight of what I was suggesting pressing down on me. “And then we wait.”

Father Moretti’s eyes flickered with something—concern, maybe, or recognition. He stepped forward, his hands clasped tightly in front of him. “And if it comes?” he asked. “What will you do then?”

I swallowed. “We run to the basement. We’ll keep the charcoal burning there. It’ll be safe.”

Dad frowned. “And if it doesn’t work?”

“It *will*,” I said, trying to sound confident. “It has to.”

No one spoke for a moment. Then Father Moretti said quietly, “I may have something to help. Wait here.”

He turned and disappeared down the hall, leaving the three of us to exchange uneasy glances. My heart was racing, but I forced myself to stay calm. This had to work. It was the only plan we had.

A few minutes later, Father Moretti returned, carrying a polished metal case. He opened it carefully, revealing a set of six glass spheres, each filled with a dense, swirling smoke.

“These,” he said, “are concentrated smoke bombs. If the books are right, they’ll release enough smoke to weaken or stun the creature. I hope we don’t have to use them, but if we do, there are only six.”

I nodded, feeling a flicker of hope. The plan was risky, but now, at least, we had a chance.

For a few days, we kept reducing the charcoal in the pots. We went outside during daylight as if unafraid. Each night, I’d walk to the kitchen around midnight, staying visible, acting casual. My nerves were strung tight, but I forced myself to appear calm. I often sensed eyes upon me—could almost hear low growls carried on the wind—but I never saw anything.

Until last night.

It was the chosen night. Father Moretti let the pots burn out completely. The house felt suddenly exposed without that protective haze. He said he’d feign sleep upstairs. Mom moved to the basement, where we had the charcoal burning. Dad hid in the study, glass bombs at the ready, and I waited for midnight before going to the kitchen all alone.

The plan was to wait for the creature to enter the house, incapacitate it with a glass bomb before it reached me, and then immediately run to the safety of the basement. For a moment, it felt like I could do it—but then, in the very next moment, it felt like I was way out of my depth.

The moon broke through the clouds, casting silver light across the floor. I waited, heart hammering, clinging to one of the delicate glass bombs. My free hand shook uncontrollably. I kept telling myself, _You can do this, Clara._

That's when I saw it. Not the creature, but *someone*, a woman, lying flat on her back in one dark corner of the kitchen.

I didn’t throw the glass bomb right away because it looked like Mom at first. *Maybe she’s been sleepwalking?* I remember thinking.

“Mom?” I whispered, stepping closer.

But it wasn’t Mom. The body was practically a skeleton, like it hadn’t been fed for months. I remember how badly my body started shaking when I recognized Amelia's face. I rushed over, cradling her in my arms, but her eyes were lifeless. She was dead. Her skin was pale and cold, her body reduced to bones under peeling skin. She barely resembled my sister anymore. Tears streamed down my face as I tried to scream her name. But then, I felt hot breath on my neck.

“She was delicious,” it whispered. I knew that voice. I felt a surge of hopeless terror within me. I couldn’t move; I just stared at Amelia’s corpse—her body was whole.

“I didn’t *eat* her, little Clara,” it said. “I only made pups with her.”

I wanted to reach for the bomb, but I was paralyzed. Tears kept rolling down my cheeks as it laughed—a sick, sniggering laugh that made my stomach churn.

“And she was delicious,” it repeated softly.

“No…” I managed, voice barely a breath.

“You, little Clara,” it rasped, its breath foul against my skin, “you’re stronger than her, smarter than her. You’ll do much better.”

Its hand—a grotesque, twisted thing of fur and flesh—landed on my shoulder. I was paralyzed with fear, unable to breathe, unable to think.

Suddenly, there was a loud *bang*. Smoke engulfed the kitchen, and the creature screeched in pain.

“CLARA, CHILD, RUN TO ME!” Father Moretti’s voice echoed. I didn’t think—I just sprinted. I tore through the smoke, past the creature, and into the hall. Father Moretti and Dad stood ready with more glass bombs in hand.

“To the basement!” Father Moretti shouted.

I fled, my heart pounding so hard I thought it’d burst. The basement door was only a few steps away. _It’s going to be okay_, I told myself. But then I heard the creature again.

“You’ve forgotten too much, priest,” it snarled, panting. “The smoke… *annoys* me. But… *kill* me, it cannot.”

It lumbered out of the smoke, silhouetted by the moonlight. For the first time, I saw it fully—and immediately wished I hadn’t. It was almost twice as tall as Dad. Its horns were huge, curving like a crescent moon, each one over two feet long. Its eyes glowed a fierce red, and its twisted face looked almost like Rufus but warped and disgusting. Where a muzzle should have been, there was a human mouth lined with jagged, yellow teeth. A thick beard clung to its cheeks, but its chin was bare. Its body was monstrous—bulky muscles, patches of matted fur, and limbs that were too long, ending in sharp claws reflecting the moonlight.

I stood there, horrified. Father Moretti threw another smoke bomb, but the creature swatted it aside, baring its teeth in a grin.

“I will have her tonight!” it roared, then lunged for me with impossible speed.

I couldn’t move, but Dad grabbed me and yanked me toward the basement door. “Run, Clara!” he shouted.  
We almost made it, but the creature was faster. Its claws tore through the air, slashing Dad’s back. He screamed, collapsing to his knees, blood soaking his shirt.

“Dad!” I screamed, voice cracking.

The creature stood over us, ready to strike again. Suddenly, another smoke bomb exploded at its feet, forcing it to stagger back. Its roar rattled the walls.

“GO!” Father Moretti bellowed.

I hauled Dad to his feet, his blood hot against my hands. We stumbled into the basement. Mom was there, holding the door open, her face white with fear.

The creature roared in rage, slamming against the walls, but it couldn’t enter through the charcoal smoke. We huddled together, shaking uncontrollably. Mom tried to stop Dad’s bleeding with a torn cloth, and he winced, saying nothing. I clung to both of them, sobbing as the reality of it all—Amelia’s death, my own guilt, the creature itself—came crashing down on me.

That long, dreadful night in the basement felt like it would never end. I tried to keep my eyes shut, but I couldn’t stop picturing Amelia’s face, her sunken cheeks, her lifeless body. Every time I looked at Mom or Dad, a fresh wave of guilt broke over me. They needed to know—*had to know*—but I couldn’t bring myself to speak the words.

The creature’s pounding on the walls eventually stopped, and silence followed. I thought, just for a second, that maybe it had given up. But then I heard Father Moretti scream.

“NO!” I cried, jumping up. I tried running to him, but Mom grabbed me.

“We can’t help him, Clara!” she sobbed. “We can’t leave this smoke!”

Dad tried to stand, but his injuries were too bad. He fell back against the wall, cursing under his breath. Father Moretti’s screams were awful—raw, tearing, like nothing I’d ever heard. I covered my ears, crying, while Mom held me, tears streaming down her face. Dad slammed his fist on the floor in frustration. Then, as suddenly as they started, the screams went silent.

The hours between that moment and dawn stretched on, full of my parents’ muffled sobs and my own silent tears. I kept replaying the last glimpse I had of Amelia, her sightless eyes, how fragile her body felt in my arms. *They’ll see it soon*, I thought again, dread coiling in my stomach. *They’ll know.*

Morning light crept into the basement, and we finally dared to come out. The house was dead quiet, still heavy with the smell of smoke. We found Father Moretti in the hall, lying in a pool of his own blood. His body was covered in deep wounds, his cassock shredded. He had fought with all his strength, but he was just a man against a nightmare. I collapsed to my knees, tears burning hot down my cheeks as I laid my head on his lifeless chest.

In his own blood, he’d scrawled three final words on the floor:  
**Church basement monolith**

The letters were jagged and uneven, written with what little strength he must have had left.

Mom knelt beside me, her eyes darting between the bloody message and Father Moretti’s lifeless body. “Do you think it’s something he wanted us to find?” she asked, holding back her sobs.

“I don’t know, Mom. I—I don’t know anything,” I said as I cried.

“It’s okay, honey. We’ll think about it later. Let’s first give the man a proper burial,” she said, placing her hand on my head.

She didn’t know that it wasn’t just Father Moretti’s death that was making me cry. It was also the horror of knowing that Amelia’s dead body was lying just a few feet away in the kitchen.

After a few moments, I told Mom and Dad that I needed a glass of water and went to the kitchen. I wanted to look at her once before telling them. But when I walked in, the corner was empty. Her body was gone, as if I had dreamed the entire thing. My knees went weak, and I had to steady myself against the counter.

Did the creature take her, dragging her away for whatever cruel purpose it had? …Or—was it just a trick of my mind to begin with? A hallucination conjured by my fear, or even some illusion the monster created to torment me. If that’s true, maybe Amelia is still alive somewhere. I know I sound desperate, but I cannot abandon hope, no matter how insignificant it is.

“Clara?” Mom stood in the doorway, her face gaunt. “What’s wrong?”

*Tell them.* The words lodged in my throat. If Amelia was alive, kindling that hope could destroy them. If she wasn’t… I couldn’t be the one to extinguish it.

“Nothing,” I whispered. “Just… checking something.”

We buried Father Moretti in his yard, in a patch of earth where morning sunlight fell through the leafless branches. Dad’s hands shook as he dug, the shovel biting into frozen earth. Each thrust jarred his wounds, but he refused to stop. Mom knelt beside the grave, her lips moving soundlessly—a prayer without words. When we lowered him into the ground, she pressed his rosary into his palm.

Dad stood rigid, staring at the cross we’d lashed together from splintered chair legs. “He deserved better,” he said, more to himself than us. A tear traced the dirt on his cheek.

I said nothing. The guilt was a stone in my gut, but beneath it simmered something colder: resolve. *Church basement monolith.* The words gnawed at me. Hadn’t Father Moretti talked about “family secrets” over dinner that night? He hinted that there was something even more effective than charcoal smoke.

As we turned back to the house, I paused. My mind went to Millbrook’s abandoned church, the original church built by the Moretti family. Moss crawled up its walls now, and the cross atop it was rusted and crooked.

But that’s where we’ll find the monolith.

Mom touched my shoulder. “Come inside, Clara. You’re shivering.”

I let her guide me, but my mind stayed fixed on the Moretti church. Whatever waited in that basement—holy or hellish—we’d face it. For Amelia. For Father Moretti.

And if the creature followed?

Let it come.

1ibx78h,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConstructionManagers/comments/1ibx78h/i_somehow_found_myself_a_pm_and_i_think_im_in_way/,"I somehow found myself a ""PM"" and I think I'm in way over my head","I started working in construction as a secretary in 2019 when I was 21. It was my first actual ""responsibilities"" job. We were the GC (general contractor? I don't know the abbreviations in English that well), building 4 ""luxury"" apartment buildings. The team was amazing there, all of them quickly took me under their wing, and I was very eager to learn.

The PM was a genius, I swear. He had all of these excels and PowerQuery databases, with expense reports and progress reports and he was amazingly smart, he taught me a lot. The technical office PM was also amazingly smart, she taught me what formwork and rebar is, she taught me how to read an invoice, and how to make an IPC. The QC engineer showed me the amount of paperwork that goes into something like this and I helped a tiny bit. The engineers were all so smart.

I went on to work with them for a second, smaller project, where my responsibilities were less and we had less paperwork because we were building for ourselves.

Next, I got a call from an engineer from my first project, asking me to be his assistant manager on a new project with a small company. Two apartment buildings the company was building for themselves with some fancy gimmicks.

Our team there was just my PM, me, an engineer fresh out of school, and the company's GM. Over time, we got another engineer, and another girl to help me out.

My workload was intense. I learned how to calculate (most) materials, find suppliers, negotiate prices, find subcontractors, write contracts, manage material deliveries, manage paperwork, onboard new employees, be their go-between for the GM, explain their own contracts (it was, mostly, their first job), make sure we all got paid on time, kept the budget, made sure invoices were paid on time, kept track of all of them, built a good raport with the subcontractors and suppliers. Ngl they worked me like a horse but I loved what I was doing and the pay was not bad.

My team was great and the PM was insanely smart. There was not a problem he couldn't find a solution for. And whenever I got stuck on something, I had someone I could trust to give me some advice. The GM was a different story. I was doing everything from making coffees and setting up meetings, to making hundred thousand dollars IPCs and signing invoices in his name. So everything that went wrong was my fault, somehow. I wrapped it up and put in a one month notice. He brought in two women to take my place and I trained both of them very well, they are still working there a year later.

I moved to a much much smaller city. I didn't want to work in construction anymore because although I love it, it is insanely stressful sometimes. I did work for two months for one of the big names here, but the responsibilities were not what I signed up for so I left. I applied for an executive assistant job and got a call back from the CEO, and he asked me basically, what I did before. I started listing things off, and I should mention I worked in other areas too, so I know just a tiny bit of basic IT (installing a printer and basic troubleshooting), a bit about CRMs, a bit about about marketing and automation, a bit about social media, etc. I'm sure it seems impressive. 

He was more than impressed and hired me as a Project Lead for a multifunctional building he's building for himself. He is the GC and beneficiary.. This is his only project like this, they are a pretty big deal in infrastructural works, like road maintenance and stuff. However for my project there are no engineers, I'm the one doing everything, he told me the only reason he's not calling me a PM is because I do not have the studies for it. There is no QC engineer. I am doing everything from checking the rebar lists, finding suppliers, subcontractors, budget keeping, schedule planning, progress report, concept creating, moodboards, meetings with the designers, checking up on the site progress, etc etc etc. I got to go to two foreign countries to see how they're designing these types of buildings and it was amazing.

However I think I'm in way over my head. I knew I don't know shit, but I'm learning just how much shit it is that I truly have no clue about. The designers keep making stupid mistakes, the structural subcontractors are making stupid mistakes, we were late before I came on board and now we're even more late because my boss keeps wanting higher-end stuff and I have to run after him to make decisions once I have the numbers. 

Plus, this is a new city, I have to build raport all over again with my subcontractors, I have to find different suppliers and subcontractors, I don't know much about anything here. My luck is I had a two-month stint at a construction company before coming here and heard a few of the big names working here. 

My boss thinks I'm doing a great job, having discovered quite a few mistakes in time to fix them and making him a bomb-ass contract. I think I'm an idiot. I am not an engineer. Anything a bit more techincal and I'm lost. I'm googling and ChatGPT-ing like crazy. And I'm not building in the US, I'm in Europe, we're working with reinforced concrete and there are different laws here regarding buildings.

He did notice my workload and got another co-worker to help me with sending emails and calling people up because I just do not have the time. She thinks I'm amazing and is coming up to me with questions that I luckily have googled or stumbled upon before so I do have the answers. But I am an idiot and only one co-worker might have an inkling as to how much of an idiot I am. And I am extremely grateful, 'cause he's the only one here who knows a bit more about the technical side of stuff and he can give me a tiny bit of advice here and there, but he's not an expert either.

Does anyone else feel like this? Should I have just taken an easier job? I really love what I'm doing, dont get me wrong, but I feel so so so inadequate and dumb. Everyday I'm realizing how much I dont know, everyday I realize I missed something and have to go back and check it. The designers are fucking up constantly and I'm exhausted calling them up every time I find something and waiting for them to fix it. Going to a construction college right now is borderline impossible financially. This company is not gonna pay for it, they were very clear this is their only construction project. My only salvation is I am very eager to learn and curious by nature but I feel like I'm pretending to know what I'm talking about when for some things I only just googled the answer 10 minutes ago.",0,1738053498.0,ConstructionManagers,0,0.5,False

I’ve got $300 in AWS credits and 6 months to turn it into… something awesome (and possibly profitable). As a full-stack developer, I want to make the most out of this freebie before it vanishes into the cloud (pun intended).

Some ideas I’ve toyed with:

A SaaS app that solves a niche problem (or pretends to).

Hosting something viral, like a meme generator that sells ad space.

A mining rig on AWS (just kidding… unless?).


But I know the Reddit hive mind can do better! I’m looking for clever ways to turn these credits into real value—whether it’s revenue, skills, or an insane story for my LinkedIn.

So, how would you maximize $300 in AWS credits? Got any crazy side hustle ideas, money-making projects, or even ways to build portfolio-worthy apps?

1ibx54c,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ibx54c/rf_short_story_draft_about_school_and_adulthood/,[RF] Short story draft about school and adulthood,"There was a dead opossum on the walk from my car to my classes in my last three semesters of college. She was run over by a train, smashed into the crevice that the wheels would routinely pass over on their daily transit, crushing her to oil over the months. I don’t remember the first time I saw her, but I only knew she was an opossum by her tail and fur patterns. If I saw her a week earlier I would see her roaming the streets, smile and carry on. If I saw her a week later I would know she was once alive, but only from the smell of flesh and patches of fur surrounding the area, now absent from her corpse. I wondered if she tried to escape the speeding train or if she played dead and accepted her fate. I thought someone ought to pick her up and walked to class. 

In class I would pick at my fingernails and focus on my heartbeat, hoping the professor and my peers would leave me alone and not ask me for anything. I really tried to pay attention. I wanted to be involved, but something inside was drowning the voice of the professor as he meticulously compounded on information I was meant to have remembered from previous classes. I pretended to pay attention, writing notes, but I often found myself thinking about the opossum. Watching the clock, it never failed to reach 11:45, 12:20, 2:05, though I often thought these times would never come. As soon as they came I would leave the classroom and briskly strut back to my car, glancing at her on the way and noticing her fast deterioration. 

The weeks carried on, which became months, then a year, and she was still there. Her tail was gone. The tufts of hair had long been blown away by the wind. The guts that spilled out of her had been eaten by squirrels, birds, other opossums. Anything else salvageable by life was taken by the bugs and bacteria. I found myself growing in anger by the day that no one moved her. Hundreds of people walked by her every day, careless to the steady disrespect of her corpse. I don’t know why I didn’t help her, why I simply continued to simmer in anger that no one else did something when I could have done it myself. I don’t think anyone else knew the stain on the ground was ever a living being. She was reduced to oil, mistakable for dirt, but I knew. 

The gnawing thoughts of her plagued my mind as I tried to focus on my finals. I sat there, pencil in hand, buzzing in my ear, blank stare. The questions being asked of me seemed to be in a foreign language. Walking out of my last exam, finally summer vacation, I was supposed to feel relief, even pride. But I only felt dread and shame. I knew I had to claw my way out of my mind. 

I failed one class and did poorly in all of my other ones, so I drank about it for a few days. It served as a temporary escape from my failures, from the opossum. One morning I awoke and was so disgusted by my disheveled room that I had to do something. I couldn’t take it anymore. In a burst of energy I picked up my clothes from the floor and washed them. I took my trash to the curb, surviving the harsh crinkling of empty beer cans that filled me with regret for my unhealthy coping mechanisms. I vacuumed, mopped, organized. I didn’t drink. The next few days I continued to go through the motions. I reached out to friends, thankful to finally hear from me again and worried about how I was doing. I went on walks and routinely got coffee at local shops, where I would mingle with the locals, even making a couple friends. They didn’t seem to notice anything wrong. I started gardening. After going through the motions for long enough it became easy to me. I almost forgot the opossum. Maybe I could live like the rest of society after all, and better yet, maybe I could enjoy it. Things were going well, and then summer break ended and I went to class again. I didn’t think about the opossum until I was face to face with her, and everything came rushing back to me.

All of the sudden I couldn’t breathe. I ran back to my car, almost striking a car as I carelessly bolted down the crosswalk. My heart pounded so hard I thought I was having a heart attack. I turned on the car’s air conditioning and aimed it at my face, but I kept sweating. I did what my mother told me to do in these instances. Five things I can see, four things I can feel, et cetera. This practice calmed my nerves but could not eliminate my panic. After several minutes, with shaking legs and hands, I took the long way to my class, avoiding her. I don’t remember what the class was about.

During the next months my grades continued to deteriorate, along with my room. My garden, showing promise in the summer, had dried up and wilted. My friends gave up on reaching out despite their concern. Looking at my university card I could not recognize the boy looking back at me, smiling with motivation and excited to see what experiences awaited me, which had now so mundanely passed. The glamour of freedom had become a burden, a drab routine I could not convince myself to follow to a point of acceptability. I was crushed by my responsibilities and reduced to oil myself. I stopped going to class, I couldn’t stand to keep looking at her. She rotted away and I did nothing to stop it. No one ever picked her up, and I never graduated.

Backstory: My boyfriend of 3 years started a new night job at a very lucrative company, early on he said that he met a female coworker who works at the lounge there who randomly sparked up a conversation with him (my boyfriend is very friendly and very attractive). According to him the lounge girls are known to be beautiful. He said that she would talk to him almost every night, and I thought it was cool at first because it seemed like people were friendly and welcoming to him at his new job.

He then started bringing her up at our dates, ie. about how he had heard from another coworker that she had a massive crush on him. Again, I thought “well yah he’s cute and very friendly” girls are bound to have crushes. I didn’t think much of it. He would also say how she would talk to him a lot about her family and her getting closer to her religion. He said that he was so proud of her and how he was happy that she said that she didn’t want to be touched by men at her job anymore? (I’m guessing it was common in their workplace) 

Fast forward a couple of months, I notice texts between them in his phone, but they were deleted and i recovered them and the messages were “innocent” they were talking about her buying a sweater, and he said that he wanted to see what it looked like on her. 

Something about this rubbed me the wrong way…I pressed him about this and asked endlessly why he deleted the texts. He told me that he didn’t want me to get mad or take it the wrong way. It started feeling like the puzzle was coming together but I felt gaslit that he kept telling me I was wrong about this all and that Im overreacting. I keep pressing him about this and he reveals to me that she would come into his office to “wait for an Uber” every shift and chat with him for 30-minutes before she leaves and bring him tea and coffee. He also told me that he used to tell her that he had a gf (but I mean when has that ever stopped someone).

My gut tells me that I shouldn’t trust him and he let this go on for months. He also had a past of lying to me and my trust with him is paper thin. He is begging me not to leave him. I need some advice here pls.",1,1738052829.0,relationship_advice,9,1.0,False
1ibx22o,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_homeandsoul/comments/1ibx22o/small_space_solutions_decorating_tips_to_maximize/,Small Space Solutions: Decorating Tips to Maximize Your Living Area,"Living in a small space doesn't mean sacrificing style or comfort. With the right strategies and a touch of creativity, you can transform even the coziest corners into functional and aesthetically pleasing areas. Whether you're working with a studio apartment or a compact room, these small space solutions will help you make the most of your living area.

# 1. Embrace Vertical Space with Wall Decoration

When floor space is limited, look up! Walls are often underutilized in small spaces, but they offer endless opportunities for creative [wall decoration](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/decoration/wall-hanging-decorations).

* **Shelving:** Install floating shelves to display books, plants, or decorative pieces like a [white ceramic vase](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/product/white-ceramic-vase). This not only adds storage but also elevates your decor.
* **Mirrors:** Hang mirrors to create the illusion of a larger space. Position them to reflect natural light for an even brighter, airier feel.
* **Art and Frames:** Gallery walls with smaller pieces of art or family photos can add personality without overwhelming the room.

# 2. Opt for Multipurpose Furniture

Furniture that serves multiple purposes is a game-changer for small spaces. Look for ottomans with hidden storage, sofa beds, or coffee tables that double as desks. This not only maximizes functionality but also reduces clutter, creating a more spacious feel.

**Styling Tip:** Add a touch of elegance with a white ceramic vase placed on a multifunctional coffee table. Pair it with fresh greenery for a minimalist and modern vibe.

# 3. Light Colors for a Spacious Look

Lighter hues create the illusion of more space. Stick to a neutral color palette with whites, beiges, and soft grays for walls and furniture. To add depth, layer textures using throws, rugs, or cushions.

**Pro Tip:** Incorporate [natural home decoration](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/outdoor/decorations) elements like jute rugs, woven baskets, or wooden accents. These materials bring warmth to the room while maintaining a light, airy aesthetic.

# 4. Maximize Storage with Smart Solutions

Clutter can make any space feel smaller, so prioritize organization.

* **Hidden Storage:** Use under-bed drawers, stackable boxes, or furniture with built-in storage to keep items out of sight.
* **Hooks and Pegboards:** These are excellent for small kitchens, entryways, or bathrooms to store essentials in a visually appealing way.
* **Decorative Storage:** Visit [home decor stores](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/) to find stylish storage solutions, such as decorative baskets or lidded boxes, that blend functionality with design.

# 5. Bring Nature Indoors

Small spaces benefit greatly from touches of nature. Adding plants, flowers, or natural materials can make your space feel fresh and inviting.

**Ideas for Natural Home Decoration:**

* Use indoor plants like pothos or succulents in sleek pots.
* Decorate shelves with a white ceramic vase filled with dried flowers or fresh blooms.
* Choose wooden or rattan furniture to complement your natural home decoration theme.

# 6. Create Zones in Open Spaces

In compact living areas, defining zones can help your space feel more organized and functional. Use rugs, furniture placement, or even lighting to distinguish between the living, dining, and sleeping areas.

**Wall Decoration Tip:** Use art or wall-mounted decor to visually anchor each zone. For example, a striking piece of wall art above a sofa can define the living room area.

# 7. Shop Smart at Home Decor Stores

When decorating a small space, every piece matters. Explore home decor stores that specialize in compact, multifunctional furniture and decor items. Look for space-saving designs, foldable furniture, and lightweight materials that can be moved around easily.

**Quick Pick:** A white ceramic vase is a versatile addition that works in any room. Pair it with seasonal flowers or greenery to add a fresh and elegant touch to your space.

**Final Thoughts**

Decorating a small space is all about balance, creativity, and smart choices.

My first ever coffee machine and know nothing about them. When turning on the machine (especially the steam to froth milk) the group head starts to sizzle and hiss and let off steam. It continues to make a weird hissing noise even after I've turned off the machine and the top of the machine gets SUPER hot. Is this normal and should I be worried? I'm a bit concerned it could start a fire.

Bloody stool happened once, but my stool is often light brown and from time to time had mucus/string things as well as black spots or dark clumps surrounding it. Every time i pooped (sorry) there is also this bulge around my anus that I can feel each time I washed but then it goes away and it doesnt hurt. 

Doctor advised that it was probably hemorrhoids and the blood was from one of the popped hemorrhoids so I got prescribed suppositories (1 week twice a day) and diosmin + hesperidin (3 times a day for 4 days, 2 times a day for remaining 3 days) as well as Esomeprazole as I also experience really really bad painful acid from time to time. 

Currently, I am booking for a follow up consultation this friday as I did not see any improvements but I also wanted to post here to gather insights as well

Symptoms: thin stools from time to time, anal bulge after pooping, blood in stool (happened once), spots around the stool, bad acid from time to time, bloating and rumbling sounds in the tummy (feels like trapped gas), very foul smell even with the smallest gas, it also feels like i have to push out the stool and gas with more effort than naturally

Diet: To be honest i dont drink water that much, meals are mostly rice and pork dishes, heavy coffee drinker

Lifestyle: i would say im quite active as i my commute to work requires a lot of steps daily, i also try to run at least once a week",0,1738052702.0,coloncancer,2,0.5,False

I (18f) live in Australia and here you can cash in cans and bottles for 10 cents each. I’m sure other countries do that too.

This morning my dad (60s) and I went and cashed in all the cans and bottles we had. As I was loading everything into the car my mum (50s) pointed at two boxes full of cans so I took it as she wanted me to take them so I did. 

Half of those cans and bottles were mine that I had purchased with my own money anyway so when we got home I gave my mum half of the money and I kept the other half. When she asked where the rest of it was I told her I was keeping it because half of the stuff was mine. Now she is mad at me, won’t talk to me and glares whenever she sees me. 

She said something about how the money from those was meant to reimburse her for the surprise 18th birthday party she threw for me which, don’t get me wrong I am so grateful for, I didn’t even ask for. She also said that apparently what she had meant before we left when she was pointing at the boxes was that she had taken my coffee bottles out from there, not to take the boxes. How am I supposed to know that just from her pointing at them? I ended up giving her the rest of the money to which she told me to shove it up my arse. I then sent her a text about how I was confused and her response was “YADTM” (you are dead to me). 

My dad is not really doing much, he says he’s on my side but he isn’t saying anything to her or trying to calm her down and I just don’t know what to do. I don’t feel like I should have to apologise for not being able to read her mind. So AITAH?",1,1738052659.0,AITAH,10,1.0,False

1ibwyg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/NetherlandsHousing/comments/1ibwyg9/is_a_landlord_required_to_publish_a_new_energy/,Is a landlord required to publish a new energy label for exisiting rental lease?,"Good morning!

A month ago, I received a message from my landlord’s management company. They wanted to schedule an appointment with an energy advisor to create an energy label for the apartment I’ve been renting on a fixed contract since 2021. When the energy advisor visited, he mentioned that the management company was doing this for many rental apartments in the area to update their records.

At the end of the inspection, we had a little chat over a cup of coffee. He laughed about the current energy label, which was listed as a C in 2019. According to him, the apartment would likely receive an F label, or at best, an E.

I found this quite interesting because, according to 'huurprijscheck', my apartment (with an energy label C) is just above the minimum points required for social housing. However, if you input an E or F label, the apartment would fall below that threshold, which technically means that regardless of when the contract was signed, I should be able to 

My questions are:

* Is it mandatory for an energy advisor to make the new energy label public (e.g., on ep-online.nl), or is this only required when the apartment is rented or sold again?
* And if they do publish an F label now, would I be within my rights to request a rent reduction and fall under social housing? My salary in 2023-2024 was below the income threshhold.

First off, happy holidays and a Happy New Year and thank you for your comments and opinions and for those who PM-ed me asking if I was okay!

Second of all: Guess who started 2025 single and in her new apartment?

If that's all you wanted to learn in the update, thanks for reading but for those who like tea stick around cause the kettle is screaming

I guess I have to start by explaining what happened after the post.  
I read all the comments and collected I was not the AH in the situation and a lot of you had mentioned I lacked a spin and has issues speaking up more of the situation which made me realize I indeed had a problem. I was letting Matt and Sadie walk all over me and I knew it needed to end.

I ended sitting Matt down to have a chat with him about the whole Sadie scare thing and even showed him some comments from the post for him to see. However, he was more angry of the one of two comments warning me he may cheat on me with Sadie. He started to yell at me, asking if I believe this bullshit, and was being far more aggressive than any few times he is and it was towards me and not a video game round. Like nothing I was doing was calming him down and eventually I left to stay at my best friend's house in near tears.

Matt called and texted me a lot in varies apologizes and anger and even accused me of being with a man instead of being with my friend. He has NEVER acted like this before and it woke me up something else was going on that was bigger than me upset his best friend was hijacking our dates.

We had a brief ""cooling off"" period where we weren't in the same apartment for about a week so he can sit and think about everything and I can debate if I want us to break up or not. I still loved him so it was hard.  
Anyway, after the week I arrived back and we sat down and had a much calmer talk about Sadie and everything else in which he apologized for making me feel like a third wheel in our own relationship but still swore he doesn't Sadie is doing it maliciously.

Guys, I was about to forgive him, let him sweep this under the rug again with a warning, if it were for something under the coffee table that caught my eye. A top the suspiciously looked like Sadie's.

I confronted him about it and he swore up, down, and around touch your toes that he doesn't know how it got there, that Sadie hung out for a bit but they didn't do anything, that it must be mine, etc. I snapped and demanded he tell me the truth and I'll break up with him if I find out he lied, then he cracked. He confessed while I was gone for that week Sadie came over to talk to him and they hooked-up. But he swore they only made-out and removed their tops and touched each other down there and ""nothing more"".

Yeah, I left immidentally.

He got mad I was breaking up with him even when he told me the truth, getting in my face, and even threw a picture frame by my head when I was by the door. He has never been this upset or toxic before so it was a shock and I legit ran to the parking lot to my car.

I knew Sadie left her shirt at our place on purpose as a sort of ""calling card"" so she can say she got him. I honestly laughed more than anything out of this whole mess.

We broke up, I stayed at my friend's place while I sort my new apartment which I could afford decently thanks to my job, and requested a floor transferred in my workplace so me and Matt wouldn't see each other which was granted cause I'm good at what I do. And Sadie has moved into Matt's place and been posting nonstop on her social media of how happy she is to be in love with her best friend, even tagging me in her comments or sending the posts to me via my social media to the point I had to block her.

Right now I just finished setting up my new TV in my living room, got dog since I couldn't before thanks to Matt's allergy who's my son and I love him. Matt's parents did contact me to apologize for their son's actions, I got along with them well so it makes sense they'd be upset to hear we broke up and why, and from last I heard in the grape vine is Sadie isn't as welcomed in Matt's family house as she used to.

This may not the as great as an update as many of you may have wanted, and I due apologize for the long wait, but thank you all so much for helping me realize the kind of nightmare disguised as a fairy tale I was in. I would've never realize how red Matt's flags were if it weren't for the comments predicting the cheating and telling me ""grow a spine"". Now this spine is shiny and sturdy and ready to take on this new year proper.
