I’ve been going through some of life’s dramas and been feeling quite down in the dumps lately which is why I’m looking for someone I could game and chat with. I mainly play on PS5 and own a Switch. I don’t play too many things but games I enjoy are:

•Monster Hunter World (I’m hyped for Wilds!)
•Monster Hunter Rise & GU (Switch)
•Baldur’s Gate 3
•Elden Ring
•Ark Survival Ascended
•Nioh 2
•Palworld
•Borderlands 3
•Terraria
•Pokémon
•Super Smash Bros Ult
•Path of Exile 2 (still new)
And some more.

Some facts about me would include being a 5’2 shorty, love gaming (obviously), loves coffee, likes all things fantasy, scifi, horror, love to cook and hate spiders!

Hey there!  

I’m a 25-year-old from India, currently living in Italy—because apparently, I thought surviving on pasta and coffee alone was a solid life plan (no regrets so far). Living abroad has been a great journey of self-discovery, mostly realizing how much I miss home-cooked food and how bad I am at folding fitted sheets.  

A bit about me—I’m into sports, movies, and TV shows, and I have a ""slightly"" obsessive love for Formula 1. If you also enjoy high-speed drama and questionable Ferrari strategies, we’ll probably get along great. If not, don’t worry—I promise I can talk about other things too. Like how pineapple on pizza is an unresolved international debate.  

But honestly, I think good connections are built on more than just shared interests. I value meaningful conversations, mutual respect, and the kind of banter that makes you laugh at your phone like an idiot in public. Quality time is super important to me—whether it’s sharing a meal, exploring new places, or just having a deep conversation about life (or which fictional character had the worst plot arc).  

Speaking of food, I love cooking. I wouldn’t call myself a *chef*, but I can definitely make something edible, and I promise to only slightly judge your taste in food. If you think cereal counts as a meal, I won’t argue. Probably.  

So if you’re up for a chat—whether it’s about life, movies, or just debating whether naps should be considered a sport—drop a message! Looking forward to meeting someone who’s down for good convos and maybe some friendly roasting along the way.

1imx8yc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1imx8yc/hes_telling_me_hes_not_ready_to_date_but_others/,He’s telling me he’s not ready to date but others that he’s looking for marriage?,"In November, a guy hit on me and asked me out on a date. He seemed nice, so I said yes, and we went out together. We clicked pretty well and both agreed that we should go on more dates. We liked the same things, we only had positive things to say about each other. So we met again, and on our second date, we talked about wanting something serious and getting to know each other better.

Now, in February, another woman mistook him for someone else and started talking to him. She quickly realized her mistake, but he still suggested going for a walk with the dog or grabbing a coffee together. She asked what he was looking for, and he said something serious. And that he wanted to get married.

Of course, he has every right to date another woman. I’m on Tinder myself and talking to other people, so that’s not the problem.

But! That same day, I asked if he might want to go to a hockey game with me. He then said he wasn’t really ready to date right now. He was okay with meeting up for something sexual but understood if that wasn’t what I wanted.

He said that things could absolutely develop into something more, like a relationship, and that he likes me and thinks I’m a great woman.

When I asked why he suddenly wasn’t ready for something serious—since he had previously given that impression—his explanation was:
	•	That he didn’t feel mentally ready.
	•	That he couldn’t give enough of himself.
	•	That his mother is sick, which exhausts him, and things are very up and down for him.

Why would he say one thing to me, whom he has known since November, and something completely different to a woman he chatted with for two minutes?

1imx295,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1imx295/best_replacement_water_filter_ispring_f9k_review/,Best replacement water filter iSpring F9K review for clean & alkaline water,"Testing the iSpring F9K 1-Year Reverse Osmosis Water Filter Replacement Cartridge Pack in my everyday life was quite an experience. Installing it in my 6-stage RO system was straightforward, even for someone like me who isn’t exactly a DIY expert. I loved how the replacement pack came well-packaged with nine essential filters, including sediment, carbon, and alkaline remineralization filters. The alkaline filter, in particular, caught my attention, as it promised to restore healthy minerals like calcium and magnesium, giving the water an ideal pH balance.

Using this product has been a game-changer for my family. My morning coffee tastes more vibrant, and even the ice cubes look clearer. The kids have started drinking more water, which is always a win for any parent. The water quality is noticeably improved, with a crisp and clean taste that’s better than bottled water. One thing I appreciated was the updated push-fit connection system; swapping out old filters for new ones was much quicker than I expected.

However, I did notice a metallic taste from the alkaline filter during the initial use. Running the faucet for 20-30 seconds before filling a glass resolved the issue, but it’s something to be mindful of. On the other hand, the filters’ longevity is impressive, lasting a full year without decreasing water quality.

[Time to see iSpring F9K cost on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/product-reviews/best-replacement-water-filter-ispring-f9k-review-b00boasj1m/)

**Pros**

* Excellent filtration quality with healthy mineral restoration.
* Straightforward installation and quick filter swaps.
* Improves water taste significantly for drinking and cooking.
* Long-lasting, providing a full year of use.
* Compact design fits easily under the sink.

**Cons**

* Alkaline filter can initially produce a metallic taste.
* Requires running water for 20-30 seconds during first use.
* Does not include the RO membrane, which must be purchased separately.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
Comparing the iSpring F9K to other well-known brands like APEC and Aquasana, the iSpring stands out for its alkaline remineralization feature. APEC systems provide excellent filtration but lack the added benefit of remineralization, which enhances water pH and taste. Aquasana systems are also highly efficient but tend to be pricier while offering comparable filtration quality. The iSpring excels in its affordability and ease of installation, though its initial metallic taste issue might deter some users.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
While researching similar products, I found the iSpring F9K to offer exceptional value for its price. Competing brands often charge more for a similar feature set, especially for systems that include alkaline filters. The iSpring provides a full year of filtration, which reduces recurring costs and makes it a budget-friendly choice for families. For anyone looking to invest in a reliable under-sink water filtration system, this is a solid contender.

1imx07j,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/1imx07j/24m_trying_to_figure_out_what_to_do/,(24/m) Trying to figure out what to do,"Hey there folks. Looking for some advice on what to do - I'm spending 12-hour marathon sessions shotgunning job apps all over the place and writing cover letters, then crashing out and sleeping. It's clear that my mind is broken right now. Sorry for the inbound essay.

  
I spent three years in college working towards becoming a history teacher, then realized how bad the market was for that, realized I didn't have the money to go on to a master's, freaked out, almost failed, and then took a 3-year leave of absence to try to calm down and save up enough money to someday finish my degree, even if it is now effectively worthless.

  
In the intervening three years, I took a job in a coffee place, got extremely dissatisfied with management (I closed the store with the manager's daughter, she always sat in the back video chatting friends and leaving four hours early to go party, effectively making me working solo for 8 hours - I wouldn't mind it if we simply didn't have the manpower, but we did. I brought it up with the manager politely and nothing changed). I quit a few months in after work-related tension boiled over into the home, and my parents basically told me to quit. A month later, I was hired by a UPS Store, where I put in the hard work, learned quickly, always accepted additional responsibility and chances to learn, and that combined with a bit of luck in timing resulted in me becoming the center manager after one year. I worked two years as the manager of the store, always striving to find new opportunities to expand my knowledge base or assume more responsibility. During the Crowdstrike incident that affected computer systems nationwide last year, I even helped devise a bit of a workaround which allowed our store to restore most of our computer systems' functionality, allowing us to reopen in a few hours, despite me having no actual IT experience or training, and essentially patching this together with a little thinking, logic, minimal information from corporate, and a random guide on Google I found on basic command prompt commands. As the store owner also owned a few other UPS Stores as well, I shared this solution with the rest of the stores he owned and helped them get operational too, and...I can by no means actually confirm this claim, but a few hours after I shared my solution with my immediate supervisor, corporate sent out updated instructions to all stores which looked suspiciously similar to my solution, so I might just have an uncredited part in that (which means I'm out here banging rocks together with no knowledge and a Google search better than those corporate IT guys getting paid many times more in comfy offices).

  
Despite the honestly-not-too-horrible-I-can-just-about-survive-on-starvation wage I was getting (plus the fact that I was pushing ridiculous overtime whenever I could), and despite the store owner and my immediate supervisor all but begging me to stay, I ultimately left in the fall of 2024. I had promised my parents that I would graduate college, and even if I no longer planned to teach and even if it was 3 years late, I decided it was my responsibility to honor that promise, and maybe it could provide incidental use on job apps. I took a lot of courses outside of my original subject of study, and although they were admittedly ""intro"" courses, I did well enough to make the Dean's list that semester. I also pushed a fairly heavy schedule, which allowed me to finally graduate in December one semester ""early"". After graduating, I went back to the store for a single day since they needed the help, and then I had to go abroad for a month.

  
Which brings me to now. In order to push through school with minimal debt, I lived at home and basically saved up most of the money I'd earned those three years, but now I have all but fifty dollars to my name now. I know my degree in history is basically worth nothing, beyond maybe ticking a single box for a job requirement (but not in a good field, thus losing out to other applicants). I have the three years of work at the store, which involved a lot of generic office tasks, a lot of customer service, a decent amount of physical labor, and two years as a manager acting as the main point of contact and managing confidential customer records, while overseeing and training associates and ensuring supplies were stocked up and fixing minor technical issues. I've also gotten my former supervisor to agree to act as a recommendation, and I'm sure with all that I've done for the store he should be able to give me a good recommendation. So on the plus side, I've got \*relatively\* low debt, I've got a useless B.A. for what it's worth, I've got a record of working hard in a job and getting promoted in recognition of it, and if I squint my eyes and project a bunch of wishful thinking, I have experience in an office setting, and experience in customer service and a bit of labor. I have a story I can tell about creatively solving a problem in an area I have no training or knowledge in, but that sort of requires me to get to the interview stage in the first place.

  
On the downside, I've got no real cash left to spend on any more school for now, my work experience is still primarily retail which doesn't pay too well and doesn't have much further I can rise the ranks for better pay, and the field my degree is in is absolutely useless now that I can't go on with a master's or something like that. I've got no real skills beyond existing as a human being. I could perhaps try to go back to the store, but by now this is a calmer part of the year businesswise and they've already got a replacement in my old spot, so I'd have to likely wait and then accept lower pay. And to top it all off, I'm starting to experience some back and neck pain. It's not too horrible, mostly it's just extreme discomfort in my neck, but occasionally my back just goes nuts with pain.

  
I have a time limit as well - my parents are from another country and they think I have absolutely zero chance in the States (which is a fair assumption to make), and they want me to move abroad to take a customer service job. That doesn't really help me learn anything that might be useful in the States, so I'd have to settle for an exile of sorts, but I love the region I live in now and am far more familiar with the States. Even if the QOL is honestly better abroad, for some dumb reason my idiot home-loving heart wants to find a way to stay. I've got until May to figure something out, or else I'm leaving the country.

  
Ideally, I have two paths I'd like to go down. I'd like to either get a clerical/administrative job with the state or local government, as the pay and benefits is enough for me to live on and get by. Alternatively, I've applied to a lot of administrative positions in local colleges and universities, even if the pay isn't as good, since the benefits are still alright and some employees get tuition assistance in case I can luck out into saving enough to try something again in the future. This would be the ideal route even if the skills are a bit of a dead end, since if I can eventually fight my way into a job with state or local government, job security should be decent and benefits good, and I will be able to scrape by. The other path I think has a real future is the trades, but I don't have any trade school or experience, nor do I have any connections with anybody in the trades, so breaking in will be extremely difficult. I'm willing to work hard and learn - I've proven I'm willing to work hard and learn - but beyond maybe doing some light stuff on my old car, I've got no real trades experience. Plus, I have no idea if my back and neck will be able to keep up. If I do manage to break into this and learn some sort of skill though, I'd at least finally have a tiny bit of value on the labor market and a chance at future potential. Those are the two ideal paths I'm looking at right now; higher end administrative work for survivable pay and alright benefits, or trades to see how much longer I can push my body in exchange for some sort of useful skill. I've applied to USPS as a last resort.



I've been spending the last few days nonstop searching - writing cover letters, firing off applications, and I'm just disheartened. I haven't heard anything from the clerical or administrative stuff, and unsurprisingly with no on-paper experience even the trades-related companies that say they just want to train someone with the right attitude don't want to take a look at me, I've already been rejected by about ten of them. This job search has destroyed my mental sanity, I spend all day stuck to the computer in 12+ hour marathons writing cover letters and applying to jobs, and I spend what little time I don't do that lying in bed trying to think of other options. I've still got a few months left until May, but it feels hopeless. I know I should probably seek medical help for my mental state, but I don't have money and it won't help me get out of the situation. Half of me is starting to wonder if I should go to church, find God, and pray for my soul, because this is gonna require divine intervention. Where do all the tradies hang out? Small business guys who don't post stuff online? Rich dudes who have strings they can pull in universities and local governments?



So please, let me know if there's any other path out there that I can begin supporting myself that I can get with no qualifications and the minimum of actual skills in a few months, because I am legitimately going insane. Eastern Massachusetts if it matters, although willing to try opportunities all over the state and in neighboring states. Sorry for the long rant.",1,1739275333.0,findapath,1,1.0,False

But as time passed, medyo nakikita na namin real personality niya, he's a self-centered btch who always considered himself a superior, and mahangin din siya bes.

One time, samin niya nabuhos galit niya for whatever reason kaya hindi siya nag lesson (economics) at sinabing mag self study nalang daw kami, although okay lang naman samin pero when we asked him what page sa libro or what topic yung pag-aaralan namin he just said na kami na raw mismo maghanap at aralin nalang namin lahat ng topic sa 3rd quarter (like wtf????), and take note hindi siya nagbibiro. He also said na starting tommorrow kailangan muna namin mag take ng quiz bago niya i-discuss. 

Then, nagsalita na yung iba kong cm dahil nga hindi namin kaya 'yon. Pero wtf, alam niyo kung anong sinabi samin?? kinumpara niya sarili niya samin, na kesyo siya nga raw kinaya niya 'yon nung college siya, na pinag-aralan at kinabisado niya na raw libro ng economics kasi ganoon daw siya kasipag. Like, bakit mo ikukumpara sarili mo na may degree sa 3rd year highschool student na hindi pa fully developed yung utak and yung iba immatured pa. 

After non nag-set siya ng meeting every friday for officers only (secretary ako), then andami niyang sinasabi tapos hindi naman nasunod, gusto niya kasi perfect lahat, nag-set siya ng rule na bawal uminom or mag-akyat ng inumin sa classroom (kahit may dala ka pang tumbler), ayoko na ilatag rules niya rito at baka maging maikling kwento pa 'to.

Yes, hindi pa nagtatapos, meron pa. Akala namin hanggang doon nalang yung gagawin niyang paghihirap samin, pero hindi. Yesterday (1st day ng exam) nagalit nanaman siya saming lahat kasi may iilan na nagtatawanan kasi di talaga mapigilan sa samahan namin yung mag joke lalo na tapos naman na lahat mag sagot ng exam. Dahil doon nagalit siya kahit hindi naman super oa yung tawa nung iba, before mag-start yung next subject na ite-take namin kinuha niya yung 20mins sa 1hr kasi trip niya lang, saglit lang yung sermon pero 20mins kaming mukhang tanga na naghihintay sakaniya na ibigay samin yung test papers, kasi gusto niya 10mins before mag end yung time napasa na namin, edi 30mins lang kami nag-take at hindi pa kami makapag-isip nang maayos kasi sobrang dami niyang sinasabi during exam. Naulit pa 'yon sa lahat ng subject.

On the 2nd day of the exam, what he did to us was repeated, but worse. Dalawang subject muna yung need naming i-take na exam before mag break time (9am-9:30am), saktong 9am kami natapos lahat kasi nga nag overtime nanaman siya kanina kaya late kami nakapag-start. Akala namin palalabasin niya na kami kasi nga break time na at nakababa na yung mga students sa building namin. But what he did to us almost made me cry, kasi sobrang gutom na ako that time because I usually don't eat in the morning talaga before going in, not even coffee. He made us stand for 20mins straight without us knowing why, I was so dizzy because he even closed the two doors and turned off the electric fan kaya sa sobrang inis ko naiiyak na ako. Para niya kaming tino-tortured, halos lahat ng girls samin hindi na rin kumakain sa umaga tapos yung iba ina-acid at ako naman may ulcer kaya sobrang inis na rin nung boys kasi lahat kami awang-awa na sa isa't isa. 9:20 pinababa niya na kami at kailangan nakabalik na raw kami sa room ng 9:28, my friemds and I didn't eat anymore kasi nawalan na talaga ng gana kumain and ubos na rin yung mga paninda. Saktong 9:30 na kami umakyat kasi nawalan na talaga kami ng pake sakaniya, we were still trying to calm ourselves down in the situation. 10:10, my friend and I finished the exam (napasa na namin), so we decided to eat chocolate may dala naman siya, kasi we both haven't eaten yet. Then nakita 'yon nung adviser namin kaya kinuha niya (hindi pa ako nabigyan ng chocolate that time), then umalis siya tapos pagbalik niya wala na yung chocolate, minutes passed binalikan niya yung chocolate, akala namin ibabalik niya na pero hindi. He made my friend stand up and then he said that my friend should throw it in the trash at durog-durugin muna before itapon. Halos naiyak nalang yung friend ko non kasi bigay sakaniya 'yon ng kuya niya. What he did really pissed me off kasi bakit kailangan niya pa magpahiya ng tao nang harap-harapan?.

I know he's just disciplining us because for sure there are worse things when we work in the future, but just look, I can't stand what he's doing.


previous attempts: We have reported him sa grade level head kasi minsan nahuhuli niya kung ano yung ginagawa ng adviser namin saamin. But still, hindi kami pwedeng basta-basta mag report sa guidance without enough evidence or witnesses, kasi nga sabi nung ignorant na adviser namin ""estudyante lang kayo, teacher ako"", does that mean na hindi na pantay-pantay karapatan ng tao bumoses?

1imwwly,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBeanReviews/comments/1imwwly/is_the_zulay_kitchen_classic_milk_boss_frother/,Is the Zulay Kitchen Classic Milk Boss Frother the best milk frother for your coffee needs? Read this review!,"Testing out the Zulay Kitchen Classic Milk Boss Frother felt like stepping into a barista's shoes, only in my kitchen. As someone who drinks coffee daily and enjoys experimenting with cappuccinos, matcha lattes, and hot chocolate, I was eager to see if this handheld frother could deliver rich, creamy foam as promised. Admittedly, I was skeptical at first, but its sleek Midnight Black design and compact stainless steel build had me intrigued.

Unboxing the device, I immediately appreciated the inclusion of two Duracell batteries—small details like this feel thoughtful. The stand that came with it was unexpectedly sturdy and didn’t wobble, which was a pleasant surprise. Using it for the first time was straightforward. A single push of the button and the frother spun to life, its motor buzzing with power. Within seconds, I had a frothy layer of milk sitting atop my coffee—no need to wait in line at a café. The froth was smooth and consistent, adding a luxurious touch to my morning routine.

My first experiment was with cold almond milk, as I’ve read mixed reviews about non-dairy milks frothing properly. To my delight, it worked better than I expected. I then tried heavy cream for a latte, and the result was impressively thick foam. This little device didn’t just meet my expectations—it exceeded them. I even tried it on matcha powder mixed with water, which tends to clump, and it blended the mixture seamlessly. Cleanup was equally hassle-free; a quick rinse under warm water while the whisk spun removed all residue. It’s also compact enough to tuck into a drawer, though it looks classy enough to leave on the counter.

**Pros**

* **Quick and Efficient:** Froths milk in seconds, ideal for busy mornings.
* **Compact Design:** Lightweight and easy to store with a durable stand.
* **Versatile:** Works on different liquids, from almond milk to heavy cream.
* **Easy to Clean:** A quick rinse spins residue away.
* **Battery-Powered:** Convenient portability without cords.

**Cons**

* **Durability Concerns:** Some reviews mention that the motor may weaken over time.
* **Flimsy Button Design:** The power button feels slightly fragile.
* **Battery Drain:** Frequent use may require regular battery replacements.
* **Not Ideal for Large Quantities:** Works better in smaller containers.

**Comparison to Competitors** Compared to similar products like the PowerLix Milk Frother and the Bonsenkitchen Handheld Frother, the Zulay Kitchen Classic Milk Boss Frother stands out in a few areas. Its compact design and included batteries are a significant advantage over the PowerLix, which often ships without batteries. The Bonsenkitchen frother has a solid reputation for durability, but it lacks the stylish stand that Zulay includes, which keeps the frother accessible and tidy on my counter.

However, the Zulay frother can struggle with larger batches, unlike the Aerolatte Milk Frother, which is slightly better designed for larger servings. That said, the Zulay model excels in speed, simplicity, and ease of use, making it ideal for individual servings.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money** While it’s not the cheapest frother on the market, its performance justifies the investment. The included batteries and stand add to its value and convenience, especially for those who want a plug-and-play experience. Cheaper alternatives may save you a few dollars upfront but often sacrifice power or build quality. Given the Zulay Kitchen frother’s functionality and thoughtful design, it’s a worthwhile purchase for coffee enthusiasts.

This frother has transformed my coffee routine, delivering café-quality foam without stepping out of the house. Whether you’re an occasional latte lover or a daily coffee drinker, it’s a handy tool that bridges the gap between convenience and indulgence. And if you’re wondering whether to splurge on a milk frother, this one might just convince you.

I don't fuck about. I'm old, I have cash & I've worked in music/sound for 30 years. 

I had the Hype 4 as my knock abouts as I don't take the others out of the house & someone offered me some CA Supermoon for the Hype 4 + a little cash... I wanted those for my Dad, so I did it. 

I wanted another knock around pair to replace them & sadly I wish I'd just bought the Hype 4 again. 

Aful 5+2 were absolutely the worst. I've heard there are significant differences between units, but mine sounded awful every time there was a heavy snare. Just a non descript, high end noise. Even reducing the treble using the DSP on my Mojo 2 (I don't EQ - if you need to go beyond slight adjustments of the mid high/upper high/mid low/sub low, you're using the wrong set). 

The Tea Pro were really disappointing. I really enjoyed the Tea 2, a long time ago - I'm unsure if I still would, as things have moved on a lot, but they really stood out back then. Not sure what those 2 DD's are actually doing because the bass is crap & the overall tonality is SHOCKING. 

The Dunu Davinci are the best of the bunch - and if that really is your dead set budget... certainly not terrible. If we're talking about this price bracket, which I admittedly don't have much knowledge of... but based on the others I've mentioned & a few more... they're the best ones I've tried. 

BUT the difference of what, $100?, to get the Hype 4 is a disproportionately enormous upgrade. They're good all rounders - especially if you have a Mojo 2 or if there's anything else similar... or EQ, you'll be able to use these for pretty much anything & they can go very basshead if you push the bottoms up - obviously I mean with no distortion. I dint think this is a subjective viewpoint; I think this is a very good cup of freshly ground coffee vs instant stuff level of better. 

They sound a lot better than a lot of much pricier sets - although personally not close to any of my pricier ones, but I can very happily listen to them & not feel I'm making a huge compromise - I can't say the same for the others, unfortunately. 

Do yourself a favour & put that extra bit towards something which is genuinely phenomenal value.

But let's be honest: just because you're ""used to it"" doesn't mean it's good for you. Getting used to something unhealthy doesn’t make it smart. You can get used to running on five hours of sleep, too, but that doesn’t mean it’s optimal

And no, **drinking coffee or tea isn’t a substitute for breakfast**. Caffeine tricks your brain into feeling awake, but it does nothing for your body’s actual energy needs. You’re not functioning efficiently, you’re just running on borrowed time until the inevitable crash. Your body wakes up after hours of fasting and expects fuel. Ignoring it doesn’t make you disciplined; it just makes you sluggish, irritable, and dependent on caffeine to keep you from feeling like a zombie

People who skip breakfast love to say they’re ""not hungry in the morning."" Well, of course you’re not, you’ve trained your body to suppress hunger signals. But that doesn’t mean your body doesn’t *need* food. You just don’t notice the damage until later in the day, when you’re randomly exhausted, craving sugar, or mindlessly snacking at night.

Skipping breakfast isn't about self-control or efficiency, it’s just another unhealthy habit disguised as a lifestyle choice. If you think you feel fine without it, you’re just numb to the effects. Try actually eating in the morning, and you might realize how much better your brain and body function",0,1739274322.0,unpopularopinion,77,0.44,False

As you'll find out almost immediately, there are discrepancies.*

According to the channel guide, Channel 3 is both ""The Coffee House"" and the new ""Unwell Music"" channel.  The new channel is ""Daddy's Unwell soundtrack XL"".  In reality...

Channel 17 is ""deleted"".  It's actually the new home for ""The Coffee House"".

Channel 106, ""Super Bowl LIX Radio"", is deleted.  Sirius-only play-by-play channels 106 and 119 return.

Channel 148 gains a space, going from ""RadioClassics"" to ""Radio Classics"":.,

SiriusXM Love splits into two channels - Channel 708 keeps the title but rebrands as ""love songs 60s-80s"".  Channel 709 is added, ""SiriusXO"", with ""love songs 90s-now"".

Channel 779, ""Mental Health Radio"", is deleted.  In its place is ""Unwell On Air"", Channel 786, ""unfiltered and unwell XL"".

Channel 859 has changed its name to suit the team - now ""Athletics"" - but has not been re-sorted under either ""A"" for Athletics or ""S"" for Sacramento.  Well;, not in the channel guide.  On players, Athletics are channel 841, and all teams from Atlanta through NY Yankees are one channel number higher.

A bunch of new Xtra channels for ""Places"" are added (channel numbers don't appear in the player):

*Jerry, George, and Elaine sit in their usual booth. Elaine is fuming, gripping a crumpled coupon. George stirs his coffee with an air of self-importance, while Jerry, as always, is amused but detached.*

**ELAINE**: You’re not gonna believe what just happened to me.

**JERRY**: I bet I will.

**ELAINE**: No, no, you won’t. Because this? This is injustice. This is the collapse of civilization as we know it.

**GEORGE**: (nodding) We are hanging by a thread, Jerry. A *thread.*

**ELAINE**: I go to that fancy new organic market—you know, the one where the cashiers act like they’re curing disease just by ringing you up—

**JERRY**: (mock serious) ""That’ll be $9.99. Also, you’re welcome for saving the planet.""

**ELAINE**: Exactly! So I get to the register with my *very valid* 50% off coupon—

**GEORGE**: 50%?!

**ELAINE**: (triumphant) 50%! Half off! That’s like—

**JERRY**: (deadpan) Half.

**ELAINE**: Right! But the cashier, this smarmy little guy with a man bun and *too much confidence*, looks at it and says, ""Ohhh, I’m sorry, this expired yesterday.""

**JERRY**: Ah.

**GEORGE**: Ooooh.

**ELAINE**: *ONE DAY, JERRY.* One! Like what, the ink evaporates? The paper crumbles into dust?

**GEORGE**: They do this on purpose. They print expiration dates knowing people will just barely miss them. It’s *psychological warfare.*

**JERRY**: They don’t want you to use the coupon, that’s the whole game. The store acts like it’s doing you a favor when, really, it’s hoping you fail.

**ELAINE**: Oh, it’s *diabolical.* And you know what he says to me? He actually *shrugs* and goes, “Rules are rules.”

**GEORGE**: Ohhh, the “rules are rules” guy. I *hate* that guy.

**JERRY**: The worst.

**ELAINE**: Like I’m supposed to just *accept* it? Like I’m some *peasant* in the marketplace, begging for scraps? No! No, Jerry, I fought back. I said, “Oh really? Rules are rules? Then explain *airplane seatbelts.*”

**JERRY**: I would like to hear that explanation.

**GEORGE**: Oh, they *tighten* just enough to make you *think* they’re doing something. But what happens in a crash? You’re still going *down.*

**ELAINE**: Exactly! So I say, “You ever think maybe some rules are *stupid?*” And this guy, he has the *nerve* to say, “Ma’am, it’s just a coupon.”

**JERRY**: (grim) Oh, he called you “ma’am.”

**GEORGE**: That’s the kiss of death.

**ELAINE**: Oh, I saw red. I mean, *steam* coming out of my ears. I tell him, “Fine. You just lost a *valuable* customer.” And then I stormed out, but I realized I forgot my groceries, so I had to storm back *in*, grab them, then storm back out *again.*

**JERRY**: (nodding) That second storm-out always loses impact.

**GEORGE**: So what now? You gonna let this stand?

**ELAINE**: Oh no, no, no. I am going to *war.*

*Kramer bursts in, wildly gesturing with a bundle of dry-cleaning in hand.*

**KRAMER**: It’s happening, boys and girls. The lawsuit is *on.*

1imwg2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/tretinoin/comments/1imwg2p/still_peeling_after_almost_6_years_tret_and/,Still peeling after almost 6 years (Tret and Tazrotene),"Edit: spelling + adding photo

Hi I (30 F), skin type sensitive and combination skin (oily parts dry, but dehydrated at the same time) Have started tretinoin almost 6 years ago when depo provera caused cystic hormonal acne all over my face. I have endometriosis and I now use a Mireena IUD to keep myself sane and periods under control. I have never had serious skin problems until my mid-twenties so of course.. from that point on I kept a strict routine. I also want to add that I'm a healthy active person with a plant based diet for over a decade. I love sugar, but I'm not eating candy every day and I almost always cook my own meals. I almost never drink soda. I mostly drink herbal tea, water, and some coffee. So no sudden changes besides the hormones.

I used 0,025% for 1 year before upping my dose and I made plenty mistakes which made my skin cry (not waiting long enough between applying the buffer and cream/gel.). I've learned a lot and after 3 years I was able to use 0,1% tret a few times a week. But I keep peeling quite often + getting clogged pores on my nose and chin. I try to keep my hands off them, which is hard because I have ADHD. Sometimes I try to extract them which is stupid... I know. Even after extracting the dark filaments/blackheads.. they fill up within 24 hours..

I switched over to Tazarotene gel 0,05% and contrary to some stories I've read.. it **feels** less irritating for me, but I still keep peeling. One notable difference is. Tret made me peel in lots of tiny pieces and Taz makes me peel a bit and once I touch it, I could pull a bigger sheet in one go (what I want to avoid of course..).

My routine:  
Tret > now taz days  
Morning:  
Cleanse with Purito Defence Barrier pH Cleanser (casue I often wake up with a semi-greasy face).  
Soon Jung PH 5.5 Relief Toner and during winter also TIRTIR Milk Skin Toner  
Inkey list caffeine eye cream  
Cetaphil barrier moisturiser (thin layer)  
Cosrs Ultra Light Invisible sunscreen spf 50+

Evening:  
If I wear makeup warm wash cloth to gently remove make-up and after that a cleanse with Purito Defence Barrier pH Cleanser  
Soon Jung PH 5.5 Relief Toner and during winter also TIRTIR Milk Skin Toner  
Cetaphil barrier moisturiser (thin layer)  
Wait a least 15 minutes before applying a little Taz  
During winter when my skin is dry I wait another 15 mins to add another thin layer of cetaphil barrier moisturizer.

Non Tret > now Taz days  
After a tret/taz day I'm having a exoliating day and the day after that I only focus on moisture.  
On my exfoliating day I use Inkey list salicylic acid cleanser and then have the same morning routine since my skin is sensitive.

Evening: same cleansing routine but after cleansing I use Inkey azelaic acid and after a few minutes Isntree - Chestnut BHA 2% Clear Liquid. On bad nose days I use a little bit of Ciracle - Red Spot Cica Sulfur Gel on my nose (but the pores keep filling up.  
After the serums I use Cetaphil barrier moisturiser.

I occasionally do an oil cleanse, but it doesn't help much and not for long.. maybe I'm not doing it often enough

In the first game the karah virus spreading over your character makes you want to cure yourself (and in doing so escape) as soon as possible, however in BZ there really ain’t much stopping you from just chilling out and living your life.

My solution? Alan, yes that little annoying watered down Jhonny Silverhand that resides in that whimsical little noggin of yours. In my opinion (and many others) he is a very cartoony and friendly guy, who is understanding and sometimes even flat out just a good friend to the protagonist. I believe that Alan should have been that pressure to leave, let me explain.

First off he just kinda sounds like a normal ass guy you’d find in a coffee shop. Instead I think he should sound somewhat similar to how the warpers sounded in the first game, speaking in only partially translated sentences and speaking rather robotically and uncaringly. Alan’s motive instead of just hitching a ride in your skull until you make him a new body should be to take over your body, and as the game progresses he is able to speak more clearly and more often, possibly even blinding your for a moment during an “upload” or something. As the karah infected you over time physically in the first game I think you should notice things in your body in an order like this

1. Annoying voice in your head that you cant comprehend 
2. Small wires and dots appearing on hands (and Alan can finally partially speak to you)
3. Wires grow larger and dots begin to glow(Alan can fully form sentences that are understandable and begins questioning what humans are and about things they do)
4. Wires spread across whole body, start to glow green, and fingers turn black like steel( Alan is direct with the main character about how he intends to take over the main characters body in order to destroy the final remnants of the karah virus, he is not apologetic about it but seems to want an understanding to be made before wiping your brain) 
5. Arms and some of rest of body is robotic, main character speaks in a robotic sounding filter. (Alan is on the verge of taking over the players body and will often cause black outs and sudden loss of o2 accidently, however food and water are less needed then before)

By the point of stage 5 the player would have found the solution to getting Alan out of their head, possibly another alien structure or something, but is faced with the choice of letting themselves go but having Alan destroy the virus and go home, or retaking the body and slowing having it revert back to normal, but knowing that the virus will inevitably return and cause havoc on the planet and possibly the rest of the universe.

1imwdwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1imwdwp/has_anyone_else_heard_strange_knocking_patterns/,Has Anyone Else Heard Strange Knocking Patterns in Their Empty Hallway at 2AM?,"The first knock comes at 2:07 AM. Three quick taps, then silence. Di-di-di.  
  
I almost miss it over the hum of my laptop fan and the soft clicks of my mechanical keyboard. The code on my screen—a particularly nasty bug in the authentication module—has kept me up well past any reasonable hour. But those three taps cut through the night, clearly.  
  
I moved into this apartment after quitting my tech company job. Working remotely has made life more fluid, but something feels missing... Even at midnight, coffee remains my only roommate.The cold Americano slides down my throat like liquid metal, hitting my empty stomach with a nauseating splash. I should eat something, but the bug I've been chasing for the past six hours has consumed every ounce of my attention. My head buzzes with that peculiar static that only developers know - the kind that comes from staring at lines of code until they start swimming across your screen like digital serpents. The LED strip behind my monitor bathes everything in an unnatural blue glow, making my skin look corpse-like in its reflection on the dark screen.When I finally force myself to move, my spine protests with a series of sharp cracks that sound disturbingly organic in the dead silence of my apartment. Crack-crack-crack.

Then it comes again. Di-di-di.  
  
The pattern is precise, mechanical almost. Each tap exactly 0.5 seconds apart, by my developer's internal clock. The same clock that helps me debug race conditions and optimize loading sequences.  
  
I minimize my IDE and pull up the building's tenant portal. Third floor, west wing. The renovation notice from management mentioned that the entire floor except my unit would be empty for the next three months. Something about asbestos removal and structural repairs. Perfect for a remote worker who codes better in silence, I'd thought at the time.  
  
Less perfect now.  
  
The knocking changes. Di-di-di... pause... di-di.  
  
My heart rate spikes. I grab my phone and start recording, muscle memory from debugging sessions kicking in. Document everything. Track the pattern. Find the logic.  
  
The building creaks, settling into the night. Through my window, twelve stories of the opposite wing stare back with dark windows. The maintenance guy, mentioned during the walk-through that only 20% of the units are currently occupied. ""Renovation's driving everyone out temporarily,"" he'd said, adjusting his worn baseball cap. ""But hey, quiet's good for some folks.""  
  
Too quiet now.  
  
I check the peephole. The hallway stretches empty in both directions, emergency exit signs casting a dim red glow. Something seems off about the door's surface. I lean closer, squinting through the fish-eye lens.  
  
There are smudges around the peephole's outer rim. Fresh ones.  
  
My hands shake as I open a new browser tab and search: ""pattern knocking night apartment."" The results flood in—mostly ghost stories and urban legends. But one Reddit thread catches my eye: ""Strange knocking patterns in empty buildings - A compilation of cases.""  
  
The top comment makes my blood run cold:  
  
""Security expert here. Be careful with pattern knocks. Some burglars use them to check occupancy. They knock in specific sequences, document response times. If you respond immediately, they know someone's home and awake. No response means either empty or sleeping. They build patterns over days.""  
  
I scroll through more comments, my throat tightening:  
""Had this happen in Chicago. Three quick knocks, then two. Turned out to be guys casing the building.""  
""Check your door frame for tiny marks. They sometimes use UV markers.""  
""If it follows a specific pattern, document everything. Time stamps, sequence variations.""  
  
The knocking returns. Di-di-di... pause... di-di... longer pause... di.  
  
I grab my laptop and retreat to the bedroom, closing and locking the door behind me. The building's Wi-Fi signal shows five other connections active at this hour. Five out of forty-eight units. I pull up the building's floor plans from my lease documents, marking occupied units based on lit windows I've observed.  
  
A pattern emerges. All occupied units are scattered, isolated. Like mine.  
  
My phone buzzes. A notification from the tenant portal:  
""MAINTENANCE NOTICE: Lock mechanism inspection scheduled for all units. Date: Tomorrow, 9 AM - 5 PM.""  
  
The knocking stops. Complete silence follows, somehow worse than the sound. I check the time: 2:09 AM. Exactly two minutes of activity.  
  
I won't sleep tonight. Instead, I open a new document and start logging everything. The knock patterns. The timing. The maintenance notice. The smudges.  
  
Something about this feels orchestrated. Precise. Like a program running its execution cycle.  
  
And I have a terrible feeling this is just the initialization sequence.

1imwdcn,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1imwdcn/thoughts_on_using_hario_drip_assist_strictly_for/,Thoughts on using hario drip assist strictly for bloom?,"I've been preparing V60 almost daily (well two-three times a day) for 6 months now and I simply can't get an even saturation during bloom without moderate to aggressive swirling, but that can still create clumps, dry patches, or stick the coffee to the wall if you swirl too strong to one side and in general it just isn't consistent (for me).

I also have the hario drip assist that I used in the beginning, but I started using it for the bloom phase and it always perfectly saturates the coffee bed, and it seems to produce very balanced cups.

You can see an example of how it works here 2:40-3:00 (I personally use both inner and outer circle during bloom and just do a very short and gently swirl at the end): https://youtu.be/g1aOT5ncFo8?t=163

Basically it creates a shower-head effect and I don't think that can be easily reproduced by hand, but maybe I'm doing something wrong during bloom, what do you think?

After the initial bloom, both Hoffman's and Hendrick recipes seem to work pretty well with this approach as they create more agitation than drip assist ever could.",2,1739272927.0,pourover,2,1.0,False

1imw7aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/bromance/comments/1imw7aa/i_think_my_bro_has_developed_feelings_for_me/,I think my bro has developed feelings for me,"Need some advice on this. Me (32M) and my bro (29M) have been friends for about two years now. We met through work and hit it off instantly. From day one we were really comfortable with each other, even to a point of being (verbally) affectionate towards another. I haven't had this kind of connection in years and I'm really grateful he walked into my life.

Lately though things have been shifting between us. It started when he broke up with his girlfriend a few months ago. He told me how he felt unloved and unseen in his relationship, how she was emotionally unavailable to him and she never reciprocated his need for connection and love. We started spending more time together, had increasingly more deep talks, and became really close emotionally. That's when he started acting differently towards me. He started giving me compliments about my looks, calls me cute nicknames and repeatedly tells me how he'd be all over me if I were a woman. I always thought it was just him being comfortable with his own sexuality and masculinity, but recently it's become too obvious for me to ignore.

Right now we're at a point where even other coworkers began noticing how he acts around me and started making jokes about us ending up together. The thing is, he's being oddly specific when someone makes that joke, saying things like ""if we keep going at this rate it might not even take 5 weeks from now"", like he seems to keep track of something? He even pulled me aside at one point, leaned into me and whispered ""seriously, think about it, you and me, living in a big house, sitting on the porch with a bunch of cats in our laps, sipping some coffee and enjoying life, doesn't that sound nice?"" If he was just joking, he could've said it out loud, but he made sure he pulled me aside in private before he told me that.

Also I noticed how he's comfortable with initiating physical contact and seeking emotional closeness, however when I do it he flinches, backs out and gets distant. Also he won't take any favors from me anymore. Recently I brought him a coffee at work when I went to get one myself and he completely freaked out on me, calling me crazy, I don't have to do this for him, he doesn't wanna owe me anything, insisted on paying me back (we're talking about 50 cents here) and made a huge scene about it. He's just giving me so much mixed signals that it starts to make me question where I stand in this relationship.

Now usually I would just talk to him and address it, but he's still hurting from his breakup and I don't feel like this is the right time to confront him about this. I've never talked to him about his sexuality so I don't know if he might be bisexual or something, I just assumed he was straight since he was with his girlfriend when we met. To me it looks like he might have developed feelings for me that he's not willing to admit at this point, so as long as he's in charge of how close we are he's comfortable with it, but as soon as I take the lead he feels like losing control and backs off.

What do you guys think? Am I drawing the wrong conclusions here or possibly reading too much into this?",5,1739272248.0,bromance,2,1.0,False

After staying away from academia for a little while, I started using Twitter and found lots of very insightful and interesting discussions there around specific scientific papers. What I enjoyed the most was the contrast in opinions among experts. That's a given for AI at this point, but I was also very interested in aging research and, as someone without a proper background in Biology, it was super helpful to cut through the advertised hype and understand the nitty-gritty details and unspoken facts/related data -- Charles Brenner quickly comes to mind, for example.

I do believe that informal settings -- be it online, in places like Twitter, or in real life, such as in chatty coffee breaks -- help people to be more communicative about their beliefs and opinions, culminating in a richer discussion. Besides, the informality and lack of bureaucracy may open the doors for preliminary (counter-)analyses or just bring to life our curious inner child that is not afraid of asking the ""dumb"" questions, which might actually be very relevant to bring up. However, I also understand the double-edge sword that comes with it, as one might sound more confident than they should, based on whatever divergent evidence they might have, or even feel comfortable with just claiming things out of *voices in their heads*. I also believe these settings might be even more inviting to people pushing specific agendas and getting past the actual science and evidence. \[and these pros and cons are just to name a few\]

What do you think? If you believe online discussions are valuable for science, which online community/platform would you recommend? I won't use X, but I'm open to testing Mastodon, Bluesky, or whatever other research-focused platform that people actually use.

If i say that i want to leave the 'trans' identity being forcefully attached to me behind, will i get bashed for not supporting lgbtqprstuvxwyz? What alternatives do i have besides the 'trans' label? Is there no alternative?","From a conceptual point of view, even if you criticize the 'trans' umbrella label, if someone keeps using the 'trans' label, even with a 'sexual' attached to its latter part, the 'TRANS' part sticks out more than the 'ssexual'... What do i mean? 

If we are talking about straight programming behaviorism instead of the cognitive psychology myth (don't know if it's a myth, but i do know cb(p)t might not be safe to take seriously, it seems too tied to the idea of 'hierarchy' considering whom you'll be expected to listen to), everytime someone says 'transsexual', the TRANS part *will* get reinforced, turned into a heavier, more attractive concept. 

Minds work according to reinforcement, any concept that gets mentioned is more likely to reappear in thoughts, because for some strange design decision, minds will go back to use whatever idea a mentioned symbol is attributed to; concepts have gravity and turn heavier everytime they're used, increasing their thought attractiveness, the 'poles' around which thoughts cycle around, like a pinball game. So i don't know, it sounds strange to actually have people who claim to be against the overall lgbtrash bin somewhat reinforcing it on the cover.

To make things worse, i've been thinking my best on how to tackle the trashbin problem... Why are you people using TRANS vocabulary, and turning the TRANS identity stronger while doing so? I mean... Why reinforce the TRANS when we talk about others being hostile? 

Why are we saying they hate a group everytime someone is outright hostile to a single person? I'd rather go around this and say the person is strictly hostile **to me** for what i'm doing, instead of claiming that hostility (it's not even 'fear', why is the crowd actually meshing the word for 'fear' alongside 'hostility'? Transphobia isn't mistransia, both are different terms, why are meanings getting turned into something broader than they are? Are we supposed to think in **less precise** terms, now? Isn't this... Becoming more of a dumb?) to me, it seems more like i'm feeding a 'collective' identity than my **own** identity... Getting one stronger and the other one weaker... Getting my self weaker...

I don't know. It just sounds strange to me for a place where people unfriendly to the trash bin are conditioned to think *exactly* like a trash bin member. Going as far as using the same terms... 

Is this place a trap?

Anyways, i'm questioning things, which, strangely enough in here, will be greeted by the usual barrage of jokes and insults. I don't care if you feel offendend because you're having trouble to understand what i'm writing, go play CoD and feel like superman, oops sorry, i meant superperson, for all i care. Sometimes i feel like there's a few lgbtrash bin people around, trying to mock anyone for thinking even *further* away from their dogma... 

There's a chance this place is actually some sort of 'containment network', even, where people are placed to try to keep them from going further away from the lgbtrash bin and having you repeating the same complaints, but making no new ones, no matter how bad you feel about something? I mean, *how dare you feel something* that only you feel? This is a crime against the ruling collective!!!111!!!!ˋ!!!˜!!!!

Anyways, maybe i'm gauging you. Are you for real? Do you actually recognize that using the same vocabulary as a group you're opposed to sounds strange at the least? 

No need to discuss, but please, **THINK**, deities damn it.

edit: It always takes less than 10 minutes for the downvoting 'let's censor this shit with downvotes and insults!' crowd manipulation squad to show up... Heh, let me drink some coffee, I assume that's as long as it'll take this time as well.

edit2: Just came back with the coffee and lgbtrash bin censorship squad is already in action :D, i've been ""zeroed in"" in less than 10 minutes again.

My ex-girlfriend broke up with me two years ago almost exactly. The relationship lasted for one year, She blindsided me, told me she loved me but was not in love of me out of nowhere, and left. She treated me like she loved me from the beginning ot the end, and she is the one who was asking me to tell her how i love her because i was not very expressive for the first few months, although i told her when i felt like so and she was happy, she also was the one who convinced me that i needed to move with her to another city the next year because she was gonna move there and i quote ""i don't want to lose you because i love you so much"". Fair. Although i guess the last ten days i had felt something weird but nothing alarming or at least not to the extent that she was gonna leave me, i thought she was stressed and that was it. I was devastated, i didn't plead or beg but i suggested that we could see each other less frequently in order to reignite whatever it is that was there because i loved her. She started crying and told me she almost made a huge mistake, we cuddled, but 30 min later she said that she in fact decided to leave, so she left. I had told her that i was not gonna contact her but if she wanted to contact me, she was free to do so.

  
I texted her two months later asking for a coffee date, she declined and sent me a screenshot of the two texts we exchanged  (weird, i thought at the time that she wanted to send the screenshot to a friend of her or maybe another dude to show him that her ex contacted her... i did not answer and left her on read, probably a mistake from her part...)

  
i never contacted her again, and she never contacted me again, which hurts even more. How can you jsut dump soembody you spent one entire year with, convinced that you love him o the extent he sacrificed some of his own goals, and then proceeded ot dump him like a piece of shit and never look back ? It 's crazy. I didn't go in to all the details because want you to stay focused and interested while reading this, but i thought about her and all the memories of her breaking up with me and what i've done to deserve that every day since then. Every day. I felt anger every day, sadness other days. It did not matter if i met an objectively more amazing woman, or if i succeeded in any of my endeavors, i thought about her and was sad or angry, more angry than sad to be honest most of the time. So angry that my face , i'm frowning all the time now. People who have not seen me since before i was with her told me i looked way more mature now and cold. I do not care anymore about what anybody thinks because i feel deep inside that she actually left me because she thought i was ""too nice"" which i was with her but only because she was with me and not because i wanted to gain anything from her ?  Anyway, that's just a feeling i had but i might be wrong...

  
Meanwhile, i met a lot of women with whom i had amazing sex and even more good things. I traveled a lot, i started my own company, i made more money than i had ever made before. I'm a gym guy, and i'm closer to my final form than i've ever been.I met amazing people, i started going out of my comfort zone, i gained so much confidence in my self, i introspected and gained a lot of emotional intelligence, i feel like i'm closer to the man i always wanted to be than i have ever been. THis trauma changed my brain structure i believe, it is crazy. I was so afraid of public speaking before, it was my number one fear. I do not care the slightest anymore, i can talk for hours in front of thousands of people. I was so afraid of first dates also, or to show my sexual interest in a blatant way, i am not anymore. It's like a switch flipped and now i am my real self.

  
However, a few weeks back, i starting thinking about her again but a lot more than like i did every day since two years. I had thought i was maybe not over her but at least somewhat to he extent i never would think about contacting her again ever. But I thought about her so much that i stalked her on the internet (she does not have any social media, we only texted at the time and she's completely out of the internet) and i found her profile on linkedin. I got her email and since then i' have been thinking to email her everything i have been thinking and feeling in detail. I feel like i can''t just keep all of this to myself anymore. I feel that it's not fair that i never got the time to first process my emotions and then tell her everything, whereas  she manipulated me while she was with me to deal with the break up ( she told me so) and then just left. I understand that everybody advises not to seek for closure within the other person, but only within one self, but deep inside my heart doesn't feel the same. 



I was driving to work from home a few hours ago, it's a 30 minutes drive. I broke down and started crying for thirty minutes out of nowhere. For the whole thirty minutes like she just had broken up with me, for no reason although i had been feeling down because of what i told you right before these pas few days. I have no reason to cry other than this in my personal life, i'm in good shape and have everything i wish for. I decided to type this as soon as i reached the office. As i type this, i can feel anger, because the main theme that haunts me is her thinking i'm some sort of ""nice guy"" whose love i showed her was a sign of weakness out of not wanting her to leave me, which it was not even though at the time i did feel lonely because of some external circumstances that i had in my life and that had nothing to do with her, and i saw her multiple times a week for emotional support, but i never was clingy or anything like that. I just told her once that i didn't want to lose her over a petty argument we had that was of no significance objectively, two weeks later she was gone. I don't want to get into more details because this text is getting too long and i want your answers and your rational advice so i'm gonna stop here and if you want more details , just let me know.

  
IN summary, the relationship was nothing short of excellent, she blindsided me two years ago, i never stopped thinking about it every day since then, tomorrow is her 25th birthday and I'm contemplating writing her an email where i tell her everything i feel, that i actually love her and that i do not care if it inflates her ego or not, that, that is what i feel and i'm doing it for myself,  that i do want to see her, hug her and kiss her and that is what i have been feeling and that i'm ready to do so even if she's more or less far from where i live (i don't know where she might be but probably 200km away at most). I want to let her know that i did everything in my power to be the man i always wanted to be, that even though she didn't see the value in me at the time, i did see it in her and that i think it's a ""right person, wrong time"" moment, and that after a lot of self-reflection i think i genuinely love her as a human being and want to see her before i die. I don't want to die before seeing her again.

  
Do you think i am crazy ? DO you think i am being emotional ? i don't agree with the general advice that ""she's an ex for a reason"". I really don't as i saw with my eyes that some people just drift apart and then reunite years later and live happily ever after or at least, don't hold grudges and stay friends and make genuine human connections. I'm surrounded by very ambitious and proud people who  are not toxic by any means but very self-centered and have a big opinion of themselves and they all advised me against what i want to do. But their only reason is always ""you're gonna inflate her ego, she's likely to be very flattered that you still think about her and that she left this much of a huge impact on you and she won't respond or respond in a cold manner that will leave you absolutely shattered into pieces"". I understand where this reasoning comes from but... so what ? I don't care. I'm doing it for me. I genuinely know my value. I know where i stand. I know i do not need her. I accomplished many things in life and i'm gonna keep doing so until the day i die. I do not really care if she thinks I'm weak because it's actually what's been hurting me since the breakup, so it is not gonna change anything, however, i can see now that i am not and that her opinion of me is not who i am, so i do not care. i do however care about this human, it's the truth,  why lie to myself ? I do love this person and feel this innate desire to hug her and tell her that everything is gonna be ok, and make her feel safe, secure and loved the same way she made me feel when we were together. What's wrong with me feeling this and expressing this even if she does not feel the same way if i send the email ? I feel like even if she never answers or answers and tells me that she does not love me at all and that the past is the past, or that she has another man in her life, i would feel relieved. Maybe i'm wrong ? I don't know, i'm lost. I'm sad, i am angry and at the same time i want to tell her i love her. What do i do ?

  
I understand that i'm currently very emotional and i need you to put some rationality in me, please. Thank you ! Sorry, english is not my first language

1) turns out I have to do daily weigh ins, after speaking to my Type 1 specialist she was concerned that I would do big drops in weight at once and that can mess with my insulin requirements so I did have to start daily weigh ins again

2) I did trip up once and have an iced coffee however I left myself off the hook because I had 2 in once month...compared to every second day and sometimes 2 in one day so that's a massive improvement 

3) the specialist was right all month of January I was 110...literally until Feb 2 when I dropped to 109...and then today I dropped to 108 so so far 2kg lost...my first goal is 100 so 8kg left..

4) My 6 month old had a tough month with teething so I haven't been able to do 20mins a night on the cross trainer but my food has stayed on point which I think is why I lost weight 

My goals for February is to try and hop back on the cross trainer at least 2 nights a week and work from there.

I am happy with the weight loss I have been able to drop my nightime insulin by 8 units so that makes me feel good and in general I have been feeling good.

I know its a slow burn but I also know if it comes off slowly I have more chance of keeping it off because I have changed my lifestyle. 

This year I would love to lose 10kg in total my ultimate goal would be 70kg (I am short 😅) 

But again if I can start next year Less then this year and keep it off for...that will make me happy",2,1739271281.0,loseit,1,0.75,False

It’s the ones that tell a story. And honestly, it’s so easy to do.

Something as simple as using the right photos or videos can change how your store *feels*. Not just product pics, but ones that actually set a vibe.

Some easy ways to do this:

* **Set the Scene** – Don’t just show the product, show the *lifestyle*.
   * Cozy home goods? Warm lighting and inviting spaces
   * Fitness products? Show it in action. A scenic run, or whatever fits.
* **Make It Feel Real** – Products in context just hit differently.
   * A coffee mug on a cozy morning table.
   * A candle flickering in a dimly lit room. You get the idea.
* **Use Video (Even Short Clips)** – It doesn’t have to be fancy.
   * A quick clip of the product in use > a boring still image.
   * A simple montage on your homepage can set the whole mood. I once saw this store selling racing tickets, and they had this great fast-paced montage of past events. Their homepage was super simple, like three sections total, and that video took up almost half of it. But it was great!

Hey! I want to send this short story to a very big writing competition in my country, and it would really help me if anyone has some time to beta-read it:) It's a sincere low fantasy take on life in the shadows of war, with a focus on personal relationships good amount of comedy and dark humor thrown in (dramedy? Maybe? Idk). It takes place in different points in time throughout Israeli history.

It was originally written in Hebrew, but I have translated it to English so it would be easier to get beta reader😅

*more about the story:*

Anat is twenty, or eighteen- sometimes she even gets to grow older. She's a soldier, she has been for a while, the wars keep catching up to her. Maybe it's a curse, Yoni thinks saying it is, but life is always waiting between the wars, and life, she thinks, is worth it. 

""The weather was unusually nice for the season.
Anat spreaded a tablecloth on the coffee table in the living room. She brought it from her parents' house, it was solid wood, a piece of woodwork from the time when there were still carpenters - and it took her years to realize that she needed coasters.
Jonathan called at six twenty-five to ask her to open the gate to the moshav.
At six twenty-six he called to ask her to explain to him again how to get to her house.
Jonathan's new electric car looked a little funny next to Anat's Carmel Duke. Jonathan looked a little funny when he got out of the car with flowers.""  
          
CW: death, talk of war. This story anti war and pro peace, but it’s not really biting political commentary. The focus is on the experiences of veterans- if that's not a prospective you think you’d like reading about that totally understandable, but skip this story 
      
*In addition to general feedback about the quality of the story I would love it if you could look out for some things I'm specifically worried about:*

 * While I've written short stories before, my last, biggest, and only professional writing project was a play I worked on for two years, and I'm afraid it shows, but I'm not sure how to fix it. 

 * There is a portion of the story with two paragraphs colored green and red, I'm not sure which of them works best and I would like to hear your opinion. 

 * the story is non chronological, and unclear on purpose, is that too confusing making the reading experience worse? Do you think having the portions set in the past in italics would help?

 * do you think the way the characters act is consistent?

*disclaimer* this story is a translation, so I'm not interested in comments on word choice or sentence structure, since it'll be sent to the competition in the original language. If there are any mistranslations or misspellings left I apologize:)

 
I'm available for critique swap for a short story or chapter of similar length to mine, and would love to hear back from you within a week or two, even if it's just ""sorry I'll be back to you in (X time)""

1imvncb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1imvncb/too_many_good_options_and_cant_make_a_choice/,Too many good options and can’t make a choice.,"In 2023 I was offered a six figure marketing job after years of unemployment and they ended up withdrawing it because I couldn’t decide whether or not to take it (I took too long to answer them). It was a hard decision since I was living in Europe at the time and it would require a move back to the US. 

I’ve spent the last year and a half regretting that non-decision. Regretting my non-choice. I’m always in between apartments, don’t have enough money, and I could have fixed it. I’m an artist. I’ve been so for ten years but I’ve had mixed success — more then some and less than others. I keep telling myself I want to work full time in another field but when the options come up, I can’t decide. I spent hours in bars and cafes drinking water or coffee trying to decide leading up to the withdrawal, doing the I-Ching, making endless lists and word clouds and I just didn’t act. My friend put me forward for the job and she was penalized because I ghosted— which felt horrible because she has a young child. 

Now I’m facing another crossroads. I accepted a five month artist residency in another city with a pretty generous stipend and free room and board. I was very hesitant to accept it because it would invalidate other options, and would only be a temporary fix: afterwards, I will be back to dealing with the same issue of not having enough money and not having a stable apartment.

However I kept applying for jobs and one has come back with the possibility to be hired. But it’s 4 hours by train away from the residency. Another job has been offered too, but it’s full time and conflicts with the residency and will be rewarding — working on a book — but stressful. 

Anyone have tips for dealing with this? I can’t face making no decision again but I’ve already begun procrastinating.",3,1739269983.0,ADHD,5,1.0,False

•Palworld
•Borderlands 3
