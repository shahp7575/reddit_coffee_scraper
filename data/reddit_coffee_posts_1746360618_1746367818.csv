Had a good legs day yesterday and went out on foot with my partner in her powerchair and my ADIT. He wasn’t wearing a vest or any identifying gear because we were just going for a decompression sniff and maybe a coffee at a dog-friendly local cafe. Ended up popping into Tescos and, more than halfway round the shop with no issues, a staff member comes over and asks “is he a guide dog…?” I said “uh, assistance dog” and pointed at my partner (figured the electric wheelchair would make them go away faster since I don’t “look disabled” all the time) and she went “oh okay” and let us be. So, no actual problem, but the assumption surprised me since he wasn’t wearing a harness/handle or helping me navigate/find stuff. Does anyone else get this assumption with their dogs?

1kekmmi,https://www.reddit.com/r/revengestories/comments/1kekmmi/help_me_get_revenge_on_my_partner_for_drinking/,Help me get revenge on my partner for drinking this specific coffee.,"My partner and I love coffee. We are also broke. We buy the big plastic tubs of cheapo coffee from big box stores, and that's what we have every morning. Sometimes we add cinnamon or pumpkin spice to improve the taste. 

My parents, who live nearby, are coffee snobs. The only coffee they'll drink is a specific blend (Guatemalan, let's say) from a high-end local roaster. We checked their website recently, thinking we might get some of their coffee as a treat. They had all sorts of interesting blends, but even the small bags were out of our budget, so we decided not to get anything. I'll specify that my partner was especially interested in trying their Kenyan blend, and I was really keen on a rich dark roast that's named after our village, which, in turn, is named after a local revolutionary hero (so cool!).

Fast-forward to two weeks ago, and I'm diagnosed with an ulcer and told to avoid coffee, among other things, for the next three months while I'm on medication. It sucks, but I buy this roasted chicory stuff that's actually not half bad (though it's clearly not coffee), and I drink that every morning while continuing to make my partner his coffee every weekday before work. He works long days, and I'm currently looking for work, so despite the fact I can't currently have coffee, it just seems fair to me to keep helping him out by doing stuff like that.

Now, fast-forward to earlier this week. My partner is a volunteer firefighter, and he comes home from the station one night with a little bag of goodies from the new mayor, who gave them out to all the firemen: a bunch of locally-made sweets, a mug, and, wouldn't you know it, a small bag of coffee from the pricey local roaster - the blend *I* wanted to try, the one named after our village. 

I was so excited to see it, I was basically hopping around the kitchen before tucking it away in the pantry. I know I should have said this aloud, and the blame lies on me for not doing so, but I figured one of two things would happen with this coffee: either 1) my partner would wait until I could drink coffee again to try it with me, or, more likely, 2) my partner would want to try it sooner than 2.5 months from now, which is perfectly understandable, but he would, at the very least, let me know he was going to try it, and I would have an itty bitty sip from his mug so that we could discover it together. I've been good about following the doctor's dietary recommendations, but I would have made an exception for just a sip of this coffee. I LOVE discovering new foods and drinks, especially together, and my partner knows that. 

Anyhow - fast foward, once again, to Friday night, when we always do our big grocery run. I tell my partner we're almost out of our big ol' tub o' cheap coffee, and we buy more, but from a different brand this time that was on sale.

The next morning is Saturday, yesterday, and my partner has extra training at the fire hall. He gets up a few minutes before I do, and makes one cup of coffee for himself. He neglects to make me anything at all, which has happened many times before, but it still makes me sad, and we bicker about it, and then he leaves for training and I get on with my day.

When he comes home from training, in the evening, I ask him if he had the new brand of cheap coffee, and how was it, and that's when it happens - he says no, he had the fancy blend from the local roaster that I was really interested in.

""Are you serious? Without me? And you didn't even tell me?! I would have had a sip, so we could try it together..."" He says he never even thought about it - I was in the washroom, and he wanted coffee, and it was there, and he made a cup and found it average and didn't think to say anything about it at all.

I won't lie, we had a blowout fight. I likened this to his habit of giving our cat new toys when I'm not in the room, which means I always miss seeing our cat's initial reaction, which is (in my opinion) the best part. I told him he was selfish and thoughtless and inconsiderate. I cried a lot. He didn't seem to understand at first, telling me it's not like he would have had the entire bag of coffee without me, and that he would have left some for me to try later - which really isn't the point. I think I got through to him by explaining that it was a bit like if I watched the finale of a show we've been watching together on my own - he could always watch it by himself later, but it wouldn't be nearly as fun as watching it together and reacting to it together in real-time. 

So, I told him he could make his own damn coffee this week. But I can't think of anything that would hurt his feelings the way he hurt mine, by having this specific coffee for the first time without me. There's nothing he can't eat, and nothing I can think of that he currently really wants to try. I'm terrible at petty revenge, so I'm really hoping someone out there has a clever idea.

In any case, it was nice to vent a bit. Thanks for reading and let me know if you have any tips.

1kekml2,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatdoIdo/comments/1kekml2/i_walked_away_after_my_partners_female_work/,I Walked Away After My Partner’s Female Work Friend Repeatedly Crossed Boundaries Despite Apologies,"I [31F] was in a relationship where my partner [31M] had a close female work friend [30F] who constantly made me uncomfortable with the way she interacted with him. She would send him selfies, spend time alone with him at odd hours (including midnight spa session, midnight coffee session), and often gave overly familiar hugs when they’re tipsy.

When I brought up my concerns, both to her and to my partner, she explained that she only saw him as a “brother” and that there was nothing to worry about. She apologized and said she would change — that she’d keep their conversations work-related and be more mindful of boundaries moving forward.

I chose to give them both the benefit of the doubt and waited, giving it three months to see if the situation would improve. But nothing really changed. She continued to message him about personal matters and kept inserting herself into his life in ways that felt intrusive. Even after she said she understood how I felt, her actions kept showing the opposite. When I tried to bring it up again, she dismissed my feelings by telling me I was just overthinking — even though I had clearly expressed my discomfort and had tried to be understanding.

At some point, I had to ask myself: in what way was I not clear? How many times do I have to express the same boundary for it to be respected? Her apologies lost meaning when her actions never followed through.

Eventually, I realized my peace was more important than staying in a relationship where my feelings were invalidated and my boundaries were repeatedly crossed. So I chose to walk away.

If you were in my position — watching someone repeatedly disrespect your boundaries and dismiss your concerns as “overthinking” — how would you feel? What would you have done?",1,1746367616.0,whatdoIdo,0,1.0,False

I'm socially awkward, and altogether quite a ways from any kind of normal. I also find myself at a new low point in my life. all that kinda inhibits making friends.

I'm afraid I've never had much interest in computer games, anime, or comic books. also not a sports fan.

1kekmjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/WLW_PH/comments/1kekmjh/is_she_into_me_or_not/,Is she into me or not?,"Nung 3 weeks ago, Collegian week namin. She already graduated sa school namin and is working na. I've had a huge crush sa kanya dati pa nung freshmen year ako, tamang pa admire² lang sa kanya. 2nd year ata siya before or 3rd year. Masc po siya, ako naman fem talaga na mukhang straight. Inadd ko siya before sa facebook at mutuals kami ever since, matagal na yun pero I dont think she knows me na if I exist of wala pero before my girlfriend siya. Pero ngayon, single na siya since last year and I followed her na sa ig around April and mutuals kaming dalawa.

During College week, which was 3 weeks ago she was there sa school, and there was that day na we started to do eye contact, second day siya ng college week namin. The longest was 5 seconds, the next day, we did eye contact again but I always pull away kasi sa anxiety ko. It was Tuesday when we have 3 different encounters. 


Yung first, Nasa isang  stall ako, trying out rings to figure out my ring size with my friend, until my friend mentions na papunta siya sa direksyon namin and nakita ko siya from afar so I look up to confirm and naka tinginan kami talaga, then I looked away naman tapos nung lumakad siya behind samin, nagstopped by siya sa stall where I was and my friend, tapos nagsabi lang randomly ""Ang astig ng watch oh."" (the watch was nothing special and ordinary tingnan yung design, casio lang siya, wala ako problem don) pero apaka random kasi out of blue na bigla siya nagsalita ng ganyan. Ginesture niya yung watch sabay tingin sakin tas nag-tawa siya with her kasama tas umalis.

The second encounter was me and my friend was standing by near the coffee stall kung saan siya nakatambay by kasi friend niya or kakilala niya yung owner ng coffee stall kasi ginagawa pa siyang model eh. So while standing by, pumunta siya sa likod namin ng friend ko a few feets away ata, yung friend ko nanotice niya pa while I was focused during the car show, so my friend mentioned, she keeps pointing or signalling my direction sa kakilala niya na nakatambay din sa coffee stall and I also felt shivers like someone was staring or looking at my back, not to mention I was wearing a backless top. Then bigla na lang siya tumakbo sa gilid ko at nagulat ako don sabay bumalik sa coffee stall.

The third encounter same day, nung hinatid ko friend ko sa gate para makasakay ng jeep, tas timing, pabalik nako sa entrance ng school na bigla siya lumabas dala ang kanyang motor and nagtitigan kami, and nahuli ko siya pero nagpulled away because of my anxiety acting up. 

Wednesday ng college week, pumunta ako sa school ng mag-isa tas ayon, our paths crossed again, we did eye contacts, there was this time when we literally just walked by in front of one another and we were quite close when we did the eye contact and it was intense but sadly I break the contact because I hate my anxiety. 

There's also this day when she slide into my dms on ig but just to ask about the winner of the battle of the bands because I was there to that day too and we did eye contact. So i replied then yeah she replies bragging her previous major (radtech) and saud thank you to me then I replied welcome with hahaha then she last chatted me by reacting heart to my message. Na wonder ako if first move niya na ba yun or sadyang nagtanong lang talaga siya sakin....

It made me sad, wishing she could add more to the convo. And also I noticed na medjo famous siya here in our school and has lots of followers, and madami talaga siyang kilala sa school too but why did she bothered asking me about sa winner when madami siyang kilala tas madami din siyang close friends that goes to same school as mine na pwede naman tanungin kung sino winner instead of me knowing I'm just a complete stranger to her. 

The next days of the collegian week we always did eye contact and not to mention even though she's working now, we always crossed paths every week after ng college week atleast for once or twice coincidentally and doing eye contact and I know she already recognize me na that includes my face and name now knowing we've been mutuals now and I've been sending her signals on ig by liking stories, posting songs on my note but never replying to her stories because of anxiety again. 

Not to mention, she's been liking my stories not always but frequently whether it is my face, about school, and even the useless stuffs, she likes my stories. She's the first viewer and liker always when it comes to my stories and same as me to her. I added her to my close friends list and also her adding me too, to her close friend list. 

The last time I saw her we eye contact again but this time I smiled at her then she was already looking at me while I was about to walk pass to her and then she gave me a nod but not a normal nod but rather a slightly swag nod then I look away smiling, failing to keep my composure. 

I was with my friend to who had witnessed it and of course we've laugh.....but seriously I don't know what to do anymore. She's still there everywhere. I haven't seen her this week too so...... I am seriously losing my mind over her.

Ps. Sorry na lang sa grammar ko, kinopy ko lang din yung post ko nato sa ibang group din... help me po.",1,1746367613.0,WLW_PH,1,1.0,False
1kekmfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1kekmfu/i_just_need_to_get_it_off_my_head/,I just need to get it off my head,"I'm not sure if expressing this will help me, but I feel the need to talk about something that’s been on my mind since it happened. Maybe putting it into words will help me sort through my thoughts.

I'm 20 years old and had never been with anyone before—not even kissed—until two months ago. That reality was deeply affecting me, even leading to depression. Then, I met her at a party where we spent the whole night together. I didn’t remember her name, so I reached out to a college dating page on Instagram, hoping to find out who she was. She replied, and from that moment, we started texting constantly—literally at all hours.

The day after we first chatted, she gave me her phone number. It all felt surreal, like a dream. A week later, we had our first date, and it was magical. I couldn’t believe my first kiss would happen in front of my favorite artwork, at my favorite museum. That was the moment I realized what it meant to fall truly in love.

We began dating, though not in a fully committed way. She told me her previous relationship had been painful and that she needed time to heal before being ready to commit again. But I never felt like she wasn’t trying—on the contrary, she gave so much of herself to be with me. Despite her busy schedule (studying for college, teaching math and volleyball to little kids and training with a local team), she was always there when I needed her. And I, in turn, did everything I could to make her feel safe and supported. I wanted her to feel loved, not pressured. Even when I noticed signs that she still missed her ex—like the fact that she continued following him on social media or posting things that clearly seemed aimed at him—I chose to overlook them. I told myself that what mattered was the bond we were building, and I stayed focused on showing her how deeply I cared. She would introduce me to everyone as her boyfriend, and I did the same with her, even though she had told me she wasn’t ready for something serious. The truth is, we acted exactly like a real couple—meeting each other's families, sharing routines, supporting each other—everything felt real. The only difference was that we never explicitly used the words “my boyfriend” or “my girlfriend” between us. Though we had a few minor misunderstandings, they never grew into anything serious—we were genuinely happy. I truly felt I was living one of the best moments of my life. But as quickly as it began, it all came to an end.

Finals week was approaching, and I had little time to spend with her. Still, we managed to see each other that Friday like usual. It was the most beautiful day of my life. Every time I looked into her eyes, I felt like I’d finally found real happiness after a long time of struggling. That night, we talked about how deeply in love we were. I didn’t know it would be the last time I’d see her in person.

We agreed not to meet again until Monday—she had plans with friends and I needed to study. But she was constantly on my mind. The first sign something was off came when she didn’t say goodnight on Sunday. I didn’t think much of it. The next day, she took two hours to reply to my message. I asked her if something was wrong, and she said we needed to talk. I spent the rest of the day filled with anxiety, wondering what I had done. We didn’t speak until Tuesday night, when I finally had a short break from studying. That call was the most painful of my life. She told me she couldn’t stop thinking about her ex, even while she was with me, and that she wasn’t ready for a relationship.

I felt crushed. Not only was the person I cared about most telling me something I hadn’t expected, but everything had seemed perfectly fine just days before. Maybe I was too blind to see it coming. I couldn’t understand how things could shift so suddenly, without warning. The way she expressed herself made me feel like I had been used as some kind of emotional support, and like every “I love you” she had said wasn’t real. Still, I gathered the strength to suggest breaking up, even though what I really wanted was to ask her to take her time and maybe try again in the future. I was—and still am—very much in love with her. That moment marked the beginning of one of the lowest points in my life.

A week later, I reached out saying I wanted us to be on good terms and stay in touch. She agreed, thanked me for everything, but our conversations felt different, distant. A few days after, she reposted some sad TikToks—one of which I thought might be about me. I texted her and asked if she wanted to talk, but she said it wasn’t directed at me. I used the opportunity to invite her for coffee the next weekend, and she accepted. I was thrilled—it was the week of Sant Jordi, a Spanish celebration I’d always dreamed of spending with someone I loved. I wrote her a letter, thinking I would hand it to her in person and tell her how I felt, but in the end, the meeting never happened. I couldn’t bear the thought of keeping all those feelings to myself, so I decided to leave the letter in her mailbox, along with some of her favorite flowers.

She messaged me later saying the letter made her cry, that she was grateful for everything, but also sorry that she couldn’t give me what I wanted. She said she wanted to see me when we both had time, but now, more than a week and a few vague messages later, she seems to be avoiding me.

I don’t know what to do anymore. She’s one of the most incredible people I’ve ever met, and I love her deeply, but I feel stuck in something that might never work. She hasn’t removed me from social media—not even from her private or close friends list—and still occasionally likes my stories, yet meeting again seems impossible.

No matter how hard I try, I can’t get her out of my head. Every moment I lived with her replays in my mind like fleeting shooting stars—beautiful, brief, and now wrapped in a haze of pain and nostalgia. It’s starting to affect me in deeper ways: I’m having trouble sleeping, I can’t concentrate, and I’ve lost interest in the things that used to bring me joy. I’ve tried everything—meeting up with friends, spending more time with my family, even joining the gym and throwing myself into any distraction that might keep my mind busy—but nothing seems to work. It all feels meaningless without her.

I don’t know who will end up reading this, and I’m sorry for writing something so long, but it was something I needed to let out. And if, by any chance, someone does read it, I would really appreciate any advice you might have. I do believe better days will come—not just for me, but for anyone going through something similar. Still, for now, the weight of it all feels overwhelming… at least for me.",1,1746367605.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False
1keklwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1keklwr/i_dont_enjoy_the_day_to_day_of_parenting_cause_of/,I don’t enjoy the day to day of parenting cause of my anxiety,"I will start by saying that I OBVIOUSLY don’t regret my kids (ages almost 4 and 7 months) AT ALL, I love them soo much BUT I feel like doing the day to day part of having kids makes me MISERABLE to be honest. I do not enjoy life right now. I am ALWAYS in a bad mood. I literally cannot help it. I have bad anxiety, mood swings and am constantly snapping. 

I use to be on lexapro for anxiety but I stopped. I don’t feel like taking a pill for the rest of my life is the answer. Would love to find more hollistic route but idk what that is and anything I’ve tried for relaxation like CBD puts me to sleep cause of my severe fatigue issues. Or I’ve tried mood supplements but i don’t really feel like they work long term. I have always had horrible fatigue issues which I do feel plays a huge roll cause I am legit ALWAYS tired. I get 7 hours of sleep a night but truly need like 9 to functions.  Husband lets me nap whenever I want on weekends but sometimes I feel like it takes away from the free time I want/have. Or puts me behind with housework. It’s like I cannot have kids, the free time I want, the sleep I want AND a clean house 😂

(husband always wants me to not care with housework or I find people say it’s fine, it’s the season of life and to accept it but I CANNOT. I can not live in a mess. I want things tidy. Because of this I def do waaaay more housework than him or in turn my husband does more childcare than me while I do said housework lol or well at least after work in the evenings. he can live in mess way more than me, whereas I lose my mind)

I can’t really get more night sleep (without napping) because my baby goes to bed at 7:30pm and toddler goes to bed at 9:30pm but won’t stay in her room unless I lay with her so I’m not going to bed until after 10pm most nights and then I’m waking around 5:30am (6am on weekends). Baby wakes between 6-6:30am. Husband he’s great but his one flaw (lmao) is that he does not wake up early EVER. I do mornings myself during the week and weekends. It’s more work for me to try to get him up than it is to just handle mornings myself. He repays me by getting the kids after work and lets me go to the gym after work so i usually am not getting home until 5:45/6pm. Then It doesn’t bother me on weekends cause once he’s up he gets me coffee and/or lets me nap. But yeah the guy just physically cannot wake up. lol anyways like i truly don’t know a solution because I feel like if i complain people just tell me oh get a sitter and have some time out. BUT we do. I do. I get plenty of time IF I want it. I have Momco meetings twice a month. I get dinner with friends maybe like 4 times a month. I get pedicures once a month alone. I have Fridays off work when kids are at daycare so that day is mine granted usually end up cleaning, running house errands doing appts for our pets. But i still get a little me time. So that’s not really the issues. It’s just the time with my kids where i have all the other house tasks or getting ready for work or laundry ALL THE THINGS on my mind that i have to do that i cannot enjoy myself with my kids cause im thinking about all the tasks that i need to do. Then if the kids are going off i lose it. I get very overly stimulated easy and hate loud noises so when my toddler is going off i literally freak out. Not proud of it but i cannot control my reactions and end up snapping. 

I get so upset with myself being this way because idk how to change it. It’s like an issue with me, my brain, my anxiety that I cannot just chill out!!!! My favorite time of my life is being at work honestly because I can sit at my desk in silence and listen to my podcasts. The second I get home i think about everything i have to get done for the next day.

Anyone else like this? Solutions? Advice? Part of me is like ok well at least they will get older and it will be easier but then the other half of me is like do I just keep hating my life until then? Because that kinda sucks too!!

Okay listen up, specially freshies, but these places are going to be your main interests when it comes to food in the main campus and the area surrounding it. These are the places **I remember** but they are certainly not complete and I encourage other older students or alumnis to input more. I will be going over the more interesting places and give them in detail.

**Fast Food:** no surprises here, you got McDo near UB or Centermall (access via Hospital Gate), Jollibee in front (Front Gate) and Mang Inasal and Chowking in Centermall too. These places are pretty self explanatory and needs no further introductions. 

**SLU Canteen:** bring your own tumbler, **water is free.** There is an in campus water refilling station. The karinderya in the canteen has a price totaling less than Php 100 and you can ask for the second rice for free (they don't tell you this lol).

**UB Canteen:** yes, you can actually enter UB's canteen. Access via Hospital Gate, you just have to leave a collateral kay kuya guard **like your School ID** when entering the building. Note, makikipag siksikan ka sa UB students but admittedly mas colorful ang selection doon compared sa canteen ng SLU.

**UB ""Kubu"":** enclosed courtyard full of karinderya sellers, you'll get cheap meals here. Fair warning, sanitation is questionable, only recommended for those **with iron stomachs.** Cheap colored drinks though, I usually buy iced tea here on my way to school.

**Gate 4 Food Places:** too many to list, just go out from SLU Gate 4 and see them all there. Most of them are solid, and should definitely be tried once in your univ life, maybe you'll like them.

**Manok ni Kuya Xy:** singled out because it is arguably the **best fried chicken place** in the area. Cramped space though, so I suggest to take out food from there and go eat somewhere, like the nearby 7/11.

**Good Taste Centermall:** ah yes, you can't say you've visited Baguio without eating in one of these bad boys. Cheap prices when compared to the servings, always expect to **over order** because you will not anticipate how much serving they will be giving you. Food ranges from amazing to mid though.

**Soledad's Eatery:** more expensive than normal karinderya's but for a good reason. This is the eatery that **CE professors** usually patronize (or atleast the ones I know of lol).

**Ali's House of Shawarma:** authentic cuisine, as far as I can tell lmao. Stand out is there **Plate Beef Shawarma Rice** and **Samosa,** I always end up ordering both.

**Betolanyo's Food House:** a very old karinderya here, pretty sure some Alumni's remember this place. The food here are extremely good, I recommend you give them a try.

**Food Alley:** may **Turks** din sa baba neto, but more of yung second floor karinderya pinuntirya ko dto haha. An option if naumay kana sa mga putahe sa canteen or other karinderyas.

**Don Machiattos:** noong time ko, **Php 39 for an Iced Coffee** siya. Imagine the appeal of that to a broke caffeine starved student's mind lol. Their flavors taste great for the price too.

**Samgyup 199:** dto kami nagcecelebrate dati pagkatapos ng exams haha, one of the **cheapest samgyup** places in the city, so don't expect luxury. You get your standard samg set though.

**Laxamana's Diner:** oldie din ito haha, pero i think medjo nagdrop na yung quality nya in recent years. Be warned, gaya ng Kubu, medyo questionable na hygiene nila dto so proceed with caution.

**Granny's Kitchen:** malayo ito sa SLU haha, but I'll list it here because of personal reasons. Their **Lechon Kawali Kare Kare** is a top notch order, so look out for that. Meron din pala mumurahing karinderya sa tabi neto', around Php 60 for the cheapest meal.

**Cafe's:** **The Hub** and **But First, Coffee** are the nearest cafe's I've tried (there are closer ones but I can't recc them because I have not tried them). Use them for your high end school group meetup but please, don't use them to make your research on, we have our library for that.

**Notredame Cafeteria:** kinda far from SLU, but there is a notable **Korean Food Stall** here I am fond of eating from. You can also get your groceries in the nearby **Tiongsan** if you need to buy something for home or school.",3,1746367488.0,SLUBaguio,0,1.0,False

Enjoying a nice iced coffee on the local patio and had a query that the community could maybe help in.

I had a 1/2 punch that heavily increased my Starbucks usage this year. First, I moved in January, and my route to work puts me right in front of a Starbucks every day, even when my route changes. Then, I went to Disney World at the end of February and got a really cool reusable Starbucks tumbler. I started placing mobile orders with personal cups, and I had no idea you got 25 stars every time you used one. I also use my gold card, of which I still have the physical one I got at 14 (they ran a buy 1 drink, get 300 stars promo. Totally worth the 7:00 PM caffeine rush.) I’m sitting on 500+ stars that won’t expire until October at the earliest.

Here’s where all of that background info matters. I have 2 cold drink tumblers now (got another Disney one as a gift), a handful of hot cups like red cup day and Valentine’s ones, I use the other company’s French vanilla for my K-Cup’s, and I don’t brew enough grounds to justify getting a bag. Is there any unique merch I should be on the lookout for to use my stars as a coupon towards, or should I just sporadically get free drinks? I really only drink coffee and cold brew, with the super rare green tea lemonade. Is it worth using the stars on such mundane items? Is there something location specific I could start looking for that’s unique? Would love to hear feedback from the community. Thanks in advance!

I tried a washed Kenyan espresso today. The shot was pulled on a La Cimbali M100 and the grinder was a Mahlkönig (but I didn't see the grinding process so I'm not sure). I’m experienced with pour-overs but still learning to refine my palate in espresso, and I wanted to get some thoughts on what I experienced:

1. It tasted a bit sour – I know Kenyan coffees are high in acidity, but could this be from under-extraction or the grind being too coarse? Or is it just the nature of the bean?
2. The finish was intense – as I swallowed, it almost burned the back of my throat (not temperature-wise, but in a “whoa” kind of way) and gave me goosebumps. Is that expected for Kenyans in espresso form?
3. It wasn’t very hot – not sure if this was due to brew temp, cold cup, or if it sat too long while my other coffee was being prepared.
4. Aromatic but slightly harsh smell – there was a bitter, almost overroasted smell to the espresso - the beans were looking normal though. Could this be a roast issue, age, or something in the brewing?

For context, I also had a Burundi pourover (Cafec Flower dripper) right after, which was lovely and aromatic except a little overroasted smell again, but as it cooled, it also had a hint of sourness.

Let’s meet again—
for the first time.

I’ll see you across the room,
shoulders turned,
half a smile playing at your lips.
You won’t know me—
not yet.

We’ll speak like strangers,
ask all the questions we already know the answers to.
Where you’re from.
What you do.
What you’re afraid of.

And I’ll fall for you again,
quietly.
Like a secret I’ve always kept.

You’ll laugh the way you used to
when you didn’t think I was listening.
And I’ll memorize it
all over again.

We’ll take long walks at dusk,
share coffee from chipped mugs,
talk like the world isn’t ending—
like it never did.

Each moment,
another brick.
Another beam.

Until we build it again—
a life.
Not the same as before,
but something softer.
Something we’ll promise
not to drop.

But then—
the edges blur.

You start to fade
when I reach for your hand.
Your voice thins into wind.
The room begins to collapse.

And I remember.

I remember
you’re gone.

This was only a dream—
just a kindness my mind gave me
to make the night feel shorter.

I wake
with your name
pressed to my teeth.

And all I can do
is whisper it
into the pillow
like a prayer
that never gets answered.

Let’s meet again,
for the first time.

If only in my dreams.

If you do meet him, expect value:

	•	Free SEO/site/growth audits over coffee


	•	Honest feedback if you’re building something

	•	Fresh perspective on how to scale digital organically


	•	Or just an energizing conversation with someone super driven

Seven years ago, Beacon felt like this sleepy, artsy town where you could walk down Main Street and run into the same familiar faces every day. There was a quiet magic to it—old brick buildings (still here) local coffee shops that knew your order (still do), and that unmistakable sense that something was about to happen. And wow, did it ever.

In the past 7 years, Beacon has evolved with a lot more housing and more expensive housing. There are more restaurants, more boutiques, more people visiting—and yes, more traffic. Some longtime locals grumble about the changes, and I get it. Growth always comes with tension.

But I still see the Beacon I fell in love with.

What I love most is that Beacon has found a way to grow without totally losing itself - yes there are a lot of changes happening and people resisting at the town hall meetings thankfully, and there are a lot of more expensive restaurants & shops, but Beacon still supports artists & musicians.

Beacon and the people here still support nature, parks, schools, the arts & it still draws people who want a slower pace and a deeper connection—not just to place, but to each other.

Beacon isn’t a secret anymore - but it’s still special. And honestly, watching it change over these past 7 years has made me love Beacon even more and embrace the fact that life is a series of change events - in towns, people, countries, and the world - and ourselves.",1,1746367005.0,BeaconNYRealEstate,0,1.0,False

I *might* have found him. I *might* have tried to make a bargain. He… might have declined?

Let me back up a bit.

I have felt an affinity for nature as far back as I can remember. My play pretend games as a child were always out in the woods, gathering random leaves, berries, sticks. You name it, I collected it. Feathers were absolute treasures. Being so close to nature, one can’t help but develop an affinity for the Neighbors, too.

I had a Neighbor friend from the time I was nine. She was a wood maiden, borne from a big, beautiful willow in the crook of a stream deep in the woods behind my house. She taught me which berries I could actually eat, and which leaves were good to rub on a scraped knee. In retrospect, I know it’s very strange for a human to be so close to a wood maiden, and I couldn’t tell you why she befriended me. Nor could I tell you why she bestowed me with a vocal gift.

You see, I’ve also always loved music. Something about it speaks to me. I can understand feelings through music. Understanding what another human meant, or wanted, or felt was hard for me. I couldn’t pick up on social cues. But music… music made sense. A sombre melody could evoke a feeling of longing; a light and wandering tune would fill me with so much elation I thought I would float away. Music allowed me an avenue to forget that no one wanted to hang out with “the weird girl” who “dressed funny”.

I shared my favorite songs with my wood maiden friend. She listened. I’m not sure I was very good, but I put my heart into every lyric, every note. And I think she saw something in that.

In Spring of 2003, I sang my newest favorite song to her. Even if you’re not into alternative rock with strong female vocals, you would probably recognize it. To my thirteen-year-old self’s shame, I cracked on one of the higher notes. It happened every time, but I’d been hopeful it wouldn’t happen like that in front of my friend.

I stopped singing abruptly, face heating unbearably. For the first time, I felt embarrassed for sharing my music with the wood maiden. My eyes welled with tears, and I began to stutter an apology.

She wouldn’t have it. “Shh, do not fret, my little lark,” she told me. “You sing with such heart, such passion. Very few can put as much of themselves in their music as you do. Here.”

The wood maiden plucked a newly unfurled leaf from her willow, then came to me. With cool, delicate fingers, she pressed the leaf along my throat. Tendrils of… something… radiated from the slender blade, burrowing into my skin and winding their way to my vocal chords. I couldn’t describe it then, but now I would say it felt like drinking a fine scotch; a mild burning that left a pleasant warmth in its wake.

I reached up to my throat when she pulled her hands away, but the leaf was gone.

“Now try,” she said.

Though I was terrified of messing up again, I obliged her.

The notes came out clear and sweet as mountain spring water. Empowered by what flowed from my mouth, I sang on with renewed vigor, and when it was time to sing that high note, I nailed it.

When I finished, the wood maiden was smiling at me, eyes sparkling.

“You shall never hit a sour note again,” she told me. “This will not make you remember the words, or add the soul for you, but you will be able to sing whatever comes to your mind without fear of being off.”

Tears sprang to my eyes again. “Thank you,” I murmured. “Thank you so much, but why? And… and what do you want in return?” It dawned upon my adolescent brain that there would be a cost for this. While the wood maiden was my dearest friend (okay, my *only* friend at the time), she was still a Neighbor. And Neighbors don’t give anything for free.

“You must return to me once a year and sing me a song that is true from your heart. You may never sing the same song to me twice. You will do this for as long as you shall live.”

Even thirteen-year-old me understood the gravity of what she was asking. While I wouldn’t have to stay in the area for the rest of my life, I *would* need to make sure I could come see her at least once a year. Which was easy, at first. I lived with my parents in the house I grew up in until I was eighteen, at which point I went to college. That made things a little tricky, but I still came back for summer and winter breaks, so no big deal. Even after I moved out, it was only a few towns over, so I could easily go back and visit the wood maiden and her willow.

And I did. Year after year, I went back and sang her a song, true from my heart, a new one each time. Some years, it was a happy tune, full of joy and the spark of potential. There were a few years where my song had a darker tone, especially that year I dealt with a bad breakup. I sang my pain and heartache to her, and despite the tears in my eyes that led to snot in my nose, every note came out clear and true, as they had since she’d pressed the leaf to my throat.

Life eventually took me away from where I grew up about five years ago. Not too far, thankfully. It was only about a four hour drive to return, and I only needed to make it once a year. But a lot can happen in the span of a year.

Like a development.

I’d known the suburbs were encroaching, but it never crossed my mind how far they’d go.

This will be a familiar story to you. It’s the same one playing out right now for Nessa and company. But they still have time to seek a happier ending than my friend did.

I last saw my wood maiden in March of 2023. I sang her my song. She listened as she always did; as I thought she always would.

But when I went back in February of 2024, she was gone, and in the place of her big, beautiful willow was a bland, cookie-cutter house, surrounded by a dozen other bland, cookie-cutter houses. Where birds had once nested and added their own refrains to my songs, there was now only a cacophony of lawnmowers and leaf blowers. The creek that had run so cool and clear now ran through a drainage pipe, sluggish and foamed with algae and trash.

There are no words for the pain, sorrow, and anger I felt. I went to a bar that night and drank until I couldn’t remember the name of the town I was in. I don’t remember where I slept. Gods, I couldn’t even tell you where I woke up the next morning.

When Nessa started telling us about the development company trying to do the same thing in her area, I felt a pull. I hadn’t been able to do anything for my wood maiden friend, but maybe I could help stop this.

My life is pretty rootless right now, and I never really fit in most places I’ve been, so I thought, what the Hell? I miss being around nature and Neighbors, and you know what, fuck development companies. Fuck anyone and everyone who thinks it’s okay to just raze the forests and build shitty apartments for shitty people that see no problem with dumping their trash on the side of the road. I’ve always thought of humans as cruel and careless, always wanting more, more, MORE, never being satisfied with the beauty that’s right outside their back doors.

So I went seeking the opportunity to stop these ones.

I did a little research, and I brushed up on some old ballads. My heart is filled with symphonic metal, but I love me a good folk ballad.

Obviously I couldn’t let on where I *actually* got my info from, because that would probably go very poorly for Nessa, and she’s dealing with enough shit. The last thing I want to do is cause her more problems. I would need another reason for knowing about the fuckery going on in her neck of the woods. Something like researching certain development companies related to my vendetta. It hadn’t surprised me to learn that the developer that destroyed my wood maiden is the same one trying to build in Nessa’s area.

Armed with that and a plethora of songs to hopefully entice with, I set out. It was *not* easy finding the right place, let me tell you. Nessa has done an excellent job protecting herself and her coworkers from being doxxed.

But as they say, where there’s a will, there’s a way.

I was driving through a little podunk town thirty miles from nowhere, not expecting this to be the place and intending to drive right through. Until I saw the sign.

Darner’s Auto Service.

Holy fucking shit, I’d actually found it.

I kept driving, and lo and behold, there was Dillon’s diner, too. I decided I could do with a bite to eat, so I pulled in. The young waitress who took my order seemed easily flustered. She gave me an odd look, one that I’d long been accustomed to. My attire often looks like I walked straight out of Ye Olden Days, and for whatever reason, people find them weird. Like, hello, they’re just clothes? But whatever. I couldn’t help but wonder if it was the same waitress that Nessa stopped from giving her number to the Mechanic. Probably. This town was *small*.

The food was decent, and once I was done, I asked the waitress if she knew of any good camping spots in the area.

“Oh, umm, not really. There used to be some nice trails and a few campsites up the road, but they got destroyed when that last development went in.” She spat “development” out like the toxic waste it was. “There’s still some woods left about fifteen minutes from here, but I wouldn’t recommend staying there overnight.”

“Why’s that?”

She got shifty. “Well, it’s… there’s something weird about that place. Sometimes folks go missing out there.”

That sounded promising.

I sighed. “Alright, well, thanks for the heads up. Where is that exactly? So I don’t try camping in the wrong spot.”

She gave me directions. I thanked her again, paid for my food, and left.

And of course, I went straight to the location she’d told me not to.

I parked my car at a gas station on the way, then walked from there, but not before grabbing a cup of coffee and dumping thirteen sugars in it. I’d also brought a jar of honey from home. I am not above using bribes to be heard. This would be a hard sell, I knew. It didn’t help that my plan was kind of half-assed, not fully formed yet. I was still debating on what song the Mechanic might find most convincing. All the ones I knew in Gaelic were pretty sad, so those were almost certainly out. Reminding him of Deirdre was the last thing I wanted to do. For the hundredth time, I wondered if he’d get a kick out of one about hunting. I knew a few of those.

Coffee in hand and pack on my back, I set out. The weather was great for hiking. Warm enough that I could take off my scarf, but not sunny. Woods have always felt like home to me; I don’t do well in the sun.

After about an hour of wandering around, I found a nice spot to set up camp. I had a hammock and a small tarp to keep me covered. For food, I had a box of granola bars, two packs of beef jerky, and the foraging knowledge I’d gained in my younger days. Hopefully it would last me long enough to find the Dragonfly.

Rather than continue wandering aimlessly and trusting luck to guide me, I made my presence known. I began to sing. Best start with something seasonally appropriate.

*“When in the springtime of the year,*

*When the trees are crowned with leaves.*

*When the ash and oak and the birch and yew*

*Are dressed in ribbons fair.”*

Rustling and fluttering in the branches above me drew my attention. Crows. My heart raced, knowing what it meant, but I continued on as if I hadn’t noticed.

*“When owls call the breathless moon*

*In the blue veil of the night,*

*Shadows of the trees–”*

“Well, what have we here? A little lark, maybe?”

I whipped around, startled more by the same nickname my wood maiden had given me than seeing a certain thorn wielder. He could, quite frankly, actually be described as a tik-tok fuck boi. I don’t even use tik-tok, and I can recognize that Nessa had not been joking when she’d described Briar as such.

“I’d like to speak with your captain,” I said.

His eyebrows shot up. “Straight to the point, huh? And not afraid to ask for things, either. Too bad he’s busy.”

Not to be deterred, I pressed on. “I want to help. With the development company.”

He looked me up and down, then laughed. “And how the fuck do you think you’d do that? Gonna write a strongly worded letter to your congressman? You don’t need to speak with the Captain to do that.”

I stood straighter. “No. I have a proposal for him. But that’s for him to hear, not you.”

His eyes narrowed.

I lifted my chin, hoping that he couldn’t see the tremors I felt. I’d come here to find a way to stop the spread of humanity, to help preserve at least this little bit of nature, and I would not be turned away by tHorny boi.

“If it helps, I have a coffee for you.” I held out the cup.

He took it, eyes never leaving my face. After a small sniff, he gingerly took a sip. Nodding, he said, “Yeah, okay. I’ll tell him you’re out here. Can’t guarantee he’ll come, but I’ll tell him.”

“I have something sweet for him, too,” I said.

Briar snorted. “The Captain isn’t so easily bribed.”

“That may be so, but I bet even he might hear me out in exchange for a jar of tupelo honey. I hear that’s not as easy to get up here as it is in the south.”

He gave me a look that might have been appreciation. Listen, I might not have a detailed plan, but I know how to entice a Neighbor.

“I’ll let him know.”

I watched him leave, then settled in to wait. Within half an hour, I could hear the faint strumming of a banjo. My chest grew warm. This was it. This was what I’d been seeking since I’d lost my Neighbor connection with my wood maiden. Maybe even longer. What do you do with yourself when you feel like you don’t belong among human society? Like you’ll *never* belong? You go frolic with fae.

I turned to where I thought the music was coming from, but it shifted, now coming from my left, then my right, until it sounded like it came from all around me. Not wanting to look as scared as I felt, I stopped moving. The scent of black cherries swirled around me.

With a final *thrum*, the banjo stopped, and a voice like warm honey flowed from behind me.

“Master o’ Thorns says you got some kind o’ proposal for me.”

I turned to face him, and had to make an effort to keep breathing. His “pretty boy” guise was more handsome than I had ever imagined. I focused my gaze on the instrument in his hands, not ready to look him in the eye yet. Dragonfly silhouettes flitted across the head and gold filigree curled around the neck between the frets.

 “Yes, that’s right,” I said, managing to not choke on the words.

“And what could a timid thing like you possibly have to offer to me?”

My spine straightened at his words. Had I been a bit of a churchmouse most of my life? Yes. Did I still get spooked easily? Uh, also yes. But if I was going to fight for something I believed in, I would grow steel in my bones.

“I want to help you get rid of the Avalon development company.” I shifted my gaze to his shoulder, which allowed me to see just enough of that grin we’ve all heard so much about.

“Do you now? I’m not a fan of havin’ to repeat myself, so I’m only gonna ask this one more time. What could you possibly have to offer that I would find useful?”

My throat grew tight. I knew what I wanted to ask was a BIG ask, and would come with a hefty price, if he was even inclined to give me one. “My voice. I’ve heard one of the Hunters in this area is a master musician. Judging by that instrument, I’m guessing that’s you. Two voices are more powerful than one, and if I could get just a little bit of magical aid to enhance–”

His guffaw cut me off and he slapped his knee as if I’d told the best joke he’d ever heard. “You have the audacity to come here an’ ask me to give your voice power, without even introducin’ yourself or given’ me an offering for wastin’ my time? Get the fuck outta my woods before I make you part of the scenery.”

*Right, the honey. How could I forget?*

“Wait, I do have an offering!” I rushed to my backpack and pulled out the jar of tupelo honey. Keeping my eyes on his shoulder, I offered it to him, wincing internally at my shaking hand.

He gave a short *hmm* and took the jar, inspecting the amber fluid. Motions slow, he removed the lid and stuck a finger in to have a taste. His eyes closed and he hummed again, this time in pleasure. “Yeah, that’s real tupelo honey alright. Good quality, too. But you still haven’t introduced yourself.”

This was expected, and I was ready to answer. “You may refer to me as Fox.”

He chuckled darkly. “Fox. You must think you’re clever or somethin’. Are you clever, Little Fox?”

“When it comes to humans, I believe I’m more clever than most. Am I more clever than you? I would never be so presumptuous.”

Another laugh rumbled in his chest. “Flattery won’t get you what you want, Little Fox. But you’re clever enough to avoid lookin’ me in the eye, I’ll give you that.”

I smirked, steeling myself and hoping that my *other* research had been accurate, and that my stitching was true.

And I looked right into his eyes.

Let me tell you, friends, his hazel eyes are fucking gorgeous, and it would be so easy to get lost in them and give up all your secrets.

But he wasn’t going to get mine, not today.

My vest grew uncomfortably warm as the sigils and runes I’d stitched into the lining did their job of protecting me. The tension in my gut eased as I realized they were working.

His brows furrowed, then he laughed again. “Maybe you are as clever as you think. I don’t know what kind o’ magic you’re using. Yet. It ain’t a hagstone. Some kind o’ charm, maybe?” He assessed me with renewed interest. “What concern is Avalon of yours, anyway? What stake do you have in this? You’re not from around here.”

I nodded. “That is true. But Avalon has done me grievous injury, and I would see them burn. I would see them and everyone like them burn, and the forests rise anew from their ashes.”

“You some kind of poet, too?” He raised an eyebrow at me.

My cheeks flushed with heat and my gaze dropped to the ground. “No, I… I just like to read a lot of fantasy books,” I muttered.

He recapped the honey with a click. “Well, I’ve listened to your proposal, but I can’t say I’m convinced. We’ve done just fine without human help for centuries. I think we can handle this. You best be on your way, Little Fox.”

I opened my mouth to protest, to say that he wouldn’t have been just fine without human intervention last year when facing that cookie hag. But I shut it just as quickly, because there was no way I could spin my knowing that without outing Nessa.

My mind raced, searching for a straw to grasp at, something to convince him that I was worth the trouble. “No, please! Just… let me sing one song for you. Show you what I can do *without* your help, then judge me.”

His eyes bore into mine, and there was a slight pressure in my head as he tried again to read my thoughts, my memories. Criminy, I’d have to find another way to work these protections in, because it felt like my vest was about to catch fire.

“Alright,” he finally relented. “You get one song. Best make it count.”

One song. I’d get one song to convince a Master of the Wild Hunt to let me work beside him in what could possibly count as eco-terrorism. My heart pounded against my ribs as my thoughts flew, trying to determine which tune would best help me.

They landed on one, and I immediately knew it to be the right one. It was the one I always thought of now whenever my wood maiden came to mind. I began to sing.

*“A young man walked through the forest*

*With his quiver and hunting bow.*

*He heard a young girl singing,*

*And followed the sound below.*

*There he spied the maiden*

*Who lives in the willow.”*

The Huntsman listened, arms crossed, face showing nothing. I sang on, not letting his obvious apathy hinder my melody. Not until the end of the third verse did he show any flicker of emotion, and even that was so fleeting I wondered if I’d even seen it.

*“The maiden wept when she heard him,*

*When he said he’d set her free.*

*He took his axe and used it*

*To bring down her ancient tree.*

*‘Now your willow’s fallen,*

*Now you belong to me.’”*

My eyes burned, as they always did when I sang this song. The truth hidden within the words of greed pulled at the still raw edges of the wound left by my fallen friend.

Only after my last note stopped ringing amongst the trees did I brush the tears off my cheeks. I still couldn’t tell what the Mechanic might be thinking. For all appearances, my song hadn’t moved him one bit.

“I’ll think about it,” he said.

I blinked rapidly. Tried and failed to keep my lip from trembling, but nodded anyway. If that hadn’t convinced him, I probably couldn’t.

“See, I got somethin’ real important comin’ up, and I don’t have the time to be trainin’ little foxes. But I’ll think about your song, and if I decide you might be worth something, I’ll find you.”

The grin he gave me then was feral, and I finally stopped to question myself on what the *fuck* I was doing, seeking out a Huntsman like this.

But fuck it. Whatever. I’ve been here for a few days now, and I can camp out here for another week or two if I need to to wait for an answer. YOLO, right?",1,1746366941.0,atypicalpests,0,1.0,False

1kekbha,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nepal/comments/1kekbha/ride_review_rubi_valley_from_rasuwa/,"Ride Review, Rubi Valley from Rasuwa","TLDR: Kathmandu, Nuwakot, Syafrubesi, Gatlang, Somdang, Pangsang Pass, Tpling, Sertung, Borang, Jharlang, Darkha, Katunje, Nuwakot, Kathmandu\~300 km\~11 hrs total riding time completed over two days. First Night stay at Somdang and second night back home to Kathmandu. One of the challenging offroad rides, especially the uphill part  from Somdang to Pangsang Pass, and the Downhill part on newly constructed parts while descending from Tipling and Sertung



So we decided to go on an impromptu ride to Rubi Valley last weekend on my new Xpulse 200 4V. It was May Day Holiday and we departed home at around 7 30 in the morning. We took the tokha route to Nuwakot, then went towards betrawati where the pitch roads ended. We then took the trishuli corridor to Syafrubesi, saving us a lot of time bypassing kalikasthan and dhunche, but the offroad part started about 10 kms from Betrawati. We reached Syafrubesi at around 11 and had masubhat lunch there.

The road from Syafru to Gatlang is decent for a adventure bike but still we managed to have a low speed crash over some loose gravel breaking the tips of my crash guard which did its job by saving the radiator. We pickup ourself up and headed towards the Chilime dam site on the way to Gatlang. The current view of Gatlang has deteriorated as it is not a ""black village"" as it is famously know as the reconstruction after the earthquake has meant brick and mortar buildings with colorful tin roof. Anyways, we headed towards parbati kunda and took a small break there. It would have been better if the alpine wetland was left on its own without any gaudy concrete embellishment but I digress..

The road leads towars a burnt forest which looks alien to the max, very eerie feeling as we stopped for some reflection and photos in the middle of the destruction. You can find the link towards how this happened and some insight on ecological succession [here](https://www.onlinekhabar.com/2025/05/1674159/a-glimmer-of-light-within-the-black-hole?fbclid=IwY2xjawKC8T9leHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHm894LemLfGYldsFqInQceViZkNyZ2Sf-r_1I7q1FmmgR39VUgyiVx7yU115_aem_1T_03ISm93jimT9uM_PMUQ).  The uphill part from here to Somdang was tough but my bike's performance was satisfactory and could easily do a pillion climb. However the pass was very foggy and we did not have a view of the cliff face below so we could not really tell how precarious the road was for the better.

We stayed the night in Somdang at the Somdang Valley Guest house which was a testament to the remoteness of the place. The guest house was operated by a mother and her daughter in law and their newborn Habil Ghale. We were told that guests were few and far between in that place which was quite different from other rides near kathmandu valley which are getting ever more popular in recent times. There was no electricity in the place and no network coverage, neither Nepal Telecom nor Ncell. We bought a chicken for 2500 in the village and shared the evening meal with the family. The normal cost for food was 350 for veg dal bhat and 400 for the room.

In the morning the skies cleared around Somdang and we could see the peaks near Paldor from our balcony. I added three teaspoon full of instant coffee to my tea in the morning, had some granola bars and readied for the tough climb ahead. We had been warned by a vlog about the terrible road conditions and it was a test for the motorcycle. As you know, as further away from civilization you go, roads turn to tracks and it is mostly a matter of bricolage than engineering in road construction leading to over the code grades and sharp hairpin bends. On top of that the road was very rocky and broken which tested the motorcycle to its limit.. and it kind of gave up as well as the balancer gear seems broken after that leading to some vibrations at low rpms.

Anyways, after about a little more than an hour we reached pangsang pass which was worth the treacherous climb up. Although we only got a fleeting glimplse of the Ganesh Himal massif the cloudplay in the pass was beyond words. We immersed ouself into the atmosphere by hiking up a ridge which we reckoned must have added at least a 150 m altitutude to the 3850 m altitude of Pangsang pass making our climb to 4000m landmark. There was one teahouse in the pass which was closed (we knew about this closure as we were advised at somdang). You can catch Nepal telecom reception at Pangsang which gave us an opportunity to call home as we were off grid last night.

We descended from Pangsang to Tipling through a dense rhododendron forest where you can find red, white, pink and purple rhododendron. The downhill part is fun and technical from here to Tipling, you can find solitary shelter huts for shepherds and stone paved downhill tracks whih will test your vehicle's suspension and gears, and your spinal compression. After about an hour downhill from Pangsang pass near Tipling we finally met another person. We stopped there and talked to him about five minuted just with the sheer joy of seeing another person after Somdang.

We stopped in Tipling for lunch and some rest. After the meal we watched the Augusta Westland helicopter of Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak land in Tipling to inagurate a Armed Police Force Border Outpost there. But the irony of the fact is that with all the gold smuggling going on from Rasuwa, we just made a detour from Rasuwa towards Dhading and the security presence was nonexistant in this part of the Northern Border. Maybe it is a testament to the toughness of the route we took, in retrosepct.

The road down from Tipling to Sertung was treacherous as the grade was sheer and it was akin to ploughing a rocky field with the handlebars as your plough and the engine with its bovine potential at first gear. The structure of the road is such that you have to start at the higher ward numbers of Rubi Valley Rural municipality and traverse each ward, with a river in between and the hairpin bends connecting them. Anyways, we traversed through Sertung which also had its newly constructed road to challenge us in the downhill portion.

After Sertung, the roads do get better after Jharlang following the Aankhu Khola towards Darkha and Lapang. From Lapang, we headed towards katunje to meet the Pushpalal highway which is ready forr its final layer of asphalt giving us a comfortable ride at careful speeds to avoid the deposited aggregate for several kilometers, after which the highway was completed most of Dhading District. However, the highway abruptly ends at the border of Nuwakot giving us some more opportunity to ride on offroad track.

We met blacktopped roads again near Trishuli, and headed back through Tokha. Reached home at about 730 in the evening.

TLDR: Hardcore gambler grandma with crazy loanshark debts. Crazy manipulative and even went to jail due to illegal activity to pay off debt (At 60).. Now in 80’s and still manipulative but at least no more debts as the jail term triggered a change. Also steals a lot in the past due to her debts.

Womanizing uncle who has same habits as above but not due to gambling, all money is to feed diff woman. 

Down to my mum whom never cared for me in the past as was busy with diff toxic man. 1st my drug addict dad(They didn’t get married, I was born out of wedlock) who went to jail and came out hating on me thinking I’ll harass him and beg him to pls shower me with fatherly love. I grew up without him so I don’t know what’s his issue. (More on this next time)
Next was the man she married and bore 2 sons with. He was a pervert and sick man whom sexually abused me when I was 6-7. She didn’t believe me when I told her. Than there were a few other man, I remember one was married and than I had to live with another one also whom was crazy controlling. Basically we were just moving a lot and staying with different man. 
Basically I don’t have really know what it is like to have real motherly/fatherly love. 
I have relied on myself since I was 15. Before that my grandpa was around so he took care of me but also he suffered greatly as he had to pay grandma’s debts and mum’s debts.

I started working my ass off at 15 and also at the same time having to pay off mum’s loan sharks debts. Similarly to her mum(grandma), they have this monstrous gambling habit which incurred massive debts from loan sharks. I’ve experienced all the spray paint/ hot coffee sprayed on door and being followed by loanshark runners since teenage days. 

From staying in diff man’s house/ diff houses to staying in a rental flat. Life was a turmoil.

Always tell myself that this generational “curse” needs to end with me. I must not gamble and I must not borrow money from others mindlessly. 

Both grandma and mum are the worse examples. 
And tbh, up till today I hate myself and I always dwell on this because I feel really really bad that these 2 people are whom I NEVER WANT TO BECOME. Sometimes I feel like I should have just left long ago and not even fulfill the basic duty of “taking care” of them. I always have this thought but never brave enough to do it.

Fast forward to today, I’ve grown up, I’m successful (my definition is that I have a stable job, I have sufficient savings cos I worked my ass off since 15, I bought a hdb, I pay all the bills at home, I give her allowance and I really do my best to fulfill my “daughter” duties.) I’m happily married and I have a husband whom understands this situation I am in and always try to listen to me when I rant. Context is I’m in my 30’s now. 

But some things just don’t change, she still has a disgusting gambling habit where however money she has, she would gamble it all away, she has no savings and she just lives this way. She’s had stints of theft in her previous cashiering job and sometimes, cash at home goes missing, my gold necklace goes missing. Cancer struck her few years ago but it doesn’t scare her… she is still living this way. My husband says she will never change so I just gotta accept things as it is. I don’t know how to put it into words, is it right to despise her? She’s nearly 60 and sometimes I have really heinous thoughts asking myself why must I put up with this for additional 40 years or so….. The thoughts are really killing me at times and emotionally torturous. 

I just want to know if anyone faces this generational trauma issue here? Any stories to share?

You think that salad's just a snack?

A boring pile upon a rack?

They're alive! Still breathing low,

Even after the farmer's hoe!

You bought them from the brightly lit store,

They're plotting something, that is for sure!

They've got these things, these biophotons bright,

Storing up all that sunny light!

Like tiny batteries, packed with zing,

Ready to make your spirit sing!

You take a bite, a crunchy sound,

While living energy swirls around!

Your heart might flutter, thump and pound,

As biophotons make you astound!

That carrot stick, it knows your name!

That broccoli is in the game!

They're sending signals, quick and fast,

An energy boost that's built to last!

Forget the coffee, skip the pop,

Let the biophotons make you hop!

You'll clear your mind, you'll feel so grand,

With a living apple in your hand!

So next time you reach for kale or peas,

Remember their vibrant energies!

Don't just chew idly, bland and meek,

Engage the power that you seek!

It's not just food, it's a light fantastic!

A revolution, slightly sarcastic!

So grab a fruit, a veggie bright,

And harness the biophoton's might!

Acknowledge now, with joyful yelp,

And let the living food now help!

Go get some greens, don't delay,

And start correcting, right away!

 Other symptoms that feel relevant: I've had some numbness in my hands as well, comes and goes; headaches/migraines, but that was expected going into quitting caffeine; insatiable thirst, my mouth is sticky and feels dry and I just feel like I can't drink enough; nausea, but I have gi issues so idk if it's related; extreme fatigue, also expected for quitting caffeine; weird throbbing pain above my hip that feels kidney related(same kidney that almost shut down from infection in 2016), but could also just be a muscle issue(HSD means I pull things or pop things out of place a lot).

Sorry this post is lengthy and all over the place, I haven't been able to sleep well because of this pain, and I just can't tell if this all sounds normal for what I have going on, or if I'm possibly overhydrating and causing my sodium to drop too much. Idk what to do, but these legs are driving me crazy, and my doctor's office is closed over the weekend. Any help would be appreciated. ",2,1746366362.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

the julep cups reviewed offer distinct features that contribute to their individual appeal and performance.

**Material Composition:** The customary julep cup is crafted from sterling silver or pewter, which provides excellent thermal conductivity, ensuring your drink stays cold longer.Modern variations often incorporate stainless steel, brass, or copper, offering different aesthetic qualities and varying levels of thermal properties. The choice of material impacts the cupS weight, durability, and potential to develop a patina over time.

Each material delivers a distinguished experience. Sterling silver is valued for its exquisite gleam and legacy quality. Pewter has a more subtle shine and rustic appeal. Stainless steel imparts a clean, contemporary appearance and resists tarnishing. Brass exudes a warm, vintage charm. Copper provides an antique aesthetic and can enhance the perceived coolness of your drink.

**Capacity & Dimensions:** Julep cups typically range in capacity between 10 and 14 ounces, providing ample space for crushed ice, mint, bourbon, and other ingredients. The cup's height and diameter influence how comfortably it fits in your hand and the ratio of ingredients presented.wider cups may allow for more aromatics to be released, while taller cups can accommodate elaborate mint sprig garnishes.The dimensions influence both the presentation and drinking experience. A balanced cup prevents unwanted spills. Consider the cup's height in conjunction with your typical garnish and the anticipated ice melt. A bigger capacity might call for higher alcohol content to prevent drink dilution.

**Construction & Craftsmanship:** The method of construction affects the cup's durability and longevity. Seamless construction eliminates weak points and prevents leaks. Hand-hammered or engraved details add character and demonstrate artisanal skill. A well-crafted julep cup will feature a smooth, polished rim for agreeable sipping and a sturdy base to prevent tipping.

High-quality construction guarantees a durable and long-lasting cup. Handcrafted embellishments show an element of artistic ability. Seamless cups are structurally superior, particularly with continued use and cleaning.

**Insulation Properties:** While traditional julep cups rely on the material's thermal conductivity to keep drinks cold, some modern variations feature double-walled insulation. This design creates a barrier between the drink and the external environment, further reducing heat transfer and maintaining a refreshing chill. Double-walled cups eliminate condensation, protecting furniture from moisture rings.

Enhanced insulation features make for a better handling experience by not freezing the user's hand. It also reduces the amount of dilution caused by melting ice.

**Surface Finish & Detailing:** Julep cups are available in a variety of surface finishes, including polished, satin, and antique. Polished finishes reflect light brilliantly, while satin finishes offer a more understated elegance.Antique finishes mimic the look of aged silver, adding vintage appeal.Engraved monograms, crests, or decorative patterns can add a personal touch and transform a simple cup into a treasured heirloom.

The aesthetic elements will either call attention to the cup itself, or accent the drink within. A polished silver cup will showcase the ingredients more vividly. A satin finish emits a subdued elegance,whereas an antique finish provides a touch of nostalgia.Personalized engraving can make a great gift commemorating an occasion.

**Weight & balance:** The weight of a julep cup impacts how it feels in your hand and contributes to the perceived quality. A ample cup,with a balanced weight distribution,exudes a sense of luxury and stability. A lightweight cup may feel less substantial but can be easier to hold for extended periods. The weight and balance are crucial for the overall tactile experience.

An unevenly balanced cup can be awkward to hold and more prone to spilling. The ideal weight is subjective but usually lies in the feeling of premium quality and long-term usability.

1kek5hk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/1kek5hk/credit_card_mistakes_and_how_to_avoid_them_from/,Credit card mistakes and how to avoid them (From someone who learned the hard way),"Just wanted to share some personal experience and hopefully help a few people avoid the same traps I fell into with credit cards. I used to think I had a decent handle on my finances—until I didn't. Credit cards can be powerful tools or financial nightmares depending on how you use them. So here’s a rundown of common mistakes I’ve made (and seen others make), along with some tips on how to steer clear.

* **Mistake 1: Treating Credit Like Free Money**

When I first got a credit card, it felt like *bonus cash*. I’d swipe for dinners, gadgets, or clothes I couldn’t really afford, telling myself I'd pay it off “next paycheck.” Spoiler: I didn’t. The balance snowballed fast.

**Prevention Tip**: Never spend more than you can pay off in full each month. Use your card like a debit card with perks—only swipe for what you *already have* the money for.

* **Mistake 2: Only Making Minimum Payments**

I thought paying the minimum kept me in the clear. But interest charges quietly piled up behind the scenes. It took me *years* to pay off a balance that should’ve taken months.

**Prevention Tip**: Always pay your statement balance in full. If you can’t, at least make a plan to pay more than the minimum and avoid turning a small balance into long-term debt.

* **Mistake 3: Ignoring the Interest Rate (APR)**

I didn’t even know what my APR was until I got hit with it. Credit cards often have high interest rates (like 20%+), and if you're carrying a balance, it adds up *fast*.

**Prevention Tip**: Know your APR. Better yet, avoid paying interest by paying in full. If you already have debt, consider a 0% balance transfer card—but be sure to read the fine print.

* **Mistake 4: Maxing Out the Card**

I figured if my limit was $3,000, using $2,999 was fair game. Turns out, high utilization hurts your credit score—like, a lot.

**Prevention Tip**: Keep your credit utilization below 30%, ideally under 10%. If you’re regularly getting close to your limit, consider asking for a credit limit increase or paying multiple times a month.

* **Mistake 5: Not Tracking Spending**

Credit cards made it easy to lose track of where my money was going. A few coffees here, a late-night online order there… suddenly I was staring at a $700 bill wondering what happened.

**Prevention Tip**: Use apps (like Mint, YNAB, or your card's app) to track spending. Set alerts if you’re getting close to your budget.

* **Mistake 6: Ignoring Statements and Fraud Alerts**

Once I missed a fraudulent charge because I wasn’t checking my statements. It was a hassle to sort out weeks later.

**Prevention Tip**: Review your statements monthly and set up real-time alerts. Catching fraud early = way less stress.

**TL;DR**: Credit cards aren’t evil they’re tools. But they need to be used with care and intention. Don’t let a few small mistakes spiral into long-term financial pain like I did. Learn from my mess so you don’t have to clean up your own later!

1kek4wl,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1kek4wl/scared_and_confused/,Scared and Confused,"Hey guys, I am 25F. I used to have some acid reflux here and there. However, since August 2024, It started getting more frequent. I think it was exacerbated by stress and anxiety as I have been very stressed and anxious since August 2024 to this day. My symptoms are acid reflux, nausea, headache (very bad), belching when I have active reflux. Heartburn is not that common, happens once in a while but I do feel that burn sensation sometimes in my throat when belching. I do not have any pain in my stomach but I do feel a burning sensation. It goes away by itself.

I visited a gastro around mid-march and he put me on Somopraz 40 mg with Amitriptyline 10 mg (for a month) as I was having trouble sleeping due to anxiety. He did not ask me to taper the dosage but I did try to taper it as per my understanding. I have been off of Sompraz for a week now. I changed my lifestyle as well. Not lying down after meals, sleeping on the left side, walk after every meal, workout 4 days a week. I also do not consume tea, coffee, alcohol, or any processed food. However, my symptoms have returned now. I get that burning sensation, my appetite has reduced, I feel satiated after eating very little, it feels like food is sititng right at the centre of my chest. I have not got any heartburn yet. That acidic belch has occurred twice in one week. My bloodwork was all normal, ultrasound was normal. I got food intolerance test done and am allergic to only cheese and carrots.

I am very scared now that I can see the symptoms return. Could it just be rebound acid or could it be something serious? Should I get endoscopy done? I feel very scared and hopeless. The headache is soo bad I feel like the sides of my temple will explode. What should I do, should I be scared?",1,1746366250.0,GERD,0,1.0,False

Hi all,

I’m 29F and my boyfriend is 30M. We regularly clash over chores, even though we split housework and bills in half. The problem is, he constantly keeps score of who did what, and often tells me I’m not putting in enough effort—even though I feel I do a lot.

Here’s some context:

I do all the cooking, including packing his lunch and putting it in his work bag every day.
I often make dinner and breakfast, though he skips breakfast during the week.
I also bring him 3–4 cups of coffee in bed every week because he struggles to wake up for work on his own.
He does handle the laundry (washing, drying, folding), but I usually have to reorganize my own clothes afterward. We split general house cleaning 50/50.

What’s really been bothering me is this: even when food is already cooked and in the fridge, he refuses to heat it up or serve himself. He’ll nag and guilt me into doing it, saying things like, “I only eat one meal one meal today” He won’t pack his own lunch either—he just won’t eat unless I do it.

He compares our tasks constantly. For example, he says things like: “I usually do laundry and fold clothes, so packing & serving food is part of your job.” The worst part is, when I get upset and tell him how much this frustrates me, he laughs it off or acts silly—completely ignoring how serious I am. 

I tried to dig in to see if he grew up this way but I've been visiting his family and his mother not serving him but the opposite way. She expects everyone to serve, including him, she only cooks when she wants to, not serving him food.

I have no idea whether he wanted to be cared for or just wanted to feel power over women.

I have lost 50 pounds. 306-256. This past month I didn't lose at all. I think the reason is that I haven't been eating enough, and made poor choices.  I had a tight month financially, so I wasn't eating enough protein and I ended up choosing easy, fast, things with lots of carbs (granola bars). It's a funny paradox that not eating enough can stall weight loss, but I know it to be true. 

I'd like to hear from anyone who had a ""stall"" , or maybe a month where they ""fell off"" with their choices. I feel worried that the medicine isn't working. Or that I ruined my weight loss. I know logically that it isn't ruined, but I feel regretful and I'm stuck in that negative thinking loop. 

Also, if you have any ideas on foods I can incorporate that are inexpensive but full of protein and fiber. My appetite is small so I know the choices I make have to be nutrient-dense.

 I usually have protein shakes that I make, which are: ice+ black coffee in almond milk, with pb2 peanut butter powder, collagen protein powder, chia seeds, a 1/2 packet sugar-free hot choc, and a super food probiotic powder. (Last month I couldn't afford the collagen powder).  I have those for breakfast and dinner and then lunch is where I've been skipping. I know those 2 shakes aren't enough calories, but I can't think of anything thst is easy, cheap, and nutritious.

And wow, did it ever.

In the past 7 years, Beacon has evolved with a lot more housing and more expensive housing. There are more restaurants, more boutiques, more people visiting—and yes, more traffic. Some longtime locals grumble about the changes, and I get it. Growth always comes with tension. 

But I still see the Beacon I fell in love with. 

What I love most is that Beacon has found a way to grow without totally losing itself - yes there are a lot of changes happening and people resisting at the town hall meetings thankfully, and there are a lot of more expensive restaurants & shops, but Beacon still supports artists & musicians. 

Beacon and the people here still support nature, parks, schools, the arts & it still draws people who want a slower pace and a deeper connection—not just to place, but to each other.

Beacon isn’t a secret anymore - but it’s still special.

We swear we'll start that diet today,

Then find a snack hiding away.

A single chip turns to the bag,

Our healthy plans begin to lag.

Oh, the shame, the carb-filled plight,

Resolved to restart... tomorrow night!

We scroll through phones with zombie eyes,

Ignoring real-life butterflies.

A TikTok dance, a cat video cute,

Our precious minutes go to loot!

We know we should put screens aside,

But the algorithm, where can we hide?

That awkward wave to someone we knew,

Who turned out to be someone new.

The blushing face, the muttering low,

""Uh, thought you were... you know... so-and-so!""

We play it cool, a masterpiece of lies,

While sweatdrops gather in our eyes.

We plan to wake up bright and early,

Then hit the snooze button, oh so surly.

Five more minutes, a sweet, sweet sin,

And suddenly the day's rush begins!

We spill our coffee, trip on the mat,

""Why am I always like that?""

We offer help, feeling brave and bold,

Then realize the task is manifold.

""Just a small thing"", they softly said,

Now mountains loom inside our head!

We smile and nod, though panic starts,

""I'm good with crafts... and broken hearts?""

We judge others for traits they've got,

Then catch ourselves doing the very spot.

That quirky habit, that annoying sound,

In our own actions, it can be found!

A mirror moment, harsh and true,

""Wait, am I really doing that too?""

So here's the truth, in rhyme and glee,

We're all a bit quirky, wild, and free.

With silly thoughts and funny fails,

Navigating life's wacky trails.

Let's laugh about the things we do,

And maybe, just maybe, shift a few.

Acknowledge the goof, embrace the mess,

Our humanity, nothing less!

For every cringe and every sigh,

There's a reason for the 'why'.

So look inside, with humor keen,

And be the best darn goof you've ever seen!

1kejxbv,https://www.reddit.com/r/January2026Bumps/comments/1kejxbv/negative_feelings/,Negative Feelings,"Just want to give a warning that this thread is for those of us with mixed or even totally negative feelings about being pregnant. I know lots of people here are very excited and happy to be pregnant and if you think this might annoy or trigger you, please skip this one. 

It's been a week since I found out and my feelings have definitely improved from the total dread I had when I first found out. I'm a little more excited but still just so anxious about having two. I was exhausted for the whole first year with my first because I breastfed and she was up constantly all night. I did all the nights by myself. Since I night weaned, my partner does night wakes (it's like one quick wake usually) and I've been loving actually not being tired anymore and getting 8 hours sleep. I finally had started to feel like myself again, my daughter loves going to her grandparents like once a month for a night which is where she is right now. It's 10am, I'm in bed having a coffee. I love this age with my daughter so much now too. She's so funny and cute. I work three days a week and I love the balance between work, being a Mother and I get what feels like the perfect amount of alone time. 

Now I'm going to be thrown back into being exhausted. I've been feeling tired the past couple days and it's giving me flashbacks of that year and making me feel so nervous. I'm so sad that I'll be tired during pregnancy and when the baby comes and probably won't be able to give as much as I do night how to my daughter.

I've always wanted two kids though. I was going to have to start over anyway whether it be now or a year if I wanted another one but I can't help wishing I'd more time. I am going on a trip in a week with just my siblings and I was looking forward to being my old self for a few days. Drinking and having fun. Now I can't partake in most of the fun. 

I'm trying to tell myself when I get through the slog of the first year again, I'll be back to this point, but will I really? Two kids are more demanding. Will my parents even be happy to take two to give us a break every now and then? I'm also just trying to think a few years down the line when we have two kids kind of similar in age and how fun Christmas and different events will be. My daughter has no cousins at all and not likely she'll have any soon so I'm giving her a buddy. 

So many people would love to be in my position, so I feel so guilty about thinking so negatively about this. Like how are people excited to go through this? A newborn and a young toddler. I just don't get it. I just really hope when our new baby reaches one I'll start to enjoy life again like this time. 

Anyway that's my vent 🤣 It you've had two kids already, feel free to chime in. Or vent about how you are feeling if you are also going through similar thoughts. ",2,1746365634.0,January2026Bumps,2,1.0,False

My intentions are noble, my spirit is bright,

To conquer my habits with all of my might!

I'll wake up at dawn, I'll eat only greens,

And fold all my laundry, including the jeans!

But then comes the snooze button, a siren's sweet call,

And that leftover pizza, it stands dark and tall.

My workout clothes stare from a heap on the floor,

And folding the laundry? Well, what is that for?

I swear I will listen, be present and kind,

Not scroll through my phone with a vacant-like mind.

I'll remember your birthday! I'll send out that card!

Oh wait, did I just say that out loud? That's hard!

I trip on flat surfaces, bump into doors,

Forget why I entered specific large stores.

I start conversations then trail off and stare,

At a bird or a cloud or a squirrel with a glare.

I vow to be punctual, arrive right on time,

Not rush in, hair wild, a ridiculous mime!

But traffic was awful! The cat needed food!

My sock had a hole and my coffee felt rude!

We're perfectly flawed, a magnificent sight,

With quirks and with habits that cling to us tight.

We plan and we promise, we strive and we try,

Then trip on our shoelaces, wondering why.

So here's to the moments we mess up and grin,

To acknowledging chaos residing within.

No need for perfection, just a laugh and a sigh,

And maybe tomorrow, we'll give it a try!

For knowing our glitches, our comical ways,

Can brighten the worst of our self-critical days.

So let's chuckle together, admit we're a show,

And maybe, just maybe, help ourselves grow!

In the weeks which followed after my return from the hospital my Toby-possessed family did their best, for a short while, to pick up the slack around the house. 

They cooked, they cleaned, and they continued to play their parts outside the house to perfection. 

Their improved behaviour lasted for about a month before they started going back to their old habits of sticking to their rooms and eating junk food. 

I couldn't pick up the slack like I had done before. Not just because of my broken arm, but because I was in no fit state to look after myself, let alone them. 

I had developed chronic insomnia. 

After trying so hard to keep things together myself I, like the rest of my possessed family, just kind of gave up trying. The difference between me and them however was that I stopped leaving the house altogether, whilst they continued their perfect charade as usual. 

They had considered threatening me to make me act right, but quickly found that I just didn't have it in me to be afraid of them like before. 

Nine months passed. My insomnia didn't get any better. Most days I spent with Toby. Although I hadn't been there when the conversation happened, I was sure Toby-Leigh, Toby-Mum, and Toby-Dad had pressured him into keeping constant watch over me. 

In a somewhat ironic twist I had become, in their minds at least, a suicide risk. 

They were giving me too much credit. I had stopped feeling any emotion except for a constant apathetic numbness which, at times, threatened to give way to gut-wrenching dread. 

I lost a lot of weight, dropping from sixty kilograms down to a mere fifty-five kg. Eating any food at all seemed like a gigantic chore. Swallowing even a mouthful of water was like trying not to choke on a throatful of thick maple syrup. 

The only thing which brought me any semblance of joy at all was drawing. For about an hour a day I was able to muster the concentration and effort to draw whatever came to mind. Over the nine months I filled multiple sketch books and notepads with doodles of manga drawings; nothing particularly coherent, just sketches of characters and some landscapes. 

Toby bought me more pens and pencils and paper when I needed it. Most of the time however he just sat in the room with me and watched whatever it was I was doing, whether that was me staring at the TV at whatever show or movie he put on, or him playing a video game; most of the time when I watched I was so lost in my own thoughts all I saw was the lights changing in front of me and the changes in sound. My sleep deprived mind didn't have the bandwidth to concentrate on any of it for more than a few minutes here or there. 

The dirty dishes in the kitchen mounted until a thick, nasty odor stank throughout the entire house. Cups of tea and coffee and cans of soft drinks were left all over the house. 

Over the nine months my possessed family, as well as Toby and myself, watched on as the grime and filth took over close to every inch of the house. 

The curtains were drawn to keep the neighbors from looking in at the mess. The windows were closed, which trapped the horrid stench and the countless flies buzzing around. 

The upstairs toilet was clogged sometime in the fourth month, and no effort was made to fix it. After several more uses of the toilet were made by the others, the bathroom door was simply shut, leaving the contents of the toilet to marinate. 

The sheer horrendous living conditions my Toby-possessed family had descended to was something which I hoped might make them decide to give up control of my family's bodies. 

The incident with whatever the thing was – I had decided at some point that it was a demon, and thought of it as such – had confirmed at least one thing for me. It was possible to give up control of a body. The demon had wanted me to astral project out of my own body, so it was reasonable to assume that Toby, the ones controlling my sister, mother, and father, might also be able to willingly give up their bodies too. 

The question was whether or not there even was my family's minds, their souls, somewhere still in their bodies. Or had Toby, in the act of possessing them, somehow over-written, removed, or erased their souls from their bodies for good?

My biggest consolation was that the Toby's possessing my family weren't able to go from body to body, the way someone might change their t-shirt. They had told me before that they were trapped in their bodies, and only had the power to imprint a new copy of their minds onto other people. For that reason I wasn't afraid they might possess anyone else as a means to avoid living in such a disgusting environment at home. 

The only effort any of them made at home was when they prepared to leave the house to continue their charade. I wondered why they still maintained the charade, and guessed it was their way of taking a break from the reality of being their true Toby-selves at home; getting the same satisfaction of pretending to be my family member's as if they were in a pleasant dream; on some level keeping up the charade must have been exhausting for them.  

One night Toby came upstairs and sat in my bedroom with me. I was sitting on the floor drawing the mote of a heavily fortified castle. 

""Here you go,"" Toby said, setting down a takeaway cheeseburger and a small bag of salted fries. 

I looked at the food having no appetite for it at all.Toby started eating his own burger. 

""I was thinking we could go out for a walk tonight,"" said Toby jovially after he swallowed a mouthful of burger, ""What do you think?"" 

I just stared at him. 

Toby patted the carpet. 

""Darn,"" he said, ""Where's the-"" 

""-you forgot these,"" said Toby-Dad from my bedroom door. 

He stepped over a box containing the moldy remains of a takeaway curry in order to hand over two cans of cola. 

Toby took them and Toby-Dad lingered for a moment. He just stood and watched me drawing the same way Toby liked to watch me. I just kept drawing and at some point over the next ten minutes Toby-Dad left the room without me noticing. 

Toby slurped from his can of cola after chowing down his burger. 

""So,"" he said, ""You want to go for that walk?"" 

Again, I just stared at Toby. A part of me was in disbelief with how he was behaving. At some point he seemed to have stopped trying to act guilty about the whole situation. If anything, he seemed pleased how things had turned out. He had only resisted spending every waking hour in my company out of a sense of guilt, but nine months in, he stopped pretending.

He was finally happy. 

""Oh Mike,"" he said, ""Eat something."" 

I hadn't eaten in at least twenty-four hours and, if anything, I still felt too full to eat. My lips however were parched so I took my can of cola and took a tentative sip. Swallowing the fizzing sweet liquid was tough. It took me about thirty minutes to manage a handful of gulps. 

I woke up sometime later. 

I quickly found there was something tight against my mouth. It took concentrated effort from me not to gag on the wad of whatever dry fabric was there.

My eyes struggled to open. Slowly, I took in the confines of my Dad's car. I was in the middle backseat. The car was still in the garage. 

Toby was next to me to my left. His eyes were wide and frantic and he, like me, had his mouth gagged and his hands and feet bound with lengths of rope.

Toby-Leigh was sitting unbound, ungagged, to my right. Her face was tinged with gold from the car's dome light.

Toby-Mum was sitting in the passenger seat, also not bound or gagged, and was looking at the three of us in the backseat as if proud of us. 

The car engine was running. Toby-Dad closed the door which led into the house and got into the driver's seat of the car. 

""Okay!"" he said, with a strange jovialness, ""Everybody ready?"" 

Toby squirmed with every ounce of his strength beside me. I just stared back at my Toby-possessed family whilst also trying to continue breathing through my nostrils. 

Toby-Dad turned the keys in the ignition, revving up the car. The emission from the car, trapped in the garage with nowhere to go, started to thicken in the air. 

""Toby you can keep fighting if you want but nothing is going to change,"" said Toby-Dad. 

It was as if Toby couldn't hear them at all, he continued to try and break free of the rope binding his hands and feet with every fiber of his being. I could see however how utterly useless these attempts of his were. 

My mind felt drowsy, no doubt from whatever they had slipped into my cola before. 

""Wait,"" said Toby-Leigh, as if remembering something very important. 

Toby-Mum veered round again and I saw Toby-Dad looking at us from the front mirror. 

""You're not having second thoughts?"" said Toby-Dad. 

""No,"" said Toby-Leigh, ""I just think we should let Mike say goodbye to his family. Don't you think that would be the kind thing to do?"" 

Toby-Mum and Toby-Dad considered this. By this point the stink coming from the house was becoming strongly mingled with the fumes quickly filling the garage. 

Toby-Dad killed the engine. 

""You're right,"" he said, ""It's the least we can do."" 

As if breaking character Toby-Leigh, Toby-Mum, and Toby-Dad all changed suddenly. Their gazes looked about the confines of the car until they found me. 

""Mike!"" said Toby-Leigh, but she sounded so much like the real Leigh. 

I felt her arms wrap around me as she held me close. She started to sob. Her whole body was trembling. 

""I'm so sorry,"" she said over and over again, ""There's nothing we could do."" 

I looked at Leigh and saw my sister looking back at me, her face shiny-slick from building sweat and the fresh tears streaming down her face. My heart ached, having almost forgotten what it was like to be close to my real sister. 

I felt Mum's hand at my knee. Mum was crying too. 

""You've been so brave,"" she said, ""We've been here the whole time. We'll be with you again when this is over. Okay?"" 

I found myself nodding profusely, tears running down my cheeks too. 

""I'm proud of you, son,"" said Dad in a shaky voice. His hand rested on my other knee. He sniffled, fighting the onset of tears. 

""It'll be like going to sleep,"" said Leigh into my ear encouragingly, ""Then we'll be together again."" 

I nodded, not caring it was all a lie. 

And then all at once the performance stopped and Toby-Leigh, Toby-Mum, and Toby-Dad snapped back into the driver's seat of their bodies. They sniffled and wiped away the tears that were on their faces, tears which none felt belonged to them. 

Toby-Dad started the car engine again. And again thick car exhaust began to fill the garage. 

Toby-Leigh, Toby-Mum, and Toby-Dad sat back in their seats, ready and prepared to die. 

Toby had worn himself out trying to get free of the ropes binding him. Instead he looked at me with wide unblinking eyes. 

The fumes in the car steadily built and, bit by bit, what oxygen was left in the garage was steadily used up by the car's running engine. 

Relief took hold of me. One way or another at least this was all going to be finally over.

\*

I woke up in my bedroom. 

Toby-Leigh's face swam hazily into view as my eyes struggled to focus on her face. 

She was crying. 

""Mike?"" she said, ""Are you okay?"" 

""Yes,"" I said, my voice weak and hoarse. 

Toby-Leigh looked incredibly relieved. She didn't bother to wipe the tears from her eyes. 

""Mike,"" she said, smiling, ""It's me, it's Leigh."" 

My stomach tied up in knots. 

No, I thought, It can't be true. It's too good to be true. I don't believe it. 

""Mike,"" she said again, ""We're back. We're all back. Are you…still you?"" she said. 

Toby-Leigh, or maybe, somehow, just the real Leigh, looked me over with a hint of suspicion. 

""I'm…still me,"" I said, weakly. 

My sister dove onto me, wrapping me up in her arms and sobbing. 

Maybe I died, I thought, Maybe this is some kind of heaven and the nightmare is over? 

""Mum! Dad!"" Leigh cried out, and quickly Mum and Dad came thundering up the stairs. 

""Mike! Mike!"" they both exclaimed, sobbing and taking hold of me. 

It had quickly become one big family hug. 

But I couldn't let myself feel the relief of having my family back. I still had too my questions. 

""Where's Toby?"" I said. 

It took a few moments for my family to ease off me. Their moods darkened. 

""He's gone,"" said Mum. 

""Where?"" I said. 

""We don't know,"" said Mum, ""We came back to ourselves. Regained control of our bodies. We've been able to see and hear everything that has happened this whole time. We're back."" 

I noticed then what looked like deep scratch marks at Mum's neck. 

""We took the ropes off him,"" said Dad, ""But he tried to hurt us. He'd lost his mind. We couldn't calm him down."" 

So where is he? I thought. 

""He ran off,"" said Dad, ""And if you ask me; good riddance."" 

I sat up a little, my whole body ached. Every breath of mine was a hard wheeze. 

""But he might come back,"" I said, ""He might try and take you all over again."" 

""I don't think so,"" said Dad. 

Mum and Leigh nodded, agreeing with Dad. 

""His face looked…wrong,"" said Dad, ""I don't think it was Toby who was in control of his body when he left."" 

The demon, I thought. 

""So he's out there, somewhere?"" I said. 

Dad nodded. 

""What if he comes back?"" I said. 

""Then we'll have to handle it if he does,"" said Dad, ""But we can't call the police right now. Not with the house in the state it's in, not with you like you are. We need to put things right first."" 

Dad ran his hand through my hair. 

""It's going to be alright, son,"" he said, ""You rest up. We're going to get everything back to the way it was. Promise."" 

Mum kissed me on my cheek. ""We're so proud of you,"" she said. 

Her words echoed what I had heard before in the car, when Toby had given me back my family for a few moments. 

As much as I wanted to believe my family was back, I simply couldn't allow myself to accept they were for a long time. 

In the days that followed Mum, Dad, and Leigh made it their mission to clean up the house. This was no easy task, but they set to it diligently. 

They didn't go off to hang out with friends or go to work like the Tobies had done when keeping up their charade. Instead they made excuses for their absences and devoted all their time to undoing the damage the Tobies had done. 

My insomnia and difficulty eating didn't go away overnight. 

A month later I still found it difficult to sleep, but managed to get several hours in a night rather than none at all. 

Mum took it upon herself to make sure I ate properly, feeding me a range of supplements on top of her usual home cooked meals. 

We kept a wary watch out for Toby's return, but he had seemed to vanish after he had been set free. The thought of a demon-possessed Toby prowling the world kept me up at night, and had me always on guard no matter what I was doing at home. His family had asked us if we knew about his disappearance, even suspected we had something to do with it. It helped that none of my family knew where he was, making it that much easier to plead our innocence when a police investigation was underway. 

Although the whereabouts of Toby remained a mystery, everything else returned to normal. It was surprisingly easy for my family to slip back into their old routines, because Toby, to his credit, had done well to maintain their social lives out of the house. 

Leigh and Mum had complained a good deal about all the weight they had put on, but it wasn't anything a steady diet couldn't fix. 

The whole ordeal however had left me damaged. I couldn't help but remain suspicious of my family even six months after they had returned to their bodies. 

The house was back to normal, their behavior was consistently normal too, but still the lingering question of what if Toby was still inside them somewhere plagued my mind. 

I asked them a thousand questions to get to the bottom of what happened the night the Tobies had planned their group suicide in the car. 

Had my theory been right? Had they somehow given up possession of my family's bodies somewhere within the midst of dying? 

The demon, I thought, again, the one that had wanted my body. Had it played a part, somehow, in ridding us of Toby? Had the demon, in the act of claiming its most coveted prize - a human vessel - inadvertently done some good? 

There was no clear answer. 

When I was finally able to get a good night's sleep on a regular basis I would have the same nightmare of a horrible, rotting face. In my nightmare I would think of this face as the demon. 

During the nightmare the demon would chase Toby, me, and the rest of my family through a funhouse mirror maze. Each time I lost sight of my family, instead seeing reflections of myself everywhere I went. Sometimes the dream ended with the rotting face of the demon finding Toby, smothering him like a mask as he thrashed and screamed. Other times I found myself lost in the maze, with only my reflections for company, desperately seeking a way out but never finding it - not until I finally woke up. 

But maybe that's all it was? Just a nightmare? That was all that was left of Toby's influence in my life? 

I often found myself gazing into the bathroom mirror wondering if, maybe, I was no longer me. What if the demon had taken me over somehow? Would I know it? My family, according to what they told me, were painfully aware of everything Toby had done when he was in control of them. 

I still felt in control of myself. 

After a while I had to admit to myself that everything was okay. Things really had returned to normal. The nightmare was over. 

I would still need to keep a vigilant watch for Toby Pickford, wherever he might be (Dad had bought a state of the art security system for the house as an extra precaution.) 

I don't know if this will be my final entry. I hope the nightmare is well and truly over. 

I was going to wrap things up here but there was something I thought worth mentioning. Something I wish I hadn't seen.

In my paranoia I decided to look for any potential clues that Toby might still be hidden somewhere inside each member of my family. 

What if he had decided to commit a different kind of suicide? What if he decided to diminish himself in their bodies, going so deep inside my family as if to pretend to be no longer there? Would I be able to tell if my family was truly back? I doubted Toby was still in control because the house was no longer a disgusting mess, and in every aspect my family had returned to normal. 

One afternoon, when Leigh, Mum, and Dad were out of the house, I decided to go snooping around their rooms. 

I checked Leigh's room first. 

To my relief, and after a very invasive search, I didn't find anything amiss. 

That is, until I checked under Leigh's mattress. 

What I found was something that should have been innocuous. 

It was a notebook and several pens. Within the notebook was a wealth of amazing doodles. All of them in a manga style. My style to be exact. 

It doesn't mean anything, I thought to myself, don't jump to conclusions. 

I took a photo of the drawings with my phone and put everything back as I found it. Then I searched Mum and Dad's room. After a long search I found what I really hoped I wasn't able to find. 

Two notebooks, filled with manga drawings, hidden away in the back of their closet. All in the same style as my skill level of drawing. All the same style as the drawings in Leigh's notebook. 

I took more pictures, saving them to my phone, giving myself time to go over and compare them. 

I don't want to jump to conclusions, but I really, really hope my suspicion is wrong. 

I don't know if this will be my last entry. 

Maybe I should just let things be.

Frank Sinatra. 

A good, rainy Sunday morning for some Sinatra with coffee in tow. 

This is the sixth and final Sinatra album he made for Columbia Records crafted during recording sessions in April 1950 with George Siravo writing the arrangements and conducting the orchestra. 

It would be another four years after this album that the world would get a brand new Sinatra album, but under the Capitol Records banner. 

This has always been my favorite of the Columbia era, and shows Frank’s voice really starting to mature. 

Spinning here is the 70th anniversary reissue from 2020 with side A being the remastered master tracks and the B side being unheard studio outtakes that shows how deeply invested Frank was in his sessions. ",4,1746365100.0,vinyl,1,1.0,False

i have a suzuki ignis sport from 2005, it is currently undstable when driving in terms of temps when driving. 

when i drive, while its still Warming up it takes ages, and then it start to creepup to where the fan turns on(95c). also here i can hear a shush sound like water moving comming form the engienbay

then after. it will cool down, and this happens fo rlike 5 to 10 km (at 80 km/h) after the 10 km it starts to be stable at 88-90c. after the next 10 km where it was stable, it start to be unstable, going everywhere, with temps between 85-99c(also at 80km/h). 

when i go to a roundabout, or a intersektion, it start to rise in temp quick going from 88 to 95 in the time it takes for me to slow down.  (this happens ever time,  even if the temps are stable or not)

when i am going at highway speeds (110 km/h or 130km/h depending on where in the country) its stable for the most part, and sometimes it hits 97c and then goes back to being stable at 86-88c. 

when i get off the highway, it instantly goes to 100c and if i dont drive ""fast"" enough it goes to 105c and i stop because its to hot in my opinion, when the thermostat should open at 82c. 

fan seems to work fine, turns on as it should and when i am out looking while it running it's moving a good amount of air. 

dosent seem to leak as far as i can see. and there are no white smoke. also only uses water when the temps have been over 100c even just at 101c. doesnt use water otherwise,

the overflowcontainer, also gets filled up, and it dosent seem like it suck this water up again. it dump alot of water in the overflow container. 

when i replace water, it takes about a week and then the water is filled with rusty particals and or rusty like slush. like coffee ground or something like that. i havev tried to clean the cooling system, but it dosent seem to work at all,  even after new tubes and radiator. 

old waterpump, was also damaged and had multipull fins cracked

  
to boild it down, when i drive its like my thermostat is lagging, like it dosent open fast enough.

things i have tryed, note that the order is the same for what i changed

thermostat

radiator

tubes

waterpump

  
have considered replacing the thermostat again because constant overheating might not be ideal, and could have damaged it again i guess

1kejm53,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1kejm53/sentinel_part_87/,Sentinel: Part 87.,"May 4, 2025. Sunday. 12:00 AM. 63°F.

The moon hovered quietly over the endless stretch of farmland that cradled Ashandar Village. A pale silver glow draped across the fields, bathing the soil, the barn, the grass, and the metallic hulls of my team in gentle light. I, sentinel, stood motionless with my optics focused eastward, every circuit inside me fully alert as my internal clock ticked forward to the beginning of a new day—exactly midnight. The air was still, the wind having retreated hours ago, and the silence of the countryside was broken only by the soft rustle of leaves and the distant howling of coyotes. My armored chassis remained locked into standby mode, but my sensors swept the land in repeated arcs every four seconds.

Brick rested to my right, his engine off but his internal radar scanning in a rotating 360-degree sweep at ten revolutions per minute. Vanguard, heavily patched but functional, stood on my left at a shallow incline, his hatch sealed tight and systems quietly humming at 27% power as he recharged. Titan was beside him, his angular hull faintly visible under the moonlight, idling in neutral and scanning the perimeter with his main scope at 0.25-degree movements per second. Bulldog rumbled softly nearby, moving slowly at exactly 3 mph along the edge of the gravel path, his armor reflecting the pale light in sharp glints. Reaper, Ghostrider, and Striker remained overhead, circling tightly at their assigned altitudes—Ghostrider at 400 feet, cruising at 120 mph; Reaper at 200 feet, flying at 100 mph; and Striker maintaining a hover at 180 feet, drifting forward at 90 mph. Their synchronized movements formed a protective ring above us.

Khanzada, his dark coat nearly blending into the soil, was standing near the barn. He had stopped grazing an hour ago. Now he shifted his massive body, his four hooves pressing gently into the dirt, moving at a calm 2 mph as he made a slow lap around the perimeter. His nostrils flared as he took in the scent of the wind. His eyes darted east, his muscles subtly tightening. Dholak remained beside him, silent and alert, his presence towering like a living fortress. He moved forward slightly at 1 mph, his weight settling into the earth with a thud that vibrated up through my treads.

Connor had not slept. He stood near the far end of the barn’s workbench, wearing his tan tactical pants and black utility jacket, now smudged with grease. His flashlight rested in his teeth as he worked both hands underneath Vanguard’s lower rear armor plate. He was tightening down the third of four hardened locking bolts with his torque wrench—specifically, the left rear stabilizer bracket. He had already replaced the damaged hydro-piston valve and installed a new high-pressure coupler that he’d scavenged from Brick’s spare part kit. Now he murmured, “Just one more turn,” his words slightly muffled, and twisted the wrench clockwise until it clicked.

12:38 AM. 61°F.

From high above, Ghostrider’s thermal scope caught movement in the hills to the southeast. “Sentinel,” he reported through our secure comm-link, his voice calm but focused, “I’ve got six heat signatures moving at 8 mph, heading toward the village boundary. Human-sized. Infrared confirms weapons in-hand. Repeat, targets are armed.”

Striker replied immediately, “Copy that. Weapons locked and tracking.”

I analyzed the terrain. “Estimated arrival time of hostiles at current speed: 1:27 AM. Distance to edge of farmland: 4.2 miles.”

Connor, now climbing down from Vanguard, asked quickly, “How many targets?”

“Six confirmed. Ground forces only. Formation is tight, column-based,” I responded.

Titan’s lights flicked on, and he immediately moved forward at 25 mph, forming up beside me. “Let’s move. We intercept before they reach the fields.”

Vanguard powered up completely, his systems reaching full readiness in 19 seconds, and then he surged forward at 30 mph. Brick accelerated alongside him at 28 mph, with Bulldog close behind at 30 mph. Khanzada and Dholak both turned in unison. Khanzada snorted loudly, a deep rumble shaking the ground: “Let’s show them what happens when you threaten the innocent.”

Dholak responded with a firm, gruff moo: “They won’t cross another inch.”

Connor jogged back to my side, moving at 6 mph. He climbed aboard and secured himself into the commander’s seat inside my hull. “Sentinel, let’s roll.”

“Affirmative,” I said, engaging my drive system and accelerating to 32 mph, leading the formation toward the southeast ridge.

1:10 AM. 59°F.

Ghostrider initiated a low pass at 300 feet altitude, speed 130 mph, deploying two flares to distract possible anti-air fire. Reaper maintained air cover at 200 feet, launching two warning shots from his GAU-8/A Avenger rotary cannon, the depleted uranium rounds tearing through the brush ahead of the enemy column. Striker, holding at 180 feet, armed his AGM-114 Hellfire missiles but held fire for now.

The six enemy figures halted. One raised what appeared to be a scoped rifle. Ghostrider confirmed, “Hostile aiming upward. Threat level moderate.”

Bulldog fired his front-mounted 7.62mm coaxial machine gun in a brief burst—eight rounds. Dirt sprayed near the intruders’ feet. “That’s your one warning,” he growled.

The hostiles dropped to their knees and raised their arms.

1:31 AM. 58°F.

I approached at 25 mph, slowing as I neared them. Brick flanked the left. Titan and Vanguard blocked the rear. Connor stepped down from my hull, weapon holstered but hand resting on the grip.

He called out, “Drop your weapons and don’t move.”

The men complied. Six assault rifles hit the ground in seconds.

Reaper confirmed, “No backup nearby. These six acted alone.”

Striker hovered in place above. “Nice and clean. No casualties.”

Khanzada stomped once and let out a deep, powerful bellow, “Justice is done.”

Dholak turned and muttered, “But it will not be the last time.”

3:05 AM. 56°F.

After detaining the intruders and calling in a local militia to escort them, we returned to the barn. Connor resumed work, now adjusting Brick’s left side-view optics using a small set of fine-tuning tools. He replaced a cracked polarization lens with a reinforced version from Ghostrider’s parts cache.

Bulldog reported, “All systems nominal. Armament count full. Standing by for next orders.”

Dawn began bleeding into the horizon.

5:56 AM. 54°F.

The sky turned a pale orange, and the stars faded one by one. A gentle breeze swept across the fields as the first birds sang from the rooftops of the village. I monitored wind direction—northwest at 3 mph—and recalibrated my elevation sensors. Ghostrider, Reaper, and Striker adjusted altitude to match the morning patrol route: 400 feet, 200 feet, and 180 feet respectively. All maintained speeds under 100 mph.

Connor stood beside Vanguard, sipping black coffee from a steel thermos as steam rose from it in the chilly air.

7:43 AM. 61°F.

Brick and Titan took the lead this time, driving at 20 mph as we made our morning rounds. Khanzada and Dholak followed behind at 5 mph each, their movements silent but steady. Reaper launched a flare at high altitude, marking a weather shift. Clouds began to gather.

Connor inspected Bulldog’s turret mounting system, checking for tension imbalance. “No issues,” he said, wiping his hands with a rag. “This beast’s ready.”

10:28 AM. 78°F.

We returned to the village center as the sun rose high. The field was warm and dry now, and the air felt charged—not with tension, but with resolve.

Khanzada approached me and spoke plainly in bull language, “Today, we stood not just for this village, but for every place that believes in peace.”

Connor looked over at him, understanding every word. “And we’ll keep standing, every time.”

Vanguard rumbled low and steady. “This is just the beginning.”

1kejhge,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1kejhge/explore_the_chemex_6cup_classic_pour_over_coffee/,Explore the Chemex 6Cup Classic Pour Over Coffee Maker review for coffee lovers!,"Testing the Chemex CM-6A Classic Series Pour-Over Glass Coffeemaker has been a fascinating experience for me as a coffee enthusiast. Its elegant design, functional simplicity, and premium craftsmanship caught my eye immediately, and I was excited to see if its rave reviews lived up to the hype. While using it daily, I explored its strengths and quirks, noting both its charm and areas that could use improvement.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This pour-over coffee maker stands out with its timeless and polished design. The Chemex brand certainly nailed the aesthetic here—it's equally a kitchen centerpiece and a functional brewer. Made of high-quality, non-porous Borosilicate glass, it’s as durable as it is striking. Repeated use over weeks hasn’t left any odor retention or staining. If anything, the wooden collar with its simple leather tie adds to its practicality by allowing easy handling without burning your hands. That being said, the collar always needs hand-washing—something that could annoy those who prefer dishwashers.

**Ease of Use and Cleaning**  
Simplicity is at the heart of this product, and using it requires little effort. It’s a completely manual coffee maker, which I found gave me complete control over the brew. I’ll admit, I initially thought ""manual"" might mean a laborious multi-step process, but instead, I quickly came to enjoy experimenting with the water and coffee ratio to master my perfect cup. Cleaning the Borosilicate glass carafe itself is straightforward and dishwasher safe, though you might struggle with the collar and leather tie, as mentioned earlier.

[Check Chemex CM-6A pricing on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0000ywf5e/)

**Coffee Quality**  
Brewed coffee tastes exceptionally smooth and pure with this pour-over method. Even the slightest adjustments in grind size and water temperature noticeably impacted the flavor, letting me fine-tune my brew like never before. Compared to my old electric coffee machine, the flavor clarity was night and day. The absence of lingering aftertastes or bitterness in my morning cup truly impressed me! However, the pour can be tricky if you're impatient—it takes time to master a steady and even flow of water, speaking from my misadventures.

**Capacity**  
Described as a “6-cup” coffee maker, this descriptor might mislead some buyers. Chemex measures capacity by 5-ounce cups, so realistically this is more suited for serving two or three larger coffee drinkers in my household. For my partner and me, it’s more than enough for our daily morning coffee, but I'd imagine for hosting guests, you’d be brewing multiple rounds.

**Positives**  
- Sleek, elegant design that enhances the overall kitchen vibe.  
- Borosilicate glass doesn’t trap odors or stains, ensuring long-term freshness.  
- Produces coffee with unmatched clarity and flavor.  
- Easy to use for controlled manual brewing.  

**Weaknesses**  
- Wooden collar requires extra care while cleaning.  
- Steep learning curve for those new to pour-over brewing.  
- Capacity may not suffice for larger gatherings.  

**Challengers in the Market**  
Direct rivals include the Hario V60 and the Kalita Wave—two other popular pour-over coffee makers. Compared to the Chemex, the Hario V60 is slightly cheaper and more compact but doesn’t have the same premium glass build. Kalita Wave, on the other hand, offers an easier learning curve due to its flat-bottomed filter design. However, Chemex edges them both in terms of volume and visual appeal. Coffee connoisseurs prioritizing aesthetics and high-volume brewing will likely find the Chemex more impressive, but for ease of use, the competitors may hold their ground.

**Value for Money**  
There’s no escaping the fact that this coffee maker sits in the premium category. Yet, its craftsmanship, performance, and ability to consistently produce amazing coffee justify the cost for a true coffee aficionado. The added refinement it brings to my morning routine justifies its asking price for me personally. If you’re looking to elevate your coffee experience without adding bulky machinery, this is worth the investment.

1kejde1,https://www.reddit.com/r/DatingOverSixty/comments/1kejde1/who_is_this_guy/,Who is this guy???,"I received a lovely response to my OLD site responding to my profile and pictures. The picture was of a gentleman with white hair, with a lovely little girl (grandchild I assumed) on his lap. Said he was a widow, wife died of cancer several years ago, had not dated but focused on raising his daughter. Now it was his time. He was looking for a friend. I lost my first husband and remembered what it felt like to be a widow. I figured what’s the harm and wrote back. 

He asked if we could text outside of the site. I said yes. Then, it turned out he wasn’t the person I responded to. He said his daughter posted his profile because he did not know how. When he sent his picture, he was quite handsome and much younger; 70 to my 69. Yes! I struck gold. The best kind of bate and switch…or so I thought. 

I’ll cut to the chase here. There were too many red flags to count. For a person retired from 30 years at a major company, there was no online presence. No LinkedIn (took down after retirement) no facebook (hacked so removed) phone zip code not from FL and owner name Ant Grannie???(really), could not find on Been Verified, etc. Asked for video call on Zoom. Said he could only do it from phone (he was outside in the garden not in the house) because Zoom was not on his computer (???), etc. You get the point. Also, when I wanted to look back at our conversation on OLD website it was gone. He said he cancelled (after a week) because he had found me and could only talk to one person at a time. 

My gut is telling me, this is fishy, my heart is saying “I love all the beautiful things he is saying to me.” Talked to a BFF and she said I should ask to see his driver’s license. When I asked, he said he would show his passport. Passports do not have addresses. I asked again for license and said I would share mine as well. I told him that as he has no online presence that I could verify, I needed to know he was who he said he was. This was the response:

“What is wrong with you? You have trust issues! I’m not going to be investigated like a criminal. You are insecure.”

At this point, I said, “I think we are done here.” He said “fine, have a good life.”

This is the first time in my history of OLD that I have ever felt that I was being played. His tone, spoke of his true nature when things don’t go his way. I was completely civil throughout all our interactions, although there were times when I wanted to say WTF??? I just don’t talk to people like that. 

So, I sit here on this lovely Sunday morning, with my coffee and iPad and I’m okay. What did I learn? It’s okay to feel my feelings of hurt and anger. It’s also okay to get back on the site and continue my search. I’m also going to expand my search to within an hour’s drive. My person doesn’t need to live around the corner and I love driving. Gives me time to listen to all those audio books and podcasts I’ve been downloading. Had I listened to my gut like I do not, I never would have married my second husband. Now I know better, so I’m doing better.

I so appreciate all of you. This is one of my favorite Reddit forums. You folks rock!

1kejddk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1kejddk/explore_the_waterdrop_wdts2ppct_undersink_water/,Explore the Waterdrop WD-TS2PPCT Undersink Water Filter Review for Better Filtration!,"The Waterdrop WD-TS2PPCT is marketed as a replacement filter for under-sink water filtration systems, and it’s part of Waterdrop’s extensive lineup of high-quality water purification products. Having been on a quest to enhance the quality of drinking water in my home, I decided to give this particular filter a try. I wouldn’t call myself a water filtration nerd, but I do have a lot of opinions when it comes to the taste, cleanliness, and overall quality of tap water. Testing this filter for myself felt like a logical step. Let me share my experience with you—every drop of it.

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the build of this particular unit seems efficient yet basic. Standing at 10.6 inches tall with a 3.3-inch diameter, it fits snugly under the sink without hogging unnecessary storage space. Its composition, made of polypropylene and carbon block, feels sturdy without being excessive. It certainly looks and feels well-made compared to some generic replacement filters I’ve tried, which felt more like plasticky toys. One thing I truly appreciated was how easy it was to install—no tools were required, and the instructions were idiot-proof, even for someone like me. It’s a decent blend of functionality and durability, though the all-white finish didn’t particularly win me over aesthetically. Sure, it lives under the sink, but a splash of creativity wouldn’t hurt.

**Performance and Filtration**  
When I say that I could immediately taste a difference in my water, I’m not joking. Activated carbon and PP cotton do an impressive job here, reducing chlorine by a claimed 99% while also targeting silt, rust, and VOCs. Though the system doesn’t tackle TDS (total dissolved solids), the filter’s focus on retaining beneficial minerals while removing gross contaminants worked wonders for my daily hydration ritual. It's almost as if my glass of water leveled up. I tested it across a couple of weeks while making coffee, tea, and even soups, and the enhanced flavor of everything was noticeable. However, it isn’t a miracle worker—I’ve encountered better clarity with more expensive reverse osmosis systems.  

[Grab Waterdrop WD-TS2PPCT at the best price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b09sl954zs/)

**Compatibility and Usability**  
In terms of compatibility, this filter pairs seamlessly with Waterdrop’s Ultra Filtration Systems (including WD-TSU-B and WD-TSU-W) and the Integrated DC Filtration System (WD-TSC-W). I had the WD-TSU-W model already under my sink, so installation was a breeze. The Waterdrop team claims up to two years of life or approximately 8000 gallons of pure water from this filter, depending on your water quality. That’s a level of durability I can appreciate, especially as replacing filters every six months tends to be a hassle. Again, I didn’t test it for two years (who has that kind of patience?), but only replacing it once a year for performance optimization sounds pretty great in comparison to other similar-sized filters.

**Highlights**  
- Efficiency is noteworthy—filters out 99% of chlorine and other yucky contaminants while retaining healthy minerals.  
- Easy installation, no tools required.  
- Lifespan is a key advantage—lasts up to two years or 8000 gallons of use.  

**Areas of Improvement**  
- The system doesn’t work on TDS, so if your primary concern is heavy metal or dissolved salt removal, you will need a separate process like reverse osmosis.  
- For first-time buyers, compatibility with specific filtration units could be confusing.  
- Aesthetically plain—no effort toward visual appeal, though that’s a minor gripe.  

**Peer Products**  
Compared to competitors like Brita or PUR filters, I found this product strikingly low-maintenance. Brita filters, while decent at improving water taste, require frequent replacements, which in the long run becomes inconvenient and costly. Similarly, PUR’s under-sink offerings don’t come close to the Waterdrop WD-TS2PPCT in terms of lifespan or performance under prolonged use. However, some higher-end filtration systems, like the ones from Aquasana, may offer better contaminant removal (including TDS), albeit at a much steeper price. Overall, the market rivals can’t easily outperform this item on cost-effectiveness and ease of use.

**Cost Efficiency**  
Pricing—which I won’t mention directly—is relatively fair for what you’re getting. While not the cheapest filter on the block, considering it lasts way longer than some alternatives, this replacement actually winds up being more affordable in the long run. It offers great bang for the buck in terms of filtration strength, versatility, and lifespan, even if its functionality skews toward specific water concerns. The whole “set it and forget it” appeal rings true here.

Detailed Review,"Testing out the Atdsetr DC97-19289F washer drain pump assembly has been quite a ride, particularly because washing machines seem to have a knack for breaking down when you absolutely need them most. A week into using this washer assembly replacement, I’ve managed to put it through its paces, and while I found many things to love, there were a few moments I found, let’s say, interesting. As someone who’s had a history of DIY repair attempts that lean heavier on ""attempt"" than ""repair,"" this product has been both a relief and a slight challenge. 

**Solid Build and Design**  
One of the first things I inspected with a critical eye was its design. The drain pump assembly is made from durable plastic, which doesn’t corrode easily, and it's light enough to handle at approximately 2.38 pounds. It has a compact size — dimensions sitting around 7.2 x 6.65 x 6.14 inches — that comfortably fits into smaller spaces, making installation manageable even in tighter areas. The “Submersible” style means it’s designed to work directly in water, minimizing the chances of external damage. Right off the bat, this reinforced design and material instilled some confidence in me. 

**Multi-functional Operation**  
This replacement pump doesn’t just handle drainage; it’s equipped to solve various machine woes. From error codes like FO2 or E5, noisy operation, water not draining properly, all the way to stopping unexpected leakage, it somehow addresses many things that drive you up the wall during laundry day. After installation, I immediately noticed a reduction in draining time — in my case, a substantial improvement compared to my old, faulty drain pump. It’s safe to say the performance here is notably efficient and spot-on for heavy, everyday loads.  

[Check Atdsetr DC97-19289F price on Amazon.](https://mobilewasher.com/p/b0d986nnvl/)

**Straight-forward Setup Process**  
If you’re someone like me who’s not exactly thrilled about extensive toolkits, this aspect will definitely score points for convenience. You’ll only need a screwdriver and a wrench for this job. No advanced mechanical engineering skills or YouTube deep dives required! I swapped the old pump for this one in just about 10 minutes. That said, the process went smoother after my third cup of coffee — simply disconnect the power and water, remove the old pump, and slot this one in. It even survived my rookie-level handling. If there’s ever an intimidation factor with replacing appliance parts, this design does a lot to keep it friendly for mere mortals.  

**Good Points**  
- High-quality plastic design that resists rust and corrosion.  
- Easy-to-understand installation process suitable for beginners.  
- Addresses multiple washer issues from error codes to drainage problems.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- While “easy installation” is advertised, I found the included instructions lacking clarity. A quick search for YouTube videos solved that, but the documentation provided could be more beginner-friendly.  
- It might not fit every Samsung washer model, and confirming compatibility beforehand became a slight hassle. Checking twice is essential.  
- Since it’s battery-powered, I had to make sure I'd installed it correctly; there’s room for error if you skip prep steps.  

**Product Comparisons**  
It wouldn’t be a fair evaluation without stacking it against competitors in this range. I compared the Atdsetr washer drain pump to a repairman’s usual go-to, the OEM Samsung drain pumps. While OEM parts typically boast seamless compatibility, the Atdsetr pump is more budget-friendly and surprisingly sturdy despite being a third-party replacement. Durability-wise, this drain pump was approximately on par with pricier rivals, but it doesn’t feel like you’re skimping on quality. However, there are some competitors with slightly higher noise suppression. Although this pump isn’t particularly loud, others in the same category are practically whisper-level during operation, which might appeal to those who value complete silence in their laundry routine.  

**Financial Value**  
Every product, in my opinion, needs to justify its price in terms of durability and functionality, and this washer drain pump gets that balance right. It feels like Atdsetr has struck a thoughtful compromise between cost and performance, which is a welcome relief for anyone looking to avoid the premium price of more well-known alternatives. If I were to call it anything, I’d say it’s a smart investment for those on a budget. There’s functionality, efficiency, and reliability baked into its DNA, which ticks the boxes for what a washer drain pump should offer at a reasonable price point.

So, as I pulled into a gas station parking lot there was a man sitting in a mustang - truly, I thought he was Mark Hamill for a second.

No, it wasn't. Went in to get my coffee internally debating whether or not to say anything. Then again, it could be a compliment and he could be a fan, too.

Going back out to my car, he was still there, so I shouted as he had his window down.

""Sir! For a moment I thought you were Mark Hamill!""

He smiled and replied ""Mark Hamill? No, not today!""

Said have a good day, got in my car, and drove to my next destination. Now, I have two thoughts.

1. That's such a great way to reply to a lookalike comment, because it implies that you have your own secret backstory where you could be different people from day to day... Or it says 'Well,  it wasn't Mark Hamill today but it could happen somewhere, sometime.' which is a cool thought. Someone out there has seen Mark Hamill in a parking lot, not me, and hopefully he wasn't bothered, but it could happen.

2. For a brief moment in time that was Mark Hamill. The tiny bit of time my brain told me that I was looking at a celebrity it was true enough for it to tell me that, even though the reality of it was very quickly revealed I still felt the excitement of seeing one of my favorite actors - especially on a day where Star Wars is clearly on my mind.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality of Korean matcha is determined by several factors, including the cultivation method, leaf processing, grinding technique, and origin. Understanding these features will help you discern between different grades and select the matcha that best suits your preferences.

**Cultivation Method:** Shade-grown tea leaves produce a richer, sweeter matcha.

Korean matcha farmers often employ shade-growing techniques similar to those used in Japan, covering the tea plants for several weeks before harvest. This process increases the chlorophyll content in the leaves, resulting in a vibrant green color and a smoother, less bitter flavor. The duration and intensity of the shade significantly impact the final product's taste and aroma.

**Leaf Processing:** Steaming and drying are crucial steps in preserving the tea's flavor and color.

After harvesting, the tea leaves are typically steamed to prevent oxidation, preserving their vibrant green color and fresh flavor. This steaming process is followed by drying, which removes moisture from the leaves and prepares them for grinding. The drying method can influence the final product's taste, with some producers using traditional methods like sun-drying or modern techniques like freeze-drying.

**Grinding Technique:** Stone-ground matcha offers the finest texture and best flavor.

The traditional method of grinding matcha involves using granite stone mills, which slowly and gently pulverize the dried tea leaves into a fine powder. This slow grinding process minimizes heat generation, preserving the tea's delicate flavor and aroma. Stone-ground matcha typically has a smoother, more velvety texture compared to matcha ground using other methods.

**Origin and Variety:** Different regions and cultivars offer distinct flavor profiles.

The region where the tea is grown can significantly influence its flavor profile, due to variations in soil composition, climate, and altitude. Different cultivars of tea plants also contribute to the matcha's unique characteristics. Exploring matcha from various regions and made from different cultivars can reveal a wide range of flavor nuances.

**Packaging and Freshness:** Airtight packaging is essential for preserving quality and preventing oxidation.

Matcha is highly susceptible to oxidation, which can degrade its flavor and color. Therefore, proper packaging is crucial for maintaining its freshness. Look for matcha that is packaged in airtight, light-resistant containers. Check the production date or ""best by"" date to ensure that you are purchasing a fresh product.

**Ceremonial Grade vs. Culinary Grade:** Understanding the intended use affects the quality needed.

Ceremonial grade matcha is the highest quality, designed for drinking straight as a traditional tea. It boasts a vibrant green color, smooth texture, and sweet, umami-rich flavor. Culinary grade matcha is generally more robust and slightly more bitter, making it suitable for use in baking, smoothies, and other culinary applications.

 ## Core Benefits

Korean matcha offers a range of benefits, from boosting energy levels to enhancing mental clarity and providing a rich source of antioxidants. Its unique flavor profile also makes it a versatile ingredient for both traditional tea ceremonies and modern culinary creations.

**Sustained Energy Boost:** Unlike coffee, matcha provides a sustained energy boost without the jitters or crash.

The caffeine in matcha is absorbed more slowly and evenly by the body, thanks to the presence of L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation and reduces anxiety. This combination of caffeine and L-theanine results in a more sustained and balanced energy boost, improving focus and concentration without the negative side effects associated with coffee.

**Enhanced Mental Clarity and Focus:** L-theanine promotes relaxation and improves cognitive function.

L-theanine, a unique amino acid found in matcha, has been shown to promote relaxation, reduce stress, and improve cognitive function. It works synergistically with caffeine to enhance focus and concentration, making matcha an excellent choice for students, professionals, and anyone seeking to improve their mental performance.

**Rich Source of Antioxidants:** Matcha is packed with catechins, powerful antioxidants that protect against cell damage.

Matcha is exceptionally rich in catechins, a type of antioxidant that has been linked to numerous health benefits, including protection against heart disease, cancer, and age-related cognitive decline. The high concentration of antioxidants in matcha helps to neutralize free radicals, reducing oxidative stress and protecting cells from damage.

**Versatile Culinary Ingredient:** Matcha can be used in a wide variety of recipes, from lattes to baked goods.

Matcha's unique flavor profile makes it a versatile ingredient for both sweet and savory dishes. It can be used to create delicious matcha lattes, smoothies, baked goods, ice cream, and even savory sauces and dressings. Its vibrant green color also adds visual appeal to culinary creations.

**Potential Health Benefits:** Regular consumption may support cardiovascular health and weight management.

Studies have suggested that regular consumption of matcha may support cardiovascular health by lowering blood pressure and improving cholesterol levels. It may also aid in weight management by boosting metabolism and promoting fat oxidation. While more research is needed to confirm these benefits, the existing evidence suggests that matcha can be a valuable addition to a healthy lifestyle.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions regarding the authenticity, preparation, and storage of Korean matcha. This section addresses some of the most common inquiries.

**How can I identify authentic Korean matcha?**

Authentic Korean matcha typically has a vibrant green color, a smooth texture, and a slightly sweet, umami-rich flavor. Look for matcha that is sourced from reputable Korean tea farms and packaged in airtight, light-resistant containers. Check for certifications or quality assurance seals that indicate authenticity and quality.

**What is the best way to prepare Korean matcha?**

The traditional method of preparing matcha involves whisking the powder with hot (but not boiling) water using a bamboo whisk (chasen). Start by sifting the matcha to remove any clumps, then add a small amount of hot water to form a paste. Gradually add more hot water, whisking vigorously in a ""W"" or ""M"" shape until a frothy layer forms on top.

**How should I store Korean matcha to maintain its freshness?**

Matcha is highly susceptible to oxidation, so proper storage is essential for maintaining its freshness. Store matcha in an airtight, light-resistant container in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight and strong odors. Once opened, it's best to consume matcha within a few weeks to ensure optimal flavor and quality.

**Is Korean matcha different from Japanese matcha?**

Yes, Korean matcha often has a slightly different flavor profile compared to Japanese matcha. Some describe Korean matcha as being earthier or more grassy, while Japanese matcha is often described as being sweeter and more umami-rich. These differences are due to variations in soil composition, climate, and cultivation techniques.

Started 220, fairly muscular and active (CrossFit like workouts), but carrying excess fat around waist like the classic American dad because overeating always trumps exercise!

I have a Biosense breath analyzer. Biosense went out of business last year, but the device still works standalone without the app, thank god.  It displays an output from my breath in ACE, which has a strong correlation with ketone levels…not perfect, but a good gauge when comparing against itself, in my opinion.

My experience so far:
Day 0: 220lbs.  ACE level reading: 2 (very low ketosis).  Stretched and hung on pull up bar for several minutes.  Kept exertion level to minimum.
Day 1: 117 lbs. ACE level reading: 10 (large bowl movement and urinated twice…was on methylene blue prior to fast  so urine was still very blue). Two mile walk in the woods and a slow pace, but with hills.
Day 2: 115lbs ACE level reading changed rapidly through the day. Took two measurements: 22 then 25 (read as moderate ketosis based on the device).  Urinated small amounts several times…light blue).  One mile slow walk and stretching.
Day3: 213lbs ACE level reading: 32. (Deep in ketosis, according to the device).  Fair amount of urine when I woke up (where is this urine coming from!) and urine color is very slightly blue.  I am surprised that i am still showing traces of methylene blue, but totally off topic!

I have done many extended regular fasts (with water and coffee), so I know the hunger pains associated with normal fasts.  I have not had any of those uncomfortable and challenging hunger pains during this dry fast.  So happy to not have that, as these pains really would consume my emotional energy to resist breaking down and eating.  This dry fasting is more manageable and I am more clear headed to perform thinking tasks.  I have measured ketones (ACE) on past fasts, and in comparison to those fasts, I entered ketosis much faster and deeper.  So interesting and great!

I am also monitoring a sink condition that the dermatologist thinks are hives.  I am working with a dietitian on identifying foods that my body reacts to, which seems to possibly be soy, wheat, some coloring chemicals, and sulfites (still TBD). While on this dry fast, inflammation has reduced but is also dry and dry skin sluffing off.  I think dry fasting is helping, but will continue to monitor.

I am not sure how far I will go with this, but seems kind of easy to this point, especially when compared to my experience with normal fasting (with water and coffee).  I will likely continue for a couple of days then move to water mid-week.

Tried ProtonVPN first because it’s always one of the top picks in best free VPN Reddit posts. It connected quick and didn’t ask for any payment info, which was a relief. I used it mostly for checking email and browsing Reddit and it worked fine. Speeds were a little slow when the café was busy, but nothing too bad. After a few days, I also tested Windscribe and honestly liked it more for free users. I could pick more server locations and the connection felt faster when streaming YouTube on my break.

Neither of them tried to spam me with ads or shady popups, which is more than I can say for some other “free” VPN apps I tried before. For anyone else still using a free VPN right now, are these two still the best options? Or has something new popped up that’s even better in 2025?

1kej0j3,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibiza/comments/1kej0j3/review_the_ibiza_twiin_resort/,Review:  The Ibiza Twiin resort,"I thought I would offer my review of the Ibiza Twiin Resort after recently staying on the island. 

A brief review and overview of the Island.  Ibiza is a charming island off the coast of Spain and part of the Balearic Islands. It’s approximately 1hr flight from Madrid.  Ibiza is well known for its EDM parties, night life, and quaint towns.  It attracts  lot of youthful visitors from Europe, Middle East, and Americas.  Personally I found Ibiza town (15min walk from the Twiins) a charming place to visit, shop, and dine.  The island is very modern. If you’re thinking it’s Jamaica, the Dominican Republic or Cuba, you will be wrong.  This is more like Hawaii or Bermuda.  The roads, civil infrastructure, buildings, electric grid, and ports are top notch.  The only thing I wish had been better was the quality of public beaches.

The food and restaurants were above average but didn’t blow my mind.  That’s my opinion.  I did love going down by the harbor and having a cocktail or glass of wine.  However, the food was better in Madrid and Barcelona consistently.  The shops are quaint.  The town has some good history and if your fit worth walking around the old walled portion of the city. 

Review of EDM parties and clubs - this was not what I had expected.  The music was okay but the cost for the club I went to was not worth it.  It was easily the most over hyped aspect of the trip.  I hope during the summer time the pool parties are more enjoyable.  

I highly recommend the island but encourage you to get outside the towns and visit the hidden beaches, hikes, and other natural sights.  I think this is actually the real reason to go to Ibiza.  You can do this but renting a scooter for around $45 euros or a small car for more.  My suggestion is a car because riding a 120cc scooter on a 70KPH road is dumb.  I also wonder what the Scuba and off short fishing is like.   

The Ibiza Twiin Resort:

I found the resort to be a mid level all inclusive resort similar to what you’d find in Mexico, the Dominican, or Jamaica.  It’s clean, the food is good, people are very kind and helpful.  My room was a queen room overlooking the outside of the resort.  The neighborhood was safe and suburban.  Aside from rev’ing motor bikes at night and the nightly music/shows at the resort, this was a quiet place (as of the end of April).

The pool is nice, the outside deck is clean and white.  The chairs and furniture was all new and well kept.  The whole facility was modern and attractive.  There was little to complain about except one and thing: everything opens later in the morning - including the pool, deck, cafe’s, coffee shop, bars - 100% of the resort is closed until after 8am.  That might not be a big deal to most, but if you’re coming from northern Europe or America and like an early morning tea or espresso, you’ll have to be patient because you won’t be getting anything.

What I would have enjoyed or seen - more outdoor activities at the Twiin - yoga, fitness, music during the daytime, maybe curated tours of Ibiza.  Granted this might happen more when summer comes, but the nightly shows were musicals and it would have been more interesting to hear either a live band or DJ, dancing or having a beer and listening.  The pools close around 6pm (crazy).  They should have them open in the evenings with the DJ and be serving drinks.  It got pretty tame at night, more than I would have preferred.  It lead to going to bed earlier than I would have desired due to inactivity.  

Overall I’d say the Twiins Resort is a solid 3.7 out of 5, where a 5 is a luxury resort like the Ritz or JW Marriott.  

I would return and be very happy at the Twiins if given the chance.  

My only regret was not renting a car and exploring more.  Don’t make this mistake.  There isn’t that much to do in Ibiza Town after a day of wandering around.  Get out and stretch your legs on a hike. ",1,1746362881.0,ibiza,1,0.67,False

Totally relatable, right? So, here's the deal. I recently hit a point where my mind felt like it was more haywire than a broken GPS. I needed a change, stat. That’s when I stumbled across something called *box breathing*. Sounds fancy, but stay with me here.

I decided to commit to this technique for seven days. You might think, “Breathing? Really? How’s that gonna help me juggle my chaotic to-do list?” Well, believe it or not, studies have shown that *controlling your breath can seriously impact your cortisol levels*—you know, that pesky stress hormone that loves to crash your day like an uninvited guest. So, armed with this knowledge, I embarked on a breathing adventure 🧘‍♂️.

Here's the simple breakdown of **box breathing**:
1. **Inhale** for 4 seconds (think about good vibes filling your lungs).
2. **Hold** for 4 seconds (embrace the calm).
3. **Exhale** for 4 seconds (release the inner chaos).
4. **Pause** for 4 seconds (letting the silence settle).

Rinse and repeat, my friends.

**So, how did this breathing hack transform my week?** Here's what I noticed:

- **Calm amidst the chaos**: Somehow, pausing to breathe made the mountain of stress feel more like a molehill.
- **Sharper focus**: My squirrel brain? Miraculously tamed! Those scattered thoughts? Aligned. Magic? Perhaps. Science? Definitely.
- **Mood booster**: Who knew just breathing would be a mood-lifter? Side effect: more smiles, even pre-coffee!

She was an adulterer before I met her.  She should have not made some of the decisions she made to satisfy her psychological and physical needs.

I am angry and hurt because she tried to change me.  She KNEW who I was when she met me.  SHE married me knowing I had kids and I was an alcoholic.

She tried to see past these things because she just wanted a ""father figure"" that she didn’t have growing up - hence her promiscuity and penchant for older men.  I wouldn’t be surprised if that trend is still happening today.

I am angry at the way she would be nice to my kids and I knew it was ALL bullshit.  She covered it up well and it still bothers me to this day, almost 13 years later.

Angry at the fact two weeks before she left, she was smiling and saying she loved me although in her mind she was well checked out.  That’s a woman who is a controller. That’s a woman that is a psychopath.

I'm angry that Ive wasted so much time thinking about her, where she is, who she is with, whats shes doing when I should be concentrating on myself.

I'm angry because I feel the whole marriage was a lie.

Angry because I feel betrayed, abandoned and left alone.  Like I often am.

Angry because she wouldn’t even meet me a month after she left for coffee to discuss our marriage.  She shut it down right away.

Hurt because she treated our marriage like it was disposable.

Angry because she left me.

Angry because she didn’t fight for our marriage.  She likely met someone else and was having a relationship with them while we were still living together - speculation, yes, but a good bet.

Angry at myself for being such a fool and allowing it all to happen.

Angry at myself for the time I have wasted during my relationship and marriage and many years after the divorce.

Angry at time wasted - I'm old now and I have likely dumped a good decade down the toilet because I couldn’t get over her or the situation.

Hurt by her cold way of treating our relationship.  I know she has her own issues with her own insecurities and health problems.

Angry because I know even if we didn’t separate in January 2016, we would have eventually - likely during COVID - and I'm not sure what hurts more, the fact it happened or would have.

Angry because I knew the relationship, the marriage, wasn’t sustainable.  I should never have even gotten involved.  But my own self-confidence lied and said she was the best Ill ever be with.

Angry because I knew the relationship wasn't sustainable.

Angry because I lied to myself and told myself she was the best I could ever do.

1. Exercise: I run because I love to run. But the fact that you also burn calories is a side-plus for me which is good. I run 10km/session and usually 2 sessions per week. I also have 2 sessions of weight training per week

2. Expose to sunlight. I love the sun, I'm a Greek guy and sunlight is what I need most. So yeah I use sunscreen, I avoid certain hours but I also make sure that I get sunlight. It helps my mood and when I'm happy I do eat less.

3. Just eat less. No miraculous foods, no superfoods, nothing. You gotta eat less. No matter how billions of nutrients you get by a so called superfood, you need less calories. Be picky about what you eat. It's like going shopping on a tight budget. You gotta stuck all the nutrients you need in a certain amount of calories. You should ask for a professional's help if you feel you need it.

4. I don't eat liquid calories. I'm having coffee without sugar (although that's how I always had it) with just a tiny portion of milk. Other than that I don't drink calories with the exception of some fruit-smoothies that I'm having after my work-outs.

1keiqwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1keiqwp/aita_for_refusing_to_have_canapés_at_our_wedding/,AITA for refusing to have canapés at our wedding?,"Hi lovely potatoes and of course our fabulous potato queen Charlotte, absolutely love your videos. 

This all happened 13 years ago and has become known as “Canapé Gate”  much to the hilarity of my friends and family.  I will try to keep it short but if you make it through it’s worth it for the belly laugh. 

Context 
1, My MIL (we will call her Betty) has a reputation, not the sort of reputation you’d want! She is known for being overbearing and a bully add to that delightful mix she’s a “Hyacinth Bucket” (the UK readers are laughing) for those not in the know, she thinks she is the very hight of style and sophistication. She is neither!! She loves nothing more than one upping people, but absolutely hates it if someone dares to do it to her. Guess what my favourite hobby is?? Yes you got it, well we all need a hobby and aggravating her is mine. 
2, This was my second wedding, my now husband’s (we shall call him James) first. James and I met in our mid 30’s, he’s the most fabulous man, he completely swept me off my feet and I still can’t believe how lucky I am to have met him. How he ever became the down to earth all around good guy with a mother like his is a mystery. Anyway James and I spent many hours discussing how we wanted our wedding to be, I was very aware that as it was his first wedding I wanted to make it as perfect for him as I could but to be honest we are so in tune that we wanted the same things which made it easy. 
3, We didn’t want the big, flashy expensive wedding. We wanted our guests to feel relaxed and to have something a bit different. I know full well it’s not what other people would want but it was absolutely perfect for us and that’s what matters. We decided what was important to us and what you really remember from attending other weddings. We had a good size  budget but wanted to bring it in under budget if possible and this became a brilliant game of hunt the bargains. We came in well below our budget too. 
 
Planning our wedding was great, I spent many hours hunting down good deals and bargains. Everything just fell into place like it was just meant to be and no drama, what more can a bride to be ask for? 

So our plan for the big day was to set up the reception in the morning, this was in a huge marquee at my family home. Everyone would park in one of the fields at home which is walking distance to the village church. After the wedding we would all walk home together (which made for some delightful informal photos). Drinks would be served and when all glasses were changed we would have the speeches, my brother would be giving me away and he was having palpitations about giving a speech but was determined to do it so I wanted to get it out of the way so he could relax and enjoy himself. Then we would eat, drink be merry and dance the night away. Absolutely perfect. 

The only fly in the ointment was Betty, considering the sheer hell some have gone through with their MIL’s I did get off lightly. 

I asked her to come to my dress fitting in an attempt to make her feel included, she then went and told all her friends what colour my dress was except that she still insists (13 years on) that’s it’s coffee coloured…. It’s dusty pink!! 

This woman is obsessed with canapés!! I presume it’s because she thinks they are sophisticated or something. At a wedding the year before ours she even complained to the bride that she should have had them and that it ruined the day for her that they were missing. The bride was not overly happy about this conversation as you can imagine. 

Several times over a few months Betty mentioned canapés, every time we would say we didn’t want them. Clearly this was not a clear enough response for her. About 6 weeks before the wedding James and I were at Betty’s house for Sunday lunch, after we had finished eating James and his dad went to the living room while Betty and I stayed in the dining room talking about the wedding. 

This is when she started the canapé hard sell, I lost count of how many ways I basically said no we don’t want them!!  I even explained our plan for reception and they just weren’t needed as we only had three speeches and then we would be tucking into the hog roast. She just kept on going and going, this went on for nearly two hours, her rewording “you must have canapés” and me saying “no” and me still trying to keep extremely calm and civil. 

At one point I could hear James and his dad laughing and I knew it was because of our conversation but did they come to rescue me? No they didn’t, swines! 

Now something I maybe should have mentioned is that I’m a redhead and have the stubborn temper that goes with it. When I dig my heels in over something nothing will move me, even a herd of stamping elephants won’t shift me in fact I’m more than likely to do the complete opposite twice and take photos just to prove a point. As my poor parents remember well from the dreaded teenage years. 

So by this point my heels were completely dug in and there was no way in hell I was having bloody canapés at my wedding. But as we hit two hours of going around in circles I decided to change tack as a change is as good as a rest and I was getting bored now. So I took my chance and said that if she absolutely insisted on having canapés at our reception, barring in mind that neither the bride or groom want them then we can with several conditions attached, you should have seen the smug, ha I’ve won look on her face, that didn’t last long!! 

I said that she would need to either make or purchase them herself, she would need to make sure that all our guests were catered for (food allergies etc), she would be responsible for serving said canapés and washing any platters afterwards. Her response was she couldn’t possibly serve them as she’s the mother of the groom and it would be rude to ask her friends. So I sat there just staring at her as she’s tried to get around my conditions, which she couldn’t. Once she had finally accepted defeat James and I went home and didn’t really think much more about it. 

The day of our wedding was perfect in every way, the sun shone, the photos were beautiful, our guests were relaxed and everything was just as we had planned. In the evening I was chatting to James’s best man he had said some lovely things about me in his speech including that I’m fun, fabulous and feisty, I asked him why feisty? His parents happened to be standing with us and his mum went to school with Betty. Before the best man could answer his mum said your feisty because in all the years I’ve known Betty you’re the only person who has ever said no to her and got away with it!! 

Turns out Betty had told all her friends how I refused to have canapés which would ruin our reception for her and everyone else, she had done her best to educate me and how I said a flat out no. 

Meanwhile her friends found this the funniest thing ever and phoned each other to discuss this event, apparently they were all looking forward to meeting this feisty girl who’s not afraid to say no and who got away with it to boot. 

13 years on James and I are extremely happy together, we have two amazing children and life is good. There have been a few times I’ve had to put Betty back in her box but nothing as funny as canapé gate.

I have just had my first 2 experiences with people on the spectrum and wonder if I could have handled these situations better. My intention is to make sure that I am correctly supporting in these circumstances, not making things worse.

Situation 1: In a coffee shop, an adult sitting 2 tables across from me starts stimming and shouting out. I look over, notice the hand flaps and shakes, recognize it's stimming. I started thinking that maybe they are over-stimulated by the crowded space. I got up and moved to a different seat, so that my back was to them.

My intention was that I didn't want this person to feel like I was watching them. I wanted to give them space because I felt that having someone sitting opposite them, even if I didn't look up, would make their social overwhelm worse.

Was I wrong? I feel guilty that they may have thought I was being rude, but really, I was honestly trying to give them their space without any eyes on them. It is not the same but I have severe panic attacks when I'm in crowded spots and feeling people looking at me makes it worse. That's why my instinct was to give them privacy, like I would want in that situation. Was that the wrong thing to do? Should I have spoken to them to ask if they needed anything in order to calm them?

Situation 2: My friend's 13 year old son has just been diagnosed. When I was visiting, he suddenly started screaming. She called it a ""meltdown"". He started getting physically aggressive with her. I have no idea what triggered him. Maybe my visit or the school work he had to do, or maybe the prospect of the shower his mum was asking him to take (he has sensory issues with showers).

Again, my instinct was to excuse myself to go to the store. I gave her an hour alone with her son to help him calm down. I did this because I didn't know if my presence was the cause of the meltdown. I came back after an hour just to give her some encouraging words and reassure her that I was not upset by any of this. It's my first time in their house and I wanted her to know that I was not judging him. I stayed maybe 5 minutes more, gave her the snacks I picked up for him in the store, and went home.

Should I have just gone home instead of returning after an hour? Is there anything I could have done to help her son in that moment? I didn't even try because he doesn't know me well, so I felt I would make it worse for him if I tried to calm him.

I have googled these questions and tried to learn more and understand better, but since these are random situations (not a family member or someone I see regularly), I can't find any real input on whether I managed these situations incorrectly.

I'd be very grateful for any feedback I can get here. What did I do wrong and what should I have done differently? I just want to do the right thing and provide the correct support if I'm in this situation in the future.

For a little context, I have been in a state of cronic dysregulation and hypervigilance for YEARS and had no idea. I am beginning to realise that essentially most of my life has been spent in various degrees of hypervigilance and dissociation (I am almost 39 lol).

I am new to EMDR (only 5 sessions so far), and while I did see tiny positive effects from the first session, it wasn't the massive release some people talk about. I have CPTSD, so my issues spread across decades, this won't be an easy or quick fix for me.

My first two sessions were really good and I felt tired but hopeful. Then my third was a fucking shitstorm of really hard feelings and overwhelm. I was doubting the process and myself and my future. The fourth one was really hard, but also left me feeling slightly hopeful again. My fifth was wonderful - lots of ugly crying and expressing so much anger and grief out loud, as well as having lots of cognitive breakthroughs.

I am now realising that no two sessions will be the same. Sometimes I will feel like an absolute wreck at the end, other times I will feel elated and excited for the future. But the overall trajectory is always upwards.

Then today I realised some things:

* I've been feeling myself exist in the world in a way that I haven't for so long! It's hard to explain unless you've experienced this too, but just generally being calmly aware of where I am. Feeling the jeans on my legs, feeling the soft cardigan with my palm. Noticing the beautiful buildings on my way home. Feeling present. It makes me want to cry just realising how fucking long it's been since I've had this feeling. I forgot it existed!
* The other day I was reading in bed and could hear the TV in the living room, but it didn't bother me. I could lose myself in my book and ignore the soft noise from the other room. WHAT? I was shocked to realise that, and it showed just how constant my hypervigilance had been: I was **constantly** listening for potential dangers around me, so it was impossible for me to read a book unless it was complete silence. I would literally wear earplugs sometimes just so I could read. Turns out this wasn't just who I was, it was my CPTSD all along! And now I was experiencing a glimpse of what it's like to not be always ON.
* My partner is having a really difficult week, and normally that would absolutely fill me with anxiety to the brim! I'd go into frantic mode (but hide that externally, only freak out internally). I would try and do things to make him feel better, appease any negative feeling in him, feel this pressure to take care of him and anticipate his need etc. Today I noticed that while I did do some things to help him out (which he gratefully appreciated), I could also just do my own thing, like chill out in a separate room without worrying if he needed me. I was there for him but also for me. And I almost didn't catch this small sign of progress, because it just happened so naturally. I only realised this an hour ago when I was on my way to read in a coffee shop alone and felt no anxiety about leaving him alone. WHO IS SHE??
* I feel grateful for stuff. Like my favourite bag that I am wearing today, and my new glasses case (pattern geeks will understand if I mention it has the ""Strawberry Thief"" design), my laptop that allows me to write this in a coffee shop, my life being generally not too bad in the grand scheme of things.

This is a long post, but hopefully it will remind people to try and catch themselves doing better. It can be so subtle you don't even realise that for a while now you haven't been freaking out quite as often as you used to. It honestly makes me tear up with self compassion and gratitude. I am doing the work. I am taking care of myself. I am slowly getting better.

In my panic to fill the gap of what to do after stopping coffee, I’ve tried so many teas in short time and carefully marked what I like in each. Some were light some were actually a bit sour. 

After my first try with Shou Puer, the support I received from the puer sub and the tea sub moved me to keep trying. I’ve rather quickly come to find that I do very much enjoy the smoothness, fullness, and richness of some Shou Pu erh teas, and certainly others. 

Of course I’m still learning and I must reiterate that the people of the puer sub and also the tea sub have been super supportive through my journey. I am honoured. Soon time for another trip to the local tea shop to supply for the coming week. Thank you all very much!",19,1746361052.0,puer,2,1.0,False

1keidkk,https://i.redd.it/tjmekpv4brye1.jpeg,Coffee of the day review,So this coffee lived up to its name. Just did a simple brewing in the pot nothing fancy. The entire house smelled of butterfinger candy bar. I took some to work with me for a coffee break. When I got back to my car it smelled like a candy shop in my car. Now this is one of the few coffees I had as of late that tasted better cooler. Very smooth very buttery.,3,1746360755.0,TheRealFriendsOver40,3,1.0,False

Just signed up earlier this week while setting up my new laptop. I’ve mostly used free VPNs in the past like Windscribe and ProtonVPN, thanks to all the suggestions in free VPN Reddit threads but I was curious if this one would be any smoother since it’s coming from a trusted company.

Setup was super easy, and it connected instantly without needing any crazy settings. For basic browsing and email, it’s been totally fine. I also tested it on public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop and didn’t notice any speed issues. That said, it didn’t work with Netflix or Hulu, which was a little disappointing. And there’s not a ton of server locations compared to what I’m used to with other VPNs.

So now I’m kind of torn. For light use, it works. But if I want to stream or have more options, maybe it’s not enough. Anyone else tried Malwarebytes VPN lately? Is it worth keeping, or should I go back to one of the best free VPN picks instead? Would love to know what others think in 2025.",1,1746360739.0,VPNFreaks,0,1.0,False

I was up late last night practicing and then Lolita and I gabbed endlessly after her MFL show. This school had decided to break the Eliza Doolittle part between two actors. Lolita was the formidable “before” Eliza who took the part through “The Rain in Spain.” The student actress took over from “I Could Have Danced All Night.”  Lolita was so excited, as if she had never seen or done MFL before. Maybe she was imagining herself as Julie Andrews on opening night. 

At any rate, I went to bed ridiculously late. I was still planning on joining the East Bronx Roadrunners. I got up to make myself a cup of coffee but there was no coffee or Nespresso machine on the Thomas house counter. Whaaaat? *Both* broken? So I crossed into the Goldstein house and there was no coffee machine or Baretti there either. Instead there was a note from Mom and Dad: “You are burning your candle from both ends. Go back to sleep. We will go to 1:00 p.m. KRG instead of 10 a.m. We have already notified the Lopez and Yao families. They will meet us there. Go back to sleep!”

Oh, but what about Eulogio!?!? He's in town this week and we had planned to catch up before he headed out to travel back upstate. So I got on my phone to tell him. But there was already a note from him. “I heard your family is coming to the second KRG. I will stick around a bit and catch a later bus. I am looking forward to saying hi to you all!”

At any rate, I am so much looking forward to KRG. It seems forever since I have been able to make an activity! So I went back to sleep.

You know what? I am going back to bed!
