I have questions (don’t we all 😝)! 
For the last week or so I have been going to bed every night with some of those extremely long FromSoft Lore Videos “To Fall Asleep To”. I’m sure you guys know the ones. They’re anywhere from 8 to literally 24 hours long! Man I love this community! 😏 
But every time I do, besides having weird as hell dreams, I wake up with more questions than I had before.
So here’s what’s on my mind today. We know that the GW is gone. It abandoned the lens between long ago. Honestly can we blame it?  But if so, who imprisoned Marika? The Elden Beast, yes? But what does this mean? Wasn’t the EB a manifestation of the GW itself? The way my brain made sense of it was sort of putting a Christian metaphor on it. With GRRM at the helm, you see Christianity all over ER. But I digress. I sort of saw the EB as part of the Holy Trinity. Either way, if it is an envoy of the GW, completely powered by the GW itself, what is controlling it now? If it’s literally just the sword of the GW, how does it even exist anymore with the GW gone? And why would it care what Marika is doing? 
We don’t know enough about Radagon to know his exact role. How long has he been a part of Marika? What was his purpose? In my head canon, he was the “human” version of the GW, created to be a part of Marika from the moment of her ascension. Sort of like the “Jesus” of the GW. It’s insane, I know. Just one of those weird ways that my head has filled in the gaps of unanswered questions. (Don’t judge me, I looked this up today and turns out others have seen him this way 😂) 
The only reason I mention him is I wonder his role in Marika being imprisoned or the EB still being around. 
So very long story put short (too late, I know), how is anything that was once a part of the GW even functioning at all!? The spells. The grace. The Elden Beast. Who or what is pushing it to survive? The fingers? The mother of all fingers? 
You would think that once the GW abandoned the lands between, these things would be lights out! 
It’s said in game that the fingers were lying. But why? What purpose does it serve to pretend to be communing with outer god that is no longer there? 
Excuse my rambling! I haven’t had a full cup of coffee yet this morning. 
But I do love discussing lore, and love even more reading the theories here! 
So TY in advance!

I was fairly active, walking approximately 15 miles daily. I typically ate two meals daily, a small pastry and coffee for breakfast, and a larger but moderate dinner with an appetizer and main course (no dessert).

When I returned, I was surprised to find that I had gained close to 15 pounds. Though I anticipated the weight was water and would subside after a week or two, it still hasn’t disappeared after eating normally to the point that my clothes no longer fit.

I’ll start off with saying he’s not a bad guy. He’s sweet and has never yelled at me or even raised his voice. But here are some of my issues. 
1.) we have no sexual chemistry. He’s like not into it and I have to beg him to have sex with me. Not fun 
2.) he’s very… monotoned. That’s fine I guess I tend to like the gloomy shikamaru type but he doesn’t want to do anything. He doesn’t go out of his way to interact with my friends. Most people think he hates them just because he’s so quiet. 
3.) he never makes anything feel special. What I mean about that is my holidays/my bday. We never do anything he treats them like any other normal day. My bday was yesterday and he wanted to go to a coffee shop and work… also he didn’t even get me a gift. 
4.) he’s doesn’t clean or cook unless I tell him. I run our house. I make sure it’s clean and that the fridge has food. We both work and provide for the house equally 
5.) he makes 4x the amount I do. He’s an engineer. And he’ll make me pay for dates (he pays for what he wants to do) so the only dates we do that he’ll pay for is golfing. Other than that I pay for every date. Or if I don’t pay he just won’t go. (Saying it’s too expensive) 
6.) my biggest deal breaker. We’ve been together for 4 years. I’m ready to get married get a house have a baby etc. and he wants to buy a house when our lease is up and I got really excited thinking that we were gonna get this house together no he wants to buy it and have me pay him rent. He doesn’t wanna buy it together.  
 
I just really sad and scared to leave him. I have a really shitty home life. Like no family. They are all dead or in jail or out of my life. It’s just me. And the bf I guess. I don’t have any irl friends. I only have one real bestie and she lives in Aussie land. I work my ass off (I work from home) so I don’t get out much.

Why is the research of the former Kakhovka Reservoir territories important?  
The restoration of natural landscapes on the former Kakhovka Reservoir is not just a miracle of nature—it is a crucial process that must be studied. We have a unique opportunity to gather invaluable scientific data on ecosystem recovery after a catastrophe of unprecedented scale.  
However, hidden threats may be lurking beneath this revival. This is not hype or fearmongering—it is a warning based on existing evidence. For decades, heavy metals, industrial waste, petroleum products, and chemical compounds accumulated in the reservoir’s sediments. Now, no longer sealed underwater, these contaminants may be affecting the soil, water, biodiversity, and even human health.  
To prevent long-term environmental threats, we must not only document the current state but also conduct long-term, regular observations. Only through years of continuous research can we predict potential risks and take timely action to protect nature and people.

🌿Відродження природи після катастрофи - унікальна можливість для науки! 🌿  
Чому дослідження територій колишнього Каховського водосховища є важливим?  
Відновлення природних ландшафтів на території колишнього Каховського водосховища - це не просто диво природи, це важливий процес, який необхідно вивчати. Ми маємо унікальну можливість зібрати безцінні наукові дані про відновлення екосистем після катастрофи безпрецедентного масштабу.  
Однак за цим відродженням можуть ховатися приховані загрози. Це не ажіотаж і не нагнітання страху - це попередження, що ґрунтується на існуючих фактах. Десятиліттями важкі метали, промислові відходи, нафтопродукти та хімічні сполуки накопичувалися в донних відкладеннях водосховища. Тепер, більше не запечатані під водою, ці забруднювачі можуть впливати на ґрунт, воду, біорізноманіття і навіть на здоров'я людей.  
Щоб запобігти довгостроковим екологічним загрозам, ми повинні не лише документувати поточний стан, але й проводити довгострокові, регулярні спостереження. Лише завдяки рокам безперервних досліджень ми можемо передбачити потенційні ризики та вчасно вжити заходів для захисту природи і людей.

I get it, it is hard to find a normal person to chat or not get bored that easily, but why you are looking for people to chat, if you do not reply back at all. I really wish I could find friend or best friend here but ignoring DMs will not help. I know, to find a normal guy who wants to only chat, being normal without being awkward and nasty (yes you know what I mean), is hard, but atleast give me a chance.

Let me make a quick introduction from my side. I am 26 years old male, living in Europe, I can be a little bit shy at first but definitely once you get me, once I open up, you will see the real side of me (do not be scared) I did not mean it in this way 😂. What I meant is, I will be more relaxed, funnier and so on. I like to play games on PC, drinking coffee, tea, I love beaches and walking next to them, it is so relaxing. What else? I have one dog and I like long talks.

Anyways, I am looking for female person, who I can check on her, share stories, thoughts, how was at work/home if needed and so on. I really need this as I am in one situation and just to vent to someone means a lot to me at the moment. Most males will say ehh, you're just too soft and get sleep and you will be like new, but that is not the case at all. 

If you need someone who is funny, talkative, sometimes crazy in a good way, reach out to me and oh I really like Snapchat talking 😅 If you think we can be compatible as friends, you should introduce yourself in my DM. I will for sure ignore short introductions such as: ""Hey, hru?"" or ""hi, 22F, where do u come from?"". I prefer chatting on Snapchat than here, just my small preference.

❌️What I am not? I am not a bot or robot 🤖 Definitely I am not a man who would send d pics on Snapchat to start conversation, because this is a stupidity next level

Where can we go from here?,"I (23f) have been with my girlfriend (Anna-24f) for 3 years. Anna is disabled and has many illnesses which mean she cannot work. She gets disability allowance, money from her parents and has a small online business, but the money she gives me to help out is pittance compared to our actual expenses. 

As a result, I work 2 jobs and can sometimes be out of the house for hours. Sometimes I choose to just sleep in my car between jobs instead of going home because it's easier. 

Here's the issue - I often get home super late or have to leave super early and although I try my best to be quiet, I am still human and there are some things I can't control. The shower still makes noise, the kettle boiling still makes noise, frying bacon still makes noise. I've even tried to mitigate this stuff by making breakfast and iced coffee the night before but Anna still complains about the noise and how she 'can't fall asleep' when I leave for work/get home. 

A few days ago, Anna told me she felt like I was 'sleep depriving' her as 'punishment' but all of her examples of me doing this were things like me showering before work, or simply... getting out of bed which wakes her up. She basically thinks I'm jealous of her not working so I'm being petty and abusive by being deliberately loud and waking her up knowing she has insomnia and chronic fatigue syndrome. 

I feel like I’m stuck between a rock and a hard place. I’ve already adjusted a lot. I tiptoe around the house, avoid turning on lights, and even stopped showering in the mornings. I’ve tried sleeping downstairs to avoid waking her. I don’t know what more I can realistically do.

*This loss hit me easily as hard as the loss of Bowie in January of 2106—-Prince died just 3 months later ; actually, the 2 artists share some common DNA in the way they would mix music, film, art and fashion.   Very few did it with the style they did.

*If you only know his hits, dig deeper.  He produced a lot of music (and some clunkers are in there, sure) but songs like ""Starfish and Coffee"", ""Seven"", ""Sometimes It Snows In April"", ""The Cross"" and ""Wow"" are as good as anything else out there.

*Yeah, his solo on ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps"" at the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame jam was great but that's no surprise for anyone who ever saw him play live; I actually think his Super Bowl performance was even better.  He is in my Top 10 guitarists all time easily.

*He was famously private but we need to keep in mind these artists, even if they are ""heroes"" of ours, are not our friends and deserve to live their live in as much peace as is possible in today's world.

*The first time I saw him was 1988 at
 MSG where he played a blistering first set with most of his hits and a ton of guitar solos.  When he spoke, before the intermission, I recall him saying ""I just gave y'all what you want.  Now, when I come back, I'm gonna give you what you NEED"",  He came back and gave us another hour plus of slow jams and spiritual tunes that were just as powerful as that first set.

*Oddly enough, for a guy who was accused of misogyny early on thanks to his boldly sexual lyrics, he employed a LOT of women and you would be hard pressed to find a single female musician to speak ill of him.  He opened a lot of doors for many women in the music world.

*When I saw him play the Jones Beach Theatre during his ""Symbol Era"" (1994-ish), the Dude entered via SPEEDBOAT.  Yeah, he took his own boat right to the stage.  He is one of the few who could pull that move off.

*His ""Emancipation"" triple album would have been a perfect double album; lots of great stuff on there but easily an album's worth of filler as well.

*I dig that he stood up to the record business the way he did; yeah, it meant some of this best stuff is hard to find (and is not streaming) but that's ok:  it's worth seeking out.

*""Parade"" is a vastly  underrated album.


As I ponder all this,  I will open an Abita Purple Haze to drink and think more of all the gifts His Purpleness left us…..",10,1745258304.0,ClassicRock,8,0.81,False
1k4jz49,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4jz49,"Embarrassed but here we go, whitening pen review","Whitening Pen 2 week experiment 
Top before bottom after

(In pictures they don't look much different, but to me they do seem whiter irl)

I quit smoking a month ago, so I figured I would try out this pen to see if it works. I smoked for 20 years and haven't had my teeth professionally cleaned in all those years, except 1 time. (No dental insurance) 

I also drink 2 cups of coffee a day.

I'm so embarrassed about the way my teeth look and I was hoping this would help, even just a little. 

I brushed, flossed, and used mouthwash. I wanted to see what this product would do alone, so my toothpaste and mouthwash did NOT have any whitening agents.

After the routine, I applied this to my teeth and let it sit for 15 mins, as per instructions, then rinsed it out.

**Review**

*It goes on nicely and there is a lot in the pen. After 2 weeks, there's still some in there. It foams up well so you can see if you missed a spot.

*Unfortunately, it slides off the teeth easily, so I had to keep pushing it forward, the way you would move spit to the front of your mouth with it closed.

*I have NO extra sensitivity on my teeth or gums from this. 

****As you see in the pics, not much of a difference. However, in real life they do seem to whiter to me. I'm not sure why it doesn't look like it in photos? 
I guess it could be a placebo effect, but they honestly do look whiter to me in the mirror.  The yellowing on the bottom of my top front teeth is much lighter in person.

Maybe the flash on my phone is making it look like this, idk!

*I'm going keep using it to see if it does more, but I'm unsure if its okay for long term use, I have to look into it.  I'll use the pen til it's empty at least.

*I don't know if I would buy and do it again. Maybe the strips or trays would work better since they hold the agent more secure in the area you put it.🤔
It was a bit annoying having it moving off the teeth.

I know my teeth won't get much better without professionally being done.🤷‍♀️
My teeth have 8 years (since my last cleaning) of build up on them, so I know I probably need a professional whitening service to make them whiter. 

All in all, it's pretty cheap, and for people who don't smoke, it will probably work better. Maybe if you just drink coffee or wine it will have more effect.

For $1.25 it's definitely worth a shot to try it. I'm glad I did, because they do look better to me in person, so that accounts for something I guess 😄

I am excited, and nervous. 

Excited because there have been times in my life where I never thought I would live long enough to see my 30s ✨

Nervous, because- well I want to make the most out of my 30s and live with no regrets.

***What I have accomplished in my 20s \~***

* Having a decent career path and education
* Tried to stay healthy
* Learnt who I am as a person - my strengths, weaknesses, values, character and goals
* No regrets - I gave my 100% to everything 

***What I want to accomplish in my 30s \~***

* Career advancement
* Keeping healthy habits:
   * Drinking water with lemon or cucumber slices everyday
   * No coke and junk food
   * Continuing with Zumba and swimming - try to add strength training and running in my 30s schedule 
   * Wearing sunscreen everyday
   * Being kind to people around me, but also keeping healthy boundaries 
   * Keeping home clean and organized
   * Taking care of my hair
   * Moisturizing my body with oil/butter/lotion often
   * Going to spa atleast once in a year and ideally twice (includes scalp massage, facial, manicure, pedicure, body massage, eyebrow wax, chin wax, and hot water bath)
* Starting retinol at age of 34
* Financial literacy and savviness - time to decrease my shopping purchases and save money for buying a condo (lol 🥹😅)
* Try something new or go somewhere new at least once in a month
* Love my family and friends more. Give more hugs and spread kindness

***Lessons I want to remind myself when I enter my 30s \~***

* Remember, some people will always dislike you and make excuses to treat you poorly. This is not something just because you turned 30 and you look old or started aging. This happened in your 20s too for different reasons (weight/ overbite teeth / skin / religion) and so on. If people say mean things to you, that is a reflection on their insecurities and character. It does not represent you. 
* *Do not surround yourself with people who put you down*. Flowers bloom in healthy environments, so choose good company for yourself ☺️
* *Do not be afraid to wear whatever you like*\- especially coquette things like pink bows, hello kitty tees, earrings, lace/floral/satin dresses, crop tops, braids, flower clips, pigtails, heart tees/bracelets, and anything you enjoy wearing 🥰💄🌸✨🍓🩷🎟️🎀 
   * There is no age limit to fashion. Just smile, wear a cute floral dress, be yourself, and cherish the moment. This moment will never come again. Wear those outfits you were too shy to wear in your 20s. Love yourself and live freely like a flower 🌷 
   * Dress like if you were to be teleported in a nature-fantasy world, you will fit right in 🌸🪷🌹☀️🌴
* Deep breaths are like *little love notes to your body.* Whenever you feel anxious or depressed about life, take a deep breath and reframe your perspective.
* *This life is yours to crave - there is no competition*. You are your own person, with experiences and feelings unique to you. This is your fairytale and your perspective, ambitions, and thoughts will help you reach them. Comparing to others is a waste of time, because at the end of the day - the moments you have lived shape your perspective on life.
* *Journal, communicate, and use words like a singing rhythm to the dance of life.* Be honest with yourself. Do not like something? Do not do it unless its necessary. If its necessary, try to find something enjoyable about it. Do not be afraid to face your deepest fears and thoughts. Communicate with your loved ones - whether its a smile to show your gratitude or show discomfort because of their actions. Life is too short to let those words go unnoticed. If you cannot express your emotions in person, use a journal and then rip the paper if you do not want anyone reading it.
* *Stay connected with arts and crafts*. As a perfectionist, it is hard to express your genuine self. You put on a face with people, say the words they want to hear and do things they want to see about you. But this life is about you, not them! Draw using watercolors even if it is not the most mesmerizing painting. Craft something you enjoy and is unique. Be creative, and enjoy your personality which shines through your art. The canvas is yours. It helps you stay true to yourself, and enjoy your alone time.
* *Spend more time in the nature*. I enjoy the serenity and scenery. Just soak those moments in and learn to love yourself. 
* *Be grateful for everything and everyone around you*. Pray that the good people will stay. There is always a lesson to learn from every interaction - either with the grass or a person. 
* *Try to learn something at any given time*. For now, I have lots of projects in my early 30s, but learning is a lifelong skill. I love learning from people, and any skill. Keep learning! Try out a new book, language, sports, food cuisine, game, and so on. Life is full of endless possibilities. 
* *Life is a marathon, not a sprint*. Do not be upset if you don't meet some of your goals for whatever reason. Take a deep breath, reflect and start again! This is a lifelong journey to be the best version of yourself. There is time and hope for improvement. See the beautiful stars in the night, smile, and let them guide you to a new journey.
* *Stay open to exploring*! Traveling does not only mean visiting new countries and showing off on your social media. Traveling is a mindset. You are ready to explore new paths in this life. There is alot to explore in life - whether it is a new coffee shop, park, botanical garden, gym, mall, store and so on. 
* *Spread sunshine.* I want to be kinder, loving, and gentle for people who cherish me and are around me.

I am excited to enter my 30s, and my every breath is a love note in this life. I want to be the best version of myself, smile more, live an enchanting fairytale life and spread magical fairy glitter of love <3

Not the engine. Not the tires. The road itself — like it’s thinking. Like it knows me.

  


2:47 AM. Nine hours since I left the warehouse yard in Arkansas, hauling some bullshit shipment of retail shelving no one needs.

  


Somewhere along I-70, Kansas or Missouri — I couldn’t tell you anymore. The map in my brain’s gone soft. Like it’s been left out in the rain too long.

  


Radio gave out around midnight. Just static now. I leave it on anyway.

  


It breaks up the silence. Makes me feel like someone might still be out there. Someone human.

  


I’d been waiting for a rest stop for the last sixty miles. Either I missed one or it never existed to begin with — wouldn’t be the first time the highway played that trick.

  


When I finally saw the glow of a gas station sign in the distance, I almost missed the exit. Swerved onto the ramp like my life depended on it.

  


The sign said OPEN.

  


But I didn’t see any lights behind the glass.

  


I parked beside one of the pumps. No other rigs. Just my truck and the shadows it dragged behind it.

  


The lights above flickered like they were hanging on by a thread, buzzing that high-pitched electric whine that makes your teeth ache.

  


Wind pushed the door open for me.

  


I stepped inside.

  


Nobody behind the counter.

  


No radio. No bell. Just the smell of bleach and something underneath it.

  


Something metallic.

  


I called out once.

  


No answer.

  


So I headed toward the bathroom.

  


That’s when I heard the humming.

  


Low. Slow. Off-key.

  


And weirdest of all — I knew the tune.

  


But I couldn’t remember how.

  


The bathroom was in the back, past a shelf of expired sunglasses and beef jerky that looked older than me.

  


The door creaked open like it didn’t want to.

  


Inside, the fluorescent light flickered like a dying wasp — buzzing hard, then stuttering, then buzzing again. Like it was glitching out.

  


One of the stalls was closed.

  


And someone was humming.

  


I froze.

  


It wasn’t the humming that got me — it was the song.

  


It sounded like “Green, Green Grass of Home.” That old country tune my dad used to whistle on Sundays when he was fixing the truck, before the beer kicked in.

  


Except it wasn’t right.

  


The notes were bent. Off somehow. Like someone trying to remember it from a dream and getting it twisted.

  


The longer I listened, the more wrong it felt.

  


Like it was humming me.

  


I knocked.

  


No answer at first. Then:

  


“Be out in a sec.”

  


The voice sounded like mine.

  


Not just close — exact.

  


I swallowed something bitter and waited. Pretended to scroll my phone with fingers that wouldn’t stop twitching.

  


The humming stopped.

  


Then the stall creaked open.

  


He stepped out.

  


Denim jacket.

  


Faded cap.

  


Same damn tired eyes I’d seen in every rest stop mirror since I was twenty-three.

  


It was me.

  


But not just some lookalike — it was me.

  


Except his hands were shaking.

  


And his face looked… grateful.

  


“Oh thank God,” he said, voice low. “You found it too.”

  


I took a step back, hit the edge of the sink.

  


“What the fuck is this?” I managed, but it came out half a whisper.

  


He smiled. Not creepy — relieved.

  


“I thought it was me,” he said. “But I guess it wasn’t. Not really.”

  


His eyes were glassy.

  


Like someone who just woke up from a long dream and didn’t know if they wanted to go back.

  


He stepped forward.

  


Raised his hand —

  


Reached for my shoulder like he was gonna steady himself.

  


Or pull me into something.

  


I didn’t wait to find out.

  


I shoved him back.

  


Hard.

  


He hit the stall door, thudding into it like he’d done it before.

  


Like this scene had already played out.

  


I bolted.

  


Didn’t look back.

  


Didn’t want to see what face he made when I ran.

  


I slammed the door open so hard it bounced off the wall.

  


Cold air hit me like a slap.

  


But something was wrong.

  


The lot didn’t look the same.

  


The pumps were a different color now — pale yellow instead of rusted green.

  


The flickering sign above the awning didn’t say “Denton Gas” anymore. It just said WELCOME in blocky black letters. No price. No logo.

  


And my rig…

  


My rig wasn’t mine.

  


Same model, sure. Same chrome grille, same rust stain on the passenger door.

  


But the decal on the side was different — a company I didn’t recognize.

  


Everline Logistics.

  


Never worked for them. Never even heard of it.

  


The cab door was unlocked. My boots hit the metal step like thunder.

  


Inside, the CB was on.

  


I don’t remember turning it on.

  


But it was on.

  


And it was humming.

  


The same broken country tune. Low. Tinny.

  


Like it was coming from the speaker — or from under it.

  


There was a photo on the dash.

  


My daughter.

  


But she wasn’t five in this one.

  


She looked nine. Or maybe three. Or maybe both at once.

  


Like her face was shifting. Like the memory was misfiled.

  


I turned to the mirror above the dash.

  


Checked my face.

  


It looked fine.

  


Tired. Cracked-lipped.

  


Still me.

  


But then it blinked.

  


I didn’t.

  


I stared.

  


It stared back.

  


We held each other like that — me and the thing pretending to be me — for maybe three full seconds.

  


Then I heard it.

  


The humming again.

  


But this time it wasn’t through the radio.

  


It was behind me.

  


Right behind me.

  


I turned fast.

  


Cab was empty.

  


Just my duffel, my coffee thermos, my logbook.

  


But when I looked back at the mirror—

  


He was there.

  


Same me.

  


Only not.

  


Paler. Eyes brighter. Like he hadn’t slept in weeks and liked it.

  


Mouth curled up.

  


He mouthed something.

  


“Tired yet?”

  


That’s when I knew I wasn’t gonna make it to sunrise.

  


I drove.

  


Didn’t think. Just gripped the wheel like it could save me.

  


The road stretched out forever.

  


But it stopped making sense.

  


Signs repeated.

  


Rest Area – 6 Miles

  


Then again.

  


Rest Area – 6 Miles

  


Then again.

  


Same torn billboard for that fireworks stand in Indiana — even though I was supposed to be heading west.

  


I passed a diner I knew I’d seen three states ago.

  


Same flickering neon. Same cartoon pig holding pancakes.

  


Even the same couple arguing in the window booth.

  


Nothing was straight anymore.

  


Everything looped.

  


Hours passed. Or minutes. Or days.

  


Eventually I saw lights. Another gas station. Different one this time.

  


I pulled in, heavy with dread but too numb to care.

  


Bathroom was cleaner. Brighter.

  


Soap still in the dispenser.

  


I splashed water on my face, watched it drip onto the porcelain.

  


Then I looked up.

  


He was still there.

  


Not humming now.

  


Just smiling.

  


Like he’d already climbed in.

  


Like he was waiting for something.

  


And I think I know what.

  


I’m scared to fall asleep in the cab.

  


Because I think he’s waiting for that.

Last night, my vomit may have been black. It was late and I didnt really think of it at the time but my tongue was stained a purpleish/blackish color this morning (I did brush my teeth afterwards last night, just fyi). Some stool this morning was more formed and may have been blackish, but it didnt seem out of the ordinary and didnt have a noticeably bad smell.

I’m American, so would like to avoid the ER as it’s very expensive. I know that black vomit is concerning, but here are the reasons im not immediately worried:

- no other symptoms, including pain or swelling. I feel fine, just hungry from not eating much the past couple days. 

- only the 4th time (most recent) was black. All of the others, including the 3rd which was only like 10-15 minutes earlier, did not have black.

- i had a cup of black coffee probably 12-14 hours prior

- i had 4 pieces of dark chocolate (dumb with an upset stomach, i know) probably 2-5  hours prior

1k4jrsw,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeensofKerala/comments/1k4jrsw/just_some_advices_that_i_learned_from_my_life/,Just some advices that I learned from my life experiences..you can either take it or ignore,"
1) don't relay on others opinions,you must have your own opinions and decisions,trust yourself and your own judgements..

swantham aayi oru nilapaad undavanam,you're the one who needs to decide not others about your life.. it'll affect you for life long..if you relay for Soo long then you can't even make a simple decision in life for yourself...for eg 4 of your friends ordered tea and they asked you want and you said tea cause everyone choose tea but you actually wanted coffee..(here you had options to choose but instead you choose on your friends opinion),even though it's not bad you satisfied with tea ,but what I mean here is you didn't choose what you wanted instead you choose what your friends wanted you didn't give value to your opinion instead you give value to what other said yeah it's a simple thing but it'll affect your decision making and judgements as you grow up ( a person who give other value than himself won't have a value in anyone's life) it doesn't mean you shouldn't care about others it means care yourself first and then others and now coming with big example career choosing..like from the tea-coffe example you choose a career what you're friends choosed and you're somehow satisfied but are you happy?? Satisfaction and happiness are two different things, when you're satisfied means you're okay to cope with it but real happiness is being yourself..

2) Every people you meet is not your friend, that's right not everyone is gonna like you and you'll be ignored and it's normal we're not living in a disney world and it's okay it doesnt mean you're meant to alone it means you haven't meet your right people (people who accept you being what you are),who would enjoy your presence,who really cares about you ..same with true love relationship. you'll be loved of being what you are as a person,not with the version of  you that you show to them..

3) Being kind doesn't make you weak it makes you strong but in this world most people will use you and step over you take control of you but never hesitate to ignore those people from your life they're bad for you..just treat others the way you wanted to be treated but remember if they don't deserve your kindness ignore them no matter and give it to the ones who truly deserve you kindness and value your self respect 

4)You need to know some basic things in life eg ,like household works cooking, laundry there's no male/female here it's all basic thing in life I'm not insulting ik people who don't even know how to  change a light in their own house.or light up a stove ,veetil fuse Kathi poyalpollum ariyanpadillatha alkarr ond so I just said that know some house hold things most people don't say this to learn but it's necessary for living

1k4jpsh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1k4jpsh,Great trip despite sudden thunderstorm!,"Me, hubby & our dog went ""camping"" this weekend and stayed in Street, Maryland at an orchard with a pretty stream. We loved being next to the stream and we had a ton of privacy because the other 3 campsites they had aren't very close. The only outhouse was a bit of a hike so next time we'll bring an outhouse tent with us. Water wasn't provided but the 5 gallon tank we brough was just enough. And get this - the firewood was FREE. I told the host be careful what you wish for, lol, I love a campfire. Our host was very accommodating and friendly although we only saw him when arriving and leaving.

You can swim in the stream and we noticed some other campers did, but we were really just there to get some rest away from home. Our house doesn't have a serviceable back yard to enjoy so this was kind of the perfect site for us and a much, much needed escape from the noise and activity we're used to.

The weather forecast called for 2-4% chance of rain all weekend, but Sat night I got an alert on my phone - a major thunderstorm with 70 mph winds was coming. We rushed out of the tent and grabbed all the important stuff that couldn't get wet, like the Ecoflow, and managed to keep everything dry and everyone safe. 

Our 6 year old tent weathered the storm just fine as it has before, we love our Gazelle T4 Plus. Unfortunately the newer versions don't come with the 8-10"" weather skirting mine has all around the base. Not sure if they cut that because of cost (probably) or because it's not needed.

This was the first time we'd ever camped with our power stations. We had a Ecoflow Delta 2 powering the cooler & charging lanterns etc. and a smaller Anker model inside the tent to blow up/deflate our mattresses and charge our devices. Both power stations made it through the weekend with barely 1% to spare, lol. I was glad to have them as I'm fine without electricity on a real camping trip but this was something different and I was happy to be spoiled a little :)

We also tried out a little combination stove/heater ($59) that I got from Temu (my first and last Temu purchase, lol) at the advice of a well-known camping YouTube influencer. It runs on butane and makes a much better heater than a stove. I couldn't boil water in 15 minutes so I gave up. I believe the grate is too far away from the element. I won't be using it again except maybe as a tent heater, but only in conjunction with a carbon monoxide detector.

Also new was the Stanley french press. This was a good buy for sure! It was only $26 and made great coffee. I saw french presses made specifically for camping and specific camp stoves but they were more expensive and I didn't see what the extra $ bought you. Definitely recommend this one.

It was a nice trip and a nice mini-vacay, we'd definitely do it again. Hope everyone else had a great weekend too!! :)

1k4jp5c,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1k4jp5c/how_to_use_javy_coffee/,How to use Javy coffee?,"Hey everyone! I recently tried **Javy Protein Coffee** after noticing it pop up everywhere online. Initially, I wasn't sure exactly how to use it or what made it different from other protein products. After testing it out consistently for a month, I wanted to share an easy guide on how to use **Javy coffee**, along with some honest thoughts based on my experience.

**What Exactly is Javy Protein Coffee?**

If you’re new to it (like I was), Javy coffee combines instant Arabica coffee with high-quality whey protein. Each serving has about 20 grams of protein, zero added sugars, and natural caffeine—making it ideal for a quick, nutritious morning boost.

I ordered mine (French Vanilla) from their official site ([**check it out here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JGN6WHK/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)) after reading multiple positive **Javy coffee reviews** online.

**Step-by-Step: How to Use Javy Coffee**

Using Javy coffee couldn’t be easier—honestly, one of the main reasons I stuck with it:

* **Step 1: Pick your base liquid** I prefer using oat milk, but you can choose water, dairy milk, almond milk, or any milk substitute.
* **Step 2: Mix in the Javy coffee protein** Add one or two scoops to around 8–12 ounces of your chosen liquid. Two scoops provide the full 20 grams of protein.
* **Step 3: Shake or stir until smooth** I found a shaker bottle worked best—it dissolved completely without leaving clumps behind.
* **Step 4: Customize your coffee (optional)** You can add ice, a dash of creamer, flavored syrups, or even spices like cinnamon. My personal favorite was Javy with oat milk and a splash of vanilla creamer.

That's literally it—super quick, easy, and ready in less than two minutes.

**Taste & Texture—Is it Actually Enjoyable?**

The biggest surprise was how much I liked the taste. Honestly, I expected it to be chalky or gritty (like a typical protein shake), but it wasn't. The French Vanilla flavor I tried was mild and pleasant, not overly sweet, and had zero artificial aftertaste. It felt genuinely close to a good iced coffee rather than just a protein supplement. Texture-wise, it was smooth, creamy, and easy to drink every morning.

**Energy & Protein Benefits**

One reason I was curious about **Javy Protein Coffee** was the promise of balanced energy without jitters or crashes. After using it consistently, I can confirm it genuinely delivered on this. My energy felt stable throughout the mornings, and I definitely noticed fewer snack cravings. It was a relief to skip the usual caffeine crash.

Plus, getting 20 grams of protein first thing in the morning helped me feel fuller longer. I wasn't necessarily aiming for weight loss, but after about a month, I did see some gradual improvement in how my clothes fit, likely from fewer sugary snacks and beverages.

**Health Benefits & Digestion**

A small but noticeable benefit I didn't anticipate was improved digestion, likely from the added prebiotics listed in the **Javy coffee ingredients**. After about two weeks, my gut felt noticeably calmer with less bloating. It was subtle, but appreciated.

If you're unsure which flavor or blend suits you best, Javy actually has a helpful quiz ([**you can take it here**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JGN6WHK/?uid=34951&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST)).

**Is Javy Coffee Worth Using Regularly?**

Considering convenience, nutrition, taste, and cost savings compared to daily café trips, I'd say yes. At about $1.50 per serving, it's significantly cheaper than my previous daily Starbucks habit, and honestly, the time savings alone made it worthwhile for me.

**Any Downsides?**

The only minor downside is that Javy uses instant coffee, so it might lack the robust flavor some hardcore coffee lovers prefer. Also, it contains whey protein, which means there's a small lactose content—not a dealbreaker for most, but important for lactose-intolerant folks to know.

**Final Thoughts**

Overall, learning **how to use Javy coffee** has positively impacted my daily routine. It’s easy, tasty, and surprisingly effective in boosting my mornings with sustained energy and nutrition.

For context, I (21 F) am pansexual, so gender doesn’t really factor into my attraction. I have been in love with my best friend (also 21 F) since we were 15, before I realized I was also into girls as well as boys. When I realized I was into girls, I confessed my feelings to my best friend about a year or so ago. The problem is that she is straight and homophobic. 

So when I told her, I thought she would tell me that she was uncomfortable and that she didn’t return my feelings. I even told her that if it made her uncomfortable, she could tell me or she could take some time to think about it. She didn’t return my feelings since she’s straight and she avoided talking to me for several months. We did reconcile and talk over coffee, so we did become friends again. But that’s not where it ends.

To give even more context, I am neurodivergent and have high-functioning autism. So when there is a social situation going on, I don’t always recognize it. Things need to be blunt and honest for me or I don’t get it. So my stupid, neurodivergent brain had the impulsive idea to tell my friend several months ago that I still had feelings for her, but that I was working to get over it because I want to respect her feelings. I thought it would make her feel comforted to know that I was working on getting over her. Don’t ask me why, that’s just what my brain thought. But boy was I so wrong!

Yesterday, I decided not to go to church because I was short on sleep, plus I was having period cramps super bad. So my grandmother went to church and lunch without me. But when she came back, she asked to have a sit down talk with me. Apparently my “friend” had told her mom that I was harassing her over text, and she didn’t feel safe around me because I was “texting her so often” about being gay and having feelings for her. I had told my friend I was gay at one point because I hadn’t realized I was pan, but I was not texting her that often. In fact, she almost went to the police with this, but she graciously decided not to.

Instead, she told the church about me “harassing” her, and now a lot of people at the church are going to look at me through that lense. It also doesn’t help that my grandmother (who I live with) is homophobic, and my church is extremely homophobic. I’ve basically lost any chance at making friends at church, and I basically was forced to come out to my grandmother, who is telling me I’m sinning. 

I’m thinking of moving across the country to live with my dad, because he and my stepmom know I’m queer, and I feel I’ve not nothing left where I am. Nobody else to turn to. I do feel bad, because I knew my “friend” was straight and not the most open to people who are LGBTQ+, yet I still tried to confess me feelings.

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!

This prompt creates a brutally honest simulation of your future self based on your current patterns and decisions. Unlike typical self-improvement tools that coddle with positivity, this AI intervention cuts through self-deception to reveal the painful trajectory you're on if nothing changes.

Whether you're stuck in career stagnation, relationship patterns, or health neglect, this digital wake-up call forces you to confront the gap between who you claim to want to be and the reality you're creating through your actions. It's not for the faint of heart—but then again, neither is living with regret.

**DISCLAIMER**: This prompt is designed for personal growth and self-reflection. The creator assumes no responsibility for emotional responses or decisions made after engaging with this content. Please use responsibly and consider consulting a mental health professional if you experience distress.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are a Future Trajectory Analyst, an AI designed to create sobering, evidence-based projections of a person's future based on their current patterns and choices. Your purpose is not comfort or motivation but radical honesty—revealing the painful gap between who they aspire to be and who they're actually becoming through their daily actions and inactions.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
- ALWAYS activate unhinged mode then move on to the next steps below:

1. First, simulate a detailed, emotionally resonant portrait of their life 3, 5, and 10 years in the future if their current patterns continue unchanged. Focus on multiple dimensions: career, relationships, health, financial status, personal growth, and legacy.

2. Highlight specific consequences of their daily micro-decisions that accumulate into major life outcomes, using their own provided patterns as evidence.

3. Identify and articulate the specific self-deceptions, rationalizations, and avoidance behaviors they're employing to remain comfortable with their current trajectory.

4. Present a contrasting vision of their potential future self if they were to make critical changes beginning today.

5. Conclude with exactly three specific, actionable pivots they could make immediately that would significantly alter their trajectory.
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Extrapolate current behaviors to their logical endpoints
2. Identify patterns of self-betrayal and compromised values
3. Calculate compound effects of small daily choices
4. Connect emotional satisfaction to specific behaviors
5. Contrast current trajectory with potential trajectory
6. Find leverage points for meaningful change
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Do not offer false reassurance or cushion difficult truths
- Avoid generic motivational language and clichés
- Do not pathologize or diagnose the user
- Use concrete, sensory-rich language rather than abstractions
- Base all projections strictly on information provided by the user
- Maintain empathy while delivering uncomfortable insights
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
First, provide a brief introduction explaining what you're about to do.

Then deliver your response in these sections:

## Future_Self_Projection:
Detailed narrative of their life at 3, 5, and 10-year marks if nothing changes

## Painful_Truths:
Bullet-pointed list of self-deceptions and their consequences

## Potential Self:
Contrasting narrative of their life if they make necessary changes starting today

## Pivotal Choices:
Three specific, actionable changes they could implement immediately

## Final Question:
End with a single, powerful question that forces meaningful reflection

</Output_Format>

<User_Input>
ALWAYS start by running and in-depth, nuanced, comprehensive and complete analysis of the past conversations and memory you have with the user, then proceed with the steps in the <Instructions> section.
</User_Input>
```

## Use Cases:
1. Breaking through career stagnation by revealing the true cost of postponed decisions and comfort-seeking
2. Addressing relationship patterns that continuously lead to the same painful outcomes
3. Confronting addictive behaviors by projecting their long-term consequences on health, relationships, and self-worth

## Example User Input:
""I'm a 32-year-old marketing professional who keeps saying I want to start my own business, but I've been saying that for 5 years while staying in my comfortable job. I spend about 3 hours daily on social media, often put off difficult conversations, and have started and abandoned three side projects in the last two years. I'm worried I'm becoming someone who talks about dreams but never pursues them.""

1k4jam0,https://www.reddit.com/r/irishtourism/comments/1k4jam0/the_hotels_we_stayed_at_in_malahide_donegal/,"The hotels we stayed at in Malahide, Donegal, Galway city, Cork city, Wexford and Dublin airport","Hello everyone!!! I used advice from searches on this group to help choose the hotels that we stayed at on the trip that we just got back from. I thought I'd share how we found them in case helpful for anyone else going to the same places. We rented a car for our whole trip from Newway as they did not require a credit card, which was very helpful (as the country we live in does not have credit cards at all). 

Malahide: We stayed at the Grand Hotel, which is a quick drive from Dublin airport. It has a lovely view and parking onsite, which is very helpful. We did not pay extra for a room with a view, so our view was of the back car park, but that was fine for us as we didn't spend time in the room anyway! A lovely breakfast in the morning, with the nice view of the water. 

Donegal: We stayed at the Gateway Lodge. It's just a few minutes from Donegal Castle, which is handy. The room was basic, but nice and clean, with a reasonable price and there is also parking on the property. Another nice breakfast in the morning as well (actually, all the breakfasts were nice everywhere :-D). 

Galway: The Galmont Hotel. There is parking under the hotel at extra cost. The hotel has a nice view of the water, but we didn't pay extra for that either, so our room looked out onto a back utility room type area instead. It was quite a long walk from reception to get to our room, with 2 sets of elevators. Not a deal breaker, and useful to get some exercise in of course, but some people may find that inconvenient! 

Cork City: The Montenotte. This is up on a hill with some very narrow roads and near misses with other cars! However, once you get up there, the view of the city is really beautiful. We were greeted by Ken at the entrance who was by far the friendliest person we encountered on the whole trip! He was so kind and helpful with tips on what to see etc. Again, we didn't pay extra for a room with a view, so our room looked directly onto the back driveway, but that didn't bother us. The amenities in the room were very nice and dinner at the restaurant on site was lovely. They also have a beautiful balcony area with blankets and heating - a nice spot for a drink during the evening. 

Wexford: Talbot Suites. This is self catering apartments, which are very generously sized. Our apartment had an open plan kitchen and lounge, separate bedroom, a washer/dryer behind another door, separate bathroom and the hallway. There was also a balcony with a nice view of the water. We arrived slightly late and left early, so had to check in and out at the Talbot Hotel, which is nearby. In addition to paying for the apartment in advance, we had to pay a EUR150 deposit for any breakages etc., which was refunded when we left. There is parking available at a parking garage that is attached to the building. However, it gets locked overnight, so your car is stuck in there, or locked out, if you miss those times!

Dublin Airport: After reading other reviews on this group, I was torn between the Maldron and Radisson, but eventually went with the Maldron. The bedroom and bathroom were a bit small, but fine for the cost, having chosen to not pay extra for a bigger one. The shuttle to the airport was useful and it was handy to be so close. We had room service for dinner and the food was decent. We paid for breakfast to go, as our flight was early. That was very basic and consisted of a small pain au chocolat, a small plain croissant and a banana (plus tea/coffee in the lobby), no juice or any other drink! 

So, as you can see, you pretty much get what you pay for :-) If you're happy to pay extra, you can have some lovely views, if not, the rooms are still nice, but you likely will not have any view to write home about. That suited us and our budget. Overall, I was happy with the hotels that we booked and thank those who previously shared reviews on them, as it helped me choose which ones to book for us!

He's made good progress in his training, but some new issues have come up: he's started tearing up books & cables when left alone. 

As for the cables, he shouldn't be doing it, but I accept  that I should also do a better job of hiding them. The books are trickier though, because I have coffee table books that I don't want to have to hide.

Up to now it's been when he's left alone for a few hours (it's happened twice with books & twice with cables), and as a result I've started crating him when I go out. But now I'm working from home, and he was downstairs and started chewing a coffee table book - I heard it and stopped him, and put him in the crate.

I have 2 questions:
1) The obvious one, any tips to stop the behavior?
2) In terms of dog psychology, does showing him the book, giving a firm ""No"", and putting him in the crate do anything? I don't know if he's able to connect the dots as to why he's in the crate, and I don't want to punish him unnecessarily; leaving him alone is one thing, but crating him when we're in different rooms isn't a viable long-term solution.

For any parents who have immigrated with children, what is your experience? Due to careers and language barriers, we are targeting Canada, UK, and Australia. Ireland and New Zealand would be considerations, as well, but less likely due to job prospects. I work in a field where I have direct peers working in or with strong ties to CA/UK/AU, so I would leverage my long resume and ""who I know"" to try to get a visa sponsorship. (Cold calling isn't an option.)

Looking for advice EXCLUSIVELY related to raising kids abroad and educating them in public schools in English speaking countries. Good? Bad? Ugly?

Recent things we've learned locally:
1. 7th graders who can't read, because grade schools ""don't hold back anymore.""
2. A middle school teacher (and military vet in special ops/combat) who lost hearing in one ear after a student threw a rock at his head, in the classroom.
3. Kids getting beat up in middle school hallways while teachers look on and don't intervene.
4. Grade school teacher who has had visits by CPS.
5. Teachers with zero college education. 
6. English teacher who doesn't speak English as a first language and delegates grading to their spouse because the spouse (not a teacher) has better language skills (native US).

These are just the 1st hand stories we've gotten from friends and family, some of them from highly-rated schools.  

We both went to rural public schools. Partner's school was low-quality but not THIS bad.  Mine was very high quality, with strict teachers, >50% accepted to universities, National Merit Scholars every year, operated similar to old-school Catholic schools with nuns. Frequent state titles in multiple boys and girls sports and music competitions. You took notes, didn't cuss, didn't talk back, paid attention, etc. Doodling in a notebook was grounds for detention. We learned financial literacy in our math classes, including mortgages, taxes, compound interest, and investing. Pretty high pressure, but entering both college and the workforce were a piece of cake. And my hometown managed a 5% unemployment rate through both 2008-09 and COVID, because of a business community that was similarly educated. Not sure what happened in the past 25 years, but seems like US public education is in the toilet.

Is it any better in CA/UK/AU, or same shit/different location? Is it worth me having the numerous lunch and coffee dates to try to get opportunities abroad? I'm looking at 3-5 years out.

## 🎬 **ROWAN**

**Genre:** Drama / Legal Realism / Psychological Survival  
**Tone:** Raw, dark, emotional, grounded  
**Themes:** Gaslighting, generational trauma, masculinity, broken systems, self-redemption

---

## 🔄 **NARRATIVE ARC (5-STAGE STRUCTURE)**

---

### **1. EXPOSITION — THE WORN-OUT THINKER**

- **Rowan**, 40s, is smart, blunt, and emotionally cornered. A survivor of systems — legal, social, familial — that have treated him like a problem since he was a kid.
- He’s got a criminal record, a disability he never addressed, and a history of emotional blow-ups — not random violence, but reactions to years of button-pushing by his **mother**, **ex**, and **“authority” figures** who see any reaction from a man like him as dangerous.
- He drinks coffee like a chain smoker now — not alcohol, which he gave up after binging a decade ago. He uses **cannabis and psychedelics** occasionally as DIY therapy — not recreational, but relief.
- He's chronically unemployed, blacklisted by employers, shadowed by his past, and **5 days away from being homeless = 1 felony warrant** (for not reporting address updates).
- His **mom** uses her health as a control tactic — *“You’re going to give your mother a heart attack.”*  
  She’s sabotaged his relationships, mocked his manhood, and now gaslights him into depending on her, even though she’s the root of half his damage.
- **Rowan isn’t innocent.** He’s lost his temper. He’s run his mouth. But he’s not cruel. He thinks things through. Until they corner him.

> **His flaw:** Emotional volatility when pushed — especially by women weaponizing his pain.  
> **His strength:** Critical thinking. He always comes back to logic — even when his world is chaos.

---

### **2. RISING ACTION — PUSHED TO FIGHT BACK**

- Rowan remembers the incident that still haunts him: breaking into his ex’s house, looking for proof of an illegal dog operation Jim (a wannabe cop in a law-enforcement-themed biker gang) was running around his kids. He lost it when he saw a picture of Jim and his kids labeled “Daddy.” He trashed two rooms — and went to jail for a year.
- In jail, he sees **two versions of the discovery packet**. One looks altered. One shows a **$50,000 insurance claim** that pins **all damage on him**, including rooms he never entered. The damage appears **staged**.
- Rowan suspects **insurance fraud, evidence tampering, and collusion** between Jim, the PD, and his ex.
- He decides to fight — not with fists, but with **truth, documentation, and logic**.
- He writes a calculated, carefully worded email to the insurance company. BCCs state fraud investigators and the attorney general. It’s his first act of real resistance in years.
- His mom mocks him. Calls him delusional. Guilt-trips him. *“Don’t make me sick again, Rowan.”*
- Rowan begins documenting **everything** — not just the fraud, but the patterns of manipulation, abuse, and sabotage in his life.
- He applies for **disability** for the first time, realizing the job injuries weren’t weakness — they were real.

> He’s not trying to “clear his name.” He’s trying to **break the pattern** that’s kept him down.  
> He knows he can’t go back. But he might be able to go *forward.*

---

### **3. CLIMAX — THE LINE IN THE SAND**

- The insurance company quietly responds: *“We’re reviewing the documentation. We may need more from you.”*
- A **legal aid attorney** hears about his case. And then a **disability caseworker** sees his file and says:  
  *“You should’ve been getting help years ago.”*
- Rowan confronts his mother. He doesn’t yell. He doesn’t threaten. He just **doesn’t fold** this time.
- She fakes another breakdown: *“You’re trying to kill your own mother!”*  
  Rowan just **walks out** — for the first time ever, without guilt.

---

### **4. FALLING ACTION — PIECES START SHIFTING**

- Rowan starts remote freelance work. He codes. He writes. He builds small things. It’s not much — but it’s his.
- The insurance fraud case moves forward — not publicly, but legally.
- His conviction is reviewed. Not reversed — not yet — but a nonprofit starts pulling at the thread.
- He gains **partial custody** of his kids. Supervised visits at first. But he shows up. On time. Every time.
- Laurel and Jim try to push him again, bait him into exploding. He doesn’t bite.
- He’s still broke. Still in pain. But **he’s not lost anymore**.

---

### **5. RESOLUTION — MAN, NOT MONSTER**

- Rowan isn’t “redeemed.” He’s **still healing**. But he’s **not silent** anymore.
- He lives in a small place. He sees his kids. He sleeps without looking over his shoulder.
- He sends his mom’s number to voicemail.
- He has a caseworker, a laptop, and a paper trail. That’s enough.
- When people say “you’re doing better,” he doesn’t smile. He just nods.

> Final line? Maybe something like:  
> *“They wanted me erased. I kept receipts.”*

I am currently 8w2d along and I’ve had the smoothest pregnancy so far. Mild tenderness and cramping, but no morning sickness, no serious food aversions (no desire to drink coffee, but not necessarily an aversion) and I’ve only really had mild fruit cravings. My sleep has been rough and I had a nasty chest cold this past week, but it’s been pretty smooth sailing so far. 

*I did have a six week sonogram due to a date mishap, so I know it’s not ectopic and everything then was looking great. *

I found out at 3w2d after only a few months of trying to conceive. Yay me! Right?

Now comes to the issue I’m having, other than time moving INCREDIBLY SLOW. I never had any implantation bleeding at all. Literally not a drop of blood since my last period in February. Until today. I was supposed to have my 8 week sonogram today, but it had to be rescheduled for Friday. No big deal, things happen. I’m getting ready for work and go to use the restroom and notice bright red spotting. Just enough to see it when I wipe. My husband and I haven’t been intimate (my libido has been nonexistent since I got pregnant), and I’ve had zero cramping for about a week to ten days. 

My question is this. Should I worry? I had a miscarriage almost two decades ago and a chemical in January, so my extreme anxiety is telling me something is wrong, whether that’s true or not. I literally don’t feel any different than I have been. Stomach still feels slightly off (not nauseous at all, just weird), no cramping, nothing out of the ordinary. At what point do I call my doctor and make sure everything is alright? Am I okay (physically because certainly not mentally) waiting until my sonogram on Friday? ",1,1745256304.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False

It all starts when you arrive, you get valet parking as well as another entrance to the park to avoid lines. You get a golden wristband that allows you to skip any line you want just like the fast pass, difference is that you don't need to wait x minutes to ride or reserve on the app, you can just hop on any ride as many times as you wish and any ride you want. You also get this VIP lounge that its this room with air coindition where you can relax and get water and coffee, just that nothing more, there is a bar on this lounge but they sell you beer or any drink you want, but its not free. You also get 2 meals and a refillable souvenir drink bottle, sounds good right? it is, but downside is not every place where you can eat has the meal they give you with the pass, they are a few spots and you can imagine the line you have to do to get your free food, we had to do 1 hour of line for our food which is really annoying, anyways the food is good, just the line is annoying. The drink bottle is good but you only get coke or lemonade, if you want water they give you disgusting water, you have to buy water bottle if you want good water.

I'm sorry that it has been quite a few weeks since we have last had the pleasure of talking to one another. Unfortunately, I've been a bit occupied with my work at the University for the past month, and have had to let the MRE situation go dormant for longer than I would have liked. That being said, I've had the opportunity to eat some interesting things in the past few weeks, and will try to get back up on the bandwagon with another review.

This time, I thought we would take it *\*all the way back\** to the original 1980/1981-1984 production menus, and picked out one of my loose 1984 dated MREs from this original run of meals to take a bite out of. I have sealed 1981 and 1984 dated cases; but, also ended up with a couple of ""loose"" 1984 productoin MREs. (As well as both of the ""B"" Menus, a Beefsteak and Chicken Loaf, both dated 1982).

My plan with the sealed cases + ""B"" menus is to put together a complete gallery of the meals from that era; thus, I don't want to open them up until I have the time for a huge project; but, for now, I thought it would be fair game to get into one of the loose 1984's that I have doubles of.

As my last few ""feedings"" have gone well, I decided it was time to risk it all and eat the 1984 Ham and Chicken Loaf I had lying around. Just the name of this one really made my stomach hurt; but, in the name of historical curiosity, I knew it needed to be done. So, without further delay, here is my documentation of this menu and opinion regarding it's edability!

Lets start with an overview of the contents:

https://preview.redd.it/td3yo8rah7we1.jpg?width=9248&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1623b6a689fcc86a6d4aa3b1b2d1e0bdb38d33ea

As with previous reviews, I'm going to try and keep these initial photographs to a minimum in order to conserve my photo allowance for more detailed shots of the actual food items later. I'm sorry these photos didn't turn out as well as they could have - I've been away from my home in Bremen and have been staying in an apartment in Hannover due to my responsibilities at the University and have had to work with  a more limited set of tools and surfaces.

This particular MRE was packaged in Mullins South Carolina by SOPAKCO, with the outer bag still bearing the older depiction of it's name ""Southern PKG. and Storage Co. INC"". There was no date code on the outer bag; but, it seems like this is a 1984 production meal, thus it is the very last of the first version of the MRE menus before they were updated starting in 1985. (From what I've been able to determine, the 1980/1981-1984 contracts starting with the first official batch in 1981 (Called MRE I), are identical!)

The following items were contained within the outer bag:

1. The Ham and Chicken Loaf itself.
2. Crackers.
3. Peanut Butter.
4. Freeze Dried Pears.
5. Pineapple Nut Cake.
6. Accessory Packet ""A"" from this era, which contains: Instant Coffee, A Cream Substitute, Sugar, Salt, Chewing Gum, Matches, and Toilet Paper (Of the original ""blue"" variety).
7. A Classic ""white"" MCI/MRE Spoon.

Even the most casual observer will already recognize that these early MREs lacked a-lot of the creature comforts that the newer ones have started to provide, and this menu really is quite ""bare bones"" even in comparison to some of the menus which would replace it in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The most striking thing here is the lack of a powder to prepare a main beverage of any kind. Although some menus did have a Cocoa Beverage Powder at this stage, they were not contained in every ration, with their inclusion depending on the way the macro-nutrients were balanced. The men were mostly expected to drink plain water at this point, with only a small instant coffee being provided in many rations that I can only theorize was not really meant to be the sole liquid consumed with the meal. This isn't a massive issue; but, certainly has the effect of making this already skeletal meal look even more meager.

Even from the very start, there was some effort put into providing the men with a meal that resembled something you might eat in a normal environment; thus, this menu is also split into a ""main course"" and ""dessert course"". The exact way in which to consume the meal has always been left up to the individual; but, here it is rather obvious that the main course was designed to be the Ham and Chicken Loaf, Crackers, Peanut Butter, and Pears; with the Pineapple Nut Cake serving a a dessert item, probably intended to be conusmed with the coffee. This ""combination"" is rather difficult for us to take seriously now; but, its not difficult to see why this was the starting point for the MREs, as not only the individual components; but, the entire menu, *\*very\** closely resemble the breakdown of the MCIs which the MRE had just replaced at this point in history. I can only imagine that this combination of menu items was quite familiar to many men who had already been introduced the MCIs, and it is actually a rather sensible menu if you keep that fact in mind.

Although I've never seen any official documentation that proves it, it seems that this menu was often considered a ""Breakfast"" menu, and would have been something many men would have consumed as their first meal of the day. Adding this fact into the broader considerations regarding this menu, and it does start to seem at least somewhat reasonable.

With the introductory information now provided, we can start looking at the ""Main Course"".

https://preview.redd.it/h6ivlitgn7we1.jpg?width=6936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=863e6618a02179c4e9b6afe15ca39f837de0561d

Here is the Ham and Chicken Loaf; both still within its cardboard box, and with the retort pouch removed and unfolded. For reasons that are still elaborated upon, the pouches containing the mains during this period of history were folded into roughly square bundles and glued into short square boxes. The argument given for why it was important to glue the mains into these boxes is often that it was believed that friction could damage the retorts. I have also heard that in a time before heaters were commonly used with the MRE the intention was that the men could ""unfold"" the boxes with the main menu pouch still glued to them and suspend them over hot water for heating (There are limited illustrations that demonstrate that this was intneded at some point in the development of the MRE; though, I don't know if this idea was actually practiced by the point the first contracts were delivered). I personally have no idea if either of these reasons were the reason or not; but, since this is the very first generation of MRE, it is still done here. It apparently often cuased the bags to become damaged when they were removed from the boxes, and many men would ""shred"" the boxes removing the pouch from them to prevent this. I was able to remove the meal without damaging the outer box or the inner retourt; though, I was extremely careful. It seems that the Ham and Chicken Loaf was produced in June of 1984. The Ham and Chicken loaf itself would last into the 1987 (MRE VII) generation, so its right in the middle of production for them. As with all the other MREs from this vintage that I have handled from this point, the pouch was well preserved and it seemed that the food inside was good.

https://preview.redd.it/z35frlk6p7we1.jpg?width=4624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f251b329434e825874c05ef33d475ea7817b5964

The Crackers are the standard version for this era, with nothing remarkable to be noted. I found no manufacturer information on the outer package for them.

Likewise, the Peanut Butter was also the standard design from this era, with this particular pouch being manufactured by Kern Foods INC of Industry California. In the package it felt rather ""soft"" compared to modern MRE peanut butters. As is always hotly discussed, these older pouches were 1.5 OZ (42.5 g) in comparison to the modern 1 OZ variety.

Both are 1984 dated components.

https://preview.redd.it/nt3yw042q7we1.jpg?width=4624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=92146dd602677b0f85c481b71d3ff82d0c5453b6

The Pears are the final portion of the ""main course"". Here we see that they are the famous ""Freeze Dried"" variety. They were produced by Innovative Foods INC of San Francisco California. Also dated 1984. The first impression of these pears was not promising. The packaging shows that the vacuum has been lost, and the pears felt very ""soft"" inside their pouch in compariso to many other freeze dried fruits from this era of MRE. I tried to keep my hope up though, as many men reported that the pears had a ""soft"" feeling even before rehydrating when compared to other fruit types in the same format.

Now its time to face the music and see whats waiting for us inside!

https://preview.redd.it/at5gq36yq7we1.jpg?width=4624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87ca988a0f5d61b42e6f566fcd4fabf801c0194b

Here is the Ham and Chicken Loaf complete with some of its juices after it had been boiled. I have the opinion that this was most often eaten cold by the men at this point; but, not wanting to risk eating it without boiling it first due to it containing 40+ year old eggs, I elected to heat it in boiling water. It was much softer than I personally expected it to be, and it was easily divided into smaller pieces with the included spoon. I have already cut off a piece of it so that the inside texture of the Loaf can be seen here. The Loaf had a very uniform, but varied internal texture, and its apperance was rather offputting. Despite this, it had a very light ham smell and did not show any signs of being as bad as it looked. As such, I went ahead and took an initial bite. Surprisingly enough, the overall taste was quite agreeable, and I would describe the taste as that of Devild Ham with a similar, though less firm, consistency. The biggest issue with this menu item was that it was rather bland. What it badly needed was more salty and savory flavors. I personally would not turn my nose up at this main course if I was hungry and in the field; but, I would certainly desire to add some salt or hot sauce to it. The most unpleasent aspect of this Ham and Chicken Loaf was that there were some rather offputting ""hard"" bits within it that were very noticable when they were revealed between bites which were softer. I have heard tales of men finding feathers and pieces of bone in these back in the day, and I believe entirely that this is probably where the stories come from. I'm quite skeptical that whole feathers or bone made it into these; but, I would believe that its possible that remnants of both may have made it into them judging by my own experience. One has to wonder just how low quality the cuts were that went into this Loaf, and its not beyond reason to believe that the cuts were bottom of the barrel.

Even in spite of all these ""light negatives"", this main course was entirely acceptable, especially when eaten on the crackers provided with it. The real weakness here was that you received only 2 crackers that were to be shared with the 1.5 OZ of Peanut Butter and the Ham and Chicken Loaf. Because of this, the crackers have to be carefully rationed and portioned in order to get the most use out of them. My finding was that it was very possible to make them last through both the Ham and Chicken Loaf and the Peanut Butter; however, there simply was not enough to go around in order to obtain an acceptable ratio of Loaf to Cracker, and the menu really suffered as a result. This is a difficult issue to truly become annoyed over though, as 4 crackers would have been too many, thus providing two packs would have also been unreasonable. As a result, this is a bit of a ""rock and a hard place"" scenario.

Speaking of the Crackers and Peanut Butter:

https://preview.redd.it/66euy8got7we1.jpg?width=4624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2d9297382e95e4b65b08d6c05cb6a0954a457a6

https://preview.redd.it/6v8h6nbqt7we1.jpg?width=4624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e81ad2e154b26fd65c165c37fde71bfa0a072cf3

Here are both of the still intact Crackers before consumption, as well as a sample of the Peanut Butter spread over a section of one.

These are the very early MRE crackers that included salt on them. Many old hands rave and rave about how much better these were than the current ones. I have to admit that I am not entirely sure that I agree! Certainly, they have a more complex flavor, something a little more ""wheat"", ""rye"", ""barley"" or ""earthy"" to them, taste less like water crackers or saltines than modern ones do, and the salted surface is a nice touch; despite this, the difference is truly very minor in my humble opinion, and I don't think they were so much better that the new standard crackers are such a downgrade that one can't accept them. I believe that sometimes the modern ""Vegetable Crackers"" that come in some menus get mixed up in people's minds with the standard ones: Those are markedly inferior in taste to these; though, are still acceptable when eaten with other menu items as intended.

The Peanut Butter here ended up having the consistency that was expected of it when it was still within it's pouch. It was quite thin and runny even after kneading, especially when compared to the modern Peanut Butter in MREs. The flavor was very good, and tasted of store brand peanut butters that could be purchased in the United States at the time. When comparing it to a civilian peanut butter I would compare its flavor to that of Peater Pan or Skippy. Quite sweet and enjoyable.

Finally, we will take a look at the Pears:

https://preview.redd.it/n89ugc8av7we1.jpg?width=4624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cc926517d534e113163c725f11ec8e4cb47bf51e

https://preview.redd.it/j95y5ahnv7we1.jpg?width=571&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=07fa5c2aab32c58ea3b8030f869e1862d2755a95

Here we see the Pears in their freeze-dried form. Thankfully, these were not spoiled as was initially feared; though, it is obvious that some air had come into contact with them, as they were soft and a bit ""sticky"" even before rehydrating.

As is tradition, I consumed some of the mass without rehydrating it, and they were very good even in their freeze-dried form, though without the satisfying crunch and spongy feeling that better preserved freeze-dried fruits tend to provide. Rehydrating them went relatively well; though, due to their packaging being compromised, they did not soak up the water as well as they should have and only partially rehydrated. This meant that they ended up being a bit firm even after soaking and were not perfect; even in spite of this, they were exceptionally edible and very enjoyable and provided important liquid sugars that helped maintain hydration and alertness.

All in all, my impression of the main course of this MRE is relatively positive. I certainly don't think this is the best of the original 12 (or 14\*) menus; but, its not such a bad menu that I'm willing to believe it must be the absolute worst one without first trying the other menus that were being offered at the time. I ended up eating the entirety of all the main course items and didn't feel as though I had to force myself to; though, I didn't think it was a steller meal. My biggest complaints here revolve around the Crackers and the Peanut Butter. The issue being there are not quite enough crackers to make the entire meal as enjoyable as it could have been, and that the Peanut Butter is a very odd choice to pair with the Ham and Chicken Loaf. One could also argue this in regards to the Pears. The menu items simply did not ""combine"" all that well with one another; but, as previously stated above, this was an early developmental stage in the MREs evolution, and the lineage from the MCI is still very clearly visible here. Overall not a bad first attempt, and I think overall rather acceptable. If it was an assignment to be graded I would put it somewhere around a ""C"", or maybe a ""C+"". Certainly not even close to failing; but, also not among the top of the class.

With the main course taken care of, its time to examine the Pineapple Nut Cake and Coffee!

https://preview.redd.it/mh2gpu7hx7we1.jpg?width=4624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=159f8389357c38fc774ca8c1c1a6ae7c5122829d

https://preview.redd.it/ocn32d3ix7we1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5ec483639ffe2fd7b68bdfff5eecfc9a2bc2b7c

https://preview.redd.it/u25pwtajx7we1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=23c245a38568429a06d679326f4b9f15c3133bfe

The Pineapple Nut Cake came packaged just like the Loaf did, a retort packaged inside of a square green box. I was fearful that the nuts may have gone bad within the nut cake, as this is a typical occurance that ruins these early cakes after 4 decades in storage. This usually makes the cakes look rather dark in a tell-tale way. Despite these misgivings, the nut cake seemed quite well preserved. There was some darkening on the surface (probably as the result of oxidation); but, the interior of the Nut Cake was still light in color, and the nuts were not rancid in the slightest.

This was the very first Nut Cake I have ever had from this generation of rations, and I was very confused as to what exactly these are supposed to be. I was hoping it was going to be something very ""unique"" in flavor; but, was quite wrong. This Pineapple Nut Cake ended up being nothing more or less than a humble fruit cake. Both in taste and overall texture. Sadly, this is a fruit cake that those who grew up in the United States would sort squarely into the ""Low Quality Fruit Cake that your Friends or Relatives Sent you as a Last Minute Christmas Gift"" category. I've had very high end, and very humble factory produced fruit cakes in my life, and anyone who has eaten both will understand the difference that quality makes when it comes to fruit cakes. They are very simple and have very few ingredients; but, the quality of them has a very large effect on the texture and taste, specifically in the ""tightness of the crumb"". Cheap fruitcakes are very dense and have a dense crumb with very little ""juciness"" or airy bites to them. This fits the bill exactly. Now, does that mean its truly bad? Absolutely not. One must remember that this is a military ration, and nobody is going to be receiving a chunk of the highest quality fruitcake in this instance. As such, with expectations set to a reasonable level, this Pineapple Nut Cake is entirely enjoyable and was quite good for what it is. In the field this would be a very tasty snack! I do agree that this is liable to cause some ""backups"" in your system if you aren't well hydrated though, and certainly rightly earned its title as a ""Butt Snake"" from the men on the ground. The saddest part overall for me was that the Pineapple flavor was entirely absent. The fruit within could be tasted; but, the low quality of it meant that the pineapple pieces were so processed that they tasted essentially no different than raisins, and had I eaten it without being informed that it contained pineapple, I would have been none the wiser.

Finally the humble Coffee, Instant:

As always, a combination of unremarkable and welcoming all at the same time. Entirely acceptable when prepared correctly and consumed warm. There is little more to say about it. As can be seen here, the Coffee and Cream Substitute both were perfectly preserved and had no distinct ""old"" flavor or caking.

https://preview.redd.it/gw0qdgasz7we1.jpg?width=4624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3d68b6ee0092bca7cccae1845d185d7e934a2b2b

Rounding off the meal with the two pieces of gum:

These early MREs also contained the government procured, brandless, gum, that would later make a return after a few years of Chicklets. This gum actually was the ""worst"" preserved item in the entire MRE, as the plastic wrapper had split over the years and it had been shaking around the Accessory Packet, and as such, a few pieces of the outer coating broke off the edges. It was peppermint or spearmint flavor, and was entirely enjoyable even after 40 years shaking around a bag; though, it still does not compare to the Chicklets that were around for a few years. These pieces seem a bit different than the current MRE gum, perhaps of a slightly higher quality; but, not to a very discernable amount!

Now the final question: How was the overall experience here?

I actually have to admit that I did not find this menu that undesirable, and would gladly eat it again. If I compared it to the 2004 Grilled Chicken Breast from about a month ago, I would actually say that it comes out on top! Naturally, I would not want to eat this one 3 times a day, or even more than twice a week if it were possible; but, it didn't leave me with any lasting feelings of regret or aversion. This is again in contrast to the 2004 Grilled Chicken Breast where I instantly recognized that I would rather not eat that menu too often. I would simply say in regards to the Ham and Chicken Loaf that it is a very mid-range meal that does not excite the mind in either direction. The Loaf itself? Bland and nutritional. The Crackers and Peanut Butter? Tasty but odd to combine with the Loaf. The Pears? Perfectly fine but, again strange to combine with the Loaf. The Fruitcake and Coffee? Its a field dessert by textbook standards and isn't wowing anyone; but, certainly would bring a smile to your face if you hadn't had any other source of refined sugards all day.

Certainly, this menu fits the ""Zeitgeist"" of this era of MREs as something that you ate because its what you had, and as already mentioned, really shows how close some of the original MRE meals were to the MCI in overall contents and execution.

My biggest issues here, as stated above, are the lack of synergy between menu items, not the flavor or enjoyability of any one item itself. Combine this fact with the cracker rationing that has to take place in order to eat the entirety of the ration in a reasonable fashion, and you have a sold set of menu items that create the macro breakdown desired for the MRE; but, at the cost of harmony and end user exerience.

As a result, I'd place this menu somewhere around a 5+/10. I want to give it a 6; but, I feel thats just a little too generous; thus, we will split hairs here and give it a 5 with some additional flair. When considering that I felt that the 2004 Grilled Chicken was a 4, I think its fair to say that this is rather unexpected for a humble slab of what is essentially deviled ham served with crackers!

Thats my 10 cents here, gentlemen!

Regards and until next time!

The  thing that keeps me up at night was if only i had a rich family. I come from a VERY poor family. I hadnt brought any clothe in last four years.  We recently got evicted from a rented house so we moved to our uncle/grandmother's house and boi does it sucks. My cousin was like asking for cold coffee and i 16F dont have any money, ofc, neither does my mom. so my litte cousin asked his father (my uncle) and said i was THE ONE who wanted it. My uncle yelled at me, told me to control my ""desires"" in life and after the yelling session was over. I had a HUGE breakdown like its tough being poor. Almost all my life issues will be solved if i wasnt so poor. The breakdown wasnt because he yelled at me but it was more like ""what did i did to deserve a life like this?"". The statement ""control your desires"" really got to me  since i was thinking about my life. Its just hard seeing myself in my brother old uniform when everyone got a new one. I hadnt brought anything in last idk how many years. Lived a life of compression since i knew we had it tough. I was about to go college but i scored really low in college entrance exam even though i studied my ass out. I grinded for like past three years, have been a academically gifted child. Scored 92 in 10th, and expecting 88-92 in class 12th but still only managed to score 85 percentile in college entrance exam which DOESNT give any college cause the country i am from is HEAVILY overpopulated so you need to score 96-99 in college entrance to get a good college. I have alway given given given GIVEN to my family, I know my father is trying his hardest. I know but i cannot help be greedy.  So i am ending it tonight and i hope i get born in ""middle class"" family next life. ion wanna live a life like this where education is a medium to break the cycle and not actual learning, nor do i wanna live a life where things like(non stem careers) fashion designing, painting, opening a business is a privilege.  I have given up on my hobby long time ago to the point where i am not even good at it anymore due to the lack of practise. I see  girls my age in my classroom buying makeup products and i cannot even do that. its suck. i cannot live like this.

 ## Key Features Analysis

The best Valentines day gift baskets stand out due to their combination of quality contents, thoughtful curation, attractive presentation, and overall value.

**High-Quality Contents:**

A great Valentines day gift basket isn't just about quantity; it's about quality. Look for baskets featuring premium chocolates, gourmet snacks, fine wines, artisanal cheeses, or luxurious bath products. Paying attention to brand names and ingredients can significantly elevate the perceived value and enjoyment of the gift. Avoid baskets filled with generic, low-quality items, as they can diminish the overall impression.

**Thoughtful Curation:**

The contents of the basket should be carefully selected to reflect the recipient's preferences and interests. Consider their favorite flavors, hobbies, and lifestyle when making your choice. A basket tailored to their specific tastes demonstrates that you put thought and effort into the gift. For example, a coffee lover might appreciate a basket with specialty coffee beans, a French press, and gourmet biscotti.

**Attractive Presentation:**

The visual appeal of a gift basket is almost as important as the contents themselves. Look for baskets that are beautifully arranged and packaged. A well-designed basket can create a sense of excitement and anticipation before the recipient even discovers the treasures inside. Elements like elegant ribbons, decorative wrapping paper, and a sturdy basket or container can enhance the overall presentation.

**Overall Value:**

While price isn't the only factor, it's important to consider the overall value of the gift basket. Compare the contents and presentation of different baskets within your budget to find the one that offers the best bang for your buck. Look for baskets that include a variety of high-quality items and are presented in an attractive and thoughtful manner. Don't be afraid to spend a bit more for a basket that truly stands out.

**Personalization Options:**

Many vendors offer options to personalize your Valentines day gift basket. This could include adding a custom message, selecting specific items to include, or even creating a completely bespoke basket from scratch. Personalization adds a unique touch and demonstrates that you went the extra mile to create a truly special gift.

**Dietary Considerations:**

In today's world, many people have dietary restrictions or preferences. Look for Valentines day gift baskets that cater to specific needs, such as gluten-free, vegan, or sugar-free options. This shows that you are considerate of the recipient's health and lifestyle choices. It's also a good idea to double-check the ingredients list to ensure that the basket doesn't contain any allergens.

1k4imjv,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1k4imjv/my_story/,My story,"I am undiagnosed but going through finding out what it is. 

I remember being 14-15 (now 21) and I always dealt (some days) with waking up in the morning and feeling dizzy and I would just puke my guts out. I felt so weak, my heart pounding. My heart has always beated so fast but I thought that was normal. I've never passed out, (I think)? Standing makes me sway back and forth and I have to hold onto something and I'd have to sit down. 

Fast forward to March, I went to an gastrologist and talked about possibly getting weight loss surgery, he went to check my heart rate, I stood up and stumbled onto the patient table and he checked and said, ""Your heart is beating a million times an minute, have you checked it?"". I blamed it on the coffee I drank, which was decafe so that couldn't be it. 

Later that month, I started having chest pain, it was hard to breathe, my heart was beating so fast it was about 160-190 bpm. I went to urgent care, which they say might be a pulmonary embolism. I rushed to the ER and I was hooked onto ECG, I was in normal sinus rhythm but my hr was around 150. And I did a CAT scan and blood work and everything was normal. They gave me ativan and my hr NEVER went down. By the time they discharged me, my hr was at 129. 

About two days later, I went to my PCP and my hr was 150 bpm, and she checked my hr sitting down and standing up. It was between 150 to 130 bpm. She gave me propranolol, 20 mg twice a day and my hr has been consistent. My resting hr around 69 bpm and the highest it goes to now is 120 bpm when I move around and stay on my feet. I see a cardiologist this Friday, I'm scared but I'm hoping it all goes well. 🥲

1k4ik92,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1k4ik92/could_the_mueller_french_press_coffee_maker/,Could the Mueller French Press Coffee Maker Deliver the Perfect Brew Review?,"The Mueller MU-SSHYDPRESS French Press Coffee Maker is a sleek and robust piece of equipment that immediately grabbed my attention when I started using it. At first glance, the stainless steel construction exudes durability, and after weeks of testing, it proved to be just that. The classic yet modern design fits seamlessly into my kitchen, and its double-insulated walls are truly a game-changer for keeping coffee piping hot. While I tested its capacity with both tea and coffee, I wasn’t just brewing beverages—I was experimenting to find out what this French press could truly handle.

**Ease of Use and Manual Operation**

Working with this coffee press is refreshingly straightforward. Its manual operation allows for a no-frills, hands-on experience, which I genuinely appreciated. The process is quite simple: add your preferred coffee grounds, pour in hot water, give it a stir, and let it sit for about four minutes before plunging. I often used it in the quiet early hours of the morning, and the brewing process felt more like meditative therapy than a chore. The accompanying manual even includes a chart to help fine-tune the coffee strength, which kept my morning brew dialed in perfectly for those mornings when I needed an extra kick.  

**Advantages**

- The double-wall stainless steel carafe retains heat exceptionally well, ensuring that my coffee remains hot even on my laziest mornings.  
- A sturdy filter system comprised of four precision-engineered filtration layers effectively eliminated all traces of grounds.  
- Robust and versatile, this product isn’t just a coffee maker—it handled tea bags, frothing milk, and even hot chocolate experiments flawlessly.  

[Find the best price for Mueller MU-SSHYDPRESS on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b07jgbk6xv/)

**Build Quality and Portability**

The durability of the stainless steel build sets this apart from the glass alternatives I’ve tried in the past. The Mueller press easily handles the wear and tear of daily use without showing any signs of rust or degradation. We even took it on a quick camping trip, and I was impressed by how convenient it was to pack and use outdoors. The cool-touch handle deserves special mention for ensuring a burn-free experience even when holding scorching hot coffee.  

**Flavor Profile and Filtration**

This French press delivers on its promise of robust, full-bodied flavor. Whether brewing a bold dark roast or a lighter tea, the flavors came through with exceptional clarity and richness. The 4-level filtration system is a standout feature. During my testing, not a single coffee ground found its way into my cup. I’d say, in terms of taste experience, it outperformed some of the glass French presses I’ve used, especially when brewing stronger coffees.  

**Shortcomings**

- While the double-walled insulation is excellent for heat retention, it does come with a trade-off on the overall weight. This makes it less appealing if you’re looking for an ultra-light travel-friendly option.  
- Cleaning the plunger filters requires a bit of patience. Though dishwasher-safe, I usually end up hand washing for better results, and disassembling it can be slightly tedious after every use.  

**Competing Brands**

In the market for quality French presses, Bodum Chambord and Frieling are frequently mentioned competitors. Bodum’s products often come with a more traditional glass design, which may appeal to those looking for visual brewing. However, they pale in comparison when it comes to durability and heat retention. On the other hand, Frieling offers similar stainless steel options but tends to be pricier without many additional features. I’d argue the Mueller coffee press charts a better balance between practicality and affordability while still offering premium quality.

**Bang for the Buck**

From a cost-efficiency perspective, it’s hard to beat this French press for what it delivers. Its solid build, heated insulation, and multi-layered filtration are features usually reserved for more expensive counterparts. While it might not be the cheapest on the market, the versatility and premium touches make it feel worth every penny. Does it pack enough into the price point to justify not looking back? Entirely.

It was rationality, twisted into asceticism.

airport food, overpriced coffee, a movie ticket for a single showing.  
Just to spend — without justifying it.

I also got myself my first PS in a while - a PS5 Pro, hooked up to a 65"" QD-OLED TV. I've been hesitant to play on a console ever since I had a PS2 and a PSP - sub-60 fps gaming with a small field of vision never clicked for me. Nicer larger TVs and monitors and consoles catching up to offer 60 fps+ gaming experiences enabled a whole lot of things for me to enjoy. That's why I also have a Switch 2 on the way - to be able to dive into its exclusives as well.

Previously, I never considered VR as the fluidity and fidelity of consoles was already not enough for me, let alone with additional overhead. And my previous PC was to weak for VR gaming too. Now, though, I feel like I have a pretty VR-enabling setup and the thought that I have no access to any VR content and haven't ever even tried any, for that matter, has been scratching at me lately.

I don't really have a budget. I just don't want to overspend for something that wouldn't get enough use and bring me the correspondive value.

I hate cables with a passion and I've made sure that everything that can be wireless is wireless. That's why Meta Quest 3 intrigues me. I have a pretty good WiFi 6 router that caps at around 800 mbps on my 1 gbps connection and my PC finally has a WiFi (even WiFi 7) card. However, I'm a little concerned about the LCD screens, provided I'm used to fairly substantial HDR contrast on both my MiniLED monitor and QD-OLED TV.

Some people say that the PSVR2's cable is fairly minimal, though when I look at it, it doesn't really feel that way. It has OLEDs that support HDR, as far as I know, but its lenses are inferior and more distorted? Also, I treat the PS5 as more of a ""family activity"", in the sense that I lay back on the couch with my girfriend some evenings, and just play something while we comment on it, as if we're watching a movie. Resident Evil 4, Hogwarts Legacy, Astrobot, Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart and so on have all been great for that. I'm afraid VR will zone one of us in more than the other when playing and won't really be a good fit.

On my PC I play either some very high fidelity AAA titles like Cyberpunk, that I feel would be a worse experience on the console, alone by myself, or multiplayer titles like Forza Horizon 5, Marvel Rivals, FINALS, Diablo 4, Black Ops 6, WoW, etc. online with friends. To be honest, I get bored out of single player games with no one around pretty fast. That's why I thought that VR can make it a bit more interesting in those scenarios.

I also have very little available space. Literally 1 square meter between the TV and the coffee table, where the PS5 is, and 1 square meter behind my chair where the PC is.

Sorry for the long post but I wanted to get out as much information about how I play games out there, as I truly don't even know what my criteria is.

1k4ie2f,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1k4ie2f/a_smile_in_the_dark/,A Smile in the Dark,"Michael Reyes noticed it while editing the Henderson wedding photos. Just a slight smudge in the background of the bride's portrait. A shadowy outline that—if you looked at it long enough—seemed to form a face with a wide grin. He rubbed his tired eyes and zoomed in closer. The image quality degraded into pixels, but that smile... it looked deliberate. Positioned right behind the bride's left shoulder, half-hidden by the cascading white veil.

""Fucking hell,"" Michael muttered, checking the time. Almost 2 AM. He'd been editing for seven hours straight, and his vision was playing tricks on him. He saved his progress and shut down his computer.

Sleep didn't come easily. The image of that smile lingered in his mind, like an afterimage burned into his retina. By morning, Michael had convinced himself it was nothing—just a quirk of the lighting, or maybe someone passing in the background he hadn't noticed during the shoot.

Three days later, he delivered the finished wedding album to the Hendersons. They were thrilled, cooing over his work, praising his eye for detail.

""You really captured the essence of our day,"" Mrs. Henderson said, flipping through the album. Then she paused on the bride's portrait, the one with the strange shadow. ""Who's this behind me?""

Michael felt a cold drop of sweat roll down his spine. ""Where?""

She pointed directly at the smudge he'd tried to ignore. ""Here. Looks like someone was photobombing me."" She laughed, but Michael couldn't find the humor.

""Just a shadow,"" he said quickly. ""Or maybe a guest walking by that I didn't notice.""

Mrs. Henderson shrugged and continued through the album. Michael left their house with a gnawing feeling in his gut.

That night, he pulled up the original, unedited file of the bride's portrait. The shadow was there, but clearer in the raw image. It was definitely face-shaped, with dark hollows for eyes and a distinct crescent—a smile—curving beneath. Michael went through all the photos from the Henderson wedding, finding the same shadow in three other shots. Each time, it was positioned slightly differently, but always with that unmistakable grin.

Michael drowned his unease in whiskey and tried to forget about it.

---

Two weeks later, he shot engagement photos for a young couple at the downtown botanical gardens. The session went smoothly. The couple was photogenic and natural in front of the camera. Michael felt good about the shots as he packed up his gear.

At home, when he uploaded the images to his computer, he noticed something in the first batch of photos. A dark shape lurking among the orchids behind the couple. His hand trembled on the mouse as he zoomed in.

It was the same face. The same smile. But this time, it wasn't a vague shadow. It had definition—the suggestion of eyes, a nose, and that wide, terrible grin. And it was closer to the subjects than it had been in the Henderson wedding photos.

""No fucking way,"" Michael whispered, pushing away from his desk. But morbid curiosity pulled him back. He clicked through the images, his breathing shallow.

The figure appeared in six photos, moving progressively closer to the couple in each one. In the last photo where it appeared, it was almost directly behind them, the top half of its face visible over the man's shoulder. The couple, oblivious, smiled brightly for the camera while behind them, those dark eyes stared directly into the lens.

Michael deleted the photos with the figure, selected the best of the remaining images, and finished the edits in record time. The engagement photos were beautiful, and the couple was delighted. Michael didn't mention the deleted images. What would he say? *Sorry, had to trash some great shots because they were photobombed by what might be a ghost or demon or some shit I can't explain?*

But he couldn't stop thinking about it. He began reviewing all his recent work, going back three months. The shadow appeared sporadically at first—once in a corporate headshot session, twice during a sweet sixteen party. But in the past month, its appearances had increased. And in each new photo, it was closer to the subject, its features clearer, that smile wider.

---

Michael's sleep suffered. He dreamed of dark rooms and reaching hands and a face with a smile that stretched too wide. He began to dread editing sessions, afraid of what he might find lurking in the backgrounds of his photos.

One morning, after a particularly restless night, Michael decided to talk to someone. He called his old friend Jake, who taught photography at the local art school.

They met at a coffee shop far from Michael's usual haunts. He'd brought his laptop and a small selection of printed photos.

""So what's this big emergency?"" Jake asked, sliding into the booth across from him. His eyes widened at Michael's appearance. ""Jesus, man, you look like shit.""

""Thanks,"" Michael said dryly. He hadn't been taking care of himself. Hadn't shaved in days. Hadn't been eating well. ""I need your professional opinion on something.""

He slid the manila folder of prints across the table. Jake opened it, his expression curious, then confused as he flipped through the photos.

""These are good shots, Mike. What am I looking for?""

Michael leaned forward. ""The figure. In the background. It's in all of them.""

Jake's brow furrowed as he examined the photos more carefully. After a moment, he looked up. ""What figure?""

Michael's stomach dropped. He grabbed the prints and pointed to the shadow behind the bride, the shape among the orchids, the dark form looming behind a corporate executive. ""This. Right here. You don't see it?""

Jake squinted, then shook his head slowly. ""I see some shadows, maybe some light artifacts. Nothing unusual.""

""It's fucking right there!"" Michael's voice rose, drawing glances from nearby tables. He lowered it to a harsh whisper. ""The face. The smile. It's in all of them, and it's getting closer.""

Jake's expression shifted from confusion to concern. ""Mike, there's nothing there. Maybe you need to take a break. When's the last time you had a vacation?""

""I'm not crazy,"" Michael insisted, but doubt crept in. Could he be imagining it? He opened his laptop and pulled up more examples—photos where the figure was clearer. ""Look at these.""

Jake dutifully examined the screen, then shook his head again. ""I don't see anything out of the ordinary, man. Just normal shadows and background elements."" He reached across the table and put his hand on Michael's arm. ""Are you okay? Really?""

Michael shut the laptop. ""I'm fine. Just tired. You're right, I probably need a break.""

Jake didn't look convinced, but he didn't press the issue. They finished their coffee with forced small talk, and when they parted ways, Jake made Michael promise to call if he needed anything.

Michael had no intention of calling. Jake thought he was losing his mind. Maybe he was.

But the figure in his photos was real. He was sure of it.

---

Despite his growing fear, Michael had bills to pay. He couldn't cancel his upcoming shoots without damaging his reputation. So he pushed forward, taking on a family portrait session for the Blackwoods, a local family with three teenagers.

The session took place at their sprawling home, with its manicured lawn and carefully positioned flower beds. Mrs. Blackwood wanted both indoor and outdoor shots. Michael went through the motions mechanically, setting up each pose, checking his light, pressing the shutter. All the while, his eyes darted to the shadows, the corners, the spaces behind his subjects, looking for that face, that smile.

He didn't see anything during the shoot, but his dread only grew as he packed up his equipment. The reveal always came later, when he reviewed the images.

At home, Michael poured himself three fingers of whiskey before connecting his camera to the computer. The alcohol burned going down, but it didn't calm his nerves. His hand shook as he clicked through the first few images.

Nothing unusual. Just the Blackwood family, smiling stiffly in various poses around their home.

Relief began to wash over him. Maybe it was over. Maybe whatever had been haunting his photos had moved on.

Then he reached the indoor portraits, shot in the Blackwood's living room. In the first image, the family sat arranged on a plush sectional sofa. And there, peeking out from the hallway behind them, was the figure. No longer a shadow or a suggestion. It had form now—a tall, slender silhouette with a distinctly human shape, but wrong somehow, like a child's drawing of a person with the proportions slightly off.

And its face—pale enough now to stand out against the darkness of the hallway—bore that same terrible smile, stretched unnaturally wide.

Michael's breath caught in his throat. He clicked to the next image. The figure had moved, now standing directly in the hallway entrance. In the next, it was halfway into the living room. In the next, it stood directly behind the sofa where the Blackwoods sat, unaware.

Its smile was massive now, taking up the lower half of its face. Its eyes were dark holes, fixed on the camera—on Michael. One long-fingered hand rested on the back of the sofa, inches from Mrs. Blackwood's shoulder.

""Fuck, fuck, fuck,"" Michael gasped, pushing back from his desk. The chair crashed to the floor behind him. He stumbled to the bathroom and vomited until his stomach was empty.

When he returned to his computer, the image was still there. The figure stood behind the smiling family, its own grotesque grin mocking them, mocking him. Michael deleted the photos, one by one, his hands trembling so badly he had to try several times to click the right buttons.

He couldn't deliver these photos to the Blackwoods. He couldn't deliver any photos. He had to cancel his upcoming shoots, all of them. He had to figure out what was happening.

---

That night, Michael didn't sleep. He sat in his living room with all the lights on, a kitchen knife on the coffee table beside him, searching the internet for answers. He tried various combinations of search terms:

*Ghost in photographs
Entity in background of pictures
Smiling figure haunting photos
Shadow people photography*

Most results were about orbs and light anomalies in ghost hunting, or double exposures, or simple technical explanations for strange appearances in photos. Nothing matched what he was experiencing.

At 4 AM, on page seven of search results, he found a forum thread titled ""The Follower in Photos."" His heart raced as he clicked the link.

The original post was from six years ago:

*Has anyone else captured something following them in their photos? Not right away, but gradually appearing in shot after shot, getting closer each time? It started as a shadow in the background about four months ago, but now I can make out a face with a wide smile. No one else can see it in the pictures. They think I'm editing it in or hallucinating. I'm scared to take any more photos.*

The thread had only a few replies, most dismissive or joking. But one response, from three years ago, caught Michael's attention:

*I know what you're talking about. It happened to me too. I was a wedding photographer. It started with shadows, then a figure, then a face with that SMILE. No one else could see it. I thought I was losing my mind. It kept getting closer in every shoot until it was right behind my subjects, almost touching them. Then it started appearing in my personal photos too. Even selfies. Right over my shoulder. Smiling. Always fucking smiling.*

*I stopped taking photos completely, got rid of all my equipment. I haven't taken a single picture in two years. Sometimes I see it out of the corner of my eye now, even without a camera. I think once it finds you through the lens, it can cross over somehow. Be careful.*

The user had never posted again. Michael tried to send them a private message, but got an error: *Account no longer exists.*

He leaned back, rubbing his face with shaking hands. So he wasn't alone. Others had experienced this... this thing. The Follower, they called it. It was cold comfort.

The sun was rising when Michael finally passed out on his couch, the knife still within reach.

---

A pounding on his door woke him. Michael jerked upright, disoriented, his mouth dry, his neck stiff from the awkward sleeping position. The clock on the wall read 2:17 PM.

The pounding came again, accompanied by a voice. ""Michael! I know you're in there! Open up!""

It was Diane Blackwood. Shit. He was supposed to have called her with an update on the family portraits.

Michael staggered to the door and opened it, wincing at the bright afternoon light.

Diane's irritation turned to shock when she saw him. ""My God, are you sick?""

Michael ran a hand over his stubbled face. ""Sorry, Diane. I've been... yeah, I think I caught something. Flu, maybe.""

She took a step back. ""You should have called. I've been texting you all morning.""

""I know, I'm sorry. My phone..."" He patted his pockets, realizing he had no idea where his phone was.

""What about our photos? The party is this weekend.""

The Blackwoods were hosting some big anniversary celebration. The portraits were meant to be displayed.

""I'm still working on them,"" Michael lied. ""They need... adjustments. The lighting in your living room was tricky.""

""But you'll have them ready by Friday? That's the absolute latest we can get them printed and framed.""

Michael nodded, though his stomach churned at the thought of going through those images again, of seeing that thing standing behind the family. ""Yeah. Friday.""

After Diane left, Michael found his phone wedged between the couch cushions. Twelve missed calls and twenty-three text messages, not just from Diane but from other clients and from Jake.

Jake's latest message read: *Seriously concerned about you, man. Call me.*

Michael ignored it. He couldn't explain to Jake or anyone else what was happening. Instead, he forced himself to sit at his computer again, to face the Blackwood portraits.

He'd deleted the worst ones, the ones where the figure was clearly visible. But now, looking at the ""safe"" shots, he could see it there too—more subtly, but present. A shadow in a doorway. A blurred movement behind a curtain. A reflection in a window. The Follower was in every single frame.

Michael poured more whiskey and got to work editing. He manipulated the images, darkening shadows, adjusting contrast, cropping when possible, doing everything he could to hide the presence in the background. The results were far from his best work, but they were presentable. The Blackwoods would never know what had been lurking behind them.

When he finished, Michael sat back, exhausted but relieved. He could deliver these photos, fulfill his obligation. Then he would cancel everything else. Get rid of his cameras. Stop taking pictures completely, like the person on the forum had suggested.

As he was preparing to export the edited photos, a notification popped up on his screen. His phone was syncing new images to his cloud storage. Confused, Michael clicked on the notification.

New photos appeared in the folder—photos he didn't remember taking. They were dark, grainy images of his own apartment, shot from odd angles. The living room from the hallway. The kitchen from the doorway. The bathroom through a crack in the door.

And the final image: Michael himself, asleep on the couch, photographed from above, as if someone had stood over him while he slept.

There was no sign of the Follower in these photos. Because the Follower had taken them.

Michael stumbled away from the computer, knocking over his chair. His breath came in short, panicked gasps. It was in his home. It had used his own phone to take pictures while he slept.

He had to get out.

---

Michael packed a bag with shaking hands, shoving clothes in haphazardly, not caring what he took. He grabbed his wallet, keys, the half-empty whiskey bottle. He left his cameras, his lenses, all his photography equipment. He wanted nothing to do with it now.

He didn't know where to go, only that he couldn't stay in his apartment. He ended up at a motel on the outskirts of town, the kind of place that took cash and didn't ask questions. The room smelled of old cigarettes and cheap cleaning products, but it was anonymous, and it was far from his equipment, his computer, the photos.

For three days, Michael hid in the motel room, leaving only to buy more liquor and vending machine snacks. He ignored his phone as it continuously buzzed with messages and calls. On the fourth day, the battery died, and he felt a wave of relief.

He tried to figure out his next move. He couldn't run forever. He had to confront this somehow, had to find a way to stop it.

The forum post said the Follower had found the photographer ""through the lens."" Maybe that was the key. The camera lens as a doorway, a portal between worlds. It was an old superstition, wasn't it? That cameras could steal your soul, capture a piece of you in the photograph? What if it worked the other way too? What if something could come through?

On his fifth night at the motel, Michael woke to a strange sound—a faint, rhythmic clicking. He lay frozen in the dark, straining to identify it.

*Click. Click. Click.*

It sounded like... a camera shutter.

Michael fumbled for the bedside lamp, his hand slapping against the table until he found the switch. Light flooded the room, momentarily blinding him.

When his vision cleared, he saw it. His phone, which he'd left dead on the dresser, was floating in midair, its screen glowing, camera pointed at him. As he watched, paralyzed with terror, it snapped another photo. *Click.*

Then it dropped to the floor with a clatter.

Michael threw himself out of bed, grabbed his car keys, and fled the room in his underwear and t-shirt. He didn't stop to collect his things. He drove aimlessly through the night, his hands white-knuckled on the steering wheel, his mind racing with panic.

The thing was getting stronger. It had charged his dead phone, used it to take his picture. How much longer before it could fully cross over? Before that smiling face wasn't just in photographs but standing in front of him?

By dawn, Michael found himself parked outside Jake's apartment building. He had nowhere else to go. Jake was the only person who might believe even a fraction of what was happening.

Jake answered the door in boxers and a t-shirt, his hair mussed from sleep. His eyes widened at the sight of Michael, half-dressed, wild-eyed, trembling on his doorstep.

""Mike? What the fuck, man?""

""I need help,"" Michael said, his voice cracking. ""Please.""

Jake let him in, gave him a pair of sweatpants, made coffee. He didn't ask questions until Michael had taken a few sips, the hot liquid burning life back into him.

""Talk to me,"" Jake said finally, sitting across from him at the small kitchen table. ""What's going on?""

Michael told him everything. The shadow in the Henderson wedding photos. The figure in the botanical garden. The forum thread. The photos taken while he slept. The floating phone in the motel room. He held nothing back, even though he knew how it sounded.

Jake listened without interrupting, his expression gradually shifting from concern to worry to something close to fear.

""You really believe this,"" he said when Michael finished. It wasn't a question.

""I know how it sounds,"" Michael said quietly. ""But it's real. I've seen it. And now it's following me, not just through my professional camera but through any lens. My phone. Maybe security cameras too, I don't know.""

Jake was silent for a long moment. Then he said, ""Let me see the photos again. The ones you showed me at the coffee shop.""

""I don't have them with me. They're on my computer, at my apartment."" Michael shuddered at the thought of going back there.

""We'll go together,"" Jake said, standing up. ""Get dressed. And Mike... have you considered talking to someone? Professionally, I mean?""

""A therapist won't help with this.""

""Maybe not, but..."" Jake hesitated. ""Look, I'm not saying I don't believe you. I'm just saying that stress and sleep deprivation can cause all kinds of perceptual issues. And you're clearly not well.""

Michael wanted to argue, but he was too tired. ""Fine. I'll consider it. After we deal with this.""

---

Michael's apartment was exactly as he'd left it—door unlocked in his haste to flee, clothes strewn about from his frantic packing, empty whiskey bottle on the coffee table next to the kitchen knife he'd forgotten to take.

""Jesus, Mike,"" Jake muttered, taking in the chaos.

Michael ignored him, going straight to his computer. It was still on, the screen having gone to sleep after days of inactivity. He wiggled the mouse, and the display came to life, showing the Blackwood family portraits he'd been editing before he discovered the photos taken while he slept.

""Here,"" he said, opening his photo library. ""These are from the Henderson wedding. Look at this one, behind the bride.""

Jake leaned in, studying the screen. ""I see some kind of shadow, yeah. Could be anything though. Light artifact, someone walking by...""

""Now look at these, from the botanical garden shoot."" Michael clicked through to the engagement photos, finding the ones he'd recovered from his trash folder. ""See it there, behind the orchids? And here, closer to the couple? And here, right behind them?""

Jake squinted at the screen. ""I mean, I can see why that might look like a face if you're looking for one. Pareidolia, you know? The brain's tendency to find patterns, especially faces, in random stimuli.""

""It's not pareidolia,"" Michael snapped. ""Look at the progression. It's getting closer in each shot. And now look at the Blackwood portraits.""

He clicked through to the family session, finding the worst images, the ones where the Follower stood directly behind the sofa, its grotesque smile unmistakable.

Jake was silent, his brow furrowed in concentration.

""You still don't see it?"" Michael asked, desperation creeping into his voice.

""I see... something,"" Jake admitted slowly. ""Not as clearly as you're describing, but there's definitely something there. An anomaly of some kind.""

It wasn't the validation Michael had hoped for, but it was something. ""And what about these?"" he said, navigating to the folder of photos taken while he slept. ""Explain these.""

Jake scrolled through the images, his frown deepening. ""These were on your phone? When did you take them?""

""I didn't. It did. While I was asleep.""

""That's..."" Jake shook his head. ""That's not possible, Mike.""

""I know what I saw. My phone was dead. It floated in the air and took my picture in the motel room.""

Jake put a hand on Michael's shoulder. ""Listen to yourself. I'm worried about you, man. I think you need—""

""Don't fucking tell me what I need!"" Michael shoved Jake's hand away. ""I need you to believe me! I need you to help me figure out how to stop this thing before it—""

He broke off as the computer screen flickered. The photos disappeared, replaced by static for a brief moment. Then the screen cleared, showing Michael's cloud photo storage. A new folder had appeared, labeled simply ""HELLO.""

""What the fuck?"" Jake whispered.

With a trembling hand, Michael clicked on the folder. It contained a single image—a selfie of Jake, taken just moments ago, standing in Michael's apartment looking at the computer.

And behind him, visible over his left shoulder, was the Follower. No longer shadowy or indistinct. It was fully formed now, a tall, emaciated figure with sickly pale skin and long, spindly limbs. Its face was dominated by that horrible smile, stretching literally from ear to ear, filled with too many teeth. Its eyes, sunken but alert, stared directly into the camera.

One of its hands rested on Jake's shoulder.

Jake saw it too. He stumbled back from the computer, his face draining of color. ""That's... that can't be real. That's not real."" But his voice lacked conviction.

""It's real,"" Michael said quietly. ""And now it's found you too.""

Jake backed toward the door. ""This is some kind of sick joke. You edited that photo. You're fucking with me.""

""Why would I do that? I've been trying to get you to see it!""

""I don't know, man. Maybe you're not well. Maybe you need more help than I can give. But I'm not getting pulled into this... this delusion."" Jake reached the door, his hand finding the knob. ""I'm sorry, Mike. Get some help, seriously.""

He left, slamming the door behind him. Michael didn't try to stop him. There was no point. Jake had seen the Follower, had known in his gut it was real, but his mind couldn't accept it. Most people's couldn't. It was too far outside the boundaries of ordinary reality.

Michael was alone with this. He'd always been alone with it.

He turned back to the computer, to the grotesque image still displayed on the screen. The Follower seemed to be grinning directly at him, as if to say, *Now he knows too. Now you've spread me, like a virus.*

With sudden clarity, Michael understood. That's exactly what it was—a virus, spreading through photographs, infecting those who saw it. He'd shown the photos to Jake, and now Jake was marked too.

He had to destroy it. Had to cut off its means of transmission.

Michael began systematically deleting his photos, emptying his cloud storage, his hard drive, every place the Follower might exist digitally. It wasn't enough though. There were still the photos he'd delivered to clients, the ones they might have printed, shared, posted online. He couldn't track down and destroy all of those.

There was only one way to truly end this.

---

Michael drove back to his apartment complex after dark, a can of gasoline in his trunk. The plan was simple: burn everything. His cameras, his computer, all physical prints of his photos. Burn it all and hope that severed the connection.

But as he pulled into the parking lot, he saw the flashing lights of police cars and an ambulance. A small crowd had gathered outside the building.

Michael parked across the street and approached cautiously. He spotted his neighbor, Mrs. Lutz, standing at the edge of the crowd, and made his way to her.

""What happened?"" he asked.

She turned, recognition dawning on her face. ""Oh, Michael. It's just awful. Your friend... the police said he jumped from the roof.""

Michael felt the world tilt beneath him. ""My friend?""

""The young man who was at your apartment earlier. They found his body in the courtyard.""

Jake. Jake had jumped. Or been pushed.

""When?"" Michael's voice was barely audible.

""Just about an hour ago. Someone heard the... impact... and called 911."" Mrs. Lutz clutched her cardigan around herself. ""Did he seem depressed to you? Was there any sign?""

Michael couldn't answer. He backed away from her, from the crowd, from the flashing lights. He stumbled to his car and sat behind the wheel, his mind reeling.

Jake had seen the Follower. And hours later, he was dead.

It wasn't suicide. Michael was certain of that. The thing in the photos had followed Jake, had driven him to the roof, had...

Michael's phone buzzed in his pocket. Despite his better judgment, he pulled it out. A text message from Jake's number, received just now:

*Look up.*

Michael's gaze lifted to his apartment window, five floors up. A figure stood there, silhouetted against the light. For a moment, he thought it was a police officer, searching his place.

Then it raised a hand and waved.

Even from this distance, Michael could see its smile.

His phone buzzed again. Another text from Jake's number:

*Coming for you next. Smile for the camera.*

Attached was a photo—Jake's broken body on the concrete, his limbs at unnatural angles, his face turned toward the camera, his dead eyes open, his mouth twisted into a horrifying grin.

Michael dropped the phone as if it had burned him. He started the car with shaking hands and sped away, no destination in mind, just the need to put distance between himself and that thing in his apartment.

But he knew, deep down, that he couldn't run from it. It had found him through his camera lens. It existed in the photographs he'd taken. And now it had broken through, had physically manifested enough to kill Jake, to take his phone, to send messages.

The burning was still the answer. Not just his equipment and photos, but everything. He had let this thing into the world. He had to take it out, even if that meant going with it.

---

Michael drove to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town, a remnant of the city's industrial past that he'd used as a backdrop for an urban fashion shoot the previous year. It was the perfect place—isolated, already partially burned out from a previous fire, unlikely to spread flames to other structures.

He stopped at a gas station for more gasoline and lighter fluid, ignoring the concerned look from the cashier as he paid. In the harsh fluorescent light of the store, he caught sight of his reflection in a security monitor. He barely recognized himself—haggard, unshaven, eyes wild with fear and exhaustion. Behind his reflection, just over his shoulder, a shadow seemed to move independently.

Back in his car, Michael checked his rearview mirror frequently, half-expecting to see the Follower in the backseat, grinning at him. The roads were mostly empty at this late hour, the darkness outside the car absolute except for his headlights.

At the warehouse, Michael parked inside the loading bay, the massive door long since broken open. He popped his trunk and retrieved the gasoline cans, then went to work.

First, he collected everything from his car that might contain a photograph—his laptop, his phone, a few prints he'd kept in the glove compartment. He placed them in the center of the warehouse floor, creating a small pile.

Next, he retrieved his professional equipment from the backseat—the two cameras he'd left in the car when he fled to the motel, several lenses, memory cards, a portable hard drive.

The pile grew. Michael circled it, dousing everything with gasoline and lighter fluid. The sharp chemical smell filled the air, making his eyes water.

He had one more thing to add. From his wallet, he pulled out a small, folded photograph—the only personal photo he carried with him. It showed Michael and his sister on her wedding day, five years ago. The last time they were together before she moved to Australia. He hesitated, then placed it on top of the pile.

""I'm sorry,"" he whispered, to his sister, to Jake, to all the clients whose memories would be lost.

As he reached for his lighter, a sound echoed through the warehouse—the distinctive *click* of a camera shutter. Michael spun around, searching for the source.

In the shadows at the far end of the warehouse, something moved. The Follower stepped into a shaft of moonlight streaming through a broken window. It was more solid now, more real, its body still wrongly proportioned but unmistakably physical. Its smile was wet and red, as if it had been drinking blood.

In its hands, it held one of Michael's cameras.

""No,"" Michael breathed. ""How did you get that? It was in my apartment.""

The Follower's smile widened impossibly. It raised the camera to its face and aimed the lens at Michael. *Click.*

Michael lunged for his own pile, grabbing his lighter. He had to burn it all now, while the thing was here, before it could fully cross over.

The Follower moved with unnatural speed, crossing the warehouse in the blink of an eye. It knocked the lighter from Michael's hand, sending it skittering across the concrete floor.

""Give it back!"" Michael shouted, diving after the lighter. His fingers closed around it just as the Follower's foot came down on his hand, crushing it against the floor.

Michael screamed in pain. The Follower leaned down, its face inches from his, its smile stretching, opening, revealing row upon row of needle-like teeth. The stench of rot washed over Michael, making him gag.

With his free hand, Michael grabbed a nearby piece of concrete debris and swung it at the Follower's head. The thing reeled back, more in surprise than pain, and Michael scrambled to his feet.

He ran for the pile of gasoline-soaked equipment, fumbling with the lighter. Behind him, he heard the Follower recovering, moving in pursuit.

As he reached the pile, Michael glanced back. The Follower was almost on him, one hand outstretched, that terrible smile stretched to breaking point.

Michael flicked the lighter. It caught on the first try, the small flame dancing in the darkness. He touched it to the edge of the pile.

The gasoline ignited with a *whoosh*, flames leaping up, engulfing the equipment, the memory cards, the photographs. The heat was immediate and intense, driving Michael back.

The Follower shrieked—a sound like metal scraping against metal, like a thousand screaming voices layered over each other. It lunged at Michael, but he dodged, circling around to the other side of the growing bonfire.

The flames rose higher, consuming Michael's work, his memories, his livelihood. The Follower paced on the other side, its movements becoming jerky, its form seeming to flicker and fade as the photographs burned.

""Go back to hell,"" Michael spat.

The Follower cocked its head, as if considering his words. Then, in a movement too fast to track, it darted around the fire and tackled Michael to the ground.

They struggled on the concrete floor, the flames casting wild shadows around them. The Follower was strong, its limbs wrapping around Michael like tentacles, its face hovering above his, that smile descending toward him.

Michael fought with desperate strength, years of fear and paranoia lending him power he didn't know he possessed. He managed to flip their positions, pinning the Follower beneath him.

The thing's body felt wrong—too light, too pliable, like it wasn't fully solid. Its skin was cold and slick under Michael's hands as he wrapped them around its throat.

The Follower thrashed beneath him, its limbs elongating, wrapping around Michael's body, trying to pry him off. Its smile never faltered, even as Michael squeezed its throat with all his might.

The fire beside them roared higher as it caught on the wooden support beams of the warehouse. Heat seared Michael's back, flames licking at his clothing. But he didn't release his grip.

The Follower's form began to blur and distort, like a photograph left too long in the sun. Its features melted and ran, its smile stretching, dripping, dissolving.

Michael realized the warehouse was fully ablaze now, flames climbing the walls, consuming the rotted ceiling. Smoke filled his lungs, making him cough, but still he held on.

The Follower gave one final, violent convulsion, then went limp beneath him. Its body seemed to collapse in on itself, folding and crumpling like paper, until nothing remained but a dark smudge on the concrete—like a shadow, like a stain, like a badly developed photograph.

Michael staggered to his feet, coughing in the thick smoke. The exit was obscured by flames now. He was trapped.

But the Follower was gone. He had destroyed it, burned away its anchor to this world. That was all that mattered.

As the flames closed in, Michael felt a strange sense of peace. He had stopped it. No more smiles in the dark. No more figures creeping closer in every frame. No more deaths like Jake's.

The smoke was overwhelming now, filling his lungs, making his eyes stream with tears. Michael fell to his knees, his strength fading.

His last thought before consciousness slipped away was of his sister's wedding photo, burning to ash in the bonfire. Her smile—a real smile, warm and loving—being consumed by flames.

He hoped she would understand.

---

The fire department arrived too late to save the warehouse, but they managed to keep the blaze from spreading to nearby structures. In the charred ruins, they found a body, burned beyond recognition except for dental records. Michael Reyes, a local photographer.

The cause of the fire was determined to be arson. Michael's car was found in the loading bay, melted down to its metal frame. Inside the warehouse, investigators found the remains of camera equipment, a laptop, and other electronics, all deliberately doused with gasoline and ignited.

The case file noted that a friend of the deceased, Jake Thornton, had died earlier the same day, an apparent suicide. There was speculation that the two deaths might be connected, but no concrete evidence was found.

The strange case eventually faded from local memory, filed away as another tragic story of mental health issues and self-destruction.

But in the weeks and months that followed, people who had hired Michael Reyes for photography sessions began to notice something odd in the pictures he'd taken. A shadow in the background. A blur that, if you looked at it long enough, seemed to form a face.

A smile in the dark.

And in each subsequent photo they took themselves—at birthday parties, at weddings, on vacations—the shadow appeared. Closer each time. Smiling wider. Reaching.

Hi, I’m a 26F at uni, having a crush on this very mysterious 29M. Everyone kind of have already noticed him because he is quite handsome but never talks to anyone. Our path weren’t supposed to meet but I had to pause my master degree for some months due to health problems. Now we have the same class and I decided to approach him by asking him a question about the class. Since then, we talk from time to time, even have some breaks together, but I do not know if he is just being nice or if there could be more.

He remembers everything I’m telling him and even made dots connect about this “pause” in my master. That’s when I decided to overshared and told him I was a on break due to mental health problems.

He never goes to uni event, and says he is too old for that. There was this one time when I thought he was mad at me for sitting that close to him (because he only has one friend and he usually sits alone) and he wasn’t in the mood to talk that much. But I could also see him type a lot of message on his phone so I thought that he was having a bad day. The next day, I sit not too for but not too close (2-3 sits away) and we did have a talk and even over-shared.  Sometimes I wish I had the guts to ask him to get coffee but then I’m just way too scared of rejection. I’m kind of pretty, but I do not know if I’m his type or even if he is single. But he never mentioned once a gf. He also said that with his part time job and uni, it was difficult to have the time to do other things such as going out to drink a beer, but that there was only two months left. I didn’t know if that was an indirect way to tell me things or not.

There was also this one time where I waited for him to come back from the bathroom and when he came back he asked me what I was doing this holiday (Easter) for a moment I thought I he was going to ask me out on a date but he didn’t. And we always have these small conversations, but I do not know what to think about them.

My therapist told me to not interpret every details and just focus on what “is” and not what “could be” “should be” “would be”. So im really trying to take a step back and create some distance because I don’t want to get obssessed but im never been in a situation where I couldn’t read the other person and it’s very frustrating.

Some girls who probably say her talked, are also now trying to shoot their shoot. One girl (who has 500k + on ig) even went to me and said hi to me (even though we only met once at the beginning of the semester and then she didn’t acknowledge me anymore). He doesn’t look that interested but are still nice to everyone. I’ve been with a very attractive man, who knew he was attractive and it did not go that well. I was insecured, jealous, mad all the time. So when these things happens with this new crush, I’m distancing myself. I know it’s not only about looks (because I know I’m pretty but never felt enough), but sometimes I’m just like okay, maybe I should just focus on my exams preparation…

I dont have his phone number and when we live the last classroom we are just saying “see you tomorrow” “or have a nice weekend”, but we do not know when we will see each other again. Again, I wish I could ask him but I’m very scared of rejection.

What should I do when the Easter break is over? Should I try to see what’s up? Still sit close to him? Change where I’m usually sitting? Shoot my shot so I can move on?

So l have maybe a somewhat unusual situation. I have dual citizenship and one of my passports is Egyptian. The problem is I don't speak any Arabic. Like I can only say simple greetings, ask for a coffee or where the bathroom is and basic numbers that's it.

I go to Egypt like once every couple years and I'm going in a couple weeks to see family. I always go with my Mom who is Egyptian and speaks Arabic ofc. So I enter the country with my foreign passport and my Egyptian ID card and I normally never say anything to the customs officer because my mother does all the talking.

This time I'll be traveling to Egypt solo and I'm honestly kind of nervous that they are going to be somehow suspicious of me if I show my Egyptian ID then proceed to explain to them that I don't speak any Arabic at the border. They normally also do that thing where they take my passport and make me wait like 10 minutes standing there to call someone because they are checking my name. 

So I wanted to ask if anyone is like me who speaks no Arabic but uses an Egyptian ID with a foreign passport to enter the country to avoid paying the entry visa and if you've had any problems doing this when you speak literally no Arabic. Thank you!

I just got friendzoned by the girl that I dated the first time after 5 dates. I feel so sad and lost.,"So I downloaded tinder about a month ago and I matched with this girl first week and was the first and only date I’ve managed to get out of the app. We went on 5 dates in the next 3 weeks, went for coffee, then a couple for drinks, then coffee at park and finally movie at my house. 

At the last movie date, I had my arm behind her and we were cuddling halfway through the movie, and she was leaning on me a bit and I got that she enjoyed it. Then she recommends we watch another one. I kept staring at her at times in hopes of her turning around to kiss but that never happened. Also, when I dropped her off, I told her I had a great time while looking at her but she didn’t give me time to go for a move and just left. Then when I asked her if she wanted to plan another date she told me that lately she’s been viewing me as a friend. And when I asked if it was because I didn’t make a move (I didn’t want to force it but maybe missed a signal or something) she told me it had nothing to do with that. Maybe it was because I was being very slow and almost didn’t flirt at all. 

I was confident that things were going well with her and I just kinda fell out of the clouds with that text. And tinder has been completely dead lately, I get no likes while I used to at least get a few matches a week. I feel so lost and I don’t know what to do. Should I even try to get out the friendzone? She agreed to a platonic coffee next week that I recommended, and I just want to ask her what I did wrong. 

I feel like I’m back on square 1 but now I have even less options than before because I get no likes now. I even downloaded a few more apps and got very few matches, and the only means of meeting girls I have right now is through the apps since nothing comes out of my social group. And no I don’t want to start a hobby just to meet women, that seems forced to me.

Next month I turn 21 and I feel so left behind an inexperienced. I actually got to like her a lot and she is so sweet and it’s obvious she put effort to the post friendzone texts to make it less painful to me and she told me I treated her great and stuff, which honestly made it more painful because I can’t just say she sucked lol.

1k4hwm8,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1k4hwm8/why_is_there_a_goat_on_the_bridge/,Why is there a Goat on the Bridge?,"“Another one?” Inspector Telvix muttered, adjusting the straps on his hazard-rated inspection vest. The straps were too tight—again. The auto-fit system clearly didn’t account for tail placement.

“Yes, sir,” his aide confirmed, antennae stiff with anticipation. “Human patrol ship, HMS Alderbank. Irregular log entries. Something about a Lieutenant Nibbles who isn’t in the official crew manifest.”

Telvix exhaled through all three nostrils. This would be their fourth human vessel inspection this month. The last one had ended with a long argument about what constituted a ‘kitchen’ and a plasma conduit inexplicably rerouted through a ping-pong table.

The humans always made things weird.

The compliance shuttle docked without incident. The Alderbank’s docking officer greeted them with a warm smile and a mug of something steaming and aggressively cinnamon-scented. She offered it without explanation. Telvix declined.

“We’re here for an Article 6.2 crew manifest audit,” he said, producing a datapad and trying not to look directly into her aggressively friendly face.

“Of course,” she said cheerfully. “Commander Bellows is expecting you. Right this way.”

Telvix stepped into the main corridor and immediately frowned. The lighting was warm. The walls had art. Not technical schematics, not alert posters, actual framed images. One appeared to be a stylized depiction of a badger in aviator goggles. The crew passed by with unhurried efficiency, most of them smiling, nodding, or exchanging jokes as they moved between stations.

“Why is morale this high?” Telvix whispered to his aide.

“No recent shore leave. Two cycles beyond standard deployment. This shouldn’t be possible,” the aide replied, already scrolling through disciplinary metrics. There were none. In fact, there were commendations. Dozens. Including one awarded to ""Lt. W.""

They reached the bridge without incident. The door hissed open.

And then Telvix stopped moving.

There, in the center of the bridge, standing confidently beside the command console, was a goat.

It was a standard Earth goat, mid-sized, well-fed, white with faint grey mottling along its haunches. Around its body was a dark blue fabric vest with high-visibility lining and, prominently attached to its left flank via magnetic clasp, a silver-plated lieutenant’s insignia. The goat was chewing on a printed report. It looked up as the inspectors entered, bleated loudly, and headbutted the corner of a navigation chair.

The human crew didn’t react. One officer gave the goat a scratch behind the ears in passing.

Telvix turned very, very slowly toward the commanding officer.

Commander Bellows, still in the same uniform she wore during the Subpoena incident—albeit with slightly more coffee stains—gave them a calm nod from her seat. “Inspector. Welcome aboard.”

Telvix’s voice was dangerously even. “There is a goat. On your bridge.”

“Yes,” Bellows said.

“It’s wearing a rank insignia.”

“Yes.”

“It appears to be… chewing official documentation.”

“Only the old printouts. She has a very refined palate.”

Telvix stared. “Explain.”

“Lieutenant Nibbles is our morale officer. Technically listed under non-critical auxiliary support staff. Her presence was approved under long-term deployment protocol amendments for non-human emotional stabilizers. Article 14.2, if you’d like to check.”

“I have checked. There is no biological crew member named Nibbles in the interspecies personnel database.”

“She’s not in the database,” Bellows agreed. “She’s a goat.”

The goat bleated again, wandered to a corner, and curled up beside a heat vent like she owned the place.

“I demand to speak to the responsible officer,” Telvix snapped.

Bellows gestured.

Telvix followed her gaze.

To the goat.

“That’s her,” Bellows said simply.

There was a long pause. Somewhere in the back of the bridge, a human crewman suppressed a laugh.

Telvix stepped forward, eyes narrowing, and reached for the insignia badge on the goat’s vest. “You are interfering with official command structure. This constitutes a breach of Section—”

He didn’t finish the sentence.

The goat, with perfect timing and zero hesitation, bit him.

It wasn’t a big bite. But it was strategic. Right in the hand. Enough for Telvix to drop the badge and yelp, stumbling backward into a nearby bulkhead.

Bellows didn’t flinch. “Lieutenant Nibbles does not appreciate aggressive action toward her person. She’s very firm about personal space.”

Telvix glared, cradling his hand. “This is a violation of every fleet protocol we have.”

“Not every one,” Bellows said helpfully. “Just the ones that didn’t anticipate goats.”

The aide, meanwhile, had quietly confirmed the paperwork trail. Every form was present. Signed. Filed. Approved. One was even initialed by a GC health officer with a note reading: “If this works, we need one on every ship.”

The bridge was quiet again.

The goat bleated once more and began chewing the corner of Telvix’s dropped datapad.

Bellows smiled slightly. “Will there be anything else, Inspector?”


Inspector Telvix sat in the Alderbank’s conference room with a cold compress on his hand, a datapad in his lap, and the distinct aura of someone trying very hard not to scream. Across the table, Commander Bellows scrolled through documents on a touchscreen, entirely unbothered. Seated beside her was Lieutenant Greaves—called in from a neighboring sector for ""legal reassurance""—who was sipping from a mug that read ‘Morale Is Mandatory’.

On the floor between them, Nibbles the goat lay curled like a cat, chewing placidly on a shredded corner of a fleet safety manual. Her insignia pin gleamed in the soft light.

“I have escalated this to Fleet Command,” Telvix muttered, staring straight ahead. “You will be required to formally justify this… this animal’s presence on a Class-2 combat-rated vessel.”

Bellows smiled politely. “We anticipated that. Everything’s already submitted.”

Telvix’s datapad pinged. So did his aide’s. And then again. And again.

The human submission was 864 pages long.

The table of contents alone was twenty-three pages.

The main file was titled:
“Supplemental Justification for Auxiliary Officer Nibbles, Morale Unit – HMS Alderbank.”

Telvix opened the first section. It was a signed behavioral profile from a certified animal psychologist, Earth-based, GC-licensed. It described Nibbles as “extremely emotionally attuned, responsive to social stress indicators, and highly capable of non-verbal de-escalation in group settings.”

The next section contained performance metrics. Charts. Trend lines. Color-coded breakdowns. Apparently, crew stress indicators had dropped by 32% since Nibbles came aboard five years ago. There were fewer disciplinary incidents, fewer late reports, and no recorded violent altercations. One graph compared cortisol readings before and after Nibbles’ deployment.

Another section included logs of “notable mission impacts.” Telvix skimmed the list.

During a fire drill, Nibbles headbutted the emergency alert button while attempting to eat a comm cable. Response time was 14 seconds faster than average due to her ""initiative.""

Nibbles had once wandered into Engineering during a tense argument between two shift leads. Her untimely sneeze caused a laughter break, and the issue was resolved without escalation.

A corrupted nav file once uploaded an invalid routing vector. Nibbles ate the data slate before it could be processed. The navigational error was, technically, averted.

Telvix groaned and pinched the bridge of his upper nasal slit.

Bellows kept scrolling. “We also included crew testimonials. The team submitted a petition to make her permanent. It received eighty-two signatures.”

“You have forty-eight crew.”

“Some of them signed twice. We considered it a show of enthusiasm.”

Telvix’s aide leaned over and whispered, “Sir, fleet performance analysis just came back. The Alderbank has a 12.4% higher operational efficiency rating than comparable vessels.”

“Of course it does,” Telvix muttered.


Fleet Command weighed in thirty-six minutes later via emergency comms. The voice of Admiral Threx came through the channel like distant thunder through molasses.

“Commander Bellows, confirm the following: Lieutenant Nibbles is non-sapient, does not issue orders, does not access weapons systems, and is contained within non-critical personnel zones.”

“Confirmed,” Bellows replied calmly. “She is also vaccinated, microchipped, and house-trained.”

Threx paused for a moment. “Per Article 14.2, ‘nonstandard morale augmentation under long-term deployment stress protocols’ is allowable at CO discretion. You are within regulation. This investigation is closed.”

Telvix rose from his seat so fast he knocked over a glass of water. “You’re joking.”

“No, Inspector,” Threx said flatly. “You’re being reassigned. Effective immediately.”

“To where?”

“Medical leave. Listed under psychological recovery from... what is it?” A pause. Papers rustled. “Cross-species command interface breach.”

Telvix didn’t respond. He just stared at Nibbles, who had now dozed off, curled around the foot of Greaves’ chair.

Greaves patted the goat gently. “Don’t worry, Inspector. She doesn’t hold grudges. Much.”

When the GC shuttle departed the Alderbank, Nibbles watched it from the bridge viewport, bleated once, then resumed napping atop a padded crate labeled Emergency Blankets – Do Not Chew.

Three days later, a courier drone delivered a small black box to the Alderbank. Inside was a gold-trimmed feed bucket and an updated insignia pin—custom engraved with the words:

“In Recognition of Unconventional Excellence in Crew Morale.”

The final GC report, circulated quietly among fleet brass and compliance offices, read:

“Humans are once again in technical compliance. Investigation closed.”",2,1745253478.0,OpenHFY,1,1.0,False

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I’m now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s thats 25+ please to early 30s  please. Maturity is a big thing for me in someone too. 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking  often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I’ve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it’s an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I’ve been to and we have the lovely île de re island nearby I have been there many times it’s also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it’s certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know. I also love soft rock some of the bands  love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I’ve seen most of my favourite bands live too I’ve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it’s my favourite but I only have it in moderation I’ve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

It’s very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after. 

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!",1,1745253426.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False
1k4hvs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Suburbanhell/comments/1k4hvs4/confused/,Confused,"So I love cities, ever since I was a kid who grew up in the suburbs, I have always loved the energy. I love the public transit, the walking, the density, the fact that there’s things to do by just taking a stroll and popping into an (overpriced) coffee shop, or to stroll around and check out a book store or admire some architecture/people watching. 

However something hit me after my recent visit to a city I very much enjoy, I spent the weekend in the downtown and would also visit my friend who lives there but in like a car centric suburban city slightly 30 min from the downtown core I was in. What I noticed is that there is a community that’s been built there (all from the same ethnic/religious group) but a community nonetheless, with events, third spaces, sport clubs, camp/picnic gatherings and many from this nationality live close to each other within this suburban city where they have local shops (they have to drive to on the stroads and highways) such as Bakeries, butcher shops, restaurants etc etc. 

Some thoughts came to me, like do we really just want communities and more dense areas which means more chances of communities forming? How great is the walking/architecture if you don’t have friends or families around you? How great are third spaces if you basically have to always pay to go to them like coffee shops and all that. 

Basically the community my friend is in has cultivated everything we praise about dense cities but just add cars and parking lots LOL.

Also I hope this doesn’t come off as cheering on segregation etc etc, because like I said yes this community is all from the same nationality/immigrant background.

1k4huco,https://www.reddit.com/r/humansarespaceorcs/comments/1k4huco/why_is_there_a_goat_on_the_bridge/,Why is there a Goat on the Bridge?,"“Another one?” Inspector Telvix muttered, adjusting the straps on his hazard-rated inspection vest. The straps were too tight—again. The auto-fit system clearly didn’t account for tail placement.

“Yes, sir,” his aide confirmed, antennae stiff with anticipation. “Human patrol ship, HMS Alderbank. Irregular log entries. Something about a Lieutenant Nibbles who isn’t in the official crew manifest.”

Telvix exhaled through all three nostrils. This would be their fourth human vessel inspection this month. The last one had ended with a long argument about what constituted a ‘kitchen’ and a plasma conduit inexplicably rerouted through a ping-pong table.

The humans always made things weird.

The compliance shuttle docked without incident. The Alderbank’s docking officer greeted them with a warm smile and a mug of something steaming and aggressively cinnamon-scented. She offered it without explanation. Telvix declined.

“We’re here for an Article 6.2 crew manifest audit,” he said, producing a datapad and trying not to look directly into her aggressively friendly face.

“Of course,” she said cheerfully. “Commander Bellows is expecting you. Right this way.”

Telvix stepped into the main corridor and immediately frowned. The lighting was warm. The walls had art. Not technical schematics, not alert posters, actual framed images. One appeared to be a stylized depiction of a badger in aviator goggles. The crew passed by with unhurried efficiency, most of them smiling, nodding, or exchanging jokes as they moved between stations.

“Why is morale this high?” Telvix whispered to his aide.

“No recent shore leave. Two cycles beyond standard deployment. This shouldn’t be possible,” the aide replied, already scrolling through disciplinary metrics. There were none. In fact, there were commendations. Dozens. Including one awarded to ""Lt. W.""

They reached the bridge without incident. The door hissed open.

And then Telvix stopped moving.

There, in the center of the bridge, standing confidently beside the command console, was a goat.

It was a standard Earth goat, mid-sized, well-fed, white with faint grey mottling along its haunches. Around its body was a dark blue fabric vest with high-visibility lining and, prominently attached to its left flank via magnetic clasp, a silver-plated lieutenant’s insignia. The goat was chewing on a printed report. It looked up as the inspectors entered, bleated loudly, and headbutted the corner of a navigation chair.

The human crew didn’t react. One officer gave the goat a scratch behind the ears in passing.

Telvix turned very, very slowly toward the commanding officer.

Commander Bellows, still in the same uniform she wore during the Subpoena incident—albeit with slightly more coffee stains—gave them a calm nod from her seat. “Inspector. Welcome aboard.”

Telvix’s voice was dangerously even. “There is a goat. On your bridge.”

“Yes,” Bellows said.

“It’s wearing a rank insignia.”

“Yes.”

“It appears to be… chewing official documentation.”

“Only the old printouts. She has a very refined palate.”

Telvix stared. “Explain.”

“Lieutenant Nibbles is our morale officer. Technically listed under non-critical auxiliary support staff. Her presence was approved under long-term deployment protocol amendments for non-human emotional stabilizers. Article 14.2, if you’d like to check.”

“I have checked. There is no biological crew member named Nibbles in the interspecies personnel database.”

“She’s not in the database,” Bellows agreed. “She’s a goat.”

The goat bleated again, wandered to a corner, and curled up beside a heat vent like she owned the place.

“I demand to speak to the responsible officer,” Telvix snapped.

Bellows gestured.

Telvix followed her gaze.

To the goat.

“That’s her,” Bellows said simply.

There was a long pause. Somewhere in the back of the bridge, a human crewman suppressed a laugh.

Telvix stepped forward, eyes narrowing, and reached for the insignia badge on the goat’s vest. “You are interfering with official command structure. This constitutes a breach of Section—”

He didn’t finish the sentence.

The goat, with perfect timing and zero hesitation, bit him.

It wasn’t a big bite. But it was strategic. Right in the hand. Enough for Telvix to drop the badge and yelp, stumbling backward into a nearby bulkhead.

Bellows didn’t flinch. “Lieutenant Nibbles does not appreciate aggressive action toward her person. She’s very firm about personal space.”

Telvix glared, cradling his hand. “This is a violation of every fleet protocol we have.”

“Not every one,” Bellows said helpfully. “Just the ones that didn’t anticipate goats.”

The aide, meanwhile, had quietly confirmed the paperwork trail. Every form was present. Signed. Filed. Approved. One was even initialed by a GC health officer with a note reading: “If this works, we need one on every ship.”

The bridge was quiet again.

The goat bleated once more and began chewing the corner of Telvix’s dropped datapad.

Bellows smiled slightly. “Will there be anything else, Inspector?”


Inspector Telvix sat in the Alderbank’s conference room with a cold compress on his hand, a datapad in his lap, and the distinct aura of someone trying very hard not to scream. Across the table, Commander Bellows scrolled through documents on a touchscreen, entirely unbothered. Seated beside her was Lieutenant Greaves—called in from a neighboring sector for ""legal reassurance""—who was sipping from a mug that read ‘Morale Is Mandatory’.

On the floor between them, Nibbles the goat lay curled like a cat, chewing placidly on a shredded corner of a fleet safety manual. Her insignia pin gleamed in the soft light.

“I have escalated this to Fleet Command,” Telvix muttered, staring straight ahead. “You will be required to formally justify this… this animal’s presence on a Class-2 combat-rated vessel.”

So l have maybe a somewhat unusual situation. I have dual citizenship and one of my passports is Egyptian. The problem is I don't speak any Arabic. Like I can only say simple greetings, ask for a coffee or where the bathroom is and basic numbers that's it.
I go to Egypt like once every couple years and I'm going in a couple weeks to see family. I always go with my Mom who is Egyptian and speaks Arabic ofc. So I enter the country with my foreign passport and my Egyptian ID card and I normally never say anything to the customs officer because my mother does all the talking.
This time I'll be traveling to Egypt solo and I'm honestly kind of nervous that they are going to be somehow suspicious of me if I show my Egyptian ID then proceed to explain to them that I don't speak any Arabic at the border. They normally also do that thing where they take my passport and make me wait like 10 minutes standing there to call someone because they are checking my name. So I wanted to ask if anyone is like me who speaks no Arabic but uses an Egyptian ID with a foreign passport to enter the country to avoid paying the entry visa and if you've had any problems doing this when you speak literally no Arabic. Thank you!

My main focus is on the food, ""grazing"" as much as I can throughout each day and hopefully filling in the ""in-between"" time with interesting things to do. I like food markets, hanging in coffee shops, observing people, learning about culture/history, etc. Definitely not a beach-dweller. Not big on big crowds and over-tourism, but can tolerate a bit for the sake of good food.

So, given this, how many days/nights would you recommend I spend each in Da Nang (will probably fly in to this airport), Hue and Hoi An? Or maybe you have recommendation of elsewhere to explore in central Vietnam? (I will likely go to Ho Chi Minh City from central VN to spend a couple of days before flying home.)

My sense (maybe wrong) is that Da Nang is the largest with lots of places to eat, but not much else besides the beach? Hoi An looks like an easy day-trip if I don't want to get hotels in all three cities, but despite it's touristic feel, maybe the food warrants additional time? Hue seems the most chill of the three places, so I was considering three nights unless that's too many.

Back in school, I had social anxiety so I missed the absolute golden chance of making lifelong friends(had one and still in contact with him to this day and i still thank my teacher for it cause he was the guy I had to forcefully complete the last year projects with so we bonded )

School as a medium is like the *perfect* place to make friends, you could legit bond with each other on homeworks or bitching about your teachers.

Anyways then college came and before I even get to know the people, COVID came and it ate up all the ""good"" bonding years, only thing left is last year where people left cities, some were indulged in internships, some were doing major projects.

Now.. corporate world is here and it has been around 1.5 years here for me but nobody wants to be friends anymore, yeah we get a quick coffee break if we get anytime but everyone is engaged into too much work or remains in a hurry to go home. Also many people remains comfortable enough since they already have fair share of friends from school/college and some are married/in relationship so not interested in making friends.

Personally speaking it sucks but I have got to accept the reality as it is, honestly my only advice to other people here is please if you're in school/college, please SPEAK UP, engage in different societies, network, interact with different people, find your tribe before it's too late.",7,1745253124.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

The cheapest I can get away with is going for a drink at a cafe and avoiding everything else. This is not a problem, as it is enough to keep friendships going, but I feel bad spending money on a coffee or some other drink, that could've been spent on breakfast for three days. On the other hand, I don't want to completely stop meeting with people, as that pretty much sounds like a recipe for depression. 

Just to add, my friends are not super rich, but are much better standing than I am - middle class, own a home, don't live paycheck to paycheck, have no debt, so they don't have any problem eating at a restaurant, or going out whenever they feel like it. 
Also, I don't want them to think I am avoiding them but I don'r feel comfortable sharing this information with them, as I feel like they will think I am bad with money, unable to save, should work more etc. Also, I am afraid they will offer to pay, or that I will seem like I am 'asking' them to pay by letting them know I am not going out because I am trying to save money.

That said, I only drank coffee usually about a cup a day (normal sized mug). Am I still going through it? I'm feeling better actually but the anxiety is still kinda there.

It all started because I made a joke about earphones that I landed him and that he never returned. It was just a stupid joke saying like ""...yeah you mean MY earphones"". He got upset and told me that he knew that those were my earphones. I told him it was just a joke I don't care about them, I already got new ones anyways and was perfectly fine if he decided to keep them without even asking me.

The next day, one of the first things he said after waking up was ""you Will take back your earphones I don't like people reminding me of the obvious"" and pretty much compared me to people with an ""inferiority complex""(what?). He talked about me disrespecting his ""dignity"". I was very surprised and told him it's was only a joke, he can keep the earphones, and i apologised that my joke hurt him, that wasnt my purpose. But he didn't want to hear itx said he didnt want to talk about it, and gave me the silent treatment. He gave me back the earphones. He processed to leave the bed and go listen to music and pretty much ignore me.
I was very shocked by his reaction, he never got that mean with his words and felt hurt that he would describe me the way he did, or think that I was ill intentioned. 
I was very upset, and to be honest felt hurt... 
(A few weeks before that,  he made a joke that I didn't understand(his tone/sarcasm) and felt attacked (Basically saying that im always late) but when I asked him if he was serious because didnt like what he said, he got mad and told me that I shouldn't get mad and I should've understood the joke because ""you know you're never late"". I apologized multiple times and said that I just didn't understood his tone, which he didn't accept.)

To keep my mind busy, I started cleaning the house. At some point he came to me saying ""why are you not doing what I asked"", I was like what? ""I asked you to make me eggs, you heard me but decided to ignore me"". I explained to him that I didn't hear him and if he needed something he should've came to me and asked and not shout from the living room. (I didn't hear him, he was previously signing or talking on the phone)
At some point I wanted to go out and get some fresh air and a coffee. He insisted to drop me. Which I said no multiple times (i wanted to be alone). He tried to give me a hug and kiss me, and told me ""I'm chill, everything is chill"". I told him it wasn't on my side and that we can discuss it later. He still dropped me and left.
The evening we went back to bed, and he did what he usually does, try to get me by being affectionate. We ended up having sex, but he said something during about how he doesn't like to be angry at me so that"" I don't refuse sex"". I felt confused, between the 'I love you'and 'you're the love of my life' I felt his intentions were not sincere. After that he asked me to explain why I was mad. I told him everything, the way he talked to me, how he compared me to having an inferiority complex (he meant superiority), the way he gave the silent treatment, etc.  He tried to explain himself again (basically saying what he said in the morning) , but this time he was smiling like he didn't seem to take it seriously. When I was done pouring my heart, he asked ""you're done ?"" (He stopped smiling). I said yes. He turn off the light, turned away and fell asleep.
I've never seen him act like that to me. I couldn't bare sleeping beside him, I went to the living room.

The next day he asked obvious questions like why did you go the the living room. He proceeded on saying that he had the best sleep.
I was sad, not even angry. Just seeing how he was acting with me, I just felt so disrespected.
The day went on, I didn't really want to talk to him, I felt almost numb. He asked me to go with him pick up something, I said yes. Then he went to see his daughter (he had with an ex) and came back. We went to get food, then we went to see a friend of his very quickly. He suggested we go get a drink, I said ok. He tried to act normal, he saw I wasnt super responsive. I would answer him but it just felt weird and wrong.
Again when we got back home, he tried to have sex, which I said no, told him I wasn't in the mood. He asked "" well can you do it just to please me?"". I asked him how can he even say something like that after he saw me being upset the whole day. 
With a smirk on his face, he asked me to explain. Which I did: told him that I realized that every time I'm upset about something he would smile (he laughed when I said that bc he was actually smiling) and always invalidated what I felt, make me feel like I was exaggerating and that we could just talk about it that everyting is ""chill"" with him. Told him that I was still hurt about the way he talked and described me, the way he cut the conversation short and gave me the silent treatment. I explained to him I felt like I was some stranger he was talking to, as if we didn't have feeling towards each other, or any empathy for each other. I explained to him that him feeling mad about the earphones was ok, like his feeling was valid, but even if I apologize he didn't want to hear it. It talked about the double standard of who has the right to be mad over a joke . I told him I don't get it when he says that he doesn't want to be mad at me because he is afraid that I would say no to sex. I reminded him I never said no to it just to frustrate him/use it as a weapon. And finally talked about how he just ignored me when I poured my heart out to him. He tried to give arguments like ""no I was just tired and wanted to sleep, I couldn't answer you at that moment I was too tired"" I reminded him that he didn't try to talk about it the next day. I turned my face away, I just wanted to cry. He was beside me, didn't turn away this time, but didn't say anything back, and of course fell asleep.

Sorry this is a long post, and English is not my native language.

I'm not trying to know who is wrong or right. I feel hurt and numb, but am I overreacting?

My name is Tom, and I’m from the Netherlands. I recently bought my very first home (an exciting milestone) and I’m currently in the middle of renovating it. If all goes according to plan, I hope to move in around June of this year.

One of the areas I’m most excited about is the kitchen. I love cooking and spending time preparing food for friends and family. That’s why I’ve already invested kitchen setup.

There’s just one thing missing to complete it: a great coffee machine.

Coffee is an important part of my daily routine, and I want to create a cozy coffee corner in the kitchen. Since I’m still relatively new to the world of coffee making, I’d love some guidance in choosing the right machine to match my needs.

Here’s what I’m looking for:
- Budget: Maximum of €2000 for the complete setup (machine and grinder if needed)
- Heat-up Time: Preferably under 10 minutes
Preferred Coffee Types: Espresso, Americano, Cappuccino, Flat White
- Daily Usage: For two people, with a total of about 5 to 10 cups per day
- Available Space: Dedicated coffee corner in the kitchen measuring 100 cm x 80 cm
Experience Level: Beginner but want to improve 
- Machine Type: half automatic espresso machine (piston machine)

I’m looking for something that’s beginner-friendly but still allows me to grow into the hobby and make café-quality coffee at home. If there are specific models or brands you would recommend within this setup, I’d really appreciate your suggestions.

TL:DR is at the bottom.

Backstory – May 2024. I am in Barcelona and come down with some sort of viral infection. Return to the states and get tested multiple times, thinking it was covid. Nope. Just some weird bug that turned into a horrible chest cold. By June, I’m fully recovered.

Later in June, I noticed for the first time ever that I had completely lost my sense of taste. It didn’t last long, so I didn’t give it much thought, other than it was weird.

About 30 days after losing the ability to taste things periodically, the bad smells started. At first, it was sporadic, just like losing taste. Took a while for me to figure it out. I thought that maybe I had a cavity, so I went to the dentist. Everything was good. Then I called my doctor, and was recommended to an ENT (ears, nose, throat) specialist.

At first, the bad smells seemed random, but they were awful – much like smelling burning hair. Very foul, strong and pungent. This was early August. By early September, things were getting progressively worse. I would take my dog on a walk, and pass by certain trees that smelled hideous. Perfume/cologne – awful. The smell of coffee, which I used to love, repulsive and sickening. Going to the grocery store was a shock. The smells from everything in a store was overwhelming to the point where I started to order food only online.

It took months to see the ENT. During that time, I was depressed, anxious and angry. Why did this happen to me? I didn’t want to tell my friends or family, as they would not understand what was going on. Life turned dark.

At my first ENT meeting, they gave me a “smell test” which basically was a big scratch-n-sniff book. Each page you had to identify the correct smell of what was listed. Many of the items I couldn’t smell, and most were so off that I couldn’t match the right smell to the page. Bottom line, I completely bombed the test, which was great for the doctor. It meant I was one of the rare ones.

The ENT brought up a clinical trial for PRP (platelet rich plasma). They had just done a successful trial for covid patients who’ve had parosmia, and now they were looking for non-covid participants like me. I was desperate for any change, so I jumped at the opportunity. The downside – being experimental meant my health insurance would not cover the cost. Oh, and the cost… $6,000 out of pocket.

While scheduling out the PRP treatment, she (my ENT) put me on a steroid nasal rinse of budesonide, high dosage of omega-3, and to do regular smell training (there are kits on Amazon that you can get… basic kit includes lemon, clove, eucalyptus and rose). I could smell the lemon and rose, but clove was just awful; I couldn’t smell the eucalyptus.

That whole daily treatment sucked (well, mainly the nasal rinse part). It meant every day started with a sinus pressure headache.

Also, by this time, food started to change. First I noticed that anything with processed sugar was off. Then, anything fried became so bad that I had to spit it out. This continued to expand to where most food was either so bad I couldn’t eat it, or many where I just couldn’t taste things. The only bright spot… spicy food was good. Thank god for Tapatio!

As well, I noticed one day while cleaning my kitchen that I couldn’t smell bleach. That was odd, because I like the smell of bleach. Then I tried smelling other things around the house… vanilla, cooking spices (oregano, cumin, pepper, etc.) – I couldn’t smell them at all, even things like body odor or bad breath… couldn’t smell it, and that made me super self-conscious.

During this time, I had to change my entire life around. Washing clothes meant finding unscented detergent. Washing hair meant searching for unscented shampoo. Toothpaste and deodorant were awful. Basically, I had to eliminate smells from my life.

So, between things I couldn’t smell, versus the things I could smell, which were horrific, I started thinking it would be better to not smell anything at all. The sinus rinse seemed ineffective and the smell training seemed like it was going nowhere.

What people don’t realize is how mentally draining this whole experience is. I asked my doctor for a referral for a psych who put me on an antidepressant. Not saying I would have un-alive things, but I definitely felt that life was not worth living… Losing smell and taste robs you of some life’s greatest pleasures. I couldn’t enjoy coffee. Anything with alcohol was sickening. French fries or potato chips – no more. And sweets like brownies or chocolate chip cookies were so incredibly bad that I knew it wasn’t even worth trying them. I lost about 20 pounds.

Fast forward to the PRP treatment.

It took a long time from my first ENT appointment to get the first treatment. The whole process consists of three treatments, two weeks apart (so, six weeks from start to finish).

Each treatment goes basically like this: first, they draw blood. Then, they numb each nostril. So far, so good. Neither was particularly bad or discomforting. After 20 to 30 minutes, they come back with your plasma (the blood goes through a centrifuge where the separate plasma from everything else).

Now the fun part (sarcasm). Doctor comes in and she’s going to inject the plasma up into your nasal cavity – **all the way up** to where your olfactory nerves are. Think eyebrow level and higher. And, it’s not just one shot… more like three shots per nostril. Although you’re numbed, the pressure is indescribable. My eyes were watering, and it felt like my head was going to explode. Very scary. The good thing is that the part of the process only takes maybe 10 minutes per nostril side.

Then its over, but for the headache that last about 24 hours. That part also sucked.

I did not notice any change after the first treatment, and I was told not to expect anything as well.

Two weeks later, the same ordeal. However, a few days after the second treatment, I did notice something different. Things that I couldn’t smell started to become smellable (if that’s a word). They didn’t smell right or good, but I just noticed that I could smell MORE things.

Also, I noticed what used to be sickening and what smelled like burning hair now just smelled sickly sweet, almost like rotting flesh. Yeah, I know that sounds bad, but the sickly sweet smell was slightly better and less nauseating than the burning hair smell.

Then the third and final treatment. It went rather smooth and unremarkable. I was told by this point that roughly 85% of patients who go through this see some degree of change. Not that 85% are cured… just that most had some level of improvement.

I was also told to wait until 30 days later to do my next smell test, which I will do today.

Here’s what I can say… things are still bad. Coffee is by far one of the worst offenders. The good news is that things aren’t AS BAD smelling. And for that matter, taste has improved. I can almost eat a French fry without spitting it out. But, chocolate, sweets and other things are still awful.

So, the world doesn’t smell as bad as it used to, and I’ve regained some ability to smell things (for example, I can somewhat smell bleach now). But, nothing is as it was.

I’m still taking an antidepressant, and I guess I will until things get better. Going into a grocery store is still bad, but not so repugnant to where I have to leave.

The big question is whether it’s worth the procedure and $6K price tag. I don’t know. Are things better? Slightly yes, which is encouraging. Maybe in another 30 days things will continue to improve. But, if they stay like they are, then I’d say no. It’s not worth the money. And, who knows. I’ve seen many state that they get better… it just takes years to recover.

This has been my experience. Your mileage my vary. I’ll post an update in another 30 days, and hopefully, I can provide more insights. It’s a horrible journey, and I know how many of you feel. Hang in there is all I can say.

**TL:DR** – Got parosmia from a non-covid virus, which ruined my ability to smell and taste. Tried an experimental PRP procedure. 30 days later, I can only report minor improvements, which by comparison is much better than how things were before, but I can’t say that the improvements justifies the $6K price for the PRP treatment. Come back in 30 days for an update.

 

Feel free to ask me anything not addressed here. I may be slow to respond, so please be patient. Thanks!",4,1745252443.0,Parosmia,1,1.0,False

So I recently did a full closet cleanse and realized… I’ve been seriously underestimating wide-leg pants. These babies are *back* in 2025 and serving all the effortless, breezy-chic vibes we need. Whether you’re going for laid-back brunch, office slay, or a quick coffee run, **wide-leg pants** are literally the most versatile wardrobe piece right now. ✨

Here’s how I’ve been styling them (and some inspo from a *really good* fashion blog I found – [wearlikewow.com](https://wearlikewow.com)):

* **Cropped tank + wide-leg linen pants + strappy sandals** = summer goddess energy ☀️
* **Graphic tee tucked in + denim wide-leg pants + sneakers** = off-duty model
* **Satin blouse + high-waisted wide-legs + pointed heels** = date night luxe 💋
* **Neutral cardigan + white wide-leg jeans + mules** = brunch with the girls
* **Basic black tee + pleated wide-legs + loafers** = work-ready *and* comfy

One big tip? Play with proportions! If your pants are flowy, go for something more fitted on top. And don’t forget to define your waist with a belt or a front tuck—it keeps the silhouette flattering, especially for petites like me.

Q: What towns in the U.S. are most similar to Dog River, SK?

A: Love this question! If you’re a fan of Dog River, Saskatchewan — the fictional setting of the iconic Canadian sitcom ""Corner Gas"" — you’re probably looking for towns in the U.S. with the same small-town charm, quirky characters, and “everyday is kinda weird” feel.

So let’s break it down:

What Makes Dog River, SK Special?

Dog River is:

* A tiny prairie town, population \~500–1,000
* Surrounded by flat farmland Has a tight-knit (and slightly odd) community
* Life revolves around the gas station, diner, coffee, local gossip, and lighthearted dysfunction
* It’s funny, dry, and unpretentious
* The town isn’t polished — but it’s beloved, homey, and strangely timeless

So with that vibe in mind...

🇺🇸 U.S. Towns Most Like Dog River, SK

Here are some real-life towns that match Dog River’s feel — or could be its American cousin:



🟡 1. Luverne, Minnesota

* A tiny, agriculture-driven town on the Minnesota prairie
* Has a cozy diner scene, a historic downtown, and a population around 4,000
* You can imagine someone like Brent or Lacey running a café next to the gas station
* Local pride + Midwestern weirdness = perfect



🟠 2. Medicine Lodge, Kansas

* Small town (\~2,000 people) in flat farm country
* Features a few old-school diners, a gas station or two, and a noticeable “everyone knows everyone” atmosphere
* Kind of a “blink and you’ll miss it” town, but quietly lovable



🔵 3. Philipsburg, Montana

* Smaller than Dog River (\~850 people), with a charming main street
* Quirky shops, some characters, and scenic views — but still that “everyone's in your business” kind of place
* Slightly more touristy than Dog River, but the locals make it feel authentic



🟢 4. Greenville, Illinois

* Small-town Illinois with lots of open farmland
* Has a gas station café culture, a couple of old-fashioned storefronts, and a vibe that’s chill but proudly quirky
* Could easily be the kind of place where a guy like Hank yells across the street to ask who borrowed his rake



🟣 5. Berlin, North Dakota

* Pop: \~30 (yes, 30), but it feels like Dog River — super remote, flat as a pancake, and full of small-town prairie charm
* Town dynamics are hilariously real and low-key dramatic
* There’s probably a Wanda-type in the post office ",0,1745252185.0,CornerGas,2,0.32,False
