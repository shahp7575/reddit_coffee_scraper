1m60i8l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m60i8l,The 2025 Tax Deduction Checklist That Could Save Your Small Business Thousands.,"# The Ultimate Small Business Tax-Deductible Expense Checklist

We’ll break these down into logical categories. Grab a coffee, open a spreadsheet, and let’s start saving you some money.

# 1. Day-to-Day Operations & Office Expenses

These are the costs of keeping the lights on and the engine running. They are often the most common and easily overlooked deductions.

* **Rent:** If you rent an office, storefront, or other commercial space, your monthly lease payments are fully deductible. (Note: The home office deduction is different—we’ll cover that later!)
* **Utilities:** Electricity, gas, water, internet, and business phone lines are all deductible. If you have a home office, you can deduct the business percentage of these bills.
* **Office Supplies:** Pens, paper, ink cartridges, planners, sticky notes, folders—all those small items add up. Keep those receipts from Staples or Amazon.
* **Software & Subscriptions:** Your subscription to QuickBooks, Adobe Creative Cloud, Microsoft 365, your project management tool (like Asana or Trello), your social media scheduler, and even your subscription to industry publications are all deductible.
* **Business Meals:** This one has specific rules. You can generally deduct 50% of the cost of business-related meals. This could be a lunch with a potential client, a meal with an employee to discuss a project, or food you eat while traveling for business. The key is that business must be discussed, and you must document who you were with and what was discussed.

# 2. People & Personnel Costs

If you have a team, these are some of your biggest and most important deductions.

* **Employee Salaries & Wages:** The gross salaries, wages, and commissions you pay to your employees are fully deductible.
* **Contract Labor (Freelancers & Independent Contractors):** The fees you pay to non-employees (like a freelance graphic designer, a consultant, or a contract bookkeeper) are deductible. Remember, if you pay a contractor more than $600 in a year, you must issue them a Form 1099-NEC.
* **Employee Benefits:** The costs of providing benefits are deductible. This includes your contributions to employees' health insurance, retirement plans (like a 401(k) or SIMPLE IRA), life insurance, and education assistance.
* **Payroll Taxes:** The employer's share of FICA taxes (Social Security and Medicare) and federal and state unemployment taxes (FUTA and SUTA) are deductible business expenses.

# 3. Marketing, Advertising & Growth

How do you get the word out? The costs associated with finding and keeping customers are almost always deductible.

* **Digital Advertising:** Costs for Google Ads, Facebook/Instagram ads, LinkedIn ads, etc.
* **Website Costs:** Fees for web design, development, domain registration, and hosting.
* **Traditional Advertising:** Print ads, billboards, radio spots, and direct mail.
* **Marketing Materials:** Business cards, brochures, flyers, and other promotional items.
* **Content & SEO:** Fees paid to a marketing agency or freelancer for search engine optimization or content creation.

>

# 4. Equipment, Assets & Depreciation

This is where things get a bit more complex, but the savings can be huge.

* **Small Equipment & Tools:** Items with a short lifespan can often be fully deducted in the year you buy them as ""supplies"" or ""other expenses.""
* **Large Equipment & Assets (Depreciation):** When you buy a significant asset that will last for more than a year—like a computer, a vehicle, machinery, or office furniture—you generally can't deduct the entire cost upfront. Instead, you deduct a portion of its cost over several years through a process called **depreciation**.

However, there are two powerful provisions that allow you to accelerate these deductions:

* **Section 179 Deduction:** This fantastic rule allows you to treat a large asset purchase as an immediate expense. For 2024 and 2025 (with limits adjusted for inflation), you can deduct the full purchase price of up to $1,220,000 in qualifying new or used equipment, with a total investment limit of $3,050,000. This is a game-changer for businesses buying big-ticket items.
* **Bonus Depreciation:** This allows you to deduct a large percentage of the cost of new *and used* assets in the first year. For 2024, it's 60%, and it's scheduled to phase down further in coming years, so it's wise to plan major purchases accordingly.

# 5. Travel & Vehicle Expenses



If you travel for work, your expenses can be a goldmine of deductions.

* **Airfare, Train Tickets, and Bus Fares:** The cost to get to your business destination.
* **Lodging and 50% of Meals:** Your hotel costs and half the cost of your food while away from home overnight for business.
* **Transportation:** Cabs, Ubers, Lyfts, or rental cars used for business at your destination.

**For your business vehicle, you have two options for deductions:**

1. **Standard Mileage Rate:** This is the simpler method. You track all your business miles and multiply the total by the IRS's standard rate (for 2024, it was 67 cents per mile; the 2025 rate will be announced late in 2024). You can also deduct parking fees and tolls.
2. **Actual Expense Method:** This is more work but can yield a larger deduction if you have a more expensive vehicle or high operating costs. You track and deduct the business-use percentage of *all* your car-related expenses: gas, oil changes, insurance, repairs, tires, registration fees, and even depreciation on the vehicle's cost.

>



# 6. Insurance & Professional Fees



Protecting and managing your business has tax benefits.

* **Business Insurance:** General liability, professional liability (errors and omissions), property insurance, and commercial auto insurance premiums are all deductible.
* **Health Insurance Premiums (for S-Corp Owners):** If you are an S-Corp owner with more than 2% ownership, the health insurance premiums the company pays for you can be deducted by the business and included as wages on your W-2. You can then potentially deduct them on your personal return. It's a specific rule, so talk to your CPA.
* **Legal & Professional Fees:** The money you pay to your lawyer, accountant, bookkeeper, or business coach is a deductible cost of doing business.



# 7. Education & Development



Investing in your own skills is an investment in your business.

* **Continuing Education:** Courses, workshops, and seminars that maintain or improve the skills required for your current business are deductible.
* **Industry Subscriptions & Books:** Subscriptions to trade journals, business books, and relevant magazines.
* **Conferences & Seminars:** The cost of admission and travel to industry conferences is deductible.

**Important Caveat:** Education expenses to qualify you for a *new* trade or business are generally not deductible. It must be related to your *existing* business.



# Deeper Dives: The High-Impact Deductions



Let's zoom in on two of the most powerful—and often misunderstood—deductions available.



# The Home Office Deduction



With the rise of remote work, this is more relevant than ever. To qualify, you must have a space in your home used **exclusively and regularly** as your principal place of business. ""Exclusively"" means that part of your home is used *only* for business (your desk in the corner of your bedroom doesn't count if you also use the room for sleeping).

You have two methods to calculate it:

1. **The Simplified Method:** This is the easy way. You deduct $5 per square foot of your home office, up to a maximum of 300 square feet (for a max deduction of $1,500).
2. **The Regular (Actual Expense) Method:** This is more complex but can lead to a much larger deduction. You calculate the percentage of your home that your office occupies (e.g., a 150 sq ft office in a 1,500 sq ft home is 10%). You then deduct that percentage of your actual home expenses, including mortgage interest, property taxes, homeowners insurance, utilities, and repairs.



# The Qualified Business Income (QBI) Deduction



Also known as the Section 199A deduction, this is a major tax break for ""pass-through"" entities—Sole Proprietorships, Partnerships, S-Corporations, and LLCs. It allows eligible business owners to deduct up to **20% of their qualified business income**.

This deduction is complex and has income limitations and rules about what kind of business you're in. For example, ""Specified Service Trades or Businesses"" (SSTBs) like doctors, lawyers, and consultants have lower income thresholds to qualify. This is a prime example of where a tax professional is essential to ensure you calculate it correctly and get the maximum benefit.

# Best Practices to Make Tax Time a Breeze

Knowing the deductions is one thing. Being able to prove them is another.

1. **Separate Your Finances:** Open a dedicated business bank account and get a business credit card. *Never* mix personal and business expenses. This is Rule #1 for a reason. It simplifies bookkeeping and protects you in an audit.
2. **Embrace Accounting Software:** Use a program like QuickBooks, Xero, or Wave from day one. Connect your business accounts, and categorize transactions as they happen. A year-end report will have 90% of your deductions ready to go.
3. **Keep Meticulous Records:** Digitize everything. Scan receipts and store them in a dedicated cloud folder. The IRS can audit you for years back, and paper receipts fade.
4. **Plan Year-Round:** Don't wait until April. Meet with your accountant or review your finances quarterly. This allows you to make strategic decisions—like buying that piece of equipment before year-end—to optimize your tax position.
5. **Hire a Pro:** We'll say it one last time. A good CPA or Enrolled Agent doesn't just do data entry; they provide strategic advice that can save you far more than their fee. They are an investment, not an expense.

# Final Thoughts: You've Got This

Taxes don't have to be a source of fear. By viewing your expenses through the lens of ""ordinary and necessary"" and by diligently tracking your spending throughout the year, you transform tax season from a chaotic chore into a strategic advantage.

You are building something incredible. Now, go make sure you keep as much of your hard-earned profit as you legally can. It's not just smart; it's essential for your long-term success.

1m60hi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1m60hi6/my_partner_of_5_years_was_secretly_calling_her/,"My partner of 5 years was secretly calling her boss which led to a break up,AIO?","Lot of context here I’ll try to keep it short as possible. My(30m) partner (35f I’ll refer to her as Jane) works and carpools with my parents, she got in a big argument with my mom over something that happened at work. I took Jane’s side because I know how my mom is, despite my efforts to get my mother to see why she in the wrong she wouldn’t apologize causing a drift so bad Jane decided she couldn’t see my mother anymore and even decided she couldn’t go to work with them anymore. (She relies completely on my parents for work as she never got her drivers license) 

The following day is when she called her boss(I’ll call him Jon, a known womanizer but has always been respectful to Jane as far as I know) to let him know she wasn’t going to be going to work anymore. Interestingly though, she told me she would be going to the room to do her nails, then she called him. When I went to give her the the usual afternoon coffee, she seemed kind of nervous when I suddenly opened the door which sparked my curiosity, I closed the door and decided to snoop a little. I heard them discussing his personal life talking about how his current gf cheated on him. That was raising a red flag for me but then Jane said something along the lines she would never cheat especially not on me as I have been good to her. I felt so happy to hear that and decided to stop snooping. The conversation ended up lasting 2hours and I was expecting her to talk to me about it as she usually tells me everything, but she didn’t mention it. The following day is when she told me she spoke to him but made it seem like they only discussed the incident with my mom, i didn’t make it an issue since what I overheard was her speaking highly of me, but it did raise a concern.

Fast forward a week my mom had called Jane to apologize and everything was good, but on a late night I decided to check Jane’s call log to see if she had kept in contact with Jon, what I found  was her basically calling him anytime I was at work or not home(one call being 3hours), and I immediately jumped to the conclusion they were having an affair. I went to straight to the bedroom, woke her up, and demanded her phone. I didn’t find any texts or trace of communication other then the phone calls. Jane’s  explanation was that she was only seeking his help in reasoning with my mother so she could get an apology and return back to work. I asked her “so why do it in secrecy if it was just that?” Her answer: “because I didn’t want you to hear me bad mouth your mom, and also because I felt like you weren’t doing anything to help me”  I was still in an emotional state and I basically called her unfaithful and a liar and we didn’t resolve anything and went to sleep in different rooms.

After having time to think, I decided to believe her since I didn’t find any proof of an actual affair when I asked for her phone, so when I was ready to talk I started off with an apology for all of my accusations, but still I told her I felt betrayed by the fact that she couldn’t trust me enough to let me know she would be communicating with Jon. Once again it turned into a fight with her saying she knows it looks wrong but she wasn’t doing anything wrong. I said “so then why the secrecy? That’s what made this look wrong, I bet he hasn’t even told his gf you have been calling him!” 
That’s when it went nuclear, and thats when I realized she was more worried about the drama at work and the problems it would cause her, then how what she did made me feel. She begged me not to tell anyone”its not fair to Jon he could lose his gf just because I needed his help, everyone always thinks wrong even though there was no romance”. I had to go to work and left things unresolved. 

When I got back from work, I was ready to resolve things. I told her I wasn’t going to tell anybody about this and I asked her if she had told anybody. She said she called her sister, I asked her to give me her phone so I could see for myself and she handed it to me, as I opened she said she also deleted all her calls with Jon since I had already seen them, so I gave her phone back and started to boot up my pc to check the call logs myself. As it was booting up she admitted to have also called Jon, she wanted to warn him in case I told people. To me that was the final straw, once again I felt betrayed and that’s when I said it’s over. 
She says I’m overreacting as she hasn’t cheated on me, but I feel like she chose to save her friendship with Jon over her relationship with me. AIO?

1m60ghe,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m60ghe/is_pittsburgh_worth_visiting/,Is Pittsburgh worth visiting?,"As someone who's explored dozens of US cities, I can confidently say Pittsburgh surprised me in the best possible way. This city transforms completely once you experience it firsthand, offering way more than what most people expect.

I recently spent a week discovering Pittsburgh's hidden gems, and I've got to tell you - those three rivers framing the downtown skyline create one of the most unique urban landscapes I've seen. The city's transformation from its industrial past to a modern cultural hub is remarkable.

The food scene here is incredible. Sure, everyone knows about Primanti Brothers' massive sandwiches, but Pittsburgh's culinary landscape goes way deeper. The Strip District is basically food heaven - imagine blocks of international markets, local delis, and some seriously good coffee shops.

What really got me was how much there is to do. You've got world-class museums like the Andy Warhol Museum (the largest single-artist museum in North America), beautiful architecture at the Cathedral of Learning, and those iconic yellow bridges (fun fact: Pittsburgh has more bridges than Venice).

The sports culture is intense - in the best way possible. Even if you're not a huge sports fan, seeing PNC Park with its riverside view is worth it. It's consistently rated one of the most beautiful ballparks in America.

One thing I wish I'd known earlier was how to efficiently see all these spots. After trying different options, I found this awesome double-decker bus tour (https://athometouch.com/pittsburgh) that really helped me get my bearings. It covers all the major attractions in about 2 hours, and you get these amazing views from the upper deck. The guides actually live here and share interesting stories you won't find in guidebooks.

For nature lovers, Pittsburgh's got that covered too. Point State Park is right downtown, and just a short drive away you'll find incredible hiking trails. The city's surprisingly green, with parks scattered throughout the neighborhoods.

The best part? Pittsburgh is still relatively affordable compared to other major cities. You can experience world-class attractions, amazing food, and unique architecture without breaking the bank.

My honest advice? Absolutely, Pittsburgh is worth visiting. It's one of those cities that keeps surprising you with something new around every corner. Just make sure to plan your trip well - start with that bus tour I mentioned to get oriented, then dive deeper into the neighborhoods and attractions that interest you most.

If you're planning a visit, I'd recommend at least 3-4 days to really experience what makes Pittsburgh special. And don't forget to ride one of those historic inclines for the best city views - the Duquesne or Monongahela Incline will give you photos worth bragging about.

Final thought: Pittsburgh isn't just worth visiting - it's a city that might just make you want to come back for more. The combination of history, culture, food, and friendly locals creates an experience that's uniquely Pittsburgh.",1,1753145882.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

I'm at a point in my life where I have no desire to do anything and no enthusiasm for life, often with somewhat negative thoughts.

The thing is, I've been suffering from ear, head, jaw, and neck pain for a year now.

I went to the doctor to have my ear checked, and they always told me it was inflamed. They prescribed me a thousand medications, and it never went away.

I tried going to the ear doctor, and they didn't see anything wrong with my ear, but they recommended I see a maxillofacial surgeon.

I made an appointment with a maxillofacial surgeon, but it took several months, so I waited until I went to the dentist. There, they told me my mouth was in terrible shape since I had three missing molars from many years ago. They promised me that with the treatment they were going to give me, I would notice an improvement in the pain, so, desperate, I paid it, which was $5,000.

After a few months, I went to the maxillofacial surgeon. They sent me for an MRI, and it turned out I had some TMJ, from protruding discs. But the doctor insisted that the problem couldn't be cured and that I couldn't have surgery, just physical therapy and a night guard.

Today, my mouth is freshly reshaped. They put my teeth back in, gave me the night guard, and I go to the physical therapist twice a month because my budget doesn't allow me to go more often.

I'm exactly the same as I was a year ago; I'd even say the pain has increased.

Every time I sleep, I find myself biting the splint to the point where my teeth are catching on the plastic. I wake up with headaches, neck pain, and jaw pain every day of my life. I'm going to the gym, I also do relaxation exercises, I've given up coffee, I drink herbal teas, I take a lot of painkillers like Valium, Enantyum, etc.

But absolutely nothing takes away the pain. I always go to the forum to read you and see what solutions I can find.

Now I've decided to get a Botox injection since I've read about some people who've had good results, but of course... there are others who say they haven't noticed anything at all...

The thing is, I can't afford anything because I'm not even working right now, but I could make an effort and ask my mother...

I'm just writing this to vent because I know there's no cure for this and no one is going to come and tell me, ""Hey, do this and it'll fix everything.""

Anyway, every day I have less desire to live; this is hell.

Today, my mouth is freshly reshaped. They put my teeth back in, gave me the night guard, and I go to the physical therapist twice a month because my budget doesn't allow me to go more often.

I'm exactly the same as I was a year ago; I'd even say the pain has increased.

Every time I sleep, I find myself biting the splint to the point where my teeth are catching on the plastic. I wake up with headaches, neck pain, and jaw pain every day of my life. I'm going to the gym, I also do relaxation exercises, I've given up coffee, I drink herbal teas, I take a lot of painkillers like Valium, Enantyum, etc.

But absolutely nothing takes away the pain. I always go to the forum to read you and see what solutions I can find.

Now I've decided to get a Botox injection since I've read about some people who've had good results, but of course... there are others who say they haven't noticed anything at all...

The thing is, I can't afford anything because I'm not even working right now, but I could make an effort and ask my mother...

I'm just writing this to vent because I know there's no cure for this and no one is going to come and tell me, ""Hey, do this and it'll fix everything.""

Anyway, every day I have less desire to live; this is hell.

1m60bq5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAVoyager/comments/1m60bq5/is_the_oahu_circle_island_tour_worth_it/,Is the Oahu Circle Island tour worth it?,"I just got back from an incredible 8-hour Circle Island tour of Oahu, and I need to share my experience. If you're wondering whether it's worth spending a full day exploring the island - absolutely yes.

I researched several tour options and settled on the Circle Island Tour with Waimea Waterfall (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island). At $154 per person, it turned out to be excellent value considering everything that's included.

Let me break down why this tour stands out:

First, our guide was outstanding. They shared fascinating stories about Hawaiian culture and history throughout the day - stuff you'd never learn just driving around on your own. The small group size (max 24 people) meant we could ask questions and didn't feel rushed.

The itinerary is perfectly planned. We started early from Waikiki, which helped beat the crowds at popular spots. Our first stop at Diamond Head gave us breathtaking coastal views - perfect for those sunrise photos. The Halona Blowhole was impressive, especially with the waves crashing and creating natural water shows.

The North Shore portion was a highlight. We stopped at famous beaches like Sunset Beach and had time to grab lunch at the legendary shrimp trucks (bring cash for this). The food was incredible - I'm still dreaming about that garlic shrimp.

Waimea Valley was the tour's crown jewel. The botanical gardens are stunning, and yes, you can actually swim at the waterfall! Bring your swimsuit - it's an experience you don't want to miss. The water was refreshing, and the setting felt like something out of a movie.

Some practical tips from my experience:
- Wear comfortable walking shoes
- Bring a swimsuit and towel
- Pack sunscreen and water
- Keep some cash handy for lunch and snacks
- Don't forget your camera

What really made this tour worth it was the convenience. No rental car hassles, no getting lost, no parking struggles. Plus, our guide knew exactly when to visit each location to avoid the worst crowds.

The Kona coffee and macadamia nut tastings at Tropical Farms were a nice bonus. And ending the day at Dole Plantation with their famous Dole Whip was perfect.

I've done several Hawaii tours, but this one offered the most comprehensive experience. Eight hours might sound long, but the time flew by. We covered so much ground while still having enough time to enjoy each stop.

If you're interested in booking this tour, I recommend reserving through this link: https://athometouch.com/Oahu-Island. They offer free cancellation up to 24 hours before, and you can reserve now and pay later.

The tour consistently gets high ratings (4.8/5 from over 3,000 reviews) for good reason. It's well-organized, informative, and hits all the major spots you'd want to see around Oahu. For first-time visitors especially, it's an excellent way to get oriented with the island and discover places you might want to revisit later.

Bottom line: If you want to see the best of Oahu in one day without the stress of planning and driving, this tour is definitely worth it.",1,1753145502.0,AskAVoyager,0,1.0,False

1m60bem,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m60bem,GlenAllachie Distillery Single Cask Tour/Flight,"A throwback to GlenAllachie distillery, which I visited this summer. Going to toss out my tasting notes and impressions of these drams before the flavours evaporate from my brain. 

Being a die hard sherry enthusiast, this was one of the brands I had to find out more about, as almost every bottle of grey-boxed single cask, or even the core range offerings, had been enjoyable to a large degree. 

It was a quaint but well furnished and clean distillery, complete with a compact visitor's centre and really cheerful staff who were also relaxed and passionate about carrying out Billy's mission of making good whisky without compromise. 

Chose the single cask tour, and without further ado, let's dive right into the specifics:

1. 2006 12 Years Bourbon Cask Cask No. 27981 61.1% - The starter dram, showcasing more of GlenAllachie's new make spirit. Despite it's age and cask, the colour ran a deeper shade of gold, perhaps signalling what was to come with GA's signature flavour profiles. 
Nosing showed off hints of honey, vanilla, apples, and notably, sunflowers. A very uplifting introduction to this bottling. 
Flavours detected were very similar to the aromas earlier, a vanillic base, with the same sunflowery notes (fresh hay, light earth, honey), and notably, a peek of GA's signature blueberry-ramune-Wrigley's gum new make. A very light and pleasant experience. 
Finish was slightly short and tannic, but that's to be expected at this Scotch age. 

2. 2006 13 Years Virgin Oak Barrel Cask No. 1395 60.7% - The second dram. Darker coloured, somewhat of a sunset and bronze hue. 
Aromas of butterscotch, caramel, orange, and nutmeg could be detected from initial nosing. Obviously the torched cask has made a marked difference here, compared to the first dram. 
Upon sampling, my earlier hypothesis was further confirmed. This dram was intense-- with similar notes sunflower, but the the flavours possessed an added layer of complexity, offering hints of Werner's Originals, figs, cinnamon, and that tangy citrus kick, all well complemented with GA's new make lurking in the background.
A similar finish, but this time hints of caramel was left in the mouth. 

3. 2013 11 Years Premier Cru Classé Cask No. 2480 61.9% - Clearly an experimental dram, using wine barrels imported from France. 
Nosing reveals something different. Stone fruits and light cocoa with milk and honey took the stage. This was slightly different from the first two, more decadent in terms of its' composition, or so it seemed. 
Tastewise, I would say this was the dram I liked least. While the vapours suggested a particular archetype of port wined whisky, the taste offered something different and less pleasant. It was as if the nosing aromas had been slathered on a rock, and then dunked into the new make, finished off with some slices of ginger thrown in for good measure. Perhaps the cask would have worked with a new make that was not as assertive as GA's, but in this case, both were at odds with one another. 

4. 2008 16 Years Oloroso Puncheon Cask No. 304 55.7% - Now we were on to what GA is known for. Sherry! This GA was unbelievably deep in colour, a almost opaque mahogany, akin to a tiger's eye gemstone. 
Nose was marvellous, offering piles of leather, old-world cigarette boxes, dark dried fruits, honeycomb, and Scottish tablet. 
The flavours were equally marvellous, showing off a harmony of caramelised dark fruits, honeycomb, coffee, and a touch of pecan pastry towards the end. 
Remains on the tongue long after the dram washed down. 

5. 2009 15 Years PX Hogshead Cask No. 440 54.5% - The final dram pictured here, but not the final one I tasted at the distillery. 
A similar opaque mahogany/tiger's eye gemstone colour was observed for this dram as well. 
Aromas of decadent melted chocolate, honeycomb, spiced wine, and an earthen mushroom stew towards the tail end of each whiff indicated that this was a well rounded dram. 
Upon tasting, it was apparent that this was indeed a great example of what GlenAllachie was capable of. Furthermore, the smaller capacity of this cask meant that the dram produced would The dram was highly indulgent, notes of honeysuckle jam/syrup, mixed in with milk chocolate--- opening up as I swished the dram about, to produce flavours of warm bananas, and further bits of spice (cinnamon, nutmeg).
Finish was long and thick, with the aftertaste of caramel lingering on the palate. Absolutely marvellous.

6. (Not Pictured) Single Malt 17 Years Mizunara & Oloroso Wood Finish 50% - The additional dram I asked to taste, which the staff happily provided free of charge. 
Nosing was similar to drams 5 and 6, but this time with the unmistakable fragrance of sandalwood and Japanese incense. 
The taste was where I was slightly disappointed. I had intended to choose between this and the PX I had earlier, but the decision was almost instantaneous upon trying this one out. Perhaps due to the split in aging time for both casks used here, the whisky did not soak up as much depth of flavour as I was expecting. It was as if someone had cranked down the fruit and chocolate notes, and replaced the treacly, jammy/syrupy fruit concoction with artificially flavoured sugared water. Again, while I think this combination of casks could have worked, I felt that they were against one another in this dram. This resulted in a rather thin and slightly less coherent dram than #4 and #5. 

And there you have it. I left GlenAllachie distillery a happy man, and with a bottling of dram #5. Thank you for reading!  ",5,1753145477.0,Scotch,1,1.0,False

For the most part, it’s working fine except to play either the Xbox or PlayStation we have to turn CEC off and use the TV speakers, otherwise it randomly turns the TV off (no clue why).

I’ve tried to have a talk with him every couple of months since we started seeing each other just to check in and make sure we are on the same page with things, the current progress of things and where things are going. 

Every time it was me who initiated it Because I believe communication is so important and if I never did, we probably would’ve never had these talks… anyways, every time I would talk with him he gave very vague responses and couldn’t really give a clear answer of what he wanted with me down the road. He would say things like, “I’m just enjoying the time I get to spend with you and learning more about you.” 

In the meantime, since we aren’t exclusive and I don’t know where this is gonna lead and we haven’t had sex in the last 2 months, I thought it would be wise not to limit myself so I’ve kept my Grindr profile and Tinder profile active, but haven’t actually gone any dates or slept with anyone else because I feel too emotionally vested with this guy.

Finally a couple of weeks ago I decided to have to talk with him again. I said I’m not looking for a label or to rush anything, but I feel like at this point you should at least have a clear idea of what you want and where this is going or like if you at least wanna be exclusive.

He still couldn’t give a direct answer and felt I was pressuring him, he said he has a lot going on in his life and just wants to take things slow. He apparently knew about my Grindr profile through his friend and gave me a hard time about it. He said, even though we’re technically not together and that’s my decision, it’s still trashy and how dear I even push for exclusivity or question his seriousness towards our dating situation when I’m “trolling for cock” on Grindr. He then accused me of sleeping around with a bunch of people and going to orgies, cruising in public and just being a pig. when I told him I haven’t done any of that stuff he got angry and told me I was a liar and that he cannot be with a liar because it’s beneath them (I really was being honest). When I got angry and yelled at him for his accusations, he told me that my true colors are coming out and he can’t be with someone who is disrespectful… I left his house that night, he blocked my number and deleted me off of everything. 

I’m so confused. I was trying to handle everything in a diplomatic way and just try and have an open dialogue of our situation and where it’s going but he’s making me feel like I was in the wrong. Based on the things I’ve said have I done anything wrong? 

Family, friends and coworkers seem to think this guy was using me and just keeping me around for the benefits. It breaks my heart to think that, but maybe it’s true. I would buy him things always paid for everything except for when he would get me a coffee or something. I also gave him access to the facilities at my condo so he can use them whenever he wanted even if I wasn’t there.

what is your opinion of this? And what would you have done if you were in this situation? would you have continued to write it out and see where things go or would you have ended things much sooner?

I do have a PS5 and a Xbox One as well but my jam is on PC. I hand built my computer and can often be seen playing racing games but I’m willing to play other games with you if you’re a gamer as well. I also have quite a vivid mix of music in my Spotify playlist but it’s mostly comprised of metal and EDM.

A little about how I look: I’m 5’8”, white, brown hair with brown eyes and of average body type. I do go to the gym to be healthier however that’s on hold for now as I currently am recovering from an ankle sprain.

Ideally, you are:

 • Of 22 to 40 years old. 

• Would be open to starting a family one day. 

• Open to joining me for occasional car activities, such as the monthly cars and coffee. 

• Clear and concise with communication. 

• Would also go with me to the gym but not a deal breaker if not.

• Willing to share music with me. I’m open to listening to other types of music that’s different from mine.

 • Of a slim or average body type.

Side note: I am not 420 friendly due to my job requirements but it’s alright if you are.

My partner and I are incredibly excited to be visiting the park from Wednesday, August 6th to Friday, August 8th. We'll be based in Port Angeles and traveling without a car (taking the ferry/bus from Seattle).

We've figured out our plan to use Clallam Transit to visit Hurricane Ridge and Lake Crescent, but we're dreaming of seeing the Sol Duc Falls and the Hoh Rainforest (or even Quinault). Unfortunately, reaching these spots without a vehicle is proving to be a real challenge. We've already checked with tour companies like Olympic Hikers, and they are fully booked during our stay.

This is where we could use your help!
Rideshare/Carpool Offer: Is anyone planning to drive to the Hoh Rainforest or Sol Duc Valley on Aug 7th and has room for two more? We would be thrilled to join you and are more than happy to contribute generously for gas and other related expenses(rental car costs), and treat you to coffee to say thanks! We're respectful, easygoing, and just want to experience the park's magic.

Alternative advice: If a rideshare isn't possible, do you have any other suggestions? We'd be grateful for leads on any smaller local tour operators, private guides, or other transport services we might have missed.

1m5zvug,https://www.reddit.com/r/Norse/comments/1m5zvug/a_short_story/,A short story,"The Ninth Night, by Ulfr Tyrsen

By the fire of the longhouse, in the ninth year of Óðinn’s moon, 2025...

In the twilight of spring, as the sun dipped low behind the fjord-cut skyline, the people of Valtýrstad prepared for the Ninth Night. Skalds chalked bindrunes on the walls of coffee houses. Motorbikes rumbled past statues of Thor and Freyja, their riders clad not in chrome studded leather, but in wolf pelts and woven cloaks. Even in the heart of the modern city, gods were everywhere: etched in steel, reflected in glass, whispered in alleyways.

On the edge of the city stood a longhouse that hummed with electric warmth and old magic. Cedar smoke curled from its chimney. Inside, a child named Sigrún sat with her grandfather, a goði with silver braids and storm grey eyes. Tonight, she would take her first climb. Tonight, she would seek her hamr.

“Do you know why we do this?” her grandfather asked, adjusting the runes on her cloak.

Sigrún nodded. “Because we are not just skin and name. We are shadow and echo. We are more than we seem.”

He smiled. “Good. Then you’re ready.”

Outside, the streets had quieted. On the Ninth Night, no one worked, no one traded. The government, such as it was, paused. Even the sky respected the silence. It was the one night when all honored the crossing: between who you are and who you are meant to be.

Sigrún joined the others at the foot of the mountain. Her classmates. Her rival. Her brother. Each wore a cloak marked by their clan’s rune. No two were the same. Drums began to beat from above; soft, steady, ancestral. A path of flame lit stones led upward.

They climbed.

At the summit stood the vé, the sacred space. No walls. Just open air, stone pillars, and the bones of memory. The goðar encircled the youth. A völva stood at the center, her staff carved from lightning-struck ash.

“Step forward,” she called.

One by one, the young did. Each spoke their heiti, the name they claimed. Not the one given by their parents, but the one earned by spirit. “Sigrún úlfrblóð.” Sigrún of the wolf-blood.

The völva nodded. “Tonight, your hamr will walk.”

The youth knelt. The drums shifted. The chanting began, not in English, not in Nynorsk, but in the Old Tongue. The rhythm seeped into Sigrún’s bones. Her breath slowed. Her skin prickled. And then...

She was no longer kneeling.

She was running.

Through forest, moonlit and silver. Her body low, her paws silent. She knew every scent. She heard the heartbeat of mice underground. She leapt between stones like wind given form. She was not human. She was not other. She was wolf.

And then, she howled.

Not in fear. Not in rage. But in joy.

Below, the city pulsed with ritual. Families gathered around altars of stone and steel. Drones passed overhead, filming for the great moot broadcast. Atop skyscrapers, rune-priests poured mead into rooftop bowls. Freyr’s gardens bloomed on balconies. Freyja’s cats curled on digital hearths. Thor’s hammers hung in truck windows and subway stations. No one forgot the gods, they lived among them.

In schools, children learned Old Norse beside math and science. They recited Hávamál with as much fluency as Shakespeare. Runes were as common as alphabets. Magic was not hidden, it was regulated, respected, recorded.

Hospitals employed völur to sing healing over the dying. Police bore carved staves to ward off vengeful spirits. Soldiers trained in combat and in prophecy. Politicians swore oaths on oath rings, and breaking one meant exile, not reelection.

This was not a utopia. There was still struggle. Still greed, still pain. But there was balance. There was memory. The old ways had not been lost. They had grown roots in concrete and glass.

When Sigrún awoke, she lay in her grandfather’s arms.

“Did you find it?” he whispered.

She nodded, tears streaking her ash stained cheeks. “I was not alone.”

He smiled, and lifted her up to face the stars.

“Then you are truly among us now. A daughter of wolves. A keeper of the Old Flame.”

And somewhere, beyond the fjord and the neon skyline, a chorus of howls answered; soft, strong, eternal.

Not in mourning.

I was diagnosed with ME/CFS by a specialist NHS clinic in England in summer 2021, but I’ve been struggling for years. Things got dramatically worse after I had COVID in December 2020 (before vaccines were available). Since then, my health has completely collapsed.

I’m in a constant state of exhaustion — not flare-ups, but a permanent crash. I never feel even close to well. I can barely function. Some days are very slightly better and I might manage something small like meeting someone for coffee, or even travel, but most days I’m stuck in my home, feeling physically broken. I have all the classic ME symptoms: brain fog, debilitating fatigue, weakness, tinnitus, light sensitivity, IBS, anxiety, unrefreshing sleep, messed up sleeping schedules, etc. I take meds to sleep, but nothing truly helps.

I’ve often wondered: is it burnout? ADHD? Complex trauma? Maybe — I’ve lived through stressful jobs and difficult relationships, and I absolutely relate to some of those symptoms too. Almost sure I have ADHD but the road to diagnosis through the NHS has been extremely challenging. But I also know this is not just psychological. This is physical. This is my body giving up on me. I was once a high-achiever with big dreams and a packed schedule. Now I can barely get out of bed. This doesn’t feel like life anymore.

For a long time, I kept pushing myself — I worked full-time for over 4 years while barely holding on, waking up each morning barely able to keep my eyes open, feeling sick with exhaustion. Felt very targeted at work for having a condition, and sort of threatened not to take sick days. But eventually I crashed for good. And so did my self-esteem. Now I’m unemployed. I have no idea how to survive financially. I have a small amount of savings — too much to get benefits, too little to live on. And the benefits system feels terrifying, stigmatising, and impossible to navigate when you’re already this ill. I feel like I can’t afford to have this condition. How can I carry on living and supporting myself financially with this? 

I don’t have any close friends or family who understand or support me. I feel like I’ve lost everything. My boyfriend actually broke up with me at one point because of M.E. We got back together, but I he doesn’t truly believe in ME/CFS. He thinks there must be some “other answer” — like it’s all in my head, or I just haven’t found the right doctor yet. I’m exhausted from trying to convince him, to mask, to pretend I’m okay.

I’ve thought about trying low dose naltrexone (LDN) but I honestly don’t even know where to start or if it’s worth it. I’m too tired to keep advocating for myself, but no one else will do it for me. I’ve tried endlessly with GPs, therapy, diets, supplements, resting. I’ve felt like there’s no “option” or space to be sick or disabled if you’re single or alone and you have to sustain yourself financially. 

I’m in my early/mid 30s and I genuinely don’t know how I’m supposed to live like this. I feel like I’m just watching my life disappear. I’ve lost my career, my independence, my identity. I feel like I’m going to end up sick, alone, and forgotten.

I’ve read so many research papers, medical things, I feel like I know more than some doctors. 

I don’t know what I’m asking for. Maybe just to be heard. Maybe advice. Maybe just to know I’m not the only one feeling this way.

1m5zrns,https://i.redd.it/hz3lbkhzkbef1.jpeg,For those that missed this article. Wish it landed more and helped boost stock and hopes of investors.,"NEXE Innovations Inc. (TSXV: NEXE, Frankfurt: NX5, OTC: NEXNF), a leading player in the compostable materials space, has made remarkable strides in 2024, positioning itself for substantial growth in 2025. Through strategic partnerships, manufacturing advancements, and a commitment to innovation, NEXE is setting new benchmarks in sustainable solutions. Here's a detailed look at their journey over the past year.
Expanding Market Reach and Strategic Partnerships
NEXE has strategically broadened its market presence through key collaborations:
U.S. Market Entry with EKOCUPS Partnering with EKOCUPS, a major Amazon retailer, NEXE entered the largest single-serve coffee pod market in the U.S. This move strengthens their foothold in a high-demand sector, bolstering revenue and brand recognition.
Bridgehead Coffee Collaboration Expanding its partnership with Bridgehead Coffee, NEXE secured a multi-year manufacturing agreement, delivering a range of new SKUs. This strategic alliance underscores NEXE’s growing influence in the Canadian coffee retail market.
ecoBeans Relaunch Success NEXE also played a pivotal role in the relaunch of ecoBeans Coffee, providing compostable pods to retail and Office Coffee Services (OCS) markets. This partnership highlights the company’s ability to adapt and thrive in various distribution channels.
Enhancing Manufacturing Capabilities
The consolidation of operations in Windsor, Ontario, following the sale of the Surrey facility for $5.7 million, marks a significant step in streamlining production. This vertically integrated approach enables rapid scaling, ensures quality, and reduces operational complexities.
NEXE’s investment in an in-house tool shop has been instrumental in minimizing machine downtime and fostering innovation. The ability to develop and test prototypes internally accelerates product development and enhances customization for diverse markets.
Innovating for Sustainability
In 2024, NEXE secured five new patents in Canada and the U.S., solidifying its leadership in compostable solutions. Innovations include enhanced filter designs for better coffee extraction and multi-ingredient beverage pods, catering to evolving consumer preferences.
The NEXE Pod, a flagship product, continues to meet stringent compostability standards. Its compatibility with popular brewing systems offers an eco-friendly alternative to conventional plastic pods, aligning with global sustainability goals.
Strengthening Financial Position
NEXE ends 2024 on a solid financial footing, with a cash position of $15.7 million and minimal debt. This strong balance sheet provides a secure foundation for continued investment in R&D, new product development, and revenue growth.
The company’s approval for trading on the OTCQB market has significantly enhanced its visibility among U.S. investors, opening up new avenues for capital and market expansion.
Leadership and Strategic Vision
The addition of Tom Hoyne as a strategic advisor brings over 35 years of expertise in the coffee and food manufacturing industries. His insights are expected to drive further innovation and strategic growth.
As NEXE scales its operations, the company is committed to adding top-tier talent to its team, ensuring it remains at the forefront of compostable material solutions.
Looking Ahead to 2025
With a strong pipeline of B2B opportunities, NEXE plans to expand its business-to-business coffee segment. By exiting its branded coffee business, the company aims to focus on building direct relationships with coffee companies and brands, ensuring a higher return on capital.
Conclusion
2024 has been a transformative year for NEXE Innovations, with significant achievements across strategic partnerships, manufacturing, and innovation. As the company moves into 2025, its robust foundation positions it to lead the market in sustainable solutions.",1,1753143926.0,NEXEInnovations,1,1.0,False
1m5zr9e,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1m5zr9e/sometimes_taking_things_away_makes_room_for_the/,Sometimes taking things away makes room for the life you should be living.,"The world doesn’t break you in one clean shot. It’s a slow grind, chipping away until you’re staring at the fragments of what you thought was solid. My name’s Alex, and I used to believe I had it wired: a sturdy house in the suburbs, two kids turning the backyard into a battlefield of laughs, and Sarah, my wife, the woman I figured I’d grow old with. I was the fixer—leaky faucets, scraped knees, the occasional marital dust-up. But some breaks don’t mend. You either survive them or you don’t.
It started small, like most disasters. A phone bill, just a sheet of numbers, but it hit like a frag grenade. I was paying bills one night, kids sacked out upstairs, Sarah in the kitchen humming like the world wasn’t tilting. Then I saw it: a string of calls to one number, late-night marathons when she was supposedly “working late” or “catching up with old friends.” My gut clenched, but I didn’t go in hot. That’s not my style. I traced the number. It led to Mike, some slick nobody from our high school days who’d popped up at a reunion. He’d offered to train her—spot her lifts, swap gym tips—since she was deep into weightlifting, sculpting her body like it was her exit strategy. That gym hookup turned into a years-long affair, all sweat and lies. Mike, the idiot, thought they’d end up hitched. His own wife? Clueless, keeping their home fires burning while he built castles in the sky.
I confronted her. She cried, big messy tears, swearing it was a one-off, just stress from the daily grind. “I love you, Alex. We can fix this.” I wanted to believe her. We ran the playbook: counseling, where some shrink nodded like he had the cure; date nights that felt like chewing gravel; a weekend getaway where every touch was a lie. I was fighting for the kids, for the life we’d built, but it was like bailing out a sinking boat with a shot glass.
Then came the night that changed the game. House dark, kids out cold, me heading for a glass of water. I froze outside the living room. Sarah’s voice, low and sharp, cut through the quiet. “He’s worth more dead than alive,” she said to Mike over the phone. “The prenup screws me in a divorce.” Mike grunted agreement, but her words hit like a .45 slug to the chest. Worth more dead? My brain ran the scenarios: poison in my coffee, a staged fall on the stairs. Was she joking? Planning? Didn’t matter. The trust was dead.
I didn’t blow up. Didn’t need to. I slipped back to bed, heart pounding like a war drum, mind running angles like a man on the run. By morning, I had a plan. No more fixing. This was about getting out alive. I played her game, nodding through her “let’s make it work” lies while I moved pieces on the board. First, the will—changed in days, cutting her out, funneling everything to the kids’ trusts. No reason for her to get creative with my obituary. Then the money: I pulled my share from our joint accounts, just enough for a clean break, quiet enough she didn’t notice. She was too busy sneaking around. The lawyer? A pitbull in a suit, the kind who smells blood and grins. “Prenup’s a fortress,” he said, flipping pages like he was loading a clip. “She gets nothing.”
Here’s where the irony kicks in. My only real asset was the family home, a holdout in a big city where developers were circling like vultures. It was inherited, passed down from my parents, and in my state, inheritance is exempt from marital assets. Sarah couldn’t touch it, no matter how the divorce played out. While I was planning my exit, a developer came knocking, desperate for the plot to finish some gleaming high-rise. I sold it for more than double what I’d expected—a number so big it felt like a punch I didn’t see coming. The payout was a middle finger to the years of betrayal, a karmic cash-out that balanced the scales after all the grief.
The divorce hit like a flashbang. Sarah played the victim, all shock and sobs, begging for another shot, but I had the receipts—texts, hotel bills, a timeline tighter than a garrote. The judge didn’t flinch; prenup held. We were done. Haven’t spoken since, and that’s how I want it. Some people are poison. You don’t negotiate with poison—you flush it.
The kids felt the blast. Old enough to catch the shrapnel, young enough to bleed from it. I got us a therapist, not to dissect Sarah’s corpse, but to keep us standing. “Why’d she do it? Could we have saved it? How do I get the kids through?” The answers came like a rap sheet: Sarah’s childhood was a war zone—violent drunk of a dad, dead by her teens; an addict mom who taught her to manipulate to survive. She’d honed sociopathic tricks, masked them with charm. Red flags I’d missed, like her trips to Hedonism resorts or that fling with a 40-year-old lawyer when she was 18. I’d called it wild spirit. It was just broken.
We talked it out, me and the kids, no sugarcoating. Anger, confusion, split loyalties. But we came through, a unit forged in the wreckage. Family’s not just blood—it’s who’s got your six when the world’s on fire.
Sarah’s a cautionary tale now. Blew through her savings in dive bars, chasing highs with a new guy every week, like she’s stuck in some bad rerun. Not a good look for a middle-aged mom. Mike, her partner in crime, who thought they’d ride off into the sunset? Life had other plans. Cancer hit him like a freight train, the kind that eats you alive, diagnosed last year. He’s fighting it, but the treatments are bleeding him dry, and his secrets spilled out in the hospital glare. His wife found out, served him divorce papers between chemo drips. The universe doesn’t play favorites.
Me? Cutting out the rot left room for something real. Years later, I met Emily by pure chance, in a coffee shop during a rainstorm. I was nursing a black coffee, she was arguing with the barista about bean roasts, her laugh slicing through the gray like a blade. Our eyes locked, and we got to talking—easy, like we’d been at it for years. She’s sharp, kind, with a wit that cuts through my armor. Two years later, we hopped a flight to Vegas on a wild whim. An Elvis named Ron, all sequins and swagger, married us in a chapel that reeked of cheap cologne and big dreams. Happiest damn day of my life, unexpected as a clean shot in a firefight.
Now? Life’s good. Emily and me, we hit the road—hikes, last-minute trips, wherever the wind blows. The kids, grown now, are carving their own paths, and I’m there when they need me. Evenings are quiet, the kind of peace you fight for, not find. Regret lingers—the kids didn’t deserve the fallout—but you don’t get the win without the war. Cheating’s not just a betrayal; it’s a knife in the back, meant to drop you. But clear the wreckage, and you make space for what’s worth it: people who’ve got your back, love that doesn’t break. I learned to move on, to forgive—not for them, but for me. That’s the play. You take your chips, walk away, and deal yourself a better hand.",0,1753143895.0,stories,0,0.5,False

I am looking for information on a coffee table that was in my late father-in-law's house.  I have done google image searches and eBay image searches, but have not been able to come up with an exact match.  It has the number 935 stamped into the wood.  It also has the numbers 3554   3 inked on the bottom.   
It appears to have a burl wood inlay around the outer edge.    
Thank you to anyone who can lead me to some answers.

Some days are much worse than others and I can’t quite figure out why. It even fluctuates from one hand to the other! Caffeine and fatigue make it worse, alcohol and CBD make it better but within that the intensity varies greatly from day to day. I’ve been trying to track this for years without success. 

I take very high dosage CBD which has allowed me to put toothpaste on the brush and use a q-tip! Life changing and at about a buck a dose it’s money well spent. (a full year’s supply on their Black Friday discount though they have sales through the year I guess. I’ll find the link if anyone wants it.) CBD plus Lamictal for seizures cause drowsiness which necessitates caffeine which increases ET, yada yada.

On a randomly good day I can do most things short of eating soup and carrying a cup of coffee with one hand. You know what bad days are like.

1m5zkyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1m5zkyu/complete_productivity_system_that_works_for_me/,Complete productivity system that works for me :),"This system is my lifeline. 

 If you have any questions, or want more depth on any of these aspects please let me know.

 I am also always looking to optimise further, if you have any suggestions please let me know also!

**What standard productivity system consists of:** 

* Moleskine weekly planner, where I track priorities, tasks, habits and to-do's. 
* Seperate blank journal that I use for mental health, journalling, etc.
*  Google cal for daily rough schedule & appts I book when out. Rarely use unless I'm out or don't have immediate access to my weekly planner. The purpose is to have a rough version of my day helps me on track.
* Strong app for weight training tacking & nike run club for runs. 
* Insight timer for meditation.

Main two things are journal + weekly planner. Both in paper, can chuck both in a backpack.

**Morning Routine**

* Wakeup around 5:30 - 6am and hydrate + feed pets
* Meditate \~20minutes each morning first thing
* Go for morning walk, grab a batch brew coffee from coffee shop and enjoy sunrise.
* Aim to be in deep work by 6:30. 90mins - 2hrs, dependent on day routine. This is where I'll get the most important task of day done. Schedule 1 thing to complete during this time.
* Will have breakfast and prepare for actual job at 8:30, quick breakfast or fast dependant on day.

**Evening Routine**

* Exercise around 4:30pm each afternoon. 3 days Weights, 2 runs, 1 yoga. Only 6 workouts during week and Sunday is normally free day but have active recovery, normally long walk during the day.
* Dinner with partner about 6pm. Carb + Protein heavy.
* Relax and unwind. Nothing to strict here, sometimes chess, sometimes movie with partner, sometimes just read.
* Shower & self-care about 8pm, do journalling about days activities, how each made me feel and any loose ends after shower.
* 8:30pm In bed, alarms set and phone/comp/screens off. Read for about 1hr, aim for about 50pages. 50 pages a day is about 50 books a year off varying lengths (some short, med & long).

**If I had to start from scratch again, here's how I'd build it** 

1. Delete all unnecessary apps of phone. Use social media only on computer, any games/apps you don't use get rid. Make it essentially a dumb phone - black and white screen, etc.
2. Setup google calendar with a rough/general daily schedule you can follow each day. Put in wake & sleep times, work, meal times, free time, etc. Think of a school timetable but make one for your life. Put this on your phone and whenever appts like dentist pop up just put them on google calendar.
3. Buy a weekly planner - in paper. Carry this with you wherever you can. I like mine a4 size and weekly however browse around and see what you like. Review this daily. Set your biggest goals, and turn them into weekly priorities and daily tasks. Schedule one most important thing you do everyday and make sure to get that done. Just free flow write what you have to do in bullet form each day.
4. Start Journalling. Just tracking your thoughts and mood is essential for mental health, and if you review at the end of the week your far more likely to see any traps or faults in thinking, productivity blocks, etc. Just free write whatever comes to mind, don't put any pressure on yourself, however do write. You have now started using a paper system.
5. Download the app strong - put your workout routine in it. This allows you to track how often you are hitting gym(aim for 3 times a week minimum). I do Fullbody, upper & lower. Makes it easy to track progressive overload so you don't stay stagnant.
6. Download a meditation app. I like insight timer so I can just set and end bell to mark 20minutes. For beginners headspace or waking up are both good, and has great guided meditation courses. Attempt to make this a daily habit also.

Extra : Carry a paper book wherever you go also, try read 20 pages a day. Don't get discouraged by setbacks, you can always try again tomorrow. Be easy on yourself, you have a long journey ahead. Remember it's a marathon not a race!

1m5zksa,https://www.reddit.com/r/SportsBettingExperts/comments/1m5zksa/brewers_mariners_breakdown/,Brewers Mariners Breakdown,"🧊 Brewers vs Mariners Betting Breakdown | 7/21 – The Fade Code

Probable Pitchers:
🟦 Brandon Woodruff (MIL) – 1-0, 2.61 ERA, 18 K
🟩 George Kirby (SEA) – 4-4, 4.50 ERA, 56 K

⸻

🔍 Pitching Matchup:

Woodruff – Better ERA, cleaner command, and fresher arm. Not a massive strikeout total yet, but he limits damage.
Kirby – Hittable lately. 25.2% K rate is decent, but .294 BABIP and 1.33 HR/9 show vulnerability. His LOB% (70.6%) suggests he struggles under pressure.

✅ Edge: Brewers

⸻

🧨 Bats to Watch:

Milwaukee Key Hitters:
	•	Yelich – .789 OPS, 14 HR
	•	Chourio – .752 OPS, 17 RBI
	•	Collins – .776 OPS, switch-hitter with pop

Seattle Key Hitters:
	•	Raleigh – .988 OPS, 38 HR, insane ISO
	•	Arozarena – 18 HR, .827 OPS
	•	Canzone – .317 AVG, .903 OPS, but aggressive and low walk rate

Seattle’s lineup is power-heavy up top but falls off fast.

⸻

📈 Fangraphs Advanced Data:
	•	Kirby: 1.33 HR/9, .294 BABIP, 70.6% LOB – not getting lucky, he’s just hittable
	•	Raleigh: 14.6% BB, .361 ISO – monster power, but 24.8% K rate
	•	Arozarena: 27% K rate – exploitable
	•	Canzone: 3.8% walk rate – pressing

⸻

🧊 The Fade Code Picks (Safe Focus):

✅ Brewers ML – Better pitcher + more consistent lineup
✅ NRFI (No Run First Inning) – Woodruff can hold, top of SEA lineup takes time to get going
❌ Avoid Kirby K props – his stuff isn’t fooling anyone lately
🔥 Longshot: Cal Raleigh HR – pure power upside, but not a core play

⸻

📉 Recent Momentum:
	•	Brewers: Just dropped 12, 8, and 6 runs in last three wins
	•	Mariners: Cooled off vs. MIA, lost 2 of last 3

⸻

I was super excited — I needed money for school and I really wanted to prove myself. I was hired along with another girl, Lorie (19F), and at first, we got along really well.

She was bubbly, always laughing, and the managers loved her because she could charm customers. But it didn’t take long for me to notice… Lorie didn’t really do much.

She would disappear to the back for long stretches, leave me alone at the register during rushes, and “forget” to restock things at closing time.

I didn’t want to be a snitch, so I picked up her slack. But it started to wear me down.

Last week, we had a huge morning rush, and she vanished again. I texted her — no reply. I handled everything alone for 40 minutes. When she came back, she smelled like weed. I was done.

I mentioned it casually to my manager, like, “Hey, just so you know, I’ve been covering a lot lately — even this morning Lorie was gone during the rush again.”

The next day, Lorie was furious. She cornered me in the back and said,
“Why are you trying to ruin my life? My job? I need this. I have anxiety, okay? Sometimes I need to take a breather. You wouldn’t understand.”

Then she did something I did not expect.
She went to our boss and told her I had yelled at her, cornered her, and accused her of doing drugs.

She cried during the meeting. Like, sobbed. I was shocked.

The manager brought me in later and asked for my side. I told the truth. I even showed the text I sent asking where she was. The manager said they’d look into it.

The next day? Lorie was fired. I didn’t gloat or anything — I felt bad. A bunch of people at work started whispering that I “ruined a girl’s job” and that she was “just dealing with stress.”

She blocked me on everything, and now people avoid me during shifts.

I didn’t want her fired — I just wanted her to stop making me do all the work and then lying about it.

But she cried, and everyone felt bad for her. Now I feel like the bad guy.

AITA?

I think it's surreal and dystopian to live within eyesight of people, for decades, and never speak or barely know each other. This would be insane to explain to someone from the 1700's or 1800's, I bet.

You may cringe at my level of try hard.

I take daily walks. When I see someone, I wave and introduce myself as new to the neighborhood. If they engage, I offer to exchange phone numbers to stay in touch (Share handyman referrals, etc). I tell them if they ever need help with anything, call me any time.

I try to stay in touch with these people. Not just one and done contact.

If I am home alone, I'll send a text to all neighbors inviting them over for a beer. Usually, someone takes me up on the offer and we have a nice chat.

When I do a home repair, or have a house/service question, I text every neighbor in my collected list. Every homeowner is a de facto project manager. Most will engage on the topic. When I get a new tool, I text all neighbors, and offer to lend it to them, if they ever need it.

If I see a neighbor working outside, I offer to help (stacking wood, shovel driveway, etc).

I had a party with real friends, but also invited neighbors. After a party, I offer unused alcohol to neighbors, via collected list of phone numbers.  I've also been invited to many neighbors homes for a drink or coffee. This 2-3 hour hangout really establishes the next level or rapport, as you exchange life stories.  I've also golfed with people who live in the neighborhood.   If I have leftover fertilizer, I'll offer it up.  I've helped neighbors snake their clogged drain.

Now, my Rolodex has grown, and I've also introduced niche neighbors to other neighbors. (same age kids, doing same HVAC project, same hobby, etc)

When I need to borrow an extra driveway parking spot for a large gathering, or a garden tool, I have many options.  A little effort goes a long way.  

If anyone stops engaging, or does not reply to 2-3 texts from me, then I back off and move on.  I'd estimate engagement rate is about 80%",102,1753143040.0,homeowners,35,0.93,False

1m5zcuj,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1m5zcuj/what_is_a_modular_sofa/,What is a modular sofa?,"I recently upgraded my living room with a modular sectional sofa, and I can't believe I waited this long to make the switch. After spending countless hours researching furniture options, I discovered that modular sofas are basically furniture building blocks for adults.

Unlike traditional couches, modular sofas come in separate pieces that you can arrange and rearrange however you want. Think of it like furniture Lego - you can create an L-shape one day, switch to a U-shape the next, or even split it into separate seating areas when hosting parties.

What really sold me was the flexibility. My living room isn't huge, but I wanted something that could accommodate family gatherings. With a modular sectional sofa (check out some great options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/sectional-sofa), I can adjust the configuration based on my needs. When it's just me and my partner watching TV, we keep it in an L-shape. When friends come over, we can extend it to create more seating.

The best part about these sofas is their adaptability. Moving to a new place? No problem. The pieces can be reconfigured to fit any space. Some models even come with features like storage compartments, reclining sections, and removable armrests.

I found that modular sofas also solve the common problem of furniture wear and tear. If one section gets damaged, you can replace just that piece instead of buying an entirely new sofa. Plus, many come with machine-washable covers - a game-changer for someone like me who's always spilling coffee.

Before buying, I'd recommend measuring your space carefully and considering how you'll use the sofa most often. Think about factors like fabric durability, comfort level, and whether you want additional features like USB ports or cup holders.

After extensive research and comparison shopping, I found some excellent options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/sectional-sofa. They have a wide range of styles, from contemporary to classic, and various price points to fit different budgets.

One thing I wish I'd known earlier is that modular sofas can actually save money in the long run. Instead of replacing entire furniture pieces when your needs change, you can simply add or remove sections as needed.

If you're considering upgrading your living room furniture, I'd definitely recommend looking into modular options. They offer incredible versatility, practical functionality, and modern design that traditional sofas just can't match.",1,1753142776.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of a pastry display case should be based on specific requirements.

**Temperature Control:** Accurate and consistent temperature regulation is critical to preserving product quality.

A proper system needs to maintain the freshness of pastries for extended periods.Look for models with precise digital temperature controls and reliable cooling systems. The ideal temperature range is typically between 36°F and 40°F (2°C and 4°C), ensuring optimal preservation without freezing the goods. Cases with adjustable temperature settings offer greater flexibility to accommodate different types of pastries, such as cream-filled items that require lower temperatures or delicate cakes that need slightly warmer conditions. The display case should quickly recover its temperature after a door opening, preventing temperature fluctuations that can compromise the pastries' texture and flavor.

**Humidity Control:** Controlling humidity levels prevents pastries from drying out or becoming soggy.

A good system should maintain an ideal humidity level. Some pastry display cases incorporate humidity control systems, often through the use of water reservoirs or specialized humidifiers. These systems help maintain the right moisture balance, preserving the freshness, appearance, and taste of pastries. The optimal humidity level typically ranges from 60% to 70%. Too little humidity can lead to dry, cracked pastries, while too much humidity can cause them to become sticky and unappetizing. Proper humidity control is especially crucial for delicate items like croissants, macarons, and cakes with fruit toppings.

**Display and Lighting:** Effective lighting and display configurations enhance product visibility and attractiveness.

Luminous, even lighting is essential for showcasing pastries in their best light. LED lighting is a preferred choice due to its energy efficiency, low heat output, and ability to provide consistent illumination. The lighting should highlight the pastries' colors and textures without creating harsh shadows or glare. Adjustable shelves and tiered displays allow for creative and visually appealing presentations. Clear, unobstructed glass panels ensure that customers have a clear view of the pastries from all angles. Consider models with rotating shelves or displays to further enhance visibility and attract attention.

**Materials and Durability:** The quality of the materials and overall construction impact the display case's longevity.Durable materials like stainless steel and tempered glass ensure long lasting performance. Stainless steel is commonly used for the exterior and interior of pastry display cases due to its resistance to corrosion, ease of cleaning, and sleek appearance.Tempered glass is used for the display panels because it is stronger and more resistant to breakage than regular glass. The frame should be sturdy and well-constructed to withstand daily use and prevent warping or damage. Check for reinforced hinges, robust door seals, and high-quality hardware. A well-built display case will not only last longer but also provide better insulation and temperature control.

Key Features:

* Excellent temperature control
* Precise humidity Levels
* Quality Interior and Exterior lighting
* Premium Grade materials used

## Core Benefits

**Enhanced Product Presentation:** Showcase pastries in an appealing and enticing manner,attracting more customers.

A well-designed pastry display case makes the pastries look more tempting.The pastries become an irresistible visual treat for customers. This increased visual appeal translates to higher sales and a more positive customer experience. Consider a cafe looking to increase its pastry sales, purchasing a display case with optimal lighting and design. The increased presentation quality then leads to a 20% increase in pastry sales.

**Extended Shelf Life:** Preserve pastries for longer periods, reducing waste and maximizing profitability.

Proper temperature and humidity control maintain freshness. These conditions considerably extend the shelf life of pastries, reducing spoilage and waste. This is especially beneficial for bakeries that produce large quantities of pastries daily. investing in a quality pastry display case can lead to substantial cost savings in the long run. For example, a bakery might experience a 30% reduction in pastry waste due to extended shelf life.**Increased Sales:** Attract customers with visually appealing pastries, driving impulse purchases and boosting revenue.

An attractive display case encourages customers to buy pastries. Customers are more likely to purchase pastries when they are displayed in an appealing way. The investment in a high-quality display case can quickly pay for itself through increased sales. A small bakery could see a 15% increase in overall sales after upgrading to a visually appealing pastry display case.

**Improved Hygiene and Sanitation:** protect pastries from contamination, maintaining food safety standards.

1m5z9h7,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_noisypickle/comments/1m5z9h7/lump_part_2/,Lump Part 2,"She sat across from me in the dimly lit restaurant, Niko’s. She chose this place, and it just so happened to be the restaurant that Mother always said she would want for a first date if she were ever to look for another fish in the sea. It seemed fitting now that I could sit in this restaurant on my first ever date. Brought here in some roundabout way by Mother.

Her voice didn’t do her justice when I spoke to her on the phone. She was beautiful. Her auburn hair fell in soft waves across her shoulders. She had just enough freckles speckled across her cheeks and the bridge of her nose to make it impossible to count. She wore a dress. I wouldn’t know how to describe it other than to say it was dark blue; she looked perfect in it, and Mother wouldn't have approved.

I had foolishly gotten my hopes up that this would be a real date, but she was far too gorgeous to be out with me. I knew the moment I saw her that she had probably suggested this meeting as a way to smooth things over with what had happened at the clinic. I’d be polite, like Mother had told me I should be on a first date. I’d pull her chair out for her, I’d give her the flowers I had brought, I’d pay for her meal, and if I had done everything correctly, I’d be allowed to walk her to her car and give her a hug. My hopes for the hug had walked out the door as this beautiful woman had walked in.

“I’m so sorry.”

“Again, it’s alright,” I said, as I slathered butter onto my slice of bread and shoved it into my mouth nervously.

“It’s just that he’s.” She paused while she searched her mind for the words. “He’s just such a fucking prick all the god damn time.”

I stopped chewing the massive bite and stared at her.

“Sorry, but it’s true. I fucking hate the man.”

I forced down the bite. “No, no, no. It’s ok.”

“It’s really not. I have to put up with him every day and he’s always such a sleazy piece of shit. There were all these rumors about him. Stuff about him getting caught in the dark with patient  X-rays.
“Doing what?” I asked.

“You know.” She pantomimed stroking something with a closed fist.

I furrowed my brow. “I don’t know.”

She let out a massive laugh that turned into a contorted snort. Her sudden outburst startled both me and the others sitting near us. She covered her mouth with her hands, and her cheeks immediately blushed. “That’s funny. You’re funny, but nice try.”

An arm reached over her shoulder and placed a glass down in front of her. “A glass of Willamette’s pinot noir for the lady and for the gentleman.” The waiter gently bit his tongue as he set the glass down in front of me. “A glass of Welch’s grape juice. The food will be out shortly.” He turned on his heels and walked off into the sea of dimly lit tables.

“Anyways,” she said. “I probably shouldn’t be telling you any of this anyway, and it doesn’t even matter. He’s gone now.”

“Gone?”
“Well, yeah. You don’t get to scream at a patient like he did and keep your job.”

“Oh, I feel awful. I didn’t want that.” I slouched back in my seat and took a sip of my juice.

“Don’t feel bad. It was going to happen sooner or later. You just happened to be the last straw for his career at the clinic.” She leaned forward and shot a wink across the table at me. “If anything, I should be saying thank you, but I think it’s best if we don’t even think about him tonight. After all, that’s not what we’re really here for.”

“No?”

“No.”

We looked at each other. Taking each other in. My heart began to beat faster.

“I’m sorry. What are we here for?”

She sat back in her chair and smiled. “I thought we’d get to know each other. Who are you? What makes you tick?”

My vision went hazy, and my ears felt hot as blood rushed through them. My heart was pounding as I began to share my life story. She was just so beautiful, I felt as if I was on the verge of blacking out while talking. My story isn’t particularly interesting, but by the time I finished, she was still listening. She seemed genuinely intrigued.

She looked across at me, stone-faced. “Wow. That was certainly a lot.”

“Yeah. It’s been a tough couple of months.”

She smiled. “I think you’re doing just fine.”

“I’m really sorry, but I have to be honest with you.”

“Yes, please do.”

“I don’t know what I’m doing.” I blurted. “I’ve never been on a.” I couldn’t bring myself to say it.

“A date?” She asked as a sly smirk crossed her lips.

“Yeah,” I said with a heavy sigh.

She reached her hand across the table and placed it on top of mine. “It’s ok, sweetie. I’ll help take care of you.”

The rest of the night was a blur. She introduced me to so many things that night, and it was an amazing evening of firsts for me. She ordered the food and more drinks. I had my first drink of wine. My head was a buzz as I learned about hummus and feta. I learned that there were all sorts of olives, and they were all more delicious than the last.  I learned that if you’re too loud, the bar will cut you off from drinks. I learned that a hug from a woman other than your mother gives the warmest feeling deep down in your soul. I learned about the softness of lips against your own. I learned about the smell of her shampoo and how the nape of her neck felt against my cheek. I learned how to unbutton a bra and about the peach fuzz on the small of her back. I learned about the weight of her bare breasts as they heaved against my chest. I learned that night what it meant to love.

Celeste moved in with me later that week. We were in love. She didn’t care that I still slept in my childhood room. She didn’t care that I had no prospects for a career. She didn’t care about the lump. She seemed to enjoy it. She would tell me often that I should just leave it. That it made me unique, and that she liked that I wasn’t anything like the other men she had been with. She’d often reach down and touch it as we made love, and that was fine by me. She had a voracious appetite for love-making. It had begun to affect our lives in negative ways. We had yet to unpack all of her belongings, so we lived among towering cardboard boxes of clothes, books, and knick-knacks she had brought with her. The house was starting to get dirty as well. Dishes were piling up in the sink, and grime was beginning to accumulate in the bathroom's crevices. The grass in the yard had started to grow unruly, and dirty clothes were piling up in every corner of every room. She took all of her vacation time to spend it at her new home with me, and it was clear what she intended to do, what she called “a staycation.” It had been 4 weeks now, and it was the most magical time of my life, but I was honestly exhausted, and the fact that I was such a light sleeper didn’t make the transition to sharing a bed any easier.

One night, I had to tell her that I just needed to sleep.

“I feel like a raisin.”

She reached down below the sheets, pulled my pajama shirt up with one hand, and thrust the other hand down below to take hold of me.

“I’m serious,” I said. “Not tonight. Please.”

“At least take off your pajamas.” She pleaded.

“No.”

She rolled her eyes. “Fine,” she mumbled as she turned away from me.

Although I couldn’t see her, I could feel how annoyed she was. Her warm body pressed up against mine, but the bed still felt cold. I don’t know how long she stewed in annoyance because the exhaustion took hold. I did not drift off to sleep as much as I plummeted into slumber.

“Wake up!” She whispered loudly into my ear.

My eyes shot open as her hot breath pierced into my ear canal.

“What? What is it?”

“Someone is trying to break in.”

I bolted upright, throwing back the covers. The late-night air was cold against my bare chest. I jumped up and ran to the window. There, below, I could see the form of a man sneaking around the house, peering into the windows. I grabbed the phone and called the police. The police arrived quickly. It couldn’t have been more than four or five minutes, but in that time, I saw the figure weakly attempt to pull open several windows and pick the lock in the door with no luck. The police arrived with flashing lights. They quickly jumped out of the car and began shouting at the figure. The lights silhouetted the figure more clearly, allowing me to see more details. It was now clear that whoever it was had a gun in one hand and a rope in the other. He was hunched over, old and frail.

“Holy shit,” Celeste said as she pressed her face up against the window. “That’s Dr. Richards down there.”

It was. Clear as day now in the sharp red and blue light spilling across my front yard. It was the same man who had screamed at me a month ago, bringing Celeste and me together.

“I have to get in!” He screamed at the police.

“Sir, that is not going to be happening tonight. You need to drop the gun!”

I couldn’t see all the details between the strobing lights and the awkward angle from which I was attempting to watch. Just a quick jerking movement from the doctor’s arm with the gun, and then a flurry of sparks and deafening bangs from the police. The doctor’s body was slumped against the doo,r and officers ran towards him shouting.

“Holy shit, holy shit, holy shit!” Celeste screamed.

“He’s going to be alright, right?”

“No, he’s not going to be alright! He’s fucking dead! They fucking shot him!”

“They’re going to want to talk to us, Celeste. Where’s my shirt? I need to find my shirt.”

The next day, Celeste went back to work. We did our best not to talk about what had happened that night, but it was hard not to think about it as we saw the blood-stained concrete in front of the door every day. As best as the police could make out, Dr. Richards was attempting to break in to enact revenge on me. It seemed that he was blaming me for losing his job at the clinic and had been planning on teaching me a lesson. We did our best to put it behind us.

Our love-making had come to a sudden crawl once Celeste had returned to work. I had just assumed it was due to the stress that comes with the hard work she did, but I didn’t really mind. I was glad to have the opportunity to rest and recharge, and Celeste still woke every morning with a smile on her beautiful face. Her work was a drain on her, though, and she’d return sullen. She began to seem distant to me. Her attitude had started to shift. I wasn’t sure if it was the incident with the doctor or the return to work. It could have been all of it. I had a new purpose in life now. I only wanted to make Celeste happy. While she was away, I cleaned and took care of the home. I prepared her meals and made sure she was as comfortable as possible. Nothing seemed to work, though. She’d often snap at me.

“God, you’re fucking pathetic. You know that, right?” She said one day, when I surprised her with flowers one day as she walked through the door.

She apologized later that evening as she mixed our nightly drink. A tradition she had started that I wasn’t particularly fond of, but it had become the only time now that she would sit and chat with me and be kind. The only time we had together anymore that reminded me of our first night together at that Greek restaurant. Every night was a different drink, and she’d refer to herself as a “mixologist”. We’d sit and sip our drinks and chat. I rarely, if ever, enjoyed the drinks, but I learned quickly that she took great offense if I didn’t finish them. We’d go to bed afterwards, where we no longer made love. The bed was only a place for sleeping now.

She had gotten into some sort of trouble at the clinic and was placed on a work program. This meant that she had to start working the late-night shift. We became like ships passing in the night. I’d wake in the morning with the sun and work around the house quietly while she slept. She’d wake as the sun went down and get ready for work. The tradition of our daily drinks did not end. She still insisted on fixing one for me each night before she left. I was just thankful that the few hours that we spent with each other included a brief time of comfort and conversation. I’d have my drink and crawl into bed, and she would leave for work. We carried on like this for months.

I woke one morning to a dull ache in my lump. I looked down to find that it had grown. The skin was blistered and red. I reached down to touch it, and the skin was hot and firm. I pulled myself from bed and fought off the pain with some ibuprofen. When Celeste woke up that evening, I asked her to take a look.

“I think you must have just slept on it wrong. Or didn’t you say you had switched the laundry detergent? It looks to me like an allergic reaction.”

“Allergic? To the detergent?” I asked.

“It’s super common. Don’t worry about it.” She said as she got dressed for her day.

But the pain didn’t subside. Every morning, the lump grew. Bit by bit, it grew until it was the size of a basketball protruding from my side. One morning, when I woke up, there was a small tear in my skin on the lump. Small splotches of blood had stained the sheets.

“You’re perfectly fine.” She’d assured me. “I even asked some of the doctors at the clinic about your situation, and they all agree that this is just a general flare-up. It’ll happen from time to time.”

“How can they know what it is? They haven’t even seen it.” I stammered.

“We have your files at the clinic. They’ve all seen that.”

“But it’s so much bigger now!”

“I know. They know that, too. I’ve shown them the pictures.”

My eyebrows shot up. “Pictures? What pictures?”

“The pictures I took.” She said with a tinge of annoyance.

“What are you talking about, Celeste?”

“I took a couple of photos of your lump when you were asleep. Don’t make a big deal about it.” She said with a scowl.
“Celeste, why would you take pictures of it when I’m asleep?”

“This! This right here! This is why!” She snapped. “You’re such a god damn baby about everything. You spent so long moping around the house after Dr. Richards bled out on our front porch.”
“That was a traumatic event!” I snapped back.

“You don’t do well with stress, Colin! Maybe it’s because you grew up as such a mama’s boy! I don’t fucking know!” She screamed at me. She took a deep breath and grabbed my shoulders. “You’re soft, Colin. It’s part of why I love you, but it means you don’t handle discomfort well. I know you feel shame around your lump. You shouldn’t feel shame about it, but you do. Am I right?”

I looked down at the floor. I was almost six inches taller than her, but in this moment, I felt so small. “Yeah.”

“You sleep like a rock. It takes an act of god to wake you up when you’re dead asleep. I just figured I’d save you from some embarrassment by taking some quick pictures while you slept. It’s not a big deal.”
“You could have asked,” I said sheepishly.

“Colin, you would have been so fucking embarrassed and you know it. I’m only telling you about all of this now because you forced my hand. You know I love you, right?” She slipped her hand up to my chin and lifted my face to meet her gaze.

I nodded as I felt a sinking feeling in my gut. I felt sick to my stomach. This was all too much to take in. I felt violated and betrayed by someone I loved. Was this love? Was this what it meant to be loved?
She fixed me a drink as usual. Tonight’s events were swimming through my mind as I was handed a drink. Something to do with a russian donkey. She talked to me as I sipped on my drink. I tried to listen. I nodded my head as if I was listening, but I couldn’t. My stomach churned over and over. I did my best not to let on how truly sick I felt. I knocked back the last of my drink in one swift motion.

“I have to use the restroom.” I blurted as I stood up and walked away.

“Ok. Go get 'em, Lump,” she said as I made my way down the hallway.

I stumbled into the bathroom and quickly shut and locked the door behind me. I promptly fell to my knees and grabbed onto the sides of the toilet. My back arched as I evacuated my insides in a violent blast. It stank of the drink I had just forced down. I immediately felt better. I stood to my feet and wiped the vomit from the corners of my mouth. I flushed the toilet and watched as the vile concoction spiralled down.

I walked back to the living room to find Celeste lounging on the couch, flipping through stations on the TV.

“You have such a small bladder.” She said with a chuckle. She turned her head back and caught a glimpse of me. She bolted upright. “Are you ok?”

“I’m fine.”

“You’re looking pale.”

“I’m just tired.” I lied. I couldn’t bring myself to tell her I couldn’t keep her drink down or that I was upset with her. Even though I didn’t trust her, she was so beautiful. I didn’t want to cause her any sort of pain, and I definitely didn’t want to say anything that would lead to another argument.

“Are you feeling nauseous or anything?” She asked with what seemed like genuine concern.

“No, no. I just had a big day today with cleaning, and I think I didn’t sleep great last night. No big deal. It’s bedtime anyway, so I’m just gonna go to bed.”

“Get some good rest,” she said after me as I made my way to the bedroom.

My head hit the pillow, and I drifted off to sleep. I had the most vivid nightmares of my life that night. I dreamt that there was a beautiful woman with a beautiful voice in love with an attractive man with an ugly voice. They had a long and loving conversation for what seemed like hours. All in soft whispers.

“They can’t keep us apart, my love.”

“Come to me.” The voice gurgled.

“He’s too stupid to know of our love.”

“Tell me you love me.”

“I love you, I love you, I love you.”

“Kill him,” it hissed.

“You know we can’t do that.”

“Take me away”

“You know that’s not an option either, my love.”

“Take me away!” It growled

The voice was horrible. I knew this dream was a nightmare, and I attempted to will myself awake to stop the horrendous voice from speaking. I blinked my eyes open ever so slightly. There in the pale light, I could see Celeste, nude and kneeling down by the bed. She was gently caressing my lump and whispering to it too faintly for me to make sense of the words parting between her lips. I dared not move and lay as still as possible and pretended to sleep. I didn’t know who this woman was, but it was not the Celeste I had fallen in love with back at Niko’s. She stayed there by my side until the sun rose. She looked back over her shoulder towards the rising light and stood up. She dressed in her nurse scrubs and left. 

I lay there trying to make sense of the hellish night I had just experienced. Mother had given me bits and pieces of what it was like to have a partner, but she had certainly never described something like this.

I crawled out of bed and made my way downstairs. I could hear Celeste in the kitchen moving dishes around. I walked in to find her making eggs.

I cleared my throat as I took a seat at the kitchen table. “Celeste, last night.”

“Ugh, I can’t right now, Colin. I had a long day at work, so whatever hypochondriac issue you have cooking in that brain of yours is just going to have to go on the back burner.”

“Rough day at work?” I asked, perplexed.

“Yes, Colin. Not all of us got a ton of money from our dead mom. Some of us have to work for a living.”

“Celeste.”

She slammed her wooden spoon down on the counter. “For fuck’s sake, Colin. I have been at work all night dealing with annoying patients faking illnesses for painkillers and creepy doctors staring at my ass all night! I just got home! I just want to eat and go the fuck to bed! Is that too much to fucking ask for? Can you just shut the fuck up for a few fucking minutes and let me have some peace and god damn quiet?” She went back to stirring her eggs with the wooden spoon. I wouldn’t speak another word. I stayed sitting at the table. She finished cooking her eggs and ate them in complete silence. She tossed her fork down onto the empty plate and went to bed. I sat there at the table for hours. I finally stood and went to clean the dried eggs off her plate and pan. As I stood there focusing on the warm water running across my hands, I tried to make sense of how Celeste spent all night whispering to my lump. Why was she lying about being at work all night? I looked up to see the liquor cabinet on the other end of the kitchen beckoning me to open it. Beckoning me to peer inside for the first time since Celeste had claimed it for herself. I dried my hands and flung the doors open. Dozens and dozens of bottles lined the shelves. Brown, green, clear, and yellow. I would have thought it looked pretty if I didn’t already know how vile they tasted. I pulled the bottles out one by one to take a look at what they all were. I smelled each one in turn. Tequila, vodka, vermouth. Gin especially smelled foul. Then I came across a bottle I recognized. A small, plastic, orange bottle with a white cap. A child safety cap. It was my medicine. The medicine that Dr. Richards had given me was but the prescription date was after I had stopped taking the drug. I picked up the bottle to take a closer look, and there, behind that bottle, was another. Behind that bottle was another. I found six bottles in total. Each was jammed with the pills. Enough that had I continued to take them daily, I’d have enough for well over a year. Behind the bottles were two other troubling items. One was a bottle of some sort of medical liquid called Midazolam. The other was a booklet of prescription papers that had previously belonged to Dr. Richards.

I didn’t understand. She said I was perfect the way I was. Why was she giving me the medicine that had been making my lump grow? Why did she have so much of it? So much that she had a prescription pad to order more. What was Midazolam?

I picked up my phone and dialed the Wellspring Clinic.

“Thank you for calling the Wellspring Clinic. Can you please give me your name and date of birth?” Said a raspy-voiced woman on the other end. Her voice rattled with the sound of a lifetime of cigarettes.

“Hi, I’m Colin. I’m not a current patient. I just have a quick question I’m hoping you can help me out with.”

“Sure, Colin, go ahead,” said the smoky voice.

“My girlfriend actually works there. Well, she’s been.”

“Oh! A boyfriend is calling.” She exclaimed. Then with a hushed tone, “Are you planning a surprise? Who is the lucky girl?”

“Uh. Celeste, but what I wanted to ask is.”

“No, I don’t think so,” she interrupted. “Celeste doesn’t work here.”

“What do you mean she doesn't work there? Maybe you just don’t know her.”

“No. I’ve been here for twenty-two years this last Tuesday. I know everyone who works here, and there aren’t that many people to keep track of. It sounds like there is some confusion on your end, and I’m really sorry to have to be the one to break it to you. Celeste really should have been the one to tell you, but I can’t say I’m too surprised. She hasn’t worked here for two months now. She walked out and made a big stink about it. Threw brochures and papers all over the place. Real big mess to clean up.”

“That doesn’t make sense. She’s been going into work every night.”

“Honey, I don’t know where she’s been going every night, but it certainly isn’t the Wellspring Clinic.”

“I don’t understand.”

“Sometimes life throws you a curveball, honey. She’s a looker, and she was a talented nurse, but something in her snapped. She just wasn’t the same there at the end. Hope things get sorted out for you. You take care now, honey.” And with that, the phone went dead.

I was stunned. On the blindside of information slamming into me, I had completely forgotten to ask about the Midazolam.

“What’s going on, my love Lump?”

I spun around on my heels. There stood Celeste in her nightgown. The satin fabric spilled across her breasts, barely containing her as she rubbed the sleep from her eyes.

“What time is it?” She asked through a massive yawn.

The clock on the oven showed 2:33. I had completely lost track of time, getting lost in my thoughts. This was much earlier than she usually woke up, though.

“It’s really early. Why are you up?” I managed to ask through a guilty gulp.

“I just heard you talking to someone.” She walked to a cupboard and started to make some coffee. “Phone?”

“Yeah. Just a wrong number.”

“Sounded like a long phone call for a wrong number.”

“Some pushy salesman calling the wrong number. Couldn’t take no for an answer is all.” I said, staring down into the sink at the rest of the dishes I needed to finish up.

She stood very still for a moment before letting out another big yawn. “Ok,” she squeaked. “I hate those fuckers.” She began to pour the grounds into the top of the coffee maker. “Why don’t you go have a seat in the living room, Lump. I’ll fix my coffee up and I’ll bring you your nightly drink. I think you’ll like the surprise I’ve got lined up for you tonight.”

“Don’t you want to go back to sleep? It’s still so early for you.”

“What’s the point. I won’t be able to get back to sleep anyway, and we can hang out for a couple of extra hours. Go, have a seat, and relax. I’ll take care of mommy’s itty bitty boy.” She gently pushed me out of the kitchen and into the living room. “Sit, sit, sit.”

I plopped down onto the sofa. What in the world was going on? I reached down to hold my swollen lump, still the size of a basketball. What was her obsession, and what exactly was she putting in my drinks?
She soon emerged from the kitchen with her coffee in one hand and a tall glass of brown liquid in the other.

“Thought we’d just go for an easy classic for you tonight.” She shoved the drink into my hand. “Whiskey on the rocks.”

She sat down across from me and leaned in close. She reached up and ran her fingers through my hair. “Drink up.”

I brought the drink slowly up to my lips and began to take a sip. She lifted her hand up to the bottom of the glass and tilted it back. The whiskey and whatever else was in there flooded into my mouth. I swallowed it down with a few gulps, and it burned the back of my throat and nose. This was by far the worst-tasting drink she had given me, but I had managed to drink it down.

“Good boy.” She patted me on the head and took my glass. “I’m going to make breakfast real quick. You just lie here and relax. She made her way to the kitchen while looking back over her exposed shoulder at me with a smile. “I’ll be right back.”

As soon as she left the view of the living room, I jumped to my feet and ran down the hallway to the bathroom. I assumed my position at the toilet and let loose a violent torrent of brown fire and mystery medicine. I hadn’t eaten all day, so the contents of my stomach were almost empty save for the drink and bile. I flushed it down and ran back to the couch Celeste had left me at while wiping the corners of my mouth free of vomit for a second night in a row. I plopped down and did my best to appear comfortable. A moment later, Celeste came back in with a slice of toast and her coffee. She sat down across from me once again.

“Wanna watch the bachelor?”

I nodded my head. “Sure.”

I couldn’t tell you what happened on the bachelor. Even when I wasn’t in fear for my life I couldn’t stand the show. I only sat through it because Celeste loved it so much. I found every person on the show absolutely horrible, but she thought the show was hilarious. We made it through the episode when she looked over at me and furrowed her eyebrows.

“Aren’t you tired?”

This was it. She was expecting me to be tired from the drink. I had to play along in order to try to piece together the puzzle of how she was spending her nights. I put my arms up high over my head and faked a yawn.
“Oh, I am bushed,” I said as I started rubbing my eyes. I really needed to sell the idea that I was tired. “I think I’ll go get in bed early tonight.”

“Sounds good, Lump. Sweet dreams.”

I brushed the vomit and whiskey out of my teeth and crawled into bed. Truthfully, I was tired. Whatever she had given me was making me feel drowsy even after having put most of it down into the sewers below. My eyelids grew heavy as I lay still beneath the warm, soft sheets. I couldn’t lie there much longer pretending to be asleep before I actually fell asleep. The world grew dark and distant as I drifted off.

I dreamt again that night. More whispering between two beautiful lovers. One with the voice of an angel and the other with the sounds of an injured animal that had learned to talk.

“Did you bring it?” said the pained voice

“I bring it every night, love.”

“It’s time.”

“I can’t. I just can’t.

“Just do it already.” It snarled
gt
 I felt a pinch. I peeled my eyelids apart to find, once again, Celeste nude and kneeling next to the bed. Rubbing my lump and whispering frantically. I watched her for a few minutes. If this were anything like the night before, she would continue on for hours and hours before ending her bizarre pastime.
“Celeste?” I asked weakly through dry lips that stuck together as I said her name.

Her whispering stopped immediately, and she slowly turned her head to look at me.

“Celeste?” I licked my lips to moisten them. “What are you doing?”

She moved her hands down as if to hide them and continued to stare at me.

“Celeste. I called your work today. I know you’re no longer working at the clinic. I know you’ve been spending the nights coming in here and talking to yourself. I don’t know what’s going on, but I am deeply worried about you.”

Nothing. It was as though there was nothing there. She stared back at me with the eyes of an empty person.

“What are you hiding, Celeste?

Her gaze finally broke away from mine, and a look of shame spread across her face like wildfire. She handed me a small syringe.

“Celeste. What is going on?” I whispered to her.

With that, her nose crinkled and tears welled up in her eyes. She began weeping and placed her head down on my chest. My face was covered with her hair.

I put my hand onto her head and gently caressed her hair. “Tell me what’s wrong, Celeste. We can fix this. We can make things like they were once. We can get you help.”

I felt wet. A warm wetness. At first, I thought it was her tears cascading down me, but it was so much. It was all over me. I reached my hand down out of sight to touch the wetness and brought it back up to see. My fingers were drenched in red. I grabbed Celeste by the shoulder and sat her up along with me. The sheets were covered in blood, I was covered in blood, and Celeste was covered in blood. There in Celeste’s hand was a scalpel.
“Celeste! No! Why? Please don’t do this. You have so much to live for! I love you!” I screamed. I grabbed the scalpel to rip it away from her. In doing so, I sliced deep into my left hand, but I had managed to throw the instrument across the room. I didn’t care about my hand. I could fix that later, but for now, I needed to find where she had cut herself. I grabbed her arms to see where she had made the slices. It was difficult to maneuver my hand with the deep gash. I must have sliced through some tendons, but I had enough dexterity to lift her arms up and find nothing.

“Where did you cut yourself, Celeste! Please tell me!” I grabbed her head and started moving it around to see if she had cut her throat. Once again, nothing. All I could see was a perfectly healthy, beautiful woman covered in blood and weeping. I looked down, and that was when I saw it. I was the source of blood. A gash running across the lump had exposed the yellow and white of the fatty tissue beneath the skin. It ran the entire length of the lump, and it was clear that the growth was beginning to make its way out.

“Celeste! Why? Why did you do this?” I screamed. I took both my hands and, to the best of my ability, I attempted to hold the wound closed. Blood seeped from between the two flaps of skin. The wound looked awful, but I could barely feel it. Other than the wetness and warmth of the blood, there was almost no feeling at all.
“We were supposed to be together.” Said Celeste as she plunged her hands between the folds of skin I was holding together. No pain, but an overwhelming sense of pressure swelled up within me. I could feel a tugging at my innards. I let go with one hand and punched her square in the nose. It broke with a deafening crack as she fell backwards. Her hands, along with some of my intestines, spilled out of me. I grabbed them as quickly as I could and frantically started to shove them back inside.

Celeste leaped to her feet and lunged at me. I threw up my arms and managed to throw her down to the floor again. This short victory came at the cost of the intestines slipping out once more. This time, they plopped down onto the floor with a sickening, wet thud. I stood up, and the intestines spilled out more. I grabbed at them and tried to shove them back in with limited success. Celeste screamed incoherently. Her naked body writhed in the wetness, and her hair was a tangled, matted mess. Her eyes darted across the room to the scalpel on the floor. We both made a mad dash to be the first to get to it. There, our bodies entangled in a slippery mess on the floor. I held her face back with my limp hand. She bit into it deeply. I screamed out in pain, but I had a firm grip of the scalpel with the other hand. As she bit deeper and deeper into me, I swung the end of the blade upward into her throat. I swung the blade hard and deep over and over and over again. I kept swinging it after her body went limp and fell lifeless beside me.

Panting, I stumbled to my feet and grabbed at my side in an attempt to hold the wound closed. It was clear that I needed to stop the bleeding as soon as I could. I grabbed a towel and held it tightly to the cut. I made my way over to the mirror to see what Celeste had done to me. There it was. A clean cut about a foot long going vertically down my side. At the bottom were my intestines hanging out and dragging on the floor behind me. I moved the towel to the side a bit more to get a better look at the cut. As the folds of skin separated, I could make out a pair of milky eyes. They blinked.

I slowly peeled back the folds of skin and could make out more of a face. It was disgusting by any measure. Instead of a nose, it had only two shriveled holes. It’s lips were pulled back so far that they were barely there, and behind them were it’s gums holding onto tiny, chiclets of teeth. It had strands of hair falling across it’s brow in a wet mess, and it’s skin was mottled with vibrant reds, yellows, and sickening greys. It gasped for breath as if it had never tasted air before. With every breath it gulped down, I could feel my own lungs fill with a foul stench.

I couldn’t breathe. I had so many questions. Had this been in the entire time? Was this what Celeste wanted? What was I looking at? Most importantly, why was it so beautiful?
Something about this thing was drawing me in. It called to me. I knew now what Mother meant when she talked about love at first sight. I knew the kind of love she described to me in fairy tales. I thought what I had felt for Celeste was love, but that paled in comparison to this.

I pulled back at my skin and pushed from within to reveal as much as I could. There in my childhood bedroom, I held the face of my beloved. It’s face would be the last thing I would see before I drifted off to sleep one last time. Although Celeste had brought my life to an end, she had taught me that in the end, I could truly learn to love myself.",4,1753142512.0,u_noisypickle,0,1.0,False

# Monday, July 21st (Two New Ideas to Introduce!)

# Weather & Monday Rundown:

Monday's bringing us that sweet spot of Vermont summer weather: sunny skies with temperatures hovering in the comfortable upper 60s to low 70s range. Tuesday morning will have us reaching for light jackets as temps dip into the 40s and 50s, but afternoon sunshine will warm things back to the 70s. The real heat arrives midweek: Wednesday bumps us into the 80s, and Thursday? We're talking upper 80s to low 90s with humidity making its unwelcome return. Those planning outdoor activities should note that Thursday night into Friday brings our next shot at thunderstorms, though the weekend's looking solid with partly sunny skies and mid-80s temps both days.

Tonight's absolutely perfect for those Monday evening runs happening around town. The OGE Fun Run kicks off at 6 PM at Outdoor Gear Exchange, where Kae Ravichandran leads trail enthusiasts on lakeside routes that promise sunset views without the intensity, just pure running joy for all levels. Meanwhile, Skirack has their Monday Group Runs, also at 6 PM, aiming for 3-5 miles with pace groups to match everyone's comfort zone. The ONE Farmers Market runs until 6:30 PM today, transforming the Old North End into a celebration of local flavors with Ghanaian, Laotian, and Korean prepared foods alongside the usual farm-fresh suspects. Cap off your Monday at 6:30 PM with the Odd Fellows' summer BBQ potluck on North Ave. Bring something to grill or share, expect lawn games and good vibes, no entry fee required.

Tuesday's cool morning will warm beautifully for afternoon events, starting with UVM Dining's Job Fair from 1-5 PM at Harris-Millis Complex. They're offering $18.50-$25 hourly plus an extra $3 for evening and weekend shifts, which honestly isn't terrible for Burlington. The real Tuesday action comes at 4 PM when Cars and Foam takes over Foam Brewers' waterfront, launching WOLFSGART's weeklong automotive celebration with DJs, food trucks, and what promises to be an Instagram-worthy collection of cars against our lake backdrop. Wednesday brings major community engagement opportunities: the planBTV New North End Design Workshop runs 5:30-8 PM at Hunt Middle School, where residents can shape the neighborhood's future vision and weigh in on the VT-127 path connection. Same evening, car culture continues with Sunset on Pine at The Pinery starting at 5 PM, bringing food truck mania to the Arts District. Those seeking something more refined can catch the Craftsbury Chamber Players at 7:30 PM in Colchester performing Mozart, Boccherini, and Beethoven.

Thursday's heat wave timing couldn't be better for our evening festivities. Party on the Bricks returns at 5:30 PM featuring The Blue Dahlia's multicultural sounds and Church Street Tavern's pub fare. Expect dancing in the streets and that special Burlington summer energy. South Burlington's final Nite Out of the season starts at 5:30 PM on Dorset Street, complete with fireworks and a food vendor lineup that reads like a Burlington restaurant week roster. If you haven’t been, I hope you’ll check out the season’s last one! Car enthusiasts get their third event of the week with the Brew Hop at Switchback and Burlington Beer Company starting at 5 PM, because apparently we can't get enough beautiful vehicles paired with local brews. Round out your week with Paint & Sip at Venetian Soda Lounge at 7 PM, where Jesse Snyder teaches the art of #foodp\*rn painting while DJ Grant Burton sets the mood. And for those planning their weekend: Friday brings Recharge Friday at Savu Sauna Lakeside (7:30-9:30 PM): sauna, cold plunge, N/A cocktails and DJ beats for a different kind of Friday night party that gets you home by 10 ([$35 person](https://partiful.com/e/akAZBKE7Xy4oOMCetRua?fbclid=PAQ0xDSwLriolleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABpxg_JbbNieCac3-XovbnkcZErjXtpuKVHP2e4acwrQHB8a5A9xB-Pwn-ukKX_aem_AWEdITsMFXvc4O-LS2lemQ&utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)).

Weekly Wednesday Passeggiata Deals: [https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/wednesday-passeggiata](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/wednesday-passeggiata)

Burlington's historical July averages are around 81.8 °F for highs and 61.3 °F for lows. Currently, the weather is running cooler (highs in the mid‑70s and lows in the low‑50s) though it will trend back toward the typical warm summer feel by mid‑week

# Burlington Table: Meet 5 Strangers at a Brewery (Monday, July 28th)

I’m excited to finally pass 1,000 subscribers for my Burlington newsletter! To celebrate I’m excited to launch a new idea I’ve been working on:

**Burlington Table is a new way to meet real people around a real table. Just good conversation with 5 strangers-turned-friends (6 total) over drinks at a local brewery next Monday, July 28th at 6pm. Drinking is optional, not a requirement!**

Each gathering is small, curated, and 21+ (bring ID). We'll likely be at Foam Brewers, but other breweries may be included if there's lots of interest. I'll send 10 fun icebreakers ahead of time, just in case you want help keeping the convo flowing. I do my best to balance each table by age, gender, and shared interests, so your answers help make the magic happen.

As the evening unfolds naturally, you're welcome to order food or share appetizers if the mood strikes. Whatever feels right for the group! The focus is simply on enjoying genuine connection without any agenda or timeline. Foam has great non-alcoholic beer, seltzer and soda if you're not drinking or just prefer a clear mind!

There's a suggested $5–$10 Venmo u/BtownBrief to cover organizing time, but it's totally free if that's not doable right now.

If you're looking for something real, this is your seat at the table.

I hope you’ll check it out and tell your friends about! **The more people that sign up the better I can match the tables**! And if you want to read more about it check out this link:

# Local News (All Links Clickable)

[**Vermont Green FC completes another comeback, move on to USL 2 Conference Championship**](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/vermont-green-fc-completes-another-comeback-move-on-to-usl-2-conference-championship/65458858?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""We keep doing it. When you've got that passion for the club, you can do anything,"" per WCAX.

The Green have mastered the art of the comeback, pulling off their third straight come-from-behind victory to advance to their first Eastern Conference Championship in program history. Down 2-0 to FC Motown in the second half, they responded with three unanswered goals, including a penalty kick winner from Julien Le Bourdoulous. Head coach Chris Taylor credits the team's culture and the passionate local community for giving them the energy to keep fighting when they're down. The momentum's real here, this team's creating something special at Virtue Field, and Friday's conference championship (opponent TBD) promises to be electric.

[**Outdoor Gear Exchange to celebrate 30 years on Church Street**](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/outdoor-gear-exchange-to-celebrate-30-years-on-church-street/65450371?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""We've built our store around community. We are community-oriented,"" per MYNBC5.

Mark your calendars for Saturday, July 26, when OGE throws what's essentially Burlington's biggest block party of the summer. Running from 11 AM to 10 PM, the celebration kicks off with a staff band at 12:30 PM followed by local musicians throughout the day. The real genius here is their raffle system: every $30 you spend leading up to the event earns you a ticket, so your gear addiction finally pays off. After three decades as a Church Street anchor, OGE has earned its place as more than just a store; it's where Burlington goes to fuel its outdoor obsession and bump into half the town doing the same.

[**Here's What Happened at Last Night's Burlington City Council Meeting (7/14/25)**](https://www.reddit.com/r/burlington/comments/1m0eoxv/heres_what_happened_at_last_nights_burlington/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""Playing a 'relocation game' is a failed strategy,"" per Reddit/Btown Brief.

Apologies for missing this in Thursday's edition. The four-hour marathon meeting from last Monday deserves your attention. The most heated exchange centered on Food Not Cops' relocation to City Hall Park, with councilors split between those citing negative impacts and others arguing the city's playing whack-a-mole instead of addressing root causes. The ""City Circle"" restorative justice program proposal aims to fix our broken ticketing system by actually compelling engagement rather than just issuing fines that go unpaid. Meanwhile, the REIB office took a unanimous first step toward charter status, and renters finally got included in water bill assistance. Click the headline to see the full rundown, and others comments about it. And if you throughly enjoyed that rundown, be sure to check out the other complete summaries of Burlington city council meetings at [btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/city-council-summaries](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/city-council-summaries).

[**Federal cuts result in layoffs at Vermont Foodbank**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/20/federal-cuts-result-layoffs-vermont-foodbank/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""These are people who are doing good work and helping people, and you know, we're an organization that cares about people,"" per WCAX.

The Vermont Foodbank has laid off seven employees, nearly 9% of staff, as federal COVID funding dries up and USDA food allocations drop by 20%. CEO John Sayles assures that food distribution won't be affected, but these cuts highlight how fragile our safety net remains. The silver lining: the state Legislature allocated $1.5 million this year, and last weekend's Do Good Fest raised $210,000. Still, losing dedicated staff who've been feeding vulnerable Vermonters feels like a step backward at a time when food insecurity hasn't magically disappeared with the pandemic emergency declarations.

[**Stowe teen preps for gubernatorial race**](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/20/stowe-teen-preps-for-gubernatorial-race/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""When a kid in Vermont understands that there's a housing and affordability crisis, that's when you know it's bad,"" per VTDigger.

Dean Roy, a 14-year-old from Stowe running for governor on the Freedom and Unity Party ticket, might not unseat Phil Scott, but he's making points that resonate. The former legislative page who challenged Lt. Governor Rodgers on EVs is centering his campaign on property taxes and affordability; issues he admits seem ironic coming from someone who doesn't own property. His platform includes STR caps, a 5% tax on vacation rentals, and immigration reform. Whether you take a teenage gubernatorial candidate seriously or not, Roy's engaging his peers in politics and planning to stay on the ballot until he wins something, somewhere.

[**How the Lake Monsters kept swimming**](https://vtdigger.org/2025/07/20/how-the-lake-monsters-kept-swimming/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""The level of baseball is much better than when it was a single-A, short season,"" per VTDigger.

When MLB cut the Lake Monsters loose in 2020, it could've been game over for Burlington baseball. Instead, new ownership led by Chris English rebuilt the franchise as a summer collegiate league, won a championship their first season, and created something arguably better than what we had. GM C.J. Knudsen points to Vermont players like Wyatt Cameron and Colby Brouillette as proof that local kids can now dream of playing at Centennial Field (sorry, Delta Dental Park). With local partnerships from Arlington ice cream to Barre-bottled hot sauce, plus those genius 25-cent hot dog nights that pack the stands, the Lake Monsters have transformed from minor league afterthought to must-see summer entertainment.

[**South Burlington considers paying committee volunteers under new stipend proposal**](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/south-burlington-considers-paying-committee-volunteers/65460024?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""$50 per meeting, based on attendance, and a $20 bonus for the chair of each committee,"" per MYNBC5.

South Burlington's considering joining Essex, Colchester, and Winooski in actually compensating the volunteers who keep municipal government running. At an estimated $60,000 annually, it's a recognition that asking people to donate hours of their time to review development proposals or plan city initiatives maybe deserves more than a pat on the back. The vote happens tonight at 6:30 PM, and honestly, if we want diverse voices in local government, removing financial barriers to participation seems like a no-brainer.

[**Kona Beachside brings island flavor to North Beach**](https://www.mynbc5.com/article/kona-beachside-north-beach/65454948?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""I want people to walk away feeling relaxed,"" per MYNBC5.

Just when you thought North Beach couldn't get better, Kona Beachside Tiki Bar & Grill drops a slice of Polynesia on Lake Champlain. Owner Sandi Pasagic has created what sounds like the perfect Vermont summer spot: tropical drinks and island-inspired food with waterfront views, open daily from noon to 7 PM. After years of North Beach feeling like it was missing something beyond the snack bar, this addition gives us another reason to make the trek past the bike path. Pro tip: combine this with the Saturday beach scene for peak Burlington summer vibes.

[**Rash of Kia thefts continues to plague region**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/18/rash-kia-thefts-continues-plague-region/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""It's like a big joke. They pose it as like a trophy,"" per WCAX.

The TikTok-inspired Kia theft trend that started three years ago is somehow still happening, with about a dozen cars stolen in the past two weeks alone. The thieves are posting videos of their joyrides on social media before abandoning the destroyed vehicles. South Burlington Police are investigating, but no arrests yet. If you own a vulnerable Kia or Hyundai, contact your dealer about the fix; and maybe invest in a steering wheel lock while you're at it. The casual cruelty of destroying someone's transportation for social media clout is particularly galling when you consider how many people are already struggling with Burlington's cost of living.

[**Public media in our region braces for budget shortfalls**](https://www.wcax.com/2025/07/18/public-media-our-region-braces-budget-shortfalls/?utm_source=btownbrief.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=monday-july-21st-two-new-ideas-to-introduce)

""In order to maintain the services we provide, we're going to ask people to give more,"" per WCAX.

Federal cuts are hitting our regional public media hard: Vermont Public faces a $4 million shortfall (10% of budget), North Country Public Radio loses $650,000 over two years, and Mountain Lake PBS takes a devastating 35% cut. Vermont Public CEO Vijay Singh acknowledges they'll need to lean even harder on already-generous Vermonters. Rep. Elise Stefanik celebrated the cuts while calling NCPR's reporting ""false and defamatory,"" while Rep. Becca Balint called it a betrayal of rural communities. Whatever your politics, losing independent local journalism and emergency broadcasting capability seems shortsighted when we're increasingly dependent on reliable information.

# Volunteer Opportunity of the Week: Burlington Community Justice Center

There are so many volunteer opportunities in Burlington! This week I choose to highlight:

Help support neighbors who’ve experienced harm by volunteering with the *Parallel Justice* program at the Burlington Community Justice Center. This role involves checking in with victims after police reports, helping them navigate the legal system, and connecting them with local resources. Whether or not someone is held accountable, you’ll be part of a community response that prioritizes healing and support. Volunteers must be 18 or older and bring empathy, professionalism, and a respect for confidentiality. Training is provided—your presence can make a real difference.

Check out this page for links to four great sites with volunteer opportunities all around Burlington: [https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/volunteer-burlington](https://btownbrief.beehiiv.com/c/volunteer-burlington)

# 202+ Things to Do in Burlington (Summer Activities)

Today’s picks:

Five more to keep things feeling easy and open as the season winds down. Start your morning at the Burlington Farmers Market on Pine Street where you can pick up local produce, baked goods, and maybe catch some live music while you browse. Take a short hike through the woods at Niquette Bay State Park and cool off with a dip at one of the quiet beaches tucked along the shoreline. Visit the Fleming Museum on the UVM campus for a calm, air-conditioned break with a thoughtful mix of art and anthropology. If you're feeling curious, head over to the World's Tallest Filing Cabinet on Flynn Avenue for one of Burlington's weirder landmarks and a good photo spot. And when the light starts to fade, walk the boardwalk at Waterfront Park and watch the boats drift in as the sky shifts over the lake

# This Week’s Restaurant Review: Pizzeria Verità

Pizzeria Verità has carved out a solid reputation since 2012 as Burlington's go-to spot for authentic Neapolitan pizza, complete with a wood-fired oven imported directly from Naples. The restaurant's commitment to traditional technique shows in every pie: hand-stretched dough with the signature puffy cornicione edge, quality San Marzano tomatoes, and fresh fior di latte mozzarella that's made in-house. Standout pizzas like the Mais, featuring fire-roasted Vermont corn with speck and crème fraîche, successfully bridge Italian tradition with local ingredients, while classics like the Margherita deliver the pure, simple flavors that define true Neapolitan style.

The lively, energetic atmosphere matches the open kitchen setup where diners can watch skilled pizzaioli at work, creating an engaging dining experience that feels both authentic and distinctly Burlington. Co-owners Leslie Wells and John Rao's dedication to the craft is evident: Wells trained in Italy and New York to master traditional techniques, and their emphasis on local Vermont ingredients through partnerships like the Vermont Fresh Network adds a meaningful community connection. The restaurant consistently ranks among Burlington's top dining spots, earning recognition in local ""Daysies"" awards and maintaining strong online reviews for both food quality and service.

However, Pizzeria Verità's popularity can work against it during peak times, when the bustling atmosphere tips into chaos and securing a table without reservations becomes tough. Prices run $15-20 per pizza, which can feel steep for some, but not bad compared to surrounding pizza places. The limited menu can leave some diners wanting more variety beyond the antipasti selection. The high-energy environment, while part of the appeal for many, can feel quite busy for those seeking a quieter meal, and service can become stretched thin when the restaurant hits capacity. Despite these drawbacks, Pizzeria Verità delivers on its promise of authentic Neapolitan pizza in a vibrant setting that captures Burlington's local dining scene.

1m5z5ov,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m5z5ov,Needing layout and design tips,"I just moved into a new place with a bigger living room and brought all my old furniture, but the setup isn’t working here. It’s just one straight line: couch, coffee table, TV. It worked in my old space, but now it feels flat and blah.

I know I need to center the rug and pull it forward, and replace my destroyed cat tree lol, but I’m also thinking about rearranging things — maybe putting the couch in front of the big windows and adding two pretty comfy chairs where the couch is now. My boyfriend wants a recliner because he thinks the couch isn’t comfortable with its low back, and I’m not a fan of how most recliners look, but maybe there’s a decent option out there. I’m also not sure how we’d fit an extra chair that faces the TV if I didn’t move the couch. 

I’m planning to mount the TV, but the huge blank wall behind it is bugging me. I have four butterfly paintings (pictured last) I might stack on either side of the TV instead of putting them in the dining room like I originally planned.

If anyone has layout ideas and tips on making the huge wall behind the TV look better please let me know :)

TLDR: 
Moved into a bigger living room and my old setup isn’t working. Thinking about rearranging furniture, maybe adding chairs or a recliner. Also need ideas for decorating a huge blank wall behind the TV — open to suggestions!

1m5z54l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m5z54l,I Finished the First Act of My FG Spec Script. Here’s an excerpt:,"I wound up reworking a lot of what I wrote before into something slightly different, but a lot better. Now, I’m writing one where Lois decides to get Brian a new trainer, following a string of bad behavior. Brian develops feelings for his trainer in the second act, and in the third act, decides to act on them. Once I settled on this plotline instead, the first act practically wrote itself.

This excerpt is Lois and Peter trying different dog trainers and methods out before they find the trainer they like. Family Guy does this a lot, where the first act is tangential to the second and third acts, and is really about taking things slow and focusing on jokes rather than plot. It’s a good time to expand the plot outward and mine some humor out of secondary characters or cutaways, so that’s how I approached it.",1,1753142187.0,familyguy,1,0.67,False

Also the servers are not informing the customers of these charges 

i got nailed bad on 2 separate occasions recently with this on refills. One was a breakfast restaurant and coffee refill happen to not be free. Nothing on the menue mentions that and servers walked around asking if you would like a refill. Got hit with $40 worth of coffee for breakfast. 

Another restaurant didn't give free refills on sodas. While it was listed it wasn't obvious and not mentioned by the server.

Also charges for little things like $0.50 for a lemon and $1 for mayo or ketchup. Stuff like that just seems so petty.

I am in Orlando so maybe that's why but it's insane the stuff I have been seeing from a 5% admin fee to a 10% Togo fee for the box, silverware and bag that's listed as not a tip and for materials only. 

Plus the toast machines that they bring to your table with no paper recipet and you unknowingly don't know there is a service fee already added or some form of  ridiculous charge. 

It seems constant anymore at least by me.

I lived in Portland for about a decade, but it was literally last century.  One of my favorite memories of Portland was the breakfast scene in town.  These were the little tucked away store fronts, off the beaten track, where you would show up, put your name on a list because it was so damn popular, and they would have the best all you could drink coffee while you wait for your table. Then, once you sat down you were treated to a simply diverse menu, where the quality of the food had no equal.

* Where in the Des Moines area or surrounding area would you recommend looking for apartments?
   * I have some savings, and from the looks of things, I could survive for several months while I get settled if I'm not able to secure work before moving. I've got a spreadsheet of some places at various price points, and adding/editing them as my planning goes along.
   * From what ""research"" I've done so far, it seems traffic is markedly less than where I am now, so I'm not horribly worried travel distance, more so travel time.
   * I would of course, first get a place so I have an address and key(s) in hand before executing the below. Unless someone has ninja timing ideas.
   * I'm not too worried about noise. I'm a heavy enough sleeper that I've slept through all manner of alarms.
   * Having an electric vehicle, it's not a deal breaker if a place doesn't have EV charging on site, or garage/controlled access parking (as opposed to open air/carport free access parking) but they're certainly a plus.
   * I'd be getting a place by myself to start, so a studio or one bedroom and one bath.
* Would you rather drive or fly?
   * I don't have much furniture, just two small/square coffee/end tables and lots of moving boxes. To give some sort of an idea, if I had a minivan and Tetris'd things right, I could move my stuff in one trip.
      * Driving wise, it'd be multiple trips, as I have a sedan, but likely cheaper than shipping it all of course.
      * Shipping would cost more of course, but then spare me some logistical/time/planning headaches
   * Alternatively, I'd U-Haul one trip (or insert your own preferred rental moving van of choice here) the vast majority of my things.
   * A second trip would get my car, cat, and the important/last of my things there. It'd be about 26+ hours driving without rests/breaks/charging.
      * I don't think I'd mind it, with proper planning, rest stops, and recharging my car. I like road trips and seeing sights, but I also don't like being sat in a car for long.
      * Has anyone ever shipped their car? Prices I've found aren't super shocking, but again, driving it there myself would be far cheaper. If this ends up being the case, I'd fly myself and my cat over.
* Work
   * I'm exploring the process to transfer at work, and I've seen the difference in pay. My opinion is that it's a better pay to cost of living ratio there than here, even though it's less money than here.
   * I'm also not married to staying with my current employer, because being able to afford living is obviously primary.
   * I would of course make sure I have a job there before signing a lease and actually physically start moving. Worst case, I have savings that would float me for about half a year to a year.
   * If I end up not being able to secure employment right away, would apartments take a bank statement showing I can cover rent be sufficient?
* Car
   * I'm not worried about having to register my car in a new state. From what little I've been able to find, the wait times to do so seem faster. Maybe it's the population density compared to where I am now.
      * How would you say the process is? Do you feel like it's a ""long"" wait at the DoT?
   * Insurance is with the car manufacturer, which is on their app, but I can easily print that out. (sorry if this is vague, just don't want to accidentally dox myself from such an otherwise small detail).
      * Is the CA DMV form 411007 something I can fill out online or print out to fill on my own time?
      * Or would I have to get insurance with an Iowan/local company?
   * I know I'd have to get an Iowa license and matching plates
      * Filing a DMV 14 form to notify CA of what'd be my change in address within 10 days. Then surrender the CA plates when that bit of mail comes in, instead of getting lost (I worry about not exactly the most practical of things/scenarios. Is there a possibility they send a prepaid envelope for that?
      * I have the documents like title, registration, and proof of purchase. If I bought the car outright, would the papers I got from the dealer showing that be the proof of purchase?
      * Is the registration the paper thing that comes with the stickers you put on your plate?
   * Is it really a 30 day window to do all of the above?
      * Asking for planning purposes.
   * Having an electric vehicle, it's not a deal breaker if a place doesn't have EV charging on site, or garage/controlled access parking (as opposed to open air/carport free access parking) but they're certainly a plus.
* My cat
   * I'm of course filtering apartments I look at by if they allow pets. Cats and dogs in my case. I don't have a dog at the moment, but it's a thing I plan on having happen eventually.
   * I know I'd have to get a Certificate of Veterinary Inspection. I'd get her rabies vaccination and proof of spaying while I'm at it.
   * Are cats required to be licensed in the Des Moines area/Iowa state at large? I don't mind doing it, but I ask so I know to plan for doing it once I get there if it's required.

Reasons for why I'm making this move, or at least taking steps to execute it available on request. I will note that I intend for this to be long term at least, if not permanent. My plan is when I start pulling triggers on actually getting myself there, I'll make another post on stuff like social life, hobbies, and the like.

Have I forgotten anything? Is there anything I haven't yet researched and/or considered?

Disclosure: Tom is aware of my review, but no incentive given.

Timeline: 7/7 - inquired about the bag, he confirmed it was available, 7/9 - Tom sent me PSPs and I green lighted, 7/13 - He sent me tracking, 7/16 - Package arrived safe and sound 

Thoughts about the bag: I absolutely love the Puzzle bag! It’s super versatile, casual, and definitely packs a punch. This particular one was a little different for me since I’m not used to it being so lightweight, but I’m slowly falling in love with it. I actually bought it in brown too, but ended up rehoming that one because it just didn’t spark joy. But this black one? She speaks to my soul. My cold black soul. Lol, just kidding! The leather and hardware are gorgeous, and I really love that it’s understated and not out here yelling “look at me!”

Thoughts about the factory: Autumn (aka Qiutian) factory is, in my humble but slightly obsessive opinion, one of the best Loewe factories out there! Their leather? Absolutely to die for. And trust me, I’m that totally unhinged person who’ll buy the same bag from three different factories just to find the one. And honestly, Autumn wins. Hands down. Better than Jipin, better than Mango. Sorry not sorry. I said what I said. Please don’t come for me! lol. 😂 

Thoughts about the seller: What can I say about Tom? The guy is pretty great! He’s not even on the list and yes I’m living dangerously but I had to give him a shot and I’m so glad I did. He’s straight to the point (no fluff, love that), super responsive, and his PSPs? On point! I’d totally recommend him to anyone who likes their sellers like their coffee: strong, fast, and reliable!",24,1753141203.0,OGRepladies,9,1.0,False

I don't really know what I'm seeking, guess we'll see what the universe offers up with this roll of the dice. I'm a morning person. I work in healthcare. I love every animal I come across. My friends parents love me and I find community in most places. I spend a lot of my time behind the wheel of my truck at 65mph tearing up the backroads blasting TSSF at top volume.

I keep my friends coffee orders saved in the notes on my phone; even the ones I don't talk to anymore. I love waking up on the days when the air smells the same as it did in 5th grade on book fair day. I believe deeply in the underdog and generally believe you should always do the right thing. I spend my free time volunteering, hosting suppers, and making playists for my friends. 

I'm into blue collar dudes who can banter, uphold a strong barrier against a crowd at a concert, and who generally believes in things like working class solidarity, women's rights (and wrongs).

- late night drives 
- the way light filters through the trees 
- the smell of clay dirt

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

Reach out. I’d really love to hear from you.",3,1753141110.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.81,False

I’m moving out of my bf & I’s shared home and he says I’m selfish and heartless,"TLDR; Lived with my bf for past 2 years and have become miserable. I miss who I was and how our relationship was before we lived together. We have a large age gap, live different lives, or we did but he wants me to do nothing but spend everyday with him and I’m sick of it so I’m moving out. But he says that its selfish, heartless, and a stupid thing to do. 

Hello all. I’ve posted here a few times in the past and got a lot of wonderful advice. I am currently packing up and getting ready to move out of my 23F shared home with my boyfriend 45M into my own one bedroom apartment. We have been together since late 2021 early 2022, living together since 2023. The reason I am moving out is complicated, like 100 little reasons added up to me making this decision. I will summarize: He is lowkey a hoarder, he goes to this discount store with cheap prices and experiences FOMO and thinks he has to buy 10 cases of 30 energy drinks in case they won’t have any next time he wants them. Our home and bedroom is cluttered with mass amounts of those, little debbie snacks, multiple boxes of packaged sugars for coffee, clothes everywhere, etc. He keeps the house clean like doing dishes and laundry and sweeping mopping etc. but does not organize at all. He talks about the same few topics all day every day - the news, donald trump, cryptocurrency, ETF’s etc. Sure it’s cool and all but its literally like an annoying buzzing in my ear 24/7. 

I feel like the only time I get any peace is when he is at work. He gets upset when I want to do literally anything without him, wether it be hanging out with my friends who are also 20+ years younger than him, my family, letting the dogs out or even going to get gas down the street without him. 

I feel like I have lost my sense of self. I’ve lost all of my interests and hobbies, I keep to myself most of the time because he never stops talking and will interrupt me and change the topic most of the time if I try to. Then he gets upset that I never talk to him. There are cameras in every room and I stopped inviting any of my friends and family over because after a few times I did he revealed he was listening to our conversations through the cameras and asking me questions about things we spoke about in what I thought was private. 

He gets upset if I eat without him or don’t want to eat with him. I went from 115-120lbs to 205lbs since we moved in together. I was so happy in our relationship when we lived separately. I feel suffocated like I have no life outside of him and I’m so lonely despite never being alone. He is so clingy. And I feel like if I ignore these feelings I will grow to hate him and we’ll break up anyway, so I feel the best option is for me to move into my own place so I can have some much needed alone time and find myself again. I think it would make our relationship better too, it was so amazing before we lived together. As you can tell we have a large age gap and he is at the stage in life where he wants to wake up, drink coffee, watch the news, go to work and relax when he’s off. Me on the other hand I want to travel, take risks, go to the clubs with my girlfriends, etc… we are in very different stages and I’m so unhappy I feel like I’m becoming a recluse housewife with nothing to live for. I’m too young for this. We haven’t even been intimate at all since December bc of how weird things have been. 

I told him this is what I wanted about a month and a half ago, beginning of June. We talked for hours and it was emotional with some arguing, some crying, yanno. But ultimately he accepts that this is what I want. A week or two goes by and I find some apartments I’m interested in, and I’m aiming to be out by August so while he is at work and I’m off that day I begin packing up my things. He comes home from work and notices all the boxes and says “uh what’s all this” and I’m like “uh, I was just decluttering and organizing and packing and stuff” and we begin arguing because he is like “you havent said anything else about it I thought you finally came to your senses and decided not to be so selfish and rip our family apart” talking about the two of us and our four pets. Two of them were his before we got together, the other two I wanted. So I figure he will keep his two he’s always had and I will take the other two that I wanted. 

He repeatedly tells me how selfish and heartless I am, how you don’t do this to someone you love, how it’s stupid and retarded and makes no sense and that we’re going backwards instead of forwards. then he says things like “I don’t want to force you to stay with me or anything I want whatever is best for you but moving out isn’t it.” and he asks me how does living with him prevent me from doing what I want to do, how can I do anything better when I’m alone, etc. I’ve spent hours explaining how I felt and I don’t know how many different ways I can say it for him to understand. He makes it so difficult to say anything. I finally told him that “I’m not being heartless or selfish, I’m just putting my well being above the guilt I feel FOR ONCE.” He didn’t like that very much. 

Anyways I finally got approved for an apartment I really like and put down the security deposit, I go sign the lease and get my keys on July 25th. It’s only $850 a month for like 900 sqft, accepts my pitbull and my cat which is very rare to find in my area, has many amenities, also only 1 street away from my job whereas I currently am 20 minutes away going on the highway, etc. I’m so happy and so excited, but I’m so terrified to tell him that I found a place when he gets home tonight. I know it’s just gonna be a repeat of the other conversations we’ve had about it with him belittling me and insulting me and trying to make me change my mind. I guess my question is, tell me honestly, am I really that awful for wanting to have my own place? Is he right that I’m selfish and heartless? How does me having my own space mean I don’t love him? I’ve never lived alone before, I moved out of my moms house straight into his, and I feel like it’s just something I need to experience or I will regret it forever. am I the asshole?

I feel like I am really good at handling any inconveniences. My family *really* loves to nag. In ‘22 me, my dad, my step mom, and my step sister moved in with my auntie, cousin and gradma. There’s 7 of us total—my cousin moved out, but she still visits every week—so there’s really 6 of us living here.

My cousin is allergic to my cat, so I was really excited when she moved out because that meant that my cat got to explore the house. Turns out, my aunties boyfriend is horribly allergic to them, even worse than my cousin was. Fine, whatever, I can’t argue that.

Anyways, my grandma moved out for awhile too. She was actually kicked out. I found my step-moms walker in my grandma’s storage garage, she said “well I didn’t see anybody using it”—my step-mom literally just had surgery. So, you know, extremely important things, sometimes sentimental things too, were going missing or being found broken. My dad kicked her out after she broke an old wineglass, and it all stopped.

Then she went to the ER right after christmas and was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, stage 5 kidney failure, and a bunch of other shit. She moved back in with us. I have mixed feelings. I love her, she’s my grandma so obviously I love her. She’s a horrible roommate, a roommate straight out of hell. And she has cancer so we’ve all been chipping in in some way to help her through treatment.

She has friends, therapists, family members over every single week with no warning. She throws paint parties and covers the kitchen island and table with a plastic table cloth, puts a bunch of art junk on it, and watches Bob Ross with her friends.

My dad went on vacation for a few days, and she threw 3 of these parties. I was constantly being introduced to someone, dragged into a conversation, or tiptoeing around her mess. It’s in the fucking kitchen, and she’s an early bird, so just getting a cup of coffee was a struggle. 

My auntie insists that my grandma only threw 2 parties, and only had *one* friend over. Well, my boyfriend stayed 2 days and 12 hours this week. My auntie insists he stayed over for 4 days. She lied in my grandmas favor and lied to smear me. What the fuck. 

I feel like there’s teams here. My auntie, cousin, and grandma VS. me, my dad vs. my step-mom. 

My step-mom feels like everyone is constantly attacking her. My dad and I feel like everyone’s constantly attacking us. My auntie, cousin, and grandma are always stirring shit up.

My cats been stuck to a bedroom for 3 years of his little life, my time with my boyfriend is getting more and more limited, I barely rack in any pay from my job, I got no high-school diploma, grandma’s got cancer, my entire house hold is beefing in one way or another.

The fuck am I gonna do about it? Gonna get wasted tonight with my friends around a fire, right now I’ma smoke another bowl n clean up my room a little (got a new vacuum n dresser today from the thrift). At some point, gonna move the fuuuuuck out.

My whole life right now revolves around my grandma, her cancer, and death. Everyday since December, I overhear or I’m dragged into a conversation about death and cancer. Her cancer, my great-aunts cancer n death, my great-grandpas cancer n death. I get walls of texts about it.

I don’t want it to be my responsibility anymore. Ion wanna worry about my auntie’s boyfriend’s cat allergy, or every relative to have died of cancer, ion wanna worry about how I’ma get a chore done without also having a conversation, how I’ma keep all 5-7 other people happy. Fuck doin’ their dishes, Ion wanna do their dishes, I wanna do mine n my boyfriend’s. His mom has a studio and a big back-yard that’s screaming for me to make a garden. It’s got everything but a washer and dryer. Another year n I’ll be able to move out there 🙏 space isn’t big enough for Mac still but I’ll get him a catio. 


Edit:
Now I feel horrible. This happens every single time I rant about my grandma in a journal or on here. Like I gotta accept every annoying part of her, make room for it, and love her every second she’s here ‘cause I don’t have a lot of moments left with her. At the same time, I’m emotional, barely holding myself together, and tired of being confined and restricted in what I can do. It’s more a rant about my living situation. My biggest issue is with my aunt. There’s too much to say, but in summary she is evil lmao. ",1,1753140934.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

1m5ykz6,https://i.redd.it/qaiy8i4dbbef1.jpeg,"Tuesday, July22, 2025 | Word of The Day ""Self-mastery"" - 😌True Power Lies Within • [Click to Expand]","## **Inner Peace in a World You Can’t Control**

You ever notice how exhausting it is trying to control everything around you? People, events, conversations, traffic, politics—like trying to plug leaks in a sinking boat with bubble gum. For years, I operated under this illusion that if I could just get the outside world in order, I’d finally feel okay on the inside. Spoiler alert: that never happened.

Then I came across that quote, you cannot control the wind, but you can adjust your sails, and it hit me harder than I expected. Life is chaos sometimes. We can’t always stop the wind from blowing, but we can choose how we navigate it. That’s where our real power lies.

Take a day where everything seems to go wrong—missed the bus, spilled coffee, bad news at work. You can spiral into frustration, or you can pause, take a breath, and choose not to let those moments dictate your mood. Hard? Absolutely. Impossible? Not at all.

Gandhi’s advice—be the change you wish to see in the world—isn’t a call to take on the world’s problems single-handedly, but an invitation to start with ourselves. Want a kinder world? Practice patience in the checkout line. Wish people listened more? Put down your phone and listen deeply during your next conversation. Real transformation ripples outward from personal responsibility.

Confucius said, he who conquers himself is the mightiest warrior. That doesn’t mean suppressing feelings or pretending we’re unaffected—it means noticing the angry flare-up, the jealousy, the fear, and saying, “Ah, there you are again,” instead of letting those emotions drive the car. That’s real strength right there.

Stoic wisdom reminds us, it’s not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters. Life will serve us some rough dishes. We can't always control the ingredients, but we choose the attitude with which we swallow them. I had a tough boss once—micromanaging, blunt, hard to please. Initially, I stewed in resentment. But eventually, I shifted perspective: I used that experience to learn patience, emotional regulation, and how not to lead others. Perspective is everything.

And Lao Tzu wasn’t wrong when he said, mastering others is strength. Mastering yourself is true power. We all want influence. Truth is, the most powerful influence comes from presence—not dominance. You walk into a room calm, self-aware, grounded? People notice. No loud speeches needed.

Every day offers a new test: Will I let the world push my buttons, or will I choose how I respond? Rule your mind or it will rule you—and honestly, truer words were never spoken. Self-mastery isn't about shutting out the world but engaging with it consciously, mindfully.

So no, we can't change storms into sunshine. But we can grab the wheel, adjust the sails, and decide the kind of person we’ll be in the weather. Peace starts there. In the mind. In the pause between trigger and reaction. In refusing to let outer chaos destroy inner stillness.

Because in the end, you may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them. That decision is where your freedom lives.

basically im 25 years old and 2 years ago i came out of an abusive relationship with someone that controlled everything, even my money. towards the end of my relationship with her, i chipped my back bottom molar slightly and it started to hurt. in the flat we lived in, the tap water was disgusting and my ex refused to buy a filter or bottled water because she didn’t like water and she had an addiction to coca cola so literally that’s all we drank and before i was with her, i never touched that stuff, i. drank water, coffee and tea and thats it. but she took all my money so i couldn’t even buy myself water so i was drinking coke everyday and i was so depressed being with her that i didnt even care so now my teeth are fucked up. i wasn’t registered with a dentist at the time my tooth chipped and so i asked her if she would drive me to the emergency dentist (i can’t drive), she said no because she’s scared of dentists and she refused to even drop me off outside for that reason. 

not only could i not go because she wouldn’t take me but i also couldn’t afford to pay for any checkup or treatment because she literally would take all of my money everytime i got paid so i just had to leave it. eventually it kept chipping and hurting to the point that i went back home to my parents and begged my mum to take me cause i was in so much pain, so she took me and i was told my molar was decayed and that i would need a root canal but they gave me a filling with clove oil for the time being to stop the pain and my mum paid for the treatment. that was 2 years ago and the filling has just fully come out and i literally have half a molar that is broken at the gum and for the last few days its been hurting non stop. ive had to keep taking ibuprofen, dabbing clove oil on it, rinsing my mouth with salt water but its so painful. but i just know that the tooth is probably worse now and i simply can’t afford to fix it, and my mum can’t either. i’ll probably need the tooth extracted but again i can’t afford it, even though i want it so bad, id do anything to stop the pain im exhausted its constant all day everyday now. im also so depressed about it and stressed about it that im literally having nightmares multiple times a week about all of my teeth falling out and ive been crying over it. ive always prided myself in taking care of my teeth, i had braces as a teenager to straighten my teeth and i was so confident after i had them taken off and i loved my teeth all for it to be ruined because i got into a bad relationship and now i’m stressed and in pain constantly.

if there’s anyone that’s dealt with similar, did the pain ever stop eventually on its own? has anyone ever lived with a broken molar and it’s been fine? or is it gonna get worse and am i literally gonna have to scrape up every single penny i have and get it sorted? 

thankyou.

Used to be your favorite, you'd watch it with me, fall
Now the hues are fading, just like the memories
Echoes in the silence, where your hand used to be.

And these empty spaces, they scream your name at night
Every corner whispers, 'til I turn on the light
Tryna fill the silence, with anything but you
But my heart keeps chasing, a love I can't undo.

Saw your ghost last Tuesday, walking down the street
Same old coffee shop, where our eyes used to meet
Thought I'd moved on from it, the tears I used to cry
But a cold wind reminded, you're the one I said goodbye.

And these empty spaces, they scream your name at night
Every corner whispers, 'til I turn on the light

Maybe it's the whiskey, or maybe it's the rain
But every single feeling, brings back the same old pain
Wish I could unlearn you, erase every trace
But your smile's burned deeply, in this lonely, empty place.

Planning a trip to Vancouver, or just curious about what makes this city so special? Look no further! As a local, I've put together this comprehensive guide with all the insider tips, must-sees, and hidden gems to help you make the most of your visit (or appreciate your own city even more!).

Vancouver is an incredible blend of urban sophistication and natural beauty, offering something for everyone – from outdoor adventurers to foodies, and culture enthusiasts. Let's dive in!



# 🏞️ Must-See Attractions & Iconic Experiences



These are the classics for a reason!

* **Stanley Park:** You *have* to do the Seawall! Rent a bike or walk a section of it. Don't miss the Totem Poles and Prospect Point for incredible views. The Vancouver Aquarium is also within the park.
* **Granville Island Public Market:** A vibrant hub of food, art, and local goods. Take a False Creek Ferry (Aquabus or False Creek Ferries) to get there – it's a fun experience in itself! Grab some candied salmon or jerky, and definitely try a donut from Lee's.
* **Gastown:** Historic district with cobblestone streets, Victorian architecture, and the famous Steam Clock. Great for photos, unique shops, and a good spot for a pub crawl or upscale dining.
* **Capilano Suspension Bridge Park (Paid) OR Lynn Canyon Park (Free):** If you're looking for a suspension bridge experience, Capilano is grand and has more attractions (tree top adventures, cliffwalk), but it's pricey. For a free, equally beautiful alternative, head to Lynn Canyon Park for its suspension bridge, trails, and swimming holes.
* **Museum of Anthropology (UBC):** If you have the time and interest, this museum at UBC is a must-see for its stunning collection of Indigenous art and artifacts. Pair it with a visit to the Nitobe Japanese Garden and a walk through Pacific Spirit Regional Park.
* **Grouse Mountain:** Take the Skyride up for panoramic views of the city, ocean, and mountains. Offers hiking (the Grouse Grind for the ambitious!), lumberjack shows, and grizzly bear habitat. In winter, it's a popular ski destination.
* **Queen Elizabeth Park:** Beautiful gardens, Bloedel Conservatory, and great city views. A lovely place for a leisurely stroll.
* **Canada Place & Waterfront:** Iconic sails, cruise ship terminal, and a great starting point for exploring downtown. Enjoy the seawall walk along Coal Harbour.



# 🚶‍♀️ Hidden Gems & Local Favourites



Want to experience Vancouver like a local?

* **Lonsdale Quay Market (North Vancouver):** Take the SeaBus from Waterfront Station to North Van. Similar vibe to Granville Island but with different vendors and great views of the downtown skyline. Explore the Shipyards District afterwards.
* **Main Street (Mount Pleasant):** Known for its independent boutiques, vintage shops, cool coffee houses (try The Dandelion or Metallion), and diverse restaurants. Has an eclectic, hipster vibe.
* **Commercial Drive:** ""The Drive"" is Vancouver's Little Italy, with a lively, multicultural atmosphere. Home to unique shops, cafes, and fantastic restaurants (check out Kulinarya for Kamayan-style Filipino food!).
* **Keefer Bar (Chinatown):** A highly-rated cocktail bar, often making ""best of"" lists. Be aware it's near the Downtown Eastside, so be mindful of your surroundings, especially at night.
* **The Magnet / Brassneck Brewery (Mount Pleasant):** If you're into craft beer, these are popular spots with great rotating taps and a chill vibe. The Magnet also has an underrated food menu.
* **Reliques Marketplace:** One of the best antique stores in Vancouver, located on 4th Plain.
* **Deep Cove (North Vancouver):** Rent a kayak or paddleboard and explore the calm waters, or hike the Baden Powell trail up to Quarry Rock for a stunning view (check trail conditions as it's sometimes closed).
* **Port Moody (via SkyTrain):** A nice small city with unique shops and restaurants, accessible by the Evergreen Line.
* **Spanish Banks:** A beautiful beach with incredible views of the city and mountains, especially at sunset. Great for a long walk.



# 🍜 Foodie's Paradise: What to Eat & Where



Vancouver's food scene is incredibly diverse and delicious.

* **Asian Cuisine (especially Richmond):** Vancouver, and particularly Richmond, boasts some of the best Asian food outside of Asia.
   * **Dim Sum:** Kirin, Sun Sui Wah (Main St. location), and Dynasty are highly recommended for authentic dim sum. Avoid Pink Pearl or Cindy's Palace for quality.
   * **Ramen:** Kintaro is a long-standing favourite.
   * **Filipino:** Kulinarya on Commercial Drive for Kamayan (eating with hands on a banana leaf).
   * **Vietnamese:** Try the Canh Chua Ca soup (hot & sour with prawn, tamarind, tomato, pineapple).
   * **Malaysian:** Tropika is often mentioned.
   * **Chinese BBQ/Roast Meats:** HK BBQ Master (Richmond) is legendary.
* **Seafood:** You're on the coast! Fresh seafood is a must.
   * **Granville Island:** Get candied salmon or jerky. ""Go Fish"" is a popular spot for fish and chips. ""The Lobster Man"" for East Coast lobster rolls.
   * **Blue Water Cafe:** A high-end option for an incredible seafood tower.
* **Breweries:** Vancouver has a thriving craft beer scene.
   * **Mount Pleasant/Science World Area:** Main St Brewing, Brassneck Brewery, 33 Acres, Electric Bicycle, R&B Brewing, Faculty Brewing.
   * **North Vancouver:** Yellow Dog, Beere, Superflux.
* **Brunch:** Palate is a good option.
* **Iconic Snacks/Dishes:**
   * **Pork buns:** New Town Bakery in Chinatown.
   * **Sir Spam-a-Lot sandwich & sinigang fries:** Shameless Buns food truck.
   * **Afghan Horseman:** Ask to sit in the Afghan room (cushions on the floor) for a unique experience. Try the Vegetarian Lover's Delight.
* **Coffee & Cafes:** Vancouver has a strong coffee culture.
   * **Matcha:** Ele Cafe (high quality), Cafe Mira (decent), Blue Chip Cafe (UBC - good strawberry matcha).
   * **Late-night cafes:** Support those that stay open later if you're looking for non-bar options.



# 🚶‍♀️ Getting Around



Vancouver's public transit system (TransLink) is efficient and easy to use.

* **Compass Card/Tap-to-Pay:** You can buy a Compass Card (rechargeable) or simply tap your credit card/mobile wallet at SkyTrain stations and on buses.
   * **Fare Zones:** The SkyTrain uses a zone system (1-3 zones), but buses are always a 1-zone fare. On weekends and holidays, all travel is charged at a 1-zone rate.
   * **90-minute transfer:** A single fare payment allows for unlimited transfers within the zones you've paid for within 90 minutes.
   * **Day Pass:** If you plan on doing a lot of transit in a single day, a Day Pass ($11.50) can be economical.
* **Walkable City:** Downtown Vancouver, Gastown, Yaletown, and the West End are very walkable.
* **Bike Share:** Mobi bikes and Lime scooters are available in central areas, great for exploring the Seawall.
* **False Creek Ferries (Aquabus/False Creek Ferries):** A fun and scenic way to get around False Creek, including Granville Island, Olympic Village, and Yaletown.
* **To/From Airport:** The Canada Line SkyTrain connects directly to YVR (Vancouver International Airport) from downtown. Note there's a surcharge for airport travel.



# 🗓️ Best Time to Visit



Vancouver has a moderate, oceanic climate, but it does have a reputation for rain (especially in late fall/winter).

* **Summer (June - August):** Warmest and driest months, ideal for outdoor activities, but also the busiest and most expensive.
* **Shoulder Seasons (April-May & September-October):**
   * **April-May:** Gorgeous with cherry blossoms, magnolias, and rhododendrons in bloom. Warmer than winter, and good for low-elevation hikes.
   * **September:** Often considered the ""best"" month by locals. Still warm and dry, but the major summer tourist crowds have thinned out, and prices might be slightly lower.
* **Winter (November - March):** Wettest months, with frequent drizzle. Alpine hiking trails will be covered in snow, but lower elevation trails are often still accessible. Good for skiing/snowboarding on the local mountains. November is statistically the wettest month.



# 🌲 Day Trips & Beyond



If you have extra time, consider these easy escapes:

* **Whistler:** World-renowned ski resort (in winter) and mountain biking/hiking destination (in summer). You can take a bus there, and the town is walkable without a car.
* **Squamish:** Home to the Sea-to-Sky Gondola (highly recommended for views and trails) and the Stawamus Chief (popular hiking/climbing). Easily accessible by car, or some bus services.
* **Bowen Island:** A short ferry ride from Horseshoe Bay (walk-on is easy). Offers beautiful trails (Mount Gardner hike!), a lake to walk around, and charming village.
* **Victoria (Vancouver Island):** A longer day trip (or overnight) via BC Ferries. Explore the Inner Harbour, Parliament Buildings, Royal BC Museum, and Butchart Gardens. No car needed if you stick to downtown Victoria.



# 🌃 Nightlife



Vancouver's nightlife varies depending on what you're looking for.

* **Gastown:** Great for pubs, craft beer, and some upscale cocktail bars (e.g., Six Acres, Pourhouse, Alibi Room).
* **Yaletown:** Trendy bars and restaurants, good for a ""vibe"" and seafood.
* **Granville Street:** Known for its more mainstream clubs (e.g., The Roxy - a classic, often ""greasy"" good time; Celebrities for EDM/club music; Fortune Sound Club). Some Redditors recommend avoiding the ""Granville bro bars"" for better vibes.
* **Red Room (Gastown/Chinatown-ish):** Popular for bass music, EDM, and Latin nights, with a generally friendly crowd. Bring earplugs!
* **The Shameful Tiki Room (Mount Pleasant):** A fun, themed cocktail experience. Reservations recommended.
* **Late-Night Cafes:** A growing trend for those seeking a more relaxed evening without alcohol.



# Important Tips & Local Etiquette



* **Rain Gear:** Regardless of the season, it's always wise to pack layers and a waterproof jacket. An umbrella is also a good idea outside of July/August.
* **Respect Nature:** Stay on marked trails, pack out what you pack in, and be aware of wildlife, especially when hiking.
* **Downtown Eastside:** East Hastings Street, while home to some historical areas, is also the heart of Vancouver's drug and homelessness crisis. While generally safe if you mind your own business, it can be confronting, especially for first-time visitors. Exercise caution, particularly at night, and avoid staring or taking photos.
* **Tipping:** Standard in Canada is 15-20% for good service at restaurants and bars.
* **Recycling/Compost:** Vancouver is very environmentally conscious. Look for multiple bins for different waste streams.

That's a wrap on my Vancouver megapost! I hope this helps you plan an amazing trip or discover new favourites in your own city. Feel free to ask any specific questions in the comments, and I'll do my best to answer them!

Another lonely morning with many sighs.
Cold coffee, just like broken promises.
Left stranded, a broken masquerade.
Used to chase the wild horses in the mind.

A beautiful disaster, figuring out how.

Your face in every street.
A phantom touch, a whisper that can't be outrun.
Time is said to heal all wounds, but mine just deepen.
Trapped in this echo chamber, reliving every blast.
Remember dancing in the kitchen.
Now the silence screams the loudest.

Maybe someday the sun will shine brighter.
And heavy chains around the heart will grow lighter.

a place where the moon

gets to you before me.

I build you

You say, “One day…”

and I sigh,

then beg again:

""Please invent teleportation""

or at least a damn wormhole -

I’m tired of loving you

through signal and screen.

We joke

about portals in the pantry,

about quantum socks

that slip us

into each other's arms.

You say you'd beam to my bed

in boxers and charm -

no customs,

no bags,

just heat and heart.

But until then,

we stretch across

this digital thread,

pressing I miss you

through blue-light glass,

holding silence

like it’s something we can kiss.

You call me

from your kitchen,

while I’m brushing my hair.

We laugh

in a language,

only we speak.

The distance

is an ache, yes -

but it’s also a dare,

a game of soft waiting

and hard want.

Because even from miles away,

your voice knows the map of me.

And somehow,

in this tangled in-between,

you’ve made your way

into the folds

of my every day -

turning this life

into a story

more than the construct of time,

more than an address -

1m5yf02,https://www.reddit.com/r/COVID19positive/comments/1m5yf02/between_a_rock_and_a_hard_place/,Between a Rock and a Hard Place,"I’m struggling.

My wife has advanced MS. As a result, since the beginning of the pandemic I informally retired (at 38 lol) from my career in theatre 1) because there was no theatre and 2) she required home care and I was the best bet.

During that time we were told by her neuro team to avoid COVID at all costs. That they didn’t know what would happen, if the vaccines would work, etc. We made every sacrifice - we stopped seeing friends and family (mostly), we haven’t been to an event of any kind, I haven’t been back to work, we have basically been isolated in our home since the beginning.

To complicate matters, during a visit from her parents to drop off some things we needed, they  were clearly positive but asymptomatic and COVID was in the house and my wife got it. She was asymptomatic as well BUT her MS went bananas. She was hospitalized and it was the last time she ever stood on her own again (she has pretty advanced at this point, but this infection certainly accelerated things).

Because of that we returned to our very isolated lives. We connect online with friends and families, I once had a distanced, masked, outdoor coffee (in our back yard) with my BFF - you get the picture.

Cut to today…out of NOWHERE I have been offered my dream job. It is something I’m so passionate about and love and we could definitely use the money (we live on her disability as our savings was drained a couple years into the pandemic). I want the job. My wife wants me to take the job.

But.

Y’know.

And it would be in an arena. Broadcasting hockey. So a cold arena. Where nobody masks. 

I could make periodically, but not always. There is great filtration, but also 10,000 people every game. 

This is like going from 0 to 100.

We’re both so apprehensive to the point I have delayed giving them as answer. We non-stop talking about this, going in circles…amazing opportunity, money, happiness, a chance to get back to living…but she doesn’t have much of a buffer anymore. Getting COVID could ruin her quality of life. Or not! Who knows!

I’ve had other opportunities and always turned them down. We still isolate at home and don’t go out to do anything. Literally. Outside of doctors appointments, we don’t really leave the house. Mental health declining. Mostly me. But her too.

This is obvious, isn’t it? I have to turn it down…

It’s like the WORST environment. During the WORST season. We have had a booster every six months (how well it works for her we don’t know due to immunosuppressant medication). Get our flu shots. Got out RSV. 

I’d be in arena one to twice a week for 7 months. The rest of the work can be done from home.

When can we go back to living? Ever? Is our reality that we can never return to normal living?

(I know I could get a work from home job. That’s not the main concern. I’d do this job for free. The point is the job itself and getting back out there).

We both WANT this. But we both have a tremendous amount of anxiety.

Any insight?

Same old coffee shop, same vacant chair, staring out at the humid air.
Used to share our secrets, hopes, and dreams, now the silence shouts, or so it seems.
Trying to drown it out with the city's roar, but your laughter still knocks at my door.

I thought I'd built these walls so high, a fortress against every bitter goodbye.
But the city's got a way, of pulling you back into the fray.

And the neon echoes, keep repeating your name
But I'm learning to find, my own rhythm in this game.
Yeah, the neon echoes, they can call and they can plea

Bridge

Maybe one day, the echoes will fade, just another story, softly played.
But for now, I'll let them linger, a reminder of the strength I hold within, my soul a fearless singer.

And the neon echoes, keep repeating your name
But I'm learning to find, my own rhythm in this game.
Yeah, the neon echoes, they can call and they can plea
But I'm dancing solo now, and finally feeling free!

Finally free... Yeah... free...",1,1753139849.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False

I sent him a couple of other examples posted here where one agent called a girl pretty & another agent told a someone there’s more to life than Instagram & to find another job when he explained he was losing income as a result of his suspended account.

I usually love city vacations—walking around, finding cool coffee shops, artsy stuff, photo spots, anything with character. But I’m open-minded! Are there any hidden gems, day trips, beaches, bars, nature stuff, or local events you’d recommend that don’t feel like… senior citizen bingo night?

I’d love to hear from locals or anyone who’s spent time there. Even quirky or weird recs are welcome. I just want to make the most of it. Thanks in advance!",1,1753139620.0,capecoral,3,0.67,False

After yet another $6 latte that tasted burnt, I finally pulled the trigger on a decent grinder and started brewing at home. Best decision I’ve made in ages.

**The money thing is insane.** I was easily dropping $200+ monthly at coffee shops. Now I’m getting better coffee for maybe $50 in beans. That’s vacation money right there.

But honestly? The control is what hooked me. Bad shot? I know exactly why. Perfect cup? I can replicate it tomorrow. There’s something deeply satisfying about dialing in variables until you hit that sweet spot where everything just *clicks*.

**The learning curve is real though.** My first month was a graveyard of over-extracted disasters and sour disappointments. Now I’m nerding out over water ratios and arguing with myself about whether this Ethiopian bean needs 30 seconds longer bloom time.

The community aspect surprised me too – never thought I’d be the person asking strangers on the internet about grind particle distribution, but here we are.

**So, fellow home brewers:**

- What was your “aha!” moment that made it click?
- Any epic fails that taught you something valuable?
- What’s one piece of advice you’d give someone just starting out?

Currently obsessing over pour-over technique, but thinking about diving into espresso next. Someone please tell me that’s not a rabbit hole I’ll never climb out of… 😅",0,1753139618.0,pourover,14,0.31,False

Ive had a hard life that i wont get into here but my best friend is the only person ive ever truly opened up to in my life and she said the same of her relation to me. We meet a year into uni and from the moment i first met her i knew we'd be great friends even though her first words to me were ""who the fuck are you"". She's the best person ive ever met.

  
She's the funniest, kindest, most open and loving person I've ever met. We've been through a lot of the same types of trauma and bounded over are overlapping mental illnesses. But this wasn't just a trauma bond is was so much more than that.

  
About a year and a half ago i went into a pysch ward and it was so hard for me being at my lowest like that but she came to visit me one day and the world light up when she was with me. After i left the ward she became distant for 8 months and eventually messaged me and we patched things up. But after her birthday part shortly after talking again she stopped talking to me again. Ive tried to meet up for coffee at least 3 times and she's always down for it and ghosts me on the day or texts me that night explaining why she didn't show.

  
So is my friendship over and am I dumb for giving her time when you wont talk to or hang out with me. I miss her a lot and really want to understand if ive done something to hurt her or if she just dosn't like me anymore.

1) use LongFast mode but on a different slot; or
2) use a different mode, with its corresponding preset default slot.

It looks like it's not possible on a single device, without going back & forth to the LORA settings to switch mode or slot every time when wanting to ""switch channels""; or by carrying two devices, one dedicated to each channel. Am I missing something, or do I need to go back to caffeinated coffee ? Tnx.

Another Friday night spent scrolling through a story getting old.
Used to drive for hours, windows down, the world rushing past,
Singing off-key to your favorite song, hoping it would last.
Now the rearview mirror shows a ghost, a flicker in the dark,
And the silence in the passenger seat leaves a hollow mark.

We were a crimson highway, burning bright and fast,
A sunset painted masterpiece, I swore it had to last.
But the lines on the map blurred, the road signs disappeared,
And somewhere in the rearview, the future I had feared.
Now I'm driving solo, headlights cutting through the haze,
Still searching for the sunlight, through these lonely, winding days.

I packed away the photographs, the laughter in the frames,
Each memory a whisper, echoing your name.
Remember that old coffee shop, the one with the worn-out sign?
We’d talk for hours, plans made, intertwining yours and mine.
It felt like fate was written in the steam from our cups,
But maybe some stories are just meant to end abruptly.

We were a crimson highway, burning bright and fast,
A sunset painted masterpiece, I swore it had to last.
But the lines on the map blurred, the road signs disappeared,
And somewhere in the rearview, the future I had feared.
Now I'm driving solo, headlights cutting through the haze,
Still searching for the sunlight, through these lonely, winding days.

And I know it’s cliché, a broken heart in a song,
But this empty space beside me feels impossibly long.
They say time heals everything, but it's a slow and cruel parade,
Still see your shadow dancing in the corners of my shade.
But a new road's opening, faint light on the horizon's edge,
And maybe, just maybe, I’m learning to forgive myself.

No longer a crimson highway, though the embers still remain,
A new sunrise is dawning, washing away the rain.
The lines on the map are clearing, the directions are becoming bold,
A brand new journey starting, a story yet untold.
And I'm driving solo, headlights cutting through the haze,
Finding my own sunlight, through these brighter, hopeful days.

Yeah, finding my own sunlight, leaving crimson highways in the past.",1,1753139121.0,KeepWriting,0,1.0,False
