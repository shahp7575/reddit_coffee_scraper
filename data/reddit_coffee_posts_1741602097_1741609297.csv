I (28nb) go to aqua aerobics every Monday morning and usually wear a standard one-piece swimsuit with an attached skirt for extra coverage.
This week, I had forgotten to wash my swimsuit after swimming on the weekend. 

Instead I wore a bikini top and a pair of mens swim shorts (both in a similar green colour). I have D cups and it is an active class so I did have to secure the goods a few times but there were no misshaps and I made sure not to disturb the class. 

I met up with a friend for coffee afterwards and mentioned the incident, she insists that it was inappropriate for me to wear something so revealing. 

For context: the class is in a local leisure centre pool, there are about 30-40 people in the class, all of whom are female presenting and most are age 50+",1,1741609026.0,AITApod,0,1.0,False

I’d love to meet someone who’s kind, a little nerdy or alternative, and actually serious about finding a real connection.

**About Me:**

*   **Music is a huge part of my life.** I’m big into extreme metal—especially black metal. Cradle of Filth is my favorite band, and I appreciate music with depth, both lyrically and instrumentally.
    
*   **I work in IT.** I have a degree in Computer Science & Information Systems and enjoy what I do. Privacy and security are important to me—I run a Pi-hole and try to keep my digital footprint in check.
    
*   **I’m into gaming, mostly on PC.** I love **challenging and immersive games** like _Dark Souls_, _Resident Evil_, and classic _Tony Hawk_ games. I also enjoy lighter stuff like _Kirby_ and _Mario Party_—gaming should be fun, after all. I play some board games too, but I prefer ones with depth like _HeroQuest_ or _Betrayal at House on the Hill_.
    
*   **I enjoy traditional aesthetics.** Wood, brass, old-school craftsmanship—there’s something timeless about it.
    
*   **Hobbies include:**
    
    *   Camping and enjoying the outdoors
        
    *   Exploring museums and Renaissance faires
        
    *   Watching movies (especially introducing friends to classics)
        
    *   Building Gundam model kits (a newer hobby, but fun)
        
    *   Learning Japanese (こんにちは!)
        

**Personality & Lifestyle:**

I’m laid-back, lighthearted, and always up for a good conversation. I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs (not even coffee), but I’m cool with others drinking around me. I value meaningful discussions, dark humor, and people who think for themselves.

**What I’m Looking For:**

*   **A serious relationship** – I’m not into casual flings; I want to build something real.
    
*   **Someone younger (18-24)** – I’d prefer a partner in this age range for long-term compatibility.
    
*   **A nerdy or alternative side is a plus** – If you’re into gaming, anime, metal, horror, or anything creative, we’ll probably click.
    
*   **Physically, I’m most attracted to East-Asian or white women with an average or slim build.** (Just being honest about preferences.)
    
*   **No tattoos preferred** – Piercings are fine, though.

We have a old car that breaks down every few months and so while we either wait to find someone to fix it or til we have the money to fix it we use uber. Part of our morning routine (a few times a week) is going and getting a coffee. We get picked up either there or at a place near by if we have to get a couple other things.

He immediately tells us to pls not spill our drinks and that he doesn't allow eating/drinking in his car because he recently had a issue where a customer spilled something in his back seat and didn't say anything, he didn't see it until later since he didn't have time to do checks in between rides. Now, i understand no eating.. crumbs and all that can ve very messy even if ur careful. But, i just feel like its not fair to not allow our drinks. With food u can say ""hey, do u mind waiting til ur dropped off to finish eating that?"" They can hold whatever they have and eat at home. But what are we supposed to do with our drinks if he doesn't allow drinks in his car? Like it wouldn't be fair if told that we couldn't bring them in at all, which i felt was being implied for nxt time. Im not tossing a $7 coffee lol. Or having to find abd wait for another Uber? Those would be the choices. I can understand if there was options u could choose, like they do with bigger vehicles or pets or whatever. So if driver doesn't allow food or drinks, that should be in those options. Idk. It rubbed me the wrong way. But, i could be over thinking. But, since we have the same routine almost everyday and have gotten rides from that person before, he should of just passed on us if our drinks, that we always have, was gonna be a issue cuz on the way, i def felt a bit awkward with my drink after they made a thing out of it.

1j7wiu1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppIdeas/comments/1j7wiu1/working_on_a_social_app_for_local_eventswould/,Working on a social app for local events—would love honest feedback,"Hey everyone,

I’ve been working on an idea for a while and wanted to get some real feedback before going too deep into it. It’s a simple concept:

A social app where you can find people nearby for activities—whether it’s grabbing coffee, going for a run, playing sports, or even casual meetups. Instead of just scrolling social media, people can broadcast an event, and those nearby can show interest. The event creator can accept or reject requests, and if accepted, the participants are added to a group chat automatically.

I feel like existing apps (Meetup, Facebook Events) are too rigid or focused on big organized events. This would be more casual, spontaneous, and built around local interactions.

Possible Use Cases:

- New in Town? → Just moved to a city and want to meet people for casual hangouts instead of waiting for months to make friends.

- Gym/Sports Partner → Need a gym buddy or people to play football, badminton, or chess with? Create an event and see who’s interested nearby.

- Weekend Plans → Want to go for a trek, coffee, or a movie but don’t have company? Broadcast it and see who’s up.

- Casual Meetups → Instead of just chatting in online groups, actually meet people with similar interests.

- Hobby Groups → Want to jam with other musicians, go on a photography walk, or do a co-working session?

- College/University Events → Plan impromptu study groups, game nights, or dorm meetups.

- Solo Travelers → Find locals or fellow travelers to explore a city together without awkward DMing strangers.

Would love your thoughts on:

- Do you think people would use something like this?

- What would make it actually valuable vs. just another event app?

- What’s the biggest problem you see with this idea?

I’m open to any brutal feedback—better to hear it now than later. Appreciate any thoughts!

That’s the power of **emotionally engaging writing**—and if your words aren’t making people feel something, they won’t remember them. Whether you're crafting a novel, marketing copy, or a blog post, **emotional connection is the key to impact.**

# 5 Ways to Write Emotionally Engaging Content

1️⃣ **Hook Them Immediately**  
You have *three seconds* to grab attention. Don’t waste them.  
🚫 “Writing is important.”  
✅ “Your words could make someone laugh, cry, or change their life—if you use them right.”

2️⃣ **Use Storytelling (It’s Science)**  
Stories activate our **mirror neurons**, making readers feel like they’re experiencing the event themselves. Research shows storytelling increases retention **22x** more than facts alone. Instead of listing product features, tell a **real transformation story.**

3️⃣ **Create Tension and Release**  
Build anticipation. Make the reader crave the answer.  
📌 Example: *“Sarah’s dream job was slipping away—until she discovered one secret that changed everything.”*  
Now they *have* to know what the secret is.

4️⃣ **Write for the Senses**  
The more senses you engage, the more immersive your writing becomes.  
🚫 “The coffee was hot.”  
✅ “Steam curled into the air as the rich, nutty aroma filled the room.”

5️⃣ **Talk to the Reader**  
Make it personal. Speak directly to *them*.  
🚫 “This guide will help writers.”  
✅ “By the end of this, you’ll know exactly how to make people feel something with your words.”

**Takeaway?** People don’t remember words. They remember how you made them feel.

1j7wevh,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1j7wevh/thinking_about_quitting_but_worried_ill_lose/,"Thinking about quitting, but worried I'll lose focus and creativity","Hi folks,

A few years ago I quit alcohol, and it was the best thing I've ever done in my life (I am definitely an alcohol addict and it was going nowhere good).

I'm reading a great book on the neuroscience of addiction (""Never Enough"" by Judith Grisel), and it's got me thinking about my relationship to caffeine. Additionally, I've noticed that my use of caffeine is starting to follow some of the same patterns as my alcohol use. Now, of course, the negatives of caffeine use are nowhere near the negatives of alcohol use. I'm just saying that I am using caffeine in the same way, i.e., I used to love to drink late at night as a way to stay up and do my hobbies by myself, and increasingly I am finding myself making a cup of coffee at 9pm to do the same thing, even though it fucks with my sleep (I can fall asleep fine, but the quality of sleep is shit).

Anyway, I just figure it's time to go off of caffeine for a while just to see what it's like. I've never been a ""drink it first thing in the morning"" type, so I don't need it to wake up, but I *do* use it heavily as a ritual for my writing. I'm reading a lot about what certain people consider the benefits of caffeine, i.e., the kickoff of the Enlightenment, etc, and I'm worried that perhaps going off of caffeine (once I'm through withdrawals) will mean that I'm not as focused and not as creative. Basically, not as able to get shit done at a high level.

I suppose the only way to know is to go through with this, and I've already decided today that I'm going to begin a taper, so I'm doing this, but can anyone speak to their ability to focus and be creative and motivated off of caffeine?

Alia sat in the room James gave her, staring at the screen that was emulating a window. He had said she could stay as long as she wanted, making it sound like leaving was her choice. She wasn’t sure how true that actually was, but she appreciated him, at least not stating outright she was their prisoner.

Life aboard Albion was quite different than live aboard Alternative Solution. For one, Albion was a lot smaller. It was probably only two or three sizes lager than Tontine was.

For another, there were a lot of people who could claim a genetic connection to Alia, for a given value of Alia. Walking around the ship she saw people with her eyes, with her hair, with her gait, but they weren’t her. It was very odd.

\*\*\*\*

“Odd, how?” James said later, as they ate lunch. He had asked if she wanted to eat with him, and she accepted, not knowing what else to do.

“Even though I was duplicated, and we all trained together, other than a some memories that I still have, I’ve never been around a lot of Alias all at once. Academically I know there are literally tens of thousands of us, but I never really saw more than two others at once. Here, I have only seen Alia T so far, but nearly everyone here has some of my features.”

“Hmm, I suppose I could see that, but look at it from another angle.” James said as he put down his coffee. “If we’re all from an Alia, that makes us all related more or less. Nearly everyone on this ship is one whole family!”

“Maybe,” Alia said, unsure.

“Our next move,” James said “Is for you to challenge Alia Eighty-Seven Sixty-Three and defeat her. Since you have Tartarus, you’ll have an advantage. You’ll be able to move faster and you can speed your perception and be able to follow her moves.”

“I can’t really move faster, James. Tartarus was designed for ship combat. If I move faster than I can, I hurt myself.”

“No pain, no gain, Alia.” James smiled thinly. “Don’t worry, once you win, we’ll bring you back to Medical and fix you up.”

“I didn’t even agree to this, James, why are you having me move so quickly?”

James tilted his head slightly, and stared at Alia. “Because you’re Alia Twenty-Seven, an Original, and we stole you from Eternity? Because they are - probably as we speak - are scouring the galaxy looking for you? Because if you take over and rule Icarus, you can move against Eternity?”

“But,” Alia said, and sighed. “What if I don’t want to rule?”

His laugh was large and sincere. Alia had to admit, it sounded nice, even if he was - at that moment - laughing at her. “An Alia that doesn’t want to rule. Good one!”

“No James, I’m serious. I don’t want to rule.”

The laughter stopped, and James’ eyes widened slightly. “You’re serious? Alia, that’s not an option. You - not your family, not your country, you - have ruled for three millennia. Everyone expects Alia to rule. Everyone knows that Alia rules. You can’t just go “Nah, I don’t want to.” You are Alia. You rule.”

Alia threw up her hands. “You said so yourself! Alias who suffer traumatic damage and are repaired tend to gain compassion.”

“Yes! So that you’re a compassionate ruler. So that you don’t cull your forces when they bring you bad news.” James picked up his coffee cup and seeing it was empty put it back down and stared at her hard for a moment. “You’re serious. You don’t want this.”

“I am serious James, and no, I don’t want this.”

“Well then, what do you want?”

Alia opened her mouth to give a flippant answer and stopped. Ever since Greylock brought her out of hibernation she has been reacting. Things have been happening to her, and she hasn’t had the change to take control. What do I want? She thought.

James saw her expression and stood. “Alia, I think you need to take some time and decide just what your goal is. What success looks like to you.” He patted her shoulder as he walked out. “You are in a unique position - and I don’t just mean the thousands of duplicates.”

\*\*\*\*

Today’s lesson was on the theory and practice of war. Professor Vinland explained that one could spend their whole lifetime studying war and still not be an expert. “While we can spend hours here going over previous battles, and learning about what works and doesn’t, it is an unfortunate truth that one learns best by doing.” He said, as he walked around the front of the auditorium. He was a very active speaker, and the Alia’s were tracking his motion as he walked and gestured like they were watching a tennis match.

After the lesson was lunch, and they all sat together in the canteen, eating their meal bars and chatting.

“What do you think of the lesson today, Thirty-Three?” Fifty said as she tore open the cellophane around her bar.

“I’m tired of lessons, Prof Vinland said that experience is the best teacher, so let’s get some experience!”

“Experience?” Twenty-Seven said, and raised an eyebrow. “You want to start a war?”

“I mean, I don’t not want to start a war,” Thirty-Three said, and shrugged. “We’re the gods damned spear of humanity, it’s time we acted like it.”

“That’s not what that means Thirty-Three,” One Hundred said, and sat down across from them. “We’re not here to take over, we’re here to act as the vanguard of humanity in space, and to make sure we have claimed what we need to grow and thrive.”

“And kick the ass of anyone who we come across,” Thirty-Three said, and gestured with a bar. “If we’re trained to kick ass, and we don’t get to, then that’s a waste of our training. We should be spending the time learning how to, I don’t know, farm or something.”

At the mention of farming, Twenty-Seven perked up. “Did you read the notes from Dr Callum’s lecture? I had no idea that nitrogen was so important, but also so difficult to get into the soil naturally. The Haber-Bosch Process is practically ancient, and yet it’s the easiest way we have to make-”

“Twenty-Seven, for the last time, stop going on about farming!” Thirty-Three said, and rolled her eyes. Both One Hundred and Fifty tittered. “I swear that you care more about plants than guns!”

“We are going to need both to survive out there,” Twenty-Seven said quietly, and looked down at her plate. “I believe we’ll be doing far more farming than fighting, so we had better get good at it.”

“Sometimes, I wonder if we’re actually all duplicates.” Fifty said, and leaned back in her chair, stretching.

“Colonel Matiz mentioned that, remember?” One Hundred said. “We were all identical from the moment we were decanted, From then on, our minds, our thoughts, our lives, our experiences are very slightly different. We were never going to be identical. It stands to reason that some - like Twenty-Seven - might be more interested in the more… domestic parts of colonization.”

“Yes, but then we’re supposed to be synced at the end of training.” Fifty-Five said. “So any differences we have are going to be suppressed. The idea is that we all learn in our own way, but in the end we all have the same knowledge.”

“Knowledge yes, but personalities-”

“One Hundred, stop talking like you’re an expert” Fifty said and crossed her arms. “You’re just guessing. We won’t know exactly what happens until it happens.”

“I wonder how Greylock is faring.” Twenty-Seven said suddenly.

“Pfft, He’s an AI, I’m sure they just trained one of him and then copy-pasted one hundred and thirty two more times.” Thirty-Three said. “They probably won’t even get him set up until we’re all on ice.”

“I thought we were getting put in hibernation as our ships were ready?”

“Why do you even care, Twenty-Seven? Your ship will be done at the same time as Eleven’s. You won’t even have to wait.” Fifty said, sullenly.

“Do I detect a hint of jealousy, Fifty?” Twenty-Seven said perking up and grinningly slyly. “Feeling sore that you didn’t get picked first?”

“I’m the best one here!” Fifty blurted out. “I should be first, not mid-pack. Randomly picking the order is stupid. It should be merit based.”

“It’s only stupid because you don’t get to go first.” Twenty-Seven said, as One Hundred nodded once. “You’ll get your turn, just like all of us.”

“You’ll be down on your little planet somewhere farming dirt or something, while I’ll be up kicking alien asses.” Fifty said and stood abruptly. “I’m going to the gym. We have twenty more minutes until our next class. I need to get rid of all this energy.”

As she walked away, One Hundred turned to Twenty-Seven. “Don’t worry about her. You’ll be on your planet setting up a life for your Companions and being a bulwark against the unknown by the time she even gets her ship,” and winked at Twenty-Seven.

\*\*\*\*

Alia laid in bed, staring up at the ceiling. She had no idea what time it was, and at this point she didn’t really care. She had spent the time she wasn’t dreaming about her training back on Earth turning over what James had asked her. What did she want? She’s been spending so much time running, so much time confused, so much time just staying alive, she hasn’t had much time to think about it, but he was right. It wouldn’t be like this forever, and Alia needed to start to work towards her goals.

Sitting up, she surveyed the dimly lit room. Her eyes had adjusted to the darkness, allowing her to perceive most objects in the grainy, black-and-white vision of night vision. She then noticed the clothes she had carelessly tossed over the back of a chair. Clothes Eternity gave her. It would be so easy to go back and be Eternity. She could get her ship, go around the galaxy, and just… be. She’s Alia Godsdamned Maplebrook. This world was tailor made to let her do whatever she wanted. But, that wasn’t enough. Alia thought back to her training and remembered the farming lessons. The idea of being able to be on a planet, making things grow, helping a community appealed to her. But now? Now that she was one of potentially tens of thousands of duplicates all with her face ruling the galaxy through two - or more! - factions, all lead by her? Those dreams of a little farm seemed forever away.

So then what? Maybe she couldn’t have a little farm, but she could help others be able to have small, meaningful lives, without Alia looming over them.

She got out of bed, and put her Eternity outfit back on.

That morning, she entered the canteen, where the enticing aroma of breakfast filled the air. People sat at tables, engrossed in conversations about their upcoming day. As she made her way in, the conversation abruptly ceased as they caught sight of her attire. James was in the corner, and the moment he laid eyes on her, he rose to his feet and offered a warm smile. “So, you know what you want then?”

Alia nodded once. “I do. Where’s Alia T and Eighty-Seven Sixty-Three?”

“They’re up in Command, waiting for you.”

“Waiting?”

“Yes, I, er, might have told them that I asked you specifically what you wanted to do with your life, and they are… curious to find out.”

Alia glanced down at her outfit, wishing for the first time it was armored. Her eyes flicked to the cutlery rolled up in a pile on the table next to her. “James…” Alia said, trying affect a joviality she did not feel, “Are they going to try and kill me?”

James made that same brushing gesture that she saw Eternity and Viv make, it must be nearly universal. “No, they won’t. You’re Alia Twenty-Seven after all.”

Skipping breakfast - Alia was too nervous to eat - James brought her up to command. It was in the very front of the ship, and Alia could believe that the screens in the front of the room were actually windows, even though she was pretty sure they weren’t. Sitting in an ornate chair in the center rear of the room was Alia.

Or rather, almost Alia. Her face was very slightly different, and her hair was more blonde than Twenty-Seven’s. When she stood, Alia noticed she was also a few centimeters shorter. “We finally meet, Alia Maplebrook Twenty-Seven. I must admit, I did not know what to expect when James told me that you were an origin-”

Before she could complete the sentence, Alia’s perception sped up. Eighty-Seven Sixty-Three had not even stopped talking, and Alia had a moment of crystal clarity; noticing how slowly her mouth was moving. Leaping forward, she ignored the chorus of pain from her limbs; there was only once chance for this to work. Gripping the knife she palmed from the canteen, she rammed it into Eighty-Seven Sixty-Three’s neck, completely overestimating how fast she was moving, and how hard she was hitting. The effect was… memorable. Alias knife, along with her fist, swept across her neck, removing a large chunk of it. Alia suppressed her surprise and turned towards Alia T.

At this point, Alia T had begun to turn and run away, finally understanding what Twenty-Seven was doing. Alia reached out with her other hand, and taking hold of Alia T’s leg as it came up and flung her across the room. Remembering what happened with the assassin, Alia then willed her perception back to normal. She felt a little woozy, but was otherwise all right.

Maybe two seconds had elapsed.

Alia strode over to Alia T. She was laying on the ground, her right leg at an unnatural angle. Breathing heavily, she looked up at Alia with an odd expression. Pride?

“I knew you had it in you.” Alia T said quietly, and coughed. “You are an Original. You are destined to rule.”

Alia bent down low to Alia T. “I do not want to rule.” She hissed. “But, in order to get what I do want. I will need to rule. You will not get what you want, we will get what I want, because I am Alia Maplebrook Twenty-Seven. Because you are James’ mother, and I will need him, you may live. If I even suspect you of subterfuge, you will not have time to realize you are dead. Am I understood?”

Alia T nodded, and she winced at the pain. Alia straightened and pointed at a random person in the room. “Get Alia Tennigan to medical, her leg is broken.”

The person, eyes wide with terror, clicked their heels once and ran over to Alia T. Alia walked over to the command chair - Eighty-Seven Sixty-Three crumpled unnaturally on the floor next to it - and sat down. “Contact Eternity.” She said to the room. “I have things I need to *discuss* with her.”",8,1741606025.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

# 

#  

# We were woken up at 4:30am, by the sirens blaring their mournful sound over the base.

#  

# I leapt out of bed and quickly turned my TV on, the broadcaster's solemn face filled the screen, he said, “Russia has launched long-range inter-continental ballistic missiles at the UK.

#  

# Please take shelter in your nearest nuclear bunker immediately. This is not a drill. Repeat, this is not a drill.”

#  

# I ran from the house, looking up at the night sky, fearful of incoming missiles, but the night was still and quiet.

#  

# For weeks, the rumbles of wars had been echoing around the world, various governments had been shouting about transgressions, real and imagined, committed by other countries.

#  

# Tensions had been rising, there had been several border insurgences between India and Pakistan, along their shared border high in the mountains.

#  

# America had warned Russia about a supposed build-up of troops along the former East-West border in Germany. 

#  

# Everybody had been stockpiling supplies for weeks, as a senior systems analyst for the government, I was guaranteed a place in the bunker, it was at this moment, I was glad that I was still single, with no dependents.

#  

# I was an only child; both of my parents had died in a car crash while I was still at university, so, I was alone in the world.

#  

# I made my way to the bunker, the guard at the gate, checked my ID pass and let me into the base.

#  

# I walked through the heavy, steel and concrete blast doors, each door weighed roughly ten tons, and had to be opened by hydraulic rams to allow the entrance of lorries etc.

#  

# Pedestrian access was through a smaller door to the left of the main door. The bunker had been carved out of the side of Ben Nevis.

#  

# The smaller door resembled a bank vault door, roughly eighteen inches thick, with locking bolts as thick as my arm. 

#  

# After I entered, the door closed behind me with a hiss of pressurised air, I swallowed a couple of times to equalise the pressure in my ears.

#  

# I walked across the hall and entered the lift, it automatically began to descend, in a few seconds, the lift slowed, and the door opened.

#  

# I stepped out into a sterile, white clad corridor, which stretched out into the distance either side of the lift.

#  

# I knew that my living quarters were located to the left of the lift, and the main heart of the complex was to the right. 

#  

# I made my way to my office, and switched on my computer, the screen lit up with notifications about missiles incoming and ones that we had fired at Russia.

#  

# I sat up all night, my face lit by the glow of the computer screen, drinking coffee from the canteen. 

#  

# From the surrounding offices, I could hear muffled snippets of conversations, listing various cities that had stopped broadcasting, seemingly destroyed.

#  

# As we were about two hundred metres below ground, we couldn’t feel any vibrations of exploding missiles, so we had to rely on satellites images.

#  

# After a few days, we could no longer see any images from the satellites, due to the smoke and debris caused by the missile strikes.

#  

# Our external detectors were monitoring levels of radiation, all of them were showing extremely high levels of radiation, dangerous to life high. 

#  

# So, all we could do, was resign ourselves to life underground for at least the next ten years.

#  

# Life settled into a boring, repetitive cycle of days filled with manning the radios, trying to raise other survivors, tending to the hydroponic gardens that were producing fresh vegetables for us. 

#  

# There were three hundred and fifty of us sealed in this tomb, 200 feet below Scotland. 

#  

# The males outnumbered the females by roughly two to one. This led to some tensions, especially when two men liked the same woman. 

#  

# Over time, the order in the bunker became fractured, the days slowly turned into weeks, into months and then into a year.

#  

# During our time underground, a few people couldn’t cope and committed suicide, their bodies were moved into the lowest level of the complex and into the incinerator.

#  

# Life dragged on, day followed weary day, we were just trying to fill up our time with busy work, nothing really mattered anymore. 

#  

# The same hierarchy stayed in place, the chiefs who were in charge before the bombs fell, were still in charge now, but things weren’t the same.

#  

# There was a coup, some people disagreed with how things were being run, here in the bunker. 

#  

# One night, the bunker’s armoury was raided, and handguns and ammunition were taken, the two guards on in the armoury were killed in the raid.

#  

# The following day, there were gunfights along some of the lower corridors. It sounded like a warzone, there were bodies strewn along the corridors and rooms.

#  

# By the time that peace was restored, 28 people had killed, 57 had been injured, 31 of whom would succumb to their injuries within 36 hours.

#  

# Peace was restored, but it was a fragile peace, the armoury was placed under heavy guard, 4 people on duty at all times, with orders to shoot if unauthorized people approached.

#  

# Time slowly dragged on, soon, we had spent five years below ground. A meeting was held, to try and ascertain if it would be safe to venture above ground.

#  

# It was agreed to send a small party up to monitor the situation. But the lifts to the surface had been damaged during the attempted coup.

#  

# So, a small group was sent up the emergency stairs, this was no easy task, they faced a climb of roughly 1,000 steps.

#  

# The climb itself was a daunting prospect, but the team would have to wear full protective suits, complete with breathing apparatus, while carrying Gaiger counters to check the radiation levels.

#  

# The team was selected, John Jones was in charge, I was among them, our suits were checked and double checked.

#  

# Finally, our group of six approached the door leading to the emergency stairs. We check the Gaiger counters, all read normal levels.

#  

# We started to climb, soon, we were drenched with sweat, our breath coming in gasps, still the Gaiger counters read normal levels.

#  

# Eventually, we reached the surface, to our surprise, the Gaiger counter was still reading normal levels.  

#  

# We radioed back down to the waiting staff at the bottom level of the bunker and reported our findings. 

#  

# After a brief discussion, it was decided that we would try and open the smaller door.

#  

# We approached the door, and after taking a deep breath, we unlocked the door, it creaked open and we stepped out.

#  

# We were greeted by the sound of birds, we stood and looked around, we were shocked to see that everything looked, normal.

#  

# Instead of shattered buildings and burnt and destroyed landscape, everything was the same as it was before we descended into the bunker.

#  

# The Gaiger counter was still reading normal, we held a quick discussion among ourselves, it was decided that we would remove our helmets.

#  

# I unclipped my helmet and took my first breath of fresh air since entering the bunker.

#  

# The air tasted fresh and clean, it was intoxicating, I looked around everything looked the same as it was when I entered the bunker.

#  

# What the hell was going on.? We had locked ourselves in the bunker because of the bombs falling, but there was no damage anywhere.

#  

# The buildings of the army base we were on, stood undamaged and silent. Then there was the sound of engines.

#  

# We turned as one, toward the sound of the approaching engines, from around the corner of a building, came two land rovers and three Olive green army 4 tonne lorries.

#  

# The vehicles came to a halt, from the 4 tonne lorries, a troop of armed soldiers dismounted and formed a protective ring around our group. 

#  

# Three men climbed out of the land rovers and approached the group from the bunker.

#  

# One of the men spoke, he said, “Good afternoon gentlemen, it is so nice to meet you at long last, I’ve seen a lot of you of course, but it is nice to meet you in the flesh.”

#  

# John Jones said, “What the hell is going on.? We have been locked in that bloody bunker for five bloody years, 

#  

# We finally decide to check what the situation is on the surface and find that you lot driving around like nothing has happened.” 

#  

# The man who had spoken, spoke again, 

#  

# “Ah yes, sorry about that, I think we need to get the rest of the people up from the bunker.”

#  

# John said, “that is going to be difficult, the lift is broken, it was damaged during the attempted coup.”  

#  

# The other man spoke into a radio, and another lorry arrived, and a team of men entered the top of the bunker.

#  

# Within fifteen minutes, our people from the bunker started filing out of the doors of the bunker.

#  

# They stood in a confused group, blinking at the light, staring in disbelief at the untouched buildings and the group of men standing casually, dressed in light summer clothes, not dressed in nuclear protective clothing. 

#  

# John Jones asked, “what the bloody hell is going on.? We went into the bunker, because we were told that there was a nuclear war starting with Russia. 

#  

# We spent five years underground, then come out to find that nothing has changed, no bomb damage, no radiation, nothing.”

#  

# The leader of the new group cleared his throat and said, “well, you were told that there was a nuclear war coming, and that you had to go into the bunker. 

#  

# In fact, you were all part of an experiment to see how people behave under extreme stress.”

#  

# There were gasps from the group that had been in the bunker, then voices shouted, “so, we were just rats in a trap, just so we could be observed, to see how we would behave.?”

#  

# John Jones asked, “why didn’t you intervene when there was the coup, or the suicides.?”

#  

# The reply shocked all of us, “we couldn’t step in, it would have changed the results of the experiment.”

#  

# Our group erupted in fury, “so, we were all just lab rats, to see how we would react, you bastards.”

#  

# Everything we had seen on the screens, was fake, CGI made by various film groups, so realistic that we were fooled by it. 

#  

# The repercussions of this “experiment” were far reaching, several high-ranking politicians were forced to resign. 

#  

# Apparently, the justification of misleading us into believing that a nuclear war had erupted, was to make it more believable. 

#  

# If we had known that it was an experiment to test how people cope with stress and isolation in an inescapable situation, the results would have been skewed. 

#  

# It took a long time to reassimilate into life above ground. The government were forced to make hefty payouts to all of us, this included large payouts to the families of those who had died in the bunker.

Nick sat on the couch, staring at nothing. Eastern had gotten up and was talking with Rach now. He wondered just what she had to teach them. Nick’s implants would gain him access to most of the systems on Hyacinth, and given that Raaden is the President and CEO of Houndstooth, it should be relatively easy to get her schedule. Then it was just a matter of being in the right place at the right time.

As he ruminated, Sel came into the room and gestured with her head. “Come on Nick, we’re going for a walk.”

Outside of the apartment, Selkirk picked a direction and they started walking. They weren’t hurrying, but she walked with purpose. After a few minutes, they reached a square that looked like it was made for locals. Instead of trinket shops and people hawking tours, it had small restaurants, a grocer, and even a laundromat. Nick spied a coffee cart, and went over. The vendor was nearly the tallest person Nick had ever seen, and her cart seemed oversized to match her frame. She wore a low cut shirt - probably to help with tips - and smiled warmly at him.

“It’s not every day you see a new face down here!” She said, cheerfully. “What are you doing so far away from the tourist traps?”

“Oh.” Nick said, startled at the real conversation. “We’re just in town seeing an old friend. We’ll probably be around another day and then move along.”

“That’s too bad.” She said “If we got more new faces that looked as handsome as yours things would be so much brighter.”

Nick could feel Selkirk bristle at the flirting. “Can I get a flat white please?” He said.

“Sure thing hon, what kind of dairy?”

Nick rolled the dice. “Do you have cow?”

She shook her had sadly. “Not in Kepler. We lost all our milkers to the Bovine flu about fifteen years back. Every few years they try and reintroduce them, but they never make it.  I can give you soy, almond, or oat milk.”

“Oat then.” Nick said. It gave the closest mouth feel to cow milk when steamed. As she turned to bustle in the cart, Selkirk jabbed him in the side. “You already have two girlfriends Nick, why are you trying for a third?”

“She’s just flirting to get a better tip.” Nick whispered. “That’s why she’s wearing that low cut shirt too.”

“And that works on humans?” Selkirk sounded skeptical.

“Almost always. People of all shapes think with the wrong organ.”

She placed the coffee and a tea on the counter and winked at Sel. “Thought you might want something too since your boyfriend here didn’t see fit to ask if you wanted anything.”

Selkirk’s fur rippled a blush and she took the tea. “Thanks.” She mumbled. Nick grinned and paid for the drinks - and added a tip.

“So, humans are the ones thinking with the wrong organ?” Nick said wryly as they walked away.

“She has gorgeous eyes, that’s all.” Selkirk said and sipped her tea. It was chamomile. “Anyway, getting a tea and ogling the coffee seller wasn’t why I brought you out here Nick.”

“I figured it wasn’t just to see the sights of a slightly rundown part of Kepler dome Sel, what’s up?” As they walked along, Nick noticed how the neighborhood smelled. There was the smell of food being cooked from the many small restaurants, the scent of clean laundry from the laundromat, and flowers on the air from a nearby park maybe. Under all of that was the gunpowder smell that was ever present on Luna, but after a day, Nick had stopped noticing it.

“It’s Eastern.” Sel said and came to a bench in a little park. There was some playground equipment for the local kids, a few spindly trees, some flowers, and a few raised beds for a community garden. They sat in front of the garden. “Have you noticed how she’s… changing?”

Nick took a sip of coffee so he could have a moment to think. She had been changing lately, but when they’re together, it seems fine. Eastern seems like she has a plan and is executing it, and it feels like she has their best interested in mind, but now as he’s thinking back on it? “Something is wrong.” He finally said.

“Yes. I wonder if it’s because I’m K’laxi or if the Nanites don’t care or whatever, but it feels like Eastern has some kind of ‘everything is going to be fine’ field around her. When we’re close to her, we don’t mind what she’s doing. Now that we’re a kilometer away? How do you feel about what she’s doing?”

“I don’t… like it.” Nick found it hard to admit. He loved Eastern. He loved Selkirk. He wanted them both to be happy. He was noticing how Selkirk didn’t like what Eastern was doing, but when they were all together, it didn’t seem like that big of a deal. Now though? “I’m worried Sel.”

“I am too, Nick.” Selkirk sipped her tea again. “We shouldn’t have come here. We should have just gone from Tink’s ship to a transport and gone straight to Hyacinth. What does Eastern even need from this Rachel person anyway?”

“Eastern and Rachel used to be an item.” Nick said.

“That much was clear when I saw how she looked at her.” Selkirk said and her tail swished irritatedly “But, there’s more to this, isn’t there?”

Nick shrugged. “Probably. She said that she wanted her expertise in assassination, but I’m not sure how she can help us. I’m pretty sure I can track her down on Hyacinth with my implants, and-” He looked down at Sel -“I’m pretty sure you have killed more people than I care to know about, so I’m confident you can do the job.”

Selkirk grunted at the insinuation. “You’re not… wrong, Nick, but I don’t like that part of me. Killing someone is not anything to brag about.” She tossed back the rest of the tea and crumpled the paper cup. “I think the Nanites are manipulating our opinion of Eastern when we’re near her.”

“Even if that is true, what can we do about it? We probably have as many Nanites as she does. She’s said that they’re transferred via physical contact, and it’s not like we’ve been chaste.”

“I don’t know.” Sel said as her ears drooped. “But, I think we need to keep what is going on in the forefront of our minds. As she starts to do more and more things we don’t agree with, we have to remember that we don’t agree, and try and talk her out of it. I don’t want to lose her, but-” Sel sighed. “-I worry we might already have.”

He put his arms around Selkirk and brought her close. She leaned into the hug and put her head under his arm. “I don’t think things are all that bad… yet.” He said. “We have Tink with us too. He’ll be able to point out it things get really weird.”

“Okay Nick, but I’m going to need your support if- when we have to confront Eastern about it. She’s going to listen to them more and more. That she voiced that bartender and Rachel to get what she wanted worries me. She’s just going to start Voicing people. What if she Voices us?”

“She won’t do that.” Nick said and stroked the spot between her ears. “She cares for us too much.” He stood. “Come on Sel. We might as well walk around more. I think Eastern and Rachel are going to be busy all morning.”

“Busy.. or busy.” Selkirk said.

“We trust Eastern.” Nick said, firmly. “She said it was over, and I believe her.”

\*\*\*\*

Eastern laid on the bed, staring while Rach paced back and forth in the small room. “Rach, you’re going to wear a hole in the carpet, what’s wrong?”

“It’s nothing Eas, I’m just trying to figure out how the hell you’re going to get Helen Raaden. Her body guards have body guards! You’re either going to have to have the best information possible or be the luckiest person in the galaxy!”

“Well, that’s why I came to see you Rach. You know what to do.” Eastern sat up, her head following Rachel as she paced.

“It’s more than that, Eas. If - on the off chance - you do find her, what then? Do you have a gun? They’re hard enough to get here on Luna, I hear it’s even tougher on Hyacinth.” She stopped pacing. “That’s the other thing. Say you do find her, and you somehow manage to shoot her dead. Then what? You’re going to have just about everyone on Hyacinth and beyond going after you. It’s not like you’re trying to take out some nobody, Eas.”

“Leave that part to me, Rach,” Eastern said around a yawn. “Just help me figure out how to get to her.”

“Eastern Standard, that’s only a third of the job!” Rach said, exasperated. “If I help you to get her, but not how to do anything else, I’m sending you and your friends to your death.”

I̸t̴ ̵w̴i̷l̵l̴ ̸b̷e̷ ̶f̸i̸n̵e̶.̵ Eastern said quickly “Just tell me how to find her.”

“For starters, you’re going to need to get into Houndstooth’s network. You need to find her schedule. She’s the CEO, it won’t be private, but it probably will be pretty deep inside. Best bet would be to find an org chart and see who her EAs are.”

“EA?”

“Executive Assistant. Ancestors Eas, have you ever worked an office job?”

“You know I haven’t Rach.” Eastern said, smiling. “I’ve always been no good.”

Rach rolled her eyes. “Get into the network, find her EAs; they’ll have her schedule and itinerary. From there you’ll have to pick your time. Best options will probably be when she’s transitioning from one thing to another.”

“You mean like when she’s moving from one meeting to another?”

“No, bigger than that.” Rach shook her head. “You need to get her when she’s getting ready to go somewhere. She’ll have to take a Hopper, and to do that she’ll have to leave the building. That’s your best bet.”

“Brillant Rach! Thanks for the help.”

“It won’t do any good though, you don’t have a way to get into Houndstooth systems. Do you even know a hacker like that?”

Eastern grinned slyly. “I might know a person or two.”

\*\*\*\*

Nick and Selkirk walked back into the apartment a bit later. They found Rachel and Eastern in the kitchenette drinking instant coffee. Eastern looked up as they walked in, stood and ran over to them, embracing them both. “Where did you two go?”

“Went to get Nick a coffee.” Selkirk said and sniffed the air and made a face. “Smells like you two are making do with instant.”

“It’s fine.” Eastern said. “We can head out soon. I know what we need to do, thanks to Rachel.”

Nick looked around the apartment. It was three rooms, so it didn’t take long. “Eastern, where’s Tink?”

“Oh, he said he was going to go out and explore Kepler some. He wanted to see things ‘from a new perspective.’”

“Did he take a comm? How are we going to reach him? We should start booking passage now; there’s no reason to stay here.”

As he was saying that, Nick felt an odd tingle at the base of his neck. His implants were trying to get his attention. He focused inward and saw that he had received a message.

“Nicholas North. I do believe it is time for us to meet in person. That is, if you ever want to see Tinker Toy again. Come to the attached coordinates with Eastern and Selkirk. Any attempt to flee will result in Tinker Toy’s destruction, and should you leave Luna, I will attack your transportation. All their lives will be on your heads.” Nick replayed the message twice to see if he could learn anything new, but its origin was cloaked behind at least a dozen relays. He couldn’t even tell if it originated on Luna, even though it must have.

“Nick? What’s wrong?” Sel said, touching his arm gently. “You look like you just learned someone died.

“It’s Kindness.” Nick said, his voice hollow. “They have Tink.”",2,1741605757.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I dont really have a lot of things to be mad about, as it just can happen randomly, the loss of feelings.

1j7walp,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallscalefantasy/comments/1j7walp/my_smallscale_fantasy/,My Small-Scale Fantasy,"So, in 2022 I gave up Twitter, seeing the direction it was inevitably heading (from ""dumpster fire"" to ""radioactive septic tank, yet still on fire"") and decided to use the energy I put into snark tweeting 2 hours a day into something more positive and life-affirming.  I finally wrote that novel I promised myself since I was twelve. 

What I ended up creating was a low-stakes, small-scale, cozy-adjacent, slice-of-life, western-style Isekai fantasy novel that now fits on the proverbial fantasy shelves as well as an oversized coffee-table book. 

The stakes are low, but only in the grand sense that they have no impact on the fate of the world, but they are critically important to our characters.  The scale is small in that it takes place entirely within a small village and surrounding farms, but that village is part of a much larger world that still exists and exerts in influence on the story, even if it's not the focus.  It's cozy-adjacent with food porn and nostalgia, but also prickly characters, hard emotions and uncomfortable situations.  It's isekai without the power-fantasy tropes or shoehorned ""game mechanics"" making it closer to ""Quantum Leap"" than ""That Time I got Reincarnated as a Level 999 S-Rank Demon Lord with his own Harem, but I still can't talk to girls with getting tongue-tied!!?!?!""  

Anyway, here's the official blurb:

***Two Worlds, One Family***

Many adolescents feel like their siblings come from another planet.  For twelve-year-old Rivalo, it’s true.

While recovering from a serious illness, Rivalo’s older sister suddenly confides to him that she is from another world, one very different from his own.  Will the shy, bookish boy be able to assist his outspoken new friend adapt to her surroundings while also investigating what happened to his missing sister?  More importantly, will he be able to help both find their way home?

***Tales of a Stranger Sister*** is a low-stakes slice-of-life fantasy novel inspired by classic portal fantasy, isekai light novels, and the films of Studio Ghibli.  Centered on friendship, family, and community, and set against a backdrop of serene forests, sprawling mountain farms, and jubilant festivals, it is the story of a young man learning that the most powerful force in any world isn’t magic, empires, or even the gods.  

It’s kindness.

Tales of a Stranger Sister is available as a Kindle eBook for $2.99 USD and in Paperback for $11.99 USD.  It is also available on Kindle Unlimited. (And if you're boycotting Amazon right now, I get it.  I'm not gonna ask anyone to go against something they believe in purely for my benefit.  I made choices based on what I thought was the best model to distribute this story and I may eventually change that in the future, but not right now.) 

Anyway, I won't post the amazon link here, but rather the link to my author's webpage where there are links to buy/read it if you think it might be something you'd enjoy, along with my new blog:

I am ‘26F’and have been in a on again off again relationship with my now ‘28M’bf. Off again purely because of me every time. Constantly I’m on TikTok and all I see are women talking about previous relationships or relationships they’re in now where their man does not appreciate them or understand their worth so they are on this journey to “never let a man treat me like that again” or “I will meet a man one day that will prove my worth” but where are the women who HAVE FOUND a perfect guy but for some reason just can’t see a future with him? Doesn’t feel complete? Just can’t get on the same page. My current bf is there for me at any given moment in time. He listens to me. He takes interest in my interests. He buys me things he sees in passing that he thinks I’d like. He buys me flowers constantly. As soon as they die, hes buying me more. Coffee and food brought to me on the regular. I could go on and on about how this man is the man that ALL these women dream of yet I don’t want to be with him. Through the 5 years I have broken things off with him for this exact reason. I’ve told him that I don’t know if I see a future with him, that I’m tired of feeling guilty because he’s so good to me and I’m just blah. That I think I just want to be alone. He leaves broken hearted which pains me each time, but eventually he’s able to slither right back into my life with little to no push back from me because I’m so comfortable with him. Truly my best friend. But it’s been 5 years and Jesus that’s a long time. How long am I going to waste his time? I’ve hoped and hoped that one day it would just hit me that I love this man and we can live happily ever after together, but it never comes.. I can’t keep doing this to him, he doesn’t deserve it, but do I deserve it either? Do I deserve to keep letting him back in my life because of the guilt and this pressure of I HAVE to be with this man because he’s perfect and there’s no other reason why I shouldn’t scoop him up forever? Why am I like this? Why don’t I want to spend my life with him? Is this just me being bored because it’s been so long and I feel like I need something new and shiny? Should I feel this guilty? I feel like I’ve wasted so much of his time and the guilt has ate at me for so long now. Please is there ANYONE who has been in this situation before?

TL;DR: I’m wanting to break up with my bf even though he’s the perfect guy. Why can’t I love him back? Should I feel guilty about this? ",1,1741605193.0,u_FrequentApple9010,1,1.0,False

Preferred drink types: Espresso & Americanos

Drink frequency: 2 back-to-back first thing in the morning and sporadically through the day and evening.

Space: no significant limitations

Experience level: 2 years of using Sage Bambino Plus

Manual or electric: open

Candidates: Profitec MOVE is currently the leading candidate

Grinder: Eureka Mignon Specialita

 

I am upgrading from my Sage Bambino Plus after two years of use. It has started to leak just withing its warranty and I have decided its time to sell the refurbished or replacement when it’s returned and upgrade.

 

My personal criteria are:

**Fast heat up time** – I know I will not get the 3 second heat up time my SBP provides but I feel a heat up time of over 10 minutes would be an issue as my use though the day is irregular and I do not want there to be a 15/30 minute gap from wanting coffee, to having coffee.

**Consistency** – I want the shots to be as consistent as possible. I weigh my beans in and out, spray to reduce static, use a distribution tool, purge my machine etc. and still find shots wildly variable with my SBP. I am tempted by a dual boiler machine as I understand a dedicated boiler will provide more consistency and hope to address the heat up time by choosing one where the steam boiler can my set to stay off on heat up.

**Longevity –** if I am dropping up to 2k on a machine I want it to last as long as possible so a well built machine from a reputable company who will not go bust in 2 years is a must

**Control –** as we all know home espresso is a hobby. I enjoy watching the videos, reading posts and would like the ability to play with temperature, pre-infusion etc.and continue my journey.

 

As I’ve said above the Profitec MOVE is currently leading the way in my thoughts but machines such as the Lelit Elizabeth V3, Rancilio Silvia PRO X, or the Ascaso Steel Duo are options I have looked at.

 

Any recommendations, advice, or other factors I should consider would be greatly appreciated.

Hello everyone,

I have a question specifically for profitable retail traders:

What do you do besides your charting, fundamental analysis, and backtesting? Do you pursue certain hobbies, attend meet-ups, or maintain other types of connections?

The reason behind my question is that I'm currently exploring the idea of establishing an exclusive club or bar as a meeting place for traders in the German-speaking community, to facilitate personal interactions and genuine exchange. In my experience, existing events often turn into promotional or MLM meetings rather than authentic networking opportunities. Personally, I prefer having meaningful discussions in a relaxed environment over coffee rather than online interactions, as it allows for deeper connections.

Would you be interested in something like this, or do you already have experience or suggestions regarding trader meet-ups?

I'm looking forward to your thoughts, experiences, and recommendations!

Best regards from Switzerland



**Deutsch:**

Hallo zusammen,

ich richte mich heute speziell an profitable Retailtrader mit einer Frage zum persönlichen Austausch:

Was macht ihr neben Chartanalysen, Fundamentalanalysen und Backtesting? Welche Hobbys verfolgt ihr, nehmt ihr an Meet-ups teil oder seid ihr anderweitig gut vernetzt?

Hintergrund meiner Frage: Ich spiele aktuell mit dem Gedanken, im deutschsprachigen Raum einen exklusiven Club oder eine Bar als Treffpunkt für Trader zu eröffnen, um einen realen Austausch in angenehmer Atmosphäre zu ermöglichen. Meine bisherigen Erfahrungen zeigen, dass viele Veranstaltungen eher auf Investment-Vertrieb oder MLM fokussiert sind und weniger den echten Austausch fördern. Ich persönlich ziehe es vor, Fachgespräche und Networking in einer entspannten Umgebung bei einem Kaffee zu führen, da dies oftmals tiefergehende Verbindungen ermöglicht als rein online.

Habt ihr Interesse an so etwas oder bereits Erfahrungen damit gemacht? Ich freue mich sehr über eure Meinungen, Erfahrungen und Empfehlungen!

I’m the kind of person who apologizes to inanimate objects, so when my old disposal croaked, I mourned then panic-bought this thing to fill the void.

So, here's my thoughts on the InSinkErator Evolution garbage disposal.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Update:

**BEST PRICE on the InSinkErator Evolution here:**

[**https://amzn.to/43y8eqt**](https://amzn.to/43y8eqt)

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

It’s sleek, it’s gray, it’s got this I’m too good for you vibe that makes me question why I’m still wearing sweatpants from 2017.

This thing’s compact, but it’s got presence. At 12.25 inches tall and 8.25 inches wide, it’s not some hulking beast that’ll crowd out my under-sink stash of half-used cleaning supplies, which is something I appreciate.

Function wise, I was hoping this thing would be my kitchen’s equivalent of a personal trainer - tough, efficient, and not judging me for the sheer volume of chicken bones I apparently generate.

But overall, I'd say It delivers. It's quiet, calm, collected. My old unit sounded like a lawnmower choking on a sock. this one’s more like a polite whisper from a librarian who secretly hates you.

# My Favorite Features

**3-stage multigrind technology.** it’s got three layers of grinding action, I tested it with a chicken bone, and it turned that sucker into dust finer than my hopes of ever fitting into skinny jeans again. 

**3/4 hp dura-drive induction motor.**  ¾ horsepower means it’s got  torque that laughs at tough scraps.

**quiet soundseal technology.** I can grind away while on a call and not have to mute myself. 

**ez connect installation.** the ez grip handles and lift and latch system mean it's pretty simple to install. My partner swapped out my old unit in two hours, including a Home Depot run for the cord they forgot to include. 

**compact design.** at 12.25 inches tall, it’s not too big. my under-sink area’s a graveyard of sponges and dreams, but this fits pretty well. the flat side keeps the drain outlet aligned with my ancient plumbing, and it leaves room for my instant hot water dispenser, which I use to pretend I’m a fancy coffee shop barista.

**stainless steel grind components.** rust is the enemy, and this thing’s armed to the teeth with stainless steel. it’s a small detail that means I won’t be replacing it anytime soon.



# Pros

* **quiet operation.** I didn’t realize how much I hated my old disposal’s scream until this one showed up. the soundseal tech makes it quiet.

* **clog protection.** that 3-stage multigrind is shredding everything into fine bits. I used to dread the inevitable glug glug of a clogged drain, usually followed by me googling ""plumber near me"". now, I toss in fibrous nonsense like celery or pineapple tops, and it’s gone. it’s freed up mental space I didn’t know I was wasting on sink anxiety.

* **power.** ¾ hp doesn’t sound like much, but it’s handled everything so far.

* **easy installation.** the lift and latch system and ez grip handles meant I didn’t cause too many installation headaches. 

* **saves space.** the design is pretty compact. I don’t have to sacrifice my instant hot water dispenser to accommodate it. suddenly, I’m organized-adjacent, and I didn’t even have to try.



# Cons

The power cord being sold separately is a total buzzkill. i get it, some people hardwire, but still annoying. Also, it’s not silent, if you’re expecting zero noise, you’ll still hear a polite hum that might bother you, but it's nothing like my old one.

# Overall...

If you're generating food scraps often, like think chicken bones, veggie peels, or that questionable mango pit you forgot about, this is a good buy. 

If you’re semi-handy and want an install that won’t make you want to throw it out the window, this also works. 

Is it worth getting? Yeah I'd say so. For me, it’s a win. My kitchen’s less of a disaster zone, and I’m not googling ""how to unclog a drain"" every other week.

1j7vyk2,https://thelensnola.org/2025/03/09/all-in-a-carnivals-pay/,"All in a Carnival’s Pay - Rex announced that it would pay the bands booked for its parade, raising questions about the history of band payments from krewes – and why those payments matter.","High winds on Mardi Gras Day truncated Rex’s route and kept Zulu from downtown New Orleans, taking a toll on business owners and on local school bands, which went unpaid for Zulu and other weather-affected parades. Then Rex announced that it would pay the bands booked for its parade, raising questions about the history of band payments from krewes – and why those payments matter. 

On most Fat Tuesdays in recent history, thousands of New Orleanians, mostly Black people, packed the edge of Orleans Avenue. The smell of freshly grilled hot sausage was in the air. Music came from every angle.

Then, like clockwork – reliable, though not always on time – the Krewe of Zulu parade would roll through the middle of the historic Treme celebration, throwing coconuts, plush spears, and tons of trademark Zulu beads.

But this year, things changed. On Monday, with forecasters looking ahead to Mardi Gras Day and predicting 40 mph winds by about 12 noon, the city announced that the Krewes of Zulu and Rex would roll hours early on Tuesday. To make the parades move quickly, there would be no bands or walking groups, city officials said. 

While both parades cut their routes short, Zulu’s truncated route kept the parade entirely Uptown — far from its homebase near Orleans Avenue.

Business owners, who had prepared for their biggest day of the year, were instead saddled with loads of leftover inventory. Most school bands also did not march, though Zulu was able to find a way to include both the St. Augustine Marching 100 — alma mater of Zulu King Rodney Mason Jr. — and the visiting Talladega College band, which had already traveled to the city.

Often, in the wake of parade cancellations, local bands that don’t play aren’t compensated. It seems to be a long-held parading practice; bands experienced financial losses a few weeks ago, when Sunday parades were rescheduled to Tuesday.

For Mardi Gras Day bands, the Rex organization took a singular stand, opting to pay the bands that were booked for its parade. But at this point, it seems that none of the other krewes with altered parades have followed suit.

With the exception of St. Augustine, the local high school bands booked for Zulu did not march – and will not be paid, a club spokesman said.

Making concessions just to get onto the street

To ensure that their historic parades weren’t shut down altogether, krewe leaders discussed a range of possibilities with city leaders. But getting floats on streets required concessions.

Zulu had to “compromise in order to parade.” said Darren Mire, the krewe’s spokesman, noting that the route did not even pass the famous Zulu Club at 732 N. Broad St., steps away from Orleans Avenue. “It’s a tradition,” he said. “It’s our home.”

The king’s float also couldn’t make its traditional stop at 2301 Orleans Ave., where the Chase family gathers outside their restaurant each year. “We missed the toast at Dooky Chase,” Mire said. 

Disappointment for the omitted stops went beyond Zulu riders and royalty. Crowds who packed the Basin and Orleans corridor mourned not being able to mark the end of Carnival with Zulu.

All along Orleans Avenue, people spent the day feeling like something was missing, said Patrick Walker Jr., best known as DJ PJ, who hosted his third annual block party at the historic Carver Theater, at 2101 Orleans Ave.

Until the bad-weather forecasts began, Walker’s primary focus for the year was adding an adjacent parking lot to ensure that there was enough space. His block party – “like a huge family reunion,” he said – has quickly become a popular new Tuesday tradition. Last year, Zulu tractors had difficulty moving the parade floats forward through that part of Orleans Avenue, he said. So his primary concern was to add extra space, to remedy that.

Then came Monday night’s announcement, followed by a flood of calls from past attendees. Walker had contemplated cancelling the party, but by early Tuesday morning, calls from his supporters convinced him that he shouldn’t shut down the event, which is free and open to the public. He listened. “I did this for my people,” he said.

The winds were formidable, as the city had warned about in repeated NOLAREADY texts. Though Walker placed his DJ equipment under a tent, its legs weighted down by big pieces of concrete, wind gusts kept pulling it up, he said.

Oddly, Walker’s crowd grew faster than ever before, he said, because of people who skipped the shortened Zulu parade, coming early to the Carver. That gave a surge of business to what he calls the “ecosystem of vendors” – food and drink trucks – that park near his block party. His sizeable crowd sharply contrasted with businesses along the Zulu route, which reported scant crowds and smaller revenues.

Stocked up, for crowds that didn’t arrive

Two blocks away from the Carver, at 1931 Orleans Ave., Sharon Martin opened Goldy’s Lounge nine months ago. Excited for the bar’s very first Fat Tuesday, she prepared by stocking up — really stocking up. By Monday evening, her cooler and storage spaces were jam-packed full of liquor and cold drinks, to the point where she had to rent one of her landlord’s apartments upstairs to hold the overflow.

Now, much of her supplies sit, unopened. “I won’t have to order anything for quite awhile,” said Martin, who — relying on numbers the bar had seen for Zulu under previous owners — had anticipated making at least $10,000 for the day.

Goldy’s was somewhat saved by people stopping on their way to and from the nearby Carnival hub, North Claiborne and Orleans Avenues. But when the day was done, the lounge made less than half of what they’d predicted.

As an avid parade goer, Martin rarely misses a parade during Carnival. Tops on her list is Zulu, which she had never before missed. For her and those around her, she said, Zulu is the highlight of Fat Tuesday. To her, white krewes see Black people in the crowd and don’t throw as readily, or sometimes, she said, throw too aggressively. It’s different with Zulu, whose riders lavish attention on Black parade-goers. 

To be able to watch Zulu from her own bar felt like a life’s dream fulfilled.

Then came the route change, mere hours before the parade rolled. “There was nothing you could do about it, you couldn’t change the situation,” said Martin, who fails to understand why the parade turned down Poydras Street instead of continuing to Orleans, since the streets are parallel to one another. 

In the end, Zulu — which was formed as a parody of elite white Uptown Carnival clubs — did not even touch downtown. “The community of Orleans where the Zulu club is, we are hurt,” Martin said. “We feel like we were slapped in the face. To not see the only original Black Mardi Gras krewe, it was hurtful.” 

A similar sting was felt at Backatown Coffee Parlour, at 301 Basin St., which usually makes between $4,000 and $5,000 on Mardi Gras Day, its highest-grossing day of the year, owner Jessica Knox told The Lens. A big part that success comes during the Zulu parade, which rolls by on Basin Street before it curves onto Orleans Avenue. Backatown usually makes an additional $1,500 in viewing tickets for customers who want to eat her food and watch Zulu from the coffee shop. “It is my best day,” Knox said. “Essence used to compare, but since all tourists are now directed to stay around the Convention Center, it is no longer as profitable.”

Tuesday’s re-routing was particularly painful because only one parade passes through Treme, Knox said. “When those in power are making decisions, they have to do more than look at the quickest route,” Knox said. “They should look at the quickest and most equitable.”

No pay for local bands

To balance band-department budgets, band directors rely on the money earned from Carnival parades, which ranges between $1,000 and $5,000, with the top pay reserved for top-tier schools. On parade days, directors pay for buses and meals for students. They use the remaining money to repair and replace instruments and to dry-clean uniforms at the end of the school year and to hold awards ceremonies and celebrate students.

But when parades are canceled, or rescheduled without bands, bands typically do not get paid. That can leave them without enough money to get instruments and uniforms ready for the next year.

This year, the Rex organization decided to compensate the 16 bands that had been scheduled to march within its Mardi Gras Day procession, according to Ben Dupuy, the Rex krewe communications lead, who made the announcement in a message emailed to The Lens.

“Despite the changes made for safety purposes, Rex is paying the bands that were scheduled to march in our parade,” Dupuy wrote. “Rex always loves including marching bands because it improves the parade experience for all involved, and we look forward to their safe return in 2026.”

That shift, in this musical town — where bands are often the highlight of Carnival parades — raised questions about the history of bands getting paid in the wake of cancelled parades.

Whether bands get paid after a cancellation varies between krewes, which all have their own contracts, said Mardi Gras historian Arthur Hardy, who also was a high school band director during the 1970s and 1980s, when school board contracts specified that krewes would pay bands 50% if parades were canceled.

“It’s a tricky, tricky business,” Hardy said. “You don’t want to see schools hurt.”

After making some calls, Hardy confirmed that, before Hurricane Katrina, Orleans Parish School Board used a standardized marching-band contract with parade krewes. “It stated that if the band had not left the band room, half of the contracted amount was due. If the band arrived to the formation area, the full amount was due,” he said. Currently, though there is no standard, he said, some charter schools and krewes may still use parts of OPSB’s standard contract.

For marching bands, there are many layers to parade cancellations, especially for seniors who miss crucial parades in their last year of marching.

At Warren Easton High School, one of the 16 bands hired by Rex, this year’s changes left the band’s seniors heartbroken, said band director Johnny Fisher. The seniors were let down because they weren’t able to properly relish the last parade of their high school careers — or receive their letter jackets on Fat Tuesday, an Easton Carnival tradition.

On Friday, Fisher hadn’t yet heard that Easton would be compensated, because Rex notified its bands this weekend. The news came as a relief, Fisher said. “It helps out a lot,” he said, noting that he expects to use some of it for instrument repair and the rest to help some students afford Warren Easton’s trip to this year’s Chicago Thanksgiving parade.

Adverse weather hit this year’s Carnival twice

Band pay became a more urgent issue this year because of repeated bad weather during the last two weeks of Carnival.

Only once has Rex faced a complete rainout, in 1933, according to Hardy, the historian. In 1995, thunderstorms ruined much of the day. At the advice of Rex royal meteorologist Nash Roberts, the parade rolled that year without bands, two hours late — between storm systems, in what’s now referred to as the “Nash Dash.” That morning, Zulu and its bands were caught in fierce downpours, according to reports from the Times-Picayune, which described rain “streaming off King Zulu” and “sodden banners” ahead of the John F. Kennedy High School marching band.

This year, inclement conditions forced parades to make changes twice, on Mardi Gras Day and on Feb. 23, the first Sunday of parades, when the forecast showed, accurately, that it would rain all day. The Sunday day and evening parades were rescheduled to Tuesday – two days later – but they rolled in one evening, without bands or walking krewes, so that all the parades could be condensed into one weekday evening.

It seems as though the local bands scheduled for Sunday’s parade were not paid, from initial reporting done by The Lens. One source, a krewe leader who preferred not to be named, said that many current parade contracts include a clause allowing local bands to go unpaid if the city orders the parade not to roll, or to roll without marching groups. College bands, which often must travel to make the parades, typically are paid, he said.

To some band directors – especially those who also perform as professional musicians – the issue is reminiscent of a 2004 dispute between the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and New Orleans-area musicians who initially went unpaid even as Jazz Fest paid national acts for rained-out performances. Jazz Fest ended up paying the local musicians.

After Mardi Gras, Hardy spoke with two longtime parade marshals, who preferred to share their information through him, he said.  

“As a rule of thumb, out-of-town bands get paid everything. Local bands that show up at the parade site get everything or at least half,” Hardy said. But if a band doesn’t leave the school band room, they get nothing – unless the krewe wants to pay them, he said. “Frankly, the big-budget krewes can afford to be generous. Ones on the borderline can’t.”

Zulu is following the “never left the bandroom” protocol for New Orleans high school bands that were scheduled to play in its parade, said Mire, the Zulu spokesman, who confirmed that, at this point, only bands that played on Tuesday would be paid. “Most of the local bands understood,” he said.

‘Rex is structured differently than Zulu’

“Rex is structured differently than Zulu,” Mire said. But certainly, he said, this was new territory for Zulu. “We’ve really never had this situation.” The topic may be discussed at the next Zulu board meeting, he said.

Like some of the Rex bands, some Zulu bands were not yet sure of their pay status on Friday, said Keith Thomas, director of John F. Kennedy High School’s marching band, whose band was booked to march in Zulu this year.

If Zulu money comes through, it would be used for Kennedy’s annual band banquet, which bestows awards on individual students and recognizes band members for hard work during marching season, he said. But, to date, they’ve heard nothing certain about Zulu parade pay, said Thomas, who is also a Zulu member. He will likely find out about compensation when krewe members meet next week, he said.

Rex officials have also been making decisions in recent days. Soon, Warren Easton and the other Rex bands will receive the plaques and medals that the krewe routinely confers to bands after a parade. Rex has also invited all 2025 bands to march with Rex in 2026. “Our plan,” Dupuy said, “has been to treat them as if they had been able to be with us and march with us on Mardi Gras.”",3,1741604259.0,NewOrleans,0,0.71,False

Hallo zusammen,

ich richte mich heute speziell an profitable Retailtrader mit einer Frage zum persönlichen Austausch:

Was macht ihr neben Chartanalysen, Fundamentalanalysen und Backtesting? Welche Hobbys verfolgt ihr, nehmt ihr an Meet-ups teil oder seid ihr anderweitig gut vernetzt?

Hintergrund meiner Frage: Ich spiele aktuell mit dem Gedanken, im deutschsprachigen Raum einen exklusiven Club oder eine Bar als Treffpunkt für Trader zu eröffnen, um einen realen Austausch in angenehmer Atmosphäre zu ermöglichen. Meine bisherigen Erfahrungen zeigen, dass viele Veranstaltungen eher auf Investment-Vertrieb oder MLM fokussiert sind und weniger den echten Austausch fördern. Ich persönlich ziehe es vor, Fachgespräche und Networking in einer entspannten Umgebung bei einem Kaffee zu führen, da dies oftmals tiefergehende Verbindungen ermöglicht als rein online.

Habt ihr Interesse an so etwas oder bereits Erfahrungen damit gemacht? Ich freue mich sehr über eure Meinungen, Erfahrungen und Empfehlungen!

Hello everyone,

I have a question specifically for profitable retail traders:

What do you do besides your charting, fundamental analysis, and backtesting? Do you pursue certain hobbies, attend meet-ups, or maintain other types of connections?

The reason behind my question is that I'm currently exploring the idea of establishing an exclusive club or bar as a meeting place for traders in the German-speaking community, to facilitate personal interactions and genuine exchange. In my experience, existing events often turn into promotional or MLM meetings rather than authentic networking opportunities. Personally, I prefer having meaningful discussions in a relaxed environment over coffee rather than online interactions, as it allows for deeper connections.

Would you be interested in something like this, or do you already have experience or suggestions regarding trader meet-ups?

I'm looking forward to your thoughts, experiences, and recommendations!

1j7vtq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/monsterenergy/comments/1j7vtq1/monster_lover_here_a_recap_on_monster_energy_and/,"Monster lover here: a recap on Monster Energy and Health, with numbers","Context here: Scientist here. Phd in Sciences, not in medical Sciences, but I did read peer-reviewed scientific publications on the subject.

I see many questions on the subject, and I'd like to summary what I read.  
  
I think it's nice to have a good recap because there's so much being said either in making energy drink evil, or in contrary by diminishing the negative effects. I'm from west europe, and a general trend here is to welcome with very high scepticism basically everything that is new (caution principle). This was true for energy drinks in the 90s, but also for GSMs at the beginning, which were supposedly giving ""testicles cancers"" and many more examples like that. One example is France banning Taurine in their energy drink because scientists were not fully aware of potential drawbacks. Nevertheless, in the general opinion, Monster Energy drinks still have a bad image.

This being said, **your main enemy in Energy drink is caffeine**.

Daily safe consumption for a healthy adult is 400mg cumulated (max 100mg for a teenager, 0 for children), and single dose caffeine should be below 200mg. Caffeine content of most caffeine beverage are way below that. Remember these two values; there is 80mg of caffeine per coffee (200ml), while you have 160mg of caffeine per Monster (500ml). It takes about 5 hours to halve your caffeine concentration. Finally, these doses are given for a population, but variability is strong among individuals. You can also adopt caffeine resistance if you're already have too much caffeine intake.

First conclusion here is that numbers say that no teenager should drink Energy drinks. This being said, teenage years are the right time to defy authority and rules, so this is fine for me. Second conclusion is that you should be careful mixing coffee and energy drink as they stack up. Drinking coffee when waking up, then drinking a Pacific Punch in the morning, drinking a coffee during the lunch break, and finally, a Ultra White Zero in the afternoon is bad habit. 

Example: 

* Coffee at 7am : 80mg  
* Monster at 10 am: 160mg  
* Coffee at 1pm : 80mg  
* Monster a 3 pm: 160mg

2 coffees and 2 sodas. Seems right ? If you make the computations:  
At 4pm, you already accumulated 480mg caffeine, and you currently have a peak of 285mg (80\*0.287+160\*0.435+80\*0.659+160\*0.871)

In that reasonable scenario, you're already off chart. My personal habit is to drink coffee on works days, and limit to one energy drink per day the other days (without coffee). So my consumption is 1-2 Monster a week. This habit also helps me getting excited to get a Monster. It's like I appreciate it even more! Also, avoid energy drinks that advertised 300mg of caffeine or more. I just cannot understand how is that even legal.

For those wondering, overconsumption of caffeine has short-term and long-term effects. This includes: anxiety , heart palpitations, sleep disorder in short term, and high blood pressure, reduced calcium absorption, increased cortisol (chronic stress) in the long term. This is why the limit of 400mg is the value for a healthy adult. Your goal here is simple: get the caffeine high enough to get its benefits, but keeping the concentration low enough to let the body eliminates it, instead of stacking (especially before sleeping).

On top of caffeine, Monster Energy includes other ingredients. Most common ones are Taurine, L-Carnitine, Guarana.

Compared to the first years of introducing Taurine, its roles are way better understood today. Taurine has observed effects of regulating electrolytes, reduce blood pressure (vasodilation), antioxydant, and modulate neuronal transfer. On a other subject, you can actually buy Taurine supplement at a drugstore.   
  
Why France banned Taurine then? In early 90s, roles of Taurine were not very clear and after the death of an athlete in 1991, precaution principles implied a ban of Taurine (why not caffeine? Idk). France reverts its decision and since 2008, Taurine is now back again. L-Carnitine is a ""fat-burning"" complement but doses in Energy drinks are generally too low to have an observable effect. Guarana has a long-lasting caffeine (included in the 160mg). 

I'd like to point out that despite the fact that drinking Monster is very safe if you know what you're doing, the marketing over Monster is really bad in some aspects. First, Monster Energy is targeting a young audience, who is supposed not to drink caffeine at high amount. Monster Energy, and other brands, are also targeting gamers, for their focus-boosting effects. While this is true in practice, you should clearly not drink 160mg of caffeine at night (if you play before sleeping). Second, Monster Energy is very pricy, in comparison to many other beverages. This price is often unjustified, and also a bit sad when I see teenagers buying them. Finally, the sugar intake of Monster is just ... Monstruous. This is not specific to Monster, but Monster does have very sweet flavors. As an example, Monster Assault has 89g of sugar (355kcal !!!! ) per can. This is almost the double of coca-cola concentration, but also in larger volume (500ml can vs 250 original coca glass). 

Well I hope this helps a bit. Let's all enjoy our Monster Energy drink at right proportion, so that we can savor our weird passion at the right rime, while leaving our body safe !

Have a great day everyone !

I'm a Travel Photographer that will be visiting Grenoble for the first time later this week.

Any local insights for things I should absolutely not miss besides taking a lift on the 'eggs'?

I'm mostly looking for:

\- Places to capture the best overlooks of the city. Maybe a nearby hill, or a hotel with free rooftop access?  
\- Best places for craft beer  
\- Best places for pastries in the morning.   
\- Restaurant recommendations as well that are not touristy for dinner and lunch. I'm after local cuisine, nothing fancy.  
\- Anywhere I can have a coffee and work for a few hours in the afternoon with my Laptop

Any insights would be greatly appreciated :)

First and foremost, my thesis rests upon the ground theory, which presumes that the big bang(s) is the origin of all existing matter within the galaxy. ""Spinning Coil"" builds on that foundation, as it states the following.

  
According to my speculations, which are based on thin air and one too many coffee's, the big bang set matter and energy in motion across all the galaxies, and turned the universe into what is comparable to a spinning coil (hence the name of the theory). My belief is that it is because of this constant motion, as a result of the big collision, that everything still breathes and the universe hasn't been destroyed yet. 

  
What I am getting to is a few things, first being that the universe is bound to spin out, according to my estimations this could take a lot longer than we anticipate. Secondly is a brief sub-theory that is important for the rest of the story.

  
**Sub-Theory: time=motion**

The second theory of my thesis, is only really important as for the final conclusion that I'm working towards. You see, I hold firmly to my heart and mind that there is no distinction between time and motion. It is my uneducated opinion, that time itself is merely a by-product of motion, and that if a universe is not in motion then it is frozen in time. I therefore believe that time is a mechanism that is intrinsically baked into our universe's orbit, which means that there are multiple times within time itself, each of which dictated by the greater magnitude.

  
**THE FINAL CONCLUSION (VERY IMPORTANT!)**

On a certain night I had drank too much coffee. It all seems so sensible to me now.

  
The universe had a big bang, and as a result we were set in motion. There is a possibility that there is either one or many centers within our universe, but I strongly believe that over time, a cluster of centers have collided into one, massive central point that dictates the entire orbit of all of the galaxies.

  
My conclusion comes down to the space-time vacuum. Maybe gravity is such a hard thing to comprehend, because we have been ignoring the bigger picture. It is quite literally too large for us to observe.

  
Space-time vacuum speculates that gravity is comparable to objects ""falling"" into each other, and I believe that this is the reason why.

  
**We are quite literally falling into the center of the universe at all times.**

Maybe the reason gravity seems to be a falling motion, is because we quite literally ARE falling. But we're likely falling into the center of the universe, a center that is distant enough that we don't even notice what we are falling into. A central force that could easily be proven, if we found that several given objects regardless of their location within the universe seemed to rotate at the same rough trajectory, not contradicting the universal orbit. Furthermore, if there really is one center, it would be quite easy to prove that there is a central gravity enacting upon each of the celestial bodies at any given moment.

  
So my conclusion is that the big bang lead to matter set in motion, which lead to a cluster of central focus within the universe. this lead to a central point forming that keeps the universe rotating, this could be galaxies, a galaxy or even a single black hole. Furthermore, our gravity and everything that we know is kept in motion, because each one of the planets, stars and galaxies are slowly sinking into this central part of reality.",1,1741602973.0,Vent,0,1.0,False
