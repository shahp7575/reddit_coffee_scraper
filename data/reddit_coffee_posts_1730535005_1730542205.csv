1ght75y,https://i.redd.it/emiuldd1qgyd1.jpeg,My Journey to Recovery from H. pylori Infection and Stomach Issues,"

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share my journey to recovery from an H. pylori infection – it’s been a long and challenging path, but I’ve finally made noticeable progress. Hopefully, my story can help others facing similar struggles.

The First Signs and Search for Answers
It all began in late April, early May 2024, with mild stomach discomfort that quickly escalated. I visited my doctor multiple times as the symptoms intensified each week. Despite numerous tests (blood work, urine samples, X-rays, and ultrasound), no clear diagnosis was found. Without answers, I decided to get an H. pylori test independently at a lab in Zurich – and the result came back positive.

Diagnosis and Antibiotic Therapy – Mixed Results
With the test result, I underwent an endoscopy, which revealed a small hiatal hernia, gastritis, and numerous H. pylori bacteria, identified as the cause of my symptoms. I started a triple-quadruple antibiotic therapy. While the symptoms initially improved, they returned shortly after the 10-day course, bringing back the same chest and back pains.

When the symptoms resurfaced, I consulted with the gastroenterologist who had done the endoscopy. Unfortunately, he couldn’t explain the recurring symptoms and, as is often the case in conventional medicine, suggested psychosomatic factors when no clear cause could be found. Additional visits to my primary care doctor didn’t yield results either. After repeated requests, he finally approved a CT scan, which showed no concerning findings. I was reassured that everything looked fine.

Taking My Health into My Own Hands
At this point, I decided to take my health into my own hands. Although the bacteria had been eradicated, my symptoms persisted, so I began researching extensively and experimenting with different approaches to find relief.

My Current Treatment and Supplements
After reading countless testimonials and studies, I established a routine of small meals and specific supplements. Here’s my current approach:

	1.	Probiotics First Thing in the Morning: Before breakfast, I take OMNi-BiOTiC 10 to support my gut health. I had tried several probiotics, but many caused constipation and abdominal discomfort. Based on my osteopath’s recommendation, I found OMNi-BiOTiC 10 to have a much more positive effect.
	2.	Prebiotics to Support Probiotics: To “feed” the probiotics and enhance their effectiveness, I use OMNi-LOGiC PLUS as a prebiotic. I add this to the same glass as my other supplements.
	3.	Routine Before Meals: About ten minutes before each meal, I warm a glass of water and dissolve a teaspoon of raw honey. I then open a Mastix gum capsule from California Gold (ordered from iHerb), a DGL capsule from NOW containing licorice and aloe vera, and a zinc-L-carnosine capsule. I mix all of this in the honey water and drink it.

Diet Tips and Breakfast Habits
To further support my stomach and gut health, I often eat a small portion of porridge for breakfast. I also grind a teaspoon of black cumin seeds in a coffee grinder and add it to the porridge. Black cumin seeds have anti-inflammatory properties and can help strengthen the gut. I also recommend eating bananas, as they’re gentle on the stomach and a great nutrient source for probiotics.

Additionally, to further support my gut, I take two Colon Lecithin capsules from Metacare three times daily. This supplement strengthens the gut with glutamine and other ingredients beneficial for IBS and leaky gut syndrome. To boost my immune system, I also take vitamin C, omega-3, OPC, broccoli sprout extract, vitamin D3 plus K2, and vegan digestive enzymes after each meal to ease the stomach’s workload.

Lifestyle Adjustments
Though the bacteria are gone, the symptoms linger. I’ve learned that recovering from H. pylori requires long-term adjustments. Diet plays a major role, as my body no longer tolerates certain foods. Specifically, I avoid tomato sauce, spicy foods, and chocolate – things I used to enjoy. These foods trigger symptoms, so I’ve learned to avoid them. Eating smaller portions throughout the day and avoiding trigger foods has been helpful.

Steady Progress and Reduced Medication
Week by week, I feel a steady improvement. Nearly six months have passed, and I no longer rely on stomach protectors like pantoprazole. Only occasionally, in rare cases of severe setbacks, do I take a small 20 mg dose of pantoprazole for two or three consecutive days. This only happens once or twice a month at most, which shows I’m on the right path to managing my symptoms long-term.

Encouraging Words and My Conclusion
The symptoms haven’t completely disappeared, but I’m confident they will soon. I want to encourage everyone not to give up or become overly anxious. Even when doctors may not have answers, I can affirm, from my own experience and extensive research, that healing from H. pylori takes time. I’ve spoken with people who took up to three years to recover fully – though this was an extreme case with three ulcers and stomach perforations. From what I’ve seen, an average recovery period is about one year for the body to fully regenerate after antibiotic therapy, allowing the stomach to function normally again.

1ght4fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/RevPit/comments/1ght4fi/fall_into_fiction_writing_productivity_tips_and_a/,[Fall into Fiction] Writing Productivity Tips and a Game with Prizes!,"Hello, Fall into Fiction with RevPit 2024 authors! Miranda Darrow, here with my first writing tips post of the event, with a list of tips on writing productivity:

1. **Schedule time to write, even if only fifteen minutes three times a week**. Mark it in your calendar, block it off on your schedule, and show up like it’s a job. Once you get going, you may find more brief opportunities available, but to get the ball rolling, make some appointments with yourself. Then, write something, even if it isn’t the great American novel, during this time. Start with journal entries about what you’d like to write, which could morph into an outline, which could then lead to writing the inciting incident and the climax, always fun to write. But it starts with making a little bit of time for it. I also block chunks for time for myself and my writing in our family shared Google Calendar, putting my husband on notice that he's designated chauffer for some of those times.
2. **Find a comfortable place to write**. I wrote my first two full manuscripts (each 90,000 words) sitting on my bed, writing on a laptop on some clunky wood lap table. My back was very angry with this choice at the time (I was over 40), but it was worth it. Every time I wanted to write, I’d need to haul my supplies from another room, and then put it all away when I was done. You too can write where you are. But it gets a whole lot easier if you dedicate a place to your writing where you can keep your computer (or typewriter, I might still have mine from college somewhere, or fancy journals that I always buy and never use), your research, your outline, a coaster for your coffee or tea. Even if it’s a corner of your kitchen table and you need to stash everything in a box every time your family eats a meal, when you pull out that box and setup on that end of the table, you’re in your own writing studio.
3. **Get some fun office supplies**. Okay, maybe it’s just me, but I love office supplies. More journals than I’ll ever write in (as I do most of my drafting on my computer), funky binder clips, and don’t even get me started on cute binders for my WIP. I have a bizarre collection of cacti. Mind you, I live in Minnesota – there are no cacti here. But, my son liked them and he keeps getting me cacti for my writing space. Have fun with this. Not a huge investment. It could be fun colored sticky notes, colored pencils, gel pens, something whimsical and inspiring. And then, when you’re looking for motivation to get to a milestone, allow yourself to go to Target or Staples or the Dollar Store (which has awesome binders for a $1 sometimes if I’m really lucky) and get something kitschy and fun for your writing space.
4. **Remove physical distractions from your writing location**. I’m never a more enthusiastic house cleaner than when I’m trying to write. I’ll dust and straighten even vacuum (okay, I won’t go that far, but some people do). You’ve got your spot. If it’s in your house, do everything you can to make sure you aren’t facing the pile of dirty laundry or stack of unwashed dishes. If you find that you’d really rather clean that write, schedule your writing sessions for my house and I’ll give you pithy bits of writing advice while we clean my bathroom. Warning, I live with boys with bad aim.
5. **Remove people and pet distractions to the extent possible**. I once sat through a writing productivity seminar by an unpublished author whose claim to fame was he’d “won” a fall writing contest for a number of years. He was married, did not work outside of writing, and had no children. He explained to our assembled group of largely working mothers how when he put on a special hat, his wife would leave him alone. We chuckled among ourselves, wondering how well all that would work with our children and not this guy’s very accommodating wife. If you can’t control others, take control of that which you can: yourself! Put away your cellphone, turn off your Wi-Fi, don’t flip on the TV to check the score of the game or to find out who is left vying for the final rose . . . Don’t try to write when you know you’ll be distracted. Make this time for you and your writing.
6. **Make some writing friends**. Maybe you already know people who are seriously pursuing their writing. If not, Fall into Fiction is a good time and place to meet some. Meet someone in a writing sprint or in a Reddit thread. You might think this is the opposite of productivity, because it could lead to more distractions. But most writers will benefit from having others who understand the challenges and joys of writing to share the journey. And, your writing pals can be your critique partners and beta readers. And you can challenge yourselves to do more than you might without that deadline, that accountability of having twenty pages each month for your critique group page swap. Announcing your writing goals to your writing friends can help you be more accountable, wanting to not let those friends down.
7. **Track your progress**. If you’ve committed to your writing schedule in item 1, you’ve written down something. Last week, I wrote a flash fiction (word limit 2000 words) and worked on an editing project. I can tell you all of that not just because it was literally the last two days, but because I have a project tracking white board, and these things are checked off (or have the line which indicates I’ve started them but haven’t finished yet – oh that line, such a cruel task-master). Even though I use a whiteboard (because I happen to LOVE office supplies), I still have a Word document list of my writing and editing projects, both upcoming, current, and completed. Nothing encourages more dedication than seeing results.
8. **Celebrate your writing milestones**. I might make an outline and reward myself with a book I’ve been wanting to buy, or write 10,000 words and then treat myself to a new set of Pair Eyewear toppers or a bookish shirt from Piper & Ivy. I’ll celebrate once I get to a milestone even if it’s not on the exact date I’d wanted, because it’s still progress. Tell your writing buddies, those ones you reached out to in Step 5 or already knew, on-line or in person, so they can cheer you on.
9. **Claim even more time to write**. I get up at 5:00 am to write, because I work fulltime and have young kids. Lots of people are getting up at this time––there’s a whole #5amWritersClub hashtag and I’ve actually met several published authors through this online community. I think there are other ones out there for later or coffee shop writers or something, but dig deep and think when there could be more time in your schedule to write. Maybe you don’t need to watch that one TV show that you think has jumped the shark anyway. Maybe it’s someone else’s turn for dishes and you head to write immediately after dinner. Find some more time. Claim it. Make it work for you.
10. **Finish that draft**. It doesn’t have to be a full-length novel Write a short story, novella, flash fiction. Get something done beginning to “THE END” and print it out. Hang it on your fridge. Celebrate having finished your draft. Then, if you are writing with an eye towards publishing, show it to your writer friends. If you’re writing for yourself and your family only, not necessary. Every writer needs feedback to grow and improve, especially if you’re just starting out. And once you get feedback, think about it. Ask more people if you’re not sure if they have a point or not. And then maybe try some revisions. Or, if that one is over for you, start writing something new. For Fall into Fiction, I'm hosting writing sprints for 40 minutes over my lunch break (1 PM Eastern, noon Central) from my day job on Mondays and Fridays. Join me and get some words on your page (or screen).

I've been working on a writing craft book based on the concept of making a game out of your writing, called Gamify Your Writing to Level Up Your Productivity and Reader Engagement. This is based on a series of gamify and productivity presentations I've given at several online writing conferences, including The Writing Gals 2024 conference and Daniel David Wallace's Find Your Readers Summit. I developed some tips and tricks for how to make your writing into a game, and one fun tip is playing ""Writing Time and Space Bingo.""

a few hours later i felt pain (akin to a stitch) while sitting down doing absolutely nothing in my upper left abdomen and took a closer look at what i’d just chucked up. it’s very logical to assume this is just the coke i drank, and i understand that, but i figured it was better to be safe than sorry, so if anyone could weigh in on this, i’d appreciate it a lot.

I’m also having trouble figuring out how (how long, what steps, materials, etc) to mass dry gummies at home and make them not sticky. 

In our former tries, there were less gelatin and that resulted in firm jello(?), but the taste was really good and the flavors could truly be enjoyed. But in the recent tries with the chewiness and firmness we’ve been aiming for, where more gelatin was added, the taste seems to have been sacrificed and it’s hard to taste upon the first bite until you chew for a bit (but even after chewing, the taste is minimal).

I’m thinking it may be linked to how our flavoring (the espresso/matcha powder + milk + cream & other additional flavors) has a considerable liquid quantity. So far the ratio is that the flavoring liquid mixture is 2-3 tbsp more than the gelatin… Though not sure if the glucose syrup has a part in the ratio.

Is there anything that can be done?

In summary, I need tips with:
1. Stronger taste for gummies while still maintaining the ideal chewiness & firmness
2. How to mass dry the gummies at home
3. Reduce stickiness

The general recipe includes gelatine, glucose syrup, espresso (about 8-10 tbsp so far) or matcha powder (liquifying it with 2 tbsp water for 4 tbsp matcha), cream, milk, white sugar, and additional flavors like powders or syrups.

After spending years looking like I'd been electrocuted by my discount curling iron, I finally decided to invest in something that wouldn't make my hair look like a before picture in a infomercial.

Here's what happened next.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Update:

BEST PRICE on the Bio Ionic Long Barrel Styler here:

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

When this thing arrived, I literally thought Amazon had sent me some kind of medieval jousting equipment. The barrel is so long it could probably double as a lightsaber.

But actually, the length makes this thing really cool. As someone whose previous hair styling strategy consisted of ""curl what you can reach and hope for the best,"" this was like discovering electricity after years of rubbing sticks together.

The sleek design and the digital temperature display had me feeling like I was finally joining the big leagues of hair styling. Gone were the days of my $19.99 drugstore curling iron that had the temperature accuracy of a mood ring.

# Key Features

**The Extended Barrel:** This 2-inch longer barrel means you can actually curl entire sections of hair without playing that fun game called ""Which Part Did I Miss?"" For me, the length is the difference between spending 45 minutes or 20 minutes on my hair.

**NanoIonic MX Technology:** This technology apparently infuses moisture into your hair while you style. I don't know what this really means, but my hair had much better shine. It went from ""just styled"" to ""I definitely paid someone for this.""

**Multi-Level Heat Control:** Unlike my ex's emotional availability, this temperature control is actually reliable. The settings go up to 430F, so you can customize the heat to your hair type. Fine haired people can stop at a lower temp, but with my thick-hair this means I can crank it up without fear.

**Ceramic Barrel Coating:** It distributes heat evenly, which means no more of those weird crimped sections where your iron decided to have a hot flash.

**Cool-Tip Design:** The tip stays cool enough to hold, which means no more burnt fingertips and fewer colorful words muttered under my breath.

# Pros

* The longer barrel is great for long or thick hair
* Heats up faster than my morning coffee
* Creates curls that actually last (like, second-day hair looks better than first-day lasting)
* The digital temperature display is actually accurate (I was surprised)
* Pretty lightweight despite its length

# Cons

* The price tag might have made me cry a little
* Takes some getting used to if you're upgrading from a shorter barrel
* The buttons are positioned where your hand naturally wants to rest
* Storage might be tricky unless you have huge cabinets

# This styler is perfect for:

* Long-haired humans tired of sectioning their hair into 47 parts
* People who value their time more than their money
* Anyone who's ever wished for salon-worthy hair without the salon price tag
* Those who've burned their ears enough times to justify an upgrade

# Avoid if:

* You have super short hair (this might be overkill)
* You're looking for a budget option

1ghssnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1ghssnw/nagano_lean_body_tonic_review_is_it_the_best/,"Nagano Lean Body Tonic Review – Is it the best supergreens with probiotic, Japanese anti-aging and weight loss elixir?","In my opinion, If you’re looking for a comprehensive supplement to support overall wellness and potentially aid in weight management, the *Nagano Japanese Lean Body Tonic* might be worth considering. This blend has a solid mix of greens, antioxidants, digestive aids, and probiotics, which all play different roles in promoting health & weight management.

All in all, The [***Nagano Japanese Lean Body Tonic***](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/nagano.php) is a well-rounded supergreens blend, combining metabolism-supporting ingredients like green tea extract and cinnamon with antioxidant-rich greens and probiotics for digestive health.

It’s especially useful for users looking to fill dietary gaps, seeking weight management and blood sugar regulation, improve gut health, or ***enjoy a gentle energy lift without high caffeine content***.

While its proprietary blend may limit transparency on individual ingredient dosages, the ingredients diversity is awesome!

it’s a convenient choice for overall wellness support. Based on its versatility, value for money and benefits, I’d rate it a **4 out of 5**. Make sure you [**only buy from the official website**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/nagano.php), Amazon etc. may have counterfeits.

Another greens supplement that I like is [**YourBiology Super greens**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/ybsupergreens.php), which is also worth checking out.  

In my opinion, here’s what I think you can expect with Nagano:

**Potential Benefits**

1. **Metabolism and Weight Management Support** The *Nutrient Dense Natural Herbs and Extracts* section includes ingredients like green tea extract, cinnamon, and bitter melon, all of which are popular for their metabolism-boosting and blood sugar-regulating effects. **Green tea extract**, in particular, is known for EGCG, a compound linked to fat oxidation. **Cinnamon** can help keep blood sugar in check, which might help with cravings. These ingredients don’t work magic on their own, but they can be a nice addition if you’re also focusing on diet and exercise.
2. **Antioxidant and Immune Support** The *Super Food Greens and Antioxidant Blend* provides a variety of fruits and vegetables, which means a good range of antioxidants. Ingredients like **blueberry, cranberry, and camu camu** are packed with Vitamin C and other antioxidants that help combat oxidative stress. This can support overall immunity, which is a plus if you’re someone who gets run down easily. **Alfalfa leaf** in the *Nagano Japanese Lean Body Tonic* supports healthy blood sugar and has calming effects that enhance focus and wellness.
3. **Digestive Health** With both **prebiotics (like inulin) and probiotics (like Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium strains),** this tonic could support gut health, which can be a big factor in weight management and overall wellness. **From my experience, a good probiotic blend can help reduce bloating and improve digestion**, though the effectiveness can vary by person. If you struggle with digestive regularity or **feel sluggish after meals**, the **digestive enzymes like bromelain and papain** might also help break down food more efficiently. Also the fiber from **inulin and Digestive complex** would also make you feel fuller for longer. [**Also check out this post on Fiber supplements for weight loss**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1gh471u/master_list_of_best_fiber_pills_and_supplements/)**.**
4. **Energy and Stress Support** **Ashwagandha and Panax ginseng** are adaptogens known for supporting stress relief and energy. While these effects can take a few weeks to build up, I’ve found that **adaptogens** can really help with mental clarity and energy levels over time, especially if you’re someone who gets worn out from stress. **Ginger** promotes metabolism and aids in weight loss through thermogenesis, while also helping to **stabilize blood sugar,** which can reduce hunger. **Acerola**, packed with vitamin C and antioxidants, helps curb cravings and provides a natural energy boost.

**Drawbacks**

1. **Flavor and Texture** Based on my experience with similar superfood powders, flavor can be a hit or miss. Sometimes greens blends end up tasting like a grassy, slightly bitter drink, so you might need to mix it into a smoothie with fruits to mask the taste. Be prepared to experiment a bit to find a palatable way to consume it.
2. **Proprietary Blends** Like many products in this category, the label lists the total amount of each blend rather than individual ingredient dosages. It’s hard to know exactly how much you’re getting of each ingredient, which can be frustrating if you’re looking for clinically effective doses. For example, with the green tea extract, you might not be getting the amount of EGCG that some studies link to fat-burning benefits. This isn’t unique to Nagano, other supplements like athletic greens also do it, but it’s worth noting if you prefer transparency.
3. **Not a Magic Solution** If you’re expecting dramatic weight loss or instant energy, keep in mind that no supplement can replace a healthy lifestyle. The *Nagano Japanese Lean Body Tonic* can complement a balanced diet and regular exercise, but it won’t make up for poor eating habits or lack of movement. Think of it as an added boost rather than a miracle fix.

**Overall Verdict**

If you’re already doing the basics (good diet, exercise, hydration), I think this supplement could add some extra benefits in terms of digestion, cravings & appetite suppression, stress support, and possibly metabolism. It’s also a convenient option if you find it challenging to include enough greens and probiotics in your diet naturally.

Based on everything, I’d rate it around a **4 out of 5** — it’s a well-rounded blend with the potential to enhance your wellness routine, but not necessarily a game-changer on its own.

>If you’re someone who appreciates the convenience of an all-in-one superfood powder, this could be a good fit for you. Just don’t rely on it as a sole source of nutrition, and make sure to keep realistic expectations about what it can do.

**Pros of Nagano Japanese Lean Body Tonic:**

* **Weight Loss Support**: Includes metabolism-boosting ingredients like **green tea, ginger, alfalfa and cinnamon**, which help burn calories and stabilize blood sugar.
* **Comprehensive Formula**: Combines vitamins, superfoods, adaptogens, digestive enzymes, and probiotics for broad wellness support.
* **Cost-Effective**: At about **$37 per month for a six-month supply**, it's more affordable than competitors like **AG1 (Athletic Greens)** can cost $85 per month.
* **Gut Health and Digestion**: Probiotics and enzymes support digestive health, potentially reducing bloating and improving regularity.
* **Balanced Energy**: Low caffeine content offers a gentle energy boost without jitters, ideal for those sensitive to stimulants.

**Cons of Nagano Japanese Lean Body Tonic:**

* **Proprietary Blend Transparency**: Limited information on individual ingredient dosages, making it hard to assess exact quantities.
* **Taste**: Greens powders can have a grassy or bitter taste, which may not appeal to everyone.
* **Not as Extensive as Competitors**: Some brands like **Athletic** **Greens** may offer more variety of superfoods but they're also more expensive like 2.5x**.**
* **Limited Whole-Food Fermentation**: Unlike *Garden of Life*, **Nagano** does not feature fermented ingredients, which may affect nutrient absorption for some users.

# Who should try Nagano? Ideal Use Cases for Nagano Japanese Lean Body Tonic

If you are seeking caffeine supplements for that energy kick, appetite suppression & possibly weight management, [**refer to my posts on best caffeine supplements for weight loss.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1ewmvkl/master_list_of_best_caffeine_pills_supplements/)

(*Also check out our post on fiber supplements)*.
* **If you’re aiming for general wellness and immune support** Packed with antioxidant-rich ingredients like **acerola cherry, camu camu, and spirulina,** Nagano supports immune health. It’s beneficial if you want to reinforce your body’s defenses, especially during high-stress periods or seasonal changes.

**Nagano compared with other supergreens powders: Which supergreens powder should you buy?**

**Vs YourBiology Supergreens**

Both the *Nagano Japanese Lean Body Tonic* and [***YourBiology SuperGreens***](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/ybsupergreens.php) are designed to enhance overall wellness through a blend of superfoods, digestive aids, and antioxidants. Nagano's formula emphasizes a combination of vitamins, green superfoods, natural herbs, digestive enzymes, and probiotics, aiming to support metabolism, digestion, and immune health.

In contrast, YourBiology SuperGreens offers a comprehensive mix of 24 ingredients, including superfoods like **barley grass, spirulina, and alfalfa**, along with digestive aids such as inulin and probiotics, focusing on boosting energy, digestion, and overall vitality.

For weight loss, *Nagano Japanese Lean Body Tonic* might be a better fit due to its specific focus on metabolism-boosting ingredients like green tea extract, ginger, and cinnamon, which have thermogenic and blood sugar-stabilizing properties. These ingredients can help increase calorie burn and reduce hunger, supporting weight management. *YourBiology SuperGreens* focuses more on overall energy and vitality, so while it promotes digestive health (which can indirectly support weight management), Nagano’s formula is more tailored toward direct weight loss benefits.

**Vs Athletic Greens (AG1)**

**Athletic Greens (AG1):** Known for a well-rounded formula, AG1 includes a comprehensive blend of vitamins, minerals, and adaptogens. However, some users are skeptical of its proprietary blend, as it lacks transparency on specific dosages and can feel overhyped given its high price., around $85 per month. In contrast, you can have Nagano for as low as $37 per month with 6 months supply!

**Vs Amazing Grass**

This brand includes greens, probiotics, enzymes, and fiber, which many users appreciate for digestive benefits and improved energy levels. Like Nagano, Amazing Grass is also seen as a cost-effective option with a reputation for transparency, though its taste may not appeal to everyone.

**Vs Garden of Life Perfect Food**

Garden of Life focuses on whole food ingredients and a partially fermented blend, potentially offering enhanced absorption. While its formula is similar to Nagano’s in antioxidant-rich greens, it lacks some of Nagano’s unique adaptogens and metabolic-boosting ingredients like green tea extract.

**Vs Red Dragon Nutritionals Greens**

This brand is favored by some users for reducing bloating and improving digestive regularity within a couple of weeks, with users noting it’s a budget-friendly choice. Nagano offers a broader spectrum of antioxidants, but Red Dragon is popular for its simplicity and noticeable digestive benefits and help with regularity. Nagano’s benefits are more broad and is specifically designed with weight loss benefits in mind.

**Vs Thorne Greens**

Thorne’s greens formula includes **matcha for a small caffeine boost**, which some users enjoy, though the stimulant effect may not be ideal for everyone. While Thorne is geared toward gentle energy enhancement, Nagano has a more diverse ingredient profile focused on metabolism and gut health support.",1,1730540192.0,HealthTrendz,0,1.0,False

1ghslag,https://www.reddit.com/r/doordash/comments/1ghslag/worried_that_my_shady_neighbour_will_result_in_a/,Worried that my shady neighbour will result in a Dasher getting in trouble,"Context to start us off; I live in an area that has rows of townhouses, and two separate rows share one large parking lot. My side of the street consists of an office building, a gated retirement complex, and then four of these townhouse rows. To avoid confusion, I always put a detailed description of my carport so delivery drivers get a better idea of which of the two identical houses with the same number to deliver to. Some drivers don't even read the instructions, while some thank me profusely for them.

Last week, I ordered Starbucks while working on a school project. When I get the little DING signalling my sweet sweet lifeblood has arrived, I check the app and sure enough, the driver had delivered to the wrong complex. He got the house number wrong, but it was one entire parking lot over. I sent him a message telling him it was the wrong house, and he messaged me back five minutes later telling me he would go and get it. I told him not to worry about it, that I would walk over. 

I went over, and the order is not sitting at the door. This particular neighbour has benefitted from this situation more than once. Any deliveries that have been made to him are swept into his lair, never to be seen again, and he never answers the door when you knock. So I didn't even bother trying, and contacted customer support to let them know. Got refunded, no big deal.

My dasher, the brave little toaster that he was, wound up driving to said shady neighbour's house to try and retrieve my order, despite my telling him that it was hopeless because this guy just did this, and that I had already gotten refunded. He told me that he sat there for five minutes, knocking on the door to try and get my coffee back. 

He made such a valiant effort that I don't want him to get into trouble just for making a mistake. A mistake that he *tried* to rectify. It's not his fault my neighbour is a fart whistle who has gotten more of my Amazon packages and groceries than I have.",1,1730539196.0,doordash,3,0.6,False

1ghsi0m,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlateUp/comments/1ghsi0m/noticed_limit_on_grabbers/,Noticed limit on grabbers,"Hey y'all,

so I noticed something about grabbers. Namely, that they take 2 seconds to completely pull out of or push something into a non-surface (a place where you can combine items on it). For example raw ingredient sources and Prep Stations.

At leat for raw ingredient sources, it's clear to me that grabber has to be clear in order to pull a new ingredient out of them. The interaction with prep station I have.

I noticed the prep station interaction  on my last breakfast run, as my toast would start burning a bit as my grabber finally pushed the prior toast into a prep station.

I noticed the raw ingredient interaction in my black coffee run, as there would only be one ""raw"" coffee cup in my coffee machine, grabber, coffee machine set-up.

I found video documentation of this in a automation guide.

 [TOG's video on automation basics](https://youtu.be/nW5_0gddc_I?t=863&si=1yuiPhpHKy8JMJsO)

▪️entry doors into the trailer aren’t that secured and have gaps to the outside 

▪️certain areas of the ceiling droop along the walls

▪️my bedroom window was caulked close(bf unsealed it to air out the house)

▪️Porch is definitely unsafe with rotten boards, I was told upon moving in that he would “replace the bad ones” but never happened

1ghs9dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1ghs9dt/my_experience_dating_someone_with_bpd_maybe_you/,My Experience Dating someone with BPD  (Maybe you can relate),"**Why we attract them/why we are attracted to them**

Having gone through and working through some therapy, it is clear that I attract people with this disorder. Maybe some of you can relate - but having codependent tendencies and empathetic traits; combined with a lack of self worth/self value; wanting to fill that hole in our chests with someone who makes us ""feel"" good, makes us primary targets to people with this disorder. A lot of us were raised in unstable households, and it is that instability that makes us feel comfort in the chaos - because it's familiar to us. This exact ""chaos"" is what someone with BPD will bring to our lives.

The cold hard truth is - we ignore the early onset red flags; some absolute gigantic ones that any other person would run from. Because a normal and healthy person, likely by the second or third date with a person experiencing BPD - would run. Instead - like moths to a flame, we get roped in with the idealization and love bomb phase of people with this disorder; and the chaos that brings to our lives.

In short; they make us feel a way othe*r (more normal)* people do not. Trauma bonds feel familiar to us.

**My 8 month experience dating a Person with BPD**

From the first time I saw her, I was attracted to her ""energy"". I can't explain it fully; but it was almost like I could feel some sort of energy radiating from her. She looked at me in a way other women didn't; the ""vibe"" and ""energy"" between us felt like fire. Almost like a common-understanding, without there being any reason for it.  Almost like, we had met before, but in a different lifetime. I can't really put exact words on it; but I felt like I was drawn to her.

From the first date; she brought chaos with her. Her ""abusive"" ex was spam calling her the entire time on the date. Through our conversations she opened up about some of her trauma's; she had opened up about her previous sex life with previous partners; but the depth of the conversation was on her ""abusive"" ex. She made me feel like she was ""confiding"" in me these things, that she had chosen me to confide in, that I was ""special"" enough to her to do so. Throughout the date we shared both of our experiences dating previous people; I had just came out of a relationship with a woman who had diagnosed BPD, and the same energy I had ""felt"" with her, I had felt during this date. It felt familiar, and it almost felt like I was healing through spending time with her. In reality - the same dopamine highs/low addiction my brain was healing from, was just being reactivated here; through that familiarity. Like an alcoholic, being reintroduced to alcohol - I was getting my fix.

It had been a year since I had got out of that relationship (which had lasted 2 years) and I was still in counselling and healing from it. I felt safe to confide that in this woman, because she had opened up to me about her previous ex. The same guy who was spamming her phone through the entire date.

When I went to drop her off, she had a fear that her ex might have been in the parkade (where she had parked her car) waiting. She had explained to me that he was physically abusive, that he had attacked her, assaulted her, stalked her and refused to ""let her go"". When I dropped her off we kissed, and the kiss felt cold; almost like it lacked something (genuine desire). I brushed it off thinking maybe the ""energy"" just wasn't there (even though I felt like we had it during the time we had spent together). As I was driving down the parkade, she called me in distress telling me her ex had just tried to break into her car after she got into it. I didn't see him that night at all, but I believed her story. In reality - this ""ex"" had been stalking her, and I did see him show up later in the future trying to get back with her. I gave her advice to go to the police station and report it; and stayed on the phone with her until she got home.

Right from the start - from the first date - I was introduced to this ""chaos"". Now there is no excuse for this kind of behavior in a relationship from an ""ex"" - but I also wondered what had provoked her ex to behave this way. When she would tell her story about him, she always painted herself as the victim; without seeing ""cause and effect"" towards her actions. I do not condone any form of what her ex was doing at all - period; but she refused to see how she played a role in staying in that relationship; or in creating some of the situations she found herself in with him. I obviously found out later on why this ""ex"" stalked her so heavily. During the ""break up"" periods with him, she was still sleeping with him. Less than a month and a half prior to her going on that date with me, she was in a hotel room with him after breaking up with him - having sex with him. As ""bad"" as her ex was for the things he was doing; he had reason to believe she was still interested in him by the way she had been push/pulling him through her behavior (which she would refuse to ever recognize or acknowledge). When you end a relationship with someone - it should be over; but people with BPD (as we know) hoover and refuse to let go of their favorite person (supply source) until they have found a new favorite person (supply source). I do not believe there is any justification for her exes behavior and what he was doing - and I want to make that clear; but when you attract people with dysregulated emotions; and you mess with their heads; not every person is going to respond the same to it. He was obviously addicted to the highs/lows of her and that relationship - and was not coping with that properly. As wrong as he was for the things he did to her - she played a role in creating that chaos and situation she was in with him. She would refuse to acknowledge or take any responsibility for her role in that.

I would sit for hours with her on the phone talking with her about her ex. I later found out she was confiding in other men about what she was going through with her ""ex"" too - so in reality I wasn't ""special"" this way. I later applied boundaries here when our relationship started. Still I gave her my advice, I listened to her, I provided my insight to it, I explained coping strategies and ways to deal with what she was going through, I provided ""protection"" by walking her to her car and ensuring her safety at work. I was there for her. I felt like I was ""in it"". She wanted to show her ex she was moving on; but more so, she wanted to feel safe and protected from him (that is what she sold me). The scary part? Her ex had guns. I was risking my life doing this; or at least that is what I was told by her.

Now let's talk about the sex. As most of you know, sex with a BPD person isn't like sex with other people. The sex me and her had was crazy, out of the world, insane. I won't go into too many details; but most of you probably know what I am talking about. It's almost like they ""use it"" to create that attachment. The first time I had sex with her it was wild; but after the sex had finished it missed that ""emotional"" component to it too. She was ice cold. We slept distantly, and I didn't hear from her until a day later after. This was the first time I started noticing the ""hot/cold"" response from her. She told me she didn't trust men and that I was the first man she had sex with after her ex and she didn't know how to cope with those emotions; but that it felt ""freeing"".

The next real red flag was when she kept asking me if I was going to go on a date with another woman during valentines day. I told her ""no"". Later to call her up on valentines day and find out she was going with another male coworker in the background. At this point - going through what I had gone through in the past; I ended the relationship with her immediately. We spent almost 7 days of no contact after, until she reached out to me explaining that nothing had happened with this male coworker, that she was sorry, that it ""wasn't like that"" and so on. That she had regret for even doing it. I fell into it and believed her (my mistake). This was also another sign - she was projecting her own behavior on to me.

As time went on I applied some solid boundaries; which were the same boundaries she had on me. Throughout the duration of the relationship, I would find myself routinely being compared to her ex (constantly). I found a lot of hot/cold behavior throughout the months; we would argue occasionally, but she would always try to convince me that she was ""the top 3%"" and would never ""leave me"". She told me she wanted to be ""different"" for me and wanted to prove to me that good and healthy relationships exist. She knew where to hit me, because she knew the style of relationship I had come out of. She mirrored me. I found myself always being accused of lying to her. If I talked to any ""woman"" it was a problem; yet any boundary I had set on her, she viewed as me ""being like her ex"". She was allowed to have boundaries, I wasn't - mine were always faulted. She always wanted to know where I was, we would spend hours on the phone together, she wouldn't believe me (a lot of the time). She would relate this back to her ""ex"" cheating on her, believing me to behave in the same way. She would love bomb me constantly, convince me that she wanted children and a family, and then flip on those wants and desires moment to moment (week to week). When I called out any form of inconsistency in her behavior or wants and desires; she would again paint me as her ex.

When I met her family they liked me a lot. They viewed me as a positive to her life (from what she had come out of with her ex) and I did everything in my power to show them respect. I wanted them to know that their daughter was safe, and that I wasn't going to hurt her like her ex had. As the months progressed I found her prioritizing other things over the plans we would make together, I found the emotions she had ""felt"" for me changing (up/down), we would go to make plans together just for her to change them last minute, despite us legitimately just talking about them. She would act all excited that we were going to do something, and then something else would come up and she would backtrack on those plans together. I would call her out for doing this; and it would erupt into a gigantic argument of me ""not supporting her"" or not supporting her wants etc. It was always about her (selfish). This was (devaluation). The pattern of Love Bomb>Devaluation doesn't just lead to Discard. It is constantly cycled back and forth. One day I was the love of her life, the next the energy would change drastically along with her wants/needs, and then I would find myself fighting to get that love bomb energy back. 100-0-100 (splitting). I found the more I loved her, the more I tried, the more I gave myself to her - the more she pushed away.

There came a point when I was transferring jobs to another location and she convinced me that she wanted to move with me, start a family, start a life together, get away from the drama at home, get away from the drama with her ex (who she was worried would stalk her or hurt her when I was away at training). Just for me to go out and take the job transfer and her to pull back heavily on me. Like a light switch all of her wants changed; she then told me she wanted to stay where she was, move to another area and go back to a different job (that she had left from in the past - due to her ex), that we would somehow make this long distant relationship work. It caught me completely off guard - because we went from her wanting to move out with me while I was in the training process, convincing me of this ""life"" she wanted with me, to the exact opposite. She tried breaking up with me twice during this time - and every time she came out to visit me, she always felt ""cold"" and ""distant"". Almost like she was about to break up with me.  It felt like I never knew when the end was coming, but that it was for sure coming. I even flew out back to her, spent some time with her family, and she acted distant with me around them. I would ask her ""why"" or confront the issue, and it would erupt into an argument or fight. Then we would have sex and she would be saying things like ""you'll always miss me, no one will do what I do like this"" etc. - basically making me feel like that was the last time we were going to have sex. Then after she would explain that she didn't know if she wanted the relationship or not anymore (after I had just flown out all the way to see her). She would drive me to the airport and I would feel lost, not knowing where we stood, just to get on the plane and get a call from her when I landed pretending like none of that had ever happened and that we were ""all good"". This up/down hot/cold behavior made no sense to me. It messed with me. It ate me up. I couldn't figure it out - and if I called her out on it, it would just erupt into another argument. At times she would apologize; but the apologies were never backed by anything and the behavior would never change.

When I decided to leave training and return to my previous job back home (where she lived) I made sure to make that decision without the influence of her. However; she made the training process for me extremely difficult. She would question my whereabouts at all times, she would expect me to call her before training and after training every single day. If I was 10-15 minutes late, she would accuse me of talking too much to female class mates. I would sit on the phone with her for hours neglecting my studies trying to make her feel comfortable; half of the time our phone calls would erupt into arguments because her wants/desires on us and the relationship would change. She convinced me she no longer wanted children, she wanted to stay at home and not move with me, she wanted to go back to her previous job (the one she left due to her ex). Yet weeks prior she would talk about being in fear from being ""too close to her ex"" and used that as an excuse for wanting to leave the area and come with me. It made no sense. If you were so scared of your ex, if you wanted this new life, why would you want to then return to your old life and be closer to where he was at? Why after I made the decision to leave to do this training, you then changed everything you wanted with me after I actually left? It drove me insane. It wasn't just small changes in what she wanted, it was the exact opposite direction of what she sold me,.

When I returned back home (from training) she was cold with me on the phone. Actually, when I pulled into the city that day to return to the office and grab a few things, we were supposed to meet up. But when I went to call her she ghosted my phone calls. The phone would ring, but she wouldn't answer. One thing I forgot to mention is; she always had her phone on DND around me. So a lot of the time I would call her, it would go straight to voicemail. And when I was around her, she was extremely careful and secretive with her phone. I always felt like she was talking to other people or someone else that she didn't want me to know about. So when I called her that day and it rang and went to voicemail; eventually when she did pick up she told me ""her phone was dead"". But when you ring a dead phone, it goes straight to voicemail. So I called her out and said ""well if your phone was dead, why did it ring?"" and then she would get super defensive, angry, snap at me. This caused her to leave the office (where we were going to meet up) after my 12 hour drive back to her from leaving training (and having gone over a week without seeing her). I ended up driving past her and she turned around and we met up and I called her out and asked her why she did that. How could she just leave like that?

She was just cold. I can't explain it. Earlier in the day she was excited to see me, excited for me to becoming home, excited to start a life together at home etc. But by the time I actually got home she was already driving away like I meant nothing to her. I didn't understand it, how could someone do that? Because I called her out for lying to me about her phone being dead? I hadn't seen her for a week; she just spent the morning going on about our life together.

During the week back everything felt distant and off. I ended up staying with her at her parents house, we had unprotected sex, I met her brother, bought her whole family dinner, woke up in the morning - to the evening of meeting up with her at a restaurant and her explaining to me that I was the love of her life, how she wasn't going anywhere - and so on. I would explain to her my feelings about her being a bit distant, her wants and desires changing, trying to find consistency - and she would love bomb me. That evening she was leaving for a weekend to go see her friends in another city, and I asked her if she wouldn't mind not ghosting me late at night (we always had late night goodnight phone calls) and there was this pattern of when she left on a weekend of ghosting them. She promised to me she wouldn't.

Just for me to try and get a hold of her and be ghosted and have no response or communication until hours into the night (or early morning around 1-2am) and her telling me she had fallen asleep on the couch with her friends. I would get upset at this then she would fault me for that and call me controlling. Yet if I had done the same to her, she would have lost it.

This was when the first ""real"" discard happened. You see - if I had done any of that to her she would have lost her mind. There was a day when all of the power went out in my area and I lost phone service through a night, and she had lost her mind over it - accusing me of cheating.

When she woke up that morning we had a phone call and she said ""fine I will set an alarm before I go to to sleep just so I can talk to you, are you happy now?"" attempting to make me feel bad about it. She began to paint me to her friends as some controlling boyfriend (like her ex) at this point and painted me to her councilor as that who reinforced her and told her ""you worked too hard to be put back in this situation"" I went from the love of her life a day prior, with her family, unprotected sex, talks of children -  to nothing the next day because I was upset with her that she broke a promise. All I wanted was to be able to get ahold of her late at night when she was 300km+ away. When I was in training if I had ghosted her for longer than 15 minutes it would have been a problem; but I can't get a hold of her 11pm on a Friday night while she is out with her friends to check in with her, after she promised she wouldn't ghost me like that?

She didn't even give me the decency to break up with me on the phone; no, instead she sent a long text message saying ""she wasn't the girl I wanted to be with"" ending the relationship. Keep in mind - we were together around 4 months at this point. It threw me completely off guard. Considering the love bomb the day prior, the unprotected sex, the talk of building a family together and so on - it was insane to me.

Just for her to turn up at work that Monday, with pictures of me and her on her dash window in her car, wearing the ring I had bought her. It made no sense to me - I thought we had broken up? You see people with BPD don't just ""discard"" and end a relationship normally - and this was a prime example of it. I kept thinking to myself ""is this the kind of shit she pulled with her ex? Is this why he chased so hard?"". Eventually I was able to sit down and talk with her and nothing she was saying made any sense. She loved me, she was scared of losing me - but we ""couldn't"" be together in her mind, ""it just wouldn't work"". But she wanted to spend a weekend night together still.

So after work I took her to a restaurant and attempted to convince her that what she was doing made no sense - I attempted to convince her that it made no sense. I tried to rationally and logically solve the issue - and as mad as I was about everything happening, I tried my best for her to make things work. We went to my place, we talked some more, had crazy insane sex and then she explained to me about making things work. Just for us to go to bed, wake up in the morning and her say to me while getting ready that she wanted to spend mornings together where we could just do whatever we wanted. Just for on the drive back to her car, for her to explain to me ""that she didn't want to drag me, that we shouldn't be together, she didn't want to lead me on for months just for it to all end"" etc. It made absolutely no sense to me. I was so angry and upset at that point I had dropped her off and looked at her and stated ""fine if you don't want to be with me, don't be with me, I don't want to play these games anymore"" just to get into my truck and drive away.

To then spend 2 weeks ""broken up"" almost no contact avoiding each other at work. She would ""hoover"" and attempted to make conversation, but I would ignore her. I had been in this pattern before. Eventually she approached me and asked me what I wanted her to do with the sex toys we had bought together, if I had wanted them back. This is when I broke and texted her and said ""we need to talk about workplace boundaries, this isn't working"".

During that conversation, I explained to her that I wanted the relationship with her, that I was tired of playing these games, it was either we do the relationship or we do not, and if we do not to go through some boundaries at work where we could make our work environment healthier. I was fully not expecting her to want the relationship back, but she admitted to me at this point she wanted it back, so we both chose to work at the relationship. After she would text me telling me how happy she was to have me back, how what happened would never happen again, how she missed me so much and so on. I ended up spending some time with her family again - and I could tell she had fed some narratives about me to her mother and sister that were off base with their reactions to me. I had to work hard rebuilding those relationships again.

We had a bit of a rough start with some things, but eventually we hit a really solid and secure spot in our relationship (or so I thought). There was still a lot of up and down changes in her wants, some hot/cold stuff, some push/pull stuff. I sat down and read to her a chapter about BPD and after reading it to her, and explaining to her I felt some of it related (which I know was something I maybe shouldn't have done). It actually had a positive effect. She told me she didn't want to be like that or make me feel like that; and began actively trying. Honestly we had maybe the best 2-3 weeks we ever had together. She began trying to convince me that she wanted to move in with me, she kept pushing for it over and over with me. I was hesitant because of the break up we had just gone through; she would touch the tattoo on my arm and promise on my family members name (written on the tattoo) that she wasn't going to change, that things were different this time. When I told her I needed more time she would always bring moving out together up. We would be shopping in the supermarket and she would say things like ""If we lived together we could be doing this all the time"" etc.  There was one time we were working together where she looked at me dead in the eyes and told me ""I'm not flipping, I promise you on everything"". It felt so real and so genuine - but a part of me just refused to believe it. I was waiting for the split.

Then the worst thing happened. Her brother committed suicide. I rushed to her house, picked her up off the floor and brought her to her brothers apartment. I stood by as she said her goodbyes to him with her family. I helped clear out his apartment with her. I met over 300+ of her close family members and friends. I gave up everything I could to help her - and through the process of doing so she began to devalue me. She talked about marriage she had promised another man back in the day right in front of me - to him, she hid the fact she had a shared tattoo on her body with another man, she tried to convince me (during sex) that the person calling her phone was her ""mom"" coming up with a false narrative, later to admit to me it was another man calling her and texting her for emotional support. I gave everything I could to be there for her during this week, sacrificing sleep, working long hours and returning to her - and I felt trapped. I was catching her in lies, and I felt like I couldn't leave her because of what had just happened. I felt bad for her and her family. I tried my best for them - and when I went to defend my boundaries against these things; she pushed those boundaries in the incorrect way to her family members (her sister primarily) and painted me as something I was not. I attended her brothers celebration of life with her, held her hand - I was included in the eulogy speech about her brother by her mother.  And then - I was cut and completely pushed by her directly after. Like nothing.

I spent almost 2 weeks in no contact. I had nobody to talk to about what I had just gone through, what I had just experienced, what I had just seen. She was the victim to it all -  I was the ""bad guy"" to her for pushing her ""over"" after the death of her brother - because I defended my boundaries and stood up for our relationship and against being lied to. She began the process of ""throwing monkeys"" by painting me as something I wasn't to her family - she devalued everything I had gone through and experienced for her. After meeting everyone in her life, going through what I just went through with her - she discarded me like nothing.

I ended up contacting her at the 1 month anniversary point to which her brother had died, to make sure she was okay. I felt like I needed to know that - after everything. We spent 5+ hours on the phone talking that night. She explained to me she loved me, she explained to me she missed me, we talked about her brother (who I had met) - I excused her poor behavior towards me, because I empathized with how hard it would be to lose a family member. I had my own experiences with losing people to suicide - and it hit me hard too. I felt bad for her. But despite it all - she explained to me that a relationship with me just wasn't possible. That she loved me but it wouldn't work. That I had ""pushed her over"". We spent that week every single night talking on the phone, she would love bomb me throughout - but she would continue to remind me that we are not together.

She ended up going to a concert with her mother - and during this point she would tell me she wanted to meet up with me ""be in my arms again"" when she came back. She actually told me she could see her ex off in the distance in the crowd at the concert, that she was ""scared""; she sent me pictures and I kept in contact with her trying to emotionally support her through that. It made no sense for me though on why or how her ex would just show up like that at the concert - they also had no contact conditions from the courts. Just more ""chaos"".  She would take pictures of the stuffed animal I had bought her and send them to me. I would explain to her that ""I can't do this"" I didn't feel comfortable being in this situation with her, having her but not ""having her"" essentially being treated like I was not worth a relationship, but giving her the benefits and commitment of one. She would communicate to me that she felt the same way as I did and that we would work through it. Just for a night later and a drive home later to get on the phone with me and tell me ""I don't see a relationship with us ever happening again"". I couldn't figure out how her mind could change so fast, or so quickly. I would relate it back to maybe her mother talking to her; or all the things she painted our relationship out to being (to her family) and due to the bad experience with her ex, them trying to protect her from it happening again. You see - I was always up against the past with her ex, I was always painted like him by her, I was always thrown into that same ""ring"". And I know in her previous relationship she defended him to her family, and her family became distant to her because of it. I think she was scared of that happening again. I don't know - but then a part of me felt like if someone truly loved you, they would just be with you without the confines and opinions of other people; they would defend you. I guess this was a part of the love bomb>devaluation process. I mean she convinced me she wanted to spend a night with me, wanted to be in my ""arms again"" and then when the day we were supposed to spend together approached closer, she would then tell me ""it's too soon, I can't do it"". Her words and actions never aligned.

I cut her out and told her I couldn't keep doing this with her (up/down hot/cold) that I did everything I could for her and that I was sorry for the mistakes I had made. We went another week or so without contact, but I reached out again to her because I wanted to make sure when she returned to work that everything would be good between us - that it would be a healthy return for her to work. And I wanted to talk about everything we had gone through. She agreed and we set up a date to meet.. We sat down with each other and just talked and I explained to her I was sorry for the mistakes I had made (I felt like I was at fault for everything). She again explained to me how much she loved me, how much she missed me, how scared she was of me moving on, how she always thinks about me (love bomb). But that she couldn't do a relationship with me. She admitted to wanting to have sex with me again. She wanted the loyalty, sex and intimacy without the terms or definition of a relationship. Again - I had been here before in my previous relationship and I hated the idea of it. But because of that addiction to the up/down cycle with her I agreed that it might be possible. The truth is I just wanted a part of her in my life again - I kept dropping my boundaries (and I regret that).

We spent another 8 days of no contact after this point and she returned to work. Because of the 8 days of no contact, and not hearing from her, I had figured everything she had said when we met up previously was thrown out the window. Eventually she approached me and said ""No good morning?"" and attempted to get into my spaces (hoovering). Eventually I bit and again the energy shifted - but this time back into what we had been doing before (while in a relationship). We began having coffee dates with each other, we began talking about sex, we were telling each other we love each other, we were having our late night phone calls - everything got built back up to exactly what it (almost) was prior to the relationship ending - but again, she would tell me ""we are not together"". I felt like I was going crazy - she was enjoying me chasing after her almost. She admitted to me the things she said about us to her sister/family - how she painted our relationship to them. She used this as an excuse why we can't be together. She said it wouldn't be ""fair to me"". I explained to her that I was willing to work at a relationship with her without any of the added pressures, but she refused. I felt like I was going crazy - how can you say to someone ""we are not together"" than simultaneously in your next breath say ""I love you"".? She would constantly reaffirm to me that there was no other ""man"" that there was no other person. That she wasn't trying to look open. Yet she would stalk my social media accounts and fault me for my follower count going up during the break up - yet hers went up by over 40-50 followers. It made no sense to me. She would tell me she wanted to be in my arms, yet wouldn't commit to a day for it to actually happen. She told me she believed relationships should just ""fit"" that they shouldn't require ""much work"". She viewed my boundaries as wrong, yet her boundaries were harder than mine ever were. If I tried to talk to her about what relationships are, how you don't ""find a person"" you must work at relationships for them to work, if I explained my feelings she would tell me I was ""lecturing her"". If I called her out on her behavior and what she was doing, she would tell me ""I made her feel worthless"". If I expressed my feelings, I was wrong for doing so because her brother had just died and it ""pushed her over"". Yet she would tell me she loves me, sext me, send me pics of herself, be insecure about me potentially moving on or who I was talking to, constantly communicate with me throughout the day, accuse me of seeing other women - and so on.

I was losing my mind. None of it made any sense to me. Eventually we settled on a day to spend at a hotel across the street from work. It only worked for her because her family would track her location, and she could come up with an excuse on having to spend the night there for ""work"". I asked her if she would be interested in doing therapy with me (with my councilor) and working through these problems and she said yes. She would apologize for everything she had done and then draw and pull me in again. She complained I stopped sending her goodnight texts (after our phone call) so I sent her one, which she then ghosted throughout the next day. When I called her out on that, she would tell me she was busy and didn't look at her phone (yet I knew she looked at her phone in the morning). I felt like she was messing with me, yet she would reaffirm to me she wasn't. 2 days prior to us having our ""hotel night"" she would go on about how excited she was, but as the days became closer she would become more distant. She became snappy with me - she told me she was worried that it would be the ""last night we spent together"" that she didn't want me to ""use her"". I would tell her it wasn't and that we would continue working at things. But the next day we would get into an argument about something regarding why we had broke up, and then she would tell me ""I want it to be our last night together, I don't want to do this anymore"". Almost like she had to be the one to discard me. Again - it made no sense.

We went to spend that night together, but prior to it we walked up to my truck and she noticed an iPhone charging cable in my truck. She then accused me of having other women in my truck. I explained to her that I had always carried iPhone cables because my best friend has an iphone and that was never an issue in the past. Yet she refused to believe me. I walked with her to the hotel and the vibe was completely off. We had our crazy insane sex and after her sister texted her asking her where she was, if she was ""with me"". She laid next to me and told me it wasn't a good idea that we spend the night together now. That she didn't like lying to her family - almost like she blamed me for that. I couldn't understand it - a week of telling me how excited she was to spend the night with me, to having sex, to now telling me she essentially wanted me to leave the room. I would try to explain to her how ridiculous this all was; how she shouldn't have painted me that way to her family; but she wouldn't listen. She again viewed that as me ""lecturing her"" and making her ""feel bad"". The selfishness in it.

Then we had sex again that night, and after things got even worse. I tried again to explain to her what relationships were, that what we were doing was a relationship. How couldn't she see that? Yet she kept telling me how bad she felt, that she hated herself, that she was wrecking my life. I told her I didn't want to sleep in a bed next to a woman who I loved, who didn't see me with the worth or value of a relationship. I went to leave, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. I saw her sitting on the edge of the bed slumped down in sadness. She told me she wished she could die, but she can't do that to her family after what her brother had done. I couldn't leave her like that, so I came back to her and said ""I can't leave. She then told me ""if you don't leave, I will, I can't do this"". She then refused to leave herself and laid back down in the bed. Then I laid next to her and held her and explained to her that I loved her. I had to come ""to her"" to do that. I was going to wait until she fell asleep to leave the room, but then as I got up to leave she grabbed me and held me and told me she loved me.

We fell asleep and in the morning she told me how sad she was, how broken she was, how she wanted this to be over, how she wanted me gone, how she wanted this to end. When we got up to leave in the morning she started crying. I tried again explaining to her this was all self destructive, I again tried to save the relationship. Nothing I said mattered. I held the door open for her and she looked at me and said ""fuck"" and kissed me. I stayed at the door watching her wait for the elevator down, for her to come back to the door and kiss me again. Then leave to the elevator. Gone - like nothing.

She sent me a text message apologizing for everything, telling me she hates herself, telling me she doesn't want to hurt another person like she has me again, how I am a good man, how she was loyal to me the entire time, there was no on else, how she wants me to have a good life and peace without her.

I've seen an ENT for it, but it was some boomer that told me that only a surgeon could consider this and that it probably wouldn't be covered, so I've had shitty medical advice so far on the issue.

I (21 F) have a bsf (22 F) let's call her Ari. We met during our senior highschool and remained bsf throughout college. We've seen each other at our highest and lowest point in our lives, so basically we know each other well.

Recently I feel like she's distancing herself from me and I had no idea why. I figured maybe she just wants to be alone and recharge her social battery from her social festivities.

First time I felt it was the time when our close friend, let's call her Jia (F 21) asked us to hangout at 2pm since we haven't seen each other in a long time. However, earlier that day I had to go to a university for my research, so I was a little busy but decided to say yes bcs I missed them too.

I told them I might be a little late bcs I had errands to run and I haven't eaten anything yet. They said its fine and they totally understand and they'll just stay in Ari's house since their house is closer to the mall. I prepped and, later updated them that I was alr on Ari's street and I waited for another 20-25 mins for them. 

When they arrived I told them ""ang tagal nyo naman"" then Ari replied ""ikaw nga hinintay namin dyan ikaw pa nagrereklamo"". 
I was quite shocked when she snapped at me, so I thought I was being a bitch so I kinda deserved it. 

When we arrived at the mall she was OBVIOUSLY distancing herself from me and she'd walk alone or w/ Jia but not w/ me. I thought it was weird. After walking around, we went to an empty parking lot to chill and catch up w/ each other's lives. I started to feel uncomfortable with Ari because everytime I speak she looks like she's so done with me and is already bored w/ my stories HAHA. It's like I already yapped her ears off xDD. 

After our yapping sesh we all went home and I confronted her about the things that bothered me and she said I shouldn't take it personally. So I shrugged it off but I was literally weirded out

Days later, Jia and I decided to have some coffee tgt and she confessed that the day we all went to the mall Ari knew I was alr on their street and said 

A: hayaan mo syang maghintay dyan.
J: kanina pa sya dun
A: hayaan mo sya dun. Okay lang yun, kaya nya naman maghintay. 

And to be completely honest, it wasnt the first time she made me wait. It's ALWAAYYSS HAPPENING. I feel like she doesn't respect me anymore as a friend. It may seem shallow and mababaw but I was really hurt bcs we already talked abt it before. We had 'bsf date' planned for my birthday she was an hour late. I told her I feel disrespected and she apologized, only to find out she's been doing it on purpose. Really breaks my heart because it feels like she's taking me for granted. I dont want our 6 years of friendship go down the drain.

But I also want your opinion if I'm just making a big deal out of nothing or am I being too childish about all this? ",2,1730536696.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

I have been living in South East Asia for the last few years, after moving from a western country.

What I like about SEA is the availability of bubble tea in many flavours. I have come to love bubble tea I drink it everyday (Lychee Green Tea my fave). They are so refreshing and make me feel good.

Another thing I love about SEA is that alcohol is not in your face all the time (apart from South Korea/Japan). In thailand, the tourist and expats are the biggest drinkers. 

I love my bubble tea, it is one of the things i look forward to now. If you are in a place that has bubble tea, give it a try - it is way better than coffee much more pleasant and quenches your thirst.",3,1730536128.0,stopdrinking,1,1.0,False

Three weeks into parenthood, my arms had developed a permanent bouncing motion. I caught myself swaying in the grocery store checkout line – without the baby. That's when I knew I had to do something. So, I decided to try out this Graco DuetConnect LX, here's what happened.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

The assembly instructions appear to have been written by a very talented cat walking across a keyboard. Pro tip: Skip the paper manual entirely and head straight to YouTube. Even then, it took me 40 minutes and several creative new curse words before the DuetConnect was all put together.

But once you've conquered Mount Assembly (and maybe had a good cry in the process), you're left with something that actually looks... pretty impressive.

# Key Features

**The Two-in-One Situation:** Remember in college when you had that friend who could transform their futon from couch to bed in seconds? This is like that, but actually useful. The seat pops out to become a bouncer faster than you can say ""please stop crying, mommy needs coffee."" This feature alone has saved my biceps. The transition is smooth enough that you can do it one-handed while holding a phone, bottle, or your sanity – dealer's choice.

**The Multi-Directional Swing:** Your baby can face any way they want, which turns out to be surprisingly important when you discover your little one has stronger opinions about viewing angles than a film school graduate. The six-speed settings go from gentle breeze  to moderate wind gust, though sadly there's no ""simulate driving down a bumpy road at 2 am"" setting.

**The Entertainment Package:** Ten melodies and five nature sounds that, miraculously, won't make you want to relocate to a silent monastery after the first hour. The mobile toys are actually engaging enough to keep baby's attention for more than 3.5 seconds – which in baby time is basically an eternity.

**Power Options (or: The Battery Saga):** You can either plug this into the wall or use batteries. Choose wisely, because those batteries will become your new monthly budget line item, right between ""coffee"" and ""therapy."" The plug option is clutch for long-term use, but the battery option means you can set up your baby-soothing command center anywhere in the house.

**Construction Quality:** The frame is sturdy enough to survive the apocalypse, or at least the first year of parenthood (same thing, really). The seat pad looks like it could handle a Category 5 diaper blowout, and the mechanics are smoother than my pre-baby social life.

# The Real-World Test

Over three weeks of intense testing (read: desperate attempts to get literally anything done), here's what actually matters:

# Pros

* The swing-to-bouncer transition is smoother than my attempt to explain to my childless friends why I can't stay out past 7pm anymore
* Build quality that makes you feel like you didn't completely waste your money
* Multiple speeds that actually make a difference
* Sound quality that won't make your ears bleed after eight straight hours
* Power cord option saves you from becoming a battery hoarder
* Seat pad is machine washable because Graco apparently understands that babies are tiny chaos agents

# Cons

* Assembly process might make you question every life choice that led to this moment
* Takes up more floor space than your first apartment
* The instruction manual appears to have been written by someone who's never seen a baby or a swing
* Price tag makes you cry a little (but honestly, what baby item doesn't?)

# Who Should Buy This:

* Parents who occasionally need their arms back
* Anyone who's ever tried to eat while holding a baby
* People with enough floor space for a small command center
* Those who appreciate good engineering but don't mind some assembly drama

# Who Should Skip It:

* Minimalists living in micro-apartments
* People who haven't made peace with the fact that baby gear will take over their home
* Anyone who throws their back out assembling IKEA furniture

A quick summary.
After a work party, where we were both drinking my work crush drunk texted and confessed that he wanted to kiss me that night. 

It’s a complicated situation where we can’t really pursue a relationship so we decided to not act on what he said. 

Since that night, we’ve had a few ups and downs. After his confession I realised I also had serious feelings towards him which I’d subconsciously suppressed earlier, which then came to the forefront. 

So I tried to ice him out, cut off all non work related conversations, started chats to understand where he stands and also to self preserve so that I don’t develop more serious attachment. During this whole phase he acted nonchalant and told me to not bring up this topic of conversation again since we can’t act on it.   After this rough patch and fighting I gave up and stopped giving a sh1t and that’s when he turned around and started texting me everyday, asked me to do drinks + dinner, started caring etc. We started texting daily, doing occasional coffees, spending a lot of time in office together etc. friendly but a little more than that 


Over the last 10 days we were both home for festive holidays and he barely texted me, like not even 2-3 messages during 2 weeks. But he kept on sending me Instagram reels once a day. I understand family time is important, but not even getting one text a day while we were attached to the hip in office, was quite off putting.

1) I would appreciate some insights into his behaviour. 
2) I also don’t want to beg for attention or initiate anything since he’s not 100% into me. What’s the best way to give up on him and move on once I’m back to office ",1,1730535547.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

He was sitting at a table covered in exotic meals, a lot of them moulded gelatin or aspic dishes. I think the man might have had a moustache and maybe olive or brown skin, but I’m not sure on those ones. 

I don’t remember anything about the song at all, just this hazy memory formed while I was only half awake. I hadn’t heard the song on the radio so it may have been from a lesser-known artist, or just one that didn’t get played much in New Zealand.

Renters insurance is a policy designed to protect individuals renting their living space, whether an apartment, house, or condo. It provides financial protection against unexpected events such as theft, fire, and certain types of water damage. Here’s a closer look at what [**renters insurance**](https://wpinsurances.com/about-us/) entails and why it’s a crucial consideration for renters.

# What is Renters Insurance?

**Renters insurance, also known as tenant insurance, typically includes three main types of coverage:**

**Personal Property Coverage:** This protects your personal belongings such as furniture, electronics, clothing, and other possessions against perils like fire, theft, and vandalism. The coverage extends to your items both inside and outside your rental unit. For instance, if your laptop is stolen while you’re at a coffee shop, renters insurance would cover the loss.

**Liability Coverage:** This protects if you’re held legally responsible for injuries to other people or damage to their property. For example, if someone slips and falls in your apartment and sues you for medical expenses, liability coverage can help cover those costs, as well as legal fees.

**Additional Living Expenses (ALE) Coverage:** If your rental unit becomes uninhabitable due to a covered event, ALE coverage helps pay for temporary living arrangements, such as a hotel stay, and additional expenses like meals.

# Why Do You Need Renters Insurance?

While some renters may assume their landlord’s insurance covers their personal belongings, this is a common misconception. Landlord insurance typically covers only the building structure, not the tenants’ personal property. Here’s why you should consider renters insurance:

**Protection of Personal Belongings:** Personal items can be expensive to replace if damaged or stolen. Renters insurance ensures you’re not left with the full financial burden of replacing these items out of pocket.

**Liability Protection:** Accidents happen, and if someone is injured in your rental or if you accidentally cause damage to someone else’s property, you could be held liable. Liability coverage can protect you from substantial financial loss due to legal claims and medical bills.

**Affordability:** Renters insurance is generally affordable, often costing less than a dollar daily. The peace of mind it offers in protecting your belongings, and financial well-being far outweighs the cost.

**Requirement by Landlords:** Increasingly, landlords require tenants to carry renters insurance as a lease condition. This requirement ensures that the tenant’s belongings and liability are covered, reducing potential conflicts and financial risks.

**Coverage Beyond the Home:** Renters insurance covers your belongings at home and when you’re traveling or outside your rental. This extended coverage provides added security and peace of mind.

**Natural Disasters:** Depending on the policy, renters insurance can cover certain natural disasters like fire and windstorms. If you live in an area prone to specific risks, such as earthquakes or floods, you can often add additional coverage to your policy.

# Conclusion

Renters insurance is a critical financial protection component for anyone renting a home. It covers your personal belongings, provides liability protection, and helps with additional living expenses in case of a covered event. Despite its comprehensive coverage, renters insurance is typically affordable, making it a smart investment for peace of mind and financial security. Whether required by your landlord or chosen voluntarily, securing renters insurance ensures you are well-protected against the unexpected.
