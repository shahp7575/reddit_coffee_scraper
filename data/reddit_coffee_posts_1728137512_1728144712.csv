I even broke out an incense, walked as long as I managed (2 km). Thought I had done what catches I needed, then lo and behold I need to catch more Sewaddles on the last page. After the spawn period. 

Not like this is the first time thins has happened, I hav a list of uncompleted ""community day"" research that just taunt me from the list.
Because it's not like there is more than a spawn in a full moon to help me complete these.

Well, I know for sure how enticed I'm in joining future ""community days"" when being a rural player.

1fwtrv7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1fwtrv7/update_leaving_live_in_bf_of_4_years/,Update; leaving live in bf of 4 years,"I posted awhile ago to get encouragement to break up with my bf. His behavior had become extremely toxic and I was tired of it. For more context I've still got the post up. 

I was so determined. I know that I am soft and too nice. It did me in again. 
I had the new lease signed in my name only I came home from work on the friday the kids went to their dads so they wouldn't be around for any drama. I got home and my bf was waiting with the tv off and sitting on his couch. I sat on my couch. It took me a second to get past the lump in my throat and the tears that were welling but I finally choked out that he needed to move out. 
The conversation was civil albeit emotional with tears as I laid out exactly how Id been feeling and why I wanted him to leave. I know now that I still care a lot about him because as we talked he begged for another chance. He said loosing me terrified him and he swore he'd change. He said he'd move out if I wanted him to but asked about our relationship. 

Needless to say he wore me down. I agreed that if he started taking his antidepressants and go to therapy and start addressing his struggles that i would give him another chance. He was great that first weekend after our hard talk. And my desire for him to leave faded. I do still love him, i feel so weak because of it. 

He has kept his word. He's gone to therapy and he is taking his meds. He hasnt been passive aggressive or out of line. 

BUT he has gone back to all but ignoring me for video games. I hadn't mentioned that in my previous post I dont think but definitely another strain on the relationship is how little romance and time together there is. 

Now I am not someone who needs a lot. A walk together. A coffee date. An activity at home would be cool. We have a lot of similar interests. 

He was great that first weekend after our hard talk and he actually made me feel like I was his gf for the first time in a long time. 

But its gone right back to me feeling like I have a roommate. I am tired of asking to be made to feel special. To feel that he actually wants to spend time with me. 

So I am now again unhappy with the relationship. 
The other night something happened that pissed me off so much. It seems small and silly but it echoed 4 years of repeat behavior from him. 
We've had several petty crimes happen where we live. Break ins to cars and license plates stolen etc. I told him I wanted to leave the porch light on to deter anyone messing with my car. Its not brand new or fancy but I dont have a security camera and I still owe 20k on the loan. Replacing license plates or whatever is something on top of how strained i am right now time wise emotionally and financially. I realize a light wont stop theives but it was the only proactive thing I could do. 
He agreed to leave the porch light on. 

Well right before bed he goes to check the locks which he does. I didn't think anything of it because I trusted him. Next morning I wake up and go downstairs to start my day and see the light is off. 
To say I was pissed is light. It was such a small ask! His truck is parked in front of a neighbors camera so he doesn't worry. This was all I had asked. 
I went up stairs and asked him why he turned the light off When I specifically asked him to leave it on. 
His excuse was he didn't want my 20$ halloween wreath to be stolen -_-
20$ wreath vs a 20k car -_- 
I knew the wreath is out there. I dont care if its stolen  I would just make another. If have any outdoor decor accept that it may go missing. 
Anyways he started going on about how he'll never do it again but the damage was done. I told him if he was going to be disrespectful to my face to fuck off and do it elsewhere that i was sick and tired of his behavior. 
Important to know that he has done shot like this before. I'll ask him to leave something I'll give him my reasons and he'll go behind my back and change it. I am fucking sick of it. I dont do this to him. Ever. 

So I am exactly where I was a month ago. Im afriad thay therapy and meds wont save this. I am so angry at him ignoring me and disrespecting me. I do still love him but at this point I have to choose my love for him and misery or my self respect and a broken heart. 

I had given him another chance and he surely blew it. 
I messaged some friends to see if I was being dramatic and they both agreed it was not cool of him and that the relationship has run its coarse. 

So I am doing it reddit. I will be back to update and hold myself accountable to you. I will not be talked out of it again. üò§ ",2,1728144372.0,AskWomenOver30,1,1.0,False

1fwtqv2,https://i.redd.it/rz3jzsd9oysd1.jpeg,Fianc√© makes me feel unsupported and like I‚Äôm crazy‚Ä¶ am I? ,"For context, I am 30 weeks pregnant and have a toddler as well. The morning this happened, our son had woken up at 3:30am so obviously I had to get up with him. My fiance often times gets up in the middle of the night and sleeps in another room because my snoring has gotten so bad (lol), so needless to say it was just me in there with our son. As yall already know, sleep is a really tough time. My hips hurt constantly, I have terrible heartburn, I‚Äôm peeing all the time, and I can never get comfortable with this giant tummy of mine, so I pretty much stay exhausted because of this. I think I‚Äôd also gone to sleep around midnight when this happened so I pretty much got a lousy nap. I didn‚Äôt wake him up because he works and I don‚Äôt (I‚Äôm in nursing school). 

Anyway, that morning my son had been super fussy and I was exhausted, but I had gotten up to get a bottle for him. While I was in the kitchen getting it ready, my fiance comes in and offers to make it since he usually does if our son needs one around that time so I don‚Äôt have to get out of bed. But since I was already wide awake and more than halfway done with the process I said (probably in a groggy/slightly frustrated tone) ‚ÄúI got it, I‚Äôve been up almost four hours anyway‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt say anything, and I walked out after it was made. I came back in after a few minutes to get myself some water, and he was sitting on the couch with his coffee and phone, watching tv. I intentionally took my time just to see if he‚Äôd say ANYTHING at all‚Ä¶ask a question about our son, how I am, good morning, sorry, ANYTHING. nope. Didn‚Äôt even look up from his phone. So I just went back to the room and ended up texting him that message (I was crying at this point, and am again now as I type this because I just feel so overwhelmed and lonely). I‚Äôve expressed to him so many times before and during this pregnancy that even if I may seem to be in a not so great mood, it most likely has nothing to do with him and I could use some sort of support or compassion. My emotions are a bit high strung due to the pregnancy and exhaustion I experience being the primary caregiver for our child. And you see the response I got (and how I predicted it before he ever responded). He has a way of saying it‚Äôs my fault for not getting anything outta him because if I‚Äôm in a bad mood that‚Äôs completely unrelated to him, he takes my tone of voice as some sort of personal attack on him if I don‚Äôt come across like I‚Äôm completely fine. So he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt mess with me‚Äù as he likes to say. I just feel really hurt by all of this, like I have to walk on eggshells around him and can‚Äôt be a human being, much less a hormonal pregnant one with real feelings and emotions. I ended up calling him after this and we argued, and haven‚Äôt spoken since (it‚Äôs day 3). I called him narcissistic, and he gets bent out of shape when I ‚Äúname call‚Äù but he calls my crazy. I‚Äôve been on the fence about ending our relationship for a while now, but I got pregnant again and wanted it to work since we have 2 kids now. I just feel like he doesn‚Äôt understand me, doesn‚Äôt want to, or doesn‚Äôt care. Regardless, I feel alone emotionally a lot and he doesn‚Äôt change. Also, since the argument he hasn‚Äôt interacted with our son. He came home from work and locked himself away in our room for the whole day, didn‚Äôt even say hi to our son and that broke my heart. Every time we argue he stays away from me, and because our son is always with me he stays away from him too. Sorry this is a lot to read I just needed to vent, and maybe someone can tell me if I‚Äôm the problem or not. Am I crazy and expecting too much? ",1,1728144299.0,BabyBumps,0,1.0,False

(Throwaway account because I don‚Äôt want people to find this post)

I‚Äôve been with my bf for almost 5 years and we‚Äôve been living together for 3. There‚Äôs been so much shit going on between us for the last two years.. I don‚Äôt even know where to start. I feel like I‚Äôm going insane. 

Context: this morning I woke up to great, sunny weather and I really hoped to go do something outside! I knew he probably wasn‚Äôt feeling up to it and my other friends don‚Äôt have time. I got sad over it and a little panicky, which made me sigh/breathe loudly sometimes while I was trying to figure out my plans..  Ge noticed and asked me what‚Äôs wrong. I tried to be as non-pushy as possible: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd really like to go do something today, but my friends don‚Äôt have time so if you feel like doing something let me know!‚Äù He said he didn‚Äôt know yet and we went to the grocery store. 

We‚Äôve been trying to quit smoking weed for a long time. Today would‚Äôve been the day we wouldn‚Äôt smoke. We went grocery shopping and when we got home I went into the kitchen to make some coffee. While I was doing this he walked into the kitchen and told me he didn‚Äôt want to blame me, but because of me showing and taking about my emotions this morning, he feels like he can‚Äôt quit today. I got upset over this and told him I wouldn‚Äôt have talked about this if he did not ask. Then he got really defensive and it turned into a fight. 

When he‚Äôs upset with me he puts down a lot of boundaries, shows his irritation and puts a lot of blame on me. I don‚Äôt feel secure within myself so when he defends himself I usually start to question myself and my reality / experience. These fights usually ends up with me taking the blame and putting my emotions aside. This makes me feel like I‚Äôm going insane because our views on the events  are always so different. It‚Äôs seems as if there are two options: either he‚Äôs been manipulating me and putting me down OR I‚Äôm way more unstable than I thought I was. He says I am, and I try to accept that and take my responsibility. Which seems like the right thing to do when someone tells me I hurt them. 

When I try to talk to him about the way he‚Äôs treating me and how he‚Äôs hurt me he usually tells me a quick , irritated sorry before going on and on about how his behaviour is my fault. I can‚Äôt tell him he‚Äôs taking no responsibility because then he just deflects and gets more irritated, telling me he did do those things because of my behaviour and that I‚Äôm making him crazy by going on and on about it. While I don‚Äôt feel like he even tried to make me feel better. Could it be that I‚Äôm really that sick in the head that nothings good enough for me? It just doesn‚Äôt seem right.

I have no idea how many details are relevant so I just added anything I could think to add. It may not all be important, but it‚Äôs all still very fresh on my sleep deprived mind so I just wrote what I could think of

So I (26M)have a coworker  (23F) at the small local coffee shop I work at (I think we have 10 employees) who I considered myself to be pretty close with. Especially about a year ago we really did hang out quite a lot, and even as early as a year and a half ago out of the 2 years I‚Äôve known her we would occasionally hang out. While it didn‚Äôt end up happening, she also tried to plan a like weekend trip with her, myself, and a couple other coworkers to Denver once. We had a pretty big gap at the beginning of this year where we didn‚Äôt hang out, but that was mostly just stuff in my life getting in the way, so I hit her up in July seeing if she wanted to get a drink and catch up. She accepted and we planned on going after work one day, but we had to reschedule (can‚Äôt remember why) but she suggested we go watch movies at her apartment. So we got there and I met her mom and we all watched deep blue sea 1 and 2. Her mom bought me dinner which was very nice, and I probably was there until about midnight. Then we ended up getting drinks within a few days, and we haven‚Äôt hung out since. That was in July. 

Recently I‚Äôve noticed that she had been kinda distant at work (for example, we used to chat when she was done with her shift and I was getting in, and she always goes around to everyone who is working and says bye and gives them hugs, but recently she stopped talking to me and giving me a hug before leaving, she just kinda waves bye and leaves) so, I texted her essentially asking if I had upset her, or if not if there was any insight she could give me as to why she seemed to be distancing herself from me, since I knew she hadn‚Äôt tried to make any plans recently with me, and every time I texted her I‚Äôd get left on delivered after a single message, so I couldn‚Äôt make plans.  Her response was essentially saying she was uncomfortable with me flirting with her, that she hasn‚Äôt been prioritizing hanging out with people from work (even though a few weeks back she went and saw a movie with a few coworkers, literally the day before she messaged me this she also saw another movie with at least one of those coworkers, and she‚Äôs planning on taking a trip out of state in November to go visit one of our old coworkers who moved), and that she values our friendship professionally and as coworkers. Without going into too much detail into how I responded (I had a lot to say), I essentially said ‚Äúhey you know we‚Äôre more than just coworkers at this point? We‚Äôve had several one on one hangouts outside of work, one literally at your apartment that ended up also being with your mom‚Äù I also brought up that to say she isn‚Äôt prioritizing hanging out with coworkers while actively doing so with others does make it seem kinda like she just isn‚Äôt prioritizing hanging out with me. On the note of flirting, I did note that I could be unintentionally kinda flirty and I would try to avoid doing so, but I also am just kinda flirty with everyone. But maybe more importantly, so is she. She is a huge casual flirt, which doesn‚Äôt bother me in the slightest except for when you‚Äôre gonna say my flirting makes you uncomfortable. I also brought up that her behavior towards me was fairly sudden, and she really only seems to treat me differently when there are others around. When it‚Äôs just the two of us, she was once again back to just being what felt like a relatively close friend. 

Her response was that she doesn‚Äôt have to defend how she spends time with coworkers (I didn‚Äôt ask her to, I was just pointing out that she was while also saying she wasn‚Äôt prioritizing it), telling me that it puts her in an uncomfortable position when I flirt with her, citing me telling her things like ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been on my mind lately‚Äù or ‚ÄúI had a dream about you‚Äù (things I tell people who I at least assume I have a somewhat close relationship with. That one isn‚Äôt even just reserved for my super close friends, I have several old coworkers who I just like to let know I‚Äôve been thinking about them because why wouldn‚Äôt I?), and that literally she just has a professional coworker relationship with everyone and none of us really know her deep enough to get mad that she won‚Äôt hug us or hangout (though I assume most of those people would also be upset to be told that essentially she doesn‚Äôt care about their friendship much. I‚Äôm also not mad, just confused and hurt) 

I responded by addressing all of those points much like I did parenthetically but more in depth, as well as pointing out that she never really addressed anything I actually said. So I told her that she shouldn‚Äôt respond if she‚Äôs not going to address my concerns, such as ‚Äúwhy did you not bring any of this up when it started bothering you? Why did I have to essentially get pseudo ghosted by you to know there‚Äôs a problem‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy all of a sudden is any of this an issue, as I‚Äôve not really changed how I interact with you the entire time I‚Äôve known you and we‚Äôve literally never had a problem‚Äù 

Then lastly (the actual part that may be an overreaction) I told her that if she doesn‚Äôt even see us as real friends outside of just being a coworker that occasionally you‚Äôll hang out with, instead of someone who you actually really enjoy being around and care about outside of our job, to not even respond. I‚Äôve got nothing else to say to her if that‚Äôs the case. I just told her to bring the few things of mine that she has to our job (a book I was letting her borrow and a guitar I had asked her to paint as a little art project, both of which I only did because I was under the impression she was my friend). I told her we could be friendly at work, but I truly want nothing to do with her outside of work if she doesn‚Äôt see me as a friend. AIO?

TLDR: I have a coworker that despite it seeming like we were quite close has claimed that we aren‚Äôt really friends outside of our coworker relationship, so I told her that I only want to have a friendly relationship at work, and to leave me alone otherwise. She literally has tried to make weekend plans involving me and some other coworkers, and I have hung out with her just the two of us several times, including one time where her mom joined us.

* **Follow-up interactions:**¬†Use these venues to collect contacts and continue conversations later, either online or in person.

# Tap into Your Personal Network

Never underestimate the power of your existing network. Reach out to friends, former colleagues, or family members who might have connections in the areas you‚Äôre visiting.

* **Ask for introductions:**¬†A simple message can go a long way. People are often happy to connect you with someone they know.
* **Schedule catch-ups:**¬†If someone you know is based near your destination, meet for a coffee to share experiences and make new connections.

# Stay Open and Approachable

While all these strategies work, remember that your attitude plays a massive role in networking. Stay open and approachable. Smile and show interest when meeting new people. A friendly demeanor encourages others to engage with you.

Networking as a digital nomad can enrich your travel experience and expand your professional horizons. As you embrace your adventurous journey, take the time to cultivate meaningful relationships.

*advice
-If you‚Äôre going to get final tour vinyl go immediately to the fat wreck cords tent. DO NOT GO to NoFx tent. That is only apparel. I waited over an hour in NoFX line only to find the vinyl wasn‚Äôt there‚Ä¶.then waited in fat line. Luckily I got what I wanted. 

-Verizon cell service is a no go,possibly others. I had absolutely no service which sucked and a lot of the vendors service was going in and out which made payment LONG and LINES long. I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH LONG WAITS. If possible CASH is king for the event. FAT WRECK CHORDS tent has a cash line and it‚Äôs significantly shorter and faster. 

-TOUR VINYL IS 100$ each not 75$ like it was normally advertised. They are also no traditional vinyl jackets. They‚Äôre like a high quality print. Weird to explain.


-parking prices are all over the place. 60$ is the most for the closet lot


-Pop up shop; do not go here if you‚Äôre going to the show. I got into town early specifically to hit up pop up. Waited nearly 2 hrs and they didn‚Äôt have any tour vinyl left. They told me they sold out ü•≤. The shirts I wanted which was the sum41 and blink 182 NoFX shirts. I find those hilarious and they were all sold out. I literally only went to pop up for the vinyl. Ended up getting some niche products just cause I waited so long. Tech deck, coffee, and a few shirts. They do have 10$ shirts, I feel like the pop up is left over tour merch from other shows. 


-VIP
VIP has there own seperate area and I didn‚Äôt know that. Just know a section for VIP has its own area with food and merch.

I did find something that somewhat works for me. Clever Fox weekly undated planner. It‚Äôs taken me 2 years (because sometimes you have a shitty week and skip any planning) to fill it. I‚Äôm in the market for a new one and I know a whole bunch have come out similar to this one. 

https://cleverfoxplanner.com/products/undated-weekly-planner

Does anyone have any suggestions? 

I also wanted to share why this works for me. In my 41 years I‚Äôve learned that for me to look at something everyday it needs to be paired up with something else I do everyday and won‚Äôt miss. That thing for me is coffee. I can‚Äôt exist without it so I make it in the kitchen everyday and that‚Äôs where my planner lives. I also love sitting in a good coffee shop, so on the weekend I usually choose a day to sit in one and plan the week or month ahead. The book has a good lay out where you set goals for the life of the book and you can break them down and then set one for a month or whatever. I also learned dated planners just make me crazy and if I miss a week, it‚Äôs a wasted week and I‚Äôm forever reminded of my ‚Äúfailure‚Äù week. If a week gets bad for me with an undated planner, it‚Äôs okay, I just start again the next week.

Another book I‚Äôve had great luck with is the anti planner. It‚Äôs not really a planner but more of adhd ‚Äúhacks‚Äù for life. There are tabs that say things like ‚Äúoverwhelmed‚Äù, ‚Äútired‚Äù, and different feelings. You choose the basic feeling (mine is often overwhelmed) and go from there.

She never initiates chats. I thought, fine, some people don't like texting, so after about two weeks, I asked her for a coffee/drinks date. She said she something that in essence goes like ""I don't do coffee dates"" to which I said okay some people like something easy for the first date, to get the vibe and have different preferences that's why I suggested something light and easy. She said something that goes like ""she has standards"". I asked if she wants lunch/dinner, to which she agreed but she wants to know first where I am taking her? and then she will look into her schedule. Like why should it matter where I am taking her? I don't mind even paying for the first date, but something about this seems off. What do you all make of this? Perhaps, she is someone with more 'traditional' values?  I am inexperienced when it comes to dating and would appreciate some insights.

Ava
I wake up with a stiff back and an aching arm. I am in bed with Noah since he refused to leave me after we finished watching TV. I smile when I remembered him saying that he was taking his job seriously and that he would take care of me throughout the night.
With a bit of difficulty. I manage to move him without waking him up. It was around eight and I needed to prepare breakfast before he woke up.
After doing my morning routine, I went downstairs. I stood outside the kitchen for a while wondering how I was going to manage making breakfast with one arm.
As I moved to get the ingredients needed for pancakes, memories of yesterday flooded my mind. Everything that happened seemed so surreal that part of me wonder if it had happened. If it wasn‚Äôt for the fact that my shoulder was bandaged and my arm was in sling, I would have thought it was all a bad dream.
When I woke up in the hospital after I fainted I panicked. It took both the doctor and nurse to calm me down and reassure me that everything was okay. She told me that the bullet was lodged in my shoulder but it hadn‚Äôt done any serious damage. I was lucky because according to them if it had hit lower then it would have struck my heart.
They removed the bullet, cleaned the wound, stitched me up and then put my arm in the sling. I was given antibiotics and pain meds. They instructed me to keep my arm elevated till my next appointment.
As I cooked the pancakes, I thought about the man that tried to save me. I made a mental note to find out who he is so I could thank him. He was the only one that looked out for me when my family couldn‚Äôt care less if I was safe or not.
My thoughts are interrupted when a knock sounds on my door, making me wonder who it was.
I highly doubted there was anyone I wanted to see right now. The events of yesterday soured my feelings towards the people I once considered family.
I walk to the door and gently open it. I‚Äôm surprised to find the man from yesterday standing on my doorstep. The first thing I notice is his blue eyes. They were the bluest eyes I‚Äôve ever seen.
I hadn‚Äôt noticed this yesterday. Probably because I was in shock and in pain, but the man was really good looking. He was at least six feet tall, muscular but not in a body builder type of way, a strong jaw and a flawless complexion. His dark brown hair was tousled in a sexy way and his confidence demanded attention.
‚ÄúHey‚Äù I croaked out sounding like a smoker.
He smiled at me and I was struck by how beautiful it was. ‚ÄúHey, can I come in?‚Äù
‚ÄúYeah, sure‚Äù I said stepping out of the way.
He gets in and I close the door behind him. I watch him as he studies my house.
‚ÄúNice home‚Äù he says in a deep voice.
‚ÄúThank you‚Äù I mumbled. ‚ÄúI made some pancakes, would you like some?‚Äù
He nods his head and I lead him to the kitchen. Before I can go back to making breakfast, he stops me, making me turn to face him.
‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt been formally introduced, I‚Äôm Ethan‚Äù he gently grabs my hand, turns it around and kisses it.
For some reason I feel flushed. I wasn‚Äôt used to this kind of attention and charm from men. I was the one that was always looked over. The boring and unattractive sister.
‚ÄúI-I‚Äôm Ava‚Äù I stammered.
‚ÄúI already know that, beautiful‚Äù he says giving me a wink while taking a seat at the kitchen island.
I give an awkward laugh because I didn‚Äôt know how to behave. He oozed masculine energy and it was directed at me. I‚Äôve never been in such as spot before. It was so disconcerting.
‚ÄúSo Ethan, with no last name‚Ä¶what were you doing at my father‚Äôs burial?‚Äù I asked while placing a cup of coffee before serving him a plate of pancakes.
I take my own plate and cup and sit next to him. He chuckles as he looks at me.
‚ÄúA threat had been reported and given your father was dead because of that threat, the chief wanted us on the look at incase the same people tried anything with the mourning family‚Äù he says right before he takes a bite.
‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre an officer? I‚Äôve never seen you before and I know almost everyone.‚Äù
‚ÄúYes I‚Äôm an officer‚Ä¶I just moved here a couple of months back. I‚Äôve been swamped with work so I haven‚Äôt had much time to mingle‚Äù he replies after swallowing.
I smile at him. ‚ÄúWell you can consider me one of your friends‚Ä¶I was wondering how to find you just this morning actually.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhat for?‚Äù
‚ÄúTo thank you for saving my life. I don‚Äôt remember everything but I remember you putting pressure on the wound and shouting for an ambulance‚Äù
I also remember the way that he rushed towards me. I actually believe that if he hadn‚Äôt pushed me out of the way, the bullet would have hit my heart. So I owed him my life.
‚ÄúI was just doing my job, besides it‚Äôs not every day you get to have a beautiful woman in your arms even though she faints at the sight of her own blood‚Äù he teases giving me another dashing smile.
Blood rushes to my cheeks. I laugh, trying to hide my embarrassment. By the way he behaves I just know he‚Äôs a charmer. It‚Äôs obvious with his smiles and winks. He‚Äôs also a breath of fresh air. Something I haven‚Äôt had in my life in quite a while.
‚ÄúAnd what brought you to my doorstep and how did you know where I live?‚Äù
‚ÄúI‚Äôm an officer remember? It was easy to find you. As to why I‚Äôm here, I wanted to make sure you were okay. I wasn‚Äôt able to stay with you yesterday because I was called in to give a report. I went back to the hospital and was told you had been discharged. I didn‚Äôt think it would be appropriate coming to your house at night‚Äù
I‚Äôm struck to be honest. This stranger had shown more care and compassion to me than anyone else around me has ever shown me my entire life. With the exception of Noah of course. I didn‚Äôt know what to do with that because I wasn‚Äôt used to it.
‚ÄúThank you‚Äù I say slowly emotions clogging my throat.
He gazes at me strangely but I ignore the look and change the subject.
From there we talk and eat. It was weird that I was completely comfortable around him, though he was a stranger. I couldn‚Äôt remember being this relaxed around anyone but Noah.
Around forty minutes later he leaves. We exchange numbers but I‚Äôm doubtful he‚Äôll ever call or text even though I had a wonderful time. I was just not the type of woman men text back or look for their company a second time.
I was just cleaning our plates when there was another knock. Noah had yet to wake up and I was in no rush to wake him.
‚ÄúDid you forget something?‚Äù I asked opening the door.
My emotions shut down when I realize that it was Rowan and not Ethan. Seeing his face just brought a rush of pain. Remembering how he abandoned me to save his precious Emma brought a bitter taste to my mouth.
There was no denying that I meant nothing to him. Yesterday just showed me the extent of his disregard and hate towards me. I push the hurt and pain away. Locking them together with the love I had for him in the deepest and darkest parts of my soul.
Rowan was dead to me and I didn‚Äôt have to love a dead man.

I hope it's nice where you are and I hope the sun shines and that it's a beautiful day. 

Not sure what this post will bring, but, maybe it's you? Just looking to chat with different kinds of like-minded, single people and see where things go - zero pressure or expectations, just organic conversation. 

Someone witty, genuine, comfortable in their own skin, and just down to earth. 

A little about me:

I am gainfully employed and work from home full-time. I'd love to share the little mundane details of my day with you and in turn, ask you all about yours and question whether you've eaten today, because, I care (!!).

Qualities that are important to me? Hmm, loyalty, consistency; open, honest communication; the ability to make me laugh (hard and often, preferably); patience, kindness, and a genuine desire to learn who I am as a person.

Being self-aware, compassionate, and empathetic are also super important and attractive qualities to me. I try to be kind to everyone I meet. With that said, I was voted most likely to say, ""I wish you the best,"" knowing damn well I hope you go to hell. Life's about balance, not perfection ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

I think I'm best described as an extroverted introvert - I do really well in social settings, but more often than not, I'd prefer just being home in my own space. With that said, I'm always down to travel, checkout new restaurants, museums, aquariums, the zoo, farmers markets, book stores, quaint coffee shops, and the like. In my free time, if I'm not working out, hanging out with my dogs/friends/family, I love being of service to others and find fulfillment in volunteering. 

I'm 34. Female. 5'6ish. Curvy, dark features, tanned skin. Educated. Knows which utensil to use for which food (humble brag). Mentally sane. Single; no human kids - just a fur mom to my two doggos that make my heart beam with pride and who give my life so. much. meaning. 

You are: preferably my age or older, single, child free, monogamous, and text with purpose. I don‚Äôt care what you look like or what you do for a living, just be yourself, and we'll be good. 

It'd be a bonus if we're in the same timezone (eastern), but it's not an issue if we aren't. For what it's worth, I'm based on the East Coast but open to friendship and connections from anywhere in the world.  

Thanks for taking the time to read this. If anything in this post resonates with you, feel free to reach out. 

I look forward to the banter :)

# My StoreBuddy AI Beta Tester Experience: From Skeptic to True Believer

When I first heard about StoreBuddy AI, I'll admit I was skeptical. As a seasoned online marketer, I've seen my fair share of ""revolutionary"" tools that turned out to be all hype and no substance. But boy, was I in for a surprise.

I signed up for the beta test program, half-expecting to spend hours troubleshooting and dealing with bugs. Instead, I found myself staring at a fully functional online store just minutes after logging in.

My first store was a niche site selling vintage-inspired home decor. The AI-powered store creator asked me a few questions about my niche and product types, and then ‚Äì BOOM ‚Äì I had a professional-looking store that looked like it took weeks to set up.

But the real test came when I started adding products. I was blown away by how easy it was to upload my items, set prices, and even write product descriptions (with the help of the built-in AI copywriter, of course).

Within the first week of launching, I had made my first sale. By the end of the month, I had generated over $1,500 in revenue. And the best part? I spent less than an hour a day managing the store.

StoreBuddy AI didn't just meet my expectations ‚Äì it shattered them. It's not just a tool; it's a complete game-changer for anyone serious about eCommerce.

1fwsvbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAChinese/comments/1fwsvbg/chinese_friends_keep_bringing_gifts/,Chinese friends keep bringing gifts ,"We are a white family and our son plays with a Chinese boy and they get along very well.

Their family always brings us gifts - liquor, coffee, desserts, often expensive, when they visit us. We returned the favour a few times, but we also don't really know what to buy them.

While I appreciate the gestures I don't really want to spend a bunch of money to return the favor every time they hang out together. 

I was wondering 

1. What would be some appropriate things I could buy them, they brought us a red silk scarf type thing, lots of coffee and desserts and a high alcohol wine made from rice and;

2. Is it rude to just sometimes bring gifts and sometimes not? As I said it gets a little expensive to spend 20-40 dollars every time they spend time together. It's also kind of a lot of planning when we jsut want to drop our son off for an hour or two. 

And I guess to sum it up, what's the best way to move forward with this without being rude and also showing them we appreciate their friendship. ",1,1728141935.0,AskAChinese,0,0.67,False
1fwsuf6,https://www.reddit.com/r/okbuddyfalcom/comments/1fwsuf6/my_day_out_with_lainey/,My day out with Lainey,"So Claire was away for the weekend as she had to attend some RMP duties. Me and Elaine both hugged her and wished her good luck on her trip. She's such a hard working person and I love her for that haha.

Me and Elaine decided to go out to this nice cafe that had recently opened up.

""Hey Lainey you ready yet?"" I was waiting for Elaine to get dressed and I had noticed that it was cold outside. I decided to grab my jacket for good measure. 

""Hey honey, I'm ready! W-well? What do you think?"" Elaine was wearing the most huggable outfit I had ever seen (Kuro 2 outfit) and her blush made her look even more adorable. 

""Haha it looks great! You really have a great sense of fashion Elaine!"" She walked up to me until our faces were centimetres apart. Then she flicked my forehead.

""Gosh you always know how to embarrass me... but thank you :)"" 

We headed to the cafe and arrived within 10 minutes. 

""Wow it's nice! Very homely."" ""You're right darling, it's very welcoming. I really want to try the chocolate cake, oh and the coffee!"" I smiled at how excited Elaine was. I then ordered 2 slices of cake (1x cheese and 1x chocolate) and 2 cappuccinos. 

""Wow this is amazing isn't it honey?"". Elaine looked absolutely adorable as she was enjoying her chocolate cake. 

""Haha I always love seeing you this excited. Although, It's just a slice of chocolate cake you know Lainey?"" Elaine then frowned at me with a blush on her face.

""Hmph... you know what it is honey? It's because you haven't tried mine yet! Here..."" She used her spoon to get some cake and moved it towards me as if I was some kind of toddler!

""L-Lainey? Seriously? In public?"" Elaine laughed at how embarrassed I was.

""Oh come on now... you and I both know that you love this. You love being taken care of don't you?"" Suddenly, it was like a light bulb had gone off in her head. She smiled mischievously. ""Let's not forget how just the other day you were calling me momm-""

""Elaine! Fine I'll try the cake. Gosh you're such a tease sometimes."" I let her feed me a slice of the chocolate cake and it was really nice.

""See? Good right?"" Elaine had the most heartwarming smile I had ever seen. 

""Yep, guess you know your cakes haha"". I looked at Elaine's mouth and noticed there was some chocolate cake on it. It was my turn to get some payback. I took a napkin, reached over and wiped her mouth. She was surprised.

""W-what? H-hey... You could've just told me you know? I would've done it myself."" She started pouting in an adorable yet mature way.

""Haha and miss that look on your face? No way. I guess miss A-rank Bracer is a bit of a messy eater sometimes huh? I thought you were supposed to be the Sword Mai-"" Suddenly I could feel a death stare on me.

""Go on honey. Finish that sentence üòÅ"". 

""I'm sorry.""

We then finished our meals and decided to leave the cafe. There was still some time left in the day so we decided to go for a walk.

1fwsu0y,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerApps/comments/1fwsu0y/given_the_challenges_of_competing_in_the/,"Given the challenges of competing in the saturated mobile app market, do you think transitioning to developing and selling PowerApps‚Äîtargeted at businesses with potentially higher budgets‚Äîcould be a more viable strategy for generating semi-passive income as an independent developer?","Hi,

I'm an employed software developer specializing in the development of mobile apps for Android and iOS. I currently develop apps full-time for a company that employs me, and I am compensated for building software for them. However, I‚Äôm considering starting a part-time business as an independent app developer, with a slightly different approach. Instead of offering services (i.e., developing apps for others and charging an hourly or project-based rate), I‚Äôm thinking of focusing on developing my own products (apps) that I can sell in the market.

My aim is to create a **semi-passive income stream**‚ÄîI call it ‚Äúsemi-passive‚Äù because I would still need to provide customer support and maintain the apps‚Äîbut the goal is to generate a few hundred dollars of cash flow each month.

# The Challenge

The problem, however, lies in **selling a mobile app** on platforms like the **Google Play Store** or the **Apple App Store**. In my view, this is nearly **mission impossible**, and here‚Äôs why:

1. **Overcrowded and Saturated Market**: The mobile app market is incredibly competitive. With thousands of apps released daily, it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to stand out. Developers from all over the world are selling apps on just two major platforms, which significantly reduces the chances of success.
2. **Already an App for Everything**: The market is mature, with an app available for almost every conceivable purpose. Finding a unique idea that hasn‚Äôt already been done is challenging.
3. **Target Audience**: Unlike B2B markets, where customers are companies with larger budgets, app store customers are mostly individuals who expect apps to be free. When they do pay, they usually aren‚Äôt willing to spend more than the price of a coffee. As a result, to generate even modest revenue, you would need a **huge user base**, likely in the hundreds of thousands.

# Why PowerApps?

This brings me to **PowerApps**. I believe I have a much better chance of success selling a **PowerApps solution** compared to a traditional mobile app for the following reasons:

1. **Less Competition**: The PowerApps market appears to be far less crowded than the mobile app market. Not everyone is developing PowerApps, meaning there is more room to stand out.
2. **Different Target Audience**: PowerApps customers are primarily **businesses** rather than everyday individuals. These companies are more likely to pay larger sums for an app, which means you don‚Äôt need a huge user base to generate even a modest income. A smaller number of business customers could yield more significant revenue than a large number of individual consumers.

# The Question

Given the challenges of competing in the saturated mobile app market, do you think transitioning to developing and selling PowerApps‚Äîtargeted at businesses with potentially higher budgets‚Äîcould be a more viable strategy for generating semi-passive income as an independent developer?",2,1728141835.0,PowerApps,2,1.0,False

There‚Äôs no shortage of men who will commit to you it‚Äôs all in your head! ,"Guys, I am a 26F I left a DV situation in 2020. There has been guys left and right interested in commitment with me. Why? Because I don‚Äôt mope around feeling sorry for myself. I take care of my body, I take care of my mind, my money and my spirit. I am the most beautiful I‚Äôve ever been actually as a result of all this. My children (sons 5&6) are well behaved (and very handsome ‚ò∫Ô∏è) and they are a delight to be around. 

I hate to give y‚Äôall some hard truths but a lot of you have given up on yourselves. (And in turn your children you refuse to nurture and just hand the iPad to every second you get. A lot of y‚Äôall‚Äôs kids lack discipline also) You don‚Äôt work out at all, you eat fast food or the only food you eat is coffee and your vape. 

STOP TALKING TO YOUR POS BABY DAD. IGNORE HIM. The number one turn off for men is DRAMA with another man! 

You listen to the BS rhetoric that single moms are ‚Äúused up‚Äù and ‚Äúdamaged goods‚Äù etc etc. You know who doesn‚Äôt think things like that? This is going to shock you:

Wealthy men. 

Once I started dating wealthy men my life changed, they see single moms as mature and responsible with a proven track record of being a good mother and a nuturer. That‚Äôs a HUGE turn on for wealthy men who only get treated as wallets. In return they will spoil you rotten, pay for babysitters and make sure you and your children are fed. Also biologically you are the safer option to have more children with (especially if you‚Äôre a mom of 2 or 3) because you‚Äôve shown that you can carry and birth a child. 

You need to change your demographic of men you‚Äôre interested in. I don‚Äôt even bother with 90% of men anymore.

She also hasn‚Äôt had sex and told me she had no interest in having sex with me . But she denied being asexual.

But I‚Äôve been struggling to find truly great coffee. For me, good coffee means I don‚Äôt need to add sugar or creamer.

Now, my boyfriend drinks Folgers‚Äîthe big red can, medium roast. And as the first rule in our relationship, that‚Äôs the first cup of coffee brewed every morning in the house. It‚Äôs his coffee, and he‚Äôll go through more than one pot a day. But that first pot is always Folgers.

Years ago, when I was in college, I met some incredible men from Kuwait. As part of welcoming me into their home, they offered me a small cup of coffee. It was, without a doubt, the most delicious coffee I‚Äôve ever had‚Äîand I didn‚Äôt need any cream or sugar. It had this deep, smoky flavor that reminded me of chicken noodle soup in the best way possible. Fast-forward to now, and our Turkish neighbors welcomed us with coffee, too. Again, it was perfect without any sugar or cream. I even found the brand they use: Mehmet Efendi, and I drink it by the mugful.

This leaves me wondering: Why does most American coffee‚Äîat least the brands you find at cheap grocery stores‚Äîalways need cream and sugar to taste good? But when I‚Äôm handed a cup of foreign coffee, I can down it without a second thought, cup after cup.

As they discuss potential recruits, the **camera zooms in on a newspaper article** featuring a new criminal syndicate emerging in the city, **led by Surya as Rolex**.

Suddenly, **Simran receives a call from an unknown number**.

* **SIMRAN:** ""Who is this?""
* **MYSTERIOUS VOICE (V.O.):** ""I know the truth about Ragavan‚Äôs last case. We'll meet soon!""

The call ends abruptly, leaving Simran intrigued and suspicious. Simran decides not to mention this call to Vinayak because **Vinayak doesn't know about Simran's other side**.

**CLOSING SHOT:**  
After the call, they both walk out of the coffee shop, and the camera zooms in on a **yellow jacket with an eagle symbol** on a chair, hinting at **Vijay watching them**.

# Card notes

‚Äã

* The weather in Japan may be cooling off but things in Tokyo Joshi remain white hot as they return to Kourakuen Hall with an awesome 8 match card just weeks after Wrestle Princess 5.



* Match order may be different than how it is listed here.



* The card subject to change depending on participating wrestlers‚Äô physical conditions.



* In a huge announcement at WP5, Namba revealed that the main event of this card would include Joshi wrestling legend and arguable monster, Meiko Satomura joining with Shoko Nakajima to take on Miyu Yamashita and Miu Watanabe (or Tokyo MiuMiyu as I like to joke).  Satomura has made two prior appearances in Tokyo Joshi with the last being in 2019.  That said, this match will call back feelings from her first appearance at the Kourakuen Hall show named ‚ÄúBrand New Wrestling‚Äù in August of 2017 when she was invited in to have a singles match with Miyu Yamashita after a confrontation with her in a 6 woman tag match at DDT‚Äôs ‚ÄúJudgement‚Äù Ryogoku show earlier in the year.  For those who were not yet fans of  Tokyo Joshi in August of 2017, here‚Äôs a brief summery of how the landscape has changed in Tokyo Joshi since Yamashita and Satomura last faced off.  Firstly, the roster consisted of 16 full time and regularly appearing wrestlers.  The IP belt wouldn‚Äôt be introduced for another 2 years.  The Princess Tag belts were introduced at this show.  The original 4 Up Up Girls (Pro Wrestling) were introduced at this show, but had not yet debuted as either idols or wrestlers.  Yuki Kamifuku debuted at the show.  4^(th) Princess Cup winner Reika Saiki would win the PuriPuri title from Yuka on this show.  Saki-sama had just reorganized her group, changing it from SIN-Biishikigun to NEO-Biishikigun.  Yuki Aino was the ring announcer and had yet to debut as a wrestler.  Sayuri Namba was not yet part of the company.  Only 6 members of the current roster wrestled on this show (Hyper Misao was injured at the time).  Also, the show in which Satomura appeared was only Tokyo Joshi‚Äôs 3^(rd) ever appearance in Kourakuen Hall.  So, to say that things have changed a bit since Miyu and Meiko‚Äôs last face-off is a drastic understatement.  With the history covered, let‚Äôs look at the match itself.  This may be the last time Meiko appears in Tokyo Joshi, so everyone is going to be out to do their best here.  While it was only briefly, Shoko and Meiko do have experience teaming from their special match in DDT years ago.  They will have a power and speed dynamic.  Meiko is an extremely powerful wrestler with dangerous offense consisting of impressive elbow strikes, scary kicks including her signature axe kick ‚ÄúScorpio Rising‚Äù, as well as the strength to muscle anyone into impressive slams.  Her favored finisher is a Death Valley bomb.  This paired with Shoko‚Äôs high speed offense of hurricanranas, 619s of varying heights and flying kicks may lead to some them dominating much of the match.  Miu and Miyu are an all power and striking team.  Miu is pound for pound the strongest wrestler in Tokyo Joshi and will look to match Meiko‚Äôs attacks primarily with bodyslams, and her giant swing variant.  She also has a devastating powerslam that she can pull with lightning speed.  Miyu‚Äôs bread and butter is her kicks.  Since her last meeting with Meiko, she has developed the terrifying ‚ÄúSkull kick‚Äù which is one of the things that has kept her at or near the top of the division for so long.  In their last confrontation, Miyu‚Äôs kicking couldn‚Äôt really compare to Meiko‚Äôs, so it will be interesting to see if she has developed her attacks to rival or surpass Meiko‚Äôs.  Naturally both teams will be looking to try to isolate and wear down one member of the opposing team.  In theory, Shoko would be the ideal member of her team to try to take down, however, she‚Äôs so quick, dynamic and improvisational that its difficult to pin her down for too long.  On the Miu & Miu team, at a glance, there seems to be no easy target to isolate, however, Miyu has historically had trouble in tag matches, particularly ones where Maki is not her partner.  The weakness in their seemingly impenetrable abilities could lie with her.



* At Wrestle Princess 5, in Xia Zhao‚Äôs first sojourn to wrestle outside of the United States, she was able to bring down Kamiyu with the help of tag partner Mizuki.  After the match, Xia got on the mic and challenged Kamiyu for not one but both of her championships.  Surprisingly the champ accepted and now Xia will challenge for both the Vietnam pro wrestling women‚Äôs championship as well as the Queen of Asia title from Sinapore Pro Wrestling.  This will be an interesting test for Kamiyu.  Thus far in her career, she‚Äôs rarely taken on the kind of pure striker in the vein that Xia has become.  The best comparison is of course Miyu Yamashita with whom Kamiyu has naturally faced numerous times throughout her career.  The primary difference between Miyu and Xia is that Miyu has developed her techniques so that she more evenly melds her martial arts with wrestling techniques to give her a more multi-layered style while Xia seems to primarily be a striker that can occasionally whip out a power move.  So how should Kamiyu approach that match?  There are a number of options.  The most obvious is for Kamiyu to use her slight height advantage over Xia, stay out of reach and make use of her big boots and running dropkicks in a sort of hit and run strategy.  Another tactic would be to challenge Xia on the mat.  Thus far Xia hasn‚Äôt really been forced into a wrestling contest, it may be that her training has been so focused on striking that Kamiyu would be able to restrain her in a grappling situation and limit her movements and opportunities to fire off strong kicking techniques.  The last major possibility is that Kamiyu could attempt to stay in close to try to survive Xia‚Äôs lesser attacks so as to avoid the major ones that Xia is able to fire off when her opponents are at a greater distance.  Whatever route she chooses the important point is endurance.  To date, most of Xia‚Äôs matches are within 5 or 10 minutes so it stands to reason that longer matches put her out of her element.  The longer Kamiyu can draw things out, the more favorable the outcome looks for her.



* The Ryo Mizunami solo test waits for all who want to be at the top of Tokyo Joshi.  Miu went through it, Moka went through it, Suzume went through it, now its Arisu‚Äôs turn to face Aniki alone.  Of course Arisu is no stranger to wrestling Aniki.  She and Suzume were defeated by Yuki Aino and Aniki at the start of the year in a 3 way match to crown new tag champs, then again in Osaka as part of a lead in 6 woman tag on the road to their tag title match at Grand Princess this past March.  However, this time, Arisu will have no respite from Aniki‚Äôs energy.  No one to tag and no time to rest.  Aniki is bigger, stronger and more experienced than the young zebra, but she will only be able to match her in heart, not outshine her.  How will Arisu approach this match?  Cautious? Guns blazing? Good luck Arisu!



* We have a gaggle of former ActWres Girl‚Äôz talent on this show with the strongest being Yuna Manase making an appearance for the first time since Summer Sun Princess teaming with HIMAWARI who was in AWG for a proverbial cup of coffee.  The two will be taking on the slightly unusual combination of Rika and Maki.  In her last ToJo appearance, Yuna had to deal with Raku, Pom and Yuki having a summer festival in the ring and so this match promises to be less chaotic?  Well, actually, its Rika and Maki, so maybe not.  Maki is a brawler and Rika can alter her fight style depending on the situation.  Yuna is a heavy hitter and HIMAWARI, while not the size of Yuna, packs a wallop in her own right.  Usually when Yuna appears, she‚Äôs matched up against the newer members of ToJo to test and push them on their journeys, it‚Äôs been some time since she‚Äôs battled with any of the senior members of Tojo. How have Yuna, Rika and Maki changed since they last time they battled one another?  Can Yuna and HIMAWARI survive through the chaos, brutality and, let‚Äôs face it, nonsense that Maki and Rika bring to the table?  Conversely, will Maki and Rika be able to stand up to the strong arm power style that Yuna and HIMAWARI are packing?



* Ever wonder what a bunny, an idol, a panda and an apologetic woman have in common?  Turns out the answer is WRESTLING!  That‚Äôs right, Shino and Andreza Giant Panda are teaming up to try to stop one of the greatest apologists in the universe, Mahiro, and one of the greatest evils of the universe, Mizuki. The interactions are exciting to think about.  Fans could see Mizuki biting a panda or terrorizing idols.  They could see Mahiro take responsibility for Mizuki‚Äôs antics or bowing deeply atop a panda.  The possibilities are nearly endless!



* This match will feature some new and classic combinations.  Suzume and Yoppy will be teaming for the first time to take on Moka and Kaya who are paired together fairly often.  Suzume and Kaya both similarly favor high speed striking and high flying attacks, the difference in the teams comes from their partners.  Yoppy is a surprisingly small wrestler who favors a grappling style with some aerial attacks mixed in whereas Moka is primarily a powerful striker.  Yoppy is still only about a month into her life as a member of the Tokyo Joshi regular roster so she‚Äôs still learning about all the members of the roster and how to relate to them but a win could easily push her quickly to positions higher on the card.  Both Moka and Suzume are coming off recent title match losses so both will be looking to build their momentum back up.  Kaya so far has been outside the title picture looking in so a win here could potentially put her on the path to challenging for a title.



* Everyone‚Äôs favorite 3-woman group returns! Aino, Pomu and Raku are back as they face an interesting team of rookies Chika and Kira with the added twist of freelance wrestler Kakeru Sekiguchi.  Kakeru has been appearing more and more in ToJo and its been a great addition.  Kakeru‚Äôs versatility allows her to fit into most any situation and spot on the card.  So, in this case, she‚Äôll be acting in a leadership and teaching role.  Helping the rookies as they try to navigate the utter chaos and nonsense that the AiRakuPo team can bring to bear.  



* The opening match of the show is a bit of a twist on some normal combinations.  Wakana and Haru will be teaming together while Wakana‚Äôs usual partner, Toga, sits opposite her.  Toga‚Äôs partner for this match will be the wild and unpredictable white Up Up Girl, Uta.  Uta has never teamed with Toga before but she often posts back and forth on SNS with Haru, which is what makes this match unusual.  Of course, it‚Äôs well known that all the members of ToJo get along quite well, but once they‚Äôre in the ring they want to prove themselves and always give it their best. This match will be no exception so don‚Äôt expect to see either team hold back as they all try to grab the win.

I said no, I'm sorry, I don't have anything to give right now. He asked another woman sitting outside but she didn't respond, so he turned to me and started to call me names and say that he knew I had something to give, I just didn't want to give him anything.

He started to get more aggressive and I told him point blank to leave me alone.

He then *grabbed the wooden table I was sitting at, picked it up, and swung it at me*.

I immediately dipped back into the shop and the baristas were phenomenal, but he took off before anyone could confront him or call anyone.

I've been living in this city since I was a teen and I've never, never had something like that happen. I've been asked for money almost on a daily basis here but the folks are always respectful when I say, ""sorry, I don't have anything.""

I guess this is mostly a rant.

I feel like saying its 'tough' is an understatement, we've been getting completely and utterly fucked by our subjects. It doesn't help that our professors seem to hate us and don't want us to pass (to gice you an idea of how bad it is, out of 100+ students, the highest score in a 50 item test was 27. Our passing rate is 75%. No one passed). 

I'm not feeling great about it, but it's been hitting my girlfriend way worse. She's a scholar in her town, you see. She puts a lot of pressure on herself to do great in school as a payback for the effort that her parents are putting just so she can go to college in a bigger city than theirs. Lately, she's been feeling really negative feelings and saying things like, ""just enjoy it [graduating] for me"" and ""just support my coffee shop in the furure (implying that she isn't gonna graduate with me because of her grades)"".

I don't know, I wanna comfort her but I don't know how. Everytime I try to bring up the fact that *Everyone* failed or got a low score, it doesn't help. When I try to empathize and say that I got a low score too, she'll just reply about how its still higher than hers.

I just want to help, what can I do? :') (I've tried asking her, but she also doesn't give a very clear response).

When heading out instead of going to Starbucks will prepare said beverage and then bring it with me in a tumbler. Instead of waxing I bought a nair kit. It's not perfect but saves me time and money it's not as perfect but works for now. I've also tried to save in going to the laundromat and let some laundry pile up till I really have to launder. Figure this saves me $15 a month. What are some ways you save? As a side note my greatest friend has a washing machine in his apartment complex and says I can bring laundry anytime I want but don't fill up his car haha.

1fwsjwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarnivalCruiseFans/comments/1fwsjwu/just_finished_our_first_carnival_cruise/,Just finished our first Carnival Cruise,"And I‚Äôm happy to report that it was a great vacation! We did the 5 night Eastern Caribbean cruise out of New Orleans on the Carnival Valor on 9/30

Prior to our cruise I spent a lot of time in this sub reading other trip reports and I felt they were very helpful! I wanted to share my own report for anyone in the future who might have questions or who might just want to obsessively imagine what their vacation will be like.

Details: 
Carnival Valor. 5 night Eastern Caribbean.
Ports - New Orleans, Cozumel, Progresso

Some info about us: 
2 married adults in late 20‚Äôs‚Ä¶ We were celebrating our wedding anniversary and traveling without the kids. Our idea of a an ideal vacation is slow paced and relaxing. Which is a nice way of saying that we aren‚Äôt big party people or all day binge drinkers, but enjoy a glass of wine with dinner or a few drinks by the pool. We did not buy the alcohol package but did buy the soda package. We had a balcony room and the faster to the fun package. I‚Äôve been on 3 cruises with royal Caribbean 10+ years ago with my parents and my husband has only been on a Disney cruise  with his family 10+ years ago, so it was a new experience for both of us to cruise with Carnival and as adults.

Weather: we were concerned in the days leading up to the cruise because it was during hurricane season and there was an area in the gulf being monitored for potential tropical development. We fortunately did not have anything develop while we were on the cruise! We did encounter scattered storms the duration of the trip. However, seas were pretty calm and the weather did not affect our experience. A small note: the last two evenings you could feel a significant increase in ship movement due to the wind and I personally felt a little seasick from it. A dosage of Dramamine helped significantly, but I did discover it made me super sleepy. Who knew üòÖ

The Valor: one of Carnival‚Äôs older (and smaller ships). She was a fine ship - nothing exceptional, but also nothing to complain about. I remember reading a post in this sub about how someone else found her decorations tacky, and I would agree with that to some point but it‚Äôs a real first world kind of problem and I wouldn‚Äôt say the decorations negatively impacted our experience. The valor is starting to show her age in some parts (such as bathrooms, rust and peeling paint by the pools, wonky coffee machines) but again - nothing worth complaining about. Something I did want to note related to the location of our room. We were on the back of the ship on deck 6. We loved the location from a convenience factor (quiet, close to stairs, close to our dining room) but we did notice a sewage type smell in the hallway every time we would walk to our room. Thankfully we couldn‚Äôt smell it in our room, but we did smell it out on the balcony on the first day. Another note- everyone knows to expect bathrooms/showers to be very small in the staterooms. We discovered on the first day that the showers in the gym Locker room were twice the size of the one in our room. So if you want more room when you‚Äôre showering that is a good option.

Entertainment: Cruise Director George was, by himself, the best entertainment on the ship. If you really wanted to have a good time all you needed to do was look on the itinerary where he was going to be on the ship and just follow him around. His energy and personality was contagious and he was extremely quotable. As far as planned activities we did think the entertainment on sea days from about 10a-3pm was lacking. I know they probably anticipate most people enjoying the sunshine/pools at those times, but we did encounter lots of overcast, wind, occasional rain so it wasn‚Äôt always pleasant to be outside. If you‚Äôre not a big shopper or gambler it was hard to find something to do that wasn‚Äôt just sitting and drinking. Some things we particularly enjoyed while on the ship were: the 80‚Äôs theater show, the Love & Marriage Game show, bar games at the red frog pub, and the Piano Bar with Gustavo (we went every night it was open!). We went to one PG comedy show but were disappointed with it. The show was shorter than we originally realized and it was kind of obvious that the comedian didn‚Äôt want to do a PG show in lieu of a more explicit one. Also - the running track is very small, about half the size of a regular running track. Also - don‚Äôt go to the champagne art show. It feels a lot like false advertising and it will be 1hr+ before you get any champagne. Unless you‚Äôre an avid modern art fan there is no reason to attend.

Bars: As far as the best tasting and least watered down drinks, we really enjoyed the Alchemy bar by the piano bar and the skybox sports bar. Particularly the all star margarita at the skybox was excellent! The Alchemy bar has one of the best designs and we were amused by the uniforms of the barkeeps. The red frog pub was also a great design and we enjoyed the decoration/ambiance the most. We enjoyed that there was a live band every night and open bar games every afternoon. However they did not have darts for the dart board which makes sense, but I was still a little disappointed about because darts is one of our favorite things to play at home. If you want a quick drink to walk around with I would recommend grabbing it from the skybox because it was usually the least busy out of all the bars on the ship and the bartender was super friendly and recognized us each time we came in.

Ports of Call:
New Orleans - we are from Louisiana and didn‚Äôt spend much time Nola. We drove into down day of embarkation and use the port of Nola parking garage. Port of Nola has directions for parking on their website that tell you everything you need to know.
Cozumel - we booked an excursion this day. The Chakanab All Inclusive beach club with snorkeling, lunch, open bar, guacamole lesson, and tequila tasting. 10/10 choice! It seems like most people in Cozumel didn‚Äôt book anything (because it‚Äôs a larger port) or booked more active/exploring excursions. Our excision had maybe 20 people and when we got to the beach club we could spread out enough that it basically felt like a private retreat. The margaritas were a little watered down but the spicy drink the tequila guy makes int he souvenir cups was wonderful. What really sold the experience though was our guide JC. He was very authentic in his interactions with us and made the effort to make sure we were having a good time. His team focused on quality service and attempting to connect on a personal level. There is no poop at the beach club (when booking through carnival they advertise there is a pool) so just be aware of that. There is a shallow area on the beach partially enclosed by rocks that you can go swimming in, that was very nice! Most of the beach had sand, but the water had large rocks and unless you were in the wading area or used some platforms with stairs you could not safely get in the water. We chose not to go snorkeling, but those who did start at the shallow pool and go up the coast a little bit towards some of the platforms. If you wanted to go swimming off one of the platforms you could! The fish were very friendly and would come investigate if you get in the water. After reading a recommendation on this sub, i forgoed a massage on the ship and instead waited until we were in Cozumel and got a massage from one of the ladies walking through the beach club. It was excellently done and much cheaper than it would have been on the ship and I did not have to sit through someone trying to upsell or sell products. That was a great decision and I‚Äôll pass on the same advice. The shopping selection in Cozumel by the port was much better than it was the following day and I wish we had spent more time in the shops and exploring here when we weren‚Äôt at our beach club.
Progresso - we did not book an excursion on this day although most people did! The shopping strip was minimal at best. We had imagined we would do all our shopping in Progresso and eat lunch/relax on the ship while everyone was on their excursion. However now I wish we had booked a beach club like we had in Cozumel. That being said, the bar in the middle (with the straw roof) had the best prices on drinks - nearly half the price of what was on the ship and very strong!

Drink packages: as stated earlier we did not buy the alcohol package but did buy the soda package. Not buying the alcohol package was a good call for us - I don‚Äôt think we had more than 4 drinks on any particular day and you need at least 7 for it to be cost effective. Just fair warning that gratuity is already included on your drink tabs and you don‚Äôt need to add an additional tip unless you really like your bartender. We got the soda package because typically my husband is a big soda drinker and I like sparkling water, however on the ship we realized we didn‚Äôt drink as often as we typically would have. Also - the drink package advertises it covers bubbly brand sparkling waters but i wasn‚Äôt actually able to find anywhere that had them on the ship. I ended up drinking some club sodas from the bars (which was fine by me as I‚Äôm not picky) but I could see how someone else might be upset. In the future I don‚Äôt think we will buy the soda package and instead will bring on some canned sodas or pay for soda as we want it.

Food: was fine, nothing really to complain about. We did not do any paid food venues, mainly just stuck to the lido dining options and assigned dinner. The dining room meals were excellent, both the dinners and the sit down brunch. We also really enjoyed the blue iguana taco bar for both breakfast and lunch. My husband had guy‚Äôs burgers once and said it was fine, not the best burger he‚Äôs ever had but not bad either. The Mongolian wok was disappointing, lunch/breakfast buffet was fine but not exceptional, the deli was fine. The coffee machines were wonky and sometimes you‚Äôd have to try 2-3 before you found one that had coffee available.

Faster to the fun: the port of Nola is rather small so embarkation was (albeit a little chaotic and confusing) relatively painless and didn‚Äôt take much time. We went from the parking garage to the ship in about 30 minutes. I don‚Äôt think F2F made much a difference for embarkation in Nola but it probably would have in a large report like Miami. However it did make a huge impact with disembarking! We were off the ship and in our car in under 15 minutes, so f2f might have been worth it just for that. I will say on the carnival website f2f says you have access to your stateroom and checked luggage earlier on embarkation day which did not end up being the case for us. We didn‚Äôt get access to our stateroom until everyone else did and we did not get my suitcase until right before dinner time. So just be aware of that. Also being able to go to the front of the line for guest services was very nice. We personally ally felt f2f was worth the price and would buy it again.

Carnival vs RC: I‚Äôll preface this section by saying it‚Äôs been 10+ years since I cruised on RC, I was on larger ships and I was 18 and under when I did. So my memories of my experience might be biased or inaccurate for a comparison today.
From what i could observe the main differences between Carnival and RC come down to two things: target audience and type of entertainment. I think RC has a larger target audience and appeals well to either the retiree or foreigners crowd. I remember my last RC cruise (similar tot his one, a 6 day EC cruise out of Nola) was in 2014 and there was not a very large 18-21 crowd, it was mostly older couples and nationality varied. This carnival cruise was pretty specifically Americans in the 21-40 age groups. As far as type of entertainment, I remember the RC ship (I want to say we were on the Liberty?) being larger and having more things to do on the ship besides bars. On the Valor there was at times a strong ‚Äúhurry up and drink‚Äù type atmosphere, the lull in between entertainment options during the middle of the day definitely encouraged the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bored so let‚Äôs sit at a bar and just drink‚Äù mentality. I think because of this we did end up buying more drinks than we would have otherwise. I seem to remember RC had a larger variety of entertainment all throughout the day. I also remember the buffet options being tastier on RC but I‚Äôm not sure how accurate that is today. I remember the dinner waiters on RC being more friendly and spending more time getting to know each of us in comparison to our experience on the Valor. Other than that the cruising experience and ships are pretty comparable according to what I can remember. Potentially the decorations on RC were less themed/more timeless.

Overall it was a great experience. We‚Äôre excited to cruise again and will be looking at longer cruises, different ports, potentially different cruise lines (so we can continue to compare and select our favorite) and we may attempt sailing with the kids on our next trip. 

Any additional questions feel free to ask away! I hope someone finds this report helpful when planning their next trip!",7,1728141072.0,CarnivalCruiseFans,0,1.0,False
1fwsjc0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1fwsjc0/aitah_for_telling_my_bfs_sister_off/,AITAH For Telling my BFs Sister Off? ,"I myself (29F) and my BF (26M) have been together officially for 9 months but have been seeing eachother for over a year. 

For context, my BF lives at home with his dad (73) and his sister (28), they grew up to a single parent and has a very stressed upbringing with eachother with a lot of conflict, fighting and addictions the father had. They both stay at home to pay the bills on their fully paid off home to help their father out now catch up on large debts he occured as a single parent. This is also their way of keeping the house and property for the future. As much as I'd love for my BF to live with me, I understand his situation and I'm supportive of it. I do hear how they all this fight all the time, and that the relationship between the father and sister is very strained where they're basically at each other's throats everyday. 

I grew up on my own from 14, renting and working full time but over the last 5 years have reconnected and have become incredibly close to my family after several years of personal therapy and understanding how a lot of my struggles were my own actions. I'm so grateful to have a fun, happy and supportive family now and my mom has become my best friend. 

It breaks my heart to hear how much he and his family have no close connection but he does try, and tries to be the glue that keeps the home calm. 

Now, the story of what happened;

My BF began spending more and more time at my apartment as our relationship developed, upwards to a week at a time. Everytime he'd come over, he'd get texts from his sister about the family dog being scared of a storm, her fighting with the dad and him having to come home to help her with things. 

A lot of the time, she was passive aggressive or getting on his nerves and he never hid that from me and was very open about his stressful relationship with his family when he was with me. 

I don't have any friends here (my friends all moved to different places to start new lives upwards to 18 hour drives away so I just never get to see them but we all do communicate daily) which I am totally okay with, I am my own best friend, have many hobbies and keep myself happy at home or spend quality time with my mom and family. My BF, brought up that his sister was in a similar situation where her friends also relocated and she doesn't seem the often. He said that he strongly believes we'd get a long and maybe it would benefit both of us to have a female friend close in ages. I agreed , her and I started talking and we developed a cute little friendship where we talked about skincare, clothes and just general things. 

Over time , it turned from just a cute small bond to her constantly venting about her dad and brother (my bf) to me. I tried my hardest to stay neutral as I didn't believe it would be fair to get involved out of respect for my BF. 

One day, it did upset me. My BF had cancelled plans we had I was looking forward to because he lied to me about having chores his family asked him to do. I did believe him, took my salt and left it on the table and just spent my day at home playing video games. His sister, then texted me venting about how he's not helping and he wanted to spend a weekend in his room also playing online games with his friends. I was devastated he lied to me and it caused a huge fight between my BF and I. After a few days passed without us seeing eachother, we did meet for coffee and I apologized for getting as upset as I did, and that I have every right to be upset he lied but I didn't have the right to his privacy and what he wanted to use that time for, it is his own space and he wanted to just spend some time alone and he's entitled to that as well and I just asked him to say that to me and I'd be much happier (he does now, and I just use those days for my own alone time) and he apologized for lieing. 

My relationship with his sister kinda just went cold, she'd text me and I'd text her back kindly but I just wanted to create space because I didn't want to be  involved in issues I didn't need to know about or without my bf coming to me to talk about and I just wanted my bf to maintain his home privacy when we're not together. 

My BF stopped coming over as often, got into a really bad depression because he felt he could never leave his house without his family getting upset with him now and he would just claim he couldn't be in two places at once and he was extremely overwhelmed. It went on for months and our relationship had struggled a lot but we did get through it and we're better now. 

During that depression, when he and I were out together just doing some errands, his sister texted him asking him for account information so she could sign in and find some bill discounts, he told her he didn't feel comfortable doing that and he'd help her with it when he got home. She went off the wall, calling him names and using incredible aggressive language and I could just see all the joy in his face vanish and he just wasn't okay. I looked at him and said I couldn't just let this keep going, it was really upsetting to see and someone needed to tell her this wasn't okay. With his permission, he agreed for me to text her that I saw the messages and that it just wasn't okay. 

My text was;

""Hey, I'm with BF now and I'm seeing how you're texting him and it's really hard on him and it's really not okay to talk to him like this. I wouldn't talk to anyone like that, and if my brothers spoke to me in that way I'd never talk to them again. I think you guys should really sit down and talk and work on this type of communication to become closer instead of this.""

My BF said he never had anyone stick up for him and no one has called her out and she's never been told how she treats him is wrong. 

She told me I had no right to be involved in her family issues and I over stepped my welcome and I was in the wrong for texting her. (In the moment it felt right, but now I don't know) And she blocked me off everything. 

I got banned from their home, she told his dad stuff I didn't say so he wouldnt like me anymore either and it was just left there and has been that way now for a long time. 

A week after I sent that text, my BF called me randomly to come over to my apartmenr because she had attacked him during an argument about me and my message to her. 

Our relationship is fine, he comes here and we go out and do things but he's always saying he wishes I could come over again. 

His sister was diagnosed with BPD, and has no started therapy and I'm so hopeful that will help all of them work on their issues and become closer as a family. 

I feel like there's this permanent strain on our relationship now due to his family disliking me and I do strongly feel it's my fault and maybe I shouldn't have sent her that message despite my BF saying I should. 

AITA and is there anyway I can mend something here?

1fwsj2t,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeowners/comments/1fwsj2t/i_hired_a_lawn_crew/,I hired a lawn crew,"After a year in our first house, I hired a lawn crew.

I had been under the impression I could do this myself.  And for the first year I did.  Every Saturday, out there, first with the blower to get all the leaves in a pile.  Then the string trimmer to edge.  Then the mower to mow.  Then the blower again to get all the bits that flew out of the lawn into the leaf pile.  Then the mower again the mulch my pile of leaves.  Then the blower again to scatter the mulched leaves across the grass.  

It was always the leaves that took up so much damn time.  They're these damn magnolia leaves that are slightly curved and just so aerodynamic that if they're lying in the grass with the concave side down, you could blast them with 100mph wind and they wouldn't budge.  But they do add up and smother the grass.  If I leave them there when I mow, the wind from the mower just doesn't lift them high enough to rise up into the blades unless I lower the blades down to like a 1/2"" setting.  SO. MUCH. FUCKING.

I never had a relationship before and it didn't exactly used to bother me until now. One big reason was because I was shy, anxious, afraid of talking to women etc. typical stuff you already know but even more importantly I never actually tried dating either. Except for a girl that I liked very much in high school. I was actually talking and got along well with her but later on I found out she already had relationship for 2 years and my world fell apart. That was 7 years ago and they're still together so props to them I guess.

Anyways, after that girl I never liked anyone the same. I was simply not interested in anyone, never tried dating or flirting. I'm also shy and anxious around girls as I mentioned so no girl seemed to be interested in me either. Even if someone did I probably fucked up anyway.

This was my situation for 7 years, until recently. I fell in love again with a girl in my university, and I gotta say, she's exactly the type of girl that I would die to be together. So I pushed myself no matter how anxious, or weird I will look around her because I felt like if I don't make a move now I will regret it forever. I go talked to her, and to my surprise we break the ice quickly and had some chats and coffee after class in the first week of school. Everything seemed to be going well for me, only until I discovered she has a boyfriend too.

That reality hit me like a fucking truck, and I got absolutely devastated. I had so much hope, only to lose it again. In that moment, I felt like god was pointing his middle finger to my face. I punched things and cried like crazy that day.

I just feel empty now. I don't even want to try anything anymore. My friends always trying to consolate me by saying: ""I'm sure you'll find someone you love eventually"" or something like "" There are many other girls why stuck with her?"" While I appreciate their good intentions and thoughtfulness all I gotta say is:

* ""No, hell no!""

I don't want a relationship just for the sake of having a relationship. I only want to be with a person that I truly love. Not trying to say that I'm entitled to be loved or anything but sure I want that so bad, because in my current situation I'm unhappy. Some might say you can be happy on your own. But no, that never worked me either. I simply just can't find happiness in solitude. I also don't want a relationship with whoever I find first so I'm pretty stuck. What would be the way for me would you say?",3,1728140987.0,IncelExit,4,1.0,False

Currently only work 7 and a half hours a week because it's what I can manage, most of the time. I spend most of my time in my room, in bed, because I'm always so damn tired. Physically, mentally, spiritually, just drained. So drained.

It's probably dramatic to say it feels like my life is already over, but it is how it feels. The one friend I did have since we were both 10 years old recently dropped me. It feels like I'm surviving over actually living, just running through the motions. I'm in the process of trying to learn how to drive to earn some more freedom, hopefully get a job I actually want, but it's so difficult not to feel like it's pointless. 

I lost my teenage years to my mental health, so there's no childhood friends, teenage love, any of those special or developmental bonds. It just hurts. I've always got this crushing, abyssal feeling inside of my chest that feels like it could drag me under and just drown me. I wish I could so much as have a friend to go out with to a cafe, grab a coffee, chat a little. That's all.

I'm rotting. Slowly dying. Passive suicide, I guess. I want to make it better but I can't. I think I'm only writing this to vent a bit, yell out into the void. Thank you.",1,1728140741.0,depression,0,1.0,False

I reckon it's too finely ground or I'm tamping too hard. Or both.

This morning I tried making a double shot and the machine shut off after a few drops came out, the overpressure valve triggered. Then I tried making a single shot later and tamping really light and it came out okay.

When I use preground coffee the flow is too fast, even if I tamp as hard as I can. And there's usually a minor amount of crema. Using the original pressurised baskets and preground coffee, it comes out a lot better. 

How hard should I tamp and how fine should I grind? Which manual grinder would you recommend and what setting to use on it to work with Dedica? I know it mainly depends on the beans, but I just want to get a reference so I can build from that.",0,1728140433.0,espresso,3,0.5,False

We have went on 4 dates now, and dates are going really well. He asks me a lot questions about myself, we are very comfortable with talking about our lives, families and interests, jobs etc., we usually go on walks or for coffee or drinks. He even made a suggestion of going on a day trip to a city few hours away. 

The thing is, we don't text, almost at all. He seemed to put more effort in texting around first 2 dates, he would ask me about my day, send me memes, but now that's literally once a week. I started trying to continue the conversation, but he would leave me on delivered for several days. We also see each other once a week, while first 2 dates happened in the same week. Last date was few days ago, and the one before that was 2 weeks before. This kind of makes me feel like he is losing interest because we live 15 mins from each other and he's currently unemployed (have to make it clear he only recently left his job and is currently interviewing for other jobs lol). He did suggest seeing each other again next week.

I do admit I can appear a bit reserved because I haven't dated in a long time, but I am starting to get more comfortable around him, I even initiated the first kiss. But even with this, I feel like I still haven't really ""broken the ice"" because he is still very cautious when leaning for a kiss which only makes me nervous and I panic not knowing if he wants a kiss on the cheek or an actual kiss lol Which I guess then makes me look like I'm avoiding the kiss and he moved away and said ""it's fine, I'm not going to force you into it"" and I tried to explain he confuses me.

Romantic partner? The commitment and effort required for a relationship sounds exhausting to me and I rather have my peace and quiet.

 There he told me that he is looking for someone for marriage so if I am interested we can take things further and tbh till then I also started liking him so I took my time and told him that will let him know later and it was first time ever after my break up last year that I actually felt good after meeting a guy ,  two days later I accepted his proposal and we started hanging out more often , it was so spontaneous that I just didnt think much of anything I just liked his company and being around him , we started talking ssly about our plans in last two dates and again everything seemed so good , same financials , similar family backgrounds and values it was overall  perfect I got connected to him really well and actually felt the excitement like ""oh if this goes well , we are gonna marry""

Talking further in next dates about starting a family he happily opened about his plannings for our future baby and how excited he is to hold our baby on arms then there  things started going bad ,I confronted him that I dont want any children am willing to be childfree and witnessed his jolly face go down, I could sense the sudden sadness around ‚òπÔ∏è we both tried to talk about it but there was no mid way , it was gonna be huge sacrifice from either of us which we both really didnt want . 

Things didnt go well from then , had to call this match off and feeling more disgusting than ever , I always used to mention about CF but dont know how tf I didnt think here , its all went in vain and lost a really good potential match . 

TLDR - met a really good guy everything was going good between us we both vibed well later he told me about his planning for children and I confronted him that I want to be childfree , things didnt go well then and had to call this off , everything down in the drain .

Been dealing with chronic health issues for five years. LPR may just be one part of the puzzle. It began as a nervous system breakdown...migraine headaches essentially but a full on assault on my nervous system. Pains everywhere, zaps, burning feelings. But of course my med scans were all just fine. Did anxiety therapy, changed some health patterns, gave myself time...things have improved. I am on a preventative migraine medication right now. But no Dr really has ever formally diagnosed me.

I have noticed some interesting things that make me suspicous of LPR - chronic pressure in my eustachian tubes. Long ago I did have a globus sensation, and sometimes I wonder if I mistake this pressure in my eustachian tube for that. I do have chronic morning cough, and a post nasal drip. I do notice it improving now that I am not eating 3 hours before bed. I have often noticed patterns of problems after eating - which may be related to LPR, or migraine, or both. I also have since beginning migraine medication, felt more acidity. I wonder if the migraine meds have calmed my nervous system more so I can actually feel acidic issues?

So anyways seems harmless to play around with an LPR / GERD lifestyle for a bit. Seems like after removing a bit of acidic foods, I feel a bit calmer again in my nervous system. Removed carbonated food, added milk to coffee, removed citrus, and not eating before bed. Seems to be another positive change. Looking for some basic advice / books / websites and information.

I‚Äôm looking for a roommate for an upcoming move between December and February. I‚Äôd love to supply most of the communal furnishings. I've curated my current space over the years and would be sad to let it all go (see photos). If you‚Äôre planning to move around the same time and feel my post resonates with you, I‚Äôd be excited to connect! More info below.

I 29F have a MAX budget of $1,400. I have good credit and a solid rental history, and I share my current space with two wonderful cats. My preferred locations are Manhattan, Northern Brooklyn, or Northwestern Brooklyn. Ideally, l'd like to have one roommate, but I'm open to two if it feels like a good fit.

I welcome all genders, ages, and backgrounds as long as there's emotional maturity and you are able to maintain a clean and respectful living environment. Good communication is key for me, as I want our home to feel safe and welcoming for both of us.

A bit about me: l'm clean, quiet, and organized, with an eclectic minimalist style. I rarely have guests over, but when I do, it's usually for a casual catch-up over a glass of wine. I enjoy cooking simple meals‚Äîtypically rice and fish‚Äîbut I have no dietary restrictions. I work as a leasing consultant in Manhattan from 9 AM to 6 PM.

As for my cats: Kimchi is an 8-year-old calico who loves attention on her own terms and prefers not to be picked up. Kat is a 14-year-old tabby who enjoys being held and is very affectionate. You'll often find them lounging around or napping in various spots.

If this sounds like a good match for you, please reach out! I'd love to grab a coffee or brunch to see if we click.

1fwrhs5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpainAuxiliares/comments/1fwrhs5/tips_spooky_tricks_for_the_upcoming_winter_season/,"""Tips & *spooky* Tricks"" for the upcoming winter season ","As we begin to enter this new winter season, I have a few tidbits to share that may help make your stay in Spain more enjoyable! Everyone feel free to add any tips or anecdotes.

- Particularly up north, if you don't have a washer don't force yourself to hand wash / dry everything at home because it will take forever and your clothes won't smell so good most likely. I tend to only hand wash small things that I know will dry really quickly, and leave bulky things like sweaters, bed spreads and towels for the laundry mat. Look into laundry mats in your area and save yourself the hassle! Usually it's 3-5‚Ç¨ to wash a load and 1‚Ç¨ for every 30 minutes of drying. 

- In conjunction with the previous tip, learn from my mistakes! The simpler your outfits + more hang dry friendly, the better! In the states I always felt like I couldn't repeat outfits and they had to be in style. I quickly noticed no one at my school or small town gave a damn about fashion, what is most valued is quality and comfort. For example, during summer and spring I'd wear different variations of the Athleta ease tee with simple cotton or linen shorts / capris. During fall and winter, I'd wear any midi or long cotton/ linen dress / dressshirt WITH pockets with some sort of sweater on top and any leggings underneath. Or just a long sleeve top and jeans. Making sure to keep a neautral palette, without white (too lazy to wash whites separately). This saved me so much time and effort every morning and when it was time to do laundry.

- Go to your local pharmacy and ask for a strong vitamin D supplement like NOW. In addition to this, try to start incorporating azafr√°n into your diet. I like adding it to my yellow rice while I meal prep for the week. Even if you don't suffer with seasonal depression, and regardless of your placement. Trust me.

- Also somewhat health related and might not be applicable for everyone! BUT if you haven't invested in some good sturdy walking shoes already, I highly suggest you do soon. Obviously up north, some waterproof rainboots are a must but walking sneakers (ideally that are waterproof) are a huge help. My feet and ankles were permanantely swollen my first year, I thought it was just a ""me- very out of shape"" thing but I was really not helping myself with the footwear I brought and ended up having to go to a podiatrist. Do some research, or ask the other teachers at your school which the best walking shoes are (The best that worked for me were the On Cloud Waterproof).

- I tend to not care for going out as much in the winter. I mean, it's pretty grim out there. But try your best, even if it's just sitting at a park for 20-30 minutes a day and listen to a podcast or read a book. Even sitting at a coffee shop every morning to read or watch YT is better than rotting in bed. 

- Be an active participant in your new life. This can go hand in hand with the previous tip. This can be different things for different people. If you want to improve your Spanish, ask around, your co workers or local community centers might be able to direct you in the right direction. I know several people that have done different courses and degrees online while on this program, and still made effort to be active participants in their community while also enriching their own lives. For me, I'm on a health journey that involves meal prepping and hitting 10k steps daily. Whatever it is for you, don't stop now because you're in a new environment.

Of course I don't know either of them personally, so nobody really knows what goes on behind closed doors. Also he apparently pursued a 13 y/o girl when he was 19, however that can be forgiven if he didn't know her age. I'm not sure I can keep encouraging this, whether or not it's true, I'm thinking ""does she really want to be associated with someone who has such rumors surrounding him?"" I have no idea how/if I should mention it. Especially since I've been encouraging and giving advice before I knew about the rumors. But lately it's been getting a bit draining. I like her, she's very nice and has been very supportive of my artwork. But like, she's very dependent on external validation. She's too focused on ""signs"", i.e. he wears the colors she affirmed for in his Instagram posts. And always asking me how exactly I visualize her meeting him, down to the last detail. I've given suggestions but ultimately I say ""choose a scene that feels natural to you"". She's even talked about me coming to pick her up (10 hours away) and go to his favorite coffee shop and wait for him to walk in. I've been honest and said I would have to manifest some money, plus I have terrible driving anxiety in a big city. And, from what I understand, trying to micromanage the 3D can backfire; we're supposed to let things unfold naturally. 

If multiple to infinite realities exist, could there be a reality where he doesn't have all that baggage? Or if it's possible to manifest for others, can I manifest for her to move on? Any advice is appreciated. ",2,1728137860.0,Manifestation,3,1.0,False

What would you do? ,"So I had a friend A (who works with me) for 1 year who hung out with me often. Then she became unfair and always bailed on me last minute. On my birthday party that I had been planning for months, she texted me at 11pm to say she had napped and wasn‚Äôt coming but was going to our mutual friends house tomorrow so I would see her there? 
No apology. She also texted me twice for lunch and I set up the lunch meeting and then she just cancelled on the day and said she‚Äôs sick and one day I went there and she didn‚Äôt even come, but her boyfriend told me. Another friend, friend B, from work and I, who used to be very close, don‚Äôt talk anymore. Friend A‚Äôs boyfriend loves to gossip and tried to find out why myself and friend B are not friends so that he could tell friend B back everything I would say.

I am obviously now annoyed with friend B and friend B‚Äôs boyfriend. They are getting engaged and after 7 MONTHS of me and friend B not seeing each other, she sends a text like ‚Äúto my favourite girl! I‚Äôm inviting you to my wedding and to my engagement party hope you can make both!‚Äù‚Äù

For the wedding, it is a 9 hour flight away so I am not going. The engagement- she said it‚Äôs end of November ‚ÄúISH ‚Äú and didn‚Äôt specify a date. I can either say 

1.) yes I‚Äôm coming to the engagement and then just pretend to be sick one day before or whatever (like she has done to me 4-5 times now) 

2.) hey no I‚Äôm not coming as my family are visiting at this time (this is true) so I will be busy and I am also now not a party person anymore. However would love to have coffee/ lunch/ evening meal together one day? 


I know that friend B is not a life long friend and partly only wonder if I‚Äôm invited to make an extra number for the party or so her boyfriend can get gossip out of me. What should I say? ",9,1728137762.0,makemychoice,21,1.0,False
