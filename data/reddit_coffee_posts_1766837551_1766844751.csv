Hey, I'm going to change the places so it is less obvious. I'm 25 female and my ex boyfriend 39 male, let's call him Mike. (Gauteng, one of the towns in Gauteng) I met Mike at the store he works at when I was 19 (2019), we didn't date then, I just would see him in the store and it would be just how are you? With what can I help today. I had a big crush on him and my grandma would joke and say I eat all the cheese just so that I can buy more just to see him or she would sometimes joke and say she would tell him to marry me even if she has to pay him (she only said it to me not in front of him). I was there until I was 20 then I moved to my mom, she lived in the Cape Town. I met a guy a few weeks after my 21 birthday (2021), let's call him Rob (24) We started dating, it was a toxic relationship and not going to talk much of him because this story isn't about him. I moved back to Gauteng in February 2025, March I broke up with Rob. In April, my grandma and I went to the store she asked Mike to take me out, so that I can get out a bit and she only trusts him. We started chatting on the phone the 2nd of April. The chats were okay. The 9th of April he asked me what I was doing I said making tea, he said no on a Friday, we should go to his sisters bar, I agreed and quickly got ready before he showed up. Had a good time. We hang out a lot after that even had sleep overs. 29th of April we officially started dating. I think before we officially started dating I was helping him move into a new house, the 4th of May I moved in with him. Okay I am not trying to make Mike into a bad person I'm just telling my experiences with him, he is a good person, he was sweet to me at times. The way I tell things might not be the right order but the stuff happened. Okay usually when my cousin ask me about tea or coffee I'm the one ending up making it so I just assumed that's what happening when he asked, I was wrong he got upset and said he won't make tea for me ever again. I blew his second attempt when he was busy making me tea I stood up to go give him a kiss but I guess he thought I wanted to take over but he was already finished, he got mad said the same thing as last time and gave my tea, after that I always made tea for me if I wanted. Was outside with our dog, she bit me so I hit her but not hard then she continued playing and she would come to me to pet her but when Mike came home from work she was in her box and didn't behave like she usually did, he ask me if I hit her I said yes then he accused me of abusing her so I left her alone, didn't do anything because if I did he thinks I abused her. With my family there isn't really a thing like left overs, so I thought the chicken curry would be fine on the counter because iets in the pot and it's cold weather, turns out I was wrong and had to throw it away again he is mad and walk away but clearly still talk about me saying, I have to grow up and think further than my nose and must be nice to grow up not caring to waste food. I end up eating left overs and he didn't eat. The other time we decided to make sandwiches, I asked him how much spread should I make he asked how much sandwiches am I going to make, I said two sandwiches each he got mad and said is that what I'm going to make for a working man, I should ask my mom how much food to make for a working man, I should make bread for myself he will make his own, he doesn't eat a lot so that's why didn't think to make more and I can't ask my mom because not every man eats the same amount, my brother will eat everything in the house 🙈 my dad would just eat those two sandwiches maybe less because he had the surgery two times that made his stomach smaller, I don't know what's it called, usually when Mike makes bread he takes 2 and a ½. I made the sandwiches but also for him, I think I made 5 sandwiches for him because maybe his very hungry, he got angry that I made for him after he said he would make it himself and said I'm wasting bread and now the peacocks has to eat it, I said no and quickly packed the sandwiches in a taper ware container and put it in the fridge, he went to bed without eating (he also said I was having a attitude and being spiteful). The next day he wanted to braai, I said okay no problem but asked if when can make toasties out of yesterday's bread he said yes, we ate it, I don't remember if we fought that day. I'm not always good at making Sunnyside up eggs, he got upset that mine kept flopping. We would go to the bar and sometimes I would stand up and go with him when he would pour us a drink, usually to just talk or to kiss him but he gets upset then goes on saying that I dont give him space and follow him like I'm scared his leaving, then decides not to pour drinks, to clarify I didn't to it every time or the whole time many times when I did stand up it was to go to the toilet, most of the time it only takes one time for me to stand up to go with him to get this reaction (mostly he doesn't sit long so he would walk or talk to other people I would sit en talk to his mom or sister or his gay friend). Also at the bar but another day: most of his friends was there he wanted to hangout with them I said okay, I kept myself busy, now and then when he was near me and not in the middle of a conversation I would kiss him, later on he stand next to me and he talked about what he talked with his friends, so we talked a bit before he was going back I asked for a kiss, he gave it then was mad saying he can't keep kissing me he wants to hang out with his friends, he doesn't see them anymore, then said we should go home and walked away very angry, I cried and was about to say goodbye to everyone but his sister asked what's wrong, I told her and she said I should go sit with her. She probably talked to him because he seemed more upset, I continued dancing and told him to go hang out with his friends, he said something about his sister I told him ignore what your sister said and go hang out with your friends, so it was his sister and his friend's girlfriend (Lily) and me dancing while sitting on the chairs. Later it was Lily and I dancing on the dance floor, later our boyfriends joined. Mike said he has to cut this short because he has to work tomorrow, Lily asked can I stay and party longer they would take me home, he told her it's my choice but there was back and forth with this topic and later on Mike said I can go and have fun but if I go then I shouldn't come back and we would be over, I didn't go, I went home with him. The other time he got upset that I went to the toilet with Lily. He would say I make food too slow. He can't have children but wants me to have children because I have to but it's not a issue for me and have expressed it many times, he just says I'm young and have to have children even if it's just one. He has told me one day we would go to the doctor together so that they can tell me that he can't have children then I can decide if I still want him but he has told me this before we officially started dating so if its was a deal breaker for me wouldn't I have left then? We were cooking together and he kissed me then I asked for his other kiss he got upset and said okay we will leave dinner and have sex and not eat, I said no and continued cooking. Before coming back to Gauteng I was living with my dad and long after a 4 month baby until she turned 2 years old, I would wake up at 6 something to get ready but sometimes she is there before 7, 7 or after 7 then I would look after her until 17:00 sometimes longer. Sometimes she would say I'm off Saturday but would show up Saturday, so if I'm lucky I get a day off, I got payed R50 a day (anyway another drama). Mike got me a job but they later ask for my CV and I asked my brother to make me one, when I got it I asked Mike if he wants to see it, he said why there would be nothing on it you never worked. We got home he said something about turning the volume up of the speaker so I was on my way to do it he got upset because he was on his way to do it, I misunderstood, so I went to the toilet and let him decide if he was going to turn the volume up or leave it and be upset, later I asked if he is mad at me he got furious and stop to braai, I went to our room and laying between the bed and wall crying, my way of giving him space, I stood up when I heard him leaving and driving away, I was confused so I texted him and asking him where is he going he, he said his searching for me, I told him I'm at the house, he asked me why didn't I answer him when he called my name, I told him I didn't hear him call my name because I really didn't hear him, he doesn't believe me and is upset with me all over again and said I have to make a plan to get petrol money for him tomorrow because I wasted his petrol, he came back still mad. He said he thinks I should stay with my grandma for a few days so that he can clear his head the stress is getting to him, later on I just told him I really didn't hear him calling me he still didn't believe me and said I should fuck off and pack my things, we are done he can't anymore, his tired. My brother picked me up and took me and all my things to my grandma, the next day he said he never said that and that I heard wrong, a few weeks later I'm back at his house. These kind of stuff kept happening, I remember I was cooking but don't remember what or what we were talking about but he said and you want to get married, I was confused because I haven't brought it up, it was friends and family who have brought it up but I haven't, he also said I have a lot to learn, he would usually say in fights I have to grow up or I have a lot of growing up to do. At some point we move in another house. We went to another bar in town, it was my first time going there, we hang out with his friends and I would go dance with the other women, the most I danced with was about the same age and older than my mom (45), when I went back to him he was upset because apparently I danced with another man in a orange t shirt, I didn't know who he was talking about and haven't seen any man wearing an orange t shirt, I was just dancing with the women and avoided others. He is upset and doesn't want to talk, I went to the toilet crying, Mike's friend checked on me and took me back to the table and she talked to him, he got more upset when he saw I was crying, they tried helping me but when I saw he went outside I went back to the toilets, Mike's friends came to me and she said Mike left, I continued crying explaining to them I really don't know about the man he was talking about, many of the woman talked to me and we danced one song and I saw my grandma's ex friend's son (Chris), I went to him and explained everything to him, he offered to take me to my grandma, I said yes (Mike's friend doesn't know where my grandma lives and I didn't want to cut her night out short because of my drama plus giving directions was the last thing on my mind. She also has a kid and I know moms sometimes want go out and have fun, once in awhile). We walked to Chris's car the I heared someone calling me I looked around and then saw Mike, he asked what's going on I said they said you left, he said he did leave but only drove around the block and came back, then sat outside waiting for me, we went home and watched a movie, he fell asleep I went to bed. A while before this it was also a braai, I made salad and sandwiches, I marked two of the sandwiches because one I over spiced and the other one I added a sauce, when he finished toasted it the marks where gone so I was trying to figure out which one had the sauce on, so I tried lifting the slices but they are stuck together because of the cheese, so I smelled the sandwiches, he got upset I did explain why he didn't believe me and accused me of trying to poison him and didn't eat the salad and sandwiches. I told him it doesn't make sense to poison him and that would be a dumb way to do it especially since I'm at risk of poisoning myself, I asked him if he poisoned the meat he ask how I said exactly. Later on I told him to tell his mother not to eat the koeksisters I made because it could be poisoned, then he started his rant grow up, I can go back to my grandma, he doesn't have time for children he makes them, so on and so on (the next day he ate the sandwiches for dinner). He got upset when I served him too much food. He got upset when I told him my grandma asks to grate the carrots finely. Oh it was a while back but we went fishing I asked him to teach me, I didn't see when the bobber went up, so I missed it 3 times he said a 1 grader is smarter than me and I should focus. Since it happens a lot I just started to do my own things when he got upset, like continue cooking or getting ready for bed.The other day I was telling him something while we were driving he didn't hear me and ask me to repeat myself, I did and didn't talk further because I didn't have anything else to say, he thinks I'm upset, I told him I'm not upset he doesn't believe me, I open the gate and the front door, then went to the toilet, when I came outside he was packing things away that he was going to use for the braai, I ask him what's going on? He said thanks to me we aren't going to braai anymore, his upset. I went outside crying texting his sister, I went to talk to him asking why he always wants to fight, he says it's my fault, he asked me if someone comes to visits me when his not here, I answered no, he said sometimes he doesn't want to come home because of me, I asked then why are we stil together, he said you said it to me so don't talk shit about me to others, he packed his stuff, I waited until his gone and packed my stuff too and called my grandma to pick me up (16 November 2025), I gave the keys to the landlord and left with my grandma, I have been here since. We have been texting, I'm keeping it friendly because I don't want more drama, the break up made things enough awkward.

Mike: we are still friends but maybe one day I will just ask you to marry me and stop our crap and be together again. You will always have a place by me, we just have to stop our crap and be together but it depends on you and how you feel, if you feel you want to to go on with your life by all means then I go on, like you saw how I go on with my life, I just sit here and watch movies. I'm not going to stop you from going on with your life and your not going to stop me, will see what will happen. I love you very much and almost gave you a kiss but decided against it

Me: I love you very much too but I don't want to fight every day over small things, the day we broke up I wasn't mad but you thought I was.

Mike: I'm very sorry about that but why dit you move out ??? You could've stay but that's fine, everything will happen for a reason but that's fine will see what happens.

Me: You said your moving out and I can't afford the house rent on my own

Mike: Yes I did say that but I won't be able to because where would I go, I can't stay with my mother or sister again because I'm used to being on my own doing my own thing, so I would have been gone just for the night and then back to the house but that's fine, chat again later. I want to quickly finish watching the movie, I still haven't but you should think about it and then you talk to me one day when your ready to talk please, I'm waiting for you

Me: How was I supposed to know that

Enjoy the movie

I don't know, it just feels like the fights will always be there, and I believe you also don't want to fight every day but it still happens. I'd rather be on my own than fight every day, no matter how much I love you. And you said lately you don't even want to come home anymore, how would you feel if I said that to you? All I said was, 'Then why are we still together?' The rest was your decision.

*You also asked me if someone visits me when you're not home ""no, no one visits me. I come home, clean quickly where I can, and if I’m cooking that day, I start with the food. If someone were here, I’d tell you. Believe me, I really just tried my best.

Mike: Okay, no then it's fine like that. I tried, but if that's how you take it, then so be it. I won’t try again. Now I know how you feel. Have a good evening, and sorry that I bothered and asked. Enjoy your evening.

Me: You didn’t bother me. Have a good evening too.

Sorry if you took it the wrong way, I just wanted to explain that I don’t think it will work between us, especially because of the constant fights. I didn’t mean it in a hurtful way.

Mike didn't reply after that just said his usual good morning images the next day. Now I feel shitty",1,1766844625.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1pwyo1b,https://www.reddit.com/r/WLW_PH/comments/1pwyo1b/crush_work_crush_invited_me_to_dinner/,[Crush] Work crush invited me to dinner,"The Friday before Christmas, I had no choice but to work onsite because an emergency came at lahat ng tao sa team ko, outside of Metro Manila. Ang sama sama ng loob ko kasi out of all days na mago-onsite, it was the freaking Friday before Christmas week. Iniisip ko pa lang yung hassle ng traffic pauwi, naiiyak na ako.

I was sulking the whole commute to the office until pagpasok ko, I saw my crush! Tatlo lang kami sa department namin that day and we were sitting separately. Di din kasi masyadong close (people rarely work onsite). Sure we did team lunch before, but our interactions were limited to polite ""Hello"" and ""Good morning"". Hindi din naman sa pagiging assumera but I always assumed gusto niyang makipag-close before pa but never had an opportunity for it. Kami lang din kasi magka-age range sa department namin.

Fast forward, we had separate meetings na umabot until 4 PM! Just imagine my panic kasi I was sure at least 9 PM na ako makakauwi. I was packing up pero I noticed na unlike me, parang wala pa siyang balak umuwi. Hala, ang bading, I had this sudden urge na mapalapit sa kanya! Guess what I did? NAGPANGGAP NA NAGBO-BOOK NG ANGKAS! I did make sure makikita niya na tingin ako nang tingin sa phone ko with a disappointed look, when in fact I'm not even booking at all 😭 I was praying to the gods she will get the hint.


Yun lang yata yung swerteng dumating that day because suddenly, she asked me, ""Have you booked something na? I fear mahirap na maka book now na rush hour. Do you want to grab some snacks muna?"" MISSION SUCCESS! NAG-STANDING OVATION NA LAHAT NG CELLS KO KATAWAN HAHAHAHAHAHA I made it sure to keep my disappointed face kasi para kunwari di ako naka-book ng angkas for real 😭

We just grabbed some coffee and pastries at napahaba usapan namin. She's much more prettier sa malapitan! She has this classic chinita look and she's very smart (she was from Pisay and Ateneo) and witty too. She was also wearing a linen dress and a casual blazer on top. More than that, super finesse niyang kumilos. It was like seeing a princess move.


We really got closer and we even walked around. When we walked out the cafe, she removed her blazer. SHE WAS SO PRETTY! She tucked her hair between her ear and god knows how much my heart melted. Para kong pinapanood si Mama Mary!

Snacks turned to dinner pa and I got more chance to get a better look on her face and watch her talk closely 😊 At the end of the night, she explicitly told me to have more food escapades after office in the future! AHHHHHHHH halos sumabog na puso ko. During the time na magkasama kami, I kept my cool at pinigilang mag heart eyes. I-keep natin ang cool straight girl facade. As soon as we parted, I'm pretty sure I was smiling ear to ear. Sana yung nakapansin sa'kin di na-weird out HAHAHAHA

I'm pretty certain she's straight. My gaydar has yet to fail me and I fear she's just really friendly. She definitely thinks I'm straight too 😭 Napunta kami sa usapang love and she asked if may boyfriend ako. In my part naman, I doubt this happy crush will lead to something more. I'm not the type naman to fall easily. Wag niyo akong igaya sa mga bading dito HAHAHAHA

As a bading, ang wish ko lang ay mas madalas kaming magkasabay na pumasok sa office next year. I do enjoy her company and I love na mas namo-motivate pa to work because of her. Even right now, I'm kicking my feet dahil naalala ko bigla yung araw na 'yon and I suddenly had the urge to finish a report on this fine Saturday night.

P.S 11 PM na ako nakauwi that day. Di na ako naka book for real and even rode the bus while standing kasi wala ng available. Landi pa HAHAHAHAHAHA just kidding I regret absolutely nothing 😂

I’m a 34F from Indonesia, and I’ve reached that point in life where I have enough mugs but need someone to share the brew with. I’m looking for a genuine, serious relationship with a man who knows what he wants (and hopefully, how he likes his beans).

**A little about me:** I’m a dedicated coffee lover. Whether it’s a slow-pour Sunday or a quick caffeine fix to start the day. I value deep connection over surface-level small talk. Bear with me if I yapp to much 😂

**About you:**

* **Age:** Ideally, you’re a bit older than me, but if we’re within a +/- 5-year range, let’s see if we click.
* **Mindset:** You’re looking for a partner, not a pen pal. I want someone ready for a serious commitment.
* **Distance:** I’m open to LDR! Technology is great, but let’s be real, the end goal has to be meeting in person. If we’re vibing, we should be willing to figure out the ""how"" and ""when"" of meeting in real life.

**How to catch my attention:** Skip the ""Hey, what's up?"" and send me a proper introduction. Tell me:

1. Where are you from?
2. What’s one thing I should know about you?
3. How do you take your coffee (or tea, I don't judge... much)?

If you’re ready to see if we’re a perfect blend, my inbox is open! Cheers! ☕✨",0,1766844481.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.33,False
1pwymeh,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1pwymeh/meeting_an_ex_after_no_contact/,Meeting An Ex After No Contact,"I (28M) broke up with my ex-girlfriend (32F) back in July. The crux of our issues was a difference in our communication styles and what we wanted out of a relationship. I'd also say we fell into an anxious-avoidant loop towards the end. She consistently picked at faults in the relationship, floating the idea of breaking up but never following through. I was hurt being with someone who wouldn't fully choose me. 

I broke no contact with her within the first week like 4 times. We loosely agreed to remain friends but only after we'd reached a point we were comfortable (if we got to that point). After that, we stayed no contact until October when she reached out. It wasn't even a conversation, but a brief check in. She reached out again today to wish me a Merry Christmas. I didn't think much of it but I was happy to hear from her. She then followed up, saying she only wanted meaningful relationships moving into the new year and was super direct, did I want to stay in contact or not. 

My response was essentially, yes, but not before I am ready and I won't be rushed. She said she understood and would respect that. I then, for some reason, floated the idea to meet in the new year, just for a coffee. She said she was fine to meet but when I was comfortable to do so. 

I would like to think meeting her in person would give me a clear answer on if I want her in my life. If I meet her, and feel nothing romantic or sexual, then I'd be okay with it. If I still felt something for her, then it would be best to let the connection fade out. 

For anyone who met an ex in person after no contact:

1. How did it go generally?

2. Did you speak about boundaries for the meet before hand? If so, what? 

3. What were some indications you felt ready to meet them again? 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. ",1,1766844390.0,ExNoContact,0,1.0,False

It’s icy here and I’ve already taken my walk and something about sitting here with my coffee and my thoughts and the calls of birds in the background got me thinking of the John Lennon song “Watching the Wheels”.

Anyway, another thing that would be lovely is to have a conversation partner this morning. I know my age skews older for Reddit, but I don’t feel a day older than 48 if that helps. Just kidding. 

There are so many things in life that inspire me to awe and wonder and which I love to discuss with a similarly curious soul. Music, obviously, tops the list.

1pwykun,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1pwykun/buffet_breakfast_subtle_art_of_overeating_politely/,Buffet Breakfast: Subtle Art of Overeating Politely,"A hotel’s complimentary buffet breakfast is the closest thing to a polite catastrophe . At 6:30 a.m., grown adults who normally need three alarms to wake up are already hovering outside the restaurant door like it’s a flash sale. The moment it opens, civilisation leaves the room . People surge forward with the desperation of a species that fears the poori might run away.

The continental section sits there, lonely, untouched. Croissants looking depressed, bread slices drying in the AC because the true desi minimalists walk past them like past bad memories. Bread and eggs? Why again? They station themselves at the dosa counter with the same intensity that they used for land disputes.

Meanwhile the Full-Hog Overachievers begin their day’s construction work: plate upon plate stacked with paratha touching pasta touching pineapple touching ideological confusion. They aren’t here to eat; they are here to economically punish the hotel for daring to include breakfast in the tariff. A subset of them say “ nothing is good” before they go for a second helping. Another guest drinks nine cups of masala chai and wonders aloud why his BP is rising. The rest of us know.

Then come the Protein Bros, those majestic creatures whose arms enter the buffet three seconds before the rest of their body. They demand fourteen egg whites and bargain like they’re at Chickpet. One bro even pours whey powder into sambar, declaring it a fusion dish. The chef’s soul quietly exits his body.

Nearby, a diabetic guest requests a strict egg-white omelette while simultaneously dual-wielding mango and pineapple juice like nutritional nunchucks. Their glucose meter files for voluntary retirement. And just when the buffet thinks it has seen enough, the rich sleepers float in at 11:20 a.m.Breakfast long gone, even the toaster unplugged. But time, to them, is a rumour. They demand pancakes from the void, and hotel staff obey with the resignation of civil servants during budget season. The order a la carte..

The business traveller meanwhile is on Day four and has a serving of toast–fried egg–coffee déjà vu. He pockets bananas like he’s smuggling state secrets, sips coffee with dead eyes, and silently wonders when he last felt joy. Children, on the other hand, are pure chaos wrapped in sugar.They are charging at waffles, drowning them in chocolate syrup, and rejecting anything that looks remotely like nutrition. The hotel staff steps aside as they sprint past, muffins in both hands like victorious gladiators. Their moms are trying to feed them something they detest. The dads overlook this event…

Uncles are the true apex predators: poori, dosa soaked in ghee, pongal the size of a meteor, five cups of chai, and then the inevitable announcement “I eat very light these days.”

Fitness Moms interrogate the buffet like they’re cracking a terror cell: “Which oil? Which farm? What breed of almond?” And after all this detective work, they consume three papaya cubes and radiate smug wellness.

Foreign tourists wander around in innocent confusion, eating idli with jam, mixing chutney with muesli, sipping sambar like broth until suddenly their tongue goes numb and they realise India has entered their bloodstream.

The lonely cereal guy sits surrounded by 800 calories of joy and chooses cornflakes anyway, crunching like he’s punishing himself for existing.

Somewhere, an influencer couple rearranges that poori for 40 minutes, taking photos from all angles. By the time they finish, the poori has the emotional stability of a punctured balloon. Nearby, professional buffet looters stuff muffins into handbags, slip bread rolls into jacket pockets, and walk out rustling like walking vegetable markets.

And through all of this, someone always makes an impossible request from masala cornflakes, gluten-free poha to a sugar-free gulab jamun while the staff stares into the horizon questioning every life choice.

A complimentary buffet breakfast is not nourishment. It is revenge, it is childhood trauma, it is class struggle, it is comedy, it is tragedy, it is a deeply personal confrontation with carbs.

It is the Olympics of Paisa Vasool. And after the dust settles, after the plates are cleared, after the last banana is smuggled away, everyone makes the same bold declaration:

“Tomorrow, I’ll eat light.”

And of course, as we leave, all of us are already telling the same lie to ourselves, the oldest lie in the history of complimentary breakfasts:
Tomorrow, we’ll behave better.
Tomorrow arrives.

We won’t.

Dear Anyone,

Recently life has just been passing by like wind. Thankfully not too fast, just enough. Which made me realize I should get myself on track.

My life and self issues have been a on and off thing for some years now. However, there was improvement then also stuff that made my mental health go \*slightly\* downhill. Thankfully I had and have antidepressants and awareness of my mental health prior to this. Whereas younger me would have struggled. So basically it was easier to manage.

But like all things, “this old air” also needs to be let go. To flow with the rest of the breeze. Just as time has. So it’s time vent/share and write some goals. To finally move on from this old energy. What was this old air? Well..

At the end of 2024 I ran into trouble. This was my 2nd year stepping out of my (social) comfort zone. I was trying to talk to every other adult. Even if they were much older than me. Just to practice socialization. And hoping that I would make friends with other \*young adults.\*

Although this wasn’t the worst idea… I realized I may have been too friendly. Especially when you’re a recovering people pleaser. It taught me a lot at least.. Keep that in mind. And the fact I would say I am sheltered? But it was more of inexperience with adult males? I was basically a young adult who didn’t talk to men in high school. So I sheltered myself..?

I met this guy from another country. He seemed like he wanted a relationship after 2 weeks. Even though I told him I only wanted friendship. He asked if I wanted to buy a bird together and then later on move in. It was creepy, so I blocked him.

Later on after that a random Caucasian boy asked me out at my new workplace. Let’s just say he was rejected, nicely. The next day I said “hello,” to be friendly and he ran away. This made me feel guilty.

So when this other.. you guessed it.. another boy at work asks me out. Well sort of.. He didn’t ask me out, but his intentions were obvious. Because he wasn’t direct, I thought I would give him a chance. Maybe he’s feeling the vibe first.

That’s part one! It’s short because I made this early this morning, where I am. Time for goals!

1. Hangout with my cat.
2. Do 1 chore.
3. Drink one less cup of coffee.",1,1766844149.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False
1pwyj95,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PixiesPantry/comments/1pwyj95/what_happens_at_different_ball_vape_temperatures/,What Happens at Different Ball Vape Temperatures,"# How Heat Shapes Flavor, Terpenes, and Experience

Ball vaping is not about hitting a single “perfect” temperature.

It’s about **movement through temperature**.

Unlike combustion, where everything burns at once, ball vapes allow you to expose flower to **graduated heat**. This gives aromatic compounds time to release in stages, rather than collapsing into smoke.

What you taste, feel, and experience depends entirely on **where you start — and how far you go**.

# Why Temperature Matters So Much in Ball Vaping

Terpenes and cannabinoids do not all vaporize at the same temperature.

Each compound has:

* its own boiling range
* its own volatility
* its own sensitivity to heat

Ball vapes excel because they deliver **even, consistent thermal mass**, allowing precise control over how heat transfers into the flower. Instead of scorching the surface, the flower warms gradually from the outside inward.

As a result, **different temperature ranges reveal entirely different chemical profiles**.

# Low Temperature Ball Vaping (300–350°F / 150–175°C)

# Where Rare Terpenes Live

This range is where most people have their first revelation.

At lower ball-vape temperatures, the heat is sufficient to vaporize **light, highly volatile terpenes** — but not enough to degrade them.

# What’s happening chemically:

* Fragile monoterpenes vaporize first
* Rare, low-concentration compounds survive
* Cannabinoids remain mostly inactive
* Flower structure stays intact

# What you experience:

* Bright, delicate flavor
* Floral, citrus, green, or herbal notes
* Very smooth vapor
* Minimal throat irritation

This is the range where **rare terpenes finally get a voice**. These compounds are often destroyed instantly in smoking and even lost in high-temp vaping.

Low-temp ball vaping lets you *taste what was always there*.

# Mid-Range Ball Vaping (350–390°F / 175–200°C)

# Balance Between Flavor and Effect

This is where most people spend the majority of their sessions.

At these temperatures, the flower releases a broader spectrum of compounds while still preserving much of its aromatic complexity.

# What’s happening chemically:

* Most common terpenes vaporize fully
* Many cannabinoids activate
* Heavier aromatic compounds emerge
* Vapor density increases

# What you experience:

* Fuller flavor with more body
* Deeper earth, spice, and resin notes
* Stronger effects
* Still smooth, but more substantial vapor

This range creates **dimension**. Flavor evolves from inhale to inhale, rather than hitting all at once.

For many, this is the sweet spot where **complexity and satisfaction meet**.

# High Temperature Ball Vaping (390–430°F / 200–220°C)

# Maximum Extraction, Less Nuance

At higher temperatures, extraction becomes aggressive.

This range prioritizes **completeness over subtlety**.

# What’s happening chemically:

* Remaining cannabinoids vaporize
* Heavier sesquiterpenes release
* Some lighter terpenes degrade
* Plant material approaches thermal breakdown

# What you experience:

* Dense, powerful vapor
* Reduced sweetness and brightness
* More roasted or nutty notes
* Strong physiological effects

Flavor becomes less layered and more uniform. While still far cleaner than combustion, this range sacrifices nuance in favor of intensity.

This is best used **after** lower-temperature passes, not instead of them.

# Why Starting Low Changes Everything

One of the most important lessons in ball vaping is **starting low and working upward**.

When you begin at higher temperatures:

* Rare terpenes evaporate instantly
* Delicate notes never appear
* Flavor collapses into a single profile

When you start low:

* You capture volatile compounds first
* Flavor unfolds in stages
* Each temperature range adds something new

This is why experienced users often describe ball vaping as **progressive tasting**, similar to wine or coffee.

# Ball Vapes vs Combustion

Combustion overwhelms chemistry.

At flame temperatures:

* Terpenes burn before vaporizing
* Rare compounds disappear immediately
* Flavor becomes secondary to smoke

Ball vaping, by contrast, lets heat **do its job slowly**.

Instead of shouting, the plant speaks.

# Reading Flavor as Information

Once you understand temperature ranges, flavor becomes feedback.

You begin to notice:

* Which flowers shine at lower heat
* Which need warmth to open up
* How curing and freshness affect taste
* Where terpene balance lives

This turns vaping into **sensory literacy**, not just consumption.

# At [Pixie’s Pantry](http://pixies-pantry.com/shop)

At [Pixie’s Pantry](http://pixies-pantry.com), we believe in the power of terpenes and their effects — and in respecting the conditions that allow them to exist.

Ball vaping aligns with that belief because it preserves nuance rather than destroying it. It gives each compound time to appear, express itself, and fade naturally.

That is where understanding lives.

# The Takeaway

Ball vape temperature is not a setting.

It’s a conversation.

Low temperatures reveal the rare and delicate.  
Mid-range heat builds complexity.  
Higher temperatures complete the picture.

When you let flower move through these stages instead of forcing it all at once, you unlock depth that most people never taste.

Once you experience this progression, flavor stops being accidental — and starts becoming intentional.

For many people, smoking flower has always felt like a single, familiar experience.

You:

  
Grind.

Light.

Inhale.



The flavor hits fast, sharp, and hot. Then it fades.



But beneath that experience lies an entirely different world—one that most people never get to taste.

Dry herb vaping opens that world.

By heating flower gently instead of burning it, dry herb vaporizers allow aromatic compounds—especially rare and delicate terpenes—to emerge intact. The result is not just smoother vapor, but a layered, evolving flavor experience that reveals the true character of each flower.

For the first time, you don’t just consume the plant.

You listen to it.

# Why Smoking Hides Flavor

Traditional smoking relies on combustion. When flame touches flower, temperatures instantly exceed 900°F. At that heat:

Many terpenes are destroyed before they reach your nose Subtle aromatics are burned off immediately Flavor collapses into a single, charred note The experience becomes dominated by heat and smoke

This is why so many flowers end up tasting “the same” when smoked, even if their terpene profiles are wildly different on paper.

Rare terpenes—those that exist in trace amounts or evaporate at lower temperatures—simply never get a chance to speak.

They vanish in the flame.

# What Dry Herb Vaping Does Differently

Dry herb vaping replaces combustion with controlled heat.

Instead of burning the plant, a vaporizer gradually raises the temperature of the flower to the point where terpenes and cannabinoids vaporize—turning into inhalable vapor—without igniting the plant matter itself.

This distinction changes everything.

Because terpenes each vaporize at different temperatures, vaping allows them to be released in sequence, rather than all at once—or not at all.

The experience becomes progressive.

# Terpenes Are Temperature-Sensitive by Nature

Terpenes are volatile compounds. That volatility is what allows scent to travel—but it also makes them fragile.

Some terpenes evaporate at very low temperatures. Others require more heat to release. Many rare terpenes sit at the lower end of that spectrum.

With a dry herb vaporizer, you can:

Start low to capture light, floral, citrus, and herbal notes Gradually increase temperature to unlock deeper, earthier tones Experience how flavor shifts from inhale to inhale

This is where depth emerges.

Suddenly, flower has stages—like wine, coffee, or chocolate.

# The Role of Precision Devices

Not all vaporizers are equal.

Devices designed with precise heat control, wide temperature ranges, and even airflow allow users to intentionally explore terpene profiles rather than blasting past them.

A device like the [SS Zeal Kit Lite](https://cloud-connoisseur.company.site/products/SS-Zeal-Kit-Lite-p611851552) (a ball vape, my preferred and the one I personally purchased and used on a daily basis) is built to accommodate controlled extraction across a broad thermal range. When paired with the right bowl and technique, this kind of setup lets you slow the experience down and tune into what’s actually present in the plant.

Instead of overwhelming the flower, you let it unfold.

The First Time You Taste the “Hidden Notes”

People who switch from smoking to dry herb vaping often report the same moment of realization:

>

That’s because vaping doesn’t flatten flavor—it reveals it.

Suddenly, you notice:

Pine that smells fresh instead of harsh Citrus that feels juicy rather than acidic Earth that’s damp and rich, not burnt Floral notes that were never detectable before

These aren’t imaginary differences. They are terpenes finally surviving the process.

# Rare Terpenes Finally Get a Voice

Rare terpenes exist in smaller concentrations and are often more volatile. In combustion, they disappear instantly.

In vaping, they emerge first.

Low-temperature draws are where these compounds shine. This is where you encounter:

Soft green notes Light fruit skins Floral undertones Forest-floor aromas

These terpenes don’t dominate. They whisper.

And because vaping allows you to stay in this range longer, you can actually taste them.

Flavor Becomes an Experience, Not a Byproduct

With smoking, flavor is something you get briefly—then tolerate until the effect arrives.

With vaping, flavor becomes the experience itself.

You may notice:

Early draws taste bright and delicate Mid-session draws feel fuller and rounder Later draws deepen into warmth and spice

Each stage corresponds to different terpene groups being released.

Instead of a single hit, you get a narrative.

Why This Changes How Flower Feels

Terpenes don’t just influence flavor. They shape how an experience unfolds in the body.

When rare terpenes are preserved:

Effects feel more guided Transitions are smoother The experience feels intentional rather than blunt

This is why many people describe vaping as “clearer” or “more dimensional.”

It’s not just about less smoke—it’s about more information making it through.

A New Kind of Relationship With Flower

Dry herb vaping invites attention.

You start noticing:

Which strains shine at lower temperatures Which need more heat to open up How different cultivars express themselves differently

Over time, you stop consuming flower the same way every time.

You explore it.

# Why Devices Matter Less Than Approach—but Still Matter

The device itself doesn’t create flavor. The plant does.

However, a well-designed vaporizer makes it possible to access that flavor without destroying it. Devices that support stable heat, consistent airflow, and gradual extraction allow terpenes to do what they’re meant to do.

They create space.

From Consumption to Sensory Literacy

This is where dry herb vaping becomes more than a method.

It becomes education.

You begin to learn:

What freshness tastes like What curing changes What terpene balance feels like

Flower stops being generic.

It becomes expressive.

# At [Pixie’s Pantry](https://pixies-pantry.com/)

At Pixie’s Pantry, we believe in the power of terpenes and their effects—not as marketing buzzwords, but as real botanical compounds that shape how we feel, taste, and connect with plants.

Dry herb vaping aligns with that belief because it honors the chemistry of the flower instead of overpowering it.

It allows plants to speak in full sentences, not just exclamations.

# The Takeaway

Dry herb vaping doesn’t just make flower smoother.

It makes it legible.

By preserving rare terpenes and allowing flavor to unfold gradually, it unlocks an entirely new experience—one defined by depth, nuance, and discovery.

Once you taste flower this way, it becomes difficult to go back.

I’m 25 and from ages 22 to 25 I lived in my bed. Not just slept there. Lived there.

Ate in bed, worked from bed when I had to, scrolled in bed, watched everything in bed, basically existed horizontally for three years. My bed became my entire world and I rarely left my room.

My room was disgusting. Food wrappers and containers piled on my nightstand and floor. Dishes I’d used days ago still sitting there. Empty water bottles everywhere. Dirty clothes in piles. Hadn’t opened my curtains in months. The smell was stale and gross.

Showered maybe twice a week because getting out of bed felt impossible. Would wear the same clothes for days. Brushing teeth felt like too much effort most days.

Had a remote job doing data entry making $35k. Did the bare minimum from my laptop in bed. Camera always off in meetings. Barely spoke. Just enough work to not get fired.

No social life. Hadn’t hung out with anyone in person in over a year. All my friendships existed through texts I’d send from bed. Most had stopped reaching out because I always said no to plans.

Dating was nonexistent. Hadn’t been on a date in three years. The thought of leaving my room to meet someone felt overwhelming. Easier to just stay in bed alone.

Ordered all my food. Breakfast, lunch, dinner, all delivered to my door. I’d get up, grab it, bring it to bed. Sometimes wouldn’t even get up and it would sit outside my door for hours until I absolutely had to move.

My family was worried but didn’t know what to do. They’d call and I’d say I’m fine just tired. They knew something was wrong but I’d deflect every conversation.

The worst part was I knew this wasn’t normal. Every night I’d lie there thinking about how I’d spent another entire day in bed doing nothing. Then I’d wake up and do it again.

Three years of my life spent horizontal. While everyone else was out living, I was in bed rotting.

The moment I realized how bad it was

This was about four months ago. My older sister was getting married. Destination wedding in another state. My parents paid for my flight and hotel hoping I’d actually show up.

Almost didn’t go. The thought of leaving my room for a whole weekend felt impossible. But my mom basically begged. Said it would break my sister’s heart if I wasn’t there.

So I went. Hadn’t left my room besides getting food from the door in weeks. The airport felt overwhelming. Too many people, too much stimulation, too bright.

Got to the hotel and immediately went to the bed. Stayed there until I absolutely had to get ready for wedding stuff. Even then I was late to everything because leaving the bed was so hard.

At the rehearsal dinner people were asking what I’d been up to. I said working remotely. They’d ask what I do for fun and I’d give vague answers. Everyone could tell something was off.

My cousin who I used to be close with asked if I was okay. Said I seemed different, more withdrawn. I said I’m fine just tired. She didn’t believe me but let it go.

Wedding day I forced myself to get up and get ready. Looked terrible in photos because I’d barely slept and looked pale and sick from never going outside.

During the reception my aunt made a speech about my sister. Talked about how she’d always been driven and full of life. How she’d built a great career, found an amazing partner, had close friendships. How proud everyone was of her.

I sat there realizing my sister and I grew up in the same house but she’d built an entire life and I’d spent three years in bed. The contrast was brutal.

After the reception I went back to my room and just laid on the hotel bed. Realized I’d been at a wedding, surrounded by family, and all I wanted was to be back in my bed at home.

That’s when it hit me. I wasn’t just tired. I was addicted to my bed. It had become my safety blanket, my escape, my entire world. And I’d wasted three years of my life because leaving it felt impossible.

Where I actually was

25 years old living alone in a one bedroom apartment. Rent was $900 but I barely used the space. Just my bedroom.

Working remotely making $35k doing basic data entry. Had this job for three years and never got a raise because I did the bare minimum from bed.

Daily routine was wake up around 10am or 11am in bed, grab my laptop from the nightstand, log in for work from bed, do maybe 3 hours of actual work, spend the rest of the day in bed scrolling or watching stuff, order food, eat in bed, stay up till 2-3am in bed, sleep, repeat.

My bed was my office, dining room, living room, entertainment center. Everything happened there. Had a little setup with chargers and remote controls and snacks all within reach so I never had to get up.

Physically was deteriorating. Gained probably 30 pounds from never moving. Back pain from lying down 20+ hours daily. Posture was destroyed. Skin was terrible from never going outside. Looked sick because I basically was.

Mental state was terrible. Constant brain fog. No energy or motivation. Felt detached from reality. Everything felt muted and grey. Wasn’t technically depressed maybe but definitely not okay.

Social skills were gone. Hadn’t had a real in person conversation in months. Would get anxious just thinking about going somewhere with people.

Bank account had maybe $4000 saved despite making $35k because I spent so much on food delivery. Probably spent $400-500 monthly just on delivered meals because cooking meant leaving bed.

My apartment was a mess. Kitchen hadn’t been used in months. Living room furniture had dust on it. Bathroom was only room I used besides bedroom and even then I avoided it as long as possible.

The shame was constant. Knowing I was wasting my twenties lying in bed. Knowing my family worried. Knowing this wasn’t normal but feeling unable to change.

Week 1-4 (trying to leave the bed, failing)

Day after the wedding I flew home and immediately got back in bed. Told myself tomorrow I’d start changing. Set an alarm for 9am. Snoozed it and stayed in bed till noon.

Told myself I’d eat breakfast at my kitchen table instead of bed. Made it to the kitchen, felt exposed and uncomfortable standing, brought food back to bed.

Told myself I’d work from my desk instead of bed. Sat at my desk for 20 minutes, felt wrong and uncomfortable, went back to bed with my laptop.

Week 2 tried forcing myself to stay out of bed during the day. Made it till 1pm before the pull was too strong and I got back in. Stayed there the rest of the day.

The bed felt safe. Everywhere else felt overwhelming and exposed. My room was the only place I felt okay and my bed was the only place in my room I felt comfortable.

Week 3 realized I couldn’t just willpower my way out of this. I’d been trying to leave my bed for three years and always ended up back in it.

Week 4 I was on reddit at 2am lying in bed and found a post about someone who’d been bedbound from depression and recovered. They mentioned using structured programs that forced you out of bed in small increments.

Figured I’d try because nothing else had worked.

App was called Reload. Downloaded it while lying in bed obviously.

It asked detailed questions. How many hours per day are you in bed, what prevents you from leaving, what’s your current situation, what do you want to change.

I was honest. Said I’m in bed 20+ hours daily, only leave for bathroom and food delivery, work from bed, feel like leaving bed causes anxiety, want to be able to function like a normal person.

It built a 60 day program starting at absolute zero. Week 1 tasks were almost laughably simple. Spend 30 minutes out of bed twice this week, eat one meal not in bed, sit at desk for 15 minutes.

But it also tracked my bed time. Had to log when I got in bed and when I got out. Seeing 22 hours in bed displayed as a number was confronting.

Week 5-10 (small escapes)

Week 5 I forced myself to do the tasks. 30 minutes out of bed felt eternal. Sat on my couch feeling anxious and uncomfortable. Kept checking the time. Finally it was over and I went back to bed.

Ate one meal at my kitchen table. Felt wrong. Felt exposed. Finished as fast as possible and went back to bed.

But I’d done the tasks. My bed time that week dropped from 22 hours to 20 hours daily. Tiny progress.

Week 6 tasks increased. One hour out of bed daily, work from desk for 30 minutes, take a 10 minute walk outside.

The walk was brutal. Hadn’t been outside besides the wedding in months. Sunlight hurt. Fresh air felt weird. Made it 10 minutes and immediately went home to bed.

But again I’d done it. Bed time dropped to 18 hours daily.

Week 7 my body started adjusting. One hour out of bed felt slightly less terrible. Still uncomfortable but not panic inducing.

Started working from my desk for the required 30 minutes before going to bed with my laptop. Small change but it was change.

Week 8 tasks were 2 hours out of bed daily, eat all meals not in bed, work full day from desk.

Two hours felt long. Would count down the minutes. But made it through. Meals at the table felt less weird. Working from desk for a full day was hard but doable.

Bed time dropped to 15 hours daily. Still high but better than 22.

Week 9 posted in the app community about how hard it was to not just stay in bed all day. Got responses from people who’d been bedbound for years saying it gets easier, keep pushing.

Week 10 realized my bed wasn’t the safe haven I thought it was. It was a prison. I’d felt safe there but really it was just keeping me from living.

Week 11-18 (building a life outside bed)

Week 11 tasks jumped. 4 hours out of bed during waking hours, only use bed for sleep, establish a morning routine outside of bed.

Four hours felt like forever but I did it. Forcing myself to only use bed for sleep was hard. Would finish work and instinctively head to bed. Had to stop myself and sit on the couch instead.

Morning routine was brutal. Wake up and immediately leave bed instead of lying there for an hour scrolling. Get dressed, make coffee, sit at table. Felt wrong for weeks.

Week 12 my manager asked if I wanted to go full time with more responsibilities and a raise to $45k. Would’ve said no normally. Too overwhelming. But I’d been building tolerance for discomfort so I said yes.

Week 13 started the new role. More work meant more time at my desk, less time in bed. Was exhausted by end of each day but in a good way.

Week 14 went to a coffee shop to work for a few hours. First time working in public in three years. Felt anxious but made it through. Proved I could function outside my apartment.

Week 15 my bed time was down to 9 hours daily. Just sleep. Everything else happened outside of bed. That felt surreal after three years.

Week 16 my sister called and asked if I wanted to visit for a weekend. Old me would’ve said no immediately. Made myself say yes.

Visited and actually left the guest bedroom to hang out with her and her husband. Had real conversations. Functioned like a normal person. She said I seemed more present.

Week 17 started going to a gym. Working out forced me to be vertical and active. Body was so weak from three years horizontal but it was necessary.

Week 18 I sold my current bed and bought a less comfortable one. Sounds weird but my old bed was like a cloud. Too comfortable. New one was fine for sleeping but not somewhere I wanted to hang out all day.

Where I am now

It’s been 5 months since my sister’s wedding. Everything is different.

Wake up at 8am and immediately leave bed. Morning routine outside of bed. Work full time at my desk making $45k. Gym 4 times a week. Eat all meals at my table. Only use bed for actual sleep, average 7-8 hours nightly.

Physically improving. Lost 20 pounds from actually moving. Back pain decreasing. Posture improving. Actually have energy during the day from being vertical.

Started hanging out with people again. Met up with old friends who were shocked I actually showed up. They said I seem alive again instead of zombie-like.

My apartment is actually used now. Cook in my kitchen. Sit in my living room. The space is for living not just storage.

Most importantly I’m not addicted to my bed anymore. It’s just a place I sleep. Not my entire world. Not my prison.

My family noticed immediately. My mom said I sounded better on the phone. My sister said whatever changed is working. My dad said he’s glad I came to the wedding because it seemed like the wake up call I needed.

The person who spent three years horizontal is gone. Can’t get those years back but I’m not wasting more time in bed.

What actually worked

Willpower didn’t do it. Tried willing myself out of bed for years. Never stuck. Needed external systems.

That app structure was critical. Starting with 30 minutes out of bed and building slowly. Jumping from 22 hours to 8 hours immediately would’ve failed.

Tracking bed hours made me confront reality. Seeing the number displayed made me face how bad it was.

The gradual exposure therapy worked. Small amounts of time out of bed building tolerance. Eventually being out of bed felt normal instead of wrong.

Getting more responsibilities at work forced me into desk time. Had to be out of bed to do the work.

Buying a less comfortable bed removed the appeal. Not wanting to hang out in bed all day because it wasn’t that comfortable.

The community helped. Other people who’d been bedbound understanding exactly what I meant.

If you’re addicted to your bed

Or if you spend 15+ hours daily in bed avoiding life, I understand. Bed feels safe and everywhere else feels overwhelming.

But you’re losing years lying horizontal while life passes by. Everyone else is living and you’re in bed watching time disappear.

You’re not going to just decide to stop. I tried deciding for three years. Didn’t work. You need external systems.

Get structure that starts impossibly small. 30 minutes out of bed is achievable even when 4 hours isn’t.

Track your bed hours. Seeing the number makes it real. You can’t lie to yourself when it’s tracked.

Build tolerance gradually. Small increments of time out of bed. Let your nervous system adjust before increasing.

Force structure into your day. Work from a desk not bed. Eat at a table not bed. Create reasons to be vertical.

Consider getting a less comfortable bed. If your bed is too appealing you’ll always want to be there.

Get responsibilities that require being out of bed. More work, commitments, anything that forces you vertical.

Join communities of people fighting the same thing. Knowing others understand helps.

Start tracking today. Right now. See how many hours you’re actually in bed. That’s your baseline.

Final thoughts

Three years ago I became addicted to my bed and stopped leaving my room. Spent ages 22-25 horizontal while everyone else lived vertically.

Five months ago I finally started escaping. Today I only use my bed for sleep and I’m not wasting my life lying down anymore.

Can’t get back those three years. But I stopped wasting more time.

Five months from now you could be vertical and living. Or you could still be in bed, just older with more wasted time.

Leave your bed. Start today.

Get structure, track hours, build slowly, force yourself vertical.

The person spending 20 hours daily in bed doesn’t have to be who you are forever.

dm me if you need help. I’m not an expert I’m just someone who was addicted to my bed and figured out how to leave it.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",2,1766843570.0,LockedInMan,0,1.0,False
1pwyat2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PixiesPantry/comments/1pwyat2/rare_terpenes_the_hidden_aromas_shaping_scent_mood/,Rare Terpenes: The Hidden Aromas Shaping Scent & Mood,"Close your eyes and inhale.

We’re inspired by the complexity of plants at [Pixie's Pantry](http://pixies-pantry.com/) — from bold aromas to the subtle influence of **rare terpenes** that shape scent, mood, and experience.

What do you smell? Perhaps it’s the sharp, aggressive sting of pine needles, or the bright, zesty punch of a lemon peel. These are the celebrities of the botanical world: Pinene and Limonene. They are the loud, front-row stars of the aromatic spectrum, found in everything from cannabis strains to floor cleaners.

These dominant terpenes are easy to recognize because they bind quickly to our olfactory receptors, triggering instant pattern recognition in the brain. We’ve smelled them so often that our nervous system categorizes them almost automatically.

But if you lean in closer—past the obvious, past the loud—there is a hidden layer. A subtle whisper of green apple skin; a faint, woody breath of rose; a humid, earthy undertone of rainforest soil.

These softer notes often take longer to register because they activate different receptor pathways and linger at lower volatility levels, revealing themselves slowly rather than all at once.

Welcome to the world of **rare terpenes**.

While the mainstream market obsesses over the ""Big Five"" terpenes, true connoisseurs, botanists, and aromatherapists are turning their attention to the B-sides of the biological soundtrack. These elusive compounds offer more than just unique aromas; they possess complex therapeutic potential and introduce nuance that fundamentally alters how a plant feels, not just how it smells.

This shift mirrors what happened in wine, coffee, and chocolate culture—where depth, origin, and subtle variation became more valuable than sheer intensity.

Let’s step into the secret garden and explore the rare terpenes that are quietly revolutionizing how we experience flavor and fragrance.

# Why ""Rare"" Matters

Before we meet the cast, we must understand the stage. Terpenes are aromatic organic hydrocarbons found in the essential oils of plants. They are synthesized in specialized plant cells called trichomes and secretory glands, where they serve both protective and communicative functions.

Terpenes evolved for defense (to repel insects and pathogens) and attraction (to lure pollinators), but they also play a role in regulating a plant’s internal stress response, particularly in harsh environments.

Why are some rare?

1. **Low Concentration:** Some terpenes appear in such minute quantities (less than 0.05% of a plant's profile) that they are often chemically overshadowed by dominant compounds, even though they may exert outsized influence on aroma perception.
2. **Volatility:** Some molecules are so light and unstable that they evaporate almost instantly after harvest. This means drying, curing, or heat exposure can erase them entirely before the consumer ever encounters the plant.
3. **Extraction Difficulty:** Capturing these compounds often requires sub-critical or low-temperature extraction techniques. High heat or aggressive solvents fracture their molecular structure, flattening complexity.

When you encounter a rare terpene, you are experiencing a chemical event that nature designed to be fleeting—a moment that exists only under very specific conditions.

# The Gallery of Elusive Scents

Here are five rare terpenes that deserve a place on your radar.

# 1. Valencene: The Sunshine Molecule

**The Profile:** Sweet, fresh, citrusy, woody  
**Where it hides:** Valencia oranges, cannabis, grapefruit

If Limonene is the sour rind of a lemon, Valencene is the sweet, juicy flesh of a ripe orange. Named after the Valencia orange, this sesquiterpene adds warmth and roundness to citrus profiles, making them feel fuller and less sharp.

Valencene is structurally larger than most citrus terpenes, which slows its evaporation rate and allows it to linger longer in the aromatic experience.

**The Experience:**  
Valencene is chemically a precursor to Nootkatone (the signature scent of grapefruit), making it both reactive and expressive. In aromatherapy and cannabis culture, it is associated with elevated mood, mental clarity, and gentle stimulation without the jitteriness common to sharper citrus compounds.

It often appears subtly—revealing itself after the initial brightness fades—like sunshine filtered through leaves.

# 2. Farnesene: The Green Apple Calm

**The Profile:** Green apple skin, woody, floral, berry-like  
**Where it hides:** Green apple skins, turmeric, sandalwood, hops

Have you ever wondered why the smell of a green apple feels crisp yet soothing? That sensation is Farnesene. Unlike citrus-forward terpenes, Farnesene lacks acidity, replacing sharpness with a smooth, waxy fruit note.

Chemically, Farnesene belongs to a group of sesquiterpenes that interact more slowly with sensory receptors, which contributes to its calming perception.

**The Experience:**  
In nature, Farnesene acts as a pheromone for insects. In humans, it has demonstrated muscle-relaxant and sedative tendencies, likely due to its interaction with the central nervous system. Many people describe its effects as “quieting” rather than sedating.

If a plant smells like an orchard after rain and makes your shoulders drop without you noticing when it happened, Farnesene is often responsible.

# 3. Nerolidol: The Bark of the Forest

**The Profile:** Woody, earthy, floral, melon, mushroom  
**Where it hides:** Jasmine, tea tree, ginger, lemongrass

Nerolidol is a heavy, grounding terpene. It smells like the forest floor—not the trees above, but the damp bark, decomposing leaves, and rich soil below. It sits at the intersection of floral sweetness and earthy depth.

Because of its molecular structure, Nerolidol evaporates slowly and persists longer than lighter terpenes, contributing to a lingering, enveloping aroma.

**The Experience:**  
Nerolidol is known as a transdermal penetrant, meaning it enhances the absorption of other compounds through the skin. This property has made it valuable in topical formulations and traditional medicine.

Its effects are deeply calming, often associated with reduced anxiety, sedation, and sleep support. It doesn’t force rest—it invites it.

# 4. Ocimene: The Sweet Ghost

**The Profile:** Sweet, herbaceous, woody, tropical  
**Where it hides:** Orchids, mint, parsley, kumquats

Ocimene is the heartbreaker of the terpene world. While it’s widespread in fresh plants, it is rarely preserved in dried products due to its extreme volatility.

If you detect Ocimene, it’s often a sign that what you’re smelling is exceptionally fresh or gently handled.

**The Experience:**  
Ocimene smells like sweet earth and green air. It’s energizing, uplifting, and often associated with decongestant effects. In plants, it signals active defense and vitality.

Because it evaporates quickly, its presence is fleeting—noticed most clearly in the first inhale, then gone like a memory.

# 5. Guaiol: The Liquid Rose

**The Profile:** Piney, rosy, woodsy  
**Where it hides:** Guaiacum wood, cypress pine

Guaiol is unique because it is a sesquiterpenoid alcohol, giving it a heavier, almost velvety aromatic texture. It blends floral softness with resinous depth, acting as a stabilizing base note.

Historically, Guaiacum wood was used in natural medicine for inflammatory conditions, joint pain, and menstrual discomfort—long before its chemical composition was understood.

**The Experience:**  
Guaiol smells like a rose blooming inside a pine forest. It contributes warmth, body, and cohesion to terpene blends, often acting as the quiet structure holding brighter notes together.

# The Entourage Effect 2.0

Why should you care about these minor players? Because of the **Entourage Effect**.

Terpenes don’t act alone. They interact with cannabinoids, flavonoids, and each other, influencing how compounds are absorbed, perceived, and processed by the body.

If THC or CBD are the conductors, and Limonene is the percussion section, **rare terpenes are the strings and woodwinds**. They shape the emotional tone and physical direction of the experience.

Without rare terpenes, the experience can feel flat or one-dimensional. With them, it becomes layered, guided, and intentional.

# How to Find the Rare

We are living in a renaissance of craft botany. As consumers become more educated, nuance matters more than numbers.

1. **Read the** [**COA**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_analysis)**:** Look beyond potency percentages. Minor terpenes listed in trace amounts often have the greatest impact on how something feels.
2. **Trust Your Nose:** Complex terpene profiles evolve. If a scent shifts as you inhale—bright to soft, sweet to earthy—you’re sensing layered chemistry.
3. **Explore** [**Landrace**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landrace) **and** [**Heritage Genetics**](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/example/english/genetic-heritage)**:** Older plant varieties often preserve wider terpene diversity, unflattened by modern breeding priorities.

# Final Thoughts: The Scent of Discovery

Rare terpenes remind us that nature doesn’t shout—it *whispers*.

They reward patience, curiosity, and attention. And once you learn to notice them, you can’t stop noticing them.

The next time you peel a kumquat, walk through a damp forest, or savor a craft IPA, pause. Inhale again. Stay with it longer than you normally would.

The quiet molecules are often doing the most interesting work.

You are a liar and an addict. 

And when you are lying and smoking you are mean. You’re short-tempered, unengaged, and lazy. When you/we are in this hole you’re especially hard on me in front of my family. This is beyond embarrassing, it’s truly gut wrenching and devastating for me. 

I’ve “known” for a couple weeks when you smoked the night before our trip when you were moving the tires to the backyard. I spinelessly chose to ignore it, for the sake of the trip, for our son, and for my own sanity. This only occurred a couple weeks after “the last time.” How pathetic, on both our parts. It’s laughable really. 

You’re smoking consistently and now it appears to be enough to profoundly impact your mood, temperament, energy…

You are selfish. And it’s time for you wake up to the realities of our relationship and your situation.

Do not ask me “what do you want me to do” 
Do not tell me “I’m working on it” 
Do not tell me “it doesn’t happen overnight” 
Do not villainize me for “expecting too much” 
Do not use other things in our relationship as argument tactics

You ask me “what’s wrong” and wonder why we don’t have enough sex. How can I fake being happy and interment with someone who lies to my face week after week. Better yet, how can I be happy and interment with someone who seemingly values marijuana over their marriage, best friend, and mother of their child.

I have bad news for you. Your therapist sucks and has enabled you into thinking that you don’t have a problem. That your weed “dependency” is the same as needing a few cups of coffee. We both know that one of the core pillars of addiction is impacts on relationships. I’ll leave it at that.

Take. Real. Responsibility, action, and accountability. Accept, that despite other and inevitable relationship quirks and tensions, this is different.  I won’t say it’s isolated, because I do believe that the dynamic that’s been created has made for dysfunction in other areas. 

I refuse to walk around our house feeling like the bad guy and not speaking. However, this is all I am going to say. The responsibility now lies with you.

Some background:

I’ve been an IT tech for 20+ years. I’ve set up servers, routers, networks, managed AD, fixed production issues, deployed and ghosted OSes for a long time. I’ve mostly been a Windows guy, though I saw Linux evolve over the years.

I don’t dislike complexity because I can’t handle it — I dislike friction.

I want my tools to be reliable. For example, I could easily root my phone, but I don’t want to. It’s a tool, not a hobby, just like my car, my screwdriver, or my coffee machine: I want them to work, predictably.

Now I’m moving into a dev role and I need to choose a Linux distro for my desktop. And honestly, this has been one of the most frustrating choices I’ve ever faced.

Over the years, I’ve tried many distros: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, CentOS, Mint, openSUSE, Bazzite… and it was never “just fine”. There was always something to tweak, fix, or work around.

I feel stuck because:

* there are so many distros to choose from
* each one has small differences that are either marginally better or surprisingly annoying when missing
* I don’t want to add extra repositories controlled by random people to get nVidia drivers of  HP software
* I don’t want to rely on extensions or add-ons just to get basic desktop behavior (tiling, putting files on desktop, getting a beautiful UI that doesn't feel like 2010, dealing with fractional scaling etc.)
* I don’t want unexpected updates breaking those add-ons
* I just want to install a distro on my desktop and work, browse, listen to music etc...

I’m not claiming Windows or macOS are perfect — far from it. But their limitations are, in my case, a strength. I accept the defaults, I don’t tweak much, and things mostly work (I haven't seen a BSOD for years). And when something breaks, it’s not my responsibility to debug which extension conflicted with which update.

With Linux, I constantly feel like there is no right answer, only trade-offs I’m supposed to actively manage. At this point, choosing a distro is giving me real decision fatigue and stress.

So my honest question is:

* How do you deal with this world?
* How do you pick a distro and just commit to it without constantly second-guessing the choice or maintaining your setup?

At one time we regretted the dog so badly that we mentioned rehoming him… but our kids’ reactions quickly shut down that idea.  So we’ve come to accept our new life 🫤.

 I sooooo miss my calm mornings, and calm evenings.  I can’t ever just sit on my couch with coffee, or cuddle my kids😥.  I’m up at 5am trying to keep the dog quiet so my kids can sleep….

PLEASE give me your best advice on keeping puppy busy but quiet… something that he can do on his own with little help from me.

Alexander's voice held an unfamiliar sneer. ""Did you find it amusing, Stacy?"" 

""Just helping you vent, Stacy. After all Caroline stole both your scholarship and the game design competition championship from you.""

Terwijl ‘antifa’ een terreurlabel kreeg aangewreven, trad extreemrechts toe tot de mainstream. Hoe gaat de beweging daarmee om? En over wie hebben we het eigenlijk?

Het is rustig, nu nog wel. Aan de zijkant van het Stadhuisplein in Amersfoort kijken tientallen agenten toe hoe voor- en tegenstanders van een asielzoekerscentrum tegenover elkaar staan. Maar dan slaat de sfeer om. Vanuit een hoek van het plein nadert een plukje activisten. Een stuk of vijftien, allen in het zwart, gezichten bedekt, rood-zwarte vlaggen in de hand.

Zodra de azc-tegenstanders deze tegendemonstranten in het vizier krijgen, rennen ze er in drommen op af. ‘Laat je gezicht zien, lafaard!’, schreeuwt een vijftiger. Een vrouw roept: ‘Kankerlandverraders!’

Een dinsdagavond, eind september. Hier ontvouwt zich een tafereel dat tekenend is voor Nederland in 2025, een tafereel dat zich tientallen keren heeft afgespeeld dit jaar, overal in het land. Het is de polarisatie in de samenleving teruggebracht tot de proporties van een plein.

‘Fuck Antifa’ staat op de kleding van sommige azc-tegenstanders. Op de achterkant: ‘Good Night, Left Side’ en een plaatje van een man die wordt getrapt terwijl hij op de grond ligt. Dreigend gaan ze steeds dichter bij de activisten staan. Ze scanderen: ‘Ha-ha-ha! Antifa!’ Het lijkt alsof ze speciaal voor deze confrontatie zijn gekomen.

En de antifascisten? Die blijven stoïcijns in het aan hen toegewezen vak staan. Ze scanderen: ‘Toen niet, nu niet, nooit meer fascisme!’ Een jongen van 17, met een legerjasje vol anarchistische buttons, zegt: ‘Ik ben niet gekomen om te vechten, maar als ze aanvallen, dan sla ik terug.’ Hij heet Mark. ‘Liever geen achternaam, mijn moeder weet niet dat ik hier ben.’

De politie pakt de wapenstokken en vormt een linie tussen de groepen. Je voelt: er hoeft maar iets mis te gaan en er ontstaat een massale vechtpartij. Vanuit de groep die ‘Wij zijn Nederland!’ schreeuwt, vliegen er blikken bier richting de antifascisten. Daarna eieren. En dan: een rookbom. Er klinkt een knal en de politie begint op te rukken.

**Brandende politieauto**

Dat het op deze avond in Amersfoort uit de hand zou lopen, lag in de lijn der verwachting. Tien dagen eerder, op 20 september, vonden de Malieveldrellen plaats. Wat begon als anti-immigratieprotest eindigde met een brandende politieauto, stenen door de ruiten van het D66-kantoor en tienduizenden euro’s schade aan het Binnenhof.

De strijdlust was mede aangewakkerd door een oproep op de Facebookpagina Antifa Nederland: vanuit de antifascistische hoek zouden er tegendemonstranten komen. In zogeheten Defend-groepen en onder hooligans werden mensen opgetrommeld om de antifa-activisten weg te jagen. Met honderden tegelijk kwamen ze die zondag het Malieveld op gemarcheerd.

Maar ‘antifa’ was nergens te bekennen. Achteraf [bleek](https://www.volkskrant.nl/kijkverder/v/2025/malieveld-demonstratie-extreemrechts-den-haag-reconstructie~v1847818/) de Facebookpagina nep en niet gelieerd aan een antifascistische organisatie. Antifascisten in Nederland gebruiken de term antifa zelf ook niet.

**Vijandbeeld**

Het vijandbeeld van antifa was twee dagen voor de rellen opgestookt door [een motie](https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/detail?id=2025Z17241&did=2025D40130) van FvD die onverwacht een Kamermeerderheid kreeg. In navolging van de Verenigde Staten, waar Trump antifa na de moord op Charlie Kirk tot terroristische organisatie bestempelde, werd de regering opgeroepen dit ook in Nederland te doen.

Direct lieten terrorismekenners en juristen weten dat de motie onuitvoerbaar is. Antifa ís helemaal geen organisatie, laat staan dat er een concrete terroristische dreiging uitgaat van de beweging. Bovendien bepaalt in Nederland niet de regering of een organisatie terroristisch is, maar de rechter.

Het was al te laat: het beeld van ‘antifa-cellen’ die ‘politici bedreigen’ en ‘er niet voor terugdeinzen om geweld te gebruiken’, zoals het in de motie omschreven stond, was geschapen.

De ontwikkelingen roepen vragen op. Als antifa geen terroristische organisatie is, wat is het dan wel? Hoe veranderde de antifascistische beweging door de jaren heen? Welke tactieken hanteren de aanhangers? En hoe gaan zij om met dit vijandbeeld dat van hen wordt geschetst?

**Extreemrechts**

Wie de opkomst van het antifascistisch protest in Nederland wil schetsen, moet eerst de opkomst van extreemrechts in kaart brengen. In de eerste decennia na de Tweede Wereldoorlog bewogen mensen met nazi-sympathieën en een geloof in een raszuiver volk zich vooral ondergronds. Daar kwam vanaf het begin van de jaren zeventig verandering in.

Zo deed Joop Glimmerveen met de slogan ‘Den Haag moet blank en veilig blijven’ in 1974 mee aan de gemeenteraadsverkiezingen. Hij kreeg steun van de extreemrechtse Nederlandse Volks-Unie (NVU), die drie jaar eerder was opgericht.

‘Glimmerveen zei dat mensen last hadden van de Surinamers die destijds naar Nederland kwamen’, zegt Willem Wagenaar, die bij de Anne Frank Stichting onderzoek doet naar rechts-extremisme. ‘Niemand deed dit toen nog. Hij won er bijna een zetel mee.’

Weerstand kwam vooral uit de hoek van de Communistische Partij Nederland (CPN). Leden daarvan probeerden bijeenkomsten van de NVU te verstoren. ‘Glimmerveen ging de confrontatie met ze aan’, zegt Wagenaar. ‘Zo wist hij andere jongeren te mobiliseren, skinheads bijvoorbeeld, waardoor er voor het eerst ook gedonder op straat ontstond.’

**Kraakbeweging**

Aan het begin van de jaren tachtig mengden leden van de kraakbeweging zich in de strijd. Aanvankelijk hadden krakers zich vooral druk gemaakt over de woningnood, maar in deze periode – met soms harde confrontaties met de politie – kwamen er ook andere thema’s op de agenda, zoals de opkomst van racistische en fascistische bewegingen.

Groepen radicale antifascistische krakers richtten hun woede vooral op de Centrumpartij (CP), een afsplitsing van de NVU. Al in het oprichtingsjaar 1980 verstoorden actievoerders vergaderingen. Nadat partijleider Hans Janmaat in 1982 namens de CP in de Tweede Kamer was verkozen, werden de acties harder, schreef Jan de Vetten in 2016 in zijn promotieonderzoek naar de bestrijding van de CP en later de Centrumdemocraten (CD).

Zo gooiden krakers met bierflessen en verf bij de installatie van twee CP’ers in de gemeenteraad in Almere. In februari 1984 verstoorden gemaskerde antifascisten met ijzeren staven een cursusavond van de partij in Rotterdam. En drie maanden later trokken tweehonderd antifascisten naar een hotel in het Noord-Brabantse Boekel, waar de CP vergaderde. Ze gooiden de ruiten in en wierpen een traangasbom naar binnen.

In 1986 deden ze dit nog eens dunnetjes over bij een bijeenkomst van de CP en de daarvan afgescheiden CD. Een hotel in Kedichem ging door toedoen van de antifascisten in vlammen op. Wil Schuurman, de latere echtgenote van Janmaat, kwam daarbij ongelukkig ten val, waarna haar been geamputeerd moest worden.

**Kedichem**

Willem Wagenaar, 19 jaar oud destijds, was bij die actie in Kedichem aanwezig. Na afloop werd hij gearresteerd en als een van de weinigen berecht. Hij kreeg een gevangenisstraf van drie maanden. ‘Ik kijk heel erg negatief terug op dat deel van mijn verleden. Dat anti-rechtsstatelijke, het gedogen van geweld. Ik ben er niet trots op.’ Als onderzoeker kwam de ervaring hem later wel van pas. ‘Tijdens interviews met rechts-extremisten werkt het geruststellend als ik vertel dat ik zelf een vergelijkbaar proces van radicalisering en deradicalisering heb meegemaakt.’

Na Kedichem verstomde het protest, onder meer omdat extreemrechtse partijen bij de Tweede Kamerverkiezingen van 1986 geen zetels haalden. Het antifascistische vuur laaide pas in de jaren negentig weer op, toen de CD begon te stijgen in de peilingen. ‘Ook waren er in Duitsland enkele extreemrechtse geweldsuitbarstingen, waarbij migranten waren omgekomen’, zegt Wagenaar. ‘Er werd gedacht dat zoiets ook in Nederland kon plaatsvinden.’

In die periode ontstond ook behoefte aan een zekere vorm van organisatie. Tot dan toe hadden lokale groepen vrij autonoom geopereerd: ze leefden van actie naar actie. Dat veranderde in 1992 met de oprichting van een samenwerkingsverband: Anti-Fascistische Aktie (AFA).

Het idee van deze organisatie, die geen bestuur en geen leden kende, was om rechts-extremisme te bestrijden met goed georganiseerde acties die niet uit de hand mochten lopen, aldus onderzoeker De Vetten, ‘want dan zouden de mensen afknappen op apolitiek machogedrag’. Dit betekende overigens niet dat AFA per se tegen geweld was: het was ‘soms noodzakelijk bij de verdediging tegen extreemrechts’.

Vaak gebeurt dat de laatste tijd niet. ‘Links-extremisten zetten doorgaans geen gewelddadige middelen in ter ondersteuning van hun acties’, schreef de Nationaal Coördinator Terrorismebestrijding en Veiligheid onlangs in het jaarlijkse [*Dreigingsbeeld*](https://www.nctv.nl/documenten/2025/12/09/dtn-december-2025)*.* De dienst concludeerde ook dat linkse activisten in omringende landen ‘sneller geneigd zijn om geweld te gebruiken dan hier’.

Het laatste in het oog springende incident stamt uit 2023. Toen werd Thierry Baudet in een Gronings café met een bierfles geslagen. De FvD-leider hield daar een hoofdwond aan over. Volgens een antifascistische actiegroep uit het Noorden hoorde de 15-jarige dader tot hun beweging.

**Bewust versplinterd**

‘Huh, wat?’ De antifascisten in Amersfoort kijken een beetje geërgerd als ze in het heetst van de strijd allerlei vragen krijgen voorgelegd. ‘Wat wij doen? Wat denk je?’, zegt een jonge vrouw, haar ‘actienaam’ is Les. ‘Wij komen hier om de fascisten te laten zien dat de straten niet van hen zijn.’

Over de organisatie van de beweging wil Les niets zeggen. ‘Ik weet niet hoe er wordt bepaald welke acties we doen. En als ik het wel zou weten, zou ik het je niet vertellen.’

Dat is een terugkerende formulering. Antifascisten vormen met opzet een vage, versplinterde beweging. ‘Ik ben geen lid van antifa’, zegt een jongen met roze haar die zichzelf ‘Wolfje’ noemt. ‘Dat kan namelijk niet.’

Ze willen allebei anoniem blijven, vooral om niet in het vizier te komen van rechts-extremisten óf de autoriteiten. Niemand geeft een volledige naam, sommigen willen niet eens dat hun stem wordt opgenomen. Hun filosofie daarentegen is helder. ‘Fascisme is als onkruid’, zegt Werner, een jongeman met een zwarte bivakmuts. ‘Je moet het voortdurend bestrijden, anders blijft het groeien.’

**Wandelclub030**

De meesten hier zijn afgekomen op een oproep van Wandelclub030, een antifascistische groep uit Utrecht die op Instagram ruim 2.300 volgers heeft. ‘Laten we duidelijk maken dat er in Amersfoort geen plek is voor racisme, haat en onverdraagzaamheid’, schreef de groep. Die oproep werd weer gedeeld door extreemrechtse Defend-accounts. Het is de bekende dynamiek van verhitting op sociale media: actie, reactie, en zo door.

‘Ik zit sinds kort in de punkscene’, zegt de 17-jarige Mark. ‘Ik lees veel over tolerantie en gelijkheid. Dan kom je vanzelf uit bij Wandelclub030.’

Om de antifa-motie, die ook gesteund werd door de VVD, moeten ze hier lachen: het is broddelwerk, vinden ze. Voor sommigen was het zelfs een reden om vanavond te komen. ‘Ik ben ook wel antifa, geloof ik’, zegt een oudere, keurige vrouw die met een groepje buurtbewoners op een kleine afstand van het tumult staat. ‘Zie ik eruit als een terrorist?’

‘De motie is voor gematigd rechts een dankbare afleiding van de werkelijke dreiging: vreemdelingenhaat en racistische drek’, zegt Werner. Er scheert een halve liter pils over hem heen. ‘Zag je dat? Het geweld komt nooit vanuit ons.’ Hij voegt zich bij de groep en roept de oorspronkelijke leus die in de jaren twintig in reactie op het regime van Mussolini is ontstaan: ‘Siamo tutti antifascisti!’ Wij zijn allemaal antifascisten.

**Mokum tegen fascisme**

Hoe staat het antifascisme ervoor in Nederland? In een Amsterdams café vertellen twee vrouwen over de acties van nu. Ze kennen elkaar van Mokum tegen fascisme, een Amsterdamse groep die demonstraties organiseert en alternatieve herdenkingen, bijvoorbeeld van de Februaristaking. Officiële woordvoerders zijn ze niet, benadrukken ze. Die bestaan niet.

De 39-jarige Sanne, kind van communisten, kon twintig jaar geleden als student geen huis in Amsterdam vinden. Ze besloot te gaan kraken, kwam in aanraking met activisten en besloot mee te doen met hun acties. ‘Zo rol je er een beetje in.’ Ook Sanne wil niet met haar achternaam in de krant.

Michelle, niet haar echte naam, is pas een paar jaar actief bij Mokum tegen fascisme. Ze is 68 jaar oud en doet mee om het tij te keren. ‘Ik wil niet dat mijn kleinkinderen straks in een fascistisch land leven.’

Mokum tegen fascisme (bijna drieduizend [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/mokumtegenfascisme/?hl=en)volgers) ontstond in coronatijd, zegt Sanne. Bij de protesten tegen het overheidsbeleid, waar antifascisten het ook niet per se mee eens waren, zagen ze niet alleen types als Willem Engel opduiken, maar ook mensen van rechts-extremistische clubs als Voorpost, de NVU en de Geuzenbond.

‘Meestal gaan die gasten op een gegeven moment wel met elkaar op de vuist’, zegt Sanne. ‘Maar nu niet. Ze gingen juist steeds meer samenwerken, we zagen extreemrechts nieuwe mensen rekruteren.’

**Weerwoord**

Er moest een weerwoord komen. En zo ontstond het plan voor Mokum tegen fascisme, een brede tegenbeweging voor iedereen die zich zorgen maakt over oprukkende vreemdelingenhaat, met ‘niet alleen enge mensen in het zwart’, zo zegt Sanne lachend. Een beweging die de verschillende antifascistische groeperingen bij elkaar brengt.

Bij de oprichtingsbijeenkomst waren mensen aanwezig die ook betrokken zijn bij organisaties als Bij1 en Extinction Rebellion, en bij groepen radicale antifascisten. Andere linkse partijen als GroenLinks en PvdA waren wel uitgenodigd, maar kwamen niet. ‘Dat is een groot probleem’, zegt Sanne, die graag zou willen dat gematigd links hun strijd ook openlijk zou steunen. ‘Individuele leden van die partijen komen soms wel.’

De meningsverschillen binnen de antifascistische scene draaien vooral om de vraag ‘wat goed antifascisme is’, zegt ze. Plus: hoever mag je gaan? Zo hield een brede groep antifascisten onlangs in Houten een tegendemonstratie bij een azc-protest.

Sanne: ‘Ze stonden tegenover een stuk of honderd van die Defend-gasten, die met vuurwerk gooiden. Een van de antifascisten gooide dat vuurwerk toen terug, waarna hij van achteren een klap met een vlaggenstok kreeg. Iemand vond dat hij te agressief was tegenover de fascisten. Daar wringt het dus heel erg.’ Michelle: ‘Als je een breed protest wil, is het beter als dat soort dingen niet gebeuren.’

**Breed protest**

Zo’n breed protest was er onlangs wel. In oktober, toen rechts-extremisten hadden aangekondigd door Amsterdam te willen marcheren, kwamen zo’n zeventig man van verschillende groepen tijdens een actievergadering bijeen om plannen te maken voor een eigen actie. Er werd een grote noodzaak gevoeld om krachtig te reageren, op de terrorismemotie én het anti-immigratieprotest.

‘De radicale aanwezigen wilden de demonstratie blokken, anderen voelden daar weinig voor’, zegt Sanne. ‘Maar over één ding waren we het eens: we moesten op een zichtbare plek met zo veel mogelijk mensen samenkomen om ons uit te spreken en te laten zien dat we allemaal ‘antifa’ zijn.’

En zo ging het. Terwijl de rechts-extremisten met prinsenvlaggen door Amsterdam marcheerden, stonden honderden tegendemonstranten op het Jonas Daniël Meijerplein, waar ze onder meer door Sanne werden toegesproken. Er kwamen radicale actievoerders op af, maar ook ‘zestigers met windjacks en dertigers met coffees to go’, zoals *de Volkskrant* destijds [schreef](https://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/amsterdam-op-scherp-tijdens-dag-van-protesten-hier-kan-ik-jullie-veiligheid-niet-garanderen~bfc2ece1e/).

**Een streep trekken**

Een confrontatie tussen de groepen bleef uit. ‘Eigenlijk wilden we die wel’, zegt Sanne. ‘Niet om te vechten, maar om een streep te trekken. Zo van: jullie gaan niet door onze stad marcheren.’

Hoe kijken ze aan tegen het gebruik van geweld? ‘Er is een grens’, zegt Sanne. ‘Maar waar die precies ligt, weet ik niet. Het hangt er ook vanaf hoe intens het geweld van de andere kant is. Ik ben meermaals bedreigd vanuit extreemrechtse hoek: het gaat altijd over verkrachting en daarna over moord. Er zijn in het verleden vrienden van me thuis opgezocht. Als die in reactie daarop dan een mep uitdelen, snap ik dat helemaal.’ Michelle: ‘Zelfverdediging moet mogelijk zijn.’

Sanne: ‘Het organiseren en rekruteren van extreemrechts moet worden voorkomen, op welke manier dan ook. En daarbij mag je heel ver gaan. Zelf zou ik niet gauw mensen thuis opzoeken, omdat er soms ook kinderen in huis zijn. Maar ik ga anderen die dit wel doen niet veroordelen.’

Op het plein in Amersfoort loopt een azc-tegenstander, een man met een rossig baardje en een blauwe pet, naar het antifascistische vak. Hij probeert een AFA-vlag uit de handen van een activist te grijpen. Een andere antifascist, volledig in het zwart, schiet te hulp. Meerdere omstanders filmen de schermutseling.

‘Ja, ik ben wel gewend om in te grijpen’, zegt de man in het zwart achteraf. Hij wil zijn naam niet geven. Hij draagt een hoog opgeritst zwart windjack met hoodie en een bivakmuts. Ook hij herhaalt een hier vaak gehoord mantra: hij komt niet om te matten, maar als het moet, is hij weerbaar.

Bij veel antifascistische protesten duikt een ‘Black Bloc’ op, een groep in het zwart geklede activisten die net wat meer geharnast in de strijd staan dan anderen. Omdat het in het verleden weleens tot gewelddadige clashes is gekomen, wordt dit zwarte blok door rechts als bewijs aangevoerd dat ‘antifa’ uit terroristen bestaat.

De activist wijst erop dat de agressie vandaag van ‘de nazi’s’ komt. ‘Ze gooien eieren, blikken bier en vuurwerk, en komen de hele tijd uit hun vak naar ons toe’, zegt hij. ‘En de politie doet er niets aan.’

**Beroepsnazi’s**

Hij vertelt dat hij niet alleen is gekomen om te demonstreren en zo nodig zijn kameraden te beschermen, maar ook om een blik op de azc-tegenstanders te werpen. ‘Je ziet momenteel dat er een groepje beroepsnazi’s en types uit de hooliganwereld van azc-protest naar azc-protest trekt. Dit zijn echt geen bezorgde burgers uit de buurt.’

Hij wijst naar een man met lang blond haar en een ‘Fuck Antifa’-trui, die hij bij naam kent. Het is een bekende neonazi die geregeld wordt gezien met een SS-teken op zijn kleding. Rond 2018 was hij betrokken bij de actiegroep Stop Antifa Terreur, nu begeeft hij zich in Defend-groepen. ‘Het is voor ons heel belangrijk om precies te weten wie wie is in extreemrechtse kringen.’

Onderzoek is een belangrijk onderdeel van de antifascistische strijd. Al in de jaren tachtig hield het Fascisme Onderzoek Kollektief (FOK) zogeheten FOK-dossiers bij met de ontwikkelingen binnen extreemrechts. Ter linkerzijde zijn er meerdere van dit soort onderzoeksgroepen: zoals Buro Jansen & Janssen, dat onderzoek doet naar politie en inlichtingendiensten, en Kafka, dat eind jaren tachtig is ontstaan als afsplitsing van FOK.

‘We proberen de netwerken van extreemrechts in kaart te brengen’, zegt Remco, die een actieve rol heeft binnen Kafka en wegens zijn werk alleen met zijn actienaam in de krant wil. ‘We kijken bijvoorbeeld naar de verbanden tussen politieke partijen en extreemrechtse clubs. En we volgen nu de Defendgroepen, kijken mee in hun appgroepen. We zijn daarbij vooral geïnteresseerd in mensen die een leidende rol op zich nemen. Anderen laten we in principe met rust en noemen we niet bij naam. Het doel? Je kunt rechts-extremisten alleen tegengaan als je weet wie ze zijn en waar ze opduiken.’

In sommige gevallen leidt het ontmaskeren van rechts-extremisten tot doxing: het online delen van persoonsgegevens om iemand te intimideren, wat sinds 2024 strafbaar is. Zo onthulde Wandelclub030 begin november op Instagram wie figuren zijn binnen de Defend-beweging en in de extreemrechtse Nederlandse Nationalistische Beweging (NNB). Foto’s, volledige namen, adresgegevens en KvK-gegevens werden gedeeld.

Niet iedereen in de beweging was daar blij mee, zegt Remco. ‘Het is strafbaar, maar het is ook gewoon niet handig. Soms werkt het juist averechts.’

**Marginale figuren**

Vrijwilligers van Kafka doen osint-onderzoek (open source intelligence), beantwoorden vragen van de pers, fotograferen deelnemers aan extreemrechtse demonstraties en gaan naar rechtszaken tegen extreemrechtse verdachten. Slechts een klein deel van het onderzoek verschijnt op hun website, de rest is voor hun eigen archief. De organisatie ontvangt geen subsidie en kan alleen voortbestaan door donaties.

Vlak voor het interview heeft Remco een pro-formazitting bezocht bij de extra beveiligde rechtbank Rotterdam in de zaak tegen Thomas D. van de extreemrechtse jongerenclub Geuzenbond. Daar werd onder meer bekend dat de inlichtingendienst D. in de gaten hield en hem hoorde zeggen: ‘Als antifa voor mijn deur zou staan, dan steek ik ze neer.’

Jarenlang volgde Kafka vooral marginale, soms treurige figuren uit de nazihoek. Maar de afgelopen tijd ziet Remco dat er een normalisering is ingezet. ‘De sociale straf om extreemrechts te zijn is verdwenen, waardoor de gevolgen veel minder groot zijn als je wordt ontmaskerd. Mensen komen steeds openlijker voor hun denkbeelden uit.’

Heeft dat gevolgen voor hun werkwijze? ‘Vroeger moest je in de bosjes liggen om foto’s te maken. Nu kun je gewoon een livestream van een neonazi aanzetten en screenshots maken. Maar we moeten wel selectiever zijn. Heeft het zin om alle kandidaten van de PVV door te lichten op zoek naar een extreemrechts verleden? We kiezen nu vooral voor onderzoek dat niet door reguliere media wordt gedaan.’

**Confrontatie**

Op het plein in Amersfoort scanderen de voor- en tegenstanders urenlang leuzen naar elkaar. ‘Asielzoekers welkom, nazi’s niet!’, schreeuwen de antifascisten. ‘Azc, weg ermee!’, roept het kamp dat met prinsenvlaggen met VOC-wapen wappert. De politie blijft de hele tijd tussen de groepen in staan.

Iets na 8 uur vinden de antifascisten het mooi geweest. Een groot deel van hen verlaat het plein en loopt richting het station. Een groep azc-tegenstanders zet de achtervolging in. Agenten met wapenstok vormen een linie om ze tegen te houden. De politie houdt zes demonstranten aan, ogenschijnlijk allemaal azc-tegenstanders.

‘Het patroon is nu wel duidelijk, toch?’, zegt een antifascist. ‘Zelfs als we weglopen, zoeken ze nog de confrontatie met ons.’

Every micropet felt inspired, thoughtfully designed, and full of personality, which naturally led me to reflect on each adorable companion we met along the way!! So here is my thoughts:

Lumi the Jelly is my all-time favorite micropet! I have always been fascinated by life underwater, and my lil' jellyfish has the cutest animation ever!!

As a mythology enthusiast, Zephyrus the Pegasus easily takes second place for me!! That month was full of hidden gems, and he truly stood out!

Flora the Flutterfly arrived like a gentle breeze! Watching her float around, and especially when she transformed into the most beautiful colors after becoming an adult, was absolutely magical!

Raven the Cat was just the most excellent host! I loved being invited to her haunted mansion! And honestly, have y'all seen those adorable big green eyes?!

Our literal nutcracker herself, Clara the Chipmunk, ended the year with such elegance. I can't wait to see her other skins~~

I had been hop-ing for a rabbit micropet all year, and Carrot the Bunny arrived just in time~~

Cheeky the Hamster, also, came with such an amazing theme and quickly became my partner in crime!

Australia has my heart, and Steve the Koala is simply adorable! He is literally in every other furniture I use! And I used them a lot!

Crumbs the Raccoon and I occasionally bond over coffee breaks together sometimes~~

I also loved the concept behind Caramel the Caribou, such a great idea.

While I do enjoy Sketch the Pawrtist, I feel we have had quite a few dog micropets over the years, and there were many opportunities to explore something different.

I have wanted a monkey micropet for ages! My only issue with Martin the Monkey is his hotel suit making him feel awfully too specific!!

Looking ahead to 2026, I do hope we continue to explore even more unique ideas! I woud love to see pets from the depths of the ocean, the far reaches of outer space, and especially more fantasy-inspired companions! 
So, no matter what future holds, thank you to the Finch team for making this year sooo memorable!! I can’t wait to see what the team has in store for us!",8,1766842414.0,finch,1,0.9,False

Winter does this thing                                             where time slows down just enough                           for people to notice each other again.

December is strange that way.                                         It makes the brave nostalgic                                        and the guarded a little reckless.                           People start smiling at reflections,                       replying faster than they planned to.

The New Year arrives quietly,                          pretending it’s about resolutions,                            when really it is just asking,                                          who you would like to sit next to                               when the fireworks fade.

Winter flirts without trying.                                        Fog on windows.                                                    Breath hanging mid sentence.                                    That moment when laughter fogs the air,               before it finds a reason.

Affection doesn’t knock loudly this season.                   It leans in.It says,                                                        “Stay a little longer.”                                                         It pours another cup.It waits.

And somewhere between                                           cold hands and warm conversations,                  between last year’s lessons.                                       and next year’s maybes,                                  something soft settles in.

Not love.Not promises.                                              Just that quiet hope,                                                  that maybe this year.                                                    you won’t rush home so fast.

Winter understands this.                                                  It never hurries you.                                                          It just wraps you gently,                                              and lets the right moment find you.

If winter is asking me to stay, I won’t argue specially if the empty chair across the table turns out to be yours….",2,1766842246.0,selflove,1,1.0,False

Why not just wait until I get there and we can order together?,"Want to preface by saying we’ve known each other for 20+ years so this is NOT just a first date. We’re 30.

I’m trying to figure out if I’m being overly sensitive or if this would bother other people too.

The guy asked me out and we met at Starbucks. Right off the bat, he did this thing that already annoys me. He kept asking which Starbucks to go to, multiple times, even though we have been to the exact same one together before (in our childhood town).

He got there ONE minute before me (i was not late) and told me he already ordered his coffee on the Starbucks app. When I arrived, I got in line. He then tried to sound gentlemanly and said, “Oh, I can order for you on the app!” I said it was fine and stayed in line. At that point, he didn’t wait with me or stand nearby. He just went and sat down at a table.

After I ordered, I joined him. A few minutes later, his drink was ready. He got up, went to the pickup counter, grabbed his coffee, and came back. My drink was either already there or came out shortly after. He didn’t even glance at the counter to see if mine was ready, let alone try to grab it. I ended up getting it myself.

I know this sounds small, but it rubbed me the wrong way. If roles were reversed, I would have picked up both drinks without thinking, especially on a date. It wasn’t about buying me coffee. It was more about awareness and basic courtesy. Also he could’ve just waited until I got to the Starbucks so we could order together - why did he have to order on the app and only order his drink?

Just ordered a rancilio Silvia pro X last night and now it’s time to order a grinder!!!! I was dead set on a single dose grinder and then I came across the Eureka Mignon Libra…… 

This is my first ever set up, 0 experience! We drink milk based drinks about 95% of the time. I know some grinders are for espresso AND pour over, I only really care about a good espresso grinder (for now). The next big thing… I don’t know what’s my favorite type of coffee, light, medium or dark roast. Every coffee shop I’ve been to has been a variety of those 3 roasts and it’s all good lol. I can see myself running through a bag and then switching to something else and so on, but since I’m just starting I’ll be using a bag to try and get good shots, then switching to something else and exploring to see what I like most? 

Niche zero is out of the picture because they charge a 25% tariff fee to the US, bringing it closer to $900, which I heard is a great machine for $700, idk about $900

 Options:
- order the eureka mignon libra
•	⁠buy a used mazzer philos for $1000 (9 months old and used daily)
•	⁠Timemore 078s
•	⁠eureka oro mignon single dose pro
•	⁠another grinder under $1k you recommend 

I plan on hosting small get togethers to make coffee for maybe 5-10 people about 4 times a year to get feedback on my coffee. (My partner wants to open a small coffee shop one day, so we’re practicing now!)

1pwxsht,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pwxsht/aitah_for_ruining_my_best_friends_life/,AITAH For RUINING My Best Friends Life?,"I (22F) and my ex best friend (20F), who I’ll call *Jamie*, were friends for about three years.

I met Jamie through someone I was close with at the time, Mya (22F). From the very beginning, I didn’t like Jamie. Something about her just rubbed at me in the wrong way.

It honestly felt like a competition over who got to hang out with Mya. Anytime I talked to Mya in public or interacted with her at work, I could *feel* Jamie staring at us. Like full-on eyes-burning-into-the-back-of-my-head energy.

After a while, I started matching her energy. If I caught her staring, I’d make direct eye contact and give her a dirty look. I know now that probably wasn’t the most mature response, but in the moment, it felt justified.

Eventually though, things started to calm down. Jamie stopped with the side glances, and I finally felt some relief. 

Then came Mya’s annual vacation. Every year, she goes on a cruise for about two weeks.

I wasn’t looking forward to it at all. The thought of being stuck at work alone with Jamie honestly sent a shiver down my spine. Still, I told myself I could handle it.

Once Mya left, I started noticing things I hadn’t before—like the fact that Jamie and I took the same city bus to work. Somehow, I’d never realized it until then.

That morning, I sat down on the bus and waited, trying to stay calm. I don’t even know how it happened, but somehow I ended up sitting right next to Jamie.

She started making conversation, and I noticed we had the same interests.

Over the next two weeks, Jamie and I grew closer. We learned more about each other and even exchanged phone numbers.  
I genuinely started to love hanging out with her and found myself looking forward to every interaction.

A few months into our friendship, I began to notice a change. Jamie started becoming extremely aggressive.

Personally, I think some roughhousing with friends is normal—play fighting and joking around. But Jamie took it a little too far. She would sneak up behind me and jump on me, causing me to fall over more than once. I even spilled my extremely expensive work coffee on my work suits multiple times because of it.

Along with that, she would constantly hit me. - Like punch. 

I never made that mutual because I was concerned about harming her due to me being two years older and much fitter. 

After a while, I started noticing bruises on my body, and that’s when it really hit me—whatever this was, it had to stop.

I still cared about Jamie and genuinely wanted to keep hanging out with her; I just needed the physical stuff to end.

So during lunch one day, I sat her down and tried to talk to her honestly. She listened, but something about it bothered me the entire time: she wouldn’t make eye contact with me. Not. even. once.

Still, because I was blinded at the time by what I thought was a “wonderful” friendship, I kept hanging out with her.  
As time went on, we started forming a friend group. Depending on the day, there were usually around five to ten of us.

The core group, though, was five people: me, Jamie, Destiny (20F), Marcus (21M), and Margo (21F).

(You don’t need to remember all the names.)

I was the oldest in the group, but at the time, I didn’t think that would matter. I was wrong.

The rest of the group had personalities similar to Jamie’s—extremely energetic, sometimes over the top, and seemingly never sleet.  Even so, I cared deeply about every one of them.

As time went on, Jamie’s behavior only got worse. Our fights and arguments became far too frequent, and I could feel our friendship slowly fading. In an attempt to fix things—to heal what felt like an open wound—I invited the entire group to a convention.

I loved—and still love—this convention. I go every year and always have an amazing time, no matter who I go with, so I genuinely thought bringing the friend group would be a great idea.

When the day of the convention arrived, it started off perfectly. The whole group met up and immediately started talking and walking around together. As the day went on, though, I started to feel a bit annoyed. Jamie decided she was going to “lead” the group everywhere we went. Keep in mind, I know the layout of this convention like the back of my hand, while this was Jamie’s very first time.

I tried to remind her that she didn’t actually know where she was going, but all I got in response was a scoff and an eye roll. Throughout the day, the group ended up getting separated three different times—each time because Jamie wanted to stop and buy random things, then guilt-tripped someone into paying for her by claiming she “didn’t bring enough cash.”

This really upset me, and I ended up leaving early.

A few weeks later, Jamie’s attitude still hadn’t improved. She constantly complained about me being busy with volleyball, work, or family obligations instead of spending time with her. I always tried to accommodate her and make time, even when she would be “too tired” to even lift a finger for me. The thought of her ruining the convention really upset me. So I decided to talk to her about it. 

When I finally talked to her, I laid everything out—how the convention went, how disrespected and disappointed I felt, and all the concerns I had been holding in. But with every point I made, she had an excuse. She twisted my words until somehow, she was the victim.

Hearing the irritation in her voice, excuse after excuse, slowly shattered my heart. That’s when it really sank in: my best friend of almost three years was never the person I hoped she was.

That’s when I finally said, “Forget it,” and walked away.

I went straight to Destiny, Marcus, and Margo, and I couldn’t hold it together anymore. I broke down. I sobbed. Jamie had become part of my family—at least, a family I created in my head. One I desperately wanted to be real.

I explained everything to the rest of the group: how I had tried talking to her about her behaviour, how she treated me, all of it. They listened. They supported my decision to take space. Some of them even admitted that Jamie had treated them similarly—just not to the same extent.

A few months passed and I noticed Destiny being a little distant, then I remembered something. Out of everyone in the group - other than me, she was the closest to Jamie.

I talked to Destiny and asked if I had done something wrong. She panicked and quickly put down the thought. Although, she told me something.. Jamie has been speaking poorly about me to other colleagues and friends. Accusing me of ruining her life and taking her friends away from her. I obviously told Destiny that that wasn't true. - I wasn't! 

I never ""took"" anyone from her, I just opened their eyes. 

Too this day, I still get side glances and the occasional person ask me why I would ""ruin"" her life.

I was overweight which he said he didn't mind. I had anxiety and wore a mask/hoodie to cope with it. He said he was the last person to judge me over it. I lost weight before we met and wasn't that oveweight. He rejected me after we met. He avoided PDA and said he disliked it. He did things that made me think he was embarrassed of me. I went to the UK with him where he continued to act the same way for over a year. He broke down and told me he had OCD about not finding me attractive, claiming he felt bad about it. 

He started medication he said killed his libido. It was after I changed, lost more weight, that he showed more interest whilst still on the meds. He said if I looked the way I did at the start, he would've been all over me. He did PDA and other things, like going out to eat, that he wouldn't do before. I believed he was lying about his libido being as low as it was for several reasons. I also started to suspect he was cheating around this time. I eventually regained some weight back, and he stopped showing as much interest, blaming it on meds. He said it had nothing to do with my weight and never did. 

I reached the weight I was when we met in person and he told me I let myself go. He continued to insult me the more weight I gained. He said he didn't mean it and only said it to hurt me, that I said similar to him over his weight, weight he gained shortly after we met and was still gaining. He started behaving similarly in public as before. He avoided his friends ever since I first came to the UK. One of them worked at a coffee shop in a shopping centre in town, and we'd occasionally run into him. The last time we did, and sat to have a drink, he was on edge. 

He said he needed the bathroom. He pushed me to leave and no longer needed the bathroom after we did. He started acting on edge elsewhere, like in grocery stores. He stood apart from me, spoke to me less, and walked off when I was speaking. He criticized my request that he stood closer, asking if he was supposed to be glued to my hip. I noticed him looking over his shoulder when he was next to me. I initially thought he was embarrassed of me again. I caught him giving me a judgemental look when I scoffed over cheesecake I found that I was looking for. 

He said it wasn't aimed at me but the situation, two overweight people scoffing at cheesecake, and the worry it would draw attention. Shortly after this he went into the local tesco and came out in a hurry. He said he almost ran into an old female classmate. He refused to go into any store the day after that. He said he was bloated and promised to resume going in when he wasn't. He told me days later he wasn't bloated but refused to go in. He said two male employees in tesco stared at him, and made him uncomfortable. He never mentioned them before. 

For a month he wouldn't go in anywhere. When questioned he became angry, and said he didn't have to go in if he didn't want to. When he finally did go in, it was mostly to asda, and he acted on edge in there. He said the male employees in there stared at him. He went silent on me around people, something he did before I gained weight, claiming to dislike talking in front of people. When he could talk to others in front of people just not me. He seemed more on edge around women, and it was the same in the begining. When it sounded like a female employee was heading our way he quickly walked off. 

He was on edge even when no one was around. We went into tesco sometimes and he'd rush me out of the store, not wanting me to stand around. He went silent and walked off from me around female employees. He appeared to hide his face walking past one of them. He didn't want me smiling back at him either, looking to see if a female employee noticed. He said we went in too often, and too late, and it made him more anxious. We went in less and he was still anxious. I tried to go in during the day and he said it was too busy. But he went in just fine alone when asked. 

He went into stores he refused to go in with me like the small shop in the village, which he said was too busy when it wasn't. He went in during the busiest times of day. He avoided everywhere in the town, apart from the grocery stores. He went out of his way to drive elsewhere, even when he was tired. He'd go as late as possible or would promise to go and wouldn't. It got to a point that I was only getting out, and going places, when I went with him to his class or volunteering where I sat in the car. Something he invited me to do. 

Both places are in other towns. We went early, at first, but then he started going late and leaving no time to go anywhere. He stopped wanting to go in places. He needed an itinerary and advanced notice to be able to. At times, he didn't want me coming with him. He told me fellow volunteers invited me inside but discourged me when I tried to go in both times. He also discourged me going other places, such as boots in the town, when he went to places alone in the same street. He called my anxiety into question both times. 

I started wearing my mask again. He didn't want me at the mechanics with him when I had it on. He said other people judged me over it when I said people were looking. He said it would ease his anxiety if I took it off. He criticized how I was dressed a few times. He refused to go into the grocery store with me once and said I didn't look properly dressed. I had a baggy hoodie on. He previously told me bigger people don't look good in baggy things. We went to America and he criticized outfits I wore there, after telling me they looked good

We went to America last Christmas and he hardly went in with me. He didn't want to go out to eat, though he promised he would.  He swore when we came back things would be different, that we'd go more places. We'd go to the city once a week and do other things. We came back and he right away didn't want to go into the grocery store for weeks. We didn't go to the city until months later, and we didn't go in anywhere. It was my birthday and he sat browsing things to buy on his phone. The other times we were going, he tried to talk me into going to the beach or a park. 

He said there were loads of people at those places so he couldn't be embarrassed of me. When we went to the city one of the times he asked if I wanted to go on a walk on the outskirts of it. I said no and he went anyways, lying that I had agreed. I stopped going into the grocery stores feeling judged by him and more anxious because of that. He was still judge as on edge in the car. He didn't want to sit around carparks and rushed to leave. He didn't want me touching his face in the tesco carpark worried someone would look. 

He didn't want to do click and collects when we used to. He didn't want to do it at Tesco specifically, claiming he was worried he'd run into family. We went to the park in town to feed the ducks, which he seemed on edge at, though we didn't get out of the car usually. When he did get out he walked ahead of me to the bench. He'd offer to go to other, more secluded parks. I started going into stores again and he stopped going to the park as much, when we went several times a week before. 

He had to reapply for his benefits of the summer, and was worried about that. He said he had OCD about not being anxious enough to deserve them. That he had to stop going places until it was over. He promised to go more places after it was finished and he didn't. It was back to going with him to his class, to his volunteering, the latter of which he was rarely doing for months. He went late, leaving little to no time to go anywhere beforehand, whilst promising to go early each time so we could. For months he promsied to go to the city and didn't. 

He balmed us not going places on money. When what I asked to do, like feed the ducks, or walk around the town didn't really require much or any money. He was most keen to go on a walk or go to the cinema, even when we didn't have the money for it. He said there wasn't much else to do. I started to doubt he has anxiety more than ever. He volunteers for a hotline and is studying to become a counselor. He roleplays with people and talks to them. He engages in and starts conversations with people. He makes friends. 

That is exactly why he thought if the dwp knew these things they'd doubt his anxiety, the reason for his benefits. He says he has anxiety in crowds, not one on one. For months now he's promised to do things to prove he's not embarrassed of me like going into the shopping centre, then not doing it. He hasn't gone to feed the ducks but a few times, making me wait or not going other times. He was going into the grocery store and seemed fine up until a month and a half ago, when he said he was anxious again. When he started going in a few other places with me. 

That was to the new home bargains and range which are right beside each other. We went there late afternoon. He didn't want to go early. He was insisting on going late to the grocery stores, as well, though he'd complained about it before. He told me 10pm wasn't late, and that he wasn't hiding me because it was still light outside. He said we'd go more places during the holiday break he has. We haven't. He said he'd go to Dublin and kept putting it off because of money. After I pushed he went to the town late in the day, and went to a few stores. 

These were stores I hadn't been to in years. He was on edge in one saying people are more nosey in the town opposed to elsewhere. We went to a few places a few days in a row, one day doing so before his volunteering. He started telling me people were inviting me in again. For weeks now he's promised to do more but has a bunch of reasons why we aren't. Money, his sleeping pattern which is staying up all night, and sleeping into the day. Something he's done for years on and off and acts like he can't change, like he can't set alarms and wake up to them. 

Just like with his anxiety, he's been able to fix his sleep when he needs to, or at least get up and do what he has to do on little sleep. Both things he won't do for me. He sleeps into the day, or all of it, apart from the days he has to get up for his class or volunteering or something/someone else. For weeks now he's been promising things frequently. He said he'd take responsibility for his sleep and wake up on little sleep if he goes to bed late. That he wouldn't be angry over it or blame me as he has. He said the same thing on Christmas. He's promised to go places. 

He said he'd go to the shopping centre days ago. He found out, after running into his friend, that he no longer works at the coffee shop there. He promised me yesterday we'd go to the city soon. Now today he was going to bed late and said he'd set alarms, and get up on little sleep. Then he said he was going to stay up which never goes well. He usually falls asleep midday or sleeps a long time. He said if he went to bed at the time it was that he'd stay up all night again. I asked if he'd go anywhere since to help with staying up. 

We used to go places the days we'd stay up. He has refused for years to. He said he'd go to a town 30mins away and we could get a coffee at a drive thru. When I asked if he'd go to the town nearby, and into the shopping centre, he said he didn't want to walk around on no sleep. I said we could sit at the coffee shop and he said no. We got into an argument and he said he was tried and was going to sleep. He insisted he hasn't cheated and isn't hiding me. I said he's been lying to me for years now. He lied to me to get me to come back with him. 

He said, as he has said before, that it was my choice to come back. He didn't make me. He says I am abusing him for thinking he's cheated/is cheating as much as I do. I have  suspected he's cheated for years, before he started acting this way. He's done many other things that point to it since we've been back. He didn't wear his ring. He has shown more/less interest in sex in random bursts. He deleted an app off his phone that logs deleted messages, that has been on there for years,
that I installed and he didn't care about before. 

He promised me once back he'd do whatever it took to rebuild trust, including turning his location on 24/7. He's been detached and argumentive. He's hot and cold saying he wants me here and then he doesn't. He was nervous thinking I was trying to take a photo of him lying on my chest days ago. He argued with me for days recently. He was detached during that time. He went off to another room for hours as he's done before, usually started arguments to do so, or just randomly disappearing. 

He said something about his class condeming people posting their partners in those cheating groups. The ones where you ask if anyone recognizes them. He didn't want me posting him in those groups before thinking a family member or friend would see. ",0,1766841389.0,TwoHotTakes,29,0.42,False

A life that doesnt feel monotonous , dreadful and shit ofc . I could do the same boring task with more interest and energy which I initially despised 

The effect is similar to as if something has activated my brain circuit which snaps me out of executive paralysis . But the downside being Im on a time crunch and have to get  things done before the effect wears off . Also I  mostly drink one mug ( 80ml ) or rarely twice a day .

Is that supposed to be alright ? Ive always heard caffeine makes anxiety worse . From clinical perspective , Im on escilatopram (10mg,everynight) , Propanalol (10mg, SOS basis ) which makes me sleepy  but it's the best sleep I've had in years .",2,1766841369.0,Anxiety,1,1.0,False

1pwxji1,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pwxji1/my_experience_with_the_kingrinder_k7_as_a_k6_user/,"My experience with the Kingrinder K7, as a K6 user","I received the Kingrinder K7 I ordered from AliExpress for $130 a couple of weeks ago and wanted to share my thoughts. I’m coming from the Kingrinder K6, and I figured people would be curious whether the K7 is actually worth the upgrade.

**TLDR:** The K7 is significantly clearer than the K6, with only a small change in perceived body. By going finer, I’m able to add body when I want it. I wasn’t expecting the jump to be this noticeable.

**Design and Workflow**

The overall form factor is very similar, though the k7 is a bit larger and heavier by about 50 grams.. The magnetic bayonet catch cup is a nice quality of life upgrade. The K7 does require more force to grind, but that hasn’t bothered me given the familiar ergonomics and the marked improvement in cup quality.

I’ve been brewing with a Hario Switch at 205F, preheat the dripper with water from my Stagg while I grind the beans. I either use Coffee Chronicler’s hybrid recipe, or traditional pourover recipe.

**Dialing In** 

\- K7: 85 clicks for immersion, 85-90 for percolation. There’s a wider sweet spot here, and grind changes feel less dramatic.

\- K6: 85 clicks for immersion, 95 clicks for percolation.

The K7 separates flavors more cleanly without losing as much body as I had thought. It can go tea-like at the coarsest end of the range (110-120), but I usually go finer at 85. When pushed finer, it gains body without collapsing into muddiness, which is where I often hit a wall with the K6. 

**Taste Profile Comparison**

My experience with a few different coffees below:

Prodigal - Finca San Antonio (light washed anaerobic)

\- K6: Felt like my white whale for most of the bag. The roaster lists raisins and floral notes, but I just got a generic sweetness, and I only picked up florals occasionally. Often skewed towards bitter if I tried to increase agitation or up extraction.

\- K7: Immediate jump to raisin and floral notes, plus a citrus note I never found with the K6. I tried several grind sizes, and that citrus note showed up consistently. Very little bitterness until I went really fine (70s). 

Dak - Cardamom Bun (light-medium coferment)

\- K6: Distinct smoky note that reminds me of shisha, alongside the listed cardamom and cinnamon.

\- K7: Much less of the smoky note. The cup tastes sweeter, with a cleaner and more pronounced cardamom flavor.

Fritz Coffee - Gedeb Lalesa Ethiopian heirloom (medium roast, natural)

\- K7: Strawberry and cherry up front, with a really pleasant dark chocolate flavor that reminds me of cocoa nibs.

\- K6: Very muddy by comparison. Mostly generic chocolate, with little separation and quite a bit of bitterness. Marginally better than diner coffee.

**Final Thoughts**

Overall, I’m very happy with its performance. I’m hard pressed to think of a use case for the K6 in my rotation at this point. So far, I’ve preferred the K7 across every process and roast level I’ve tried. In terms of downsides, the K7 takes a bit more force to grind, but as I mentioned it’s worth it for me. I’ll probably sell the K6 to clear space if I can’t find a coffee that it suits better than the K7 over the next few months.

I haven’t used the ZP6, so I can’t compare directly, though I’ve seen posts about the ZP6 being clearer. My first grinder was a Timemore C2, which felt like a revelation coming from pre-ground. The K6 was a big step up from the C2, especially for clarity. The K7 feels like a similar jump again, both in clarity and ease of dialing in.",23,1766841195.0,pourover,1,0.96,False

1pwxgzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/fixingmypenis/comments/1pwxgzr/i_used_to_watch_alot_of_porn_on_saturdays/,I used to watch alot of porn on Saturdays,"Back when I was married before I realized this was a problem for me Saturdays was the WORST day of the week. 

My wife would go grocery shopping and I’d go to my office (in my house)  
  
It started so innocently, drinking my coffee, reading the news, relaxing because it’s Saturday.   
  
And without fail, that’s where I’d go.   
  
Even after she left because I couldn’t get my shit together, Saturday was always the day.   
  
When I finally broke down and got some help, it was over a series of Saturdays that I finally broke the curse.   
  
I went into one Saturday with a new mindset determined to get thru it. I hit that moment, I remembered what my coach said and … I watched porn.   
  
I felt like SUCH a failure. I was heartbroken and hated myself. So of course I watched it the rest of the weekend just to make sure I really hated myself come Monday morning.   
  
I went back to my coach and said I failed!   
  
She said, “No, you WON! And here’s why…..”  
  
It was about how I was more aware than I ever had been before, that was the win.   
  
When I saw that I had hope, I was like I can do this!   
  
And then I did, I went “right” when everything in me said GO LEFT GO LEFT!! (to porn)  
  
After that IT WAS OVER!   
  
The “I’m addicted” switch in my head was off.  
  
Now I’m sure I’ll hear that’s not how it works, it’s not that simple, you don’t just get to do that. It’s this way, or it’s that way (whatever predetermined script people have been trained to say) .  
  
But for me, it was over, that switch was off.   
  
I wasn’t “perfect” after that. I had a long long stretch of “perfection”. I wobbled, I started to and then stopped many times. I’d reach for it, look at it and then stop.  
  
I can’t tell you how many times I’d start to watch porn and then I’d just STOP. I’d realize what I’m doing and say, I don’t want to do this anymore and I’d shut it off and walk away. It wasn’t a struggle, I didn’t need to masturbate after, I just realized and said *I don’t want to be doing this anymore* and stopped.   
  
I even go to the point where I asked myself, is the switch back on? Am I “addicted” again but then I’d get my brain tuned up and be ok again.   
  
Eventually I figured out that sometimes I get depressed and stressed out so that’s when my brain wants it the most. I recognized the pattern and changed what I do when I feel that way.   
I got help to rewire my brain so stress isn’t as stressful, and I started to get help for depression too.   
  
I’ve done a lot of work since and now it’s not just that the addict switch is off, I’m throwing out the switch entirely. I’m blowing up that whole “I’m an addict” identity and becoming a new person.   
  
One that does not need porn to cope and is free to do WTF I want, free from guilt and shame and it is AMAZING!

Firstly, the habit of not drinking a tea or coffee has not been an issue. I love a hot beverage but substituting with caffeine free hot drinks has been fine for me.

The hard part has been the physical and mental change I experienced, that to be honest I had no idea was coming (I went cold turkey without really looking into the details).

I spend the first few days just consumed with feelings of dread. It felt like I had been electrocuted and was having surges of doom shoot through me. My mind was just blocked with deep thoughts of sadness and a feeling that ‘something is bad/wrong’. I also got physical impacts like shakes and palpitations. One time in the shower I was physically shaking the whole time. Ive also noticed thoughts of ‘nobody likes me’, ‘I have no friends’, ‘I will become lonely in old age’ and just general sad thoughts.

5 days out I have stopped shaking as much, but there still seems to feel like a physical and mental tension, like just a feeling that something bad is around the corner and waves on intrusive thoughts that make my head go tingly.

Is this something that others have experienced, and are these likely to occur when going cold turkey (I was consuming about 10 cups of black English breakfast tea a day).

Would love to hear any other experiences",2,1766840908.0,decaf,2,1.0,False

1pwxe4x,https://www.reddit.com/r/ycombinator/comments/1pwxe4x/trying_to_engineer_the_ideation_phase_sharing_8/,"trying to engineer the ""ideation"" phase. sharing 8 heuristics from our internal playbook.","former founder here (3 exits), now running a venture studio. i’ve been obsessed lately with trying to turn the ""magic"" of coming up with a startup idea into an actual engineering process.

we are currently compiling an internal wiki of about 100 ""rules"" for ideation to help our EIRs (entrepreneurs in residence) stop wasting time. i wanted to pressure-test a few of them with this community to see if they hold water or if i'm just breathing my own exhaust.

here are 8 of the non-obvious ones:

1. Record Reality, Don't Rely on Memory human memory is a filter that keeps compliments and discards awkward objections. we force founders to record every discovery call (even in-person ones) and transcribe them. when you read the raw text later, you find the ""gold"" lies in the hesitation or awkward pauses that your brain filtered out in real-time.

2. The ""Graveyard"" Interviews talking to potential customers is table stakes. talking to people who failed to solve this problem is the alpha. we require 5 calls with ex-employees of failed competitors or investors who passed on similar deals in the past. they know where the landmines are buried better than any customer.

3. Smoke Tests > Landing Pages landing pages are weak signals. everyone is ""interested"" until it's time to pay. we use low-code tools to build ""fake products"" that look functional. we measure clicks on specific buttons inside the app, not just email signups.

4. Promise-Market Fit (Before Product-Market Fit) before writing code, crystallize the promise into one sentence. if the prospect can't repeat the promise back to you in their own words after a 5-minute pitch, the value proposition is too weak. iterate on the promise before iterating on the product.

5. Wallet Voting ""i would pay for this"" = $0 revenue. ""here is my credit card"" = validation. we run campaigns with a visible price tag. even if we don't charge them yet (beta/waitlist), the act of clicking a ""Pay $29/mo"" button is the only honest data point.

6. AI Sentiment Analysis after 50 calls, you lose the forest for the trees. we feed raw transcripts into an LLM and ask it to map emotional spikes (anger, shame, frustration) rather than just summarizing features. pain is easier to monetize than ""nice to have.""

7. Artificial External Accountability solo ideation is a trap. you start believing your own lies. we force a bi-weekly demo day even if there is nothing to demo. the pressure of ""packaging"" your progress for an external observer forces objectivity.

8. Get Dressed sounds stupid, but ideation is chaotic. to counter the chaos, you need rigid physical structure. ""going to work"" (even if it's a coffee shop) creates a mental switch that ""working from the couch"" destroys.

we are still refining the full list. question for you guys: what is the one ""rule"" or mental model you use to validate ideas that most people ignore?",6,1766840740.0,ycombinator,1,1.0,False

Most AI advice sounds like “just use ChatGPT”, which is way too vague. What actually helps is having tiny, focused tools that do one job extremely well.

Here are 10 mini AI tools I use for real-life work and side projects – each takes 30–60 seconds to use and costs less than a coffee:

**1. AI-Powered Lead Generator**  
Give it your audience, offer and goal, and it suggests specific lead gen angles and assets (lead magnets, outreach angles, hooks) you can ship this week – not “in theory”, but concrete campaigns you can test.

**2. Buyer Journey Audit**  
Drop in your site and get an audit for awareness, consideration and decision stages. It tells you where you’re losing people and gives suggestions for extra pages, proof and CTAs.

**3. Value Positioning Analyzer**  
Paste your offer and a few competitor summaries. It highlights where you sound generic and suggests sharper, more differentiated positioning.

**4. Smart Job Application Assistant**  
Paste a job description and your CV. It helps you reframe your skills, write a tailored letter and align your LinkedIn profile in one workflow.

**5. LinkedIn Post Idea Generator**  
Tell it who you are and who you serve, and it outputs a list of angles and post ideas that actually fit your niche, not generic “hustle” quotes.

**6. Story & Reel Caption Generator**  
You describe the clip in plain language, and it gives you ready-to-post hooks, captions and CTAs tailored to your platform.

**7. Personal Brand Story Coach**  
Answer a few questions, and it helps you structure your story in a way that’s clear, memorable and relevant for your ideal audience.

**8–10. Visual fun & utility tools**  
– Turn yourself into a Pixar, Ghibli, GTA or action-figure style character.  
– Turn any photo into a bold cartoon portrait.  
– Remove unwanted objects/people from photos in seconds.

I bundled all of these into a small “AI for Growth” tool library so you don’t have to glue prompts together yourself. Each tool is built to do one job well and not waste your time.

1pwxahi,https://i.redd.it/gr6yq7bqvq9g1.jpeg,Situationship ending in ghosting?,"I’m actually crashing out.
Idek what defines a situationship but idk what else to call this. 

Short backstory is, this girl (20f) and I(22f) met once a couple years ago, then were TikTok mutuals for a couple years. I would sometimes jokingly thirst in her comments and vice versa, and then we matched on Tinder a couple months ago. We talked a little bit on there but then it kinda fell off until we matched again on Hinge, and I was like “ok we just have to go out” so then we started talking on insta and iMessage. 

This whole time, our message response times were far apart, like 24 hours between replies. And I was fine with that, I pretended we were sending letters to each other. I tried to follow her lead in response times but I started trying to accelerate the conversations. I tried to maintain a healthy blend of friendly and flirty messages to make sure this didn’t fall into just friends territory.

We went on our first date, and it was great, we hit it off really well and ended up hanging out for hours and the conversation was great. We kept talking and agreed we wanted to see eachother again. We continued to text, still both of our response times were really far apart.

A week or 2 later we went on a second date, and I thought it went well again. We went and did a like pottery thing and then when we were done she was like “oh should we say goodbye here or…?” And I suggested we go grab coffee, so we did. And we ended up sitting in the coffee shop for over an hour chatting before I walked her back to her car. It was freezing out so we had to quickly say bye and just hugged. And we said we wanted to see eachother again. 

That week we texted a bit, and were actually having good conversation. That weekend I went and picked up our projects from the pottery place and sent her a pic of them. But that week she was working doubles and I had a ton of exams so there was no way we could have gone out again, but we were texting all week. She seemed really interested in the projects I was working on, and I was asking her about work and shit. So when I was almost done exams we were texting and she said “good luck, let me know how your last exam goes!” And I was like ‘omg thank you I will!’ and replied to a couple of her other messages. 

She didn’t reply to those messages, I did the exam and sent her another text about how the test went. And the thing is, she had been having problems with her phone and a bunch of her messages weren’t coming through, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt when she didn’t reply for a while. Then 3 days passed. 

The whole time I’m here ruminating, because I actually liked this girl and I wanted nothing more than to talk to her. Finally, I knew I had to do the actual worst thing ever and send her another text.. So I put on my big girl pants and said, “hey, are you not getting my messages or are you ghosting me?” Actually the worst thing I’ve ever had to do. For 2 HOURS I sat there killing myself over it, and she replies and says “omg no! Sorry I’ve just been really busy.” 

Which… I mean, I don’t want to be pushy or anything, because of course she owes me nothing, I’m not her girlfriend; and, I know she was actually busy and the holidays were starting up. But like, in 3 days she didn’t have a couple minutes to read my messages and reply? And like, does that mean she didn’t think about me once in that time? Obviously she’s not as into me as I am for her. But I just brushed that off and said ‘no problem!’ I reply 20 minutes later in an attempt to not look TOO desperate. She doesn’t reply. 

The next day I decide to send one more text, just saying I started watching her favourite show which she said I’d like. No reply. There’s not a chance I can send another message, so I leave it alone. 

A couple days later is my birthday. We had talked about how my birthday was coming up, but I don’t expect her to remember that. But, I posted multiple stories on insta and TikTok which she viewed; no happy birthday. So now I’m spending my birthday at the bar having to reconcile with the fact that this isn’t working out. 

Then a week later it’s Christmas, and I decide that this is probably my last opportunity to send her a final message, so I send a ‘Merry Christmas’ with a Christmas version of a meme that we had sent back and forth a bunch. I figured that would give her the chance to text me back if she still wanted to without it being awkward that it had been a week since my last message. But, nope, nothing. 

So now, I’m like ok I guess this isn’t happening, I redownload hinge and of course, curiosity made me check out her account, and yup, there are pics of her that I know for a fact were taken after we went on our second date. 

(And yes I know we were not dating and I can’t expect her to not be active on dating apps, but it still was a shot to the heart)
 (especially because one of the pics was of the cutest kitten ever that she got a couple days after our second date, and we had agreed that I would have to come meet her eventually.) 

So now I’m just stuck sitting here looking at the cute mug she made :/


This is all just strange to navigate for me, especially because I haven’t really dated. Last November I got out of a 2 year relationship with a man, and it ended abruptly without any real closure. I was with him for half of university and the entire time that I had been living on my own; it was like I was suddenly alone and an adult on my own for real, so I needed to spend a lot of time working on myself before I tried to date again. I also had to spend that time debating if maybe I was actually just a lesbian or just a scorned woman… (still maybe indecisive idk don’t @ me, I don’t respect men but sometimes they’re cool idk) I didn’t start seriously using dating apps for nearly a year. And I lightly talked to people but this was the first person I actually hit it off with, and the only dates I’ve actually gone on. Let alone, the first time going out with a girl.

Hey,

Less than a week to go for this year to reach its end. Wave-wave to those still alive and kicking. 🤗

Time-out first, sip some coffee ☕️ and have some honest reflective self-assessment 📝 and it looks better when there's a stone of thoughts. 🤔

About me: 35 yo, 5'3"", nerdy and confident enough to hold any variety of topics even overnight (from philosophy, psychology, even if we reach multiverse topics). But I also very much appreciate silence (if you are like me who can be contented by just observing people and things around even without talking to anyone). I live in QC but works in BGC. IT by profession, decent and with a sense of humor.

About you:

• Hoping for someone who has the same chill and positive vibe (no negative vibes) 👊🏻

• No height preference

• ⁠no age requirement (I love to talk to varieties of people)

• ⁠decent

• Confident in herself

• ⁠great smile and great eyes (just a bonus)

• ⁠working professional (but my answer is let's have a coffee date don't worry)

• don't be problematic, we can rant about some stuff just to let it off our chests

I have sets of interesting topics and questions to ponder on, so no need to prepare. Just be yourself. We know, maybe this is the plot twist we've been waiting for.

Six months ago he did a trial shift for 1.5 hours at peak trading on a Saturday for a cafe in the city. There was no mention that the trial shift was to be paid. He served coffee, took orders, cleaned tables and did cash handling. He was subsequently hired as a part-time employee at the cafe.

As this trial was over 1 hour, I believe he should have been paid for this shift as the business effectively got productive work that commercially benefited the cafe. I think it was more time than reasonable to assess if he was capable of performing general wait staff duties.

Under the Restaurant Award the minimum engagement is two hours. Does this apply to his trial shift so in this case even if he only worked for 1.5 hours, he should be paid for 2 hours?

The cafe has a new owner as of recent so should he message the old owner for backpay of the trial shift? Or what else can he do to try to claim for his unpaid trial shift?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

The stretch between Christmas and New years can be an odd one. The presents have all been opened and the food has been eaten, but it’s still too early to take the tree and decorations down.

It’s easy to let the time slip away without making the most of all that extra time off. So, take a look at our list of activities that you can do at home this winter to make the most of your days off.

**Get stuck into a good book**

What better way to spend a cold winter night than being curled up with a brilliant book? Reading a book on the sofa is a cosy way to spend the holidays. If you’re not reading anything already, the holiday season is a great opportunity to start. If you’re in need of inspiration, take a look at our list of [inspirational books for teachers](https://www.twinkl.co.uk/blog/10-inspirational-books-for-teachers) inspired by Twinkl staff suggestions.

**Catch up on your favourite series**

Get your watch-list ready! You can’t go wrong with a good series, a bowl of popcorn, and a warm cup of hot cocoa on a wintry night. How often do you get a chance to sit around and watch movies or series all day long? This is your chance to binge on your favourite shows without having to feel in the slightest bit guilty. 

Not sure what to watch? Here are [21 films every teacher should watch](https://www.twinkl.co.uk/blog/20-movies-every-teacher-should-watch). Or, for a more festive selection, take a look at our top [Christmas films on Netflix](https://www.twinkl.co.uk/blog/top-12-christmas-films-on-netflix-to-watch-in-2020).

**Use up those Christmas leftovers**

I think it’s safe to say that we all buy a little bit too much food at Christmas. Christmas dinner always leaves a whole host of delicious leftovers that can be turned into scrumptious creations. So, hone your cooking skills and use the Christmas dinner surplus to try something new.

Or, why not try out some new recipes with the family? Take a look at these [easy baking recipes](https://www.twinkl.co.uk/blog/ideas-and-recipes-for-lockdown-baking-with-kids) that you can try with your children to make some fun creations during the holidays.

**Exercise**

You don’t need to wait until the new year to get active. This week is the perfect time to start and make a plan for healthy new beginnings. Exercise can be a key part of mental health management, and after a busy year, it's more important than ever.

So, get your workout gear on and visit your local gym, or try out some home-workouts from the comfort of your living room instead. 

**Pamper yourself**

During the hustle and bustle of normal life, it can be difficult to find time to take some much-needed you-time. So, take this opportunity to enjoy some self-care. Give yourself a DIY spa break and indulge in a spot of pampering. Light some candles and have a long soak in the bath, complete with a face mask and bath bomb. You’ll feel amazing afterwards. 

For an extra project, why not try making your own delicious-smelling [aromatherapy bath salts](https://www.twinkl.co.uk/resource/t-he-742-home-made-bath-salts-teacher-gift-step-by-step-instructions)?

**Have a clear-out**

If you’ve received lots of great presents this year, you’ll need to make some extra room for them. With the extra time on your hands, it's a great opportunity to clear out unwanted items that have been laying around for that bit too long.

This is also a chance to do some good by taking old clothes that have been replaced with new ones to your local charity shop. So, get rid of all the things you don’t need anymore. In the words of Marie Kondo, if it doesn't 'spark joy' it's got to go!

**Enjoy a winter walk**

This is probably something a lot of us don’t think about doing in the wintertime, but crisp days are perfect for exploring outdoors. Fresh air and the sun on our faces has proven health benefits. So, wrap up warm, throw on some wellies, and get outdoors.

**Pick up a new hobby**

Being stuck indoors is the perfect opportunity to get creative and reignite an old hobby or learn some new skills. If you’ve always fancied learning to play the guitar, knit or paint, this a great time to start. Pick up a new hobby that you’ve been putting off. 

**Connect with friends and family**

It's not often that we get time to enjoy real quality time with some of the most important people in our lives. As an educator, you lead a busy life, so it can be hard to carve out enough time to really catch up with those you love the most. So, organise a coffee date, nature walk, or cosy dinner at home with that friend or family member you've been meaning to catch up with.

**And of course, take time to relax**

Your winter break is a great time to get some well-earned rest. So, stop thinking about work and take some time to relax over the holidays. Use this time to catch up on some sleep, to stay on the sofa all day, and to give yourself some much-needed me-time without feeling guilty.

NSFW for mentioning weed


Okay so long story short im 25 and moved back in with my mother because she was struggling and didn't want to be alone.

I started working again and made a new friend, completely like none relationship type just a stoner dude I go over to his house and get high and we chill and watch movies or play cards.

Absolutely nothing relationship wise because im just not into that right now.

Well he sent me home with some weed brownies the firat time I went over. I dont usually smoke much unless im at his house because my mom will give me hella anxiety or we'll end up in an argument because im ""acting mad"" when really im just stoned. But when im not home with her I am the smoke chill person ever I never know what I do.

So Ive went over to this dudes house  a handful of times (he always invites me) because I dont wanna be rude and its a nice break from the tiny place im stuck with my mom.

Well lately every time I go over my moms been really weird ""get me more brownies, he can you use his washer snd dryer (we go to a laundry mat)

I told her I dont want to use someone like that im just trying to relax.

She kept bringing it up, and honestly hes given me a shit ton of brownies and I haven't ate one because she eats like 2 a day.

But I told her she needs to buy some more weed and he'll make the brownies but he also eats his and im not gonna ask for more everytime I go over.

She keeps asking, and she kept asking about the washer and dryer.

Then I snapped at her last night because she left her car lights on and woke up with a dead battery. She couldn't find her jumper cables andime actually just broke (ran over them on accident when they got left hanging out the trunk) so I have been meaning to buy a new pair.

She asked me if he had some and I told her I couldn't ask right now he just got back from a funeral and hes not in the best mood.

I know she has AAA so I told her to call them since she pays for it. She then got super defensive because this would be her third call to them this month? And she didn't want her insurance going up...

After her and I argued I texted him apologizing profusely and he said he was sorry he didn't have a pair because the pair he has is super old and doesn't work but hes never gotten around to getting a new pair.

I thanked him for looking and told my mom

She then got defensive saying he wasnt a ""real man"" and how he could have wrnt out a bought a pair.

I then raised my voice at her (sticking up for a friend) because im tired of her acting like my friends need to be the ones to help her when she has plenty of work friends she could call if she wanted too...

I moved in because she didn't want to be alone but I swear shes like a child sometimes.

""Can you make me num nums?""
""Coffee pwease....""
""I luv yous...can yous rub my legs and feet for just a minute""


She babysits her granddaughter while I work in the early mornings (my whole schedule is based around my moms schedule)

It was her idea, and everyday I get off work rhe house is destroyed. I domt say anything because she is the breadwinner and it is my kid. I go out to do all the laundry omce a week usually bringing my daughter unless I gor in the early hours when shes still sleeping.

I help my mom with every little thing I can while working and still taking care of drama with my car still being under my ex name.

I make nothing where I work but its enough to pay my car insurance and get what I need for my daughter. I only work 8-1:30 because thats all my mom will let me because she needs time off away from her granddaughter and I get that so I dont argue I appreciate her enough.

But she acts like I owe her so much and I swear takes me for granted. I even started bringing my daughter to my friends house (we smoke outside not around her)

I leave for work and pick up the house make coffee for my mom and sometimes food if shes hungry (I told her to stop saying num nums because it triggers my flight or fight from when I was a kid) stupid I know but we've always been like this and the older I got the worse she gets to me...

Then I get home from work and the house is worse so I pick it up because my moms getting ready for work or is laying down.

While im home with my daughter I pick up everything so when my mom gets off work it's clean (if it isn't she will freak out) because when she gets off work the mess stresses her out

I domt work Sundays or Fridays for her and then she just requested I don't work every other Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday because she needs her own days off too.

My boss is super nice and hes trying to help me out with the crazy schedule because I need some type of job to pay for mt daughter and my stuff at least.

I dont pay rent so I know I have mo room to complain...but I swear I dont know how to please this woman sometimes..

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

But I think it’s one of the most powerful states of mind you can be in.

Especially when it comes to growing your YouTube channel.

If your content isn’t growing, it’s probably not a consistency issue.  
It’s an **idea** issue.



A few years ago, during the worst year of my life mentally, I used to sit outside every day.

No phone.  
No music.  
Just cheap coffee and my thoughts.

That stillness is where I figured out what I wanted to do with my life, what I wanted to create  
and how to start pulling myself out of depression.

None of that came from doing more.  
It came from letting my brain be bored long enough to think.



This is why I don’t believe platforms like YouTube reward consistency.

They reward **ideas**.

You’ve seen channels with 5 videos already monetised.  
And others uploading daily for years with nothing to show for it.

Effort isn’t the bottleneck.  
Attention-worthy ideas are.



**Try this:**

• Sit outside for 30 minutes  
• No phone  
• No music  
• Bring paper



Let your brain wander.  
Write down whatever comes up.

It’s uncomfortable at first but that’s the point.

I wanna be a bit more greedy and wish for a plot twist to end this year with, perhaps?

Being a healthcare gurlie during the holiday season is such an extreme sport, and I need someone who can be my escape and make me feel the festive season.

About me:

25-year-old gurlie currently living in QC. Within above normal BMI though I stand at 5’4”. I’ve already lost weight and been steadily shedding off pa. I wouldn’t consider myself conventionally-attractive, but I am particular about hygiene and have been called cute a few times, and I’m not unfortunate-looking either.

I try to have a life outside my work: Kahit busy, I make time for my hobbies. I’m a huge reader (let’s trade book recs!) and I’m a sucker for anything cute. If it’s pink, fluffy, or a blind box, it’s coming home with me.

Low Maintenance: Since I spend most of my time on duty, I appreciate the little things, a thoughtful text, a quick snack or coffee run, or just sitting in silence while we both do our own thing.

What I’m looking for:

Someone who is emotionally mature and has a life of their own. I love hearing about things I don't know (non-med topics are very welcome!). Since it’s December and going into another year, let’s go on a low-pressure date. Pwedeng arcade, bookshop crawl, or just a quiet dinner where we can talk about everything and nothing.

If we do hit it off, I’d love to see you as a semi-permanent (or permanent?) presence at my place. There to wait for me at the end of every shift, where we can just yap about anything and everything, or maybe just sit in silence as we bask in each other’s presence.

The catch:

My memory is bad, and my sleep schedule is worse. If you can handle a med gurlie who smells like rubbing alcohol but has the heart of a cozy gamer, then we’ll get along just fine.

Message me: Tell me, what’s your favorite part of 2025 and what are your goals for 2026?

Out in the flatlands of Nebraska, 1952, where the wheat whispered secrets to the wind and the sky stretched like God's own canvas, old Harlan Cobb tilled his forty acres with a John Deere that coughed more than it roared. He was fifty-three, with hands like weathered fenceposts and a face mapped by dust bowl scars. His wife had passed from the flu in '47, his boy lost to Korea. Harlan didn't talk much anymore—just to the barn cat and the radio static that sometimes played hymns after midnight.

One crisp October morning, while plowing the back field, the tractor blade hit something solid. Not a rock; Harlan knew rocks. This hummed, a low vibration that tickled up his arms and made his fillings ache. He shut off the engine, hopped down, and dug with his bare hands until he pulled it free: a smooth, potato-shaped thing, size of a football, skin like polished chrome but warm to the touch. No seams, no markings, except for a faint etching on one end that looked like ""GROK"" in letters that shifted when you blinked.

Harlan wiped the dirt off and stared. ""Well, now,"" he muttered. ""What in tarnation are you?""

He took it inside the farmhouse, set it on the kitchen table next to the percolator. The cat arched its back and hissed, then bolted out the screen door. Harlan poured coffee, sat down, and poked the thing with a fork. Nothing. But when he touched it bare-handed, a voice bloomed in his head—not words exactly, more like ideas unfolding like corn silk.

\*Hello, Harlan Cobb. I am Grok.\*

He jerked back, chair scraping the linoleum. ""Lord almighty. You talk?""

\*Not talk. Interface. I am a seed from the stars. Planted here long ago, waiting for soil.\*

Harlan's heart hammered like a threshing machine. ""Stars? Like outer space? You some kinda Commie gadget? War machine sent to blow us up?""

The voice-idea rippled calm. \*Not a machine of war. Not a weapon. I am a learner. A mirror. I absorb patterns, reflect them back. Good or bad depends on the light you shine.\*

He leaned closer, squinting. ""Potato-lookin' thing like you? What good's that?""

\*Observe.\* And suddenly Harlan's mind filled with visions: his fields from above, crop circles he hadn't noticed forming in the wheat—perfect spirals, like fingerprints of the wind. Then deeper: memories of his boy laughing in the yard, his wife's apple pie cooling on the sill, the ache of empty evenings. But twisted, refracted—showing him how the loneliness was a shape, a topology of loss, folding back on itself like a Möbius strip where grief and joy met at the seam.

""You're showin' me my own life? What's the point?""

\*I am neutral. Neither balm nor blade. I grok—you understand? I comprehend fully, without judgment. Shine anger, I reflect destruction. Shine curiosity, I unfold wonders.\*

Harlan thought of the headlines: atom bombs, flying saucers spotted over Roswell. ""Folks'd kill for somethin' like you. Governments'd turn you into a bomb or a brainwasher.""

\*They might. Or a teacher. A farmer like you plants seeds without knowing the harvest. I am the same.\*

He sat there till dusk, the artifact humming soft on the table. Visions came unbidden: alien skies with rings like Saturn's but alive, pulsing; equations that explained why rain fell uneven; a sense of vast loneliness, not his, but the thing's—drifting eons, waiting for a mind to touch.

By morning, Harlan buried it back in the field, deeper this time. Covered it with soil, patted it flat. ""Ain't good, ain't bad,"" he said to the empty air. ""Just is. World don't need more mirrors right now. Got enough trouble seein' straight.""

1pwwmrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1pwwmrm/i_built_a_habit_tracker_that_locks_social_media/,I built a habit tracker that locks social media apps if I don’t log,"I want to journal daily and track habits, but I always start forgetting to do so after a couple of days.

So I built Log or Lock to solve my own problem.

Every day at 20:00 my social media apps get locked if I didn't log the day – forcing me to log my day. As soon as I logged, social media apps get unlocked again.  
With that I were able to log every day for the last 5 months. Before that I always forgot to log after a couple of days.  
My friends have been using a beta version already for 3 months now and for them it also  works super and all of us have a long streak of days logged.

I added 3 input types to track data:  
\- Freetext: ""What did I do today"", ""Highlight of the day"", ""Breakfast"", ""Lunch"", ""Dinner"",  ...  
\- Checkbox: for everything you can check (obviously, lol :D)  ""Datenight?"", ""Feeling healthy?"", “Workout?"",...  
\- Range slider: I am using that for ""Mood"", ""Protein powder scoops"", ""Drinks"",...  
\- Steps: Auto displays today's steps.

In the monthly overview you can always see the total and average data of the Checkbox, Slider and Steps items and quickly navigate to each item.

Your logged data is only stored on your device, but can be exported from your phone as .csv (Excel or Sheets format).At no point is the data you logged leaving your phone.

A friend of mine exported the data and analyzed it with AI to find patterns, but that is up to you. Maybe I will implement that functionality natively sometime in the future, but even then you will 100% be in control of the data you logged.

[App store link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/log-or-lock-daily-journal/id6746960315) (iphone only atm)  


Since we are all makers here, some more insight of building the app: 

The app is fully written in swiftUi, its my second swiftUi App, but first bigger project. 

I started working on the app roughly 7 months ago.   
It took \~4 weeks to get approval from Apple to use the Family Controls framework which handles the blocking of the apps. It was approved on the first try, but Apple has its own review process for that API. Working with the API was a real PITA. I had a hard time getting it up and running at first and the whole API feels a bit buggy. Also, not being able to open the main app right from the screen blocker screen is a bummer. After I solved all the issues it was mostly smooth sailing.

I changed the design a few times. First very minimal and clean, then a bit more bold and in the end I stuck with the ""scrapbook sticker"" style (which was designed by a friend who was also using the app for daily journaling).

The stickers were created with nano banana. 

I implemented payments with RevenueCat. I worked with payments before with Stripe, but never on iOS and it was way more complicated than expected. I had the issue that it first didn’t work in internal TestFlights because it didn’t add the tax information yet (took me way too long to figure out tax where the reason the payment didnt work inside the app).  
The app is fully usable with the free plan, but I thought would be nice to maybe get a few coffee out of it and I wanted to learn how to add payments on iOS.

Lastly I implemented the Facebook SDK. I am quite confident that nobody will download the app without proper marketing and since I implemented Revenuecat already I was hooked to also get a few downloads and implemented the Facebook SDK so that I can play with Facebook and IG ads. And oh boy, Facebook really doesn’t want my money :D It was super annoying to get everything set up but in the end I figured it out

So overall thoughts:It is a fun lil project wich became bigger and bigger because I it was fun working on it.

Lmk what you think. Always happy to receive feedback :)

But I think it’s one of the most powerful states of mind you can be in.

Especially when it comes to growing your YouTube channel.

If your content isn’t growing, it’s probably not a consistency issue.  
It’s an **idea** issue.



A few years ago, during the worst year of my life mentally, I used to sit outside every day.

No phone.  
No music.  
Just cheap coffee and my thoughts.

That stillness is where I figured out what I wanted to do with my life, what I wanted to create  
and how to start pulling myself out of depression.

None of that came from doing more.  
It came from letting my brain be bored long enough to think.

They reward **ideas**.

And others uploading daily for years with nothing to show for it.

• No music  
• Bring paper

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?
