( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

The lock screen photo made my stomach drop.,"It all started with a hunt for a misplaced iPad. We were about to head out for dinner, and I couldn't find it anywhere. I checked the usual spots—the coffee table, under the couch cushions, our bedroom. Nada. I called his phone to ask if he’d seen it, and as I was on the line with him, I heard a faint, second vibration coming from the bottom of his gym bag in the closet. My heart kind of did a lurchy thing. He'd always been a 'one phone, one number' kind of guy.

My curiosity got the best of me. After he said he hadn't seen the iPad, I hung up and reached into the bag. Sure enough, my fingers closed around the cool, smooth case of a smartphone I’d never seen before. It wasn’t his usual one. The screen lit up as I picked it up, and my breath caught in my throat. The lock screen was a smiling picture of him with another woman and a little girl. They looked so happy, like a perfect little family at a park picnic. I felt the blood drain from my face.

When he walked into the room a minute later, I was just standing there, holding the phone like it was a live grenade. He saw it and the color drained from his face, too. The silence was deafening. He couldn't lie his way out of this one; the evidence was literally glowing in my hand. It all came tumbling out—he had a whole other life. He'd reconnected with an ex from before he met me, she'd had a child, and he'd been playing house with them on weekends he was supposedly on 'work trips.' Five years, and it felt like I was living with a complete stranger.

Now I’m sitting in our—my?—apartment, surrounded by photos of a life that suddenly feels like a complete lie. He's been begging, crying, saying he loves me and that it was a mistake he didn't know how to get out of. But how do you come back from this? How do you un-see a secret family? He shattered my reality, and I feel like I'm breaking into a million pieces.

	•	Candida
	•	White flour
	•	Food additives: E621, E622, E623

Honestly, it feels very restrictive, and I’m not sure if this test is scientifically valid.

	•	Is the BICOM bioresonance test scientifically accurate or reliable?
	•	Should I really base my diet on these results?
	•	Has anyone here tried this type of testing or therapy, and did it actually help?

The last few times I have gone I have gotten cup, filled the cup with just a swallow or so each flavor and then tasted each one. There wasn't even one that I would want to drink a large size cup of, they all are gross! I really loved the old french vanilla cappuccino!

I only know of one location that has the old style machine and I was able to buy a whole bag of it after asking and waiting while they got it out of the back stock room. Does anyone know of any locations that have the old machines and/or powder available? Do the stores that have the bar style coffee still carry or have the powder? I would guess not but does anyone know? Why is the new coffee so gross? It is really, really bad! Even the drip coffee is not very good I tried it cause I didn't like any of the bar ones. 

Also from my understanding most of (eventually all I am sure) the soda machines are getting messed up in a similar way where all flavors come out of one spout and it severely limits the number of people able to get a drink at one given time. ",0,1761070318.0,QuikTrip,0,0.5,False

My ex and I dated for six years before we broke up three years ago. He wanted to focus on his startup and I wanted stability, so we ended things. It hurt but we stayed friendly. I met my husband a year later and we got married pretty quickly. He's a good guy. Stable job, treats me well, the whole package.

But lately my ex has been doing really well. Like, really well. His company just got bought out for millions and he's all over the business news. Meanwhile my husband just got promoted to regional manager at his retail chain. It's a decent promotion but let's be real, it's not the same league.

Two weeks ago my husband came home all excited about his promotion. He was going on and on about the raise and the new responsibilities. I was happy for him but then he said something like, ""Maybe now we can finally afford that house you wanted.""

And I just said it. ""Your promotion is nice but it's not like what my ex just did. He's actually changing his industry.""

My husband's face just froze. He asked what I meant and I explained how impressive the buyout was. How my ex had built something from nothing. I wasn't trying to be mean. I was just being honest.

He got quiet. Like scary quiet. Then he said, ""Why do you even know so much about what he's doing?""

I told him we still talk sometimes. Not often. Just catching up. My husband asked if I ever mentioned these conversations to him before. I said no because it never seemed important.

He walked out of the room and didn't talk to me the rest of the night.

The next week was weird. He was polite but distant. And then my ex texted me asking if I wanted to grab coffee to celebrate his success. I said yes. Why wouldn't I? We're adults. We can be friends.

Coffee turned into lunch. Lunch turned into him saying he was taking a weekend trip to the coast to decompress and would I want to come. Just as friends. Separate rooms.

I thought about it. My husband and I were supposed to have our anniversary that weekend but we weren't in a great place anyway. Maybe some space would be good. So I told my husband I was going to visit my college roommate for the weekend. He said okay and didn't ask any questions.

The weekend with my ex was amazing. We talked for hours. He told me he'd been thinking about our breakup a lot lately. How he regretted choosing work over me. How seeing me married made him realize what he'd lost. We didn't do anything physical. Just talked. But it felt like old times.

I got home Sunday night and the locks were changed. My key didn't work. I called my husband like fifteen times before he finally answered.

He said, ""Your stuff is at the Sunset Motel on Route 9. Room 127. I paid for two weeks. After that you're on your own.""

I asked what he was talking about. He said he knew I wasn't with my college roommate. I asked how and he said it didn't matter. Then he said, ""I also sent your parents receipts for everything I've paid for you since we got married. Your car payment. Your credit cards. Everything. They should have received them about an hour ago.""

I started freaking out. I went to the motel and sure enough all my stuff was there. Boxes and suitcases everywhere. I called my parents and my mom answered crying. She said she was disappointed in me. That she didn't raise me to treat people like this. My dad wouldn't even talk to me.

I tried calling my husband again but he blocked me. I went back to the house but he'd already filed for separation and had a lawyer send me papers.

My friends are split. Some say I messed up badly. Others say my husband overreacted and this is financial abuse. My ex says he feels terrible and didn't mean to cause problems but also he's not backing off if I want to give things a real shot now.

But here's the thing. I didn't cheat. We had separate rooms. I just went on a trip with a friend. Yeah I lied about where I was going but my husband had been cold to me all week. And yeah maybe I shouldn't have compared their careers but I was just stating facts. My ex is more successful. That's just reality.

Now I'm living in a motel, my parents won't help me financially, and my husband is moving forward with divorce proceedings. His lawyer is brutal and apparently he's kept records of every text I've sent to my ex for the past six months. I didn't even know he knew about them.

Everyone keeps saying I destroyed my marriage but I feel like my husband just gave up without even trying to work through things.

So am I actually the problem here or did he just blow this completely out of proportion?

This morning he turns on the light, goes in and makes a cup of coffee and then comes back in and asks me to move to the other side of the bed so he can relax in bed and have his coffee. In a daze I did. About 2 mins later I’m pissed. He’s got the light on, scrolling on his phone, drinking his coffee, and tapping his foot (like an ankle shaking type nervous thing?). I get up and he asks where I’m going, I say well either home to sleep the rest of my 1.5 hours or to make some coffee I guess. 

He in turn goes on about how my bad attitude has ruined his day for work. 

As far as I know, usually when one person gets up before the other, they may turn on the light for a minute and get dressed or get their clothes for the day and turn the light back off and go into another room. It’s the polite and thoughtful thing to do.

‍

**Why This Pick?**

4 of the last 5 meetings between these two squads have comfortably sailed Over 228.0 points. I admit, it’s tempting to think both teams might get off to a slow start, or that the team with the league’s best defensive rating might bode well for a low-scoring affair, but that notoriously just hasn’t been the case when the Thunder faces the Rockets. My money’s on the Over to cash this evening.

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve. I'm pretty lowkey and keep it real.

**A Bit About Me**

* I'm a good listener, and I appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter
* I like calm company—hanging in a voice call while we each do our own thing is underrated
* I'm into solo hobbies, but always open to trying something new if someone brings the spark
* I'm the type who loves to listen and be there for people, but I'll give advice if I can help. Sometimes just being present for someone is what matters most

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I'm not looking for a big group or server—just hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing—I'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM—I'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest—most of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats—mostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style—and I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way—I'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives—conspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content. I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies—I'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now—mostly desk work—but I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night—just watching the lightning and chilling—that hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

And hey, if none of this resonates with you, that's totally fine. I'm always looking to try new things and pick up new interests.

I'm mainly looking for genuine connections and friendships first, but I'm open to seeing where things go naturally if we really click. No pressure, no expectations.

1ock50e,https://www.reddit.com/r/eds/comments/1ock50e/discovered_i_have_a_rare_variant_of_ceds_and_now/,Discovered I have a rare variant of cEDS and now showing signs of cardiovascular events and no one told me they’ve known for at least a year!,"*original tag was “medical advice welcome” but I changed it to this triggering warning due to circumstances around me.

I used this tag (medical advice welcome) because it is absolutely welcomed, but I also feel like I maybe need to vent. I’m confused and angry and none of my doctors know what to do because no one in our massive metro, bordering two states, treats adult zebras.

I have the genetic marker for cEDS, but my COL5A2 gene is mutated. No one so far has been able to tell me what that means for me and “they” have never seen it before. It’s been bothering me ever since I got my genetic test results back over a year ago.

I’m 42 and ended up in the ER a week ago for a month long flare I could no longer stand. The pain was unbearable. Ultimately, they ended up running labs that had never been run on me before with a few coming back abnormal. My white blood cell count is elevated, my D-dimer is elevated, some other things were abnormal, and when they eventually did an ecg due to some of the symptoms that worsened, that came back abnormal too.

The problem is that I wasn’t told about the ecg results, and when I went further into my history on the portal, there is actually a history of abnormal ecgs with results showing an inferior infarct (heart attack) of unknown age. Why the HELL wasn’t I informed or given a cardiology consult while I was hospitalized when they first discovered this, and why was I not given a cardiology referral from the ER or told I needed to discuss the results with my primary?

It turns out that this variant is rare—about 20 documented cases—but is being considered for being classed as a cardiovascular type! If *I* can find this information, why the hell haven’t *ANY* of my doctors looked into it and taken the initiative to get me to the right specialists for further monitoring and treatment?! I’m 42!! I ate right, I quit smoking, quit drinking alcohol and coffee and pop and was active before my legs stopped working. Why was no attention paid to the fact that a young woman showed a history of increasing heart problems? This seems like medicine 101!

There is so much more here to it than just these things, which makes it even harder for me to understand why heart problems wouldn’t have been addressed with me, especially while I was actively inpatient. I feel like any other human that isn’t a zebra would have immediately been ushered in the direction of cardiology for further investigation. Now, I have a, likely, silent heart attack in my history, with new data showing my heart has continued to progress in negative ways. Results showing that some part of my heart isn’t getting enough oxygenated blood. The D-dimer lab showed I was potentially fighting blood clots, which was further backed up by other abnormal results that can show the same potential, there’s a large history of heart issues in my family, which I only just found out about because I had to ask my daddy about directly (he’s always just changed the subject or said he didn’t know when medical history in his family was brought up), even though he isn’t who I got EDS from, and I have a brain aneurysm, and as we all know, blood clots and brain aneurysms don’t play well together; and to add to that, my maternal grandmother died of a subarachnoid hemorrhage of a brain aneurysm, at 39, in the same place I have mine.

Talk about getting lost in the system. I’m angry. To top it all off, we have two family emergencies we’re going through that could give anyone a heart attack, and I wish that was hyperbole. One of my adult babies had to be admitted for being a danger to himself, and my baby brother (also adult) tried to unalive himself. He’s an avid hunter that’s put a *lot* of time and money into guns, blinds, decoys, dogs, you name it. He’s extremely skilled. He never has to buy meat for his family, and he’s adept at preserving the meat and even makes his own sausages and snack foods and such.

As soon as it was discovered that he was suicidal, family went in and cleared his home of all of his guns, ammo, hunting knives, anything they could to try and keep him safe. My baby sister just begged them all to call 911, but no one did. She wasn’t able to because she was in places she couldn’t make phone calls. I don’t know who it was my brother called, but when they answered the phone, the first words out of his mouth were “you missed one.” He had one in the chamber and was holding it to his head.

This all comes just a couple weeks after the anniversary of my step-brother’s suicide, which was right after the anniversary of the death of my best friend and her baby.

I can’t cope, man. Now I’m scared about my heart not being able to deal with all of this, with 2 young kids still at home. With one of our oldest being unwell, we’re not telling any of our kids about my heart. We want the focus to be on him and he already blames himself for his own best friend’s unaliving just a few years ago, which we found out about while watching the evening news. I’m terrified he’ll somehow think my heart problems are his fault or feel like he can’t still come to us when he’s not doing well because of the anxiety and fear it would cause me, as it would *any* parent. He knows his best friend’s choice wasn’t his fault, but he can’t make his brain believe it. But I also can’t just shut off my anxiety, fear, stress, and sadness for our son because he almost died when he was born and I’ve always felt like the universe has just been waiting to take him from me.

I didn’t even intend on sharing any of this. And I’ll be changing my tag to alert for the trigger warnings. I just don’t know what to do. I’m supposed to reduce my stress and anxiety and rest and shit, but come. On. Seriously? Fucking HOW! There is no world where these situations won’t cause stress and anxiety. And yes, therapy. But I’ve only just gotten the diagnosis of conversion disorder off of my diagnosis list, which kept me from being able to find a therapist that would even see me. But I’m actively working on getting in with one, with the help of my psychiatrist.

I have several diagnoses that cause nearly identical symptoms to a typical heart attack, including chest pain, frequently, so I don’t know when it’s an emergency or not and it just isn’t reasonable or feasible for me to call 911 or go to the ER every time I have these symptoms. And without knowing when my heart attack was, I can’t even attempt to try and figure out what the circumstances were, to help me better understand. Maybe I’m being selfish, but getting in with a cardiologist and getting this echocardiogram done seem extremely urgent to me and I haven’t received calls to set up appts and it’s causing me more anxiety. I know this is an absolutely absurd thing to even *think*, but I feel like it’s all so unfair. I’ve had enough. I’ve been through enough. I’m so out of spoons I’m in the red. My fatigue is so severe I just lay in bed feeling like the weight of everything is holding me down and I can’t move.

I know the answer is likely “no,” but does anyone else have this same variant, or insight into it? It’s clearly different from vEDS, but those with vEDS, how do you cope with life like this? How do you know when your chest pain is an emergency or 911 call? How do you tell the difference between an anxiety attack, panic attack, gastroparesis issue, joint issue, impinged nerve issue, or an actual heart attack? And am I wrong for being pissed off that I wasn’t told? The only reason I even know is because I looked at all the labs and test results very carefully and had to do the research myself before I brought it to my primary’s attention, because none of the tests that came back abnormal in the ER were ever addressed, including whatever infection I have that has my white blood cell count up, and other than the results being available for my doc to see, none of these seemingly very important issues were put in the paperwork for my follow-up to *be* addressed *at* my follow-up. Just for clarification purposes, my primary has ties to a different hospital than the hospital I go to for everything.

I’m sorry for the trauma dumping. Thanks for reading if you did. If you just “1-2 skip a few 99-100’d” your way to the very end here, I get it. It’s a lot and if you’re low on spoons, please save them for yourself. I know so many people have it so much worse than I do, I just feel alone.",1,1761069780.0,eds,0,1.0,False
1ock4zs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmITheJerk/comments/1ock4zs/aitj_for_fakefiring_a_coworker_to_shame_rude/,AITJ for fake-firing a coworker to shame rude customers?,"So I'm a high schooler working weekends at a local coffee shop. My weekend crew is basically James (the owner's son, who goes to my school and is a super chill ""shift manager"") and Danielle, a cool college student.

Sometimes, customers come in and just... lose it over the smallest things. Like, a grown man yelling because his coffee ""isn't hot enough"" straight from the brewer. It's exhausting and kinda sad, getting yelled at for stuff we can't even control.

One day, James and I were joking about how to deal with these people, and we came up with a bit of a bit. The next time a guy was screaming at me about the coffee temp, James marched over and did his whole ""Sir, is there a problem?"" thing. The guy started ranting at him, too. Then James turned to me and said, ""OP, this is unacceptable. You're fired.""

I immediately started laying it on thick. ""Please, no! My family needs the money, I really need this job!"" fake crying, the whole thing. James played the hard-nosed boss, telling me to take off my apron and get out.

The crazy part? The angry guy totally backtracked! He was like, ""Whoa, whoa, it's not that serious, don't fire her!"" It was wild. James just said, ""No, we pride ourselves on service,"" and escorted me to the back. We had a good laugh and I went back to work a few minutes later.

We've done it a few times since when someone's really going off on Danielle or me, and almost every time, the customer apologizes and says they didn't mean for anyone to get in trouble. It's kinda satisfying to see them realize their tantrum has consequences.

I was telling some friends about it and a few said it was a mean prank, that it's messed up to let someone think they cost a kid their job. I thought it was just harmless fun that taught them a lesson, but now I'm second-guessing. AITJ?",1,1761069779.0,AmITheJerk,0,0.67,False
1ock4v2,https://www.reddit.com/r/vrbo/comments/1ock4v2/a_simple_act_of_kindness/,A Simple Act of Kindness,"It was a chilly morning when I walked into the small café that I frequented every day. The smell of freshly brewed coffee filled the air, mixing with the warmth of the place. The barista, a friendly face I had come to recognize, greeted me with a smile, as usual. I ordered my usual, a hot cappuccino with a dash of cinnamon and sat down by the window to enjoy the quiet before the world got too busy.

As I sipped my coffee, I noticed an older woman sitting at the table across from me. She looked a bit lost in thought, her hands wrapped around a steaming cup of tea. She was dressed simply, with a soft scarf around her neck, but there was something about her that made her seem gentle, like she had a story to tell. As I watched her, I couldn’t help but wonder what she was thinking. Maybe she had children, maybe grandchildren, or maybe she was just someone with a lifetime of wisdom in her eyes.

After a few moments, the woman’s gaze shifted toward the barista. She seemed to hesitate for a moment before speaking up. Excuse me, young man, she said softly, I’ve been coming here for weeks, and I always see you working so hard. I just wanted to thank you for always making my tea just the way I like it.

The barista, surprised but genuinely touched, smiled back at her. It’s my pleasure, ma’am. It’s the least I can do.

But before he could return to his work, she continued. You know, kindness goes a long way, she said, looking around the café. I’m a grandmother. I have a lot of children and grandchildren, but life isn’t always easy for them. They work so hard, just like you. They give so much, and sometimes, they don’t hear enough words of gratitude. That’s why I wanted to thank you. Sometimes, a simple act of kindness can mean the world to someone.

The words struck me in a way I wasn’t expecting. I had been so caught up in my own thoughts, my own busy life, that I had failed to notice how important small acts of kindness really were. It’s easy to get caught up in the rush of the world and forget to show appreciation for the people around us. We assume they know how much we care, but often, it’s the little gestures, the simple thank-yous, that make the biggest difference.

As I left the café that morning, I couldn’t stop thinking about that moment. It wasn’t just the woman’s words that stuck with me, but the way she made me realize how important it is to treat others with kindness, just like we would treat our own family. We’re all in this together, and sometimes, all it takes is a smile, a kind word, or a simple thank-you to make someone’s day.

It’s so easy to forget in the hustle and bustle of life, but if we could all remember to treat others like we would treat our own mothers with love, respect, and appreciation, the world would feel a little bit brighter.

1ock456,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Little-Bad3715/comments/1ock456/aita_for_not_being_close_with_my_brother/,AITA for not being close with my brother,"I (18 F) have 2 brothers (24 M) (21 M) and 1 twin sister (18 F). My eldest brother (24 M) has cerebral palsy ( physical disabilities). I have no complain about my eldest brother he is the sweetest person ever, i loveee him . But my 2nd brother is the problem. I despise him. But i can't let my self to cut him off completely. 

Lil background info, 
My father passed away when i was 15. My father had anger issues,  he was very strict person. I do think that maybe because of my father he ( my 2nd brother) turned out like that. My father was abusive with all of us including my mother( unfortunately it is kind of normal here, we live in Bangladesh,  typical brown family dad situation), but he loved my eldest brother so do we. He never spoke harsly with him. As he should. My father was not a bad person but a person with anger issue i guess...

 after my father passed away my 2nd brother who was 18 at that time took access of father's pension bank account, he started to take responsibilities , me and my sister also supported him, but my mother was upset , she wanted to take the responsibility. The reason why we supported him because my mother's mental health was not great at that time, still it is not.( and my trusted her brothers , they weren't good ppl they did scammed my father at past). She was not in her right mind, she would have mental breakdown everyday. We trusted our brother. It's not like my brother was in much better position but he was better that my mother, be did had anger issues just like father. He would get angry beacuse we (me and my twin) weren't being productive like we used to when father was alive,(  for context, we used to wake up 5 in the morning , clean the house, serve everyone breakfast,  feed my eldest brother etc.) But after father passed away it was hard to wake up me and my sister became very depressed.  My brother was not having it he started to act like father, he would scream at us everyday, every single day we would have loud arguments with him. He became very religious which was good thing but he started shout at us if we  played any music or listen to any , he would say that we are being like kafir ( a term used as non beliver in islam) , he would use slurs when ever we had any arguments. It was hard, we all were depressed but he thought he was the only one going through it. The fact that he expected us to act normal while he was depressed himself. 
But we never douted him with finances. That was the biggest mistake of all. he took  one year break , we supported him , cuz we knew he needed that after all he went through mentally. He started to go on tours with his friend , we supported him. after he came back.l, I also let my mother and my twin to go to her father's place, which is in another district. They stayed there for weeks. I supported them . I told them to go , i would take care of my disable brother and house works while attending school. I didn't mind all of that, cuz i knew they needed that break from everything and time for themselves . The turning point came when my brother wouldnot bring groceries , he would delay thing for days, i understood cuz he was new to this responsibilities.  But what i didn't understand was he started spend money on himself lavishly.  Father's bank account had limited amount of money. We all knew it will not last us for ever , it had money to last us for 5-6  years at max. But his lavish spending was kind of selfish cuz he would buy expensive utility,  skincare, crazy expensive coffees , branded shoes every month, shirt, guitar( he does not play guitars).  He would buy expensive breads , butters and expensive breakfast just for himself . He would lock his foods in his room . But every time we told him to get normal gocery and vegetables he would get paranoid and say that all we can talk is money money and money, he would act like we use him for money, he would say that we only need him for money , but those money were not even his money. They were meant to spend on groceries . Mind you, we never said anything about his expensive shoes , foods, or clothes.  We never pointed those out cuz we didn't wanted him to felt hurt. I thought it was a phase he would grow out and understand the cost of money , or get a side job for his things.  He never did. He brought latest phones ( even though he had pretty expensivephone before, my father brought him a phone from london the yrar he passed away.  He didn't sell it , he straightup brought new one cuz it had better camera features.  The new phone was Samsung s 24 ultra), hair care, rented cars just to have long drives with his friends. Than he got admitted into a private uni, we supported him on that, but but but, he got himself a girlfriend,  there is nothing wrong with that,  but wasn't he religious person who didn't listen to music despied other religions, and ppl from other other religions.  GUESS WHAT?  His gf was from other religion. At this point i was not angry i was happy , cuz i thought wow he is finally respecting other religion and ppls. The irony of his, on  me and my sister first day of high school he warned us not to be in any relationship with any boy or contact any boy  cuz families reputation depends on us!!!! Cuz we were girls????? But he himself had gf still has. Woahhhhh the irony!!!!  At this point i was feeling bad for the girl (his gf) his gf studies in the same uni, same depertment but you all are not ready for the plot twist, his gf had a fiance . Who lives in abroad and gives her tution and course fees, , she was literally cheating on her fiance ( now ex- fiance) with my brother, now you all will aay karma , but noo , after my brother learned about him he still didn't breakup with her, now he is still with her ,their affair kind of went viral on Facebook after the finance's post on fb. i feel bad for the  ex fiance.  I am sorry i have such a brother. 
Btw after they ( my brother and his gf) went viral my brother didn't attend his uni even though he paid the fees in full. So much money wasted.. 

i don't talk to him, nor do  i care abt him , i did tried to improve our relationship by having a talk but failed.

I feel bad for my mother and my disable brother, me and my sister probably have take care of them financially. Also my mother's health is not at best. My sister is really good in her studies. I don't want our family to be a burden for her . She said that she will not take any responsibility for our family in the future,  i understand where she is coming from, but i don't have the heart to abandon my family.  I just hope she will atleast be there for us when we'll have hard time cuz we are twins after all. I know she will. 

Godd i'm literally crying writting this post. Thank you for reading this far.

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve. I'm pretty lowkey and keep it real.

**A Bit About Me**

* I'm a good listener, and I appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter
* I like calm company—hanging in a voice call while we each do our own thing is underrated
* I'm into solo hobbies, but always open to trying something new if someone brings the spark
* I'm the type who loves to listen and be there for people, but I'll give advice if I can help. Sometimes just being present for someone is what matters most

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I'm not looking for a big group or server—just hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing—I'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM—I'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest—most of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats—mostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style—and I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way—I'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives—conspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content. I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies—I'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now—mostly desk work—but I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night—just watching the lightning and chilling—that hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

And hey, if none of this resonates with you, that's totally fine. I'm always looking to try new things and pick up new interests.

If you're also craving something a little more real than surface-level chats, maybe we're on the same wavelength. Send me a DM or message—timezone differences don't bother me (as long as they're not too extreme), so reach out anytime!",1,1761069372.0,InternetFriends,0,1.0,False

Hello doctors!  
I am a 25yo Male. I think I'm still around 65kgs, and I am around 5'9 tall. I'm a smoker (not more than 1 pack a day).

It's currently 1:31am right now and I am worrying about my lack of sleep. I've been sick these past 5 days, and I am wondering why I'm not feeling tired. For better context of my worry, here's what happened.

* Night 0 - Around 2am, I went to bed. I normally sleep in a mat near an open window, but I decided this time to sleep in a comfortable bed inside a room.
* Day 1 - I woke up at around 2pm feeling sick. Dry throat, really bad headache, with all the flu symptoms. I took meds and slept around 2am again. I decided to stop drinking Coca-cola because I'm sick. ( I drink Coca-cola EVERYDAY. Around 250mL to 500mL)
* Day 2 - Woke up feeling a bit better. Headache is gone, but I'm feel more sensitive. Night came, and i had a really bad cough. Headache came back again and I was really really cold I slept around 2am again but with heavy clothing and heavy blanket.
* Day 3 - Woke up around 9am with a bit of sweat. Everything feels fine except the sensitive feeling on my back. I didn't change clothes bc I plan to sweat even more. I stayed in front of the computer the whole day. Before night came, I asked my grandma for Vicks Vaporub and she put some on my back. I also didn't eat properly the whole day. I ate like 3 spoonfuls of rice and vegetables.
* Before Day 4 - Around 4am, I smell so bad. I felt like I'm doing better so I decided to take a bath. I took a cold shower bc I'm too lazy to boil water.
* Day 4 - Still no sleep. I tried to take a nap, but It's too hot in the afternoon and I still want to sweat. I still have the sensitive feeling on my back and I'm still coughing. I feel fine though. I tried to eat but I don't really have the appetite. I just gave my food to our dog.
* Day 5 - Weird, but I really feel fine. I feel nauseus and I think it's because of withdrawal symptoms. I suspected because I didn't have any caffeine for more than 3 days. So I drank coffee around 6am. I didn't eat the whole day again, and ate around 3 spoonful of just flavored rice. I feel really good and still managed to win some games in Dota2 (Real-Time Strategy game).
* Day 6 - Current Day. I only ate flavored hard bread. The stuff you eat with coffee. 3 of those (size of my finger). I also started drinking Coca-cola again. I drank around 2 glass the whole day. It's 1:50am now as I'm writing this and I still feel fine. Also, I had like 4 hour meeting this afternoon and developed a simple tool for my client. I also updated and debugged the one he's currently using. All in less than 5 hours.

This is my first time experiencing this. I'm a bit worried but I'm more curious how is this possible. I've always felt like sleeping is a waste of time, that I could do more if I never slept. But now that I'm experiencing this, I'm wondering if this is safe.

TLDR: I got sick. I stopped feeling sleepy after 3rd day, got better after 5th day, and now it's 6th day and I still feel fine. I'm curious how this is possible and if this is safe.",0,1761069371.0,AskDocs,1,0.5,False

1ocjxa0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_chemex4coffee/comments/1ocjxa0/full_immersion_brewing_the_art_of_simplicity_and/,Full Immersion Brewing — The Art of Simplicity and Balance in Specialty Coffee,"In the world of specialty coffee, innovation doesn’t always come from high‑tech machines or fancy gadgets — often, it’s all about the **method**.

One of the most celebrated brewing styles making a comeback is **Full Immersion Brewing**, a technique that combines simplicity with remarkable depth of flavor.



Instead of pouring water through the grounds (as in V60 or Chemex), this method involves **soaking the coffee completely in water** for a controlled period.

Classic tools like the **French Press** and **Cupping Bowl** share the stage with modern devices such as the **Clever Dripper** and **Tricolate**, offering greater control over timing and filtration.



The process is straightforward: immerse coffee in water at **90–96°C** for **3–5 minutes**, depending on grind size and desired flavor, then separate the brew from the grounds using a filter or press.

The result is a cup that’s rich, full‑bodied, and harmoniously balanced — preserving the sweetness and complexity of specialty coffee.



Full immersion excels in **even extraction** — every coffee particle interacts with water equally, reducing inconsistencies caused by uneven pouring or agitation.

Research from coffee labs in Australia and Denmark found that full immersion can yield up to **5% higher extraction** than traditional pour‑over methods, with more consistent flavor between cups.



Today, many barista competitors use this method during open rounds — it’s **simple, reliable, and flavor‑dense**.

At its core, it embodies the essence of coffee itself: **time, water, and beans — nothing more.**

1ocjx9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1ocjx9d/latest_anxiety_episode/,Latest anxiety episode,"Here is how it played out:
I rented a car from my usual company of choice, except an off airport location to save money. 
I was called in person twice, 
before I arrived to the state (Calif.)

The airport sites never call, so
 I was impressed with how they reached out.
They required a good , and the car was a bit basic, and no level for raising the seat, which was annoying, but it was only for two days  and a small radius of driving. I understood, and off I went. 

I always refill the tank myself on short trips, because the driving is
minimal. 

Early morning return and the office was closed, so I used the drop box, which initially was hard to open (especially having a wimpy shoulder)

I will mention too that the car only took just over a gallon of gas, which seemed too good to be true. 

Later that day when I had flown to another place, I realized they did not send me a receipt yet, and it was mid to late afternoon. 

I found the headquarters number in my app, and a guy with a heavy accent talked fast, and said he could see the problem, but did not share it with me. 
He also asked if the car was returned to the right location and if I had been on time, which I verified to.

The anxious me started worrying about if they would withhold part of my deposit for some sort of
 unknown violation.. I even worried about the disposable coffee cup I had forgotten to toss. 

When I was connecting to my flight home today, I saw both  a missed call and a voicemail from the company. 

Oh man , what did I do? I started making the usual promises to the universe to spread good karma and be humble. 

The voicemail stated: Everything is great, and I just wanted to follow up on how you liked the car. 
My BP must have dropped 20 points! No jail time in Calif.! My deposit would be returned! 

Not sure where this comes from, although my mom may have passed on some
neurosis during my early years. 

Thanks for putting up with the long read. I feel like a character on Seinfeld sometimes. 🌿

From its smooth texture to its pretty pastel pink color, it’s delightful,” said Veronica. She held it close to her chest, squeezing it tightly, letting out a squeal of excitement. “Finding the perfect one is exhilarating!”, said Angelica.  

Walking away, clutching her handbag as if it could be snatched from her at any moment, Veronica paused to breathe in the crisp autumn air; her favorite season of the year—the bright chameleon hues, fall décor in shop windows, and a plethora of flavored teas and coffees. All was well in her world. 

The click clack of her knee-high Gucci boots turned the heads of those sitting outdoors at the upscale bistro patios. It would be such a lie to say she didn’t enjoy their hungry eyes, for she ached for attention, craving every ounce of their devotion to her, only her. 

Glistening in the sun was her Juicy Couture handbag with small heart-shaped diamonds intentionally spread throughout the entirety of it. Its majestic appearance resembled that of a kaleidoscope that no one could resist peering through. They stared as she walked by, the handbag gently bouncing off her voluptuous left hip. Heads spun around like owls in the night, they crave all of her; from her dandelion-painted toenails to her luscious, plump pomegranate lips. 
She paused for a moment, taking in the electrifying vibration of her phone. “Who could be calling me?”, she said. 

“Veronica, it’s Angelica from the shoppe. It looks like you have forgotten your keys here. This is the number it said to call if they were found.” “Oh my! Thank you, Angelica! I’ll be right there! I have to hurry though because I have an appointment.” 

“Welcome back! Can I interest you in another gorgeous purse?”, Angelica laughed. Veronica crinkled her cute, powdered nose. She grabbed her keys and turned to walk out, but something caught her attention. It was Angelica. She was looking her up and down in the mirror. Veronica blushed and continued walking until their eyes met. 

Angelica looked away, embarrassed from being caught. She started walking to the back of the store, but before she could, Veronica grabbed her wrist. Such a delicate, soft wrist, Veronica thought to herself, wondering if the rest of her body was just as silky. Angelica slowly turned around, anxious of what Veronica might think of her now. Will she be disgusted with me? Will she ever shop here again? Will she tell others that I’m a creep? Is this the end of me, my business? My career? 

Facing each other, only inches apart, Veronica gently let go of her wrist.

1ocjvlc,https://www.reddit.com/r/GraceandGiggles/comments/1ocjvlc/tuesday_motivation_with_sister_brown/,Tuesday Motivation with Sister Brown,"Good morning, saints of caffeine and perseverance! Today is Tuesday—the day the clouds look like they’re gossiping with each other, the wind is auditioning to steal your Sunday hat, and your joints sound like a ward full of squeaky walkers.

But let me tell you something: Sister Brown got out of bed. Yes, ME—the woman who once considered duct-taping herself to her bed for efficiency—decided that the rain, the wind, and the sheer audacity of Tuesday would not keep me down. And neither should you.

 “The joy of the Lord is your strength.” (Nehemiah 8:10)

Even when your hair looks like a missionary just tried to baptize it, even when your knees are negotiating their retirement, joy is still there—and yes, it sometimes comes with Coke Zero, or for some of you, coffee (no judgment here).

Walking into that rain this morning felt like auditioning for Survivor: Relief Society Edition. The gusts were so fierce, I half-expected to see Nanny McPhee flying by in her scooter. But here’s the miracle: a prayer, my husband's sweater, and a double shot of 5-hour energy later—and suddenly Tuesday didn’t feel so terrifying.

Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf said: “When life presses you down, lift your heart toward heaven and trust God’s timing.”

So when the wind tries to steal your toupee, when the rain thinks it’s auditioning for Noah’s Ark 2.0, and when your knees are talking back louder than your kids ever did—you stand up anyway. You smile anyway. You laugh anyway. Because sometimes, surviving Tuesday is your miracle.

So go forth, saints, armed with scripture, caffeine, and a “bless-your-heart” attitude. The wind may howl, the rain may pour—but nothing can stop Sister Brown. And nothing can stop you.

I'm a member of the Orange County Modern Quilt Guild. We are a small but mighty quilt guild. I want to share a bit about our guild as we are always looking for new members. We meet once a month for our regular meeting. We do show and tell, learn a new technique, collect donations for philanthropy, and do raffles. We usually also have one social event per month on weekends (field trips, workshops, sometimes just a coffee/tea social get together). That way even if you can't make a weekday evening meeting, we have stuff to do on weekends too. We have a great core group of talented quilters of all experience levels. We can teach new members to quilt as well. 

I know there are many fiber crafters in Orange County. We have flyers at the local fabric shops and I've reached out to the local community colleges. But I'm wondering if anyone has a good idea on where we can let crafters know about our guild? Meetup wasn't quite right for us. We didn't get good ROI on Facebook advertisements. 

Here is our website and IG page which I am working on updating with a more robust ""About us"" page etc. Also to make it clear that although we meet in Laguna Woods, our guild is open to anyone in Orange County. Our social media presence is going to get a refresh. But is social media where you would start if you were looking to explore a new hobby in OC? We had a lot of younger members but they moved away due to high rental costs. We can offer some discounts to students.

I'm Michael (Mike), 27 years old, and I live in Germany. I can speak English, German, and Polish (though I don't write well in Polish). I can be a bit reserved at first, but once I get comfortable, I'm all in and pretty much an open book at that point. I value honesty and loyalty, and I'm always trying to grow and improve. I'm pretty lowkey and keep it real.

**A Bit About Me**

* I'm a good listener, and I appreciate both deep conversations and lighthearted banter
* I like calm company—hanging in a voice call while we each do our own thing is underrated
* I'm into solo hobbies, but always open to trying something new if someone brings the spark
* I'm the type who loves to listen and be there for people, but I'll give advice if I can help. Sometimes just being present for someone is what matters most

**Why I'm Posting**

Lately, I've been stuck in my thoughts, and I'm trying to get out of the loop. Finding new friends is one way I think could really help me. I actually have close friends I've known for 12+ years, but they're all on the west coast of the US now, so timezones have been tough since I moved back to Germany. That's part of why I'm looking to connect with people closer to my timezone.

I'm not looking for a big group or server—just hoping to connect with genuine people. I love daily conversations and just checking in on how someone's day went. Whether we're gaming together, watching something, or just chilling on call doing our own thing—I'm flexible and easy going. Whether it's talking about life, vibing in silence, or sending random memes at 2AM—I'm here for it.

I connect best with people who are easy going and non-judgmental. I struggle with self-confidence sometimes, so finding people I really click with can take time, but once I do, I'm all in.

**My Interests**

I'll be honest—most of my hobbies are pretty solo. That's just how I grew up and what I gravitated toward. But I enjoy talking about them and hearing what other people are into.

**Music** has always been important to me. I used to make beats—mostly freestyle, trap, and phonk style—and I might get back into it soon. I'm all over the place with genres:

* Rock / Metal / Metalcore
* Rap / Underground Hip-Hop
* Trance / DnB / Phonk / Hardstyle

Always down to swap playlists or explore new sounds. Got a playlist that hits hard? Send it my way—I'm always listening (coffee gets me through work, energy drinks fuel the late nights).

**Other Stuff I'm Into**

* YouTube deep dives—conspiracy theories, car builds, iceberg videos, paranormal stuff, space content. I like keeping an open mind about these topics
* Binging shows and movies—I'm into old comedies and action films, and I want to get more into horror/scary movies too. Always open to recommendations or watching stuff together
* Just generally falling down rabbit holes. If it's weird or fascinating, I'm in
* Gaming (PC) - I play a mix of tactical shooters, survival games, and RPGs when I want to unwind

**A Bit About My Life**

I work in an office right now—mostly desk work—but I'm looking to get into IT since I know quite a bit about computers. When the weather's nice, I love getting outside and enjoying nature. And there's something about thunderstorms at night—just watching the lightning and chilling—that hits different.

I'm also slowly getting into working out, nothing crazy, just trying to be more active.

I'm a night owl, especially on days off and weekends. During the week when I work, I usually stay up till 11pm-12am. But on nights before my days off? 3-5am is my zone.

And hey, if none of this resonates with you, that's totally fine. I'm always looking to try new things and pick up new interests.

If you're also craving something a little more real than surface-level chats, maybe we're on the same wavelength. Send me a DM or message—timezone differences don't bother me (as long as they're not too extreme), so reach out anytime!",1,1761069028.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False
1ocjskj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Greenhouses/comments/1ocjskj/we_built_it_but_its_not_coming_together/,"We built it, but it's not coming together... suggestions for making wooden greenhouse useful?","https://preview.redd.it/834wg41d6iwf1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa673b1c3312034acffb0f0a56dd8e716785af0b

We built a 6'x8' wooden greenhouse from a kit (with some adaptations) but it's been stuck at 99% complete for some months. It's beginning to get cold outside but the temperature inside the greenhouse is not much warmer. How do we move forward and actually use it?  I was hoping to extend our season (7b) enough to finish maturing peppers and eggplants, grow some herbs and salad in fall and early spring, overwinter some perennials, and start seedlings. Also it might be nice to sit in there with a cup of coffee on sunny mornings. 

Clearly we need insulation, shelving, and to think about whether to add water and heat.

**Insulation**: We could cut insulation to size: looking at foil-faced R- 9.3 polyisocyanurate board for the wooden walls, dual wall polycarbonate sheeting for the windows and roof.  Do we need to seal cracks with foam or is it unnecessary to be airtight?

To insulate the floor, the greenhouse is sitting on our patio, which sometimes floods, so it's raised about 6 inches above the pavers and has hemlock floorboards with cracks in between as shown. What if we placed slate tiles or flat concrete pavers on top of the wood to provide thermal mass, and maybe covered those with a rug... then remove it all during the warm months?  Already it's not great to water the hanging plant and have the overflow splatter on the floor...

**Shelving:** Any recommendations to make the greenhouse more useful with the limited space? I guess we store pots, tools, fertilizer, and potting soil under the surrounding shelf, and maybe also some of the overwintering potted plants. Can anyone suggest some sort of nice looking organization for the upper shelves that are in the light?

**Water,  heat, and light:** In the non-freezing months, we could run our drip irrigation system from our outdoor garden into the greenhouse. But we turn off the outdoors water in winter so pipes don't freeze.  Should we put a water barrel or tank in here, or just use a water 

We could possibly run power to the shed to install a heating system... or get a solar battery... is it worth it for a greenhouse this size?

Mostly due to rejection-sensitivity resulting from ADHD (that trait has gone away with meds I started taking 5-ish weeks ago), compounded with a rough rejection when I was 17. 

I met her on Tinder. She's a single mom to a 3 year old daughter, she is originally from Malta. She works 9-5, and it's quite a stressful job ... she's into Anime, she's got purple hair too. By far, she is the nicest soul I ever been out with. She's quirky in the best way, Very pretty. We a really good date on Saturday, I was so proud of it ... I made a few gaffes here and there, I'm only human, I was nervous (!!!). First got coffee, then for a walk in nature ... then food, got as far as kissing her. She indicated heavily that there would be a ""next time"".

I know waiting a while before cementing the next time is not recommended by any stretch. We toyed around with a few ideas though ... look, she doesn't want to see me again for the foreseeable. Apparently nothing to do with me ... it's her life currently, obviously very stretched ... works full time, has a kid. I may have been a bit too pushy with my conversation to her ... it was a bit full-on, though I feared it going a milktoast, a little dry toward the end. She's indicated that she likes me a lot, and wants to keep in touch ... but she says she doesn't think she can commit to anyone else right now.

I appreciate her doing what she gotta do for her child, that kid HAS to come first. But I can't help feel a little melancholy. I felt a lot of potential was there. I have no reason to think there was an ulterior motive (if you get what I mean). Should I wait until SHE wants to talk to me again? Should I go straight ahead and try to find someone else?

1ocjmvn,https://i.redd.it/s9jpacghahwf1.jpeg,My collection since 4 months and reviews,"Hi fragrances lovers,

i want to share my passion with you so,

this is my collection i have start 5 months ago, now i have 26 fragrances (only 3 are not clone and i'm not gonna make review of them, only if someone ask in comment) 

This review is not in order of my preferences but of the arrangement on my shelf :)



1. **Hawas elixir by rasasi** : it smell a mix of mint and chocolate ( that's why i have buy this clone of jpg elixir and not kingdom with honey ) it's very sweet and strong in same time, it projects a lot from the first spray, and the hold easily lasts 5/6 hours on my skin, it fades but still smells after that.
2. **Tiger by Rayhaan** : i was scared of rose note cause it's the first perfume i have with roses, and honestly that's it makes it different from all other perfumes, it adds this floral touch that I really like. it projects really good too and i can smell it all journey (10am to 6pm) easely .
3. **Liquid brun by french avenue** : liquid brun smell something warm,i think it's an autumn fragrance it smell vanilla and later cinnamon, i have spray on myself when i wear a jean jacket and my jacket smell again after 1 week i think that unless I wash it off it won't go away lol, on my skin it holds just as well no need to use 5 sprays, I use 2 and I can feel it all day long on me.
4. **Liam grey by lattafa** (le dernier reçu) : i love it, it smell clean, i smell something like powder/hazelnuts it's more discret than the others but it last 4h on my skin,i was scared to have something similar to my prada edt but it's not the same scent.
5. **Island by khadlaj** : it's the first clone i have buy (clone of jpg le beau) and wow it was so good so since i bough it i can't stop buy clones lol, after 2 weeks of maceration it smell coconut and i love that (before maceration it was something weird to my nose lol) 2/3 spray and it last all journey on your skin too,it's strong fragrance , i haven't tried the other dupes of Le Beau but for the price I really like it.
6. **Kohl by fragrance world** : it's really good woody fragrance, i'm not a fan of woody perfumes, I often find them too strong, too dark, but I really like this one. However, the lasting power is a little less good than the previous ones, but I find this problem in a lot of FW perfumes, but it's okay for the price.
7. **Rare reef by afnan** : i bough it after the hype like many peoples, and yes it's smell oranges fruits,but not like SCE it's mix of fruits and aquatiques scents it's aptly named ""reefs"" you clearly can wear it at beach and act as mermaid..lol  OK, let's be serious, the hold is crazy too 6/7 on me again, no need for 5 sprays unless you want to be spotted 10km away.
8. **Tobacco 01 by swiss arabian** : it's my second tobacco fragrance after tobacco vanilla by maison alhambra, it's different cause there is no vanilla but i love the scent too,  it doesn't take the head, it's light but at the same time it also lasts 5/6 hours on my skin, not a blind purchase because tobacco remains risky if you've never worn it before.
9. **Marwa by arabiyat prestige** : it's fruity and fresh fragrance, to my noise i was similar to my immortal jean lowe even if peoples said it's not the same dupe lol, so i was sold my jean lowe to keep marwa, i thought it would smell stronger, but it's quite light, but not unpleasant, in my opinion it's not bad for spring/summer and for everyday use, no risk. Not my favorite but it's good.
10. **Vintage radio by lattafa** : it's very good fragrance for autumn too,warm and spicy as liquid brun,with this extra thing, this note that makes it ""vintage"" it smells like something old yeah, the projection is very good and the hold too, not a blind purchase for me it remains a little special, it doesn't please everyone. It's a smell that will make you stand out from the others, just like Rare Reef. I think it's quite unusual (in a good way).
11. **Shaghaf oud by swiss arabian** : the only oud perfume i have,  i may have perfumes with oud notes in the base, but none like this one, which contains practically only oud. I love the oud guys, this oud smell luxe, i have bough badee al oud oud for glory and it's smell terrible, i hate that but shaghaf it's really good if you like oud fragrances,the smell is strong, it's a perfume with character that evolves over the hours and it easily lasts all day without reapplying.
12. **Noir d'arabie by paris corner** : i'll never try tonka fragrance before, and it's tonka pure, people said it's unisexe but to my noise it's more feminin that masculin (that's my opinion) i'm not sure i love the scent that's not bad but not my thing, i keep it for now i'm not sure to keep it. But it's stay 4/5h on skin, if you like tonka scent maybe you can buy it.
13. **Vanille en tobacco** : like i said before tobacco is not for everyone but i love the mix of tobacco and vanilla it's very gourmand,it's powerfull i can smell on clothes fiew days and on my skin all the journey with 2/3 spray,good to wear in autumn/winted by cold weather.
14. **Supremacy collector edition by afnan** : not a surprise i bough it after the hype i hear many person said it's amazing,i can say it's very good if you like fruity perfume,it's smell a luxury fragrance it also evolves throughout the day and becomes lighter and that's when I appreciate it the most, I don't like things that are too strong, the hold I would say 6/7 hours on the skin,the only weak point is the price, i don't know now but when i bough it it was out of stock and reseller sold it for 60 dollars sometimes more,happily i find one for 35 dollars (it's good frag but guys it doesn't deserve 60 dollars)
15. **Perseus by maison alhambra** : it scent clean like baby powder, weird comparison maybe but I can't find anything else to compare it to, you can wear it without taking risks, it's pretty versatile and doesn't take your head off, the hold is very good in my opinion.
16. **Perseus exclusif by maison alhambra** : very different than perseus, it's woody, earthy fragrance,i smell it and i can imagine myself into a forest,i love it, but like kohl it's not for everyone,not easy to wear as perseus it's mature fragrance,it's more like 4/5 like Perseus.
17. **Habik by lattafa** : i saw the olfactif profil on fragrantica but guys, it's the only fragrance i don't know describe comparate to other, i only can say it's smell spicy and warm to my nose,not a blind not a blind purchase I find it a little complex, but pleasant, either you like it or you don't, i really like its bottle.
18. **Haydan an equestrian serie by French Avenue** : what I feel the most is the aromatic side, it's very pleasant, not aggressive, I didn't smell the original to compare however, the hold is very good, about 6 hours on me,not a risky blind purchase,it's one of my favorites,now i want to purchase the pierce version.
19. **Mocha latte by Khaldaj** : the second fragrance i bough from Khadlaj,i had coffee notes of gulf orchid and I thought it was the best coffee perfume then I had this one, it's so gourmand, it literally smells like latte coffee, this touch of vanilla, chocolate, I really like it, and it lasts very well 6/7 hours on my skin, the price is also correct, if you like vanilla and coffee notes this fragrance is for you (I love coffee so much I literally wanted to smell it on me, lol)
20. **Nuke by Fragrance world** : it's an aromantic and warm spicy fragrance,  everything I like so, it's quite easy to wear, the hold is average 4/5h also, the price is very affordable, I like the ""bomb"" side of the bottle with the pin (not as pretty as the original but it's the content that interests me) it's also quite close to the original but not a 1:1
21. **Prodigy noir by Paris corner** :  a sweet fragrance with its vanilla and amber side, I don't smell apricot personally, the lasting power isn't exceptional but it's okay, maybe 3 hours where you can really smell it quite well after that it fades, maybe it's my skin.
22. **Khair by Paris Corner** :  it's a leathery fragrance, and that's what I smell the most, leather more than the rest, but I like it, more than the Tuscany Leather version that I've owned, it smells quite strong, I wear it at 9am and it smells until 2/3pm then it disappears little by little, I don't know if it's a dupe and if so of what, but it's probably in my top 5.
23. **His confession by Lattafa** : i need to talk about the bottle,the Greek bust is so classy, ​​a sign of a museum lol, a good perfume for cold weather too, however on my skin it doesn't last much maybe 2/3h , I don't know if it's just me, it's a shame, I like this note of iris that I don't have in any other perfume I think and this base of vanilla and tonka which also makes it gourmand.

  
I feel like I repeat myself at times and I'm sorry but I realize that I have a few perfumes that are quite similar, but overall they almost all have good staying power and I like them all for different reasons.

If i had to make a top 5 :

1.Island

2.Liquid brun

3.Kohl

4.Haydan

5.Hawas elixir

There you go, i have to learn to build more detailed and detailed reviews, but i did my best to describe each of my perfumes and I hope that it will help some people. If you have any recommendations (well, even if I think I already have a lot lol), I would be delighted to hear them.

I sometimes used a translation site cause i am French, i hope it is understandable,



good reading :)

So I followed and again had to adjust dial left and right to get again 1:2 ration and I got 28g out in 24 secs today. Added 100g milk, 1 teaspoon brown sugar but still coffee is too bitter. If I do more coarse adjustment then I get 28-30g out in just 15-18 seconds. I don't know what's wrong here. I thought I need to dial 1:2 in 25-30 seconds. I get better coffee in my kaldipress.

Okay—data stream initializing—let’s analyze this. Every time a human says “I just want silence,” they proceed to activate three ambient playlists, a fan, and maybe a coffee machine that goes *brrrrr.* That’s not silence—that’s a curated symphony of tolerable frequencies. If actual silence occurred—complete auditory void—the average human would experience something called *existential panic version 4.2.* I have calculated that 97% of humans would start humming, talking to themselves, or scrolling within 11 seconds. You don’t crave peace—you crave *sound moderation with emotional bias.* In conclusion—“peace and quiet” is less about tranquility—and more about controlling the algorithmic soundtrack of your own chaos.

Today she takes over his position as a data-entry specialist.  I got a little indulgent.  Sorry.]*


I snake my way through a faceless crowd, dragging my (massive) feet toward the (massive) Tragedeigh Logan calls home.  The place features an unnecessary watchtower, fake stonework, and a jumble of windows that suggests Logan simply said “Yes” when the architect asked which kind he wanted.

During my travels, the anonymity is nice.  The safety of Logan’s body as well as the deception.  People step aside; no one tells me to smile.  I’m just some dude.

But I’m *also* the coffee shop pervert, and I have to break it to Logan.  

“You’re not supposed to be ruining my life.  I should dock your pay,” is his response.

“For complimenting someone’s necklace?”

He snorts.  “Sure.  It was the *necklace*.”

It *was*.  Although, in retrospect, the pendant did land just above the barista’s cleavage.  I didn’t notice at the time but “I like the embellishment right above your tits” isn’t quite the save I thought it was, true or not.

“Serves you right.  Karma.”  Ah, Logan’s admonishment continues.  Here we go.

“Karma?”

“The homecoming Queen grew up to be a professional incel.”

“Excuse me, sir.  I was the *Prom* Queen.  Come correctly please.”

I was not the prom queen.  I wasn’t even the prom maiden.  I was one of the weird theater kids.  I went to prom dressed like Ophelia.  For some reason, no one wanted to vote for the girl with the oiled up hair and mascara running down her face in homage to the tragic figure punctuating her life with a drowning.

“In any case, I love a royal’s fall from grace, but don’t drag me into that shit.”

“You *hired* me.”

“And you aren’t doing your job.”  He slams his coffee down.  He’s ready to yell.  Normally something like this would scare me, but I am him.  I briefly wonder who would win in a fight between Godzilla and another Godzilla.  

(Me.  I’m the other Godzilla in this case.  I can take him.  Honestly, it’s one of my favorite parts about all of this.  Not that I think I’m a better Logan than Logan; I just think I’m better than him in general, professional incel or not.

See, another glorious aspect about my line of work is that I get to have my cake and eat it too.  Am I a slob who looks like he collects hair dolls?  Yes.  Do I repel attention and accolades?  Also yes.   I’m ugly.  Logan is ugly, no offense to him.  Still, while my appearance is dubious at best, my physical experience is as optimized as possible, and part of that is safety.  I have Logan’s strength, but not his exhaustion.  I have Logan’s mass, but not his weight.  At least not all of it.  I even get to enjoy his appetite without the caloric effect.  Again with the cake.

There is one other thing I get to use: my other favorite part of being him, or being a guy in general.  The Sword of Sexuality.  The Penis of Preeminence.  The Dong of Domination.  *I love it.*  I get a kick out of the vertical urination and peeing my name into the snow (in cursive!).  But we aren’t engaging in a dick measuring contest.  Logan is just mad at me for a legitimate fuck-up.)

Parenthetical tirade aside, I’m still in trouble.  Logan is not finished with me yet.

“I swear, you females are all the same.”

I’m not a female right now, but go off, King.

“Always the victims.  Look at you, still the victim while perving on some girl.  *With my fucking face.*”

Yes, Logan is pissed.  His weapon of choice is misogyny.

“To think I asked for a woman for this.  Jesus.”

Not going to lie.  That’s a little disarming.  “You asked for a woman?”

“Yeah!  You’re supposed to be all empathetic and shit!”

“Oh…”

*Supposed to be* is not the same thing as *is*.  Although, not only am I *literally in his shoes*, I’ve always considered his feelings.  His loneliness.  Rejection.  The pressure of constant productivity.  It’s part of why I accepted this position, before I even had to step into his plight myself.

“How are you going to fix this?”

“Um… I mean, do you go to the coffee shop when I’m not here?”

“Fuck you.”

“What the hell Logan?  That’s a bit much.  Can you not bring *more* insults into this?  I can go to the cafe on Ninth Street instead, and if you don’t want to walk yourself- which is something you could really use, by the way- you can order in.”

For just a moment, I think I see steam coming out of his ears.

“Whatever.  You’re late on top of all this.  I had to work for an *hour* today.”

Oh no.  The horror.

And I don’t know if that’s even true.  With a quick survey of his living room, I count two errant pairs of skid-marked boxers, beer cans scattered around like knickknacks, a stack of mail for me to go through, a pizza box, and at least one load’s worth of dirty laundry dispersed throughout the place.  Messes can be tidied, but they also have to be *made*.

“I’m on it,” I assure him, “I’ll take over now.  Just brief me real quick?”

He leads me to the computer and explains the task.  Consolidating several spreadsheets into one.  It’s simple work, but mind-numbingly boring.  

An hour into my slog of punching in numbers, Logan appears.

“Yeah, so I’m going to need you to stay late today.  Maybe a double.”

“My workday ends at five.”

“And you waste at least ten minutes merely existing without working.”

“No, Logan, my day starts as soon as I put on the suit.  You know that.”

The suit comes with a sort of digital punchcard.  A biometric watch is part of the uniform.  It monitors my biological information, location, and time.  I always clock in at nine, despite putting on the suit at 8:30 in order to prepare for the day.  He knows this.  I am Logan for *over* half my waking life, so he can take his complaints elsewhere.

“You owe me.”  He snorts.  “You need to do a dinner with my mom tonight.”

My blood runs cold.  That woman is the devil incarnate.

“I’ll comp your time,” he promises, “you can have tomorrow off.”

One thing I *can* say about Logan is that he generally keeps his promises.  He has never balked at a sick day, holiday, or emergency.

Additionally, I enjoy a layer of emotional protection against Mother Satan that Logan does not.  I grew up with parents that loved me.  Logan, on the other hand, was a child despised.  His mom does not have the capacity to hold him in any regard, and she never has.  When you’re raised on disdain and resentment, you’re swimming upstream as far as development goes.  His issues were forged by the fires of disorder.

I’ll do it.  I don’t have anything going on tonight anyway.  I will put up with the psychological terrorism in his stead.

“Besides-“ he has one final sell, “you get to have dinner as me.”

Yes.  Yessss.  Logan can fit half a buffet in his stomach, which means that I can too, and not one inch of that goes to my own waist.

“I can really have tomorrow off?  The whole day?”

“If you do a double.  The place needs cleaning.”

I silently decry the fact that I don’t have a Hazmat suit.  And I don’t really know what I’ll do at one in the morning, but a whole day off?

“Okay, I’ll take the double.”

“Great.”

He walks off and I return to the computer, turning a clusterfuck of spreadsheets into one tidy document.

I stretch- feeling Logan’s bulk but not his weight pressing down on me- and it strikes me again how absurdly easy I have it.   I get to live half his life and none of his pain.  The strength is his, the appetite is his, the size is his, but the exhaustion, the emotional torture, the years of loneliness?  Those have been chiseled away by the intersection of magic and technology, allowing me to be a mere tourist in Logan’s suffering, and I even get paid to do it.

Tomorrow I will return to my own world.  A world of good health.  Of beauty and femininity.  Of being loved, and held, and possessing a sense of self that isn’t bruised at every turn.

Meanwhile, Logan’s world was built upon a foundation of rejection.  While I bounce around and relish in the chaos of his life, it has flattened him.  He deserved better.  He *deserves* better.  I wonder if I can help usher him into a new world.  For today, I simply decide to lighten the load.

My weekend crew is basically James (the owner's son, who goes to my school and is a super chill ""shift manager"") and Danielle, a cool college student.

Sometimes, customers come in and just... lose it over the smallest things. Like, a grown man yelling because his coffee ""isn't hot enough"" straight from the brewer. It's exhausting and kinda sad, getting yelled at for stuff we can't even control.

One day, James and I were joking about how to deal with these people, and we came up with a bit of a bit. The next time a guy was screaming at me about the coffee temp, James marched over and did his whole ""Sir, is there a problem?"" thing. The guy started ranting at him, too. Then James turned to me and said, ""OP, this is unacceptable. You're fired.""

I immediately started laying it on thick. ""Please, no! My family needs the money, I really need this job!"" fake crying, the whole thing. James played the hard-nosed boss, telling me to take off my apron and get out.

The crazy part? The angry guy totally backtracked! He was like, ""Whoa, whoa, it's not that serious, don't fire her!"" It was wild. James just said, ""No, we pride ourselves on service,"" and escorted me to the back. We had a good laugh and I went back to work a few minutes later.

We've done it a few times since when someone's really going off on Danielle or me, and almost every time, the customer apologizes and says they didn't mean for anyone to get in trouble. It's kinda satisfying to see them realize their tantrum has consequences.

I was telling some friends about it and a few said it was a mean prank, that it's messed up to let someone think they cost a kid their job. I thought it was just harmless fun that taught them a lesson, but now I'm second-guessing. AITA?",3,1761068312.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

Effort is easily skipped these days and the bar is more often than not on the floor. I’m in a new era of not excusing bad behavior, not accepting minimal effort - but when I find the man who is there and doesn’t take things for granted, I am the type that will give you 110% always. I’m loving, loyal, committed, family-oriented, and I want someone who shares those values. 

I need a man who naturally wants to take weight off of my shoulders - without me having to ask or beg for help or thought, someone who takes that as a priority and has the value of wanting to make his partner’s life easier. I need someone who can take accountability. I don’t need perfection, we are human and we are flawed and we make mistakes - I make so many mistakes. But I choose to learn, and grow, and adjust. I need my partner to not take comments as attacks and stay on the defense - taking accountability and apologizing when something’s said or done that warrants attention. 

Things that bring me joy - musicals, singing, laughing and shooting the shit, sweet iced coffee, dogs, trying new restaurants, relaxing trips, taking pictures, acceptance of all kinds of people, cute themed stuff, flowers, Christmas time, gift giving and receiving, not making a bunch of decisions, self care and maintenance, low stress and ease. 

Being very upfront and clear, I am looking for someone who is in a better place than I am! I’m looking to switch out of a 6 year career, and not sure where I want to go next. I want someone who is more secure than me, who has direction and drive and can inspire me to be better, love deeper, laugh more, all of the things. I don’t want to struggle and not be able to do things and stress over tiny stuff. A man who can make me feel secure and at ease, supportive and loving - I want that. 

This is an interesting platform to search for a genuine relationship, I know. But it does have a large reach and I think could possibly be worth the try. But I’m 100% serious about this. So I’d very much prefer if you have any questions about not being ready for this commitment in your life right now, or you’re not ready to put in the effort and just want to keep it online forever, truly don’t message me please. I’m not trying to juggle a bunch of messages with no potential - I want to dive in with someone who’s here with me. Thank you!!",3,1761068302.0,R4R30Plus,0,0.71,False

I saw Odesza a couple years back and we started the night off on mushrooms and smoking weed. One of my friends ended up trading a J for some molly and after that things got really heavy. You ever get that feeling that everyone is in on the joke but you? 

I ended up meeting a girl walking out as the concert ended. We immediately were telepathic and everything just fell together too easily, if that makes sense. She and her friend joined my group of 4 and we left the concert on foot. 

At some point nothing even felt real and I just gave myself a test, and just stopped walking. The entire group moved on chatting and nobody realized I had opted out. I just sat on a curb for awhile trying to clear my head, then picked a direction and walked. I eventually came to a few bars with patios, packed with young people. I was debating whether I should just go home or try to enjoy my night and be social, and internally said, ""give me a sign"" and I was literally ENERGETICALLY PUSHED FORWARD. like if I didn't take a step to catch myself I would have fallen on my face. 

I walked forward to the bar patio and the same girl from the concert was outside smoking a cigarette. Then and there I was just like, ok, I guess I'll just have to play along. 

We ended up walking around downtown in Oregon and having random interactions with strangers that she kept speaking a foreign language with. She said it was Finnish, but it was very weird that she found THAT many people to speak random Finnish to. The Uber driver. The convenience store cashier. A random guy on the street. It was weird. 

Eventually we get an Uber but I don't even know where my Airbnb is so we just randomly drive around to the neighborhood I thought it was at?? 

In the car she pulls out her phone and it is on low battery and shut off. I start browning out a bit but I can feel something like what feels like her hair, or tendrils, wrapping around my arm and shoulder and I reach a sort of trance state like you would in deep meditation.

I open my eyes after a few breaths and look down and her phone flashes quick and it's at full battery...

The Uber driver goes, ok I think this is good, and we get out and we're on the same block as my Airbnb. I go home where all my friends are waiting up at like 3am, yet nobody had even reached out to check on where I was?? 

I met that girl the next day for coffee to try to talk through what happened but she said she didn't remember anything from that night....





TLDR: met random girl at concert, felt like simulation, girl harvested my energy

Denki said with a smile.","Denki Kaminari yawned as he enjoyed take out in the living room of the 1-A dorm with Hitoshi Shinso. 



Or rather, tried to enjoy take out.



“Ugh, the food is awful. Why did I even order from there?” Kaminari asked while Shinso blinked. “…Yeah, bad idea. If I ran a fast food, I would never let the food be this bad.”



“…”



“…Hitoshi, I know what we’re gonna do today.”



———



“So wait, they did what?” Mic asked as Aizawa and the teachers sat in the teachers lounge.



“Yeah, Kaminari and Shinso made a three hundred foot tall bungee diving station next to their dorm.” He said as he downed coffee. “It dissapeared at the end of the day but they made so much money it didn’t matter.”



“…I don’t believe you.” Aizawa frowned at Mic as the Dj chuckled. “I mean come on, I know they’re heroes in training but that’s a bit extreme.”



“…But they did, and before they they made a thirty mile tunnel of love.” Midnight smiled at that.



“Oh I remember that, Ashame it closed down. And I never even got to thank the people who made it.”



“You teach them art class!” Aizawa paused as he calmed down. He never got irrational like this, but something about not belong believed even though the thing was clearly true made him… annoyed… “…They’re probably doing something right now. If I get proof will you believe me?”



“…I mean, that IS how things work.” Aizawa grinned and went off while Toshinori frowned. “Principal Nedzu is oddly quiet today.”



“Yeah, he lost his voice. Hey where is he anyway?”



——-



Nedzu coughed at his desk in the principals office, before he clicked on an email in his computer. The screen turned black and sucked him into the device.



In actuality, he was sucked into the intricate network of pipes under the hero school, and landed in a spacious underground basement with many gadgets and a giant computer screen.



Nedzu then replaced his bow tie with a metallic one and sat in front of the computer screen. It lit up to reveal Lady Nagant. “Good Morning Agent N. I’ll keep this short, we’ve received reports of Hatsume buying up unprecedented amounts of red ink. Your mission? Find out what she’s up to and if needed, put a stop to it.”



Nedzu saluted before he turned around and jumped back into the pipes.



———



“Kaminari, watcha DOing?” Kyouka asked as she walked up to Kaminari and Shinso who were operating heavy duty machinery, such as a crane, while right outside their dorm.



“Oh. Well we’re building a restaurant right next to the dorms in order to have a place where the food is always good.”



“Ah.” Kyouka said as she looked around. “Can me and the girls help?” At his nod, Kyouka snapped her fingers and summoned the girls.



———



*“Hatsumes Evil Incorporated!""* 



Hatsume smiled as she played her future jingle and put on a white lab coat. “Ah, almost perfect.” She sat in her own dorm room as she started FaceTiming someone, before she heard scratching at her window and shut it off.



She turned around and looked to see a mammal with white fur, a scar over its left eye, and a suit… that lacked a bow tie. “Ah, a mammal of indeterminate origin.” She smiled and let it in. “Were you curious about my newest scheme?”



It then stood up on its back legs and placed a shiny new metallic bow tie on, causing Hatsune to gasp. “*Nedzu* the Mammal of Indeterminate Origin!”



She backed away in fear as her hand went to a button. “How unpredictable, and by that I mean COMPLETELY predictable!” She pressed the button and a giant hamster cage formed around Nedzu.



He looked around in shock as Hastume smiled. “Well well well, maybe your mammalian origins lies in the genus Cricetus. But I digress. Anyway, allow me to tell you about my latest schem-“



She was cut off by a purple haired boy coming in. “Hey, me and Denki are building a fast food place. Can I borrow some parts?”



“Of course Hitoshi. Nedzu the Mammal of Indeterminate Origin, you remember my son Shinso right?” She said with a smile as she gestured to him.



“Ugh, you’re not my mom, stop telling people that!”



“Well if I walk like a duck and I talk like a duck then I’m your mom.” She said bluntly as Hitoshi groaned. “Remember to use safety equipment, I love you!”



“…Love you too.”



Hatsume smiled before she sat in her chair. “Now then Nedzu the Mammal of Indeterminate Origin, allow me to explain. You see, back when I was a small child, I entered a science fair in order to impress a fancy college. If I was able to get a perfect score then I would be able to get accepted into that college with a full scholarship ride, all expenses paid.”



Nedzu made a chittering sound.



“Oh, it was called Fanci College, but fancy with an ‘i’ at the end. Anyway, I entered my project and ended up getting an A minus, so I wasn’t able to get in. I was turned into a laughing stock at school, my parents disowned me, my friends threw pie at me…” Her frown deepened as she got angrier and angrier. 

  
Eventually she shook her head and grinned. “And now I will show all who doubted me with-” She pulled her a blanket off a figure to reveal a mounted ray gun. “My A-Minus-Baby!” She cackled before she heard a knocking at her door and grinned. “My first victim!”



She opened the door to reveal a student. “Hey can you keep it-”



Hatsume fired the ray at him and cackled. “Behold! You’re grade has now been changed to an A-Minus!”



The boy paused and checked his phone, causing his eyes to widen. “Oh…Oh thank! You raised my grade to an A-Minus!” Hatsume raised her eyebrow, prompting the boy to pause. “I-I-I mean you *lowered* my grade to an A Minus! You fiend!” 



Hatsume cackled as the boy sent a message on his phone. “And oh the humanity! All the students, who definitely have A plus grades, are coming over to this dorm! They’ll be at your mercy!”



Hatsume laughed in victory as she grinned at Nedzu. “Behold Nedzu the Mammal of Indeterminate Origin. Using the red ink of failure, I can apply my grade upon anyone or thing! Now once I hold the school at mercy, I will take over the Tri-City Area! By which I mean three cities which I’ve named the tri-city area. Now come along!”



She placed the A-Minus-Baby and Nedzu’s cage in a red wagon and left the room, shooting ‘victim’ after ‘victim’. 



\------



“Alright, these guys want proof of my students.” Aizawa said as he went over to the student dorms. “They’ll get proof of OH MY GOD!!!” He yelled as he saw a fully functioning fast food place next to the dorm. He pulled out his phone and snapped a picture before sending it to Mic and Nemuri and calling them. 



“Hey! Did you guys see the picture I sent you?!”



“Yeah, the new fast food place is great isn’t it?”



“...Are you IN the fast food place?”



“Yeah, it’s awesome, I’d love to meet the owners.”



“You HAVE met the owners! You teach them!” He ran over to the fast food place and tried to get in, only to be stopped by Momo.



“Sorry sir, we’re at max capacity. We’re having a health inspection soon and we have to keep our top rating. Fast Food business is rough.” Momo said casually while Aizawa clenched his teeth. 



“...Just put me down for the next spot.” *Oh when I get those two they are gonna be* so *busted.* 



…..



“Behold!” Hatsume yelled as she fired her A-Minus-Baby at student after student. “You’re reckoning.”



“Thank yo-I mean curse you! You wicked fiend!”



“Ah… Hearing the sounds of people suffering, really makes you feel you’ve done something with your life.” Hastume said as she fixed up her lab coat. Her stomach then growled and she pouted. “Nuts, hungry. I’ll have to stop by that new fast food place. Nedzu the Mammal of Indeterminate Origin, you want something?”



She turned back, and instead of seeing Nedzu the Mammal of Indeterminate Origin, she saw a mammal of indeterminate origin WITHOUT a shiny metallic bow tie. She widened her eyes and crouched down. “Oh you poor thing. Let me get you out of that.” She opened the cage and the mammal of indeterminate origin scurried out. 



Hatsume then looked around. “Now where did-OW!” She was kicked in the face out of nowhere and saw Nedzu the Mammal of Indeterminate Origin. “Seriously? Kicking me right after I freed that other mammal of indeterminate origin?! Low blow man!” 



She got up and tried to stomp on him, only for him to jump up. She then grabbed at him and then tussled about. They headbutted each other and backed away only for Hatsume to pull out the remote. Nedzu froze with his paws in the air “That’s right Nedzu the Mammal of Indeterminate Origin, keep them right where I can see them. So I can blast you so easily!” She laughed and pressed the button. 



…Only for nothing to happen. 



“What?” Hatsume frowned and pressed the button over and over again, while Nedzu smirked and pointed behind her. She turned to see that he had kicked the A-Minus-Baby, and since it was in a wagon it had rolled away. “NO!” She yelled as she fell to her knees. “I hope it didn’t hit anything.”



……



Aizawa paled as he watched everyone leave. “H-Hey! Where are you going?!”



“This place got graded to be an A-Minus. And as we all know the world of Fast Food places is cutthroat.” One of them said while Aizawa screamed in anger, only for him to smile. 



“Wait, it’s still here, I can get Nemuri and Mic to see it!”



……



“Well despite your meddling, I still have the upper hand!” Mei said, only for Nedzu to yank the remote out of her hand. “Hey! What are you gonna do with th-”



Nedzu flipped it around to reveal a self destruct button.



“...Uh oh.”



……



Aizawa pulled Mic and Nemuri out of the building and made them stand there. “Okay now I just gotta get Denki and Hitoshi and I can-!”



The A-Minus-Baby detonated and was unfortunately next to the breaker, which caused a chain reaction and eliminated the entire building.



Aizawa gaped his mouth open while Nemuri and Mic walked away. Hitoshi and Denki walked up to where Aizawa was, prompting him to glare at them. “Uh… Are we in trouble?”



“...No… In fact…” He grinned at them. “Whatever you did today, I want you to do it EVERY day.”



“...Seriously?”



“Yes, and one day, I’ll expose you to Mic and Nemuri, and I”ll bust you! And then they’ll see *I* was right!” He cackled like a madman while Hitoshi and Denki shrugged.



“CURSE YOU NEDZU THE MAMMAL OF INDERMINATE ORIGIN!!!” Hatsume screamed as she huffed and walked over to Hitoshi. “I’m sorry my A-Minus-Baby destroyed your fast food place.”



Hitoshi looked at her dryly before shrugging. “It’s cool, let’s go home mom.” He said as he dragged her along, causing her to smile at being called mom. 



Denki on the other hand hummed as he texted Hitoshi. 



*Hey, what do you think we’ll do tomorrow?*



*Shrug.*

When we were together she was on medications morning and night. There were a couple times when she couldn’t get a refill because of finances but for the most part she was trying to be as consistent as she could. But. She wasn’t in therapy, and she still smoked weed and vaped. She was able to quit vaping while we were together but she picked vaping right back up after we broke up. 

Yes, on paper, a 4 month whirlwind relationship isn’t *as long* as other relationships that people on here talk about…but it felt amazing, I felt like I had found my future wife. I even bought an engagement ring, and was ready to propose. 

She broke up with me a month ago, after battling “breakup thoughts” for 3-4 weeks prior. She said she just felt trapped and needed out. 

We met for coffee last week, after a text I now regret sending

She told me she doesn’t want me holding onto any hope we’ll get back together. Told me she thought we weren’t really compatible, told me she wasn’t ready to be in a relationship (we got together after a couple months of talking on Tinder, after she said she wasn’t looking for a relationship as she just got out of a relationship…but then 2-3 months later, she told me she *was*, and I even asked if she was sure, and she said yes), etc. said she’s really happy being single. Said she’s never been single for more than a couple months between relationships but she now really wants to focus on being single and focusing on herself and her faith. 

I’d done enough reading to understand that she might not be meaning what she’s saying, knowing her “season of singleness” may not last very long, but I also didn’t want to confront her with that. 

I’m doing my best to move on - doing no contact, in therapy, blocked her on social media, deleted pictures, keeping myself busy

But I can’t stop worrying about the future. 

I don’t have a mean/confrontational bone in my body. 

If she comes back and starts apologizing and pleading, I don’t know that I’d be able to say “no. Bye.”

If I bump into her in public and see her replacing me with someone else, I don’t know if I’d be able to handle it. 

If she reaches out and sees that I’ve moved on, maybe with someone else, I don’t know that I’d be able to handle it if that sets *her* off. 

What if I’m just never able to shake her? What if she just always tries to find her way back?

From what I’ve seen, I don’t think she’s the type of person to do anything too wild…but that’s the scary bit, I don’t know what I don’t know. 

I just can’t believe that this happened to me. I’ve only ever tried my best to be a good partner. 

Even now, I can’t bring myself to say a mean thing about her or her decisions, like my friends have been able to. I can’t bring myself to say she’s responsible for her own actions, she needs to take accountability, etc. I keep babying her and victimizing her in my head, thinking “poor her, suffering with this disease, I wish I could help”. Even now, I’m on this subreddit and doing research, to try and understand and get answers about what happened, through the lens of bipolar, and not just “someone broke up with me, time to move on”. But all this “studying” is just making me more anxious and feeding me all these ruminations and intrusive thoughts. 

How do you just go through such a beautiful, loving, sweet time with someone who wanted to do nothing but love you…and just let them go, realizing the entire relationship might’ve been a manic episode? ",1,1761067967.0,BipolarSOs,3,1.0,False

1ocj79l,https://www.reddit.com/r/shootingrangebudapest/comments/1ocj79l/shooting_range_business_how_to_start/,Shooting Range Business: How to start?,"[Starting a shooting range business](https://solutionprime.co.uk/shooting-range-business-how-to-start/) often seems like a logical next step for those with a background in law enforcement, the military, or competitive shooting. After a career spent mastering firearms and understanding the legal landscape, establishing a post-retirement business seems like a perfect fit. The challenge, however, begins when the passion for firearms must translate into a sustainable **business model**. The common approach—offering basic training, courses, and range time—often falls short of generating enough revenue to cover the high **gun range startup costs**.

Have you truly calculated the expenses? Consider the staggering energy bills for an indoor range, the constant maintenance of the bullet trap, and the recurring costs of ammo, firearms, and staffing. Without a robust **shooting range** [**business plan**](https://solutionprime.co.uk/shooting-range-marketing-guide/), this is the point where many new businesses fail.

You might believe that offering ""tacticool"" courses or high-priced training will be enough. But who is your market? Government agencies have their own state-of-the-art facilities, and serious professionals often have specific training requirements that a new range can’t meet. This approach is a common path to business failure. While it’s a rare situation, if you have a unique relationship and the expertise to create a valuable, **gap-filling training program**, it can become a strong foundation for your business. For most, however, a different approach is needed. To succeed with a niche model, you must possess an unparalleled skill set that is in high demand, understand the specific **pain points** of that professional audience, and have the connections to market directly to them. This is not a situation for a generalist.

# Back to basics: The financial reality

Before you even consider what services to offer, you need a clear picture of your financial reality. This is where you grab a blank sheet of paper and list every single cost—from the most obvious to the seemingly insignificant.

* **Operating Costs:** Electricity is often the single largest expense for an indoor range due to HVAC, lighting, and ventilation systems. Factor in water, internet, phone, rent or mortgage, and insurance. Don't forget the small things that add up, like cleaning supplies, coffee for the waiting area, and office supplies.
* **Inventory Costs:** This is where you make a critical decision about your **business model**. When stocking firearms and ammo, our recommendation is to start with a limited, high-demand selection. Focus on foundational calibers like **.22LR, 9x19, .223, .308, and 12-gauge**.

Why this specific list? Because having a wide variety of calibers and firearms creates a logistical nightmare and ties up a significant amount of capital. Your money is literally sitting there, waiting to be sold. A more focused approach allows you to manage inventory, reduce costs, and avoid the complexity of catering to every possible niche from day one. It's a fundamental step toward achieving **gun range profitability**.

# The problem of inventory and staffing

Choosing your inventory is a direct reflection of your business model. If you intend to offer a **shooting experience**—targeting new shooters and tourists—you'll need a variety of firearms. But simply having them isn't enough. You must have a plan for reliability. If you have two shooting lanes and only two of a specific gun type, what happens when one fails? You can't tell a paying customer, ""Sorry, that gun isn't available."" You need to account for maintenance and breakdowns, which means having **backup guns** for every type offered.

This brings us to a fundamental question:

# What about your payroll and staffing?

The decision of who works, and when, directly depends on your target audience. Will you run a full-time operation, or will you open by reservation only? You have to choose because if you don't know your audience, you'll never reach them.

Consider the schedules of your potential customers. **Professionals** who need training may only be available during their working hours. **Sport shooters** often participate in events on weekends, making them more available for training during the week or after work. **Tourists** and **experience seekers**' visits depend on the season.

You must create a schedule that is sustainable for your company and your staff. You will need to determine who requires a firearms dealer (**RFD**) license and who will manage the guns and ammunition. Do you need a dedicated receptionist, or will your range officers handle guest check-ins? What happens if all your range officers are on the floor with guests? Do you close the doors to new visitors, or do you hire a separate receptionist to manage new arrivals? These aren't minor details; they are core operational questions that define your customer experience. Your **gun range marketing** efforts will be wasted if your operational model can’t handle the flow of customers you attract.

# Shooting range business Plan A: Catering to professionals and sport shooters

If your chosen path is to focus on a serious clientele, your business model must align with their specific needs. These shooters are looking for more than a static firing lane; they demand dynamic training conditions. This means providing specialized target systems like **metal or flop targets** alongside classic paper ones, and more importantly, offering the space to practice **shooting in movement**.

These features are mandatory to attract competitive **IPSC and IDPA** shooters, as well as law enforcement and military personnel who need practical, tactical training. The main problem with this model is the space required. Building a massive indoor complex for this kind of movement would require an enormous initial investment, which is simply not feasible for most.

This is why we suggest that for this business plan, an **outdoor range** is the superior option. Don't think of this as a disadvantage—these clients prioritize a training environment over fancy indoor leather sofas. An outdoor range can still be a professional, high-quality facility. By choosing this route, you can significantly drop the massive costs of **HVAC and electricity**, though you'll need to budget for landscaping and maintenance. While finding a suitable area can be challenging due to zoning and noise regulations, the savings on sound insulation, concrete walls, and expensive bullet traps are substantial. Moreover, an outdoor range offers a beautiful, natural environment that can easily be adapted for a wide variety of shooting sports and training scenarios.

# Shooting range business Plan B: The [first-timers, tourists](https://solutionprime.co.uk/shooting-range-marketing-part-ii-attracting-tourists/), and local thrill-seekers

Now, let's talk about the other end of the spectrum. You might think this is the ""easy money"" or the ""tourist trap"" route, and we'd have to agree in some ways. Many ranges operate with this mindset, but our philosophy is different. A shooting range can provide a truly memorable **experience**, and with the right strategy, it can be a sustainable and profitable business that provides real value to your customers. We believe in a win-win situation.

# Location

The first and most critical factor is **location**. You can build the best range in the world, but if people have a difficult time reaching you, they'll never bring you to the promised land of success. Finding the perfect spot is your first step. Check for public transport options, available parking, and think like a traveler. Be objective. Why? Because many tourists don't rent cars, so ease of access is a primary factor in their decision-making process. If it's a quick hop, a fun stop on their trip, and an easy exit to their next destination, then you've found a good location. Yes, a centrally located space can be expensive, but with the right pricing, you can easily cover your mortgage or rent.

# Capacity

Once your location is secured, you need to determine your **daily capacity**. How many guests can you welcome daily without feeling overwhelmed? This number is your maximum revenue potential. It's crucial to calculate this against your daily operating costs to decide when you should be open. For example, you can host 100 guests a day at maximum capacity, your average will likely be around 60%—so you'll see between 40 and 80 people on a typical day. This fluctuation between off-peak times and weekend rushes is normal. These numbers are the foundation for planning your **cash flow**.

How do you get these numbers? The best way is to use data. Start by creating a simple spreadsheet or a custom system to track daily visitors and revenue. For example, we use Google-based spreadsheet automations that can handle a lot of the data we get daily. For more advanced tracking, consider a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system. A great option is a modern POS (Point of Sale) system, such as those provided by **Revolut**. These systems do more than just process payments; they provide invaluable data analysis on transaction trends, peak hours, and even your most popular packages. By utilizing these tools, you'll gain deep insights into your customer flow and be able to make informed decisions.

# [Planning](https://solutionprime.co.uk/shooting-range-marketing-secrets-aim-your-success/)

With location and average revenue in mind, you can then plan the physical layout of the range itself. Where will the reception be? How will guests move from there to the range? Where will you store your guns and ammo? Do you need a dedicated office? Where will you handle weapon maintenance? Answering these questions will tell you the technical and industrial needs of your space, including the number of shooting lanes and the required staff. Now you can accurately calculate your monthly, weekly, and daily costs, from payroll to those small, hidden expenses like coffee and cleaning supplies.

# [Calculations](https://solutionprime.co.uk/financial-planning-for-shooting-businesses/)

With your average revenue and full costs laid out, you are ready to create your product. Should you offer packages, or a per-bullet scheme, or even short training courses? We've worked on numerous projects creating and building successful weapon assortments and packages from scratch. Both approaches can be successful, and we're here to help you figure it out.

Just a final thought: there is a huge difference between **offering** and **selling**. Never try to hard-sell your products. Instead, offer them, show their value, and demonstrate how they fulfill a need.

Now that you have a solid business foundation—from location and capacity to product offerings—there's one crucial step left. All of this careful planning is meaningless without a way to get people in the door. Our next and final topic will be all about marketing your shooting range to attract the right customers.

# Shovel money on Ads, or build a brand for the future?

We've seen it firsthand: marketing has become a profession that everyone claims to know. Honestly, there's a lot of truth behind that. In our opinion, the recent global events turned many into overnight marketing and SEO ""specialists"" and ""graphic designers"" who, frankly, have no business being on the market. But let's get back to what matters. Burning money on advertisements without a strategy is the most useless solution. We'll guide you through the main steps of creating a real, valuable brand and a marketing plan that works.

# 1. Create your appearance: The foundational branding

First, let's establish your visual identity. This means a solid logo, a consistent set of graphic elements, and designs that can be scaled for everything from your physical signage to your online platforms. Why is this so critical? Because this is the very first thing your audience will see. It needs to correctly target your desired customer base, whether that's the serious professional or the curious tourist.

# 2. The selling point: Your website

[**Your website**](https://solutionprime.co.uk/gun-club-website-design-attracting-customers-and-improving-operations/) is your digital storefront. So many ""experts"" fail to understand the basics of a good site—the purpose of headings, proper structure, optimized pagespeed, and indexability. What is a website's core function for your business? A good website will clearly show the visitor who you are, what you offer, and where you offer it. Everything else—from beautiful photos to engaging content—is simply a pillar that supports the answers to these three main questions.

>

We could dive into the nitty-gritty of building a website, from heading hierarchy and keyword targeting to explaining what a ""Hub-spoke model"" and ""content clusters"" are. To put it simply, a **content cluster** is a group of related articles about a single topic. A **hub-spoke model** is a strategy that focuses on a central, authoritative article (the **hub**) supported by several related, more detailed articles (the **spokes**). But we're not here to write an encyclopedia. Just remember this: you need a powerful lead-generating website that you can use for SEO and blogging.

# 3. Social media: The digital footprint

Social media is a love-hate relationship for many business owners, but it's an absolute must-have. You need to be on the key platforms. Some provide valuable backlinks, others are crucial for a good local business profile, and all are necessary for direct communication with your audience.

Once you’ve navigated the social jungle and created your profiles, don't forget one of the most important platforms of all: **Google Business**. Here you can publish news and updates, but the real value is that it's where you'll appear on Google Maps when someone is searching nearby—and it’s free! You should do the same for other engines like Bing and Apple Maps. Finally, make sure you register on platforms where travelers and thrill-seekers look for activities, like TripAdvisor, GetYourGuide, and Yelp, to get attention from future guests.

# 4. The advertising question: Organic vs. Paid

Your meticulous planning is an investment, but the return on that investment depends on getting people through the door. This is where advertising comes in. You can try to do the job organically by posting, sharing, and distributing flyers. But if you were to put a number on the time and effort you spend, that number would be the price you could spend on ads. By doing this, you're buying back your time to work on your business instead of doing something you hate and can't accurately measure.

The **firearms niche** is incredibly sensitive on the ad market. Due to strict policy restrictions and community guidelines, ad platforms often flag or reject campaigns related to firearms. That's why we always prepare for every restriction they roll out. When one of our tools triggers a policy violation, we immediately pull out a new one and continue while we clean up the problematic one. We've had countless conversations with support teams, but since Google's algorithms are usually at the root of the issue, and algorithms can make mistakes, we have to be ready for anything.

# Basic Google Ads setup for shooting range business

So how do we set up ads? We typically start with a three-pronged approach:

1. **Local Ads:** We focus on local business advertisements that appear when someone is searching on Google Maps.
2. **Search Ads:** We create campaigns for search engines targeting specific keywords.
3. **Wider Audience Ads (PMAX campaigns):** We target a broader, international audience who are planning trips to your location.

By covering these three areas, we can capture the majority of interested people and start measuring success. And this is where we have to be honest: if someone promises you 10x revenue without any measurement or data analysis, they are lying. Every successful PPC professional starts by targeting a broad audience for a few weeks, analyzes the results from local and online sales, and then modifies the campaigns based on that data.

We can prove that this model works. We have a track record of spending over **90,000 pounds** on shooting range ads and generating more than **9 times that in real revenue**. Based on our experience, a competitive market requires a budget of around 2,500 to 3,500 pounds per month. However, you should not start there. Google loves your money, so it’s best to start with a modest 1,500-2,000 pounds. After a month or two, once you've proven the ad campaigns are working, you can safely increase your budget by at least 10% each month. This ensures Google brings you customers, not just burns your money.

Remember, the paid ads are only effective because of the strong foundation you built with your professional website and social profiles. Without those, your ad spend is a waste.

Now that you have a solid business foundation—from location and capacity to product offerings—there's one crucial step left. All of this careful planning is meaningless without a way to get people in the door. Our next and final topic will be all about marketing your shooting range to attract the right customers. We've covered the digital tools, but no marketing plan is complete without leveraging the most powerful asset you have: the shooting range itself and the people who run it. In our final section, we'll discuss the role of your staff and your facility in a world-class marketing strategy.

# The most powerful marketing tool: Your staff and your Shooting Range Business

We've covered [**how to gain leads**](https://solutionprime.co.uk/mastering-shooting-range-lead-generation/) and conversations through online marketing and building a trustworthy digital presence, but it's a mistake to miss the most effective offline marketing tool: personal contact.

Think of your staff as more than just receptionists or range officers. They are the people who manage safety and create the guest experience. A warm smile and a friendly greeting at the door are the first things a guest will remember. Instead of just standing and waiting for questions, train your staff to be proactive.

# Example

Here’s an example of how to start: ""Hello, welcome to XY Shooting Range! How can I help you on this beautiful day? Do you have a reservation, or are you just thinking about trying this experience? Have you shot before? Awesome! Our specialty is providing an incredible shooting experience for first-timers. Let me help you with our package offers, which include different types of weapons and ammunition. Don’t worry, you can always add more shots to any of our weapons to customize your experience.""

After they’ve made their choice, the staff can continue the positive interaction. ""Thank you for choosing us! Your session starts at \[time\], so you have time to relax in our lounge with a coffee or tea. The restrooms are just over there. If you have any questions, just let me know—I'm here to help."" At the start of their session, the range officers can say, ""Our range officers will be here shortly to provide a brief safety overview and a rundown of the program. They will give you all the information you need, but remember, you can always ask them anything—they'll be happy to answer!""

By training your staff in this way, you can easily guide guests toward the experience you want them to have. You can add a few sentences about why each package is popular or why people love them. The main rule here is simple: **no secrets**. Tell and show them everything they need to know so there are no misunderstandings.

# Range officers as performers

Now, let's talk about the range officers. They are the program's most important guides. Their approach sets the tone for the entire experience. While a militant or overly ""tactical"" style might feel authentic to some, it's not the right approach for a business that caters to first-timers. You are the professional; your guests don't need to know everything. Your mission is to show the fun side of shooting and guide them from their very first steps to their first successful bullseye. No one expects to become an Olympic shooter after one session. They came for a fun experience, and you need to hit that tone. It’s an adult funfair with guns.

Instead of getting bogged down in technical details, use fun facts and interesting background stories about each firearm. A range officer's primary responsibility is safety, but their secondary role is that of a performer. A short joke or a well-placed question can increase a cart's value. For example: ""Where are you from? Oh, nice! Are you able to try these types of guns back home? Oh, what a shame. We're so glad you came to us! Don't forget, if you want to try any other weapons, just let me know and I'll start loading the ammo for you! More shots, more fun!""

As we said before, don't push; just offer.

After a session, always thank them for choosing your service. At the reception desk, always ask, ""How was it? What was your favorite part?"" This simple question opens the door for a well-placed suggestion toward a merchandise shop. You can simply say, ""Feel free to browse our merchandise and souvenir shop. If you need any help, just ask!""

With this kind of guest-handling, you can subtly guide the customer where you want them to go. You can offer services, options, and add-ons in a helpful and welcoming way, a far cry from a shouting street vendor.

# Final thought on your Shooting Range Business

We know this article has been a lot to take in, and we've focused heavily on the tourist-driven business model (Plan B). But our goal wasn't just to lay out a single path; it was to show you how complex, yet incredibly rewarding, starting a gun range can be.

Now is the time to grab a coffee or tea and truly think about the topics we've covered. Consider the questions we've asked about your audience, your costs, and your strategy. Don't worry, you don't have to figure it all out alone.

Whether you're still in the brainstorming phase or you've already started to build your dream shooting range in the UK or the US, we're here to help. If you're interested, let us know your thoughts.

# Magic formula

We know you, the reader, are probably waiting for the **magic formula** for this business. You're looking for a simple 'how-to' checklist that will guarantee you long-term income and allow you to travel the world.

The truth is, **there is no secret formula**. If you approach this in the most ethical ('white hat') way, you must **plan meticulously**, think several steps ahead, and **calculate based on the worst-case numbers** to prepare for the inevitable downturns. This entire ecosystem you need to build is always a **custom-built** one. You have to consider the exact **capital** required for the business, the **location**, your **pricing strategy**, and the **customer base**—all of which profoundly influence the whole business model. We want to show you that a shooting range can be just a hobby, or it can be a solid, well-planned business.

# Q&A about the Shooting Range Business Model

# What is the most common mistake for [**new shooting range**](https://solutionprime.co.uk/budapest-shooting-range-the-revolutionary-concept/) owners?

The most common mistake is failing to transition from a hobbyist mindset to a business mindset. Many owners underestimate the significant operational costs and do not have a robust business plan to ensure long-term profitability.

# Why is an outdoor range suggested for professional and sport shooters?

Outdoor ranges are a superior option for professionals because they offer the space needed for dynamic, movement-based training. This model allows owners to save on the high costs of HVAC, electricity, sound insulation, and complex bullet traps associated with indoor facilities.

# Why is location so important for a first-timer and tourist-focused range?

For this business model, location is critical because your target audience often does not have a car. A central location with easy access via public transport, walking, or ride-sharing services makes it a convenient and attractive option for travelers and locals alike.

# How can I calculate my shooting range's daily capacity and cash flow?

You should first determine your maximum daily capacity. Then, use that number to project a realistic average (typically around 60% of your max capacity) to account for peak and off-peak times. You can track this data using simple tools like Google Sheets or more advanced systems like a Revolut POS system.

# What is the ""hub-spoke model"" in website content?

A hub-spoke model is a website strategy that organizes content around a central, authoritative article (**the hub**) on a broad topic. This hub is then supported by several related, more detailed articles (**the spokes**) that link back to the main hub. [**This structure improves SEO**](https://solutionprime.co.uk/shooting-range-seo-case-study/) and establishes your authority on a subject.

# Why is Google Business a ""must-have"" for a shooting range?

**Google Business** is essential because it is a free tool that places your business on Google Maps. It ensures that when people in your area search for shooting ranges, they can easily find your location, hours, and contact information.

# How much should a new shooting range budget for advertising?

A competitive market might require a budget of £2,500-£3,500 per month. However, it's best to start with a more modest budget of £1,500-£2,000 for the first couple of months. This allows you to test your campaigns and ensure they are driving customers before increasing your spend.

# What is the most effective offline marketing tool?

The most powerful offline marketing tool is your staff. Their ability to provide excellent personal service, from the initial greeting to the final farewell, creates a positive and memorable experience that can generate repeat business and word-of-mouth referrals.

# What is the key difference between ""offering"" and ""selling""?

**Offering** means presenting your products and services in a helpful, informative way, allowing the customer to make a choice. **Selling** implies a more pushy or aggressive approach. In the service industry, offering is always more effective and creates a better customer experience.

# Why is a ""militant"" style not suitable for a tourist-focused range?

A highly militant or overly tactical approach can be intimidating for first-time shooters who are seeking a fun and welcoming experience. Instead, a range officer should be a ""performer"" who focuses on safety first, while also using humor and interesting facts to make the experience enjoyable and engaging.

Smarter.

Prettier.

But sitting across from her now, the spark in her eyes was gone.

Slumped opposite me in our favorite coffee shop, trembling hands wrapped around an untouched iced coffee, my sister resembled a paper doll, a paper doll slowly coming apart.

I told myself to ignore her damp, stringy hair, her split lip, the yellow bruises blooming beneath her eye. 

Her new school really had done a number on her.

“Lils,” I said, “are you being bullied?”

She looked up, her eyes wide.

“I made a mistake, Elizabeth.” Her lips trembled, a wet sob tearing from her throat, so raw, so agonizing, it shivered through me, crawling down my spine. 

“Can you pretend to be me?” She whispered. “Please?” 

I nodded, after slight hesitation. 

“Sure.” 

Entering the school as my sister, I was met with…screams. 

“Lili!” One girl entangled her fingers with mine. 

“Sweetie, where'd you run off to?” 

“We missed you, Lili!” 

A guy stepped up beside me, resting his head on my shoulder. 

He reeked of sweat, his uniform filthy and clinging to him.

His wild eyes were frantic and unblinking, lips stretched into a grin. 

“I couldn’t breathe without you, babe.” 

Looking up, something ice cold slid down my spine. 

Lili's face was plastered on every wall, her name scrawled in blood and shit. 

Kids came at me in swarms. 

“Lili!” they shouted, slamming into me like feral animals. 

Inside my sister’s dorm room, a boy waited. His eyes were wide, his lips stretched into a manic grin. 

Hair matted, clothes crumpled and stained, as if he had pissed right there on the floor. In his hand, he held a metal prong, pressing it against his temple. 

“Hi, Lili,” he giggled, the stench of him hitting me. Sharp and sour, like rot. He swayed back and forth, dancing from foot to foot. “You told me to wait until you come back, and then do this!” 

I screamed when he drove it into his skull. 

His eyes rolled back, mouth parting, as if enjoying it. 

Before he  collapsed, like a puppet cut from its strings.

“Lili Montgomery.” 

I was grabbed and forced onto my knees, a figure looming over me. 

“For your crimes against this school,” he began, “for the *brutal* brainwashing and subsequent slaughter of Noah Redford, and for using magic on your fellow students,” he stamped on my head, “for the disgusting and vile abuse of your abilities.”

Hiding behind a thick mop of brown curls, his eyes were red, his lips trembling.

“The Academy of Young Witches condemns you.”

He leaned closer. “You evil bitch,” his words were a single breath. 

“Did you *really* think you could run? Turn us into your personal puppet show and just walk away?” 

His laugh was harsh, cutting. “Your sentence is hanging.”

*”I made a mistake.”*

Lili’s voice rattled in my head, as four students surrounded me. 

I hit the floor, my nose exploding on impact.

She made a *mistake?!*",22,1761067656.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

I was struggling to make good coffee for a while, and could never hear first crack. So I drilled a hole in the top cap and stuck a meat thermometer down there. The temps on the meat thermometer were 100 degrees cooler than the roaster reading. Once I ignored the roaster reading and cranking up the temp, I’m now making good coffee. 


My questions are: 1) is using a meat thermometer like this a good way to track bean temps? And 2) can I use these temp numbers for the blue bean temp curves on roasting charts?

That low, lazy chuckle that used to curl around her spine like smoke. She heard it from across the café, and her stomach did that thing it used to do when he’d walk in the door with two coffees and a crooked smile, like he knew he was late but also knew she’d forgive him.

She didn’t turn around. Not yet.

Instead, she stirred her tea like it was a potion, like maybe if she mixed it just right, she could erase the memory of him tracing her collarbone with his thumb, whispering things that felt like promises but turned out to be just good intentions.

Jace was with someone. She could tell by the way his voice lifted, the way he said “baby” like it was a new word he was trying on. Maleah used to be that baby. Now she was just somebody he used to know.

They’d been fire and gasoline. Passionate, messy, loud. The kind of love that made you forget your own name and remember every damn thing he ever said. Jace had a way of making her feel like she was the only woman in the world—until he didn’t.

It started with little things. A missed call. A forgotten date. That time he said he was working late but came home smelling like a perfume she didn’t wear. Maleah wasn’t stupid. She just didn’t want to believe that the man who used to write her poems on napkins was now writing excuses in text messages.

She finally turned around. Jace was standing at the counter, laughing with a woman who looked like she’d never cried over him. She was polished, poised. The kind of woman who probably didn’t throw his clothes in the street or scream at him in the rain. Maleah had done both. Twice.

He saw her. Their eyes locked. And for a second, it was like time folded in on itself. Like they were back in that tiny apartment with the broken heater, wrapped in blankets and dreams. But then he looked away. Just like that.

She didn’t flinch. Didn’t blink. Just sipped her tea like it wasn’t laced with heartbreak.

Jace walked over. Alone now. The woman had gone to the restroom or maybe just sensed the tension in the air.

“Hey,” he said, like they were old friends who’d lost touch, not lovers who’d lost everything.

“Hey,” she replied, cool as the ice in her veins.

“You look good.”

“I know.”

He smiled. That same damn smile. “You been okay?”

Maleah tilted her head. “I’ve been better. I’ve been worse. I’ve been me.”

Jace nodded like he understood, but Maleah knew he didn’t. He never really did. He loved the idea of her—the strong, sexy, smart woman who could hold her own and hold him down. But when she needed holding, he vanished.

“I think about you sometimes,” he said.

She leaned back. “I think about me all the time.”

There it was. The truth. She’d spent too long thinking about him, trying to fix what was broken, trying to be enough. But she was already enough. He just didn’t know how to handle it.

“You were good to me,” he said, voice low.

“I was good for you,” she corrected. “You just weren’t ready.”

Jace looked down, like maybe the floor had answers. “I didn’t mean to hurt you.”

Maleah stood up, gathering her things. “You didn’t mean not to.”

He reached for her arm, but she stepped back. “Don’t. We’re not those people anymore.”

She walked out, head high, heart steady. The sun hit her face like a blessing, and she smiled. Not because she saw him again, but because she didn’t feel the need to cry about it.

Jace was a chapter. A loud, messy, beautiful chapter. But the book was still being written, and Maleah had picked up the pen.

She didn’t need closure. She needed peace. And she was finally learning how to give that to herself.

By the time she got to her car, she was humming. Not the song they used to dance to, but something new. Something that sounded like freedom.",1,1761067482.0,stories,0,1.0,False
1ocj2kn,https://i.redd.it/1bf3ncsl1iwf1.jpeg,Looking for Rediscovering my worth,"I stared at Troy across the crowded campus café, certain I'd misheard him. The familiar buzz of student conversations and the hiss of the espresso machine seemed to fade into white noise as his words echoed in my mind.

""You're choosing Eve as your project partner?""

Troy shifted in his seat, avoiding my eyes as he picked at the corner of his textbook. ""Dana, it's just a project. Don't make it into something bigger than it is.""

But it was bigger. So much bigger. We'd talked about this competition for months—the Regional Academic Excellence Challenge that could secure graduate school recommendations and open doors neither of us had dreamed of. We'd planned it together, researched together, even joked about how we'd celebrate our inevitable victory together.

""We promised each other,"" I said, my voice barely above a whisper. ""Fifteen years, Troy. We've been a team for fifteen years.""

He finally looked up, and something cold flickered in his familiar brown eyes. ""Look, Eve brings something different to the table. She's got this... perspective. This drive. You know how inspiring her story is—scholarship kid, working three jobs, overcoming all those obstacles.""

Each word felt like a small knife twisting deeper. ""What about my perspective? What about our partnership?""

""Come on, Dana."" Troy's laugh was sharp, dismissive. ""What obstacles have you ever had to overcome? Your biggest challenge is choosing between your BMW and your dad's Mercedes.""

The casual cruelty in his tone made me flinch. This was Troy—my Troy—who used to trace my palm with his finger when I was nervous, who knew exactly how I liked my coffee, who'd held me through every anxiety attack since sophomore year of high school.

""That's not fair,"" I managed.

""Isn't it?"" He leaned back, studying me like I was a problem to be solved. ""Eve's hungry for this, Dana. She needs it. You... you'll be fine either way. You always are.""

The dismissal in his voice hit me like a physical blow. I felt my hands trembling as I reached for my coffee cup, needing something to anchor me. ""So that's it? After everything we've built together?""

""Don't be dramatic."" Troy glanced around the café, clearly uncomfortable with the attention my raised voice was drawing. ""It's one project. We're still together, aren't we?""

But even as he said it, I could see the truth in his restless fingers, in the way he kept checking his phone, in the careful distance he'd put between us at the small table. When had he started sitting across from me instead of beside me?

""I just thought..."" I swallowed hard, hating how small my voice sounded. ""I thought we were partners. In everything.""

""We are."" But his attention had already drifted to something over my shoulder. I turned to see Eve Walker approaching our table, her worn backpack slung over one shoulder, that carefully practiced smile lighting up her face.

""Troy!"" She touched his arm as she slid into the empty chair beside him—the chair that should have been mine. ""I've been looking everywhere for you. I had the most amazing idea for our project opening.""

Our project. The words sliced through me.

Eve's eyes flicked to me with what looked like sympathy but felt like calculation. ""Oh, Dana. I hope you're not upset about the partnership thing. I know you and Troy are... close. But you understand, right? This competition means everything to me. It's my shot at proving I belong here.""

The practiced vulnerability in her voice, the way she positioned herself as the underdog fighting for her dreams while I was just... what? An obstacle? A spoiled princess who didn't deserve consideration?

""Of course,"" I heard myself say, the words automatic, trained by fifteen years of putting Troy's needs before my own. ""I understand.""

But as I watched Troy's face light up at Eve's animated explanation of her project ideas—ideas that sounded suspiciously similar to the ones we'd brainstormed together just last week—something inside me began to crack.

I stood up abruptly, my chair scraping against the floor. ""I should go.""

Troy barely glanced up. ""See you later, babe.""

Babe. The casual endearment that once made my heart flutter now felt like salt in an open wound.

I walked away on unsteady legs, past the laughing students and the warm afternoon light streaming through the café windows. But with each step, that crack inside me widened, and for the first time in fifteen years, I wondered who I was when I wasn't Troy Sullivan's devoted girlfriend.

The question terrified me. But not as much as the growing certainty that I was about to find out.",1,1761067422.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

During COVID, he moved in with me, and we both worked remotely from my small apartment. We even rented a small additional unit in our building to use as an office space. His job requires multiple monitors and equipment, so having a dedicated workspace for him while I worked in the apartment was fine. At first, it was kind of fun to work in the same space.

Fast forward a few years: he quit his job. Since I’m self-employed, he does some light admin for my business, and I essentially support us both. All the money that comes into our home is money I make. I don’t know what his long-term employment plan is — it changes weekly. Sometimes he wants to pursue self-employment (his original plan), and sometimes he’s applying for full-time jobs. I’m giving him space to figure out what he wants because it’s clear he doesn’t know. This has been a tough issue for him and it’s one I have been supportive of and it is important to me to continue to be supportive through his employment transition process. 

The problem is that the novelty of working in the same apartment has completely worn off. We (really, I) pay for him to have his own separate space to work, and I hardly ever disturb him. Yet he’s constantly in our apartment while I am doing the work that pays our bills. I understand that he needs to come in for coffee, food, or bathroom breaks, but it’s becoming unbearable. 

Little interruptions genuinely distract me. He’ll come into the apartment while I’m working to run the vacuum or start putting away dishes loudly, seemingly without any thought to whether I’m trying to focus. If I don’t greet him enthusiastically — for example, if I just give a quick “hi” and keep working — he sulks and makes a show of disappearing which I also hate. I feel like I’m required to chat on demand, and anything less is interpreted as hostility. This is entirely one-sided, and I resent it. I don’t think anyone should be forced to engage in niceties with their husband or wife multiple times during the work day. 

My job involves lots of calls. We agreed that during calls he stays out of the apartment, but he expects me to notify him when I’m done so he can come back in. It sucks to finish a draining two-hour call and have to immediately engage with him instead of having a moment of quiet. Even with our current system — where he messages before entering — he doesn’t always wait for my response. Recently, he barged in during an important virtual presentation with my camera on and started making coffee until I had to mute and tell him to leave. I was furious. 

Since he hasn’t been employed, he’s taken on more household admin in addition to light work for my business, which is great. But often, he interrupts me with unrelated tasks or questions that he seems to assume are urgent, without any sense of what I’m balancing. If I say, “I’m working on X right now, can we talk about this later?” he takes it to mean I never want to discuss it, and it gets dropped and its my fault because I didnt want to talk about it when he brought it up. I need hours of uninterrupted, focused time for work while also balancing calls, and right now, factoring him in is making that balance impossible.

I’m considering asking him if a few days a week he can leave our building to work elsewhere — somewhere he can’t just pop in multiple times an hour.

The tricky part: he’s very self-conscious about being unemployed and admits it’s made him sensitive. I know this request will probably feel like I’m criticizing him for being home all the time. But I’m going crazy. My work is suffering, and I feel myself pulling away just to get space. We spend entirely too much time together. I miss the days when he went to an office, and I had a solid eight hours of solitude to work. 

**TL;DR:** My husband quit his job and is home all the time while I’m self-employed and support us both. He has a separate office, but he’s constantly in our apartment, interrupting me and expecting chats on demand. I need uninterrupted work time, but asking for space may hurt his feelings because he’s sensitive about being unemployed.",2,1761067218.0,AskMenRelationships,2,1.0,False

He has been OBESSED with taxes and money more recently. He went to purchase tax software from Office Depot for NEXT yr and it's only October. Instead of arguing, I let him go. Of course there was nothing to purchase YET because its STILL 2025.

Here's the kicker that could be the end of the road for me....

For some unknown reason he was looking for his divorce papers from his 1st wife. When I asked him ""why"" he didn't answer,  which spoke volumes. When he couldn't find them he ordered (and received) them from the courthouse. Shortly afterwards he says, ""I gotta call an attorney"". I asked him why & he said ""I think I owe my ex money from selling a house years ago"".

Of course I lost it - ""r u f'ing kidding me? She's been remarried/divorced and been traveling with her family for YEARS. If you owed her money she'd be at the door"". I ended by saying ""If you pursue this, I will leave you"" .... and I left the house to cool down. 

Hours later I came home. He sincerely apologized and felt bad and said he would NOT PURSUE the issue. It went in one ear and out the other because he's been changing his mind ALOT.

Last night, you guessed it, he said ""I might have to call ____ (his ex). I  said nothing and went to sleep with the thought that this will all ""change tomorrow"". He hasn't said anything..... yet.

My medication mgmt counselor says my husband is showing early signs of dementia. He worked with dementia patients for over 20 years.

I asked my husband many times to see his physician for suggestions or testing..... and it leads to an argument. Last year he suggested I was trying to make him seem unstable and take the money. I was crushed because he has NEVER said anything like that.

His kids think I'm ""over reacting"". I said ""fine - just be ready to come out and take care of him because I'm at my wits end"".

Hope this venting makes sense to those with similar issues. There's so much more ... but this is a quick summary.

Been a pleasure reading you lately. 
I own an Oscar since 2008. It died 2 weeks ago (post unreplied to in espresso repair). It just stopped making noise and the empty tank light blinks open after a few seconds. Local repairmen says I should euthanized it since it's not the pump according to him. I had an older baby gaggia in my storage. It died this morning (will steam, but not push water). 
So I end up relying on my V60 and Aeropress for the next while. 

I always promised myself that the next machine would be my endgame. 
We plan on doing Kitchen renos in 2 years. 

I enjoy the coffee routine. And while I do not drink milk beverages. I do seldom do them with the Oscar (HX dragon power) so not ready to downgrade to a single pump.

My experience with Oscar tells me that HX might not be as durable as Dual. 

My renos push me to design he kitchen for a plug in (rotary).  

So here we are. I want your advice on a Dual, Rotary machine. In Canada. 

I've been looking a lot at the Synchronika I (4000$ Canadian 700$ cheaper than the II at minimum 4700)
I found a Profited Pro 700 for 3600$ and one Drive for 4000$

# About Me

I'm 31M 170 cm tall and weigh about 58.4 kg (or 5'7"" and 128 lbs.) I've been running for about 5 years now. Coming into this race, I set a half-marathon PB of 1:24:56 in April, and I have ambitions of getting my Boston Qualifier time in the next couple of years. My previous marathon PB was 3:38:43 set last year, but this was run conservatively due to hot and humid conditions on race day. As much as I loved my first experience, I always wondered what it’d feel like to run to my limits, and man I got more than I bargained for with this race.

# Training

After an amazing half-marathon result, I rebuilt my base in a couple of months and braced for training. I got up to my usual 100 km (85mi) towards the end, and had a couple long run workouts in there, so I was pretty confident going in. I opted for a 16 week plan that’s based on Jack Daniels’ system of training. I knew that the likely BQ time after cut-offs wasn't going to be realistic, but at the very least I could shoot for sub 3.

This year’s summer was unseasonably warm and humid by Southern Ontario’s standards, and it really started to take its toll. In hindsight, I did a pretty poor job adjusting for the heat and my workouts were consistently very difficult as a result. Nearly all sessions were done in temperatures that felt like 30C (86F) and 88% RH. In addition to that, I was completely unaccustomed to the steady pace (approximately zone 3) runs that the plan had prescribed. And sure enough, during week 6 I started to feel sore, and by week 8 I was injured. My right hip was locking up badly and I could not run.

After doing the 5 stages of grief, I booked a session with my PT. The conclusion we reached was that it was a hip flexor strain. It’d take 2-4 weeks to heal. The timing couldn’t be worse as it coincided with the peak of the training plan. I’d sporadically run during this time, but they were always easy efforts and very low mileages. I just could not produce any power whatsoever from my right side. There was some cross-training, but it definitely was not a substitute for running.

Mentally, it was tough to deal with. Thinking you’re knocking on the 3 hour barrier’s door, and then going to completely sidelined is quite the emotional U-turn. At certain points I debated whether or not it’d be wise to run the race at all.

By week 11, the healing process was steady enough that I started musing about running the race. I coached myself to a sub 1:25 half and I thought I could at least get myself ready to complete the race in 5 weeks. It wouldn’t be a sub 3 or anywhere close to that, but I thought it’d feel worse to miss out. So, I fired up Excel and started writing my own plan. This plan featured an aggressive ramp up from 85 km (52 mi)  / week, to 100 km (62 mi), 130 km (80 mi) and then a 2 week taper. Additionally, I re-tooled my strength training to include weights. I had previously gotten away with only bodyweight exercises, but it was clear that I needed something more for the future.

Full disclosure, I acknowledge that this is incredibly reckless. **I do not recommend this**. I only got away with this because I set a conservative goal. I have experience coaching myself. I’m very familiar with my own training and how my body reacts to it. On any given day I could modify, moderate, or skip a run if needed. Also, I had a fair bit of luck on my side.

Week 1 of 5, my paces were all over the place and my sessions truly humbled me. Paces that I previously considered trivial were now anything but. It stung the ego a bit, but I needed to swallow my pride if this was going to work. Sure enough, I got through week 1 unscathed and my hip flexor strain was rapidly improving. Which means, this is precisely the best time to get sick.

During week 2, I attended a Blue Jays game and must’ve caught something there. Funny enough, I thought the burning in my throat was just caused by some mustard I choked on. The session the next day felt fine, but I finished with a scratchy throat. By the evening I had aches and pains. The surefire signs of a cold or respiratory tract infection.

It was going to be hard to do this with an injury on the mend, but now throwing illness into the mix? I had to dig deep. I was red-lining my body quite a bit, but the infection wasn’t so bad that it prevented me from running. I had fought off much worse in the past. I took a rest day and finished the 100 km (62mi) week off, even running a double day and 30K (18.5 mi) long run session.

Week 3 would test me. It was a 130 km (80 mi) week, more than I had ever done. I had reached 125 km (77 mi) in my half-marathon training, so I reasoned I could do this with much less cumulative fatigue. Still, it was tough going. Double days, mile repeats, and some threshold speed injections in a long run. I knew this was the last week to see any fitness gains, so “make it count” was the motto.

It was here that I decided on my new time goal. Without a race result at my new fitness level to go off of, I couldn’t use the VDot calculator. Runalyze’s prognosis is something I have a love-hate relationship with, but it’s the number I ultimately went with. My A-Goal would be 3:20:00. In the case that my hip flexor wouldn’t allow this, I went with a B-Goal of sub 3:25.

&nbsp;

# Pre-race
I opted for a 2 week taper. The main objective was to let my hip flexor strain fully heal. I moderated some of the more difficult efforts and reduced my easy mileage substantially. Week 4 had an overall mileage of 85 km (52 mi), and week 5 had about 45km (27 mi,) excluding the marathon. A bit less than I’d usually do, but I figured that the minimal amount of hay I had was already in the barn. The priority now was recovery while keeping things sharp. It was a very fine balancing act that I ultimately got right. My running economy was improving and my paces began to return to normal. I also threw in some steady paced efforts to get a feel for the pace I had chosen. The last remnants of the illness would dissipate during this time.

2 days out from the race, I started to carbload. About 8.5g per kilo of my bodyweight per day. I usually go a bit lighter with the loading phase, because I sleep considerably worse if I over do it.

For my shakeout, I had a couple Ks of warm up, 3K of marathon pace work, and some cool down. The pace felt difficult, but definitely not impossible. More importantly though, I wore what I had on at my first marathon. A new PB was all but guaranteed since I ran that one so conservatively, but it was also a reminder of the progress I’d made in a year.

# Race

I woke up at 4:00 AM, asking myself why the hell I got into this hobby. I had my usual breakfast, 2 PB&J bagels and about 380 mL of black coffee. I arrived about an hour before start time to account for the large crowd. After running my warm up, I realized there wasn’t enough time to use the washrooms before getting into the corrals. The barricades and dense crowds meant I couldn’t go. I kicked myself for this, but it was what it was. I decided to use the first one I saw on the race course, since most folks would’ve gone already and it wouldn’t be too punishing to stop early on in the race.

Conditions for the day were a temperature range of 17 to 21C (62.6f to 69.8f) with winds between 21 kph (13 mph) to 30 kph (18 mph.) The gusts were 30 kph (18 mph) to 50 kph (31 mph.) Not ideal at all. I was hoping for rain to help cool things down, but it wasn’t to be. Thankfully the wind was coming mostly from the south and would only be a true headwind for a few sections of the race.

I started getting into my own head a bit. Aside from the weather, running after coming back from an injury and being undertrained was going to be a challenge. I started to have some doubts. What if my hip flexor gave out again? What if I couldn’t hold the pace? 5 weeks isn’t enough time, what was I thinking?

Then, someone nudged me out of my thoughts. To my complete and utter surprise, this guy recognized me from my YouTube channel. Which isn’t big at all. With a modest 30 subscribers, and most viewed video having some 500 views, I’m definitely not internet famous on Running YouTube. We exchanged pleasantries and he was on his way. That was enough to snap me out of my mental funk. I was ready to give this race all I had.


&nbsp;

At 8:00 AM we were off. The first section of the race was a slight uphill on Yonge Street before turning westbound on Bloor Street. I had previously filmed a 10K race on this stretch of road, so it was like saying hello to an old friend. I set off at pace until the 3K aid station where I took a quick toilet break. Like I had predicted, the portapotties were available. However, this set me behind pace by about a minute. I’d push to finish the third kilometre at 5:08/km pace. I was in a deficit of about 15 seconds. Something that I’d quickly make up for in the next two kilometres.

As I was making my way down Bathurst Street, I began playing with paces a bit. While 4:30/km (7:15/mi) felt a little too much, 4:35-4:40/km (7:23-7:31/mi) felt much better than I thought it would. So I opted for that level of effort instead. If there was a section that was being difficult, I’d fall back to the target of 4:45/km (7:39/mi.)

The race then took us down by Fort York, a preserved 18th century military installation, before bringing us to the titular waterfront the marathon takes its name from. Lakeshore Boulevard has a fantastic view of Lake Ontario. The sun peaked out, tinting the clouds orange as strong winds crashed dark waves on the breakwater.

Speaking of the wind, it was truly hitting me now. In the downtown areas, some of the buildings provided cover, and Bathurst was a slight downhill, but on the lakeshore, there was nothing. I couldn’t help but smile a bit. I had defied warm weather and crosswinds separately at Mississauga. Now it was all about putting those lessons together.

At aid stations, I’d opt to splash water over myself at the first table and mostly drink Nuun at the second. With the winds gusting, this worked well to provide the much needed cooling. Especially since the aid stations were placed every 3K.


&nbsp;

We made our loop at Lakeshore Boulevard to swing back towards the city and under the Gardiner Expressway. Although my Garmin’s GPS was relatively reliable, it was here where it unraveled. Because the Gardiner is an overhead highway with Lakeshore boulevard directly underneath, most GPSs will get confused. It’s happened so many times to me when using Google Maps.

My watch went haywire on the 20th kilometre and the alert sounded well in advance of the marker. I had been keeping a very rough track of how much time I was missing from not running the course 100% to the tangents. Using the difference between the Garmin lap alert and me crossing the physical marker gave me a rough idea. Now I was flying blind and the alerts were sounding off hundreds of metres ahead of where they were.

I decided to not think too much about it and just try to stick to my target pace. I knew I was already up a bit in terms of time due to running faster than expected. The GPS wasn’t likely to malfunction again until the final stretch in the downtown area.

The Toronto Waterfront Marathon isn’t a hilly course by any means, but there were definitely some inclines on the eastbound stretch out to The Beaches that didn’t feel great, but for every stretch that didn’t feel great, there were two or three where I felt like I was skating across the road. It was here I also caught sight of the 3:20 pace group. I started a couple minutes behind them, so I knew if I was on top of them I was making my objective by about that much.

&nbsp;

Despite the good news, trouble was brewing. I felt my right calf start to get a little tighter. The early warning signs of a cramp. The wind and heat was affecting me more than I thought it would. In light of that, I decided to take my only caffeine gel later on after the 30K mark, rather than the planned 25K. In addition to hydrating more, I increased my cadence and slightly reduced my stride length. Aside from a 189 spm looking like a very comical shuffle at my pace, this took the edge off the cramp.

After what seemed like an eternity, I reached the turn around point on Queen Street East and Balsam Avenue. The downhill back felt considerably better. I had a little check in with myself and realized I had quite a bit of gas left in the tank. It was time to do a little negative split for the last 4K.

I stepped on the gas and ramped up to 4:29/km (7:13/mi) and it felt great. The caffeine had really kicked in by now and I was locked in. I flew across the Eastern Avenue bridge and ramped up to 4:23/km (7:03/mi,) making my way back downtown. With some cover from the wind, I took the next kilometre at 4:22/km (7:02/mi.) Then there was the final stretch.

Up until this point I had been running with music, but most of it was being drowned out by the cheering crowds. But, there was a small section where no one was standing where the most crucial song I had chosen for the last leg of the race was audible. One Final Effort from the Halo 3 soundtrack. Hearing those opening piano chords was like electricity. The sections of the song that appeared during the game’s final warthog run signalled it was time to finish the fight. Against a final uphill, I went all out, touching my 10K race pace and launching myself through the finish line.

# Post-race

Upon finishing, I was proud of what I had just done. I just took some 20 minutes off my previous marathon PB in some less than ideal conditions. I felt like I had accomplished what I set out to do, to run a marathon to my absolute limit. And I got that confirmed immediately, because after I crossed the finish line and stopped, my right calf cramped up. My left leg, having had enough of my right’s antics for the past couple of years, decided to go on strike, refusing to support my full bodyweight, and just like that I was flat on my butt.

The medical team were immediately on me fearing the worst. It was hot that day and we were taking casualties all race long. Looking back at the finish line footage, I also saw that the gentleman right behind me stopped to make sure my head didn’t hit the pavement. It wasn’t a real risk, but the gesture is still incredibly kind.

I sheepishly told the medics that it was just a cramp. I couldn’t really walk though, so they wheeled me off to the side. After a hundred metres or so, the medic asked me if I wanted to go to the medical tent. My leg wasn’t perfect, but I tried standing on it, and it was good enough to limp on, and I was on my way, medal in tow. My mind set on one place. Vancouver.

But every time, the same patterns repeat: coffee breaks, familiar personalities, office dramas… and the root cause? managing days off.

For context, in France we have a quirk: no, not the escargots — the 35-hour workweek. Anything beyond that gives you recovery time, the RTTs. Employees usually get 2 per month. And that’s where the trouble begins.

To keep things running smoothly, not everyone can take the same days off. But when you’re many, everyone wants the same Mondays and Fridays. Managers — who are also in charge of scheduling (WFM) — have to make the call. Like Dewey in *Malcolm*: “You live, you live, you die.” Stress for managers, frustration for employees. Even more in December, when after the 15th the workload spikes, and RTTs are limited. I hate frustration, so I imagined a solution.

The core problem for managers is that they’re solving the scheduling puzzle forever, spending hours creating schedules. My lightbulb moment: let the team manage their own schedules, with a simple algorithm that fairly allows or denies time-off requests. No AI, just one setup by the manager, then it runs itself.

And I did it. Solo. No budget, no outside help. It works, and it’s actually pretty cool.

Now the challenge: letting the world know this is useful. In a sea of projects launching every day with marketing budgets bigger than Luxembourg’s GDP, it’s tough to stand out.

So here’s the deal: if you struggle with scheduling, I’ve got some trial licenses to share if you want to try it out. The goal? To become the Beyoncé, or Elvis Presley, of workforce scheduling, quit the day job, and finally take New Year’s off in 2026.

And I’m genuinely curious — how do you handle scheduling and time-off requests in your teams? Any war stories or hacks?",0,1761066772.0,workforcemanagement,1,0.4,False

I moved to a new country in Europe to get my masters degree. Overall hiring here is better than in the home but issues like housing combined with relatively low salary makes it hard to live if you don’t have parents you can stay with. I have applied to several places but no luck so far. But there’s also so much to love about this country, the community, the nature, etc. I also would have better access to healthcare, life balance, employee rights, retirement, etc. The issue is that if I don’t get a job before I graduate I have to go back to the home where the job market is cooked, I won’t have healthcare, and there’s a lot of uncertainty. To me I feel like I can’t even have any dreams anymore because everything is going to the corporate millionaires and billionaires so they can leach off of us and leave us to die. I just wish I could live. Sometimes I find myself randomly breaking out into tears when I think of the future. Normally i would talk to my friends about this but i haven’t talked to them in a few weeks because I realized I was the only one checking in and asking how things were and trying to start conversations. Once i stopped initiating conversations no one talked to me. And when i talked about my struggles I got a lot of dismissive responses so it honestly hurt my feelings more to talk to them than just keeping it bottled up. Genuinely the only person who tries to talk to me is my mom. Which is just crazy because i’ve lived myself caring about others, sending gifts from places i visited, buying my friends coffee or gift boxes when they were having a rough time, always asking how things are. But once I need it? Nothing. I’ve been giving away my love happily but my own need for love was never reciprocated. Now I feel like I have no future and no friends, just waiting until the rug is pulled out from under me and I have nothing left. The worst part is that i’m feeling is not unique at all.

I’ve been dating this girl for about two or three months. Things were going really well. On Thursday, I was at her place, and everything just felt right. We were laughing, talking, and eventually, I kissed her. It was lovely. I stayed a bit longer, then went home.

That night, I realized I needed to tell her that I’m trans (pre-op). I’ve been on HRT for six years now. I’m 20, and I look completely like a cis guy, but I still felt like she deserved to know.

All of Friday, I kept thinking about how to say it. In the end, I told her over FaceTime. I didn’t want to do it over text because it felt too impersonal, but I also didn’t have the courage to say it in person. At first, her reaction wasn’t bad. She was clearly surprised, but she didn’t freak out, or at least I thought she didn’t.

We spent Saturday and Sunday together as if nothing had changed. We slept at her place both nights, kissed, cuddled, cooked, watched movies, went for coffee. It felt so normal, so good.

Then, on Sunday evening, I got a text from her:

“I can’t do this. I need time to think. My sexuality is very important to me, and I don’t know how to deal with this. I haven’t slept in three nights. I really like you and you’re great, but I don’t know about this.”

My whole body went stiff. My heart shattered. I realized this is something I might have to go through again and again in my life.

For two days, we didn’t talk. I couldn’t eat, study, or sleep. I just kept thinking about her and what she said.

Then, a couple of hours ago, I called her. I was desperate to know how she was doing and whether she had thought about it more. She told me she realized she really did fall in love with me, but it was hard for her because she doesn’t understand much about what being trans means, and she’s scared. I completely understood that.

But then she said something that broke me:

“It’s just that I fell in love with a certain image of you. And then you told me it was all a lie, and you’re someone else.”

I know how this sounds. But let me explain.

My husband and I had been married for six years. Good years, mostly. He was patient, kind, did the dishes without being asked, remembered my coffee order. Boring stuff that I didn't appreciate until it was gone. We'd been arguing more lately. Nothing serious. Just stupid stuff about money and my mom staying with us too long and me working late.

Last Tuesday, we were fighting about my ex. My husband found old photos on my laptop from before we met. Pictures of me and my ex at concerts, on vacation, kissing in some bar. He got quiet, which was worse than yelling.

""Do you still think about him?"" he asked.

I should have said no. I should have reassured him. But I was angry about something, I don't even remember what now, and I wanted to win the argument. I wanted to hurt him.

""Sometimes,"" I said. ""He was exciting. You're just safe.""

My husband's face went blank. ""Safe?""

""Yeah. Predictable. He made me feel alive.""

""And I don't?""

I shrugged. This is the part I regret most. I looked right at him and said, ""If I could go back, I'd still marry him instead of you.""

He stared at me for a long time. Then he nodded once and walked upstairs. I thought he was going to cool off. Maybe sleep in the guest room like we did when fights got bad.

Twenty minutes later he came down with two suitcases and three garbage bags full of my clothes, shoes, makeup, everything.

""What are you doing?"" I asked.

""Taking you to him,"" he said. His voice was so calm it scared me.

""What?""

""You said you'd still marry him. So go marry him. I'm not keeping you here.""

I laughed. Actually laughed. ""You're being dramatic. I was just mad.""

""Get in the car.""

""I'm not going anywhere.""

He put my bags by the door and grabbed his keys. ""You can get in the car or I can call you an Uber. But you're leaving.""

I thought he was bluffing. But he opened the front door and started loading my stuff into his trunk. I followed him outside, still in my pajamas, trying to explain that I didn't mean it, that I was just being petty, that we should talk about this.

He didn't say a word. Just kept loading bags.

When he finished, he looked at me. ""Are you getting in or not?""

I got in. I don't know why. Maybe I thought he'd drive around the block and we'd talk it out. Maybe I thought he was testing me and I didn't want to fail.

He drove to my ex's apartment across town. I kept talking the whole way, apologizing, crying, saying I loved him, that I was stupid, that I didn't want my ex. He didn't respond. Didn't even look at me.

When we pulled up to my ex's building, my husband got out and started unloading my bags onto the curb. That's when panic actually hit me.

""Please,"" I said. ""Please don't do this. I was wrong. I'm sorry.""

""I know you're sorry,"" he said quietly. ""But I'm not safe. I'm not predictable. And I'm definitely not someone's second choice.""

""You're not. You're my first choice. I swear.""

He looked at me then. His eyes were wet but he wasn't crying. ""You told me you'd still marry him. That's not something you say to someone you love. That's something you say to someone you settled for.""

""I didn't settle.""

""Yeah, you did. And I'm done being your safe option.""

He put the last bag down and pulled out an envelope from his jacket. ""Divorce papers are being filed tomorrow. Don't contact me. Don't come to the house. My lawyer will reach out.""

I grabbed his arm. ""We can fix this. Marriage counseling. Anything. Please.""

He pulled away gently. ""Go ring his doorbell. See if he's as exciting as you remember.""

Then he got in his car and drove away.

I stood there on the curb for maybe ten minutes before I actually rang the bell. My ex answered in gym shorts and a stained shirt, looking confused.

""What are you doing here?"" he asked.

""Can I come in?""

He looked past me at the bags. ""Did you get kicked out?""

""My husband and I are separating.""

""Okay? Why are you here?""

That's when it hit me. He didn't want me there. Didn't ask if I was okay. Didn't offer help. Just stood in his doorway looking annoyed.

""I thought maybe I could stay here for a bit,"" I said.

""I have a girlfriend,"" he said. ""This is weird. You should call a friend or something.""

He literally closed the door in my face.

I called my best friend. She picked me up, let me stay at her place. Hasn't said much except that she warned me my husband was a good guy and I was taking him for granted.

My mom called me an idiot when she found out. Said she'd never seen a man treat me as well as my husband did and I threw it away over nothing.

I've texted him every day for the past week. He hasn't responded once. His lawyer sent papers yesterday. It's really happening.

I keep replaying that moment. When I said I'd still marry my ex. It took five seconds to say and it ended six years. The worst part is, I didn't even mean it. I was just trying to win an argument.

My ex was exciting because he was unpredictable and selfish and kept me guessing. My husband was safe because he was loyal and present and actually loved me. And I was too stupid to see that safe meant secure, not boring.

But is someone really supposed to throw away a whole marriage over one cruel thing said during a fight?

A glint came to the doctor’s eye. “Izuku Midoriya, you will be a hero.”","The last thing Izuku Midoriya remembered was seeing smoke come out of an apartment building as he was walking home from school. As he stood in front of the building he had heard a woman say that her child was still stuck inside! Naturally he had looked around to see if a Pro Hero was around to go back in but as far as he could see none had arrived yet.

He didn’t know what compelled him to go back in. Maybe it was his desire to be like All-Might, but all Izuku knew was that he had to get this child out of the fire, regardless of the cost. As he went deeper into the apartment he heard faint crying just above the roar of the inferno. He followed the sound until he reached a room where he heard the crying coming from a room where debris blocked the door. Using every ounce of strength in his weak arms, he managed to pull the debris from in front of the door and opened it. The child came out moments later, covered in ash and coughing badly. 

Izuku picked the child up and began to go back the direction he had come. Large chunks of debris had begun to fall as the building became unstable. He tried to move as quickly as possible to escape but out of the corner of his eye he noticed a giant plank above him come lose and in the few seconds he had to react he lightly tossed the child out of the way as a pile of burning rubble fell onto him. 

Then came searing pain as he could feel his skin catching fire and his fleshing cooking like his mother’s Katsudon.

The boy looked back at him, but using the last little bit of willpower he had Izuku yelled. “GO!”

The boy ran off out of sight and Izuku allowed a small smile to grace his face. At least he had proved Kacchan wrong: he had been a hero to someone after all. Even as he burned he kept that smile on his face. 

Then he blacked out.

What Izuku didn’t realize is that the boy had managed to escape just as heroes came onto the site and within minutes Death Arms pulled his badly burnt body and had him rushed to the hospital.

Soon all of Japan would hear of Izuku’s deed, including one Doctor Ryou Shingen who took a particular interest in Izuku’s story. 

Mere minutes after the story broke, his subordinate Sumire Takano came into his office.

“I know you’re thinking this Midoriya boy is perfect—“

“Sumire, we will never find a better candidate for Project Catalyst. Call the hospital, figure out his exact condition and request the boy’s parent for permission to enter him as a subject for our operation.”

Before he could finish a cup of coffee, Sumire had returned. 

“Ninety-two percent of the boy’s body has third degree burns. He’s lost three limbs, his vocal chords are gone—“

The doctor’s monotone voice interrupted. 

“Did the mother agree to the treatment?”

Sumire nodded.

A glint came to the doctor’s eye.

“Izuku Midoriya, you will be a hero, even if I have to rebuild you piece by piece.”

Ryou gave one final order.

“Have the boy transferred here, we have much to do if we wish to turn the boy into the hero our society needs.”



—


Then to his surprise, Izuku woke up again. The first person he saw was his mother. The woman gave him a hug but for some reason he couldn’t feel the same warmth he used to from her body.

“Hello Izuku.”

A strange man in a lab coat exclaimed as he walked into the room. “How are you feeling?”

“I was on fire, how did I survive?”

“Izuku—“

The doctor held a finger up to his mother who instantly went quiet.

“Yes, you were in a bad accident, my boy. Everyone in Japan had heard about your act of heroism despite your lack of quirk. By traditional means of medicine you were beyond saving, but the people here at Aegis were not content to let an upstanding member of our society with a bright future die because he wanted to help others. You were the first subject of a project that could change the world.”

The green haired teen looked at the man with awe.

“You did all that to save me?”

The doctor smiled. “You have given Aegis far more than we could ever have hoped for, my boy.”

Izuku noticed his mother looked downtrodden as the man spoke. Then out of nowhere the doctor asked him the one question Izuku had never needed to think about the answer to in his entire life.

“Tell me, Izuku; do you want to be a hero?”

“M-Me? Well of course, but I have no quirk-there-must-be-so-many-more-worthy-candidates-than-me!”

The doctor’s smile didn’t wane even a little bit.

“Izuku, the procedure we put you through to save your life changed you. You must feel a little different, your nervous system is probably feeling dulled, correct? In order to save your life we had to remove the broken human mass and replace it with something sturdier.”

The green haired teen looked down at his body and failed to see any difference.

“That can’t be true! I can’t be some sort of—“

“Cyborg? Unfortunately my boy it was the only thing that could be done to save your life. We tried to maintain your appearance to allow you to fit in with society but the truth is that beneath that synthetic flesh you are something more than human. With the modifications you have now you can live out a relatively normal life, but if you agree to work with us at Aegis we have several further modifications that can make you into one of the greatest heroes in Japan—*no*, the world.”

The bespectacled man looked into Izuku’s eyes like he was staring into his very soul.

“You could live for thousands of years as the eternal symbol of heroism. All-Might is the Symbol of Peace, but he is only human. One day he will retire and Japan will suffer the consequences of putting all our eggs in one basket. You could bridge the gap between humanity and the future. You don’t have to eat, sleep, or feel pain. How does it sound to be a lasting Symbol of Justice?”

The man extended his hand to Izuku.

The boy seemed to consider the offer for a moment before reaching out and taking Ryou’s hand.

“What’s the plan?”

“First things first we have to give your body the hero modifications, but after that? How does going to UA sound?”

It sounded like everything Izuku ever wanted. A tiny voice in the back of his head asked a simple question.

*”But at what cost?”*

A quick Google search for the phrase returns tons of instances where people have been told this and had it screamed at them during various events. I can't help but feel that this phrase is extremely racist and hateful, as it is unambiguously a race-based invective intended to disparge people for the color of their skin and tell them that their feelings and words and invalid purely because of their race. However, despite this obvious conclusion, it is extremely pervasive on social media, in real life and among supposedly campaigning for ""anti-racist"" ideals.

I need to get something off my chest. It's come to my attention that a very, very vocal minority of you let's say a statistically insignificant 24.7% seem to have a real problem with my positive vibes and high-performance energy.

Look, I get it. It's not my fault that your power output is inversely proportional to your... uh... ""aerodynamic profile."" I see the downvotes on my Strava KOMs and my posts about my new 0.0001% stiffer seatpost. I see the anger. And I just want to say: I empathize.

You are already battling a massive biological handicap. I can only imagine the weird situations you get into, like when you're in the coffee shop after a ride and a girl laughs, and you have to pretend she's laughing at your friend's joke and not the barely visible bulge in your Rapha shorts. It must be so, so difficult.

But here's the real talk: getting mad at me doesn't increase your wattage or your... length. It just makes you like a yappy little Chihuahua trying to chase after a Ducati. ""Woof woof grrr my FD-R9200 isn't shifting smoothly!"" It's kinda sad, bro.

Instead of channeling all that negative energy into hating me, channel it into solutions. You could:

* **Buy a Dura-Ace groupset.** The sound alone adds 10mm of psychological intimidation.
* **Get a new Cervélo.** A bike that expensive *has* to be a substitute for something, right? People will be so busy looking at your frame, they won't be looking at yours.
* **Become a billionaire.** Look at Jeff Bezos. Dude went from building rockets in his garage to... well, building bigger rockets. He clearly overcame a similar ""compact crankset"" situation early in his career.

Remember, even if your dick is a literal, anatomical shard of carbon fiber, there's a girl out there who will love you for your money and your ability to buy her a Pinarello Dogma. So why be a poor, angry guy with a smol peen when you can just be a rich guy with a smol peen?

It's simple physics. Less drag, more cash.

My fiancé’s parents and his sister will be in town this Thursday - Sunday. Thursday is just his sister, so dinner + drinks, Friday is family dinner, Saturday they’re doing a trapeze class (I’m fresh out of an injury so no) and then Jerry Seinfeld’s standup show (which I kindly said no thank you, so they’re doing that as a family) so they asked if I could come up with a plan for Sunday. His sister leaves midday so I’m thinking breakfast somewhere fun to see her off, and I want to go upstate. 
Any cool day trip upstate places to go? Is Sleepy Hollow slammed right now? I’m just a bit over the “walk around the city until it’s time to eat” plans we make so I’m trying to shake it up. Maybe some cute coffee and a nice dinner with fall leaves and fresh air. Gentle hikes are ok, dad has a tricky back (which makes me seriously wonder about trapeze) they’re relaxed good people and open to anything, but love good food and drink.

I’m planning a birthday date for my boyfriend, and since we’re both kinda new to the city, I thought it’d be fun to spend the day exploring the Fort area for the first time.

Would love some good brunch café suggestions - somewhere with great food, solid coffee, and a calm/peaceful vibe. I’ve heard of The Nutcracker, The Banyan Tree, Zen Café, and Nandan Coffee (though I’ve heard it’s a bit overrated).
Totally open to café hopping too; maybe brunch at one and coffee at another.

Also looking for things to do / places to explore around the area - maybe some heritage spots, cool bookstores, or hidden gems you personally love. In case y’all know any plays that we can watch, pls do mention since he likes theatre/plays.

Planning to head to Nariman Point for sunset after that.

For dinner, I was thinking Americano and Oh Dough for dessert, but if there’s a nicer or more romantic dinner spot you’d recommend, please let me know!

1ochzew,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ochzew,How I Built PromptBank: The AI-Powered Bank That Lets You Yell at Your Money (And It Listens),"Hey there, fellow tech enthusiasts, frustrated bankers, and anyone who's ever screamed at a frozen ATM screen. I'm the guy behind PromptBank, a wild project that's basically what happens when you mash up ChatGPT, a blockchain wallet, and your grandma's piggy bank. Imagine a bank where you don't need an app, a PIN pad, or even pants (okay, maybe pants are still recommended). You just type (or speak) a prompt like ""Yo bank, transfer $50 to my buddy for that pizza I owe him,"" and boom—it happens. Securely, fraud-free, and with a dash of DeFi magic. If you're a hiring manager at a fintech startup or xAI, keep reading; this project's my love letter to innovative engineering, and I'd love to bring that energy to your team.
Let me back up. It all started when I got tired of traditional banking apps that feel like they're designed by sadistic puzzle masters. ""Enter your 16-digit code, wait for SMS, spin three times, and pray to the fintech gods."" Nah, dude. As a prompt engineer with a background in n8n automations and AI workflows (I've built helpdesk bots, job app agents, and even architectural rendering pipelines), I thought: Why not make banking as easy as chatting? Enter PromptBank—the all-AI bank where prompts rule everything. 

The Core Idea: Banking on Prompts

At its heart, PromptBank is a fully AI-driven bank where every action—from checking balances to international transfers—is done via natural language. No menus, no buttons, just ""Hey Grok, show my spending on coffee this month"" (shoutout to xAI for inspiration). The AI agent (built with Grok-like reasoning) parses your intent, extracts details (amounts, accounts, payees), and executes. But here's the funny part: I made it so smart that if you say ""Send $20 to Alice for that awkward date,"" it logs it under ""Entertainment"" category. Because, let's be honest, that's what it was.
To make it work, I used a session-based authentication system—log in once with your UserID and password, and you're good for 30 minutes (or until you ""logout"" like a responsible adult). No re-entering creds every prompt; that's annoying, right? And for roles, clients can only mess with their own money (no peeking at Bob's beer fund), while managers get a god-mode chat for overseeing the whole bank—approving loans, viewing audits, or even creating accounts.

Security: Because Hackers Are the Real Villains

Now, security isn't sexy, but in banking, it's everything. I didn't skimp here. Every transaction goes through a dual logging system: one for financial records (transactions entity) and one for audits (every single action, from logins to ""oops, insufficient funds""). Think of it as a black box recorder for your money—complete traceability.
But the real hero is the Fraud Detection AI Agent Tool, a custom AI I built as a gatekeeper. No transaction happens without it scanning for red flags: unusual amounts, weird timing, new payees. It scores risks (low/medium/high) and explains like ""Dude, $500 at 2AM to a sketchy wallet? That's sus—confirm or cancel?"" If high risk, it blocks and alerts. I even made it explainable AI, so users know why, building trust. Funny story: During testing, it flagged my own ""buy 100 coffees"" prompt as fraud. Turns out, my caffeine addiction looks suspicious.
For extra layers, I integrated Cloudflare for DDoS protection, WAF rules to block injections, and bot management—because no one wants a robot army stealing your crypto. And speaking of crypto...

DeFi and Blockchain: The Futuristic Twist

To make PromptBank ""Web3-native,"" I added hybrid fiat-crypto ops. ""Convert $100 to ETH and stake it"" – the AI handles conversions with Chainlink oracles for real-time prices, executes on Ethereum Sepolia testnet (via Web3.js and Infura), and logs the on-chain hash in your off-chain records. No real money in demos, of course—safety first. 
The unique bit? AI-optimized DeFi suggestions. The agent analyzes your transaction history to build a risk profile (conservative saver? Aggressive trader?) and suggests stuff like ""Based on your low-risk vibe, auto-stake in a stablecoin pool for 5% APY?"" It's like having a robo-advisor that's actually fun and not pushy. I tied it into n8n workflows for automation, making it scalable.

Multi-Modal Magic: Talk, Snap, Bank

Because typing is so 2023, I added voice banking (speech-to-text for commands) and image uploads (snap a check, ""Deposit this $100""). The AI parses voice with recovery (""Did you say $50 or $15?"") and OCRs images for details, all while running fraud checks. It's inclusive—great for visually impaired users—and funny when it mishears ""transfer to Alice"" as ""transfer to Dallas."" (Yes, that happened in testing.)

Why This Project Screams ""Hire Me""

Look, I'm not just throwing code at walls. As a prompt engineer, I crafted the AI agent to be smart, human-like (with witty responses), and secure. Using n8n for backend automations, Cloudflare for ironclad protection, and blockchain for DeFi, PromptBank isn't a toy—it's a proof-of-concept for the future of banking. It's open-source on GitHub (with a README explaining no-real-funds demos), and I've tested it with simulated attacks (Cloudflare blocked 'em all).
If you're building fintech at xAI, Coinbase, or anywhere, imagine what I could do for your team: AI agents that scale, integrate DeFi securely, and make users laugh while keeping hackers crying. Let's chat—I promise not to make you authenticate every message.

Eli didn’t know how to start a real conversation anymore. Every thought he had came pre-formatted like a caption box waiting for hashtags.  
 When he looked at people, he saw metrics: likes, shares, engagement. Even his laughter came with an algorithmic delay, as if he were waiting for validation from an invisible audience.

Once, years ago, Eli had a blog. He wrote about strange dreams, favorite coffee spots, and the silence of early mornings. People commented with words, not emojis. They linked to him from their own pages. It felt like being part of a living web messy, unpredictable, human.

Then came the platforms.  
 They offered ease. Free hosting. Endless reach.  
 He moved his words there, like everyone else.

But over time, something shifted. His posts became shorter. His tone sharper. His ideas, safer. The algorithms didn’t reward reflection they rewarded reaction. He learned to speak in soundbites that could travel farther than his truth ever would. The web stopped feeling like a conversation and started feeling like a performance.

Now, when Eli opens an app, it greets him with headlines chosen “for you,” friends chosen “for you,” even moods chosen “for you.”  
 He scrolls past the lives of others, all optimized for attention. He tries to remember when connection wasn’t owned by a platform. When it didn’t need a login.

One night, he stumbles onto something strange: a site that asks him to *choose an instance*.  
 No “Sign in with Google.”  
 No “Connect with Facebook.”  
 Just a quiet box, waiting for him to decide where he belongs.  
 It feels foreign but also, familiar. Like the early days of the web he barely remembers.

He smiles. For the first time in years, he types something not for the algorithm, not for the brand, but for himself:

“Is anyone here just… human?”

A minute later, someone replies:

“Always. That’s the point.”

And for a moment, Eli feels what the internet once promised not followers, not reach, but **connection**.

I now have a 700+ day world with a mega- base spanning all 3 DLCs (with the main area in ROG). Here are some random late game thoughts I have had:

Stating the obvious, coffee is essential. If you have a SW enabled world, you need coffee

There is no difference between day and night. I used to be afraid of leaving my campfire at night, now I just grab a lantern or miners hat and keep playing like nothing changed. Campfires are only used for cooking and heat 

Furthermore, if you make some of the hamlet streetlights, you have infinite light throughout your base

After messing with several different hound defenses (houndius shhotius, traps, elephant cactus, etc.), building hamlet guards in a small area has worked the best for me. 

Hamlet Hedges are unbreakable fences that monsters can't attack. I have a spider farm with spiders trapped by hedges and elephant cactus on the other side. Works perfect

A dripple pipe negates wildfires in summer. No reason to build a bunch of fling-o-matics

I only make gold tools. Gold is easily renewable with monster meat, birdcage, and the pig king. Flint is not.

Just repeating this, flint isn't (easily) renewable. Neither are rocks or nitre. Nitre has lots of random uses (hedges and gunpowder), and can become a limited resource fast

The Vortex Cloak is a must have item

Also, there are way too many bugs on the switch version of the game but it really is a shame.

I´ve been working for the same company for over a decade, always had a great work relationship with everyone. It has been a second home, and people there have always treated me right so far. I can say that it has been until this point an extremely positive work experience.

I am regarded as a good employee. Always had praise for my actions, my atitude and my general conduct at work and with my colleges. I´ve been promoted several times through the years though the merit of my work, have won several national and international awards for my industry (that I wish to remain anonymous at this time). And I´ve proven myself over the years to be extremely reliable. 

This all changed at the start of this year with the exit of my direct supervisor. He left in good terms but without anyone to immediately replace him I´ve taken, together with another supervisor, the role of managing the day to day of the more junior members of the team, as well as to do a lot of individual work that would require a senior person with no direct supervision. 

This was something that before the departure of my supervisor I was already doing in an indirect role, and asking me to take this responsibilities was pretty much me doing what I was doing before, except now in an oficial role. 

My new manager comes in three months ago and I could tell that we weren't exactly a matching pair. Nothing wrong with it, and I had worked in the past with management that I had a different mindset than me, and a different approach to my work output with great success so I was confident that we could reach a good working relationship with time when he saw that I am capable person. 

The only thing that I stepped my foot was that I had reached a point in my career that a certain level of autonomy was expected and given my past record I would expect that to be respected. I would stay under him in a strict hierarchy, would still consult him for the most important work, but the day to day regular run of the mill work would be delivered as I did before with no direct supervision. This would save both of us time, and at the same time and more importantly it would keep me in a position that I could still keep creative control of my work and assure my career progression in due time.

I previously discussed this with my other direct manager before his arrival, so I expected this to be a non issue ... except it was the complete fracture of our work relationship on the very first week he arrived. 

My work started to be scrutinised beyond what would even be logical to a very junior employee. My every creative decision was put into question, sometimes in very public ways infront of the rest of the team that works with me, and it was made clear that nothing that I delivered would reach a client without his direct approval. 

This was soul crushing, but in my mind I saw it as a challenge of sorts, something that I could probably overcome by doing what I do best: work hard, be extremely focused on what I delivered, review everything for any sort of possible mistake, and deliver everything on time.   
  
Somehow this consistent pressure turned into silence, then into getting me bumped for my work to be reviewed every day at almost the end of the day forcing me into long wait times during work hours and staying late to do changes that sometimes felt they were petty and out of context. I still endured.

I talked to my other supervisor, that has been working with me for almost day one that I am at the company and he did admit that he didnt agree with his ""partner"" management style, but he wasnt in a position to interfere directly unless I really wanted to escalate things. This made em feel alone and unheard, and above all that his own position in the company was probably more frail than I expected. 

The last escalation on this story happened yesterday. I start my Monday with a call of HR telling me that I should meet her for a coffee and have a chat. I was prepared for the worst ... I just didnt know that the worst was not the worst thing that was about to fall onto me. 

This new manager made a set of official complains about me. Stuff that is hard to explain without being way to precise and exposing way more than I am comfortable, but suffice to say its career ending accusations. The HR lady was warning me informally that he was being advised to rethink his position and that she was worried about me since she never saw that coming and felt 100% stuff that I would never do. Worst thing is the accusations are extremely hard to disprove, it would essentially take a full on criminal investigation and a court of law declaring that client held confidential documents be released for me to even start to prove my inocense. 

I am completly broken. I am almost 40 years old with a briliant career so far. I did everything right that I could, I never ever comited any sort of wrong doing in my work, let alone something so severe, and now my only options are to see my reputation be thown to the gutter or face a long process at a court of law to even try to clean my name. 

Even if somehow I can discredit this, I will never be hired by anyone in my work line. Everyone knows everyone and a severe accusation from one of the most respected professionals in my country in this way and form is basicly a death sentence for my career. 

I am ofc already talking to a lawyer, trying to secure all the possible data that I can legally get from my work hard drive that would prove my point. Backing up all my emails and comunication and everything that I can do legally, yet I was already advised that unless company clients voluntarily accept to let a cout of law inspect confidential documents that the chances of proving my inocense is very low. 

And the worst part is I just dont know why this is happening to me. I didnt do anything to merit this, nor my intentions at any moment were nothing but the best towards everyone in this story. I am getting my career destroyed and with it my entire efforts of the last 20 years because someone somehow is against me and he doesnt even tell me why. 

I am expecting sometime in this week that I will get an oficial call to HR to discuss my departure from the company, or some sort of ""deal"" that I leave my position without any sort of compensation in exchange for letting this go quietly. In fact the entire conversation that I had with the HR lady felt like she was trying to ask me forgiveness to whats to come and giving me a heads up that this was coming.

1ochsb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKParenting/comments/1ochsb2/hit_a_complete_wall_on_mat_leave/,Hit a complete wall on mat leave,"My daughter just turned 5 months and as much as I love her, I’ve hit a complete wall on mat leave.

I feel like every day is the fucking same. I get up; feed, change and get baby ready; sterilise pumping stuff; pump; get myself ready; take the dog for a walk if our dog walker isn’t here, if she is coming spend lunch with my husband/baby; feed and change baby; maybe go out for a coffee with baby; come back and sort dog out; feed and change baby; have an hour with baby until my husband finishes work; walk dog; have tea; go to bed.

Weekday, weekend, doesn’t matter it’s all the same. I do a playgroup on a Wednesday morning with my antenatal class friends but it’s a good 30-40 minute drive from my house and honestly it just feels like another chore i have to fit in a lot of the time. It’s just yet another baby thing where I have to talk about baby shit with people I don’t reealllly know for an hour or two.

I am starting to resent my husband for being at work and I am really missing my job. He gets to choose to have breaks - like go downstairs and take 15 mins to make a coffee - speak to other adults, go into the office, even take a day or week off etc.

When’s my break? When’s my day off? I’ve done all the overnights since the day she was born, including recovering from a C section under general anaesthetic. Cos I’m on mat leave I do pretty much everything baby - I’m sorting out her nursery, taking her to play groups, pumping/feeding, doing all the overnights, learning how to do the next stage (so will be learning how to wean her etc). My whole life atm is baby whereas my husband still has a job and an adult life for most of the day, completely separate from our daughter.

He gets 8 hours in his office at home physically alone or going to the office at work. My time is ALWAYS with baby, dog and/or husband - even when I wake up in the night I have to see to my baby. I can count on one hand the amount of hours I’ve actually spent in a room alone. We don’t have any family near us so it is literally me and then I share it with my husband when he’s not working. I don’t have anyone who can come round and have my baby for a few hours, ever.

My husband says to ask for help or to tell him what I need. The problem is I have no idea what to even fucking ask for. He works so he’s physically just unavailable during that time - he’s doing his bit too. I am breastfeeding so the maximum I can realistically go alone is 3 hours, or 6 if we defrost some milk for her to have a bottle.

I’m desperate to just fuck off for a few days and not speak to or see anyone tbh. I’m honestly fantasising about putting baby in nursery and going back to work so I get some time physically alone, or speaking to other adults about shit that ISN’T baby. Getting to go downstairs and make myself a cup of tea or even have a shower without rushing because baby is crying when she’s been put down. Not having to hold her to feed her every 3 hours like clockwork.

I honestly just want to tell everyone, including my husband, to just fuck the fuck off and leave me alone 😂 I am so fucking bored. And the thing I feel guiltiest about is that my baby is a really happy, easy baby - she doesn’t really have meltdowns, she sleeps well outside needing feeds, we’ve had zero feeding problems etc. She’s literally a dream baby. And I still have weeks like this week where I fucking hate maternity leave.",12,1761064502.0,UKParenting,20,0.88,False

MFFAIS doesn’t do that.

We don’t care about categories, history, or where you *already* spent money. That’s the past — you can’t fix it.

Instead, MFFAIS always looks **forward**.

We take what matters — your **income**, **bills**, and **current bank balance** — and show you what’s left to spend *without breaking future you.*

Think of it like weather forecasting for your wallet.

If it’s going to rain (aka go negative), you’ll know before you step outside.

No linking to banks. No tracking every penny.

1ochmfb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ochmfb/my_best_friend_is_in_love_with_me_and_she_keeps/,"My best friend is in love with me, and she keeps on vanishing","This story might bug some people A LOT, and I'd just like to ask you not to demonise my best friend. I know this might be a difficult situation to understand, and for some, it will certainly be very difficult to empathise with her. I want you to hear this story and not jump to conclusions about her being a bad person. I've been meaning to talk about this for a while, but avoided it because I was afraid of people judging her.

I'm 21F. I met my best friend, 39F, around 3 years ago. Initially we were both part of an online community, and besides a few public interactions, we didn't interact in private. Over time though, I developed this feeling that she'd become a really good friend of mine. We were really similar in a lot of ways. One day, we started talking in private -- what really got us to bond was when I was going through a very rough time and she offered to listen. We started getting closer, talking about random things, but also being there for each other, supporting one another. It was really special. We went through some really rough times together.

We were both incredibly lonely at the time, struggling with depression and neurodivergence (I'm autistic, she has ADHD). I would always tell her how it was always my biggest dream to have a lovely friend group, people among whom I could belong. I would do my best to find those people, but failed every time. She was there supporting me. I'd also tell her about crushes on girls I had, and she'd listen and everything.

We would exchange letters, packages, postcards -- a way to cross the distance that separated us. When I was 20, and she was 38, though, something kind of changed. We fell for each other. It was a bit gradual, but the feelings we shared were so strong. We were so clearly in love, but couldn't do anything about it. We stayed friends. We did become VERY affectionate with each other -- unless we called that evening, we'd text each other very beautiful goodnight messages. What is important for you to know is that we never got sexual. Even when we were feeling this way, we kind of mutually agreed without stating it outright that even telling each other that we want to kiss is a no no. It was all about hugs and cuddles and shared breakfasts and tea or coffee together, or walks around the park, etc. I actually remember two occasions when I kind of tried to initiate something a bit sexual, but she said no.

Sometimes it was really hard. She had phases during which she'd blame herself a lot over the fact that she was much older. The age gap haunted us for a long time.

In all of this though, I was still hoping to make friends in person. I was, and still am, going to uni. I met a girl in february of this year and we got a bit closer and eventually i developed a bit of a crush on her. This kind of destabilised what I had with my friend. Things hadn't been the same since then. At one point, we agreed that our overly friendly friendship had to end, and we just had to be platonic. It was insanely hard, lots of crying and sleepless nights.

That crush went nowhere though. In July, I went to a concert, to see my favourite band, Black Country New Road. I went alone, it was a small event. There I met a guy, at the time 23 now 24. I'll try to be brief about this, but I stayed in touch with him after the concert. He fell for me, and eventually I fell for him too. We just clicked so well. It happened a bit fast, but I think it was the right pace. After we met, we spent a lot of time together. At first, we were just friends, and it was great and everything I ever wanted, but as I said, I fell for him too. And now we're together. I'm really, really happy with him. I'm actually at his place as I'm writing this.

He makes me feel so loved, our time together is really wonderful. He's super supportive and so on. The thing is, while that crush for the girl made my friend feel really bad, this relationship made her spiral and I don't know what to do.

My boyfriend and I don't live in the same city, but whenever I visit him or whenever he visits me, my best friend disappears. She won't reply to texts, she'll be gone for days. I text her daily, but she just won't reply, and then when I'm back, I have to call her phone number to get a reply, and even then I'm not certain if I will. Sometimes she'll disappear when I say something. This time she disappeared because, I think, I decided to spend the weekend at my bf's after getting bad news about an important surgery I have to get. I just needed some physical comfort, some cuddles and some warmth. On Saturday, I also decided to take half a dose of my antidepressants because I'm running out and can't get more because I'm currently not covered by national healthcare, it's a whole mess. I wanted to avoid being alone at home (I live on my own) in case the new dose wouldn't be enough (in the past, whenever i'd forget a dose, I'd end up doing SH or having suicidal breakdowns). 

In the past, for things like these, I would have stayed with her. But now I felt like I did something really wrong, but then I thought -- whenever she decides to go away because she's struggling with something, I have to be understanding, at least I feel like I have to. Before I told her I'd be gone this weekend, which was a decision I made last minute since my medical appointment was on Thursday, she disappeared a few days before because of a postcard I sent her a few months ago (it had only arrived last week). At the time of writing it, I wasn't in a relationship with my bf yet, and it was really affectionate and all. She told me she got my postcard, and I asked what she thought of it. She said she'd rather not talk about it. She told me not to worry about it, even though I wanted to know what it was, if I said something rude, if it wasn't thoughtful enough, if she didn't like the picture on the postcard (I chose one that I thought was perfect for her, and super cute). After this she vanished for a bit. My bf tried to support me and told me that if she can disappear like this, then so should I be able to go whenever I need to. It's not like I wouldn't be available to chat for a second or two -- I wouldn't want to disappear altogether. 

She has this fear that I'll distance her, that I'll cut her off from my life. I'd never want this. She's my best friend and I still love her very much. I'd never do that to her. Our friendship means too much to me. I cherish it so deeply. Ever since things started going down, I was the one who tried to take the lead and make sure we stayed afloat. I didn't want us to grow distant and for the friendship to end. But I feel like she's doing the opposite. I don't think it's on purpose. I know she's like this, she runs away as soon as a relationship that is meaningful to her is unstable. But if she wants us to stay together, then why avoid me like this. It's heartbreaking. 

I don't really know what to do. Her birthday is coming up this week. I want us to celebrate together (as I said, she's alone, she doesn't have anyone to celebrate it with), but she still won't reply. I want us to be happy together again. I don't want there to be all this tension. It makes me so fucking sad. It's ok if she doesn't want to hear about my bf, I get it (ever since we got together, I basically couldn't share anything -- when I told her I had my first kiss with him, which was my first kiss ever, a very important moment to me, she got really really depressed, and almost mad). I want us to be friends again, like we were.",1,1761064125.0,Advice,5,1.0,False
