But the exact amount can vary based on several factors, including cup size and serving standards.**

Coffee lovers often wonder about the precise measurement of their favorite brew. While an 8-ounce cup is commonly accepted, many coffee shops use different standards. Some serve in larger cups, others in smaller ones. Understanding these variations can help you make better choices.

Whether you’re brewing at home or ordering at your local café, knowing how many ounces are in a cup of coffee ensures you get the right amount to kickstart your day. Let’s delve deeper into the world of coffee measurements and discover the factors that influence cup sizes. This knowledge will enhance your coffee experience, making each sip more enjoyable.

# Coffee Measurement Basics

Do you ever wonder how many ounces are in a cup of coffee? Understanding coffee measurements can make a big difference in your brewing experience. Whether you’re a casual drinker or a coffee enthusiast, knowing the basics helps you get that perfect cup every time. Let’s dive into the essentials of coffee measurement.

# Fluid Ounces Explained

Fluid ounces are a measure of volume. They tell you how much liquid is in a container. In the US, one fluid ounce equals about 29.57 milliliters. When you brew coffee, it’s essential to know the amount of liquid you’re using.

Here are some key points about fluid ounces:

* **1 US cup** = 8 fluid ounces
* **1 tablespoon** = 0.5 fluid ounces
* **1 teaspoon** = 0.1667 fluid ounces

For coffee, the standard measurement is usually in cups. But knowing fluid ounces helps with precision. If you’re using a coffee maker, it might have measurements in cups. These cups often refer to 6 fluid ounces, not 8. This can be confusing.

To make it easier, remember:

* **1 cup of coffee** (standard) = 6 fluid ounces
* **1 cup of water** = 8 fluid ounces

Using the right amount of water and coffee grounds ensures a balanced brew. Too much or too little water can change the taste. Measuring your coffee precisely gives you the best results every time.

# Volume Conversions

Converting between different volume measurements can be tricky. But it’s important for making the perfect cup of coffee. Let’s break down some common conversions:

|Measurement|Fluid Ounces|Milliliters|
|:-|:-|:-|
|1 US cup|8 fl oz|237 ml|
|1 coffee cup|6 fl oz|177 ml|
|1 tablespoon|0.5 fl oz|15 ml|
|1 teaspoon|0.1667 fl oz|5 ml|

Understanding these conversions helps you adjust recipes. If a recipe calls for milliliters, you can convert to fluid ounces easily. This ensures you use the right amount of each ingredient.

For example, if a recipe needs 237 milliliters of water, you know this is equivalent to 1 US cup or 8 fluid ounces. This makes it easier to follow recipes and get consistent results.

Using a kitchen scale can also help. Weighing ingredients like coffee grounds ensures accuracy. Many scales can switch between grams and ounces, making conversions simple.

Getting your measurements right is key to brewing delicious coffee. Use these basics to make sure every cup is perfect.

# Standard Cup Size

Ever wondered how many ounces are in a cup of coffee? The answer depends on the standard cup size used in your region. Knowing the standard cup size helps you brew the perfect cup every time. Let’s dive into the details.

# Us Vs. Metric Cups

The US and metric systems use different measurements for cups. This can lead to confusion, especially for coffee lovers. Let’s break it down:

**US Cup:**

* 1 US cup equals 8 fluid ounces.
* Common in the United States and Canada.

**Metric Cup:**

* 1 metric cup equals 250 milliliters.
* Common in many countries outside the US.

1j35y80,https://www.reddit.com/r/hygiene/comments/1j35y80/toothpaste_recommendations/,Toothpaste recommendations?,"Hello! I (21F) am nearly out of toothpaste and looking for recommendations. I have bad teeth and regret not taking care of them as a kid. I want to take better care of them. I have some cavities that need filled, but I currently don't have dental insurance. I haven't seen a dentist in over a year, so I haven't gotten a professional clean. I don't want my cavities to get bigger until I can get them filled!

I have a handful of filled cavities, tartar, plaque, gingivitis (and/or receding gums?), discoloration (from brace marks, tartar, plaque, and calcification or something, otherwise my teeth are yellow). I had two teeth extracted on top for my braces. My wisdom teeth were removed in 2023. My teeth have grown more sensitive, it hurts to even eat a Kitkat now due to the chocolate. I don't drink pop, coffee, or chew gum, but I eat a lot of cheese and sugar.

I don't floss...however, I have a water pik and electric toothbrush that I need to set up. The past 3-5 months, I've brushed once a day, almost every day. I absolutely suck at brushing in the morning. I brush in small circular motions for the front. Back and forth for the tops (crowns?) of my teeth. I rarely use mouthwash because I hate mint and hate the burn. I brush my tongue too.

I'm looking for a toothpaste that can strengthen my enamel, prevent cavities, help with gingivitis, sensitivity, etc. Whitening is not a requirement. If it's mint, I'll deal with it. There's a white mint toothpaste I tried that didn't burn; I don't remember the name of it. Should I be rinsing with water after I brush? Is charcoal or purple toothpaste better? (I have purple, just haven't tried it yet). Should I try a flouride-free brand?

I've been thinking of trying Pronamel or something like that, but don't want to drop that much money yet. I struggle financially 😅 I hate my smile but still smile with my teeth anyway. It's just embarrassing. My dentist said the only way to improve my tooth appearance is veneers...any help or recommendations are appreciated, thank you!!",1,1741075501.0,hygiene,0,1.0,False

1j35wfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1j35wfw/wellamoon_sleep_patches_review_do_they_actually/,Wellamoon Sleep Patches Review: Do They Actually Work?,"I’ve had trouble sleeping for as long as I can remember. I’ve tried **melatonin pills, teas, white noise machines, and even blackout curtains**, but nothing really stuck. I’d either wake up multiple times in the middle of the night or feel completely drained in the morning.

A few weeks ago, I came across **Wellamoon sleep patches** and figured I’d give them a try. The idea of a **slow-release sleep patch** instead of taking pills was new to me, and I was curious to see if it would make a difference. I used **Wellamoon sleep patches** every night for a full month, and this is my full experience.

# What Are Wellamoon Sleep Patches?

The **Wellamoon sleeping patch** is a **transdermal patch** that delivers sleep-supporting ingredients through the skin over several hours. Instead of taking a melatonin pill that gets absorbed all at once, the patch releases ingredients gradually throughout the night.

Each **Wellamoon sleep patch** contains:

* **Melatonin (7mg)** – Helps regulate sleep-wake cycles.
* **Valerian Root (27mg)** – A natural herb often used for relaxation.
* **Hops (16.53mg)** – Known for its calming effects.
* **Magnesium Malate (41.32mg)** – Supports muscle relaxation and restful sleep.

To use it, you just **peel off the backing and apply it to a clean, hairless part of your body** like your forearm, shoulder, or thigh. The patch is meant to be worn overnight and removed in the morning.

For details, this is where I first read about it: [**Wellamoon Sleep Patches Info**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2J8ZH9TQ/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HealthProductsNatural)

# First Impressions and First Night

I was skeptical at first. A patch that helps you sleep better? It sounded too simple.

On the first night, I followed the instructions and applied the **Wellamoon sleep patch** about **30 minutes before bed**. I didn’t feel anything immediately, but after about **20 minutes, I started feeling more relaxed**. Not in a drowsy, heavy way—just a noticeable shift toward calmness.

Falling asleep was easier than usual, but the real surprise was waking up in the morning. I **slept through the night without waking up** once, which hadn’t happened in a long time. I didn’t feel groggy, which I usually do with melatonin pills.

# Week 1: Adjusting to the Patch

By the end of the first week, a few things became clear:

* **Falling asleep was faster and easier.** Instead of tossing and turning for an hour, I was asleep within **20 minutes** most nights.
* **I was waking up fewer times.** On nights when I used the **Wellamoon sleeping patch**, I stayed asleep longer.
* **No morning grogginess.** Unlike melatonin gummies that make me feel sluggish in the morning, I woke up feeling normal.

# Weeks 2-3: Consistent Sleep Improvement

After about two weeks, I started to notice **a more regular sleep pattern**. I was waking up at the same time each morning, and my energy levels during the day were improving. I wasn’t relying on coffee as much to get through the afternoon.

The biggest change was **feeling rested even on shorter nights**. Normally, if I only got 5-6 hours of sleep, I’d feel terrible the next day. But with the **Wellamoon sleep patch**, I felt more refreshed even when I didn’t get a full 8 hours.

# Week 4: Long-Term Thoughts

By the end of the month, **Wellamoon sleep patches** had become part of my routine. I didn’t use them every single night, but I found that even using them **3-4 times a week helped regulate my sleep cycle**.

Some things I noticed after a month:

* **Better sleep consistency.** My body started following a more natural schedule.
* **Deeper sleep.** I woke up feeling like I had actually rested, not just spent hours in bed.
* **Falling asleep became easier even on nights I didn’t use the patch.** It seemed like my body had adjusted to a healthier rhythm.

Of course, **not every night was perfect**. I still had nights where I woke up once or twice, but compared to before, my sleep was much better overall.

# Pros and Cons After a Month

**What I Liked:**

* Helped me **fall asleep faster** without making me feel knocked out.
* Reduced **middle-of-the-night wake-ups** over time.
* No side effects like morning grogginess.
* Easy to use—just apply and forget about it.
* Natural ingredients without artificial additives.

**What Could Be Better:**

* Some nights, I still woke up briefly, though much less often.
* Slight skin irritation when applied to the same spot too often.
* Results varied depending on how stressed or tired I already was.

# Final Thoughts: Would I Recommend Wellamoon Sleep Patches?

For me, the **Wellamoon sleep patch** worked well enough to keep using it. It **wasn’t a miracle cure**, but it helped me **fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, and wake up feeling more refreshed** than most other sleep aids I’ve tried.

If you have **mild to moderate sleep issues**, it’s worth considering. It’s especially helpful for anyone who doesn’t like taking pills or who wants something that works **gradually instead of all at once**.

If you have **severe insomnia**, this might not be a complete solution on its own, but it could still be helpful alongside other lifestyle changes.

1j35s7e,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1j35s7e/how_i_transformed_my_social_skills_and_resilience/,How I transformed my social skills and resilience,"A few years ago, I realized something: I wasn’t great at meeting new people. Whether it was talking to strangers at events, making new friends, or just starting a conversation with someone interesting, I always felt a little awkward. It wasn’t that I was anti-social - I just didn’t have the skills.

And if I’m being honest, part of me was afraid. What if they weren’t interested in talking? What if I got a weird look or a cold response?

So I did something extreme - I started pushing myself to talk to people everywhere. Not just at events or networking meetups, but on the street, in coffee shops, at bookstores. If someone seemed interesting, I challenged myself to say something.

At first, it was brutal. Some people were polite but clearly uninterested. Others gave short answers and moved on. And yeah, a few times, I got completely ignored.

It would’ve been easy to quit. And I almost did. But something told me to keep going.

**What I Learned from Hundreds of Conversations**

The more I did it, the more I realized that most people are open to conversation - if you approach them the right way.

I also realized why most people never even try:

* Fear of rejection  -  No one likes being ignored or brushed off.
* Social norms  -  We’re taught not to talk to strangers.
* Ego  -  It’s easier to pretend we don’t care than to risk looking foolish.

But once I stopped caring so much about how I was perceived and focused more on just connecting, things changed.

**The Unexpected Benefit: Resilience**

Something weird happened after months of doing this. I started noticing a change - not just in my ability to meet people, but in how I handled life in general.

Suddenly, a failed job interview didn’t feel like a big deal. An awkward social situation didn’t shake me. I had been rejected, ignored, and dismissed so many times that my brain just stopped registering it as a bad thing.

I realized that most people never build this kind of resilience. They avoid discomfort at all costs. But the truth is, learning how to connect with people - even when it’s hard - makes you mentally unbreakable.

**Why It’s Worth It**

Looking back, I’m grateful I stuck with it. The people I’ve met, the confidence I’ve built, and the ability to walk into any situation and hold my own - it’s been life-changing.

Most people avoid the discomfort of meeting new people because it’s hard. But the ones who push through? They become the kind of people who thrive in any social situation.

So if you ever feel like your social skills aren’t where you want them to be, or if the idea of talking to new people makes you nervous - good. Lean into it. Push through it. Because once you do, you’ll realize that most of the limits you thought were real were never actually there.",5,1741074767.0,getdisciplined,0,1.0,False

Price of coffee is skyrocketing. Thinking if yerba mate would be a good replacement. I'm trying to calculate price per cup as comparison. (Also the environmental impact of coffee farming is a question, but this post is only about price.)

I drink two mugs of coffee per day. 2 in the morning, 2 at lunch. Assuming I could replace that with yerba mate and get the caffeine I crave for.

From 500g of ground coffee, brewed by filtering, you get 65 cups. How about yerba mate? How many cups do I get from 500g? (I'm targeting at the same level of caffeine consumption.)

1j35ivp,https://www.reddit.com/r/sousvide/comments/1j35ivp/i_experimented_with_hundreds_of_dollars_of_steak/,I experimented with hundreds of dollars of steak so you don’t have to.,"A few years ago I set out to become better at making food/drinks at home. I accepted that spending a bunch of money on things like coffee, steak, and other more expensive foods would be worth it in the long run if I perfected them so that I could save money by making it at home when I craved it instead of a restaurant. 

My dad’s favorite dish has always been steak and although he isn’t regularly going to high end steakhouses every night, he has experienced them enough to have a high bar. 

Here are a few things that I learned along the way that surprised me. 

1. Freezing a steak turned out more tender once thawed and cooked than just putting a fresh steak into the sous vide.
2. 137 seems to be the ideal temperate that makes every party the most happy if you have guests with different preferences for doneness.
3. If your steaks are frozen, letting it thaw for 1-2 days in your fridge before you put it in the sous vide made it more tender than dropping it in from frozen. 
4. Extremely high heat wasn’t necessary to make a good crust. 
5. 3-4 hours is most ideal for bath time.

I have had every friend and family member that tried my steak say it is the best they ever had. This was particularly nice when my dad finally said it and now asks me to make him steak on his birthday instead of going out for it. 

My method is as follows:

I typically buy a rib section from a local store. You can often find sales at larger retailers around Christmas and July 4th for $5-$6 per pound. I cut these into the desired steak size and vacuum seal them. 

When I know I will want steak in a couple days, I take them out of the freezer and into the fridge for 2 days roughly. When it comes time to sous vide, I season them with just kosher salt generously on all sides. On a ribeye there is a little triangle piece that is mostly fat. I cut this off and set it aside. I drop the seasoned steak into a 137°F bath. I aim for 3-4 hours bath time. 

Once I’m ready to start the process of getting it ready to eat I put the steak into an ice bath. Typically it will stay in there for about 10 minutes. I’m really not rushed as the ice bath is meant to cool it down quite a lot. While it’s in the ice bath I grab my stainless steel skillet and put it on medium heat on the stove top. I grab that triangle piece of fat from earlier and throw it in the pan so it can render down and be the base of what I will sear the steak in. 

I remove the steak from the vacuum sealed bag and pat it dry the best I can. Then I put it into the pan. The pan isn’t ripping hot but it’s certainly hot enough to get a sear going with this liquid fat. Once I put the steak in the pan, I add butter to the pan as well. I count to 30 in my head before flipping the steak over. After 30 seconds I flip it again. Then after 30 more seconds on each side, I grab the steak with tongs and sear the edges all the way around. After this I drop it back into the pan and count to 20 for each side, then 15 for each side, then I finish off with flipping every 5-10 seconds until the crust looks exactly how I want it. 

Once I take the steak off the pan, I put a homemade compound butter on top of it so it will melt. The compound butter I use is 1 stick of salted butter, parsley, dill and garlic. I make this in advance then store it in the freezer. When I make steaks I take it out of the freezer and cut off thin little disks and that is what I melt on top of my steaks. 

I usually serve the steak with a salad and either mashed potatoes or corn on the cob. 

The process sounds more complicated than it actually is. It’s pretty simple when you do it once or twice. But this was also years and at least 50 steaks experimenting until I got it the exact way that I now like it every time. ",8,1741073582.0,sousvide,7,0.83,False

1j35gh0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1j35gh0/feeling_disconnected/,Feeling disconnected,"My wife (26F) and I (27M)) have been married for just over 5 years now with one kid (4yr). I have a solid career that pays well and she’s finishing up her doctorate program. She is very busy with school and working part time to the point where she’s working late hours at work, weekends, and whenever she’s home she’s doing school. I am grateful for how smart and accomplished she is but I feel like our relationship has no connection or intimacy. I attribute this to a few things: 

1. I feel like I do all the chores. I always do the dishes, trash, clean the counters off, laundry, etc. I can’t remember the last time I saw her deep clean anything or put her own laundry away. There’s piles of clothes that have been in our room for months. I try to communicate with her about taking care of it but she’s always defensive or annoyed that I ask. In reality, I’m just so exhausted and tired of cleaning up after her. Our 4 year old makes lots of messes and she doesn’t feel a need to clean them up. For instance he’ll spill yogurt on the floor and she won’t touch it. It’s always my responsibility or else it will sit for weeks until I just end up cleaning it 

2. All she talks about is work or school. I would like to take interest in her work or school and try to but wish we’d talk more about things we could do as a family, trips we want to take, life goals we are working towards, etc. 

3. She gets very angry at me all the time over small things. For instance, I cleaned our coffee machine out as it was caked in grounds and milk. She got so upset to the point of yelling at me for not filling it back up and how she has to do it every time. I ask her why these type of things upset her so much and she says she doesn’t know or that she’s just frustrated at me all the time. I ask how I can do better or not frustrate her but she says she doesn’t know. 

4. She doesn’t put forth any effort to plan dates, time to spend together, etc. For Valentine’s Day, I made us this steak dinner with a bottle of wine and got her a nice gift. She told me that she was too busy to get me anything. This really hurt my feelings because I just wanted to like I am also loved/appreciated as I’ve expressed many times I feel like I do a lot. I recently told her this and she told me that I needed to plan the dates and it was my responsibility. I told her I wanted us to plan things together and that it was both our responsibility to find ways to connect with each other. 

I’m just tired of feeling like I’m only here to be in a supportive role with no end in sight. We are in couples therapy and trying to work things out but both admit we are struggling with connection. About 6 months ago I found out she was lying to me about an emotional affair she was having with a coworker. That really screwed me up and I wish I would have just been done. 

The other problem also for me is I feel like we have changed so much. I had no idea that her passion was in working and our values were so different. I feel like she doesnt see things nearly in the same way as I do when it comes to finances, personal health, hobbies/interests, etc. 

At this point, I just feel so numb to the whole relationship. I don’t really want to try anymore because I don’t know what I’m trying for.

*Diary entry: 05/07/2105 Timestamp: 16:39*

Lily showed up at the apartment this morning, telling Gator and me about some “insane,” using her words, money to be made in selling old tech from the Shatterdome. I told her she was nuts right off the bat, but Gator’s dumbass had to open his big mouth and ask her questions. Of course, she took that as her cue to launch into parroting whatever speech the idiot she met at the bar last night gave her about the ""potential."" I was sitting there the whole time she was talking, thinking: ""No way. She wouldn’t go in there. We’re all from Vargos; we know people never come back from salvaging in the Shatterdome. She must be bugging out."" But no, she was serious.

I had to get all that out because, ultimately, I’m a hypocrite. I agreed. And now we’re supposed to head there in a couple of hours after night falls. I’m struggling for cash right now, and to her credit, even a piece of garbage in the Shatterdome is worth more than a week’s pay shoveling shit here in Iron Reach. I don’t want to get too excited, or encourage Lily to rope us into more dangerous things she hears about once and then decides to do, but if we can get just a few decent pieces of tech and maybe some data, I could quit my job tomorrow!

I’ll type up another entry here later, but let’s hope my next entry is just chatting about how I’m going to spend my fortune. If I go missing and any of my BRZY followers don’t see more posts soon, just know I went to the OlivewerX building in the eastern section of the Shatterdome. I know no cops are coming, but at least someone can grab whatever I couldn't leave with.

\-Bezel

*Diary entry: 05/08/2105 Timestamp: 23:18*

So first off, Lily was right. The tech we grabbed here is easily worth all of our personal chits plus every dollar I’ve ever made at the job ten times over. We got into the building no sweat, and after Gator blasted some old security drones down, we really got a lay of the land.

The OlivewerX building is wild. There are a lot of confusing hallways that don’t really seem to lead anywhere, but it’s hard to keep track with all the cool shit that’s here. We got a package of old test cell phones, a few external hard drives from the records department, a perfectly working laptop from under some old desk, and a vintage key fob for building entry with retro Fountainhead logos on it. If we sell this as a single haul, we’ll all have enough money to move out of Iron Reach. So all in all: Lily was right. This is a gold mine.

Now for the bad news–I was also right.

This place is weird as hell. The hallways that don’t go anywhere never seem exactly the same. Every time we go down one we’ve been through before, something’s different. We walked down a hallway with six doors at one point. When we turned back, there were seven. 

We kept walking through this one with weird purple lines painted on the sides, and when we turned around at a dead end and went back, the paint was green. I pointed it out, but Gator and Lily told me I was imagining things. They both said it was green before. Look, I know I could be wrong, but I’m telling you, I’m not. I’m certain it was purple.

Then we found a place to camp for the night since we can’t find the way we came in, and we set up a little spot around a warmer lamp in the right corner office of the floor we were on–floor 17, according to the signs. I left the room to take a leak, came back, and the whole camp was set up in the corner office two floors up from where we were. I didn’t tell them this time because I didn’t want them to think I was seeing shit, but every sign said 19, and I swear to you, we were on floor 17.

I gotta crash now, but it’s honestly hard to fall asleep when it’s this quiet. I’m used to traffic noise, ventilation, something. This is Vargos. What kind of place is this quiet in the city?

I’ll write tomorrow. Hopefully, by then, we’ll be out of here.

\-Bezel

*Diary entry: 05/09/2105 06:22*

Gator’s gone.

Woke up, and Lily was still passed out with her travel pillow on her head, but Gator’s spot was empty. I called for him a ton, didn’t hear a damn thing. There’s not even scurrying noises from rats in here. It’s still quiet as shit. It was so quiet I could hear my own breathing.

I woke Lily up, and we went looking for him, but after we climbed five floors and the signs said floor 38, I refused to go any further. Even Lily admitted we only went up five floors, so at least now I know for sure–I’m not imagining this.

We gave up looking for him and got back to camp, and wouldn’t you know it?

There’s nothing there.

Not a fucking thing.

We found a new place to try and sleep tonight on floor 28, which looked exactly like floor 38 we’d been in earlier, but hey, why bother caring? Clearly, this place can’t make up its mind.

No warmer lamp. No travel pillows. No sleeping bags. No food. No water. Just whatever dusty office equipment we can find, and silence for company.

Lily keeps shoving the pillow over her head, and I don’t know why. There’s no noise to block out.

She keeps whispering. I thought she was reciting numbers, but when I listened closely, I swear I heard my own name. And she was laughing a bit when she said it, only for a second. Then she was quiet again.

If she loses it here, I’m striking out on my own.

I need to get out of here ASAP.

\-Bezel

*Diary entry: 05/10/2105 Timestamp: 21:40*

We’ve been stuck in this old office building for two days, and I’m pretty sure Lily is losing her mind.

It’s been nonstop with her, she won’t stop talking about the speakers in the wall.

What fucking speakers?

This whole place is quiet. And I mean eerily quiet. It’s like the world outside doesn’t exist anymore even when I can see through the boarded windows. It’s like the building is holding its breath. I heard my own stomach growling this morning when we were walking back through the halls. 

I don’t want to start this entry off on such a sour note, but there’s no one else to talk to.

Gator’s still missing, and I’m not about to waste any calories searching through empty hallways trying to find him. He’s a big boy, definitely can handle himself. Not a thought in that head of his, but at least he’s a tough guy to take down.

After our walk this morning, I went to look for an old vending machine or something, and she ran up and started hitting it.

I mean, she was wailing on this thing. Her hands are all fucked up now. We had to bandage them–she can barely move her fingers. I think she might have broken something.

I managed to find one of those old coffee dispensing machines, and it spat out something that could charitably be called toilet water, but it did have a reservoir of clean-ish water in the back, so I snagged that for us.

She won’t drink any of it, though. She keeps just talking about the speakers and saying we need to break into the system.

She insists that’s our only way out, but I don’t want to mess around with whatever security protocol is still running in this place. The district might be old, but it was definitely functional when those systems started including lethal bots.

And with no Gator here, we don’t have a gun. Or any other weapon. We don’t even have a pot to piss in.

I’ll sign back on later.

Just you and me now diary. I got you as an auxiliary program with this neural interface package and at the time I thought you were kind of a dumb application. But I can’t even express how glad I am to have you now.

I woke up and Lily was gone. 

The pillow was still here though, and good thing because if she was covering her ears with it I’ll need to do the same because the noise from the walls is so loud at night. It’s just this muffled talking like there’s people in the next room but even when I go and check to see if I can find where the noise is coming from I always just end up in some random empty room. 

I decided I’m going to try and log in to the next office computer I find and see if there’s a map or something of the building in there so I can find my way out. 

Sick of this shit.

\-Bezel

*Diary Entry: 05/11/2105 Timestamp: 17:38*

Bad idea. Bad idea. I found a computer and tried to log in, and as soon as I got past the firewall, I was greeted by some fun pictures.

You know the kind, right?

How about candid stills from security cameras with scared faces of other people who have raided this building?

Or maybe audio recordings of people just doing some kind of construction work? I’m going to guess that explains some of the weird, torn-up walls I’ve run into walking through here.

Or, if you like, thousands of files labeled ""pay data,"" with no security code attached to them?

Kind of on the nose, right?

Yep. Very on the nose, because when you open them, it’s just security stills of me, Lily, and Gator walking through these hallways.

Lily and Gator seem fine, at least... but sometimes, in the photos, I can see them looking into the camera lenses with eyes way larger than should be humanly possible.

I threw up bile after all that.

I can’t keep walking around this place.

I’m going to starve and dehydrate before I ever find a way out.

I keep hearing the speakers through the walls, and the weird, random chatter has started to repeat something every few minutes.

The noise cuts through real clear–

""All networks. All fun. All Being.""

It’s a stupid phrase from some promotional material, I think. All Being was the program OlivewerX released that put them on the map in the first place.

Not sure what they did with it after they got acquired by Violet... but if it’s still running in here, maybe I can get a chat open and get it to find me an exit?

Might as well try.

1j35csg,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1j35csg/the_maths_isnt_mathsing/,The maths isn't mathsing...,"Around the end of last year, I decided I was going to try and lose some weight. I've had two babies in the last four years and had been maintaining at a higher weight than I'd like. 

So I cut calories where I could, started exercising and lost a few pounds, but found I gained anything back over the weekend. I don't find it difficult to reduce calories overall, but I love a drink on the weekend, and this was undoing any kind of actual loss, so I decided to get serious and stop this all together in the middle of January. 

I dropped my daily calories to 1200, and started running 4 times a week. I then began adding another 30 minute workout in once I got home and adding in extra steps wherever I can. 

I weigh food and tend to stick to the same things each day, so I can be sure it's accurate. Food is generally protein (chicken, pork, eggs) and vegetables. Don't drink my calories, it's water or instant coffee with no sugar. No snacking between meals. I've had two cheat days since I started, which were both around my birthday. I was still aware of what I was eating and drinking. 

So I've stopped snacking, cut my calories down to 1200, committed to running and doing bodyweight exercises 4-5 days a week, stopped drinking on the weekend. 

And my reward after sticking to this for 9 weeks? A 3lb loss, off my highest post Christmas weight, which was probably mostly water. Libra is actually showing a gain. I've just finished my period which might account for some current water weight, but I'm not confident that I'm going to get a sudden whoosh now it's over. 

My TDEE is 1939. Without exercise, I'm undereating by 700 calories a day. I should be at least a few pounds down after 9 weeks. 

I genuinely can't think where I can shave anymore calories off. And now I'm frightened to increase my calories in case I start to gain. My next step forward is to cut calories down further, but I'm a 5ft7 woman so I know this isn't sustainable or healthy. 

I'm reluctant to see my GP because I don't think they will take me seriously and I'll feel like an idiot. Don't have any symptoms of thyroid issues, or other metabolic illnesses which would cause gain. I don't want to go on medication because I don't have an issue with restricting calories, and I wouldn't want the side effects, but I'm starting to wonder if this is what I need to see any decent loss.

One caveat...I do look different - I took before and after photos and I can see the shape of my body has changed, but I should absolutely be seeing changes on the scales and it's frustrating that I'm not.

Has anybody got any tips? I see people dropping 3-4lbs a week on here but I feel like I'm doing everything right, but gaining (losing) nothing. It's so, so boring and monotonous, and I don't mind doing it if I'm seeing results, but nothing is showing on the scale.

I have about 30lbs to lose. ",1,1741072832.0,loseit,2,0.67,False

It was delicious! I also had a coffee with oat milk and I was truly delighted. One small request: leave the butter out or ideally include a bit of vegan butter, but please whatever you do Alaska, just don’t get rid of this option!

I also experienced the Alaska lounge in the N gates at SeaTac and — wow! I know it’s one of the best lounges, but the vegan options were decent! Peanut butter, breads / bagels, fruit, oatmeal and toppings, and there was a container of soyrizo, as well as guacamole and pico that I assume would go with some tortillas (although I didn’t see them). Could it be better with Just Egg scramble or a vegan pastry? Certainly. But I was happy I could easily fill up. Thanks Alaska!

*Diary entry: 05/07/2105 Timestamp: 16:39*

Lily showed up at the apartment this morning, telling Gator and me about some “insane,” using her words, money to be made in selling old tech from the Shatterdome. I told her she was nuts right off the bat, but Gator’s dumbass had to open his big mouth and ask her questions. Of course, she took that as her cue to launch into parroting whatever speech the idiot she met at the bar last night gave her about the ""potential."" I was sitting there the whole time she was talking, thinking: ""No way. She wouldn’t go in there. We’re all from Vargos; we know people never come back from salvaging in the Shatterdome. She must be bugging out."" But no, she was serious.

I had to get all that out because, ultimately, I’m a hypocrite. I agreed. And now we’re supposed to head there in a couple of hours after night falls. I’m struggling for cash right now, and to her credit, even a piece of garbage in the Shatterdome is worth more than a week’s pay shoveling shit here in Iron Reach. I don’t want to get too excited, or encourage Lily to rope us into more dangerous things she hears about once and then decides to do, but if we can get just a few decent pieces of tech and maybe some data, I could quit my job tomorrow!

I’ll type up another entry here later, but let’s hope my next entry is just chatting about how I’m going to spend my fortune. If I go missing and any of my BRZY followers don’t see more posts soon, just know I went to the OlivewerX building in the eastern section of the Shatterdome. I know no cops are coming, but at least someone can grab whatever I couldn't leave with.

\-Bezel

*Diary entry: 05/08/2105 Timestamp: 23:18*

So first off, Lily was right. The tech we grabbed here is easily worth all of our personal chits plus every dollar I’ve ever made at the job ten times over. We got into the building no sweat, and after Gator blasted some old security drones down, we really got a lay of the land.

The OlivewerX building is wild. There are a lot of confusing hallways that don’t really seem to lead anywhere, but it’s hard to keep track with all the cool shit that’s here. We got a package of old test cell phones, a few external hard drives from the records department, a perfectly working laptop from under some old desk, and a vintage key fob for building entry with retro Fountainhead logos on it. If we sell this as a single haul, we’ll all have enough money to move out of Iron Reach. So all in all: Lily was right. This is a gold mine.

Now for the bad news–I was also right.

This place is weird as hell. The hallways that don’t go anywhere never seem exactly the same. Every time we go down one we’ve been through before, something’s different. We walked down a hallway with six doors at one point. When we turned back, there were seven. 

We kept walking through this one with weird purple lines painted on the sides, and when we turned around at a dead end and went back, the paint was green. I pointed it out, but Gator and Lily told me I was imagining things. They both said it was green before. Look, I know I could be wrong, but I’m telling you, I’m not. I’m certain it was purple.

Then we found a place to camp for the night since we can’t find the way we came in, and we set up a little spot around a warmer lamp in the right corner office of the floor we were on–floor 17, according to the signs. I left the room to take a leak, came back, and the whole camp was set up in the corner office two floors up from where we were. I didn’t tell them this time because I didn’t want them to think I was seeing shit, but every sign said 19, and I swear to you, we were on floor 17.

I gotta crash now, but it’s honestly hard to fall asleep when it’s this quiet. I’m used to traffic noise, ventilation, something. This is Vargos. What kind of place is this quiet in the city?

I’ll write tomorrow. Hopefully, by then, we’ll be out of here.

\-Bezel

*Diary entry: 05/09/2105 06:22*

Gator’s gone.

Woke up, and Lily was still passed out with her travel pillow on her head, but Gator’s spot was empty. I called for him a ton, didn’t hear a damn thing. There’s not even scurrying noises from rats in here. It’s still quiet as shit. It was so quiet I could hear my own breathing.

I woke Lily up, and we went looking for him, but after we climbed five floors and the signs said floor 38, I refused to go any further. Even Lily admitted we only went up five floors, so at least now I know for sure–I’m not imagining this.

We gave up looking for him and got back to camp, and wouldn’t you know it?

There’s nothing there.

Not a fucking thing.

We found a new place to try and sleep tonight on floor 28, which looked exactly like floor 38 we’d been in earlier, but hey, why bother caring? Clearly, this place can’t make up its mind.

No warmer lamp. No travel pillows. No sleeping bags. No food. No water. Just whatever dusty office equipment we can find, and silence for company.

Lily keeps shoving the pillow over her head, and I don’t know why. There’s no noise to block out.

She keeps whispering. I thought she was reciting numbers, but when I listened closely, I swear I heard my own name. And she was laughing a bit when she said it, only for a second. Then she was quiet again.

If she loses it here, I’m striking out on my own.

I need to get out of here ASAP.

\-Bezel

*Diary entry: 05/10/2105 Timestamp: 21:40*

We’ve been stuck in this old office building for two days, and I’m pretty sure Lily is losing her mind.

It’s been nonstop with her, she won’t stop talking about the speakers in the wall.

What fucking speakers?

This whole place is quiet. And I mean eerily quiet. It’s like the world outside doesn’t exist anymore even when I can see through the boarded windows. It’s like the building is holding its breath. I heard my own stomach growling this morning when we were walking back through the halls. 

I don’t want to start this entry off on such a sour note, but there’s no one else to talk to.

Gator’s still missing, and I’m not about to waste any calories searching through empty hallways trying to find him. He’s a big boy, definitely can handle himself. Not a thought in that head of his, but at least he’s a tough guy to take down.

After our walk this morning, I went to look for an old vending machine or something, and she ran up and started hitting it.

I mean, she was wailing on this thing. Her hands are all fucked up now. We had to bandage them–she can barely move her fingers. I think she might have broken something.

I managed to find one of those old coffee dispensing machines, and it spat out something that could charitably be called toilet water, but it did have a reservoir of clean-ish water in the back, so I snagged that for us.

She won’t drink any of it, though. She keeps just talking about the speakers and saying we need to break into the system.

She insists that’s our only way out, but I don’t want to mess around with whatever security protocol is still running in this place. The district might be old, but it was definitely functional when those systems started including lethal bots.

And with no Gator here, we don’t have a gun. Or any other weapon. We don’t even have a pot to piss in.

I’ll sign back on later.

\-Bezel

*Diary Entry: 05/10/2105 Timestamp: 23:58*

I hear it too.

There’s definitely something playing through the walls.

What the fuck is that?

\-Bezel

*Diary Entry: 05/11/2105 Timestamp: 08:12*

Just you and me now diary. I got you as an auxiliary program with this neural interface package and at the time I thought you were kind of a dumb application. But I can’t even express how glad I am to have you now.

I woke up and Lily was gone. 

The pillow was still here though, and good thing because if she was covering her ears with it I’ll need to do the same because the noise from the walls is so loud at night. It’s just this muffled talking like there’s people in the next room but even when I go and check to see if I can find where the noise is coming from I always just end up in some random empty room. 

I decided I’m going to try and log in to the next office computer I find and see if there’s a map or something of the building in there so I can find my way out. 

Sick of this shit.

\-Bezel

*Diary Entry: 05/11/2105 Timestamp: 17:38*

Bad idea. Bad idea. I found a computer and tried to log in, and as soon as I got past the firewall, I was greeted by some fun pictures.

You know the kind, right?

How about candid stills from security cameras with scared faces of other people who have raided this building?

Or maybe audio recordings of people just doing some kind of construction work? I’m going to guess that explains some of the weird, torn-up walls I’ve run into walking through here.

Or, if you like, thousands of files labeled ""pay data,"" with no security code attached to them?

Kind of on the nose, right?

Yep. Very on the nose, because when you open them, it’s just security stills of me, Lily, and Gator walking through these hallways.

Lily and Gator seem fine, at least... but sometimes, in the photos, I can see them looking into the camera lenses with eyes way larger than should be humanly possible.

I threw up bile after all that.

I can’t keep walking around this place.

I’m going to starve and dehydrate before I ever find a way out.

I keep hearing the speakers through the walls, and the weird, random chatter has started to repeat something every few minutes.

The noise cuts through real clear–

""All networks. All fun. All Being.""

It’s a stupid phrase from some promotional material, I think. All Being was the program OlivewerX released that put them on the map in the first place.

Not sure what they did with it after they got acquired by Violet... but if it’s still running in here, maybe I can get a chat open and get it to find me an exit?

Might as well try.

1j35acg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBlocksPodcast/comments/1j35acg/happy_bhm/,Happy BHM,"BLACK HISTORY MONTH POST:



Happy Black History Month. I decided to post this one late because I believe in the black man’s right to be comfortably mediocre. CPT (colored people's time)  a black man’s thing, and I’m doing everything black this month. 



**I’m being late to stuff**. I’m getting sassy with Barista’s and Grocery store workers... I’m focusing on my Bowel Movements. 

Which brings me to one of this show \[ Neal Brennan’s Blocks\] Sponsor’s: Tushy! 

So I was given access to an early Tushy prototype some time ago. Take a Tushy bidet and then a squatty potty, add it to your morning routine. Mexican food will no longer be a problem for you.–  Best times in my life were that first morning mission, with or without coffee, I was able to complete it. 

Buy a Tushy! 



Question:  Why is this month so short? Why doesn’t black history have a longer month!?

I think it’s because this is the month where my boss will request I put on an extra presentation on the impactfulness of black people on commerce in America, as the only black person in an office setting.

A heartfelt and beautiful presentation which I won’t be getting paid for, and no one will remember… 

Sounds suspiciously like a throwback to  slave labor, Mmm-mmm, cut that shit off quicker. 

Be mediocre all the time Black people, but most  during Black History Month. 

I want to explain This Black HISTORY MONTH (In March), why it’s important, that there are still circles that vehemently believe and defend Bill Cosby’s innocence. 



I’m sorry what!?



Preface, I am not writing as a defendant of Cosby, nor to blame and victimize anyone involved in this case, alleged or otherwise. I recognize the acquittal per his release as a fact of the case, just as much as I accept every person’s right to defend their right to retribution with high morale. 

I just kicked syphilis, cut me some slack. 

I like to consider anyone with a theory of Bill Cosby’s innocence in possession of a 

\[WNT- weird ass theory.\]   


WNTS are an important contribution to our lexicon within’ black community, and let me tell you, just because Black folk “invented them,”  Or  more likely discovered them doesn't mean that we don't all have them. WNTS however in equitable terms, the blacks have the right to express them over the oppressor at all times. 



WNTs are what won the Trump presidential election, both times. WNTS are what Neal says “Your uncle has said stranger things on the porch"" about. 



My WNT, about Bill Cosby, started developing when I was nearly six years ago. 

 

My dad passed away due to complications from “crack addiction.” The 90’s were a weird time. If I could get anymore stereo-typically black: Was this written by AI? No–bitch, that’s my real fucking- life. My family owns a dresser of cassette tapes with beautiful films pirated from cable television. And I still haven’t had to do pornography. What a miracle I am. 

My dad left me one w/ 3 recorded assets.. Honest to God gems: “Who Framed Roger Rabbit, “Who Framed Roger Rabbit, the making of Featurette” which is the best love stories known to mankind. Finally, and one episode of the Cosby Show, not even the whole episode, just this one scene.  \[Cosby Show. [The Cosby Show: ""Night time is the right time""](https://youtu.be/NqivLvvg_Mo?feature=shared)\] Just this scene. In my attempts to come to know the personality of the man I only know as my birth father, I watched this tape on repeat some days. Just hoping to feel his presence near me. Bill Cosby, whether he wanted to be or not be, is an as important part of how I remember my father. 



What is it to be a cultural phenom who represents loads of people in an affinity group.?An affinity group that historically has been well, you know; what being black is – at this point, right!? It’s hard to fathom, if you’re not black.

Since My dad, I’ve been in therapy on and off for 30 years. 

I have used BetterHelp. My Boyfriend, sent me a subscription when we first started dating, because I guess flowers were weird… BetterHelp was able to set me up with a therapist who specialized in a type of grief counseling that I hadn’t used in the past. BetterHelp also has group therapy if you need something with more people. You can connect via phone, video, even message or text your therapist when you need to. I liked leveraging my answered journal prompts when I was in therapy to help me keep track of my WNTS vs my needs.

Arlechino: If my favorite comedian in the world, crossed loads of cultural thresholds, in what I believed was the “right way,”  IE becoming the best black comedian in the show business ever, the GOAT (if you will) and it turns out that he just got found out as doing some of the most horrible acts imaginable on the planet, he’s not the bad guy. Those women aren’t  even victims, or anything at all, because I don’t know who *Janice Dickickson* is, and if my uncle knows, He would rather be talking about *Mary J Blidge.*

Bill Cosby never becomes a villain to me.. 

In conversations about comedy,  I’m the bad guy, because arguably Bill Cosby was never bad at comedy. Right!? Right!?! 

No one disagrees with me… And no has disagreed with yet. 

I’m the villain, because he made me laugh so hard, when I was a little boy, my daddy’s first son, and made me feel so good about myself, and now I’m the “bad boy,” Because I let him fool me into believing he was the best guy, and those women embarrassed and shamed me, because that woman let that fooling happen. I am the self-aware Arlechino. And I don’t read the news because my affairs are no longer current.  It was the 90s and it was a weird time.  
  


In comedy as a member of the black audience, you are always the top Arlechino. No scheming in the synagogue. My perception is that the joke I’m hearing live in person– was written just for me. Bill Cosby came from the heavens also known as television, from the catacombs of my father’s grave, –  to remind me of how important I am.   


As the audience member, I am not just the king of this court, I am the ruler and the judge. The balcony doesn’t exist, I’m at front row to a catastrophe that I simply do not believe in and I have loads of tomatoes to throw. It’s a good thing I prefer … potatoes…. The shit better be good. This starch is good for some of you bitches. Peel through. And if you do decide to put me in a balcony, there better be four curtains behind me, a rope there for me to jump down on– Cause Diddy had tickets to this thing, and I have stood face to face with Cosby, his teams and his people multiple times on and off, in multiple professional child acting opportunities and jobs. I’m watching real close.  

  


\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



I am  the black Arlechino, and Bill Cosby really did this bad thing and people keep talking about. So it’s my horror story today. The Bill Cosby Story, is a horror story, and because it all lives in my television, My papa and I’s last happy place before he went away forever.. my opinions dictate my experience of that story…

That man who you say, did these horrible things, had his hands on my body. But who cares I just got microchipped! It’s all good. Tell me more about this man. My voice is a little different than yours, brother. 

 And as a black person in my affinity group which is a small group but a mixed one: Bill Cosby has met a lot of kids. Not just black kids. He’s met a lot of kids. He might at this point be in costume. Let’s just talk about Cosby. 

I am the horror story, and the kids know. Mind you it’s not really my story. It’s the victims' story, and it’s Cosby’s story. It’s a network story, It’s what was what happening on the white side, and what does Cosby mean when he says “The Dutch Man” and points at my uncle Neal in the back of what I presume was a dressing room??  

But in Black culture often the central focus of celebrity is not the star, but who the star represents. I was told to root for Bill Cosby at 6 years old, the day my father died.( Microchipped or not) I was told to stop cheering him on immediately about 5 years ago.

 I’ve been six years old with Bill Cosby for a long time, and he has touched my skin. You are telling me to accept that a man who has touched my very skin has rapped 60 women with his fucking wive’s help, women who look just like me? Ok, bitch, let’s talk — And send me to a job application to  onlyfans while you’re at it.. That’s hell!?? 

Jesus Fucking Christ. Ok!? 

Careful what you say black man!? Cause I would scream in the street for that? 

Now I’m also the dictator in the audience of the blackest bitch in the room who you can’t see. 

I’m not just Arlechino, I’m just waiting to be bated to switch to Brighella any fuckin’ day now.  

I am shouting back at the screen if It’s true or not, If it’s meant to be a joke ‘Cause  Cosby was the first great black comedy. On my television. A Juggernaut, My hero. My Isaiah Bradely.  

Those crimes that he is accused of are what my people might call “Some ‘white people shit’” 

And if he did those crimes that’s his “white” record  and that has nothing to do with me. Because I’m black and he’s black, and black people don’t do things like that--  my guy!!!    


What’s worse, if he did this, I am even further embarrassed because Cosby may have believed that was funniest thing in the world the world to do. Which by my account, to drug and GRAPE someone is one of the foulest acts known to man. Maybe that’s what makes it so funny to him. I don;t know it’s the 90’s and I just kicked Syphilis. 

It implicates me in his sick joke whether I believe he did it or not, because despite being acquitted, he still stands accused by 60 women. And I saw him last year twice. 

If and when it comes out, that, hypothetically, Neal Brennan has his own Cosby-esque Skeletons, do you know who ends up being the asshole!? 

Not Neal, No no no no no. 

Giving the standing ovation during the second showing. 

Long after the skeletons are uncovered. Because I can’t believe Neal, my favorite stand up comedian would ever do something that might require a skeleton day, that’s why I fuggs with him.  Right!? 

Right. 

Good thing Neal looks like a Skeleton so we know not to stand up for him at the end of his concerts. 

A true WNT about Neal: He’s most likely eating pork on Sunday. When he says Ice Cream but he just means bacon. Damn it to hell, Neal! 

Being a member of the comedic audience is living between the sense that something is off and the scandal is breaking any day now. As a fan, I am living in between the moment the bad thing happened which I never witnessed, and the moment the bad thing finally goes public. 

As a native Angelino, I am not only familiar with that in-between space, – and fairly addicted to it. 

Neal simplifies this as “Star Fugging’”  But I like to call that in-between space  FOREPLAY… And we doing Orirgies all the  time. 

 It’s why I live here.

 I believe all overtures are bullshit. 

And why my first lesson in comedy was If you want to tell the truest most funny joke – just say it. Don’t be a pansy. Tell a room full of people you think.

“Bill Cosby is a Rapist” 

Shout out to Hannibal Burress.

The saddest part about a story like Bill Cosby’s and the preceding and coming scandals, is that it removes a sincere audience member’s internal sense of trust of character. 

As an audience member, and an unlikely unwilling participant,  the most important person in the playspace of entertainers I can tell you is the audience, Which means having more respect for the performers who honor that fully. 

This causes me to distrust and dislike myself for getting into bed with that type of person at all, especially as a fan let alone a business partner.

Neal might be Bill Cosby’s Dutchman but to that I say I would have to  “*Go read that fucking play.”* 

*Too bad  I was sent  Another Country by James Baldwin –* first. 

This can insight self hatred, “This Cosby Scandal.”  And I would simply prefer that scandal be false. Therefore that hope is always my interior. Don’t fuck with my insides. Dont make me bleed my own blood bitch, I bleed for free. 

We need spaces to make our  “**WNTS” real for a second just to “court the scandal.” That’s the community of**  ActTive Listerns developed over the HNF era.

That’s what Neal calls “ Your uncle has **said** crazier shit.”  WNTS, That’s what we need feelers in the community for. Feel through that shit. 

When I say WNTS- I mean theoretical needs, expressed and disposed of in a safe community. That’s what I mean.   


\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*



*Taking these out and living an ideology that makes me entitled to a space where the character Bill Cosby depicted in these cases as the perpetrator is innocent, is mental illness. Especially if that entitlement lives without rebbutal.*   


A WNT in Community would be the guy in front of the Laugh Factory saying to me “ Prince is not a real Guy.”

 My response in order to let him know he is safe enough to be himself in my space is to respond: 

“ Yeah that’s ok, Neal Brennan has been Michael Jackson, at least once between 2002 and 2006, \[ Work it JT\] and nobody knows who Eminem is.

 ( It’s Chris Evans, for sure. It’s Chris– Go big or go home – Happy Black History Month!) 

You Rock My World *Baby Dzaddy.* [*2:17*](https://youtu.be/g4tpuu-Up90?feature=shared)

CLUE: The only need in regards to WNTS is reading the scifi and discerning whether or not the need is tangible. 

And the need is community. 

Finding that need through a varied arrangement of exploring your WNTS is incredibly beneficial.  

Therapy, an artist community, and physical hobby that is nourishing to your ugly joints. Will give you a lot to start with.  

Community is reading the scifi of the WNT before pulling dumb ass hoe ass moves. Like slipping into Neal Brennan’s DMs  or telling your ward that Jews are the reason for slavery, WTF Kanye! !? Those moves are mental illness. 

Please remember that there are victims involved here. On the flip-side, were I a victim of Bill Cosby, I imagine there was a moment of despair which was met by a moment of hope that lunged right back into despair again.  Was I hypnotized, was I murdered, was I trafficked, and where are my fucking clothes?

If I had awoken, had been drugged and taken advantage of in the most intimate way, by a man with an entire world, that we all believed in–  My hope would meet me with, well maybe I can be a part of his world now too, and the despair overwhelms me once I realize that he never wants to see me again, and I can’t find work and I have to go find work, and all I want is to be near him just to ask his what happened last night. 

Did I deserve it because I hoped he would love and care for me after that moment of harm? Or did I deserve it because I was with this married man at all, and does, he have the right to judgment via taking such a grotesque action? What do you want the victims to say?    
  


\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

 

If I meet a victim on the street, and have the audacity to “mock the trial,” then I better bow before the real heroes, the women and men who came forward and didn’t stop telling the truth. 

Finally and most foreboding, I perceive that the comic and entertainer’s job is to set people free and all of that freedom is negated when that person is simultaneously poisoning and enslaving the community at the same time.

Do you understand how dangerous this world is for women, let alone Black women and women of Color? What the fuck do you want from the court system? Bill Cosby was acquitted.

I’ve always wanted to own a Rolex, but until now, the only watch I’ve ever worn daily was my Apple Watch.

Today, I went to the mall for a quick coffee and happened to notice a Rolex Bucherer store next door. On a whim, I walked in just to check out their exhibition pieces and casually asked if they had any Datejust models in stock. To my surprise, the salesperson said they had one available!

Although I originally wanted a fluted bezel with a Jubilee bracelet, I couldn’t pass up the opportunity—so I pulled the trigger and finally got my first Rolex: a Datejust!

It still feels surreal, and I couldn’t be happier with my purchase. Just had to share this moment with the community",17,1741072387.0,rolex,2,1.0,False

I took both to a master class with a barista champion and he confirmed it (without my statements). 

Objective reasons:

1. Number of steps is ridiculously not sufficient for espresso. I need somewhere between 7 and 8 clicks to dial in right shot. Comparing to 25 clicks for the same grind size on 1Zpresso. Ok I've got RedClix and now have 15 clicks vs 25 clix which is better but far from ideal.
2. Grind uniformity is worse. Did the test, Comandante has a too fine grind and some too coarse grind. While 1Zpresso has mainly 200mkm and some 100mkm
3. Ease of use - 1Zpresso on magnets, coffee does not stick to the can as much as C40
4. Speed - 1Zpresso ±1,5 times faster to grind

Speed and ease of use are not that important for home use IF I WOULD GET BETTER QUALITY OUT OF C40 WHICH I DONT

Shares of Black Rifle Coffee (BRCC) dropped nearly 4.5% in after hours trading on Monday after the company’s fourth-quarter revenue fell short of estimates, dampening retail sentiment.

For Q4 its loss per share stood at $0.03, better than a feared loss of $0.05, according to The Fly. Revenue decreased 11.5% to $105.9 million, missing Wall Street estimates of $106.2 million.

Its Q4 net loss narrowed to $6.7 million from net loss of $14 million in the same period last year.

Wholesale revenue decreased 8.6% to $67.2 million, driven by a $12.7 million net reduction in barter transaction revenue offset by continued distribution gains and sales growth in the FDM market, growth in our ready-to-drink (RTD) coffee product, and revenue from initial shipments of Black Rifle Energy, the company said.

BRC sees FY25 revenue between $395 million and $425 million, compared to the consensus estimate of $414.85 million. It expects adjusted earnings before interest, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to be between $20 million and $30 million.

""Black Rifle made significant progress in strengthening our operations, bolstering our market presence, and improving profitability over the past year,"" said BRC’s CEO Chris Mondzelewski.

""With expanded coffee distribution, the launch of Black Rifle Energy, and our strategic partnerships with Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP), we have built a strong foundation for long-term growth.

Whether it’s the iconic Dairy Milk bar, the gooey Creme Egg, or the crunchy goodness of Cadbury Flake, the brand has positioned itself as a household name. But what makes Cadbury so special? Why has it managed to capture the hearts (and taste buds) of millions worldwide? Let’s find out…

**The Cadbury Story**

Cadbury’s journey began in 1824 when John Cadbury, a Quaker, opened a small shop in Birmingham, England, selling tea, coffee, and drinking chocolate. His commitment to quality and ethical business practices quickly set Cadbury apart from other brands. By 1861, John’s sons, Richard and George Cadbury, took over the business and introduced new innovations that would change the chocolate industry forever.

One of their biggest breakthroughs was the invention of Dairy Milk in 1905, which featured a higher milk content than any other chocolate at the time. This instantly made Cadbury a favourite among consumers who loved its creamy taste. Over the years, the brand continued expanding, acquiring other companies and launching new products to keep up with evolving consumer demands.

Today, Cadbury is owned by Mondelez International and operates in over 50 countries, making it one of the most dominant chocolate brands in the world. Its rich history, commitment to quality, and innovative products have made it a leader in the confectionery industry.

But when your name is Anthropic, you strap on your tech boots and make a thunderous leap into AI's future, aiming to become the startup world's AI-busting juggernaut.

Anthropic, a trailblazer in the AI sector, just wrapped up its Series E funding round, swelling its coffers with a jaw-dropping $3.5 billion. Yes, billion with a ""B."" Their aim? To harness that green to develop supercharged AI systems that not only shrug at mundane tasks but also channel the inner Einsteins we all wish we had on speed dial.

This financial infusion catapults Anthropic's valuation to a cool $61.5 billion. Not too shabby for a company whose systems are working under the relentless glare of trying to keep Alexa from asking whether Siri is seeing anyone. Their flagship AI, Claude, is already transforming industries from tax advising to clinical reporting, and it's even giving Amazon's Alexa a run for its virtual money.

But here's the kicker. As the battle heats up, Anthropic claims it's not just about sprinkling AI fairy dust everywhere; it's about forging AI that collaborates with humans. Like a colleague who doesn’t steal your favorite mug from the break room, but instead helps you nail that big presentation.

Now, this trajectory sounds as robust as a Tesla's self-driving guarantee. Yet, with great AI power comes great potential for disruption. Will Anthropic’s roadmap steer us toward an AI-enhanced human renaissance or merely towards another set of digital overlords tolerating our analog antics? The potential is as thrilling as it is daunting.

So, what's your take? With Anthropic's monumental leap ahead, how do you see the future of AI: a friendly companion or an overbearing roommate? Let’s hash it out in the comments below.",1,1741071889.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

I won't lie to you about the times I've rocked myself on the floor in grief, the intrusive thoughts, not being able to have coffee because my anxiety is too bad, jumping when the phone rings, bursting into tears on the bus, seeing a family and feeling like I want to cry/getting angry, feeling like I can't/won't ever get the chance to have kids, understanding I may have onset health issues as I get older from a lifetime of C-PTSD and ctrauma, all the boyfriends I ran to for love as a result of my parents who only did worse to me...it's been a lot.

But, it gets calmer if you can believe it. 

What always stopped me going NC with my immediate family was the loneliness. I don't have a family of my own. I could loosely say I have a romantic interest, but I wouldn't even go that far. I have a few friends that I see occasionally, but sometimes having the upbringing we've had means you're left with a small support network - I chose, unwittingly, to be isolated. 

The most I have is this guy. My entire world wrapped into one silly fluffy costume. He also sometimes throws up and then tries to eat it but, I think I can live with that small character defect.

I'm too soon in my journey to tell you all the answers, but just in case you are worried the journey is bleak, difficult and like an impossible challenge in a fairytale  - yeah it can be hard, but there's glimmers of hope. You are not alone and this forum has helped me enormously. 

So my little piece back to you all on here and anyone else desperately googling for answers is this: thank you for making me feel loved in ways I never dared to accept before, and thank you for helping me to a point where I can stop to truly enjoy the little things. 

I could be on here tomorrow with a post asking for support, tears as I write. I could not come on here at all...who knows? Either way, we will all survive this. We've survived the hardest part of being IN CONTACT.  This part is the mental readjustment and it's way harder on us because we are trained to be full of shame.

Thank you for quietening the inner abuser, and to anyone considering estrangement...there are GOOD days to be had, and they are so beautiful when you have support at the end of the phone. I can't thank you all enough x ",22,1741070830.0,EstrangedAdultKids,10,1.0,False

1j34uvo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j34uvo,The Lumon building is a Casino disguised as an Office Building (or: The Playing Cards Theory),"(Waiting to post this on the main sub but I got impatient lol)

(Credit to u/tdciago for bringing up the playing cards theory and for pointing out the Bridge similarities)

DISCLAIMER: My knowledge in gambling is slim. I’m not going to pretend I’m an expert, but I do want to shed light on this, as there are a *LOT* of references the show has to playing cards and gambling in general—so much so that it’d be a missed opportunity to not make this post. So if I get anything wrong or you have more insight, feel free to share! (Also, please be considerate. Not everything here will end up meaning anything and that’s okay. It’s better to look deep into a subject and get things wrong along the way than it is to do nothing. Critical thinking/media analysis is incredibly important to further understand stories like this.)


##The Lumon building is a Casino disguised as an Office Building

	THEMATIC RELEVANCE: Comparing the unwanted lives of a 9-5 office job and gambling at casinos. You go to a confined building, sit at a screen all day pressing buttons, and lose track of time until you have to leave. Both of which are not healthy, but you keep coming back anyways because you need money and/or your life sucks. Both places like to draw in people who are vulnerable, which is why many casino and office business function like cults (mafias and MLMs). The casino side of Lumon may be Dieter, and the business side is Kier. (As a writer, if these two comparisons aren’t being made, then I’ll have to write it myself because DAMN is it smart.)

	They both have…

	- long halls that feel like they last for miles

	- square ceiling tiles and colored mat floors

	- limited amount of clocks/strange clocks, no windows or natural light

	- Lumon building is a rectangle business building on the outside, and u shaped in the inside, like a casino. The further inside you go, the more apparent the gambling themes get. The building also faces a body of water/is on water, like casinos.

	- (Striking opposition) Casinos interiors lack sharp angles to make you more likely to not think about what you’re doing (hence why some people pace back and forth when trying to think). So why would the Severance halls be filled to the brim with 90 degrees turns? Perhaps to make the workers think they have agency? (Like Harmony said: “The surest way to tame a prisoner is to let him believe he’s free.) Maybe the halls are more reminiscent of a prison?

	- Constant ring of c notes from slot machines, like the c(#) notes from the elevators.

	- In S2E4, Mr. Milchick says: “Marshmallows are for team players, Dylan.” Casinos often offer “free” drinks and food but only to gamblers (or players). This might correlate to the waffle parties that are given and toy prizes you earn when you complete (or win) a file, and why Cobel promised MDR an all-floor mixer “when they earn it”.

	- https://www.npr.org/2022/07/31/1110882487/dod-slot-machines-overseas-bases This entire article. How overseas US military bases (especially the navy) are connected to gambling/slots. How this could relate to Irving is really interesting. It would explain why overseas US military bases are an accepted answer to the innie survey question of “Name a US state or territory”.

	- MDR desks are shaped like cards ordered in the game Bridge. The computers and its files/numbers are set up more like video poker, solitaire, and sudoku than office computer files. They don’t even use most of the keyboard. And you are organizing numbers into 5 categories (cards) for the *entire time.*

	- Video game references: 8 bit Kier and 8 bit Irving. 8 bit Kier is shown when Helly completes/wins a file.
	

##Playing Cards

Some characters represent a suit and level on playing cards. For instance…

- GEMMA = (Ace of)♦️ Her name is *Gem*ma, knits in a fisherman pattern (diamond pattern), and is very connected to nature. When a red diamond is cut in half, they are 🔺🔻, like on the testing room elevators.

- IRVING = (Ace of) ♠️ He plays *Ace of Spades*, his palette knife looks like a spade, and spades represent soldiers/weapons. The role of a spade is to trick players and get information from them, as Irving is probably doing with Burt and Fields.

- REGHABI = (Ace of) ♣️ She uses a bat (club) to kill Graner. (Sorry, wish I had more info on her)

- PETEY = (Ace of) ♥️ Has a heart on his mug (funeral photo) and plays red cards with June (funeral photo). A heart’s role is to avoid players or run away, and Petey runs and avoids people. He may also reference the “suicide king” card, who, well… dies.

- DRUMMOND = (Jack of) ♦️ His name may be a play on the word “diamond”. Frolic may symbolize diamonds, which is why he has the word “frolic” on his hand.

Each SUIT represents a TEMPER…

	- WOE = ♥️ Hearts symbolize emotion, specifically woeful emotions (“heartfelt”, “heartbroken”…) 
	- FROLIC = ♦️ Diamonds symbolize the earth and luxury, or fun. Frolic means playful.
	- DREAD = ♣️ Clubs symbolize strength, knowledge, and merchants/working class. This is mostly dread due to process of elimination, I don’t have solid evidence for connection.
	- MALICE = ♠️ Spades symbolize authority, weapons, and soldiers. Fighting and controlling very anger/malice oriented.

	- With this in mind, if it would make sense if refining is partially based on video poker.

	- Several card brands, such as Bicycle, make their card sides mirror each other—so the bottom half is reversed from the top—much like innies and outies.


##General Terminology

	- Jack = The face card before the kings and queens. Also referred to as knaves. During Irving’s wellness session, Ms. Casey states: “your outie has no fear of muggers or knaves”.

	- Joker = A jester face card introduced during the American Civil War to act as a wild card. One of the four tempers is represented as a jester.

	- VPIP = (Poker) Stands for “Voluntarily Put (money) In the Pot”. Pip’s VIP card may reference this.

	- Pips = (Bridge) Any card that is not a face card. Phillip Eagan went by the nickname “Pip”, and his bar is called “Pip’s”.

	- Chips = Tokens in Poker that represent money. Different colors are different values in money—typically, blue is $10, green is $25, and black is $100. If we take the value of keycards into account (MDR = blue, O&D= green, Security = black), this parallel would add up. Also, MDR must use tokens instead of money in order to eat from the vending machine. The Severance devices put in people’s head are also referred to as chips.

	- Hand = (Bridge) A deal or board, or a player holding the cards. This might hint to why Drummond has the word “frolic” on his hand.
 
	- Rabbit (hunting) = A shared or undealt community card. Also a controversial and tiring method in Hold ‘Em. The rabbit/duck is seen/mentioned twice: once in Mr. Milchick’s office, and another when Gemma is talking to Mark about her mail tests. And, although loose connection, one Burt’s goodbye posters has a rabbit on it. 

	- Duck = (Poker) A pair of two cards. (Bridge) To intentionally play low/lose in order to trick the opponent and set up a suit. Relates to the duck/rabbit illusion.

	- Mark = An inexperienced player who is easy to be taken advantage over. I’m not sure if he’s necessarily inexperienced, but Dylan did say that he had a “freshman fluke” on a file, and he is easily manipulated by people above him (Cobel, Milchick, Helena…)

	- Scout = (Sports betting) A player who waits to bet a lot of money. This *might* reference how Mark waited to reintegrate/flood his chip and now he’s “betting a lot”.

	- Fish = A player who is unskilled. Although another very loose connection, Mark has two pet fish.

	- George = A generous tipper. Dylan’s surname is George, possibly referencing how he is the best at refining the numbers and earns the most prizes.

	- Nosebleed = When the stakes are high. When Mark and Petey’s nose bleed, it’s a bad sign of reintegration sickness… otherwise a very high stake for them. Drummond was also very concerned about the nosebleed.

	- Paint = (Poker) Any face card. Irving paints while listening to Ace of Spades to send his innie a message.

	- Pineapples = Variation of the game Hold ‘Em. Pineapples are frequently seen in the show as a status of wealth and bargaining/manipulation.

	- Laws = The rules of Bridge. Devon says “law” after threatening to push Reghabi off a bridge. She also says solitary, possibly referencing Solitaire.

	- Coffeehousing = Misleading the opponent by asking improper questions and generally tricking the opponent. Devon receiving coffee from Gabriela’s innie might allude to this.

	- Riggs: Bobby Riggs was a tennis player and prolific gambler. Gemma’s tennis room may reference The Battle of the Sexes (1973), or match between Billie Jean *King* and Bobby *Riggs*, where Riggs would often wear strange outfits (ie. His sugar daddy jacket) to express his chauvinistic ideals and interest in King (so Dr. Maur is the Riggs equivalent). Helly’s middle/fake name is also Riggs. Helly’s name may also be inspired from the words “rigged” and “eggs”.

	- Scissors Coup = (Bridge) A play that prevents defenders (players) from communicating. Coup is a frequiently used term in bridge. When MDR are walking to the Perpetuity Wing, they talk about how there might’ve been a coup that separated the departments. Also, Kier tamed the tempers in Scissor Cave, as in preventing the emotions from interacting with him; cutting them away.

	- Board = (Bridge) All the tools presented in the game, a method of scoring in the game, and/or the entire deal of a game. This could be referring to The Board itself, as they seem to rule and overlook the company.

	- Key Cards = (Bridge) Any ace or trump king. A self explanatory parallel.

	- Bingo: Dylan passed out an Eagan bingo to everyone in S1E3. Pretty self-explanatory on how this relates to gambling and casinos.

	- Eye-in-the-sky = Casino term for closed circuit cameras that monitor many places. This phrase is also commonly used in the military. June’s band, *Fissureman*, references this: “Build a sky in my eye, that perfect blue”

	- Dummy = (Bridge) The declarer’s partner—one of the most frequently used terms in bridge. In S2S1, Gwen mentions her old work place had CPR dummies, which may reference this (this could also be a reference to The Office).

	- Exit card = (Bridge) A card used to let down the guard of the opponent, temporarily giving up the lead. Right after Fields discusses Burt’s fate and Irving is surprised, Burt says: “he’s looking for the exit.”

1j34tsb,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1j34tsb/started_of_this_year_with_a_brutal_breakup_still/,"Started of this year with a brutal breakup. Still in pain, but realizing what I really want now.","So I (M24) started off the year with an extremely brutal breakup. We had a really great connection and although we were only “officially” together for one year (realistically almost 2, but she only counted it as 1) it felt like we had been together our whole lives. We had some troubles that are pretty tough to get through, which I won’t go into detail here but maybe in a separate post. But, anyways I still do love her and want it to work out somehow. It’s been just about 2 months now and still hurts the same.

Anyways, I’ve started to realize why it would’ve never worked out and I am also, re-realizing what I’ve always really wanted in a partner. 

My ex was very attention driven, and she did not realize it at all. She claimed to hate social media but was constantly working on new posts for her pages since she was really into fashion and digital art and was involved in lots of artistic ventures. She was really trying hard to be an “influencer” of some sort. One of our problems was that she liked to go out to night clubs and such with her friends, and I did not like doing that type of thing very often. I would sometimes. Mainly for special occasions. But,  there were lots of times where she wanted to go out and then come back to my place late in the night basically just for sex and sleep. Which honestly made me feel like a second option and nothing but a penis for her to end her nights with (she made it very clear she loved drunk sex).

This was tough, because, even though she was 26, her mother had a tight leash on her. Her mother hated when she went out, constantly wanted her home and would blow up my phone and her friends phones all night until she finally got home, to the point where some of her friends decided to block her moms number. And she was not allowed to be at my house alone with me, or stay over. Not only that but she had a previous relationship that she told me was very abusive. She said the guy wouldn’t let her go anywhere, told her how to dress, and manipulated her into feeling like shit and doing whatever he said. So when I tried to just speak my mind about how I felt about her going out, she would call me insecure and immature and say I was just like her ex. Which hurt, cause I would wait up until sometimes 4 in the morning just to let her in my house, and she’d walk in very annoyingly drunk. Then we’d have some sex and she’d basically fall asleep right after she got off without even any like “after-care” lol. Or most times, she would have to go home, so we woukdnt hang out at all.

I used to like going out with her when we were first starting to hang out, cause I was basically single still and it was just me and a bunch of her girlfriends most of the time with her so it was fun and exciting, but I quickly got tired of it and I just wanted to be home with her much more often. 

With the going out led to a lot more of her male friends, that weren’t around much when I did enjoy going out with her, ending up being around all the time when she went out alone. 
And then she wanted to go have coffee with male friends and work on projects while I would be at work. I brought it up and she again called me insecure and immature and said there doesn’t have to be anything sexually motivated about a male and female friendship. I am the type of guy who believes most of those guy friends were probably waiting for us to break up, and it didn’t help that she would always remind me that she usually only dates guys that are friends first and I was the first guy that wasn’t a friend first. Anyways we never agreed on that so I just had to bite my tongue and trust her. But the coffee dates did end cause I said if I was going to have coffee with girls all the time she wouldn’t like it. 

And those were the main things I never really liked about her. She craved attention and she even inadvertently admitted that, that is the reason she loved going out. She used crazy words like “controllling” and “insecure”, and constantly compared me to her abusive ex, whenever I just wanted to talk about my feelings and boundaries. She enjoyed going out (which is fine) and I’m more of a home body now who just wants to be home with my girlfriend or other fun things just not out at clubs. Her parents were very controlling and she wasn’t allowed to stay at my house at all, which means we had to lie to them and she only stayed over rarely. And everything else I said up above. 

So now I’ve realized, I want a girl who is more like me. Someone who doesn’t crave attention (I hate too much attention and don’t like being in large groups). Someone who is understanding and able to talk about things without getting upset and name calling. Someone who is treated like an adult and can stay at my place with me often without having to lie to their mother. Someone who understands that ,when you’re in a relationship, it’s fine to have friends of the opposite sex, but you can’t be super close with them the same as your same-sex friends.

My ex was very loving and caring, I wish I could paint the other side of the picture because she really was great in a lot of ways. But all of this stuff I’m realizing now, was really going to eventually grow old and I would’ve gotten tired of it. And don’t get me wrong, I did a lot of really bad things that ultimately are the true reason this relationship did end. But, I’ve learned. I know the type of partner I really want to be now and I know the type of girl that I’m really looking for. I hope I am eventually able to let go of this love and longing that I still have for her and get started on my personal growth, eventually finding the girl that I’m truly looking for. I’m working on myself, but once I am able to let go of this pain in my heart that’s when the real work begins.",1,1741070571.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

1j34qxt,https://i.redd.it/zcpu87mrbmme1.png,6 Month Anniversary With Fade!,"Fade and I had our 6 month anniversary today and I'm so happy! We spent the morning going out for coffee, we planned on going to sit down and have a nice breakfast date at this fancy coffee shop, but their kitchen was closed so we just got some coffee (it was very good) and then went to this other crepe place we really like and got some crepes to take home (it was way to crowded for her, and she doesnt like crowds) 

She got the strongest black coffee and I got an extra sweet vanilla latte, which made Fade very dramatically roll her eyes because ""it's not even coffee at that point"" but whatever it was more for me anyways

I had to work for a few hours but when I got home we spent some time playing her source (Valorant) and hanging out together. And now we're spending the rest of the night reading some books together with a candle that I got that smells just like her. 

Fade is my first f/o that I had ever had, and previously I had only 3 irl relationships (2 of them horrible) and the longest one only lasted for just under 6 months. So Fade is now officially my longest relationship and I'm so happy to have her in my life. I cant wait to spend so much more time with her 🧿💖",3,1741070257.0,FictoLove,2,1.0,False

I had a date a few days ago which honestly still confuses me as to what happened. It started with a match on a dating app and a few messages. I think an important detail here is that I had on my profile a line that says ""I'm looking to explore emotional and perhaps physical intimacy, but only when there's a click."" This is mostly to keep people away who are interested in hookups but it might have had the opposite effect.

So, we met up and one of the first things we talked about was dating intentions. They said they were open to a lot of stuff but that they go into dates with just the intention to go out and enjoy the date without expectations. I think that is a great way to go into a date and also go into dates that way and maybe state by the end of the date if I'm interested to meet up again. They also said that they were very direct in their approach to many things in life. I referred to my profile description but with the presumption that they understood it. 

This is where it gets confusing for me as it seems to contradict what they said. First of all, they talked about an artwork they'd made and was in their appartment but didn't want to show a picture because it looks better in person. In addition to that, after we ate our breakfast at the first place we planned to go somewhere else. They paid for me while I was going to the toilet. (Which honestly kind of bothered me) We then went to a fancier place. There, there were again several awkward moments that just didn't seem to line up. I ended up paying. They said to send me a venmo to share the bill but then later on the app told me it was a joke. I ended up getting a profile warning, presumably because they reported the link. I mean, sure whatever.

If this was them trying to get me to go back to their appartment, it didn't work because all the hints flew over my head and I wouldn't have gone anyway because that's not why I'm dating. 

Perhaps I'm overanalysing this but next time I'm only going for a cup of coffee and I'll probably only do so once I'm sure about the person's intentions prior to meeting up.",1,1741070086.0,demisexuality,2,1.0,False

I should’ve brought clothes for my baby but they said no. The ones left in our room suck ass. Im not putting my child into that. There were there on the dusty window when we arrived but I thought someone have just forgotten them but nope. I am waiting for a midwife or nurse to come so I can tell them to give me new ones. I found some wrapper from coffee inbetween them. This isn’t new its gross.
There were opened packs of pads (unused) in the wardrobe left from the last person. No soap, no toilet paper, dusty everything, spit in the sink. And thats a private clinic where I am paying for VIP ROOM. Yeah Im about to lose my shit 😀 the only thing stopping me is that those people will be taking care of me and my child for 5 days. 

Overall I am running on pure rage rn and Idk who is going to eat it up. Had to send my husband to eat somewhere cuz he was driving me nuts with “its all fine”. There is no one that can bring me clothes as I am birthing in another town not my own and nobody but me and my husband knows about this. 

I was very nervous yesterday but now Im angry.

I just told one girl there is a hair in the clothes and she told me “well they can’t be sterile. It’s probably from the last mom” BITCH CALL SOMEONE TO CLEAN BEFORE I MOP THE FLOOR WITH YOU.

 I went to JU on the 17th of February for YESM,  departmental fest of their Economics department. I'm from a different college and I took part in one of the events. So I was with a friend and after we were done we thought it would be a good idea to roam the campus. The campus has such a rustic and homely vibe to it. So it was around 1:20 p.m. when we visited the canteen behind the field (overheard someone calling it the Aahar canteen). We got a packet of chips from there and just then I saw this guy. 

He was tall, had a good physique, wore navy blue polo shirt and khaki pants and had glasses too. He had a blue coloured bag and mostly from one of the engineering departments. He was by himself, sitting at one side of the bench having his coffee. Perhaps, he was on a call with someone. I could see him from where I was seated. Then he stood and moved towards the field and was petting a dog. I was deliberating whether I should go and talk with him(never did this so felt a little awkward). Anyways, I did not go and talk. 

After a while, I  saw him helping a visually-impaired person reach his destination within the campus. I was all the more in awe of him. After dropping him, we even had eye contact while he was returning. It was as if the universe was signalling me to just go talk with him. I really wish I did. I wish I could find him.

PS- I'm a girl. I'm just taking a shot with not much hope to find him. Please do your magic reddit.

If you’re watching (or reading here), take note that:

* The episode titles are riffs on some of Alec’s movie titles (thanks u/DiffrontFigure7114)
* Alec and Hillary are completely unattuned to their kids’ emotional needs (thanks u/VelveteenLeveret), so be careful if that brings up your own childhood trauma
* Carmen was 10 at the time of filming so the makeup spackled on complete with plumped, glossy lips and small cropped tops with bra straps intentionally showing are a lot to handle. My oldest daughter is the same age, and I find looking at Carmen upsetting.
* Their insistence that Alec has OCD rubs many people the wrong way. Per u/shep2105: *“Alec does NOT HAVE OCD. Not in the least. He MAY have a very few traits of OCPD, but he does NOT have OCD. Who is she fucking trying to kid?? He just seems like an organizer to minimize chaos guy or out of boredom. It's really a disservice to say that he has been diagnosed with the mental health condition of OCD.”*  In one of the lackluster promos TLC has been pushing, the kids say Alec is the more organized parent and Hillary looks genuinely miffed at that. She says [*“when Daddy* *cleans, is it actually clean?”* The kids respond *“no, it’s organized.”*](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1itjvxu/screenrecording_of_the_latest_tlc_promo_vid_in/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) Interesting, no?
* Episode 2 aired on March 2^(nd), the same day as the Oscars. The juxtaposition of Alec’s cheesy reality TV show and the event that honors actors and their craft is lovely.

**Alrighty! On with the recap:**

*  Carmen is excitedly puttering around the kitchen gathering ingredients and making a mess and Spicy Mamá in full accent asks *“what ju doin?”* Carmen replies she’s making face masks and Hillary asks *“and what’s concept about it?”* Jesus take the wheel and drive us home.
* Carmen says she has no idea what honey is used for. Her Google search just indicated it was good for lips and facials, and she notes that Alec has no lips and Hillary laughs (keep this in mind for a bit later).
* Hillary couch interview: *“Carmen age-wise she’s not in the day camp she’s very much like little mommy. She’s a kid and we need to remind her that she’s a kid. She worries and worries and worries.”*
* Carmen gets her own couch interview (just like most kids who have the misfortune to be on TLC reality shows). She’s in leggings and a tank top, fussing with her hair, in heavy mascara and lip gloss
   * Producer: *“What is it like being the oldest of seven kids?”*
   * Carmen: *“I love it, but I hate it cuz oldest means you’re sort of kind of like parenting them with your parents but at the same time I get to Ike go out to dinner with my parents. I get to stay up later which is fun…my siblings they get more attention… I’m definitely my dad’s favorite. It changes every day… He’s funny like 40% of the time and 60% of the time he’s like, well back in my day, back in my day”*
* They go upstairs and we get a glimpse right up Hillary’s little dress. They find Alec sitting in a chair in Carmen's room on his phone and Carmen yells *“get off your phone”* and he complies.
   * Carmen: *“This is for your lips, your really tiny ones.”*
   * Alec: “*Carmen, do me a favor. Carmen would you refrain from making mean comments about me while we do this, ok?”* No one listens, Carmen is hurrying him along and Hillary is laughing.
* Hilz couch interview: *“We have to go to New Mexico because has to go in trial* (not a typo) *and we don’t know, he could go to prison for a long time. So he wants to be there for as many moments as possible.”*
* Wearing satin pjs, heavy gold hoops, Hillary’s gold nameplate necklace she wore nonstop about 6 years ago, and a gold cross (because mami is in her let’s attract a Christian demographic era as opposed to her I’m a big ol Wiccan era and Carmen reflects Hillary's interests) [Carmen gives Alec a facial](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1j12xst/no_need_to_watch_the_next_episode_you_can_watch/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) as Alec highlights the differences between raising Ireland and raising Carmen:
* Alec: *“One of my most regrettable things about the \[contentious divorce from Kim Basinger\] was how it affected Ireland. But Ireland is grown, she’s 28 years old. I have a good relationship with her. She loves the kids, I mean she’s very sweet to them, she’s their older sister but she’s not in that pack. This is why I think I’m so focused on Carmen and having, I want to have a good relationship with Carmen because I have a girl all over again.”*  Marilú just turned four and Baby No Name will be three this fall, maybe start thinking of them as your daughters, too, Zander.
* Carmen:  (applying coffee grounds to Alec’s face and talking to crew) *“This is how you get him to shut up, you just put stuff on his mouth that he doesn’t want to eat”* (Alec’s eyebrows do quirk up at that but he doesn’t say anything)
* Alec: *“Carmen was an only child for two years and boy, she really wishes she could go in a time machine and go back to the good old days when it’s just Carmen.”*  This is just projection bc Alec wishes he could go back to that time.
* Carmen: (sounding super scripted talking to Alec) *“Dad, your anniversary is coming up with mom, isn’t it?...What are you gonna to do? I assume you’re gonna hang out with me and mom this entire anniversary.”*  Why do I get the impression this is exactly what Hilz was like as kid? [Great tea here](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1j1w1fy/some_very_olden_but_golden_tea_regarding_miss/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) where someone who grew up with Hillary Lynn describes her as *“ a pill…always needing attention and to be fawned over. She was a snob and incredibly entitled…”*
* Alec (referring to Hillary): *“we got married in 2012. Every minute I spent around her I thought she was a very special person, and she still is the most special person I've ever met in my life.”*  He said this in episode 1, too. Will he ever add more substantive adjectives? Stay tuned.
* Hilz comes in at the end and tells Alec he’s really glowing but she was prepared to lie if he wasn’t. Hillary gushes that *“Alec is a good dad, it’s beautiful to watch my children have that warm and fuzzy feeling with him, especially now.”* Yes, Hillary, having two loving parents who are alive and well is pretty nice.  

[These nails on a ten year old are reason enough to cancel Alec and Hillary.](https://preview.redd.it/3itm5l6t1mme1.png?width=910&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fb8e2c63ba3a7e73dece185e4610c70eb269f88)

**The Baldwins Enjoy Pizza**

* Romeo appears to enjoy screaming to let off steam. Marilú tries to help and drops an entire pizza.Leo yells *“the pizza’s ruined”* and Romeo keeps screaming.
* Alec wanders around instead of helping but is bummed his favorite pizza fell (it was fine).
* The Cuban incarnation of Hillary we’ve been seeing more of says to Romeo \*“oye, ¿qué pasó?”/\*Hey, what happened? And it makes my blood boil every time.

**Alec and Hilary Reflect on Their Life with Sad Piano Music**

* Hilz couch interview: *“Alec’s trial in New Mexico is coming up and that’s a scary thing to go through especially when you have seven kids right behind you that you’re supposed to maneuver through everything.”* That’s some interesting imagery. “We’re deciding do I go with Alec or stay with the kids” – she says this 100x in this episode.
* In a couch interview where he unwisely ears a long-sleeved shirt and shorts, so it looks like he’s in his underwear, Alec says: *“there was a period all this past year when I’d lay in bed and think I don’t want to get out of bed. Then I’d think to myself, my children are downstairs having breakfast. That last year was the year which I think they noticed I was really, really down. But the person who saved me was my wife because she got up. And there’s times she didn’t want to either, but she did, see that’s the difference.”*

[Oh, PeePaw.](https://preview.redd.it/ftvctds32mme1.png?width=601&format=png&auto=webp&s=350bc2318ad1870d7c735534b1da41321827f1ca)

* Hilz: *“the last few years have been hard but it’s important we keep on going and keep on working”* “We” as in Alec and the nannies, yes?
* Now we transition to a different couch interview where Hilz is dressed in all black like with two little struggle buns which really are at odds with Alec’s somber observations like: *“Opportunities for jobs have been so few and far between because of the situation, Lot of people cut my throat, lot of people cut my throat in my business. I mean they were like, hey (gives a fake laugh) hi, then gone, gone. Whatever that word is - ghosting – they just took off, they disappeared”* (looks disgruntled).

[Everything is wrong here. ](https://preview.redd.it/byara9282mme1.png?width=412&format=png&auto=webp&s=3123e2f29d98c445e2f3f284f1c30140da0d89a7)

* Hilz in the backyard: *“When you go \[to LA\] and you do this – gratitude, gratitude.  I’m grateful for work. I’m grateful for every single job. That is a kind thing, someone wants to have you there.”*
* Alec: *“I’m accepting the work, all right.”*
* Hilz: *“Right, and I’m grateful that you go. I’m grateful that you go ‘cuz you’re taking care of our family.”*  I think this is why he stays with her – his ego is constantly stroked.
* Couch Alec: *“I experienced a reversal of fortune in terms of my business, I’ve accepted the fact that I can’t be as finnicky and as picky as I’ve always been*” (as he appears on TLC, home of Dr. Pimple Popper).
* Hilz: *“This next month is gonna be really hard… I want you to know we prefer it when you’re here.  You’re not alone.”* They share a hand slap and hug.

**""8 DAYS UNTIL TRIAL"" (commercial for 90 Day Fiancé) ""7 DAYS UNTIL TRIAL""**

* Alec is in LA for a few days and all the kids are on tablets as they eat breakfast. Hillary says *“it’s pure chaos”* and she’s not wrong.  

https://preview.redd.it/zz83g7sh2mme1.png?width=840&format=png&auto=webp&s=d3f8550b67b4f4f974b5095a8024897ff28d8e5d

* Hillary says to Leo in an accent so thick I thought I was having a stroke: *“Lay down beecuss I’m gon’ poot your eardropssss”*
* **Marilú grabs Nanny Lizzy and pulls hard on the strap of her dress as Hillary stands mere feet away cool as a cucumber. Then Lizzy is on her knees trying to load a backpack while Edu is hitting her. Lizzy asks Hillary to grab a tablet and Hillary chirps** ***“grathias”*** **and goes on her merry way.**

[Hillary said not a word. ](https://preview.redd.it/kjv9884m2mme1.png?width=459&format=png&auto=webp&s=c16d09a58853403d3e249ca54d98966b867e4960)

* Couch Hillary: *“This is just the madness I have signed up for bc I had a lot of kids.”* Bullshit. There’s difference between a little disorder/high energy and piss poor parenting. The excuses continue: *“I’m trying to raise my kids the best that I can through very difficult experiences especially over the past few years.”* Cut straight to Carmen handing out cookies to the older boys and Hillary confiscating them.
* Hillary’s pearls of wisdom: *“Kids are very smart and I think parenting is walking this very difficult balance between giving the information if you don’t give them information they’re gonna fill in the blanks by themselves.”* Cut to Marilú giving Carmen the finger saying *“this is the good finger”* while Carmen explains *“they’re both not good.”* Hillary then walks over and sticks up her own middle finger and says in full accent *“hey this one is the bad one, the other one doesn’t mean anything, and this is the good one”* (thumbs up). TLC seamlessly cuts back to her yapping on the couch about her stellar parenting *“I’ve had to have very difficult conversations with our children of explaining things”*  and her kids running wild.

[She's giving ML the finger saying don't do this. ](https://preview.redd.it/6ypnkvfr2mme1.png?width=540&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b4197ef1c40b85373de18c0574e7b68e3358c8b)

* She gets Romeo outside to spray him down with sunscreen and cookies fall out of his cap as she takes it off ( I did laugh at this). Then she wanders around and says *“I los’ my cufee… pliss come”* as she tries to wrangle kids who won’t listen to her.
* Maybe an explanation for the insane accent: *“They have to see me being goofy and silly.”*  Well, she’s nailed it, then.

**Driving the Kids to Day Camp**

* As she drives to camp, Hilz is like a bad teenage babysitter: (no accent)*“There’s a dead squirrel somebody hit him, eww,  gross!”*
* She has Rafa, Leo, Romeo, Edu, and Marilú in the car while Carmen is at home watching Ilaria (presumably with two nannies and a full TLC crew). Carmen says: *“This morning I’m just watching the baby for my mom. My dad’s in LA working on this AI thing”* (huge eye roll - from Carmen, not me for once). She makes pasta with the baby and is very sweet and kind.
* Cut to couch Hillary: *“When Alec was charged the first time Carmen could not be alone for months. We had to move her bed into the boys’ room.”*
* **Hillary decides to Facetime Alec and the kids pass the phone around to see him. Edu and Marilú start tussling over the phone and Marilú screams** ***“GIVE IT BACK, BITCH! GIVE IT BACK, BITCH!”*** **I could not believe what I was watching, especially on the heels of the nannies being treated like punching bags by the kids. At this point, I legit had to stop watching because the entitlement was out of this world. How do you let your children do this? I know they are little, but they’re also allowed to be completely inappropriate.**
* Not terribly fazed by Marilú's outburst, Hilz smirks and says, *“no bad words.”* She has more of a reaction when Rafa pipes up from back seat: *“stop saying that word!”* Hillary calls from driver’s seat: *“you guys taught it to her!”*
* Hilz couch interview: *“Carmen asked should I say goodbye to daddy in a special way? Why are they trying to take my daddy from me? She lost it.”* Maybe explain in an age-appropriate way what the purpose of the trial is?
* Marilu continues acting out hitting her brother as they arrive and Hillary hops out and gives the camp staff a super chipper hello.

**Alec in LA for AI Motion Capture**

* We get an explanation of motion capture and Alec the Serious Actor tells us he was inspired by his dad’s love of movies (he gets emotional talking about this but TLC starts the zany circus background music a bit too early so it’s awkward).

https://preview.redd.it/p7pfs7173mme1.png?width=585&format=png&auto=webp&s=250c05074c38e41659d82b51c7f7415b4aa864f5

* He name drops Mike (Nichols) and Dennis (Quaid) and reminds us he appeared in *Married to the Mob* (1988), *Beetlejuice* (1988) which he didn’t understand at the time and now goes to Comic Cons to milk, and *Working Girl* (1989).
* He does an impression and notes that watching Sean Connery work on *The Hunt for Red October* was *“watching the King.”* Cut to Alec doing a move called monkey paw for AI. I’m calling the editor an honorary pepino.
* Alec continues bloviating: *“I had a lot of good years, y’know we did some TV shows, some 30 Rock and did a good job but with some of the unpleasantries we’ve had to deal with* (holy crap is this a bad euphemism), *with seven children the biggest challenge for me honestly is to spend time with them individually. Everything’s better when I am with them. It’s hard, it’s hard when I can’t be there.”*  Well, if your wife weren’t a blithering idiot, it might be easier, my guy.

 **Fun with Hillary, Carmen, and Saint Michael**

* Somber title card: 5 DAYS UNTIL TRIAL
* Hillary lounges on the floor of Carmen’s room in a yellow romper with a black bra sticking out:
   * Hilz: “*Can I show you what I have in this bag? So, you know it’s our anniversary coming up?*”
   * Carmen: *“Yeah”*
   * Hilz: “*Do you know what I always do for anniversaries?*
   * Carmen: *“No”*
   * Hilz: *“So, I look up on a website what’s the traditional and what’s the modern gift.”*
   * Carmen: *“Yeah, you gave dad like a piece of leather one year.”*
   * Hilz: *“So this year, pearls is one and, no I didn’t get like real pearls I got something creepy.”*
   * Carmen: (looking worried) *“Now I’m scared.”*
   * Hilz: (smiling) *“You should be a little scared actually. And then the other one is silk* (holds up a silk handkerchief) *so this is Saint Michael in silk!*”

https://preview.redd.it/0umck32j3mme1.png?width=953&format=png&auto=webp&s=065bf8f6803cd98a6f4800363d8b07eb8aaeb387

* Hilz in couch interview: “*In my very bad moments I will let my mind start to wander and spiral and think about what’s the worst-case scenario.”* (Back to talking to Carmen) *“You know we’re going through some very hard things this summer, yeah? And so, I got him a necklace of Saint Michael.”* Carmen: *“Cute”*
* Hilz: (couch interview) *“I believe that the worst-case scenario is if they can convince people to find him guilty they will take him away right there.* (Back to Carmen’s room) *It says we’re here to protect you, stand with you, love you. You are not alone. Somos el mejor equipo. Que Dios te bendiga hoy y siempre.”* I will be having words with Saint Michael in my prayers soon and explaining that he’s being conned.
* Hilz (couch): “*Whether or not I go to New Mexico, I want him to know, I’m always by his side. I’m always with him and I hope that this gift will be something that he can hold with him every single day and know that I am by his side.”* Well, unless being by his side entails going to see him in New Mexico right after the shooting. And at this point “five days before the trial” she’s really saying she’s undecided if she is going or not, so he better hold onto his holy hanky.

[When she can't squeeze out a tear, she makes these types of faces. ](https://preview.redd.it/qxbcsito3mme1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=cb2c58239dd5fca0205387d2bab0418c275975b4)

* Back in Carmen’s room, both Hilz and Carmen are grossed out and shocked that pearls come from oysters. Hilz ordered freshwater pearls and as she’s opening the plastic pouch one comes in, she says, “*This is so gross…I didn’t think I was buying real pearls, I thought I was buying plastic.”* She reads the description form her Amazon cart: *“10-piece freshwater live pearl oyster with round pearl inside for pearl gift, fun for children!”* Y’all. She bought real oysters that the manufacturer stuffed fake plastic pearls into.
   * Carmen: *“No stop it, that’s scary. So now we’re ordering seafood from Amazon?”*
   * Hilz (scrunching nose): *“It does have a weird smell! Do you have any like tools, like tweezers? Go get your tweezers.”*  Am I a bad mom? My ten-year-old daughter did not have tweezers.
   * Carmen: (crawling away): *“No it stinks, I can smell it from here!”*
   * Hilz: *“Come on don’t leave me alone, you’re gonna abandon me? Go, go, go!”*
   * Carmen: (walking back into room) *“Ok I got goggles”*
   * Hilz: *“Protection first!”* It’s safety first, you birdbrain. They put the goggles on because they’re so quirky and weird. They proceed to shuck the oysters right on the rug in Carmen’s room, making a mess but giggling through it. Of course, Hillary says *“ay, ay, ay.”*
   * Carmen says, *“I don’t think these are real pearls.”* and Hillary says *“I will learn to always read the description from now on. Lesson learned.”*  How about an English syntax lesson?

[Upper left was me this whole episode. ](https://preview.redd.it/tckm7svx3mme1.png?width=578&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1533f2c4632133eaee691a443d7cec6147638be)

**Hillary visits her friend/paid interior designer, Danny, who was conveniently featured in Hillary’s stories just two days ago**

* Danny opens the door and says, *“Hello friend!”* Just in case it was unclear that they’re friends, y’all. Hilly walks in and says, *“it looks so nice in here!”* It’s as blue, beige, and bland as the spaces he designed for her.
* Hillary says *“Danny is one of my very best friends, I have known him for 12 years”* opening hers eyes wide, like that’s a huge feat. Ma’am you hired him with Alec’s money once you were married.

https://preview.redd.it/04qvgnx34mme1.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=0dce9c1819002334b9c630cd572465bf78905ef6

* He pours her an enormous glass of wine they laugh about, and she explains in a couch interview: *“my family doesn’t live close, and Alec’s family doesn’t live close* (he’s very close to his sisters who both live in New York, but ok) *so my friends have stepped in as family. We are so close, we show up for each other and during hard experience you learn who your friends are.”*
* Danny: *“With everything that’s been going on, I mean, like, we always talk about the kids and everybody else. How are YOU doing coping with all the pressure that you’re under and everything that’s going on.”*
* Hillary Lynn delivers her version of an Oscar-worthy performance:
   * Runs tongue over lips thoughtfully (I’m caught off-guard)
   * Smiles sadly (You know me so well)
   * Purses lips and rolls eyes (I’m getting so emotional)
   * Says *“umm”* shakily and puts birdbath wine glass down (I’m leaning into my emotions)
   * Danny: *“I don’t wanna make you sad.”* Listen, buddy, we know this is a planned and choreographed if not scripted interaction, conserve a shred of dignity.
   * Hilz: *“You’re not making me sad, I mean maybe I’m sad”* (looking up to keep nonexistent years in) *“Um, I don’t know how to answer that”* (yet you keep yip yapping) *“I’m in war mode. My guess is I’m not doing well…”* (waves finger about wildly)

https://preview.redd.it/b3xkmgtb4mme1.png?width=814&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8bf24d6db0be2f0caad570dc087150dee52a0ed

 

* Danny: *“but you don’t know it yet…”*
* Hilz: *“…and I won’t acknowledge that because I don’t have the ability to because if I do, then I’ll break. And hopefully they’ll be swift”* (who will be swift?) *“And I’ll get it out if the way so it doesn’t affect anyone else”* Wut? I think she’s trying to say she hopes her eventual emotional breakdown will be fast, so no one is impacted. Please. She is sitting on a show about her life, making this about herself and her feelings. This is her fourth- or fifth-time fake crying in two episodes. Minimizing the impact on others is not in her DNA.
* She is talking so fast Danny looks like a deer in headlights, but the Hillary train of self-righteousness is only picking up steam and she runs right over that deer: “*And I think that’s what it’s like to be a mom, and* \[blahblah\] *a son lost his mom!”*
* Danny: *“yes!”* You’re adding nothing, friend, shush.
* Hilz: *“A family lost their person”*
* Cut to couch interview with accent careening off the tracks: *“Halyna lost her life in the most unforeseeable tragedy. This is never something to forget. This is never something to not think of. Thees ees abou honoring a rilly incredible person for the rest of our lifesss. And to pass on her memory to our children and our children’s children.”* It would be more convincing if you didn’t sound utterly deranged, Hillary.
* Back to Danny’s house: (no accent) *“It was a very traumatic thing for everybody that was in that room and everybody that was somehow connected to it. I don’t know what we’re gonna do.”* Annnnnnd, scene.
* Commercial for Jay & Pamela (engaged little couple)
* We’re still at Danny’s beige wonderland and Hillary is still droning on: *“it was a very traumatic thing for everybody that was in that room* (the editing is messy) *“I found these text messages the other day between us, you know, the day after and he said he wanted to kill himself”* (Danny closes his eyes and nods quietly).

https://preview.redd.it/r25xa1fi4mme1.png?width=573&format=png&auto=webp&s=36245e144507dc54491ff326d071ac8aabe5fdb8

*  Back to the couch and now she sounds angry as well as vaguely Spanish: *“He has survivor’s guilt! You’re involved in this thing that nobody could even possibly imagine and so he goes back to, um, that day. He wishes it were him* (swallows hard, still no tears). *He would change places in a second.”*  It’s not as noble as she tries to make it out to be bc it’s not an option.
* Danny: *“I remember being on the phone with him in the days after the situation happened and it was speaking to a completely traumatized person. I mean, I remember him just walking through the sequence of events like of just starting from when he showed up in New Mexico to film, it was heart-wrenching because he was like so traumatized, he’s so heart-broken; he was just trying to figure out what the hell even just happened…”*
* TLC edits in the footage of the moment Alec was told Halyna died. As this is on the screen, Hillary says, *“he’ll never be the same.”* I’m clearly not the audience for this because I don’t give a good goddamn how Alec Baldwin feels.
* Hillary on the couch: *“This has affected his health and his mental health tremendously* (cut to her looking sad on Danny’s couch bc she’s not looking sad enough on the confessional couch) *“for the past few years all of a sudden he’s started having heart problems he’s been hospitalized multiple times* (she has the nerve to sound angry)  *“and I, ah, he’s, you, he’s fainted and everybody’s screaming and I’m going on top and shaking him* (mimes shaking him and they cut to another shot of her looking sad and fidgeting with her wedding ring at Danny’s). *“It’s hard sometimes, but um, you know, hopefully we’re in the hardest but the tail end of it.”*

[So delighted to be talking about herself.](https://preview.redd.it/2jrqwdwm4mme1.png?width=514&format=png&auto=webp&s=a575a977ee33b0143688fd2bbddb210abeccea8e)

* Hilz: *“I need to ask your advice about something. You know that Alec has to go to New Mexico soon. Do we all go? Do we stay together cuz that’s what we’re used to, I mean we’re a very tight-knit family, we’re always together. Do I stay with the kids and he goes and has to do that by himself? I mean I don’t know what to do and I know that any decision I make will have some very wrong things about it.”*
* Danny: *“Or will feel wrong.”*
* Hilz: *“Or will feel wrong, I mean there’s no way to make any of this feel better. And I know that I’m gonna get criticized no matter what* (ah, there’s the point of this!) *I’m gonna get criticized if I go and I’m a bad mom and I have left my kids. I’m gonna get criticized if I stay, then I’m a bad wife* (she’s in her element talking about herself – her absolute favorite subject). *I’m gonna, you know, if I bring them, I’m using them as a pawn.”*
* Danny: *“I think you have to try to remove that from the equation. You can’t be worried about what other people are gonna think about it, you have to worry about how to get through it with your kids. The kids were already anxious about this, I mean Carmen is anxious to begin with* (wow), *I mean she’s concerned about her brothers, her sisters, like that’s her personality so this already has her on edge and she’s older where she knows more what’s going on.”*
* **Hilz:** ***“No, you’re right, she came to me and she started to cry and she said I’m afraid that when you and Daddy go into court that somebody’s gonna shoot you*** **(WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE).** ***I can’t lose both of my parents, they’re gonna hurt you, and you’re not gonna come back.”***

**“4 DAYS UNTIL TRIAL”**

* Relatable shot of the whole family on their extra-large golf cart on the grounds of their beautiful Hamptons home. Alec is driving holding Edu, Carmen and Romeo are up front with him, Hillary is in the middle with Ilaria, and Raf and Leo are in the back seat.

https://preview.redd.it/kii40azw4mme1.png?width=659&format=png&auto=webp&s=71bb228183e2db8ca9d789b4736d25cf7635a417

* They drive past two horses and Hillary calls out, *“which horse is that, do you guys remember which one that is?”* Kids call out *“Sonador”* and Alec says *“Sona – dor”* while Edu screams *“Sonador is mine!”* Hillary says *“yes that’s Sonador”* then she quickly corrects herself and adds the ñ: *“Soñador, that’s right!”* Clearly, they all call him Sonador with no ñ, give it up Hilz.
* Couch Hilz: *“When something bad happens and you have to look at the kids and you have to say, you know, I’m gonna put a smile on my face and we’re gonna fake it.”* This is interspersed with a shot of the golf cart where Carmen is holding her phone and looking very put out to be there. *“It’s extraordinarily difficult when you feel so horrible inside and so scared.”*
* They get out and Alec carries Ilaria still calling her “baby” and “big girl” anything but her name. Marilu sweetly carries a bunch of carrots.
* Alec couch interview: *“With the trial inching closer, inching closer, I’m just trying really hard to have time with them individually. It’s time that they can’t get back. I don’t wanna have that regret.”*
* Hillary: (full Speedy Gonzalez) *“Let go get the stuff an’ clean the poop!* (Lingering shots of horse poop – an apt metaphor). They pick up the poop as Alec chats with them.
* Alec couch interview: *“I think all children are so connected to their parents they take a lot of things off their parents. When I was a kid and I was home, and home wasn’t at all was we might have hoped it would be. My dad was always, you know, a little on edge, financially struggling every day of his life, every day. He had six kids and no money. My mother had no help, she, there was a period in my mother’s life where she popped a bunch of pills and went to sleep every day and she was really, really, she was like, lost.”*

*  In clear contrast to poor, depressed Carol Baldwin, the editors cut to Stupid Spice who I would argue is just as lost:

* Back to the family at the horse farm – Alec smilingly whispers to Rafa *“I have to make this call I have to get your mother an anniversary present.”*
* Couch Alec: *“Then I left home, and I didn’t have a home. I walked around for 35 years, I didn’t have a home, and when I met Hilaria, I had a home.”* That must feel lovely for Kim and Ireland.
* In the barn, Alec is talking on the phone: *“it’s the white gold pearl earrings Morning Dew earrings, can you overnight them?”*
* Couch Alec: *“I wanted this. I wanted kids, to walk into a door (wut) and really feel like it was home”*

**“2 DAYS UNTIL TRIAL”/Wedding Anniversary**

* The big kids are playing on motorized mini-ATVs and have face paint on. Scarface has entered the chat (Hillary in full accent): *“why don ju wipe uff jor face pain’, ok?”*  Edu wipes his off at some point and is left with a bright red face – keep this in mind.
* Couch Hilz: “*We have been parenting from a near empty tank* (cut to Marilu having a tantrum and Leo throwing a doll in the pool) *and while I always try to be fun, my kids, like many many other kids are intuitive and they’re smart. And they know when I’m coming from a place of a pit in my stomach .”*
* Carmen goes to hug Hillary asking: *“where’s dad?”* and Hilz has her move over so the camera can get a better angle of the hug. Alec’s assistant’s face is blurred out as he stands among the chaos of ML screaming. Leo driving the little SUV in circles with Ilaria in there with him, and Alec is looking for the card he misplaced.
* [As they’re exchanging gifts – all hell is breaking loose](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1j2zo03/its_not_just_the_accento_hillary_haywardthomas/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button): **Edu wants popcorn and is asking for it on repeat, Rafa is saying** ***“mom, mom, mom, I want pasta,”*** **poor ML is still crying, Leo gets right in front of the camera and shakes his head, the baby grabs the fake pearls and no one is worried she’ll eat them. A. MESS.**
* Alec is confused by the gift he’s handed: *“what is that?”* Hilz clarifies *“Archangel Saint Michael”* Hold my cider. This broad. It’s either “Saint Michael the Archangel” “Archangel Michael” or “Saint Michael.”
* Alec is confused about the function of a necklace and also miffed the necklace doesn’t fit him (*“is this a necklace to wear around my neck? When you know someone long enough, you’d think you’d know \[their size\]”).* Above it all Hillary’s baby voice cuts through in full Chiquita Banana mode: *“Du ju wanna know wha’ eet says? This ees Saint Michael, this ees Saint Michael. He’s, he ees the saint of protection.”* Alec deadpans *“let’s get his cell phone number.”*  
* Couch Hilz (no accent): *“I think one of the most important things when we are facing challenges is to know something bigger than us, regardless of what you believe, because faith will guide us out of this dark period.”* Or, y’know, witches, hexes, Palo Santo (con respeto), yoga, dip bruths, Living Clealry, Care Bears, etc.
* Back to the messy gift giving, Alec says: *“What does the last part mean in Spanish? I can’t read, my eyes are so bad.”* Also, Alec doesn’t speak Spanish. That may be influencing is inability to read what’s on the gift.
   * Hilz: (reading) *“Que Dios te bendiga hoy y siempre.""*
   * Alec: *“What does that mean?""*
   * Hilz: *“May God bless you today and, eh, forever. Maybe it will fit you, it can be a choker.”* Edu is now screaming at the top of his lungs, Carmen and Ila join in for fun and Alec tries to put the too small necklace on saying *“it’s not even close”* and Hilz is shocked it doesn’t fit.
* Alec is exasperated with Edu screaming about popcorn (to be fair he had been asking for a loooong time) and says firmly, *“go inside, Eduardo.”* Then, looking pissed, he makes eye contact with the nanny holding Ila and says to her about Edu’s face paint, *“I would like to try figure out, not now, how we’re gonna get the paint off his face.”*
   * Hilz snaps back: *“It will come off Alec, let him be a kid. It’s just face paint.""*
   * Alec: (sarcastically) *“I don’t want him to keep it on. I’m sorry, what else could go wrong? It’s the most romantic anniversary ever. It’s been so good.”*
   * Hilz (offended, no more accent): *“You know what? I tried.”* She gets up and walks away as Carmen is saying she wants them to swim together. Hillary tells her *“Literally give me five, ten minutes”* as Alec rubs his face wearily.
* TLC commercial for 90 Day Fiancé
* Marilu wants Hillary attention as she’s trying to walk away and Hilz tells her *“Carmen is going to give you a spa.”* Carmen (who wants to go swimming with Hilz) says *“no I’m not”* Hillary replies *“yes you are, yes come”* and marches away with ML.
* Alec says to the TLC crew: *“What did I get my wife?”* (grabs small white bag he had on the floor) “*well, I tried to hit the ball right down the middle so here we go.”* He takes out a box tied with a ribbon and sets it down beside him next to his card to Hillary.
   * Hillary: (comes back sighing exaggeratedly and looking sheepish) *“That was a traumatic present giving. It was supposed to be meaningful* (waving hands and smiling, obviously contrite). *“Let me try again:  so, you have a box that’s protection* (zany music starts playing and Alec starts smiling) “*then inside the box is the silk, ummmm…""*
   * Alec: *“…real silk…”*
   * Hilz: *“…pocket square that was real silk not the pearl""*
   * Alec: *“…that was beautiful I love it …”*
   * Hilz: *“Anyway I want you to think that you’re never alone and you’re protected.""*
   * Alec: (tersely) *“I know that”*
   * Hilz: (looking at Alec’s card to her which is open) *“Did you open up my card?”*
   * Alec: *“Yes”*
   * Hilz (laughing maniacally) “You gave me a card and you wrapped it, and you opened it up for me?”
   * Alec: “*Yeah, ‘cause I wanted to hasten this along.”*
   * Hilz: *“Oh my gosh, this is the, 12 years is the express, the express anniversary.”* Alec opens the card and hands it to her, she reads it aloud: *“H. Very soon this will be behind us and then we can rebuild our lives. We have so many reasons to move on in peace. Love, A.”*
   * Alec: *“We’re going to.”*
   * Hilz (in a little girl whisper looking sad) *“I hope so.”*
   * Alec: (smiling and holding the box with her gift) *“You know when you think of pearls, and you wanna get something that’s kinda nice…”*
   * Hilz: *“Ok, so you went with the real pearls”*
   * Alec: *“You don’t know that. You don’t know if I ordered smelly, rotten oysters* (Hilz is babbling as he’s talking but idk what she’s saying) *“I know you and you probably won’t like these. I like them”*
   * Hilz: *“This is where our age difference sometimes…”*
   * Alec: *“Yeah your generation has no taste, and my generation has sublime taste.”*
   * Hilz: (smiling and sitting up) *“Ok”*
   * Alec: (showing simple pearl earrings to the camera) *“Shall we?”*
   * Hilz: *“They’re so pretty. That’s very sweet, thank you so much. Thank you, I love them. Thank you.”* (Gives him a hug)
   * Alec: *“See it's perfect”* (as Hillary puts the earrings on)

[So appreciative.](https://preview.redd.it/8v8yg5ay5mme1.png?width=664&format=png&auto=webp&s=0438722442e95de7012303c76b7d6b570fad1248)

* Hilz: *“How are you feeling about me coming with you? I want to be there.”*
* Alec: *“Let’s not ruin our anniversary.”*
* Hilz: (smiling coyly) *“It’s on my mind.”*
* Alec: *“My mind is not made up.”*
* Couch Hilz: (accent starts mild then gets extra spicy) *“We have to go to New Mexico because Alec has to go on trial and we’re deciding do I go with Alec or do I stay with the kids? He wants me to stay here with the kids but he’s also the kind of guy that will never ask for help. And if he’s sick, he’s like the animal that will just go off into the woods and die alone. He’s rilly bahd abou’ asking for help which means that I haf to be there uh lot to take car ruff him.”*
* Hilz: (back to their convo outside, accent starting up again) “*Don’t you think it’s gonna be easier for you if I’m there with you?”*
* Alec: *“Um, that depends on how it’s going. If we walk out after day 3 and 4 and 5 and these guys are coming back saying they’re very encouraged by the way things went down, then we’re in pretty good shape.”*
* Couch Alec: *“I want to protect her. I don’t want her to suffer. It’s been tough on her.”*
* Hilz: *“You don’t want me to be there if you feel like it’s not going well?”*
* Alec: “I think if for any reason it didn’t go well, um, if it doesn’t go well we have to sell those earrings right way.”
* Hilz: (laughing) *“I’ll keep them in good shape. I’m gonna bring the baby and Carmen I think Carmen is gonna come and help me with her, and hopefully she’ll, and I’m afraid to you know, I’m very afraid to leave all the kids here.”* So it sounds like it’s decided, then.
*  [Alec looks stressed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/HilariaBaldwin/comments/1j151ps/hillary_finally_admits_what_weve_been_saying_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), eyes closed, running his hands through his hair as he sits in his gorgeous home located in one of the most expensive real estate markets in the country.
* Hillary asks if he’s ok then clambers up on the outdoor couch he’s sitting on (no sitting like a normal person for our gal) and leans into him with her bra just hanging all the way out. She faces away from Alec as he pets her arm, and she fidgets with rings that could probably pay off my mortgage:
   * Hilz: *“We’ve been through a lot, you know”* Full inexplicable Chicana accent. I paused at this point and got myself a hard cider before continuing.
   * Alec: *“I don’t know where I’d be without you. I say this all the time but I’m very grateful to you. You’ve been very patient. I know a lot of people who would have said, I can’t handle this, you know.”*
   * *Hilz:* (breathy sigh) “*Yeah. I don’t know what our life is gonna be like next year.”* Again with the accent, bless the makers of hard cider.
   * Alec: “*Don’t go anywhere.”*  Sir, stop playing. She’s staying put with the multi millions and she will keep hoarding kids and pets while chasing the limelight.
   * **Hilz: (vocal fry alert)*****“No I’m here. I’m crazy but I’m scrappy. And I’m very stubborn.”*** **Sadly, she means crazy like “I’m quirky & kooky” and not like “I have a disordered personality, and I appropriate Spanish culture to boost my spice level.”**
   * Alec: *“I don’t ever wanna be without you.”* That’s the bottom line: he fears being alone so much that tied himself to this cuckoo clock by having 7 kids and agreeing to feed into her delusion about being Spanish.
   * Hilz: *“It’s gonna be ok. It’s gonna be ok”* (looks up at Alec who is doing a dramatic pause before delivering his next scripted line)
   * Alec: *“Happy anniversary”*
   * Hilz: *“Happy anniversary”*

1j34h83,https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/1j34h83/tips_in_a_shortage/,Tips in a shortage,"Went to the shops today (Carindale) and saw a poor store worker sweating as he was trying to restock and hand out water to people coming up and broke my heart to see elderly people staring at the empty shelves 😭 so i thought id offer tips for people who either missed out or aren’t picky as long as they have something. 

- worst case scenario, fill a CLEAN bath with water and obviously don’t let anyone touch it. maybe cover it with cling wrap if you’re pressed but in an emergency it’s good to have. in russia ive known people to fill up theirs before winter so they have access to water easier

- fill up old water bottles or any bottle type containers. fill up normal containers, empty out old unused containers in your pantry like coffee, alcohol, milk that’s about to go off. just give it a good wash and store what you need from those containers in glad wrap bags if possible. i even washed a kefir bottle and used that just in case i lose water and need to wash my face 🥲

- don’t forget to put aside water for your pets in case their water bowl runs out and put aside some water for washing your face or maybe get some makeup wipes/baby wipes

feel like these are pretty obvious but a few of my friends didn’t think of it and are panic buying huge bottles of water they don’t necessarily need. obviously if you’re not stressed about the cyclone ignore me because this isn’t for you but instead for people who do feel like they should prepare a little bit. 

for other things, stop buying out bread and long life milk :’) once you open the milk you need to refrigerate it and i know no one is drinking a litre of milk in one sitting. i personally bought dry snack foods bc i don’t care about meals but ‘girl dinner’ is a lot more appealing than cold soup to be honest so i’ve got assortments of carby snacks and non refrigerated fruits and vegetables. if you can’t find a power bank but have a laptop, use that as a power bank for your phone or usb charged lamps and other things. it might not last as long but will work long enough to charge your phone up once or twice for emergencies. 

write your details on a tag for pets on their harness/collar in case they need to be left with friends, a shelter or somehow manage to run away. cut up a tube sock for certain sized animals to block their ears if they’re known to be skittish around storms. i bought my cat some treats for during and after so she feels a little more at ease but that’s also because my cat is very fat hahah and loves a good treat. think of your little babies who don’t know what’s happening 

AND if you don’t have access to sandbags, worst case scenario jam an old towel under doors and seal that bitch up with cloth tape then seal along the doors. (not saying this will stop water but again, worst case scenario)

i wrote this up for people who are struggling a little bit or feel like they need to prepare but can’t because of shortages. i’m not saying you need to prepare but they’re good tips to have anyways or good thinking points to come up with something better. alfie could be a total fraud but if anything in this post makes you feel a little more prepared it’s the least i can do to ease some stress i know some people are feeling. good luck! let’s hope it buffers out and doesn’t hit as hard 


edited to add: if you don’t have a bath! buy some big storage tubs, clean it and fill it with water. could be better for people who have a few more people to look out for that don’t have access to a bath or need an extra supply of water ",100,1741069149.0,brisbane,47,0.95,False

1️⃣ Lack of Calcium & Vitamin D 🥛🌞 – Calcium and vitamin D deficiency [weakens bones](https://www.ayushakti.com/remedies/category/o/osteoarthritis/). Get sunlight and consume dairy, sesame seeds, and leafy greens.

2️⃣ Too Much Caffeine & Sugar ☕🍬 – Excess coffee, tea, and foods reduce calcium absorption, making bones brittle.

3️⃣ Sedentary Lifestyle 🏋️‍♂️ – Lack of exercise leads to weaker bones. Engage in weight-bearing activities like walking, yoga, and strength training.

4️⃣ Excess Acidic Foods 🍞🍟 – Processed foods, carbonated drinks, and junk food cause mineral depletion, weakening bones over time.

5️⃣ Hormonal Imbalance 🩸 – Low estrogen levels in women and testosterone in men can reduce bone density. [Ayushakti’s ](https://www.ayushakti.com/)Ayurvedic herbs help balance hormones naturally.

6️⃣ Low Magnesium & Zinc Intake 🥜🥦 – These minerals are crucial for bone health. Include nuts, seeds, and vegetables in your diet.

My best friend has had a lot happen to her in the past 5 years including the loss of her dog and her father. There have been good things like her marriage, birth of her daughter, and getting her dream job. All for which I was there for.. the bad and the good. She’s been there for me too, but our friendship mostly revolved/revolves around her life and her problems as my problems aren’t bad enough to care if I get much space to talk about them to her and I don’t have a partner or children so my life is less complicated. That being said, I did have a dog who was 12 year old and he started getting sick a few weeks ago and I was really struggling because I knew we were nearing the end, but I was keeping him comfy and keeping an eye on him knowing at any point I’d have to make a decision on his quality of life (something she’s actually been through). She was being so negative about it all when I tried to lean on her that I had to tell her to stop being so negative about it because it was causing me a lot of added anxiety. She agreed to, but we just stopped talking about him and I sort of bounced back as he seemed to be bouncing back.

A week and a half goes by and one day he’s not okay and I end up having to go to the emergency vet and put him down. It was 2 Thursdays ago. I told her via text and she sent very loving apolgoies and came over the next afternoon and brought coffee and something to nibble on. I thought it was super sweet and she let me cry and talk about it for a little bit, but then turned the conversation to her issues that we had been talking about for months now on a nearly daily basis. She ended up crying about her problems and I hugged her and she left. She came over again that Sunday and proceeded to do the same thing. Giving me little time to talk about my grief. 

I feel guilty for being incredibly hurt that she couldn’t give me just one day of focusing on my grief, especially less than 24 hours after my actual best friend of 12 years had passed instead of adding more to my plate by complaining about her issues. I specifically feel guilty because she was sweet enough to come over and bring me things both times. I feel like I’m being ungrateful because she was nice enough to bring me things and I know other people have problems too and I’m not trying to downplay those. Something just seems off balance in our friendship and it just seems unfair. Am I the asshole for being incredibly hurt? So much so that it’s making me re-evaluate our friendship.

1j34ft7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Brompton/comments/1j34ft7/how_usable_is_a_large_borough_bag_in_terms_of/,How usable is a large Borough bag in terms of space?,"To clarify, I use a 30l rucksack with capacity for a coffee cup and water bottle on the outside.  Tall form factor fits my laptop, good flask, extra coffee cup and assorted office paraphernalia. Oh and waterproof trousers just in case. The laptop fits on portrait as does my A5 filofax (yes I'm 80's man when it comes to organisation system).

This form factor in used to. Everything fits in and everything has it's place. Efficient for me. No need to change if it were not for my side pockets starting to fall apart.

So another £43 sees me with a new rucksack exactly like what works for me now. Or £145 bite the bullet and get a single use case bag for the front of my brompton. What works vs what might work better, or might not?  Better being defined by my experience being better. Never having tried such a bag there is no way of finding out without a £145 taster expense (plus a £43 afterwards if it doesn't work).

So to anyone with a large Borough bag,  do you think I would get all my daily carry to fit this landscape forum factor? Can a flat laptop fit in with the flask and other stuff or would that be awkward due to the landscape form factor? I've never used a courier bag shape before so have no idea.

Estimated load volume nearer 26 litres but 30l needed to fit it in without being squashed and to air access to things.",1,1741068988.0,Brompton,6,0.66,False

1j34ee9,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1j34ee9/birthday_godroll_magic/,Birthday godroll magic.,"So. I woke up 2 hours earlier before work, had a bad sleep. Would be cool to kill some time and run couple of GMs, because I did not run GMs at all this week? So, I grabbed some coffee and birthday cake and went for it.

My desired roll for Palindrome was:

– Hammer Forged Rifling
– Accurized rounds
– Outlaw
– Magnificent Howl
– Range MW

And with a huge grain of luck I wanted Elemental capacitor as alternative perk instead of Outlaw.

May not be perfect, but it was my wish.

Imagine the volume of my scream when I got the EXACT 6/6 DESIRED ROLL from the first and only GM run this week. 

Damn, I can't even remember when I got this lucky with a roll. Last time I remember is getting 5/5 (6/6 with desired kill clip) Immortal Adept on the first Lightfall trials with the 3rd roll. 

Well, at least I can go to work now with a huge morale boost",28,1741068832.0,DestinyTheGame,5,0.87,False
