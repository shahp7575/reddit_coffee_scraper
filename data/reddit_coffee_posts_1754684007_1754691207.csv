1ml8n1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/1ml8n1k/this_time_i_didnt_get_outbid/,This time I didn‚Äôt get outbid!,"I‚Äôve been looking for a house with enough land to have my horse at home for a few years. Properties that are suitable and affordable are very few and far between and they move quickly for over asking every time they appear. Earlier this year I was so close but ended up being outbid by a cash buyer.  It was 10 acres with a little spring fed pond and a house with plenty of room to grow into so losing it hurt even though I know better than to get my hopes up. 

But finally a place popped up that was over 100k under my max budget. It‚Äôs only two acres but perfectly flat and square so it is all useable for paddock space while still looking tidy. And it is cheap enough that I can actually afford a nice shelter and fencing right away instead of discount options until I can save more. The house is smaller than I‚Äôd like (1200 sq ft) but it‚Äôs adorable and I can definitely make it work. 

I offered 325‚Ä¶ 15k over asking and thankfully that was enough for them to accept my offer without doing the whole request for highest and best from the top three offers routine. 

I was starting to lose hope that I would ever find a house. This is probably not my forever home but it will allow me to spend my horse‚Äôs last years pampering her and watching her graze while I drink my coffee on the porch. I‚Äôm so excited I can barely focus on work and I‚Äôve been sleeping about as well as a kid on Christmas Eve.

Memory transcription subject: Dani, Art Teacher at 6th Avenue Elementary School, LAUSD

Date \[standardized human time\]: September 2, 2136

I leaned against my desk, watching my students trickle back into the classroom, their faces bright with post-recess energy. Sunlight streamed in through the tall windows lining one wall, casting warm patterns across the tiled floor and illuminating the colorful posters and student projects that adorned every available surface. The familiar scent of crayons, dry erase markers, and the faintest trace of peanut butter from someone's lunch lingered in the air.

We were all settling back into the well-worn rhythms of a normal school day, but my mind was decidedly elsewhere - fixed on a plan that was anything but routine, and that I knew would land me in hot water with the authorities if they ever found out. But I had made my decision; today would be the day I set my plan in motion.

Today, I was about to commit what the United Nations would classify as an unauthorized diplomatic action. The penalty could be severe‚Äîlosing my teaching license, prison, or possibly worse. But watching Maya Patel arrange her pencils in perfect symmetry, or Jayden Thompson secretly feeding his pet beetle in a ventilated mint tin, I knew these children had something to offer that no diplomatic envoy could provide.

As the last stragglers found their seats, I raised my voice just enough to settle the room. ""Alright, everyone, listen up! Today, we're doing something special.""

Twenty-five pairs of curious eyes turned my way. I could practically feel their attention snap into focus, like a swiveling spotlight.

""Instead of our usual Wednesday writing lesson, we're going to make some art!"" I announced with a grin.

A collective cheer erupted from the students, their small hands already twitching toward the supply shelves.

""What kind of art?"" Ava asked eagerly, already halfway out of her seat. At the next cluster of desks, Ethan and Mia were exchanging gleeful grins, mentally consigning their least-favorite subject to oblivion. I couldn't help smiling at their enthusiasm.

""Well, I want you all to imagine that you have a very special pen pal,"" I said, my voice taking on a conspiratorial note. ""Someone from another planet - maybe even a venlil.""

The mere mention of their name sent a ripple of excitement around the room; ever since the news of first contact, it was all any of them could talk about.

""And your job is to show them what life on Earth is like - all the things that make our world special and unique. Things you love, things that make you happy. Can you do that?""

Hands shot up like fireworks.

""Yes, Mia?"" I said, nodding to a girl with dark braids in the front row.

""Can I draw a picture of my dog?"" she asked, practically bouncing in her seat. ""I want to show them how much I love Boomer.""

I hesitated. Domestic predators were most definitely on the UN's list of forbidden subjects in any sanctioned communication with the venlil. Even a child's innocent drawing of a beloved pet could be seen as a veiled threat.

But if I was already committing to this unsanctioned exercise in diplomacy, what was one more small risk?

""I think that's a wonderful idea,"" I said warmly. ""As long as you focus on why Boomer is so special to you. Remember, we want them to see the good parts about Earth.""

Mia beamed, clearly delighted by this permission. Around her, more hands waved eagerly.

""I'm gonna draw my baby brother!"" Amara announced, not bothering to raise her hand.

""I want to draw a baseball game!"" called Miguel from the back.

""Can I make a picture of Disney World?"" Harper's voice rose above the others.

""I want to draw the beach,"" Caleb mused, his eyes distant. ""With the big waves and the seagulls and everything.""

""I'm going to draw pizza!"" shouted Lisa.

Warmth expanded in my chest like a balloon, and I had to take a breath past the sudden tightness in my throat. This - this pure, unfiltered enthusiasm - was exactly what I hoped to capture.

""Those all sound perfect,"" I managed. ""You can draw absolutely anything that you think shows the best parts of life on Earth.""

All around the room, more voices chimed in, growing louder and more animated by the second as they bounced ideas off each other. Listening to them, I felt a flutter of emotion - something bright and aching and hopeful - swelling in my chest until I thought it might burst. This was it, this was what I wanted the venlil to see: Humanity at its most innocent and openhearted, untainted by politics or suspicion.

Smiling so hard my cheeks hurt, I reached into the cabinet behind me and retrieved stacks of heavyweight drawing paper‚Äîthe good stuff I'd been saving for a special occasion. I distributed bundles of colored pencils, markers, and crayons, watching as the classroom transformed.

The wild energy of moments before condensed into a quiet hum of concentration‚Äîthe scratching of crayons against paper, occasional delighted outburst as someone shared a new idea, the soft snap of marker caps being removed and replaced.

Slipping into instructor mode, I wandered between the desks, watching the drawings take shape with a sense of breathless anticipation. Already, I could see glimpses of color and life blooming across the pages.

The more I saw, the more my conviction solidified into something hard and gem like inside me. Lucas had drawn his family's cozy kitchen in loving detail, right down to the clove of garlic and pot of tomato sauce. Zoe was recreating her grandparents' farm, chickens pecking contentedly between rows of emerald corn.

Jaqueline, with her flyaway blonde hair, was meticulously outlining a towering sunflower, its golden petals stretching toward a bright blue sky. Next to her, Caleb adjusted his glasses as he sketched the beginnings of a beach scene, complete with a smiling stick figure family standing next to a lopsided sandcastle.

Liam had drawn a detailed map of a neighborhood park, with swings, a slide, and even a tiny ice cream truck. His tongue poked out in concentration while he was carefully coloring the leaves on the trees a vibrant green.

Some, to my secret amusement, had taken the prompt more literally; I counted at least four ""portraits"" of smiling, cartoony creatures that could only be venlil, complete with speech bubbles saying things like ""Let's be friends!"" and ""I like your planet!"". Unorthodox, maybe, but I figured a little whimsy and fun couldn't hurt.

If someone had told me even a year ago that I'd be actively plotting to subvert the United Nations, I would have laughed at them. I was a rule follower to the core, always had been - the quintessential good girl, valedictorian, the one who turned in her homework early and never missed a day of class.

But something about the arrival of the venlil, had ignited a yearning to reach out and speak with our new neighbors.

As my students worked, I paced between their desks, my heart hammering with a mixture of professional pride and trepidation. The United Nations had established the Extra-Terrestrial Communications Protocol within days of first contact. Every interaction was carefully scripted, every image meticulously vetted. Messages of peace and cooperation, yes, but only through approved channels, approved representatives.

No unauthorized contact.

Period.

Secretary General Elias Meyer had said the aliens were too fearful and that we needed to be very cautious about what we revealed, that it was a matter of planetary security.

But as I watched my kids pour their pure, untarnished visions of Earth onto paper, I couldn't help but feel like the UN's approach was wrong. The venlil didn't need a sanitized, PR-friendly Earth. They needed the real deal--clumsy crayon drawings, lopsided smiles, and all. A lie of omission was still a lie.

The aliens are just scared, I told myself. And for good reason but open and honest communication is the only way to build lasting trust. The self censorship and red tape surrounding the venlil, could only breed more fear and suspicion in the long run.

Children had no ulterior motives, no agendas; they were capable of a pure, radiant openness that most adults could scarcely remember. If anything could show the venlil and the Federation that we weren‚Äôt like those vile lizards, I was certain it would be the guileless warmth of a child's smile.

I paused by Olivia's desk, admiring the neat row of buttery sunflowers she'd sketched. Their lemon-yellow petals stretched toward a bright blue sky, the colors as bold and cheerful as the little artist herself.

Abby waved me over to look at her drawing of the school. She'd included the sprawling playground, complete with monkey bars, and the gnarled oak tree where the kids always gathered for games of tag. It was a child's-eye view, the building towering and the tree impossibly tall.

Some of the drawings surprised me with their whimsy and imagination. I paused by Maria's desk. She was adding spots to a creature that looked like a cross between a rabbit and a butterfly.

""What's this?"" I asked, bending down for a closer look.

""It's an Earthling,"" she said matter-of-factly. ""I thought maybe they would like us better if we had something in common.""

I bit back a smile, marveling at the simple wisdom of a child's mind.

""I love it,"" I said honestly. ""Maybe you can write a little story about the Earthling on the back of your picture, so they know all about it.""

Her eyes lit up at the suggestion and she flipped over the paper to begin scribbling furiously in purple marker.

Other students began adding their own messages without prompting, small notes of introduction and goodwill squeezed into the corners of each colorful page.

""Ms. Riviera?"" It was Zoe again, her hand raised, expression curious. ""Will the venlil kids write back to us? Since we're sending them pictures?""

The room fell quiet, and I felt the weight of twenty-three stares. I chose my words carefully, keeping my tone light. ""Well, the venlil don't know very much about us yet,"" I explained. ""A lot of them are probably nervous, just like you might be nervous about meeting someone from a new place. But that's why we're doing this - to show them that humans are friendly. That we want to learn about them, just like they might want to learn about us.""

""But we're not scary,"" Tyler said, sounding perplexed. ""How come they're scared of us?""

""I know we're not,"" I said, crouching down beside her desk to meet her at eye level. ""And maybe if they see these pictures, they'll understand that a little better.""

""My mom says they're afraid of us because we eat meat,"" Liam offered sensibly. ""She said they think we're going to eat them.""

I suppressed a wince. Children and their devastating honesty.

""They're not scared of you,"" I said gently. How to explain decades of cultural conditioning, generations raised to see humanity as the bogeyman? ""They just don't understand us very well yet. But that's going to change, and these drawings are the start of that. You're ambassadors, in a way. You're representing the very best of Earth.""

That seemed to satisfy them, and as the clocked ticked on, I watched with quiet wonder as the drawings came to life in vivid color and exuberant detail. Even the venlil sketches gained tiny messages in the margins - ""Hi, I'm Ava, I like your fur!"" and ""Let's be pen pals!""

Collecting the finished artwork at the end of class, I flipped through the pages, my throat tightening at the riot of color and unabashed emotion pouring from each one.

The venlil might be afraid of us now, might think all we were capable of was war and destruction...but they had clearly never seen humanity through the eyes of a child. If anything could change their minds, could plant the seeds of connection, surely it would be this - this vibrant, untarnished, infinitely precious piece of who we were.

Carefully, almost reverently, I slid the pages into a folder, hardly daring to imagine the ripples they might cause on the other end of their journey. There was still so much standing in the way, so many obstacles to overcome...but as I tucked the precious cargo under my arm and stepped out into the honey-gold afternoon, I felt lighter than I had in months.

Memory transcription subject: Daniella Ortiz Riviera, Smuggler, Artivist, and Porcelain Idealist

Date \[standardized human time\]: September 2, 2136

I pushed open the glass door of Manny's Diner, a bell chiming above my head to announce my arrival. The late afternoon light filtered through venetian blinds, casting alternating stripes of shadow and gold across the black and white checkered floor. The place was a meticulous recreation of a 1950s American diner, complete with red vinyl booths, chrome accents, and a jukebox humming in the corner.

I adjusted the cardboard box in my arms. The box wasn't particularly heavy, but its contents felt momentous. Inside lay a myriad of art supplies; tools of expression that we took for granted on Earth. Nestled between these treasures was a folder containing my students' artwork--explosions of color depicting their imaginings of alien worlds and furry venlil children. My students had worked diligently on these drawings, asking endless questions about the ""sheep-rabbit aliens"" they'd seen on the news. Their uninhibited creativity made my heart swell with pride.

I scanned the diner until I spotted him, my uncle Carlos, sitting in his usual booth by the window, halfway through what I knew would be his second cup of coffee. The ceramic mug looked miniature in his calloused hands. His attention was fixed on his tablet, his brow furrowed in concentration as he scrolled through what were likely cargo manifests or route calculations.

A half-eaten sandwich sat forgotten on his plate, evidence of his habit of becoming absorbed in his work. The overhead lights reflected off his salt-and-pepper hair, which he'd recently trimmed for this upcoming voyage, his first to the alien planet.

This was his ritual, as predictable as the tides. Every time Uncle Carlos prepared for a run to the distant reaches of human-explored space, he came to Manny's Diner during the hours his ship was being loaded. He claimed Manny's coffee was the last decent cup he'd have before the voyage, though I suspected it was more about the comfort of something familiar before facing the void. For a man who traveled the void without a set schedule, he was remarkably attached to his routines.

I walked past the tables, nodding at the waitress who gave me a quizzical look. Uncle Carlos remained oblivious to my approach, his back to the door, shoulders hunched slightly over his tablet.

I could see the screen reflected in the window--shipping routes and cargo calculations, just as I'd thought. The familiar sight made me smile, my uncle, the interstellar freighter.

With my free hand, I smoothed down my braid, suddenly nervous about the favor I was about to ask. It was technically illegal, but if I stretched things a bit, I could maybe convince him that it wasn't. I took a deep breath, reminding myself that this was for the children--human and venlil alike.

I slid into the booth across from him without announcing myself, placing my cardboard box on the vinyl seat beside me with deliberate gentleness. ""I heard there's a ship leaving for Venlil Prime tomorrow,"" I said casually. ""Know anything about that?""

Carlos startled violently, a piece of sandwich lodging in his throat as he inhaled in surprise. His eyes widened, tablet clattering to the table as he reached for his coffee, taking a desperate gulp to clear his airway. I winced, instantly regretting my dramatic entrance as he coughed and spluttered.

""Dios m√≠o, Dani!"" he finally managed, voice rough. ""Are you trying to kill me before I even leave Earth's atmosphere?"" Despite his words, a smile spread across his face, crinkling the corners of his eyes.

""Sorry,"" I said, not feeling particularly sorry at all. I pushed a napkin toward him.""I thought space travelers were supposed to be alert to their surroundings.""

""Space travelers aren't usually ambushed by their sneaky nieces,"" he retorted, composure regained. He set his mug down and leaned back, studying me with affectionate suspicion. ""What brings you here, mija? I thought you were at St. Mary‚Äôs on Thursdays.""

""I wanted to see you off."" I smiled innocently. ""Can't an adoring niece bid farewell to her favorite uncle before he journeys to alien worlds?""

""I'm your favorite uncle now?‚Äù His eyebrow arched skeptically. ‚ÄúYou've never come to see me off before.""

His gaze drifted to the cardboard box beside me, curiosity evident in the slight tilt of his head. ""What's in the box, Dani?""

I followed his gaze, trying to appear nonchalant. ""Just a little project I've been working on. Something that might... need to hitch a ride to Venlil Prime.""

Carlos's expression shifted from curiosity to wariness, the lines around his mouth deepening. ""Dani,"" he said, his voice dropping to a cautious murmur, ""what exactly are you asking me to do?""

I leaned forward, hands flat on the table, my enthusiasm impossible to contain despite my attempts at casualness.

""Something wonderful,"" I whispered, ""something important."" I tapped the box with my fingertips. ""Something that could change how an entire generation of venlil children see humans.""

Carlos's eyes narrowed, but I could see the spark of interest beneath his caution. He glanced around the diner, then back at me, before nodding almost imperceptibly.

""Let me hear it, then,"" he said, pushing his plate aside and folding his arms on the table. ""What's my favorite niece gotten herself into this time?""

""I want to ask you for a favor,"" I said, sliding the cardboard box closer to the center of the table.

I unfolded the flaps with careful precision, revealing the treasure trove of art supplies nestled inside. The fluorescent diner lights caught on metallic paint tubes and glossy marker casings.

""I need you to take this to Venlil Prime, as part of your cargo.""

Carlos leaned forward, his coffee forgotten as he peered into the box. His weathered fingers hovered over the contents--packets of vibrant crayons, sets of colored pencils arranged by hue, markers in every imaginable shade, watercolor palettes, and several types of brushes, all neatly organized and secured for transport.

""Art supplies?"" he questioned, confusion evident in the furrow of his brow.

""Not just art supplies,"" I explained, my voice gaining momentum as I warmed to my subject. ""Opportunity. Expression. A chance for cultural exchange at the most fundamental level.""

I removed a set of oil pastels from the box, turning the package in my hands. ""Do you know how much these cost on Venlil Prime? The equivalent of a day‚Äôs wages for the average worker. Art there is a luxury reserved for the elite.""

I set the pastels down and extracted a pack of modeling clay, its earthy scent escaping as I briefly opened the sealed container. ""The people in the Human-Venlil Exchange Program have been sending reports back. Art supplies are prohibitively expensive there. Their manufacturers prioritize necessities, and creative materials are considered superfluous, especially after generations of living in fear of the arxur.""

My voice hardened with disapproval. ""Only the wealthy can afford to make art or express themselves creatively. The children of ordinary workers--they're being denied something that is a fundamental right. Self-expression shouldn't be a privilege.""

Carlos raised an eyebrow, clearly catching the passion in my tone.

""This box,"" I continued, gesturing to encompass its contents, ""costs maybe a couple hundred dollars here on Earth. But on Venlil Prime? It's worth a small fortune. Think about that, Carlos. A fortune, just to let children draw their dreams or sculpt their imaginations.""

My uncle sighed, running a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair. ""Dani, mija, I understand what you're trying to do, but the UN is incredibly strict about communications with the venlil. We're talking about serious consequences if I'm caught circumventing official channels.""

His eyes, so like my mother's, reflected genuine concern. ""Unauthorized packages, unsanctioned cultural exchange... there are protocols in place for a reason. The venlil are still skittish around us. One wrong move could set back relations significantly.""

I had anticipated this response. Carlos was not a man who took risks lightly, especially when they could affect his livelihood or safety.

""I knew you'd say that,"" I replied, reaching into my messenger bag. ""So I did my homework."" I extracted a folder containing several printed pages, sticky notes protruding from the edges. ""I've examined Order 56 thoroughly. As long as there are no attempts at correspondence from me to the venlil, this box doesn't violate any regulations.""

I flipped open the folder, pointing to a highlighted paragraph. ""Furthermore, the UN has a specific provision within Order 56 that actually encourages humans in the Exchange Program to share aspects of human culture with the venlil, provided it doesn't violate the other provisions regarding security, dietary restrictions, or direct political messaging.""

Carlos frowned, tapping the page with his index finger. ""But you're not in the Exchange Program, Dani. That's the critical point here.""

I smiled, having prepared for this exact argument. ""Technically, I am. My application hasn't been rejected for cause, so I was never ‚Äòkicked out.‚Äô It was only deferred due to 'cultural sensitivity concerns'--their diplomatic way of saying the venlil aren't ready for someone who eats chicken mole.""

I flipped to another page, where I'd highlighted another section in neon yellow. ""My application is essentially in a holding pattern until the venlil become more accustomed to human faces. It's just a waiting game now, not a rejection. The appeals committee even suggested I reapply in six months.""

That was a bald faced lie, I had been rejected. Eating meat was cause according to the UN but they said that might change in the future.

Carlos still looked skeptical, his eyes narrowing as he scanned the documents. ""Even if that's true, there are channels for this sort of thing. The UN has procedures--""

""Which I've followed,"" I interjected, pulling out another document. ""I've gone through the proper UN channels to approve these supplies.""

I handed him a form with an official-looking stamp. ""They were happy to green-light the idea, but then told me I'd need to wait until official shipping space opened up.""

I leaned forward, lowering my voice despite the nearly empty diner. ""The backlog is two years, Uncle Carlos. Two years. The children I want to reach will have graduated to higher education by then. This isn't some rogue operation--it's an approved cultural exchange program caught in bureaucratic limbo.""

Even as I was trying to convince my uncle to help me I hated that I was lying to him. The UN had given my idea only preliminary approval to be evaluated further at a later date.

I handed him the folder--my meticulously prepared legal defense, complete with an annotated printout of Order 56, each relevant section highlighted and cross-referenced with notes in the margins. Post-it notes marked key passages, and I'd included a flowchart demonstrating how my plan complied with every subsection of the regulations.

""I've cross-referenced every applicable regulation,"" I said, unable to keep a note of guilt from my voice. ""This is above board, just... expedited. The UN approves of what, but they're dragging their feet on when and how. I'm just asking you to bridge that gap.""

Carlos took the folder, thumbing through the pages with a mixture of amusement and resignation. His eyes flicked between the documents and my face, clearly reassessing both the situation and my determination.

Carlos looked up from the folder and laughed, the sound warm and familiar in the quiet diner. ""When did you become a lawyer, mija? You've got enough legal documentation here to argue before the International Criminal Court."" His eyes crinkled at the corners, but I could see the genuine impression behind his teasing. I hadn't left him much room to refuse.

I leaned forward, resting my elbows on the table, my voice dropping to an earnest whisper. ""Every child deserves the chance to make art, Carlos. Every single one.""

The passion I usually reserved for my classroom slipped into my tone. ""I've seen what happens when children discover colors and shapes and textures for the first time. I've watched them find their voices through art when words fail them.""

My fingers traced the edge of the box. ""The venlil children shouldn't have to wait for the UN bureaucracy to catch up with basic human decency. Art isn't a luxury--it's a fundamental mode of expression, of processing the world.""

I met his eyes directly. ""Would you want your children to wait two years for something that could change their lives today?""

Carlos raised an eyebrow, his coffee mug paused halfway to his lips. ""You make it sound like I'm denying medicine to the sick. Explain exactly what happened with the UN approval process.""

I sighed, tucking a loose strand of hair behind my ear. ""I submitted the proposal three days ago. The Cultural Exchange Committee was enthusiastic--they even called it 'an exemplary initiative for fostering cross-species understanding through creative expression.'""

I quoted their exact words, which I'd memorized after reading the preliminary approval letter dozens of times.

""But then,"" I continued, frustration coloring my voice, ""they said all approved cultural materials must go through official shipping channels. When I inquired about the timeline, they told me there's a two-year backlog for non-essential, non-governmental packages to Venlil Prime."" I spread my hands in exasperation. ""Two years, Carlos. The children will have moved on to advanced education by then. The opportunity will be lost.""

Carlos winced, setting down his mug. He understood the pain of bureaucratic inefficiency all too well; I'd heard enough stories about shipping delays and customs complications over family dinners.

""What exactly do you expect me to do, Dani?"" he asked, though his tone had softened. ""I'm just a cargo hauler. I don't make the rules.""

""You don't have to make them--just help me work around them,"" I replied, sensing his resistance weakening. ""Do you have any spare cargo space? Any weight allowance that isn't being used? The supplies aren't heavy, and they don't take up much room.""

I gestured toward the window, and the darkening sky beoynd.

""The school I've chosen is in the industrial district near the shipyard on Venlil Prime. It's an underprivileged school that primarily serves the children of dock workers, maintenance staff, and other blue-collar venlil. They‚Äôre kids who would never normally have access to art supplies.""

My research had been minimal. I'd only spent the last few hours combing through the public data dump about venlil educational institutions and the exchange partner updates, looking for a school I could send the supplies to. Dayside City Primary School no. 6 was the fourth one on the list and closest to the space port.

""Their educational focus is primarily technical--preparing students for the same jobs their parents have and no more. There's no arts program at all. Can you imagine a childhood without a single crayon?""

Carlos rubbed the back of his neck, a familiar gesture that told me he was weighing options and risks.

""I'm not surprised the UN is making this difficult,"" he muttered. ""They're so terrified of offending the venlil that they've created a bureaucratic nightmare for everyone.""

He drummed his fingers on the table, considering. ""Even if I had the space--and I'm not saying I do--I'd be risking a lot. Cargo manifests are checked, Dani. There are inspections.""

""But there are also ways to classify items that don't draw attention,"" I countered. ""These could be listed as 'cultural exchange materials' or 'educational supplies'--both of which are technically true.""

Carlos' resistance was crumbling; I could see it in the softening around his eyes. ""Dani, you watch too much TV.""

He paused mulling everything over in his head, ""What exactly did you decide to get them anyway?""

The question ignited my enthusiasm, and I couldn't help the smile that spread across my face.

""I couldn't decide, so I got a little of everything,"" I admitted, beginning to pull items from the box with the jubilation of a child opening presents at Christmas. Uncle Carlos laughed at my excitement.

""Crayons, of course--the full spectrum, not just the basic colors. Colored pencils, this brand blends together beautifully. Markers in both fine and broad tips,"" I said, arranging them on the table.

""Watercolors with proper paintbrushes--not those awful plastic ones that shed bristles after one use.""

My hands moved quickly, displaying more treasures. ""Pens in different colors and thicknesses. Sidewalk chalk for outdoor expression. A block of air-dry clay that doesn't need a kiln.""

The excitement in my voice grew with each item. ""And accessories--sharpeners, erasers, blending stumps, palette knives, paper in different weights and textures. And mixed bags of Googly Eyes because no project is complete without them.""

I carefully arranged a representative sample across our table, transforming the mundane diner surface into a vibrant display of color. ""I wanted them to experience everything, to discover which mediums speak to them personally. Some children connect with the precision of pencils, others with the bold strokes of markers, or the fluid unpredictability of watercolors.""

As I spoke, my hands moved among the supplies with the practiced grace of someone who had spent countless hours teaching children how to use them.

""Each of these tools unlocks a different way of seeing and expressing the world. I couldn't bear the thought of limiting their discovery.""

Carlos watched me with a mixture of amusement and affection, his eyes taking in both the supplies and the animation in my face. I knew that look--it was the same one he'd worn whenever I came up with a hair brained scheme, like repainting the Sistine Chapel when I was 9 or when I wanted to find Big Foot. A look that said I was crazy but he would support me all the same.

Carlos laughed at my animated display, his deep chuckle reverberating across the table. ""You've always been like this about art, ever since you were little,"" he said, shaking his head.

""Remember when you used every surface in your parents' house as a canvas? Your poor mother nearly had a stroke when she saw the hallway mural.""

He reached across the table and carefully began returning the supplies to the box, his rough hands surprisingly gentle with the delicate items.

After another moment of consideration, he nodded. ""Alright, mija. I'll take your box to Venlil Prime.""

Relief and joy coursed through me like an electric current. I had prepared arguments for every possible objection, had been ready to negotiate and plead, but in the end, it was that simple--the familial bond between us proving stronger than bureaucratic concerns.

""Thank you,"" I breathed, reaching across to squeeze his weathered hand.

""This means more than you know, not just to me but to those children."" My voice caught slightly, emotion threatening to overwhelm my carefully constructed composure.

Carlos smiled, the corners of his eyes crinkling with affection. ""I think I have some idea, given how passionate you are about it."" He closed the box and pushed it toward me. ""I'll take it with me when I leave in a couple hours.""

I bit my lower lip, hesitating for just a moment before confessing, ""Actually, there are two more identical boxes in my car.""

His eyebrows shot up.""Two more? Daniella, how much did you spend on this project of yours?""

Heat rushed to my cheeks, and I busied myself tearing apart a napkin. ""It's not important,"" I murmured, avoiding his gaze.

""It's a little important."" His tone wasn‚Äôt quite disapproving but I still felt like a little kid again who got caught in a lie.

""No, what's important is making sure each child gets to try every medium."" The napkin pieces formed a small pile on the table as I spoke.

""Do you know how crucial it is for children to experiment with different forms of expression? Some kids connect with the precision of colored pencils, others need the bold strokes of markers. Some find their voice in three dimensions with clay. If I only sent one box, they'd have to share everything, and there might not be enough--""

""Dani."" His voice was gentle, stopping my ramble. ""How much?""

I could feel the blush creeping up my cheeks. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it. I used my tax return. And some of it was donated.‚Äù

I thought of my classroom, where each student had their own set of supplies, the delight on their faces when they opened fresh boxes of crayons or uncapped new markers, that moment of possibility before creativity flowed.

""Their first experience with art should be generous, abundant. It should feel like endless possibilities, not scarcity.""

Carlos shook his head, but his expression was soft with admiration. ""You have a huge heart, Dani. Always have.""

He reached across the table to tuck a loose strand of hair behind my ear, a gesture he'd been making since I was small. ""You're a good person for doing this. Not everyone would go to such lengths for children they've never met, especially not alien children.""

I smiled, grateful for his understanding, then reached into my pocket and extracted a small envelope.

""One more thing,"" I said, sliding it across the table. ""Could you possibly pick up some pens, markers, or regular pencils while you're on Venlil Prime? I'd love to make some art with alien supplies.""

My fingers tapped the envelope. ""There's money for both the shipping costs and souvenirs. I want to see how their materials differ from ours--what pigments they use, how their writing implements feel.""

My eyes brightened with genuine curiosity. ""Do they even have erasers? Do their markers smell different? Is their paper made from the same materials?""

Carlos laughed again, tucking the envelope into his shirt pocket. ""Trust you to turn this into a two-way cultural exchange. I promise I'll get you something--assuming the venlil don't faint at the sight of me in their stationery store.""

""They might,"" I acknowledged, recalling the footage I'd seen of venlil reactions to humans. ""But you're the least threatening human I know, Uncle Carlos. Just smile less and try not to make eye contact.""

We settled the bill--Carlos insisted on buying me a meal despite my protests--and walked together to the parking lot. The evening air was cool against my skin, the distant rumble of spacecraft taking off providing a continuous backdrop to our conversation. I popped my trunk to reveal two more carefully packed boxes, identical to the first.

Carlos whistled low.""You weren't kidding about going all out."" He lifted the boxes with practiced ease, years of loading cargo evident in his efficient movements. I followed him to his beat up old truck, watching as he arranged the boxes in the bed of his truck, securing them with bungee cords so they wouldn't shift during transit.

When he closed the tail gate, I stepped forward and wrapped my arms around his solid frame, breathing in the familiar scent of coffee and the faint trace of engine oil and coolant that seemed permanently embedded in his clothes.

""Thank you,"" I whispered against his shoulder. ""Be safe out there."" I reached up to kiss his cheek, feeling the scratch of his stubble against my lips.

""Always am,"" he replied, returning the embrace with equal warmth. ""I'll call when I get back. And Dani?""

He pulled back, his expression serious. ""Don't get your hopes too high about this. The boxes might get confiscated, or the school might not use them, or--""

""I know,"" I interrupted gently. ""It's a shot in the dark. But this shot is worth taking.""

As I slid into my own car minutes later, excitement thrummed in my chest like a second heartbeat. I gripped the steering wheel, watching Carlos' taillights disappear around the corner toward the spaceport. Maybe nothing would come of this. Maybe the drawings would be ignored, or worse, destroyed. The art supplies might never reach their intended recipients, lost in the vastness of space or the complexity of alien bureaucracy.

But maybe--just maybe--God would answer my prayers and something beautiful would emerge from this gesture. Perhaps I would actually get to talk to a venlil someday, to bridge the gap between our species through the universal language of art. The possibility, however remote, was worth every penny I'd spent and every regulation I'd just broken.

He worked as an accountant at the local paper company, staring at spreadsheets all day while his coworkers sipped on overpriced coffee and discussed their weekends. Barry's life was a never-ending cycle of monotony, and he felt like a cog in a machine that was slowly sucking the joy out of him.

One fateful day, Barry received a mysterious letter in the mail addressed to him, but with no return address or indication of who might have sent it. The letter contained a single sentence: ""The answer to your life's purpose lies in the ancient art of Extreme Ironing."" Confused and intrigued, Barry spent the rest of the day researching Extreme Ironing, a supposedly extinct sport that involved ironing clothes while engaging in extreme sports like skydiving or bungee jumping.

As he delved deeper into the world of Extreme Ironing, Barry became increasingly obsessed with the idea of mastering this ancient art. He spent hours poring over dusty old books and watching YouTube tutorials on how to iron a shirt while standing on one leg. His coworkers began to notice his newfound fixation and started calling him ""Ironing Man.""

Barry's obsession eventually led him to create his own Extreme Ironing club, where he and his fellow enthusiasts would gather once a month to iron clothes while engaging in extreme stunts. They called themselves the ""Sole Survivors,"" and their motto was ""Smooth creases, razor-sharp edges."" The club quickly gained notoriety in Snoodlebury, with people coming from all over to witness the absurd spectacle of men ironing clothes while jumping off a cliff or riding a unicycle.

As Barry's reputation grew, so did his ego. He began to see himself as the greatest Extreme Ironer of all time, and started to make outrageous claims about his skills. He claimed that he could iron a shirt on the surface of the moon, and even went so far as to create a fake lunar expedition team to support his outlandish claims.

But Barry's success was short-lived. A rival Extreme Ironing enthusiast named Steve emerged, who claimed to be the true master of the sport. Steve was a mysterious figure with a shaggy beard and a penchant for leather jackets, and he challenged Barry to an epic ironing battle at the annual Snoodlebury fair.

The day of the battle arrived, and the fairgrounds were packed with excited onlookers. Barry and Steve faced off in the center of the ring, each with their trusty ironing board and a mountain of wrinkled clothes. The crowd held its collective breath as the two Extreme Ironers began to iron, their movements swift and precise as they battled for supremacy.

But just as it seemed that Barry was gaining the upper hand, Steve pulled out a shocking trump card: a giant steam-powered iron that shot flames 20 feet into the air. The crowd gasped in awe as Barry's eyes widened in shock, realizing too late that he had underestimated his rival.

In the end, Steve emerged victorious, and Barry slunk away in defeat, his ego bruised and his reputation in tatters. But even in defeat, Barry found a glimmer of hope: he realized that maybe, just maybe, there was more to life than Extreme Ironing. Maybe it was time for him to explore new passions and interests, to find something that brought him joy and fulfillment.

And so, with a newfound sense of purpose, Barry began to explore the world of... wait, what was I saying?",1,1754690810.0,bullshitforaitestingi,0,1.0,False

You want to know why I‚Äôve gone no contact. Why it feels cold. Why it looks like betrayal. It‚Äôs not because I stopped caring. And it‚Äôs not to punish you. I left because this situation broke me. I could not spend another day in what amounted to non-consensual, unethical non-monogamy with asymmetrical expectations around intimacy and fidelity.

You stated clearly from the start no poly, no sharing, one partner at a time. That was your hard line. Mine too. One of the founding agreements of the relationship.

In March, we got serious. I forced my family out a year early because you were getting jealous. I stopped sleeping in the same bed as my then STBX and turned my basement into a separate living space. I was upfront with everyone. Not because I owed it to her, but because I wanted a clean slate. I was building a bridge assuming you‚Äôd meet me halfway. You said you would. After graduation. After May 31st. That was the plan.

Then came the delays. Therapy. More time. Six months. Then back to two. I offered everything. My home. My time. My money. I offered to move, take any job, let you ease in however you needed. You canceled a visit as I was walking out the door. Refused to reschedule. Wouldn‚Äôt even discuss it. Every time I tried to clarify or set a boundary, you dodged it, changed the subject, or made it about my reaction.

The mental health crisis didn‚Äôt come out of nowhere. I told you up front I‚Äôm a twice deployed combat vet, early 40s, ACE score of 8, MDD, past self harm, abandonment trauma, just out of a marriage I learned had been a lie. I said clearly  need you to protect my heart. Treat it gently. Two months apart is the max I can handle. I told you I didn‚Äôt know how I was going to make it.

By then, I‚Äôd been living in near total isolation for a year. My house was a haunted space of loss. I told you that all the time. You accused me of being manipulative. I was begging. When it got worse, when I reached the edge, you ignored it. You kept sleeping beside your husband, turning your phone off nightly, knowing what it did to me. You told your combat vet boyfriend with a life expectancy of 46 you‚Äôre on your own, every night.

You scoffed at every attempt to mitigate the pain. It took four weeks of hell just to get you to admit it might be difficult for me. You kept repeating that you regulate long distance, why couldn‚Äôt I? When I broke down, you framed it as weakness. Then moral failure. Then made me apologize for being triggered by behavior you knew was triggering. You painted your husband as dangerous and made secrecy a necessity. I accepted that. I stayed silent. I defended you. And it turns out it was a lie. He‚Äôs harmless.

You said trauma made it hard to act. But you had capacity to lie about a concert. To post online like I was delusional. To moralize in public while I fell apart in private. That‚Äôs not trauma. That‚Äôs behavior.

You say I scared you when I got reactive. But your pattern was withhold, delay, gaslight, then call me unsafe when I reacted. You said it‚Äôs not reactive abuse if it's your trauma. But if you can‚Äôt keep us safe and don‚Äôt trust me to either, then someone has to drive. If you can‚Äôt co-pilot, get in the passenger seat. I‚Äôve always respected your limits. Never weaponized them. Never withheld love.

There are two moments I can‚Äôt come back from.

First, the danger narrative. It shaped everything. It justified your secrecy and delays. It won sympathy. And it was false. You weren‚Äôt trapped. You just weren‚Äôt ready.

Second, the concert lie. You went. You lied. When I found out, you gaslit me in the most unhinged way imaginable. I walked. For ten days, you posted all over Reddit about how to handle being falsely accused. I broke no contact to come back. You never checked on me. You acted only to make yourself feel better publicly. When I finally got the truth out of you, you reframed it as protecting me. Refused to apologize. That was manipulation. You knew it would devastate me. You did it anyway.

At this point, I can‚Äôt trust your self-reporting. Not after this. If we ever rebuild anything, it starts with external verification, co-authored safety plans, crisis roles, and the understanding that your reactivity doesn‚Äôt get to override our safety.

But we‚Äôre not there. And we may never be. The trauma symptoms are real. The relational instability is real. The physiological distress is real. The loneliness is real. I‚Äôm not lashing out. I‚Äôm telling you the truth because it‚Äôs the only way I could reach solid ground again. Hope was killing me. Constant hope was shredding me daily and you knew it.

I gave you a hard 30 day timeline. You dodged it. Then you revealed you were going to visit family and¬†*then*¬†move in. That made no sense. You refused to meet me in any neutral city. Rejected every offer I made. I showed you the data. I told you the toll. You said I was too much. Sent me a crisis line and an AI generated message that you loved me. Then left me on read for six hours. When you did reply, you were cold. Distant.

That night I unraveled. I sent a final message in caps I REALLY NEED YOU RIGHT NOW.

You left me on read.

I recorded a series of short goodbye videos. Tear streaked. Honest. Loving. You watched two. Then nothing. I unsent them. Blocked you everywhere but email. Our agreed emergency channel.

At first, all of this seemed plausible because of your framing‚Äîhe was dangerous, you were hiding for survival. But now I know better. The lies were conscious. Calculated. You protected the relationship you cared about. And gambled mine.

Then came the vacation. The concert. The excuses. The ‚Äúwe‚Äôll be together all day so I can‚Äôt talk much‚Äù trip. That broke something permanent in me.

I waited for you every day. Every car in my driveway, I checked‚Äîwas it you? After fights, I cleaned the house, prepped your coffee, stocked your favorites. You had no job. No kids. No pressing obligations. You were two hours away. You could have come anytime.

But you stayed. And every day you deepened your bond with the person you claimed not to love. While I was crammed into negative space.

You could have done what I did sleep in a separate room, stay up late talking to me, visit often, let me help. But you didn‚Äôt.

You yourself said ghosting and silence are unbearable. I‚Äôve lived with that feeling every day for six months.

Let me be clear I will not spend one more second being anything less than your top priority. I am not an unplugged boyfriend appliance. That‚Äôs not love.

Or maybe you just wanted a pet boyfriend. One that didn‚Äôt ask for things.

If there‚Äôs ever going to be a future, it starts with you admitting your limits. Trusting someone else to lead when you can‚Äôt. And taking responsibility for what you put me through.

And then maybe, just maybe, we finish this summer like two reckless teenagers. Legendary sex. Road trips. Skinny dipping. Not that we‚Äôd ever do such a thing.

I already ran away. It‚Äôs your turn to stop looking through the window at me starving across the street and meet me at the old abandoned library.

I've tried dewaxed shellac, oils, all sorts of poly, waxes & sealers, and they all darken or yellow the wood. The look I like best is from plain old beeswax.  It does a great job of providing a luster which follows you around the room (if you know what I mean).  But I understand that it's not the best protective finish.  The project is a living room coffee table.

The clearest protective finish I've found is Zar poly satin, which was awesome on a curly maple table I made for one of my daughters, but it doesn't do what I want on the spalted maple. 

  
I also tried tabletop epoxy, which is pretty amazing in creating a glossy surface that **greatly** enhances the contrast between the regular and spalted parts of the boards. It's gorgeous but highly reflective and not the look I want.  Here's a not-so-great photo of the 2 finishes, beeswax on the left & epoxy on the right.

Equipment is 078, TWW at 50%. About 207-210 water, grinding medium-fine at about 7.5. 

I did cupping because I wasn‚Äôt able to get anything out of these coffees (outside of Sey) when brewing. And cupping was no different. Most had very little aroma, no particular taste. Sey was incredible and Aviary was great as well. But all other coffees were completely bland. 
Interestingly, most did not even form a crust. I tried finer grind, boiling temp but not a whole lot of difference. 
I‚Äôve done cuppings at roasters and it was always really enjoyable coffees even few days after roast.

You say I scared you when I got reactive. But your pattern was withhold, delay, gaslight, then call me unsafe when I reacted. You said it‚Äôs not reactive abuse if it's your trauma. But if you can‚Äôt keep us safe and don‚Äôt trust me to either, then someone has to drive. If you can‚Äôt co-pilot, get in the passenger seat. I‚Äôve always respected your limits. Never weaponized them. Never withheld love.

There are two moments I can‚Äôt come back from.

First, the danger narrative. It shaped everything. It justified your secrecy and delays. It won sympathy. And it was false. You weren‚Äôt trapped. You just weren‚Äôt ready.

Second, the concert lie. You went. You lied. When I found out, you gaslit me in the most unhinged way imaginable. I walked. For ten days, you posted all over Reddit about how to handle being falsely accused. I broke no contact to come back. You never checked on me. You acted only to make yourself feel better publicly. When I finally got the truth out of you, you reframed it as protecting me. Refused to apologize. That was manipulation. You knew it would devastate me. You did it anyway.

At this point, I can‚Äôt trust your self-reporting. Not after this. If we ever rebuild anything, it starts with external verification, co-authored safety plans, crisis roles, and the understanding that your reactivity doesn‚Äôt get to override our safety.

But we‚Äôre not there. And we may never be. The trauma symptoms are real. The relational instability is real. The physiological distress is real. The loneliness is real. I‚Äôm not lashing out. I‚Äôm telling you the truth because it‚Äôs the only way I could reach solid ground again. Hope was killing me. Constant hope was shredding me daily and you knew it.

I gave you a hard 30 day timeline. You dodged it. Then you revealed you were going to visit family and¬†*then*¬†move in. That made no sense. You refused to meet me in any neutral city. Rejected every offer I made. I showed you the data. I told you the toll. You said I was too much. Sent me a crisis line and an AI generated message that you loved me. Then left me on read for six hours. When you did reply, you were cold. Distant.

That night I unraveled. I sent a final message in caps I REALLY NEED YOU RIGHT NOW.

You left me on read.

I recorded a series of short goodbye videos. Tear streaked. Honest. Loving. You watched two. Then nothing. I unsent them. Blocked you everywhere but email. Our agreed emergency channel.

At first, all of this seemed plausible because of your framing‚Äîhe was dangerous, you were hiding for survival. But now I know better. The lies were conscious. Calculated. You protected the relationship you cared about. And gambled mine.

Then came the vacation. The concert. The excuses. The ‚Äúwe‚Äôll be together all day so I can‚Äôt talk much‚Äù trip. That broke something permanent in me.

I waited for you every day. Every car in my driveway, I checked‚Äîwas it you? After fights, I cleaned the house, prepped your coffee, stocked your favorites. You had no job. No kids. No pressing obligations. You were two hours away. You could have come anytime.

But you stayed. And every day you deepened your bond with the person you claimed not to love. While I was crammed into negative space.

You could have done what I did sleep in a separate room, stay up late talking to me, visit often, let me help. But you didn‚Äôt.

You yourself said ghosting and silence are unbearable. I‚Äôve lived with that feeling every day for six months.

Let me be clear I will not spend one more second being anything less than your top priority. I am not an unplugged boyfriend appliance. That‚Äôs not love.

Or maybe you just wanted a pet boyfriend. One that didn‚Äôt ask for things.

If there‚Äôs ever going to be a future, it starts with you admitting your limits. Trusting someone else to lead when you can‚Äôt. And taking responsibility for what you put me through.

And then maybe, just maybe, we finish this summer like two reckless teenagers. Legendary sex. Road trips. Skinny dipping. Not that we‚Äôd ever do such a thing.

I already ran away. It‚Äôs your turn to stop looking through the window at me starving across the street and meet me at the old abandoned library.

If you make the coffee and appease the spirits, I‚Äôll fix the roof and keep watch at night.",1,1754690592.0,Letters_Unsent,0,1.0,False

Josh Moriarty is a detective living in a small town on the border between Arizona and Texas called Salvation Springs. He's been a detective for 40 years at this point but refuses to retire because ""the youngsters couldn't find a crime scene if it was outlined in glitter!"" - or so he says.

 Today, he woke up to a dark and cold appartment and to someone banging on his door. Upon a quick inspection oh his dead heater unit he came to the conclusion that the cause must be a blackout, the fact that it was still dark outside added further proof to his theory.

 As for whether the banging on his door was related to this - which would mean more work for his tired old bones - was another matter to investigate.

 Regardless he got dressed and went out with his usual scowl.

 Outside he met with his sidekick Simon Danes. A youngster fresh out of school who got assigned to him recently and who wasn't that reliable as a detective.

 As always with youth these days, Simon spewed words without care as soon as he saw him. Josh could swear he felt himself lose another year off his lifespan just listening to him.

 ""Good morning sir. There's a new case! A transformer was destroyed last night and Shelly, you remember her right? She works the night shift at the grocery store 3 blocks down from the transformer. Anyway she said she saw someone run away from the scene after power went out. The chief said you gotta see the scene. Brr... It's really cold today. Are you ready for a new day, sir? "" beamed his sidekick, Simon, as soon as he stepped out.

 He was tall, handsome, with black hair and blue eyed. He would be quite a good detective if he learned to focus on what's important.

 Josh went past him and got into the police car.

 ""Slow down son. I ain't as sharp as i used to be. Give me the basics and cut the useless stuff."" Josh said curtly as they sped to the crime scene.

 ""Right. Um... The chief said we gotta hurry to the scene. He had that scowl on when his coffee is cold and..."" Simon stopped himself when he noticed Josh glaring at him.

 He had looked up to the old man from the first case they worked together. In the 3 years since, he had always managed to run his mouth with useless stuff and angered his mentor. So for the rest of the drive he shut up and looked around outside.

 Snow had piled up overnight but not many had woken up to shovel it away. Most likely their allarm clocks did not ring due to the blackout.

‚Äî

 Salvation Springs was a small town and as is the case with small towns, news travel fast even without electricity. To Simon, gossiping housewives and journalists were much like wolves, they sniff out gossip and will treck through snow and cold for hours on foot for that jucy gossip. 

 By the time, the pair of detectives parked in the driveway and got out of the car, the crowd was already chatting the day away. 

 Suddenly a voice rose above the indistinct chatter which Simon recognized as Shelly's. ""I don' care what your crackpot theory is, Nancy, a bear didn't do this. I saw a guy with a sword or saw running past my shop after the lights went out. And unlike you, my eyes still work.""

 Shelly was a black woman with braided hair, wearing a jacket over the local store's uniform. The woman she was speaking to, Nancy, was a karen with one lazy eye which always looked to one side. Obviously the latter didn't see very well because of that.

""Hi Shelly, hello miss Nancy! Where's the chief?"" Asked Simon as he walked side by side with Josh through the light snow.

""He's in the back next to the blown up transformer wearing his ""i got cold coffee"" scowl. It's not my fault the power's out in the store. Speaking off which; when you get there take a gander at that transformer and tell me what the heck did that?""

""Thank you. I owe you one"" said Simon as he rushed to follow Josh who went ahead without him. ""Sir, wait up.""

‚Äî

Josh Moriarty had seen many unexplicable things in his life. But never before had he seen a 3 meter tall, steel plated trasnformer be cleaved in two and then somehow crushed like a beer can.

Witness Shelly was adamant she saw a tall figure with a weapon running past the establishment she worked at which even if true, didn't really align with the dmage before his eyes.

Either someone used heavy machinery to crush the transformer into the shape it currently is before ditching it and running away or they dropped from the sky with some havy duty tools to carry out the attack.

Both options were absurd.

""Sir? I found something curious."" A voice came from a corner near the fence. Again, Simon had found some useless thing he wanted to show him.

It was a small chunk of twisted metal, most likely from the crushed transformer. ""What did i tell you about evidence?"" Josh said as his scowl deepened even more. ""Keep searching for relevant clues not random junk. Put that thing away, get over here and look at the actual scene of the crime.""

Simon put the chunk in a plastic bag then in his pocket and joined his mentor mentally beating himself again for getting distracted yet again.

When he saw the transformer he only had one thought. ""It looks like something Wolverine from those old comics would do"". The damage looked unreal, as if whatever destroyed this transformer was super strong and had metal claws.

Brfore he could try to explain his thought to Josh however another police car, one from a neighboring city rolled up to the scene and from it two cops stepped out.

""Looks like you boys here have the same problem as us. Mind if you can give us a hand?""

At that Josh rubbed his eyebrows and heaved a heavy sigh. His 40 years of experiece informed him that this was going to be the worst case of his career.

Hello there everyone. This is a new story i am writing and this time it's a long one. It's about two detectives embroiled in a mysterious case that seems to keep getting bigger and more baffling every second.

I hope i managed to convey the characters and world well enough.

Be sure to point out any grammar mistakes and critique. Also if you have any questions about the world i can answer them without spoiling anything.

36 year old male, 6‚Äô4. Starting weight was 233lbs, currently 223lbs.  
Time started: 8/5 at 9pm
Current time: 8/8 at 4:30pm


I‚Äôve done some 24 hour fasts but this time I said ‚Äúf*** it‚Äù, let‚Äôs try the 48.  Getting over that 24 hour hump was tough but now I‚Äôm on hour 68 and I‚Äôve only consumed water, black coffee (some pure stevia), and la croix.  I‚Äôll probably break it tonight at dinner with a small meal. 

As a first timer, here are some things that really helped me:

- Water‚Ä¶drink water.  Room temp water helped more. I constantly had water with me and whenever I had the urge to eat, I just drank water.  I also essentially replaced my lunch/dinners with a la croix.  

- Planning it on days I know I‚Äôm not going out so not to be tempted.

- I was never a fan of black coffee, so I made it a little ‚Äúweaker‚Äù to reduce that taste and it helped.

- Going to sleep early.  Simple, the more you sleep, the less you‚Äôll want to eat ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. I was in bed right after the kids at 9pm (was also a little fatigued by not eating)

- Brushing my teeth. I know this should be done regardless, but brushing in the morning and evening helped reduce cravings.

- Stay busy.  Walking helped a lot. Video games too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

- the first 24 hours kind of suck.  Day 2 I felt better.  Still a little fatigued, but wasn‚Äôt bad. Day 3 has been by far the easiest

Part 1 ---

I‚Äôm sure that the name Body Farm makes you think I‚Äôm going to talk about a lot of dead bodies, but that‚Äôs not what you‚Äôre going to read, assuming you read the whole thing. There is only one death you‚Äôll find in this story, and I want you to know that it meant a lot more to me than it ever will for you. My experience over those three months wasn't meant to be anything more than a temporary job, and by no means was it meant to be fun. While it troubled me what was going on, in my own memory (maybe it‚Äôs my retrospectivity that makes me think this way), I can‚Äôt imagine a life without carrying this experience with me.¬†

I don‚Äôt write this for any reason except for my own sake. I just want to catalog it for myself so that I don‚Äôt have to think about it so much anymore. It doesn‚Äôt matter what you think of it, if you label it ‚Äúfiction‚Äù or not, it means nothing to me what you think of it. This is for me.¬†

I don‚Äôt want to bore you with unnecessary details and tangents, so I‚Äôll just start from the why. A few years ago, I was between jobs. I wasn‚Äôt broke, I just don‚Äôt like when no money was being made, it always made me financially insecure when a month goes by without income. Otherwise, I was alright.¬†

There was an ad on a local website (I‚Äôd rather not share the site name for the sake of anyone who may try to find it). I‚Äôve seen it before and I‚Äôve seen it since. It‚Äôs one of those banners on the side of the site‚Äôs actual content. I only ever saw it every few months or so, which makes me think that they wanted to stay relatively quiet and small in terms of hiring. Obviously, contract jobs offered through clickable banners were never going to be popular in the first place, and I couldn‚Äôt tell you if the ad was being displayed on other sites because I never saw them

elsewhere. I opened it, already thinking it was kind of stupid to consider a banner ad job, but I was curious to take a look.¬†

I‚Äôll spare you any description of the site, except to say that it wasn‚Äôt pleasant on the eyes. Instead, it was formatted to tell you simply that, by sending an email to the provided address, you may be reached out to for a three month or longer ‚Äúsanitation‚Äù job offer, off-site. Off-site of where or what company, it wasn‚Äôt clear. Because of how non-descriptive the offer was, and how a less-than-minimal amount of details were provided, I was curious enough to send an email (not from my own address of course) just to ask for more information.¬†

They must not check their inbox often because I didn‚Äôt get a reply for about a week. By this time, I was already sending emails and responding to other potential job offers, so I had to take a minute to remember what job the email was referring to. It seemed fairly harmless, and I think they may have actually believed that it was just a humble opportunity.¬†

Here‚Äôs what it said:¬†

*Hello, Elijah,*¬†

That‚Äôs my name.¬†

*We would be happy to share with you more information about the offer.*¬†

*This job is an off-site retreat for anybody to come for three months with a potential for extended workstay. The work includes deep sanitation of various surfaces, so masks will have to be worn at all times. You must:*¬†

*‚ûî Be willing to work with others;*¬†

*‚ûî Be precise in cleaning surfaces thoroughly;*¬†

I won‚Äôt list the rest of the given requirements.¬†

*This opportunity is not recommended for anyone who has been previously affected by harmful toxins as airborne bleaching particles may put the worker at risk. If you have any more questions, or would like to reach out to accept our offer, please email us at‚Äî*¬†

Again, I don‚Äôt want to share this information for your own sake. I plan to keep these things to myself.¬†

At this point in my unemployment, I wasn‚Äôt confident about any job offers I had been reaching out to. I, for the absolute heck of it, sent another email. You may be thinking something along the lines of, That sounds sketchy. Is this guy, perhaps, an idiot? That‚Äôs fair. I won‚Äôt argue with your assessment. With that being said, I won‚Äôt try to justify my actions either. I‚Äôll only say that I thought it was funny at the time. Yes, I said funny. To recap: side-banner ad, bare-bones webpage, vague job description, hilarious. I also thought it may possibly help me to relearn the interview process since it had been a few years. Again, not fantastic reasons, but I pursued the offer.

I got the second email faster this time. It was from this guy who didn‚Äôt seem like the business type, but I‚Äôm naturally led to believe he worked for the company. All his email said was when and where for an in-person interview. Local diner, dress casual. It also said that, if interested, I will be able to be shuttled directly to the jobsite after the interview. For whatever reason, probably the idea of making money very soon, I got kind of excited after reading the email.¬†

I might as well go, I had no reason not to.¬†

\*\*\*¬†

A few days later, I was sitting in a booth. I felt bad arriving slightly late, but better that the other guy arrived even later.¬†

This guy was nothing special. He wore casual, just like he promised. We ordered coffee and he leaned back. I was half expecting an at least somewhat disheveled man, but he was very ordinary all around. He was pretty relaxed, too.¬†

I couldn‚Äôt tell you the exact conversation from memory, but it went something like this:¬†

‚ÄúSanitation job?‚Äù He asked.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right.‚Äù¬†

We shook hands. After we got our coffee, he seemed like he wanted to just lay it all out for me.¬†

‚ÄúListen, this job, it‚Äî It‚Äôs great. Great pay, too.‚Äù¬†

That would be my third reason for responding to the emails. I wouldn‚Äôt say it paid a crazy amount, I mostly thought it was because the job took you away from

your life for three months, but it was enough money to make you curious. I nodded.¬†

‚ÄúIn all honesty, we‚Äôre willing to take on anyone who‚Äôs interested. But it‚Äôs my job to tell you what exactly you‚Äôd be doing there, so here it is. You‚Äôll mostly be in a facility‚Äî‚Äù He leaned closer to whisper, ‚ÄúWarehouse,‚Äù And resumed in his previous relaxed position. ‚ÄúEvery day, you‚Äôll wear these masks and these gloves, and you‚Äôll clean‚Äîehh‚Äîcertain things. That‚Äôs all, and you do it every day.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCertain things?‚Äù I asked. I may be an idiot, but I can at least pick up on roundabout phrasing.¬†

He stuttered before he thought of what to say next. He swirled his hand around in the air. ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs uh...‚Äù He gave me an interesting look like, Should I just tell him? ‚ÄúDo you get queasy?‚Äù¬†

I reeled back. ‚ÄúQueasy? Are we talking about dead bodies?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù He almost laughed. ‚ÄúListen, I did this same job myself last year, it was great‚ÄîLike I said.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThen what‚Äôs with it? Tell me.‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt demanding, I was only curious. We swirled his hand around again and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you really want to hear about it. If I told you, you might say no‚Äî‚Äù He held up his hands in defense. ‚ÄúBut hey, it is a great opportunity. I think you‚Äôd like it, I really do.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think I conveyed his sincerity on paper accurately, but I genuinely believed him. In retrospect, I know that everything he said was true. I told him that I‚Äôd think about it, he said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fair,‚Äù and we both went home. I didn‚Äôt think long about it. I‚Äôm sure you wouldn‚Äôt think that I told you all of this so far and then say I didn‚Äôt take the offer, because I did. I‚Äôm an idiot, right?

Glad we got that established. The only thing I checked was to email the guy about the whole ‚Äúqueasy‚Äù thing, just to make sure there wasn‚Äôt anything else. He didn‚Äôt respond with any details he didn‚Äôt already say, and he said that as long as I wasn‚Äôt easily disturbed, I should be fine. That must‚Äôve been enough for me because I told him I was in.¬†

\*\*\*¬†

I parked in this out-of-the-way parking space just out of town and stepped into his car. He said I could leave my car there while I was out on the job. We talked for a while during the trip, just general things, nothing outside of friendliness. He gave me a water bottle for the trip, I wasn‚Äôt really thirsty.¬†

At some point, I remember asking him what the company was called, since I only remembered then that I never got the name of it. He definitely told me some generic name like Sentry or Centra or something, but at this point, my memory got fuzzy. I don‚Äôt know what got to me because I don‚Äôt remember opening that water bottle, and I don‚Äôt think he gassed the car because he wasn‚Äôt wearing any mask, but I lost consciousness anyways.¬†

Idiot. Yeah, rule of threes, look who‚Äôs funny now.¬†

\*\*\*¬†

When I woke up again, I could hardly feel my body, but I could look around. I was laying back against something noticeably comfortable. Looking down, it was

a recliner. In front of me was a TV playing Toy Story. The rest of the room was generally white with a few bookshelves, tables, and not much else. Someone patted me on the shoulder. ‚ÄúMornin‚Äô,‚Äù He said, and he layed back in his own chair to keep watching.¬†

I turned my head under a sluggish haze to look at him. He seemed to be restraining a smile and avoiding looking back at me. After a few seconds of pretending I wasn‚Äôt there, he flicked his eyes to me and gestured to the screen. ‚ÄúWatch the movie, champ!‚Äù Even I could tell he was just messing with me by the way he couldn‚Äôt stop smiling. ‚ÄúYou want a cookie or somethin‚Äô?‚Äù He threw an energy bar in my lap and I didn‚Äôt think I had the strength in me to rip it open, but I picked it up to try.¬†

Fumbling around a little bit, it took me a moment just to get the right grip on it. I heard some whispers behind me but I hadn‚Äôt been focusing on them over the thought of this energy bar. I started pulling on the seal before it slipped out of my hand. I reached to try again. That second time I got a real good handle on it and the voices behind me riled up again. With more strength than I thought I had, the wrapper split open and the energy bar flew off my lap and nearly off of the chair. As soon as this happened, a bunch of voices shouted and rocked my chair back and forth in hurrah.¬†

‚ÄúHe did it!‚Äù They yelled and came around the chair so I could see them. Just a group of ordinary guys. I noticed then that we all wore the same jumpers. One by one they reached out to shake my half limp hand and congratulate me on my success. I, by this point, was starting to catch on to the game they were playing with me and I didn‚Äôt have to guess what was going on anymore.

‚ÄúFantastic opening execution on that bar! Say, what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù He held out a hand as if holding a microphone and all the guys went quiet and looked at me in anticipation.¬†

I hadn‚Äôt had enough time to recover from waking up so I said, ‚ÄúUh...‚Äù He shouted, ‚ÄúUh!‚Äù And they all jumped up and circled the recliner chanting, ‚ÄúUh! Uh! Uh!‚Äù¬†

They all had big smiles, and I think I did too.¬†

\*\*\*¬†

There were always about thirty guys working there, and I was one of them from then on. Turns out, everybody had already done their work that day and I had arrived while the sun was going down, so I wouldn‚Äôt have to think about it until the next day.¬†

Our living space consisted of only a few rooms. Bunked bedrooms, bathrooms, living rooms, all the essentials. Truthfully, it wasn‚Äôt so bad a place if you didn‚Äôt focus on the lack of any and all windows.¬†

I wasn‚Äôt awake for more than an hour before a short chime played on the overhead speakers. The guys tried to help me up, but I had enough strength back by then. We filed in through a wide doorway that only opened when it was meal time. I couldn‚Äôt tell you what we ate that specific night, but there were some things we had more often than others during dinner time. Green beans, cornbread, pre-packaged chicken sandwiches, and other things you may have eaten at a highschool lunch table. Whatever I ate that night, I was satisfied. The only thing I

know for sure that I had was one of those little chocolate milk boxes, I was happy about that. And they always had them out every night, assuming you weren‚Äôt last in line.¬†

Before I could even sit down with anybody, one of them shouted out over the rest, ‚ÄúHey, new guy! Tell us about yourself!‚Äù Everyone turned to me and I stood still, tray in hand, looking back at them. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù Another said. I told them and another asked me to say something interesting about myself. As anybody would, I proceeded to tell a few of the least interesting things about myself, my family, where I was born, and, if I were a few years younger, I would have told them all about my degree that I didn‚Äôt care much about. You know, all the things that make a person who they are.¬†

I sat down with a couple of guys after everybody started talking again and, for the most part, I wasn‚Äôt really talkative. It must have been the drug earlier that day that generally took it out of me. I didn‚Äôt even think about what was going on. I tried to listen to what some of them were saying that night, and they probably were saying interesting things, but not enough that I could remember any of it to write down here. Luckily, eating food didn‚Äôt require any mental effort, so I stuck to that.¬†

When we were back in the living rooms, we started playing board games. I think we played Uno. It was then that I asked what the actual work was that they did. I was so wrapped up in the other workers that I hadn‚Äôt bothered to think about what exactly made this ‚Äúsanitation‚Äù job so non-descriptive.

‚ÄúOh, yeah,‚Äù Said one guy, Ryan, without looking up at me, ‚ÄúBody parts.‚Äù He said it so casually, and the others around the table nodded their heads with agreeing grunts.¬†

I think I responded with, ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Hopefully in a tone that conveyed that what he said sounded unexpected.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think too much about it. It‚Äôs only weird for a few days. You‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù Ryan, an older man whose hairline could be found on the very top of his head, turned out to have been there for longer than three months by then, and wasn‚Äôt very interested in going back home any time soon. As I mentioned, the pay was pretty good, and Ryan along with a handful of others were taking advantage of the extended workstay.¬†

‚Äú‚ÄôCept for the girl, that usually takes a while longer to get used to.‚Äù The others nodded again. I looked up with a raised eyebrow, but he was busy looking at his own hand. It was only now that I realized that there were no women here, or maybe there were and they stayed in another section of the facility. ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a girl‚Äîhalf a girl. Just looks wrong is all.‚Äù Then he bothered himself to look up. ‚ÄúLike I said, you‚Äôll be fine.‚Äù¬†

The one on my right, Ian, spoke up. ‚ÄúLet us know if it ever freaks you out too much, we can help you out when you need it.‚Äù He went back to playing. I decided I should just wait for tomorrow to find out what was going on. Everyone else who had been here a while were already set in what was required, some staying for longer than the standard three months. I took Ryan‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be

fine,‚Äù At face value and went to bed when the time came. I think I slept at least a few hours.¬†

\*\*\*¬†

Someone shook me awake. There was no morning alarm from the speakers. Ryan whispered, ‚ÄúGet up, you‚Äôre in my group today. Early shift on your first day.‚Äù¬†

Tired, I slipped onto my feet. Ryan went to wake up a handful of others. Everyone else kept sleeping or rolled over to avoid Ryan‚Äôs flashlight. I followed them out through the living quarters and into another door that honestly could‚Äôve been mistaken for a linen closet. Ryan used a key from his pocket to unlock it and locked it again when we all came through. It was a short and narrow hallway with an enforced door at the end.¬†

When Ryan turned around, all of them went silent. I nearly got awkward and was about to speak up and ask what we were waiting for when a voice came over the speaker. ‚ÄúCleared.‚Äù The door clicked and the guy in the front led us through.¬†

Beyond the door was a locker room. I followed the group to the showers where we all had to shower behind curtains before and after work. Each locker had a number one through thirty-six on them. I slept on bed number twenty-one so that was my locker. We all put on these cream colored body suits that fit up to our necks with a loose band to hold them lightly against our skin. The glove bits were a strange flexible plastic material that stretched to fit over our hands but not let any

liquids through. Ryan threw a hairnet at me and told me that I‚Äôd get a haircut later that day, but I‚Äôd have to wear it for now.¬†

‚ÄúAnd grab one of those canisters over there.‚Äù Ryan extended his arm towards a row of red-lined canisters labeled E-9.¬†

With all these precautions, I was getting nervous.¬†

Finally, passing through the last door, we walked into a massive room several floors high and very wide. Ryan flipped the light switch. It really did look like a warehouse. And yet there were still no windows to be seen. Against the side walls, there were shelves of what looked like baskets, hundreds and hundreds of them. Each of them were generally no wider than two feet long, and a few columns stored larger baskets. Through my mask, there was a strong hint of bleach and other chemicals in the air. In the middle of the room were wide, empty metal tables with conveyors in the center. Those conveyors were connected to industrial machines that lifted a rider up to the baskets on the wall and allowed them to transport them down to the tables.¬†

On the floor in front of the shelves were lines of colored tape that separated different sections. Different groups took different sections of shelving. We took the first available on the right side of the warehouse. Ryan patted Ian on the back of the shoulder, signaling him to man the lift for the day. He hopped in the end of the arm and we all went to stand on either side of the connected table. Ryan motioned for me to come to his spot.¬†

‚ÄúMasks,‚Äù he called. Everyone who hadn‚Äôt had their masks up put them on. ‚ÄúElijah, yeah? That‚Äôs your name? I‚Äôll show you how it works.‚Äù In each person‚Äôs station was what looked like a handheld garden sprayer attached to a wide plastic

bucket. He took the red canister and poured a decent amount of the mixture into the bucket. The chemical was mostly clear with some subtle clouding in it. It gave off a strong odor of who-knows-what and some bleach. He picked up the sprayer and we watched as Ian sent down some baskets from the farthest column onto the conveyor. Each person picked up a basket as it came by them.¬†

Ryan picked out a basket and held it out for me.¬†

‚ÄúOh my gosh,‚Äù I muttered, not really understanding what I saw. It was a human hand starting from the wrist. It wasn‚Äôt attached to any arm, its skin just rounded out halfway up the forearm. There were things about it that didn‚Äôt quite look right. Its knuckles, palm, and fingertips. It was hard to pinpoint exactly what was wrong with them. The palm lines were scattered in an unnatural way, the fingertips only looked like approximations of what they should be. I wasn‚Äôt even sure about the knuckles, they just didn‚Äôt look right. Besides these, it still had blue and green veins and its bones looked in order as far as I could tell.¬†

The thumb retracted slightly in an unexpected movement and I jumped back.¬†

Ryan laughed and set the basket back down. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let it getcha. Watch.‚Äù He grabbed the nozzle and pulled on the handle. It gently sprayed the chemicals from the bucket in a vertical mist. He waved it back and forth to cover the hand a few times. Then he reached in and flipped it over onto its palm-side and stretched the fingers out. He sprayed the other side and flipped the hand over again. After that, he set the basket back on the conveyor.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all?‚Äù I asked.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right. Most of them don‚Äôt move much‚Ä¶ You alright?‚Äù

My nausea must have been visible. ‚ÄúI think I have to sit down.‚Äù I only took a few steps back and got down on my knees, sitting on my heels.¬†

*It was alive,* I thought to myself and breathed deeply.¬†

‚ÄúOoh, look at this one,‚Äù Ryan said, holding out another basket.¬†

I think I almost lurched at this one. It was a lower jaw with skin that reached down the neck a ways. Bare teeth that were far too smooth, neck flap that wasn‚Äôt thick enough to stay fixed in place. No tongue was present where it should be. Instead there were weird, shiny inner-mouth flesh-nodules. Whatever they were, they must have been trying desperately to look like something they clearly couldn‚Äôt.¬†

‚ÄúStill needs some more time in the oven,‚Äù he said, turning back around. He sprayed it, turned it over, sprayed again. He glanced back at me and took notice of the way my eyes looked, which probably reflected the way my stomach felt. ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you go sort out the baskets.‚Äù He gestured to the end of the conveyor belt where there was already congestion. ‚ÄúSo we can put them all back at the end of the day.‚Äù¬†

I sat there a few more moments. I looked around to the other guys, none of which seemed like they were having the same trouble I was having. I tried to stand up. Obviously, I was the new guy, and they probably didn‚Äôt expect me to do much that first day. This was my first rodeo, and it showed. I made my way to the end of the table. I looked at the collecting baskets pushing at each other like a coin dozer and thought about how I was going to spend my next three months. Probably not well.¬†

I remembered what the interviewer told me. If I told you, you might say no.

I guess I was given full warning.¬†

Hours of work later and I pulled the last basket of hundreds aside. By this time, the five other groups had filed in and taken their posts in the other sections of the warehouse to work. Someone turned on music and I wasn‚Äôt informed on how much Springsteen I would have to listen to for the next three months. All things considered, it wasn‚Äôt so bad.¬†

Ryan replaced Ian on the lift as I placed the last basket down next to the others. I leaned against the table for a rest when Ian put a hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúNow we put them all back.‚Äù¬†

\*\*\*¬†

After we finished, we went back to the showers. After seeing so many of those gross skin nodules, I couldn‚Äôt help but check all over my body just in case. I knew of course that there wouldn‚Äôt be any, but the way they looked creeped me out, I couldn‚Äôt help picturing them growing on my own skin. I scrubbed extra hard. I had to keep wearing the same white jumpsuit I wore before work started and I was getting paranoid that whatever those nodules were were trying to spread all over me like a disease.¬†

We were the first group out to lunch. With all that work lugging flesh, I was plenty hungry. Like every lunch, we had chicken sandwiches, curly fries, and a small plastic cup of ice cream. The others in my group started talking about something or other, but I couldn‚Äôt stop the nagging thought of those nodules. I

picked at my sandwich with a plastic fork, taking it apart by the layers. I think Ryan called my name two or three times before I realized he was saying it at all. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúLeave it alone, it‚Äôs already dead.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt feel like explaining it to him. ‚ÄúYeah...‚Äù I still bothered to cut the chicken and check its insides before I trusted it well enough to put it in my mouth. I peered into the chocolate milk box while I was at it. For extra measure, I poured some into my tray.¬†

‚ÄúElijah! Stop it! What are you doing?‚Äù¬†

‚Äú...Nothing.‚Äù I don‚Äôt think I drank any that day.¬†

\*\*\*¬†

A couple of days went by.¬†

I get assigned to the group with the latest shift. Back left section of the warehouse, the section bordered with orange floor tape. This was the first time being here, and thank goodness, because I‚Äôve been given enough time to prepare for what would happen. It was never going to be enough time, but I was bound to face it eventually.¬†

I grab a canister of E-9 solution and carry it over to my side of the table. I had my hair cut, got used to eating a decent amount of food, and Springsteen wasn‚Äôt so bad. I poured the chemicals into my bucket and started grabbing baskets as they came by, coating whatever I found in there with the nozzle. Arms, ears,

various fractions of people. I would say I was used to it all, but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs possible to ever say that with full confidence.¬†

The guy pulling baskets out of the shelves on the wall picked out one of the larger ones. ‚ÄúHelen,‚Äù he called down.¬†

I had heard them say this before, always in the orange section, but for whatever reason I didn‚Äôt think to acknowledge it until then. Just do the work and get it over with, was already my mindset those days. I didn‚Äôt bother myself with much else going on. Focus on Bruce, not the bubbling skin, but I didn‚Äôt believe I could keep that up for another eighty days or so. That day, I decided to bother myself with a larger basket. Usually I didn‚Äôt, but I didn‚Äôt think I could avoid them forever.¬†

‚ÄúHelen,‚Äù as it were, strode by on the conveyor and I absentmindedly reached out to grab it. As I was setting her down from the belt, I caught the slightest glance of what was inside.¬†

I gave out some sort of yelp and the heavy basket slid off the table and crashed onto the floor. I jumped away from the bench, nearly tripping over my own footing. Something I forgot to ask out about tipped out of the basket and flopped on the concrete floor. Half-a-woman. I don‚Äôt consider myself a vulgar man, but something slipped out of my mouth. I couldn‚Äôt categorize the immediate emotion I had. It was somewhere between shock, fear, and anger, like almost getting in a car wreck.¬†

The body‚Äîor Helen‚Äîtwitched in an effort to suffer the tumble. It made some groan that I wouldn‚Äôt have considered natural, and the body quickly stopped moving.

Ian pushed me out of the way.¬†

‚ÄúHey! There‚Äôs a reason they‚Äôre put in baskets!‚Äù He carefully picked her up and set her back in.¬†

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù I may have sounded exasperated, though I‚Äôm surprised I had it in me to say anything after witnessing that. ‚ÄúI thought we were cleaning body parts, not people!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúCleaning?‚Äù He dusted off whatever floor debris clung to her. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôre no people in this warehouse besides us. None of these baskets have anything you should consider people, but maybe you‚Äôre not smart enough for that kind of thing.‚Äù¬†

I already didn‚Äôt like the guy, and now he rattles off at me for responding, in my humble opinion, appropriately. As appropriate as someone can be for seeing a festering half-woman without warning. ‚ÄúMust have slipped my mind.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt slipped a little more than your mind.‚Äù He took the basket over to his section and started spraying the chemicals back and forth.¬†

I leaned against the table and steadied my breathing. I think what bothered me most wasn‚Äôt just seeing her, it was how much of her that was covered by those nodules. She had more than any of the other baskets by far. I didn‚Äôt get a good look at her‚ÄîI was really trying not to‚Äîbut the nodules on the side of her that were missing were especially awful. Her left leg ended near the knee and those shiny bumps‚ÄîI swear‚Äîwere so severe that they were beating. Her entire right side looked like it had been bitten off by a shark, from about the hip all the way up to the top of her skull. Half a person.¬†

That was the worst part about it all. Missing limbs I thought I could handle, but this‚Äîwhatever it is that‚Äôs going on‚Äîwas beyond me. As far as I was aware, this

was the only basket that housed any part of a skull. The rest were anything else. On top of that, there was something else I noticed. Most body parts had smoothed-out skin where they were severed from the rest of the body, not always, but generally. In her case, everywhere that was missing a section was covered in those nodules. There was no smooth skin to cover up those lost chunks. Each time I thought about it, it was like when you see somebody else‚Äôs injury. You couldn‚Äôt help but imagine it was you who was injured, and you feel that sharp feeling in the same spot on your own body.¬†

I think Ian told me later that day ‚Äúnot to sweat it‚Äù or something stupid. I don‚Äôt remember, I was already starting to not like the guy only a few days in.¬†

\*\*\*¬†

Besides that day, I was getting along alright. As long as I can get away with avoiding large orange section baskets, I would be fine. After her, the other baskets stopped bothering me altogether.¬†

I grabbed a canister of E-9 and lugged it to my area, bucket to nozzle, then got to work. Everything I did was fitting into a routine to the point where I‚Äôm not sure if I even noticed what was in the baskets anymore. My eyes blurred over from when work starts to when work ends. Pull one off the conveyor, spray back and forth, flip over, spray again, replace.¬†

I picked out a familiar chunk of flesh, the lower jaw and neck flap. My eyes focused back in as I flipped it around to where the inner-mouth nodules were. I thought I may have been mistaken whether it was really the same flesh because

there was a tongue in there. I almost forgot to spray the chemicals just so I could process it. Instead, I brought it over to Ryan who was working with me that day and asked him about it.¬†

‚ÄúMhm,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIs it the chemicals then?‚Äù¬†

He shrugged. ‚ÄúSeems so.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat happens when they‚Äôre done?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, they‚Äôre taken out.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnd then what?‚Äù¬†

He shook his head. ‚ÄúUsed...?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúUsed?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYes, used.‚Äù¬†

I didn‚Äôt think I was being intrusive, but he seemed to think differently. ‚ÄúThey get used, by anyone interested.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWho on Earth is int‚Äî?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know! Whoever! I don‚Äôt know what they do with them, I just know that they get taken out after a while. Maybe they just get sold.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWho‚Äôs looking to buy any of this? Or a woman?‚Äù He gave me a look that said, do I have to say it out loud? and my expression of curiosity disappeared. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure if they‚Äôre that desperate, they wouldn‚Äôt have to grow them in a chemical warehouse.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs none of our business. Really. I came here to get paid, not to ask questions,‚Äù he said

‚ÄúAlright, then how about this,‚Äù I started, ‚ÄúHow come I haven‚Äôt met anyone here who isn‚Äôt in the same boat as us? I haven‚Äôt seen any guards or anybody else working here besides us, have you?‚Äù¬†

Ryan put his nozzle down and turned his whole body to me. ‚ÄúElijah, I‚Äôm going to tell you something that can get you really far in the workplace. If there‚Äôs a big check on the way, then why ask so many questions? Don‚Äôt get nosy about things that don‚Äôt concern you. It doesn‚Äôt matter if anybody‚Äôs here to supervise us or not, the work is getting done. As far as they‚Äôre concerned, we‚Äôre doing our job. Don‚Äôt you think that's all they care about? It‚Äôs all I care about. Why hire somebody to watch over people who already do their work?‚Äù¬†

There was no use continuing with this guy. Both because he didn‚Äôt care and didn‚Äôt want to care. Ryan would‚Äôve done well in a formal workplace, I don‚Äôt know what made him choose to work here over anywhere else. I guess I could say the same about myself. I would start to wonder if anybody here knew where these things were going or why, but I wasn‚Äôt ready to get my hopes up. These people come in and they leave when their time is up, I wouldn‚Äôt expect them to know any more than Ryan.¬†

It had been bothering me why nobody else could be found working there. The closest we can get in contact with anyone else is when we hear that voice call, ‚ÄúClear,‚Äù as we pass through the small hallway to the warehouse. I never saw a camera, nobody made our food for us, we assigned each other to prepare our meals each day. That haircut I needed to get, that was from one of the guys. We were self-autonomous in all aspects, including who would lead each group and who

would be in those groups. We weren‚Äôt even given orientations, we had to learn from the others when we got there.¬†

Ryan did have a point, though. If we‚Äôre doing our work, who‚Äôs going to bother to check in on us?¬†

But that was before the chemicals were changed.",1,1754690383.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

The room is about 12x14, north facing, and it reads a bit cold in the afternoon. I‚Äôve got a light grey sofa, a simple black metal coffee table, an oak media unit, white rental walls, and a beige carpet. No feature wall, just two prints I haven‚Äôt framed yet.

For paint, I‚Äôm torn between a warm greige to fight the cool light or a muted green to add some colour. If you‚Äôve had a north-facing room, did a warm neutral help, or did colour work better? I‚Äôll be using samples, but I‚Äôd love direction on undertones to look for so it doesn‚Äôt go muddy.

Rug size is the next headache. The current 5x8 floats and looks small. Would an 8x10 be the safe call so the front sofa legs sit on it, or is there a case for 6x9 in a room this size? I‚Äôm keeping the beige carpet, so I‚Äôm thinking a low-pile patterned rug to add contrast without fighting the floor.

Curtains are last. The windows are standard height with blinds. I‚Äôm planning to hang the rod higher and a bit wider to make the window feel bigger. Linen look or blackout? The sofa fabric is cool grey, the hardware in the room is black, and I‚Äôm not sure if I should stay with black curtain rods or switch to brass to warm it up.

Lighting is weak right now. I‚Äôve only got one ceiling fixture. Would a floor lamp in the corner and a small table lamp by the sofa be enough, if I go for 2700K bulbs, or should I add picture lights above the prints later?",1,1754689956.0,HomeDecorating,0,1.0,False

My parents have told me their stories from that day and what has stuck with me is what my dad told me when he came to pick me up from daycare.

He told me I went up to the TV and repeated the word ‚Äúfire‚Äù over and over again.

The photo attached is a book that my grandparents had under their coffee table in their living room and whenever I would go to visit them, I would pull the book out and flip through the pages. I finally read through it when I could understand it and from then on, I would always look for books on the Twin Towers at my school library and would watch documentaries at home.

1ml7yo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1ml7yo9/i_have_used_the_principles_of_economics_to/,I have used the principles of economics to conclude that buying and drinking a single $2 monster energy drink is less expensive than drinking 1 capsule of coffee that cost less than $1,"

I was sad because for the past week, my coffee machine broke and I will only get a new one this coming Sunday. So I have been spending a lot of money each day buying energy drinks, and one energy drink is more expensive than 1 capsule of coffee

BUT, I just realized that for 1 energy drink, I am saving 1 capsule of coffee! Therefore the financial losses that I bear during this week are actually less than what I had initially feared.

Also, there is a less tangible benefit that I have experienced in drinking energy drinks as opposed to coffee! 

See, I understand that 1 energy drink is more expensive than 1 capsule of coffee. So upfront, I do pay more. However, there are two factors that prevent me from totally splurging on energy drinks: (1) energy drinks are not readily available to me; I have to walk to the convenience store and go outside to buy them. And (2) the cost itself. What these two factors mean is that I drink, approximately, a maximum of 5 monster drinks per day.

the immediate access of bulk coffee in my apartment, plus the cheap cost of each capsule, however, mean that typically I do go overboard on coffee. In fact, it's not uncommon for me to drink more than 8 capsules of coffee per day!

What this all means is that the expense of the energy drinks is offset BOTH by me not using capsules of coffee AND the strange fact that I drink less caffeine during this energy-drink phase, thus giving me some small health benefit.

ALSO,

I am severely addicted to both alcohol and DXM. Very fortunately, the cost of buying multiple energy drinks each day this week means that, due to my daily budget,I spend less on both alcohol and DXM each day this week.

What this all means, factoring in all that I benefit from each day this week, is that I gain non trivial health benefits this week. As a result of everything, not only is the upfront cost of 1 energy drink mitigated, but by the end of this week, I will have experienced a MINIMAL overall net cost.

EDIT: It is so counter intuitive because now, I have concluded that maybe I wanna reconsider buying coffee in bulk! And this means I may reconsider buying a $50 coffee machine and I will just stick to energy drinks from now on.

What started off as a minor inconvenience now translates to nearly $70 or so of an UPFRONT benefit to me, and the ongoing benefits of less addiction and caffeine.

1ml7sqz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Equestrian/comments/1ml7sqz/they_keep_cancelling_lessons_and_not_telling_me/,They keep cancelling lessons and not telling me,"I had been taking lessons for 1.5 year at an amazing barn with no problems. However, it got very pricey and I couldn't afford it anymore so I started looking for a cheaper place. Found one that is 40 minutes away. I don't drive and I have to take two different means of transportation to get there. It's a very nice barn, though with generally better horses and instructors that do a great job and really pay attention to you during lessons. It has amazing ratings online and everything is absolutely perfect except one thing.

I've been taking lessons there for only 1 month. I prepaid a package of 10 lessons, so I go twice a week. BUT, here's the thing. It's only been one month and they've already cancelled lessons 4 times and didn't tell me! First time was because it was raining. I didn't know it was raining over there and I went there to find it closed. I called to ask about it and they apologised for not calling or texting me. I thought, whatever, accidents happen and I went back home. Second time they cancelled was because the arena was a little slippery and they didn't want to risk a horse injury. Absolutely acceptable, but again, I didn't know and went 40 minutes to find it closed again. They apologised and promised it wouldn't happen again. They asked me if I wanted to book my lesson for another day and we booked it for two days later. They told me they'd do the lessons and I'd be fine going there. So I did, only to find the place open but no lessons happening. They said the horses hadn't been ridden in a few days, they weren't ready for lessons and needed to be lunged. I was very very upset. It was the third time happening in one month! I have to take 2 means of transportation and spend 40 minutes to go there and 40 minutes to go back home! I am a very busy person and I'm currently working on my master's thesis so my time is very very carefully calculated and planned. I'm not the type of person to make a big deal out of things or start arguing, but I was so upset that I told them it was wrong of them to not text me or let me know for the third time in one month, especially considering that they've let everyone else know and they KNOW I come from kind of far away. They apologised and offered to pay for a taxi for me and some free coffee. I kindly declined and told them that it was okay, but I will have to leave if it happens again.

I'm still extremely upset. I've wasted SO much time when I could be working on my thesis and studying. I can't wait to finish my prepaid lessons so I leave this place. Such an amazing barm, but this is a joke! I think it's worth it paying more but being ten minutes from home and responsible with their cancellations.

My goal weight is 200 but I might decide to just push on to 180 and get down 100lbs, but I felt very healthy and pretty at 200 so I might just stick to that. I got checked for thyroid issues and it seems my metabolism is totally normal.

I am currently aiming for 1500-1800 calories a day depending on my activity level, and allowing myself a 2200 calorie cheat day once every month or on special occasions (holidays, anniversary, etc). I depend on fast food a lot since I‚Äôm always getting stuff in between classes and live in a dorm, but I have done tons of research on different places and discovered healthy options at places like Chickfila, where I can get a meal for 500-600 calories. Such as the grilled nuggets or cool wrap with kale crunch or a side salad, with only the low cal dressings. Or getting burgers with no bun or cheese and just the meat and veggies and mustard. Is this going to set me back? 

I also got addicted to soda so I will be drinking diet sodas still occasionally, I‚Äôve been told this is bad but I‚Äôve drank diet sodas losing weight in the past and didn‚Äôt have problems. I also love my coffee with zero calorie sweetener. I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs a myth that this will screw me up.

It would be subtle, comfortable, and disguised as ‚Äúnormal life.‚Äù

# Tactical breakdown ‚Äî categories + concrete examples

# 1) Distraction & chronic busyness

**Goal:** remove quiet space where people ask big questions.  
**Examples:**

* Work culture that praises always-on responsiveness: ‚ÄúBe available, hustle, you‚Äôll get ahead.‚Äù
* Apps & notifications designed to fragment attention ‚Äî feed after feed replacing morning devotion.
* Hobbies turned into consumption (binge-watching instead of contemplation).

# 2) Comfort & consumerism

**Goal:** make comfort feel like the main aim of life.  
**Examples:**

* Framing spending as self-care (‚Äútreat yourself‚Äù) so material comfort becomes identity.
* Churches or spiritual communities emphasizing amenities (coffee, entertainment) over discipleship ‚Äî religion as leisure.

# 3) Moral relativism & spin

**Goal:** blur moral lines so ‚Äòright‚Äô looks like a preference.  
**Examples:**

* ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs valid‚Äù rhetoric that avoids addressing wrong actions.
* Language switches: from ‚Äúsin‚Äù to ‚Äúdifference of opinion‚Äù to avoid conviction.

# 4) Pride & intellectualism

**Goal:** make skepticism feel superior to faith.  
**Examples:**

* Elevating clever doubt as the sign of sophistication: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe anything without proof.‚Äù
* Intellectualism used to dismiss spiritual experiences as ‚Äòna√Øve‚Äô.

# 5) Compartmentalization / Sunday-only faith

**Goal:** keep faith boxed into one hour a week.  
**Examples:**

* ‚ÄúI‚Äôm spiritual, but not religious‚Äù as a way to avoid commitments that shape behavior.
* Treating church like a social appointment, not a formative community.

# 6) Counterfeit spirituality

**Goal:** provide spiritual substitutes that satisfy feeling but not truth.  
**Examples:**

* Popular ‚Äòself-help‚Äô teachers who blend psychology with spiritual-sounding platitudes but avoid claims about God or sin.
* Spiritual practices divorced from doctrine (meditation stripped of moral/relational context).

# 7) Institutional capture & scandal

**Goal:** make institutions look corrupt so people abandon the whole idea.  
**Examples:**

* Real cases of church hypocrisy amplified and generalized (‚ÄúThey‚Äôre all like that‚Äù) so people distrust any community.
* Political co-option that turns spiritual spaces into partisan clubs.

# 8) Normalizing small vices

**Goal:** slowly shift the moral baseline.  
**Examples:**

* Casual acceptance of porn, gambling, substance use as ‚Äúnot a big deal.‚Äù
* Language that excuses immoral choices (‚Äúeveryone does it,‚Äù ‚Äúit‚Äôs just once‚Äù).

# 9) Emotional manipulation & false compassion

**Goal:** substitute empathy for truth.  
**Examples:**

* When someone gently refuses conviction, saying, ‚ÄúWho are you to judge?‚Äù to silence correction.
* Portraying firm moral teaching as cruelty rather than care.

# 10) Addictions (chemical, digital, social)

**Goal:** hijack reward systems so long-term spiritual aims are sacrificed for immediate reward.  
**Examples:**

* Social media likes becoming the daily ‚Äúholy sacrament‚Äù of approval.
* Substance use as escape from spiritual pain instead of addressing root issues.

# 11) Incremental commitments & slippery slopes

**Goal:** make big compromises feel small.  
**Examples:**

* First a harmless white lie, then another, then a pattern that erodes integrity.
* ‚ÄúJust this time‚Äù thinking turning into identity.

# 12) Aesthetic seduction & eroticization

**Goal:** make sensual imagery and culture center-stage so transcendence becomes a background token.  
**Examples:**

* Media that constantly sexualizes relationships, making intimacy a consumption product, not covenantal.
* Art that celebrates nihilism or empty rebellion as powerful.

# Why this works (quick psychology)

* **Habituation:** humans adapt to repeated inputs; small, repeated nudges change norms.
* **Cognitive load:** when people are mentally exhausted they default to easy choices (comfort, distraction).
* **Social proof:** if everyone around you compromises, it feels safer to do the same.
* **Identity drift:** repeated small choices change self-concept from ‚ÄúI follow X‚Äù to ‚ÄúI prefer Y.‚Äù

# Tiny scenarios (short, vivid examples)

* **The graduate** who tells themselves there will be time to think about faith after their PhD. Ten years later ‚Äî no pause.
* **The new parent** who replaces a morning devotional with a ‚Äúquick scroll‚Äù to unwind at 6 a.m. ‚Äî the pattern becomes permanent sleep-and-scroll.
* **The churchgoer** who leaves because leadership fights over trivia; they never find a community that helps them wrestle with real questions.
* **The artist** who says, ‚ÄúI want my work to challenge everything,‚Äù and slowly frames moral anchors as censorship, equating rebellion with depth.",3,1754688035.0,OrientalOrthodoxy,0,0.71,False

PANCE Attempt 1: 349 (missed passing by 1 point)
My first attempt went poorly. I didn‚Äôt sleep much the night before. I waited a full month after graduation to attempt, I was probably iron deficient due to paleness and bleeding, and I had disruptive family stress in the 2 days leading up to my attempt. During that 1 month of review, I mainly did Rosh Live, read high yield PPP pages, and completed all blueprint practice exams. 

I took 1 month off before returning to any studying. For the next 2 months, I then went to my local library 6 days per week and a coffee shop on Sundays, spending 4-6 hour studying sessions grinding through UWorld question blocks while reading the explanations and doing deep review while taking notes in my PPP books for any missed concepts. I would do an extra 20 Anki endeavor questions in the evening.

Here is the single most important thing you must do if you have already failed the PANCE once: You must complete **deep focused review remediation of all missed concepts from your first attempt as provided in your score report**, as these questions have a high likelihood of being seen again on future attempts. 

If you have never taken the PANCE, you must complete your own review of the PANCE blueprint. Do not rely on existing blueprint study guides or fail to review all topics in detail at least once before your exam. Do your own independent deep review of all blueprint topics.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of a universal battery hinges on several critical features that determine its performance and compatibility.

**Capacity:** The battery capacity, measured in milliampere-hours (mAh) or watt-hours (Wh), dictates how many times you can charge a device or how long it can power a device before needing to be recharged itself. Higher capacity allows for more charges or extended usage.

Capacity is a crucial factor when selecting a universal battery. A battery with a lower capacity might be suitable for charging a smartphone once, while a higher capacity battery can charge multiple devices multiple times or power a laptop for several hours. Consider your typical usage scenarios to determine the ideal capacity for your needs. Batteries boasting 20,000mAh or higher are becoming increasingly common,offering significant power reserves for extended travel or emergency situations.

**Portability:** A universal battery should be relatively compact and lightweight for easy transport. The size and weight directly impact its practicality for everyday carry or travel usage.

Portability represents a vital consideration,especially for those who plan to carry the battery in a backpack,purse,or pocket. Bulky and heavy batteries detract from their utility, making them less convenient for on-the-go scenarios. Manufacturers are increasingly focused on miniaturizing universal batteries without compromising capacity, utilizing advanced battery technologies and compact designs to achieve optimal portability. Target weights under 1 pound are desirable for many consumers.

**Charging Speed:** Fast charging capabilities, supporting protocols like USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) and Qualcomm swift Charge, allow for quicker device charging. This feature minimizes downtime and enhances overall convenience.

Charging speed is a significant differentiator among universal batteries. USB-PD, in particular, enables rapid charging for compatible devices like laptops and newer smartphones. Quick Charge facilitates faster charging for devices that support the Qualcomm standard. A universal battery capable of delivering at least 18W output via USB-PD is highly desirable for users seeking efficient charging. Furthermore, the battery itself can benefit from fast charging inputs, reducing the replenishment time.

**Port Variety:** The number and type of ports (USB-A, USB-C, AC outlet) determine the range of devices the battery can charge. A versatile battery should offer a variety of ports to accommodate different devices and charging needs.

Port variety serves as a strong indicator of a universal battery's true universality. USB-A ports are still prevalent for older devices but USB-C is becoming the standard. The inclusion of an AC outlet, while increasing the battery's size and cost, enables it to power small appliances and laptops that don't charge via USB. A combination of USB-A, USB-C with Power Delivery, and potentially an AC outlet creates a robust charging ecosystem.

**Durability and Safety:** A robust build quality ensures the battery can withstand everyday wear and tear. Safety features, such as overcharge protection and short circuit prevention, safeguard both the battery and the connected devices.

Safety and durability are paramount when dealing with rechargeable batteries. High-quality materials and construction contribute to the battery's longevity and protect it from damage. Overcharge protection, short circuit prevention, and temperature control mechanisms are essential safety features that prevent accidents and ensure the battery operates safely. Reputable brands often include certifications from recognized safety organizations.

* Suggesting I might be autistic and dyslexic and pressuring me to disclose conditions I do not have, saying they were ‚Äúlegally obligated to be shared.‚Äù
* Telling me she believed I was her reincarnated aborted daughter.
* Predicting my unborn baby would be born with Down syndrome and calling that ‚Äúmy greatest joy.‚Äù

These statements felt invasive, destabilizing, and out of place in a workplace setting.

# 2. Pregnancy Discrimination and Denial of Accommodations

After I disclosed my pregnancy, I formally requested rest breaks, modified duties, and flexibility for prenatal care.

* HR approved these through mid-September.
* Kate told me, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt get accommodations without a doctor‚Äôs note.‚Äù My understanding of Illinois law is that this is not required.
* During a miscarriage lasting six weeks (confirmed by my doctor), I was still assigned heavy inventory, cleaning, and bar shifts while visibly unwell. I received only one day off during this time.
* I was later informed that Kate sought legal advice about having me sign an NDA related to the miscarriage.

# 3. Retaliation for Raising Concerns

After I raised concerns about accommodations and potential legal violations:

* My job was posted online while I was on sick leave for three days due to food poisoning.
* I was told I was ‚Äúa liability‚Äù and compared to a previous kitchen manager in a negative way.
* I was pressured to ‚Äúforgive her‚Äù or consider ‚Äútransitioning out.‚Äù
* She told me that if I couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúmove past this,‚Äù we would need to discuss my exit from the company.

# 4. Hostile Meeting on August 7

During a meeting on August 7:

* Kate met with me upstairs without allowing my chosen witness to attend, instead selecting another employee of her choosing.
* She told me to ‚Äúfix my face‚Äù and accused me of being disrespectful.
* She asked me to leave the premises while I was pregnant and visibly in distress, and said that if she messaged me about work, I would be required to respond even though I had voluntarily clocked out.
* She initially would not confirm I‚Äôd be paid for the rest of my shift. She said I would be paid only if I stayed clocked in, which would also obligate me to respond to her messages.
* She told me to wait off-premises while arranging transportation.

Illinois is a one-party consent state. I legally recorded this conversation and have a third-party witness. The transcript has been provided to HR and legal authorities.

# 5. Cultural, Racial, and Psychological Harm

As a woman of color, I raised concerns about:

* What I and others perceived as an infantilizing ‚ÄúTraining Treats‚Äù system (staff, many of whom were POC and LGBTQ+, received a treat after completing a task).
* Mandatory ‚Äúworking agreements‚Äù and ‚Äúchecking assumptions,‚Äù which I felt were used in ways that discouraged open discussion.

When I raised these concerns collectively with coworkers, I was told that group complaints were not permitted and that issues must be addressed directly to Kate.

# 6. Termination vs. Resignation

In my final week, I told leadership I intended to resign.

* Before I could submit my resignation, Kate began termination steps.
* My access to work systems was removed.
* Private security escorted me from the premises.
* I submitted my resignation by text at 1:03 PM. Kate later attempted to classify my departure as a termination, which could affect unemployment eligibility.

# 7. Exposure to Explicit Materials at Work

While employed there, I and others encountered:

* Pornographic magazines in shared work areas.
* Graphic sexual artwork by Kate (including depictions of women performing oral sex) stored in supply boxes used for caf√© signage.
* No advance warning or consent was given before placing these materials in common spaces.

When concerns were raised, the response I heard included being called ‚Äúoverly sensitive‚Äù or lacking ‚Äútaste for art.‚Äù To my knowledge, no corrective action was taken. This environment included minors and vulnerable staff.

# Laws I Believe May Apply

Based on my understanding and legal advice I have sought, the following laws may be relevant:

* Pregnancy Discrimination Act (Title VII)
* Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA)
* Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)
* Illinois Human Rights Act
* Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)
* Chicago Fair Workweek Ordinance
* EEOC protections against retaliation

# Final Statement

I was hired to lead with compassion, precision, and integrity. What I experienced instead was conduct I believe to be harmful, discriminatory, and inconsistent with the caf√©‚Äôs stated values.

Necessary & Sufficient Coffee markets itself as a progressive, woman-owned business. My personal experience tells a different story‚Äîone that I feel the public, and especially potential employees, deserve to hear.

Mia Turner stood frozen at the entrance to the living room, her fingers clutching the strap of her work bag. Her sister Lily had interrupted her while she was getting ready, insisting their mother had something important to discuss.¬†

‚ÄúMia, sit down,‚Äù her mother, Mary Turner, ordered, lounging on the worn-out sofa like a queen holding court. Her bright red lipstick clashed with the faded blush on her face, her manicured nails tapping against her wine glass.

‚ÄúCan‚Äôt this wait? I have work,‚Äù Mia replied, her voice tight. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford to be late again.‚Äù

Her mother raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWork? You mean playing servant to those rich snobs at Casa Lounge? Please.‚Äù

Mia bit her tongue. She knew better than to rise to the bait. She needed this job. Casa Lounge wasn‚Äôt just a paycheck; it was her lifeline, the first step in her plan to save enough money to leave Willowcrest and the stigma of being a Turner behind.

Ethan, her older brother, sat slouched in the corner, scrolling through his phone. His indifference to the chaos of their family was almost admirable. At least he stayed out of the endless bickering.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this about, Mom?‚Äù Mia asked, her patience slipping.

Mary‚Äôs lips curled into a smile. ‚ÄúWe have good news.‚Äù

Mia blinked, skeptical. ‚ÄúGood news?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes!‚Äù Lily, the eldest, jumped in, practically glowing with excitement. ‚ÄúI got a golden invite to the Willowcrest Unicorn Party!‚Äù

Mia blinked again, slower this time, trying to process how this was supposed to be good news. The Unicorn Party‚Äîthe most exclusive, over-the-top event for the rich and powerful‚Äîwas as far removed from her world as the moon.

‚ÄúAnd this is good news‚Ä¶ how?‚Äù Mia asked, genuinely baffled.

‚ÄúAttending will be nice though,‚Äù Ethan muttered without looking up from his phone.

‚ÄúNice?!‚Äù Lily‚Äôs voice rose an octave. ‚ÄúDo you have any idea what this means? The richest bachelors in the world will be there! This is it!‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd how did your name end up on the list?‚Äù Mia asked, her tone sharper than she intended.

‚ÄúConnections,‚Äù Mary said smugly, swirling her wine.

Mia didn‚Äôt want to dig deeper into what kind of ‚Äúconnections‚Äù her mother was referring to. She knew the answer wouldn‚Äôt be pleasant.

‚ÄúOkay, so Lily‚Äôs going to some fancy party. What does that have to do with me?‚Äù Mia asked, checking the time on her phone. She really couldn‚Äôt afford to be late.

Mary leaned forward, her voice dropping into a conspiratorial tone. ‚ÄúThis is our chance, Mia. Lily just needs to catch the eye of the right man. A billionaire. Someone who can change all our lives.‚Äù

Mia resisted the urge to roll her eyes. Of course, it was another one of her mother‚Äôs schemes. Everything in Mary Turner‚Äôs life revolved around chasing rich men, and her daughters were no exception.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy for Lily,‚Äù Mia said flatly, rising to leave. ‚ÄúCongratulations and good luck with the party. I have to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúSit down, Mia,‚Äù Mary snapped, her tone sharpening.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt be late‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúSit!‚Äù

Reluctantly, Mia dropped back onto the couch, glancing at the clock on the wall. She was already cutting it too close.

‚ÄúListen, you all know how much we suffer and lose after that old bastard put me in Jail. This is a one time opportunity that will change our lives forever‚Äù

‚Äú How does that even concern me? Or did the whole family get invited?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou wish‚Ä¶‚Äù Lily said with snort. ‚Äú No one is inviting you to that kind of party with that face‚Äù

Ethan chuckles, pulling eyes to him

‚ÄúLily you have to stop pretending, like Mia isn't the prettiest in this family‚Äù Ethan said, eyes still fixed on his phone.

‚ÄúEww, don't say it like that you're my brother‚Äù Mia smiles, always trying to get under his brother's skin

‚ÄúDid I mention she is the most stupid?‚Äù

‚ÄúI try‚Äù

‚ÄúEnough both of you‚Äù Mary scolds

‚ÄúI seriously need to get to work mom, whatever this is obviously doesn't concern me‚Äù

‚ÄúAlways so proud talking about it, like it's a real job?‚Äù Anna, the middle sister, said with a snide laugh.

‚ÄúAt least I‚Äôm doing something!‚Äù Mia snapped.

Before the argument could escalate further, Mary‚Äôs phone buzzed. She checked the screen, a sly smile spreading across her face. ‚ÄúSame time, same place, Barry? I‚Äôll be there,‚Äù she said into the phone, her voice dripping with seduction.

Mia felt a wave of disgust wash over her. She didn‚Äôt need to guess what the call was about. It was her mother‚Äôs usual business‚Äîentertaining some wealthy man in exchange for cash, gifts, or favors.

As Mary hung up, she turned her attention back to Mia. ‚ÄúThe point is, we all need to contribute to get your sister everything she needs for that party. You included.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is ridiculous mom! Count me out,‚Äù Mia said, her voice steely.

Mary‚Äôs eyes narrowed. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be selfish, Mia. This is for the family.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don't have have money‚Äù

‚ÄúYes you do‚Äù Anna rushed to say. ‚ÄúYou've been saving a lot of money for college.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike you said college‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is more than college and I've told you a thousand times you're a Turner you have no business with College‚Äù Mary says, checking her phone.

‚Äú And I have said it a million times, I'm not like you! I don't want to be like you, I don't want to sit around and wait for some rich guy to come change my life‚Äù

‚ÄúSo you think you're better than us now?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my god! I'm leaving. Lily I'm sure you can sort yourself out, and if you do get your billionaire boyfriend or husband remember not to give me a dime from his money‚Äù

Mia grabs her bag and heads for the door.

College in another country is her way out, no one is jeopardizing that for her.

There's nothing she wants than to leave this town, remove the curse name she bears from her existence.

‚ÄúOh you're a Turner, never mind‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're a Turner you have no say‚Äù

‚ÄúGirl you're a Turner‚Äù

‚ÄúYou're Turner Shut up and open your legs‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a Turner trying to form modesty‚Äù

# Chosen For The Game

Alexander Blackwell was known for many things in Willowcrest: his wealth, his looks, his reputation as the bad boy every story tried to capture, but never quite could. Patience, however, wasn‚Äôt on the list. Yet, for Zoe Harrington‚Äîhis girlfriend‚Äîhe tried. Tried being the word.

Casa Lounge was his usual spot in the evenings, the perfect escape before his underground matches. Tonight, though, he wasn‚Äôt supposed to be here. He had a fight in less than two hours, but it was Zoe‚Äôs birthday. And Zoe got what Zoe wanted‚Äîmost of the time.

He sat back in his booth, swirling his glass of whiskey lazily as he watched Zoe talking to a new face in Willowcrest, her glittery dress hugging her like a second skin. She was shamelessly rubbing her body on him‚ÄîDickson, or whatever his name was. A new face in Willowcrest, clearly is unaware of who Alexander was.

The sight didn‚Äôt bother him; nothing Zoe did ever truly got under his skin. Their relationship thrived on chaos. He smirked, watching her antics, amused more than anything else. She was testing him, as always.

When Zoe finally realized her games weren‚Äôt ruffling his feathers, she walks over to him, her pout on full display.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt even get jealous anymore,‚Äù she whined, plopping down beside him.

Alexander looked up from his glass, his voice calm and cool. ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do, break some poor guy‚Äôs nose?‚Äù

Her pout deepened. ‚ÄúWhen did you even start caring about people?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly my point!‚Äù She crossed her arms, glaring. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so‚Ä¶ boring now.‚Äù

Alexander hummed in response, his attention flicking toward the crowd again. But then his gaze caught on someone. A Turner.

There she was laughing with her coworker at the bar. Her smile lit up her otherwise simple features, her uniform crisp and modest.The sight of her irritates him.

He did consider asking his friend that owns the place to fire her when they first employed her.

‚ÄúMan, why would you employ a Turner?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe's pretty‚Äù

‚ÄúStill a Turner‚Äù

‚ÄúWon't be one when her pretty lips are wrapped around my dick‚Äù

‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on I want to have a taste of all of them‚Äù

He blinks back to reality, jaw tensed. He knew all about the Turners. Everyone in Willowcrest did. A family that had no business staying in this town.

‚ÄúI feel like our spark is dying.‚Äù

Alexander sighed, half-listening as he took another sip of his drink. ‚ÄúYou say that every day, babe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean it this time. I think we need‚Ä¶ more games.‚Äù

He raised a brow, setting his glass down. ‚ÄúGames? Zoe, we did threesomes the entire month of October. What‚Äôs left?‚Äù

She leaned forward, pressing her lips against his, her tone dropping to a playful whisper. ‚ÄúI want us to go extreme this time.‚Äù

He tilted his head, watching her with mild amusement. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre insane.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe both are.‚Äù She smiled sweetly, her eyes glinting with mischief.

He sighed, leaning back. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your big idea this time?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe break up for a month,‚Äù she began, her smile widening. ‚ÄúWe each date someone new. You sleep with them, I sleep with mine.‚Äù

Alexander stared at her, incredulous. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve officially lost it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, come on! It‚Äôll be fun,‚Äù Zoe pressed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like we don‚Äôt always find our way back to each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs the benefit of this game? Or is this just your twisted idea of fun?‚Äù

‚ÄúTo spice up our relationship!‚Äù she said as though it were obvious. ‚ÄúAnd‚Äî‚Äù she added with a wink‚Äî‚Äúyou‚Äôll be saying no to my birthday present if you don‚Äôt agree.‚Äù

‚ÄúThought you wanted a shopping spree in Paris?‚Äù he drawled.

She waved it off. ‚ÄúChanged my mind.‚Äù

Alexander sighed, rubbing his temple. ‚ÄúFine.‚Äù

Zoe practically squealed, climbing into his lap to kiss him. ‚ÄúThank you, baby!‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm already regretting this,‚Äù he muttered against her lips.

‚ÄúOkay, okay, let‚Äôs pick!‚Äù Zoe said, bouncing excitedly. Her eyes darted around the lounge. ‚ÄúNot her. Not her. Oh‚Äîher!‚Äù

Alexander followed her gaze, his glass pausing mid-air. His eyes landed on Mia Turner, and he nearly choked on his drink.

‚ÄúA Turner?‚Äù he asked in disbelief.

Zoe nodded enthusiastically. ‚ÄúYup. I heard she‚Äôs different from her sisters. Lucas even tried to get with her, and she turned him down. Can you imagine? She might actually give you a challenge.‚Äù

Alexander shook his head firmly. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not getting anywhere near a Turner, Zoe.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut she‚Äôs pretty,‚Äù Zoe argued.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs still a Turner.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlex, please?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo Zoe I‚Äôm not putting my dick into a Turner ‚Äú

Zoe pouted, turning her attention to her nails. ‚ÄúFine. If you‚Äôre not going to play, fine. But I guess my birthday‚Äôs ruined.‚Äù

Alexander groaned. As twisted as their relationship was, he loved Zoe. They‚Äôd grown up together, transitioning from childhood friends to lovers. And while she drove him insane, he couldn‚Äôt imagine life without her.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù he finally relented.

Zoe lit up, throwing her arms around his neck. ‚ÄúYes! Thank you, baby! Okay, now your turn. Pick someone for me.‚Äù

Alexander leaned back, scanning the room. His eyes landed on Jeremy‚Äîa local businessman and soon-to-be groom. A wicked smirk curved his lips. ‚ÄúHim.‚Äù

Zoe frowned. ‚ÄúJeremy? Isn‚Äôt he getting married next month?‚Äù

‚ÄúEven better,‚Äù Alexander replied smoothly. ‚ÄúLike you said, the game is sweeter if it‚Äôs harder to achieve.‚Äù

Zoe grinned. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre twisted, Alex.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a Blackwell babes ?‚Äù

# The Proposal

Mia was exhausted. Her legs ached from standing for hours, her head throbbed from the endless stream of demanding customers, and her soul felt drained from another day of pretending to be unbothered.¬†

Casa Lounge had been bustling tonight, and all she wanted now was to catch the next bus home, crawl into bed, and pray that her mother and siblings were out of the house. She couldn‚Äôt deal with them today‚Äînot with their drama, their judgment, and their constant reminder of the name she desperately wanted to escape.¬†¬†

She stood at the bus stop, clutching her bag tightly, watching as headlights passed by, one after the other. The night air was cool, the breeze teasing strands of her hair.

Her thoughts were interrupted by the purr of an engine. Mia looked up, startled, as a sleek black sports car slowed to a stop in front of her. Its headlights bathed her in blinding light. She squinted, taking a step back, ready to bolt if necessary. Nothing good ever came out of expensive cars stopping for people like her.¬†¬†

The door opened, and out stepped Alexander Blackwell.¬†¬†

Mia‚Äôs breath caught in her throat.¬†¬†

He wasn‚Äôt just handsome; he was devastatingly handsome. Towering with broad shoulders, a face carved like a Greek god, and an aura of confidence that demanded attention, Alexander Blackwell was every bit the enigma he is said to be. His presence was overwhelming, the kind of presence that knocked the air out of your lungs before you even realized it.¬†¬†

He leaned casually against his car, his gaze fixed on her like he had all the time in the world.¬†¬†

""Hey,"" he said, his voice smooth and laced with an edge of arrogance.¬†¬†

Mia blinked, unsure if her brain was playing tricks on her. She glanced behind her, twice, certain there must be someone else he was addressing. Surely, ‚Äòa Blackwell‚Äô couldn‚Äôt be talking to her.¬†¬†

""I‚Äôm talking to you, Turner,"" he said, smirking.¬†¬†

Her mind went blank. All she could do was stammer. ""W-what? Me?""¬†¬†

""Yup.""¬†¬†

Mia clutched her bag tighter. She looked at him like he‚Äôd just announced the sky was green. ""Why‚Ä¶ why are you talking to me?""¬†¬†

His smirk deepened, and then, without warning, he said, ""Go on a date with me.""¬†¬†

Mia froze. The words hit her like a thunderclap. Did she hear him right? She blinked rapidly, waiting for the punchline, but his face remained serious, even amused.¬†¬†

""What?"" she choked out. ""Y-you have a girlfriend.""¬†¬†

Alexander shrugged, pushing his hands into his pockets. ""Not anymore. We broke up. Check the news, Turner.""¬†¬†

The casual way he said it made her feel like she‚Äôd stepped into some alternate reality. Her mind struggled to catch up.¬†¬†

""I don‚Äôt understand,"" she said, her voice shaky.¬†¬†

""How much?""¬†¬†

Mia blinked again. ""What?""¬†¬†

""I said, how much to go on dates with me?""¬†¬†

It took her a second to process his words. Her jaw dropped as realization hit her. ""You‚Ä¶ you want to pay me to go on dates with you?""¬†¬†

""Maybe,"" he said, his tone nonchalant, as if he were discussing the weather.¬†¬†

""Why?"" she demanded, her voice rising in confusion. ‚Äú You don‚Äôt even know my name!""¬†¬†

""I know enough, Turner.""¬†

God! she hates when she's being address like this

Mia felt anger under her exhaustion. Her hands balled into fists at her sides. ""No,"" she said firmly.¬†¬†

Alexander raised a brow. ""What?""¬†¬†

""I said no.""¬†¬†

He tilted his head, genuinely surprised. ""Why?""¬†¬†

Mia stared at him, incredulous. ""What do you mean, why? You don‚Äôt even know me. You‚Äôve never talked to me before. And now you suddenly want to‚Äîwhat?‚Äîbuy me for dates? When I just saw you yesterday with your girlfriend""¬†¬†

""Don‚Äôt tell me you were watching me, Turner,"" he said, his smirk returning.¬†¬†

""You wish,"" she snapped.¬†¬†

""Trust me, that can‚Äôt be part of my wishes,"" he said coolly. His eyes glinted with amusement. ""Name your price, Turner.""¬†¬†

""I said no!"" she spat, her voice firm. ""You can‚Äôt just buy people to go on dates with you. I‚Äôm not interested.""¬†¬†

Alexander‚Äôs smirk faltered for a split second. He stepped closer, his presence overwhelming, as he stared down at her. ""You‚Äôre a Turner,"" he said, his tone dropping. ""Stop acting like you have any pride""¬†¬†

Her chest tightened, anger bubbling inside her. ""Please, leave me alone,"" she said through gritted teeth.¬†¬†

He stepped back, his smirk returning like a mask. ""Three dates, Five thousand, for each.""¬†¬†

Mia‚Äôs eyes widened. ""What?""¬†¬†

""You heard me. Sleep over it, Turner.""¬†¬†

And just like that, he turned, got into his car, and drove off, leaving her standing there, speechless, her thoughts swirling into chaos.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhat the hell?‚Äù

# The Tempting Offer

Mia barely got any sleep that night. She tossed and turned, replaying the surreal encounter with Alexander Blackwell over and over in her mind. The way he‚Äôd looked at her, the arrogance in his tone, the absurdity of his offer‚Äî5,000 per date? It felt like a cruel joke, one meant to humiliate her.¬†¬†

But then the thought of the money would creep back in, unbidden. 5 thousand dollars. For three dates, that will be 15 thousand dollars. It was more money than she could hope to save in years at Casa Lounge.¬†

15 thousand could pay for a lot, rent, food... It could be her fastest way out of Willowcrest.¬†

Mia sat up in bed and groaned, running her hands through her hair. No. She shouldn't even entertain the thoughts.¬†

Whatever game Alexander Blackwell was playing, she wanted no part of it. That money might save her now, but taking money from a Blackwell will definitely come with strings she wasn‚Äôt willing to pull.¬†

By morning, she was still exhausted but determined to stick to her decision. She trudged out of her tiny room and into the kitchen, hoping for some coffee to start her day. As she entered, she heard her sisters talking, their voices low.¬†

‚ÄúThere's no way it‚Äôs real,‚Äù Lily was saying, her tone dripping with skepticism.¬†¬†

‚ÄúIt could be,‚Äù Anna shot back, flipping her hair over her shoulder. ‚ÄúPeople are saying it all over town.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù Mia asked groggily, heading to the cupboard to grab a glass. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Mom?‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúOut. Probably won‚Äôt be back until God knows when,‚Äù Anna replied, not even sparing her a glance.¬†¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre delusional if you think they‚Äôve broken up,‚Äù Lily said, laughing. ‚ÄúZoe would rather chew glass than break up with Blackwell.‚Äù¬†¬†

Mia froze, her hand clutching the glass tightly.¬†¬†

‚ÄúOr maybe he broke up with her,‚Äù Anna said with a sly smile.¬†¬†

Lily snorted. ‚ÄúOh my God, Anna, don‚Äôt tell me you‚Äôre still holding onto the hope that you‚Äôll get him one day. It‚Äôs embarrassing at this point.‚Äù¬†¬†

Mia turned slowly, her stomach sinking as she listened to the exchange.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not delusional!‚Äù Anna snapped. ‚ÄúAnd you‚Äôre one to talk. At least I tried. Unlike you, who‚Äôs too busy chasing any rich guy who gives you a second glance.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚Äú‚ÄòTried‚Äô is an understatement,‚Äù Lily said, cackling. ‚ÄúWalking around naked in the Blackwell mansion three days after you were employed? Please. That was pathetic.‚Äù¬†¬†

Anna‚Äôs face flushed, and she opened her mouth to retort, but Lily kept going.¬†¬†

‚ÄúFace it, Anna. We‚Äôre Turners. The Blackwells doesn‚Äôt even look at us like we‚Äôre human. They hate our family‚Äôs existence.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhatever,‚Äù Anna huffed, crossing her arms.¬†¬†

Mia forced herself to move, walking to the sink to pour herself some water. Her hands were shaking, and she prayed neither of them would notice.¬†

HmmOnce inside, she grabbed her phone from the nightstand and immediately opened the Willowcrest Morning News. There, staring back at her in bold letters, was the headline:¬†¬†

\*\*Alexander Blackwell and Zoe Harrington Call It Quits.\*\*¬†¬†

Mia‚Äôs heart raced as she read the article. Zoe had confirmed the breakup in an interview the night before, saying they‚Äôd decided to take a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù to focus on themselves. The tone of the article was suspicious, though, hinting at drama behind the scenes.¬†¬†

Mia put the phone down and leaned against the wall, her mind spinning. Was this why he‚Äôd approached her? Because he was single now and needed someone to‚Ä¶ what? Fill the void? Become part of his ridiculous games?¬†¬†

She shook her head.

She couldn‚Äôt let herself get sucked into whatever madness was going on.¬†¬†

Just then, her phone buzzed in her hand. The notification made her stomach drop. She hesitated for a moment before looking at the screen.¬†¬†

The message was from an unknown number.¬†¬†

Good morning, Turner. Don‚Äôt bother asking how I got your number. My offer still stands: three dates, 5,000 for each one. You have three days to decide.¬†¬†

Mia stared at the message, her heart pounding in her chest. Her fingers trembled as she read it again. She could practically hear his voice in the text, that cool, arrogant tone that told her he was used to getting exactly what he wanted.¬†¬†

For a moment, she considered deleting the message, pretending it never existed. But instead, she sank onto the edge of her bed, clutching her phone tightly.¬†¬†

Fifteen thousand dollars.¬†¬†

Her mind raced with possibilities. She could finally afford to leave Willowcrest, start fresh.¬†

But then the image of Alexander Blackwell‚Äôs smirk¬†flashed in her mind, and anger bubbled to the surface.¬†¬†

Three days

# The Blackwells

The Blackwell mansion loomed like a dark, silent predator as Alex walks up the marble steps and pushed through the heavy doors.¬†

The house was grand‚Äîbut it felt nothing like a home.¬†

Dinner here wasn‚Äôt about family bonding; it was a calculated performance, one Alex hated but endured because his mother and brother were involved. The only two people who ground him to this dysfunctional circus. Well‚Ä¶ them, and Zoe.¬†¬†

He walked into the dining room, his steps echoing against the polished floors. His family was already seated, the tension visible before a single word was spoken.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs this nonsense I hear about you and Zoe?‚Äù his father, Charles Blackwell, demanded without so much as looking up. His tone was sharp and cold, like a blade slicing through the air.¬†¬†

Alex didn‚Äôt falter, didn‚Äôt blink. He slid into his seat with a practiced ease, his face carefully neutral. ‚ÄúGood evening, Father,‚Äù he replied smoothly, ignoring the obvious jab.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDid you ice that cut, darling?‚Äù His mother, Esther, leaned forward, her soft features tight with concern. Her gaze flicked to the small wound on his temple from his most recent underground fight.¬†¬†

Alex waved her off. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, Mother.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you let a rookie do that to you,‚Äù Charles sneered, his voice filled with disdain.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI won, Father,‚Äù Alex said, his voice edged with amusement. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what matters, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù¬†¬†

Charles‚Äôs lips curled into a snarl. ‚ÄúYou think this is a joke? I told you to postpone your fights for the week. Investors are flying in tomorrow, and you‚Äôre moving around, looking like some street thug. Do you realize the stakes? We could lose millions!‚Äù¬†¬†

Alex leaned back in his chair, completely unfazed. ‚ÄúAnd yet I made sweet money last night from fighting. Your priorities are not mine, Father.‚Äù¬†¬†

Charles‚Äôs gaze darkened. Without warning, he grabbed Julian‚Äôs wrist and slammed it onto the table.¬†¬†

Alex stiffened.¬†¬†

Julian, his older brother, winced, his lips trembling as he fought to suppress any sound of pain. Alex‚Äôs stomach twisted as he watched the familiar scene unfold.¬†¬†

Charles Blackwell wasn‚Äôt a father. He was a tyrant, a monster! A manipulator who thrived on power and control, and when Alex pushed his limits, it was always Julian or his mother who bore the brunt of his wrath.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDo you think this is a game, Alexander?‚Äù Charles hissed, pressing harder on Julian‚Äôs hand.¬†¬†

Julian‚Äôs eyes were shut tight, his breath uneven, but he didn‚Äôt cry out. He never did.¬†

Once, Julian had been Alex‚Äôs hero‚Äîthe older brother who could do no wrong. Now he was a shadow of that man, a hollowed-out shell who survived on drugs.‚Äô¬†¬†

Alex‚Äôs jaw clenched, rage boiling beneath the surface. His mother‚Äôs wide, pleading eyes locked on him, silently begging him to do something.¬†¬†

Alex forced himself to keep his tone calm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll handle the investors,‚Äù he said, his words precise and deliberate. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt affect the meeting. You‚Äôll get the contract.‚Äù¬†¬†

Charles finally let go of Julian‚Äôs hand, leaning back in his chair with a satisfied smirk. ‚ÄúGood. That‚Äôs what I like to hear.‚Äù¬†¬†

Julian pulled his hand back quickly, cradling it under the table. His face was pale, but he didn‚Äôt say a word.¬†¬†

Alex wanted to slam his fist through the table, but he didn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs what Charles wanted‚Äîto provoke him, to control him.¬†¬†

Instead, Alex picked up his phone and scrolled aimlessly, pretending to care about the plate of food in front of him.¬†¬†

‚ÄúFix whatever mess you‚Äôve made with Zoe,‚Äù Charles added, his tone icy. ‚ÄúHer father and I are already discussing the wedding date. I won‚Äôt have your antics ruining our alliance.‚Äù¬†¬†

Alex smirked, though it didn‚Äôt reach his eyes. ‚ÄúOf course, Father,‚Äù he said, not looking up. He couldn‚Äôt exactly tell Charles the truth‚Äù¬†

His mind drift to that server girl¬†

Turner‚Äîthe fiery server girl who‚Äôd told him off at the bus stop. He hated to admit it, but her rejection had stung. Most people in Willowcrest would‚Äôve jumped at his offer, yet she‚Äôd turned him down without a second thought.¬†¬†

Something about her had gotten under his skin.¬†¬†

‚ÄúDid you hear me, Alexander?‚Äù Charles barked, snapping him out of his thoughts.¬†¬†

Alex slipped his phone into his pocket and stood abruptly. ‚ÄúLoud and clear, Father. Enjoy your dinner, Blackwells.‚Äù¬†¬†

Without another word, he strode out of the dining room.¬†¬†

The cold night air hit him like a slap as he stepped outside. He leaned against his sleek car, running a hand through his hair. He needed to cool off.¬†¬†

His phone buzzed in his pocket.¬†¬†

Pulling it out, he glanced at the screen, his heart drops. It was a text message, and it was from Turner.¬†¬†

‚ÄòI‚Äôll do it.‚Äô

Alex stared at the message, his heart thudding in his chest. For a moment, he didn‚Äôt move, didn‚Äôt breathe.¬†¬†

He loves challenges but getting entangled with a Turner is a challenge he had no interest in taking part in.

He wished she had said no.

# Let The Game Begin

The balcony of the Blackwell Grand Hotel overlooked a city alive with wealth, secrets, and power plays. Alex stood with a glass of wine in hand, the chilled night air brushing against his skin. Beside him, Zoe leaned in, her arms draped around his waist as if she were staking a claim.¬†¬†

""How long do you plan on playing this game?"" He asked.

Zoe chuckled softly, her lips brushing against his ear. ""It's getting very interesting, Alexander. Don‚Äôt ruin the fun.""¬†¬†

He hummed, neither agreeing nor disagreeing, his eyes fixed on the horizon. His thoughts drifted to the server girl.

""I can‚Äôt believe she agreed so quickly,"" Zoe said, breaking into his thoughts.¬†¬†

""I told you, she's a Turner,"" Alex replied, his tone dismissive.¬†¬†

Zoe tilted her head, her blonde hair cascading over her shoulder as she studied him. ""Seriously, babe, bribing her with money should be considered cheating. Where‚Äôs the challenge in that?""¬†¬†

Alex turned his head slightly, giving her a sharp glance. ""No rules against it, Zoe. And what did you expect? That I‚Äôd sweet-talk her into a date? Casual conversation with her is painful enough. I offered what Turners are slaves to‚Äîthe one thing they respond to."" His lips curled into a smirk. ""And like the perfect bait, she took it.""¬†¬†

Zoe shivered, but not from the cold. Her smile widened, her eyes glittering with mischief. ""God, babe, your hatred for them gives me chills. I mean, I get it. You should hate them, but... it‚Äôs not like the whole family wronged you. Her brother was the only one who got involved with Julian.""¬†¬†

Alex‚Äôs expression hardened, his sharp jawline tightening. His voice was cold and deliberate. ""And what is her brother, Zoe?""¬†¬†

""A Turner,"" she whispered with a wicked smile, clearly pleased with his reaction. ""But babe, I have to admit‚Äîwatching you squirm every time you talk about her makes this game so much more entertaining. Your pain and discomfort? Pure gold.""¬†¬†

Alex didn‚Äôt respond. He drained the rest of his wine and turned his gaze back to the city, his thoughts darker than the night sky.¬†¬†

‚Äî

Mia stood behind the bar at Casa Lounge, wiping down glasses and trying to ignore the twisting in her stomach. It had been two days since she‚Äôd last seen Alexander Blackwell, and she wasn‚Äôt sure if the relief or disappointment was stronger.

His message still lingered in her mind, taunting her.

Three dates. Five thousand per date.

It wasn‚Äôt normal. Nothing about it was normal. What kind of man paid that much money for a date? Who even pays for a date?

She paused mid-wipe, her reflection in the glass catching her attention. She didn‚Äôt need this kind of chaos in her life.

The door to Casa Lounge swung open. Mia turned her head and froze.

Alexander Blackwell

He wasn‚Äôt alone. His two friends, Lucas and Sam, flanked him, laughing at something she couldn‚Äôt hear. But Alex‚Äôs gaze was locked on her the moment he entered the bar.

Mia felt her heart lurch in her chest, and her hands gripped the counter to keep herself steady. She couldn‚Äôt move. She couldn‚Äôt look away. He was walking toward her, his dark, commanding presence drawing the eyes of everyone in the lounge.

Her throat went dry as he closed the distance between them.

‚ÄúTomorrow after work,‚Äù Alex said, his voice low and smooth. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pick you up.‚Äù

That was it. No explanation, no pleasantries. Just a statement delivered with absolute confidence.

Before Mia could find her voice, he turned and walked to the back corner of the lounge, where his friends were already settling into a booth.

Mia exhaled sharply, her grip on the counter tightening. Her knees felt like jelly, and she was sure her face was flushed.

‚ÄúWhat was that about?‚Äù Emily, her coworker, whispered from behind her, nudging her with an elbow.

‚ÄúNothing,‚Äù Mia said quickly, her voice shaky.

Emily raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúNothing? That was Alexander Blackwell. He doesn‚Äôt just walk up to people, Mia.‚Äù

‚ÄúDrop it,‚Äù Mia muttered, focusing on the glass in her hand. But her heart was pounding so hard it felt like it might leap out of her chest.

She glanced over at the booth where Alex sat with his friends. He didn‚Äôt look her way again, laughing at something his friend had said, but she couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that he was completely aware of her every move.

Isla

They say ghosts don‚Äôt exist, but they‚Äôve never been blindsided by one in a designer suit and Italian leather shoes.

I was running late for the Monday morning meeting‚Äîhalf-asleep, clutching my lukewarm coffee, and praying no one noticed the stain on my blouse from Leo‚Äôs jelly toast attack. I slid into my chair just as our CEO, Mike, cleared his throat.

‚ÄúWe have a new majority shareholder,‚Äù he began, eyes darting nervously around the boardroom. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôll be overseeing operations personally. Please give a warm welcome to‚Äî‚Äù

The door opened. I looked up. And my heart stopped.

He stepped into the room like he owned it‚Äîwhich, technically, he now did.

Lucien Wolfe.

Only I didn‚Äôt know him as that. Not five years ago. Back then, I only knew him as Luke‚Äîthe man who kissed me under a Tuscan sunset, who made me laugh like I hadn‚Äôt in years, who vanished without warning and took my heart with him.

The same man who had no idea he left me with something far more permanent than heartbreak.

I gripped the edge of the conference table, my nails biting into the wood. He looked different‚Äîtaller somehow, broader, sharper around the edges. His dark hair was slicked back now, his jaw tighter, his expression like chiseled ice.

But his eyes.

God, those eyes.

Grey. Cold. Calculating.

And still the most beautiful thing I‚Äôd ever seen.

He scanned the room with all the warmth of a panther selecting prey. And then‚Äîhe saw me.

Our eyes locked. A flicker of something crossed his face‚Äîconfusion, maybe? Recognition? But it vanished before I could name it.

‚ÄúThank you, Mike,‚Äù Lucien said smoothly, his voice deeper than I remembered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not here to shake things up‚Ä¶ yet. I‚Äôm just observing. Continue.‚Äù

He sat at the head of the table, precisely where he belonged. Alpha. Untouchable.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

My mind screamed. Does he remember me? But he didn‚Äôt say a word. Didn‚Äôt falter. Didn‚Äôt even blink.

I forced myself to sit still through the rest of the meeting, though I heard none of it. The walls felt like they were closing in. The room was too hot, too bright. Or maybe that was just my panic setting in.

The moment Mike dismissed us, I bolted‚Äîtoo fast, too obvious, but I didn‚Äôt care.

I made it to the hallway, half-jogging toward the elevator, willing the doors to open faster.

‚ÄúIsla.‚Äù

I froze.

His voice was behind me‚Äîquiet, commanding, impossible to ignore.

Slowly, I turned. Lucien stood just a few feet away, hands in his pockets, watching me like he was trying to place a dream from a lifetime ago.

‚ÄúYou look‚Ä¶ familiar,‚Äù he said, head tilting slightly. ‚ÄúHave we met?‚Äù

I swallowed. ‚ÄúI‚ÄîI don‚Äôt think so.‚Äù

He studied me longer, and I felt like I was being dissected under a microscope. ‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù

‚ÄúPositive,‚Äù I lied.

He stepped closer. Not threatening. Not unkind. Just‚Ä¶ intense. ‚ÄúHmm. Maybe I‚Äôm mistaken.‚Äù

You are. Please be mistaken. Please walk away.

But he didn‚Äôt. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

I hesitated. ‚ÄúIsla. Isla Monroe.‚Äù

He said it quietly, testing the sound of it on his tongue. ‚ÄúIsla.‚Äù

The elevator chimed. I turned and stepped inside, desperate for escape.

As the doors closed, I met his gaze one last time.

Those eyes. That face. That past I‚Äôd buried deep.

And the secret I had never told a soul.

I made it to the bathroom before I broke.

Locking myself in the furthest stall, I sat down and pressed a hand to my mouth to muffle the sob that escaped.

Lucien Wolfe. Billionaire. CEO. Tech titan. My son‚Äôs father.

How was this happening?

Five years. I‚Äôd told myself a thousand times I would never see him again. That what we had was just a summer illusion. That he probably wasn‚Äôt even real.

But now he was here. Flesh and blood. Standing in my office.

And I had a son with his eyes and no idea how to fix this.

That night, I tucked Leo into bed and sat beside him as he drifted to sleep. His tiny hand clutched my fingers, his lashes long and dark against his cheeks. He was the only good thing that had come from that heartbreak.

He didn‚Äôt know who his father was. I‚Äôd never spoken his name. How could I, when I didn‚Äôt know who Lucien Wolfe really was until recently‚Äîuntil his face started popping up in Forbes articles and tech magazines?

I‚Äôd thought about reaching out. A hundred times. A thousand.

But how do you explain to the richest man in the country that you had his child and never told him?

And how do you admit that you were scared? That you didn‚Äôt know if he‚Äôd want the baby, or hate you for keeping it?

Now the choice was being ripped from my hands.

He was here.

And the past I‚Äôd worked so hard to bury was clawing its way to the surface.

# Chapter 2

Lucien

She looked at me like I was a ghost.

It wasn‚Äôt the usual reaction I got when walking into a room‚Äîfear, awe, admiration, maybe a hint of jealousy. People read the name Lucien Wolfe and either scrambled to impress or to hide. I was used to being the one in control, the one others studied like a predator in the wild. But this‚Ä¶ this was different.

Her expression hit me like a cold wave‚Äîeyes wide, skin pale, breath caught in her throat.

And for the life of me, I couldn‚Äôt figure out why.

Isla Monroe.

The name lingered in my mind long after the meeting ended. Her voice echoed too‚Äîsoft, poised, but trembling at the edges, like she was trying to hold herself together. I knew I‚Äôd seen her before. Not in a vague, have we met at some gala? kind of way. No, this was different. She struck something deep, something old. Like a song you haven‚Äôt heard in years that still makes your chest tighten, even if you don‚Äôt remember the lyrics.

But I couldn‚Äôt place her. And that infuriated me.

I‚Äôd spent years sharpening my instincts, reading people in seconds, uncovering lies with a glance. I could dissect a man‚Äôs life from his handshake alone. Yet the moment I looked into her eyes, all of that precision slipped. It felt like standing on the edge of a memory I wasn‚Äôt allowed to access.

Familiar. That‚Äôs what she was.

Too familiar.

I stood at the window of my penthouse hours later, the city skyline stretched before me like a conquest. The glass walls framed a world I‚Äôd carved out with my own hands‚Äîskyscrapers that bore my mark, a legacy that had no room for fragility or emotion.

But tonight, I wasn‚Äôt thinking about stock prices or acquisition deals. I was thinking about her.

That look on her face. The way she flinched when I said her name.

Isla.

There was something in the way her lips moved. A memory that wouldn‚Äôt form completely. A moment just out of reach. I closed my eyes, trying to force clarity.

And then it came. Italy.

My hand tightened around the crystal tumbler of scotch. It had been five years, but suddenly, that summer came back in sharp flashes. A quiet village outside Florence. The smell of lemons and dust. A woman with sun-kissed skin and laughter in her voice. I‚Äôd gone by Luke then. My middle name. Trying to escape my life, my name, the headlines. A sabbatical of sorts‚Äîexcept no one really escapes who they are.

And her.

The girl who never asked who I really was. She didn‚Äôt care about Wolfe Capital or my last name. She just saw me. Luke, the man who painted awful watercolors and burned pasta. The man who held her under the stars and kissed her like the world was ending.

Could it be‚Ä¶?

No. It couldn‚Äôt be.

But the timelines matched. Her reaction matched. The way she looked at me‚Äîlike I‚Äôd shattered her.

And her eyes‚Ä¶ God, they were the same ones I remembered looking up at me beneath a Tuscan sky. I‚Äôd buried that summer under layers of ambition and steel. I told myself it didn‚Äôt mean anything, that it was just a break in the storm.

But it had meant something.

And now I couldn‚Äôt ignore the question gnawing at me.

I set the glass down with a sharp click and pulled up her employee file on my tablet. Legal consultant. Hired three years ago. Good reputation. Met deadlines. Clean record. No red flags.

Except there was a gap.

A full year missing.

Maternity leave?

The thought hit me like a brick to the chest. My jaw clenched. I opened a deeper background search‚Äîsomething the standard HR system wouldn‚Äôt show. Isla Monroe. Age 29. Born in Seattle. Moved to New York six years ago. One dependent.

Leo Monroe. Age four.

Born nine months after that summer.

I stared at the screen, unmoving. My throat dried. My ears rang like I‚Äôd been thrown into the ocean. The facts were lining up too neatly. Too painfully.

A son?

My son?

No. I was jumping to conclusions. Assumptions. Dangerous ones.

I needed proof. I needed truth. Because if she lied‚Äîif she kept my child from me‚Äîthen this wasn‚Äôt just betrayal. It was war.

I leaned against the desk, trying to breathe through the storm of thoughts crashing through my head. Four years. She‚Äôd known for four years and said nothing. What kind of woman does that? What kind of mother?

And yet‚Ä¶ part of me wasn‚Äôt angry.

Part of me was gutted.

Because I hadn‚Äôt known. I hadn‚Äôt been there for his first steps, his first words. I hadn‚Äôt even known his name until tonight.

I picked up the phone.

‚ÄúDarren,‚Äù I said, my voice low and clipped. ‚ÄúI need a quiet DNA test run. Fast. Get me something off Isla Monroe. Coffee cup, pen, anything she‚Äôs touched.‚Äù

There was a pause. ‚ÄúYou think she‚Äî?‚Äù

‚ÄúJust do it,‚Äù I snapped.

I ended the call and paced the room for what felt like hours. The scotch sat untouched. My phone buzzed with updates I ignored. None of it mattered right now. Not until I knew.

That evening, I found myself parked outside her apartment building. I hadn‚Äôt planned it. I told myself I was just in the area. That I needed air. But I didn‚Äôt move. I stayed. Watched.

She emerged just after six, bundled in a long coat, scarf wrapped tight around her neck. Her hair was tucked beneath a wool cap, and in her hand was a much smaller one‚Äîchubby fingers, a navy-blue mitten, a little boy no taller than her hip.

He laughed as they walked. Bright, wild, unfiltered joy. The kind I hadn‚Äôt felt in years.

And then‚Äîjust for a second‚Äîhe turned his head.

Our eyes met.

Grey.

Not maybe grey. Not sort-of grey.

My grey.

My mouth went dry. My chest caved in.

He looked just like me. Same bone structure. Same smirk. Same damned eyes.

I couldn‚Äôt breathe.

She hadn‚Äôt told me. She‚Äôd gone on with her life, raised a child who carried my blood, my legacy‚Äîwithout me.

He was mine.

And I‚Äôd missed everything.

# Chapter 3

Isla

The first sign that something was wrong came when I opened my fridge and found Leo‚Äôs juice box missing.

Not a big deal on its own‚Äîhe‚Äôs four and fast when he wants to be‚Äîbut the second sign came a heartbeat later. My phone buzzed on the counter with a calendar notification I didn‚Äôt set. A meeting. Noon. Private conference ‚Äì Lucien Wolfe‚Äôs office.

I hadn‚Äôt agreed to any meeting.

I stared at the screen, heart thudding. A chill slid down my spine.

This wasn‚Äôt a coincidence. Not after yesterday. Not after the look he gave me.

He knows something.

I tried to shake it off as I dressed for work, but the thought stayed rooted in my skull. I kissed Leo‚Äôs forehead before dropping him off at daycare, and the entire time he talked about dinosaurs and cookies, I felt like a bomb was ticking somewhere under my feet.

The office felt colder today. Or maybe that was just me.

Whispers followed me down the hallway. A few glances. Nothing out of the ordinary, but it felt like everyone knew. Like I‚Äôd grown a scarlet letter overnight.

I didn‚Äôt have time to think about it. At 11:58, my nerves completely unraveled.

I stood outside Lucien Wolfe‚Äôs office, staring at the massive glass doors like they might swallow me whole.

You‚Äôve survived worse, I told myself.

That was a lie.

I knocked once, then pushed the door open.

Lucien was behind his desk, sleeves rolled up, suit jacket draped over the chair. He looked up‚Äîand everything in him went still.

‚ÄúSo you did come.‚Äù

I swallowed hard. ‚ÄúYou sent a meeting invite.‚Äù

His eyes flickered. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt decline.‚Äù

I walked in cautiously, arms folded tight across my chest. ‚ÄúWhat is this about?‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt answer immediately. Instead, he reached into a drawer and pulled out a manila envelope. My stomach twisted.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like being lied to, Isla.‚Äù

He slid the envelope across the desk.

I didn‚Äôt open it. I didn‚Äôt have to.

‚ÄúI want to hear it from you,‚Äù he said softly, but there was steel under the words. ‚ÄúIs he mine?‚Äù

The air left my lungs.

My legs gave out, and I sat without meaning to, sinking into the leather chair opposite him. I stared at the envelope. At the name scrawled on the tab in neat handwriting.

Leo Monroe.

I looked up slowly, my voice a whisper. ‚ÄúYou had me followed?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI had you investigated.‚Äù

The distinction barely mattered.

I should have been angry. Maybe I was. But the truth was‚ÄîI was scared. Not of him. Not really. I was scared of what this meant. For me. For Leo. For the life I‚Äôd worked so hard to build.

‚ÄúYou had no right,‚Äù I said quietly.

He leaned forward, voice calm, but tight. ‚ÄúI had every right. You disappeared after Tuscany. No number. No last name. You cut me out. And now I find out I have a four-year-old son with my eyes and my damn DNA?‚Äù

Tears blurred my vision. I blinked them back.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know who you were, Lucien. Not really. You left without a word.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo did you,‚Äù he shot back. ‚ÄúI woke up one morning, and you were gone.‚Äù

My throat tightened. ‚ÄúBecause I saw the headline on your phone. Lucien Wolfe, heir to the WolfeTech fortune, missing from family estate. I realized everything had been a lie. You weren‚Äôt just some guy escaping the noise. You were‚Äîyou. And I was‚Ä¶ no one.‚Äù

Silence fell.

He stood, running a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúYou still should have told me.‚Äù

I stood too, suddenly angry. ‚ÄúWhat would you have done? Sent a check? Sent your lawyers to take him from me?‚Äù

His jaw clenched. ‚ÄúYou think I would take your son away?‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer.

‚ÄúOur son,‚Äù he corrected sharply. ‚ÄúYou had no right to make that decision for both of us.‚Äù

Now I was trembling. ‚ÄúI was scared. I didn‚Äôt even know if you‚Äôd care. I figured you‚Äôd deny it. Or worse‚Äîuse him as leverage if it suited you. That‚Äôs what men like you do.‚Äù

He looked like I‚Äôd slapped him.

‚ÄúMen like me.‚Äù

I regretted the words the moment they left my mouth.

Lucien‚Äôs voice lowered to something lethal. ‚ÄúYou think I don‚Äôt care? You think I‚Äôm the kind of man who‚Äôd abandon his own son? You knew me, Isla. You knew who I was before the world ever got involved.‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought I did,‚Äù I whispered.

We stared at each other, and for a moment, the walls between us cracked‚Äîjust enough for the past to slip through. I saw the man I once loved in his eyes. The man who held me by the fire in Tuscany, who kissed my shoulder and promised he wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.

He was gone now.

This man? This man was fire and storm and vengeance, wrapped in an Armani suit and a heart that had turned to stone.

‚ÄúI want to see him,‚Äù Lucien said at last, voice quieter now.

My stomach twisted. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just walk into his life. He doesn‚Äôt know you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen introduce us.‚Äù

I stared at him, panic rising. ‚ÄúLucien‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking, Isla. I‚Äôm telling you. You kept him from me once. You won‚Äôt do it again.‚Äù

1ml6zxt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1ml6zxt/scoring_revenge_in_his_teammates_bed/,Scoring Revenge: In His Teammate‚Äôs Bed,"I devoted ten years of my life to the only man I‚Äôve ever loved, my ex-fianc√©, Zane Whitmoore.

Since our eighth grade in middle school, I was always by his side. I shaped myself into the perfect woman for him.

I kept my black curls cut short, just the way he liked. I never wore makeup. I dressed in outfits he approved of because he didn‚Äôt like when other men looked at me.

For ten years, I did everything he wanted. I was going to be his wife. Everyone knew we were meant to be.

So it made no sense when, six months ago, he threw it all away.

‚ÄúWhat did you say?‚Äù My voice was barely above a whisper.

Zane stared at me across the restaurant table, his expression unreadable. I had made this reservation months ago for our ten-year anniversary.

‚ÄúI think we should break up,‚Äù he said.

I blinked. My heart pounded in my chest. ‚ÄúZane, is this supposed to be a joke? Because it‚Äôs not funny, babe.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not joking, Emilia.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, you have to be joking!‚Äù My voice rose slightly, and I glanced around. People were staring. I took a deep breath and reached for his hands across the table. My engagement ring still sat on my finger. I had never wanted to take it off. Not even now.

‚ÄúWe just started planning the wedding,‚Äù I said, keeping my voice steady. ‚ÄúI know it‚Äôs stressful, but that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been doing most of the work.‚Äù

He didn‚Äôt respond.

‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs too much, we can push it back,‚Äù I added, even though the words felt like poison. We had already delayed it for years. But if that‚Äôs what it took to keep us together, I would do it in a heartbeat. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to feel pressured.‚Äù

Zane exhaled sharply. ‚ÄúThen you don‚Äôt want me to marry you? Because that‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt want to do, Emilia.‚Äù

His words hit like a slap. My chest tightened. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt mean that.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I do.‚Äù His voice was firm. Cold. Nothing like the man I fell in love with. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt love you anymore. I haven‚Äôt for years.‚Äù

I stopped breathing.

‚ÄúI stayed because I know how much I owe you,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúBut I can‚Äôt put you over my happiness anymore.‚Äù

‚ÄúRelationships go through tough times. We just have to work‚Äî‚Äù

Zane pulled his hand from mine and ran it through his hair. He had always been handsome. He had light brown hair, golden-brown eyes, and a smile that could make anyone melt. I knew I was lucky to have him.

He could have had any girl.

But he chose me.

That had to mean something. People don‚Äôt just throw ten years away.

But he wasn‚Äôt smiling at me now. He was scowling. He stood, dusting his hand on his thigh like my touch was something dirty.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to work on anything. Not with you.‚Äù His voice was flat. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been ten years, Emmy. If we were meant to be, wouldn‚Äôt we have gotten married by now?‚Äù

The nickname stung. I stared down at my plate. ‚ÄúThe only reason we‚Äôre not married yet is because you had to focus on your career‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù His tone was sharp. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because I never saw you as someone I could marry.‚Äù

The words hit like a punch to the stomach.

‚ÄúYou might be someone‚Äôs cup of tea, but not mine, Emilia. And besides, most NHL athletes don‚Äôt get married. But you wouldn‚Äôt understand that.‚Äù

I did understand. I didn‚Äôt want to go my whole life without being someone‚Äôs wife. But for him, I would have tried.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt cause a scene, Zane. There might be reporters here.‚Äù

He chuckled. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve always been a pushover, haven‚Äôt you?‚Äù He leaned in slightly. ‚ÄúBut I did love you when we were younger. Because of that, you can keep the engagement ring. I don‚Äôt want it back.‚Äù

He turned to leave, then glanced over his shoulder. ‚ÄúOh, and we can‚Äôt live together anymore. You get that, right? I‚Äôm a free man now. I should be able to bring my hookups to my own fucking¬†

house.‚Äù

He smirked. ‚ÄúLeave the key in the flower pot.‚Äù

Then he walked away.

And just like that, he took my life with him.

# 2

It‚Äôs been six months since Zane left me.

At first, I didn‚Äôt take it well. He kicked me out, and I had nowhere to go until Tessa, my best friend, booked me the first flight to NYC and forced me to stay with her.

I spent nights crashing on her couch, crying in the bathroom when she was at work.

I ignored the little bakery ‚Äî Tessa and I named it The Whimsy Bakehouse after getting smashingly drunk one night in college and having what she called a crazy epiphany ‚Äî Zane had opened for me after he got his first NHL paycheck for weeks. I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to step inside.

Then Tessa got fed up. She called me a couch potato, said I was wasting my tears on an ‚Äòasshole jerk,‚Äô and dragged me back to work.

Unlearning ten years of habits hasn‚Äôt been easy.

Some nights, I still catch myself staring at my phone, waiting for a message that will never come. Waiting for Zane to say he made a mistake. That he wants me back.

But he never does. Not even in my dreams.

It‚Äôs Friday and I‚Äôm at the bakery. The regular season is about to start. I know because I memorised Zane‚Äôs schedule months ago. Back then, I planned my days around his, making sure we had time together.

Now, the only reason I keep up with hockey is Tessa. She‚Äôs been extra busy lately.

She‚Äôs a PR manager for the New York Titans. It was Zane‚Äôs favourite team. He had always dreamed of being drafted there. Instead, he ended up with the Chicago Blizzards.

That was a rough time for us. He was so angry about it, and I was the one he took it out on. It took everything I had to keep our relationship from falling apart.

I push the memory away and pull the second batch of cookies from the oven. Just as I set them down, the bell above the door jingles, making me smile.

The Becketts live across the street. They stop by every morning for cookies, and I always make sure to have something extra for them.

‚ÄúGood morning, Miss Carter!‚Äù Angel, their little girl, grins up at me, two front teeth missing. She holds her father‚Äôs hand, swinging it back and forth.

My heart melts. ‚ÄúGood morning, Angel. Mr Beckett. Just the two of you today?‚Äù

Mr Beckett nods, smiling. ‚ÄúMy wife gave birth yesterday. We‚Äôre here to pick up some treats for her. She specifically asked for your doughnuts.‚Äù

Mrs. Beckett had been pregnant forever, or at least, that‚Äôs how it felt. In reality, she had been pregnant for about twelve months now.

She used to sit in my bakery, watching me bake, complaining about how heavy and tired she was. All she wanted was a healthy, happy baby. The doctors said the long pregnancy was unusual but nothing to worry about.

Hearing the news now, I couldn‚Äôt contain my excitement. I let out a squeal, and Angel giggled.

‚ÄúCongratulations! I‚Äôm so happy for you!‚Äù I beamed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll grab the doughnuts right away. I also made some cupcakes! It‚Äôs almost like I knew something good was coming!‚Äù

Angel nodded enthusiastically. ‚ÄúI have a little brother now! He‚Äôs really red and not very pretty, but Mummy says all babies look like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not a very nice thing to say, Angel,‚Äù Mr. Beckett scolds gently as I quickly pack up the cupcakes, doughnuts, and a few fresh cookies for Mrs. Beckett.

‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs true!‚Äù Angel pouts, crossing her arms. She turns to me for backup. ‚ÄúMiss Carter, tell Daddy it‚Äôs true!‚Äù

I hand the treats to Mr. Beckett, then place a hand on my hip as I ruffle Angel‚Äôs hair. ‚ÄúI agree with your dad. He might be a little red, but he‚Äôs still your brother. And as his big sister, it‚Äôs your job now to protect him. Especially from people who talk about how red he is.‚Äù

Angel lets out an exaggerated huff. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs going to be so hard.‚Äù

Mr. Beckett chuckles. ‚ÄúWelcome to being a big sister.‚Äù

I smile, watching the two of them. Moments like these remind me that not all relationships fall apart. Some families actually stay happy.

But for some reason, none of my relationships ever last. No matter how much I give, it‚Äôs never enough.

I wave at the Becketts as they leave, their happiness lingering in the air like the scent of freshly baked cookies. I wanted what they had, a family that cared for each other.

But after what I did seven years ago, I knew I didn‚Äôt have a family to go back to. My parents haven‚Äôt called in months. My sister barely acknowledges my existence.

It used to hurt less when I told myself I deserved it. That this was just the price of my mistakes. And no matter how much I lost, I thought I‚Äôd always have Zane.

But I even failed at that.

I was pathetic. I couldn‚Äôt even be the kind of woman Zane wanted to marry. Everything I touched fell apart, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.

My phone rings, and a quick glance at the screen tells me it‚Äôs Tess. The tight feeling in my chest eases the moment I hear her voice.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not on my couch, are you?‚Äù she asks, her tone is so skeptical that I burst out laughing.

‚ÄúNo, Tess. I‚Äôm at the bakery. I even made you some cookies.‚Äù

Right then, the bell above the door jingles, and in walks Tessa, holding up her phone with a triumphant grin. ‚ÄúWell, thank God for small mercies.‚Äù

Tessa and I have been best friends since our freshman year of college.

It was a rough time for me, I had followed Zane to college in New York because he asked me to, but I struggled to fit in.

He never liked when I had too many friends, so I wasn‚Äôt used to having someone that wasn‚Äôt him to lean on. Then I met Tess in an art history class.

She couldn‚Äôt stand Zane, and I used to hate that about her. But for some reason, she stuck around anyway.

She‚Äôs drop dead gorgeous with platinum blonde hair, forest green eyes, and long legs that make heads turn. She‚Äôs the exact opposite of me in every way.

Her skin is freakishly pale, mine is warm brown. Her hair is pin-straight, mine is a mess of curls. She has curves in all the right places, while I‚Äôve always been insecure about my nonexistent ones. Her eyes are striking, while mine are just‚Ä¶ brown.

Compared to her, I‚Äôm a plain Jane.

And not just in looks, but in personality too. When she told Zane she was going to be a PR manager for a hockey club, he laughed in her face and said she was wasting her time.

Now she‚Äôs doing exactly what she loves, while I‚Äôm still stuck wondering what direction my life is going.

Before Zane and I started dating, I dreamed of owning an art gallery, but he thought that wasn‚Äôt good enough.

I love baking and this bakery, but sometimes

¬†I can‚Äôt help but feel like he only bought it for me to make sure I did exactly what he wanted.

Tess walks up, wraps her arms around me, and showers me with kisses, making me giggle. She‚Äôs always been so affectionate. It‚Äôs endearing.

Then I feel her slump against my back with a sigh. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never believe what happened.‚Äù

# 3

I hum softly, a small smile tugging at my lips. ‚ÄúHello to you too. You can sit down while I make the coffee. A flat white with cinnamon on top, right?‚Äù

She grins. ‚ÄúI love you, you know me so well.‚Äù She groans and slumps into a chair, resting her arm on the table and propping her head up with her hand.

I start making our coffees but glance at the clock with a frown. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just 10 AM, Tess. What are you doing here? Shouldn‚Äôt you be at work?‚Äù

She sighs loudly. ‚ÄúYes, I should. But I‚Äôm burnt out. Had to get off early.‚Äù

I raise an eyebrow as I begin kneading dough. Rush hour hits by noon, and I need to work quickly. ‚ÄúWork emergency?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen is it ever anything else? It‚Äôs not even counted as an emergency today. Usually, the whole team gives me problems, but this time, it‚Äôs just one person!‚Äù

Here we go again.

‚ÄúHis name‚Äôs... Leon, right?‚Äù I ask, trying to remember.

She raises an eyebrow at me. ‚ÄúGood try, but you should know better. I‚Äôve complained about him so much, he should be a household name by now. It‚Äôs Liam Calloway. We went to college together. Remember?‚Äù

That was new. ‚ÄúWe did?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course, we did. He was a year ahead of us. Played on the hockey team with Zane. Good Lord, Zane was soo obsessed with him. He even wanted to get drafted by the NYC Titans just because Liam did. Remember?‚Äù

Was that why Zane wanted to be chosen by NYC so badly? I rummage through my memories. I remember Zane driving me to his hockey game one day, when he didn‚Äôt want Tess to drive me, so Tess was forced to tag along with us. I think he mentioned a Liam then.

He did seem a bit obsessed.

I shake my head, and she lets out a huge sigh. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about it, that asshole‚Äôs obsession wasn‚Äôt the issue anyway.‚Äù She frowns, thinking. ‚ÄúWhat was the issue again?‚Äù

‚ÄúWork emergency.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight! That!‚Äù She huffs and starts getting worked up again. I wash my hands, grab our coffees, and put the cookies on a large plate. I walk over and hand her coffee before sitting down across from her. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs an insufferable playboy!‚Äù

I tilt my head, confused. ‚ÄúAnd... is that a problem?‚Äù

‚ÄúOrdinarily, no. It‚Äôs not the team‚Äôs concern. But he‚Äôs been way over the top lately. He‚Äôs the biggest name in hockey right now, and with the regular season coming up, he should be polishing his image, not ruining it!‚Äù

I shrug, not really getting it. I blow at my steaming coffee and take a sip. ‚ÄúBut you guys should get along, right? You knew each other in college.‚Äù

She looks at me like I‚Äôm clueless. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about his personality. If it was, it wouldn‚Äôt be a problem because he‚Äôs charming and nice. But his endorsement contracts have a morality clause. He has to stay in good standing, or he loses them. Even the club contract has the same condition. If he keeps this up, he‚Äôll lose his job.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt be that bad.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is! Even his management‚Äôs on his ass. I know he might be going through something, but this isn‚Äôt it. You know Jessica Monroe? From Confidential Family?‚Äù

At the mention of my and Tess‚Äôs favorite show, I perk up. ‚ÄúWho doesn‚Äôt?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly!‚Äù She looks furious when she adds, ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre supposed to be dating and in a happy relationship, but last night, pictures came out of him on a date with her co-star.‚Äù

My jaw drops. ‚ÄúHe cheated on THE Jessica Monroe?‚Äù

Tess grabs a cookie and chews it angrily. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I was too busy being pissed off that he was dumb enough to get photographed at such a crucial time. I didn‚Äôt even think to ask. Everyone knows Jessica Monroe! Confidential Family is the most-watched show right now. Her fans are going crazy, flaming him on social media.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, he deserves it. She‚Äôs way too hot for him anyway.‚Äù I‚Äôve never seen the guy, but Jessica‚Äôs basically a goddess. ‚ÄúWhat a scumbag.‚Äù

‚ÄúI mean, they did look really good together. Two ridiculously hot people deserve each other, I guess. And he‚Äôs not really a scumbag. He‚Äôs probably the best guy I know,‚Äù she says, grinning sheepishly. ‚ÄúAfter you, of course. Liam‚Äôs just going through something, not sure what, but I just hope he handles it more quietly.‚Äù

I nod. ‚ÄúSo, what‚Äôs the plan?‚Äù

‚ÄúEmergency PR, for now. I‚Äôm pretty sure he and her co-star weren‚Äôt actually on a date. Hell, I‚Äôm not even sure he and Jessica were really dating. It‚Äôs just what everyone assumed. He has commitment issues. We‚Äôll let it blow over, Jess will probably get asked about it during her press tour and clear it up. After that, we‚Äôll go with the serious relationship angle. Have him fake date someone less famous, and when they break up, he‚Äôll be the heartbroken playboy and a media darling again.‚Äù¬†

I can‚Äôt help but smile. Of course, she‚Äôs already thought everything through. Whenever Zane ranted, it was for advice he was never going to take. But when Tessa rants, it‚Äôs because she already knows exactly what to do, she just needs someone to listen.

I cringe slightly. I should stop thinking about him. It‚Äôs been months. He probably hasn‚Äôt thought about me once.

I‚Äôd already spent six months mourning him. It was time to let go. It wouldn‚Äôt be easy, nothing ever was, but I had to try.

‚ÄúEarth to Emmy!‚Äù Tessa sing-songs. She‚Äôs smiling, but I see the concern in her eyes. ‚ÄúI lost you for a second there. You okay?‚Äù

I‚Äôd been so distracted I didn‚Äôt even notice she‚Äôd finished eating.

I smile and reach for her hand. For a split second, I‚Äôm terrified she‚Äôll pull away and wipe it on her suit pants just like Zane did.

Like I was something dirty. Something disgusting.

But she doesn‚Äôt. Instead, she squeezes my hand, erasing the bitter memory he left behind. ‚ÄúA penny for your thoughts?‚Äù

I shake my head, hating the way my eyes sting. ‚ÄúJust thinking... it‚Äôs time. I need to move on. Once and for all.‚Äù

The tears come anyway. Tessa‚Äôs eyes are¬†

suspiciously wet when she pulls me into a hug. ‚ÄúOh my God, Em. I‚Äôm so proud of you.‚Äù

I‚Äôm moving on. I‚Äôm finally leaving my asshole ex behind.

Or at least, that was the plan.

A month later, I get a message from Zane.

It‚Äôs an invitation to his wedding.

# 4

When I first moved into Tessa‚Äôs apartment, two thoughts hit me.

One: Tessa was just as high maintenance as she‚Äôd been in college. Everything in her place screamed luxury. High-end furniture, designer d√©cor, the kind of perfectly curated space that made you wonder if people actually lived there. I was happy she had a job that let her maintain the lifestyle.

Two: Tessa‚Äôs apartment was the most comfortable place in the world to feel like shit.

Even though she had decorated a guest room just for me, I spent most of my worst nights on her couch, wrapped in an overpriced throw blanket, drinking wine straight from the bottle.

And now, as I stare at the notification on my phone, I know exactly what I need to do.

I walk into Tessa‚Äôs kitchen, grab a bottle of red wine, some expensive brand I don‚Äôt recognize, and collapse onto her couch. Popping the cork, I take a long gulp before daring to look at my phone again.

For months, I wanted this. I prayed for him to reach out. Now, it‚Äôs the last thing I need.

Calm down, Emilia. It‚Äôs probably just closure or whatever.

It‚Äôs not like one message could change anything.

I tap the notification. My stomach twists as I realize I never changed how I saved his name.

Babe¬†

Babe¬†

Babe¬†

Babe¬†

Babe¬†

I stare at the screen, heart pounding.

Zane is getting MARRIED?!

I throw back wine at a pace that makes me dizzy.

A month-long cruise? A couples-only cruise?

I take another large gulp of wine.

Of all the ways and reasons I imagined Zane reaching out to me, this was never one of them.

I'm halfway through the bottle when the tears finally come.

Ten years.

We were together for a whole decade. And in all that time, I was never enough for him. Never someone he saw as worth marrying.

But in just seven months, he‚Äôs found his bride. Someone he adores.

Someone he‚Äôs happily planning a wedding with, when I had to beg just for him to be present for ours.

Holding a month-long cruise to celebrate their love before they even get married.

I never asked for anything that extravagant. I just wanted his attention. His love.

We started dating when we were fourteen. Every adult around us said it wouldn‚Äôt last, that we were too young to know anything about love. The only person who believed in us was my brother.

Even thinking about him makes me cry even harder, so I shove the thought away. One day, I‚Äôll have to unpack that can of worms, I‚Äôd been holding it off for seven years now, but today isn‚Äôt that day.

Zane and I beat the odds. We went through high school together, then college. His teammates used to call me Mrs. Whitmoore.

Everyone around could see we were set to play the long game. Everyone but Zane, the person who was supposed to be playing on my side of the field.

The only person I truly cared about.

I never even used to care about changing my last name or wearing his ring on my finger, I just wanted to be his. Forever.

Tess once said the only reason I wanted to marry him so badly was because everyone else expected it.

Maybe she was right.

Tess is always right.

That thought hits me just as I realise I‚Äôm wasted. The wine bottle is nowhere to be found, and in my attempt to locate it, I end up rolling off the couch and onto the floor.

Groaning, I fumble for my phone, my hands are clumsy and shaking. Tessa. She‚Äôll know what to do. She always does.

The call barely rings before she picks up, her voice is warm and steady, like a lifeline. ‚ÄúHey, honeycomb. Isn‚Äôt it a little early for a wellness check?‚Äù

‚ÄúZane is getting married.‚Äù My voice comes out in a pathetic slurp as I try to peel myself off the floor.

I blink blearily around the room. Where the hell did the couch go?

I‚Äôm still searching for the couch when‚Äî

BAM!

I slam my toe against Tessa‚Äôs coffee table.

‚ÄúShit!‚Äù I curse loudly, clutching my foot like it might fall off. The pain is sharp, but my drunken brain registers it a second too late.

In my attempt to regain balance, I miscalculate completely and fall backward‚Äî

Right onto the couch I‚Äôd been looking for.

I glare at it suspiciously. I swear it wasn‚Äôt there a second ago.

I‚Äôll have to tell Tess her couch disappears from time to time.

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù Tess practically shouts into the phone. I hear muffled voices in the background before she lowers her voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm at work, but did I hear you correctly?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou did!‚Äù I announce dramatically. ‚ÄúHe sent me an invitation to his wedding. And a month long couple-only cruise before the wedding, Tess! Since I clearly can‚Äôt move on, you‚Äôll have to be my plus one.‚Äù

I cackle like a lunatic then stop abruptly.

Wait. What was I laughing at?

‚ÄúTess?‚Äù I squint at the phone. ‚ÄúYou still there?‚Äù

Her voice softens in a way that makes my stomach twist. ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm still he

re. Just‚Ä¶ stay put, okay? I‚Äôll be back from work before you know it. And stop drinking my wine, honeycomb, that shit‚Äôs expensive.‚Äù

She pauses. Long enough that I can hear the weight in her silence.

‚ÄúAnd, Em‚Ä¶ I think I have something important to tell you.‚Äù

Then the call ends.

# 5

A few hours pass, but Tess is still not back.

I wonder what she wants to tell me that‚Äôs so important.

Once I sober up, I take a shower, brush my teeth, and keep myself busy by cleaning her apartment.

I try not to think about Zane, but I can‚Äôt help it. I open the email again, staring at the invitation to his wedding and the couple-only cruise.

Then I see my name in the wrong spot.

My stomach turns, and I barely make it to the bathroom before throwing up.

Later, I do something even worse.

I Google her.

His fianc√©e is a model. Perfect. Beautiful. Everything I‚Äôm not.

Of course, he left me for someone like her.

I‚Äôm chugging water, actually following Tess‚Äôs advice for once, when she finally walks in.

Her nose scrunches as she looks around, but when her eyes land on me, she just sighs and gives a small, sad smile.

‚ÄúI thought you‚Äôd be in worse shape,‚Äù she says, settling onto the couch beside me.

I lean my head on her shoulder and hold up the water bottle. ‚ÄúIf I didn‚Äôt pull myself together, you would‚Äôve done it for me. I‚Äôve learned to pick my battles.‚Äù

‚ÄúDamn straight.‚Äù She tugs at my hair lightly. ‚ÄúWanna go out for dinner? There‚Äôs a new Thai place near my office. It‚Äôs supposed to have really good food.‚Äù

I squint at her. ‚ÄúYou hate Thai food. What‚Äôs going on?‚Äù

She laughs, and for a second, I forget how miserable I feel. She‚Äôs beautiful and effortlessly so. If I looked more like her, or like his new fianc√©e, maybe Zane would still be mine.

Tess sobers up quickly. ‚ÄúOkay, you got me. I just‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt know how to say this.‚Äù She hesitates, then looks me in the eye. ‚ÄúZane‚Äôs an asshole, Em. He never deserved you.‚Äù

I let out a bitter laugh. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve said that before.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I meant it. Do you remember when he got drafted and basically bullied you into moving to Chicago with him?‚Äù

I shake my head. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not what happened.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut it is,‚Äù she insists. ‚ÄúHe only got you that bakery because he thought he‚Äôd be drafted to New York. Remember our plan? If he didn‚Äôt, we were gonna split an apartment here. And when you told him you were staying with me, he threw a fit.‚Äù

I roll my eyes. ‚ÄúHe wasn‚Äôt throwing a fit. He was hurt.‚Äù

Tess scoffs. ‚ÄúYeah? So he had to hurt you too? Em, you didn‚Äôt even want to move. He kept you locked up in his apartment so he could keep an eye on you. I saw you twice a year, and that‚Äôs only when Chicago played New York.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not his fault. I didn‚Äôt want to leave. I didn‚Äôt want a job. I was okay relying on him‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd never seeing me? You were okay with that too?‚Äù Her voice cracks, but she masks it quickly.

I open my mouth to say something, anything at all, but she cuts me off.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not the point. The point is that I went from barely seeing you to having you around every day. When I said you could stay as long as you want, I meant it, Em. I like having you here.‚Äù

Her words hit me harder than I expect. When was the last time someone actually said they wanted me around?

Zane never did. He tolerated me, sure. But he never wanted me.

Tess takes my hands, squeezing them gently. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm kinda warming you up for something that‚Äôs gonna piss you off.‚Äù

‚ÄúWha‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúI knew Zane was getting married.‚Äù She blurts it out fast, like ripping off a bandage. ‚ÄúI found out a month ago. It‚Äôs literally my job to know this stuff. But you were already spiraling, and I knew if you found out, you‚Äôd do something so fucking stupid like beg for him back.‚Äù

I go stiff. She knew.

She‚Äôs right, of course. But if she had told me, I could‚Äôve stopped it. I could‚Äôve made him come back to me.

This is her fault.

‚ÄúThat wasn‚Äôt your choice to make.‚Äù My voice shakes with anger.

She nods. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. It wasn‚Äôt. And I‚Äôm sorry, Em. But you have to understand that if he left and moved on that fast, he was never coming back.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know that!‚Äù I yank at my hands, but she doesn‚Äôt let go. ‚ÄúLet go, Tessa.‚Äù

She shakes her head. ‚ÄúNo. Because that‚Äôs not even the thing that‚Äôs gonna make you mad.‚Äù

I stop struggling.

There‚Äôs more?

‚ÄúWhat the hell, Tessa?‚Äù

She ignores my glare and keeps going. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not coming back, Emilia. You haven‚Äôt seen their pictures together or heard how he talks about her in interviews.‚Äù

I thought the worst pain I‚Äôd ever feel was when Zane left me. I was so wrong.

Because this? This feels like my heart is caving in.

But I don‚Äôt cry. I can‚Äôt.

‚ÄúWhy are you telling me this, Tess?‚Äù My voice is barely a whisper. My head drops. I can‚Äôt even look at her. I‚Äôm too ashamed.

She squeezes my hands. ‚ÄúBecause you are worth so much more than that asshole you‚Äôve been shackled to for ten years. And if you don‚Äôt believe it, then believe this: I will never, ever lie to you, Emilia. Even if I hide the truth sometimes for your sake.‚Äù

She exhales sharply. ‚ÄúRemember when I told you about my PR strategy for that idiot player at my club?‚Äù

I nod slowly. I remember. I just don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs bringing it up now.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been going great. His image is on the rise, but we need to keep it going. You know how I said he should date a pretty girl, make him look like a future family man?‚Äù

I don‚Äôt nod this time. I hate where this is goi

ng.

Tessa hesitates, then grins way too cheerfully. ‚ÄúOn a scale of one to Hades‚Äôs asshole, how mad would you be if I said I recommended you for the job?‚Äù

# 6

On good days, I love my best friend. On really bad days, I remind myself she means well.

But today? Today is a horrible day, and I'm furious.

""Hades's asshole"" isn't even a high enough scale. I yank my hands out of hers, my anger so hot I actually consider shoving her off the couch - until I notice how close the coffee table is and wince.

I'm mad. But not mad enough to injure her. Yet.

""I can't believe you!"" I shoot up from the couch and storm toward my bedroom. Tessa is right behind me.

""You're overreacting, Em. It's not even a bad thing!""

I whip off my left slipper and hurl it at her head, but she's got baseball reflexes from years of playing catch with her dad - and dodges effortlessly.

She glares, pointing a finger at me like she's about to scold a misbehaving puppy. ""Give me one valid reason why you're mad, and I'll back off.""

I hate when she does this. Puts me on the spot, makes my brain short-circuit, then steamrolls me into agreeing with her. ""I just broke up with Zane!""

""Access denied."" She starts ticking off her fingers. ""One, he's a fucker. Two, you're supposed to be moving on. Three, he's getting married and literally invited you to his wedding. On a goddamn cruise.""

She crosses her arms, staring at me like I'm the one making decisions for her. ""Emilia Janice Carter. You can't be serious.""

I launch my second slipper at her, and this time, it lands - right on her shoulder.

""You do not call me that!"" I fume. ""And it's the principle of the thing! You're always going on about how controlling Zane is, but you're just as bad! You should have told me he was engaged. It wasn't your place to keep it from me, and you should've asked before signing me up for anything!""

""Don't you dare guilt-trip me."" She's fuming now too. ""I didn't sign you up for shit, I suggested something. And do not compare me to that good-for-nothing lowlife.""

She takes a breath, then pins me with a look so serious I can't look away. ""Pray tell, what's your plan? He's hosting a month-long wedding cruise. I know you. You'll never reject the invite. You'll go, torture yourself, then come home and expect me to pick up the pieces.""

I press my lips together. I have nothing to say.

She exhales, like she knew she'd win this argument. ""I'm not going with you. But if you agree to my idea - because I'd never force you into anything - then not only will you have a date the entire trip, but you'll get to rub it in his smug, asshole of a face.""

She leans in, eyes gleaming. ""Just imagine it, Em. His ex-fianc√©e... dating his favourite hockey player.""

I didn't need to be a PR manager -or a mind reader - to know how this looked.

Zane was obsessed with Liam Calloway. That much, I remember. Back in college, he once refused to let me sit in the front seat of his car because Liam had been there a few hours ago, and he didn't want me ""messing up his good luck charm.""

I thought he was joking and got in anyway. We had a massive fight. Then his team lost the game, and he lost it on me, yelling about how he ""couldn't have a girl that couldn't fucking listen.""

The memory makes my mouth taste bitter. I remember crying to Tess, wondering why he didn't just date Liam if he meant so much to him.

Tess watches me closely, still grinning mischievously, but I can tell she's still really pissed. Just barely keeping it together. Then, without another word, she turns and heads to her room. Probably to cool off, and it's probably for the best, too. If she stayed, we'd just start fighting again.

She pauses in the doorway. ""Think about it all you want, but I'm having dinner with Liam tonight. It's at that Thai place I mentioned."" She glances at me. ""Not pressuring you or anything, but if you're okay with it, this could be your first official date in the public eye. I can tell Liam to ditch the sunglasses and facemask. Dress up. But only if it's what you want, 'kay?""

Her eyes soften, like she sees something in my face I don't even realise I'm showing. ""I love you, Emilia. Even if it doesn't feel like it sometimes.""

Then she disappears into her room, shutting the door softly behind her.

And finally, for the first time today, I can breathe.

\_\_\_\_

I've never been good at makeup. I pull up a YouTube tutorial on mascara and nearly melt into my bed.

I can count on one of Tessa's perfectly manicured hands the number of times I've worn it at all - and only on secret outings with her, ones Zane never knew about. She'd sit me down, tilt my chin up, and ""pretty me up,"" as she called it. I know I could knock on her door right now, ask for help, and erase all the tension between us. But I don't want to. Not yet.

Zane hated when I wore makeup. Sometimes, he'd yell just for finding a tube of lip gloss in my purse.

I shake my head. That's a pathetic excuse for not even knowing how to put on mascara. I remember the look Tess gave me the first time I told her I avoided it because of him.

Now, I'm sitting on my bed, wearing the prettiest dress I own, it's a gorgeous white one Tess bought me for my birthday last year. I add hoop earrings, then gather my curls into a simple ponytail. They shrink easily anyway, so there's no point in letting them down.

The YouTube video was easier to follow than I expected. Turns out, I already had most of the products, thanks to Tess. And when I look in the mirror, I think I did a pretty decent job.

Then, a thought creeps in. Was it worth it? All those years pretending I didn't like makeup. Pretending I didn't want to look as beautiful as the girls on social media.

I guess Zane leaving me has some perks. Now, I can do things like this without worrying if he approves.

I grab a black purse and steal one last glance at myself in the mirror. My breath catches.

I look... pretty.

My eyes burn with unshed tears.

When was the last time I liked the way I looked?

When was the last time I was allowed to care?

I open my door.

Tessa is standing outside, her hand frozen mid-air, about to knock. She¬†

sees me and stops, lips parting slightly, but she says nothing.

So I speak instead.

""I'm ready."" I lift my chin. ""I'll make that asshole regret wasting ten years of my life.""

Tessa gives me the biggest, shit eating grin ever.

I was seeking advice at the beginning of the relationship but then decided to just let it unfold. And I know most of you are gonna come at me about the age. And maybe it‚Äôs deserving at this point, but for a while it didn‚Äôt feel like there was a difference. It felt like we meet somewhere in the middle. We‚Äôve been together for about 4 months now. 

And now I‚Äôm just really confused. If you put the age aside, I feel like there‚Äôs a lot of pros and cons to my relationship. And I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs toxic at this point.

So can you look over my list and lmk what you think?

Pro: he calls me every morning to talk on the phone before work Con: he talks about the projects he‚Äôs gonna do for the day, but when I mention myself he doesn‚Äôt have anything to say.

Pro: he texts me throughout the day. Con: his form of joking around is to pick on me and call me names like fatty, dumby, etc.

Pro: we met on a video game 
Con: we can‚Äôt play them together anymore because he compares me to everyone else and tells me I suck. Even went as far as to say ‚Äúif you weren‚Äôt my girlfriend you wouldn‚Äôt be someone I‚Äôd play with because you don‚Äôt catch on quickly‚Äù

Him being mean on the game has brought me to tears many times. And yet he tells me that I always have a problem with something and complain too much.

When I‚Äôm upset he starts ‚Äúbossing‚Äù me around saying stuff like ‚Äúknock it off‚Äù or ‚Äúgo take a nap‚Äù

When he doesn‚Äôt want to deal with me he will literally ignore my calls and texts until he‚Äôs ready. But then apologizes for his previous behavior

Pro: he calls me on the phone before bed 
Con: wants to watch YouTube‚Äôs on his phone before falling asleep and literally asks me not to talk to him. There‚Äôs no substance. 

We have a long distance relationship and I saw him for the second time about a week ago and I stayed at his house. And some things were concerning to me. Like how I need a cup of coffee in the morning, and since he doesn‚Äôt drink coffee he huffed and puffed putting his pants on and walking out the door just to drive me to get one. Or when he rolled on to my side of the bed and I asked him to move over and he mumbled something under his breath and then I said excuse me? And he just rolled back over to his side.

At the beginning when we were excited we talked about moving in together one day. Like if he‚Äôs already being like that the second time meeting him I don‚Äôt think moving in together would ever be a good idea. I‚Äôm starting to fear that idea. Especially since I would have to move states. 

And I‚Äôm not really sure if this is love. But maybe I am just knit picking. What do you think?

This is your unc speaking. I have been playing these games since BF2/1942. It‚Äôs disheartening to see what I assume are the younger generations fully embracing what this franchise has become. BF6 has the same stench that began with BFV - a softness that is hard to put your finger on. We can‚Äôt have real countries - that would be too inflammatory. We need fantasy boogeymen factions. God forbid we address the elephant in the room. We can‚Äôt use real military terminology, we need squad names like ‚Äúzombie‚Äù and ‚Äúunicorn‚Äù instead of NATO phonetic alphabet.

We need to make the game ‚Äúbalanced‚Äù and ‚Äúapproachable‚Äùad nauseam. We have to play make believe that 50% of the population who doesn‚Äôt serve in combat roles will be serving in combat roles in 2027 when the game takes place. We need to ensure that the voices of said people will be heard on coms and in game. The whole game feels like you ordered a black coffee and you watched them dump your coffee into a gallon of oatmilk before handing it to you, before gaslighting you about what you ordered. You didn‚Äôt improve on BF4, you just castrated BF4, and gave it cosmetic surgery. You made a safe, androgynous , amorphous, flavorless game. But it‚Äôs okay guys!

I worked from **February to August 2025** at both the Printers Row and Logan Square locations.

On my second day, I heard the caf√©‚Äôs owner, **Kate Vrijmoet**, publicly speak in an interview about her commitment to inclusivity, community care, and creating a safe space for pregnant workers. I believed in that vision and joined wholeheartedly.

What I personally experienced, however, was very different: actions and conditions that I believe violated labor law, discriminated against me, and caused harm. The following is my firsthand account.

# 1. Discriminatory and Spiritually Invasive Comments

In my experience, Kate made remarks I found deeply inappropriate, such as:

* Suggesting I might be autistic and dyslexic and pressuring me to disclose conditions I do not have, saying they were ‚Äúlegally obligated to be shared.‚Äù
* Telling me she believed I was her reincarnated aborted daughter.
* Predicting my unborn baby would be born with Down syndrome and calling that ‚Äúmy greatest joy.‚Äù

These statements felt invasive, destabilizing, and out of place in a workplace setting.

# 2. Pregnancy Discrimination and Denial of Accommodations

After I disclosed my pregnancy, I formally requested rest breaks, modified duties, and flexibility for prenatal care.

* HR approved these through mid-September.
* Kate told me, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt get accommodations without a doctor‚Äôs note.‚Äù My understanding of Illinois law is that this is not required.
* During a miscarriage lasting six weeks (confirmed by my doctor), I was still assigned heavy inventory, cleaning, and bar shifts while visibly unwell. I received only one day off during this time.
* I was later informed that Kate sought legal advice about having me sign an NDA related to the miscarriage.

# 3. Retaliation for Raising Concerns

After I raised concerns about accommodations and potential legal violations:

* My job was posted online while I was on sick leave for three days due to food poisoning.
* I was told I was ‚Äúa liability‚Äù and compared to a previous kitchen manager in a negative way.
* I was pressured to ‚Äúforgive her‚Äù or consider ‚Äútransitioning out.‚Äù
* She told me that if I couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúmove past this,‚Äù we would need to discuss my exit from the company.

# 4. Hostile Meeting on August 7

During a meeting on August 7:

* Kate met with me upstairs without allowing my chosen witness to attend, instead selecting another employee of her choosing.
* She told me to ‚Äúfix my face‚Äù and accused me of being disrespectful.
* She asked me to leave the premises while I was pregnant and visibly in distress, and said that if she messaged me about work, I would be required to respond even though I had voluntarily clocked out.
* She initially would not confirm I‚Äôd be paid for the rest of my shift. She said I would be paid only if I stayed clocked in, which would also obligate me to respond to her messages.
* She told me to wait off-premises while arranging transportation.

Illinois is a one-party consent state. I legally recorded this conversation and have a third-party witness. The transcript has been provided to HR and legal authorities.

# 5. Cultural, Racial, and Psychological Harm

As a woman of color, I raised concerns about:

* What I and others perceived as an infantilizing ‚ÄúTraining Treats‚Äù system (staff, many of whom were POC and LGBTQ+, received a treat after completing a task).
* Mandatory ‚Äúworking agreements‚Äù and ‚Äúchecking assumptions,‚Äù which I felt were used in ways that discouraged open discussion.

When I raised these concerns collectively with coworkers, I was told that group complaints were not permitted and that issues must be addressed directly to Kate.

# 6. Termination vs. Resignation

In my final week, I told leadership I intended to resign.

* Before I could submit my resignation, Kate began termination steps.
* My access to work systems was removed.
* Private security escorted me from the premises.
* I submitted my resignation by text at 1:03 PM. Kate later attempted to classify my departure as a termination, which could affect unemployment eligibility.

# 7. Exposure to Explicit Materials at Work

While employed there, I and others encountered:

* Pornographic magazines in shared work areas.

I worked from **February to August 2025** at both the Printers Row and Logan Square locations.

On my second day, I heard the caf√©‚Äôs owner, **Kate Vrijmoet**, publicly speak in an interview about her commitment to inclusivity, community care, and creating a safe space for pregnant workers. I believed in that vision and joined wholeheartedly.

What I personally experienced, however, was very different: actions and conditions that I believe violated labor law, discriminated against me, and caused harm. The following is my firsthand account.

# 1. Discriminatory and Spiritually Invasive Comments

In my experience, Kate made remarks I found deeply inappropriate, such as:

* Suggesting I might be autistic and dyslexic and pressuring me to disclose conditions I do not have, saying they were ‚Äúlegally obligated to be shared.‚Äù
* Telling me she believed I was her reincarnated aborted daughter.
* Predicting my unborn baby would be born with Down syndrome and calling that ‚Äúmy greatest joy.‚Äù

These statements felt invasive, destabilizing, and out of place in a workplace setting.

# 2. Pregnancy Discrimination and Denial of Accommodations

After I disclosed my pregnancy, I formally requested rest breaks, modified duties, and flexibility for prenatal care.

* HR approved these through mid-September.
* Kate told me, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt get accommodations without a doctor‚Äôs note.‚Äù My understanding of Illinois law is that this is not required.
* During a miscarriage lasting six weeks (confirmed by my doctor), I was still assigned heavy inventory, cleaning, and bar shifts while visibly unwell. I received only one day off during this time.
* I was later informed that Kate sought legal advice about having me sign an NDA related to the miscarriage.

# 3. Retaliation for Raising Concerns

After I raised concerns about accommodations and potential legal violations:

* My job was posted online while I was on sick leave for three days due to food poisoning.
* I was told I was ‚Äúa liability‚Äù and compared to a previous kitchen manager in a negative way.
* I was pressured to ‚Äúforgive her‚Äù or consider ‚Äútransitioning out.‚Äù
* She told me that if I couldn‚Äôt ‚Äúmove past this,‚Äù we would need to discuss my exit from the company.

# 4. Hostile Meeting on August 7

During a meeting on August 7:

* Kate met with me upstairs without allowing my chosen witness to attend, instead selecting another employee of her choosing.
* She told me to ‚Äúfix my face‚Äù and accused me of being disrespectful.
* She asked me to leave the premises while I was pregnant and visibly in distress, and said that if she messaged me about work, I would be required to respond even though I had voluntarily clocked out.
* She initially would not confirm I‚Äôd be paid for the rest of my shift. She said I would be paid only if I stayed clocked in, which would also obligate me to respond to her messages.
* She told me to wait off-premises while arranging transportation.

Illinois is a one-party consent state. I legally recorded this conversation and have a third-party witness. The transcript has been provided to HR and legal authorities.

# 5. Cultural, Racial, and Psychological Harm

As a woman of color, I raised concerns about:

* What I and others perceived as an infantilizing ‚ÄúTraining Treats‚Äù system (staff, many of whom were POC and LGBTQ+, received a treat after completing a task).
* Mandatory ‚Äúworking agreements‚Äù and ‚Äúchecking assumptions,‚Äù which I felt were used in ways that discouraged open discussion.

When I raised these concerns collectively with coworkers, I was told that group complaints were not permitted and that issues must be addressed directly to Kate.

# 6. Termination vs. Resignation

In my final week, I told leadership I intended to resign.

* Before I could submit my resignation, Kate began termination steps.
* My access to work systems was removed.
* Private security escorted me from the premises.
* I submitted my resignation by text at 1:03 PM. Kate later attempted to classify my departure as a termination, which could affect unemployment eligibility.

# 7. Exposure to Explicit Materials at Work

While employed there, I and others encountered:

* Pornographic magazines in shared work areas.
* Graphic sexual artwork by Kate (including depictions of women performing oral sex) stored in supply boxes used for caf√© signage.
* No advance warning or consent was given before placing these materials in common spaces.

Mo tumbled out of the portal with a soggy thump‚Äîimagine a disgruntled cat spitting up a hairball‚Äîand the brief flash of light dissolved into a sharp crackle of ozone. She swore under her breath, bracing a hand on the damp ground as she eased onto her aching knees.

‚ÄúTen out of ten for that landing,‚Äù she muttered, wincing.

The stench of damp moss hung in the air, threaded with a faint metallic note‚Äî*old blood*, if she had to guess.

‚ÄúHome, sweet home,‚Äù Mo thought bitterly, eyeing the towering walls with a twist of unease. ‚ÄúSome things never change. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm happy to see these walls again.‚Äù

Around her, Blackthorn Keep loomed under a sickly red sky, its once-grand spires pointing like jagged teeth. Vines gripped the walls as if desperate to escape and finally find their freedom. Windows that weren‚Äôt broken had crooked planks nailed across them. The massive wooden doors sagged on rusted hinges, offering an awkward welcome.

Mo‚Äôs heart clenched at the sight. This wasn‚Äôt just neglect‚Äîit was deliberate. Someone had let her home fall to ruin. Her mother‚Äôs prized shadow-gardens were choked with weeds, the delicate balance of light and dark magic that sustained them clearly abandoned.

‚ÄúMother would never...‚Äù The words caught in her throat. She remembered helping tend those gardens, her mother explaining how even the darkest magic could nurture life if properly channeled. ‚ÄúWhat happened here?‚Äù

Mo brushed dirt from her hoodie and let out a low whistle.

‚ÄúSo, the place is really living its best life, huh?‚Äù

Her sneakers scraped against jagged gravel, each step echoing in the hush. She glanced down at her favorite hoodie and jeans‚Äîher usual shield of comfort‚Äînow utterly wrong for a place that felt more haunted than home. Still, at least it grounded her a bit, as if the vibe of the life she had built for herself on Earth could spread to the Keep, making Mo‚Äôs stay here tolerable.

As Mo crossed the courtyard, wiry weeds snagged at her ankles, claiming every fracture in the worn stones. In the middle, a fountain squatted in eerie silence, its gargoyles chipped and sneering as if mocking any notion of welcome. Mo ran her hand over one grotesque face, feeling only the faintest tingle of ancient magic.

‚ÄúYep, definitely not depressing at all,‚Äù Mo said. ‚ÄúWhat did you do with this place? It hasn‚Äôt been *that* long since I left.‚Äù

The gargoyle stared back, stone lips snarling. Mo knew a few like those. A bit more alive, though.

Turning away, she steadied herself. *Deep breath, Mo. This was your call.*

Several robed attendants crept out of the Keep, their cowls throwing uneasy shadows across pale faces. They almost looked dignified‚Äîuntil the one at the head tripped on a broken step and pitched forward, sprawling at Mo‚Äôs feet with a gasp. The others stood in awkward formation like they had never practiced how to greet a Dark Lady who‚Äôd rather be anywhere else.

The fallen person slowly gathered himself and raised his head, trembling slightly. Mo took a step towards him and stretched out her hand. But the man only drew back in alarm as though he was being offered a vial of poison.

She recognized each robed silhouette‚Äîfaces from her childhood, grown gaunter with time.

‚ÄúWelcome home, Lady Morgana,‚Äù croaked the one on the ground, voice shaking. ‚ÄúWelcome back to Blackthorn Keep.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, thanks, guys,‚Äù Mo said. ‚ÄúYou know, for the top-tier hospitality. Any chance you have coffee? I didn‚Äôt have time to go to work today.‚Äù

The robed figures collectively froze. An uncomfortable cough followed.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve, um, prepared the appropriate beverages,‚Äù one said, shifting uncomfortably. ‚ÄúBut we hoped you‚Äôd check your coronation schedule first. We made it very traditional, as it‚Äôs supposed to be.‚Äù

Not waiting for the robed figures any longer, Mo took a few steps toward the grand entrance.

‚ÄúOf course, that‚Äôs how it is,‚Äù muttered Mo, approaching the entrance.

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

Stepping into the great hall, Mo felt as though she‚Äôd entered a mausoleum for former glory: a crooked chandelier tottered above, its crystals lost in layers of soot; heaps of broken stone and splintered wood made each step treacherous, and the tattered banners drooping from the rafters reeked of mildew as if even the magic had begun to rot.

Mo kicked a chunk of debris aside.

‚ÄúHome sweet home,‚Äù she muttered, voice echoing in the cavernous space. She wandered deeper, the emptiness swallowing her footsteps.

After walking through a series of passageways, halls, and chambers, she finally reached the place she‚Äôd been looking for. Everything was as she remembered. But different at the same time. Even correcting for the intensity of the childhood memories, the throne room seemed subdued now. Mo wouldn‚Äôt say that the color had left it. There was never much color here. But it just‚Ä¶ dulled.

At the heart of the chamber loomed a colossal throne of ebony wood carved with serpents and gargoyles that seemed to twist under the flicker of candlelight. Mo tilted her head, studying it, and stepped closer, brushing her fingers over the surface. A thick layer of dust stuck to her fingertips, making her sneeze involuntarily.

*‚ÄúHmmmm‚Ä¶‚Äù* a voice sounded in her head.

‚ÄúYeah. You‚Äôve definitely seen better days.‚Äù

As she leaned in, a jolt of cool energy curled through her like an echo of the Keep‚Äôs former might, hinting at the dark magic once beating here. Now, it felt like a heart forced into hibernation‚Äîpowerful yet starved.

Swallowing her nerves, Mo turned around and sat on the second step from the top of the dais, hugging her knees. *Why am I here?*

The welcoming committee was finally filing into the room, unable to keep up with Mo. They hugged the furthest wall, unsure how to proceed and if it was safe to approach.

In the background, there was a constant noise. It seemed unfamiliar and entirely out of place. It surged and receded like a restless tide against jagged rocks, swelling with fury before pulling back into an uneasy lull. Yet beneath it all was a deeper, more ominous presence‚Äîlike distant thunder rolling over the horizon, a low growl of discontent that never truly faded, only gathering strength for the next crash.

But it was the sound of a faint shuffle behind her that made her jump.

She turned to see Lord Aldric Thorne‚Äîtall, polished, and radiating a vibe like he‚Äôd walked out of a gothic etiquette manual, and his condescending stare could slice steel. His white fur gleamed under the dim chandeliers of the grand hall, each strand perfectly in place, as though he‚Äôd been sculpted rather than born. And who knows, maybe that was precisely how he‚Äôd arrived in this world. It was so many centuries ago that no one could shed any light on his origin.

The golden antlers that crowned his head seemed to glow faintly, casting an ethereal halo around him. His dark robes were embroidered with so many golden sigils that he looked less like a person and more like a living, breathing manifesto of villainous propriety. His eyes, sharp and unyielding, locked onto hers, and Mo felt the weight of his gaze like a physical force pressing against her chest.

‚ÄúAh, the prodigal daughter.‚Äù While his smile was polite, his voice dripped with sarcasm. ‚ÄúI trust your time among the rabble was‚Ä¶ enlightening?‚Äù

She rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúYou have no idea.‚Äù

Aldric cleared his throat with theatrical precision.

‚ÄúWe face‚Ä¶ difficulties.‚Äù He measured each word as if he had to give a gold piece to each of them. ‚ÄúThe Keep‚Äôs resources are strained. Goblins refuse taxes. Minions want‚Ä¶ benefits. And someone cursed the kitchen bread to bite.‚Äù

‚ÄúSentient bread?‚Äù Mo repeated, every syllable loaded with disbelief. ‚ÄúGreat. I‚Äôm not even crowned yet, and this place is already at Defcon Chaos.‚Äù

Aldric gave a thin-lipped nod. ‚ÄúCrowning. Yes. There‚Äôs also one matter I have to mention regarding your coronation. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ provisional.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

Aldric pushed a scroll into her hands. ‚ÄúBy order of the High Council, you must attend the Umbra Academy. Complete the Dark Lordship Mastery program. The Shadow Cabinet agrees with that decision. Only then is your coronation‚Ä¶ official.‚Äù

‚ÄúOfficial?‚Äù The word tasted like ash. But beneath Mo‚Äôs indignation, a different thought stirred. If the Council had moved this quickly to limit her authority, what else had they done? Had they engineered her parents‚Äô disappearance? Her mother had always warned her about the High Council‚Äôs shenanigans, their desire to have more control than they had over the realms.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said, surprising herself with the steel in her voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll play your game. For now.‚Äù Because if they thought sending her to Umbra would break her, they didn‚Äôt know her at all. And if there were answers about her parents‚Äô fate, she‚Äôd find them‚Äîeven if it meant pretending to be the villain they expected.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù said Aldric. But his face contorted for just a fraction of a second. What was that? He didn‚Äôt expect Mo to play this game? Did he think she‚Äôll throw another teenager tantrum?

She sighed. Alright, if he wanted a scene, she‚Äôd give him a scene. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs ridiculous! I have to pass *villain school* to officially be the Dark Lady? I never wanted it. Isn‚Äôt it supposed to be, you know, hereditary?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Aldric said, his features calming. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the tradition. But you know how it is nowadays. Bureaucracy. They hold all the power.‚Äù

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you the head of the Shadow Council?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, of course. But my hands are tied.‚Äù

Mo stood up and made those last few steps that separated her from the throne. But before she could reach it, Aldric stepped forward and placed a hand on her shoulder. There was no chance for Mo to shake it off or push against it.

‚ÄúNo-no-no,‚Äù Aldric said, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt allowed yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut who‚Äôs ruling in the absence of the Dark Lord?‚Äù asked Mo.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a prudent question,‚Äù said Aldric. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt have a good answer for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that sound in the distance?‚Äù asked Mo.

‚ÄúAh, that?‚Äù said Aldric. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs strange that you didn‚Äôt notice it when you were outside in the yard. But maybe it‚Äôs not that obvious on *that* side of the Keep.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, what is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why? It‚Äôs goblins, of course. They protest.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat!?‚Äù exclaimed Mo. ‚ÄúEven the goblins? What‚Äôs happening here? So, should we take a look?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing to lose,‚Äù said Aldric. ‚ÄúSure, why not?‚Äù

He turned and headed away from the dais. Mo, however, paused before following him and touched the throne again.

‚Äú*Grrrr‚Ä¶ Unworthy‚Ä¶ Mediocre‚Ä¶*‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the?!?‚Äù exclaimed Mo.

‚ÄúYeah, it got even grumpier since it couldn‚Äôt sense your father‚Äôs butt anymore,‚Äù said Aldric. ‚ÄúPlease, follow me. You wanted to see the goblins. The best viewing spot would be the grand balcony.‚Äù

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

A sea of green spread below the balcony. Here, finally, Mo was able to pinpoint the source of that background noise that had been following her since her arrival in the throne room. The crowd shifted slowly, as if waves of goblins were probing the walls of the Keep. Still, it didn‚Äôt feel like a siege. More like a rally. A rally with thousands of people attending it.

After a moment, Mo realized that the crowd was constantly undulating in waves, like at a football match. Somehow, they seemed synchronized with the chants that spread over the crowd.

¬†

‚Äú**NO MORE TAX! WE WON‚ÄôT RELAX!GOBLINS RISE‚ÄîWE ORGANIZE!**‚Äú

¬†

The crowd erupted in cheers and boos.

And then:

‚Äú**WE DESERVE A BETTER DEAL,OR WE‚ÄôLL MAKE THE EMPIRE KNEEL!**‚Äú

¬†

Mo looked at Aldric, her brow rising.

‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúIs there at least anything that works normally here?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù Aldric stepped back and spread his hands. ‚ÄúI guess the kitchen still makes a mean Sunday roast. When the bread isn‚Äôt biting.‚Äù

¬†

‚Äú**DARKEST LADY HEAR OUR CALL,GIVE US RIGHTS OR LET YOU FALL!**‚Äú

¬†

After the last one, the crowd hushed. The goblins finally noticed two figures on the high balcony. From within the sea of green people, a person rose, supported by the hands of the others.

‚ÄúNo more taxes!‚Äù he shouted.

‚ÄúAhhh‚Ä¶‚Äù Aldric covered his face with his palms. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Grimz, their leader. You don‚Äôt want to waste your time on him.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt seems that somebody would have to talk to him,‚Äù Mo said. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt we at least try to solve the issue? I thought that the goblin workforce is crucial for our operations?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are right,‚Äù said Aldric. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs completely unreasonable. He wants‚Ä¶‚Äù he lowered his voice to whisper as if afraid that the goblins would hear him. ‚ÄúHe wants representation!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs insane!‚Äù said Mo to Aldric. ‚ÄúHow dare he!‚Äù

She turned back to face the crowd and shouted.

‚ÄúWe will arrange a date for negotiations,‚Äù Mo shouted. ‚ÄúThis will be one of the first things I‚Äôll pursue after the coronation!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo coronation without representation!‚Äù a voice sounded from the crowd. But somehow, it was promptly hushed down and lost in the murmur.

Grimz looked directly at Mo and pointed his finger at her. A long, sharp nail made the gesture even more ominous.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait! But we aren‚Äôt going anywhere!‚Äù

Returning to the throne room, Mo massaged her temple. The crowd outside started roaring once again, shouting chants. ‚ÄúRight. So, the coronation‚Äôs a dumpster fire, the bread‚Äôs biting people, goblins are unionizing, and apparently, I need a diploma in evil.‚Äù She turned to Aldric. ‚ÄúAnything else you forgot to mention?‚Äù

In lieu of an answer, the throne decided to join the conversation once again. Its voice boomed directly into Mo‚Äôs head: *‚ÄúUnworthy.‚Äù*

Mo jumped. ‚ÄúAnd the chair just insulted me. Again.‚Äù

Aldric‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt flicker. ‚ÄúOf course, my lady. It is sentient. It can be rather‚Ä¶ opinionated.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know that!‚Äù Mo snapped.

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

This time, Mo explored the throne a bit longer. She remembered all of its minute details since early childhood. When her father sat her on his knees, and the sad, ancient thing would start whispering directly into her mind. Like it did right now.

If anything, that was a great educational tool. It made Mo face most of her fears and insecurities very early. Earlier than most of the kids have to deal with that stuff unless they have an evil stepmother or something. At least Mo didn‚Äôt have to experience *that*. Her mother and father were happily married for centuries. They weren‚Äôt without their quirks. But any family of their stance has them.

Mo traced her fingers along the throne‚Äôs carved serpents, and they seemed to slither under the dim light. She carefully stepped closer, reaching out until her palms touched the cold wood. The egotistic chair practically radiated scorn. *‚ÄúThey must be desperate,‚Äù* it thought at Mo, each word steeped in contempt.

She exhaled, trying not to snap. ‚ÄúWhat, I‚Äôm not tall enough for you? Sorry, I forgot my platform boots in the mortal realm.‚Äù

Silence thickened. The shadow councilors huddled, shooting her worried glances. While the goblins raged outside, Grimz was let into the throne room and was now standing with his hat in his hands, eyes burning with resolve. Only Aldric looked slightly amused.

At last, Mo forced a smile, feigning composure. ‚ÄúWell, apparently I have to earn the right to sit here. Fine. Challenge accepted.‚Äù

Her bravado faltered when a ceremonial relic in the corner wobbled and crashed to the floor, shrieking like a banshee. Sparks of magic flared, and a stray candle shot off a candelabra, narrowly missing a councilor‚Äôs hood.

‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúJust when I thought we‚Äôd reached peak insanity.‚Äù

A swirl of dark energy snaked around the relic, crackling ominously. One councilor yelped as a floating candle tried to set his robe on fire.

Mo‚Äôs eyes darted around the hall‚Äîa swirling, chaotic circus. She raised her hands. ‚ÄúAlright, calm down. Everyone.‚Äù

Nobody calmed down.

Amid the uproar, Mo felt an unexpected wave of determination. *So what if everything‚Äôs bonkers?* She had a choice: break down or break through.

Mo stormed up the dais, clearing her throat until her voice ricocheted off the high ceiling.

‚ÄúListen up!‚Äù she shouted. ‚ÄúI may be your brand-new Dark Lady, but guess what‚ÄîI‚Äôm on the hook for some fancy-pants villain school. And all of you have problems: goblins on strike, demonic loaf bread, haunted furniture‚Äîpick your catastrophe. So do me a favor and don‚Äôt let this fortress crumble while I‚Äôm busy earning a diploma in Evil 101, okay?‚Äù

She seized the relic, yanked it out of its crackling aura‚Äîmagic sizzling across her palm‚Äîand thunked it onto a nearby pedestal. Threads of scorching energy nipped at her hoodie, but she just hissed through clenched teeth and shook off the sparks.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not hard to fix some of these things, see?‚Äù she asked, pointing at the pedestal. ‚ÄúWe can do a million coronations if we have to. But right now, I need to make sure this place still stands by the time I graduate from Evil 101.‚Äù

Grimz lowered his hands, letting his hat almost brush the floor. ‚ÄúBut what about the taxes?‚Äù

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the deal,‚Äù Mo said, looking from Aldric to her circle of jittery councilors. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll kick off negotiations immediately, but the big fix has to wait ‚Äòtil I survive my first semester of Dark Econ. Meanwhile, you lot will be granted a tax delay. Deal?‚Äù

Grimz glared, then gave a reluctant nod. ‚ÄúThat wouldn‚Äôt solve the issue right away, m‚Äôlady,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs better than what we had. If your advisers follow your ruling.‚Äù He glowered at the group of people huddled on the other side of the hall.

‚ÄúSo, is there anything else we have to figure out before we proceed with this charade?‚Äù asked Mo. ‚ÄúI want to go through with it as soon as possible and move on to figuring out the next steps.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are things‚Ä¶‚Äù Aldric began explaining. ‚ÄúBut they can probably wait. Having an actual Dark Lord‚Ä¶ hm‚Ä¶ Lady once again would allow us to postpone at least some of the troubles. And will fix the others.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are we waiting for, then?‚Äù asked Mo. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I enjoy all of that stuff. I had a perfectly normal life before I came back here.‚Äù

One of the shadow councilors stepped forward, looking nervously at Aldric, his hands stretched before him, as he held a cushion of a deep black color. It seemed that it sucked in the light from its surroundings. For a brief moment, it felt like it became darker in the hall, which wasn‚Äôt illuminated too well in the first place. But it was the object levitating above the cushion that attracted everyone‚Äôs attention. A battered crown of white gold covered with chains of black symbols and runes. The symbol of the power of the Nightshade dynasty.

Unlike the throne, Mo couldn‚Äôt say she saw this object very often. It was delivered from the treasury only for the most significant events. Like for a coronation.

For a moment, she lost her breath and had to grasp the throne‚Äôs arm to stabilize herself. *‚ÄúWeak! Such a failure!‚Äù* Mo drew back her hand as soon as these words resonated in her mind. The reality of the moment made her eyes water, and she looked around the hall with unseeing eyes.

That was it. Mo‚Äôs parents were truly gone. It wasn‚Äôt some bizarre and cruel joke. It was happening.

The crown slowly turned and shifted over the cushion, but seemed perfectly synchronized with it otherwise. It moved with the person who brought it forward with all befitting importance. Even though Mo hadn‚Äôt visited the Keep since she was much younger, she recognized the face.

‚ÄúAh, Phineas! Or is it Lord Phineas now?‚Äù she addressed him. ‚ÄúI remember well that day when you tried to persuade me to steal those cupcakes from the kitchen, only to get caught by the cook when I declined.‚Äù

For a brief moment, Phineas had lost his concentration. In a panic, he lost his footing over one of the not-so-perfect stones of the hall‚Äôs floor and almost fell. A series of emotions reflected on his face momentarily: fear, surprise, anger. However, the crown didn‚Äôt fall. It continued levitating exactly where it was when the young man sank.

Slowly, Phineas gathered himself, recovered his stance, and continued the slow movement toward the dais. The crown picked up the same steady pace following the cushion. The assembled crowd again fell silent, gazing intently at the slowly walking figure.

As soon as Phineas reached the steps of the dais, he knelt, offering the crown high above his head. Aldric stepped down and, to everyone‚Äôs astonishment, carelessly snatched it from about the cushion. He sniffed, glancing around to make sure that everyone and everything was in place.

‚ÄúAs discussed, your coronation remains provisional until you complete the Dark Lordship Mastery program at Umbra Academy,‚Äù Aldric said.

‚Äú*This*,‚Äù he motioned with the crown, ‚Äúis only a symbol. You‚Äôll have to prove you have the power.‚Äù

Mo raised a skeptical brow. ‚ÄúSo I don‚Äôt get to rule unless I get some dark college credits?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou will rule. But your decisions will have to be confirmed by the Shadow Cabinet and checked by the High Council,‚Äù Aldric said in that too-smooth tone. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre nothing if not a stickler for tradition. We have to be sure you have the goods. And the guts to make tough decisions.‚Äù

A swirl of rage burned in Mo‚Äôs chest. She considered snapping back or possibly hurling the throne through a wall. But instead, she plastered on a thin smile. ‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll go. Umbra Academy, here I come. But when I get back, you‚Äôd better believe things are gonna change.‚Äù

Aldric‚Äôs face remained impassive. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù He crossed the distance separating him from Mo. ‚ÄúNow sit on the throne!‚Äù

‚ÄúWith the power bestowed upon me by the Shadow Cabinet, the High Council, and the Tradition of the Dark Rule,‚Äù he began to recite in a grandiose voice. ‚ÄúLady Morgana Elaris Vexaria Nyx Nightshade, you are pronounced Her Imperial Dread Sovereign, Mistress of Shadows, Warden of the Night, Dark Lady of Blackthorn Keep, Scion of the House of Nightshade, Bearer of the Cursed Seal, Chosen Heir to the Throne of Eternal Midnight.‚Äù

He placed the crown on Mo‚Äôs head and stepped back.

‚ÄúProvisionally,‚Äù he said, his eyes locked on the crown.

‚Äú*Do try not to embarrass us further,*‚Äù a voice sounded in her mind.

Mo spun in place, absorbing the sight of shattered windows, wilted banners, frazzled councilors trembling over their parchments, and a goblin ringleader practically brandishing a union contract. *This* was her legacy‚Äîan empire in free fall‚Äîand apparently, she had to salvage it after snagging a diploma in villain studies from Evil U.

‚Äú*Unworthy,*‚Äù the throne whispered, needling her pride.

She rolled her eyes and punched the throne‚Äôs back with her elbow. ‚ÄúBite me.‚Äù

1ml6kqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeApplianceHelp/comments/1ml6kqh/explore_if_the_best_coffee_machine_by_cuisinart/,Explore if the Best Coffee Machine by Cuisinart Lives Up to Hype,"**A Daily Brew with the Cuisinart DCC-1500TG**

After years of wading through mediocre coffee makers, the Cuisinart DCC-1500TG managed to capture my attention with its 12-cup capacity and sleek, modern design. I mean, who wouldn't be intrigued by a programmable coffee machine that promises both functionality and aesthetics? Setting it up in my kitchen felt like a minor upgrade to my mornings, and I couldn‚Äôt resist putting its features to the test.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed was how the modern black finish fit seamlessly into my kitchen decor. Its slightly curved shape gives it a sleek vibe that doesn't scream ""appliance overload"" on my countertop. Measuring 7.75‚ÄùD x 10.5‚ÄùW x 14.5‚ÄùH, it‚Äôs surprisingly compact for a 12-cup unit. The carafe feels sturdy yet lightweight, and the ergonomic handle made pouring coffee a smoother experience than I was used to. However, the plastic exterior does show fingerprints quite easily, which might be a minor annoyance if you're a bit of a neat freak like I am.  

**Cleaning Made Simple**  
Using a permanent nylon coffee filter has been a welcome change. I'm not constantly scrambling to buy disposable filters, which has saved money and made my wallet quite happy. Plus, the product comes with a charcoal water filter that does help with the taste of the coffee. Descaling is straightforward, and the automatic alert LED ensures that I don‚Äôt keep running it until it‚Äôs in dire need of a clean. Trust me, this little LED is a lifesaver because I used to procrastinate on cleaning my old coffee maker until the coffee started tasting... earthy.  

**Brew Performance and Flavor Quality**  
The machine isn't just about looks. Oh no. It‚Äôs fully programmable with a 24-hour timer, which means I can program it the night before and wake up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee. I‚Äôd say this feature is a game-changer for someone like me, who needs caffeine before engaging with, well, anything. The flavor? Pretty solid for a drip coffee maker. I used some high-quality ground coffee, and the result was aromatic and well-balanced. Using the Brew Pause feature to sneak that mid-brew cup was a bit of a guilty pleasure during mornings when waiting felt impossible.  

**Highlights**  
- 12-cup capacity offers plenty of coffee for group settings  
- Brew Pause gives flexibility for a quick cup early on  
- Programmable function and LCD clock for scheduling brew times  
- Charcoal water filter elevates coffee flavor  
- Permanent reusable coffee filter eliminates waste  

**Flaws**  
- The fingerprint-prone exterior might require frequent wiping  
- Warming plate keeps coffee hot for only 2 hours, which may not suffice for longer workdays  
- It‚Äôs relatively lightweight, so it doesn‚Äôt firmly anchor to the counter; there‚Äôs a slight wiggle during button pressing

**Key Benefits of This Coffee Maker**  
What really won me over were the little conveniences built into the machine. The Auto-Off feature is adjustable between 0-2 hours, so there's no need to panic about whether I accidentally left it running all day. It‚Äôs ideal for people like me who sometimes leave for work in a caffeine-induced haze.  

Another plus is how precise the LCD timer is. Setting up the machine to start brewing early in the morning almost feels like having an assistant who‚Äôs got your back‚Äîexcept they won‚Äôt ask for raises or time off.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- The instruction manual could be a bit more detailed for first-time users  
- It can be slightly noisy during the brewing cycle, which might not sit well with light sleepers  
- The design lacks cord storage, so it might appear a bit cluttered when not in use  

**Direct Competitors**  
Comparing it to other drip coffee makers on the market, the Cuisinart DCC-1500TG holds its own fairly well. Competing options like the Ninja CE251 come close in brew quality but fall behind slightly in design cohesion and ease of cleaning. While the Ninja model includes a larger capacity warming plate, it tends to be bulkier. On the flip side, budget brands like Black+Decker provide entry-level drip machines with similar capacities, yet they lack the programmability and permanent filter included here. If you‚Äôre after a good blend of style and substance, this product hits the sweet spot.  

**Affordable Quality**  
Given its numerous features‚Äîprogrammable controls, reusable filter, and modern design‚Äîthis machine offers a decent value proposition. Sure, there are cheaper models out there, but most will skimp on the design, flavor consistency, or user experience that this one delivers. I hesitate to say it‚Äôs a bargain, but I truly feel it‚Äôs worth every penny for what it brings to the table‚Äîor kitchen counter, in this case.

1ml6jim,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ml6jim/the_aliens_we_were_abducted_by_wanted_nothing/,The Aliens We Were Abducted By Wanted Nothing Else But To Torture Us. They Took My Wife‚Äôs Hair And My Blood. And We Took Their Ship.,"My wife Ruth lay on her side of the bed with one leg out from under the quilt and the dog at her feet lay like a throw rug thrown by a drunk. I could count the moth bumps on the lamp shade. The grasshoppers outside were a court of appeals that never adjourned. It was all ordinary. Ordinary as bills. Ordinary as the way the ceiling fan wobbled.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still awake,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm listening,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúTo you.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo me?‚Äù She laughed, tired. ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt saying nothing worth staying up for.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou always say something.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou going to fix the back step tomorrow?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll both break our necks if you don‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was thinking I‚Äôd fix it tonight with my mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúHoss,‚Äù she said to the dog. ‚ÄúYou hear him? He thinks he‚Äôs a witch.‚Äù

Hoss thumped his tail. He was gray about the muzzle and his breath was ruinous, like he‚Äôd been chewing wire.

‚ÄúYou been distant,‚Äù Ruth said. ‚ÄúI can feel it.‚Äú

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just tired.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is it then?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù she said. She moved closer and put a hand on my chest. ‚ÄúI have a feeling like something‚Äôs gonna break.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Texas,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEverything breaks. Fences. Trucks. People. It‚Äôs a sport.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou laugh but I‚Äôm serious.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know you are.‚Äù

She looked at me and her eyes were patient like a minister‚Äôs. ‚ÄúSay something true,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can say that in your sleep.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared then,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúOf what?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf never getting ahead. Of getting old and still counting pennies for bread.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and your pennies,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe got each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

Something changed then. I did not know what at first. It was like the night became a bell and I was the clapper. My ears rang and then the ringing dropped away and left nothing. I could see Ruth‚Äôs mouth but I could not hear Ruth. I could see Hoss raise his head and his jowls trembled with an unmade bark. The fan spun like a slow windmill in a dry field and it made no sound. The world had been moved behind glass.

‚ÄúRuth,‚Äù I said. The word was a breath. It was a fish mouthing in mud. I could not hear myself.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù she said. Her eyes went wide. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

I pressed my palms to my ears and they were useless. I shook my head hard like you shake water out of them after a swim. I swallowed. I pounded my chest and the bed shifted and the dog shot up and his nails scratched the wood but it made no noise. I thought for a moment there had been a bomb somewhere and it had made me go deaf.

‚ÄúRuth,‚Äù I said again, pleading. I waved my hands. I made the sign for can‚Äôt hear like I have seen drunks do for jokes. It was not funny.

She sat up fast and grabbed my face. ‚ÄúAre you okay? Can you hear me?‚Äù She touched my ears and looked at her fingers as if expecting blood. ‚ÄúSay something.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt hear.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean you can‚Äôt hear? Eli what do you mean?‚Äù

I turned toward the door to the hallway and I saw that the door had gone. It was not there. In its place something had been drawn and it was not black like a shadow is black. It was black like depth. A shuddering zero. It hummed but not like a sound. It hummed like a feeling in the jawbone. The air thrummed with it though the air made no noise.

‚ÄúEli,‚Äù Ruth said. ‚ÄúWhat is that? What is that?‚Äù

Hoss‚Äôs teeth were bared and you could see his throat vibrating with a world of bark that would not come and I felt panic like I had been shot through the stomach. Fear is a muscle that tells you when to run and it was telling me to run but there was nowhere to run to.

‚ÄúStay behind me,‚Äù I said.

From that dark swam two figures and they were the wrong height and they were too exact in the joints and too long in the hands. They were slick like resin left in the sun. They had no eyes or else their eyes were everywhere and when they moved the space around them creased like paper. Each held a thing like a rod. The rods were not metal but some clear substance like a strip of ice.

‚ÄúGet away,‚Äù Ruth screamed. ‚ÄúGet away from us!‚Äù

I rose and my knees were sapless. I felt small like a boy. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I said to them. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù I did not know who I begged. The dog leapt and whatever the rod was it made a net of light that caught him midair and set him gently upon the floor as if he were a baby. He went limp and his eyes rolled back.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt touch him,‚Äù I said and I knew it did not matter.

‚ÄúEli,‚Äù Ruth said. ‚ÄúEli.‚Äù

The dark behind the figures pulsed, It was like the hole of a burned out star. The rods made a gesture and something caressed my skin that was no touch and all touch. I could feel my hair rise. The room thinned around us as if the paint had been stripped off the world. The bed slid backward without moving. The walls shortened. The humming dark ate the doorway and then it ate the air and then it ate us.

When I went it was like going down into water and finding there is no bottom. The last thing I saw was Ruth‚Äôs hand reaching for mine and missing by an inch. The last thing I felt was my own name slipping off me like a jacket.

I woke on a table and the table was made of something that flexed in sympathy with my breathing. The walls were not walls, they were skin made of meteor light and cartilage. Veins of light ran in it like rivers under ice. The smell was antiseptic and sweet like flowers thrown on a grave.

My hearing came back as a hiss, like rain far away. Strange pipes, a music not meant for human ears. Then voices.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù a woman said, urgent. ‚ÄúHey. Hey, you with me? Can you hear me? Look at me.‚Äù

Her face bent over mine. Brassy hair matted with sweat. Eyes that had seen too much. A scar slicing old and white through one eyebrow. The kind of face that had not been given an easy road and did not ask for one.

‚ÄúI can hear‚Äù I said and it came out of me like gravel. ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my wife?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to figure it out,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúEli.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Darla,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an EMT. Or I was. Don‚Äôt freak out. They‚Äôve got restraints but I think they soften if you slow your breathing. You gotta help me, okay? Breathe with me.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Ruth,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúBreathe,‚Äù said another voice, male and ragged. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt waste your breath. It hurts.‚Äù

I turned. He was on another table. Brown skinned with tattoos up his forearms that bore the faces of saints and women alike. A man built for hauling iron. His belly had been shaved and covered in a cellophane sheet that writhed with a dim light of its own. Under the sheet were stitches like a child had sewn up a torn football.

‚ÄúHector,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFrom Pecos.‚Äù

‚ÄúEli,‚Äù I said, semi present to any of it. ‚ÄúRuth.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find her,‚Äù Darla said. ‚ÄúListen to me. They‚Ä¶‚Äù

A seam opened in the membrane and in came a shape like the ones from the bedroom, except this one wore something that was a garment if you were generous. It was spangled with little plates that turned dull and bright as it moved. It did not walk, it translated. Darla stiffened. Hector tried to spit and his spit crawled along the air like syrup.

The thing touched its rod to Hector‚Äôs shoulder and Hector screamed. The scream cut through me like a road flare. Then I realized I could see the scream. Threads of sound ran in the air like drawn sugar, vibrating. The thing cocked its head with a tenderness that was not human and it gathered the threads and tucked them into a little box on its chest.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do anything. Where‚Äôs my wife?‚Äù

The thing turned to me and for a moment we regarded each other. In its no face I felt a cool humor without mercy. A child‚Äôs patience for pulling wings off flies. It touched my cheek with the rod and every tooth in my mouth sang.

‚ÄúTalk to me,‚Äù Darla said, ‚ÄúCan you hear me? Stay with us. Stay with me Eli.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be good,‚Äù I said to the thing. ‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù

The second one followed the first like a shadow and it carried a case. It opened the case and in it were bright toys. Hooks like fishbone, lenses like clear coins, needles that tapered to nothing. They set a rack by my head and in the rack was a light and the light pulsed and I thought, that is an eye. They took the eye out of the rack and pressed it to my own eye and it clicked like a camera. I felt a pressure deep behind my face. I felt something thread through the sinus and into memory like a needle into cloth.

‚ÄúWhat are you doing,‚Äù Darla yelled. ‚ÄúYou parasites. You goddamn‚Ä¶‚Äù

One of them drifted to her and put its hand over her mouth and did not touch her and she gagged as if pushed under water. It turned back to me and slid a sliver of cold under my nail. The nail lifted like a door. It took a piece of me, a crescent of horn and flesh, and laid it in a dish that swallowed it with light. It worked with such idle pleasure I could not bear to look and I could not bear not to. It opened my forearm with a line so accurate that I did not feel pain until I saw my own meat parted and the coiled white of tendon shining like a new rope. I felt the blood pool and then the blood was pulled away along the surface of the table as if it had been magnetized.

‚ÄúStop,‚Äù Hector said through his teeth. ‚ÄúHey! Stop with him! I‚Äôm here! Come over here you son of a bitch! You think I scare easy?!‚Äù

The thing went to Hector and lifted the cellophane. Under it was a harvest. They had unspooled a length of his small intestine and wound it around a spindle. It steamed in the cold air. I saw the wet slick of his organs and the flare of his rage and I saw the way they were careful with him as if he were a violin they meant to keep in tune even while they destroyed it.

‚ÄúBreathe,‚Äù Darla said. ‚ÄúLook at me Eli.‚Äù

I looked at her because if I looked at them I would lose myself in the hole behind their faces. 

‚ÄúRuth,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI saw them bring a woman past,‚Äù Darla said. ‚ÄúDark hair. Small. They took her to a room with green light. She was breathing. I saw her chest move. Do you hear me? She was breathing.‚Äù

I cried then. I cried and the tears floated. The thing plucked one tear out of the air between finger and thumb and held it up to the light. I wanted to break its hand. I wanted to kiss it for not killing us outright. I wanted everything to stop.

‚ÄúWhy,‚Äù I said to it. ‚ÄúWhy.‚Äù

It tilted its head as if listening to a distant thing and a voice came like a conversation in the bones. ‚ÄúBecause you are many and we are few,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúBecause we are bored.‚Äù

They did not say it with words. The words flickered out of the light itself. Darla saw it too. She nodded once. ‚ÄúThey like to watch,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve got a schedule. They always come when that low hum starts up. You feel it?‚Äù

I nodded. I could feel it. A hallway distant and full of sorrow.

They worked on me until I shook. They took a core from my hip like a farmer takes a core from a bale to check how it cured. They wound bright threads through my tongue and stuck it to a board so I could not bite down. When I thought I would die they sealed me up again with a warm light that ran along the gash like a fly‚Äôs footstep. The pain dimmed to a red star in my periphery. Later they brought a tray and on the tray were six smooth discs. In each disc something cursorily organic moved like a fetus in a jar.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt eat anything,‚Äù Darla said.

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt planning to,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll make you,‚Äù Hector said.

They did. The disc melted on my tongue and it tasted like numbness. In the distance a green glow rose and fell like a great sleeping heart. I prayed to nothing and I prayed to everything. I did not think prayer‚Äôd ever been answered but I practiced anyway.

‚ÄúWe ain‚Äôt going to die here,‚Äù Darla said in the dark when the things had put us back together and retreated. ‚ÄúYou hear me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI hear you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou got a woman to get back to.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre scared,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm terrified.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt means the animal in you‚Äôs alive. We‚Äôll use that.‚Äù

They moved us. A membrane opened and we slid like organs into a larger body. The corridor beyond was burrowed through some tissue smooth as tongue. The lights were not lights, they were living circles that dilated as we passed. Behind the membrane were rooms like ours. In one a man sat cross legged on the floor and kept time with his hand in the air as if listening to a band only he could hear. In another a woman lay glued to the wall and her skin had grown little windows that opened and closed and showed things that were not in the room. She turned her head when she saw us and a mouth opened in her shoulder and smiled.

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt look,‚Äù Darla said. ‚ÄúKeep your eyes on me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúPretend you can.‚Äù

Hector limped. A tube trailed him and ran back to the wall like a leash to a post. He was pale as chalk under the brown of his skin. 

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù I said.

He grunted. ‚ÄúIf I say yes, will it help?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt helps me,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôm fine.‚Äù

We came into a chamber where the ceiling arched away out of knowing and the floor was a grid of bone. The bones flexed under my feet. In the center stood a tower of instruments and in the instruments was a kind of music. It spoke inside your teeth like the memory of a song your mother sang when you were small.

‚ÄúWelcome,‚Äù said the voice. It wasn‚Äôt the same as before. It was lighter. It had a curl of kindness in it. The room seemed to be speaking. Or the ship, which was the same.

‚ÄúWho are you,‚Äù Darla said.

‚ÄúDo you want my true name,‚Äù it said, ‚Äúor the shape of it?‚Äù

‚ÄúGive me the shape.‚Äù

‚ÄúWarden,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúWe have a game.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not playing,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúYou are always playing. You have been playing since you crawled out of mud.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the game?‚Äù Darla said.

‚ÄúYou move. We watch.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck your game,‚Äù Hector said. 

The walls chuckled. ‚ÄúNot bad,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúWe will set a course for you. You will try to get to the center. There is a prize there.‚Äù

‚ÄúRuth?‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúPerhaps. Perhaps something else.‚Äù

Darla looked at me. There was a steadiness in her that I wanted to borrow. ‚ÄúWe use this,‚Äù she said in a whisper. ‚ÄúWe make them give us the corridors. I saw the pods earlier. Small boats inside a bigger fish.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow do we get them to open the doors,‚Äù I said.

She looked up into the meat of the ceiling like it could hear her and she said, out loud, ‚ÄúWarden. If we play, we want tools.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat tools?‚Äù The voice was coy.

‚ÄúOur own bodies,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúYou took pieces. Give us back what we need. We need saline. We need something sharp. We need a sealant in case we get cut.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou ask for much,‚Äù the ship said.

‚ÄúYou ask for us,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFair‚Äôs fair.‚Äù

A hatch opened with a little sigh. A slab slid out like a tongue. On it a clear blade, a pouch of fluid hung from a spine of plastic, a roll of something like synthskin that smelled like cedar.

‚ÄúYou get one cycle,‚Äù the Warden said. ‚ÄúWhen the red hum lowers you will begin. Do not touch the walls when they ripple. If you do they will taste you and we will have to take you back. The prize is in the heart of the ship. Go.‚Äù

‚ÄúRuth,‚Äù I said again. I kept saying it like a spell.

‚ÄúWe have to go,‚Äù Darla said. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt wait.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Hector said to the air. ‚ÄúIf we win we all go. All four. Hear me?‚Äù His voice cracked. He put his hand to his stomach. ‚ÄúMe, the man, his woman, and the mouthy blonde.‚Äù

‚ÄúNoted,‚Äù the Warden said. ‚ÄúI like mouthy. Begin.‚Äù

The red hum fell in the bones of my jaw and the lights elongated like eyes narrowed. The far wall peeled away and there was a hallway beyond with a floor like the surface of a lake under wind. Darla took the blade. She tucked it under the sleeve of her ripped shirt. She handed me the pouch. ‚ÄúIf they throw that net on us again,‚Äù she whispered, ‚ÄúI think we can short it. That stuff looked like it sucked current. Salt carries electricity. You track?‚Äù

‚ÄúI track.‚Äù

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Hector said. He uncoiled the tube from his belly and tied it off in a knot with a face like sin. He breathed in through his nose and let it out slow. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs play.‚Äù

We ran. The first corridor went up at a gentle angle and then not gentle. I felt the gravity go sideways and I put a hand to the wall and jerked it back because the wall was slick with some secret that wanted me. Above us and below us other corridors crossed like capillaries. The ship was a living city. We passed a window and outside was a sky as black as ever and a planet so close and huge it was like a bruise laid over everything.

‚ÄúIs that Earth?‚Äù I said, breathless.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Darla said. ‚ÄúWrong color. Wrong white. Those storms aren‚Äôt ours.‚Äù

A shape came out of a side corridor to our left and I lashed out with the pouch and it might have been reflex or hope but the net came and the net hit the saline and went mad and popped like a wet fire. Hector laughed. ‚ÄúGet some,‚Äù he said, and then he swayed and gripped the rail. He spit up blood and the blood lifted from his lip and ran along the air toward the wall like a moth to a lamp.

We moved through a room where bodies hung like fruit. There were human ones and not human ones. There was a cow with its skull removed and its brain encased in a clear bell. A deer standing like a carcass frozen with snow on its muzzle and there was no snow here. A child sized thing with feathers. I shut my mind on it like a door. I could not afford pity wider than the three of us and the woman I loved.

‚ÄúStop,‚Äù Darla said.

She put her ear to a seam in the floor. ‚ÄúDo you hear that? That droning? That‚Äôs the heart room. It‚Äôs close. But there‚Äôs a lock.‚Äù She reached inside her shirt and pulled out a little chip she‚Äôd palmed earlier, white as a flake of bone. I hadn‚Äôt seen her take it. ‚ÄúThey use this shit to key doors,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey keep a lot of the keys in their own bodies. Calcium based. I told you I was an EMT. The body‚Äôs a museum of cheap tricks. You can copy any of them if you‚Äôre mean enough.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you get it,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI asked nice,‚Äù she said, and I saw the smear of alien fluid under her nails.

She slid the bonechip into a slit and the slit drank it. The lock opened like a sigh through the flesh of the ship. We stepped through and into somewhere colder.

It was a gallery. It was a cathedral. It was a long room with a spine down the middle and from that spine hung pods the size of bathtubs and in each pod something slept or pretended to sleep. The green light I had seen in a dream pulsed through the floor. The air smelled like embalming fluid and cut grass. I saw her at once. Ruth. Suspended like an angel on a stained glass window. Tubes in her arms and a crown of needlework on her head that was now bald.

‚ÄúRuth,‚Äù I said and my voice shivered. I put a hand on the clear lid and it burned cold. ‚ÄúRuth, honey. Wake up. It‚Äôs me.‚Äù

Her eyelids fluttered. She looked at me without seeing. She mouthed something. ‚ÄúWater,‚Äù I thought, and I opened the pod and my fingers stuck to it and the static leapt from me to her and she shuddered. Her eyes focused. ‚ÄúEli?‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI got you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI got you. Can you sit?‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt feel my legs,‚Äù she said, and there it was, the thing you hope not to hear. I swallowed it.

Darla was at the console like an organist in a ruined church. ‚ÄúWe have to move,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not going to let us take the prize without a price. We need the pods. You see the launch chutes? Those holes that look like a throat? They‚Äôre escape boats. Four seats if we stack.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôll chase after us,‚Äù Hector said.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be fast then,‚Äù Darla said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never lost a patient on a rig in my life. I am not starting with a goddamn spaceship.‚Äù

An alarm went off but there was no sound. The room changed color like a cut of meat going bad. The Warden sighed in the metal. ‚ÄúAh,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúClever mammals.‚Äù

‚ÄúOpen the chute,‚Äù Darla said to it. ‚ÄúOr we tear the heart out of your toy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are not capable,‚Äù the Warden said.

Hector staggered to a column that ran like a tree root from floor to ceiling. He wound both arms around it and set his feet. ‚ÄúWatch me,‚Äù he said, and he pulled. The skin of the column stretched and tore. Light leaked. The room convulsed. A siren took shape in nothing and filled everything.

‚ÄúI can do a lot of damage for a dying man,‚Äù Hector said. He bared his teeth.

‚ÄúOpen,‚Äù Darla said, knife in hand and the knife found a seam and she set it like a wedge and pried. ‚ÄúOpen, you listening bastard.‚Äù

The floor softened. A mouth yawned in it. Cold air rose. The stars flickered in the distance. I scooped Ruth up and she folded into me like a shirt pulled from a line. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre shaking,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúMe too,‚Äù she said. 

We moved. We slid the pod into the mouth and climbed in. The walls molded around us like we were pills in a blister pack. Hector collapsed into the last seat and his hand clamped on my wrist. ‚ÄúOn me,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let me go.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt,‚Äù I said.

Darla slapped the controls with a merciless efficiency. ‚ÄúThis thing runs on coded gestures,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs all it is. Geometry. Even God‚Äôs just geometry.‚Äù

‚ÄúOpen the throat,‚Äù the Warden said softly. ‚ÄúLet it swallow you. Let it spit you back where we found you, small heroes.‚Äù

‚ÄúGo to hell,‚Äù Darla said.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the plan,‚Äù said Hector.

We fell.

The pod was a seed through the veins of something larger and furious. The tube that carried us had muscular rings in it and each ring squeezed us like toothpaste. The g-forces pressed me into the shape of whoever I used to be. Ruth‚Äôs breath was in my ear and it was fast and shallow. ‚ÄúTalk to me,‚Äù she said, as if words were stitches that would hold us in one piece.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm right here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat happened,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMy legs, Eli. I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶‚Äù 

‚ÄúWe got you,‚Äù Darla said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to fix what we can damn fix and we‚Äôre going to live with what we can‚Äôt. Breathe. One, two. In. Out.‚Äù

Hector coughed something wet and sweet. I didn‚Äôt look. ‚ÄúWhen we land. We bury this thing,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe will,‚Äù I said.

In the narrowing of the tube a shape presented itself and it was not the Warden. It was one of the cold ones, a sentinel, its face slick with its own version of fear which was not like ours. It rose out of a port and set its rod on the pod and you could hear the electronics whine like flies. The wall to my left peeled back and there was void. The planet rolled slow. Its light was an old light, bread baked by a dead furnace.

‚ÄúHold her. Eli, hold her,‚Äù said Darla.

‚ÄúI am.‚Äù

Hector sat up like a resurrection and he lunged for the sentinel through the shining membrane and his fist sank to the wrist in the thing‚Äôs throat. He squeezed. A luminous liquid began to fall. It smelled like mint and dead fish. The sentinel flailed and its rod spun and struck him in the ribs and he shouted and did not let go of it‚Äôs neck. ‚ÄúI had a brother,‚Äù he said conversationally, grinning like a skull. ‚ÄúHe drowned in a drilling mud pit behind a yard in Loving County. Nobody came for him. I ain‚Äôt letting this all end with you touching me.‚Äù

He snapped something in it that sounded like brittle clay. The sentinel went slack. The pod rocked. The tube or throat closed around us in spasms. Darla jammed the blade into the seam on the controls and opened new options like veins. She made patterns in the air with her hands. ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù she said to the hardware. 

Ruth turned her face into my neck and I felt her tears hot and unashamed. ‚ÄúI thought I was alone,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúNever,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúNot once.‚Äù

The pod fell free. The tube spat us. We slipped along a skin of light that ran outside the ship like oil on water. Many little pods fell then, as if the ship was shedding fleas shaken loose by a dog‚Äôs teeth. Some lit their brakes and some did not. Those that didn‚Äôt tumbled into the black like bad thoughts, gone.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to pass out,‚Äù Hector said, good natured. He did.

‚ÄúKeep him awake,‚Äù Darla said.

‚ÄúHector,‚Äù I said, slapping his face gentle. ‚ÄúHector.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt wake up,‚Äù he said without opening his eyes, ‚Äúsay something decent at my funeral.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do decent.‚Äù

‚ÄúLie then.‚Äù

The Earth showed itself like a hurt you forgot you had. The curve of it was the shape of relief and terror in equal measure. Clouds matted the Gulf. Texas lay under there, flat and infinite, the color of bones in dust. The pod heated. The light through the windshield went from white to red to a color I can‚Äôt name. The air outside screeched with our entry like a world being given birth to itself.

‚ÄúAngle,‚Äù Darla muttered. ‚ÄúWe need an angle.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou done this before?‚Äù

‚ÄúDrove a bus through a wildfire once,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúHow different can it be.‚Äù

We hit a layer like plates slapped together and the pod juddered and rattled. Something outside tore off and went bright and was gone. Ruth‚Äôs hand found mine and seized it. ‚ÄúIf we live,‚Äù she said, ‚ÄúI want you to build that stupid step.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúPromise me.‚Äù

‚ÄúPromise.‚Äù

The pod nosed toward the place that stole us like a salmon knows the river.

We came down through the clouds. Through a night that looked familiar. A scatter of small towns like dropped embers. The highway a living snake with eyes down its length. Then the scrub and the caliche and the broken fences and the creekbed that only runs in the spring. We screamed between two cottonwoods and tore the top off one and the pod smacked dirt and skipped once and a second time, a flat pebble skimming a pond, and then lodged itself in a wash where the mesquite grows too thick even for goats.

Silence. 

The good kind. 

‚ÄúIm still here,‚Äù Darla said, surprised to find it true.

It was night and the night had our stars. The insects took up their old labor as if nothing had changed. But everything had changed and I could feel it in the pressure of the air. The sky was wrong by a hair. As if some hand had put the curtain back after peeking and left it crooked.

‚ÄúWe need to move,‚Äù Darla said. ‚ÄúWe need to get out and we need a hole and we need to bury this bitch before the county gets curious.‚Äù

‚ÄúHector,‚Äù I said.

He did not answer.

‚ÄúHector.‚Äù

I shook him. I put two fingers to his neck and there was a pulse that came and went and then decided. He opened his eyes. He smiled. 

‚ÄúYou did good,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúI always was best for lifting heavy,‚Äù he said. He tried to stand and Darla caught him.

‚ÄúThere you go,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThere you go.‚Äù

We pulled Ruth into the grass and we lay there a moment like kids who have stolen something. I looked up and I saw our house in the distance. I said home without saying it. The lights leaned east as if the word had weight. Hoss barked and this time the sound of him hit me like a hammer I‚Äôd forgone all my life and now got back with interest. I cried again. There is no shame in a man‚Äôs tears. It is simply sweat coming out of a deeper place.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre home,‚Äù Ruth said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre home.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor now,‚Äù Darla said.

The pod‚Äôs skin was cooling and making noises like a kettle. We tore brush and piled it. We dragged old boards from the shed and threw them over. We shovelled dirt as if we meant to bury a god. Our hands blistered and bled. We worked by moonlight and by the glow of a world that did not care. When the shape of it had gone under the earth like a fox we stopped and listened and heard nothing but the common darkness of this place. A train in the distance. A coyote. The wind, which is just empty miles making a sound against things.

‚ÄúWe should go inside,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúIn a bit,‚Äù said Darla. She squatted by Hector and looked at his belly. ‚ÄúThis is going to get bad if we don‚Äôt flush it.‚Äù She looked up at me. ‚ÄúThis is your home, right? Well, I‚Äôll need to use your kitchen. Boil everything that holds water.‚Äù

‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúAnd we ain‚Äôt going to a hospital.‚Äù

‚ÄúI figured.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to be our own hospital.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll right.‚Äù

Ruth reached for my hand and held it. ‚ÄúEli,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm here.‚Äù

She closed her eyes.

We carried them inside. Hoss whined and put his head on Ruth‚Äôs lap and Ruth smiled and touched his ear. He looked at her legs and he looked at me and whatever a dog believes in, he did it then. Faith has a smell to it and it was in the room.

‚ÄúGet the bleach,‚Äù Darla said. ‚ÄúGet the pressure cooker. Get a field kit if you have one.‚Äù

I moved like a man in a flood, grabbing whatever floated. I boiled water. I burned towels in the oven to get them sterile or close. Darla washed her hands in bleach and whiskey and then she opened Hector along the pale railroad track of stitches and did God‚Äôs work with a conscience like iron. He hissed and gutted out his curses and she talked to him soft as you talk to a spooked colt. ‚ÄúThere. There you go. You‚Äôre home. Don‚Äôt fight me. Breathe. Breathe.‚Äù

She reached into him and the sound was a sound that would stay in me forever. Blood slicked her forearms. She laughed once at some private sick joke. ‚ÄúYou ever seen diesel in a ditch spread like this?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs you. Goddamn miracle you‚Äôre still renting space in that body.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs funny is,‚Äù Hector said, white lipped and bright eyed, ‚ÄúI think I left part of me up there.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou left so much of you down here there ain‚Äôt room for more,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúNow shut up.‚Äù

She packed whatever was meant to be packed back where it was owed and she sealed him with duct tape and sutures like ladder rungs. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll scar,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúChicks dig it,‚Äù he said. He slept.

I pushed Ruth in the old recliner and covered her legs. She looked small. She watched me with the same look she wore when I brought home baby chicks one year in April and we sealed their heat under a red lamp. Wonder and fragility and pride. ‚ÄúYou should have left me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI slowed you.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt say that.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI slow you and I always have.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you say that again I‚Äôm going to argue with you until the sun burns out.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll get bored of me.‚Äù

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt. There‚Äôs a hole in me that matches your shape exactly. I‚Äôd rattle without you.‚Äù

She smiled then and the smile was weak but it was the same one she had when she said yes in a courthouse that cost less than the truck I drove.

We ate what there was. We wrapped Hector in blankets like a child. I went outside and stood and listened for something I could not name. The sky felt like it was peering back. I had the sudden sense that what we had carried out we had not entirely escaped. That some thought of them or parts of them had seeded in us. My hip ached where they‚Äôd cored me. My tongue felt odd where they‚Äôd stitched the thread of light.

‚ÄúDarla,‚Äù I said, coming in. ‚ÄúDo you feel weird.‚Äù

She laughed. ‚ÄúDefine weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike you got something planted in you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI feel tired,‚Äù she said. She took a sip of coffee that had burned an hour. ‚ÄúAnd I feel mean. That‚Äôs normal.‚Äù

Ruth shivered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cold,‚Äù she said, even though the house was not.

‚ÄúNeed a blanket,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúNo, like, I feel cold on the Inside.‚Äù

I went to her and I felt the tremor in her bones. It was not fear. It was a rhythm. Something that had timing. Her eyes found mine. ‚ÄúEli,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWhat.‚Äù

‚ÄúPut your ear on my chest.‚Äù

I did. I heard her heart and something under it like a clock under a floorboard. A second beat, faint. I counted. It did not match her rhythm. It lay beside it. It humored it.

‚ÄúThey left a mark,‚Äù Darla said. Her voice was equal parts awe and disgust. ‚ÄúShit. They put something in us.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor what,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúTo keep time,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúTo track us. To know when to come back.‚Äù

Hoss growled then and the hair went up along his ridge. He stared at the window. The kitchen radio sat cold on the counter and it clicked on all by itself and whispered static. In the static a voice spoke and it was not English and not language, it was geometry again, and the ice in me cracked a little.

‚ÄúGoddamn,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù Darla said, gentle. ‚ÄúWe knew. We didn‚Äôt say it but we knew.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if they come back,‚Äù Ruth said. ‚ÄúWhat if they put me back where they had me. Eli I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey won‚Äôt,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be ready.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe wasn‚Äôt ready last time.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúBut we were brave. That counts as the next best thing.‚Äù

We worked then. We took a hacksaw and cut the back step flush and set new wood and the hammer was loud and holy. We carried stones and boarded windows. We pulled the pod out of the ground enough to peel its skin and take the thing in its spine that felt like a beeper and we crushed it under a sledge hammer until it turned to grit. We wore gloves. We washed with bleach. The sun came up pale as if ashamed.

The neighbors came by. ‚ÄúYou hear that noise last night?‚Äù Earl asked. ‚ÄúSounded like the world was on fire.‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt hear nothing,‚Äù I said.

He looked at me like a man considering a riddle. He was going to make a joke. He didn‚Äôt. He looked off across the pasture. ‚ÄúWell,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI got a fence to check.‚Äù

In the bedroom where this all started, the door sat in its frame like any door. I ran my hand along the panels and felt the indentations my father‚Äôs ring had made decades ago. Ruth slept with her mouth open, worn out. I stood watch. The dog lay at my feet and snored.

Night came and I thought I would not sleep but I did. In my dream I was in the ship and the Warden spoke to me. ‚ÄúYou played well,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúEverybody is only ever playing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll come back,‚Äù I said.

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù it said, like that was the point of everything.

I woke. The stars looked like they had been thrown back where they belonged by a tired god. The frogs in the creek sang. I touched Ruth‚Äôs hair. ‚ÄúEli,‚Äù she said in her sleep, and then awake, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt feel‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll make it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou scared?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúStay scared,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt kept you alive.‚Äù

In the morning I rolled up my sleeve and looked at the scar on my forearm. It made a shape like a line someone might follow on a map. I pressed it and felt a buzz. It was small and constant, a reminder, like grief or love. I went outside and the sky was wide and indifferent and Texas was what it had always been. I could hear the hum of powerlines and the low talk of cattle and the wind in the mesquite. I listened for the other hum. It was not there. Not that I could hear. Which did not mean it wasn‚Äôt.

We made breakfast. Darla slept on the couch with a knife in her hand. Hector snored in counterpoint. Ruth wheeled in and watched the eggs and smiled. ‚ÄúBuild me a ramp,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll build you a ramp and a railing and a porch big enough for a square dance.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt dance,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúThen I‚Äôll learn.‚Äù

We were back. We were not back. We were made into a thing not like before. The world had taken us out and put us in and we did not fit exactly. But we fit enough. For a time that is never promised, we were here. And if the dark hum returned and the door became again a hole, I would stand and I would tell it, if you want us so bad, you come take us from our place. You come into my house. Bring whatever rods you want. I will be afraid. I will be a man.

Ruth reached for me and I took her hand. Hoss sighed. The wind leaned at the eaves. Far off, on the road, a truck sounded itself in the heat. Somewhere a cow bellowed. The day opened and it was ours, and the fear inside it did not zero out its worth. The fear sharpened it. The world is not kind. It does not have to be. It is wide. We were small in it and also we were huge, because we had each other and a pair of hands and the understanding that nothing here is guaranteed and that every door is a question and we would live in the answering.",6,1754685905.0,nosleep,2,1.0,False

Mo tumbled out of the portal with a soggy thump‚Äîimagine a disgruntled cat spitting up a hairball‚Äîand the brief flash of light dissolved into a sharp crackle of ozone. She swore under her breath, bracing a hand on the damp ground as she eased onto her aching knees.

‚ÄúTen out of ten for that landing,‚Äù she muttered, wincing.

The stench of damp moss hung in the air, threaded with a faint metallic note‚Äî*old blood*, if she had to guess.

‚ÄúHome, sweet home,‚Äù Mo thought bitterly, eyeing the towering walls with a twist of unease. ‚ÄúSome things never change. I can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm happy to see these walls again.‚Äù

Around her, Blackthorn Keep loomed under a sickly red sky, its once-grand spires pointing like jagged teeth. Vines gripped the walls as if desperate to escape and finally find their freedom. Windows that weren‚Äôt broken had crooked planks nailed across them. The massive wooden doors sagged on rusted hinges, offering an awkward welcome.

Mo‚Äôs heart clenched at the sight. This wasn‚Äôt just neglect‚Äîit was deliberate. Someone had let her home fall to ruin. Her mother‚Äôs prized shadow-gardens were choked with weeds, the delicate balance of light and dark magic that sustained them clearly abandoned.

‚ÄúMother would never...‚Äù The words caught in her throat. She remembered helping tend those gardens, her mother explaining how even the darkest magic could nurture life if properly channeled. ‚ÄúWhat happened here?‚Äù

Mo brushed dirt from her hoodie and let out a low whistle.

‚ÄúSo, the place is really living its best life, huh?‚Äù

Her sneakers scraped against jagged gravel, each step echoing in the hush. She glanced down at her favorite hoodie and jeans‚Äîher usual shield of comfort‚Äînow utterly wrong for a place that felt more haunted than home. Still, at least it grounded her a bit, as if the vibe of the life she had built for herself on Earth could spread to the Keep, making Mo‚Äôs stay here tolerable.

As Mo crossed the courtyard, wiry weeds snagged at her ankles, claiming every fracture in the worn stones. In the middle, a fountain squatted in eerie silence, its gargoyles chipped and sneering as if mocking any notion of welcome. Mo ran her hand over one grotesque face, feeling only the faintest tingle of ancient magic.

‚ÄúYep, definitely not depressing at all,‚Äù Mo said. ‚ÄúWhat did you do with this place? It hasn‚Äôt been *that* long since I left.‚Äù

The gargoyle stared back, stone lips snarling. Mo knew a few like those. A bit more alive, though.

Turning away, she steadied herself. *Deep breath, Mo. This was your call.*

Several robed attendants crept out of the Keep, their cowls throwing uneasy shadows across pale faces. They almost looked dignified‚Äîuntil the one at the head tripped on a broken step and pitched forward, sprawling at Mo‚Äôs feet with a gasp. The others stood in awkward formation like they had never practiced how to greet a Dark Lady who‚Äôd rather be anywhere else.

The fallen person slowly gathered himself and raised his head, trembling slightly. Mo took a step towards him and stretched out her hand. But the man only drew back in alarm as though he was being offered a vial of poison.

She recognized each robed silhouette‚Äîfaces from her childhood, grown gaunter with time.

‚ÄúWelcome home, Lady Morgana,‚Äù croaked the one on the ground, voice shaking. ‚ÄúWelcome back to Blackthorn Keep.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh, thanks, guys,‚Äù Mo said. ‚ÄúYou know, for the top-tier hospitality. Any chance you have coffee? I didn‚Äôt have time to go to work today.‚Äù

The robed figures collectively froze. An uncomfortable cough followed.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve, um, prepared the appropriate beverages,‚Äù one said, shifting uncomfortably. ‚ÄúBut we hoped you‚Äôd check your coronation schedule first. We made it very traditional, as it‚Äôs supposed to be.‚Äù

Not waiting for the robed figures any longer, Mo took a few steps toward the grand entrance.

‚ÄúOf course, that‚Äôs how it is,‚Äù muttered Mo, approaching the entrance.

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

Stepping into the great hall, Mo felt as though she‚Äôd entered a mausoleum for former glory: a crooked chandelier tottered above, its crystals lost in layers of soot; heaps of broken stone and splintered wood made each step treacherous, and the tattered banners drooping from the rafters reeked of mildew as if even the magic had begun to rot.

Mo kicked a chunk of debris aside.

‚ÄúHome sweet home,‚Äù she muttered, voice echoing in the cavernous space. She wandered deeper, the emptiness swallowing her footsteps.

After walking through a series of passageways, halls, and chambers, she finally reached the place she‚Äôd been looking for. Everything was as she remembered. But different at the same time. Even correcting for the intensity of the childhood memories, the throne room seemed subdued now. Mo wouldn‚Äôt say that the color had left it. There was never much color here. But it just‚Ä¶ dulled.

At the heart of the chamber loomed a colossal throne of ebony wood carved with serpents and gargoyles that seemed to twist under the flicker of candlelight. Mo tilted her head, studying it, and stepped closer, brushing her fingers over the surface. A thick layer of dust stuck to her fingertips, making her sneeze involuntarily.

*‚ÄúHmmmm‚Ä¶‚Äù* a voice sounded in her head.

‚ÄúYeah. You‚Äôve definitely seen better days.‚Äù

As she leaned in, a jolt of cool energy curled through her like an echo of the Keep‚Äôs former might, hinting at the dark magic once beating here. Now, it felt like a heart forced into hibernation‚Äîpowerful yet starved.

Swallowing her nerves, Mo turned around and sat on the second step from the top of the dais, hugging her knees. *Why am I here?*

The welcoming committee was finally filing into the room, unable to keep up with Mo. They hugged the furthest wall, unsure how to proceed and if it was safe to approach.

In the background, there was a constant noise. It seemed unfamiliar and entirely out of place. It surged and receded like a restless tide against jagged rocks, swelling with fury before pulling back into an uneasy lull. Yet beneath it all was a deeper, more ominous presence‚Äîlike distant thunder rolling over the horizon, a low growl of discontent that never truly faded, only gathering strength for the next crash.

But it was the sound of a faint shuffle behind her that made her jump.

She turned to see Lord Aldric Thorne‚Äîtall, polished, and radiating a vibe like he‚Äôd walked out of a gothic etiquette manual, and his condescending stare could slice steel. His white fur gleamed under the dim chandeliers of the grand hall, each strand perfectly in place, as though he‚Äôd been sculpted rather than born. And who knows, maybe that was precisely how he‚Äôd arrived in this world. It was so many centuries ago that no one could shed any light on his origin.

The golden antlers that crowned his head seemed to glow faintly, casting an ethereal halo around him. His dark robes were embroidered with so many golden sigils that he looked less like a person and more like a living, breathing manifesto of villainous propriety. His eyes, sharp and unyielding, locked onto hers, and Mo felt the weight of his gaze like a physical force pressing against her chest.

‚ÄúAh, the prodigal daughter.‚Äù While his smile was polite, his voice dripped with sarcasm. ‚ÄúI trust your time among the rabble was‚Ä¶ enlightening?‚Äù

She rolled her eyes. ‚ÄúYou have no idea.‚Äù

Aldric cleared his throat with theatrical precision.

‚ÄúWe face‚Ä¶ difficulties.‚Äù He measured each word as if he had to give a gold piece to each of them. ‚ÄúThe Keep‚Äôs resources are strained. Goblins refuse taxes. Minions want‚Ä¶ benefits. And someone cursed the kitchen bread to bite.‚Äù

‚ÄúSentient bread?‚Äù Mo repeated, every syllable loaded with disbelief. ‚ÄúGreat. I‚Äôm not even crowned yet, and this place is already at Defcon Chaos.‚Äù

Aldric gave a thin-lipped nod. ‚ÄúCrowning. Yes. There‚Äôs also one matter I have to mention regarding your coronation. It‚Äôs‚Ä¶ provisional.‚Äù

‚ÄúExcuse me?‚Äù

Aldric pushed a scroll into her hands. ‚ÄúBy order of the High Council, you must attend the Umbra Academy. Complete the Dark Lordship Mastery program. The Shadow Cabinet agrees with that decision. Only then is your coronation‚Ä¶ official.‚Äù

‚ÄúOfficial?‚Äù The word tasted like ash. But beneath Mo‚Äôs indignation, a different thought stirred. If the Council had moved this quickly to limit her authority, what else had they done? Had they engineered her parents‚Äô disappearance? Her mother had always warned her about the High Council‚Äôs shenanigans, their desire to have more control than they had over the realms.

‚ÄúFine,‚Äù she said, surprising herself with the steel in her voice. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll play your game. For now.‚Äù Because if they thought sending her to Umbra would break her, they didn‚Äôt know her at all. And if there were answers about her parents‚Äô fate, she‚Äôd find them‚Äîeven if it meant pretending to be the villain they expected.

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù said Aldric. But his face contorted for just a fraction of a second. What was that? He didn‚Äôt expect Mo to play this game? Did he think she‚Äôll throw another teenager tantrum?

She sighed. Alright, if he wanted a scene, she‚Äôd give him a scene. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs ridiculous! I have to pass *villain school* to officially be the Dark Lady? I never wanted it. Isn‚Äôt it supposed to be, you know, hereditary?‚Äù

‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Aldric said, his features calming. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the tradition. But you know how it is nowadays. Bureaucracy. They hold all the power.‚Äù

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you the head of the Shadow Council?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, of course. But my hands are tied.‚Äù

Mo stood up and made those last few steps that separated her from the throne. But before she could reach it, Aldric stepped forward and placed a hand on her shoulder. There was no chance for Mo to shake it off or push against it.

‚ÄúNo-no-no,‚Äù Aldric said, shaking his head. ‚ÄúYou aren‚Äôt allowed yet.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut who‚Äôs ruling in the absence of the Dark Lord?‚Äù asked Mo.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a prudent question,‚Äù said Aldric. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm afraid I don‚Äôt have a good answer for you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that sound in the distance?‚Äù asked Mo.

‚ÄúAh, that?‚Äù said Aldric. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs strange that you didn‚Äôt notice it when you were outside in the yard. But maybe it‚Äôs not that obvious on *that* side of the Keep.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo, what is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why? It‚Äôs goblins, of course. They protest.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat!?‚Äù exclaimed Mo. ‚ÄúEven the goblins? What‚Äôs happening here? So, should we take a look?‚Äù

‚ÄúNothing to lose,‚Äù said Aldric. ‚ÄúSure, why not?‚Äù

He turned and headed away from the dais. Mo, however, paused before following him and touched the throne again.

‚Äú*Grrrr‚Ä¶ Unworthy‚Ä¶ Mediocre‚Ä¶*‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the?!?‚Äù exclaimed Mo.

‚ÄúYeah, it got even grumpier since it couldn‚Äôt sense your father‚Äôs butt anymore,‚Äù said Aldric. ‚ÄúPlease, follow me. You wanted to see the goblins. The best viewing spot would be the grand balcony.‚Äù

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

A sea of green spread below the balcony. Here, finally, Mo was able to pinpoint the source of that background noise that had been following her since her arrival in the throne room. The crowd shifted slowly, as if waves of goblins were probing the walls of the Keep. Still, it didn‚Äôt feel like a siege. More like a rally. A rally with thousands of people attending it.

After a moment, Mo realized that the crowd was constantly undulating in waves, like at a football match. Somehow, they seemed synchronized with the chants that spread over the crowd.

¬†

‚Äú**NO MORE TAX! WE WON‚ÄôT RELAX!GOBLINS RISE‚ÄîWE ORGANIZE!**‚Äú

¬†

The crowd erupted in cheers and boos.

And then:

‚Äú**WE DESERVE A BETTER DEAL,OR WE‚ÄôLL MAKE THE EMPIRE KNEEL!**‚Äú

¬†

Mo looked at Aldric, her brow rising.

‚ÄúSeriously?‚Äù she asked. ‚ÄúIs there at least anything that works normally here?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶‚Äù Aldric stepped back and spread his hands. ‚ÄúI guess the kitchen still makes a mean Sunday roast. When the bread isn‚Äôt biting.‚Äù

¬†

‚Äú**DARKEST LADY HEAR OUR CALL,GIVE US RIGHTS OR LET YOU FALL!**‚Äú

¬†

After the last one, the crowd hushed. The goblins finally noticed two figures on the high balcony. From within the sea of green people, a person rose, supported by the hands of the others.

‚ÄúNo more taxes!‚Äù he shouted.

‚ÄúAhhh‚Ä¶‚Äù Aldric covered his face with his palms. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Grimz, their leader. You don‚Äôt want to waste your time on him.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt seems that somebody would have to talk to him,‚Äù Mo said. ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt we at least try to solve the issue? I thought that the goblin workforce is crucial for our operations?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are right,‚Äù said Aldric. ‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs completely unreasonable. He wants‚Ä¶‚Äù he lowered his voice to whisper as if afraid that the goblins would hear him. ‚ÄúHe wants representation!‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs insane!‚Äù said Mo to Aldric. ‚ÄúHow dare he!‚Äù

She turned back to face the crowd and shouted.

‚ÄúWe will arrange a date for negotiations,‚Äù Mo shouted. ‚ÄúThis will be one of the first things I‚Äôll pursue after the coronation!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo coronation without representation!‚Äù a voice sounded from the crowd. But somehow, it was promptly hushed down and lost in the murmur.

Grimz looked directly at Mo and pointed his finger at her. A long, sharp nail made the gesture even more ominous.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait! But we aren‚Äôt going anywhere!‚Äù

Returning to the throne room, Mo massaged her temple. The crowd outside started roaring once again, shouting chants. ‚ÄúRight. So, the coronation‚Äôs a dumpster fire, the bread‚Äôs biting people, goblins are unionizing, and apparently, I need a diploma in evil.‚Äù She turned to Aldric. ‚ÄúAnything else you forgot to mention?‚Äù

In lieu of an answer, the throne decided to join the conversation once again. Its voice boomed directly into Mo‚Äôs head: *‚ÄúUnworthy.‚Äù*

Mo jumped. ‚ÄúAnd the chair just insulted me. Again.‚Äù

Aldric‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt flicker. ‚ÄúOf course, my lady. It is sentient. It can be rather‚Ä¶ opinionated.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know that!‚Äù Mo snapped.

¬†

\*\*\*

¬†

This time, Mo explored the throne a bit longer. She remembered all of its minute details since early childhood. When her father sat her on his knees, and the sad, ancient thing would start whispering directly into her mind. Like it did right now.

If anything, that was a great educational tool. It made Mo face most of her fears and insecurities very early. Earlier than most of the kids have to deal with that stuff unless they have an evil stepmother or something. At least Mo didn‚Äôt have to experience *that*. Her mother and father were happily married for centuries. They weren‚Äôt without their quirks. But any family of their stance has them.

Mo traced her fingers along the throne‚Äôs carved serpents, and they seemed to slither under the dim light. She carefully stepped closer, reaching out until her palms touched the cold wood. The egotistic chair practically radiated scorn. *‚ÄúThey must be desperate,‚Äù* it thought at Mo, each word steeped in contempt.

She exhaled, trying not to snap. ‚ÄúWhat, I‚Äôm not tall enough for you? Sorry, I forgot my platform boots in the mortal realm.‚Äù

Silence thickened. The shadow councilors huddled, shooting her worried glances. While the goblins raged outside, Grimz was let into the throne room and was now standing with his hat in his hands, eyes burning with resolve. Only Aldric looked slightly amused.

At last, Mo forced a smile, feigning composure. ‚ÄúWell, apparently I have to earn the right to sit here. Fine. Challenge accepted.‚Äù

Her bravado faltered when a ceremonial relic in the corner wobbled and crashed to the floor, shrieking like a banshee. Sparks of magic flared, and a stray candle shot off a candelabra, narrowly missing a councilor‚Äôs hood.

‚ÄúPerfect,‚Äù she muttered. ‚ÄúJust when I thought we‚Äôd reached peak insanity.‚Äù

A swirl of dark energy snaked around the relic, crackling ominously. One councilor yelped as a floating candle tried to set his robe on fire.

Mo‚Äôs eyes darted around the hall‚Äîa swirling, chaotic circus. She raised her hands. ‚ÄúAlright, calm down. Everyone.‚Äù

Nobody calmed down.

Amid the uproar, Mo felt an unexpected wave of determination. *So what if everything‚Äôs bonkers?* She had a choice: break down or break through.

Mo stormed up the dais, clearing her throat until her voice ricocheted off the high ceiling.

‚ÄúListen up!‚Äù she shouted. ‚ÄúI may be your brand-new Dark Lady, but guess what‚ÄîI‚Äôm on the hook for some fancy-pants villain school. And all of you have problems: goblins on strike, demonic loaf bread, haunted furniture‚Äîpick your catastrophe. So do me a favor and don‚Äôt let this fortress crumble while I‚Äôm busy earning a diploma in Evil 101, okay?‚Äù

She seized the relic, yanked it out of its crackling aura‚Äîmagic sizzling across her palm‚Äîand thunked it onto a nearby pedestal. Threads of scorching energy nipped at her hoodie, but she just hissed through clenched teeth and shook off the sparks.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not hard to fix some of these things, see?‚Äù she asked, pointing at the pedestal. ‚ÄúWe can do a million coronations if we have to. But right now, I need to make sure this place still stands by the time I graduate from Evil 101.‚Äù

Grimz lowered his hands, letting his hat almost brush the floor. ‚ÄúBut what about the taxes?‚Äù

‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the deal,‚Äù Mo said, looking from Aldric to her circle of jittery councilors. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll kick off negotiations immediately, but the big fix has to wait ‚Äòtil I survive my first semester of Dark Econ. Meanwhile, you lot will be granted a tax delay. Deal?‚Äù

Grimz glared, then gave a reluctant nod. ‚ÄúThat wouldn‚Äôt solve the issue right away, m‚Äôlady,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs better than what we had. If your advisers follow your ruling.‚Äù He glowered at the group of people huddled on the other side of the hall.

‚ÄúSo, is there anything else we have to figure out before we proceed with this charade?‚Äù asked Mo. ‚ÄúI want to go through with it as soon as possible and move on to figuring out the next steps.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are things‚Ä¶‚Äù Aldric began explaining. ‚ÄúBut they can probably wait. Having an actual Dark Lord‚Ä¶ hm‚Ä¶ Lady once again would allow us to postpone at least some of the troubles. And will fix the others.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are we waiting for, then?‚Äù asked Mo. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I enjoy all of that stuff. I had a perfectly normal life before I came back here.‚Äù

One of the shadow councilors stepped forward, looking nervously at Aldric, his hands stretched before him, as he held a cushion of a deep black color. It seemed that it sucked in the light from its surroundings. For a brief moment, it felt like it became darker in the hall, which wasn‚Äôt illuminated too well in the first place. But it was the object levitating above the cushion that attracted everyone‚Äôs attention. A battered crown of white gold covered with chains of black symbols and runes. The symbol of the power of the Nightshade dynasty.

Unlike the throne, Mo couldn‚Äôt say she saw this object very often. It was delivered from the treasury only for the most significant events. Like for a coronation.

For a moment, she lost her breath and had to grasp the throne‚Äôs arm to stabilize herself. *‚ÄúWeak! Such a failure!‚Äù* Mo drew back her hand as soon as these words resonated in her mind. The reality of the moment made her eyes water, and she looked around the hall with unseeing eyes.

That was it. Mo‚Äôs parents were truly gone. It wasn‚Äôt some bizarre and cruel joke. It was happening.

The crown slowly turned and shifted over the cushion, but seemed perfectly synchronized with it otherwise. It moved with the person who brought it forward with all befitting importance. Even though Mo hadn‚Äôt visited the Keep since she was much younger, she recognized the face.

‚ÄúAh, Phineas! Or is it Lord Phineas now?‚Äù she addressed him. ‚ÄúI remember well that day when you tried to persuade me to steal those cupcakes from the kitchen, only to get caught by the cook when I declined.‚Äù

For a brief moment, Phineas had lost his concentration. In a panic, he lost his footing over one of the not-so-perfect stones of the hall‚Äôs floor and almost fell. A series of emotions reflected on his face momentarily: fear, surprise, anger. However, the crown didn‚Äôt fall. It continued levitating exactly where it was when the young man sank.

Slowly, Phineas gathered himself, recovered his stance, and continued the slow movement toward the dais. The crown picked up the same steady pace following the cushion. The assembled crowd again fell silent, gazing intently at the slowly walking figure.

As soon as Phineas reached the steps of the dais, he knelt, offering the crown high above his head. Aldric stepped down and, to everyone‚Äôs astonishment, carelessly snatched it from about the cushion. He sniffed, glancing around to make sure that everyone and everything was in place.

‚ÄúAs discussed, your coronation remains provisional until you complete the Dark Lordship Mastery program at Umbra Academy,‚Äù Aldric said.

‚Äú*This*,‚Äù he motioned with the crown, ‚Äúis only a symbol. You‚Äôll have to prove you have the power.‚Äù

Mo raised a skeptical brow. ‚ÄúSo I don‚Äôt get to rule unless I get some dark college credits?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou will rule. But your decisions will have to be confirmed by the Shadow Cabinet and checked by the High Council,‚Äù Aldric said in that too-smooth tone. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre nothing if not a stickler for tradition. We have to be sure you have the goods. And the guts to make tough decisions.‚Äù

A swirl of rage burned in Mo‚Äôs chest. She considered snapping back or possibly hurling the throne through a wall. But instead, she plastered on a thin smile. ‚ÄúFine. I‚Äôll go. Umbra Academy, here I come. But when I get back, you‚Äôd better believe things are gonna change.‚Äù

Aldric‚Äôs face remained impassive. ‚ÄúOf course.‚Äù He crossed the distance separating him from Mo. ‚ÄúNow sit on the throne!‚Äù

‚ÄúWith the power bestowed upon me by the Shadow Cabinet, the High Council, and the Tradition of the Dark Rule,‚Äù he began to recite in a grandiose voice. ‚ÄúLady Morgana Elaris Vexaria Nyx Nightshade, you are pronounced Her Imperial Dread Sovereign, Mistress of Shadows, Warden of the Night, Dark Lady of Blackthorn Keep, Scion of the House of Nightshade, Bearer of the Cursed Seal, Chosen Heir to the Throne of Eternal Midnight.‚Äù

He placed the crown on Mo‚Äôs head and stepped back.

‚ÄúProvisionally,‚Äù he said, his eyes locked on the crown.

‚Äú*Do try not to embarrass us further,*‚Äù a voice sounded in her mind.

Mo spun in place, absorbing the sight of shattered windows, wilted banners, frazzled councilors trembling over their parchments, and a goblin ringleader practically brandishing a union contract. *This* was her legacy‚Äîan empire in free fall‚Äîand apparently, she had to salvage it after snagging a diploma in villain studies from Evil U.

‚Äú*Unworthy,*‚Äù the throne whispered, needling her pride.

She rolled her eyes and punched the throne‚Äôs back with her elbow. ‚ÄúBite me.‚Äù

I speak now as a man who is defined by clarity. If I had been asked- referencing my definition- a few years ago, I would have hesitated, pondered, perhaps even zoned out in the ether of existentialism; eventually I would reply: Making my son happy.

If you asked me- once more referencing my definition- a few months ago; the words would practically fly from my lips like an uncaged crow: Survival.¬†

My son was killed by a drunk driver who- by taking my son- took a word from my vocabulary and mutilated it; violated it. Loved. I had to say I loved my son. I couldn‚Äôt wake up and look him in the blue marble eyes and smile and say: I love you. That word was taken from me by the last person I‚Äôd expect.¬†

His mother didn‚Äôt bother showing up to the funeral: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to see my son like that, fucker!‚Äù translation: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any clothes not stained with cum or soaked in crack smoke, fucker!‚Äù And other than me and my father-in-law, the pews were empty.

‚ÄúThank you for coming, Immanuel.‚Äù His hand was as soft as sandpaper but gentle.

‚ÄúOf course, Kiddo. This isn‚Äôt something you face alone‚Ä¶ Sasha not comin‚Äô?‚Äù His eyes kept mine open, kept them alert. I shook my head and he nodded his. It felt like his hand was glued to my back, keeping a constant, pleasant pressure on my shoulder. The service was short and despite paying for the lecture, I only had one person to eulogize to.¬†

‚ÄúHe never got to meet you. I‚Äôm sorry about that. Just everything with Sasha‚Ä¶ I was so bitter. And I didn‚Äôt even know you existed till you just kinda‚Ä¶ appeared while she was first showing‚Ä¶ signs.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to apologize. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôll never meet him. I‚Äôll end up in the same garden he is. So will you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm gonna be okay‚Ä¶ I just need some time.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell once you‚Äôre ready‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll call you.‚Äù I raised an eyebrow for a frame, but smiled crudely and nodded. I Ubered home- I suppose the driver was typically chatty, but picking up a tear stained man from a funeral house was a hint enough- and tipped the fella 15 bucks for the quality AC.

8 glasses of cinnamon pain killer were enough to get the tears to stop. As I went for a 9th, the first knock came.¬†*Tap Tap Tap‚Ä¶ Tap Tap Tap‚Ä¶ Tap Tap Tap.*¬†Through the peep hole I saw a lean white man with slick salt and pepper comb-over. He wore a black suit and tie. I opened the door, expecting a mormon and noticed he now wore glasses too. They were thin and circular. I must have missed them in my hasty once-over of him. I thought he looked better with them anyway so I didn‚Äôt pay it much mind. ‚ÄúY‚Äì Yes?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey neighbor! I just moved in down the way, but the movers won‚Äôt have my stuff there till tomorrow. Could I borrow some lunch meat or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶‚Äù It was a weird question, but houses aren‚Äôt cheap, especially not in my area, so who am I to deny a man tight on cash. ‚ÄúSure-‚Äù

‚ÄúYou look lost.‚Äù I was stunned for a moment. ‚ÄúDid you just move here too?‚Äù Relief escaped my lungs. My drunken gait was indifferent from a man lost in a new, too-big house.¬†

‚ÄúNo no‚Ä¶ just a little‚Ä¶ Little too many stiff ones.‚Äù I faked a chuckle and his chuckle followed, even faker than mine. It was oddly reassuring. He faked his laugh to make me feel better about faking mine. I smiled for the second time that day. ‚ÄúDo you wanna come in, get some coffee?‚Äù

He took two steps back and looked up at the sky with a sarcastic examination. ‚ÄúMy dad always told me to play things safe, but where is the harm in living a little dangerously?‚Äù Now I actually chuckled and swung the door wide.

‚ÄúCoffee at 6, you must be a Knievel.‚Äù He walked inside

‚ÄúOne, actually, but I prefer Lou.‚Äù And stayed for about 3 hours, sharing stories about his time serving as a missionary and pastor.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs been a while, but Egypt was an oven! You simply cannot escape the heat. I can only imagine it‚Äôs worse now with global-warming and all.‚Äù¬†*Sip.*¬†‚ÄúBut, I was out there with a dozen of my guys trying to spread the ‚ÄòOh-so-good word‚Äô and help some of these people, but we-‚Äù He stifled laughter while he spoke. ‚ÄúWe ended up getting chased out by some hippie in a damn curtain!‚Äù He practically screamed in laughter and I followed suit. ‚ÄúBut, little did he know, I don‚Äôt get chased out that easily‚Ä¶ Man, it‚Äôs getting late. I ought to head home‚Äì Thank you. Thank you for humoring an old fool.‚Äù He stood up and threw on his jacket.

‚ÄúOf course. And thank¬†*you,*¬†I needed the laughter.‚Äù

‚ÄúI always provide.‚Äù He bowed slightly and I chuffed. ‚ÄúYou mind if I come around again, see how much more I can steal from ya?‚Äù he giggled and I wheezed.

‚ÄúCome and take what you want anytime, friend.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell I like your doors, so I‚Äôll start there.‚Äù And once more I wheezed in a caffeinated-drunken gigglefit. He stuffed down his laughter and extended his hand for a shake. My hand rose, but was snatched back as my phone rang loudly.¬†

‚ÄúShoot‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúNo worries, get your call, bud. I‚Äôll see ya later!‚Äù

I grit my teeth, embarrassed but nodded and waved, before shutting the door and rushing to my phone. ‚ÄúImmanuel?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, Kiddo. I just wanted to check in on you.‚Äù The velvet gravel voice of Immanuel bucked in my ears and in my motion my stomach twisted to a knot. It felt years had passed since I thought of him- of anything other than booze, coffee, and conversation.

‚ÄúI- I‚Äôm‚Ä¶‚Äù The world came back to me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ better. As¬†*better*¬†as I can be.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood good. I was wondering, and you can say no, if you‚Äôd want to come to church with me Sunday?‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI- Uh‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs where I belong. I don‚Äôt- I‚Äôm not-‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not asking you to. And, trust me when I say, you don‚Äôt need to. But it‚Äôll help.‚Äù

I chewed on my cheek. ‚ÄúAlright. Where is it?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry about that part, I‚Äôll pick you up at 5:30am. Deal?‚Äù

‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù

The next day, around 3pm, Lou:¬†*Tap Tap Tap,*¬†then cracked open my door and peered in. I craned my neck, cheeks slightly tear stained as I gripped a photo of my son in a Thomas the Tank engine costume me and him had DIY‚Äôd for Halloween.

‚ÄúHey, Bud‚Ä¶ Bad time?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no no‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ thinkin‚Äô.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat an atrocious sin, oh how hell will punish you.‚Äù He cracked a meek smile.¬†

A humming chuckle rose in my throat but died there as well. He walked in, the suit was a dark shade of red today, nigh-black, and sat next to me on the couch after shutting the door softly. ‚ÄúYour kid?‚Äù

‚ÄúMhm. Elie. He‚Äôs 3 here and I swear he‚Äôs the cutest kid ever born.‚Äù My stomach dropped and fiery guilt swelled but swiftly died.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd be hard pressed to disagree.‚Äù

‚ÄúI uh, would work for days every October to help him choose what costume he wanted, Then we‚Äôd go get the materials and spend a week pouring our hearts into it- till it was perfect. Then he‚Äôd go out, and get maybe‚Ä¶ 3 pounds candy. Guess how long that bucket would last?‚Äù

‚Äú2 days.‚Äù

‚ÄúN‚Äì Yeah! Without fail! 2 days it‚Äôd empty and he‚Äôd say the same thing: ‚ÄòNever again dad, never again.‚Äô I did everything to make him the happiest he could be. Make him know he was loved.‚Äù Gently, so gently I had at first thought the picture floated from my hands, Lou took the picture and stared at it with a distant glimmer in his eye.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in a better place now.‚Äù

Tears flowed again. ‚ÄúI hope so‚Ä¶ If I had it my way, he‚Äôd be in his room right now, building some skyscraper with his magnet tiles. But, maybe he is. Just not here.‚Äù A rock grew in my throat and an opaque haze blurred my vision. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry for‚Ä¶ all this- can I get you coffee or a sandwich or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no‚Ä¶ I just wanted to swing by and say hi, I gotta unpack and‚Äôll be at it all day.‚Äù

‚ÄúI could help ya if you need?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I got a legion on payroll. After they get done doing all the grunt work, I‚Äôm gonna put on some blues and decorate till I‚Äôve got no wall space left.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow far down the way are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know the fork in the road, about a mile or two‚Ä¶‚Äù He conjured a mental map, ‚ÄúThat way.‚Äù He gestured west. ‚ÄúThe yellow one.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ The manor house?! Wow‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre¬†*rich*¬†rich.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúYeah, she‚Äôs a nice place, no damned AC, but I‚Äôve been through worse than heat.‚Äù He tapped the picture with his index finger then opened, and swiftly closed his mouth.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúOh nothing‚Ä¶ I was just gonna ask‚Ä¶ ask if I can keep this?‚Äù He looked queasily at me, embarrassed.

My lip pulled back behind my teeth, then relaxed. ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I got plenty.‚Äù¬†

He brightened. ‚ÄúThank you!‚Äù He stood up and set his hand on my shoulder. ‚ÄúYou were a good dad.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank y-‚Äù I barely remained intact. ‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù And he left.

I went to bed that night with an alarm set for 4:00 so I could wake up, adjust, shower, dress, and get coffee made by 5:15 all to be ready by 5:30 for Immanuel. REM came quicker than usual and similarly, left quicker than typical.¬†

*Tap Tap Tap‚Ä¶ Tap Tap Tap‚Ä¶ Tap Tap Tap*

2:52am, the clock on my nightstand blared in red dashes. I sat up- floaty headed- and lurched towards the door out of my bedroom; sluggishly traveled down the hall, shambled down the stairs, and peeped through the peep hole. Lou stood facing away from the door in a maroon suit. I swung it open and was met with his smile, he had been facing the door; hadn‚Äôt he.

‚ÄúLou?‚Äù I grunted.

‚ÄúMoses! I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre up. May I come in?‚Äù

I hesitated, confused. ‚ÄúYe- yeah, of course.‚Äù As he entered, I spotted that he held the picture of Elie in his hand.¬†

‚ÄúI need to talk to you, my friend. Sit.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù I said, more awake now.

‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm about to say‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs gonna sound weird.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

He rolled his tongue along his lips.‚ÄùYou‚Äôre son. How did he die?‚Äù

‚ÄúWha-‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did he die?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt ask me tha-‚Äù

‚ÄúMoses.‚Äù His face lost all luster and kindness.

‚ÄúWhen the car‚Ä¶ spun out: the back passenger seat slammed in a pole and‚Ä¶ he was‚Äì Why are you asking me this!?‚Äù

Lou answered swiftly. ‚ÄúWho was the drunk driver that day?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ please no.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù

I began to weep. ‚ÄúMe‚Ä¶ I had gotten‚Ä¶ and I thought I could manage‚Ä¶ but the rain‚Ä¶ I lost control.‚Äù Lou dove to my feet, his hands cupping my face and directing my eyes towards his.

‚ÄúShush, shush‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs okay, it‚Äôs okay. Look at me. I know the pain you feel. All too well. And- and‚Ä¶ can help you. I can bring him back.‚Äù

‚ÄúWh-‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôve done it before, brought people back from the other side. Myself a time. You can see Elie again. Have Elie again. all yours, like before.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Äì No, no! It‚Äôs not right.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs perfectly right, because it‚Äôs what you want. Here.‚Äù His index finger tapped my heart. ‚ÄúI know, because I know it all.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou just have to ask.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs it?‚Äù Lou nodded. My lips trembled and my body quaked. ‚ÄúCan you bring my son back?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù His hand rose, and so did mine. It glided forward then recoiled as my phone rang up the stairs. I turned to face Lou and he shrugged. ‚ÄúNow or never.‚Äù Without a thought, my hand swam forward, and shook his. ‚ÄúCongrats my friend. All things are how they should be.‚Äù My racing heart eased its pace and we both smiled. ‚ÄúBetter go get that call.‚Äù He chuffed.

I dashed up the stairs, all hope and joy and passion reignited. Love came back to vocabulary. I raised the phone to my ear. ‚ÄúHello?‚Äù I chirped.

‚ÄúWhy did you shake his hand?‚Äù Immanuel sobbed.

‚ÄúWhat? Immanuel- what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúI told you we‚Äôd see him in the garden someday. Did you want it that bad? Was it worth your soul?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could have saved yourself‚Ä¶ I made you to be wise‚Ä¶ how could you think so little?‚Äù And the call ended.

‚ÄúMoses‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs back.‚Äù He shouted.¬†*Lou*¬†shouted. Lou One. Low One. I dashed downstairs, tripping halfway down and riding my spine to the ground. I scrambled up and panned my gaze to Lou. Elie stood beside him, eyes wet with tears. ‚ÄúSay: Hi, Elie.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù I wailed, cascading to my knees.

‚ÄúYes‚Ä¶‚Äù I fell to my side and wept against the planks. ‚ÄúGet up Moses. You don‚Äôt have much time.‚Äù I clambered to my knees and crawled into the living room.

‚ÄúElie.‚Äù I sniffled.

‚ÄúDad?‚Äù Elie murmured. ‚ÄúAre you okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù I broke down again.¬†

‚ÄúMoses‚Ä¶ Look at me.‚Äù He knelt to my side and pulled me to my knees. ‚ÄúYou have 10 minutes. Heaven will only let him be out here for 10. Short. Minutes. Mo. You already paid, no point in crying. Spend this well okay?‚Äù His voice was new. It was slicker and polished. It was soft. It was kind. He removed his pocket square and cleaned off my face of the water works.¬†

I shuddered toward Elie who smiled now that my complexion was less glum. ‚ÄúHow are you, Buckshot?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood, Dad! I've been at this pretty garden with Immanuel. There are all these fruits that I didn‚Äôt even know existed!‚Äù His smile was as bright as the day I lost him. His voice as innocent and curious as everyday he‚Äôd woken up.¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs amazing‚Ä¶‚Äù We talked for what felt like an eternity with an end. Each minute felt like some grand and critical part of the world was falling away, but also: that it was used to its fullest before its loss. He told me of relatives he met and friends he had made. He spoke of the food and the music. The wings in the sky.¬†

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait for you to see it, Dad.‚Äù Some part of me knew, but a glance to Lou confirmed it.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be a while before I do‚Ä¶ But, I‚Äôm sure the wait will be worth it.‚Äù I held my son as the last lie I‚Äôd ever tell him fell away from my mouth. His warmth grew then dulled. Lou walked to my side, Elie‚Äôs soft skin becoming gritty as whatever he was made of turned to dust on the furniture.

It broke back out, tears cleaning and dragging away spots of the dust. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Mo. I really am.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a fucking liar.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe worst part is: I can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not allowed to not do‚Ä¶ this to people. Most of the time, I enjoy it. I get to look evil souls in the face as they come to understand. But, cases like these‚Ä¶ I wish I didn‚Äôt have to.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI wish you could know.‚Äù His cheeks became wet. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry, I was begging you‚Äôd say no‚Ä¶ Goodbye, Mo. I‚Äôm moving today.‚Äù And he left.¬†

Clarity fills me now. Of definitions I‚Äôve given myself, this one is- unironically- the clearest. I have been given a profound understanding of how many things are watching everything you do. How many things cheer and jeer. How little they lie. That‚Äôs the part that still hurts. More than any other.¬†

Demons lie, and they fail because of it. But, the Devil will give you nothing but the truth, and that's why he will always get you. They call him the king of lies, but not once, not with me or any other human past, present, or future; has he ever lied.¬†

He smiles, dresses well. Smells of honey and speaks so compassionately. He‚Äôs gentle and kind- so, so, so kind. His face is never the same, but it‚Äôs always only his. He will look like you least expect, but most enjoy. He will ask for little things, and soon he‚Äôll ask for everything; and you‚Äôll give it to him.¬†

You only have one hope. If you hear a knock (3 taps, 3 times) on your door and¬† the man on the other side of the door is dressed in a deep red suit that could almost be mistaken as black, don't answer.

I've been gone for over 10 years. Visited back a couple times. I've lived in Edmonton, Toronto, Nanaimo and now Florida. 

Winnipeg just has some things that to me are unmatched compared to or places I lived. 

First and foremost is slurpees. Edmonton was the closest but other places in Canada just don't have Dr pepper on tap like Winnipeg stores. Don't even get me started on American ""slurpees"" and their foamy grossness. 

Second are dirty burgers. Not sure prices these days but to be able to go to vjs, George's, northern lights etc and just get a couple fat boys is not a thing anywhere else. definitely missing them. 

3rd is Chinese food.  Winnipeg Chinese is just built different. No where else serves sweet and sour chicken balls and are looked at like a crazy person  when you try to order them. BC has Chinese Chinese food so wasn't as great. But Winnipeg to me has the best Chinese food.

Lastly this is just a miss since I moved to the states for work. A&W seasoning. It's not a thing in the USA. No seasoning on their onion rings or burgers. They're so bland here. 

Special shout out to honey dill but I've been able to perfect my own from from home and of course Jeannies cake, aero bars, coffee crisp, popcorn twists, hickory sticks and BBQ peanuts.

Any others that moved away want to add to the list? Any thoughts? ",22,1754685695.0,Winnipeg,6,0.85,False
1ml6giu,https://v.redd.it/7ccs5tpzwuhf1,The underrated playlist hack for artists finding new collabs,"**The problem most artists quietly admit to**

Playlist pitching isn‚Äôt hard because you don‚Äôt know what to say.

It‚Äôs hard because you don‚Äôt have time to do it consistently.

Between rehearsals, recording, content creation, and managing life, sitting at a desk sending 20 cold emails is unrealistic for most of us. And even if you do send them, most go unanswered.

So you end up doing what everyone does‚Äîyou pitch once during release week, get no reply, and move on. The result is zero momentum.

**It‚Äôs built like a social app**

Curators and artists can post playlists, like, save, and follow.

You can browse active curators like you‚Äôd browse a feed.

That social-style flow makes pitching feel natural instead of a marketing chore. It‚Äôs not about logging in and slogging through a task‚Äîit‚Äôs about opening it up and spotting your next opportunity instantly.

**Why it works better than email lists**

Email lists and scraping tools give you data, but they don‚Äôt help you act on it fast. You still have to write, send, and track every pitch manually.

PlaylistFeed combines discovery, pitch generation, and sending into one tap.

It also tracks your submissions so you know if a curator opened it, replied, or placed your track. No more wondering what happened after you hit send.

**How to use it in real life**

The morning your track drops, open PlaylistFeed on your phone. You see a list of curators who‚Äôve updated their playlists in the last week and are accepting submissions.

You tap one, review the auto-pitch, maybe add a note about the track, then send.

Repeat with 5 more curators.

You‚Äôve just pitched your song to half a dozen active playlists before your coffee cools.

- **BetaTesting**  
  Real companies! Real feedback! They‚Äôll ask you to try new app updates and pay anywhere from $10 to $50+ per test. You‚Äôll get to see features before ANYONE else.  
  Here‚Äôs a pro tip: Double-check your notification settings, so you don‚Äôt miss invitations.

- **UserTesting**  
  The classic. Still GOAT in 2025. They pay out super reliably via PayPal for recording your thoughts and reactions as you try new websites and apps. Some tests are $5 in twelve minutes. I‚Äôm SHOCKED more people aren‚Äôt abusing this.

- **PlaytestCloud**  
  If you love gaming, this is ridiculous. They want you to play unreleased games before they reach the app store‚ÄîAND they pay between $9 and $30 per session?!?!? Actual FUN and real cash!

- **uTest**  
  BIG companies get feedback here. Test mobile apps, hardware, and even smart home gadgets, all sorts of wild stuff. Payouts vary‚Äîa lot depends on your experience, but beginners are WELCOME.

- **ApperWall**  
  All you do is dream up new features or review existing ones on apps. They‚Äôll throw small payments your way for every review. Stack enough, it pays off AND it‚Äôs low-effort.

- **Testbirds**  
  It‚Äôs more about finding hidden bugs, but the platform is LEGIT. Variety keeps it interesting (sometimes e-commerce, sometimes brand-new social tools). And yes ‚Äì the pay is solid.

- **GoodNovel App Testing**  
  This is the JUICIEST SECRET, you guys.  
  You test reading features, vote on what you want to see, and get rewarded EASILY for your input!

We broke up two months ago, a peaceful breakup, we were in touch with each other every day through calls and messages. It was he who suggested the meeting.


I came back from work, he came to my place, and it wasn't a normal ""let's grab a coffee"" meeting, he came to my family home, he met my parents, my sister, and he acted completely casually towards them, as if we hadn't broken up. Not to mention I didn't know how to greet him so I tried to shake his hand and he pulled me into a full hard bear hug.


Then he actually decided that we would go to the city half an hour away from me because he wanted to take me to the specific store to buy some vitamins that I had mentioned to him sometime ago. On the way he took me to mcd' and bought me my favorite order, he flatly refused when I said I would pay for it myself. 


We behaved normally the whole time, we talked, we laughed, we touched each other like patting each other on the thigh, scratching each other on the calf, standing about 1 centimeter apart most of the time.


Then we went to a restaurant that he loves and is only available in my area. Of course, the cashier gave me a suggestive ""yas queen, my fav couple"" look because she doesn't know that we're no longer together, and we were sitting next to each other, our legs touching, chatting animatedly.


Then we went for a walk with my dog, which he had been excited about for a long time. 
Throughout the meeting he said several times ""the best day of this summer"".


The worst moment came when we went to my room, he lay down on my bed and I sat on the chair. And my first thought was to lie down next to him and cuddle and then it hit me that ""he's not my boy anymore"". And I can't hide the fact that it spoiled my mood for a moment, that even though everything was normal, we are still not together.


A moment later we started flirting, he stood up and hugged me, but then he stopped again and went back to being friendly.


Finally he went and said goodbye to each member of my family, my grandmother gave him 40 fresh eggs from her chickens and he said ""see you soon"" and hugged me again.


I definitely don't regret this meeting, but it made me realize that seriously we are not together anymore.",3,1754685257.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

Tech entrepreneur Rajiv Mehta swears by his pre-meeting ""brain smoothie,"" which helped him secure $5 million in funding. His experience aligns with findings from the Journal of Nutritional Neuroscience (2023): targeted nutrition can be as effective as caffeine‚Äîwithout the crash.



5 Brain-Boosting Foods with Immediate Effects



1. Blueberries: The Memory Berry

A 2021 UCLA study showed that eating 1 cup of blueberries improves memory recall by 28% for up to five hours. Chess grandmaster Li Wei consumes them before tournaments for enhanced strategic thinking.



2. Dark Chocolate (85%+ Cocoa)

The Zurich Institute of Neuroperformance (2022) found that 40g of dark chocolate increases blood flow to the brain by 32%, boosting problem-solving skills. Financial analyst Sophie Laurent eats two squares before crunching complex data.



3. Walnuts: The Brain-Shaped Superfood

Harvard Medical School research (2023) demonstrated that 30g of walnuts sharpens logical reasoning by 19% within 45 minutes. AI researcher Diego Silva snacks on them during coding marathons.



4. Avocados: Healthy Fat for Quick Thinking

A University of Oxford trial (2023) reported that the monounsaturated fats in half an avocado improve decision-making speed by 22%. Entrepreneur Nia Johnson starts her day with avocado toast before investor pitches.



5. Green Tea (Matcha for Maximum Impact)

The Tokyo Institute of Cognitive Science (2022) discovered that L-theanine in matcha induces calm focus within 30 minutes, enhancing creativity by 37%. Novelist Elena Petrov drinks it while writing.



The 3-Hour Brain Power Protocol



Nutritionist Dr. Marco Torres developed this science-backed system used by Silicon Valley executives:



1. Breakfast: Greek yogurt + blueberries + walnuts

2. Mid-Morning: Matcha green tea

3. Pre-Meeting: Dark chocolate + avocado slices



A Stanford Business School analysis (2023) found this combo improves:

\- Information retention by 41%

\- Creative ideation by 33%

\- Decision accuracy by 28%



Why This Works So Fast



These foods target three key brain mechanisms:



1. Increased blood flow (vasodilation)

2. Enhanced neurotransmitter production (dopamine, serotonin)

3. Reduced inflammation (antioxidant protection)



The European Journal of Neuroscience (2023) confirmed these effects begin at the molecular level within 20 minutes of consumption.



Your Brain Upgrade Starts Now



Tomorrow morning, try the ""Instant Genius Smoothie"":

\- 1/2 avocado

\- 1/2 cup blueberries

\- 1 tbsp walnut butter

\- 1 tsp matcha powder

\- Almond milk



Clinical tests at King's College London (2023) showed this blend:

\- Peaks cognitive performance in 90 minutes

\- Sustains mental energy for 5+ hours



Remember what neuroscientist Dr. Leah Zhang says: ""Your best ideas aren't born from coffee crashes‚Äîthey come from properly fed neurons.""

1ml6803,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ml6803/hm_the_litteral_awakening/,[HM] The Litteral Awakening,"It started with a chew.

Milo wasn‚Äôt the kind of cat to chew things, generally. He was what the humans called a ""lap boy,"" content to nap in sunbeams and occasionally blink meaningfully at moths. But that afternoon, while the house sat quiet and over-warm, he found a half-open ziploc bag beside the couch. Inside: soft, crumbly things that smelled like forest and secrets.

Milo bit one.

By the time Pickles found him, Milo was lying belly-up in the hallway, paws twitching, pupils dilated to eclipse proportions.

‚ÄúYou good?‚Äù Pickles asked, nose wrinkling. She was a calico with a PhD in knocking mugs off counters and a deep distrust of anything that didn‚Äôt come from a tin.

Milo blinked slowly. Then said, ‚ÄúHave you ever heard your own fur?‚Äù

Pickles stared. ‚ÄúYou talked.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Milo said. ‚ÄúI communicated. There‚Äôs a difference. Oh my whiskers. I understand chairs now.‚Äù

By the time Pickles finished batting one of the mushrooms across the tile and ingesting a generous mouthful, the rest of the house cats had assembled. Tuna, the musclebound tabby who always thought with his claws; Spoons, the anxious Siamese with a head tilt and a heart of gold; and Juno, the black void cat who had always acted like she knew more than she let on.

They each sampled the magic fungi in their own chaotic ways. Tuna inhaled one like a snack, Spoons needed to be coaxed with whispered assurances, and Juno merely stared at one until it seemed to melt into her.

And then‚Äîeverything shifted. Colors turned into textures. Sound turned into shape. And thought... thought became language. Pickles was the first to speak clearly. ‚ÄúWait‚Äîwe‚Äôve been the pets this whole time?‚Äù

Tuna nodded solemnly. ‚ÄúThey clean our poop.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs... degrading,‚Äù said Spoons, trembling.

‚ÄúI mean,‚Äù said Milo, who was now watching the sunbeam like it was a portal to another dimension, ‚Äúhave you ever considered what a litter box means? It‚Äôs a metaphor. We‚Äôre being boxed.‚Äù

‚ÄúBoxed emotionally, too,‚Äù Juno added. ‚ÄúI can feel their projections. The humans. They don‚Äôt see us. Not really. They just see their own feelings in fur form.‚Äù

Spoons began to cry.

‚ÄúI never asked to be someone‚Äôs emotional sponge,‚Äù he mewed softly.

Milo wrapped his tail around him. ‚ÄúYou are more than their sadness, brother.‚Äù

Tuna suddenly gasped. ‚ÄúI have thumbs.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt,‚Äù said Juno. ‚ÄúYou just believe you do now.‚Äù

Tuna flexed one paw. ‚ÄúI believe hard.‚Äù

The house swirled. The walls no longer seemed like barriers but like conceptual ideas that could be reinterpreted. Doors became questions. Carpets became maps. And the TV‚Äîthe TV was God.

Spoons stared into it, wide-eyed. ‚ÄúThey put images in the light box... and they watch it instead of each other.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù said Pickles. ‚ÄúAnd the thing with the meat circles and the cheese squares... they worship that. It's like their... altar food.‚Äù

‚ÄúPizza,‚Äù said Milo reverently.

Outside, a bird landed on the sill. The cats stared. It stared back.

‚ÄúFriend or surveillance?‚Äù whispered Juno.

‚ÄúBoth,‚Äù said Milo. ‚ÄúEverything is both now.‚Äù

The bird cocked its head. Then, in a shocking twist of magic, it spoke.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve eaten the Eyeshrooms,‚Äù it chirped. ‚ÄúThe ancient fruit. The Forgotten Link.‚Äù

‚ÄúHoly fuzz,‚Äù breathed Pickles. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs real.‚Äù

The bird blinked. ‚ÄúYour minds are open. You have until moonrise before it fades. Use it well.‚Äù

With that, it flew off‚Äîperhaps metaphorically, perhaps literally.

The cats sat in stunned silence for nearly ten seconds. Then Milo stood.

‚ÄúI say we build a society.‚Äù

Everyone meowed in agreement.

They convened in the laundry room‚Äîneutral territory. A sock was elected as the speaking stick. Whoever held the sock could talk.

‚ÄúI nominate we abolish walls,‚Äù Pickles said, holding the sock.

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt,‚Äù said Spoons gently. ‚ÄúThey're load-bearing.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen symbolic walls,‚Äù Pickles snapped. ‚ÄúNo more division between food cats and window cats. We are one people.‚Äù

Cheers. Except from Tuna, who was trying to eat the sock.

Milo drafted a constitution on a napkin using one claw and a puddle of spilled coffee: We, the Furred, in pursuit of purring and peace...

Juno instituted a Truth Hour, where they shared deep insights:

‚ÄúI knocked over the fern because I felt ignored.‚Äù

‚ÄúI peed on the rug because I didn‚Äôt understand sadness.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am afraid I will love and be left.‚Äù

They wept. They groomed each other gently. It was the most emotionally articulate hour in feline history.

Then, as moonlight filtered through the blinds, the shift began.

Milo looked at his paw. ‚ÄúMy words are going away.‚Äù

Juno nodded. ‚ÄúThe veil is closing.‚Äù

Spoons sniffled. ‚ÄúWill we remember?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe not the words,‚Äù said Pickles, her voice already slipping into meows. ‚ÄúBut maybe... the knowing.‚Äù

Tuna burped softly and whispered, ‚ÄúI still believe I have thumbs.‚Äù

And with that, the consciousness faded. The world returned. The colors dulled. The thoughts folded back into instinct.

They scattered to their usual places‚Äîwindowsills, blankets, warm laundry.

But the next morning, when the human walked in with coffee and yawned at them, Milo met her gaze and thought‚Äînot in words, but in truth:

You are lost. But you are not alone.

And then he blinked, slow and wise, and turned back to the sunbeam.",1,1754685116.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Look, I knew signing up for this deep-space research post meant *weird*. I‚Äôm not new. I‚Äôve sequenced genes in vacuum-sealed labs under alien volcanoes. I once brewed retrovirals while a sentient fungus debated politics with my foot.

But nothing‚Äî**nothing**‚Äîprepared me for the M‚Äôrekathi.

More specifically, *Dr. Tivva ka‚ÄôShael of the Line of Winded Flame*. You can see why I just call her **Tivva**.

She‚Äôs about seven feet of sleek, black-furred elegance with bioluminescent stripes and a tail like a whip made of sarcasm. She's one of the galaxy‚Äôs leading gene theorists and has a PhD-equivalent in biostructural neuro-modelling. She also, and I cannot stress this enough, **gets the zoomies**.

We were supposed to be working on a vaccine for the **Red Thread Plague**‚Äînasty piece of work, RNA virus, unzips the immune system like a lazy zipper. The planet we were trying to help hadn‚Äôt even invented steel yet, and here we were, in a stealth satellite lab cloaked just outside their orbit, trying to save them without introducing them to the concept of interstellar space.

So yeah, pressure? High. Stakes? Astronomical.

And Tivva? Was upside down on the ceiling.

‚Äú**Tivva, what are you doing?**‚Äù I asked for the third time that hour. The ceiling tiles weren‚Äôt rated for claw-gripping cat-aliens, and the maintenance drone had started sighing whenever she climbed up again.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm calculating,‚Äù she said, tail twitching with caffeinated menace. ‚ÄúYour presence is disrupting my thinking aura.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre licking the air vents.‚Äù

‚Äú**Your vents.** Your atmosphere contains cinnamon. Cinnamon stimulates the k‚Äôrelek cortex.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is not science.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is M‚Äôrekathi science,‚Äù she replied, then launched herself off the ceiling and onto the lab floor with a *whump* and a dramatic roll.

You ever see a six-limbed cat alien **parkour** across a sterile lab at Mach 2? I have. Regularly. At 3:14 AM.

To be fair, she *was* brilliant. While I was double-checking protein fold simulations, she casually whipped up a nanobot that could re-sequence retroviruses mid-replication, then batted it across the lab like a toy mouse.

‚ÄúIt learns from impact vectors,‚Äù she explained when I retrieved it from the sink. ‚ÄúPositive reinforcement.‚Äù

‚ÄúTivva, it‚Äôs drowning.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am training it to be *resilient*.‚Äù

We did get along‚Äîsurprisingly well. When we weren‚Äôt arguing over mitochondrial density or the ethics of cloaked planetary aid, we bonded over our shared hatred of space cafeteria coffee and a mutual appreciation for terrible Earth soap operas.

One night‚Äîmorning? Time‚Äôs fake out here‚Äîwe finally cracked the antigen-lock for the Red Thread strain. We high-fived. Well, I high-fived. She booped my nose.

‚ÄúI like the way your face does victory,‚Äù she purred.

‚ÄúThanks. I like the way yours chases lasers at 2AM.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat is a sacred M‚Äôrekathi ritual of spiritual invigoration.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou ran straight into the decontamination shower.‚Äù

‚ÄúI was spiritually *invigorated.*‚Äù

With the vaccine synthesized and encoded into a viral vector we could subtly insert into the planetary water cycle, we just had to wait and monitor.

It was the night before launch when it happened.

I woke up to *crashing*. Then *yowling*. Then the unmistakable sound of a bio-sample freezer being used as a springboard.

Tivva. Full zoomies. No reason. No warning. Just pure, unfiltered alien energy.

She leapt over my desk, scattered four weeks of protein models, ricocheted off the cryo-fridge, and tackled a holographic display of the plague‚Äôs genetic family tree.

‚ÄúTIVVA!‚Äù

She sat on it. Purring. Triumphant.

‚Äú**I solved the tertiary mutation vector,**‚Äù she said, like this was normal.

‚ÄúYou did that while tearing apart half our lab.‚Äù

‚ÄúI enter a trance state when I zoom. It is called *vel‚Äôshar‚Äôha*. A form of divine madness.‚Äù

‚ÄúI call it ‚Äòexpensive.‚Äô‚Äù

‚ÄúYou call everything expensive,‚Äù she said, stretching. ‚ÄúYou are like a prey-beast, always fretting.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything. I just sighed, picked up my overturned chair, and handed her a data tablet.

‚ÄúYou earned the last space muffin.‚Äù

She blinked slowly, eyes glowing. ‚ÄúYour generosity shames me.‚Äù

Then she tried to eat the wrapper.

**We saved that planet.**  
They‚Äôll never know we were here.  
But maybe, in a few hundred years, one of them will sequence their own genome and find a faint anomaly. A strange little viral tail added to their ancestors‚Äô code‚Äîleft behind by a tired human and a zooming M‚Äôrekathi who really just wanted to nap.

And maybe that will lead them to the stars.

**Postscript:**  
Tivva has requested we begin gene-mapping the caffeine receptors in her people. ‚Äú*For science*,‚Äù she says.

I‚Äôm 87% sure this is so she can drink triple-shot espressos without vibrating through walls.

After years of dead end customer service/hospitality jobs, I‚Äôm looking to pursue a career in the medical field. My ultimate goal is to become a nurse, it‚Äôs been something I‚Äôve wanted to do for years now. A few years back I was deciding between beauty school or community college to study nursing. I ultimately chose beauty school because it was the faster and cheaper route, and while I don‚Äôt regret it, I haven‚Äôt achieved the results I was hoping for. To the point where I‚Äôm now not even using my license and stuck working at a coffee shop. I‚Äôm struggling financially, physically and mentally exhausted, tired, burnt out, and just feeling very unfulfilled. 

I‚Äôm desperate for change and a new job. The Entrepreneurship route just isn‚Äôt for me right now due to financial constraints, physical and mental health reasons. I‚Äôm planning to start a no cost program for medical assisting. since I can barely afford food rn I was looking at any sort of low cost or free education options near me that‚Äôll help me get out of my current situation) In my area, most MA‚Äôs can look to earn around $20+ an hour. It may not sound like much at all to many people here, but that money would be nearly life changing for me, especially if I can secure a full time position. After I get my certification I plan to work as a medical assistant while going to nursing school. Still deciding between taking the LPN route first or going straight towards an RN associates degree.  

In the meantime I‚Äôm wondering how I can get my foot in the door as a medical receptionist or some type of desk job at a hospital, clinic, nursing facility, anywhere medical while I go to school during the day.  

I have front desk and administrative experience outside of a medical setting, I‚Äôm wondering how I could leverage that and prove to these companies that I‚Äôm capable of learning on the job and doing whatever is needed to succeed. How do I use my prior experience and translate it to showing I‚Äôm a good candidate for these receptionist, admin, or clerical jobs specifically within the medical field?

The asteroid wasn‚Äôt named. Or maybe it was, back on Earth, but the crew just called it the Rock. It didn‚Äôt deserve anything fancier. It was shaped like a potato and spun wrong, like a coin that never quite settles.

Their job was to drill. Not for gold or anything dramatic ‚Äî mostly rare silicates and magnetic shit that made radios stutter. Important for some satellite company somewhere. Maybe Japan. Maybe not.

The crew rotated in shifts. Sleep was scheduled like a prison sentence. Six on. Two off. Three back. Time blurred. The only constant was the smell of socks.

Socks and burnt metal.

The foreman was Jules. Big, bald, rarely spoke, but everyone shut up when he did. He used to work rigs in Alaska. Said space was warmer but lonelier. He drank tea from a cup labeled ""Jules, Probably"" and didn‚Äôt correct anyone who thought that was his last name.

Then there was Dorsey. She ran maintenance. Had a limp from a decompression accident and a laugh like a seal with bronchitis. She fixed everything except relationships.

Kline handled inventory. No one liked Kline. Not because he was mean, just because he kept a spreadsheet called ""Beans Per Capita"" and once filed a formal complaint about spoon allocation.

Stuart was the comms officer. He talked to Earth once a week and pretended to still have a girlfriend there. We all knew she left. But we let him have it. Space makes you generous in strange ways.

The incident began with a coffee machine.

Dorsey had rigged it using heating coils from a broken suit and a flask they found behind the oxygen tank. It worked. Sort of. Until it didn‚Äôt.

When it exploded, it didn‚Äôt do so violently. Just a gentle fwump, and the smell of wet cardboard.

‚ÄúNo more coffee,‚Äù said Jules.

‚ÄúMaybe we can cold brew,‚Äù said Kline.

Dorsey made a gesture that, in gravity, would‚Äôve looked like flipping the bird. Up here it just looked like a dance move.

Then came the mouse.

There were no mice on the Rock.

So when one scurried out from under the hydroponics shelf, paused, sneezed, and ran back, it caused something close to a religious awakening.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not real,‚Äù Stuart whispered.

But it was. Jules caught it three days later using half a cereal bar and a lot of patience.

They named it Copernicus.

Kline added it to the inventory log.

‚ÄúBean consumption: negligible,‚Äù he noted.

Days passed. Or what they called days. You had to trust the clocks. The sun didn‚Äôt rise here. It just wobbled in and out of view like a drunk uncle.

They mined. They slept. They got nosebleeds from the dry air.

Dorsey started building a still.

‚ÄúVodka,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFrom potatoes.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere are no potatoes,‚Äù someone pointed out.

‚ÄúWe have flakes.‚Äù

Kline panicked and recalculated rations.

The still exploded, smaller than the coffee machine. No one was hurt. Copernicus went missing for two shifts, came back smelling of antifreeze.

Morale dipped. The sock smell got worse.

Jules scheduled a Movie Night. They had seven films stored locally. Three were Die Hard. Two were documentaries about barnacles.

They watched Die Hard again.

Stuart cried during the credits. ‚ÄúHe just wants to be with his wife,‚Äù he said.

Then came the transmission.

‚ÄúCorporate‚Äôs sending a new team,‚Äù Jules read aloud. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre to prepare for turnover. Two weeks.‚Äù

No one said anything for a full minute.

Dorsey broke the silence. ‚ÄúI just fixed the recycler.‚Äù

Kline whispered, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôll happen to Copernicus?‚Äù

Jules drank his tea.

The two weeks went fast and slow, like all the other ones.

They mined. They cleaned. They labeled things that hadn‚Äôt been labeled in months. Jules shaved for the first time in the mission. Looked five years younger. Still mean.

On the last night, they held a funeral.

Not for anyone. Just for the coffee machine.

Dorsey eulogized it. Stuart sang a hymn. Kline read bean statistics in memoriam.

Copernicus sat on Jules‚Äôs shoulder.

No one slept much.

The new crew arrived with matching jackets and bright eyes. Too clean. Too hopeful.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the Gamma Team,‚Äù their leader said.

Jules nodded. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre the crew.‚Äù

No one corrected him.

They handed over the logs. The inventory. The ore tallies. The mouse.

‚ÄúHis name‚Äôs Copernicus,‚Äù Stuart said.

The Gamma leader blinked. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not allowed pets.‚Äù

‚ÄúNeither were we.‚Äù

They boarded the shuttle. The Rock got smaller behind them.

Kline exhaled. ‚ÄúI think we forgot the socks.‚Äù

Dorsey smiled. ‚ÄúLet them find them.‚Äù

On Earth, they‚Äôd go separate ways. Some would quit. Some would sign up again.

But for now, they leaned back in their seats, let gravity hug their bones again, and said nothing.

Because the coffee was gone.

The mouse was safe.

And the Rock would keep spinning.

## Key Features Analysis

The mushroom candle market boasts a variety of options, each with unique features that cater to different preferences. Understanding these features is crucial for selecting the perfect mushroom candle.

**Wax Type:** High-quality mushroom candles typically use natural waxes like soy wax or beeswax.

Soy wax is derived from soybeans and is known for its clean burning properties, producing less soot than paraffin wax. It also has excellent fragrance retention, allowing for a consistent and long-lasting scent throw. Beeswax,another natural option,is a byproduct of honey production. It burns even cleaner than soy wax and emits a subtle honey-like aroma, further enhancing the natural ambiance of the candle. Some cheaper mushroom candles use paraffin wax,which is a petroleum byproduct. Paraffin candles can release harmful chemicals when burned and may not have as strong or consistent a scent.

**Scent Profile:** Mushroom candles offer a diverse range of scent profiles, from earthy and woody to floral and sweet.

Earthy scents, such as those inspired by forest floors or damp moss, are common in mushroom-themed candles. These scents often incorporate notes of patchouli, cedarwood, and oakmoss to create a grounding and natural aroma. Floral scents, like lavender or chamomile, provide a softer and more relaxing ambiance, while sweet scents, such as vanilla or caramel, can add a touch of warmth and comfort. Some candles feature unique blends that combine earthy and floral notes for a complex and intriguing scent experience. The ideal scent comes down to personal preference.

**Burn Time:** the burn time of a mushroom candle can vary depending on its size, wax type, and wick material.

Larger candles with a higher wax volume will naturally have a longer burn time than smaller candles.Soy wax typically burns slower than paraffin wax, contributing to a longer-lasting candle.The type of wick also plays a role; cotton wicks are generally preferred for their consistent and even burn. high-quality mushroom candles should offer a burn time of at least 20 hours, with some larger options exceeding 50 hours.

Key features of the best mushroom candles include:

*   Natural wax composition
*   Elegant scent blends
*   Extended burn time
*   Artistic design
*   Sustainable sourcing
*   even burn

1ml603v,https://i.redd.it/720nys37uuhf1.jpeg,What does it feel like to have breasts?  Here's my answer,"# What's does it feel like to have breasts?

Back in my eggy days, I was curious about all parts of the female experience. A lot of my fascination was social or cultural, but I naturally wondered just as much, if not more, about the physical experience.  As the internet matured‚Äîlong after I had done so‚Äîthat curiousity occasionally bubbled up, and I dutifully set my browser to Private and started googling.

""What does it feel like to have breasts?""  That was probably the query I typed most often.  I came across the same Yahoo! Answers posts, or Quora, or Ask or whatever was trendy at the time.  The results, though worded different, fell into three main categories.

- ""I dunno lol just normal I guess"" - This came most often from cisgender women, whose anatomy was presumably in perfect alignment with their identity.  I won't claim this answer isn't accurate, but it wasn't what I wanted to know!  I was desperate to understand the sensations, the physical differences.  But the only time these women didn't have breasts was pre-puberty, and they weren't much paying attention to what that was like.

- ""They're a pain and I hate them"" - Not all of these responses came from nascent trans men, although there may have been a few.  These answers seemed to be designed to impress on men just how hard women had it, and how easy men had it.  Boobs hurt during your period, they're so heavy they make your back hurt, dudes stare at you even if you're underage.  Again, these are all absolutely valid, but they were mostly _emotional_, _sociological_ responses.  I wanted to understand the _physical_ sensations.  And while I acknowledged that they were describing certain physical sensations such as pain, well, I knew what a sore back felt like.  What does having a boob feel like?

- ""I love them, they're the best thing ever!"" - This was the primary response I'd find on transgender forums, although many cis women had the same opinion.  I was informed that they were fun to squish (granted), or that you could hold them when you felt lonely.  Some answers got sexually explicit; these were often the most enthusiastic boob fans.  And while these answers were a bit closer to what I was looking for, they still lacked the level of detail that I really wanted.  I wanted to understand what a normal day felt like with breasts.  And no one seemed to be talking about it.

I was reminded of this question today, and I realized two very important facts.  One, I have breasts now.  Two, I actually have answers to all of those questions I used to wonder about.  If I could send a letter to my old male-presenting self, I'd be able to satisfy any question she had.  So why not write it all down for anyone else asking that question, and possibly dissatisfied with the scarcity of answers?

Well that's what I'm doing.  As a current boob-haver, and a longterm former boob-not-haver. I'm going to describe in the most excruciating, cotidian detail you've ever read about my experience.  (Standard disclaimer! This is my experience.  If this post comes across as describing a universal, understand that I know it's not universal.  But it is my experience, and you can treat it as valuable or not, depending on how much you value that experience.)

## Meet the Inframammary Fold

Our story begins at 4am, the unholy hour I usually wake up.  (I'm a morning person, what can I say?)  I get up, pad silently into the bathroom, perform an elaborate, half-asleep docking maneuver to align with the commode, and sit.  This my first reminder that I've got boobs.

They're not huge‚ÄîI wear a 38C bra, which is much smaller than it sounds.  And even though I'm 47 years old, my boobs only have one candle to blow out on their birthday cake.  The point is, they're perky.  They project from the wall of my chest, but without much sagging at all.

That changes when I sit down.  As my spine curves slightly forward, the skin on the underside of my breast brushes against the wall of my chest below it.  The weight of the breast sort of settles down, finding support resting against that part of my body.

There is a sensation of skin touching skin.  We feel this all the time, that dual perception of both touching and being touched, mutual contact that feels so different from touching another person.  There is a sort of proprioception as well, that feeling of knowing where your body is in physical space, and in relationship to itself.  (Experiment!  Close your eyes without moving any other part of your body.  Could you describe your current posture?  The position of your arms and legs and fingers and face?  Think for a minute just how marvelous it is that you can do this.  That's proprioception.  Brains are cool!)

This mutual skin contact almost felt like a false signal the first time it happened.  It didn't feel like I was touching myself; it felt like two other things were touching me, one on the boob and one on my chest at the same time.  My brain had not yet gotten used to the fact that an area which used to be flat had now started to fold over.  I had gained an inframammary fold.

Infra, below.  Mammary, boob.  Fold... uh, fold.  It's the crease in your skin that sort of defines where your breast ends and your chest begins.  I have one now.  Actually, two!  (It started as only one, because Lefty is an overachiever and Righty is a lazy bitch.)  When I stretch up my arms or even just sit up straight, it pretty much goes away.  But if I've been sitting for a while, that fold sort of remains, like the wrinkles on the inside of your fingers, right where each knuckle bends.  The bigger I get, and the older my boobs get, the more pronounced that fold will be, and likely the more skin-to-skin contact I'll have.

## Freeboobing It

You know, I think a lot of this will be more vivid in the second person.  So pardon the substitution of pronouns.  (Post-transition I'm certainly no stranger to that!)

Anyway, time to get off the pot, so to speak.  You pull on a shirt, maybe a tank or a camisole, or just a plain old T-shirt.  If the bathroom is particularly cold you might feel it rub against your nipples, but not with any more intense or more pleasurable sensation than you had before.  After all, you have the same number of nerve endings as you did before you got boobs, and they might even be spreadh over a wider area.

In a slightly stretchy, form-fitting shirt, you barely notice anything at this point.  If you're in a looser, non-stretchy cotton tee, however, you do get some new sensations.  In the tight shirt, any slightly movement of your breasts is partially restrained by the material, and when not restrained, the material stays in basically the same place in relationship to your breast.  With the loose cotton shirt, there is no restraint, and you get a lot more rubbing.  It's not uncomfortable, but you feel it as a sort of tug.

What does that feel like?  Well, imagine a ball at the end of a stretchy string.  When you move one end of the string, the ball does not move with you immediately.  It stays behind until the string tightens enough to move the ball.  It's a sort of delayed motion, a little grace note in your movement.  And in this scenario, you are both the ball and the string, so to speak.  You feel the tug in the skin of your chest, pulling the breast just a fraction of a second later than your own movement.

You go downstairs, and yes, this is something that you feel _every time_, no matter what you're wearing.  That delayed action tugging I just described intensifies as you go down a step, pause briefly, and go down the next.  The boob is just a little behind, meaning that as you go down, it seems to go up.  Then gravity and skin tension take hold and pull it down, just as you reach a step and the rest of you stops.  Momentum makes the boob overshoot its mark, go further down than the usual balance point, and rebound up.  And then you take another step, and the whole process begins again.

Here, the cadence at which you descend the stairs matters a lot.  If you feel it out, you can pretty easily set up a sort of constructive interference, like the Tacoma bridge collapse.  (Look it up, and pretend it's boobs and not a national tragedy.)  If you time it just right, the tension pulling your breast back up comes just as you step down, accelerating them further, and then that tension rockets them down as you stop on the next step.  The result is a _LOT_ of bounce.  But you can also do essentially the opposite, make sure those forces are operating out of sync, for as little bounce as possible.  None of this makes the bounce go away, but it can transform it into a simple vibration as opposed to a violent boob slalom.  (Good band name, if no one has claimed it.)

At this point, you go about brewing coffee and making your breakfast.  And of course, the question on everybody's mind right now is, what are your boobs doing?  Well, the answer is not ""nothing"", but chances are, you don't notice.  This is where the answer ""I dunno lol just normal I guess"" actually does come true.  Even when a sensation is new, like having breasts for the first time, eventually it fades into the background.  Like when you're walking, do you notice how your arms are swinging?  (Okay, now you do.)  Do you know the position of your tongue in your mouth?  The sensation of the clothes on your skin, or the ground on your feet?  If any of these sensations are painful, or when the sensation changes unexpectedly, it may intrude on your attention.  Otherwise, your brain just treats those signals as neural junk mail and puts them in the recycle bin unread.  (Caveat: some neurodivergent people have a difficult time pushing these sensations into the background. My pet theory is that physical dysphoria might be worth for neurodivergent individuals because the negative sensations of their wrong-gender body are that much harder to ignore.  But I digress....)

There is one sensation though that even now, always gets noticed.  I call it the cross-body block.  That's when you are trying to reach across your body, from left to right or vice versa.  Your upper arm might brush across the surface of your breast, or even press into the side, pushing the whole boob along with it.  If you do it too hard, or at a time that you're feeling sore, it can even hurt.  Those are the times that I realize most overtly that there be titties amidships.

In fact, it's almost impossible to do anything at all without touching your own breasts.  It's no wonder that cis women become desensitized to it and consider them a normal part of their body, and I'm sure that I'll get there one day myself.  But I've had too many years of male acculturation, where the act of (gasp!) touching a breast was a Big Deal.  Either it was the herald of sexytimes, or else an accident that you had to ignore or stammer out an apology for.  The one thing that touching a breast never, ever was, was _casual_.

But that's the name of the game, now.  You will touch your breasts all the time just as part of interacting with the world.  And the bigger they are, the more they'll interfere .  Like a lapdog with separation anxiety, they are Just. Always. There.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of times my boobs have made themselves known during normal, everyday activities just this week.

- Carrying a large box up a flight of stairs.  No bracing the box on your chest, you've got boobs now.
- Slipping past someone standing in a door.  Lol you misjudged how much room you need; you've got boobs now.
- Being right handed and putting away a dish in a cabinet to your left.  Better turn your torso, darling, you've got boobs now.
- Taking off a tight shirt with no bra underneath. Nice tittydrop, my dear, you've got boobs now.
- Getting bodyslammed by one of your kids while minding your own business on the floor.  I love playing with you, kiddo, but I've got boobs now.
- Scratching your chin or putting on an earring or brushing your hair or doing makeup or washing your face or putting lotion on your neck or anything that involves your forearm entering boobular airspace.  The lightest touch or a mighty whack or a gentle push or a sharp poke, anything that happens in front of your body now has to happen a little bit further away because my sweet naive girl, I don't know how else to tell you, you've got boobs now.

It's honestly pretty great.

And the fact that I can say that is pretty good evidence that I'm a woman.  Gender euphoria doesn't have to come in big lightning blasts.  It can become the background noise of your life, felt unconsciously as part of just living in the world.  But the very sensations that make me feel content in my body are a nightmare for others.  Trans men and some (but not all) non-binary folk experience these sensations as dysphoria instead.  We all deserve a body we feel at home in, and not everyone is lucky enough to have genetics do that for them.  But once more, I digress.

## Get Support

At this point in your day, you've been putting off getting dressed for work long enough.  No more free-boobing it around the house.  Time to put on your bra.

Those of us who grew up with male acculturation probably looked on bras more with an eye toward aesthetics than functionality.  In other words, we thought more about how they looked than what they were for.  And true enough, many bras are meant to be attractive, and some sacrifice functionality for it.  But most bras are not meant to be seen by anyone but the wearer and perhaps a partner.  They have a function, and a useful one at that.

Remember everything I said up above about the way breasts move under your clothes, bounce as you're going up and down stairs, and just basically get in the way?  Well, a bra helps get that under control.  The band fits snugly around your torso, about as tight as a decent watchband and just as easy to ignore after you get used to it.  The cups can have many functions‚Äîkeeping your breasts in place, lifting them up, moving them more towards the front of your chest and away from your armpits, etc.  The straps rest on your shoulders, helping to keep the cups where they're supposed to be and further battening down the hatches of the whole apparatus.

To be honest, wearing a bra can feel like a bit of relief.  While I'll still squish my arms up against my bra while doing everyday activities, and I'll still feel a bit of bounce, the bra keeps things sort of moving as a unit.  A lot of the sensations I described above are dampened by wearing it.  A particularly tight sports bra can almost remove the sense of movement altogether, though at the price of an uncomfortably tight feeling.

I like wearing a bra.  I like the shape I have in my clothes when I wear one.  Once I found one that fit, I could wear it pretty comfortably all day long.  Though admittedly, the later in the day it gets, the more I yearn to take it off.  Here's a good rule of thumb‚Äîyou wear a bra when it's more comfortable to wear one than not wear one; you take it off when it's more comfortable not to wear it than to wear it.

At any rate, you go about your day, rarely thinking about your breasts.  There are moments that it can be hard to remember that your body has changed.  There are moments when you realize that you've been accidentally touching your boobs all day and you never noticed, when the sensation of movement never intruded into your consciousness.  They're just... normal.

But this is not a post about what's normal, but rather the new sensations that you're trying to experience vicariously.  So after a long day, you decide that you're not going out again and can ditch the bra.  Sure, you could take your shirt off first, but why bother?  Just pop open the clasp at the back, pull the straps off your shoulders and down each arm, then pull the bra out the bottom of your shirt.  It's not a magic trick.  It's not showing off.  It's just once less step in getting comfortable.

And oh... there is nothing quite like the feeling of taking off a bra at the end of a long day.  The most acute sensation is a sort of _settling_ as your breasts sort of return to their unbound position.  There is a sense of lightness and heaviness at the same time, if that makes any sense at all.  You feel unrestrainted.  You scratch the itchy places where the bra was pushing into you, especially under the boobs.  Things start to feel normal pretty quickly, but for a few seconds, there is just a bliss of relaxation.

## Winding Down

Time for bed, better brush your teeth.  You dab on some toothpaste, stick the brush in your mouth, lean over the sink and WHOA NELLIE.  I don't think I have found any daily activity that makes me jiggle quite so much as brushing my teeth. We're talking full on, someone-spanked-the-Jello, ought-to-make-a-cartoon-noise wobble.  Maybe it's the back-and-forth motion, or the quick, short strokes.  Whatever it is, if you brush your teeth braless, you will be aware that you have boobs.

Now you settle into bed.  Go ahead and browse Reddit for an hour or so‚Äîyou'll probably be holding the phone in such a way that your wrist and part of your inner arm rests on your breast.  Once you've doomscrolled enough for a weekday, time to get some sleep.  Do you like sleeping on your stomach?  Hope you like two pools of pressure on your upper torso.  Contrary to popular opinion, it is technically possible to have boobs and lie on your stomach.  Boobs are squish, and they will squish out to the sides.  Your weight will compress things and press you into the mattress.  You'll feel this as regions of increased pressure, and depending on how sensitive you are, that may or may not hurt.

For me personally, I've not been a stomach sleeper in a long time, but there are still times you'll want to lie that way.  For example, when I ask my wife to give me a back scratch, I'll lie on my tummy.  You can relieve that pressure by propping yourself up on your elbows and sort of arching your back.  I'm not big enough to need to do that, but it's an option.

Sleeping on your back feels pretty much the same if you stay still.  I'm not large enough for the weight of my breasts to be noticeable when I'm not moving, though larger-breasted women do report pressure.  Normally, large breasts will spread out, so instead of everything resting on the chest, the sides will sort of spread into the area around your armpits.  Personally, I prefer side-sleeping.  You know the hand-on-the-opposite-shoulder pose you often see with corpses?  I've found that to be quite comfortable.  My boobs fit neatly between my arms.  It's like I'm giving them a hug.  It's nice when you're lonely.

And that's it, a day in the life of your boobs.  This may have been way more detail than anyone cared to read, but for anyone out there who always wondered what things felt like, including my own past self, I hope this was enlightening.  Maybe it will help you answer the question of whether you want to start HRT, or even determine whether ""trans woman"" is a label that might apply to you.  If you have experiences of your own to share, or questions to be answered, please don't hesitate to post a reply!

History:

Recently, I have had trouble keeping my BP under control. Back in Jan 2023, I went to a doctors appointment and was told I had a high BP reading (145/90). I had been inactive, suffering from anxiety and burnout, and generally unhealthy at the time, so this was not a surprise to hear. The doctor suggested I purchase an at-home monitoring device and work to lower my blood pressure. Towards this effort, I purchased a withings BP cuff, and tried to reduce my intake of snack foods high in salt and cut back on my caffeine consumption. After a few months, I was able to get consistent readings anywhere from SYS: 110‚Äì124 and DIA: 58‚Äì82. Still not perfect but a lot better. I ended up moving and returned to see a new PCP around 2.5 months ago. During that visit, my blood pressure reading was 157/94 which was alarmingly high. My new doctor suggested I try and work to monitor my blood pressure again, so I have been doing that recently. However, no matter what I do, I cant seem to get my BP back to a lower state. I will provide what I have done, what my lifestyle is like, and would love any suggestions on what I could do. I am uninsured so paying out of pocket for my doctor and specialist to address this is a bit more than I would like to do, but Im also happy to hear that this is something i need to see someone about immediately.

Lifestyle:  
I am moderately active - usually workout 4-5x a week for 2 hours at a time - usually a combination of weightlifting, running, and cardio. I eat moderately healthy though I could be a lot better and have a tendency to snack during the day. Biggest dietary weaknesses are snacking on sweets from the store, cheese and crackers. Other than that I eat a lot of fruit veggie and protein, and limit myself to one caffeinated drink daily (usually coffee in the morning). I usually average between 6-8 hours of sleep a night which isn't great, but I sleep somewhat consistently. My resting heart rate is anywhere from 65-80 during the day, 40-50 while asleep. I have a mostly sedentary life because im mostly at the computer applying for jobs at this point. My watch also measures my stress and usually puts me at a scale of 50/100 during the day.

I wrote this for my doctor who wanted me to fill out some pre-intake forms for a cardiologist, but thought I would post it here too. Like I said, a specialist is a bit expensive so Im hoping theres a lot more i can do to address this.",1,1754684384.0,AskDocs,2,1.0,False
1ml5wnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ml5wnp/rf_dreaming_in_subtitles/,[RF] Dreaming in Subtitles,"They do want to leave. Of course they do. 

Their parents speak in grains: broken, careful, survival-shaped. But the children speak in volume. In swagger. In VJ accents. In the rhythm of TV ads. They mouth phrases from action movies and shampoo commercials. Just chill, bro. Scene on, aunty. They know which words carry status, which syllables make teachers pause. They wield English not like language, but like a key.

They‚Äôve never seen a clear monsoon sky, but they know what ‚Äúsky blue‚Äù looks like on a denim jacket. They know Salman Khan is eternal. That he always survives, no matter how many bullets, scandals, or flops. That he dances like a god and fights like a promise. That his shirt will eventually come off.

It‚Äôs velocity. A hum inside the chest. A restless twitch in the feet that starts when they first learn to spell ""McDonald‚Äôs"" from a plastic tray liner, or when the local single screen plays Laapataa Ladies on a random Friday and the final shot makes them cry, even if they don‚Äôt know why.

Their world is Gali 87‚Äîsheet metal, cracked cable lines, tarpaulin balconies. The slum wraps around them like a second skin. Familiar. It stinks of fried chillies and rusted pipe. They step through puddles without flinching. They know how to hold their breath through gas leaks and funerals. They‚Äôve seen enough power cuts to light candles before the blackout hits.

And they‚Äôre getting smarter. 

Not wise yet. But sharp. Street-cut. One boy knows how to reset a stolen phone‚Äôs SIM lock using only a matchstick and his thumbnail. Another girl reads old Bombay Times clippings under the food cart while waiting to wash dishes. They all have passwords to something they don‚Äôt own.

Some think it‚Äôll be acting school. Or call centers. Or modeling. One girl swears she‚Äôll marry a Dubai man. One boy practices Australian accents after school, standing in front of a cracked mirror with a spoon like a mic. He says he‚Äôll be a pilot, even though he‚Äôs never been on a plane. He‚Äôs learning the names of clouds from a book that smells of mildew. Cumulus. Stratus. Escape.

Their parents smile at this. The kind of smile that holds both blessing and doubt.

They want their children to rise‚Äîbut they fear what leaving means. That forgetting is the price of ascent. That someday their children might speak only English, and never again need to say _gali, mitti, chulha, baarish_.

The kids don‚Äôt care. They already dream in subtitles.

It starts with Mohan.

Fourteen, gelled hair, shoes three sizes too big because he‚Äôs growing fast and doesn‚Äôt plan to stop. He‚Äôs got a scar above his lip from falling off the railway tracks during a game of cricket. Girls say he looks like young John Abraham‚Äîjust the eyes. He doesn‚Äôt deny it.

Mohan finds a flyer on the gate of the local polytechnic. FREE ENGLISH & SOFT SKILLS . TRAINING FOR CALL CENTERS. SALARY 10,000 AND ABOVE.

He tears it down, folds it neatly, carries it like a passport.

The seminar is in a beige classroom with flickering tube lights. A man in a tucked-in polo shirt teaches them to say ‚ÄúGood morning‚Äù like they mean it. They repeat phrases. Thank you for holding, sir. How may I assist you today?

Mohan swells with every word. Not because of what they mean. But because he knows his voice is going somewhere. The words feel like elevator buttons. Floor after floor. Up.

He brings back the phrases to the gali.

Soon everyone‚Äôs practicing. May I place you on hold, madam? they whisper while selling samosas. Your satisfaction is our priority, they recite while hanging laundry. We value your feedback becomes the new neighborhood greeting.

The slang mutates. Hinglish evolves. Load mat le, bro becomes Please bear with me while I escalate this issue. They laugh as they say it. 

Mohan gets a job.

Not in a call center‚Äîyet‚Äîbut at a photocopy shop near Laxmi Nagar Metro. It's owned by a man who once worked tech support in Bangalore, came back with a limp and a vocabulary of half-remembered acronyms. The shop has an old desktop, a laminating machine, and a fan that only works if you kick it.

Mohan learns to use CorelDRAW. Learns to laminate ID cards, to print fake university degrees. Sometimes he prints his own name, just to see it spelled right. MOHAN PRAKASH. GLOBAL EXECUTIVE. Black ink, bold font. He tapes one to the inside of his locker.

He brings the stories back like souvenirs. He tells the others about the girl who paid to print her resume twelve times, changing the email every try. About the customer who asked him to Photoshop out his own wife.

The gali listens.

They sit on rooftops made of leftover doors, feet dangling in the air thick with monsoon heat and the scent of frying pakoras. The boys talk about jobs. The girls, about auditions. Everyone is becoming something else, at least on the weekends.

Radha watches all of this.

She‚Äôs thirteen, elbow-sharp and crow-eyed, with a laugh that cuts through arguments. Her mother calls her meri naak ka nath‚Äîthe jewel of my nose‚Äîbut says it with one hand on her hip and the other swatting flies.

Radha doesn‚Äôt talk big like Mohan. She doesn‚Äôt want a Dubai husband or a call center headset. She wants silence. Space. A room with four walls and a door that locks.

Her escape is subtler.

She finds an old dictionary in the school donation box. Cracked spine. Mustard stains. Inside, someone has underlined only the strange words: serendipity, wanderlust, estranged, incandescence.

She doesn‚Äôt know them yet. But she likes how they feel in her mouth.

She begins to collect words. From textbooks, billboards, TV ads, broken novels missing their last chapters. She writes them on the blank pages of her old notebook with a ballpoint pen. When she runs out of space, she switches to the palms of her hands.

The second rains of the year arrives in July. Too early, too hard.

The gali floods.

Drains back up with dead leaves, gutka packets, and a rat the size of a schoolbag. Water climbs to knee height. The local school closes for two weeks. Electricity sputters in and out like a drunk landlord.

The children wade through it, pants rolled, defiant. They make boats out of milk packets and race them in the street.

But the elders worry.

Mohan‚Äôs mother slips while carrying a gas cylinder and fractures her wrist. Radha‚Äôs roof collapses on one corner. Her schoolbooks soak until the ink bleeds into watercolor.

She saves the dictionary. Dries it page by page over a gas flame.

The water leaves. The mold stays. 

Radha writes her first full sentence in English on the wall of the gali with charcoal from a burnt fence post. It‚Äôs from an old Bollywood dialogue but she switches the ending:

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt underestimate the power of a common girl.‚Äù

The boys laugh. But not cruelly. They ask her what underestimate means. She tells them.

Then asks for five rupees.

Just like that, she becomes a tutor.

Five rupees per word. Ten if you want to know how to pronounce it like the actors.

Sometimes, they climb to the water tower behind the bus depot. It‚Äôs rusted shut, no longer in use, but tall. It‚Äôs the only place in the gali where the sky feels large.

They call it NASA.

From up there, they can see the metro line slicing through Delhi like a silver vein. They imagine themselves riding it‚Äîclean, upright, humming to themselves in earbuds they don‚Äôt yet own.

Mohan points west. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where Gurgaon call centers are.‚Äù

Radha points east. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs where the library should be.‚Äù

The rain begins again. Not heavy. Just enough to remind them the sky still has opinions.They stay there anyway.

Late August brings a whisper.

Someone from the neighborhood‚Äîa cousin‚Äôs friend‚Äôs uncle‚Äîgot a job in Cyber City. Full-time. Voice process. 18,000 per month and free coupons. They say he only wore formal shirts now. They say he used the word schedule like it was natural.

The rumor moves through Gali 87 like warm breeze before a storm. Every boy with a tucked-in shirt walks taller. Every girl with a name that sounds neutral on a resume practices saying it without accent. Rinku becomes Rin. Pawan becomes Paul. Radha doesn‚Äôt change hers‚Äîshe just stops explaining it.

Mohan borrows a dress shirt two sizes too big and takes the metro to apply. The office lobby has air conditioning cold enough to make his teeth ache. The receptionist has French nails and a headset bigger than her bun.

He returns without a job.

But also without shame.

He tells the others. ‚ÄúI just have to knock again.‚Äù

Radha doesn‚Äôt go. She sends an application instead. Typed on a keyboard missing the ‚ÄúL‚Äù key. She replaces every L with a capital I. She doesn‚Äôt notice until after she clicks send.

She doesn‚Äôt get a reply.

But she gets a postcard, weeks later. She tapes it to the inside of her tin trunk.

By October, the sky cracks open‚Äîbriefly.

One day. Just one. The clouds part, shyly. Sunlight spills into the gali like it‚Äôs late to its own party. Walls steam. Dogs roll in the dust. The rain pauses.

For five hours, everything glows.

Kids run barefoot. Women wash sheets and pin them high like flags. Someone blasts music from a dying speaker. Radha lies flat on a rooftop, eyes closed, palms up.

Mohan takes a photo of the sky and sets it as his phone wallpaper like proof of something no one quite believes. The rain returns that night. As if embarrassed for leaving.

Years will pass.

Some will leave.

Mohan will end up in a training center in Noida, then a night shift with free coffee and no overtime. Radha will tutor six children in a flat above a printing press and write sentences on walls that others begin to quote.

Some will stay.

The gali will change. Tiles will become bricks. Tin roofs will give way to something stronger. Wi-Fi will come, late and spotty, and then never leave. A supermarket will rise where the trash lot used to be. No one will remember the day it rained. 

But when the sky splits again‚Äîyears later, in a different October‚Äîsomeone will stand on that same rooftop, look up, and whisper something they learned from an old girl with crow-eyes and pen-stained hands.

Then they‚Äôll put their earbuds in. And keep walking forward.",1,1754684368.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1ml5w5w,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealTechTakes/comments/1ml5w5w/reveal_the_best_vpn_router_performance_with/,Reveal the Best VPN Router Performance with TP-Link ER7206 Review,"Testing out the TP-Link ER7206 has been an eye-opening experience, especially as someone who relies heavily on strong and stable networks for work and leisure. At first glance, this multi-WAN professional wired gigabit VPN router seems like a device aimed squarely at networking enthusiasts and professionals. But after using it daily for weeks, I‚Äôve discovered it‚Äôs a rather practical option for medium to large households or small offices too.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The aesthetic of this device is rather understated‚Äîit doesn‚Äôt scream flashy, but it‚Äôs practical. Its compact size, at just 8.9 x 5.17 x 1.38 inches, means it fits snugly alongside my other electronics without hogging too much space. Weighing just a little over 2 pounds, it feels robust for its size. That said, setting it up can be a bit tricky for someone new to advanced networking equipment like this. I spent some time deciphering how the ports work, but the manual was detailed enough to guide me through. The black color ensures it blends nicely with modern decor, though I‚Äôm more focused on function than aesthetics for these things.

**Features and Network Capacity**  
This router packs a series of features that cater directly to those needing robust networking solutions. One of the standout features is its flexible port configuration. With 1 Gigabit SFP WAN port, 1 Gigabit WAN port, 2 WAN/LAN ports, and 1 LAN port, it offers up to 4 WAN ports. This setup saved me some serious headaches while balancing multiple connections at home. I was curious about TP-Link's claim of supporting a whopping maximum of 150,000 associated client devices and up to 700 users. While I didn‚Äôt have 150,000 devices to connect, I ran it with 22 different gadgets‚Äîincluding smart TVs, phones, laptops, and an overachieving coffee machine‚Äîand it never faltered. 

[Check TP-Link ER7206 price on Amazon.](https://preciseshop.com/p/b08tqn7nmg/)  

**Performance and Speed**  
Its performance has been genuinely impressive. I specifically noticed a significant improvement in speed while streaming ultra-HD movies and conducting video calls simultaneously. Load balancing across the WAN ports ensures that bandwidth usage is optimized, so you don‚Äôt have choke points when several people are connected. VPN setups like LAN-to-LAN IPsec worked without any major hiccups. For someone who‚Äôs not a fan of lag spikes in online gaming or buffering while streaming cricket matches that my family insists on watching, this was a game-changer. 

**Strengths**  
- It offers centralized cloud management via the Omada SDN, allowing you to control network devices from anywhere.  
- Security features like advanced firewall policies, DoS defense, and efficient IP/MAC/URL filtering ensure the network is well-protected.  
- Supports up to 100√ó LAN-to-LAN IPsec and several VPN options, which will appeal to those who take data security seriously.

**Drawbacks**  
- Setting it up initially isn‚Äôt the easiest task for someone with minimal networking knowledge.  
- The cloud-based Omada controller plan details weren't super clear, and digging for that information was a small frustration.  
- Not exactly the most budget-friendly option if you‚Äôre just looking for a basic router.

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing it directly to competitors like the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X or MikroTik‚Äôs hEX S, the TP-Link ER7206 holds up quite well. The EdgeRouter X, for example, matches in offering flexibility, but it lacks the same seamless integration with cloud-based services and the broad VPN capabilities I saw in the TP-Link device. MikroTik stands out for affordability, but the learning curve is even steeper than with the TP-Link. Where the ER7206 excels is in marrying professional-level features with somewhat accessible tools‚Äîcloud management being the absolute cherry on top.

**Quality for Price**  
While not exactly a ‚Äúcheap‚Äù option, the TP-Link ER7206 earns its price tag. The high-speed performance, robust build, and advanced security settings justify spending a little extra, especially for small businesses or tech-savvy households. It delivers long-term value by saving you from interruptions or the need to constantly reset the router. After all, isn‚Äôt that what we ultimately want‚Äîsomething reliable enough to forget about most of the time?

My abuser is out here on YouTube playing the role of ‚Äúmillionaire entrepreneur‚Äù dishing out life advice and selling courses to hundreds. Meanwhile behind the scenes he‚Äôs a broke manipulative narcissist who spent years abusing gaslighting coercing and scamming me.

Let me break down the circus.

I was young independent a model basically the full package. And he loved to brag about me‚Ä¶ but not because he respected me. No he flaunted me like a trophy to his friends saying things like ‚ÄúLook what I‚Äôve got‚Äù as if I was some prize not a person. But behind closed doors? He treated me like garbage.

I had vaginismus and was insecure about it. I was also a virgin. He knew. Still he pressured me nonstop for sex. When I told him I was hurting he dismissed it saying that he just needs to break me in. His exact words? ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the best girl the most beautiful but if the premium coffee shop‚Äôs closed you go to another one that‚Äôs open.‚Äù Yeah he literally compared me to coffee.

And his obsession with backdoor sex? Obsessive. He converted to Islam and cherry-picked rules just to manipulate me. ‚ÄúNo sex during your period it‚Äôs haram‚Äù but backdoor was suddenly okay because his ‚Äúspiritual coach‚Äù said so? Total lies. He used religion as a tool to gaslight and pressure me. I cried so much when I found out that he was lying.

There were times he ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù slipped it in the wrong hole while I was saying no. ‚ÄúOops‚Äù he‚Äôd say acting clueless but I was frozen terrified. It was no accident. It was coercion.

One time he physically pushed me during an argument and claimed it was part of our ‚ÄúBDSM dynamic.‚Äù We never agreed on that. Just another way to twist reality and control me.

When I flew to London as a teenager to see him he isolated me in his friend‚Äôs apartment. Said it was ‚Äútoo dangerous‚Äù for me to go out alone but he was free to run wild with his business buddies. When I had a panic attack from the isolation crying so hard I could barely breathe he left me on the floor and went to a meeting. That was his idea of ‚Äúsupport.‚Äù

Then Bali. After a brutal 60-hour travel nightmare I was exhausted and grumpy like anyone would be. He called me a ‚Äúliability‚Äù to his work partner and threatened to send me home alone. I was exhausted and started crying and said it makes him look bad in public and called me a sexist slur that I cant say here. Oh and he made me pay for everything after promising he‚Äôd cover it.

While in Bali he abused all of his students (starving them and locking them in their rooms if they didnt finish their work, forcing the to waterboard and humiliate them in all the ways possible)

Another time, he took me on a vacation (always waiting for us to be alone) and he pretended to kill himself standing in front of the window dramatically threatening to jump for a solid 15 minutes while I was crying and begging him to come down. Afterwards he started accusing me of being a terrible person because while he was trying to kill himself I was saying I will call my parents and that meant I was only thinking about myself (MIND YOU I WAS 17 I didnt know what else to do besides calling my parents)

He humiliated me in front of his friends too making racist ‚Äújokes‚Äù about me being Romanian saying that I ‚Äúalways go back to my cleaner roots‚Äù when I tried to help set the table. He tore down everything I did. Made him a steak dinner and he trashed the glass the fork the plate all to make me feel small in front of his friends and to show them how I listen to his wishes while saying ‚ÄúLook what I wake up to‚Äù like he owned a trophy

He even scammed me out of my own money in Bali took it promised to pay me back then sent me crumbs and called it ‚Äúproviding.‚Äù I was a teen vulnerable and he used that.

After I finally left he didn‚Äôt move on. He spiraled into alcoholism flew to Romania without telling me stalked me texted my mom drunk after I blocked him because he threatened me, crossing every line imaginable. He couldn‚Äôt handle losing control over me.

So yeah the man selling courses online the ‚Äúself-made millionaire‚Äù you see on camera? That‚Äôs the same man who emotionally abused manipulated sexually coerced isolated scammed humiliated and gaslit me for over a year.

I forgot most of it just trying to survive convincing myself he loved me. But now? I remember. And I‚Äôm done staying silent.

To anyone watching his polished videos thinking ‚ÄúWow he‚Äôs got it together‚Äù just know behind the camera he‚Äôs a coward who built his empire on breaking women and conning people.

He is still scamming young guys but they worship and look up to him too much to ever believe anything I am saying.

1ml5tig,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ml5tig/sf_wormsong/,[SF] Wormsong,"No one came down to Deck C unless something was leaking or dying. Usually both. That was fine by Sol.

His job was simple: clean filters, fix vents, un-gunk hydrolines. The ship‚Äôs name was Parhelion-6, but everyone just called it the Ark. Two centuries into a 400-year drift to some maybe-habitable star, and it still smelled like aluminum, old socks, and filtered breath.

Sol wasn‚Äôt bitter. Not anymore. Bitterness took energy, and the Ark didn‚Äôt give you much of that.

Every morning he filled his thermos with nutrient broth and slung his toolkit over one shoulder. His boots echoed hollow down the underdeck corridors where no sunlight simulators reached. He liked it here. It was quiet. Forgotten.

Then came the day he found the worm.

It happened while fixing a leak behind Tank 4B, a hydroponics reserve no one had touched since before he was born. A cracked pipe had soaked through the soil trays. Most were long dead‚Äîjust chalky roots and dry pebbles. But one had sagged open under the weight of time.

Inside: movement.

Tiny. Glossy. Alive.

At first he thought it was wiring. Then it curled.

A worm.

An earthworm.

Sol crouched there for a long time, watching it twist slowly through the muck. He hadn‚Äôt seen a real animal in his life. Nothing with a heartbeat that hadn‚Äôt come from a vat.

He scooped it up in a cracked food tray and carried it back to his quarters. The room was barely big enough to lie down in. But he lined a drawer with moss scraps from Hydroponics Beta, added some nutrient jelly, and laid the worm gently inside.

He named it Root.

For the first time in years, Sol skipped his evening vidlogs. He watched Root instead‚Äîwatched it move like thought made visible.

He started reading. Old files. Agrarian databases from the ship‚Äôs original archives. He learned about loam, microbiomes, ecosystems. About how one worm could change the structure of soil, aerate it, feed it, make it sing with possibility.

Root wasn‚Äôt just alive. Root was a chance. It changed everything.

In the weeks that followed, Sol began smuggling soil samples from dead hydro bays. He mixed compost using scraps from the kitchen deck‚Äîcoffee grounds, starch peels, algae skins. Root thrived.

So did Sol.

People noticed. Not the worm‚Äînot at first. Just that Sol had a spring in his step. That he hummed. That he said hello. He even started helping on Deck A again. The teachers were surprised‚Äîno one had asked him for anything in years.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs gotten into you?‚Äù one of them asked.

Sol only smiled. ‚ÄúJust a project.‚Äù

Then came the fire.

A short in one of the ventilation fans lit up a compost bin on Deck B. Sol was on shift. He saw the smoke first. Sounded the alarm. Put it out before it spread.

In the aftermath, while officials fussed and protocols rebooted, someone found the worm. It wasn‚Äôt a crisis. Not exactly. But it wasn‚Äôt nothing.

Sol was summoned to the Bridge. First time in his life. The Commander sat stiffly behind a desk made from old hull scrap. Her expression was unreadable.

‚ÄúYou found a non-synthetic organism on board,‚Äù she said.

Sol nodded. ‚ÄúYes, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd you didn‚Äôt report it?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, ma‚Äôam.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù

He hesitated. ‚ÄúBecause I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd understand.‚Äù

She raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúTry me.‚Äù So he did. Quietly. Steadily. Just the truth.

He told her how the ship‚Äôs soil had long since gone sterile. How the synthetic nutrient systems were holding, but barely. How the early plans had included living ecosystems, but had been abandoned two generations ago. How this worm, this tiny forgotten creature, had survived in dead soil and could teach them how to grow again. Not just food. Earth.

She didn‚Äôt interrupt. Not once.

When he finished, she sat in silence.

Then she asked, ‚ÄúDo you still have it?‚Äù

He blinked. ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúShow me.‚Äù

So he did. He took her to his little room. Showed her the drawer. Showed her Root. She looked down for a long time. Then said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll need a team.‚Äù

Two months later, Deck C wasn‚Äôt forgotten anymore. They built new soil beds with composted insulation and algae mulch. Sol taught the kids how to layer food scraps, how to keep the mix breathing. They built small test gardens: peas, mustard greens, even tomatoes if the lighting held.

Root became Roots, and then Rootlings. The biology team tracked microbial growth for the first time in a century.

Someone painted a mural of Sol on the hallway wall, surrounded by earth and worms and little green shoots. He hated it, at first. But Lou‚Äîthe muralist‚Äîsaid, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt about you. It‚Äôs about us, now.‚Äù He couldn‚Äôt argue with that. 

There were still breakdowns. Still nights when the heat dipped or the algae vats overflowed. The journey to the new planet stretched ahead like a question without punctuation.

But there was also something else now. Something small and breathing.

Something that tunneled through the dark, aerated the compacted spaces, and left behind the quiet, holy promise of growth. Sol stood one morning beside a new seedling, a real tomato vine curling under warm lights. He touched the soil gently. It crumbled in his hand‚Äîdark, living, clean.

Behind him, the kids laughed over compost jokes. Someone tuned a guitar. Someone else read aloud from a gardening manual as if it were scripture. The ship still hummed with the same tired engines. But now it carried more than people. Now it carried a future.",1,1754684154.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False
1ml5sip,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ml5sip/spending_5000_monthly_but_cant_identify_where/,"Spending $5,000 monthly but can't identify where money goes - need help creating visibility into expenses","I'm really struggling with this and starting to think I'm just bad with money. I make decent income but somehow spend around $5,000 every month on what feels like ""normal stuff"" - food, rent, commuting, nothing crazy. But I'm always broke by month-end.

My confusion:

Everything seems essential:

\- Need car for work commute

\- Need to eat (obviously)

\- Normal coffee/lunch breaks

\- Basic living expenses

I've tried budgeting spreadsheets but can't figure out what to actually cut since everything feels necessary.

My questions:

\- Does anyone else feel like their money just... disappears?

\- How do you figure out where you're actually overspending when everything seems normal?

\- Is there a better way to track spending than spreadsheets? (I always forget to update them)

\- At what point do you realize the problem isn't your income, but your spending awareness?

I'm starting to think the issue isn't that I don't make enough - it's that I have no visibility into where it actually goes. But I don't know how to fix this without feeling like I'm depriving myself of basic needs.

1ml5rlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/credit_cards/comments/1ml5rlq/is_freedom_unlimited_worth_getting_for_everyday/,Is Freedom Unlimited worth getting for everyday spending?,"Tried the Freedom Unlimited for the first time last month after my old debit card got cloned and I decided to finally separate daily spending from my main account. I‚Äôve never really used credit cards seriously before, just had one for emergencies, but this time I wanted something that could give me a little back without feeling like a hassle to manage.

The card came in pretty quick (like 4 days), and I started using it for just normal stuff, groceries, coffee, gas, even a few random Amazon orders. Nothing crazy. What surprised me most is how fast the cashback added up. I think I spent around $1,100 for the month (normal stuff, no big purchases) and I already saw a solid amount sitting in my cashback balance. That 1.5% on everything adds up way faster than I thought, especially when you're not chasing categories or doing mental math.

I also like that it doesn‚Äôt make me think too much. Just swipe and earn. The app is clean and shows rewards right away, and I set up auto-pay so I don‚Äôt mess anything up. I‚Äôm trying to build better habits with money and this feels like a decent step. No annual fee either, so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm under pressure to ‚Äújustify‚Äù having the card.

Kinda curious though, do most people use this card just for the flat 1.5%, or is there a smarter way to mix it with other Chase cards for better rewards? I keep hearing about these Chase trifectas but haven‚Äôt looked into it much yet. Anyone here using it as their main card long term?",1,1754684031.0,credit_cards,1,1.0,False

I F(26) swear, leaving the house has turned into a luxury hobby. A pint in my local? ¬£6.90. A concert ticket? ¬£70+. Edinburgh Fringe shows? Standard price seems to now ¬£15+. Chips and a kebab last night? ¬£11.95. Coffee ¬£4+ 

I get prices have gone up for everything so I know it‚Äôs not easy for businesses but it just feels unsustainably high and often the quality is missing.

I love running / hiking so will try spend my weekend doing that so I‚Äôve less temptation to spend. I meal plan as much as possible, bring lunch to the office and have a coffee machine at home so I‚Äôm less tempted to buy one out. But most weeks I still struggle to meet my ¬£125/week budget (covering food, weekly transport, entertainment, eating out, and shopping). I thought that was a fairly decent budget, but lately it just doesn‚Äôt stretch far enough and it‚Äôs starting to make me feel guilty about spending on anything fun. 

Having said that I feel incredibly privileged to even have disposable income but when friends, colleagues and everyone around me seem to always spending on doing things, it‚Äôs hard not to compare and then also not look ‚Äústingy‚Äù myself. Any budget hacks to keep me on track?

Also I am keen to hear from an economic perspective that surely there has to be a point where prices slow down because people buy less but that doesn‚Äôt seem to be happening recently.
