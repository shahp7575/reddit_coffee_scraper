1mxe1vz,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mxe1vz/manuka/,Manuka,"He answered our prayers during the dust bowl. Our town suffered as most did in Kansas. My parents moved out here when they found out I was on the way: caught up in the great wave of folks beckoned by the cheap land. My dad staked ours, set up a shack to live in, and cleared our families path. Not long after they found themselves a schedule: he would get up at 4am every morning, have coffee at the diner until 6, work in the fields for 12 hours, then rest. Mom did everything else. And that‚Äôs how life went on, not even tripped up when I was born. The dirty thirties; however, laid us flat.

It's known how the story of the dust bowl goes. Farmers over cultivated their lands with unhealthy practices, in the hopes they‚Äôd have enough product to compensate for the depression. Our town was no different, and in retaliation, fate dwindled our crops and gutted the yield. The plants were sad and sickly: dwarfen corn on brittle brown stalks, stingy soy and pinto beans. We seemed to harvest as much rotten produce as the salvageable stuff. The fowl piles grew in multiplicity and stature, too much at one time to prepare for composting.

We prayed every lull in time we came across. On days when dad had to come in from the field early: dust caked into every nook in his face, an involuntary moment of silence came over us. There was a storm that lasted for days, with an occasional forty-five minutes until the next wave would barrel towards us. The night that it ended, it was an hour after dusk when it just fizzled away. Its tirade evidenced by our half buried porch, orange film on our windows, a ramp over the neighbors cattle fence, and him.¬†

We were in the living room, a light, silent celebration of the break in the storm. That‚Äôs where we felt him. It was like taking a step with no stairs to catch our foot. At the drop of a pin something fell through us, a physical hollowing in our bodies, but also an emotional longing to fill that void. It beckoned us to look outside.

The crimson moon, bloodshot from the dust laced sky, permitted and reduced our witnessing of his only visit. The transit told of his appearance: the lighting, too inadequate to reveal greater details. What could be seen is his overzealous height. Emphasis given to the two visible, spindly appendages that made up three quarters of his body. He lumbered slowly towards us, the joints connecting the limps to the torso judged out drastically with every step: like popping an arm in and out of its socket. His torso dipped down between the limbs for a short distance before ending at an amputated stump. The core of the torso being vase shaped, bottled necking, then stretching into a thin plateau. If the plateau was a head, it laid flat like a crocodiles: structures branched out of either side, with a privity in sprawling upwards. The thick trunks closest to the body, wisping out into oblivion as its girth frittered.¬†

Moonlight shown through momentary vacancies in his body, blips of light that would flicker within his shadow, promptly filling back in. A hazy, hardly rendered web of flowing tendrils trailed off his center mass, riding along the thinning air. It could‚Äôve been our bodies giving into our minds desire to watch, neglecting our increasing need for air, but it felt as though the room became a vacuum in his wake. The whistle of the late storm's wind as it channeled through the ill fitted wood: had long since died down, now non-existent. Nothing made a sound in his presence.

He stood between our furthest fields, among the numerous and now embarrassing rot piles. A shameful representation of our inadequacies, laid out beneath him. From behind him rose two appendages, two obscure sticks, manifesting into tangible structures once they swung over his body. Their additional height now doubled his, but just for a moment, before they collapsed: buckingly halfway up, the heavy top coming down fast.¬†

They didn‚Äôt meet the ground with a thud, instead a hydraulic, slow approach. Long thin rods hoisted up by beams no thicker, resting on either side of the neck. The ends met our filth piles, he began to draw them in. The limbs, like two chopsticks, squeezing towards each other. When they rose again, a wad of cultivated death was held in their grasp. It swung back over his body, and disappeared behind his shadow.

It‚Äôs as if the moon turned down the lights as he left, obscured to the point of his form being nothing more than an afterimage. As he dwindled away, the rest of the world returned, all except for the storms. We heard the wind, gentle and whispering, the crickets, then our breath.¬†

¬†Not a word was said that night, not out of bewilderment; it would‚Äôve been unnecessary to do so. Words would be needed for someone who didn‚Äôt see him: we felt our explanation. Once the spell was lifted it felt like we had gained fifty-pounds; an intense exhaustion followed. Although I don‚Äôt imagine any of us slept; a part of us still watching from the window. We didn‚Äôt talk at breakfast either, our faces may have worn an expression commonplace in the 30s, but our eyes were coated with a photographic cataract, a picture of him. The first word spoken that day was from my father when his distant howler, and footsteps grew louder, puttering in the dustfall that still blanketed our land. Mom and I, cleaning the grime off our porch, looked up to see a traditionally silent and unenergetic man: waving, panting, and yelling about something in the field.

We took off in his direction, when we met him, his breathless gasps couldn‚Äôt carry any words, so he turned and ran back the way he came. When we made it to the scene, he hunched over his knees, spitting and coughing: the sounds of an aging man using his body in a way he hadn‚Äôt in years. His fit became an afterthought when we made sense of the display. Where a graveyard of rotten plants stood days before, no longer had a trace of the useless matter. In its spot were numerous perfectly bundled stacks of: corn, soybeans, and wheat. They were radiant, nearly a manufactured perfection: large ears, vibrant colors, a sweet aroma. All the piles were like this, and they would be for every day to come, as long as we left something in exchange.

1mxe16h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CaregiverSupport/comments/1mxe16h/i_feel_like_im_drowning/,I feel like I‚Äôm drowning!,"I am caregiver for my mother, it seems odd that I as her only son is the one taking care of her when I have three sisters but they refuse to take the responsibility, so that just leaves me. I rarely get any time to myself except after bed time and I have no friends currently because I don‚Äôt get out much, if fact its getting to where the only free time I have is when I have a doctors appointment. I love my mother, however I struggle greatly with the way she communicates. She has a tendency to drone on and on and on, and then gets upset with me when I tell her that she‚Äôs been going on long enough that I even forgot what she was talking about saying we rarely talk. I try to explain to her that if the conversation wasn‚Äôt all one sided I would probably talk to her all day if she wanted. To which she drags up one long explanation I gave to a question she had as me doing the same thing. With everything being done online lately I find myself several times a day trying to figure out what she messed up because she cant log into her bank or credit card accounts. Why she needs to check each account several times a day I have no Idea. On top of taking care of her, I‚Äôm also responsible to keep the vehicles running, the yard taken care of and repairs around the house, then theres the dogs! One thinks he owns everything and is constantly barking at the other two, despite having his voice box no longer working, it‚Äôs more like a forced cough rather than a bark. One of the others barks like a maniac every time someone walks by on the sidewalk or there is a dog on tv. The third is the biggest despite being only 2 years old, and he loves to pick on the other two. I get one to stop acting like an idiot and one of the others two takes advantage, its never ending!! Today, as I was trying to wake up drinking my morning coffee my mother hit me with a long list of stuff she wanted me to help with, and despite me trying to explain that I mentally wasn‚Äôt ready to deal with any of it, continued to go down her list of things she wanted help with then didn‚Äôt understand when I got upset and tried to explain to her that I was absorbing none of it and the more she went on the less I remember, but then continued to drone on about what she needed. When I finally got her to stop so I could take a beat and wake up she handed me this huge pile of paperwork and was like here, I wrote it all down‚Ä¶.. now she is brooding in her chair feeling unloved because I asked her to let me wake up first, nicely the first time, then progressively more aggressively as she continued to drone on after being asked nicely to wait. She claims we never talk anymore and I try to explain that me listening to her drone on is not us talking, it‚Äôs her talking! All I want is some time to myself every once in a while, and for her to realize that if she really wanted to talk to someone, she has a phone and three daughters, 5 sisters, and several friends that she could call and talk too, I am not the only one! She complains that we never go anywhere but then most people say we‚Äôre never home when they drive by. I go out to the garage to work on something and 30 minutes later she‚Äôs at the garage door checking to see if Im okay, we watch the same show several times a week but she swears its brand new just out today, until I can describe to her screen by scene what happens next. What makes it so very hard is that i myself am disabled, my disabilities are mental and keeps me from holding down a job and honestly I shouldn‚Äôt be the one sibling who takes care of her. I feel like Im closing down and becoming less me every day. I feel alone and overwhelmed and instead of a helping hand I get compliments. I don‚Äôt need compliments, I need a floatation device to keep my head above the water!!",1,1755886504.0,CaregiverSupport,0,1.0,False

33 y/o guy with a cute smile (have been told so) with a career in tech ( but not a tech bro ), a calm presence with a life that has been a wild adventure of extremes, I thrive on intellectual chaos. I like to read, anything everything from systems theory to modern french history, particularly energy and clean (it‚Äôs one of my passion). After taking a break from dating, I am giving it a one more shot

**What I‚Äôm Looking For:**

A **childfree, progressive partner** who sees life as a playground of possibilities, not a checklist. Someone unapologetically herself‚Äîsexually liberated, intellectually fearless, and allergic to societal scripts. Let‚Äôs skip the small talk and dissect the big questions: How do we live ethically in a burning world? Can love exist without ownership?

**Why We Might Click:**

* **Staunchly Childfree :** I don‚Äôt want kids (ever), both for personal freedom and because bringing new life into an overburdened world feels tragically naive. Let‚Äôs channel that energy into activism, art, or adventure instead.
* **You crave depth :** My attachment style is securely rooted. I‚Äôm here for mutual growth, not games. Whether we‚Äôre debating moral gray zones or testing new boundaries in the bedroom, I value curiosity over judgment.
* **You‚Äôre a shapeshifter :** Artist, scientist, activist, hedonist.... you refuse to be boxed in. Bonus if you‚Äôve got stories from living unconventionally or a passion project that keeps you up at night.
* **You laugh easily :** My humor leans dry, my vibe is warm, and I‚Äôll absolutely lean into the absurdity of dating via Reddit posts

\*\*The Vibe:\*\*Imagine slow mornings with coffee and *Sapiens* debates, weekends volunteering at climate marches or getting lost in a neon-lit bar abroad. I‚Äôm driven but not ruthless, my version of ‚ÄúMachiavellian‚Äù is designing a life that‚Äôs sustainable, joyful, and defiantly *ours*. Let‚Äôs be catalysts, not conformists.( I don't have any societal morality )

Most of the time has been in Ibagu√©, Tolima.

I'm amazed it hasn't hit the tourist radar/grabbed the attention of people that are bored of Medellin.

Ibagu√© has an amazing climate, unbelievable gastronomy, epic mountains and other beautiful nature spots, wonderful hiking routes, much safer than a lot of other cities, and is soooooo much cheaper than Medellin, Bogot√°, etc. The wider Tolima area is also rather special in terms of biodiversity.

Weirdly, tourists and expats haven't yet made it down here, despite it only being three hours from Bogot√°, and the perfect spot if you're travelling from Bogot√° to the coffee region (or the other way).

I'm not a betting man, but I would be confident throwing down a fair slice that within the next 2-3 years Ibagu√© will be the place people are talking about.

1mxdqqr,https://i.redd.it/sr0pwb1b1mkf1.jpeg,"In 1965, a Scottish man named Angus Barbieri didn't eat for 1 year and 17 days. He lived entirely off his excess body fat and vitamins, ultimately losing 276 pounds with seemingly no adverse effects. He only pooped once every 40 to 50 days.","In the mid-1960s, a 456-pound man named Angus Barbieri went without food for 382 days straight in a medically supervised diet designed to help him lose weight. In addition to drinking black coffee, tea, and sparkling water, he was prescribed multivitamins ‚Äî including potassium, sodium, and yeast ‚Äî to compensate for the lack of nutrients. Shockingly, Barbieri not only survived the diet but was able to achieve his ideal weight. By the end of his fast, he had lost 276 pounds, reaching his goal weight of 180 pounds, and he managed to keep most of the weight off afterward. And at the time of Barbieri's death in 1990, he had only gained back 16 pounds.

1. **Caffeine in waves, not floods** \- sip coffee slowly instead of chugging.
2. **Pomodoro method** \- 25 min work, 5 min stretch.
3. **Snack smart** \- nuts, fruit, or granola > candy crash at 3AM.

1mxdo7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1mxdo7t/resignation_due_to_various_reasons_lateral/,"Resignation due to various reasons, lateral probation policy.","Hello everyone, I am here to lay out a few things that have occurred during my onboarding process with a medium sized municipal FD in the South East.  I was hired as a lateral fire fighter with 3 years of experience and all of the required certs expected of a 3rd year rookie. 

This morning, after a long night of reflection and discussion with my family I resigned during my 3rd day of orientation.  I am very upset with myself for not having a ‚Äútough it out‚Äù mind set and I have been dealing with a great deal of anxiety due to my decision to resign.  I could use some advice and any suggestions from my seniors. 

So there are two reasons why I decided to leave this department.  One is medical and the other is policy related. 

1.5 years ago I resigned from my position as a full time firefighter in a rural department after herniating 3 discs in my lower back twice within 6 months. The pain was excruciating and possibly the worst thing I‚Äôve ever went through.   The second time was far worse resulting in me losing consciousness and vomiting when I was insured. Anyway the last few days of driving two hours a day, and being very active with boots and bunker gear has aggravated my spinal injury.  .I have done my best to mitigate it but it has been inadequate. I elected to not have a surgery in lieu of PT after hearing horror stories from other fire fighters.   This was a toss up as to whether or not I would be able to meet the expectations of the department. If I am having weakness and pain now, how am I going to be after a  busy 24?  Am I going to be explaining to my coworkers wife that I couldn‚Äôt save her husband because I was my spinal injury was not as healed as I thought. I know that‚Äôs an extreme, but it could happen.  Again this is a huge ? But I am looking long term here, if I need to get this surgery and I can recover in 12 weeks and be back in action 6 months from the surgery I will do it!

The other reason is that I was not told I would be a rookie/recruit with 7 months of not being able to sit down on recliners, or watch TV during downtime and also be mandated to secure my personal phones in my vehicle for the entirety of my 24, and no tobacco use for 24. Amongst other rookie probie policy that are isolating, I‚Äôm not opposed to proving myself and pulling my weight, coffee, dishes, and whatnot‚Ä¶but I was under the impression that my experience and certifications were worth something and I would be treated like an adult. I mean, I‚Äôve never heard of a 24 hour personal phone restriction‚Ä¶ I am a 38 year old, single, homeowner with a daughter and a puppy doing the best I can and I am not able to meet the departments extremely rigid expectations after reviewing the policy yesterday. This feels like less of a lateral and more of a start from scratch and be treated like a child after reading page one stating ‚Äúyou are a recruit, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you have 30 years of experience, act like it.‚Äù I was very confused. Is this type of stuff normal for someone in my position?  It seems miserable and I decided to walk away before I even started. I kept the reasoning brief and professional. Honest, the entire process was a cluster fuck from not having bunker gear to issue or fitting uniforms to finding out that the department doesn‚Äôt pay into Social Security 2 weeks after accepting and has a fairly unrealistic expectation for adults with families. 

This has turned into more of a rant and an opportunity to vent, but I need to know if this is how it is everywhere or is this a rare occurrence. Thank you guys and girls. ",3,1755885708.0,Firefighting,6,1.0,False

I had some savings from birthdays and part time gigs, but I used them wherever I felt like using them, never really tracking them. And my friends too did that, so I thought it was okay, nobody at that age really tracked their money.¬†

But then when I started college, it struck me that I was just mindlessly spending like I used to in high school, I was just ordering food a few times a week, taking Uber instead of taking a bus, coffee with friends. But I remember there was a month in my first sem I checked my balance halfway through the month, and it was almost zero. And rent was coming next month to pay, groceries too

And I was stressed that month, then I paid somehow. But that month was the end of ignorance, I started calculating my spending then on and cut down on things I didnt really need, like started meal prepping instead of Chipotle or ordering online, started walking or taking the bus instead of Uber. Started budgeting and building credit on Fizz, started visiting Walmart more to get items cheaply.¬†

That‚Äôs when I started getting better with my money and in life in general. That realisation was necessary for me at that time, I needed that and got it. Improving in life is very important. And I‚Äôve been trying to get better at every aspect of life.¬†

‚∏ª

Sharing this because I wish someone had told me early on.

When Towerbound took off, after 10 so so books, I thought I‚Äôd just be writing all day. Instead, I found out success means doubling as my own publisher‚Äîand I happen to love both sides of it. (Yes, I‚Äôm that weirdo who gets the same dopamine hit from tweaking metadata as I do from writing boss fights.)

A lot of people have been asking me how I‚Äôm managing success. The short answer is: if you‚Äôre self-published and you actually hit that point where you can quit your job, you‚Äôll probably discover a big cliff. Writing isn‚Äôt enough anymore. You also have to run the business side. And I don‚Äôt just mean tinkering with Facebook ads‚ÄîI mean everything from contracts to covers to launch timing.

For me, that part has always been fun. I‚Äôve loved marketing and sales ever since I was a kid, and it was actually my main job before I became a writer. So when I crossed that cliff, I didn‚Äôt see it as ‚Äúugh, extra work,‚Äù I saw it as another sandbox I already liked playing in. That makes me weirdly lucky, because I know a lot of authors absolutely hate that side of things.üòÜ

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned:

How to Use the Double-Fuel Brain Without Burning Out

If you love both writing and marketing/sales, here‚Äôs the play:
	‚Ä¢	Separate your fuels. Writing time runs on deep-focus energy. Marketing runs on quick-hit dopamine. Keep them apart in your day so one doesn‚Äôt cannibalize the other. (Translation: don‚Äôt edit chapter 12 and then immediately try to write ad copy‚Äîyou‚Äôll hate both and probably your coffee too.)
	‚Ä¢	Stack the wins. When you finish a chapter, don‚Äôt crash. Switch gears and knock out a quick promo task. It feels like riding momentum instead of draining it.
	‚Ä¢	Mini-boss approach. Treat business tasks like side quests. ‚ÄúUpload this file,‚Äù ‚Äútweak this blurb,‚Äù ‚Äúfire off this email‚Äù‚Äîthey‚Äôre small XP bumps that feed into the main campaign. Plus, unlike actual bosses, they don‚Äôt crit you for 80% of your health.
	‚Ä¢	Guardrails, not walls. Don‚Äôt delegate what you enjoy. Just set limits so the ‚Äúfun‚Äù doesn‚Äôt eat your sleep.

That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve kept moving without burning out: I‚Äôm not forcing myself into a role I hate. I‚Äôm feeding both halves of the brain that actually like this game‚Äîone half obsessed with the story, the other half poking at the machine that gets the story into people‚Äôs hands.

Yeah, I personally have both sides of my brain firing all the time with this, but I know a lot of you don‚Äôt. üòÄ
That doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt succeed. What it does mean is if you can lean into it a little, and stop thinking of it as ‚ÄúI hate this part of being an author,‚Äù it can actually turn into a rewarding effort.

P.S. How do the rest of you real authors handle it? And when I say real, I don‚Äôt mean you need sales to validate you. I mean anyone who‚Äôs giving it a genuine shot. If you‚Äôre treating it like more than just a hobby, regardless of what your sales are, then in my mind‚Äîyou‚Äôre a real author.

I‚Äôm based in India and ordered 1kg of Savorworks Riverdale beans. Roast date was 31st July, I received it around 6‚Äì7th August. I rested it 4‚Äì5 days and started using around 11‚Äì12th August.

For the first few brews it was fine (AeroPress, French press), but in the last week the coffee has gone completely off. The smell is honestly disgusting now ‚Äì sharp, unpleasant, almost rotten. When brewed, it tastes undrinkable (like sour/bitter piss). I‚Äôve barely used 200‚Äì225g, and the rest of the 1kg is just sitting there.

I stored it in its original sealed bag (with one-way valve), kept indoors in a dry cupboard ‚Äì no exposure to sunlight or fridge/freezer. Still, it‚Äôs become unbearably bad in less than 3 weeks.

I tried contacting Savorworks via mail and WhatsApp for a replacement, but no reply at all. I‚Äôm really disappointed because I spent ‚Çπ2100 and now can‚Äôt drink it.

So my questions:
	1.	Has anyone faced this with Savorworks beans before?
	2.	Is this a storage/moisture issue, or did I just get a bad batch?
	3.	Should I push harder for a replacement or just accept this as lost?

I've monitored the live data and the long fuel trim sits at 29.7 at idle. Once I give it throttle the fuel trims stay within +/- 10 trim level. I decelerate and it rough idles as the LTFT goes back up to 29.7. Also has a pretty long crank until it starts. I've check for vacuum leaks (couldn't find any), cleaned the throttle bottle, watched EGR data (seems to function properly), check and cleaned the PCV, cleaned MAF sensor, EVAP valve works fine, fuel pressure reads as fine haven't tested it with a pressure gauge yet.

Here is the kicker a few weeks ago my truck almost died while stopping at a stop sign. I was able to limp it home. Based off having no engine light and the truck losing power, I change the fuel filter. Filter looked like coffee was coming out of it. After that truck ran fine for a few weeks. One day the P0171 comes on and start getting a rough idle and the high long fuel trim. Any ideas? Obviously if I can't find any fix I'll take it to a shop. 

I was thinking of switching the O2's sensors to see if that changes anything because at one point I had a P2196 code as well saying that the O2 sensor on bank 1 was signal bias/stuck rich put fuel treatment in and did all the above mentioned stuff. Cleared the code and the P2196 hasn't come back. With it just being a bank 1 issues I'm thinking fuel injectors or O2 sensor?

Step up is tough but really enjoying how much more responsibility I get and how all the stuff I hated about being a medical SHO has just disappeared. 

When I ask for things to be done they get done quickly. Other specialties are extremely helpful. I feel generally much more respected by colleagues. ICU / surgery / ED / other medical specialties are all working with me. Consultants and other regs buy me coffee!!!

Really enjoy working with more junior colleagues and helping them. Enjoy supervising them for procedures and giving them experience in resus etc. 

It is tough in many ways (often I feel when no one knows what to do in a situation even if it's non-clinical) it becomes my problem, but I work with other regs who really help me. I also feel like I'm learning so much every single shift. 

It is a massive shame that you basically have to wait a minimum of 4 years before getting to this point after graduating. I'm sure eventually the novelty wears off but I think it's important to share this. IMT is a rubbish training programme but there is some light at the end of the tunnel.

Today I found a raccoon foothold trap on our property, that my cats could have severely gotten hurt from.

I‚Äôve been dabbling into fragrances for a while and built up a collection. I thought I‚Äôd share my experiences so far, rate them, and hopefully get some guidance on what to try next.

Here‚Äôs how my journey has gone:

# The Misses & Forgettables

* **Park Avenue Samurai ‚Äì 3/10** ‚Üí Sharp, synthetic, and not pleasant on my skin. Almost gives me a headache.
* **Fastrack Pulse ‚Äì 2/10** ‚Üí Opens with a quick burst of citrus, then immediately turns into dirty, sweaty soil. Worst offender.
* **WS Forest Spice ‚Äì 3/10** ‚Üí Starts minty, but within minutes I can‚Äôt even tell what it smells like. Just fades into nothingness.
* **Maison Alhambra Porto Neroli ‚Äì 4/10** ‚Üí Supposed to be a freshie, but vanishes within 5 minutes. Currently letting it mature in hopes it changes.
* **Park Avenue Harmony ‚Äì 4.5/10** ‚Üí Way too much alcohol blast, feels cheap and generic.

# Average But Wearable

* **Djokr Marine  ‚Äì 5.5/10** ‚Üí Similar DNA to Rasasi Hawas, but watered down. Serviceable, but not exciting. meesho hawas clone
* **Roadster by the Sea ‚Äì 6/10** ‚Üí Smells unique and salty, but the longevity is terrible. Could have been great.
* **Denver Hamilton ‚Äì 6/10** ‚Üí Projects like a beast for 15 mins, then settles into a very generic scent.
* **Yardley Gentleman Classic ‚Äì 6.5/10** ‚Üí Old-school gentlemanly vibe. Once the alcohol burns off, it‚Äôs classy but doesn‚Äôt stand out.
* **Frence Essence Triumph Men ‚Äì 5.5/10** ‚Üí Smells fine, but so generic it gets lost in the crowd.
* **Mast & Harbour Aqua ‚Äì 6/10** ‚Üí Citrus opening is very refreshing, but dries down to something very forgettable.
* **Blue by Ahmed ‚Äì 5.5/10** ‚Üí Smells like rotten lemons on me, probably a bad batch. Decent performance though.

# Decent Daily Wears

* **Dominax Homme ‚Äì 6.5/10** ‚Üí Powdery and a bit dated, but I actually enjoy that vibe. Feels cozy.
* **Lattafa Najdia ‚Äì 7/10** ‚Üí Hawas-style scent with fruity freshness. Smells good, but projection & longevity are almost non-existent.
* **Urban Ranger (Pantaloons) ‚Äì 7/10** ‚Üí Simple, pleasant, and wearable. Great for casual settings.
* **WS Intense Ocean ‚Äì 7/10** ‚Üí Makes me feel refreshed and clean. Good for gym or hot days.
* **WS Code Iridium ‚Äì 7/10** ‚Üí Nice balanced scent. Even pulled me a random compliment.
* **WS Code Acqua ‚Äì 7/10** ‚Üí I like the aquatic vibe, but performance isn‚Äôt good.
* **WS Hydra Energy ‚Äì 6/10** ‚Üí Big burst of freshness that feels energetic, but dies within an hour.
* **WS Ammo ‚Äì 5/10** ‚Üí Good smell, but not versatile. Can‚Äôt find an occasion where it really shines.
* **WS Code Terra ‚Äì 5/10** ‚Üí Feels like a muted version of Fattan, plus a bad atomizer makes it worse.

# Pleasant Surprises

* **WS Code Steel ‚Äì 8/10** ‚Üí Surprisingly nice fragrance, people around me loved it. A proper compliment-getter for the price.
* **WS Ultra Sensual ‚Äì 7.5/10** ‚Üí Despite a harsh synthetic opening, the dry down is addictive. Wish it lasted longer.
* **Whisky Smoke Original ‚Äì 7.5/10** ‚Üí Strong, long-lasting, and has that smoky charm. Great for its price.
* **Whisky Smoke Bourbon ‚Äì 6/10** ‚Üí Similar to Noir en Leather but more synthetic. Still good, especially when layered with Khamrah.
* **Pendora Scents Noir en Leather ‚Äì 7.5/10** ‚Üí Boozy leather with character. Also need more time for leather scents to grow on me.

# The Big Ones ‚Äì My Favorites

* **Wild Stone Edge ‚Äì 9/10** ‚Üí This one is a beast in my budget category. Fetched me the most complements.
* **Fattan ‚Äì 8.5/10** ‚Üí Deep, masculine, and bold. Doesn‚Äôt get me compliments, but it‚Äôs the one I wear *for myself*. Makes me feel happy.
* **Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa ‚Äì 9/10** ‚Üí When I first sprayed this, I literally smiled. Rich, sweet, coffee vibe. Only drawback is the weird tire-rubber smell in the opening, but the dry down is magical.
* **Rasasi Hawas Ice ‚Äì 8.5/10** ‚Üí A monster freshie. Projects like crazy, but honestly too strong for me sometimes. Three sprays and I‚Äôm choking. I'm getting weary of this DNA.
* **Turathi Blue ‚Äì 9/10** ‚Üí Initially disliked it, but after maturing it became one of my most worn fragrances. Beautiful freshie with both opening & dry down hitting perfectly.
* **Wild Stone Edge (again) & WS Code Steel** ‚Üí These two are proof that even cheapies can hit hard if worn right.

üëâ Could the problems I‚Äôm experiencing (noise when off, gauge not moving, coffee coming out cold) be related to using the transformer? Or are these likely defects in the machine itself?

For my daily routine I used to have 1 cup of coffee at 7am, 1 cup at 11am, and then an espresso shot (~50mg caffine) after work as I went to the gym for 4pm, which i go to 5-6 times a week.

Im currently trialing Biphentin, and its recommended to keep caffine to 1 cup a day. I know that everyone responds differently to meds/caffine. In the past if I didnt have pre-workout/caffine before my evening workout, it was pathetic and I could barely even get through it, I was weaker, had less strength and was way less motivated.

Im planning on trying a few workouts again with no caffine after work. However say I continue to feel that way, less motivation/weaker. Would it be harmful or a problem to take an espresso shot/50mg of caffine before my workout. Or would I not even notice it, being medicated?

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating a farmhouse barndominium offers a unique opportunity to combine the warmth of cozy living with the stark beauty of industrial design. This blend achieves a stunning aesthetic, perfect for those seeking a comfortable yet modern home. If you‚Äôre embarking on this design journey, here are some valuable insights to enhance your space.

### Embrace Open Spaces

The essence of a farmhouse barndominium lies in its open layout. These homes typically feature large, airy spaces that enhance natural light, making the interiors feel more inviting. To achieve a cozy atmosphere, consider:

- Using warm color palettes like soft whites, creams, and muted earthy tones.
- large windows to bring in more light and provide views of the surrounding nature.
- Designing multifunctional spaces that can adapt to your daily needs, whether it's a living area that transforms into a workspace or a kitchen that doubles as a dining room.

### Incorporate Industrial Features

While promoting coziness, your interior design can also feature industrial elements that add character. Here are some ideas:

- Exposed beams and metalwork give the space an on-trend industrial edge.
- Concrete floors offer durability and can be enhanced with area rugs for warmth.
- Brick walls or accents create a rustic feel, beautifully juxtaposed against softer furnishings.

### Selecting Cozy Textiles

Textiles play a critical role in establishing a cozy environment. When choosing fabric for your barndominium, prioritize comfort and warmth. Consider:

- Knitted throws that add texture and can be draped over furniture.
- Soft pillows in various shapes and sizes to invite relaxation.
- Natural fiber rugs that create a homey feel while complementing industrial features.

### Mixing Furniture Styles

The beauty of farmhouse barndominium interiors lies in the blend of different furniture styles. A mix of vintage and modern pieces can create a harmonious balance between cozy and industrial. Here are some tips:

- Pair a sleek metal coffee table with a reclaimed wood sofa set for an inviting contrast.
- Use metal-based light fixtures to illuminate warm wood finishes.
- Choose functional furniture that enhances community spaces, such as large dining tables that can accommodate family gatherings.

### Integrate Nature

This design style thrives on a connection with nature. Indoor plants not only enhance the aesthetic but also improve air quality. To integrate nature into your barndominium:

- Add large potted plants, like fiddle leaf figs or snake plants, to corners of your living space.
- Create herb gardens in the kitchen to add greenery and offer fresh flavor to your meals.
- Utilize natural elements like wood and stone in your decor to enhance the organic feel of the space.

### Personal Touches

Don‚Äôt forget to personalize your farmhouse barndominium interiors. This is your home, and it should reflect your personality. Here are some ways to make your space uniquely yours:

- Showcase family photos in rustic frames to add sentimental value.
- Incorporate handmade items or local crafts to support artisans and add character.
- Use art pieces that resonate with you, combining both cozy and industrial styles.

Designing your farmhouse barndominium should be an enjoyable experience. By thoughtfully combining cozy and industrial elements, you can create a home that feels both welcoming and contemporary. As you plan your spaces, focus on the harmony between features to achieve a stunning end result that will stand the test of time.

Key Features of Farmhouse Barndominiums That Enhance Comfort and Style
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Farmhouse barndominiums are becoming increasingly popular as charming living spaces that meld rustic elegance with modern design. If you‚Äôre dreaming of cozy interiors that combine warmth with industrial chic, understanding the key features of these unique homes can help you create an inviting sanctuary. Here are some essential aspects that enhance both comfort and style in farmhouse barndominiums.

### Open Floor Plans

One of the standout features of farmhouse barndominiums is the open floor plan. This design encourages a flow between the living spaces, making your home feel spacious and inviting. Whether it‚Äôs a combined kitchen and living room or a seamless transition from indoor to outdoor spaces, open layouts foster connectivity among family members. This layout not only enhances your comfort but also adds visual appeal, allowing natural light to illuminate your interiors.

### Rustic Materials

Farmhouse barndominiums often showcase rustic materials that contribute to their warm and welcoming vibe. Consider incorporating:

- **Wood Accents:** Exposed wooden beams, hardwood floors, and reclaimed wood walls add character and comfort.
- **Metal Fixtures:** Industrial-style light fixtures, metal railings, and window frames bring an edgy flair to your space.
- **Stone Elements:** Stone fireplaces or accent walls can evoke a sense of traditional warmth while maintaining a modern aesthetic.

### Cozy Fireplaces

A fireplace serves as a focal point in any farmhouse barndominium. It not only provides warmth during chilly evenings but also creates a cozy ambiance for gatherings. The choice of materials for the fireplace can range from traditional bricks to sleek stonework, allowing you to personalize the space according to your style. A well-placed fireplace encourages a sense of togetherness, making it a cherished space in your home.

### Comfortable Furnishings

Choosing the right furnishings can turn your farmhouse barndominium into a haven of comfort. Opt for plush sofas and armchairs that invite you to relax after a long day. Employing a mix of textures‚Äîfrom soft throws to knitted pillows‚Äîadds depth and warmth to your interiors. Make sure to keep the color palette soft and earthy, using shades like muted greens, warm browns, and gentle grays that reflect the tranquility of nature.

### Natural Light

Emphasizing natural light is key in farmhouse barndominiums. Large windows not only provide stunning views but also flood the space with sunlight, creating an airy atmosphere. Skylights offer another layer of brightness, especially in spaces where walls may restrict traditional window placements. Properly utilizing natural light enhances your mood and connects the indoor environment to the outdoor landscape.

### Functional Mudrooms

A dedicated mudroom can enhance your farmhouse barndominium's functionality while keeping the home organized. This space serves as a buffer between the outdoors and your living areas, allowing you to store coats, shoes, and outdoor gear effectively. Adding built-in benches and hooks can enhance usability while contributing to the overall aesthetic. That means everything stays tidy, making your space even cozier.

### Customized Lighting

Lighting plays a critical role in defining the mood and atmosphere of your barndominium. In addition to overhead fixtures, consider incorporating various types of lighting:

- **Table Lamps:** These add soft illumination ideal for reading or creating a relaxed atmosphere.
- **Wall Sconces:** Great for accent lighting, these fixtures can highlight artwork or architectural features.
- **String Lights:** These can enhance outdoor areas or provide decorative flair to your interior, especially during special occasions.

### Outdoor Living Spaces

Farmhouse barndominiums often blur the lines between indoor and outdoor living. An inviting porch, patio, or deck can extend your living space outdoors, making it perfect for relaxation and entertaining. Furnish these areas with comfortable seating and decor that matches your interior style. Incorporate greenery with potted plants or hanging arrangements to bring a touch of nature into your entertaining space.

By focusing on these key features‚Äîopen floor plans, rustic materials, cozy furnishings, and a connection to nature‚Äîyou can achieve a harmonious balance of comfort and style in your farmhouse barndominium. Whether you‚Äôre renovating or building from scratch, these elements will ensure that your home is a welcoming retreat for you and your guests.

### Conclusion

Creating the perfect Farmhouse Barndominium interior is all about striking a balance between cozy comfort and industrial elegance. By thoughtfully blending these two styles, you can design a space that feels both inviting and unique. Whether it‚Äôs through the use of warm wood finishes, soft textiles, or the incorporation of sleek metals and exposed structures, each element contributes to an atmosphere that reflects personal style while maximizing comfort.

Key features such as open floor plans, oversized windows, and practical but stylish furniture play essential roles in enhancing the beauty and livability of these spaces. Open layouts not only create a sense of freedom but also allow natural light to flood the interiors, making them feel more spacious and welcoming. Adding plush seating areas, rustic decor, and warm lighting helps to further establish a cozy ambiance, inviting relaxation and connection with family and friends.

Moreover, the thoughtful combination of industrial elements‚Äîlike raw steel beams or repurposed barn doors‚Äîadds character and depth to the overall design. Each handcrafted detail and curated piece tells a story, blending modern industrial vibes with the charm of traditional farmhouse aesthetics.

Designing your Farmhouse Barndominium with these principles in mind allows you to enjoy a home that is not only functional but also a warm retreat. As you embark on this decorating journey, keep in mind that the ultimate goal is to create a space that feels uniquely yours, where every corner resonates with comfort and style, perfectly embodying the essence of cozy meets industrial living.",1,1755884573.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

**The Good:** The hotel is in impeccable condition, and the service at every restaurant, bar, store, and facility was consistently excellent‚Äînothing has been downgraded, contrary to what some other comments have suggested. 

**The Bad:** Unfortunately, the food did not meet my expectations. While the ingredients are of good quality and there is a variety, I found the flavors to be bland and somewhat lacking. I preferred Bio and Fuego (located on the Mexico side), which are far better than their Arte counterparts, Kibi Kibi and Apapachoa. Additionally, the butlers at Artistas were not helpful; they didn‚Äôt even perform basic tasks like checking my itinerary or providing personalized advice. I received better service from the general reception and bellboys than from the butlers, and I heard similar complaints from other guests.

Would I book again at Arte? Yes, but not at Artistas. The price tag does not justify the lack of service from the butlers, which makes me hesitant to stay there again. The great aspect of the Xcaret concept is that there are plenty of activities to enjoy. You can easily overlook the bland food and shortcomings of the butlers by enjoying drinks, swimming in the rivers, pools, beaches, and caletas, walking or jogging around, sampling desserts, having coffee, and taking in the astonishing views throughout the hotel. If your idea of a vacation is delicious food and exceptional personalized service, Xcaret may not be the best choice. However, if you‚Äôre looking to relax, escape your everyday life, and explore new places and foods each day with a strong background of Mexican culture, this is the perfect destination.",5,1755884465.0,Xcaret,1,1.0,False

I don't think I've ever been depressed for the majority of my life. I am a PhD student, working towards the field of immunology. I have grown to hate grad school. I hate so many things about my life. Work used to come easily to me, but not anymore. These days I have to compel myself to do anything, none of it comes naturally. I have to compel myself to get out of bed, shower before heading out, I have to compel myself to drive to the university, I have to compel myself to start experiments, I have to compel myself to write articles, I have to compel myself to teach the lab I am responsible for. All of these things used to be fun or at least fulfilling, but no longer. How did I get to this point? Failure after failure. Since I've started, I've watched myself fail in almost every endeavor and research project. Meanwhile, I've watched everyone else in my lab publish research papers, go on to more and more travel conferences, win awards and research grants. I've changed projects multiple times but nothing yields any fruit, and if it does it takes far far too long to get any of it to fruition. A student that started with me graduated recently, and I still haven't published anything. There's always little things that make it obvious I just suck at this more than everyone else. Me and another student will do the same or similar experiment. When they perform such experiments, there are little issues that are simply not present when they do it. And I've tried troubleshooting SO MUCH on my own and somehow I still can't get it perfectly. I've asked my bosses to do one with me before but they just don't want to at this stage. They make suggestions here and there but they never seem like they want to take a huge leap and go through all the tiny details to make sure I'm not making a mistake. It's like they rule over me at a superficial level only.

I don't feel like I belong here. Everyone is friends (students and principal instructors), laugh together and work together, and I don't feel like they like me much. Maybe they don't actively dislike me, but the lack of connection is all too apparent. They don't invite me to things very often., like random lunches or chilling near a coffee shop or whatever. Obviously I'm still expected to show up at lab meetings. But sometimes they go quiet when I walk in the room, like they don't want me to ever hear anything they talk about. One of my bosses always looks at me coldly, and seems annoyed every time I want to talk to her about something. I feel like the bosses ignored me for far too long, and only recently started paying me real attention because now they fear I will be here forever. So maybe this will change.

I don't laugh at anything, I don't smile at anything. I hate lab meetings because all I ever see is everyone else advancing, and I only have issues and setbacks to demonstrate. I can't sleep easily anymore. I lay down and all I can think about is how much I suck. My heart beats too loudly, I can feel it drumming through my skull sometimes. I'm tired nearly every day of my life. I power through hunger sometimes because I don't feel like eating. I've realized I indulge too much in escapes lately. I play more video games than I usually do (Marvel Rivals, I peaked Celestial 1 recently!). I've been trying to break away from my phone recently because it takes up too much time of my day and really ruins my attention span to important work I have to do. I think I've developed a couple of other small addictions that I'm too embarrassed to even admit here (no hard drugs or anything like that).

Simultaneously I am too much in debt. Grad students hardly make any money, and I am too much in debt to really buy much of anything anymore. I try and enjoy the things I do have but I am having to sell much of what I own to avoid falling into worse debt. I've just been a stupid consumerist, and I think the pain of dealing with my failures has only made it worse. But now I can't buy anything anymore. The only things I do get are the occasional CD, because I love music and prefer to own hard copies than stream. But I only use my credit card rewards for that, no real money.

So I feel stuck in life. No money to spend and have fun with. No successes to reflect on or keep driving me forward. I can't enjoy any of my hobbies without feeling guilty for not working on even more school stuff instead. I wear the same clothes all the time because I can't get anything else, so I feel like I look like a bum. Most of my close friends have moved to other states, and I feel like I can't afford to see my remaining ones or family because it's all time that I should be using to try and get ahead in school. I have been in grad school too long and I wish I had just gotten some job with my Master's instead. Maybe I would be happier. I just feel worthless. I can't be good at school, I can't be good at science, I can't be good at academics. And I feel like I can't be a handyman and work in labor either because I'm not a tough guy and my best years to learn another craft are probably now gone.

I am married. I love my wife so much but I feel like a failure to her. I can't help her get out of her own debts or mine. I can't take her out anywhere cause we are broke. She complains to me that I never help her enough around the house. Thing is she is right, I don't. Sometimes I really really want to but everything makes me sad, even bloody house chores. I fear she will one day resent me and divorce me. Sometimes I wish she would because I feel like she could get ahead in life with someone else instead of me. I just want her to be happy after all, and if she's better off with someone else than I wish she would leave me. I don't want her to, I love her so much.

I've never been suicidal I don't think. But I get all manner of intrusive thoughts now though. Like what would happen if I just floored the gas pedal and drove straight into that tree at 120mph. Or what would it be like to just jump off a bridge, see if I die or break my legs. We are gun owners, and I have my concealed carry permit. Sometimes I wonder what would happen if I just blew my head off. It would hurt my wife if I did, but not sure anyone else would really care or notice at this point.

I shouldn't have gone to grad school. I should have ignored my parents and tried to become a rock star or go into film school. Music and film I was always passionate about. I think I could have been a good screenwriter.

I am trying to fix things. For the first time in I think 7 months I have gone a whole week where I woke up at 5am each day and got 6 1/2 - 8 hours of sleep each night. I figured sleep is the first step, I feel a bit better. But everything else I don't know how to approach. I'm not sure I want to fix anything anymore, but I like how I feel when I've slept properly.

I don't know why I'm posting this here. I probably will never say all of this to anyone ever. Perhaps I'm just looking for another escape. Sometimes I hope an apocalypse of some kind will happen because it may be the only way to start anew, instead of just finding a way to die here and now.",1,1755884343.0,depression,1,1.0,False

1mxcwn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ResonantRejects/comments/1mxcwn8/why_is_the_best_wireless_subwoofer_roku_worth/,Why Is the Best Wireless Subwoofer Roku Worth Your Setup Upgrade,"Testing out the Roku 100002419 wireless subwoofer has been quite an experience, especially for someone like me who lives for immersive home audio setups. I‚Äôm not one to dabble half-heartedly when it comes to sound systems. Whether it‚Äôs binging through the newest Netflix drama or unleashing my Spotify jazz playlist, having audio that fills the room and doesn‚Äôt skimp on bass is essential. This subwoofer promises to pack a punch with its 150 watts of peak bass and wireless connectivity. After using it daily for a few weeks, I‚Äôve got some thoughts‚Äîboth good and not-so-good‚Äîto share.

**Design and Setup Experience**  
Out of the box, the design is clean and practical. The subwoofer isn‚Äôt flashy nor overly minimalist but sits comfortably within modern aesthetics. It‚Äôs compact enough to tuck under a coffee table or sit next to a compact soundbar setup without overshadowing the d√©cor of your room. What gets major points from me, though, is the flexibility in placement. Being wireless, it offers a 30-ft distance flexibility to position it wherever it makes the bass frequencies hit *just right*. Plus, the freestanding build makes it well-suited for both tabletops and floors without wobble issues.  
 
Setting it up took no time at all. Just plug and pair‚Äîit‚Äôs about as simple as tech can get. I didn‚Äôt even have to hunt for extra cables‚Äîit paired right away with my Roku Smart Soundbar. There‚Äôs no need for separate remotes, either. Everything integrates smoothly with a Roku remote. There‚Äôs a friendly satisfaction in realizing you don‚Äôt have to juggle six remotes to control one tiny detail of sound!

**Wireless Connectivity and Range**  
The Bluetooth range clocks in at 10 meters, promising stable connections. In my testing, I had no dropouts moving around the house within its specified range. However, it‚Äôs worth noting the subwoofer is exclusively designed to work with Roku ecosystem products‚Äîso if you‚Äôve got other sound systems or streaming setups unrelated to Roku, this won‚Äôt be compatible. That limitation didn‚Äôt bother me since I already own a couple of Roku products, but it‚Äôs good info to have beforehand.  

**[Check Roku 100002419 price on Amazon.](https://dgshopper.com/p/b0dz3y23dm/)**  

**Performance and Bass Quality**  
This subwoofer really shines in what it does best‚Äîdelivering deep, floor-rumbling bass. Whether I‚Äôm revisiting the T. rex roar from Jurassic Park or losing myself in Beethoven‚Äôs dramatic symphonies, the nuances of low frequencies felt well-preserved without distortion. Its audio driver type, a dynamic driver, lives up to its name, bringing cinematic depth while watching action-packed sequences. That said, this model thrives in supplementing soundbars rather than being a standalone speaker‚Äîit won‚Äôt perform optimally without partnering with your Roku Smart Soundbar.

I must admit, though, during quieter movie moments or low-action TV shows, the bass response sometimes felt underwhelming. It almost blends into the background. While not a dealbreaker, audiophiles seeking consistently dramatic resonance might find this a quirk worth scrutinizing.

**Advantages**  
- Compact design blends effortlessly into living spaces.  
- Seamless wireless setup‚Äîno annoying wires to deal with.  
- Great pairing flexibility, with positioning up to 30 feet away.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Limited compatibility to Roku-specific products‚Äîless versatility for mixed-brand setups.  
- Bass, although solid in high-action moments, sometimes struggles to stay impressive during quieter audio.  

**Automatic Updates: A Blessing**  
Another standout feature that deserves mention is the automatic software updates. You know the drill‚Äîtechnology gets outdated faster than you can count to ten. But with regular OTA updates baked into the setup, the subwoofer is future-proofed for optimal sound tweaks. I didn‚Äôt need to download anything manually; updates roll in stealthily, leaving everything working precisely as it should. This has been fantastic because, let‚Äôs face it, no one wants to tinker with firmware just to enjoy better-sounding explosions on-screen.

**Competing Products on the Market**  
Subwoofers like the JBL Bar 2.1 or Bose Bass Module 500 come to mind as direct competitors. The JBL excels with compatibility across various products and offers fantastic bass, but its wired setup eliminates the graceful simplicity you get here. Bose, on the other hand, edges out the competition in audio richness. However, for someone already invested in the Roku soundbar ecosystem, Bose begins to feel like paying for features you can‚Äôt fully use. The Roku subwoofer, while modest relative to Bose, complements its soundbar counterpart perfectly. If seamless integration matters more than having slightly better build materials, then this product pulls ahead.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
For what it offers, I‚Äôd describe it as a reasonably smart purchase. You‚Äôre investing not only in a device but in the entire ecosystem it operates within, and that‚Äôs where its real worth lies. On the pricing scale, it‚Äôs competitive compared to premium alternatives, offering just the right balance of simplicity and performance. If you‚Äôre not already part of the Roku circle, it might seem steep considering its exclusivity, but for users already relying on Roku‚Äôs soundbars or streaming products? It‚Äôs a no-brainer.

Yes, I can't blame my wife for this and I have come to some conclusions.

1. Alcoholism is not a choice, it's a disease, heredity factors into individual succeptibility.
2. I can't stop partly, I have to stop completely.
3. My drinking may be in part makes my wife spend more time on her phone or at work, so I get lonely and I drink more, in turn a destructive positive feedback loop aka vicious cycle.
4. She may be having an affair, I can't do anything about that.
5. I can't control what she or anyone else does, only myself.
6. Alcoholics do love themselves, but possibly love they feeling they get from alcohol more than they love other people. They are showing love to themselves in a negative destructive habitual way, I mean alcohol makes them feel better, or less stressed so they are showing themselves love, in a wrong way. They need to love others more than drinking. Drinking is selfish, therefore self love, but a destructive habit that an alcoholic doesn't realize how destructive it really is, or just can't break free without help.
7. Nobody is going to love a desperate needy person. I need to break free fix myself and not care if my wife does or does not pay attention to me. It's going to be hard after being with her for 20 years and I can't do it today, but I can start today. Only after fixing myself, if she so chooses, she may realize I don't care and wonder what it is she can't have or at least can't have without also making some effort. I've known since young people never want what they can have. Being needy will just make them want to be with you less.

1mxcsh5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1mxcsh5/i_told_my_brother_that_i_hope_he_dies/,I told my brother that I hope he dies,"I (21)f my brother (18)m . I know I am at fault here so just venting about things. It all started 4to5 years back when I went to college in a different state everything seemed quite fine I had my own issues going on cause I was staying at my relatives house and back here at home my brother started acting up. he stopped going to school and started missing a lot of classes. At first mom had no idea about my brother skipping school cause he used his cycle to go to school and after a while she started noticing sand in his shoes we live in a coastal area and the beaches aren't far from home he kept telling mom that the sand was from the school playground ( I know what you guys are thinking no the school did not call my mom about my brother's absence) when she got to know he was missing school and going out all by himself she didn't know what to do she tried talking to him but nth worked. He finished his 11th grade without any attendance issue but when he reached 12th grade he still kept doing the same thing mom never told dad about it cause he was already taking a lot of load. During these days the fight between mom and my brother grew bigger and bigger my parents expected my brother to be like me which was really shitty of them. When I started to know about all this I barely knew my brother's side of the story and my mom used to tell me how everyday it was about them fighting. How My brother was constantly acting rebellious and skipping school. The problem grew bigger and bigger I tried to do my best to solve it when I came home or on calls. Every time I came home from college my brother used to fight with me and make me cry so bad i did not have it easy at my relatives house. My grades were really messed up. my relationship with my bf in college wasn't going good and everything was a disaster. I was mentally so exhausted. Somehow college got over and i came back home and my brother still argues about all the time my parents messed up and i keep telling him i will pay for therapy I ask him to get help and he refuses to do anything.  I talked to my parents and they realised that they fucked up and are trying to give him space and everything it's taking them time to be better. Every time we have a break through my brother suddenly starts arguing about the old stuff. He has taken 2 years off without going to college because after his 12th finals he was really excited to go out of State and study but on the drive home mom said no and he decided his life is ruined and now he can't even fill college applications or open emails if I start describing what all happened it will take me days to write. For some context even I had to fight with my parents to go study outside. ( I am from a brown household) and trust me when I say my parents are actually lenient. They let me and my brother stay out till 11 pm they let us go out without even giving them a heads up. They buy us everything we want clothes, shoes, any degree we want they are ready to pay for it, never pressured us to take the degree they wanted us to take, let us play all the sports we wanted even if we quit after a while and the list goes on. I have a major exam tomorrow and i knew that I wasn't really prepared for it . Since yesterday I have been stress eating my way out of it and today I was feeling so numb cause I was having some issues other than this and my exam and since my brother woke up he has been very grumpy cause the wifi was not working and I wanted him to call them because my number wasn't registered he told me to call them and I was telling him how I need his number and i don't remember his number so I wanted him to tell it to me he getting mad at me and I lost it I told him to fuck off and left the room. Later when I asked him he said he didn't call the wifi company and was making some comment which i don't remember to be exact and it made me mad so I ended up calling them myself and figured it out. Later my dad came home and he was eating in the hall . My brother and my dad don't really have a good relationship either so he wanted the room door closed and I wanted one of the 2 doors open he told he to close it I told him no and he was like this is my room too and the doors will be closed always and i told him we share the room so we both should have an equal say in it. Then I decided i should just move rooms for today and study in my mom's room instead while I was taking my stuff I had to make a few trips cause I needed my laptop earbuds charger notebook my coffee and my clothes so I made a few trips every time I left the door open to go to the other room he kept closing them and it wasn't a long trip like literally my mom's room door and my room door face each other like maybe 10 to 15 steps far that's all since he kept banging the door everytime I left the room it made my dad furious. I told my brother he is being stupid and I was just taking my things and he can close it once I am done it didn't even take me more than 5 mins tbh. My dad goes inside the room furious asking him why he keeps banging the door and they both have a screaming match. Fast-forward to now he wanted to go out at 10pm my mom said no cause it was raining and there seems to be a lot of thunder. She didn't find it safe he got angry saying why can't he go and kept on arguing with her. When that ended everything was fine for a few mins and then my mom closed my room door cause I was going to study and she was going to stitch something in the machine which makes a lot of noise. My brother kept opening the door saying dad was mad at him for closing the door now he won't close the door . I went and closed it and he kept opening it. I got so angry cause it's not his first time doing something like this before someone has a important day I was so furious i couldn't hold my tears and blurted out I hope you die and I mean it this time. I feel very awful to even think that way I feel like a horrible elder sister. I promised him I will stay by his side and me saying something like this to him makes me feel like a Ahole. I know I fucked up and there is no going back from what I said. I just wanted to vent about everything cause I have been holding onto it for a very long time and i cant take this pain anymore I wish I could be the one dead.

I‚Äôm hoping to keep this one for 5+ years. If it makes the 10 year mark like my 2015 then bonus.

I‚Äôm considering the 14‚Äô‚Äô with the M4 Pro chip.
I‚Äôll be doing basic editing of 4k footage in total being 30 minutes - 1 hours worth. 
I will also be using it for music production on Logic Pro, with only 1 or 2 external plug ins. 

First question, will the 24GB RAM enough going forward? I know it‚Äôll comfortably manage what I do now, but I‚Äôm not sure about how long for. 
Secondly, I‚Äôm going for the 1TB upgrade just to benefit storage when travelling etc. I‚Äôm aware Apple charge far too much but I‚Äôve accepted this upgrade. 
Thirdly, nano texture? Whats everyone‚Äôs opinions? I can see some love, and some regret. I would like the option for outdoor/bright light coffee shop use, but I don‚Äôt want to compromise on quality of image when video editing. 

My final dilemma - classic silver or space black? 
I love the space black for looks, I think it‚Äôd be nice for using in the dark with no reflection etc and it is stealth for editing outside of home. However, I‚Äôve read about the ports scratching (expected) and also the palm rest colour being worn over time from last years (M3) space black buyers. 
I think the silver is classic and looks gorgeous. I know it won‚Äôt wear anywhere near as much as the space black. And it‚Äôs more of a stand out piece that would look nice in coffee shops. 
I change my mind daily on this colour debate, and is probably the sole reason I haven‚Äôt actually pulled the trigger yet. I appreciate this is a long post, so if you made it here, thanks.

Lots of toppings, and very big tomato slices. Almost felt that hid the lox flavor underneath. Most of the onion and capers fell off. 
By the time I got to the second half, moisture content had gotten into the bagel and made it much tougher to bite through and tear apart. Still very chewy, and I think because it was open face, I got more contents than in sandwich form.

1mxcn42,https://v.redd.it/ic088eprulkf1,Help!!! Can my [Flair 58 2+] be used without a grinder??,"Hey yall! I just bought a Flair Espresso 58 2+ for my partner‚Äôs birthday (a treat for both of us ü•∞). We don‚Äôt live near each other yet but plan to move in together in about a year.

Current setup & constraint 
‚Ä¢	I own a Kinu M47 Phoenix hand grinder, but it‚Äôs ~7‚Äì8 years old and feeling ‚Äúcrunchy‚Äù with inconsistent grind, so it lives with me for now. 
‚Ä¢	Until we move in together, my partner needs a way to use the Flair without buying a pricey grinder. 
‚Ä¢	She mainly wants iced lattes ‚Äî doesn‚Äôt need God shots, just something balanced that isn‚Äôt watery/bitter. What we tried (and what went wrong) 
‚Ä¢	She bought a fresh bag this morning and had the caf√© grind it for espresso on a Mahlk√∂nig EK43. 
‚Ä¢	Dosed ~18 g into the stock 58 mm basket on the Flair 58. 
‚Ä¢	The water rushed through with almost no resistance (classic gusher). This was within ~30 minutes of grinding.

Questions for yall espresso enthusiasts 
1.	Is pre-ground on an EK43 inherently tricky for lever espresso? Is the grind likely too coarse / too unimodal for the Flair? Should she ask the caf√© for even finer (e.g., ‚Äúvery fine / Turkish-ish‚Äù or ‚Äúfor a lever machine‚Äù)? 
2.	Budget grinder stopgap: If we do buy a grinder for her place, what‚Äôs the best value in the ‚Äúwon‚Äôt make me cry‚Äù range? Think $150‚Äì$300 if possible (a bit more if it‚Äôs truly worth it). ‚ó¶	Thoughts on the Baratza Encore ESP? ‚ó¶	Alternatives you like for beginner-friendly, consistent espresso grinding (hand or electric)? 
3.	Pressurized / flow-control baskets: Are there 58 mm pressurized baskets that play nicely with the Flair 58? Would this be a reasonable ‚Äúyear-long crutch‚Äù with pre-ground coffee, especially for milk drinks? 
4.	Puck prep vs grind reality: Would WDT/leveling/tamping/puck screens actually help here, or are we still dead in the water if the grind is off? (My instinct: these improve consistency, not flow rate when grind is too coarse.) 
5.	Workflow hacks for pre-ground: ‚ó¶	Ask the caf√© to grind finer than they think, then single-dose pack (18 g) and freeze immediately? ‚ó¶	Use a slightly darker roast to improve solubility for milk drinks? ‚ó¶	Increase dose (e.g., 19‚Äì20 g) to add resistance? ‚ó¶	Longer pre-infusion and a firmer lever push to compensate? 
6.	Kinu rehab worth it? My M47 Phoenix feels crunchy and the grind is inconsistent. Is it worth doing a full refresh (bearings, axle, burr clean/replace) vs. just buying a budget grinder for her place?

Shot details from the failed attempt (for context) 
‚Ä¢	Dose: ~18 g 
‚Ä¢	Temp: ~96¬∞C 
‚Ä¢	Pre-infusion: basically none 
‚Ä¢	Yield: ~36 g in ~10 seconds with minimal lever force ‚Üí gush

What we‚Äôre hoping to achieve 
‚Ä¢	Cheapest reliable path to decent iced lattes for about a year. 
‚Ä¢	Minimal faff for her ‚Äî she‚Äôs new to this. 
‚Ä¢	If a pressurized basket + smarter pre-ground workflow can bridge the gap, great. If not, we‚Äôll bite the bullet on a budget grinder.

TL;DR: Trying to run a Flair 58 without a home grinder for ~1 year. Pre-ground on an EK43 gushed immediately. Looking for either a budget grinder recommendation, a good 58 mm pressurized/flow-control basket option, or pre-ground workflow tips that actually work for milk-drinkable shots. Also curious if rehabbing a Kinu M47 Phoenix is worth it.

1mxcmgs,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimLounge/comments/1mxcmgs/our_community_is_full_of_builders_but_were_not/,Our community is full of builders: but we‚Äôre not backing them soon enough.,"Just wanted to share something that‚Äôs been sitting heavy with me lately.

I‚Äôve been digging into the stories of some Muslim-origin founders in tech: names like **Amjad Masad (Replit), Hamdi Ulukaya (Chobani), Ali Ghodsi (Databricks), the Mokhtarzada brothers (Rocket Money),** and others.

These are billion-dollar companies. Huge exits. Millions of users. And in almost every case... **Muslim capital wasn‚Äôt there early**. By the time these startups blew up, it was already the usual names on the cap table: Sequoia, a16z, Coatue, etc.  


It‚Äôs not about blame, but it raises a question:

>

Some thoughts:

* These companies *didn't* look obvious at the beginning. Replit was dismissed as ‚Äúa toy‚Äù for beginner coders. Chobani maxed out loans because no one believed in Turkish yogurt. Rocket Money was just ‚Äúanother budgeting app.‚Äù
* And yet‚Ä¶ they scaled. And they hit. Hard.
* The founders were Muslim. Often immigrants. Often building with a real uphill climb.

Meanwhile, at the grassroots:

* **Yemeni coffee shops** have gone from a few to **hundreds of locations** across the U.S. in just a few years.
* **Halal fast food** is growing into real franchise territory.
* **Modest fashion** is pulling in 8- and 9-figure online sales.
* These businesses are real. Growing. And in some cases, outpacing ‚Äúmainstream‚Äù brands quietly.

So I wanted to ask this community:

1. **What do you think stops us from backing or even championing these things earlier?** Is it just being used to real estate? Not knowing who‚Äôs building? Not trusting unproven brands?
2. **Is there a founder or brand you know who deserves more support?** Doesn‚Äôt have to be VC-backed. Could be your local coffee shop, fashion label, or dev tool. Just someone in our community building something great.

(Btw, I help write Dhow Dispatch: a free weekly that tracks Muslim founders, startups, and market moves. Happy to DM the latest issue if you‚Äôre curious)

When visiting my wife and living with her for a few months here and there before we got married and were just dating, I was aware she owned two cats and I have never owned any so had no clue about their needs and behaviours.

When I stayed over they would often wake me up by jumping on my head at night, scratching me, puking in the room, making random noises. At first I tolerated this but I also had very bad allergies so bad to the point I couldn't breathe properly so I offered to sleep in the guest bedroom so her cats could sleep with her. She demanded I stay in our room and she would kick the cats out which was fine by me. We also changed their food to some sort of allergy food that would help me and it did a little bit but I still get allergies from them, they're just mild now. 

Even though we kicked them out of the room, they will sit by the door scratching and meowing constantly all night to the point I am not even getting an hour of sleep. My wife never wakes up from it but I do. 

Also, when I first moved in I scrubbed the house clean as it was filthy, covered in cat hair, cat hairballs under the bed, cat vomit under the couch and litter everywhere. I am a germphobe and can't stand a dirty house and now I am cleaning every single day due to how messy they are.

We have had many arguments over the cats because I bought a brand new couch and they tore holes in it, 2k down the drain and now there is a massive hole in it that they keep clawing at which is getting bigger. I have tried everything even though they are her responsibility. I have bought toys, scratch posts, everything I can think of and they just don't stop. They climb all over the kitchen counters and knock over cups of coffee which I have to clean. I'm genuinely exhausted from living with them and feel like I can't turn my back for a second. 

I have started a new job the past month and because I am not getting much sleep, I have been more snappy and grumpy. I sat my wife down two weeks ago and explained to her I am exhausted and I need my sleep. I told her I am willing go to go stay in a hotel over the weekend or get my own apartment so I can sleep, an argument broke out over this and she told me if I leave she will consider us over and how she wants me to sleep with her. I basically apologized and just dealt with it.

But then... 3 days ago I called her when I was on my lunch break. She had made a comment about the cats, it was something to do with how we need to buy them something and I said ""i'm not buying those little c**ts anything"". She got incredibly mad and told me not to be mean to the cats.

An argument broke out because I feel like she is putting the cats above me. I just want to sleep in peace and be comfortable in my own home. I have started resenting the cats because of all these fights we keep having and I now avoid them at all costs.

This has resulted in her telling me I need to be more kind to the cats and basically ""deal with it"" or she will divorce me. 

What on earth am I supposed to do? Am I crazy?

1mxcdo1,https://www.reddit.com/r/appliances101/comments/1mxcdo1/does_the_cosori_electric_kettle_gk172_meet/,Does the COSORI Electric Kettle GK172 meet expectations? Comprehensive review inside!,"The COSORI GK172-04 Electric Kettle has been my steadfast companion for the past few weeks, and I‚Äôve had my fair share of tea, coffee, and hot chocolate experiments with it. This 1.7L stainless steel kettle, with its bold promise of no plastic filter or spout, grabbed my attention. While I‚Äôve been quite satisfied with its performance, a few quirks deserve attention. Let me walk you through my experience with this handy water booter.

**Aesthetic Design and Practical Build**

The first thing I noticed about this kettle was its sleek combination of stainless steel and a subtle green finish. The clean and modern aesthetic provides a fresh look, making it a lovely addition to my kitchen counter. Its durable materials, like borosilicate glass and 304 stainless steel, assure me of its longevity and safety for boiling water. The kettle‚Äôs 9 x 6.3 x 10-inch dimensions feel just right‚Äînot too bulky, but large enough to handle family-sized tea-making sessions without refilling frequently. In hand, the 2.5-pound weight feels sturdy, though it might be a bit heavy for some users when full.

**Performance and Speed**

If there‚Äôs one thing this electric tea kettle promises, it‚Äôs efficiency. It boils up to 1.7 liters of water within a swift 3-7 minutes, depending on the water level. Coming from a microwave or stove background, this time-saving feature has been a game changer in my daily routine. Whether I‚Äôm rushing to prepare my morning tea or tackling meal prep, the speed is consistent. Plus, it‚Äôs quieter than my old kettle, which is a huge bonus during those peaceful early mornings.

**Usability and Safety Features**

A major highlight of this kettle is its user-focused safety features. Automatic shut-off with Strix thermostat technology ensures that the kettle powers off as soon as the water boils. This functionality gives me peace of mind, especially on those busier days when multitasking becomes a sport. The boil-dry protection is another thoughtful inclusion, preventing mishaps if I ever get distracted. The drip-free spout and scald-proof lid work hand-in-hand to prevent messy spills or accidental burns, making it a safe choice even with little ones around.

**Advantages**

- Crafted with high-quality materials like stainless steel and borosilicate glass for safe and pure water.
- Heats water quickly in under 7 minutes, depending on the fill level.
- Automatic shut-off and boil-dry protection ensure a safe user experience.
- Large 4.3-inch opening makes cleaning exceptionally easy.
- Sleek and modern design complements any kitchen decor.

**Areas for Improvement**

- The stainless steel base tends to expose spots and minor discoloration when subjected to hard water.
- Though stylish, the kettle‚Äôs green finish isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs cup of tea.
- While not difficult, the lid requires a bit of effort to wipe clean thoroughly due to its curvature.

**Ease of Maintenance**

Cleaning the COSORI kettle proved to be straightforward. Following the manual‚Äôs instructions, I used a mix of vinegar and water to descale the interior thoroughly. The spacious 4.3-inch opening at the top is one of my favorite features‚Äîit makes scrubbing the inside a breeze. Incorporating lemon juice into the cleaning regimen helps remove stubborn limescale effectively. However, the stainless steel‚Äôs tendency to develop spots with hard water use means cleaning may need to be more frequent for some users.

**Product Competitors**

Compared to other electric kettles like the Hamilton Beach Glass Electric Kettle and the Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp, this model holds its ground admirably. The Hamilton Beach model also promises a clean, stylish design but lags slightly in terms of rapid heating performance. Cuisinart‚Äôs PerfecTemp kettle, on the other hand, offers variable temperature settings, which could appeal to avid tea aficionados. However, the COSORI kettle‚Äôs notably quiet operation and absence of a plastic spout/filter give it an edge for those prioritizing safety and health over customizable heating.

**Smart Spending**

Considering its mix of safety features, sleek design, and reliable performance, this kettle seems like a practical investment for daily use. While it doesn‚Äôt boast luxury features like adjustable temperature settings, for its price range, it delivers solid value. Whether you‚Äôre a tea purist or someone who just loves their nightly hot chocolate ritual, this kettle provides sufficient function and efficiency to justify its cost.

Also point to note my mother has never been the mothering type, she doesn't help me, parentified us as kids, no empathy, no support, no love, physically and mentally abusive, we were poor and she'd never support me financially  in any way even when she started doing well, she basically abandoned me, I got through in a scholarship don't ask how hard it was surviving on water everyday for lunch, one meal a day, I survived, made it big and live a pretty decent, somewhat comfortable life compared to most, now she and all my family comes here for convenience, money, has even gone behind my back to ask my kids dad for money and expensive stuff and the list goes on, she would also use any sickness as the end of the world, every week she's sick with something even though she'd go to the hospital , they'd run tests and tell her she's fine she'd travel to another one and they'd tell her she's  fine, from a flu to a UTI everything will be the end of the world where we have to set aside our lives to leave whatever we're doing to cater to her immediately or she'd tell the entire family, not like I care anymore cause when I realized what she was up to I stopped playing into her tricks and yes I've been the blacksheep of the family from birth so.  She was in therapy and claimed to have changed. She insisted to keep the kids and she'd bring someone along whom I'd have to pay. I said okay, paid for everything they'd need, left some cash and went to guve birth, low and behold I came out of hospital to a nightmare! A minute home from traveling miles home with the baby because the hospital we delivered at was far away, she wanted all the lights off in the house, neglected the kids room we set aside for her, it has a comfy queen bed and everything to sleep on the floor in our living room all of a sudden and wanted the lights off where I'd need to traverse back and forth through the night because along with breastfeeding our baby is also on fomula, no TV unless the volume is below 10, made everything a competition in our house, drove the kids and me nuts, our bathroom she used in a mess, the laundry in a mess, our fridge in a mess, everything is a shit show, would walk into me and my spouse's room without knocking even if I was not properly dressed, I've told her it wasn't okay cause she'd do this everytime she visits, did not even look at the newborn until she saw I was busy with him and breastfeeding him then she suddenly wanted to hold him while he's ON THE BREAST the night before she left!!! suddenly couldn't help with the kids at all, said she can't do this, the maid left the next day, that's another story, some of my coffee cups have gone missing along with her ü´†
She left when I could not walk claiming she's not well and the room is making her sick and she can't sleep in there since we got home,  that woman loves to make everything about her and would make the whole house uncomfortable she don't care. Also my older sister and her had a fight, whose older child lives with her, another story since she has 2 kids, she basically opted out from parenting that 1 and kept the other. My family is screwed up okay. The truth is  much much worse IRL. You get the basic picture but......she left and I decided to go no contact, she left me at my most vulnerable time yet again when I needed someone, I paid her the same money I'd paid the maid for her time here and that was the end of that. My younger sister who is also my befriend decided to step in for 5K fee, I asked her if she's sure she can wake up early and help because she's also the Golden child, she's 27, has only worked 1 year in her whole life after she and her fianc√© ended things a couple years back, sleeps in til noon and usually only comes by me to eat and sleep and shit on my dime and we're besties that's what friends and sisters do, I thought. She did the exact same thing my mom did, tell me how I must turn the volume down on my phone it's annoying her when she walked into my room, everything became a problem, tried to tell me how to run my house just like my mom, helped 4 days out of the week the first week, and apologized for the day she couldn't work, I still paid her for that day, next week she was sick with kidney stones that I also have, and was on bed rest after treatment, by the next week she was feeling better and I was her personal chauffeur driving her around for everything she wanted to get on my dime, started complaining about helping me with the kids and eventually stopped, stopped helping me around the house and would eat and leave her mess and things everywhere, hair in my sink even though she has a separate bathroom she'd be in mine, mind u she started sleeping in 4 days a week, did got up and helped when she felt like it even when she saw me in pain, mind u I'm still paying her, all groceries and extra things she wanted on my dime smh I felt used, she got mad at me when she was showering my kids I heard her going tit for tat and calling him names and saying she'd hit him in his head if he doesn't behave, I told her she needs to calm down and not fight fire with fire and be the adult and I told him to behave and listen to her, she said that's all I ever do and got mad and left, she was suppose to help me with some stuff and never helped, I had already paid her for the week she spent the rest of the week sleeping and left, now she wants to come back to be around me, not to help her words not mine, I said okay knowing I wouldn't be okay with it cause I am having a hard time and you're coming to just take take take and when I need you even on my dime u can't be there for me. I'm just tired of people.  Is it okay if I tell her no? I need my space from them all right now, I'm tired of being used by my own family and others, I just want to be there for my kids right now, they need me.

I work in a caf√©/bar in Europe. Our business relies on good coffe, but most coworkers will be satisfied with a few drops of foam in a latte. Customers won't complain if it's not terrible, but will also go other places for better coffe and we won't pull any new regulars with not-terrible coffee.

I went to a (free!) barista course, provided by our coffee supplier, and got good. I'm still perfecting latte art, play around with coffee (made a perfect aerocano today), and our customers appreciate it. 

We're looking for a new barista/bartender and I'm in charge of training and assessing them. However, it all looks the same to them. They don't clean out the portafilter basket between shots, they use pre-warmed or lukewarm milk for lattes, keep ground coffe ready in a wet machine for minutes before they pull a miserable looking shot.

Is there a way to demonstrate the difference between a good and a bad espresso that would be obvious enough?  Do I make them a bad latte so they feel the difference while sitting on the toilet shortly after? 

We're quite desperate for workers so the owner isn't that picky. But it's a new business that could be doing great with educated staff. We could do amazing if staff was actually entusiastic about their job! 

How do I explain, all the little steps make a difference? Do I keep searching for someone with a passion for this job or try to find another job where my passion will be put to use?",2,1755882601.0,barista,2,1.0,False

I thought about trying to sell my art, since it seems like a process to find a way of earning money while finding out if working as an artist is a good suit for me. Currently I have no idea on how to sell stuff. Since I am in good contact with a local coffee shop owner, I thought about hanging out artworks in there for sale. Yet I am not very sure what the possibilities are. A criteria of the essay is also being able to verify that the challenge has been completed, hence it would be hard to sell them on something like a flea market, since there is no proper verification (I guess). The challenge also needs to be specified, and I thought about putting it as something like ""Selling art to strangers in total of 50 euros"" till the deadline (beginning of November).

1mxc4x7,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/1mxc4x7/weird_experiences_that_ive_had_recently/,Weird experiences that I've had recently.,"To start off with, I'm not saying that these experiences were explicitly paranormal; just that the timing was super weird, and I can't fully explain them. 

All three of these incidents happened within the span of a few days The first one COULD be explained by human error, but I truly don't know. I have a fidget toy that I was playing with in the car while my partner drove me home after work last Friday. (Had a flat tire, so my partner came and got me.) We were going back to my place so that I could change, then going over to his place to meet up with his family so that we could go out to dinner. We did all of that. Went out, had dinner, and it was a great time, but it was on the way home that I realized that I couldn't find my fidget toy. I looked all over for it. Every pocket on my person, and on my bag, but it was nowhere to be found. My partner and I assumed that I must have left it at his place, which was a bummer, but he said he'd keep an eye out for it. I accepted it as MIA for now. My partner and I live separately, so he dropped me off at my place, then went home since he had work the next morning. When I walked in the door to my apartment; the fidget toy was sitting on the counter. I was certain that I'd had it with me. I had distinctive memories of playing with it over at his house, and this was a new fidget toy mind you. If it had in fact gone with me to his house it would have been for the first time. I shouldn't have memories of using it at his house, but I was fully convinced I'd had it, and he also swore that he'd seen me using it. The only thing I can think of is that I got confused and it led to us both creating false memories? It's possible that when we went back to my place to get changed, I set it down and never picked it back up.  That's the only explanation I can think of that makes any sense. It's just odd that he also remembers me having it with me. 

Second incident happened this past Sunday. My partner was staying over,  and we had just finished watching the movie Sinister. It was his first time seeing it, but I had seen it before. Not that it matters a ton, but I've heard that consuming paranormal content can make you more vulnerable to experiencing it, and I had been listening to a LOT of that kind of stuff even outside this movie. Anyway, we finish the movie, say the obligatory ""that was fucked up."" that you have to say whenever you watch Sinister, then started getting ready for bed. My partner went into the bathroom while I was clearing snacks and mugs of tea from the coffee table. He came back out a moment later and said that one of the lights in the bathroom had blown. I have two lights in my bathroom. They're both wall sconces set on either side of the medicine cabinet/mirror. I said ""okay, weird."" and  made a mental note to change the bulb later, then continued with what I was doing. My partner went back in the bathroom and came back out a second ater and said ""It wasnt blown, it was unscrewed."" Which gave me just SO much ick, because the bulbs are in this weird sort of sconce where you have to reach inside them to unscrew them from the top. Granted lightbulbs loosen up over time, I guess, but the timing was just so strange and really freaked ys both out. My partner is a skeptic, but even he seemed freaked out by the timing. We slept with a lamp left on in the other room that night. 


Final incident was the next day after I got home from a short shift at work. I walked in the door and began putting my stuff down, and my partner got up to greet me. I was still wearing my headphones from the drive home and didn't get a chance to take them out before he leaned in to kiss me, and when he did one of my wireless ear buds fell out and I didn't see where it landed. Not a big deal. After he finished kissing me, I told him that it had fallen out and we began looking for it, but neither of us could find it. I use my headphones pretty much every day, as I work in a field where I don't talk to many people throughout my shifts, and I listen to a lot of audio content, so it was important to me that I found it because I had work the next day. We searched all over the place for a good three minutes. It was at the point where I went in the other room to take my shirt off and shake out my hair to make sure it wasn't stuck somewhere. No dice, but while I did that; my partner got down on the floor and was sweeping his hands over the carpet. Finally, I put my other headphone in my bedroom and turned the volume all the way up on my phone and blasted music since my bluetooth was still connected. I could hear the missing headphone after that and we tracked it back to directly in the middle of the dining room floor in a spot where my partner had already swept over with his hands, and where I for sure would have seen it. Both of us had checked there already. It was within three feet of the spot I had been standing in when it fell out, but both of us had very thoroughly canvased the area. Is it possible that we could have missed something? Sure, and I'm willing to accept that as the answer, but it just feels strange now in combo with the other things.

I didn't like how many coincidences were piling up. It felt like I was being fucked with. If any of these incidents had happened without the context of the others I might have just written them off, but all together? I opened my windows, saged every room and closet in the apartment, and told anything that was there that it was unwelcome in no uncertain terms even though I'm not sure there was anything there to begin with. If anything I guess it could have been a trickster? Nothing has happened since. Also, before it does come up; my apartment is all electric. No gas, so I don't think that's a factor. I know all of these can be reasoned away, but it's just interesting that there was so much stuff condensed into 4 days. Thoughts? Also, I'm sorry if this post is formatted weirdly. I know it's long as fuck. I've never posted before now, so please be gentle. üòÖ",3,1755882221.0,ParanormalEncounters,0,1.0,False

1mxc2ul,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechTruthSerum/comments/1mxc2ul/delve_into_the_best_laser_printer_hp_m227fdw_and/,Delve Into the Best Laser Printer HP M227fdw and See If It Delivers,"The HP M227fdw has been part of my daily routine for a while now, and I hesitated before diving into a printer this feature-rich. As someone who juggles tasks between home and a small business setup, I needed a device that wouldn‚Äôt cry for attention with paper jams or temperamental software. The LaserJet Pro MFP M227fdw was instantly appealing because of its multifunctionality‚Äîprinting, scanning, copying, and faxing‚Äîwithout needing a bachelors' degree in office equipment. Its modest size for a laser printer intrigued me too, especially considering the powerhouse specifications offered.

**A Sleek and Functional Design**

At a glance, the M227fdw doesn't scream high-tech spaceship, but it doesn‚Äôt need to‚Äîit‚Äôs subtle and practical. The all-white plastic body is compact for a multifaceted printer and fits easily on my work desk, which is already cluttered with gadgets and coffee mugs. The 2.7-inch color touchscreen is surprisingly responsive, though navigating tiny menus with my fat fingers felt slightly irksome. Learning the functions didn't require a deep dive into the user manual (which I might have tossed to the side after unboxing). However, the build feels solid enough to endure the bumps of daily usage, even if it occasionally feels more utilitarian than premium.

**Performance Stands Out**

After connecting it wirelessly to my network (a process that was eerily painless due to the HP Smart app), the first thing I noticed was the speed. It claimed 30 pages per minute, and while I wasn‚Äôt sitting there with a stopwatch, it‚Äôs safe to say it doesn‚Äôt dawdle. I printed multi-page PDFs, documents with sharp graphs, and even a couple of complex illustrations, and in every scenario, the print quality did not disappoint. The 1200 x 1200 dpi resolution shines clearly, especially on text-heavy prints. The automatic duplex printing was as advertised, saving me time and, surprisingly, paper costs in the long run. Have I ever been this excited about two-sided printing? Probably not.

[Check HP M227fdw price on Amazon](https://powerfinders.com/p/b01lzw2l1p/)

**Comprehensive Feature Set for Modern Needs**

This isn‚Äôt just your average run-of-the-mill printer‚Äîit‚Äôs Alexa compatible. While I didn‚Äôt use voice control for printing as much as I thought I would (because honestly, shouting at a printer still feels absurd), it worked seamlessly when tested. My family had no problem printing from their smartphones or laptops, thanks to features like AirPrint, Google Cloud Print, and Wi-Fi Direct. I also tried moving files directly from a USB drive to the print queue using the USB port; spoiler alert, it worked without nagging about unsupported file types. You can even fiddle with advanced scanner settings, though the flatbed scanner doesn‚Äôt handle deeper books well due to the limited lid clearance.

**Highlights**

- Monochrome laser printing that produces crisp, sharp text
- A fast first-page-out time of about 7 seconds
- Automatic duplex printing saves time and resources
- Easy integration with the HP Smart app for mobile printing
- Compact size suits small home offices or desks
- Robust design for daily functions like scanning, faxing, and copying

**Areas for Improvement**

- No color printing option, obviously a deal-breaker if you need it
- The LCD touchscreen, though functional, can feel a little cramped
- While quiet during operation, there is an initial loud whir when the printer powers up
- The cost of original HP toner cartridges can sting‚Äîit‚Äôs worth exploring compatible third-party alternatives

**Competing Options**

Comparing this printer to peers like the Brother HL-2395DW and Canon MF269dw, the M227fdw holds its ground with smart feature integration and reliable app connectivity. Brother‚Äôs offering might edge it out in terms of affordability in toner replacements, and Canon gives slightly better scanning performance. However, neither competes with HP‚Äôs straightforward mobile printing capabilities or its JetAdvantage Security Manager designed for peace of mind with sensitive documents. If you favor reliability and speed packed with ease of use, this model is a robust choice.

**Smart Spending**

This laser printer isn‚Äôt cheap, but like many office gadgets, it‚Äôs the value over months (or years) that truly counts. The operational efficiency‚Äîfaster speeds, higher tonality quality‚Äîjustifies the cost better compared to slightly less expensive alternatives. It‚Äôs perfect for anyone aiming to streamline document management at home or in smaller offices. Those auto-duplexing features alone feel like a luxury I didn‚Äôt realize I needed until I had them.

It's been a few weeks now with the COLETTI 09 Cup Bozeman Percolator Coffee Pot, and I'll be honest‚Äîit wasn‚Äôt love at first sight, but it grew on me. The body is constructed entirely of stainless steel, and I absolutely appreciate the absence of aluminum or plastic parts. As a coffee enthusiast (some might call it an addiction), I‚Äôve had my fair share of coffee makers; the simplicity of this traditional design quickly became a favorite. The glass view top is such a vintage touch, letting me observe the brewing process in a surprisingly satisfying way. Plus, it fits snugly on my stovetop, with dimensions that don‚Äôt dominate your kitchen at 7.64""D x 7.4""W x 5.34""H.  

**Find the best price for COLETTI 09 Cup on Amazon.**  

**Perfect Brewing on the Campsite and at Home**  
One major test for me was taking this percolator out camping. Nothing beats sipping a hot cup of coffee surrounded by nature, and this little pot passed with flying colors. It‚Äôs tough as nails‚Äîstainless steel construction means it handles the rough-and-tumble of outdoor adventures without any dents or leaks. Given its manual operation, it works seamlessly on campfires and portable stoves, which is ideal. It‚Äôs not just for campers though. Back at home, it consistently delivers rich, full-bodied coffee flavor, the kind you don‚Äôt get from plug-it-in-and-wait machines.

**Strengths**  
- All-steel build with no plastic or aluminum.  
- Performs exceptionally well on stovetops and campfires.  
- Produces bold, traditional coffee with deep flavor.  
- Glass top offers a charming glimpse as coffee percolates.  

**Quirky Cleaning and Maintenance Insights**  
I‚Äôll admit, I initially dreaded cleaning it‚Äîstovetop coffee makers can sometimes feel like a hassle. Yet, surprisingly, this one is dishwasher safe (a revelation for lazy cleaners like me) and super easy to rinse on-the-go when camping. However, it‚Äôs worth noting its filter type utilizes disc filters. The included 15-pack of filters is handy, but tracking down replacements might become a chore if you don‚Äôt plan ahead. Though it brews efficiently, you‚Äôll have to keep a close eye and adjust the heat on the stovetop to avoid boiling over.  

**Drawbacks**  
- Temperature management during brewing takes practice.  
- Limited filter replacement availability might be inconvenient.  

**Who Would Love This Coffee Maker?**  
This percolator is certainly for traditionalists and those who enjoy the hands-on experience of coffee brewing. It‚Äôs built for adventurers‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre out in the wild or having a cozy kitchen coffee moment. Lightweight at 2 pounds, easy to pack, and with its stainless-steel exterior, this is the rugged travel companion your caffeine cravings have been waiting for. Still, it may not suit those who lean towards automated coffee options or dislike the extra step of managing heat on the stovetop.  

**Diving into Market Rivals**  
There‚Äôs no shortage of competition when it comes to portable coffee makers. The Stanley Camp Percolator is another no-plastic option, but its aluminum build misses the all-stainless steel appeal here. On the flip side, the Farberware Yosemite gets praise for affordability but lacks the rustic glass top that gives the COLETTI its charm. Honestly, the COLETTI bridges the gap between functionality and nostalgia like no other, making it a standout among peer products.  

**Cost-Effectiveness Analysis**  
When you think about ""money's worth,"" the COLETTI 09 Cup delivers plenty for its price. Unlike its electric counterparts that often break after mere months of use, this guy is built to last, and the lifetime replacement guarantee is a cherry on top. In essence, you‚Äôre investing not just in a coffee maker but in a lifetime of dependable brewing. However, if you‚Äôre on a tight coffee budget and don‚Äôt see yourself doing stovetop or off-grid brewing often, more economical drip machines might be worth considering.

I am constantly building rapport with them, which means I tend to simply agree with anything they say that isn't substantial or pertinent to my job. Doing this over and over has made me so numb to freaking everything.  
""Oh your cat died- That's sad"" (I feel nothing)  
""Oh your mom is doing better in the hospital- that's good"" (I feel nothing)

I don't love how I feel numb around clients but I can understand it's simply just part of my job, and it makes me more likeable. But recently I've been feeling that way about my personal friends and even myself. For example, my aunt recently lost her pet bird, and was telling me about how sad she was and all the things she's doing to find it. And I care about her a lot, and I care about the bird- And the whole time I just kept thinking ""I don't care"" over and over. Nothing seems to be interesting, or emotional for me anymore.

And I'm not a narcissist! I feel like there's nothing interesting happening to me either. My husband and I just spend a month putting together a really impressive fish tank. Over the course of a month, we've worked hard and there were enough challenges with it, I could go deeply in-depth about it and several objectively interesting aspects of it. But when I got coffee with a friend and she mentioned she saw it on social media, I just said """"Yep. It's a fish tank"" And I had this PHYSICAL reaction of internal disgust and I thought to myself ""If I have to talk and elaborate on this boring tank, I'm going to roll over and die"" Or, when I'm asked about my work, I can think of 2-3 interesting stories, but I feel so disgusting in having to talk about it. And if I'm socially ""forced"" to tell a story- the whole time, in my head I'm thinking ""Oh my god, I don't care about this""

Brew Beauty - Femme Fatale Closest dupe I've found to Kayali Vanilla 28. Fresh well balanced opening and Slightly sweet with a chocolate liquor note in the dry down. performs well.

Brew Beauty - (fav)Hot Cocoa & Cream cocoa powder and steamed milk with a hint of freshness. Cozy, festive, reminds me of the same BBW's candle i saw in store during Christmas last year, very comforting and yummy.

Aquatic yet luxurious; smells so simple yet so fresh! The notes are similar to jo malone wood sage and sea salt. This is unisex and perfect for summer. Wore it all day and loved it.

Sharon Beauty - Beige Sugar (sample) A simple delicious gourmand . Very Straightforward chocolate scent, like compound milk chocolate.Not too sweet, light and easy. Not similar to lataffa eclair or muse.

Sharon Beauty - Midnight Dessert (sample, upcoming EDP launch) Warm pie with blueberry compote. No sour and tart like smell. Cozy,
extremely well-formulated, and probably the best blueberry scent I've tried. Initially thought this was going to be disaster like bbw blueberry bundt cake but boy i was blown. The owner is sending this sample to all recent orders. Launching in September mid i guess.

I am from the US and recently finished my undergraduate university programs (one in STEM, the other in social sciences) in May! Despite hunting for full-time career positions and working part-time as a coffee barista, not being a student anymore has left me with a lot of free time. Dedicating a portion of it to the art of writing long emails has been a great way to kill the boredom, as well as to learn about others.

I am not musically talented myself, but listening to music is my biggest hobby. I enjoy collecting CDs, and recently taught myself how to burn them and get crafty with creating custom mixtapes. I also love thrifting/antiquing, reading, taking care of my house plants, and going to caf√©s. 

Additionally, I really love to travel! I have been to 7 countries so far and am hoping to expand that list. One of my long-term goals is to go on a solo trip somewhere. 

Location and gender don't matter to me, but I am primarily looking for penpals closer to my age (21-25). For now, I am only looking for email correspondence. If you're interested, please don't hesitate to reach out!",3,1755881795.0,penpals,0,1.0,False

1mxbwez,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1mxbwez/some_girls_bite_novel_by_chloe_neill_free_read/,Some Girls Bite  Novel by Chloe Neill Free Read online,"At first, I wondered if it was karmic punishment. I'd sneered at the fancy vampires, and as some kind of cosmic retribution, I'd been made one. Vampire. Predator. Initiate into one of the oldest of the twelve vampire Houses in the United States.  
  
¬† And I wasn't just one of them.  
  
¬† I was one of the best.  
  
¬† But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let me begin by telling you how I became a vampire, a story that starts weeks before my twenty-eighth birthday, the night I completed the transition. The night I awoke in the back of a limousine, three days after I'd been attacked walking across the University of Chicago campus.  
  
¬† I didn't remember all the details of the attack. But I remembered enough to be thrilled to be alive. To be shocked to be alive.  
  
¬† In the back of the limousine, I squeezed my eyes shut and tried to unpack the memory of the attack. I'd heard footsteps, the sound muffled by dewy grass, before he grabbed me. I'd screamed and kicked, tried to fight my way out, but he pushed me down. He was preternaturally strong - supernaturally strong - and he bit my neck with a predatory ferocity that left little doubt about who he was. What he was.  
  
¬† Vampire.  
  
¬† But while he tore into skin and muscle, he didn't drink; he didn't have time. Without warning, he'd stopped and jumped away, running between buildings at the edge of the main quad.  
  
¬† My attacker temporarily vanquished, I'd raised a hand to the crux of my neck and shoulder, felt the sticky warmth. My vision was dimming, but I could see the wine- colored stain across my fingers clearly enough.  
  
¬† Then there was movement around me. Two men.  
  
¬† The men my attacker had been afraid of.  
  
¬† The first of them had sounded anxious. ""He was fast. You'll need to hurry, Liege. ""  
  
¬† The second had been unerringly confident. ""I'll get it done. ""  
  
¬† He pulled me up to my knees, and knelt behind me, a supportive arm around my waist. He wore cologne - soapy and clean.  
  
¬† I tried to move, to give some struggle, but I was fading.  
  
¬† ""Be still. ""  
  
¬† ""She's lovely. ""  
  
¬† ""Yes,"" he agreed. He suckled the wound at my neck. I twitched again, and he stroked my hair. ""Be still. ""  
  
¬† I recalled very little of the next three days, of the genetic restructuring that transformed me into a vampire. Even now, I only carry a handful of memories. Deep-seated, dull pain - shocks of it that bowed my body. Numbing cold. Darkness. A pair of intensely green eyes.  
  
¬† In the limo, I felt for the scars that should have marred my neck and shoulders. The vampire that attacked me hadn't taken a clean bite - he'd torn at the skin at my neck like a starved animal. But the skin was smooth. No scars. No bumps. No bandages. I pulled my hand away and stared at the clean pale skin - and the short nails, perfectly painted cherry red.  
  
¬† The blood was gone - and I'd been manicured.  
  
¬† Staving off a wash of dizziness, I sat up. I was wearing different clothes. I'd been in jeans and a T-shirt. Now I wore a black cocktail dress, a sheath that fell to just below my knees, and three-inch-high black heels.  
  
¬† That made me a twenty-seven-year-old attack victim, clean and absurdly scar-free, wearing a cocktail dress that wasn't mine. I knew, then and there, that they'd made me one of them.  
  
¬† The Chicagoland Vampires.  
  
¬† It had started eight months ago with a letter, a kind of vampire manifesto first published in the Sun-Times and Trib, then picked up by papers across the country. It was a coming-out, an announcement to the world of their existence. Some humans believed it a hoax, at least until the press conference that followed, in which three of them displayed their fangs. Human panic led to four days of riots in the Windy City and a run on water and canned goods sparked by public fear of a vampire apocalypse. The feds finally stepped in, ordering Congressional investigations, the hearings obsessively filmed and televised in order to pluck out every detail of the vampires' existence. And even though they'd been the ones to step forward, the vamps were tight-lipped about those details - the fang bearing, blood drinking, and night walking the only facts the public could be sure about.  
  
¬† Eight months later, some humans were still afraid. Others were obsessed. With the lifestyle, with the lure of immortality, with the vampires themselves. In particular, with Celina Desaulniers, the glamorous Windy City she-vamp who'd apparently orchestrated the coming-out, and who'd made her debut during the first day of the Congressional hearings.  
  
¬† Celina was tall and slim and sable-haired, and that day she wore a black suit snug enough to give the illusion that it had been poured onto her body. Looks aside, she was obviously smart and savvy, and she knew how to twist humans around her fingers. To wit: The senior senator from Idaho had asked her what she planned to do now that vampires had come out of the closet.  
  
¬† She'd famously replied in dulcet tones, ""I'll be making the most of the dark. ""  
  
¬† The twenty-year Congressional veteran had smiled with such dopey-eyed lust that a picture of him made the front page of the New York Times.  
  
¬† No such reaction from me. I'd rolled my eyes and flipped off the television.  
  
¬† I'd made fun of them, of her, of their pretensions.  
  
¬† And in return, they'd made me like them.  
  
¬† Wasn't karma a bitch?  
  
¬† Now they were sending me back home, but returning me differently. Notwithstanding the changes my body had endured, they'd glammed me up, cleaned me of blood, stripped me of clothing, and repackaged me in their image.  
  
¬† They killed me. They healed me. They changed me.  
  
¬† The tiny seed, that kernel of distrust of the ones who'd made me, rooted.  
  
¬† I was still dizzy when the limousine stopped in front of the Wicker Park brownstone I shared with my roommate, Mallory. I wasn't sleepy, but groggy, mired in a haze across my consciousness that felt thick enough to wade through. Drugs, maybe, or a residual effect of the transition from human to vampire.  
  
¬† Mallory stood on the stoop, her shoulder-length ice blue hair shining beneath the bare bulb of the overhead light. She looked anxious, but seemed to be expecting me. She wore flannel pajamas patterned with sock monkeys. I realized it was late.  
  
¬† The limousine door opened, and I looked toward the house and then into the face of a man in a black uniform and cap who'd peeked into the backseat.  
  
¬† ""Ma'am?"" He held out a hand expectantly.  
  
¬† My fingers in his palm, I stepped onto the asphalt, my ankles wobbly in the stilettos. I rarely wore heels, jeans being my preferred uniform. Grad school didn't require much else.  
  
¬† I heard a door shut. Seconds later, a hand gripped my elbow. My gaze traveled down the pale, slender arm to the bespectacled face it belonged to. She smiled at me, the woman who held my arm, the woman who must have emerged from the limo's front seat.  
  
¬† ""Hello, dear. We're home now. I'll help you inside, and we'll get you settled. ""  
  
¬† Grogginess making me acquiescent, and not really having a good reason to argue anyway, I nodded to the woman, who looked to be in her late fifties. She had a short, sensible bob of steel gray hair and wore a tidy suit on her trim figure, carrying herself with a professional confidence. As we progressed down the sidewalk, Mallory moved cautiously down the first step, then the second, toward us.  
  
¬† ""Merit?""  
  
¬† The woman patted my back. ""She'll be fine, dear. She's just a little dizzy. I'm Helen. You must be Mallory?""  
  
¬† Mallory nodded, but kept her gaze on me.  
  
¬† ""Lovely home. Can we go inside?""  
  
¬† Mallory nodded again and traveled back up the steps. I began to follow, but the woman's grip on my arm stopped me.  
""You go by Merit, dear? Although that's your last name?""  
  
¬† I nodded at her.  
  
¬† She smiled patiently. ""The newly risen utilize only a single name. Merit, if that's what you go by, would be yours. Only the Masters of each House are allowed to retain their last names. That's just one of the rules you'll need to remember. "" She leaned in conspiratorially. ""And it's considered declasse to break the rules. ""  
  
¬† Her soft admonition sparked something in my mind, like the beam of a flashlight in the dark. I blinked at her. ""Some would consider changing a person without their consent declasse, Helen. ""  
  
¬† The smile Helen fixed on her face didn't quite reach her eyes. ""You were made a vampire in order to save your life, Merit. Consent is irrelevant. "" She glanced at Mallory ""She could probably use a glass of water. I'll give you two a moment. ""  
  
¬† Mallory nodded, and Helen, who carried an ancient-looking leather satchel, moved past her into the brownstone. I walked up the remaining stairs on my own, but stopped when I reached Mallory. Her blue eyes swam with tears, a frown curving her cupid's bow mouth. She was extraordinarily, classically pretty, which was the reason she'd given for tinting her hair with packets of blue Kool-Aid. She claimed it was a way for her to distinguish herself. It was unusual, sure, but it wasn't a bad look for an ad executive, for a woman defined by her creativity.  
  
¬† ""You're - "" She shook her head, then started again. ""It's been three days. I didn't know where you were. I called your parents when you didn't come home. Your dad said he'd handle it. He told me not to call the police. He said someone had called him, told him you'd been attacked but were okay. That you were healing. They told your dad they'd bring you home when you were ready. I got a call a few minutes ago. They said you were on your way home. "" She pulled me into a fierce hug. ""I'm gonna beat the shit out of you for not calling. ""  
  
¬† Mal pulled back, gave me a head-to-toe evaluation. ""They said - you'd been changed. ""  
  
¬† I nodded, tears threatening to spill over.  
  
¬† ""So you're a vampire?"" she asked.  
  
¬† ""I think. I just woke up or . . . I don't know. ""  
  
¬† ""Do you feel any different?""  
  
¬† ""I feel . . . slow. ""  
  
¬† Mallory nodded with confidence. ""Effects of the change, probably. They say that happens. Things will settle. "" Mallory would know; unlike me, she followed all the vamp- related news. She offered a weak smile. ""Hey, you're still Merit, right?""  
  
¬† Weirdly, I felt a prickle in the air emanating from my best friend and roommate. A tingle of something electric. But still sleepy, dizzy, I dismissed it.  
  
¬† ""I'm still me,"" I told her.  
  
¬† And I hoped that was true.  
  
¬† The brownstone had been owned by Mallory's great-aunt until her death four years ago. Mallory, who lost her parents in a car accident when she was young, inherited the house and everything in it, from the chintzy rugs that covered the hardwood floors, to the antique furniture, to the oil paintings of flower vases. It wasn't chic, but it was home, and it smelled like it - lemon-scented wood polish, cookies, dusty coziness. It smelled the same as it had three days go, but I realized that the scent was deeper. Richer.  
  
¬† Improved vampire senses, maybe?  
  
¬† When we entered the living room, Helen was sitting at the edge of our gingham- patterned sofa, her legs crossed at the ankles. A glass of water sat on the coffee table in front of her.  
  
¬† ""Come in, ladies. Have a seat. "" She smiled and patted the couch. Mallory and I exchanged a glance and sat down. I took the seat next to Helen. Mallory sat on the matching love seat that faced the couch. Helen handed me the glass of water.  
  
¬† I brought it to my lips, but paused before sipping. ""I can - eat and drink things other than blood?""  
  
¬† Helen's laugh tinkled. ""Of course, dear. You can eat whatever you'd like. But you'll need blood for its nutritional value. "" She leaned toward me, touched my bare knee with the tips of her fingers. ""And I daresay you'll enjoy it!"" She said the words like she was imparting a delicious secret, sharing scandalous gossip about her next-door neighbor.  
  
¬† I sipped, discovered that water still tasted like water. I put the glass back on the table.  
  
¬† Helen tapped her hands against her knees, then favored us both with a bright smile. ""Well, let's get to it, shall we?"" She reached into the satchel at her feet and pulled out a dictionary-sized leather-bound book. The deep burgundy cover was inscribed in embossed gold letters - Canon of the North American Houses, Desk Reference. ""This is everything you need to know about joining Cadogan House. It's not the full Canon, obviously, as the series is voluminous, but this will cover the basics""  
  
¬† ""Cadogan House?"" Mallory asked. ""Seriously?""  
  
¬† I blinked at Mallory, then Helen. ""What's Cadogan House?""  
  
¬† Helen looked at me over the top of her horn-rimmed glasses. ""That's the House that you'll be Commended into. One of Chicago's three vampire Houses - Navarre, Cadogan, Grey. Only the Master of each House has the privilege of turning new vampires. You were turned by Cadogan's Master - ""  
  
¬† ""Ethan Sullivan,"" Mallory finished.  
  
¬† Helen nodded approvingly. ""That's right. ""  
  
¬† I lifted brows at Mallory.  
  
¬† ""Internet,"" she said. ""You'd be amazed. ""  
  
¬† ""Ethan is the House's second Master. He followed Peter Cadogan into the dark, so to speak. ""  
  
¬† If only Masters could turn new vampires, this Ethan Sullivan must have been the vamp in the quad, the one who bit me during round two.  
  
¬† ""This House,"" I began. ""I'm, what, in a vampire sorority or something?""  
  
¬† Helen shook her head. ""It's more complicated than that. All legitimate vampires in the world are affiliated with one House or other. There are currently twelve Houses in the United States; Cadogan is the fourth-oldest among those. "" Helen sat up even straighter, so I took a wild guess that she was also a flag-flying member of Cadogan House.  
  
¬† Helen handed me the book, which must have weighed ten pounds. I centered it in my lap, distributing the mass.  
  
¬† ""You won't need to memorize the rules, of course, but you'll want to read the introductory sections and have at least a passing familiarity with the content. And of course you can refer to the text if you have specific questions. Make sure to read about the Commendation. ""  
  
¬† ""What's the Commendation?""  
  
¬† ""The initiation ceremony. You'll become an official member of the House, and you'll take your oaths to Ethan and the rest of the Cadogan vampires. And speaking of, payments typically begin two weeks after take the oath is taken. ""  
  
¬† I blinked. ""Payments?""  
  
¬† She gave me one of those over-the-glasses looks. ""Your salary, dear. ""  
  
¬† I laughed nervously, the sound strangled. ""I don't need a salary. I'm a student. Teaching assistant. Stipend. "" I was three years into my graduate work, three chapters into my dissertation on romantic medieval literature.  
  
¬† Helen frowned. ""Dear, you can't go back to school. The university doesn't admit vampires as students, and they certainly don't employ them. Title VII doesn't cover us yet. We went ahead and removed you, just to avoid the squabble, so you won't have to worry about - ""  
  
¬† My pulse thudded in my ears. ""What do you mean, you removed me?""  
  
¬† Her expression softened. ""Merit, you're a vampire. A Cadogan Initiate. You can't go back to that life. ""  
  
¬† I was out the door before she was done talking, her voice echoing behind me as I rushed to the first-floor bedroom that served as our office. I wiggled the mouse to wake my computer, brought up a Web browser, and logged into the university server. The system recognized me, and my stomach unclenched in relief.  
  
¬† Then I brought up my records.  
  
¬† Two days ago, my status had been changed. I was listed as ""Not Enrolled. ""  
  
¬† The world shifted.  
  
¬† I went back to the living room, my voice wavering as I fought through the quickly rising panic, and faced Helen. ""What did you do? You had no right to take me out o  
f school!""  
  
¬† Helen turned back to her satchel and pulled out a sheath of paper, her manner irritatingly calm. ""Because Ethan feels your circumstances are . . . particular, you'll receive your salary from the House within the next ten business days. We've already arranged the direct deposit. The Commendation is scheduled on your seventh day, six days from now. You will appear when commanded. At the ceremony, Ethan will assign your position of service within the House. "" She smiled at me. ""Perhaps something in public relations, given your family's connections to the city. ""  
  
¬† ""Oh, lady. Wrong move, bringing up the parents,"" Mallory muttered.  
  
¬† She was right. It was exactly the wrong thing to say, my parents being one of my least favorite topics. But it was at least jarring enough to wake me from my daze. ""I think we're done here,"" I told her. ""It's time for you to leave. ""  
  
¬† Helen winged up an eyebrow. ""It's not your house. ""  
  
¬† Brave of her to piss off the new vampire. But we were on my turf now, and I had allies.  
  
¬† I turned to Mallory with an evil grin. ""How about we find out how much of the vampire myth is actually myth? Don't vampires have to have an invitation to be in someone's home?""  
  
¬† ""I love the way you think,"" Mal said, then went to the door and opened it. ""Helen,"" she said, ""I want you out of my house. ""  
  
¬† Something stirred in the air, a sudden breeze that blew through the doorway and ruffled Mallory's hair - and raised goose bumps along my arms.  
  
¬† ""This is incredibly rude,"" Helen said, but yanked her satchel up. ""Read the book, sign the forms. There's blood in the refrigerator. Drink it - a pint every other day. Stay away from sunlight and aspen stakes, and come when he commands you. "" She neared the door, and then, suddenly, like someone had flipped the switch on a vacuum, she was sucked onto the stoop.  
  
¬† I rushed to the doorway. Helen stood on the top step, glasses askew, staring back at us in disheveled shock. After a moment, she straightened her skirt and glasses, turned crisply, and walked down the stairs and toward the limo. ""That was - very rude,"" she called back. ""Don't think I won't tell Ethan about this!""  
  
¬† I gave her a pageant wave - hand cupped, barely swiveling.  
  
¬† ""You do that, Helen,"" Mallory dared. ""And tell him we said to fuck off while you're at it. ""  
  
¬† Helen turned to look at me, eyes blazing silver. Like, supernaturally silver. ""You were undeserving,"" she sniped.  
  
¬† ""I was unconsenting,"" I corrected and slammed the heavy oak door shut with enough force that it rattled the hinges. After the scritch of rocks on asphalt signaled the limo's retreat, I leaned back against the door and looked at Mallory.  
  
¬† She glared back. ""They said you were on campus by yourself in the middle of the night!"" She punched my arm, disgust obvious on her face. ""What the hell were you thinking?""  
  
¬† That, I thought, was the release of the panic she'd suffered until she learned that I was coming home. It tightened my throat, knowing that she'd waited for me, worried for me.  
  
¬† ""I had work to do. ""  
  
¬† ""In the middle of the night?!""  
  
¬† ""I said I had work to do!"" I threw up my hands, irritation rising. ""God, Mallory, this isn't my fault. "" My knees began to shake. I moved the few steps back to the couch and sat down. Repressed fear, horror, and violation overwhelmed me. I covered my face with my hands as the tears began to fall. ""It wasn't my fault, Mallory. Everything - my life, school - is gone, and it wasn't my fault. ""  
  
¬† I felt the cushion dip beside me and an arm around my shoulders.  
  
¬† ""Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm freaked out. I was so scared, Mer, Jesus. I know it's not your fault. "" She held me while I sobbed, rubbed my back while I cried hard enough to hiccup, while I mourned the loss of my life, of my humanity.  
  
¬† We sat there together for a long time, my best friend and I. She offered Kleenex as I replayed the few things I could remember - the attack, the second set of vampires, the cold and pain, the hazy limo ride.  
  
¬† When I'd sobbed my body empty of tears, Mallory stroked the hair from my face. ""It'll be okay. I promise. I'll call the university in the morning. And if you can't go back . . . we'll figure something out. In the meantime, you should call your grandfather. He'll want to know you're okay. ""  
  
¬† I shook my head, not yet ready to have that conversation. My grandfather's love had always been unconditional, but then again, I'd always been human. I wasn't ready to test the correlation. ""I'll start with Mom and Dad,"" I promised. ""Then I'll let word trickle down. ""  
  
¬† ""Tacky,"" Mallory accused, but let it go. ""The House, I guess it was, did call me, but I don't know who else they contacted. The call was pretty short. 'Merit was attacked on campus two nights ago. In order to save her life, we've made her a vampire. She'll return home tonight. She may be dizzy from the change, so please be home to assist her during the first crucial hours. Thank you. ' It sounded like a recording, to be real honest. ""  
  
¬† ""So this Ethan Sullivan's a cheapo,"" I concluded. ""We'll add that to the list of reasons we don't like him. ""  
  
¬† ""Him turning you into a soul-sucking creature of the night being number one on that list?""  
  
¬† I nodded ruefully. ""That's definitely number one. "" I shifted and glanced over at her. ""They made me like them. He made me like them, this Sullivan. ""  
  
¬† Mallory made a sound of frustration. ""I know. I am so effing jealous. "" Mal was a student of the paranormal; as long as I'd known her, she'd had a keen interest in all things fanged and freaky. She put her palm to her chest. ""I'm the occultist in the family, and yet it's you, the English lit geek, they turn? Even Buffy would feel that sting. Although,"" she said, her gaze appraising, ""you will make damn good research material. ""  
  
¬† I snorted. ""But research material for what? Who the hell am I now?""  
  
¬† ""You're Merit,"" she said with conviction that warmed my heart. ""But kind of Merit 2. 0. And I have to say, the phone call notwithstanding, this Sullivan's not a cheapo about everything. Those shoes are Jimmy Choo, and that dress is runway-worthy. "" She clucked her tongue. ""He's dressed you up like his own personal model. And frankly, Mer, you look good. ""  
  
¬† Good, I thought, was relative. I looked down at the cocktail dress, smoothed my hands over the slick, black fabric. ""I liked who I was, Mal. My life wasn't perfect, but I was happy. ""  
  
¬† ""I know, hon. But maybe you'll like this, too. ""  
  
¬† I doubted it. Seriously.

¬† RICH PEOPLE AREN'T NICER - THEY JUST HAVE BETTER CARS  
  
¬† My parents were new-money Chicago.  
  
¬† My grandfather, Chuck Merit, had served the city for thirty-four years as a cop - walking a beat in Chicago's South Side until he joined the CPD's Bureau of Investigative Services. He was a legend in the Chicago Police Department.  
  
¬† But while he brought home a solid middle-class living, things were occasionally tight for the family. My grandmother came from money, but she'd turned down an inheritance from her overbearing, old-Chicago-money-having father. Although it was her decision, my father blamed my grandfather for the fact that he wasn't raised in the lifestyle to which he thought he should have been accustomed. Burned by the imagined betrayal and irritated by a childhood of living carefully on a cop's salary, my father made it his personal goal to accumulate as much money as possible, to the exclusion of everything else.  
  
¬† He was very, very good at it.  
  
¬† Merit Properties, my father's real estate development company, managed high-rises and apartment complexes throughout the city. He was also a member of the powerful Chicago Growth Council, which was made up of representatives of the city's business community and which advised the city's newly reelected mayor, Seth Tate, on planning and development issues. My father took great pride in, and often remarked upon, his relationship with Tate. Frankly, I just thought that reflected poorly on the mayor.  
  
¬† Of course, because I'd grown up a Chicago Merit, I'd been able to reap the benefits that came with the name - big house, summer camp, ballet lessons, nice clothes. But while the financial benefits were great, my parents, especially my father, were not the most compassionate people. Joshua Merit wanted to create a legacy, all else be damned. He wanted the perfect wife, the perfect children, and the perfect position among Chicago's social and financial elite. Little wonder that I worshipped my grandparents, who understood the meaning of unconditional love.  
  
¬† I couldn't imagine my father was going to be happy about my new vampiric identity. But I was a big girl, so after I washed my face of tears, I got into my car - an old boxy Volvo I'd scrimped to pay for - and drove to their home in Oak Park.  
  
¬† When I arrived, I parked the Volvo in the drive that arced in front of the house. The building was a massive postmodern concrete box, completely out of place next to the more subtle Prairie Style buildings around it. Money clearly did not buy taste.  
  
¬† I walked to the front door. It was opened before I could knock. I glanced up. Dour gray eyes looked down at me from nearly seven feet of skinny white guy. ""Ms. Merit. ""  
  
¬† ""Hello, Peabody. ""  
  
¬† ""Pennebaker. ""  
  
¬† ""That's what I said. "" Of course I knew his name. Pennebaker, the butler, was my father's first big purchase. Pennebaker had a ""spare the rod"" mentality about child rearing and always took my father's side - snooping, tattling, and generally sparing no details about what he imagined was my rebellious childhood. Realistically, I was probably lower than average in the rebellion department, but I had perfect siblings - my older sister, Charlotte, now married to a heart surgeon and pumping out children, and my older brother, Robert, who was being groomed to take over the family business. As a single twenty-seven-year-old graduate student, even though studying at one of the best universities in the country, I was a second-class Merit. And now I was coming home with a big ol' nasty.  
  
¬† I walked inside, feeling the woosh of air on my back as Pennebaker shut the door firmly behind me and then stepped in front of me.  
  
¬† ""Your parents are in the front parlor,"" he intoned. ""You are expected. They've been unduly concerned about your welfare. You worry your father with these"" - he looked down disdainfully - ""things you get involved in. ""  
  
¬† I took offense to that, but opted not to correct his misunderstanding of the degree to which I'd consented to being changed. He wouldn't have believed me anyway.  
  
¬† I walked past him, following the hallway to the front parlor and pushing open the room's top-hinged door. My mother, Meredith Merit, rose from one of the room's severe boxy sofas. Even at eleven p. m. , she wore heels and a linen dress, a strand of pearls around her neck. Her blond hair was perfectly coiffed, her eyes pale green.  
  
¬† Mom rushed to me, hands extended. ""You're okay?"" She cupped my cheeks with long- nailed fingers and looked me over. ""You're okay?""  
  
¬† I smiled politely. ""I'm fine. "" Relative to their understanding, that was true.  
  
¬† My father, tall and lean like me, with the same chestnut hair and blue eyes, was on the opposite sofa, still in a suit despite the hour. He looked at me over half-cocked reading glasses, a move he might as well have borrowed from Helen, but it was no less effective on a human than a vampire. He snapped closed the paper he'd been reading and placed it on the couch beside him.  
  
¬† ""Vampires?"" He managed to make the single word both a question and an accusation.  
  
¬† ""I was attacked on campus. ""  
  
¬† My mother gasped, clutched a hand to her heart, and looked back at my father. ""Joshua! On campus! They're attacking people!""  
  
¬† My father kept his gaze on me, but I could see the surprise in his eyes. ""Attacked?""  
  
¬† ""I was attacked by one vampire, but a different vampire turned me. "" I recalled the few words I'd heard, the fear in the voice of Ethan Sullivan's companion. ""I think the first one ran away, was scared away, and the second ones were afraid I was going to die. "" Not quite the truth - the companion feared it might happen; Sullivan seemed supremely confident it would. And that he could alter my fate when it did.  
  
¬† ""Two sets of vampires? At U. of C. ?""  
  
¬† I shrugged, having wondered the same thing.  
  
¬† My father crossed his legs. ""And speaking of, why, in God's name, were you wandering around campus by yourself in the middle of the night?""  
  
¬† A spark fired in my stomach. Anger, maybe mixed with a hint of self-pity, not uncommon emotions when it came to dealing with my father. I usually played meek, fearful that raising my voice would push my parents to voice their own long-lived desires for a different younger daughter. But to everything, there is a season, right?  
  
¬† ""I was working. ""  
  
¬† His responsive huff said plenty.  
  
¬† ""I was working,"" I repeated, twenty-seven years of pent-up assertiveness in my tone. ""I was heading to pick up some papers, and I was attacked. It wasn't a choice, and it wasn't my fault. He tore out my throat. ""  
  
¬† My father scanned the clear skin at my throat and looked doubtful - God forbid a Merit, a Chicago Merit, couldn't stand up for herself - but he forged ahead. ""And this Cadogan House. They're old, but not as old as Navarre House. ""  
  
¬† Since I hadn't yet mentioned Cadogan House, I assumed whoever had called my parents mentioned the affiliation. And my father had apparently done some research.  
  
¬† ""I don't know much about the Houses,"" I admitted, thinking that was more Mallory's arena.  
  
¬† My father's expression made it clear that he wasn't satisfied by my answer. ""I only got back tonight,"" I said, defending myself. ""They dropped me off at the house two hours ago. I wasn't sure if you'd heard from anyone or thought I was hurt or something, so I came by. ""  
  
¬† ""We got a call. "" His tone was dry. ""From the House. Your roommate - ""  
  
¬† ""Mallory,"" I interrupted. ""Her name is Mallory. ""  
  
¬† "" - told us when you didn't come home. The House called and informed us that you'd been attacked. They said you were recuperating. I contacted your grandfather and your brother and sister, so there was no need to contact the police department. "" He paused. ""I don't want them involved in this, Merit. ""  
  
¬† The fact that my father was unwilling to investigate the attack on his daughter notwithstanding, my scars were gone anyway. I touched my neck. ""I think it's a little late for the police. ""  
  
¬† My father, evidently unimpressed by my forensic analysis, rose from the couch and approached me. ""I've worked hard to bring this family up from nothing. I will not see it torn down again.  
"" His cheeks were flushed crimson. My mother, who'd moved to stand at his side, touched his arm and quietly said his name.  
  
¬† I bristled at the ""again,"" but resisted the urge to argue with my father's assessment of our family history, reminding him, ""Becoming a vampire wasn't my choice. ""  
  
¬† ""You've always had your head in the clouds. Always dreaming about romantic gibberish. "" I assumed that was a knock against my dissertation. ""And now this. "" He walked away, strode to a floor-to-ceiling window, and stared out of it. ""Just - stay on your side of town. And stay out of trouble. ""  
  
¬† I thought he was done, that the admonishment was the end of it, but then he turned, and gazed at me through narrowed eyes. ""And if you do anything to tarnish our name, I'll disinherit you fast enough to make your head spin. ""  
  
¬† My father, ladies and gentlemen.  
  
¬† By the time I made it back to Wicker Park, I was red-eyed and splotchy again, having cried my way east. I didn't know why my father's behavior surprised me; it was completely in keeping with his principal goal in life: improving his social standing. My near-death experience and the fact that I'd become a bloodsucker weren't as important in his tidy little world as the threat I posed to their status.  
  
¬† It was late when I pulled the car into the narrow garage beside the house - nearly one a. m. The brownstone was dark, the neighborhood quiet, and I guessed Mallory was asleep in her upstairs bedroom. Unlike me, she still had a job at her Michigan Avenue ad firm, and she was usually in the Loop by seven a. m. But when I unlocked the front door, I found her on the couch, staring blankly at the television.  
  
¬† ""You need to see this,"" she said, without looking up. I kicked off the heels, walked around the sofa to the television, and stared. The headline at the bottom of the screen read, ominously, Chicagoland vamps deny role in murder.  
  
¬† I looked at Mallory. ""Murder?""  
  
¬† ""They found a girl dead in Grant Park. Her name is Jennifer Porter. Her throat was ripped out. They found her tonight, but think she was killed a week ago - three days before you were attacked. ""  
  
¬† ""Oh, my God. "" I dropped onto the sofa behind me, pulled up my knees. ""They think vamps did this?""  
  
¬† ""Watch,"" Mallory said.  
  
¬† On screen, four men and a woman - Celina Desaulniers - stood behind a wooden podium.  
  
¬† A swath of print and broadcast reporters huddled before it, their microphones, cameras, recorders, and notepads in hand.  
  
¬† In perfect sequence, the quintet stepped forward.  
  
¬† The man in the middle of the group, tall with a spill of dark hair around his shoulders, leaned over the microphone.  
  
¬† ""My name,"" he said, in a wine-warm voice, ""is Alexander. These are my friends and associates. As you know, we are vampires. ""  
  
¬† The room erupted in flashes of light, reporters frantically snapping images of the ensemble. Seemingly oblivious to the flash of the strobes, they stood stoically, side by side, perfectly still.  
  
¬† ""We are here,"" Alexander said, ""to extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Jennifer Porter, and to promise to do our part to assist the Chicago Police Department and other law enforcement agencies in any way that we can. We offer our aid and condemn the acts of those who would take human life. There is no need for such violence, and it has long been abhorred by the civilized among us. As you know, although we must take blood to survive, we have long-established procedures that prevent us from victimizing those who do not share our craving. Murder is perpetrated only by our enemies. And rest assured, my friends, they are your enemies and ours, alike. ""  
  
¬† Alexander paused, but then continued, his voice edgier. ""It has come to our attention that a pendant from one of Chicago's Houses, Cadogan, was found at the crime scene. ""  
  
¬† ""Oh, my God,"" Mallory whispered.  
  
¬† I kept my eyes on the screen.  
  
¬† ""Although our comrades from Cadogan House do drink from humans,"" Alexander continued, ""they are meticulous in ensuring that the humans who donate blood are fully informed and fully consenting. And Chicago's other vampires do not, under any circumstances, take human blood. Thus, it is our belief, although only a hypothesis at this early time, that the medal was placed at the scene of the crime solely to inculpate the residents of Cadogan House. To suggest otherwise is unjustified supposition. ""  
  
¬† Without another word, Alexander fell back in line next to his comrades.  
  
¬† Celina stepped forward. At first, she was silent, her gaze scanning the reporters in front of her. She smiled softly, and you could practically hear the reporters' sighs. But the innocence in her expression was a little too innocent to be believable. A little too forced.  
  
¬† ""We are devastated by the death of Jennifer Porter,"" she said, ""and by the accusations that have been leveled against our colleagues. Although Navarre House vampires do not drink, we respect the decisions of other Houses to engage in that practice. The resources of Navarre House are at the city's disposal. This crime offends us all, and Navarre House will not rest until the killer is caught and prosecuted. ""  
  
¬† Celina nodded at the bank of reporters, then turned and walked offscreen, the rest of her vampires falling in line behind her.  
  
¬† Mallory muted the television and turned back to me. ""What the hell have you gotten yourself into?""  
  
¬† ""They say the Houses aren't involved,"" I pointed out.  
  
¬† ""She says Navarre isn't involved,"" Mallory said. ""She seems pretty willing to throw the other Houses to the wolves. And besides, vampires were involved when you turned up almost dead. A vampire attacked you. That's too many fangs to be coincidental. ""  
  
¬† I caught the direction of her thoughts. ""You think I'm, what, number two? That I was supposed to be the second victim?""  
  
¬† ""You were the second victim,"" she said. She used the remote to turn off the television. ""And I think it's an awfully big coincidence that your throat was ripped out on campus. It's not exactly a park, but it's close enough. Look,"" she said, pointing back at the television.  
  
¬† A picture of Jennifer Porter, a small shot from an ID card, filled the screen. Dark brown hair, blue eyes, just like me.  
  
¬† We shared a moment of silence.  
  
¬† ""And speaking of heinous people,"" Mallory finally said, ""how was the visit home?"" Mallory had met my parents only once, when I couldn't hold off an introduction any longer. She'd just adopted the blue-hair regimen. Needless to say, they weren't impressed. Creativity, even if benign, was not tolerated in the Merit house. After the one visit, during which Mal had barely avoided socking my father in the jaw, I decided not to force them on her again.  
  
¬† ""Not great. ""  
  
¬† ""I'm sorry. ""  
  
¬† I shrugged. ""My expectations were low going in, just not as low as they should have been. "" I took a long look at the giant leather Canon on top of the coffee table, then reached out and pulled it into my lap. ""They were concerned, I guess, but mostly I got a lecture about embarrassing the family. "" I put my hands in the air, waggled my fingers for dramatic effect. ""You know, the Chicago Merits. Like that means anything. ""  
  
¬† Mallory snorted softly. ""Unfortunately, it does mean something. You only have to look at the Trib to know that. Did you go see your grandpa?""  
  
¬† ""Not yet. ""  
  
¬† ""You need to. ""  
  
¬† ""I will,"" I quickly replied, ""when I'm up to it. ""  
  
¬† ""Bullshit,"" she said, grabbing the cordless phone from its cradle next to the couch. ""He's more of a father to you than Joshua ever was. And you know he's always up. Call him. "" She handed the receiver over, and I clutched it, stared down at the rubbery blue buttons.

1mxbvik,https://www.getzealthy.com/post/find-heathy-fast-food-options-for-fat-loss,Find Heathy Fast Food Options for Fat Loss,"Fast food is often viewed as a barrier to weight loss, given its reputation for being high in calories, sugar, and unhealthy fats.

This guide will walk you through top fast food options, menu and tips to help you check out meals on the go without compromising your goals.

# How Fast Food Can Fit into Fat Loss Goals

Fat loss ultimately comes down to a balance of calories in versus calories out. Fast food can fit into this equation when chosen carefully.

# Strategies for Making Healthier Fast Food Choices

Here are practical fast-food menus with your fat loss goals in mind.

# Customize Your Order

Many fast-food items come with added sauces, cheeses, or fried toppings that can be easily omitted to reduce calories.

* **Hold the Sauce**: Mayo-based sauces add calories and fat; ask for mustard or salsa instead.
* **Skip the Cheese**: Cheese adds fat and calories. If you don‚Äôt need it, skip it.
* **Choose Whole Grains**: When available, select whole-grain buns or wraps to increase fiber intake.
* **Add Extra Veggies**: Most fast-food chains allow you to add vegetables to your order, increasing fiber and nutrients.

# Watch Your Beverages

Sugary drinks can add hundreds of calories to your meal. Here are some tips for making smarter beverage choices:

* **Stick to Water**: Water is calorie-free and helps with hydration.
* **Opt for Unsweetened Tea or Black Coffee**: These are great low-calorie options.
* **Be Wary of Smoothies**: Although some smoothies appear healthy, they can be high in sugars and calories, especially if they‚Äôre large in size.

# Smart Side Choices

Sides are often calorie-dense, so choosing lighter options can help you stay within your calorie budget.

* **Skip the Fries**: Go for side salads, apple slices, or yogurt.
* **Avoid Value Deals**: These often encourage you to buy more than you need.

*For those seeking nutritional counseling,*¬†[*weight loss insurance*](https://try.getzealthy.com/weight-loss-insurance/)¬†*may cover consultations to help make informed choices.*

# Understanding Nutritional Information

Knowing how to interpret nutritional information can empower you to make healthier choices when ordering fast food.

# Reading Labels

* **Check the Calorie Count**: Knowing the calorie content of menu items can help you stay within your daily goals.
* **Macronutrient Breakdown**: Look for meals with a balanced amount of protein, carbohydrates, and fats.
* **Sodium Levels**: Many fast-food options are high in sodium. Aim for items with lower sodium levels if possible, as excess sodium can lead to water retention and elevated blood pressure.

# Use Apps and Online Tools

Many fast-food chains provide nutritional information online or through mobile apps.

* **Nutrition Apps**: Tools like MyFitnessPal or Lose It! can help you track your intake.
* **Restaurant Websites**: These often provide the most accurate and up-to-date information on their menu items.

# Planning Ahead for Success

Planning can help prevent impulsive decisions that may not align with your goals.

# Research Ahead of Time

Many fast-food chains publish their menus online, allowing you to decide on a healthy choice before you even get there.

* **Know Your Options**: Familiarize yourself with healthier menu items at your favorite fast-food spots.
* **Establish a Go-To Order**: Having a default order in mind can reduce the temptation to choose less healthy options.

# Time Your Meals

* **Avoid Skipping Meals**: Skipping meals often leads to excessive hunger and impulsive food choices.
* **Eat Before You‚Äôre Extremely Hungry**: When you‚Äôre not overly hungry, you‚Äôre more likely to make rational choices.

*Personalized coaching can be beneficial for meal planning, especially for those who regularly eat on the go. Consider*¬†[*weight loss coaching*](https://www.getzealthy.com/weight-loss-coaching)¬†*for tailored strategies.*

# The Importance of a Balanced Mindset

Approaching fast food with a balanced mindset can help prevent feelings of guilt or restriction.

# Moderation is Key

It‚Äôs okay to indulge occasionally as long as it fits into your overall calorie goals.

* **Avoid Deprivation**: Depriving yourself can lead to binge eating. Instead, allow yourself small treats in moderation.
* **Celebrate Small Wins**: Recognize the progress you‚Äôre making, whether that‚Äôs choosing water over soda or opting for grilled instead of fried foods.

# Practice Mindful Eating

Mindful eating can help you enjoy your food while making conscious choices.

* **Eat Slowly**: Slowing down can enhance satisfaction and prevent overeating.
* **Pay Attention to Hunger Cues**: Eat when you‚Äôre hungry and stop when you‚Äôre full, even if that means saving some of your meal for later.

*For those who struggle with emotional eating, guidance through*¬†[*weight loss coaching*](https://www.getzealthy.com/weight-loss-coaching)¬†*can help address behavioral challenges.*

# When to Consult a Professional

If you‚Äôre consistently making healthy choices but not seeing results, it may be time to consult with a nutritionist or healthcare provider.

# Registered Dietitians

Dietitians can provide personalized meal plans based on your unique needs and goals, ensuring that you‚Äôre meeting all nutritional requirements even when including fast food.

# Medical Options

For some individuals, supervised interventions may be helpful.

* **Metabolic Testing**: This testing can provide insights into your resting metabolic rate and help set accurate calorie targets.

1mxbvi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RVLiving/comments/1mxbvi9/from_burnout_to_bliss_my_first_14_weeks_living/,From Burnout to Bliss: My First 14 Weeks Living Full-Time in an RV,"Just over three months ago, I was completely burned out. I was working a job that drained me, living in a city that no longer felt like home, and spending most of my days indoors under harsh lights, staring at a screen. I felt stuck. Everything I did felt like going through the motions.

Then one night, while scrolling on my phone like I always do, I came across a random video of someone living full-time in their RV. At first, I just thought, Wow, must be nice. But something about it stayed with me. I kept watching, reading, digging into forums including this one,, and suddenly the idea didn‚Äôt feel so impossible. I didn‚Äôt even own an RV yet. I‚Äôd never driven anything bigger than a regular car. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized I needed to at least try.

So I took the leap. I bought a modest 22‚Äô Class C that needed a little love, learned the basics, sold or donated almost everything I owned, and hit the road.

I‚Äôm 14 weeks in now, and I‚Äôve had moments that honestly feel like scenes from a movie. I‚Äôve woken up to birdsong in the mountains, brewed coffee while watching the fog roll in over a lake, and fallen asleep to absolute silence in the desert. I‚Äôve had some small victories too, like finally learning how to dump the black tank without gagging took a few tries, not gonna lie, or figuring out how to fix a stubborn water pump with just YouTube and patience.

It hasn‚Äôt all been dreamy. I‚Äôve had a minor leak during a rainstorm that freaked me out, and there was a stretch where I felt really isolated and wondered if I made a huge mistake. But those tough days are part of the deal, and I‚Äôd take them any day over the emotional numbness I felt before.

This lifestyle has forced me to slow down, be more present, and actually feel again. I never thought a house on wheels would give me this much peace, but here I am.

I guess I‚Äôm posting this for anyone who‚Äôs where I was a few months ago, stuck, tired, and wondering if it‚Äôs too late to start over. It‚Äôs not. You don‚Äôt have to have it all figured out. You just need the courage to try.

Would love to hear if anyone else here made a big life pivot like this. What pushed you over the edge? And what did you learn in your first few months?",5,1755881635.0,RVLiving,2,0.86,False

Thought it was worth zooming out and looking at a few big wins from Muslim and Pakistani-origin founders that haven‚Äôt been discussed much here ‚Äî and how they‚Äôre shaping the landscape for all of us, especially engineers and operators from the region.

Some quick examples:

* **Replit** (Amjad Masad ‚Äî Jordanian-Pakistani heritage): 34M+ users, \~$144M ARR. Started while Amjad was in Jordan. YC backed them early. Now it‚Äôs used by students, devs, and startups daily.
* **Databricks** (Ali Ghodsi ‚Äî Iranian Muslim founder): Just hit \~$100B valuation. Massive player in the enterprise AI + data infrastructure space.
* **Applied Intuition** (Qasar Younis ‚Äî Pakistani origin): $15B valuation. Dual-use software for mobility and defense, built by an ex-YC partner.
* **Rocket Money** (Mokhtarzada brothers): Sold for $1.2B. Started off as a simple budgeting app, became a fintech category leader.
* **Chobani** (Hamdi Ulukaya): Now in coffee and beyond. Consumer brand that went from rural factory to household name.

A few thoughts on why this matters for Pakistani tech:

* Many of these founders started outside Silicon Valley, Amjad literally cold-emailed investors from Jordan.
* The inflection point usually came from one break: YC, a first customer, or one early believer.
* Most weren‚Äôt obvious at seed. They looked niche or ‚Äútoo risky‚Äù until traction forced people to pay attention.
* Almost none had serious early capital from within their own communities. By the time Sequoia or a16z came in, it was already de-risked.

So what‚Äôs the takeaway for us?

1. **Pakistani talent is already in the room.** Many of these wins have desi engineers, PMs, and ops leads behind the scenes.
2. **Founders from the region are on deck.** The next big one could be in Karachi, Lahore, or remote from anywhere.
3. **Global capital isn‚Äôt early.** The earlier we back our own talent, the more upside we capture ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs mentorship, users, open-source contributions, or actual capital.
4. **Distribution is catching up.** Pakistani consumer brands (food, fashion, SaaS) are scaling cross-border and need real tech: logistics, infra, payments, analytics, etc.",2,1755881240.0,PakistaniTech,0,1.0,False

¬† Sometimes you have to stand alone, just to make sure you still can. ‚Äì Unknown  
  
¬† Fable  
  
¬† Two months. I haven‚Äôt seen or heard from him in two freaking months. I mean, who does that to a person? Who spends the most intense week of their life with another human being and shares their most intimate thoughts, their craziest, darkest secrets, has sex with a person‚Äîand we‚Äôre talking amazing, earth-shattering sex‚Äîleaves them a note that says I love you and then bails? I‚Äôll tell you who.  
  
¬† Drew I‚Äôm going to kick him in the balls next time I see him Callahan.  
  
¬† I‚Äôve moved on. Well, I tell myself that. But time doesn‚Äôt stop just because my heart does, so I take care of my responsibilities. I‚Äôve stretched the three thousand dollars I earned for my one week of pretending to be the jerk wad‚Äôs girlfriend pretty well. I still have some money left in my savings account. I bought my brother Owen some cool Christmas gifts. I got my mom something for Christmas too.  
  
¬† She didn‚Äôt buy either of us anything. Not one thing. Owen made me a shallow bowl he created in his ceramics class at school. He was so proud to give it to me. A little embarrassed too, especially when I gushed over it. The kid wrapped it in bright Christmas paper and everything. I was blown away that he took the time to actually create something for me. I keep that bowl on my dresser and leave my earrings in it.  
  
¬† At least someone gives a crap about me, you know?  
  
¬† He didn‚Äôt give Mom anything. Which‚Äîshallow witch that I am‚Äîpleased me to no end.  
  
¬† January is supposedly a time of healing. New year, new goals, resolutions, whatever you want to call them, where a person should be hopeful with all that unchartered territory spread out before them. I tried my best to be positive when the New Year came, but I cried. That clock struck twelve and I was all by myself, tears running down my face as I watched the ball drop on TV. Pitiful, lonely girl sobbing into her sweatshirt, missing the boy she loves.  
  
¬† Most of the month is gone and that‚Äôs fine. But the realization hit me last night. Instead of dreading every single day that comes my way, I need to savor it. I need to figure out what I‚Äôm going to do with my life and then actually do it. I‚Äôd leave if I could, but I can‚Äôt ditch Owen. Without me, I have no idea what would happen to him and I can‚Äôt risk it.  
  
¬† So I stay. I vow to make the best of this life I have. I‚Äôm tired of living in misery.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm tired of feeling sorry for myself. I‚Äôm tired of wanting to shake my mom and make her see that she has children she should give two shits about. Oh, and that she also needs to find a job. Sleeping all day and partying all night with Larry the Loser isn‚Äôt the way to deal.  
  
¬† And I‚Äôm tired of mourning the loss of a beautiful, fucked-up man who haunts my thoughts everywhere I go.  
  
¬† Yeah, I‚Äôm most sick of that.  
  
¬† Pushing all mopey thoughts out of my head, I go to the booth where a customer‚Äôs waiting for me to take his order. He came in a few minutes ago, a blur of a tall man who moved quickly, dressed too nicely for a Thursday midafternoon jaunt to La Salles. The bar is hopping at night, full of college kids drinking themselves into oblivion. But during the day? Mostly bum losers who have nowhere else to go and the occasional person coming in for lunch. The burgers are decent so they‚Äôre a draw.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat can I get you?‚Äù I ask once I stop in front of the table, my head bent as I dig out my order pad.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYour attention maybe?‚Äù  
  
¬† His question‚Äîspoken in a velvety deep voice‚Äîmakes me glance up from my notepad.  
  
¬† Into the bluest eyes I‚Äôve ever seen. Bluer than Drew‚Äôs, if that‚Äôs possible.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúUm, sorry.‚Äù I offer him a tentative smile. He instantly makes me nervous. He is waaaay too good-looking. Like beyond gorgeous, with dark blond hair that falls over his forehead, and classic bone structure. Strong jaw, sharp cheekbones, straight nose‚Äîhe could‚Äôve walked right off a billboard. ‚ÄúAre you ready to order?‚Äù  
  
¬† He smil  
es, revealing even white teeth, and I clamp my lips shut to prevent them from falling open. I didn‚Äôt know men could be this attractive. I mean, Drew is gorgeous, I can admit that even though I‚Äôm furious at him. But this guy‚Ä¶he puts all other men to shame. His face is too damn perfect.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take a Pale Ale.‚Äù He flicks his chin at the tattered menu lying on the table in front of him. ‚ÄúAnything from the appetizer menu you can recommend?‚Äù  
  
¬† He must be joking. Beyond the burgers, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend any food La Salle‚Äôs serves to this ideal male specimen. Heaven forbid it might taint him. ‚ÄúWhat are you in the mood for?‚Äù I ask, my voice weak.  
  
¬† Lifting a brow, he picks up the menu and glances it over, his gaze meeting mine. ‚ÄúNachos?‚Äù  
  
¬† I shake my head. ‚ÄúThe beef is rarely cooked all the way.‚Äù More like it comes out with a pink tinge. So gross.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúPotato skins?‚Äù He winces.  
  
¬† I wince back. ‚ÄúSo nineties, don‚Äôt you think?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHow about the buffalo wings?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIf you want to set your mouth on permanent fire. Listen.‚Äù I glance around, making sure no one‚Äîas in my boss‚Äîis nearby. ‚ÄúIf you want something to eat, I suggest the caf√© down the street. They have great sandwiches.‚Äù  
  
¬† He laughs and shakes his head. The rich, vibrant sound washes over me, warming my skin, followed quickly by a huge dose of wariness. I don‚Äôt react like this to guys. The only other one who could earn this sort of reaction out of me is Drew. And he‚Äôs not around‚Ä¶so why am I still so hung up on him?  
  
¬† Maybe because you‚Äôre still in love with him, like some sort of idiot?  
  
¬† I shove the nagging little voice that pops up at the most inopportune times into the back of my brain.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI like your honesty,‚Äù the man says, his cool blue gaze raking over me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just take the beer, then.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSmart decision.‚Äù I nod. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be right back.‚Äù  
  
¬† I head toward the back and slip behind the bar, grabbing a bottle of Pale Ale, glancing up to catch the guy staring at me. And he doesn‚Äôt look away either, which makes me feel uncomfortable. He‚Äôs not watching me like a pervert, just very‚Ä¶observant.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs unnerving.  
  
¬† A trickle of anger flickers through me. Do I wear an invisible sign around my neck? One that says Hey, I‚Äôm Easy? Because I‚Äôm not. Yeah, I made a few mistakes, looking for attention in the wrong places, but it‚Äôs not like I dress with my tits or ass hanging out. I don‚Äôt put any sort of purposeful swing to my hips nor do I thrust my chest out like I see plenty of girls do.  
  
¬† So why does every guy I encounter seem to blatantly check me out like I‚Äôm a piece of meat?  
  
¬† Deciding I‚Äôve had enough of his crap, I stride toward his table and set the beer in front of him with a loud clunk. I‚Äôm about to walk away without saying a word‚Äîscrew the tip‚Äîwhen he asks, ‚ÄúSo what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù  
  
¬† I glance over my shoulder. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it matter to you?‚Äù Oh, I‚Äôm such a bitch. I could really piss this guy off and get myself fired. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me.  
  
¬† Yet again, I‚Äôm as bad as my mom. She sabotaged her job with her drinking and awful attitude. At least I only have the bad attitude.  
  
¬† If I could kick my own ass, I would be doing so right now.  
  
¬† He smiles and shrugs, like my smart-ass remark doesn‚Äôt faze him. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm curious.‚Äù  
  
¬† Turning fully, I face him, studying him as much as he studies me. His long fingers are wrapped around the neck of the beer bottle, his other arm resting on the scarred and scratched table. His entire manner is relaxed, easy, and my defenses slowly lower.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Fable,‚Äù I admit, bracing for the reaction. I‚Äôve heard endless jokes and rude remarks about my name since I can remember.  
  
¬† But he doesn‚Äôt give me a hard time. His expression remains neutral. ‚ÄúNice to meet you, Fable. I‚Äôm Colin.‚Äù  
  
¬† I nod, not knowing what else to say. He both puts me at ease and shakes me up, which leaves me confused. And he definitely doesn‚Äôt fit in at this bar. He‚Äôs dressed too nice, has an air of authority about him that borders on entitlement, as if he‚Äôs above it all, and he probably is. He reeks of class and money.  
  
¬† But he‚Äôs not acting like an ass and he should, I‚Äôve been so rude to him. He brings the beer bottle to his lips, taking a drink, and I watch unabashedly. He‚Äôs handsome. He‚Äôs arrogant. And he‚Äôs trouble.  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt want anything to do with him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo, Fable,‚Äù he says once he‚Äôs downed half his beer. ‚ÄúCan I ask you a question?‚Äù  
  
¬† Shuffling my feet, I glance around the bar. No one‚Äôs paying us any attention. I could probably stand here and talk to Colin the mysterious customer for fifteen minutes and no one would protest. ‚ÄúSure.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy is a woman like you working in a shit bar like this?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhy is a guy like you ordering a beer in a shit bar like this?‚Äù I retort, momentarily insulted. But then I realize‚Ä¶he‚Äôs complimenting me. And he referred to me as a woman. No one ever does that. I don‚Äôt do that.  
  
¬† He tips his beer at me, as if offering a toast. ‚ÄúTouch√©. Would you be surprised if I said I came in here looking for you?‚Äù  
  
¬† Surprised? More like creeped out. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know you. How could you be looking for me?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI should rephrase that. I came here hoping I would find someone I could steal away.‚Äù At my raised eyebrows, he laughs. ‚ÄúI own a new restaurant in town. The District. Have you heard of it?‚Äù  
  
¬† I had. Some new fancy place that caters to the rich college kids, the ones with an endless supply of money they can use to eat, drink and party. So not my scene. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHave you been there?‚Äù  
  
¬† I slowly shake my head. ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù  
  
¬† Leaning back against the seat, he studies me, his lids heavy as he does a slow perusal of‚Ä¶me. Now he‚Äôs totally checking me out and I can feel my cheeks burn with embarrassment. The guy is sort of a jackass.  
  
¬† I‚Äôve always had a slight thing for jackasses.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúCome with me to the restaurant tonight. I‚Äôll show you around.‚Äù His mouth curves into not quite a smile and I‚Äôm tempted.  
  
¬† But I‚Äôve also sworn off men so I know this is a bad idea. ‚ÄúThanks, but I‚Äôm not interested.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to ask you out on a date, Fable,‚Äù he says, his voice low, his eyes glowing. I take a step back, glancing around. I need to get away from this guy. Fast. But then his words stop me in my tracks. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying to offer you a job.‚Äù  
  
¬† Drew  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs talk about Fable.‚Äù  
  
¬† I tense up but nod. I try my best to appear neutral, like our new topic of discussion doesn‚Äôt bother me. ‚ÄúWhat do you want to know?‚Äù  
  
¬† My shrink watches me, her careful gaze steady. ‚ÄúIt still bothers you to hear her name.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt,‚Äù I lie. I try my best to appear nonchalant, but my insides are churning. I both dread and savor hearing Fable‚Äôs name. I want to see her. I need to see her.  
  
¬† I can‚Äôt make myself go to her. And she‚Äôs clearly given up on me. I deserve her giving up. I gave up on her first, didn‚Äôt I?  
  
¬† More like you gave up on yourself.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to lie to me, Drew. It‚Äôs okay if it‚Äôs still difficult.‚Äù Dr. Sheila Harris pauses, tapping her index finger against her chin. ‚ÄúHave you considered trying to see her?‚Äù  
  
¬† I shake my head. I consider it every day, every minute of my life, but my considerations are useless. ‚ÄúShe hates me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know that.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôd hate me for what I did if I were her. I shut down and shut her out, like I always do. She begged me again and again not to do it. That she‚Äôd be there for me no matter what.‚Äù Yet I left her. With only a stupid note that took me way too long to write, filled with a secret message that my smart, beautiful girl figured out right away.  
  
¬† But she‚Äôs not my girl. I can‚Äôt lay claim to her. I ignored her. And now‚Ä¶  
  
¬† I‚Äôve lost her.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo why did you shut her out? You‚Äôve never told me, you know.‚Äù  
  
¬† My psychologist loves to ask the tough questions, but tha  
t‚Äôs her job. I still hate answering them. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only way I know how to cope,‚Äù I admit. The truth slaps me in the face on a daily basis. I always run.  
  
¬† It‚Äôs so much easier.  
  
¬† I sought Dr. Harris out myself. No one else pushed me to do it. After we came back from Carmel, after I ditched Fable and left her that bullshit note, I withdrew into myself worse than ever. I fucked up my game play. I fucked up my grades. Winter break came and I ran away. I literally ran away to some crazy cabin in the middle of the woods I rented from some nice old couple in Lake Tahoe.  
  
¬† My plan? Hibernate like a bear. Turn off my phone, hole up by myself and figure my shit out. I didn‚Äôt anticipate how hard it would be, though, being alone with my thoughts. My memories, both the good and the bad, haunted me. I thought of the bombshell my stepmom Adele dropped on me. I thought about my dad and how much the truth‚Äîif it really is the truth‚Äîwould affect him. I thought about my little sister Vanessa and how she died. How she might not be my little sister after all‚Ä¶  
  
¬† More than anything, I thought of Fable. How mad she‚Äôd been when I showed up on her doorstep, but she let me in anyway. The way I touched her, how she touched me, the way she always seemed to break down my barriers and see the real me. I let her in. I wanted to let her in.  
  
¬† And then I left her. With a note that was rendered pointless because she tried her damnedest to rescue me and I wouldn‚Äôt let her. She sent me exactly two texts. The second one surprised me because I knew she was stubborn and I figured she‚Äôd give up after I didn‚Äôt answer the first one.  
  
¬† How could I answer it, though? She said all the right things. And I would‚Äôve said all the wrong things. So it‚Äôs better to say nothing at all.  
  
¬† She also left me one voice mail. I still have it. Sometimes, when I‚Äôm feeling really fucked up, I play it. Listen to her soft, tearful voice, those unbelievable words she says to me. By the time the message is finished, my heart literally hurts.

It‚Äôs torture listening to it yet I can‚Äôt make myself delete that message either. Just knowing it‚Äôs there, that for one last minute she actually cared, is better than deleting those words and her voice, and pretending she doesn‚Äôt exist.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hoping to help you with that. Your coping mechanisms,‚Äù Dr. Harris says, drawing me out of my thoughts. ‚ÄúI know how much she means to you. Fable. And I‚Äôm hoping that eventually, you‚Äôll go to her and tell her you‚Äôre sorry.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWhat if I‚Äôm not sorry?‚Äù I toss the words out, but they‚Äôre meaningless. I‚Äôm so sorry I can‚Äôt begin to explain how much of a screwup I am.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThen that‚Äôs another issue we‚Äôll have to deal with,‚Äù she says gently.  
  
¬† It goes on like this for another fifteen minutes and then I finally make my escape, walking out into the cold, clear winter afternoon. The sun is warm on my skin despite the temperature and I start down the sidewalk, heading for where I parked my truck. Harris‚Äôs office is downtown, in a nondescript building, and I hope like hell I don‚Äôt see anyone I know. The college campus is only a few blocks away and students hang out at the little stores, caf√©s and coffee shops that line the street.  
  
¬† Not like I have many friends, but hell. Everyone likes to think they know me. No one really does. With the exception of one person.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHey, Callahan, wait up!‚Äù  
  
¬† Pausing, I glance over my shoulder to see one of my teammates running toward me, a big grin on his goofy face. Jace Hendrix is a pain in the ass but generally a good guy. He‚Äôs never done me wrong, not that any of them ever really have. ‚ÄúHey.‚Äù I offer him a wave and shove my hands into my jacket pockets, waiting until he stops just in front of me.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúLong time, no see,‚Äù Jace says. ‚ÄúYou sort of disappeared after that last failure of a game.‚Äù  
  
¬† I wince. That last failure of a game had been all my fault. ‚ÄúI was feeling sort of fucked up over that,‚Äù I confess.  
  
¬† Hell, I can‚Äôt believe I just admitted to my failures, but Jace doesn‚Äôt seem bothered. ‚ÄúYeah, you and everyone else, man. Listen, what are you doing this weekend?‚Äù  
  
¬† The way Jace brushes off my statement‚Äîhell, the way he agrees with it‚Äîblows me away. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Logan‚Äôs birthday. We‚Äôre doing it up right at the new restaurant that just opened a few blocks over. Have you heard of it?‚Äù Jace looks excited, he‚Äôs literally bouncing on his feet and I wonder what the hell is up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúVaguely.‚Äù I shrug. Like I care. The last thing I want is to be social.  
  
¬† But then Dr. Harris‚Äôs words ring through my head. How she wants me to reach out. And act like a real person.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúParty‚Äôs going to be there. Got a private room and everything. I haven‚Äôt been there yet, but I hear all the waitresses are gorgeous, the drinks are delicious and loaded with alcohol and Logan‚Äôs parents arranged for a private room. Rumor has it strippers might‚Äôve been hired out for this momentous event. Logan‚Äôs turning twenty-one, so we want to get him all sorts of fucked up.‚Äù Jace waggles his eyebrows.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSounds great,‚Äù I lie. It sounds like torture. But I need to go. At the very least, make a quick appearance and then jam. I can report back to my shrink what I did. She can give me a gold star for making an effort.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll go?‚Äù Jace looks shocked and I know why. I rarely do anything with the guys and especially the last few months, since I‚Äôve been like a ghost.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be there.‚Äù I nod, unsure how I‚Äôm going to work up the energy to make an appearance, but I‚Äôve got to do this.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYeah? Awesome! I can‚Äôt wait to tell the guys. We‚Äôve missed you. Haven‚Äôt seen you for a while and we all know how those last few games were tough on you. They were tough on all of us.‚Äù Jace‚Äôs expression is solemn and for a minute I wonder if he‚Äôs playing my ass.  
  
¬† But then I realize he‚Äôs sincere. Funny how I took full responsibility for those losses when I bet every single one of these guys on my team probably did the same thing.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúTell the guys I can‚Äôt wait to see them.‚Äù The words fall easily from my lips because they‚Äôre the truth. I need to stop wallowing in my own misery. I need to stop worrying about my past, worrying about my dad and my bitch of a stepmom and the little girl who died because I was too busy fighting with her mom and telling her to keep her goddamn hands to herself.  
  
¬† That‚Äôs the one regret I have, that I never fully explained to Fable what happened that day. I know she assumes I was off screwing around with Adele. I would think the same. But that was the day I told her never again. Whatever she was going to try, I wasn‚Äôt interested. It was over. That was the day I became liberated.  
  
¬† And also the day I became a prisoner to my own guilt.  
  
¬† Forever.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSee ya around, Drew.‚Äù Jace waves and turns, whistling as he walks away from me. I remain rooted to the spot, watching him leave until he‚Äôs a speck of nothing in the distance, wishing like crazy I could be that carefree. That my biggest concerns were my grades, what girl I could get my hands on next, and how excited I was for the big party coming up in a few days.  
  
¬† Maybe, just maybe I could lose myself in the mundane for a bit. Pretend that nothing else matters but friends and school and parties. Doc says I can‚Äôt move forward until I face the past.  
  
¬† But what the fuck does she know?  
  
¬† Chapter Two  
  
¬† She‚Äôs all broken inside but no one will ever notice. ‚Äì Unknown  
  
¬† Fable  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo.‚Äù Owen slurps on the giant thirty-two-ounce soda I bought him at the gas station, where we stopped to fill up my mom‚Äôs crap car on the way home. ‚ÄúCan I eat for free at this joint you‚Äôre working at?‚Äù  
  
¬† I shake my head. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too classy. Kids aren‚Äôt really welcome.‚Äù The understatement of the year. The restaurant is definitely not kid friendly. In fact, I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs not really Fable friendly either but I‚Äôm willing to give it a chance. Colin claims I can make a ton of money in tips, though I‚Äôm not sure if I believe him.  
  
¬† My thoughts drift to Colin. He owns the restaurant‚Ä¶because his rich daddy gave it to him to play with. That much I gleaned out of him when he first brought me there. He‚Äôs nice. He‚Äôs attractive. He‚Äôs charming.  
  
¬† Beyond chatting with him like he‚Äôs my boss and I‚Äôm his employee, I‚Äôm avoiding him as much as possible. I took him up on his job offer, though it sounds almost too good to be true.  
  
¬† Funny thing is, I haven‚Äôt quite given notice at La Salle‚Äôs yet. Holding on to that job until I know for sure the new job is going to work out is the only way to keep the money consistently flowing in.  
  
¬† And as always, my inflow of money is the most important thing. Our mom isn‚Äôt doing anything to ensure that‚Äôs happening.  
  
¬† Owen puffs up his chest, his expression indignant. ‚ÄúAre you kidding me? I‚Äôm not a kid. I‚Äôm fucking fourteen!‚Äù  
  
¬† I slap his arm and he yelps. ‚ÄúLanguage,‚Äù I warn because, oh my God, he needs to watch that mouth of his. And since when did the legal adult age get bumped back four years? In his dreams.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSeriously, Fabes, you can‚Äôt even sneak me in?‚Äù Owen shakes his head, his irritation clear. ‚ÄúI hear the chicks who hang out there are bangin‚Äô.‚Äù  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt need to hear my little brother talking about bangin‚Äô chicks and whatever else. Bad enough I found the baggy of weed in his jeans pocket when I did laundry a few days ago. I showed it to my mom and she shrugged, then demanded I hand the bag over.  
  
¬† She proceeded to open it and took a deep sniff, proclaiming the weed high-quality stuff. I know she took it with her over to Larry‚Äôs house later and they probably got high as hell. I still can‚Äôt believe it. How did I become so normal and stable when my mom is such a‚Ä¶child?  
  
¬† You had no choice.  
  
¬† Wasn‚Äôt that the damn truth?  
  
¬† ‚ÄúListen, the dinners they serve are like fifty bucks a plate. It‚Äôs for couples and stuff. And there‚Äôs a bar. After ten, the place is completely shut down to those under twenty-one,‚Äù I explain. It‚Äôs truly the most beautiful, elegant restaurant I‚Äôve ever seen. Let alone worked at. It‚Äôs organized, efficient, everything and everyone  
has a place. The staff isn‚Äôt very friendly, though. More like snobby. I‚Äôm sure they sneer at me behind my back, the white-trash townie who‚Äôs come to work among their elitist ranks.  
  
¬† Whatever. All I care about is the tips. And the fact that Colin believes in me. It‚Äôs been a long time since someone believed in me. I thought Drew did but the longer he‚Äôs absent from my life, the more it proves to me that was all fake. We just got a little too caught up.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt even bring me any leftovers, huh?‚Äù Owen‚Äôs question snaps me out of my thoughts and I glance at him, see the smirk on his face.  
  
¬† He‚Äôs getting more and more good-looking as time passes. I have no idea if he has a girlfriend or not, but I really hope he puts that sort of thing off for a least a little while longer. Relationships are nothing but trouble.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so gross.‚Äù I roll my eyes. I used to bring him home burgers from La Salle‚Äôs. Which goes to show I completely spoiled him.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWell, Mom sure as hell isn‚Äôt going to feed me. Sorry,‚Äù he blurts when he catches my evil eye over his curse. ‚ÄúAnd I feel like a jerk with how much I hang out at Wade‚Äôs house. His mom has to be getting sick of me.‚Äù  
  
¬† Guilt swamps me. I need this job. I need both of my jobs and that means I can‚Äôt be there for Owen. Making him dinners, keeping on top of his homework, forcing him to clean that dump of a room. The apartment has three bedrooms, a rarity but in demand in a college town, and the rent is getting more expensive. Considering my mom is never here and it‚Äôs usually just Owen and me, I‚Äôm considering looking for another apartment. For just the two of us and without my mom included.  
  
¬† This little tidbit will piss her off when I tell her. It doesn‚Äôt matter that she spends the majority of her time with Larry. It doesn‚Äôt matter that she‚Äôs never here and doesn‚Äôt have a job and can‚Äôt afford the rent. She‚Äôll still be angry and take it personally, like Owen and I are forcing her out.  
  
¬† I kind of am. I don‚Äôt want her here anymore. She‚Äôs not a good influence, Owen‚Äôs uncomfortable around her and so am I. I‚Äôm done.  
  
¬† But for whatever reason, I‚Äôm scared to confront her. I don‚Äôt want to deal with a bunch of unnecessary drama. And that‚Äôs what my mom is. Complete and total drama.  
  
¬† My cell beeps, indicating I have a text, and I check it, see that it‚Äôs from my new boss. Unease slips down my spine as I read the message.  
  
¬† What are you doing?  
  
¬† I type in the good employee response.  
  
¬† Getting ready for work.  
  
¬† Hey, it‚Äôs the truth.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm in the neighborhood. Let me pick you up and take you there.  
  
¬† I stare at his message for too long, ignoring Owen as he starts griping about what he‚Äôs going to have to fix himself for dinner. What the hell could Colin want? Why would he be in my shit hole of a neighborhood? It makes no sense. Unless he purposely came looking for me‚Ä¶  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt have to be at work for almost an hour, I reply.  
  
¬† I‚Äôll pay you for the extra time. Come on.  
  
¬† Sighing, I type in my answer: Give me five minutes.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI gotta go,‚Äù I tell Owen as I head for my bedroom. I haven‚Äôt changed into my work uniform, if you can call it that. All the waitresses have to wear the most outrageous dresses I‚Äôve ever seen. There are at least four different dresses and they‚Äôre sexy as all get-out, with our boobs hanging out or they fit us skintight. I get the sex appeal thing. We don‚Äôt look slutty or anything, but if I bend over wrong, I‚Äôm giving everyone a flash of my ass. Boy-short undies are the name of the game for those dresses.  
  
¬† I‚Äôm grabbing my dress off the hanger when I catch Owen lurking in my doorway. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù I ask him.  
  
¬† He shrugs. ‚ÄúWhat do you think of me getting a tattoo?‚Äù  
  
¬† My head spins for a moment. Oh my God, where does he come up with this stuff? ‚ÄúFirst, you‚Äôre only fourteen, so legally you can‚Äôt get one. Second, you‚Äôre only fourteen. What could you possibly want to have tattooed forever on your body?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI dunno.‚Äù He shrugs again. ‚ÄúI thought it might be cool. I mean you just got one so why can‚Äôt I?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúMaybe because I‚Äôm an adult and you‚Äôre not?‚Äù A few weeks before Christmas, when I still believed Drew and I had a chance, I got one. The stupidest tattoo you could ever imagine. I thought by doing it, by having a piece of him, no matter how small, permanently etched into my skin, I could somehow call him back to me.  
  
¬† Didn‚Äôt work. And now I‚Äôm stuck. Thank God, it‚Äôs small. I could probably have it filled in if I wanted to.  
  
¬† Right now, I don‚Äôt want to.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo you put some guy‚Äôs initials on your body and it‚Äôs cool but I can‚Äôt get an artistic tat of a dragon on my back or whatever? So unfair.‚Äù He shakes his head, his dirty blond hair getting in his eyes, and I want to smack him.  
  
¬† And I also want to draw him into my arms and ask where did the sweet, simple kid of not even a year ago run away to? Because he sure as hell isn‚Äôt around here anymore.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs different.‚Äù I turn away from him and yank the dress off the hanger, clutching it in my hand. ‚ÄúI need to change so you need to go.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWho‚Äôs the guy, anyway? You never did tell me.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs no one.‚Äù The words are heavy as they fall from my lips. He was definitely someone. He was my everything for the briefest, most intense moment of my life.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not no one. He broke your heart.‚Äù Venom fills Owen‚Äôs voice. ‚ÄúI ever find out who he is, I‚Äôll kick his ass.‚Äù  
  
¬† I smile because I can‚Äôt help it. His defense of me is‚Ä¶awesome. We‚Äôre a team, Owen and I. We‚Äôre all each other‚Äôs got.  
  
¬† \* \* \* \*  
  
¬† I slip outside of my apartment because I so don‚Äôt want Colin knocking on my door and meeting Owen. Or worse, seeing the inside of our dingy apartment. Wherever Colin lives, I bet it‚Äôs amazing. If his house is half as gorgeous as his restaurant, then it has to be amazing.  
  
¬† The second I step off the stairs, he‚Äôs there in a sleek black Mercedes, the engine purring, the car so new it doesn‚Äôt have plates yet. I take a step back when he opens the door and climbs out of the car, a blond god with a devastating smile and twinkling blue eyes.  
  
¬† He rounds the car, opening the passenger side door for me with a flourish. ‚ÄúYour carriage awaits.‚Äù  
  
¬† I hesitate. Is this a mistake, climbing into his car with him? I‚Äôm not afraid of Colin yet I am afraid of the situation I might be putting myself in. He‚Äôs a flirt but I notice he flirts with pretty much everyone who works for him‚Äîand the customers. He never crosses a line, he‚Äôs always polite and knows when to step back if need be.  
  
¬† But am I giving him mixed signals by allowing him to pick me up for work? He just happens to be near my apartment so he can swing by and get me? I don‚Äôt believe it.  
  
¬† Not for a second.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúDid you come here specifically to pick me up?‚Äù I ask him the minute he climbs back into the car and slams the door.  
  
¬† He turns to look at me, our faces awfully close. The car is nice but small and the setting is rather intimate. He smells like expensive cologne and leather and I wonder for a quick minute if I could actually feel something for this guy.  
  
¬† I realize just as quickly that I can‚Äôt. My heart is still tied up in knots over someone else. Someone unreal.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre pretty straightforward, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Colin asks, his eyes gleaming in the dim interior.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs better than doling out a bunch of lies, right?‚Äù I arch a brow.  
  
¬† Laughing, he shakes his head as he puts the car into gear. ‚ÄúRight. I really was in the neighborhood, Fable. And I remembered you lived around here so that‚Äôs why I texted you. I know you don‚Äôt always have access to a car.‚Äù  
  
¬† I‚Äôve worked at his restaurant for three shifts and he already knows all this information about me. Is that a sign of a good boss or a creeper? ‚ÄúI had my mom‚Äôs car today.‚Äù  
  
¬† He pulls out of the parking lot and onto the road, his hand draped casually over the steering wheel, his other arm resting on the center console. There‚Äôs an easiness to him. No, make that effortlessness. He makes everything appear like he coul  
d get whatever he wants out of life and he deserves every bit of it too.  
  
¬† I envy him that. It‚Äôs a confidence I could never hope for.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúWant me to take you back so you can drive it?‚Äù There‚Äôs amusement lacing his deep voice. He must think I‚Äôm a joke.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù I sigh. This is stupid. What are we doing? ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt have a ride home, though.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give you a ride.‚Äù  
  
¬† I don‚Äôt bother answering him.  
  
¬† I remain quiet, picking at my cuticles as he drives, both of us silent. My hands are dry, my cuticles bad and I think of the other girls I work with who have perfect manicures and pedicures and I literally look like the still slightly ragged Cinderella who‚Äôs been finally pulled out of the basement and set to work among the glittering, beautiful princesses. I might shine but rub me a little bit and the tarnish comes through relatively easy.  
  
¬† I feel‚Ä¶less than when I‚Äôm at my new job. And I don‚Äôt like that.  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNasty habit,‚Äù Colin says, breaking the thickening silence. ‚ÄúYou should go get your nails done.‚Äù  
  
¬† Okay, that irritates the crap out of me. His assumptions are rude. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pay for it.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúHell, no,‚Äù I practically snarl. His offer irritates me more.  
  
¬† Colin ignores me. ‚ÄúAnd while you‚Äôre at it, you should go see a hairstylist. I‚Äôll pay for that too. There‚Äôs too much bleach in your hair and it looks damaged.‚Äù  
  
¬† The nerve. This guy is such an asshole. Why did I agree to work for him again? Oh yeah, the money. Greediness is going to get the best of me, I just know it. It‚Äôs led to two really stupid decisions already. ‚ÄúWho are you? The fashion police?‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúNo, but I‚Äôm your boss and at The District we have certain criteria that we need to maintain.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúSo why did you hire me? You knew what you were getting.‚Äù  
  
¬† ‚ÄúI saw your potential,‚Äù he said softly. ‚ÄúDo you, Fable? Do you see it?‚Äù  
  
¬† I couldn‚Äôt answer him. Because the truth wasn‚Äôt what he wanted to hear.

The sign was chipped, the floorboards creaked, and the baristas had perfected that mix of sarcasm and latte art that made people tip out of guilt.

Emma and Daniel had been coming there since sophomore year of college. She was twenty-six now, curls she couldn‚Äôt tame even if she tried, eyeliner that winged sharp enough to cut glass, and a laugh that carried across a room. Emma worked in social media marketing, which basically meant she convinced companies to tweet like teenagers. Daniel, twenty-seven, wrote code for a start-up and lived half his life in hoodies, though he somehow made ‚Äúnerdy tall guy‚Äù look good.

They‚Äôd been best friends for seven years. Through bad roommates, worse relationships, job hunts, and too many late-night tacos. Emma was the chaos, Daniel was the calm. Everyone knew it worked.

But one Friday, something shifted. It wasn‚Äôt dramatic. No rainstorm, no music swelling. Emma just leaned across the table, brushed a crumb off Daniel‚Äôs mouth, and he froze. Not in a movie way, just in that ‚Äúholy crap, did that mean something?‚Äù way.

Zoe noticed first. She was Emma‚Äôs roommate, twenty-four, an unstoppable machine of oversized blazers, iced coffees, and loud opinions. She muttered ‚Äúfinally‚Äù into her cold brew like she‚Äôd been waiting years for this exact scene.

Marcus, on the other hand, was not thrilled. He was their other friend, a personal trainer who looked like he lived in the gym but actually had a big soft heart. He‚Äôd been Emma‚Äôs go-to during every heartbreak since college. When Zoe told him she thought Emma and Daniel were falling for each other, he shook his head. ‚ÄúNah. That‚Äôs a disaster waiting to happen. They‚Äôve got too much history. It‚Äôll ruin everything.‚Äù

But Emma wasn‚Äôt asking.

Over the next few weeks, things felt‚Ä¶ different. Pauses got longer. Jokes landed heavier. Daniel told Marcus he was scared of wrecking the only friendship that had lasted this long. Emma told Zoe she couldn‚Äôt stop replaying Daniel‚Äôs smile in her head when she was trying to sleep. Zoe nearly burst from excitement. Marcus just muttered about cleaning up messes that hadn‚Äôt even happened yet.

Then one Thursday night, they ended up closing the shop with the barista who knew them too well. She tossed them the spare key with a grin. ‚ÄúLock up. Don‚Äôt burn the place down.‚Äù

Emma sat on the counter, swinging her legs. Daniel leaned against the door, arms crossed like he was keeping himself from saying something stupid.

‚ÄúYou know this is dangerous, right?‚Äù he said finally. ‚ÄúUs.‚Äù

Emma raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúSo is texting your ex after two beers. At least we already like each other.‚Äù

He laughed, nervous but real. And then he kissed her. No fireworks, no soundtrack. Just seven years of knowing each other pressed into one moment.

When Zoe found out, she screamed so loud their neighbor banged on the wall. She popped open a bottle of champagne she‚Äôd been saving for no reason other than ‚ÄúEmma and Daniel were always going to happen.‚Äù

Marcus? He sighed into his protein shake like the weight of the world was on him. ‚ÄúIf he breaks your heart,‚Äù he said to Emma, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll break his face. Nicely.‚Äù

Emma only smiled. Because for the first time in a long time, things felt like they‚Äôd finally lined up. Risky, sure. But all the best stories start that way.",1,1755881112.0,shortstoryaday,0,0.67,False

I‚Äôm 25F living around the Islington/Kingsway area and I‚Äôm looking to make some new friends in Etobicoke. I recently got out of a relationship, and I really want to invest time and effort into creating long-lasting, meaningful friendships.

A little bit about me:

* I have a cat üêæ
* I love reading, writing, singing, karaoke, playing guitar, and taking dance lessons
* I‚Äôm into art, video games, and going for regular walks around the neighborhood
* I‚Äôm outgoing and into fitness (I‚Äôve got a GoodLife membership if anyone‚Äôs looking for a gym/accountability buddy!)
* Big fan of movies, plays, and jazz shows in the city
* I love concerts‚ÄîI‚Äôve seen Tyler the Creator, Blackpink, and Men I Trust, and I‚Äôve got plans to see Dijon, Mac DeMarco, and a few others this year

I don‚Äôt really have a preference in gender‚ÄîI just hope to connect with people who value putting in effort and intention when it comes to friendship. I don‚Äôt drive, so I won‚Äôt be able to drive us anywhere, but I‚Äôm totally fine with TTC üöá

Ideally, I‚Äôd love to set aside a consistent time/day to hang out‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs grabbing coffee, exploring the area, hitting the gym, or checking out an event in the city.

If this sounds like your vibe, feel free to reach out! If you do decide to message me, try to tell me a bit about yourself or mention what caught your eye. Thank you ‚ú®",5,1755881108.0,Etobicoke,3,0.73,False

The fact that they don't care about the order statuses on the display screens is!. I stood there waiting to pick up my coffee for 20 mins and saw it move from In progress fo ready. Now Im happy that I can pick it up and get tf out guess what, orders that are 'in progress' are being served except mine (and a few more that show they're ready ig). When asked, they reply  ""we don't follow the order that is displayed""  like what the fuck! Meanwhile, I also learnt that they don't serve water cups. Finally she got my coffee but there's a same one in her other hand which was given to a lady who's was still in progress and then I realized how they're operating- they recieve the order sequentially BUT  keep it aside and wait until they get similiar ones to save washing chores. Idk this is common but it is very frustrating coz I went late to my class not because there were too many orders but they were waiting for one more order of mocha cookie crumble.

My advice - dont go there if you're on a time crunch.

**Christopher Parr:**¬†Two rules set the tone for a flawless trip:

1. Book direct flights.
2. Travel carry-on only.

That eliminates half of the headaches right there.

Once I land, I stick to a¬†**first-hour ritual**:

* Get sunlight within 90 minutes‚Äîresets your clock better than coffee.
* Message the hotel concierge or app before landing; ask for shower/spa/club lounge access if the room‚Äôs not ready.
* Switch on eSIM before immigration‚Äîno scrambling for kiosks.
* ATM only for small-bill local currency, perfect for tips and taxis.
* Skip rental counters‚Äîpre-book Uber Black or trusted car services like Blacklane.

# 2) Best way to visit Disneyland in 2025?

**Christopher Parr:**¬†Think of it as a joyful heist.

* Go midweek (Tue/Wed) and arrive¬†**40 minutes before rope drop**.
* Stay on-property for¬†**early entry**¬†and a private park entrance.
* Buy Lightning Lane Multi Pass if time matters and leverage¬†**Single Rider**¬†lines.
* Mobile order meals to maximize park time.
* Take a midday break at your hotel pool before returning for fireworks.

Crowd levels shift constantly, but a well-planned reset makes the magic last.

# 3) What‚Äôs better for rewards in 2025‚Äîairline miles, hotel points, or flexible points?

**Christopher Parr:**¬†Flexible points win every time. Amex, Chase, and Capital One let you¬†**transfer to whichever partner has availability**, so you‚Äôre not locked in.

Stack like a pro:

* Max category multipliers (dining, airfare, hotels).
* Use airline/hotel shopping portals.
* Snap receipts with Fetch for bonus points.
* Wait for¬†**20‚Äì30% transfer promos**.

Optionality is the real reward.

¬†  
  
¬† ISN'T IT AMAZING HOW ONE seemingly innocent decision can change your entire life? For me, that decision came in the form of a grande mocha latte.  
  
¬† Allow me to explain.  
  
¬† The day began normally enough. Translation: I rolled out of bed thirty minutes late, rushed through a shower and hurriedly dressed in the standard black slacks and white button-up top every Utopia Caf¬®¬¶ employee is required to wear. Unlike the other employees, I left the top three buttons of my shirt undone, revealing hints of the white lace (push-up) bra I wore underneath. Don't judge. Some people are mammarily challenged and need a little boost. Anyway, if I showed a little cleavage my pervert boss wouldn't care that I was late. Again.  
  
¬† He might even thank me for coming in at all.  
  
¬† Was it wrong of me to rely on the girls to get me out of trouble? Probably. Did I give a shit? Hell, no. In fact, I un abashedly adjusted them for ample display. I was single, twenty-four and determined to keep this job. Anyone who objected could blow me.  
  
¬† See, my dad suffers from massive heart problems and I'm the ""responsible party"" in charge of his bills, not to mention the one who finances his stay at Village on the Park, a nearby assisted living center. I would have loved for him to live with me (not that there's enough space in my one-bedroom efficiency), but it's best that he stays there. They have twenty-four-hour monitoring and make sure he takes his medications, which he ""forgets"" to do when left to his own devices.  
  
¬† Besides, he claims he's never been happier. The women there are ""silver foxes,"" he says, and eager for masculine attention. Dare I mention those silver foxes cost more than high-priced hookers because my dad is always popping the Viagra he buys from his friends?  
  
¬† I'll do anything to ensure my dad's happiness, though, the way he unselfishly ensured my happiness throughout my entire childhood. So I desperately need to keep my current job and get the one I'm interviewing for after my shift.  
  
¬† Can't be late, can't be late, can't be late, I mentally chanted as I searched for my coffee-stained tennis shoes. I've spilled more cappuccinos on them than I've served to high-class snobs. Needless to say, I've served a lot of high-class snobs.  
  
¬† ""Aha! Found you, you dirty little bastards. "" When had I put them in the refrigerator? I tugged them on, shivering as my toes grew numb from the cold.  
  
¬† Meanwhile, the clock ticked away more precious minutes.  
  
¬† I hastily applied blush, mascara and gloss. You'd think the need for money would inspire me to wake up bright and early every morning no matter the circumstances, but you'd be wrong. I was too tired to do bright and early today, even for a stack of greens. Last night I'd bartended a bachelorette party until 3:00 a. m. Me, a girl who knows nothing about alcohol. Sex on the Beach-sure, with the right man. Fuzzy Navel-uh, shower, anyone? Tom Collins-who the hell?  
  
¬† Of course, I'd pretended to be the expert I'd claimed to be in the interview, mixing anything and everything I could get my hands on. My drinks hadn't been the tastiest, but they'd certainly created the desired results. By the end of the evening, all of the women drunkenly swore they loved me and my ""wicked nasty"" concoctions.  
  
¬† The clock chimed the hour: 6:00 a. m.  
  
¬† ""Damn it. "" I rubbed my tired, burning eyes-then froze when I realized the mascara hadn't dried. Freaking great. I probably looked like a boxer who'd lost the big match. As I scrubbed my face with a wet washrag, I watered my dry, brittle plants, multitasking to save time. What would it take to make the little green monsters thrive?  
  
¬† Finally ready to leave, I dug my keys out of the fishbowl. How many drinks had I sucked down last night? I didn't remember dropping my keys in the water. At least the bowl was presently devoid of fish. Martin, my betta, had kicked it a few days ago. Natural causes, I assure you.  
  
¬† ""I hope you're rotting in the sewers,"" I said, looking down. No way he'd made it into heaven. The little snot had hated me, had always fanned his gills and hit the glass whenever I walked into a room. He'd been a present from my last boyfriend, aka the Prince of Darkness. Was it wrong of me to wish the ex had died with the fish?  
  
¬† No time to ponder the ethics of that dream now. I needed to go. Dressed? Check. Shoes? Check. Keys? Check. R¬®¬¶sum¬®¬¶? Check. I'd stuffed it in my work pants last night in preparation for an interview today. Ugh. Yet another menial job. If only I could crawl back into bed, snuggle under the covers and continue my X-rated dream about Vin Diesel and an easy-squeeze tube of chocolate syrup. Double yum! Something about that bald head drove me wild.  
  
¬† Stop daydreaming, woman. I trudged to the front door just as the phone rang. Sighing, I raced into my bedroom. Probably my boss, Ron, but I wanted to double-check just in case. A quick peek at caller ID revealed it was actually my dad. Late as I was, I didn't even think about letting the machine pick up. I grabbed the receiver and held it to my ear. ""Hey, Daddy. ""  
  
¬† ""Hey, doll. What' cha doing?""  
  
¬† ""I'm headed off to work. Everything okay?""  
  
¬† ""Fine, everything's fine. "" His deep, rumbling voice never failed to comfort me. ""You work too hard. ""  
  
¬† ""Ah, but you know it's what I live for,"" I said, and my voice held only truth. I'd never, never let this selfless man know I didn't like my job(s). He'd go off and get one of his own, the old teddy bear. Anything to take care of me. No wonder I loved him so damn much. ""I'm not happy unless I'm working. ""  
  
¬† ""Just like your mother, God rest her soul. Never did understand that mind-set, myself,"" he said. I pictured him shaking his head in wonderment. ""I won't keep you. I just got to looking through old photo albums of you as a baby. I know you visited the other day, but I still wanted to hear your voice. ""  
  
¬† See? He's a sweetie. ""Now you're trying to make me cry. But I'm glad you called. I missed you and your voice, too. ""  
  
¬† He chuckled. ""Aren't we just a pair of mushy-""  
  
¬† ""David!"" I heard a woman call.  
  
¬† ""Oh, hell,"" he said to me. To the woman, he grumbled, ""Not now, Mary. I'm on the phone with my best gal. ""  
  
¬† ""Did you or did you not kiss Janet in the gardens last night?"" Mary demanded in the background.  
  
¬† ""Double hell,"" my dad whispered. Then, ""Oh, crap. I think she's wheeling her chair into my room. "" He paused. ""I guess I should have resisted Janet's invitation for a stroll. ""  
  
¬† ""I guess you should have,"" I said with a laugh.  
  
¬† ""I have to go now. Love you, doll,"" he said.  
  
¬† ""David!"" Mary called, closer now.  
  
¬† ""Love you, too, Daddy. ""  
  
¬† We disconnected, and I stared at the phone for a minute, a smile hovering on my lips. Shaking my head, I rushed out of my tiny apartment with only one wistful backward glance.  
  
¬† ""Let's get this day over with,"" I muttered.  
  
¬† Outside, the dim spring morning proved wonderfully fragrant with the scent of magnolia, but oppressively hot, the air sticky with humidity. Ah, crap. I'd forgotten to bring a little towel to pat away any sweat. In a few minutes, my clothes were going to be plastered to my body. Oh, well. Nothing I could do about that now.  
  
¬† Not wanting to arrive at work hungry (hungry = bitchy and bitchy = fired), I stopped for a caramel glazed doughnut on my way to the bus station-and missed my bus. MARTA, Atlanta 's premiere miss-it-and-you're-screwed transportation system, being what it was, the delay set me back another twenty minutes.  
  
¬† By the time I raced into Utopia, lines were long and winding. Customers were pissed about the wait and quite vocal about it. I yawned. I mean, please. Cry me a river, Richie Richersons. Jeez. Anyone who could afford a daily six-dollar cup of joe didn't need to be complaining about anything.  
  
¬† Ron, my boss, spotted me and gave me a you-are-so-dead scowl.  
  
¬† I squared my shoulders, thereby tightening the material of my shirt, and offered him a chocolate sundae smile, smothered in whipped cream and cher  
ries. Hmm, whipped cream. That would fit nicely in my Vin Diesel fantasy.  
  
¬† Ron's gaze connected with the girls. He paled, looked away and crooked his finger in my general direction. Without glancing to see if I noticed, he pivoted on his heel, a silent command for me to follow him. Great. Freaking great. This didn't bode well.  
  
¬† Breathing deeply of the cinnamon-and-vanilla-scented air, I passed several men and women who were using the tables as mini work spaces, their computers, faxes and shredders surrounding them. I stepped into Ron's small, cramped office.  
  
¬† ""You wanted to see me, Mr. Pretty?""  
  
¬† ""It's Peaty, and shut the door,"" he said, his voice devoid of emotion. He plopped onto his chair, the cluttered desktop shielding his belly paunch. His black gaze remained lowered, not touching any part of me.  
  
¬† Shit.  
  
¬† Palms now sweating, I did as commanded. The smells of dust and cloying aftershave immediately assaulted me, wiping away any lingering hint of baked goods. Without waiting to be told, I claimed the only other seat in the room. A stiff, uncomfortable step stool I liked to call the Naughty Chair. File cabinets pressed close on both sides of me, making me feel pinned.  
  
¬† I studied Ron. He had thin lips, and right now those lips were pressed tightly together, barely visible slashes of pink in the contours of his rotund face. His sandy hair stood on end, as if he'd plowed his fingers through it one too many times. Lines of tension bracketed his eyes, and his brow was furrowed.  
  
¬† Ron had been pissed at me a lot these last few weeks, but he'd never radiated such disgruntled irritation. Such grim determination. I recognized the look, though. I'd gotten it from other bosses over the last year, right before they fired me.  
  
¬† I smothered a sigh. I hadn't always been a bad employee. For nearly five years, I'd worked as a waitress during the day and a maid during the evening. I'd made enough to pay for my living expenses and support my dad, as well as build a nice savings account-a savings account I'd used up during my (forced) hiatus, aka the two months that it had taken me to land this job at the caf¬®¬¶.  
  
¬† Why couldn't I hold back my restlessness anymore? Why couldn't I quash my discontent, as I had for so many years, and stop sabotaging my only source of revenue?  
  
¬† Though I didn't want to admit it, I knew the answer. I'd woken up one morning and realized life was passing me by, moving at high speed while I wallowed behind. Dissatisfaction had filled me-and had only grown since.  
  
¬† ""I'm sorry for anything and everything I might have done,"" I said, when Ron opened his mouth to speak.  
  
¬† ""You're late,"" he growled. ""Again. ""  
  
¬† The fact that I didn't utter, ""Thanks for stating the obvious,"" should have earned me major good-girl points. ""I know, and I really am sorry. "" When his expression didn't soften, when he still didn't glance in my direction, my heart slammed against my ribs. ""I worked another job late into the morning and had trouble waking up. ""  
  
¬† He stared at the wall clock just behind my head and adjusted his chocolate-smeared tie. ""While I like the image of you lingering in bed-""  
  
¬† Sick bastard. Gross. Just. . . gross. I might have thrown up in my mouth. And yes, I understand the irony here. You brought it on yourself, Jamison. What else did you expect, unleashing the girls like that? Suddenly hoping to hide them from view, I hunched my shoulders.  
  
¬† Wait, Ron's mouth was moving. He hadn't stopped talking.  
  
¬† ""-that's just not a good enough excuse. I mean, I can make an exception for it once, twice, but we've had this same conversation seven times now. And you've only worked here a few weeks. ""  
  
¬† ""I'll be on time tomorrow, you have my word. I'll go without sleep if necessary. "" Did I sound as desperate to Ron as I did to myself? Probably. Damn it. I hated to let him see my desperation. Hated, hated, hated. The more desperate he knew I was, the more he could pull my strings and make me dance like a performing monkey.  
  
¬† He tapped a pen against his desktop. ""That's what you said last time. This is a small, independent operation, Belle, and we rely on our employees to provide superior service to keep us in business. ""  
  
¬† ""I do provide superior service,"" I gulped, adding, ""when I'm here. ""  
  
¬† Frowning, he dropped the pen and pushed a hand through his hair, causing more of the sandy locks to spike straight toward the ceiling. ""You think you're good with customers? Really?""  
  
¬† ""Yes, really. "" I knew what was happening here. He teetered on the brink of firing me and was simply trying to work up the courage to utter the words. And, I realized with shattering fear, I might not be able to talk him out of it this time. By this point in our previous talks, he was usually sending me on my way with a stern (but perverted) warning.  
  
¬† Had his irritation given him a supersonic determination no amount of sweet-talking persuasion could penetrate?  
  
¬† My eyes narrowed; my hands clenched into fists. I wouldn't allow him to get rid of me easily. Somehow, some way, I was going to penetrate that wall of nefarious determination. I could not lose this job. Lately very few businesses were willing to take a chance on me, so I could only imagine how long it would take to land another.  
  
¬† ""Stupid jobs,"" I muttered.  
  
¬† ""What was that?"" Ron asked, his gaze sharpening.  
  
¬† Had I said that aloud? ""Oh, uh, nothing. "" I straightened in the chair. ""You were saying?""  
  
¬† He pushed out a sigh. ""You have no people skills, Belle. Instead of smoothing ruffled feathers, you set them on fire. ""  
  
¬† ""I'm telling you, I'm a good employee,"" I said through clenched teeth. And that wasn't a lie. Sure, I usually arrived late, always cussed, sometimes bitched and-and this is not an admission of guilt-(allegedly) borrowed from the stock room. But I worked weekends, holidays and overtime whenever possible. That counted for something, right?  
  
¬† ""I can't believe you're making me do this. "" Ron flipped open a file and ran a blunt-tipped finger down the front page. ""Complaint-server is rude and pushy. Complaint-server made tea instead of coffee. Complaint-server is rude. Complaint-server is rude. Complaint-server is rude. Shall I go on?""  
  
¬† ""I don't let the customers yell and scream at me. "" Indignation gave me a sense of bravery, and I sat up even straighter, shoulders squared. Did people have nothing better to do with their lives than complain about a lowly server? ""That doesn't make me rude, it makes me human. ""  
  
¬† ""Jenni doesn't yell at customers even when they yell at her. ""  
  
¬† ""Jenni is a brown-nosing moron. ""  
  
¬† Another sigh. ""Belle-"" Finally, his gaze landed on me and out of habit slid straight to the girls. He swallowed, his Adam's apple bobbing like a dinghy in a tidal wave. ""Uh, what was I saying?""  
  
¬† I almost grinned, every muscle in my body relaxing. Penetration complete. And so much easier than I'd anticipated.  
  
¬† Being looked at was far different from hearing his sex-offender voice comment about me lingering in bed. This I could handle. ""I believe you were about to tell me to get to work and never be late again. I planned to respond by telling you that you're the best boss in the world and I'll make you proud. ""  
  
¬† ""Yes, I wanted to tell you to get to-"" Eyes widening, he shook his head. ""That's not what I meant to say,"" he said, a stern edge creeping into his voice. But he closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose. He muttered something under his breath that sounded suspiciously like brought down by a pair of pretty knockers. ""I should fire you, you know. Hell, that's why I brought you in here. ""  
  
¬† ""I know,"" I admitted softly. I didn't mean to be such a disappointment to him. Honest. I just, well, I had always dreamed of being a-Wait. My eyebrows drew together. Even as a little girl, I hadn't been able to decide what I wanted to be when I grew up. I still didn't know. But being a peon stuck in a cycle of debt and endless servitude hadn't been, and still wasn't, part of my life's ambition.  
  
¬† Don't get me wrong. For my dad, I'd sign my soul over to the devil. Permanent ink. No ""out"" clause. Dad had toiled and slaved for years in construction, even when his weak heart caused him more pain than one person should ever have to bear. He'd worked so hard because he loved me, because he'd wanted me to hav  
e pretty clothes and take fun trips with my friends. But mostly because he'd wanted to make up for the car accident that had killed my mom when I was a toddler.  
  
¬† After I graduated high school, I had convinced him to quit, and I'd happily taken care of him ever since. I didn't regret it; truly I didn't, but my life had fallen into such a rut that sometimes I did wish for something extraordinary to happen to me. Something amazing, perhaps a little wild. What, I didn't know.  
  
¬† I frowned. No more wishing for things I couldn't have. From this point on, I would be a better employee. I would work harder, be less confrontational. Screw restlessness! Ron was giving me another chance, and I wouldn't let him down.  
  
¬† ""I swear, Belle, you keep my ulcer in fighting form,"" he said darkly. He reached into his desk drawer, withdrew a packet of Tums and popped several in his mouth. ""Why can't I be more like the Donald and just say it? You're fired. Boom. You're fired. So easy in theory. "" He sighed yet again, this one a dejected exhalation that made his shoulders sag. ""This is your last chance. If you screw this up-""  
  
¬† ""I won't. Swear to God. "" I didn't mention that I needed to leave a wee bit early today if I hoped to make my interview with Ambassador Suites, a nearby hotel. I'd bring up that little gem later. I'd double up my coffee-making or something to earn the early departure. ""I'll be so good you'll nominate me for Employee of the Week. Maybe Employee of the Month. ""  
  
¬† ""Yeah. Right. "" He popped a few more Tums and eyed the girls again. ""I can't believe I'm doing this. Go. Open a register before I change my mind. ""  
  
¬† Grinning, I blew him a kiss, bounded out of my chair and raced to the door. Thank God for perverts.  
  
¬† I SPENT THE NEXT SEVERAL hours being a good little robot, smiling a sunshine-and-roses smile and waving customers to my register like a Miss America contestant. All under Ron's hawklike eyes. Once, I came close to bitch-slapping a woman who had the nerve to ask me if I moved that slow for everyone or if she was just special.  
  
¬† You're certainly a special pain in my ass, I'd wanted to say. But I didn't. I restrained myself from violence (see ""bitch-slap"" comment above), consoled by the thought that such an evil witch would surely acquire deep, deep wrinkles and lose all her teeth and hair before she kicked it.  
  
¬† My friend Sherridan-the only friend I had, really, since she didn't mind the fact that I had no free time-would have been proud of me for remaining silent and not launching myself forward, a catapult of retribution. When we were in grade school, she'd told me the devil on my right shoulder must have brutally strangled the angel on my left, destroying any hint of moral influence.  
  
¬† I plead the Fifth on that.  
  
¬† Speaking of Sherridan, she strolled into the caf¬®¬¶ a few minutes later, spotted me and waved. She was talking on her cell. She was tall and gorgeous with blond curls and curves that went on forever, curves that were now encased in an emerald pants suit. She marched to me, bypassing the line to stand beside my register, and hooked her cell to her waist. ""Hey, you,"" she said with a warm smile.  
  
¬† ""Hey, back,"" I said, but kept my gaze on the customer and pretended to listen to her order. I loved when Sherridan visited me here. Technically, employees were discouraged from having guests, but lately it was the only time we spent together. ""You look good. ""  
  
¬† ""Thank you. "" She spoke over the frowning customer. ""I'm showing a house later today and want to impress the buyer-who is half of the reason I'm here. "" She clapped her hands in excitement. ""I got us dates. ""  
  
¬† ""Dates?"" Months had passed since I'd even thought the word, so it was foreign on my tongue. ""Do you want cinnamon sprinkled on your half-caf?"" I asked my customer.  
  
¬† ""With twins,"" Sherridan said proudly. ""Wealthy twins. ""  
  
¬† ""Yes,"" the customer said through tight lips.  
  
¬† Sherridan didn't pause. ""I think the older one likes me. "" There was a twinge of uncertainty in her voice.  
  
¬† ""I'm sure he does,"" I said. ""You're beautiful and smart. "" Sherridan liked to pretend she was confident, but deep down she needed reassurance when it came to men. She tended to fall for them quickly, become horribly needy and unsure, and drive them away. ""I'm working that night, though. ""  
  
¬† Sherridan's grin slipped a little, and she narrowed her silver eyes suspiciously. ""I didn't tell you-"" her phone rang ""-when. ""  
  
¬† ""Sometime today on that drink,"" my customer said, drumming her nails on the counter.  
  
¬† ""Doesn't matter about the day. "" I turned, grabbed a carton of milk and poured a measured amount into the proper container. ""I'm always working. ""  
  
¬† ""Leslie,"" Sherridan said to her assistant, ""this isn't a good time. I'm in a meeting. "" She ended the call. ""Belle, can't you take a day off? Just one? Please?""  
  
¬† A wave of longing hit me, but I didn't speak for several seconds as the milk steamed, buzzing loudly. When that tapered to quiet, I said, ""I wish I could, Sher, but I'm interviewing for a second job later and I'll be working nights if I get it. ""  
  
¬† ""Not another one,"" she said with a groan.  
  
¬† ""Hey, server girl. Can I get an ETA on my drink? I'm in a mad rush, and you're taking forever. ""  
  
¬† My gaze sought and met the opposition's, my hazel against her brown. My impatience against her annoyance. She was a tall woman, tanned and toned, almost muscular, with leathery skin and hair as dark a brown as mine. But while my hair was long and straight (and, I like to think, silky), hers was short and frizzy, as if she'd left her perm rods in a thousand years too long.  
  
¬† ""My name is not server or girl,"" I muttered under my breath. To her, I said loudly, ""It'll be done in a second, sir. Oops, my bad. I mean, ma'am. ""  
  
¬† She scowled.  
  
¬† ""Belle,"" Ron called warningly.  
  
¬† I gritted my teeth, nearly grinding them into powder, and prepared the stupid half-caf. All the while I chanted in my mind, I will behave myself. I will behave myself. I will freaking behave myself. On the bright side, at least Ron was overlooking Sherridan's visit.  
  
¬† ""Well, I should go before Super Curls throws a fit,"" Sherridan said, ignoring my customer's scowl. She leaned over and kissed my cheek. ""Call me if you change your mind about the twins. They have the cutest, tightest asses ever and if you married one-a twin, not his ass-all of your money troubles would be over. "" With that, she was off.  
  
¬† I handed Super Curls the coffee, but didn't get a thank-you.  
  
¬† ""I'll have a skinny venti vanilla, please,"" my next customer said.  
  
¬† ""Sugar free?""  
  
¬† His face scrunched in disgust. ""I said skinny, not tasteless. ""  
  
¬† And so another hour passed unmercifully. I should have chucked my apron and left with Sherridan. ""This isn't what I ordered,"" I heard. ""Your fingers touched the rim, so I need you to start over and make me a new, uncontaminated drink,"" I heard. ""You call this an espresso? I've had stronger water,"" I heard.  
  
¬† Did I complain? Did I mix anyone a swirlie (aka spit in their drink)? No and no! The continued restraint cost me, though. My stomach was a clenched knot of pain. My skin felt too tight against my bones. A tic had developed under my left eye. My back throbbed, and my feet ached-and not from standing too long. I was used to that. The ache was because I hadn't allowed myself to deliver a few much needed ass beatings.  
  
¬† If I didn't get Employee of the Week after this. . . Wait. I decided I'd rather have a break.  
  
¬† When I sent my last customer on her way, I glanced over at Ron, who had stopped watching me long enough to turn his attention to a woman who looked like she'd walked straight out of an X-rated pin-up. She sauntered past him, her red spandex halter top and shorts revealing more T and A than a Penthouse centerfold-not that I'd ever peeked inside one of those magazines (cough, cough). Ron adjusted his belt. I snapped my fingers to gain his attention, but the woman's thong-clad ass held him enthralled.  
  
¬† The bell above the door jingled, signaling the arrival of yet another group of patrons. Their eyes were feral, and I could tell they were desperate for their morning fix. If I didn't act quickly, I'd be stuck here a minimum-minimum!-of twenty more minutes, and I just didn't have another second of sweetness in me.  
  
&nb  
sp; With a speed Superman would have envied, I began closing out my register.  
  
¬† ""What are you doing?"" Jenni, Employee of the Year-or, as I liked to call her, Bitch of the Millennium-demanded. She stood at the only other open register, a short, rounded-in-all-the-right-places blonde who drew male attention simply by breathing. She'd made her hatred of me known my first day on the job, tripping me every time I walked past her, handing me regular coffee when I asked for decaf.  
  
¬† Why she hated me, I didn't know. Didn't care, really.  
  
¬† ""You're smart. "" I scratched my forehead with my middle finger, covertly flipping her off. ""Figure it out. "" With her infuriated gasp ringing in my ears, I strode over to Ron and tapped him on the shoulder.  
  
¬† He jumped and clutched a hand over his heart as he whipped to face me. ""Jesus H. Christ!""  
  
¬† ""No, I'm Belle,"" I said drily.  
  
¬† ""What do you want?"" he grumbled.  
  
¬† ""I'd really like to take my first fifteen-minute break. If that's okay with you, Mr. Pretty,"" I added sweetly.  
  
¬† ""It's Peaty. "" He glanced at his wristwatch. ""Fine. Whatever. "" His gaze slid back to the walking centerfold, now bending over to pick up the napkin she'd ""accidentally"" dropped, her shorts riding higher up her butt.  
  
¬† Shaking my head, I gathered the necessary items needed for a. . . hmm. What did I want? A mocha latte, I decided in the next flash. Yep. That sounded good. That's what I'd have. If anyone deserved chocolate, it was me.  
  
¬† ""You're such a bitch,"" Jenni muttered, suddenly at my side to mix a chai tea.  
  
¬† ""Your jealousy is showing,"" I uttered in a singsong voice. I poured two shots of espresso into my cup, then whole milk. I didn't do skim. ""If you'd stopped sneaking bites of muffins, ¬®¬¶clairs and cake slices you might have realized someone was due to go on break. ""  
  
¬† Jenni gasped. ""I'll have you know I have low blood sugar. I have to eat. ""  
  
¬† ""Right. I totally believe you and don't think you're delusional in the least. ""  
  
¬† ""You're just begging for a piece of me, you know that?"" she growled.  
  
¬† ""I don't know what gave you the idea I've lowered my standards, but I assure you, I haven't. I want no part of you. By the way, you have a piece of dough stuck in your teeth. "" Latte completed, I skipped to an empty table. As I sipped the hot, deliciously sweet liquid (perfectly prepared, thank you!) I stared out the large storefront window and grinned. Ah, my little interlude with Jenni had revived my spirits, chasing away the tension brought on by forced charm.  
  
¬† Across the way loomed a pretty, obviously well maintained brownstone with steel-enforced, tinted windows. The bushes surrounding it were expertly trimmed and hedged. Flowers bloomed prettily in the spring sun, a pink, red and gold rainbow of petals.  
  
¬† But there were no signs, no advertisements to be seen. Occasionally I'd spotted a car or two in the parking lot, as I did now, so I knew people worked there. But I'd never been able to figure out what kind of business it was, had never seen an employee entering or leaving.  
  
¬† The place intrigued me. Always had. I'd thought about sneaking over there late one night and peeking inside, but usually fell asleep before working up the strength to leave my apartment. Perhaps it was a-  
  
¬† I blinked. What the hell? A tall, lanky man in a lab coat suddenly barreled out the front door of the brownstone at top speed, his eyes wide and wild, his white comb-over flapping in the breeze. One minute he wasn't there, the next he was. My back went ramrod straight, the movement swishing precious latte over the rim of the cup. I blinked again, as if the action could jump-start my brain into figuring out why he was running.  
  
¬† The man darted across the street, uncaring as vehicles honked and swerved to keep from hitting him. Two of the cars collided. Even from where I sat, I heard the squeal of tires and the grind of smashing metal.  
  
¬† My eyes rounded as two burly, scowling guys sprinted out of the brownstone, apparently giving chase to the harried, wreck-causing man-who was now racing inside Utopia as if his life depended on it.  
  
¬† The bell chimed and I shoved myself to my feet, spilling my latte further. I set the cup on the table and stared over at the man. Skin pale, features tense, breath emerging raggedly, he scanned the caf¬®¬¶ wildly. His gaze bypassed me, then quickly snapped back. Across the distance, our eyes locked.  
  
¬† ""Are you okay?"" I called, projecting my voice over the inane chatter around us.  
  
¬† ""Please, help me,"" he choked out. He sprinted toward me, shoving people out of the way and babbling, ""They weren't supposed to know. They weren't supposed to chase me. ""  
  
¬† Some gasped. Some snarled, ""Watch it. ""  
  
¬† When the man reached me, he gripped my forearms. Sweat trickled from his brow; fear filled his dilated eyes. ""You have to help me,"" he said between shallow pants. ""They're going to kill me. ""  
  
¬† Kill? My mouth went dry; my blood mutated into ice, yet hot prickles slithered along my spine. ""Stay here,"" I said. ""No, hide. No, stay. Oh, hell. Do whatever while I call 911. "" His clasp tightened on me, but I tugged free and shouted to the people around me, ""Does anyone have a cell phone?"" I'd given mine up as an extravagance I could no longer afford. ""Anyone?"" I leapt around the tables, but everyone purposefully avoided my gaze. ""I won't use up your minutes, I swear. This is an emergency. ""  
  
¬† ""I demand to speak with the manager,"" someone said, wanting, I'm sure, to complain about what had just happened and demand free service.  
  
¬† I rushed into Ron's office and grabbed the phone. The 911 dispatcher answered after only two rings, and I explained what had happened. ""A man was chased into this caf¬®¬¶,"" I rushed out. ""He says someone's trying to kill him. "" As I spoke, a woman screamed in the background. A male groaned.  
  
¬† ""Help is on the way,"" the dispatcher promised.  
  
¬† Heart hammering, I disregarded her plea to remain on the line, and tossed the receiver aside. I pounded back into the main area and skidded to a stop. I'd only been gone a moment, but the caf¬®¬¶ looked like a natural disaster had struck. Tables were overturned. Chairs were strewn in every direction. Coffee slithered along the floor, a black river, with paper cups and napkins floating in it like dead bodies.  
  
¬† Shaking and scared, the caf¬®¬¶'s patrons and employees huddled in a single corner. Only Ron seemed unafraid. His arms were wrapped around Jenni, and he was copping a feel.  
  
¬† The man in the lab coat had vanished. Was he hiding?  
  
¬† The two guys I'd observed chasing him were now in the process of calming everyone down. A third male, whom I hadn't seen exit the brownstone, stood at the doorway, preventing anyone from entering or leaving. He was young, probably in his mid-thirties, tall and muscled, with blond hair and a face any male model would have envied. Perfect, chiseled and droolworthy. He watched the proceedings as if mentally cataloging every detail.  
  
¬† ""Everyone take a seat,"" he finally said, his voice firm, no-nonsense. ""Get comfortable. We're going to be here awhile. ""  
  
¬† ""What's going on?"" I demanded, since no one else had spoken up. ""Who are you?"" Maybe I shouldn't have drawn attention to myself, but there was no way in hell I'd just blithely obey, perhaps walking to my own death.  
  
¬† ""CIA. "" He frowned and flashed some sort of badge. ""Now sit. ""  
  
¬† CIA? My jaw performed a dance of drop and close, drop and close. I'd seen agents on TV, of course, but never in real life. Still, everything inside me screamed not to trust him. I mean, Lab Coat's voice kept drifting through my head. They're going to kill me. They're going to kill me!  
  
¬† But. . . what if Lab Coat was an evil man who needed killing? Or what if Pretty Boy was lying and Lab Coat was really the good guy? What if I confused myself to the point of having an aneurism with all these internal questions?  
  
¬† Think, Jamison, think. Sit down. No, run. Sit. Yes, that's what I'd do. No, no. I should run. As I continually changed my mind, my right foot moved back and forth while the left remained in place. Step, retreat. Step, retreat. Damn it! If I made the wrong decision, there was a very good chance tomorrow's headlines would read: Local Idiot Found Dead. ""Victim's friend laments, 'If Belle had taken a day off like I asked, she'd  
still be alive. '""  
  
¬† My eyes slitted. ""What happened to that guy? The one in the lab coat?""  
  
¬† Pretty Boy crossed his arms over his chest and pinned me with a dark, almost hypnotic stare. ""That's none of your concern. Now,"" he said, speaking to the entire room, ""I have questions, and you're going to answer me. ""  
  
¬† Those eyes. . . they were intense, commanding, a little scary. ""I just called the cops,"" I gulped out. ""If you hurt us, you'll be thrown in prison and become Big Daddy's bitch. ""  
  
¬† His gaze flicked to one of Lab Coat's pursuers, now our guard. He was a beast of a man, with a thick, black beard (were those peas between the hairs?) and more muscles than Arnold in his prime. ""Take care of it. ""  
  
¬† Take care of what? Beast radioed. . . the cops? He spoke too quietly for me to hear what he was saying. Meanwhile, the other guard ushered everyone into chairs. Everyone except me, that is. Maybe I looked menacing and they didn't want to mess with me. Hey, it was a possibility.  
  
¬† But I didn't understand why they were content to remain in here instead of chasing Lab Coat. Or had they caught him and ushered him away while I was on the phone? Why question us, then, if they already had him?  
  
¬† ""That man is a dangerous criminal,"" Pretty Boy told me. He must have realized that I wouldn't cooperate otherwise.  
  
¬† ""It's in your best interest to help us. ""  
  
¬† Dangerous criminal-the magic words of my capitulation. ""All right, fine,"" I said grudgingly, deciding to give him the benefit of the doubt. He had a badge, after all. ""But if anyone pulls a weapon on me, I'm going PMS on their ass. ""  
  
¬† ""So noted,"" he said with a dry edge, completely unimpressed.  
  
¬† Thankfully, the table I'd occupied earlier remained upright. My latte sat on the surface, unharmed. I plopped down and lifted the cup to my lips, sipping. Warm and sweet-sweeter than it had been earlier, as if the chocolate had thickened. Mmm. I continued sipping, taking comfort from it.  
  
¬† Pretty Boy questioned us one at a time, writing names and answers in a notebook. How very detective he was. He asked everyone the same three questions: 1) What is your name and address? 2) Did you see the man in the lab coat? 3) Did he say anything to you or give you anything?  
  
¬† Pretty Boy spoke with me the longest and had more than the standard three questions for me. What had made me want to help Lab Coat-""the doctor,"" Pretty Boy called him, careful not to use his real name. Did we secretly plan to meet later? Had I ever met with the doctor before this?  
  
¬† I didn't bother lying. Actually, I wasn't sure I could lie to this man. Every time he turned those intense brown eyes on me, I felt compelled to share my deepest, darkest secrets. Not in a girls' sleepover kind of way, but an I'll-die-if-I-don't kind of way. Very weird.  
  
¬† And you know what? I didn't get any answers to my questions. What was his name? Why were they chasing Lab Coat? What made the man so dangerous? Was Pretty Boy going to eat the chocolate ¬®¬¶clair he'd pilfered from the fridge? I was starved.  
  
¬† Finally, Pretty Boy and his men left, followed quickly by the customers. I'd expected him to threaten us if we told the press or cops-or anyone, really-what had happened, but he didn't. I'd expected the police to arrive (as promised), but they never did. I guess they really had been taken care of, which probably meant Pretty Boy was the CIA agent he'd claimed to be and Lab Coat actually was a criminal. I hoped I didn't get in trouble for having tried to aid him.

1mxbjjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1mxbjjz/what_makes_the_best_coffee_maker_ninja_ce251/,What Makes the Best Coffee Maker Ninja CE251 Worth Trying Today,"The Ninja CE251 is a coffee maker I‚Äôve been using daily, and it has quickly become an indispensable part of my morning routine. With its sleek black and stainless steel design, this machine not only blends effortlessly with my kitchen decor but also stands out with a modern and professional touch. While compact in size, it boasts enough capacity to brew up to 12 cups of coffee, making it ideal for both solo coffee lovers like me and larger households. On a typical day, firing up this programmable brewer feels seamless, allowing me to prep my coffee the night before and wake up to a freshly brewed pot in the morning.

**Ease of Use and Programming Features**  
Programming the Ninja CE251 is as straightforward as it gets. The buttons and LED display are intuitive, and it took me no time to figure out how to set the delay brew feature. This means I‚Äôve bid farewell to those groggy, uncaffeinated waits in the mornings because my coffee is ready and waiting when I stumble into the kitchen. The brewing strength control is another feature I‚Äôve found incredibly convenient. Some days need a bold wake-me-up cup, while others call for a regular, lighter brew, and this machine delivers both with just a simple adjustment.

[Find the best price for Ninja CE251 on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b07ztyztj5/)

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker feels sturdy and well-constructed without being overly heavy. The black and stainless steel finish not only adds elegance but also resists smudges and fingerprints fairly well. I‚Äôve grown to appreciate the removable water reservoir, which might sound like a small feature but is a game-changer when it comes to refilling without spills. The glass carafe, though lightweight, feels durable and pours smoothly without any drips.

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
What truly won me over is the coffee quality. The hot plate keeps the coffee warm for up to four hours without that burnt taste I‚Äôve experienced with other machines. The brewing temperature is optimal, ensuring that I get a rich and balanced flavor every time, whether I‚Äôm brewing a full pot or just a smaller batch. It‚Äôs also noticeably quieter compared to other models I‚Äôve tried, which is a blessing during those peaceful early mornings.

**Benefits**  
- User-friendly controls and programmable features.  
- Consistent brewing temperature for a rich coffee taste.  
- Hot plate keeps coffee warm without compromising quality.  

**Drawbacks**  
- The machine isn‚Äôt entirely silent, though the noise is minimal.  
- It can take up considerable counter space if you have a small kitchen.  

**Maintenance and Cleaning**  
Cleaning this coffee maker has been a breeze. The removable components like the water reservoir and filter basket make it easy to keep things sanitary. I run a descaling cycle every month using a vinegar solution, as recommended by the manual, and so far, there‚Äôs been no build-up or performance dip. 

**Competing Products**  
Compared to similar models like the Cuisinart DCC-3200 or the Hamilton Beach 49976, the Ninja CE251 holds its ground firmly. Where it excels is the brewing consistency and build quality. The Cuisinart offers a slightly larger capacity and a self-cleaning feature, but I found its brewing process less intuitive. The Hamilton Beach model, while cheaper, lacks the same refined build and doesn‚Äôt deliver coffee that‚Äôs as hot and flavorful.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
Given what it offers, this coffee maker hits the sweet spot between price and quality. It may not be the cheapest option available, but its sturdy build, advanced features, and excellent coffee output make it worth every penny. If you‚Äôre serious about your coffee but don‚Äôt want to break the bank, this is a fantastic choice.

1mxbjir,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1mxbjir/reveal_the_hype_is_the_best_electric_kettle_aarke/,Reveal the Hype Is the Best Electric Kettle Aarke 1244 Worth It,"The Aarke 1244 stainless steel kettle has become a staple in my kitchen, and after using it daily for weeks, I have some thoughts to share. Let‚Äôs dive in to see what makes this sleek kitchen gadget work and where it might fall short.  

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing you‚Äôll notice about this kettle is its minimalist design. It‚Äôs crafted from stainless steel, giving it a modern, polished look that fits seamlessly into any kitchen decor. The build feels premium and sturdy, easily justifying its branding as a high-end product. At 1.2 liters, it‚Äôs compact but sufficient for most household needs, whether you‚Äôre brewing tea for one or making coffee for a small group. The double-wall construction isn't just for show‚Äîit keeps the exterior cool while locking in heat, which is both practical and child-safe. I don‚Äôt have to worry about accidental burns when my nieces scamper around the countertop.  

**Ease of Use**  
Operating this kettle has been straightforward. The smooth-opening lid is a particularly thoughtful feature‚Äîit prevents hot water droplets from splashing out, making refilling safe and mess-free. The 360¬∞ swivel base makes it easy to grab the kettle from any angle, which I found convenient when multitasking in the kitchen. The non-drip spout deserves a special mention. Pouring water into my French press became a more precise task, and no water trails were left on the counter.  

[Find the best price for Aarke 1244 on Amazon.](https://applegreenshop.com/p/b0cwhk6xzp/)  

**Performance in Daily Life**  
This isn‚Äôt just a pretty appliance; it performs excellently. The heating is quick and consistent. Mornings are a little easier when I can get boiling water for my cup of tea in just a few minutes. It‚Äôs also impressively quiet, which is not something I can say for a lot of other electric kettles. Whether you live alone or share a space with light sleepers, this feature is bound to be appreciated.  

**Safety Features**  
Dry boil protection is an absolute lifesaver. On more than one occasion, I caught myself turning it on without checking the water level first, but this kettle automatically powered down before any damage could occur. It‚Äôs a comforting layer of safety, especially in a busy household.  

**Pluses**  
- Stylish and robust stainless-steel design.  
- Convenient and safe features, like non-drip spout and cool-to-touch exterior.  
- Energy-efficient double-wall insulation.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
Despite its many strengths, no product is perfect, and this kettle has a few minor quirks:  
- It‚Äôs on the heavier side for its size, making it slightly cumbersome to handle when full.  
- The manual nature might not appeal to those seeking more advanced functionalities like temperature control.  

**Competing Products**  
If you are looking around for alternatives, models like the Fellow Stagg EKG and the Breville Smart Kettle are worth considering. The Fellow Stagg offers precise temperature control, which is a boon for brewing specialty coffees and teas, although it comes at a higher price point. On the flip side, Breville scores high in capacity and advanced features but lacks the elegance and quiet operation that the Aarke provides. What sets this kettle apart is its balance of form and function, a blend that feels unique even in a crowded market of premium kettles.  

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Given the array of thoughtful features, premium design, and top-tier performance, the price feels justified. It‚Äôs not just a kettle; it‚Äôs an investment in a well-rounded kitchen experience. If you're someone who appreciates both aesthetics and practicality, this could be the kettle for you.

1mxbhqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/zapier/comments/1mxbhqf/why_90_of_ai_videos_sound_terrible_the_audio/,Why 90% of AI videos sound terrible (the audio guide everyone ignores),"this is 7going to be a long post but audio is the most overlooked element that separates viral AI content from garbage‚Ä¶



Spent 9 months obsessing over visuals - perfect prompts, camera movements, lighting, color grading. My videos looked amazing but felt lifeless. Engagement was mediocre at best.



Then I discovered something that changed everything: \*\*Audio context makes AI video feel real even when it‚Äôs obviously artificial.\*\*



Most creators completely ignore audio elements in their prompts. Massive mistake that kills engagement before viewers realize why.



\## The Audio Psychology Breakthrough:



\*\*Visual:\*\* What you see



\*\*Audio:\*\* How you FEEL about what you see



\*\*Same video with different audio = completely different emotional response.\*\*



Your brain processes audio faster than visual. Bad audio makes good visuals feel wrong. Good audio makes mediocre visuals feel amazing.



\## Audio Cues That Actually Work:



\### Environmental Audio:



\`\`\`

""Audio: gentle wind through trees, distant birds""

""Audio: city traffic hum, occasional car horn""

""Audio: ocean waves lapping, seagull calls""

""Audio: rain pattering on windows, distant thunder""

\`\`\`



\*\*Why it works:\*\* Creates believable space context



\### Action-Specific Audio:



\`\`\`

""Audio: footsteps on wet concrete""

""Audio: mechanical keyboard clicking, mouse clicks""

""Audio: pages turning, paper rustling""

""Audio: glass clinking, liquid pouring""

\`\`\`



\*\*Why it works:\*\* Makes actions feel physically real



\### Emotional Audio:



\`\`\`

""Audio: heartbeat getting faster""

""Audio: heavy breathing, slight echo""

""Audio: clock ticking, building tension""

""Audio: soft humming, peaceful ambiance""

\`\`\`



\*\*Why it works:\*\* Guides audience emotional state



\### Technical Audio:



\`\`\`

""Audio: electrical humming, circuit buzzing""

""Audio: machinery whirring, gears turning""

""Audio: digital glitches, electronic beeps""

""Audio: camera shutter clicks, focus sounds""

\`\`\`



\*\*Why it works:\*\* Reinforces high-tech/professional feel



\## Platform-Specific Audio Strategy:



\### TikTok:



\- \*\*Trending sounds > original audio\*\*

\- \*\*High energy beats work best\*\*

\- \*\*Audio needs to grab attention in first 2 seconds\*\*

\- \*\*Sync visual beats with audio beats\*\*



\### Instagram:



\- \*\*Original audio performs better\*\*

\- \*\*Smooth, atmospheric audio preferred\*\*

\- \*\*Audio should enhance mood, not distract\*\*

\- \*\*Licensed music works well for brand content\*\*



\### YouTube:



\- \*\*Educational voiceover + ambient audio\*\*

\- \*\*Longer audio beds acceptable\*\*

\- \*\*Tutorial content benefits from clear narration\*\*

\- \*\*Background music should support, not compete\*\*



\## The Technical Implementation:



\### Basic Audio Prompt Structure:



\`\`\`

\[VISUAL CONTENT\], Audio: \[ENVIRONMENTAL\] + \[ACTION\] + \[EMOTIONAL\]



Example: ""Person walking through rain, Audio: rain on pavement + footsteps splashing + distant thunder, peaceful ambiance""

\`\`\`



\### Advanced Audio Layering:



\`\`\`

Primary: Main environmental sound

Secondary: Action-specific sounds

Tertiary: Emotional/atmospheric elements



Example: ""Cyberpunk street scene, Audio: city traffic (primary) + neon sign buzzing (secondary) + distant techno music (tertiary)""

\`\`\`



\## Real Examples That Transform Content:



\### Before (Visual Only):



\`\`\`

""Beautiful woman drinking coffee in caf√©""

\`\`\`



\*\*Result:\*\* Looks pretty but feels artificial



\### After (Visual + Audio):



\`\`\`

""Beautiful woman drinking coffee in caf√©, Audio: coffee shop ambiance, gentle conversation murmur, espresso machine steaming, ceramic cup setting on saucer""

\`\`\`



\*\*Result:\*\* Feels like you‚Äôre actually there



\### Before (Visual Only):



\`\`\`

""Sports car driving through tunnel""

\`\`\`



\*\*Result:\*\* Looks cool but no impact



\### After (Visual + Audio):



\`\`\`

""Sports car driving through tunnel, Audio: engine roar echoing off walls, tire squeal on concrete, wind rushing past, gear shifts""

\`\`\`



\*\*Result:\*\* Visceral, engaging experience



\## Audio Context for Different Content Types:



\### Product Showcase:



\`\`\`

""Audio: subtle ambient hum, satisfying click sounds, premium material interactions""

\`\`\`



\### Portrait/Beauty:



\`\`\`

""Audio: soft breathing, gentle fabric movement, natural environmental ambiance""

\`\`\`



\### Action/Sports:



\`\`\`

""Audio: crowd cheering distance, equipment sounds, heavy breathing, ground impact""

\`\`\`



\### Tech/Business:



\`\`\`

""Audio: keyboard typing, mouse clicks, notification sounds, office ambiance""

\`\`\`



\### Nature/Landscape:



\`\`\`

""Audio: wind movement, water flowing, birds, insects, natural environment""

\`\`\`



\## The Cost Factor for Audio Testing:



Audio experimentation requires multiple generations to test different combinations. Google‚Äôs direct Veo3 pricing makes this expensive.



I‚Äôve been using \[veo3gen.app\](https://veo3gen.app/) for audio testing - they offer Veo3 access at much lower costs, makes systematic audio experimentation financially viable.



\## Advanced Audio Techniques:



\### Audio Progression:



\`\`\`

Start: ""Distant city sounds""

Middle: ""Approaching footsteps, sounds getting closer""

End: ""Close-up audio, intimate sound space""

\`\`\`



\*\*Creates natural audio journey\*\*



\### Emotional Audio Arcs:



\`\`\`

Tension: ""Quiet ambiance, building to intense sounds""

Release: ""Chaotic sounds settling to peaceful calm""

Surprise: ""Normal audio suddenly interrupted by unexpected sound""

\`\`\`



\*\*Guides audience emotional experience\*\*



\### Synchronized Audio-Visual:



\`\`\`

""Camera zoom matches audio intensity increase""

""Visual rhythm synced with audio beats""

""Audio cues precede visual changes by 0.5 seconds""

\`\`\`



\*\*Creates professional, intentional feel\*\*



\## Common Audio Mistakes:



1. \*\*No audio context at all\*\* (biggest mistake)

2. \*\*Generic ‚Äúambient music‚Äù without specificity\*\*

3. \*\*Audio that competes with visual instead of supporting\*\*

4. \*\*Inconsistent audio perspective with camera angle\*\*

5. \*\*Forgetting platform audio preferences\*\*



\## Audio Analysis Framework:



When I see viral AI content, I analyze:

\- \*\*What audio creates the emotional hook?\*\*

\- \*\*How does audio support the visual narrative?\*\*



\- \*\*What specific sounds make it feel ‚Äúreal‚Äù?\*\*

\- \*\*How does audio guide attention/pacing?\*\*



\## The Results After Adding Audio Focus:



\- \*\*3x higher engagement rates\*\* on identical visual content

\- \*\*Comments mentioning ‚Äúimmersive‚Äù and ‚Äúrealistic‚Äù\*\* increased dramatically

\- \*\*Longer watch times\*\* from improved audio context

\- \*\*Platform performance improved\*\* across all channels



\## Industry-Specific Audio Libraries:



\### Tech/Startup Content:



\`\`\`

\- Keyboard mechanical clicks

\- Mouse button sounds

\- Notification pings

\- Video call audio

\- Office ambient hum

\`\`\`



\### Lifestyle/Beauty:



\`\`\`

\- Fabric rustling

\- Cosmetic container clicks

\- Water droplet sounds

\- Soft breathing

\- Page turning

\`\`\`



\### Automotive/Action:



\`\`\`

\- Engine sounds specific to vehicle type

\- Tire on different road surfaces

\- Wind noise at speed

\- Mechanical interactions

\- Impact sounds

\`\`\`



\## The Meta Strategy:



\*\*Most creators optimize visuals. Smart creators optimize the complete sensory experience.\*\*



Audio context:

\- Makes artificial feel authentic

\- Guides emotional response



\- Increases engagement time

\- Improves platform algorithm performance

\- Creates memorable content



\## Systematic Audio Development:



\*\*Build audio libraries organized by:\*\*

\- Content type (portrait, product, action)

\- Emotional goal (tension, calm, energy)



\- Platform optimization (TikTok vs Instagram)

\- Technical requirements (voiceover compatible)



\*\*The audio breakthrough transformed my content from pretty pictures to engaging experiences.\*\* Audiences feel the difference even when they don‚Äôt consciously notice the audio work.



Audio is the secret weapon most AI creators ignore. Once you start thinking audio-first, your content immediately feels more professional and engaging.

1mxbhq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Dazzling-Mousse-6850/comments/1mxbhq9/should_i_try_to_meet_up_with_him_or_just_let_go/,Should I try to meet up with him or just let go?,"Hi everyone,

I have a bit of a messy situation with a guy I liked from my school club. Last year he asked me out, but at the time I wasn‚Äôt ready, so I turned him down. Over the summer, I realized I do like him, but things feel‚Ä¶ off.

We had our first group hangout recently, and when I approached him, he didn‚Äôt look me in the eye and kind of ignored me at first. Later he did try to talk to me, but it felt really awkward. At the end, I went to say goodbye, and he just fist-bumped me. Overall, it felt like he was keeping his distance.

Now I‚Äôm stuck. Part of me wants to ask him to grab coffee and just talk things out, because I don‚Äôt want to regret not trying. But I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll reject me, and I‚Äôll have to deal with seeing him all the time in our club. I‚Äôm also worried that if we did date, it could become toxic ‚Äî since the timing has always been off (when he shows interest, I pull away, and when I show interest, he pulls away).

My questions are:
Should I ask him to meet up, or is it better to let go and move on?
Is it a bad sign that he acted so distant when we hung out?
Am I being unfair by hoping he still likes me after I rejected him before?

1mxbf7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1mxbf7o/explore_the_best_sandwich_maker_hamilton_beach/,Explore the Best Sandwich Maker Hamilton Beach 25476 Worth It,"Who knew that breakfast could become something I actually look forward to every single day? Ever since I got my hands on the Hamilton Beach 25476, my mornings have been transformed. A hot, fresh, customized sandwich in less than five minutes? It almost feels like I‚Äôve cheated my way into culinary glory. I‚Äôve been using this little red marvel daily, and it‚Äôs fair to say it‚Äôs turned me into somewhat of a breakfast sandwich enthusiast. It‚Äôs not perfect, though, and there are some quirks that caught my attention over time.

**Compact and User-Friendly Design**  
The design of this sandwich maker is surprisingly efficient for how much functionality it packs into such a small package. Its bright red exterior doesn‚Äôt just make it look appealing sitting on my counter‚Äîit‚Äôs also insanely compact, so it doesn‚Äôt hog valuable kitchen space. At just 8 inches deep, 8 inches wide, and 10 inches tall, it‚Äôs smaller than a toaster and fits effortlessly into tight spaces. The added bonus? It‚Äôs lightweight, making it easy to move around. Given my limited counter space, this was a godsend.  

[Check Hamilton Beach 25476 price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b00c95o3hk/)  

**Speedy and Convenient Performance**  
This thing is fast, like really fast. I can toss in a combination of bread, an egg, and toppings of my choice, and it gets everything cooked and assembled like magic in under five minutes. Nothing beats walking into the office with a warm, melty breakfast sandwich in hand while my colleagues sip their lukewarm coffee. It handles English muffins, mini waffles, and even croissants like a pro. However, one caveat here is that any meat you use needs to be precooked. I learned this the messy way when I tried using raw sausage on day one (rookie mistake).  

**Customizable and Fresh Ingredients**  
Anyone who loves experimenting in the kitchen will appreciate how customizable this gadget is. I‚Äôve bought every kind of bread, cheese, and filling you can imagine, just to test it out. It‚Äôs a food lover‚Äôs playground. You‚Äôre not just limited to ‚Äúbreakfast‚Äù either; I‚Äôve whipped up pretty decent lunch sandwiches using turkey, cheddar, and leftover veggies. The nonstick cooking plates slid out effortlessly, allowing me to layer my sandwich with ease. It feels like I‚Äôve said goodbye to fast food breakfast forever.  

**Easy Cleanup**  
My least favorite part of cooking is cleaning up, so I can‚Äôt stress enough how much I appreciate the dishwasher-safe, removable components. After each use, I just pop the nonstick cooking plates into the dishwasher, and cleanup‚Äôs done. The lingering greasy mess I used to battle before? Not a problem anymore. However, because the exterior is made of plastic, you‚Äôll want to wipe it gently to avoid any accidental scratches.  

**Perks**  
- Cooks sandwiches in under five minutes.  
- Fits different types of bread: croissants, English muffins, bagels, and waffles.  
- Nonstick PFAS-free surface ensures easy food release.  
- Dishwasher-safe removable parts make cleanup effortless.  

**Areas of Concern**  
- The size limits you to one sandwich at a time, which isn‚Äôt ideal for families.  
- Meat must be precooked, adding an extra step for some users.  
- Plastic build may feel slightly flimsy to those used to more premium appliances.  

**Other Options**  
I‚Äôve checked out peers in this category, like the Dash Mini Maker and Cuisinart‚Äôs Panini Press. What I discovered is that each one serves a slightly different purpose. The Dash Mini Maker comes close to mimicking the compact efficiency of the Hamilton Beach device but doesn‚Äôt quite manage the same level of custom layer cooking. On the other hand, the Cuisinart Panini Press has its appeal with multifunctionality‚Äîit can press sandwiches and grill veggies. However, it‚Äôs bulkier and better suited if you‚Äôre cooking for multiple people. For pure breakfast sandwich convenience, though, this one remains unbeatable in terms of speed and simplicity.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
Given its performance and convenience, this sandwich maker offers great bang for your buck. Sure, it doesn‚Äôt come off as a luxury appliance, but at its price point, it doesn‚Äôt need to. It delivers consistent results, saves me time during hectic mornings, and keeps me out of the drive-thru. While there are pricier sandwich makers with better build materials, I‚Äôve genuinely found this one worth the investment for solo or small household use.

Hey everyone, I'm practically buzzing with excitement about AI automation today ‚Äì whether you love all this tech or are just a little bit skeptical, most of us agree: the future is getting way cooler (and weirder) very quickly!

Let‚Äôs stop and marvel for a sec:
- AI is now writing our emails.
- bots are running our calendars,
- Generative apps (thank you, GPT!) are even summing up our daily news while we sip morning coffee.

Here‚Äôs what gets me giddy: This isn't sci-fi anymore. AI automation is truly becoming an everyday assistant‚Äîfor home, work, education and **just about everything.**

What took hours now takes seconds.
The boring, repetitive stuff? Delegate it!  
The busywork that's eaten up productivity for decades is now, for the first time ever, something we can actually hand off‚Äîoften for free or close to it.

But here's the big ‚Äúwow‚Äù I want us to ruminate on:
**AI automation doesn‚Äôt just make things ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù It gives us TIME.**  
What will we create‚Äîwhat *can't* we create‚Äîwhen we break free from repetitive tasks?

A few bright spots already shining:
- Teachers are automating quiz creation, saving time for actual teaching.
- Startups are using AI to automate customer support and onboard clients at lightning speed.
- Creators are scheduling posts, mixing tracks, and even editing videos, all while they FOCUS on big ideas.

And the wildest part? This tech is just getting started.

Some happy thoughts I can‚Äôt ignore:
- We‚Äôre *this* close to being our best, most creative selves.
- The ‚Äúdo more with less‚Äù dream actually feels possible.

Sure, bumps will pop up‚Äîjobs will change, workflows will shift. There‚Äôs plenty to talk about when it comes to ethics and policy (we need thoughtful solutions, fast). But right now, let‚Äôs allow a little optimism to shine through:
- What could you do, imagine, or accomplish if chores and admin headaches vanished into automated bliss?

What‚Äôs the first repetitive task you‚Äôd let AI handle for you?

For now, I‚Äôd just like to connect and see where good conversations take us. I‚Äôm not here to rush anything, just hoping to meet someone genuine. If it feels right, maybe it leads to meeting up for coffee, a drink, or even a round of cheese curds.

If you‚Äôre sweet, caring, loving, and can dish out sarcasm as well as you can take it, send me a message. Worst case? We make each other smile online. Best case? We end up laughing together in person someday.

1mxb5tw,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1mxb5tw/how_the_heck_do_you_escape_executive_dysfunction/,How the heck do you escape executive dysfunction from meds?,"I‚Äôm on a 2 month furlough from my day job and my mental health has really crashed into burnout. I was on a good routine forcing myself to go to work at 2 jobs, but now that I don‚Äôt have to go anywhere I find myself sleeping in & not wanting to leave my bed. I don‚Äôt start my day until late afternoon. I just lay in bed drinking coffee all day scrolling my phone. I‚Äôm at my absolute limit for anxiety & agoraphobia, and I just quit vaping. I went off one med completely, tapering off 2 others, and about to taper off another, so I haven‚Äôt balanced out yet & im in withdrawal. I wanted these 2 months to be my time to make gains at the gym but I can barely make myself go twice a week. 

Quitting vaping just took all of my motivation and I don‚Äôt feel normal or good anymore. I have no motivation. I can‚Äôt even make myself get up to do things. 
The problem is I know taking a shower requires several steps and will take an hour, and it‚Äôs deeply unpleasant to have wet hair, so I procrastinate the shower, and I need the shower before I go to the gym. When things have to be done in a specific order with unpleasant sensations I just dread it. If I can make myself shower at night I can sometimes make myself go to the gym sooner. 
At this point I feel like I‚Äôm wasting my time off work. I have housework to do and I wanted to start painting again but I have no dopamine. I just never feel right. I‚Äôm going off an AP & I can finally feel some joy when I listen to music, but not enough. I just never reach the feeling of being ready to get up or that normal feeling where everything clicks & im satisfied with anything. 
When I eat I‚Äôm not satisfied with food at all. It‚Äôs definitely the AP depleting my dopamine, and causing food cravings & anhedonia. I hate it & I have another 3 months minimum of tapering off it. Then I start tapering off the seizure med so I‚Äôm just stuck in this rut for what could be another year going off the seizure med. I‚Äôm also going off a pain med, and a muscle relaxer by reducing the dosage. I have all of my doctors recommending I step down on meds bc my overall health is better than it has been in years. 
Im not depressed or having negative thoughts except for ptsd flashbacks here & there, I just have a mental block about doing anything besides dissociating to stop my anxiety. I have a lot of anxiety about getting ready or leaving my house with panic attacks at least twice a week so I try not to force myself or I‚Äôll go into panic. 
Quitting vaping is helping with the panic but now I just feel so blah. I can‚Äôt vape & get stimulated into getting ready or motivating myself. I can‚Äôt get pumped up to go to the gym & I have blah workouts. I‚Äôm trying protein powder but I still don‚Äôt have the energy I used to have. I‚Äôm just stuck in being emotionally drained, brain fog, and feeling like I‚Äôm drugged up enough for a nap, when it‚Äôs time for me to get my life together. I‚Äôm tapering off meds as quickly as medically possible, but now that I‚Äôm not working I just feel like I need to rest all the time & take it easy. But this isn‚Äôt the time of my life to take it easy. In another month I‚Äôll be back to work, working 3 jobs. I just keep collecting jobs to increase my income & if I don‚Äôt get things done now I‚Äôll never have time. I‚Äôm just in full burnout from working 2 jobs & taking all of these medications for so long. It feels like the weight of being drugged up will never lift.

I‚Äôm also dealing with the worst jet lag I‚Äôve ever experienced, and now that pregnancy is confirmed I‚Äôm trying to avoid coffee, while also tapering down on my lamotrigine.

Let‚Äôs call her Jenny. She was a self proclaimed server/bartender lifer who would work 3-4 serving and bartending jobs at a time
The problem is she would often find useless tasks to get out of work. She would expect me to serve all the tables while she ran around looking for gravy boats we didn‚Äôt need at all. At the first job where she was a server and I was a busser should would go smoke every thirty minutes while I would serve her tables, bus tables, restock and clean and come back and complain not enough was done.
Not having a car she would often drive me to work and I‚Äôd pay for her coffee. She would try to set me up with these jobs and u sits I imply that paid much less. 
When we worked the second job she would constantly insist I get a job at stop and shop, because they‚Äôre union (not a dig on unions). I told her thank you for the consideration, but I make way more as a server and worked retail before and hated it. A few times she insisted to drive me and tried to drive me there and make me fill out an application. I said no and she pulled into the parking lot and told me I needed to fill one out now. I walked in and walked out and said I‚Äôll apply online. 
Over the coming weeks she continued to bring up stop and shop and how they‚Äôre union. I finally told her every time I go in everyone their looks miserable and I hate retail. Why would I work somewhere where everyone is miserable. She never got it and continued to push stop and shop until she quit.

1mxb0vd,https://i.redd.it/62r5d79vjlkf1.jpeg,Advice Needed (Cyclical Cushings?),"Been feeling a bit off for some time now. Starting every Thursday morning, i wake up and i feel absolutely terrible. I look at myself in the mirror and im not even seeing the same person, i have massive dark bags under my eyes, my face is pale and bloated - i feel and look terrible. My stomach is bloated, im around 15% bf with visible able so I can clearly see when I have a little pouch out of nowhere. I have awful brain fog, im so fatigued, almost dizzy in a way, I‚Äôm in a terrible mood, cant think and can barely focus on anything. Im super anxious (normally very calm with no anxiety), and overthink a ton - i literally feel like i wanna hide in a dark room for these 2 days. Also when Thursday starts the gut issues begin, nausea, indigestion, loose stools and a bit of acid reflux. Now remember, when I say I have all these symptoms, the days leading up to Thursday and Friday i feel great. I feel like myself, sharp, focused, energized, less anxiety/overthinking, mood is stable, gut feels good, i feel hydrated, i feel sexually healthy. Now let‚Äôs continue, on Thursday I feel incredibly dehydrated, my mouth is dry, my skin is dry, and I actually have a weird taste in my mouth (could be because it‚Äôs so dry?; not sure). No amount of water, salt, electrolytes help this. I also have ZERO libido, the desire/want to have sex is 0% (my total T ranges anywhere from 900-1000). My joints are sore, working out  on Thursday and Friday are brutal, my joints ache and I simply just don‚Äôt feel strong. I actually feel much weaker on those days. Last thing I noticed recently is my right lymph node under my jaw is swollen - my neck also feels swollen along with my face, no idea what this could mean; Infection? Virus? Not a clue. And guys let me just say again, there‚Äôs no amount of working out, sweating, sunlight, water, electrolytes, coffee, walking/ etc. that helps. There‚Äôs nothing I can do that even TOUCHES these symptoms or lessens them at all. And believe me, I‚Äôve tried all the simple stuff.

Ok so now here‚Äôs the kicker, Saturday mid morning rolls around ‚Ä¶ poof symptoms are gone. Quality of sleep was great, face and stomach de bloat, eye bags/circles are gone, the color of my skin comes back to normal , much less anxiety, mood is stable gut issues stabilize, i feel hydrated and happy and my libido spikes back.. i feel like me again. This has literally happened cycle after cycle for months and months and months. I know it sounds crazy but is happened to me every week for years now. 

Posting my latest blood draw as well. My functional medicine doctor didn‚Äôt seem to worry too much about the high cortisol but I feel like if I can pin point what‚Äôs going on, it HAS to be somewhat cortisol related.

1mxayxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/1mxayxd/is_a_3_wheeler_bike_good_for_daily_use/,Is a 3 Wheeler Bike Good for Daily Use?,"So, I‚Äôve been seeing more and more people riding a 3 wheeler bike around town lately, and I‚Äôm low-key tempted to join the club. They look stable, comfortable, and a little bit like something Batman would ride if he was on a coffee run. But here‚Äôs the big question I keep asking myself; are they actually good for daily use?   
  
From what I‚Äôve gathered, there are actually pros and cons. On the plus side, a 3 wheeler bike is perfect if you hate balancing in traffic or if your knees have filed for early retirement. You get more stability, extra storage space, and they‚Äôre surprisingly comfortable on long rides. I literally see it being ideal for grocery runs, commuting to work, or even weekend trips without stressing about tipping over at stoplights.   
  
On the flip side, they‚Äôre usually slower, wider (which makes parking a whole drama), and if you‚Äôre in a city with aggressive traffic, weaving between cars is pretty much impossible.   
  
If you‚Äôre thinking of getting one, I saw some affordable models on Alibaba with different engine sizes, from sporty ones to cargo-friendly versions. They may be worth checking out if you want to test the lifestyle without breaking the bank.
