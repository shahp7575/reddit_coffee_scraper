Some of my interests include art, astronomy, marine/diving, literature, music, philosophy, some D&D and video games, and different kinds of sports. 

I love metal and metal subgenres and like attending concerts. I’ve only recently gotten back into it but I’ve truly missed being out there. Some of my favorite bands include Sleep Token, Architects, While She Sleeps, and more. I generally like music. If the mood takes me I also listen to ‘Jazz in the Background’. Love sharing playlists and new discoveries. 

I can talk about almost anything and don’t mind discussing deep topics such as mental health. I’m agnostic, veggie and straight-edge (I do drink on rare occasions and I like coffee). Also on the path of detoxing from social media, but I wouldn’t mind having more people to talk to (or even go to concerts with).

Excited to be making my first post here. I just wanted to create a thread that will help both splitters and strong applicants alike improve their chances of getting admitted to their dream schools.

When it comes to padding your application and presenting yourself in the best way possible to admission committees, I'm a true believer in ""going the extra mile"" to better paint one's stories. This is why I am sparing no effort in researching ideas that will help better present a case to schools. Here are a list of items that are floating through my head as I type this...

\+ Highest Possible LSAT (this one is too obvious)  
\+ Solid Personal Statement (another no-brainer) and Addendum (for the splitters)  
\+ Unique & Rare Achievements (Forbes 30 Under 30 Alumni, Winning a Prestigious Award, Olympic Athlete, Military Special Operations, etc. GET CREATIVE!)  
\+ Highlighting 1-3 RECENT Publications (if any)  
\+ Connecting Offline / Having ""Coffee Chats"" / Building Network (whether it be with admissions committee for application process help or law school faculty to seek mentors)  
\+ Veteran Status (please don't enlist for the sole purpose of adding this to your application)  
\+ Pursuing Post-Undergrad Studies (Master's, Certs, etc) and Performing Well  
\+ Significant Community Service Engagement (especially with activities that empower DEI principles)  
\+ Develop Professional Online Presence (LinkedIn for days and maybe even your own personal professional website)  
\+ Getting an Internship in the Legal Field  
\+ Participating in Debate Competitions  
\+ Attending Law School Workshops that are given/hosted by your Dream Schools

Deciding to get back into coffee drinking after ~8 years off. Had a very basic machine, probably Mr. Coffee, with programmable start time. Loved it until I got randomly sick the same morning I had a cup of coffee and [conditioned taste aversion] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditioned_taste_aversion) kicked in. 

Looking to add a fancier coffee maker to my Christmas wishlist and have narrowed down to Behmor (Bunn Heat N Brew is the 2nd choice/basic option, and I know both were SCAA rated at one point). I watched [James’ video] (https://youtu.be/t8eYs2vxT-8?si=3yRgnaVWph2NvbAL) which was incredibly helpful. I consider myself a basic drinker but am interested in exploring specialty (decaf) coffees. I would be the only coffee drinker in the house, with one other person *occasionally* drinking along. 

I’m looking for a good quality machine that makes a consistent cup and doesn’t break the bank—even though I’m not the buyer. Realistically, I will drink on the weekends only as I don’t like taking drinks other than water on the go. 

1. Can the Behmor handle a small batch? Say 1-2 (3 maybe) ~8oz cups? 

2. I know it doesn’t have an espresso function, but could I adjust the amount of coffee grounds for a stronger brew and make something close to iced coffee, latte, cafe au lait? Or would I really need an espresso function? At minimum I add sugar and a tiny bit of creamer (sometimes a lot for childhood nostalgia) but want to explore drinking coffee more stripped down/pure.

1gtw8rq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1gtw8rq/aitah_for_not_texting_my_friend_reminding_her_of/,AITAH for not texting my friend reminding her of my birthday dinner?,"I (22F) just had my birthday on November 15. My friend group consists of five people: Friend A (24F), Friend B (24F), Friend C (22F), Friend D (26F), and me. I’ve known Friend A the longest—she was my best friend before I introduced her to the others. However, this past year, we've drifted apart, and while I’ve made efforts to reconnect (texting more, inviting her to hang out), she’s been distant, often replying dryly or ghosting me. Recently, I’ve been giving her space.

The Sunday before my birthday, I ran into Friend A at a local coffee shop. I told her I was planning a birthday dinner on Saturday and invited her, mentioning that my brothers and mom would be there and that the rest of the group was invited. She said “oh I don’t know. I’m probably busy this weekend but I’ll let you know.” I took that as disinterest because she didn’t seem enthusiastic and her tone was frankly very cold. So I didn’t follow up.

Saturday night, I had the dinner, which was really fun. Friend B, C, and D came over for drinks afterward, but Friend A never texted or showed up. About two hours into the hangout, B started acting distant—she was on her phone a lot and seemed quiet. Eventually, she snapped at me and left abruptly. Afterward, I walked out to her car to check if I had done something wrong. She told me she was upset because A had said I didn’t invite her to the party.
Confused, I texted A, asking if I had done something to upset her. She responded the next morning, saying she was ""confused why everyone was at my house"" and that she saw us on SnapMap. I asked her what she meant and why she hadn’t come if she had known we were all there. She said I never clarified that she was invited, which was news to me since I specifically told her she was invited.
I called A to explain the situation. I reminded her of our conversation at the coffee shop and how she said she was unsure if she’d come. She got defensive, saying I should have texted her again to confirm and made sure she came. She accused me of being a bad friend for not reminding her and said I was bitter. She also claimed this was why the group had been hanging out without me lately. She hung up on me after calling me a “bitch.”
I feel confused. I definitely invited her, and I didn’t think I needed to chase after her to confirm she would attend, especially since she said she would let me know. Now, I’m wondering if I should have followed up more, but I didn’t expect her to be upset by it.
So, am I in the wrong for not double-checking with her, am I the asshole?

So this is going to take some explanation, i am in a homeschool drama group, we have an older cast and a younger cast, both preforming different shows, but on the same night, there are 4 show nights, i just moved up to the older cast this year and they have smash bros in the dressing room. Okay now into the story

Night 1: they tell us that we can sit in the bleachers in the back during the younger casts show, i do, i go upstairs into the dressing room to get water and i see some of my friends (quietly) playing smash bros, not disrupting the show downstairs, i think, ‘oh cool, an adult probably said we can hang out up here.’ I start playing with them, ms A. comes in and tells us to go downstairs to watch the show, i do.

Night 2: events proceed as before i go up again and the are playing smash bros again, i figured that because we saw it last night we were okay to be up here so i hung out and then we got told off again, i went downstairs again.

Night 3: we were specifically told in the greenroom by mr B. to go upstairs and hang out, we do. Ms A. tells us that there is a small audience tonight and they need more applause so we go down again.

Night 4: mr B. tells us in the green room that there is a long line of people outside. I think, okay so last night we got sent down because of the smaller audience, so if we already have a long line it should be fine. So i go up to ms C.
 and ask if i can go up to hang out in the dressing room and she say we are heavily encouraged to stay down here but she didnt say no so i went up again (ik i should have taken a hunt here but i was running off of a few hours if sleep a night and a cup of coffee because show week) Ms A. said this time she was going to put this in write this down so next time we audition they woukd se that we ‘dont listen to instructions’ (even though i was using a combination of reason and what we were told to do and every time i was told to go downstairs i did and didnt come back up)

I expressed to the midlevel that I feel I’m not fit for the client and I could not keep up (especially the days they had coffee or 4 popsicles for breakfast).  
I had no CPI training and this kid would punch, slap bite and scream at the top of their lungs so loud my hands would be shaking. When I showed the midlevel how I was blocking the hits I asked if I was even doing it right and she said no but training for cpi will be soon(it was 5 months after I left the client). I felt like I was failing with no support or positive reinforcement on my end from my midlevel or BCBA. I stuck it out with this client for 5 months and was so exhausted at this point, parents weren’t implementing the PT training and still reinforcing the maladaptive behavior. I started to feel so depressed going into work or thinking about work. I couldn’t even enjoy my weekends it was a nightmare. 
I texted my Midlevel asking how I can improve or what I needed to do and possibly that me and this client aren’t a good match and I can’t keep up. She brought in the new hire BCBA and they basically asked if I wanted to stick with this job.i always felt guilty about leaving this case and wondered what I could of done to strengthen my skills in this position. The same midlevel told me last week that the client was great and had so much improvement. 
Jump to 5 months later I overhear that this client has had 4 BTs, and one of the BTs quit because of the intensity of the client. The midlevel was going through a divorce at the time so I’m sure this took some kind of effect on the situation. The family had a charge for domestic violence and the parents are now going through a divorce. The company has had a recent meeting offering more pay for high intensity clients and for two BTs to be in the home for those cases.

[REQUEST],"Sometimes when I'm stressed at work and on my coffee break, I want to listen to a quick ASMR video- but the problem I find is that a lot of the shorter videos (ideal would be like 3-5 minutes, 10 minutes max) tend to be more aggressive and fast-paced, which is sort of counterproductive to what I actually need in that circumstance.

She just moved here from another state, we have similar goals. I developed feelings, we met up for coffee a week later and then spent 4 months talking on instagram. No flirting but a lot of career stuff, movies and planning to hang out on my end.

Now, to put it simply i had my suspicions that she had someone this whole time but there was no evidence on social media and she never mentioned having someone!

We finally met up a couple weeks ago. I was excited because I made plans for a movie and then she changed it so we go where she works instead - a dine in theater. It was nice, we saw a rom-com. We looked nice and I was happy to see her again.

Now we've talked about other plans as well and she's always been down for it. Including a rooftop movie and amusement park. I felt it was a good time to ask about her facebook, and so she added me today and thats where it seemed more clear to me that yeah, she's still with this guy. Engaged and all. They've known each other since they were kids...

But why didnt she tell me? Why did she agree to hang out with me at a dine-in theater? We could've made other plans that seemed less romantic.

i had my hopes up cause i really liked her. So im a little sad. We still have plans to meet up, like this week she might take pictures of me for some headshots i need. But after that, i might have to really think about it :/

if anything, we'll remain colleagues and friends as we are in the same profession but dang, we click so well man...

Extra: tbh, about 3 months ago she hid me from seeing her instagram stories. i have no idea why. I alluded to it the other day, and even said im sorry if i did anything to upset her but she was clueless. I have her on facebook now and i can see her stories again. She told me earlier she was gonna be out of town this weekend. But in reality, her fiance came to visit and they went to a football game (she's told me before when her sister was visiting but not her fiance?) whatever, it sucks, but better to know this now than have possibly made it worse. For example, I could've made things awkward if i admitted my feelings. im gonna take a step back, focus on myself, get better now that im freeing myself from pursuing her. not chasing after a girl who's engaged lol",2,1731901058.0,AskMenAdvice,11,1.0,False

Cyclist was waiting at a stop sign on Beacon and the clown in the Dodge pickup decides to be ""nice"" and let the cyclist go.  Note the cars behind the Dodge (particularly the white Subaru) hitting the brakes fairly hard in response.  I caught a glimpse of the cyclist starting to go at about 0:06 seconds and started slowing down just in case, Sure enough, there goes the cyclist, coffee in hand, who can't see me due to the line of cars behind the Dodge.  Bonus points for the vehicles starting to go and a family (with KID!) who decide they are also going to walk across the street.

People in Boise need to start following the rules of the road.  A bike at an intersection should be treated the same as car!  Do not stop and impede traffic to allow pedestrians to cross unless there is a crosswalk or other traffic control that gives the pedestrian the right of way.  For the love of EVERYONE's health and safety, do not stop to try and ""be nice"" while driving.  Follow the laws of the road and be predictable.

And to the cyclist, for the love of gears, learn how to downshift before you come to a stop.  You'll find you can get riding faster and get that Dutch Bros down your gullet sooner.

The Trampoline Park shouldn’t have had a jukebox in the first place. 



It is once again November. The rain falls hard on a humdrum Hermitage. Lakewood, if we’re being specific. I’m peering out from under an umbrella at the brick facade of the Trampoline Park and trying to deduce whether it used to be a Food Lion or an IGA. We shouldn’t judge structures by their previous contents, I’ve decided. Besides, today is not about me. It’s about my niece Rosie. Today is her seventh birthday. I bought her a jewelry making kit and wrapped it in the least Christmas-looking paper that I could find. Her birthday is dangerously close to the celebratory black hole of the holidays. She isn’t yet old enough to know about the birthday doldrums and I adore that about her.   



Trampoline parks are a series of minor indignities. One must sign an extensive waiver. One must wear colorful socks with jellied bits on the soles. One must wander across sticky floors while the Top 40 blares from dusty speakers. There are signs everywhere warning about serious injury or death. None of these signs seem to slow anyone in my family down. 



My brother-in-law, *Hyde*, Rosie’s father, is bouncing around in the trampoline dodgeball court. He is absolutely drilling boy after boy in the head with dodgeballs. 



“Booyah, A.J.! Get good!” He yelled at a seven-year-old. He is wearing a Jeff Gordon T-shirt that at one point in his life fit him properly. I watched from a safe distance. A few older kids were trying to get him out but he was by far the oldest and strongest child in the arena. 



Our sweet Rosie broke me free from my stupor and yanked me toward an enormous ball pit. She pointed up at a ninja ropes course that was crawling with children. They were struggling to make it a third of the way across before falling into an odorous sea of plastic balls. 



“Uncle Hector! Climb the ropes!” Rosie screamed at me. I hesitantly took my place at the edge of the dais, stretched my shoulders, and jumped onto the ninja course. 



The children howled and screamed as every muscle in my body failed within seconds. As my world shrunk to nothing I was invigorated from a distance. It was a song. An unusual minor hit from long ago. *It couldn’t be.* I decided that I wasn’t fooling anyone and let go.



As I emerged emasculated from the ball pit I placed the song as *“William, It Was Really Nothing”* by the Smiths. There was no way that this song was the natural product of an algorithm. It was too rare. The children pelted me with plastic balls of disdain as I left the course. I identified a single suspect in the crime of “playing Morrissey in public” as I schlepped away in my crappy gel socks. 



Lurking by the jukebox was indeed the Austin Peay junior, suburban sad boy, and the only person I know (other than you) that smokes (or has ever smoked) clove cigarettes. You know him, Cecilia: my cousin *Chasten Fogg*. 



Chasten was vigorously texting. A new song had begun: *Heaven or Las Vegas* by the Cocteau Twins. The vibe in the trampoline park was shifting in the wrong direction. Parents were looking around and closing their body language.  



“You’re playing a dangerous game.” I told Chasten as I approached. He gave a practiced flip of his bangs and covered his mouth as if only to show off the faded X on the back of his hand. 



“I can’t believe this thing has Cocteau Twins.” he giggled to himself. 



“You can’t play Cocteau Twins in front of people from Gladeville. It’s too risky.” I said. 



“I paid the money.” he sassed me. 



“Democracy in action, I guess.” I said. Seconds later Hyde came marching over. He was sweaty from his dodgeball campaign. Hyde sized us up and snorted. 



“Couple a bitches.” he said. 



“One overweight jerkoff.” I fired back. 



“I figured y’all’d be the ones conjugatin by the jukebox.” Hyde said. I pointed at his shirt. 



“I’m getting you a Bobby Labonte jacket for Christmas so you don’t keep embarrassing yourself with that thing.” I told him. 



“Jeff Gordon sucks.” Chasten added. Hyde scoffed. 



“Speakin a sucks. How’s y’alls football team? Y’even got one?”



“Let’s go Peay.” I interrupted. Hyde chuckled. 



“Ya got that goin for ya. Good comedy line. Step aside. I’m fixin to put on some real music.” Hyde said. 



“Lee Greenwood?” Chasten suggested.



“Morgan fuckin Wallen. Read the room, jits.” Hyde said.



“A room’s about all you can read.” I said. Hyde flipped us off and returned to the dodgeball court. 



I then had a brief episode of deja vu. It was the memory of a confusing dream that you and I had once discussed as we walked down a frosty Leopold Street. We took our ceramic coffee cups out with us on our walk. I was a child playing alone in a massive, dark, indoor playground. I felt an inexorable loneliness, wanting to leave yet wanting to stay. You just snickered and shook your head at me. You couldn’t believe that I wasn’t able to make sense of that. *It’s so obvious,* you said. *I don’t dream of anyone except myself*, Cecilia. 



I pulled out my billfold and found several crisp bills. 



“Stay right here.” I told Chasten. I strolled over to the concession stand and pulled in both the manager and the teenage employee. It took some convincing but they eventually understood the assignment. I then went to the jukebox and furthered my offensive. 



I rolled my shoulders and pulled Chasten close. In his ear I deposited one of your favorite sayings:



“Battles take minutes; wars take lifetimes.”



For a split second I saw your smile, Cecilia; your lips drawing back to reveal teeth, your bowstring drawn tight. Your maxi skirts and freckles. You were so goddamn weird. I drew another breath and said,



“This battle will last 15 minutes and 32 seconds.”



“Ladies and gentleman, a generous jumper has paid for fifteen minutes of free slushies for all kids in the park today, starting right now!” the manager winced as he announced over the intercom. Children stopped in their tracks and searched the air for the scent of cherry and blueberry. 



I clapped Chasten’s shoulder and turned to the gathering mob of first graders at the slurpee bar. I had paid four not-so-hard-earned American dollars to play *Sk8er Boi* four times in a row on the jukebox. Hyde would be on the hook for 55 slurpees. *A rapid-fire drum fill and…*



The trampoline park exploded with energy. 



Hyde slowly looked across the ninja course and met eyes with me. I already had my middle finger up. The children bubbled into a dancing mob as the Avril Lavigne song hit the chorus. Rosie’s eyes were wide as she screamed at me:



“DOUBLE BLUEBERRY AND COKE, UNCLE HECTOR!” 



I jumped over the counter and started helping the staff fill drinks. The teenage employee was incredibly confused. I am also confused by the things that I orchestrate when invigorated by a petty grievance. I shook cold blue froth from my hands and squeezed lid after plastic lid on sugar-filled paper cups before handing them to vibrating children. 



You still rock my world, Cecilia.



Yours,

Hector Fogg

I glanced over at Ellen, my half-sister, who stood by his side. She didn’t even try to hide her satisfaction. It wasn’t enough that she had taken him from me, my own husband. Now, she stood there, eager to watch me break.  
  
I was trying to keep my emotions in check. I had just buried my grandmother— my only source of comfort. And now, just hours later, Ezekiel wanted me to sign away the life we had built together, as if it had meant nothing.  
  
“You couldn’t even wait until tomorrow?” I asked, my voice shaking despite my efforts to sound strong. “Today of all days, Ezekiel?”  
  
He didn’t flinch. His expression remained unreadable, his eyes hard. “This has to happen, Kamille. There’s no point in dragging it out.”  
  
My chest tightened. Just months ago we had been talking about our future, our family. But how could I even bring up our future when he had destroyed it the moment he chose her? The betrayal ran deep, cutting through me like a knife, but what Ezekiel didn’t know—what neither of them knew—was that I was carrying his child!  
  
I had found out a few weeks ago. The nausea, the fatigue, the overwhelming emotions all made sense when the pregnancy test showed positive. I had thought about telling him, but every time I tried, the image of him with Ellen flashed in my mind, and the words died in my throat. How could I raise this child with a man who had chosen my own sister over me?  
  
“Kamille,” Ezekiel said, his voice lower now, as if he thought being softer would help. “Sign the papers.”  
  
I shook my head slightly, my eyes moving from the papers back to him. He didn’t deserve to know about the baby. He didn’t deserve to be a part of this child’s life after what he had done. But the thought of raising a child alone terrified me.

Rajat is also fed up of this, still Karan comes to defend Shilpa by fighting with Rajat and making personal attacks.

Why is Karan so scared to leave Shilpa? Is it bcoz Chum is close to Shilpa so he is trying to be cordial to her despite everything? Even his friend told him in confession room that nobody is his family in the house and Shilpa herself betrayed him in the Time God thing so why is he on a guilt trip for not helping Shilpa become Time God. Instead of being Honest.

His fans are happy that he is fighting with Rajat. Actually, they shud be sad that he is fighting with someone who has been trying to make him realize the Snake Shilpa he is attached to. He is fighting with the wrong person.

Why the hell does he want the validation or support from Shilpa? Biggest mistake of Karan was to admit that he used to be jealous of Vivian.

# It Started With a YouTube Video (Because Don't All Bad Decisions?)

Picture this: There I was, mindlessly scrolling through YouTube, probably avoiding actual work, when some tech wizard decides to show me how to turn an old laptop into a server. ""Who needs a server at home?"" I scoffed, like some peasant who hadn't yet seen the light. Then I discovered the Arr-stack, and suddenly I transformed into a data-hoarding gremlin faster than you can say ""containerization.""

# The ""My Laptop Can Handle It"" Delusion

Armed with an i3 3110M laptop (basically a calculator with a screen), I embarked on my journey. This magnificent piece of antiquity had all the processing power of a caffeinated hamster on a wheel. But did that stop me? Of course not! I installed Docker because apparently, I enjoy watching hardware cry.

Fun fact: Trying to stream 1080p on this setup was like asking a potato to solve quantum physics. 4K? The laptop would literally display a tiny white flag emoji and surrender.

# ChatGPT: My Digital Enabler

When my setup started showing signs of imminent death, I did what any reasonable person would do: consulted an AI. Because who better to give life advice than a language model that's never actually touched a server? ChatGPT, in its infinite wisdom (read: sadistic humor), suggested I try Proxmox.

Me: ""That sounds complicated.""

ChatGPT: ""It's fine, trust me.""

Narrator: ""It was not, in fact, fine.""

# The ""I'm Basically a Data Center Engineer Now"" Phase

The plan was beautiful in its simplicity: Just install Proxmox, set up Windows with GPU passthrough, add Ubuntu server with integrated GPU passthrough, configure networking, set up storage, manage virtualization, implement backup solutions, and sacrifice my firstborn to the tech gods. You know, basic stuff.

My gaming PC (i7 9700K and 2070S) went from running Cyberpunk 2077 to running multiple VMs. It's like buying a Ferrari and using it to deliver pizzas, but hey, at least my Plex server can transcode faster than my self-esteem can plummet.

# The Daily Crisis Schedule

# Adventures in Self-Lockout

Remember that time I installed pfSense and managed to lock myself out? It's like changing the locks on your house while you're still inside, except worse because you can't even call a locksmith. You just sit there, staring at your network equipment, wondering if carrier pigeons are still a viable communication method.

# The Ubuntu Awakening

Somewhere between my fifteenth system restart and twentieth cup of coffee, I discovered that Ubuntu Desktop isn't actually the final boss of Linux distros. It's more like that friend who seems intimidating until you realize they're just as awkward as you are.

# Current Status: Successfully Failing Upwards

Now I can spin up containers faster than I can explain to my family why I need seventeen different servers running in our house. The electricity bill has skyrocketed, my room sounds like a jet engine, and I've memorized more IP addresses than phone numbers.

# Words of Wisdom for Future Victims

If you're thinking about starting your own homelab journey, remember:

* Docker is like Tetris for masochists
* Your first pfSense configuration will definitely lock you out
* RAM is like potato chips - you can never have just one (stick)
* The moment you think you've fixed everything is exactly when your system will catch fire (metaphorically... usually)",1,1731900671.0,homelab,0,1.0,False

1gtvgxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PrestigiousCount1792/comments/1gtvgxp/the_guide_to_ai/,The Guide to AI,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is everywhere—your phone’s assistant, Netflix recommendations, even self-driving cars. But how does it actually work?

**💡What is AI?**  
AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the overarching idea of machines mimicking human abilities, such as decision-making, learning, or problem-solving. AI can do this because it uses **models**, which are mathematical systems trained to solve specific problems. These models learn how to respond by identifying patterns in data.

**💡The Layers of AI**

1️⃣ Basic AI: The Rule-Follower

This is like a beginner barista who follows strict recipes from a manual. For example, if you order a cappuccino, they always give you the same coffee with the exact same foam-to-milk ratio.

* **How it works:** Pre-defined rules or algorithms.
* **Limitations:** It can’t handle new or unexpected orders.
* **Example:** Spam filters in email or basic calculators.

2️⃣ Machine Learning (ML)

Machine Learning is when the barista stops relying on recipes and starts learning from data—like observing customer preferences over time.

* **How it works:** The model trains on data to predict or classify new inputs.
* **Example:** Predicting house prices, classifying emails as spam, or suggesting products on Amazon.

The classical types of machine learning:

1. **Supervised Learning: Training with Labels**
   * The algorithm learns by example. You provide labeled data:
      * Input: “Latte”
      * Output: “Espresso + Milk”
   * Over time, they understand that specific inputs correspond to specific outputs.
   * **Use Cases:** Predicting stock prices, diagnosing diseases, or image recognition.
2. **Unsupervised Learning: Discovering Patterns**
   * No labels here! The algorithm figures out patterns on its own.
   * **Use Cases:** Customer segmentation, fraud detection, or recommendation engines.

3️⃣ Deep Learning (DL)

Deep learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning, which is a subset of artificial intelligence. It is concerned with algorithms that can learn to recognize patterns in data, whereas machine learning is more general and deals with algorithms that can learn any kind of task.

* **How it works:** Deep learning models are built using **neural networks**, inspired by the human brain. These networks can process vast amounts of data and learn complex patterns.
* **Example:** Voice assistants, facial recognition, or language translation.

💡**AI Models**

Here are a few AI models:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Trees**
4. **Neural Networks**
5. **Large Language Models (LLM)**
6. **Linear Discriminant Analysis**
7. **Naive Bayes**
8. **Support Vector Machines**
9. **Learning Vector Quantization**
10. **K-nearest Neighbors**
11. **Random Forest**

We were roommates for two years and had a lot of fun together and became supper close during our time as roomies. After graduating, I noticed they became closer and I was drifting away. We hung out a couple times, the 3 of us and I would notice that I would feel the odd one out. I don’t want to say that they did that on purpose or to be malicious. I truly believe it just happened on its own so I came to an acceptance of the whole situation. Rather than cutting them off immediately, I decided to distance myself just to see if they would reach out to me, since I’m usually the one to reach out to them first. 

Months go by and I don’t hear a single peep. Sure, they could’ve been busy but I always saw their social media posts of them hanging out together. They clearly didn’t want me there. 

In the fall last year, we had made plans to hang out and I can’t put my finger on it but something about this hangout gave me a bad feeling. Which is odd because they weren’t doing anything to make me feel that way, but I felt anxious which never happened before, so I bailed. I sent a message a few days prior telling them I couldn’t make it. 

A couple months later, I got engaged to the loml and my sister threw me an engagement party. I told her all the friends I wanted there, and she did the rest. When it came down to who I wanted there, I debated with myself on whether or not I wanted to invite them. I later came to the decision that I didn’t want them there since it takes me always reaching out for them to acknowledge me.

The engagement party happened and it was a small dinner with coffee and cake and I had so much fun! The morning after I gathered all the photos that were taken and posted about my engagement on instagram. Tbh, I didn’t think they were gonna see it bc they were hardly on social media if I remember correctly. But not long after the post was made, I got a message in the group chat from one of the girls. The message was “Um”. I wasn’t expecting a congratulations but I also wasn’t expecting an “Um” either and nothing else was said so I just didn’t respond. Not sure if that was the best thing to do but that’s what happened. I mean how do you respond to that anyway? From what I interpreted it as, it did seem that maybe they were disappointed that they weren’t invited.

A week later, I made the decision to cut them off without saying anything. There was no last straw moment that made me feel the need to do that but I just couldn’t be friends with them anymore. My friendship with them wasn’t the same since graduating. I constantly felt excluded even during the times I hung out with them and the whole friendship just felt one sided. 

They noticed that I had removed them and reached out asking if everything was okay and why I removed them. I do find it odd that they decided to check in on me AFTER I removed them. It did take me a day or two to respond but honestly I didn’t know what to say. I said that had been feeling left out and felt the friendship wasn’t the same. I got a super long reply where one of them called me immature for cutting them off without saying anything and yet they messaged with an “Um” after viewing my post.

It’s been a year now and for some reason, I feel bad about it all but i definitely don’t plan on trying to reach out. I don’t regret the decision I made of not wanting to be friends with them anymore. But I can imagine that they must have been really upset for what I did.

By no means am I a coffee aficionado, but it sometimes bewilders me when the coffee pods I buy for the first time taste awful in the store sample and so much better when I bring it home. Seems like it should be the other way around.

I went to highschool with this girl ""Mia"". We never knew eachother. Years later we're in a big city with my HS friends, ""Jay"" and ""Boo"" and our newer friend of a year ""Ra"". Mia's last relationship is over, she threw a party. We all go over it was great. She had a thing with a guy at the time, and gets reallly drunk. Her and B kiss for a second while hes there secretly. Eventually we hung out a few more times in groups, Boo wants her just to fuck but nothing comes of it. Around 3-4 casual meetings later Mia and I sparked heavy. We went on a date the next week and it was incredible we had soo much to connect over and spent all night together. She went in saying she doesnt want one night stands, that night changed and she wanted to f\*\*\* and I didn't let her break it. That friday we all went out and I was nervous B learnt about us, I told him directly that we have been talking. He was looking forward trying to f\*\*\* her but than said ""You guys are cute"" after seeing us together all night. We slept and hung out all day and she asked me to come out to an event with her but I took the time to myself. 

  
Now it gets worse. 2 days later I was with Ra and Jay at Ra's place drinking, I was texting Mia and said she could come over as she was drunk again and her friends were going home. I picked her up, brought her to my friend Ra's place. She asked me on text to sober her up. I got her water. Ra saw how drunk she was, persuaded her into another shot and offered her a cigarette. Mia was sitting on my lap and we were all cutesy kissing etc basically falling for eachother. Ra took the opportunity when I said im not smoking to convince her ""come on come on come smoke"". I watched from the couch with no worries and saw him staring at her ass and then try to flirt with her. He previously in those 3-4 casual hangouts also tried to flirt with her aggressively and one night we were all hanging til 6am until she asked him to leave as she was sleepy, she said i could stay for a bit, but i went home for context. I knew he wanted to as all men but I thought it was over now that we were 'together'. Ra convinced Mia while she was really drunk and smoking a cigg about 10 feet from me and said 'lets go to the room' right in front of me and they walked by me and he locked the room door. He kissed her in the room. I was just watching this unfold on the couch shocked with my friend Jay. This was a place I invited her to, a safe space, with my 2 best friends and the girl I was sparking with. I wasn't going to just sit there or leave so I banged on the door. He opened it with her on the bed, and lied and said ""Why u look mad, nothing happened"" , she came out and was flustered and walked out of the house when I questioned what the fuck just happened. She told me to get my stuff when I was visibly upset trying to ask her ""wtf was that"" and he kept saying instantly ""nothing happened nothing happened"". She instantly told me they kissed. We had a chaotic night of trying to talk, being upset, being happy and trying to communicate. I said ""that sucked, we cant do all the things we talked about"" and she was all ""we cannn im sorry that was so shit"". I asked her if she'd been thinking about me romantically because we obviously were going in that direction, and she said 'yess obviously'. I said ""i wish you didnt do that"". That night ended and we both were miserable through the next week, we didn't talk and both felt horrible about it. A week later Boo who pecked her weeks ago when we all just met and 'wants to fuck her so bad' as he said, found out from Jay and made plans with Ra to go to his. They invited Mia over who was overwhelmed and passed on it. They disrespected me, failed to check up, and take any accountability. So Boo seemed to be mad that we ended up having a fling and harbour his want for sex on this even when he said he was happy we were sparking. Right after Ra did that to me, Boo, who I was friends with for 7 years and went to school with, chose to enable Ra's behaviour who we met together about a year ago. They persuaded another girl to treat me like shit thats our friend and invite Mia as a disguise so Boo could try get with her next. It was a game, a gimmick. I treasure this girls heart but ill leave that part out. Just trust in our connection and intentions. Mia didn't go but hearing they were all together disgusted me and they finally invited me over maybe to reconcile wanting me to just forgive Ra but all he did was gaslight me and they all turned on me for nothing, other than Jay who was at home. They were blaming and slandering Mia a bit so I messaged her at 1am saying ""theyre still just blaming you""

  
The next day Mia said ""I dont know what to say anymore"", we met up for lunch, had an amazing conversation and rather than harbour resentment she was really vulnerable about where she was, showed genuine empathy and respect for me. So i forgave her, we had a lovely day and watched tv, cuddled and talked about ourselves. She revealed a lot to me and I told her I get jealous and it really hurt. She squeezed me and said she'd never do something like that again. I didn't want to accept how wronged I was after so much genuine beauty with such a soft amazingly communicative and endearing person, so I LET IT GO COMPLETELY, against my ego and my heart. Mia and I started seeing eachother and we'd text and make LOTS of plans for the future. It got very intense really quick and I fell for her hard. She would text the cutest stuff saying ""your girl"" ""come cuddle"" etc kinda energy and I gave her pure pure pure positivity. The next time we hungout I told her those guys were trouble, probably made me look week, and that there was still beef as they were hanging out with Ra. The next time I was with Mia we slept together and i was pretty high and at 5am she suddenly said ""would you be mad if i kicked you out"" after i told her ""i reallyyyy like you:)!"" and I kind of got sad and we cuddled so I thought she wanted us to wake up together. We woke up, she got ready for the gym, we made plans to go shopping. I went home. She went shopping and texted me ""im going now!"" I was too tired and skipped. She got anxious bc of her meds and I told her ""noo i got you"", and was definitely just being protective. I got drunk that night and texted her I wanted to see her and called her since I was in her area again. She said ""im taking the night to myself!"", the next day i texted ""urgh i wanted you so bad"" thinking maybe she'd be happy knowing that given the last time we were together I was less physical and she was very very pushy. Then on monday she ended it saying she was ""uncomfortable with my reaction to the Ra situation"" even though I did THE BEST, gave her time understanding and SHE WRONGED ME. and that it was ""unhealthy for her"", which it wasnt perfect but goddamn was it SOOO unhealthy for me. Now were meeting for coffee and I dont know how to approach it. A connection beyond explaining worth pursuing where everything syncs except her actions and my reactions.

Today I want to talk to you about a small change I made recently, which I think has helped me improve my confidence a lot, that is - wearing height-enhancing shoes!

To be honest, I have always been a little bit timid about my height. Every time I go to a party or a date, I always feel that I am shorter and a little unsure when I see my friends around me who are tall and thin. Although I know that ""confidence comes from within"", when you stand in front of a group of tall people, you will still feel a little disappointed.

Recently, I decided to try height-enhancing shoes, thinking that it might make me look more confident in my appearance. I chose a pair of Chamaripa height-enhancing shoes, which are quite fashionable. After putting them on, I actually felt that I was 7 cm taller immediately! The most important thing is that these shoes look exactly like ordinary shoes, and no one will think that I am wearing height-enhancing shoes.

The first time I wore them to meet friends, I was in a really good mood! When I walked into the coffee shop, I felt like I was walking with the wind, and I felt so confident in my heart, it couldn't be better! Moreover, these shoes are also very comfortable to wear, and I don't feel tired at all after walking around all day.

I found that height-increasing shoes are not only an external change, but also a psychological impact. Every time I wear them, I feel more confident, dare to speak actively in parties, and it is easier to communicate with people. Even my friends noticed my changes and started to praise me, ""You look good today!"" This makes me happy.

In short, if you are like me and are a little insecure about your height, you might as well try height-increasing shoes! It can really bring you a big change without you realizing it. I hope my sharing is helpful to you. Let's work together to be the most confident self!",2,1731899446.0,shortguys,1,1.0,False
1gtv8qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/WelcomeHome_OC/comments/1gtv8qt/facts_about_honey/,Facts About Honey ,"https://preview.redd.it/80p8rxwquk1e1.png?width=512&format=png&auto=webp&s=20e9e5e777fb99482c547cd16b1704b73e554f5a

FACTS ABOUT HONEY:

* Honey Sugar It's not a nickname It is actually her real name that her parents gave her that everybody assumes it's just a nickname or just her trying to be unique but no it's actually her real name
* She has a southern accent
* She's 23
* Honey grew up in a bakery Her mother is Southern and her father is French So she had a very strict pastry like upbringing so she is very particular about how things are done especially when you have a French pastry stuff as a father
* Honey is type 1 diabetic She usually has really low blood sugar and I like to think as she bakes when she feels her blood sugar get low she likes to eat what she's made to help it out
* Honey is usually a sweet woman she tries to be like the southern belle like woman like her mama but press her buttons the wrong way or do something that she views as disrespectful or uncouth You will see this normally sweet southern woman bring out the spice and she's not afraid to fight either She can be mean if you get on her bad side but normally she doesn't like to be like that
* Honey is actually a very smart business woman She knows about what her customers want supply and demand-wise And she really knows how to pronounce herself and her pastries and sweets and all sorts of baked goods Her strategy is to always leave the door slightly open or leave somewhere that has a crack in it so the neighbors can smell fresh baked goods and that will make them want to come in
* Honey is a workaholic She loves to bake so much that she'll end up baking up a storm usually tending to forget to eat and take breaks and just completely lose track of time sometimes neighbors will have to come in there to remind her to take breaks and eat and make sure she hasn't baked so much to the point where it's unsellable
* One time Honey baked so much that the neighborhood had to have a baked goods eating contest because there were just so many pastries and if you're wondering what type of pastry it was jelly donuts they were popular and she went through one of her moments where she just non-stop baking in the zone and yeah she ended up filling up the whole shop and a little bit outside her shop of jelly donuts
* I would say if Honey would have any close relationships with any neighbors it would probably be Howdy Poppy and Eddie, Howdy Because they're both business oriented and sometimes they might get competitive, Poppy I like to think that they would bake together and just talk and have tea and you know have some lady chats hehe, And Eddie I feel like they would talk in countryisms a lot and just have some similar experiences to things again like loving their jobs I feel like they would be really good friends
* Before moving to Home, Honey used to own a bakery that was very successful where she would get catering jobs for weddings birthday parties gatherings etc. and it was really good business The only reason why she moved away from the city and to Home was because she wanted to have a new market where it wasn't so stressful like it was in the city Just countless orders but in home it's relaxing it's peaceful she can just bake bread and pastries to people that seemed like they would appreciate it more
* Some flaws that Honey has is that she'll make way too much sometimes enough to feed an army, she's very time blind She tries to be on time but when you're in the zone baking a lot of stuff you lose track of time So that's why she makes sure she has timers for important stuff, She is a bit of baked good snob she's very picky and particular about how things are baked and how things are served when you make baked goods whether that being a pastry or savory sort of baked good The reason for that is her upbringing of having a French pâtissier as a father and being trained hard and her family bakery to make the best pastries they could make so that's why she's a bit of a pastry snob and will nitpick the littlest things if not done correctly, though she is trying to get better at not doing that though as not everyone is a professional baker like her, And she has a habit of spraying way too much perfume on herself She likes to smell good but sometimes it's a little bit of overkill And it's just too much It's overpowering, She can be a klutz at times especially when she's serving when people order like a pastry and a coffee or a hot chocolate she goes out and serves and she's the only one working she might end tripping on herself and spilling whatever she had to serve onto the customer That's a little joke as well
* Since Honey is half French She can speak French very fluently and use the French terms for certain pastries and savory baked goods and will use the French terms for the methods that are used with a perfect accent and everything and people are usually impressed when she speaks French
* I still do ship her with Howdy because of the connection of how I created her as a character so it has a special place in my heart  (but it's not a main focus)
* Her bakery is called Honey's Sugar Stop
* If she had one of the it's for you phone phrases it would be: ""Hello, Sugarcube,  this is Honey's Sugar Stop this is Honey speaking would you like to place an order?......Hello?.... Are you there sugar?........\*taps foot\*...... Look sweetie I can't Just stay on the phone line the whole time I got some rolls in the oven that I better take out of the oven before they burn, So if you have an order you like to place for the best baked goods in Home Please call me up If not please don't waste precious bake'n time.....""\*\*CLICK\*\*

Suffered severe rumination and racing thoughts, DPDR, full blown dissociation, any and every anxiety symptom, I had. Ended up in hospital. Im now medicated on an antidepressant, and my anxiety is 90% gone. 

Since my anxiety has been mostly gone, i can finally feel emotions and everything now, i can think somewhat clearly, compared to where i was at, and usual anxious thoughts come and go without having much of an impact on me. 

However i believe it became a habit to be so vigilant over my thoughts and emotions considering all the pain and struggling they were putting me though.. which has led me to notice some things on just how quick my thoughts actually formulate. 

I cant remember ever noticing this before all of this, either because it wasnt like this or it was just normal for me. It wasnt until i was doing those check ups on my thoughts to make sure i was thinking ""properly"" that i noticed that they come so damn fast, to the point its hard to remember where a thought even just started. 

Heres an example-

I was on my way to work, approaching the light to turn into the gas station where i get my coffee and stuff. As im about 50 feet from the light, i remember how i havent seen the girl who works on the weekends throughout the week, then for whatever reason i started to think about how maybe she works that schedule because she has kids, and how maybe she can only be available on the weekend to work. I then thought well maybe she has to have a partner to pick up the slack, which i then thought was odd because shes been very flirty with me everytime she sees me.. then i thought since i only ever see her friday-sunday, that shes a stay at home mom monday-thursday and since she works 2nd shift, she can get the kids ready for school friday morning and leave for work leaving it up to her partner to be there for the weekend. Then i hit the light, and i thought to myself, holy fuck. How the fuck did i think all of that, so quick, and why am i even thinking about that. It just happened so naturally. It felt like i was in control but wasnt at the same time, and its so hard to explain. 

Thats one example of many times i noticed this, and only reason i remembered it is because i made sure to really break it down so i could give an example to my doctor and i guess reddit.. lol. Otherwise i wouldnt remember. Im sure i do this with a lot of things and simply dont realize it. Does this sound similar to racing thoughts for you guys or are these normal thought processes.. 😅 sorry for the long post just curious really. ",2,1731899394.0,adhd_anxiety,0,1.0,False

# 1. Be Open About Your Sobriety

Honesty is key in any relationship, and it’s especially important when it comes to sobriety. Make sure your potential partner knows that you are living a sober lifestyle and explain why it’s important to you. This helps set expectations from the start and ensures you’re on the same page.

# 2. Choose Alcohol-Free Date Ideas

If you’re meeting someone in person, choose date activities that don’t revolve around drinking. Hiking, attending art galleries, cooking dinner together, or even going to a coffee shop are all great ways to connect without alcohol involved.

# 3. Be Patient

Just like in any other form of dating, finding the right person takes time. Don’t get discouraged if things don’t work out immediately. Remember, sober dating is about finding a partner who respects your lifestyle, values, and goals. Keep your expectations realistic, and trust that the right person will come along.

# 4. Support Each Other

If you’re in recovery or navigating sobriety for any reason, having a supportive partner who understands your journey can be incredibly fulfilling. Support each other’s growth, and be open about challenges and victories along the way.

# The Future of Sober Dating

Sober dating is becoming more mainstream as people embrace alcohol-free lifestyles for health, wellness, and recovery reasons. As awareness grows, more sober dating sites and communities will emerge, offering individuals a safe space to meet others who share their commitment to sobriety. Whether you’re looking for love or simply someone who shares your sober values, the sober dating scene is expanding, providing more opportunities for genuine connections.

In conclusion, if you’ve been wondering, **“Are there sober dating sites?”**—the answer is a resounding yes! The growing number of sober dating platforms reflects a shift toward meaningful, substance-free relationships, allowing you to connect with others who prioritize emotional connection, clear communication, and mutual respect.

Cruns floated through the docking bay of Station Gamma-12, his elongated limbs moving with the grace of someone who’d spent more time in zero-gravity than on solid ground. His blue-gray skin shimmered under the harsh lights, and his four eyes blinked in sync as he surveyed the bustling scene. The station was a veritable zoo of species—some with scales, others with fur, a few with appendages that defied basic geometry. But Cruns wasn’t interested in any of them. No, his attention was laser-focused on one particular individual.

The human.

Dave Thompson.

Deathworlder.

Cruns had heard the rumors, of course. Everyone had. Humans were a species from a planet so dangerous it was practically a death sentence just to be born there. They thrived in environments that would kill most sentient beings within minutes—hours, if you were lucky. They ate things that other species used as industrial solvents. They healed from injuries that would leave most creatures in pieces, and they did it all with a smile and a shrug, like it was no big deal.

But Cruns wasn’t one to believe in tall tales. He was a Vraxxi—a telepathic species known for their calm demeanor and logical approach to life. He didn’t buy into the hype. Most of the stories sounded like exaggerations at best, outright fabrications at worst.

Still, there was something... compelling about this human. Dave Thompson was just sitting there, casually tinkering with some equipment in the corner of the docking bay, completely unaware of the chaos around him. He wore that strange human expression—the one they called a ""smile” as he worked on a plasma conduit. 

Cruns tilted his head slightly, curious.

""What goes on inside that skull?"" 

He’d never read a human’s mind before. Not many Vraxxi had—something about their neural patterns made them difficult to read. But Cruns liked challenges, and besides, he had time to kill before his meeting with the station commander.

He closed his eyes—or rather, two of them—and reached out with his mind.

At first, it was like stepping into an empty room. Quiet. Still. Deceptively peaceful.

Then... the sound hit him like a physical wall. 

Noise. So much noise.

It hit him like a freight hauler at full speed—a cacophony of thoughts, images, sounds, all jumbled together in a chaotic whirlwind that made no sense whatsoever. There were flashes of something called “pizza,” followed by an image of a small furry creature wearing a hat (why?), then some numbers—lots of numbers—interspersed with snippets of music that seemed to loop endlessly in the background.

Cruns recoiled for a moment but held on. He wasn’t about to be defeated by mere mental clutter.

But it didn’t stop there.

Nope.

The deeper he went into Dave’s mind, the stranger things became. There were random thoughts about fixing things—so many things—and then there were memories of places Cruns couldn’t even begin to understand: vast cities filled with towering structures made from materials that shouldn’t exist; open fields where humans ""ran"" for no apparent reason; oceans filled with creatures that looked like they belonged in nightmares rather than nature documentaries.

And then... there was ""the urge.""

It started small—a faint itch at the back of Cruns’ own mind that grew stronger by the second until it became impossible to ignore.

""Coffee.""

What?

""Coffee,"" Dave’s mind insisted again.

Cruns had no idea what coffee was, but suddenly he needed it—desperately. His entire body tingled with anticipation as if not getting this mysterious substance would result in some kind of catastrophic failure.

He tried to pull back from Dave’s thoughts—to disconnect—but something held him there, like a mental tether wrapped around his consciousness and refusing to let go.

Panic flickered through Cruns' usually calm mind as he realized he wasn’t just reading Dave’s thoughts anymore; he was ""feeling"" them too—experiencing them as if they were his own.

And right now? Right now all Dave wanted was coffee.

Cruns’ eyes snapped open (all four this time), and without thinking—or maybe because thinking wasn’t really an option anymore—he turned and bolted toward the nearest exit from the docking bay. His long legs carried him faster than any Vraxxi had ever moved before on this station as he raced toward... well... wherever coffee might be found.

Behind him, several crew members exchanged confused glances as they watched Cruns sprint away like someone had set fire to his tail (if he’d had one).

“What’s up with him?” asked a Xellian technician who had been adjusting some panels nearby.

“No idea,” replied another alien. They both looked back at Dave.  “Maybe he's allergic to humans?”

They both shrugged and went back to work.

Meanwhile, Cruns’ mind raced along with his body as Dave’s thoughts continued to flood his consciousness in an unrelenting torrent of randomness and urgency.

Coffee... pizza... fixing things... running... coffee again...

This wasn’t what Cruns had signed up for when he decided to read a human’s mind. Not even close.

And yet... here he was—hurtling down corridors at breakneck speed in search of something called coffee while trying desperately not to lose what little remained of his sanity along the way.

Cruns skidded to a stop in the middle of the corridor, his limbs flailing awkwardly as he tried to regain composure. His heart—or whatever the Vraxxi equivalent was—pounded in his chest like a malfunctioning thruster. He blinked rapidly, trying to clear the haze of Dave’s thoughts that still swirled around his mind like a storm of nonsense.

Coffee. Coffee. Coffee.

It was relentless. The human’s craving for this mysterious liquid was consuming him, and by extension, consuming Cruns too. What even  was coffee? Some sort of fuel? A medicinal substance? A narcotic? Whatever it was, Dave’s brain had decided it was the most important thing in the entire galaxy right now, and Cruns was powerless to resist.

He tried—really tried—to pull himself free from the mental tether that had wrapped itself around him like a constricting vine. He banged his head on a bulkhead trying to knock himself out but only succeded in giving himself a headache. No matter what he tried, every time he attempted to sever the connection, something else from Dave’s mind would latch onto him. It wasn’t just thoughts anymore; it was “urges”. Needs. Desires. And they were all so... human.

Cruns groaned audibly as another wave of Dave’s consciousness crashed over him, this time bringing with it a sudden and inexplicable fascination with... “duck tape”?

Why?

Why duck tape? What is duck tape?!!

What possible use could a sentient being have for such a primitive bird and adhesive? 

Cruns shook his head violently, trying to dislodge the thought. He had more pressing concerns at the moment than figuring out why humans seemed to worship sticky strips of fabric.

He needed to get out of this mess.

Taking a deep breath, Cruns closed his eyes again and focused. He’d been trained for this. Well, not “this” exactly—no one had ever told him what to do if he accidentally got stuck in the mind of an insane deathworlder—but he’d been trained for mental discipline, for controlling telepathic connections.

He could do this.

Slowly, cautiously, he reached out with his mind again, trying to find the thread that connected him to Dave’s consciousness. It was there—tangled and messy but still visible in the mental landscape. All he had to do was follow it back and—

“Wham.”

Another thought hit him like a meteorite—this one about something called “nachos.” Cruns had no idea what nachos were, but suddenly he could “taste” them—cheesy, salty, spicy—and his stomach growled in response.

This was getting ridiculous.

Cruns opened his eyes again and found himself standing in front of a large window overlooking one of the station’s observation decks. Beyond the glass, stars twinkled against the black void of space, serene and unmoving—a stark contrast to the chaos inside his head. Several crew watched him curiously.

For a moment, Cruns allowed himself to get lost in the view. Space had always calmed him before. It was vast and empty, yet full of possibilities—a perfect metaphor for the Vraxxi way of life.

But not today.

Today, space wasn’t calming at all because Dave Thompson’s mind was still buzzing inside Cruns’ skull like an overactive swarm of insects.

With an exasperated sigh, Cruns turned away from the window and started walking again—though where he was going exactly, he wasn’t sure. His legs seemed to have taken on a life of their own, driven by some subconscious need that wasn’t entirely his own anymore.

And then... he felt it.

The “urge” again.

This time it wasn’t just coffee or nachos or duck tape. No... this time it was something deeper. Something primal.

Cruns froze mid-step as an unfamiliar sensation washed over him—a sensation that made no sense given his current surroundings but felt undeniably real nonetheless.

It was... danger?

But there was no danger here! He was on Station Gamma-12—a peaceful hub of interspecies cooperation where nothing ever happened beyond routine maintenance checks and diplomatic meetings!

Yet there it was—that gnawing feeling at the back of his mind telling him something was wrong. Very wrong.

He glanced around nervously as if expecting some unseen threat to leap out from behind one of the station’s sterile walls at any moment. But everything looked normal—calm even.

Still... that feeling wouldn’t go away.

And then it hit him: This wasn’t his fear.

It was Dave’s.

Somewhere deep within Dave’s subconscious—buried beneath layers upon layers of random thoughts about food and tools and caffeine—there lurked an instinctual fear response that had been triggered by... something. Cruns didn’t know what yet—but whatever it was had left its mark on Dave’s psyche in ways even Dave himself might not fully understand.

And now that fear had latched onto Cruns too—like an unwelcome guest who refused to leave despite repeated hints that they’d overstayed their welcome.

Great.

Just great.

Not only was he stuck inside a human’s chaotic brain; now he also had to deal with irrational deathworlder fears on top of everything else!

Cruns clenched his fists tightly at his sides as frustration bubbled up inside him like molten lava ready to erupt from a volcano (a metaphor he’d picked up from one of Dave’s stray thoughts about Earth geology).

This wasn’t how things were supposed to go!

He’d come here for a simple mission—to map star systems! Not get trapped inside some lunatic human’s head while being bombarded with cravings for strange foods and inexplicable survival instincts!

But here he was—and there didn’t seem to be any easy way out...

At least not yet...

Cruns stumbled into the station’s mess hall like a creature possessed. His usually graceful gait had devolved into something resembling a drunken shuffle, his limbs jerking in odd directions as if they couldn’t quite agree on where they were supposed to go. His eyes—normally calm and calculating—darted around the room with a wild intensity, searching for something he couldn’t name but “needed”.

""Coffee. Coffee. Coffee,"" his mind chanted, though it wasn’t really “his” mind doing the chanting anymore.

The mess hall was relatively quiet at this hour. A few crew members from various species sat scattered around, eating meals that ranged from gelatinous blobs to what looked suspiciously like rocks. Cruns didn’t care. He barely even noticed them. His entire focus was on one thing: finding that mysterious substance that Dave’s mind had latched onto with the tenacity of a starving predator.

He approached the food dispensers with a single-minded determination, his fingers twitching as he scanned the options. There were dozens of choices—nutrient pastes, protein cubes, hydration gels—but none of them mattered.

And then... there it was.

""Coffee.""

The word appeared on one of the dispenser screens, glowing softly in the sterile light of the mess hall. Cruns’ eyes widened in triumph as he jabbed at the screen with a shaking finger. The machine whirred to life, and moments later, a steaming cup of dark liquid appeared in front of him.

He stared at it for a moment, entranced by the strange aroma wafting up from the cup. It smelled... strong. Bitter. Alien.

But Dave’s mind didn’t care about any of that. Dave’s mind “wanted” it.

So Cruns lifted the cup to his lips and took a sip.

The effect was immediate—and catastrophic.

His body reacted as though he’d just ingested molten lava mixed with acid and a dash of pure chaos. His throat burned, his stomach churned, and his limbs began to tremble uncontrollably. But despite all this—despite every fiber of his being screaming at him to stop—he took another sip.

And another.

And another.

Because that’s what Dave would do.

By the time Cruns finished the cup, he was shaking so badly that he could barely stand. His skin had turned an alarming shade of purple, and sweat poured down his face in rivulets. His heart was pounding so hard he thought it might explode right out of his chest.

But still... he felt “alive”.

More alive than he’d ever felt before.

It was exhilarating and terrifying all at once—a heady mix of adrenaline and insanity that left him gasping for breath but craving more at the same time.

""More coffee,"" Dave’s mind whispered insistently from somewhere deep inside Cruns’ brain.

""No!"" Cruns gasped aloud, clutching his head as if he could physically push Dave’s thoughts out of his skull. ""No more coffee!""

Several crew members turned to stare at him with wide eyes, clearly alarmed by his outburst. One particularly brave Xellian—a small creature covered in iridescent scales—approached cautiously.

""Uh... are you okay?"" it asked hesitantly, its voice high-pitched and nervous.

Cruns blinked at the Xellian through a haze of caffeine-induced delirium, trying to focus on its shimmering form but failing miserably as Dave’s thoughts continued to swirl around inside his head like a tornado made entirely out of nonsense.

""I... I don’t know,"" Cruns admitted, his voice shaky and unsteady. ""I think I’ve made a terrible mistake.""

The Xellian tilted its head curiously. ""What kind of mistake?""

Cruns opened his mouth to respond but was interrupted by another surge of Dave’s thoughts crashing over him like a tidal wave made entirely out of bad decisions.

""Fix things!"" Dave’s mind screamed suddenly, completely abandoning its previous obsession with coffee in favor of something new and equally inexplicable: “the need to repair something.”

Cruns groaned as the urge hit him like a physical blow—a compulsion so strong it left him breathless and dizzy. He had no idea what needed fixing or why it was so important, but none of that mattered anymore because “Dave needed it fixed”.

Without thinking—or perhaps because thinking wasn’t really an option anymore—Cruns turned on his heel and bolted from the mess hall, leaving behind a trail of confused crew members in his wake as he sprinted down the corridor toward... well... something that needed fixing.

He didn’t know what yet—but he’d find it soon enough.

\---

By the time Cruns reached one of the station’s maintenance bays, he was practically vibrating with energy—not just from the coffee but also from Dave’s relentless drive to fix whatever was broken (even if nothing actually ""was"" broken).

He burst into the maintenance bay like a whirlwind, startling several engineers who were busy working on various pieces of equipment scattered around the room. They looked up in surprise as Cruns stormed over to one particularly large piece of machinery—a diagnostic scanner used for checking ship systems—and began dismantling it with feverish intensity.

""W-what are you doing?"" one of the engineers stammered as Cruns ripped open panels and yanked out wires without any regard for safety protocols or common sense.

""Fixing it!"" Cruns replied through gritted teeth as he continued pulling apart components with reckless abandon. ""It needs fixing!""

""But... it’s not broken!"" another engineer protested weakly, watching in horror as Cruns tore out half of the scanner’s internal circuitry and tossed it aside like garbage.

Cruns ignored them both completely as he worked furiously on reassembling the machine in ways that defied logic or reason—but somehow made perfect sense inside Dave’s chaotic mind.

Within minutes (or maybe hours—time had lost all meaning at this point), Cruns stepped back from his handiwork with a satisfied grin plastered across his face—a grin that wasn’t entirely ""his"" anymore but belonged just as much to Dave now too.

""There!"" he declared triumphantly as he wiped sweat from his brow. ""All fixed!""

The engineers stared at him in stunned silence for several long moments before one finally dared to approach cautiously and inspect what remained of their once-functional diagnostic scanner.

""It’s... not supposed to look like this,"" one muttered under their breath while poking gingerly at some exposed wires hanging haphazardly from where Cruns had reattached them using duct tape (because obviously).

Cruns just shrugged nonchalantly—as if completely oblivious to how utterly insane everything about this situation actually was—and turned to leave without another word...

Cruns staggered out of the maintenance bay, his limbs twitching with residual energy, his mind still a chaotic storm of human impulses and alien confusion. He had no idea how long he’d been in there, tearing apart perfectly functional equipment and reassembling it in ways that defied all known engineering principles. But it didn’t matter. Not to him. Not to ""Dave"".

He wiped a bead of sweat—""wait, was that sweat?""—from his brow and leaned against the cold metal wall of the corridor, trying to catch his breath. His body felt like it was vibrating from the inside out, like every cell was buzzing with some strange, frenetic energy that wouldn’t let him rest.

""Coffee,"" Dave’s mind whispered again, insistent and unrelenting.

Cruns groaned. ""Not again.""

But the craving was back, stronger than before. It gnawed at him like a parasite burrowing into his brain, demanding satisfaction. He could ""feel"" Dave’s need for caffeine pulsing through his veins, overriding all rational thought.

He had to get more.

With a resigned sigh, Cruns pushed himself off the wall and started walking—no, ""stumbling""—back toward the mess hall. His legs felt like they were made of jelly, wobbling beneath him with every step. His vision blurred at the edges as his mind swam in a sea of disjointed thoughts and half-formed ideas.

""Just one more cup,"" he muttered to himself as he rounded a corner, nearly colliding with a group of passing crew members. They jumped back in alarm, their eyes wide with confusion and concern as they watched Cruns lurch past them like a malfunctioning automaton.

""Is he... okay?"" one of them whispered.

""I don’t think so,"" another replied, their voice tinged with unease. ""Maybe we should call medical?""

But Cruns didn’t hear them—or if he did, he didn’t care. All that mattered was getting to that sweet, bitter nectar that Dave’s mind craved so desperately.

The mess hall loomed ahead like an oasis in the desert—a beacon of hope in an otherwise overwhelming sea of madness. Cruns practically threw himself through the doors, his eyes wild as they locked onto the coffee dispenser across the room.

There it was. Salvation.

He staggered over to the machine and slammed his hand down on the button without hesitation. The familiar whirring sound filled the air as another cup of steaming black liquid appeared before him.

Cruns grabbed it with both hands and lifted it to his lips, ignoring the warning signals his own body was sending him—the rapid heartbeat, the shaking limbs, the growing sense of impending doom that seemed to hang over him like a dark cloud.

He took a sip.

And then another.

And another.

The caffeine hit him like a freight train—hard and fast—sending shockwaves through his already overstimulated system. His heart raced even faster now, pounding in his chest like it was trying to break free from its confines. His hands trembled uncontrollably as he downed the rest of the cup in one long gulp.

For a moment—just a brief, fleeting moment—he felt invincible.

And then everything went wrong.

Cruns’ vision blurred again, but this time it wasn’t just from exhaustion or mental overload. No... this was something else entirely. His body began to convulse violently as waves of nausea washed over him in relentless succession.

His skin—normally a calm shade of blue-gray—flushed an alarming shade of purple as sweat poured down his face in torrents. His limbs twitched uncontrollably, jerking in random directions like they were no longer under his control.

""Not good,"" he gasped as he stumbled backward, clutching at his chest as if trying to steady himself. ""Not good.""

The room spun around him in dizzying circles as his body continued its downward spiral into full-blown caffeine-induced chaos. He could feel every organ inside him protesting violently against whatever toxic substance he had just consumed—but Dave’s mind didn’t care about any of that.

Dave’s mind wanted more.

Cruns collapsed into a nearby chair with a groan, his head spinning so fast he thought he might pass out right then and there. He could barely think straight anymore—his thoughts were jumbled together in an incoherent mess of human cravings and alien physiology gone haywire.

""Why... why do humans ""do"" this?"" he muttered weakly as he slumped forward onto the table in front of him, barely able to keep himself upright anymore.

""Because coffee is life,"" Dave’s voice whispered smugly from somewhere deep inside Cruns’ mind—a voice that wasn’t really Dave’s but felt like it belonged to him all the same.

Cruns groaned again and buried his face in his hands. This was madness—pure, unadulterated madness—and yet somehow... somehow it made sense in Dave’s world.

But Cruns wasn’t built for this kind of insanity—not physically or mentally—and now he was paying the price for meddling where no Vraxxi should have ever dared to tread: inside a human’s mind.

As if on cue, two medical officers rushed into the mess hall at that very moment—alerted by one of the concerned crew members who had seen Cruns earlier—and hurried over to where he sat slumped over at the table.

""Sir? Are you alright?"" one of them asked urgently as they knelt beside him and began checking his vitals and checking his pad on what Vraxxi vitals were supposed to look like under normal circumstances (which these clearly weren’t).

Cruns blinked up at them through bleary eyes but couldn’t muster enough energy—or coherence—to respond properly. Instead, he just mumbled something about coffee and duct tape before promptly passing out right there on the table with an exhausted sigh escaping from between his lips that sounded suspiciously like, “coffee…”

Script: 

(Quiet humming)

\[SFX: Footsteps\]

\[Teasing\] Hey there hero, You're finally awake. Still tired from getting kidnapped...Days ago?

...

Sure, sure it's all my fault...You could leave if you want, no one is keeping you here...

...

(Laugh) I don't know either, Coffee? You look like you need it. Come on sit down.

...

\[SFX: Chair squeak\]

Ah, there you go. Good morning, dear.

...

Oh, am I smiling? I didn't notice.

...

(Gasp) What with this accusation? Maybe I'm smiling because the lovely face of the golden hero is in front of me. Not everyone can say that or even fathom having the pleasure to.

...

(Giggle) Uh oh, you got me... Should I tell you what I found out early this morning? It amused me greatly...still is even a few hours later. I don't know if you will feel too greatly about it- ...

Okay, I warned you. At around 3 I decided to take a little stroll to the Heroes convention building. I don't really like going there you know? It's dolled up in tons of gold, it's blinding, and doesn't fit their humble motto- but I digress. There are usually a few heroes in the lobby to greet anyone coming as you know but guess what? Silence. AH, It was exhilarating. No fake niceties.

...

Uh no, The building wasn't fully vacant...there was someone at the front desk. So of course I go up to her and ask her what's going on. Like where are the lobby heroes? \[Sarcastic\] The lobby will go up in flames if they're not in their spots. (Bright excited hum) She said they've been called onto the streets. Everyone's running around like they have no head on their shoulders.

...

Yeah, the other villains are out and about. Without the golden hero, they can actually get things done. I'm very happy for them.

...

\[Teasing\] Oh, I do have plans but my main one was to get you. (Smile) And as you can see I succeeded, are you proud of me?

...

\[Dramatic\] (Exaggerated Gasp) Are you telling me you didn't like staying with me? Cuddling with me?... All these secret moments we've spent t-together haven't meant anything to you? This closeness-

...

(Laugh) Oh whatever, you were buying it for a second there.

...

Yeah, I AM an amazing actress...at least better than the heroes.

...

Oh, that wasn't a dig at you and you know it. Stop messing with me. But speaking of my plans I would love to share them with you but I think they serve better as a surprise than as a normal conversation.

...

Yup, that is all you are going to get out of me dear hero. Now how's the coffee?

...

Horrible? Yup thought so. I'm not that good at making coffee, I always seem to burn it. Doesn't bother me though I don't like coffee anyway. I actually never buy it but I had a feeling you'd like some. I decided to try it making t again.

...

Yes, I did buy and try it just because I thought you wanted some. I've told you, you make me feel something I haven't in a while or if really ever. Not to get all cliché but as a Villain there is a small chance of finding someone that you click with, a person who doesn't judge you at first glance. Imagine being with someone that praises the people you hate...But then by a slight chance you do find someone, you have to worry about how they'd react to you being ""Evil"". ""Cause all Villains are evil"" they'd say.

...

(Amused laugh) I don't think I'm evil either, hero. But it doesn't matter what I think...the people, the citizens do.

...

\[Serious and curious\] Speaking of the citizens...It seems they haven't noticed you've been gone...I wonder why that is. I think I'll go out and see if I can find a little bit of information.

...

(Giggle) No, not right now. I'm thinking later tonight around 10-ish. Why? Are you worried you won't get to spend time with me all day? Or are You afraid I'll be swept away by my growing curiosity? ...

Hmmm, See your words and face aren't matching, my dear hero. You don't have to worry, I could never cut our time short.

\[SFX: Chair squeak\]

Ugh, this coffee is really not doing it for me. Dear, I tried for you but I think we both deserve something a little sweeter.

...

\[SFX: Slow Footsteps getting closer to Listener\]

I did pick up a few pastries when I went to get to buy the coffee. Would you like one?

...

Yeah, I'm going to eat one too. It's a little embarrassing but I'm sort of addicted to them. I got them from my all-time favourite bakery...

...

Why am I walking towards you? (Giggle) To give you a pastry, of course, I offered right?

...

\[Amused\] I don't have anything in my hands...You are right about that. How observant you are, hero.

|If you haven't already footsteps stop here|

\[Whisper\] I guess you could say I need something to go with my pastry (Giggle)

...

\[Dazed\] Can I kiss you?

...

Of course, I want to, I've been gone since 3 in the morning, and by the time I was actually here, you've been asleep. Not your fault of course but...I feel deprived of you.

...

\[Playful\] Don't you try to tease me, Pity your dear lovely Villain. The Villain you decided to give a chance to. The one you like so very very-

(Kiss)

Ugh, that coffee taste is so strong and nasty...but your sweet taste overshines it, hero. I'll have to thank you for that.

(Kiss)

Let me hold you for a bit.

\[SFX: Clothes rustling\]

(Contented sigh)\[Whisper\] I'm so glad they didn't corrupt you. I couldn't imagine my hero being like the others, so ugly and deceitful.

PAUSE

Though you'd be incredibly powerful. I know your leaders love to push you heroes, they want to see the power you unleash when you finally crack. I'd like to see you use your powers to the fullest strength, especially because I know that's the main reason they're in shambles. When other heroes went ""missing"" they've never done this. Just went about their day as if nothing happened. But you...you're definitely special. (Amused giggle)

QUICK PAUSE

...They're scared. Not knowing where you are...If a villain has got to you and maybe changed your mind...You're no longer in their grasp...I feel they're going to do anything to get you back hero.

PAUSE

Must feel amazing to be wanted this badly, hmm?

...

Good, I should be the only one that matters.

(Kiss)

I wished you'd join me as a Villain, we'd be unstoppable I know it.

...

I guess I would miss calling you my dear hero.(Laugh)

We’re trying to find a gift for my father in law. My FIL(70s) is a very simple man. He likes one or two types of beer, grocery store drip coffee, watching football, basketball (he wouldn’t wear a jersey or anything sports related) and the weather. He teaches dance lessons with my mother in law but that’s something she spearheads and he just goes along with it. He likes very simple foods (nothing spicy, just a meat and potatoes kinda guy) and simple clothes (think a button-up with jeans). He doesn’t go out of his way to listen to music, but likes classic rock. He pretty much just goes along with anything everyone else does. He has his own personality but seemingly little to no interests/hobbies. He loves dad jokes but doesn’t read books. He doesn’t cook much but likes to BBQ. He would have no use for weird specialized gadgets. He doesn’t like anything fancy that strays from the norm. I think the best gift to get him would be one of the very few food/drink items that he actually likes. My partner wants to get him something more fun and unique that he’ll actually enjoy but every idea I’ve had has been shot down because he thinks his dad won’t like it, use it, or it’s too simple.

I have an opportunity to run a business, take it over and make it my own pretty much. I’ve wanted to open my own coffee shop for a while it just seemed too far from reach (I don’t have a degree I tried but I was so busy and my mother had just died I wasn’t in a condition to focus also working 6 days to make ends meet) it costs so much to start from ground up and I think this would be an amazing opportunity because it’s already there. I’ve been considering it because I know that it’s a lot of hard work and hard hours i just want to make sure i get what I put in $ at the minimum. I love where I work there are many regulars who like me and support the small business as well (there’s only 4 workers and the owner that’s why I say small but it makes maybe $4,000 a day from 6-5pm but anyway.

Now I get it he would probably say it’s because I love you and I want you to see what you’re getting into but it feels like shutting me down. It sucks because I’ve been nothing but supportive. All thru his college degree he graduates in may and before he had a good job and I still support him trying to find a better one I’ve done nothing but tell him he can do it and I believe in him. He tells me I should do something with my life because once your older it all goes away (I want to be a sahm and he’s supportive of that) but that’s so reasonable so why won’t he support any decision I want to make to actually better myself and tbh my resume.

And trying to get the stickers I missed). 

  
So I clocked the crappy boyfriend (was SO glad to see she nicked a bunch of his fancy pretentious coffee stuff when she left), the mobility issues and stopping rock climbing, the things she kept even when they got worn out (stuffed animals, the cup for toothbrushes) but on thing I haven't seen anyone comment on is her career, specifically author/artist of kids' books.  

  
We see her do a lot of drawing and enjoy a lot of stories (games/books) and she has childish drawings up when she's presumably post college, which struck me as odd, but makes sense in context. Her art supplies expand, become digital, etc. Then in the final year, her office includes a tonne of copies of a (presumably kids') book. I got a tad emotional thinking that this meant she'd published a children's book, culmination of all that development, and ties into the awards (and even more drawing/writing stuff) in that office. Can't think of a more likely reason for having so many copies.

  
So, is this an obvious thing I just haven't seen anyone mention, did everyone else have a different interpretation, or did my game glitch and the books weren't supposed to be the same (maybe they're not even books at all...)?",3,1731897867.0,Unpacking,4,1.0,False

We met for coffee in the yesterday afternoon and had a nice time talking. We both had dinners with friends that night, but then he met up with me and my friend after his dinner. We were all talking for a few hours, then we hung out for a bit by ourselves. He kissed me a the end of the night and then we both went home. He said he would like to meet up again when he’s back from his work trip next week. 

He was flying for his work trip today, and I haven’t heard anything from him. Is it normal to have 2 dates in one day with someone and kiss at the end of the night and then not hear from them the next day? Would it be normal if we didn’t talk all week when he’s traveling and then he reached out to me next week when he’s back? I feel like he’s not a huge texter, but he was really chatty in person, so just not sure how much communication I should expect after 1-2 dates when someone is traveling.

1gtuqvy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/1gtuqvy/does_this_mean_cristina_regrets_some_of_her/,Does this mean Cristina regrets some of her 'activities' as a younger doctor?,"Cristina and Shane are in an OR and she's asked him if he ever felt compromised when they slept together and he says no and that he's not just saying that to earn favours from her (because she asked that too)- so then she says:

""Because you never have to do that. You don't have to get Shepherd coffee or fix Callie's baby schedule or... relax me. You're too good of a doctor for that. And when you look back in 10 years, you'll be relieved you didn't.""

Considering Cristina's own history of sleeping with mentors would you interpret that as meaning she felt she had to sleep with them to earn favours and she really regrets it now looking back? Or is she saying something else?

I think Cristina definitely loved Burke because even though she wouldn't want to start things up again she's not over him even seven years later - it seems that way when she sees him again in season 10 so I couldn't say she was only ever with Burke for favours. But I could buy it with Marlowe because there didn't seem to be any love lost on Cristina's end when he showed up at the hospital, I believe she was attracted to his talent but didn't love him. Or maybe she's really talking about the boss in Mayo, maybe she slept with him because she thought he'd stop giving her a hard time about being sad at work if she did. 

Even if it's true that on some occasions Cristina slept around to get ahead I can respect that she doesn't want the cycle to continue and would have been unhappy if Shane had slept with her just because he thought he had to in order to succeed. 

Thoughts? Am I overthinking it? It struck me as a very good bit of dialogue.

And that Lee is also a girl \(not required i just don't like Lee\)](https://reddit.com/link/1gtuo86/video/lvmigpqzlk1e1/player)

For party, you need Pearl, Umbra, Maria/Lee, and Anne  
  
The formula is 81 x 22 x 35 x 3 x 1.2 x 7 = \~1.57 million maximum damage

81 - The number of times Umbra can use Howl with 817 SP  
22 - The number of full SP bars Umbra has if you have 20 coffees, and pilfer one from Bisonman  
35 - The damage increase given by each howl with Spirit 5  
3 - The damage multiplier given from Pearl's Shotgun 4 perk  
1.2 - The max random bonus multiplier given when attacking (random # from 1.0 to 1.2)  
7 - The max damage multiplier given with a shotgun

Pearl's base attack and choice of shotgun are nearly inconsequential; as well as Anne doing ChaChas, only adding about 5k damage to the total.

  
Why a 7 multiplier? Shotguns work by placing four squares on all corners of the enemy's center. A bullet is placed in a random spot on each square, and each bullet that touches the enemy's hitbox deals damage (making colossal enemies easy to hit)

each of the 4 pellets do a random damage number from 0 to 1.5x the main shots damage (so if you miss they'll all do 1 damage).

that means on average the 4 pellets, plus the main shot, deal an average of 4x the base shots damage, and up to a maximum of 7x its damage.

So on average this setup will deal 897k damage. With a little luck you'll get a million

Also this takes 1700 turns to set up, as you need to perform 1700 howls.",5,1731897596.0,ufo50,0,0.78,False

About a year ago, I came off my Rebel 500 after a near miss with a car. Once I got my bike back from repairs (minor damage only, nil significant injuries) I was terrified to ride it. I posted in this group asking how I can get my mojo back and the advice was simple and clear: 'get back on the horse that threw you', so I did, to and from work on fair weather days. My anxiety was through the roof the whole time. Today, for some reason, I put my packtalk edge into a new helmet and a little voice said 'go for a ride'. I ended up going to my favourite coffee shop and back home again. The whole time I was calm, relaxed and happy. Had some lo-fi tunes for company and felt my bike slide around corners and pick up on straights like she was meant to. My body just went with the flow and it felt amazing to cruise around again

We just got home and I just want to say we really enjoyed our short time there.

We left our house around 2:30pm and made out first stop at Point Pleasent around 4:30 and went to the mothman museum. I of course dont ""believe"" in the mothman but as a lover of history I really enjoyed seeing all the newspaper and relics from the time and reading how people thought of the situation at the time. Also stopped in some shops along the street there and got some pokemon cards I needed from the comic shop right down the road. I also LOVED the murals painted on the walls along the river.

  
About an hour later got to charelston and ate at the Cold Spot which as a wing lover the people in the Charelston Subreddit (which I imagine many of you are apart of) told me was the best in town. They were fantastic wings and we got there in time to have it packed with WVU fans cheering for there team (felt a little strange wearing my OSU hoodie haha) I must say they had the best onion rings me and my fiance have ever had, while the wings were great id say the onion rings were even better. Checked into our Hotel the sheraton which was great but then soon we went to Taylor Books where I had a really good cappucino and we listened to some of the live music. Eventually we made our way down to Sams Uptown Cafe and had a few drinks and hopped over to the blue parraot which we loved. We love dive bars and it was probably one of the diviest we have ever been in but the people there were so nice I got hit with ""Based off your accent and hoodie you aint from here? well its good to have ya here, hopefully you can see we arent the uneducated inbreds like people from Alabama"" (real interaction) and I loved it. The live bluegrass music really set the vibe for us and we ended up having around 10 beers between the two of us haha.

Next morning we got up early and went to Tudors biscuits as since the Marshall HC talked about giving players NIL deals for unlimited Tudors I knew I had to try it and fittingly got the Thundering Herd Biscuit. Made the drive to New River Gorge and hiked up the Long Point Trail and got some amazing photos as the fog had cleared at the time. We then got coffee at the cathedral cafe in town and walked around before heading back to Charelston to explore the Capitol Building as it hadnt opened until 12 today so we did new river first. Gorgeous building inside and out, unfortunately since it was sunday the Museum was closed but now I just have a reason to comeback. And on the way back to Columbus we stopped at the bucket and had more great food (I will say I think Cold Spot has a small edge on Bucket in terms of wings). And now im home typing this.

Seriosuly had an amazing time in a new state and have been so curious about Apalachia since I started playing Fallout 76 in 2018 and watching multiple videos about the area. The drive was gorgeous especially to new river, I will say it was a little sad in some spots to see them so rundown or abandoned but I sort of expected some parts of that and it just made me hope even more that the state can some how in some way continue to prosper. It was also nice seeing some mountains and hills again after being away from Arizona and in the flat land of Ohio.

We crossed paths a few times in the store, and I thought she was really cute.

I lost track of her in the aisles. Luckily, we ended up parking next to each other!

I finally worked up the courage to say hello, We chatted for a bit and decided to

go on a date over the weekend. I'm currently going through a divorce,

which I explained to her upfront on our date. We talked for over two hours –

it was supposed to be a quick coffee, but we really hit it off! We

had a second date planned, but it got postponed twice due to her work commitments.

Both times we met, we went for a nice long walk talking about many things and she held my hand.

She made me feel really good, and she said she felt the same way.

I was respectful and never did anything to make her uncomfortable.

However, after the second date, she started responding to my texts

with short answers and sometimes even ghosting me. After waiting pateintly for close to two weeks ,

I asked her directly if she wanted to continue dating, and she simply said ""no.""

I told her I had a great time and said goodbye.

I'm confused because she seemed so into me at all the time. She even mentioned multiple

times how much she liked me and my behavior, especially since she had a pretty abusive

past relationship. I'm puzzled by the sudden shift/change. .

I am coming from a toxic relationship (hence divorce).

I did not question her say anything bad which is not my style.

But I was hurt and felt really bad for about a week because

I liked her and wanted to pursue dating to see if she is the one.

I am not desperate at all and did not behave lie one. She could have

simply rejected me but why spending quality time and then telling she liked

me and the ghosting me. Did I do something wrong",5,1731897350.0,dating,5,1.0,False

This morning my dad woke me up by shouting at me to get out of bed. I think he had tried to get me up once before that, but he knows I have trouble waking up because unless someone is making sure I open my eyes, my mind will not register that I'm supposed to be awake. I can get up to my alarm though.

Anyways, he yelled at me, and that was the first thing I woke up to. I said I was sorry even though I didn't know what I did wrong, and he just said ""thank you"" and then as I went to close my door to get dressed for church he started lecturing me about how I'm addicted to my devices and I can't get up because I'm always awake past midnight, which is not true, and he knows that's not true. I can't remember the last time I stayed up past midnight, I am very good at getting myself up and putting myself to bed when I need to. I set my alarm every night so I am up in time for school, and I put my phone away by myself at a good time to make sure I get 9 hours of sleep every night. He said that I was up late last night, on my phone and that's why I was having trouble getting up, but he KNOWS that's not true, but he started like gaslighting me into thinking it isn't true. I know he knows it's not true because he came home at like eleven last night, and I was in my mom's bed, snuggling with her, and I was half asleep, and he came in the room and told me it was time for me to go to my own bed, so I got up, and stumbled to my own bed, and turned the lights off and fell asleep. I heard him telling my brother to put his tablet away while I was doing this, and this morning he said that my brother never stays up late with his devices, but I do, which is so obviously not true to everyone around me that it's actually frustrating that he's just pretending that it's true.

When he was lecturing me this morning he was telling me about how my brother and I were going to get our devices confiscated at night because I can't get up, which, again, is not true, and he said ""now you're brother is getting punished because of you"". When I tried to defend myself he said I was playing the victim and deflecting, which is actually so funny because that's all he ever does.

He also started lecturing me about how he asks me to do the dishes everyday (which he actually doesn't, he just leaves the dish washer open in hopes that I'll get the hint, but if I don't get the hint he'll get mad. It didn't really take me long to figure that out, and I try to get to the dishes) he said that I never do it and he always have to come home from work (at four o'clock by the way) and do the dishes. I don't get to stop doing school until seven because I have so much studying to do. I'm trying to get into college, I'm taking so many hard classes, and he gets mad if I don't get good grades, so I'm trying to please him with that, but I cannot do it all. I told him that I'm studying all day and doing school all day long, and he said that everyday when he comes home he always sees me watching tv on my laptop, which is not true. Maybe he hears sound coming from my laptop, but that's not tv, it's probably either a video one of my teachers recorded to further explain instructions, a video I looked up to help me with a math problem I didn't understand, or music because sometimes music helps me study, but I know he doesn't hear my show on my laptop because it isn't on, but he won't let me defend myself because he's the father, and I'm not allowed to speak (i sincerely wish I was kidding). I would do the dishes, but I often don't have time, and I guess I could probably do it while watching a video assigned by a teacher, or while in a class, but I'm usually taking notes, and even when I'm not, I forget about the dishes because I'm so damn busy! Hell, I forget about everything because my brain is so consumed by school, I forgot that I was supposed to get coffee with my friends after church today and completely missed it. I'm not usually someone who forgets things unless I'm so busy. I can barely go to all the church events my dad makes me go to because I can't get a break from school, I just have to work for a little longer the next day on days that I have church events because my dad does not like it when I miss those. 

After he yelled at me I started crying, but I didn't let him see it because then he would go on about how now I've made him feel like the bad guy.

I can't tell anyone in my life about this because he's friends with everyone. He presents himself as the father of the year, and I'm scare of what will happen if I tell anyone. He doesn't hit me anymore, he used to spank me, and then he used to touch my ass randomly because he thought it was ""cute"" I had to ask him to stop a few times for him to actually stop, but he was mad that I asked him to stop because it hurt his feelings. I don't like being touched there because number one, it's fucking weird and it feels violating, and two I've been touched before, and experience child on child sexual assault so I hate being touched anywhere from hips to knees by anyone. It makes me want to cry, and start freaking out, I really don't like it.

Like I was saying, he doesn't get physical, but I'm scared of him because he's still so unpredictable. He's sometimes so mean to me, and then he's so nice, and I get so confused, and I don't know who to tell because I don't think anyone would believe me or care. I also feel like he expects everything from me, and he doesn't even ask my brother to clean up after himself, he asks me to do that.

Another thing is that I'm scared because at my church there is this guy who used to groom me, and now he just stares, and hangs around, and acts like he's coming towards me, and then goes to talk to someone else, and it scares me so much. I'm so scared of what he's going to do to me, but I could never leave that church because he likes to introduce himself to parents who have little girls, and I always feel like I need to tell the parents to watch out.

Anyways, I'm just scared of men right now, and I needed to get that off my chest. Thanks for reading.",1,1731897320.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.67,False

# ""Behind the Gate""

The car rattled over the loose gravel as Marcus drove up the narrow driveway to his father’s house. The sun was setting behind the old oak trees, casting long shadows across the land. The place felt smaller than he remembered, like time had tightened its grip, squeezing the life out of everything. He parked the car and sat there for a moment, gripping the wheel, trying to steady himself.

“Time to face the music,” he muttered under his breath.

Inside, his father, James, sat at the kitchen table, sipping coffee from an old chipped mug. The walls were still adorned with photos from another lifetime—Marcus as a kid, his mom before she passed, fishing trips and holidays that felt like ancient history.

James looked up as the door creaked open. His face was lined with the kind of weariness that comes from years of disappointment. “You’re late,” he said flatly.

Marcus sighed and dropped his bag on the floor. “I’m here, aren’t I?”

“Barely.” James set the mug down with a thud. “What’d you mess up this time?”

Marcus hesitated, then shrugged. “Same story, different chapter. Tried to flip some cash on a deal. Didn’t pan out.”

James shook his head, a mixture of anger and pity in his eyes. “You’re just like your mother. Dream big, fall harder.”

“Don’t,” Marcus snapped, his voice rising. “Don’t bring her into this.”

Silence hung between them like a thick fog. Marcus sat across from his father, their eyes locking in a battle neither of them wanted to fight.

“You’re not going anywhere with that attitude,” James finally said, his tone low but firm. “And you sure as hell aren’t going anywhere until you pay back what you owe.”

Marcus laughed bitterly. “I’m not asking for your help. I’m just here to figure things out.”

“Oh, you’ve got it all figured out?” James leaned back, crossing his arms. “You’ve been chasing the same pipe dreams for years, son. You need to stop digging holes you can’t climb out of.”

“I know,” Marcus said, quieter this time. “I’m just… trying to find my way. Feels like there’s a hole in my head, like I’m missing something.”

James studied him for a moment, the anger in his expression softening. “You think I didn’t screw up too? You think I didn’t have to learn the hard way?”

Marcus looked away, his jaw tight. He didn’t want to hear this, didn’t want the weight of his father’s wisdom crushing him further. But something about the man’s voice made him stay.

“I lost plenty,” James continued. “But you’ve got to stop running. Stop trying to hustle your way out of every mistake. Sometimes, you just have to sit with it, face it head-on.”

Marcus nodded slowly, the words sinking in deeper than he wanted to admit. He thought about the deals gone wrong, the bridges burned, the nights spent staring at the ceiling, wondering if this was all there was.

“I’m not asking you to fix it for me,” he said finally. “I just need a place to think. To figure out who I am.”

James nodded. “You can stay. But you’re gonna work. No shortcuts, no excuses.”

Marcus smirked faintly. “Fine. But I’m keeping my bag.”

“Keep the bag. Just don’t expect me to carry it for you.”

As the night settled over the house, Marcus stepped outside. The air was crisp, the sky clear and full of stars. He stared at the gate at the end of the driveway, the metal glinting in the moonlight. It felt like more than just a barrier—it was a symbol, a challenge.

“I’ll get behind it someday,” he murmured to himself.

But for now, he stood on the outside, grappling with the weight of his mistakes and the hope that maybe, just maybe, he could find his way through.",0,1731897319.0,bladee,1,0.25,False

So a bit of background, we've been together 4 years, I'm a First Nations women who runs a buisness teaching people how not to be racist and he works full time stacking shelves at night. 

We tried for two years and had a miscarriage during this time as well, the plan was I'd stay at home with bub due to running a buisness from home, he would return to work and on his days off he'd help out with taking care of our daughter and helping around the house.  The first week he returned to work, it was great. He'd get up in the morning feed her, take her on walks, helped around the house, there were no issues.

After that first week he stopped doing those things, when our daughter started crying for her bottle and I woke him up to do it (as he said the night before he wanted to do it) he would wake up I then said ""come on daddy, give me a bot bot so mum can have a coffee"" and he said ""go away, this is what you wanted"", so i did it. I brought it up to him later in the day and he said he had never said it and I had misheard, when I was adamant that he had said it he told me I was being manipulative (this is a general cop out my family uses, my brother told me to go kill myself, then said he never said it and I was just manipulating him into feeling bad) so my partner knew this would upset me.
I've noticed in the two weeks since, he's done fuck all. I've had to take on more work to build a safety net due to housing insecurity, so im working 50 hours a week in my buisness, then taking care of my daughter and the house. He works 65 hours a fortnight. This weekend he had the whole weekend off and he did one feed. I did all the house work, feeds, was up til 2am working then up again at 9am for bottle time. I hurt my shoulder and was struggling to hold our daughter and he said ""are you alright"" ""no my shoulder is killing"" ""oh maybe you pinched something"" and went out for a smoke, he offered to finish the bottle when he came back in but at that point it was nearly finished. 
Honestly it just pissed me off, it feels like he thinks because I wanted to stay at home than trying to afford child care that he doesn't need to do anything to help out. Then to top off my shitty mood the topic of engagement came up (I've been bringing it up a bit for the last year or two, he doesn't feel the need to get engaged so hasn't bothered with it), I said that if we get married we should hyphenate our last names so we have the same last name as our daughter, to represent the joining of two families, but he said no. He doesn't want to change his last name to be a combination of both because it's ""weird"" and ""other men with judge me"", even when I told him he doesn't need to even tell anyone that's what we've done, it was still a no. He knows that due to my culture and family, I wouldn't take his last name completely but would be happy to hyphenate out of respect for him and his family, but he doesn't want to show that same respect in return. 
This isn't what I wanted, I didn't want to feeling like I'm a single mother taking care of two kids because he can't even do the bare minimum while im in physical pain. I don't know what to do, when I tried to talk to him he got upset at me claiming that I'm only working because I dont trust him to take care of us financially when I know he would, its about me not giving up something I've worked so hard for. I thought we were doing it together, not me doing 90% of everything. I'm also at the point were if he does propose, I dont know if I should say yes.. what should I do? 

Tldr my partner told me I wanted to be a working stay at home mum, yes I did but I didn't realise that meant he wouldn't be doing anything to contribute to child care/house work and I dont know what to do.",1,1731896611.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

Some TV shows I have seen have people doing ""coffee runs"" where someone goes out and buys takeout coffee for their coworkers and brings it back to the workplace. 

Additionally, the most common advice from Americans on how to save money seems to be to stop buying coffee every day. 

Do workplaces in America not provide free coffee? Do people not have coffee makers at home?

Basically everyone where I live has a drip coffee maker or moka pot or some kind of coffee making device which they use to make coffee at home every morning and then they go to work and drink the free coffee there for the rest of the day.

Personally I drink around 4 cups a day but I only buy coffee from a coffee shop maybe twice a month even though I walk past coffee shops on my way to work each day. For most people I know, going to a coffee shop is more of a special occasion type thing for meeting someone or just treating yourself. It seems kinda crazy to me to do it several times a week.

Are Americans really buying so much takeout coffee that it's a financial burden and a pit stop to work every day?",33,1731896357.0,NoStupidQuestions,142,0.75,False

I’m a huge fan of the show and actually made a throw away to post this, I could really use your input and appreciate any advice or honesty people have to give!

Fake names for obvious reasons. Also I’m so sorry how long this got :( 

I (18f) went to a club last weekend with a group of friends one of which included Jimmy (19m). Jimmy was talking with me before we went in about what classes I was taking next semester. I told him I hadn’t done my registration yet but would try to this week. Jimmy told me I should join a certain class because Ben (19m) would be in it and I could try to ask him out.

For context, a couple months earlier, Ben (a friend of Jimmy’s) had hit on me a couple times and I rejected him but eventually I asked if he wanted to grab coffee which he agreed to. However, we cancelled and never ended up rescheduling. Right after this I started talking to Anthony (18m) and I have really started to like him. So when Jimmy suggested this, I told him I’d check out the class but I wasn’t interested in Ben since Anthony and I are talking so much. Jimmy kept pressing and asking “even if Ben asked you out you would say no?” and I kept replying “I’m really not interested in Ben so I’m not going out with him.”

We get in the club and Jimmy is clearly in a bad mood being tense to our friends and just acting weird. At one point, Jimmy looks at me and asks “If you and Ben were in the same class together do you think you would have a hard time being professional with him?” This catches me off guard and I ask why that would be an issue. Jimmy goes on to tell me since I had a “thing” with Ben it may be difficult for me to work closely with him without getting emotional. This gets me really pissed and I keep reiterating I’m not into Ben and my personal and school/work life are two separate things entirely. I told him if anyone made it unprofessional it sure as hell wouldn’t be me not to mention I am already interested in someone else.

On top of all this, the field I’m studying is male dominated making this comment more offensive to me because I don’t think Jimmy would ask that kind of question to a guy. I would’ve said more to Jimmy in the moment had we not been in such a busy space (especially considering he was interested in a classmate but it didn’t work out) but I think going back and trying to retroactively talk with him may make things worse. I’m also very bad when it comes to confrontation and tend to bottle things up best I can. I feel like I may be overreacting about the whole thing since I doubt he meant it to come across that way but I’m really bothered. My friends all sided with me but I want outside opinions.

No super serious diagnosis, illness, disease or anything. I'm just not built that great genetically LOL. I deal with tons of stomach issues, eye issues, ear issues, skin issues, muscular issues, joint issues, the list go on. Because of this, I'm pretty strict about my diet, sleep, exercise, and reducing stress to keep my body content. I allocate a lot of my free-time to self care. I don't have the luxury of drinking coffee or energy drinks, eating whatever I want, or pulling all-nighters as I please.

This is what worries me. I hear about people barely sleeping in medical school, or 20 hours shifts in residency, not having time to eat or rest, tons of stress. Even with the best self-discipline, a lot of it seems inevitable. I think I could handle the process mentally, but not sure if I could handle it physically.

I'm currently a pre-med on track to apply to medical school but this worry has been lingering on my mind and making me wonder if I should pursue this path. I really want to pursue medicine, partially because of my experiences with my own health, but wonder if it's actually realistic to do so.

Until this year, I'd been sticking to traditional methods (like brooms and mops) , during the recent prime day, I finally bought the first robot vacuum. It was actually a combo set: a robot vacuum cleaner, a handheld vacuum, and a mop pad. I thought the design was quite practical and the discount was great (it seems like it's now just over 300 dollars). 

I left it unboxed for a long time until yesterday, when my son's birthday arrived and he invited a bunch of kids over for a party. After the party, I was nearly overwhelmed by the mess: crumbs from cookies and chips scattered everywhere, tomato ketchup stains on the floor, and dog hair brought in by some of the kids. That's when I remembered to unpack the Yeedi c12 combo. I really want to recommend it to you cuz I found it so much more convenient than traditional cleaning methods. I let the robot vacuum cleaner handle the light dusting on the floor, while I used the handheld vacuum with different attachments to clean the gaps between the sofa cushions and the coffee table. After the robot finished its job, I attached the mop pad to the handheld vacuum and did both vacuuming and mopping at the same time. The whole routine took me less than 20 minutes, which would have taken at least an hour before.
