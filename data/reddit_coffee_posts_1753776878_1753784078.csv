1mc7jmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusinessUS/comments/1mc7jmm/getting_your_small_business_online_its_not_as/,Getting Your Small Business Online: It's Not as Scary as You Think!,"I've been seeing a lot of posts lately from folks who are either just starting out or have been running a brick-and-mortar for years, and they all share a similar question: ""How do I get my business online?"" Or, even more commonly, ""I KNOW I need to be online, but where do I even begin?!""

Trust me, I've been there. The idea of building a website, managing social media, and understanding SEO can feel like trying to learn a new language overnight. But I'm here to tell you, it's not nearly as daunting as it seems, and the benefits for your small business are absolutely massive.

Think about it: in today's world, if your business isn't online, you're essentially invisible to a huge chunk of your potential customers. People are searching for everything from local coffee shops to custom furniture builders right from their phones. You want to be there when they're looking!

So, where *do* you start? I'm not going to give you a 10-point technical checklist (there are plenty of those out there!), but rather a mental framework to make this whole process less intimidating:

1. **Start Small, Think Big:** You don't need a custom-built, thousand-dollar website from day one. A simple, professional online presence is better than none. This could be:
   * **A Google My Business profile:** Absolutely essential for local businesses! It's free and gets you on Google Maps.
   * **A basic social media presence:** Pick one or two platforms where your target audience hangs out (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, etc.) and post consistently. Don't try to be everywhere at once.
   * **A simple, template-based website:** Platforms like Shopify, Squarespace, Wix, or even WordPress with a pre-built theme can get you up and running quickly and affordably. Focus on clear information about what you do, how to contact you, and maybe a few photos.
2. **Focus on Your Customer, Not the Tech:** When you're building your online presence, always ask yourself: ""What does my customer need to know or do here?"" Is it to find your hours? See your menu? Book an appointment? Buy a product? Let that guide your decisions, not fancy design trends.
3. **Content is King (and doesn't have to be a novel):** ""Content"" sounds intimidating, but it's just information. Share photos of your products, behind-the-scenes glimpses, testimonials from happy customers, or quick tips related to your industry. Even a few well-worded sentences can make a difference.
4. **Don't Be Afraid to Ask for Help:** This community is full of people who have navigated these waters. There are also tons of free resources online (YouTube tutorials, blog posts, etc.) and often affordable local workshops or consultants. You don't have to be an expert in everything.
5. **It's an Evolution, Not a Revolution:** Your online presence will grow and change as your business does. You'll learn what works and what doesn't. The most important thing is to *start*. Get something out there, learn from it, and iterate.

I truly believe that getting your business online is one of the most impactful things you can do for its future growth. It opens up new markets, builds trust, and makes you accessible to more people.

What are your biggest hurdles when it comes to getting online? Or, if you've successfully done it, what's your number one piece of advice for others just starting? Let's share some wisdom and empower each other!

I (M27) matched with a girl (F28) two weeks ago. Our chat started off really well,  we were texting a couple of times a day, with long and engaging conversations. We quickly agreed to meet for a first date. It was super pleasant: we had coffee and talked for almost 3 hours about all kinds of things. When I got home, I texted her saying I really enjoyed it and would love to see her again. She responded with enthusiasm, saying she felt the same and wanted to meet up again.

The following Monday, I proposed another date for Saturday. She asked if we could do Sunday instead, and I agreed. During the week, we kept chatting regularly. She even suggested fun ideas for future dates (like cooking together) and seemed genuinely invested.

Then, things shifted. On Friday, she mentioned that the weather might not be great and suggested deciding on Sunday morning what to do. I proposed an indoor plan (like minigolf), and she said that sounded good. I followed up with a suggested time, but she didn‚Äôt respond.

On Sunday morning, she finally texted saying she was completely exhausted after the weekend, her social battery was drained, and she felt like she wouldn‚Äôt be good company for a date. She apologized and cancelled. I responded nicely, saying I understood and that she could reach out if she wanted to reschedule.

Since then,  nothing. Complete silence. It's been several days now.

I‚Äôm confused because the vibe seemed great, she was proactive, communicative, and even excited about more dates,  and now it‚Äôs radio silence.
I know sometimes people go through stuff, but I can‚Äôt help but feel ghosted. I‚Äôd love to write something just to get clarity or maybe even reopen the conversation, but I‚Äôm afraid of coming off as needy or pushy.

Am I overthinking this? Is this just ghosting in disguise? Or is it worth reaching out once more?

Any advice or insight would really help,  I‚Äôm honestly a bit frustrated, especially given how many of my recent dating experiences have felt similar.

TL;DR
Great first date, she was enthusiastic and we planned a second one. She cancelled last minute saying she was exhausted, told me to reschedule, then completely disappeared. Not sure if I‚Äôm being ghosted or if something else is going on. Should I reach out?",1,1753783748.0,datingadvice,1,1.0,False

Context: I dream of having my own small shop. I believe I really am excellent at planning. However, I get stuck on the execution because of fear of failing and other external factors.

For small business owners out there, kindly state your type of business (e.g. coffee shop) and how many years has it existed.

How did you overcome imposter syndrome and just went for it?

How did you build it from scratch? How did you plan its structure? How did you finally execute your plans?

What can you advice for someone who is just starting?

What were the problems you encountered at the early stage of your business, and how did you solve them? 

What would you say is the most important thing that contributed the most in the success of your business? (Could be anything like financial support, grit and wit, etc.)

If you could talk to your younger self, what would you have adviced them?

You don't have to answer all the questions haha just want to get different perspectives.

Previous Attempts: I have already made my business plan. From the essentials, canvass, marketing, and financials. It's the execution phase I am worried about.

## Key Features Analysis

The Tables with Iron Base category encompasses a wide array of styles and functionalities. We've analyzed the defining characteristics to provide a detailed understanding.

**Iron Base Construction**

The foundation of any table with an iron base lies in the quality and design of its ironwork. Iron bases can range from simple, clean lines to intricate, ornate patterns, each impacting the overall aesthetic. These bases are typically constructed from wrought iron or cast iron, each offering distinct benefits.Wrought iron is known for its malleability and decorative appeal, allowing for complex designs. Cast iron, on the other hand, offers superior strength and durability, making it ideal for supporting heavier tabletops. The finish applied to the iron base is equally critically important; powder coating provides a durable and corrosion-resistant surface, while antique finishes can enhance the table's vintage charm.

**Tabletop Material**

The tabletop material significantly contributes to the table's style and function. Common options include solid wood, reclaimed wood, glass, and stone. Solid wood tabletops offer warmth and natural beauty, while reclaimed wood brings a unique, eco-conscious character. Glass tabletops provide a sleek, modern look and are easy to clean. Stone tabletops, such as marble or granite, exude elegance and durability, making them suitable for high-end settings.

**Size and dimensions**

The size and dimensions of a table with an iron base must be carefully considered in relation to the intended space. Tables range from small side tables to large dining tables, each designed to accommodate different needs. Smaller tables are ideal for apartments or as accent pieces in larger rooms, while larger tables are suitable for family gatherings or dining rooms.Height is another important factor; standard dining table height is around 30 inches, while coffee tables typically range from 16 to 18 inches.

**Weight Capacity**

The weight capacity reflects the table's ability to withstand loads over time. For dining tables, it's essential to consider the weight of dishes, serving ware, and the occasional leaning guest.Tables with sturdy cast iron bases and solid wood or stone tops typically offer higher weight capacities, ensuring long-term stability and preventing sagging or warping. Manufacturers usually provide detailed specifications regarding weight capacity to guide purchasing decisions.

**Design Style & Aesthetics**

The design style significantly impacts how well the table integrates with existing decor. Tables with iron bases can range from industrial and rustic to modern and contemporary. Industrial-style tables often feature raw, unfinished iron and distressed wood, while modern designs incorporate sleek lines and minimalist forms. rustic tables may include reclaimed wood and ornate ironwork, while contemporary tables often combine iron with glass or polished stone. The choice of design style should complement the overall aesthetic of the room.

**Assembly and Maintenance**

Ease of assembly is an important consideration, especially for online purchases.Some tables require minimal assembly, such as attaching the tabletop to the base, while others may require more extensive assembly. Clear instructions and included hardware are essential for a smooth setup process. Maintenance requirements also vary depending on the materials used. Wood tabletops may require regular polishing or oiling, while iron bases may need occasional cleaning to remove dust and prevent rust.

## Core Benefits

Tables with iron bases offer numerous advantages that make them a popular choice for homeowners seeking durability, style, and functionality.

**Durability and Longevity**

The inherent strength of iron ensures that the base of the table is incredibly durable. High-quality iron bases can withstand considerable weight and resist bending or breaking, ensuring many years of reliable use. this longevity translates to savings over time,as you won't need to replace the table frequently.This is a significant advantage over tables with flimsy bases that can easily break down.

**Aesthetic Versatility**

Iron bases complement various design styles. Whether you are decorating a rustic farmhouse, a modern loft, or a traditional dining room, a table with an iron base can fit seamlessly into the decor. The dark color of the iron provides a neutral backdrop that allows the tabletop material to stand out, creating a visually appealing focal point.**Enhanced stability**

The weight and robust construction of an iron base provide extraordinary stability. This is particularly important for larger tables where uneven weight distribution can cause wobbling. Iron bases are typically designed with wide footprints or multiple points of contact with the floor,minimizing the risk of tipping or shaking. This promotes a comfortable and safe dining or working experience.

**Unique Character**

No two iron bases are exactly alike, especially those handmade. This provides unique character that can‚Äôt be replicated in mass-produced furniture. The variations in iron texture, weld marks, and finish details contribute to the table's individuality, making it a conversation starter. This is attractive to those who want a personal touch to their space.

**Sustainability considerations**

Many tables with iron bases incorporate reclaimed wood or sustainably sourced materials. This appeals to eco-conscious consumers who want to minimize their environmental impact. Reclaimed wood comes from old buildings or salvaged timber,reducing the need for new tree felling. Iron is also a recyclable material, further enhancing the table's sustainability credentials.

## FAQs Section

Here's some answers to common questions about tables with iron bases.

**Are Tables with iron Bases Suitable for Outdoor Use?**

It depends on the type of iron base and tabletop material.If the iron base is powder-coated and the tabletop is made of weather-resistant material like teak or treated stone, then it can be used outdoors. However, wrought iron without proper sealant can rust. Also, some wood tabletops may warp in wet conditions.

**How Do You Clean and Maintain an Iron Table Base?**

Regular dusting with a soft cloth is usually sufficient for general cleaning. For more stubborn stains, use a mild soap solution and a damp cloth. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners that can damage the finish. For wrought iron, periodically apply a rust-inhibiting sealant to prevent corrosion.

**What are the Common Tabletop Material Choices for tables with Iron Bases?**

Common choices include: solid wood (like oak, maple, or walnut), reclaimed wood, glass, marble, granite, and concrete. Each material has its own pros and cons in terms of durability, aesthetics, and maintenance. Wood offers warmth, glass provides a modern look, and stone adds elegance.

**Can I Customize the Iron Base Design for a Specific Table?**

The ability to customize depends on the manufacturer or vendor. Some companies offer options for customizing the size, shape, and finish of the iron base to match your specific preferences. Customization may come at a higher cost but allows for a truly unique and tailored piece of furniture.

It contained photocopies of bank statements, old letters, and a transcribed interview with a neighbor who claimed to have seen Testa near the Anderson home the night of the murders, information that, for some reason, had never been fully followed up on in the official reports I‚Äôd glimpsed in the news three years ago. This wasn't just a true crime book; it felt like a meticulous, almost obsessive, private investigation compiled by someone deeply invested in the case, perhaps even by a family member trying to find justice.

A cold dread settled in my stomach, quickly replaced by a surge of adrenaline. This wasn‚Äôt just a forgotten piece of history; it felt like a live wire. Jacob Testa, if this book was to be believed, was a murderer who had slipped through the cracks. The sheer audacity of it, the thought that a killer had walked free for three years while a family's tragedy remained ""unsolved,"" ignited a furious urgency within me.

I slammed the book shut, the sound echoing unnervingly in the silent basement. Every fiber of my being screamed to act. This wasn't a matter of academic curiosity anymore; it was a race against time, though three years too late. I couldn‚Äôt just leave this information buried here. I had to take this to the authorities, even if it meant sounding like a madwoman clutching an ancient, dust-laden book.

Clutching the heavy volume, I scrambled up the creaking stairs, the dusty sunlight of the main library now seeming blindingly bright and strangely indifferent. I bypassed the quiet reading tables, ignored the librarian‚Äôs raised eyebrow as I practically sprinted out of the grand oak doors, the musty scent of the basement still clinging to my clothes.

My mind raced through the details, replaying the chilling passages about Jacob Testa as I hailed a cab. The local police station, a squat, brick building I‚Äôd only ever driven past, loomed closer with every turn of the wheels. Doubt flickered‚Äîwould they even listen? A civilian showing up with a decades-old book as ""evidence""? But the urgency in my gut was too strong to ignore.

Inside the station, the air was surprisingly quiet, punctuated by the faint hum of computers and the murmur of distant conversations. I approached the front desk, the heavy book clutched tightly against my chest.

""I... I need to speak to someone about the Anderson case,"" I stammered, feeling a little foolish. The officer behind the counter, a middle-aged woman with tired eyes, looked at me skeptically.

""The Anderson case, ma'am? That's been closed for years.""

""No, it's not solved!"" I insisted, pushing the book forward. ""I found this in the library's basement. It's about Jacob Testa, the uncle. There's information here, vital information, I think. Evidence that was overlooked.""

My voice, though wavering, held a conviction that must have caught her attention. She hesitated, then sighed, picking up the phone. ""I'll see if Detective Miller is available. He was on that case, originally.""

Minutes later, a gruff-looking man with a neatly trimmed mustache emerged. Detective Miller. His initial expression mirrored the desk officer's skepticism, but as I haltingly explained my discovery, flipping to the key pages about Jacob Testa, his eyes began to narrow. He took the book, his thumb tracing the faded, handwritten title with a sudden interest. He asked questions, sharp and direct, about the book's origin, my reasons for being in the basement, and which specific details had caught my eye. I pointed to the transcribed neighbor interview, the financial discrepancies, and the detailed timeline of Testa's movements.

He didn't dismiss me. Instead, he excused himself, taking the book with him. An hour later, which felt like an eternity, he returned, his face grim. ""We're cross-referencing this information with our original files,"" he said, the gruffness replaced by a quiet intensity. ""Some of these details... they weren't highlighted, or perhaps just seen as circumstantial at the time.""

The waiting continued, stretching into agonizing hours. I nursed a lukewarm coffee, pacing the small waiting area, the weight of the book's secrets still heavy in the air. Finally, just as the evening shadows began to lengthen outside the station windows, Detective Miller reappeared, a flicker of something triumphant, yet weary, in his eyes.

""We issued an alert based on your lead,"" he announced, his voice low, ""and followed up on a few new angles suggested by this book. Turns out, Mr. Testa never left town. He's been living under the radar, quiet as a mouse."" He paused, a faint smile touching his lips. ""We apprehended Jacob Testa about an hour ago. He was at his apartment, watching TV, just like any other night. He matched the description, and when we questioned him about certain details from¬†*this book*,"" he tapped the cover, ""he broke.""

A wave of relief so profound it nearly buckled my knees washed over me. Three years. Three years this man had walked free, living a seemingly normal life while the Anderson family‚Äôs murders remained an icy cold case. And now, because of a forgotten book in a dusty library basement, justice, however belated, was finally within reach. The silence of the library, the musty scent of old paper, the thrill of discovery ‚Äì they had led me not just to knowledge, but to the truth that finally laid a killer to rest.",1,1753783458.0,Storiestobe,0,1.0,False

Only realized when her driveway looked suspiciously empty,"Let me set the scene: My friend works night shifts and runs purely on coffee, chaos, and the will of whatever sleep-deprived spirit keeps her functional. She gets off work at 7AM. We had plans to watch a movie at 5PM. I asked if she was sure she could survive the film. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good,‚Äù she said, already blinking like someone halfway between planes of consciousness.
So we meet up. Movie? Watched. Samgyupsal? Devoured. Walked around the mall hunting for pet supplies because her dog refuses to use any brand of shampoo that doesn‚Äôt cost half my paycheck. We were drained but still joking around. At around 10PM, we finally decide to head home.
We take a Grab together, since we live the same way. I get dropped off last. Chill night, right?
Wrong.
Fifteen minutes later, I get a message from her:
‚ÄúBro. I have to go back.‚Äù
I thought she left her phone, or her dog‚Äôs gold plated shampoo. But no. She goes:
‚ÄúI brought my car.‚Äù
She drove herself to the mall. Parked. Walked in. Spent five hours with me. Rode a Grab home. And only realized something was wrong when she got to her house and stood in the driveway wondering why it felt off.
Her car? Still peacefully waiting in the parking garage like, ‚ÄúMa‚Äôam?‚Äù
So she had to book another Grab, do the full ride of shame back to the mall, and retrieve her poor abandoned vehicle. I imagine it sobbed oil tears when it saw her again.
And the worst part? We spent an unnecessary amount of time earlier debating which ride app to book. She even sighed about how long it was taking. Girl. You had your own car.
Moral of the story? Don‚Äôt underestimate what two hours of sleep, grilled meat, and mall lighting can do to your brain. Sometimes it‚Äôs not just a ""senior moment."" Sometimes it‚Äôs a whole sitcom.",1,1753783455.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Now they won‚Äôt stop.,"I woke up, rolled over, and hit snooze on my alarm. ""7:45 AM,"" it read. The brightness blinded me, the digital sun flashing across my vision, until I closed my eyes, and my phone turned off. The headache was insufferable. 



""Shit,"" I muttered. I was late for class, again.



My roommates had all moved out, and I was looking for potential people to move in. The place was getting too expensive to pay each month, and a new roommate would have helped drastically. I painstakingly got out of bed and slipped on my indoor shoes, an old pair of worn and scarred slippers, the red they once were fading and appearing more washed pink than anything resembling the strawberry tint they once glowed. Dragging my feet across the puke-stained carpet and down the stairs to the first floor, I reached for a mug and placed it underneath the coffee-maker's nozzle. A note was stuck to the top of the silver machine. I hadn't remembered seeing it before. I picked it up and read, with no hesitation.



""Careful :)""



I stood for minutes, just staring at the note, forgetting I had pressed the pour button before reading. The purely black liquid dripped from the mug onto my hand, and I dropped the note as it burned me, also spilling onto the note. I watched it disintegrate in front of my cup, in sugarless, milkless coffee. I shrugged it off, probably drunkenly placed it there as I had gotten extremely hungover the previous night, Sunday. I went about my day, not thinking about the note I had found earlier, and I shrugged it off, completely.



Until the next day



Another note, this time on my lamp. ""You Shouldn't Know."" I froze, to the point of shivering. Looking like a deer blinded by headlights, the text was underlined furiously. What would you do if you found notes in your home that you didn't place? I had nobody to turn to. I jumped up and started pacing around my house, checking every place someone, or something, could be. There were no signs of any intrusion, the door was locked, the windows too, and the attic was even shut - not that anyone would be able to get through it anyway, it was high up, and if you had dropped down, there would have been visible signs, damage to the floor. Fuck, I even checked my closet like you would if you were a child, scared of monsters. Except I was an adult, and I knew there were no monsters in this world. No amount of checking would bring anything up, there genuinely was nothing. Throughout the day, during lecture and at work, that note crept up in my mind like an unwanted memory from too long ago. An uninvited guest, just showing up at the worst time, at YOUR worst time. Truthfully it  spooked me. I tossed and turned that night in my bed, like angst had taken over my entire body, waiting for something to happen, until nothing did. I fell asleep. I woke up, before my alarm even went off, it was 5:45 AM. I clicked on my lamp and as I did there was a note, on the switch. 



""You Checked"" 

""Is this a game,"" I thought. Mentally grasping at straws trying to explain to myself why it was happening. Just like I did the previous night, I went through everything. This time, the living room carpet. It was stepped muddy. The green carpet resembled a grass patch right after rain, dirty and a stain in an otherwise perfectly clean house and room. Like a reject standing out in a busy crowd, an outlier amongst the norm. A note, against the fridge, like a mother would when you were younger.



""Y o u N e v e r L e a r n""

What the fuck, I muttered. Why was this happening? I couldn't take this anymore. I tore my house apart. My furniture was knocked over, plates shattered, the broken porcelain covering the ground like sea over sand during high tide. I went back to sleep, and the notes were gone. Everything was fine. I had no lectures, and took off work that day. Figured I deserved a break. For once in this never ending week. A repetitive cycle, it crushed me, though I would never admit it. 



The following day, my room was covered in notes. All stuck to the wall. Scribbles small but so much. I stood up, shaking, into my bathroom. The notes on the mirror all the same, ""You did this. Y o u m u s t f a c e i t."" I hit the mirror, my hands bled a dry, dark red substance, running all over my shaking hands as they trembled from pain. Inside another note.

I was sitting there again. The dry grass of the empty field rustled softly in the late morning breeze.

I had quit the convenience store job. I simply didn‚Äôt show up one morning. As if the universe had been waiting for it, my phone chimed. It was the familiar question:


‚ÄúAvailable shift tomorrow. Interested?‚Äù


At that moment, I felt like the place was calling me back. It had been waiting for me.
So the next morning, I found myself once again in the train station parking lot. The fat man just laughed at my return, but since he was busy stuffing a cheeseburger into his mouth, he wasn‚Äôt very talkative. I went through the usual motions and headed through the small town toward the field.
It looked exactly the same. This place hadn‚Äôt changed at all in a few months. My stomach twisted in both anxiety and comfort. I was glad to be back‚Ä¶ but who knew what was waiting for me this time?

With a bit of coffee from my thermos, half-hanging out of the car door, I started reading through the day‚Äôs instructions. This day looked like it would be just as strange. I didn‚Äôt even bother reading the early morning time slots‚Äîthey never concerned me. Those were the wrap-up tasks from the previous shift. My shift always starts around 11.



12:42 ‚Äì To maintain a clean work environment, please collect any trash from the field. Trash bags can be found on the back seat of the service vehicle.
I glanced at my watch: 12:31. But the field was spotless‚Äînot a single piece of trash in sight, nothing that looked like it needed picking up.

Oh well, I thought. Something always turns up, like it always does.

15:11 ‚Äì If the gardening lady is present, please ask for her name. If it‚Äôs not Amanda, politely ask her to leave. If it is Amanda, greet her and let her go about her business.

I sighed deeply. Here comes the hard part of the shift again.

Ten minutes passed while I finished my coffee and leaned against the car, enjoying a little siesta. I watched the clouds drift lazily across the sky and listened to the birdsong. But without realizing it, my watch ticked over to 12:42.

And in the blink of an eye, trash started pouring from the sky.

I jumped back into the car in a panic as a rotten watermelon exploded on the ground right next to me. Most of it fell toward the middle of the field, but I heard the occasional thud of something hitting the roof of my car. One greasy, melted cheese wrapper even slapped onto my windshield.


It lasted barely a minute, but a nice little landfill had formed out there.
When I finally crawled out of the car, the stench hit me‚Äîabsolutely revolting. But the thought that I was the one who had to clean all this up? That was somehow worse.

It took me about an hour and a half to go over the entire field with a black trash bag, collecting every disgusting bit I could find. I won‚Äôt go into details‚Äîit was just typical household waste, but I have no idea where it could‚Äôve come from.

After I was done, I rested in the car for a bit. I left the two big trash bags a little farther away so I wouldn‚Äôt have to smell them right next to me.

To wind down, I ate a sandwich and picked up the guide again to keep reading.



18:45 ‚Äì If Amanda is still present, please inform her that it‚Äôs time to head home. If she‚Äôs no longer there, you have no further duties ‚Äî continue monitoring the area.
20:47 ‚Äì Please check the sunset. If it sets in the direction of the road, there‚Äôs nothing to worry about, continue your duties. If it sets toward the forest, leave immediately. If it sets from any other direction, please notify the contact number.
23:09 ‚Äì If anyone is on the premises, please instruct them to leave.
01:37 ‚Äì Please climb the ladder and stay there for one hour. For your own safety, do not come down, no matter what.
07:44 ‚Äì Please count how many times the bird on the field chirps, and send the result to the contact number.

It didn‚Äôt seem like a difficult day‚Ä¶ but I really hoped I wouldn‚Äôt run into those rabbit-masked figures again tonight.

I was resting in the car, feet dangling out the window, playing games on my phone. That‚Äôs when I realized it was 15:14 ‚Äî I should‚Äôve already taken care of the task. I jumped out of the car like a kid who just got caught doing something wrong.
The field was still calm and oddly peaceful ‚Äî as much as a place like this could ever be.

But the moment I looked around, I felt my heart skip a beat.

A young, attractive woman stood at the back of my car, staring at me with a teasing smile on her face.
Once I snapped out of it, I gave her a little wave and spoke up:


""Excuse me, ma‚Äôam,"" I said, adjusting the flashlight on my belt. ""May I ask your name?""


The woman casually leaned against the side of my car and looked me over from head to toe.


""No,"" she said coldly ‚Äî then suddenly burst into laughter.


I eyed her warily. She was barefoot, wearing a light, summer dress with a floral print. Her wild, fiery red hair whipped in all directions in the wind.


""I‚Äôm Amanda,"" she laughed again, and then, as if to toy with me, she turned and darted off toward the center of the field.


I didn‚Äôt know what to make of this. It didn‚Äôt feel like one of those strange assignments, or like the nighttime visitors that gave me chills. Amanda seemed both completely human and‚Ä¶ something else.
If I met a woman like her in a normal setting, I might ask her out on a date.
But this wasn‚Äôt a normal place. And nothing here was something I wanted to get involved with.



Amanda ran to the center of the field. It was only then that I noticed a small flower garden there. I was certain it hadn‚Äôt been there before ‚Äî a neat flowerbed full of colorful blossoms.

As if it were the most natural thing in the world, Amanda was already planting flowers next to it. She had proper gardening tools too, which ‚Äî again ‚Äî made no sense to me.

I just stood there, watching her work. There was something calming about the whole thing.


‚ÄúWhy are you staring like that?‚Äù Amanda asked a few minutes later, glancing up at me.


‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not‚Ä¶ I wasn‚Äôt staring,‚Äù I stammered awkwardly.


She smiled sweetly. I pretended I hadn‚Äôt been looking at her and focused instead on the peaceful field. The sun was warm ‚Äî not a scorching summer heat, just pleasantly warm.


‚ÄúAmanda?‚Äù I said suddenly, surprising even myself. ‚ÄúWhere did you come from?‚Äù


Amanda gave me an annoyed look.


‚ÄúFrom space,‚Äù she replied, frowning and staring at me.


I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I just looked into her light blue eyes and delicate, narrow face. Then, suddenly, her scowl vanished and turned into a playful smile ‚Äî no, more like a giggle.


‚ÄúYou‚Äôre weird, new guy,‚Äù she laughed heartily. ‚ÄúWhere else would I come from? Just like everyone else. I had a mom and a dad.‚Äù


She kept laughing. I stood there silently, deep in thought, watching her. I couldn‚Äôt tell if Amanda didn‚Äôt know where she really was, or if none of this seemed strange to her at all.


‚ÄúAnd what‚Äôs your name, new guy?‚Äù Amanda asked after her laughter subsided.


‚ÄúSteve,‚Äù I replied quickly.


‚ÄúNice to meet you, Steve,‚Äù Amanda said softly. ‚ÄúYou seem like a good guy.‚Äù


Her words were genuinely comforting. Still, I felt it would be best to keep some distance from her. The poor girl might not even know what she‚Äôs a part of ‚Äî or where she really is.


Time flew by. Amanda occasionally asked me things ‚Äî who I was, where I grew up, what my childhood was like. I also learned a few things about her. She was born in England; her father worked on a ship, and her mother was a housewife. When she was eleven, they moved to the States. They came to try their luck ‚Äî but life hadn‚Äôt been easy. After that, Amanda didn‚Äôt want to talk anymore, and I didn‚Äôt ask. It seemed better that way. I liked Amanda, and I could tell it was hard for her to talk about those things.

Helping her with the gardening made time pass even faster. Before I knew it, it was already 6:39 p.m. Amanda had to leave by forty-five.

I stood up from beside the little garden. The sun was already much lower than when we started.


‚ÄúAmanda,‚Äù I said gently, ‚Äúit‚Äôs almost time for you to go.‚Äù


‚ÄúOh, right,‚Äù Amanda said with a hint of surprise.


She stood up from the flowers too, brushed off her dress and her dirty hands, then stepped over and gave me a hug. Her body was warm and soft.


‚ÄúTake care, Steve,‚Äù she said kindly.


Then she started walking toward the forest.


‚ÄúAmanda!‚Äù I called after her.


She turned and waited for what I had to say.


‚ÄúAmanda, do you know what this place is? Or what‚Äôs going on here?‚Äù


Amanda only smiled softly.


‚ÄúYes,‚Äù she said after a pause, ‚Äúbut I won‚Äôt be the one to tell you those things. If you start seeing more than just the money in this place, you‚Äôll figure it out yourself.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say anything. Amanda walked into the forest ‚Äî but before disappearing, she turned back one last time and waved kindly.
I waved back. It felt familiar ‚Äî like someone had waved to me like that before.


I stood outside my car, watching the sky. I was certain now that the sun was setting on the side of the road, so I could continue my shift. Still, it felt nice to just stand there in the warmth of the day's last rays.

Amanda came to mind. The girl who didn‚Äôt belong here, yet somehow did. What stuck with me most was her last sentence ‚Äî that I‚Äôd figure out the secret of this place on my own. A part of me was afraid of that. Of what the company would do if I really found out what was happening here.

But the money‚Ä¶ the money was really good.

Then there were the people who appeared here. Some of them just vanished, like the old man or the woman in red. But Amanda and the rabbit-masked ones‚Ä¶ they walked into the forest. Was there something in the forest?


I stood there until it was completely dark around me.
Panic started creeping in, so I figured it was best to get back in the car. There wasn‚Äôt any task tonight involving the rabbit-masked people. But I swear ‚Äî I was scared of them. I had dinner in the car and watched a show ‚Äî trying to distract myself from this place.
Time passed slowly in the car until it was 11:09 p.m. I had to return to my duties. I was nervous, deeply anxious. I hoped that no one would be out there ‚Äî that I‚Äôd finally have a night without having to walk out to someone in the middle of the field and ask them to leave.

But no. I wasn‚Äôt that lucky. As soon as I stepped out of the car to take a look around, I saw that tonight wouldn‚Äôt be easy either.
Someone was sitting in a large armchair in the middle of the field, watching TV. I couldn‚Äôt see clearly who it was, but the television was definitely on. Right there in the middle of nowhere, someone was watching a cooking show.

Rubbing my tired eyes, I walked toward them. I thought I was prepared for anything ‚Äî or so I believed.

But as I got closer to the chair, an awful sense of d√©j√† vu came over me. Like I had seen this before ‚Äî lived it already.

Even the back of the armchair looked horribly familiar. And when I finally saw who was sitting in it, I went pale.


‚ÄúMom?‚Äù I asked, my voice cracking.


I remembered this place now. It was years ago. I was a senior in high school. One day I came home, and Mom was in a really bad mood. She sat in the armchair, smoking, watching a cooking show. I didn‚Äôt bother her ‚Äî I just sat on the floor beside her, and we watched TV together until evening.


‚ÄúMom, what are you doing here?‚Äù My voice was still shaking.


‚ÄúWhat? Where? Steven, why are you looking at me like that?‚Äù she asked, startled, as if she had only just noticed I was standing there.


My eyes welled up with tears. My mother had been dead for over six months. I dropped to my knees in front of the armchair and hugged her. We must have looked absurd ‚Äî me hugging my mother who was watching TV in the middle of a field.


‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, Steven?‚Äù she asked gently. ‚ÄúWhy are you crying?‚Äù


I didn‚Äôt answer. The whole situation was impossible.
Minutes passed, I think, there in the moonlight. But a notification on my phone pulled me back to reality. I stood up from beside my mother, who just smiled at me softly. I pulled out my phone. The message was from the usual number:


‚ÄúSteven, no one is allowed to remain on the field. Please instruct them to leave immediately!‚Äù


I rubbed my tired face. My dead mother was sitting in front of me, watching television in the middle of nowhere. The company I work for expected me to send away the woman who raised me.


‚ÄúMom, how did you get here?‚Äù I asked again.


She just shrugged vaguely, then started looking for the remote. 
She looked young. Younger than when I‚Äôd last seen her, before she died. Her behavior matched the other night visitors I‚Äôd seen here ‚Äî confused, vacant-eyed. As if she‚Äôd just‚Ä¶ ended up here somehow.
This wasn‚Äôt my real mother. She‚Äôs buried in the ground, far away from this place.
I felt a spark of anger. This place was toying with me now. Like it wanted to break me. So I started in on the usual script.


‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶ or, ma‚Äôam, I have to ask you to leave. This is private property.‚Äù


My mother looked at me, wide-eyed. I tried to hold myself together. This isn‚Äôt my mom. I had to stay strong.


‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, please leave the area.‚Äù


‚ÄúAll right, Steven,‚Äù she said quietly. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs what you want, I‚Äôll go.‚Äù


My lip trembled, my eyes welled again, but I couldn‚Äôt let go.


‚ÄúSteven?‚Äù she asked again. ‚ÄúCould you help me up from the chair?‚Äù


I took her hand to help her. She stood before me, looked me in the eyes, and the last thing she said was:


‚ÄúI love you, son.‚Äù


I closed my eyes.
Her hand vanished from mine.
A few moments later, I opened my eyes again. She was gone. The chair was gone. The TV too. Only the headlights of my car lit up the edge of the field.


I walked back to my car. I got in and just stared blankly ahead. This wasn‚Äôt like the other times. I wasn‚Äôt scared, or nervous, or angry that I didn‚Äôt understand what was happening. This time, it felt like something had broken inside me. Or maybe something had simply been lost.

I don‚Äôt know how long I sat there like that. My head felt completely empty ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt think of anything. I just sat and stared. Everything that had happened today had shaken me. I felt like maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have come back at all. Would I have been better off at that crappy store job?


I looked toward the field again. In the center stood a simple plastic ladder.
Is it that time already? I glanced at my watch. I quickly jumped out of the car and walked over to the ladder.

It really was just a ladder. We had one just like it in the store‚Äôs stockroom ‚Äî and now here it was, standing in the middle of the field.
Since the instructions had said to climb it, I did. I climbed all the way to the top. Once there, I set an alarm on my phone to make sure I waited the full hour.

Time passed slowly. At first, I just stood on top of it. Then, though it was uncomfortable, I sat down on the top step and waited. I sat there, in the dark field, at the top of a ladder. The car‚Äôs headlights glowed in the distance behind me, and above, the stars.


That‚Äôs when I saw someone approaching.
The figure was limping ‚Äî struggling to move through the grassy field.
I stood on the ladder and pointed my flashlight toward them ‚Äî and immediately regretted it.

A man was walking toward me. He was covered in blood ‚Äî or at least I think it was blood. His intestines were hanging out, dragging on the ground behind him. Half his face was missing, and he was completely naked.

I nearly lost it on top of that ladder. I wanted to run back to the car. But the instruction had been clear: Do not leave the ladder, no matter what happens.
So I stayed. I sat up there like a lunatic.

The man walked right up to the base of the ladder. Then he stopped ‚Äî as if someone had told him, this is far enough. He just stood there, reeking. He stank of rot.
My legs were shaking. Sweat poured off me. That thing just stood there, staring. 
Minutes passed. Eventually, I gave up being tense. I sat back down on the step, but I was very careful not to let my legs hang down.


‚ÄúYou waiting for someone?‚Äù I asked, surprising even myself.


He didn‚Äôt reply. He just stood there.
And then, just like that, he left. He gathered up his guts and started dragging himself back toward the woods. Once he was far enough away, my phone alarm went off. My hour was up.

Not much longer now, and I‚Äôd finally be able to go home.


The last hours are always the hardest.

07:44 had already passed. I stepped outside to count how many times the bird in the field chirped. I had to listen carefully ‚Äî it was barely audible. If I counted right, it made one repeating chirp every minute. I sent the result to the designated number. The reply simply praised my work and told me to continue.

After that, I got back in the car. I was already getting sleepy. I ate all the sandwiches I had, and only one energy drink remained ‚Äî I was saving it for the drive home.

I thought about the events of the night. What was my mom doing here? I had assumed that all the figures who appeared here were somehow tied to the company, or at least people I was meant to watch over ‚Äî not just the field itself. But my mom was dead.
Could it be that all the other figures who showed up‚Ä¶ were also dead? Amanda too?
And then who ‚Äî or what ‚Äî are those rabbit-masked creatures?


Eventually, 11:00 rolled around. I received the usual text: my shift was over. I could go home.

The drive back was always exhausting, but this one was pure hell. I could barely keep my eyes open, and even the energy drink didn‚Äôt help. But somehow, I made it back to the train station. The fat man was already waiting, looking sleepy. He mumbled something about partying with his friends because it was Friday. I didn‚Äôt really listen ‚Äî I was too tired, and this shift had left me completely drained.

I somehow stumbled home in a daze. Once I got inside, I pulled out the envelope ‚Äî I didn‚Äôt want to count several thousand dollars in the middle of the street.

But what I found surprised me. There was only two thousand dollars inside, and a note.


‚ÄúSteve, you forgot this morning‚Äôs package. This has been deducted from your pay. Please be more attentive to your duties next time.‚Äù
‚Äî The Company



‚Äú‚Ä¶Fuck you,‚Äù I muttered angrily.


I rested over the next few days. Tried to recover from it all. Or at least, I tried.
I searched the coordinates online, hoping to find something ‚Äî but there was nothing. Nothing useful.
Then I got another message. Again, from the company ‚Äî but this one was different. It was new:


‚ÄúSteve, due to your reliable service, we are offering you a special high-difficulty shift.
IMPORTANT: This shift requires heightened focus. Please only accept if you are confident you can handle it. Special pay rate applies.‚Äù


I hesitated for a moment...But this is why I left the store job, isn‚Äôt it? Something was calling me back. Or someone.

I accepted.Four days later.

There's a guy who's a friend of a friend and I've known him about a year know, he's a bit of a reputation for being a womaniser. He asked me back to his before after we were out with friends, eventually one time, last week, I said yes. I wasn't looking for anything I just didn't really want the night to end.

We went back to his and were chatting for hours. We talked about our issues and life, and had decent actual conversation. He told me he felt really seen and heard . Ended up making out for a solid 40 minutes or longer, turned out we have great chemistry. He got quite cuddly and sweet after this which tbh I assumed was a play for sex because of his reputation. Eventually I decided to go home at like 7am because I don't really like casual sex, which he was respectful of. I told him I liked him so he didnt get the wrong impression and he reciprocated.

He texted me a day or two later and asked me for a coffee. I said yes, we ended up going for drinks as the coffee places were closed. After one drink he asked if I wanted to hang out at his and watch a movie or stay out. I said we could hang out at his as long as that's all it was. That was fine and we went back. We hung out for a number of hours, played a boardgame and watched tv. By 2am this dude was all lovey dovey on me, gazing at me and touching my hair etc. Eventually he kissed me and we made out for awhile where it got kinda sexual. 

At this point I said I'm not really interested in casual sex because it over complicates things. He seemed disappointed it wasn't going to happen but was respectful and understood that sex makes it harder to tell what's real (his words). He got very cuddly with me and told me we have Chemistry and he could kiss me for hours (we did) and that he was physically struggling to pull himself away even though his mouth hurt by this point. On response to what I said about casual sex he also said he's not looking for anything casual (also said albeit hes not looking to get married either, i think he was a bit flustered with the question and rambled a bit) and his face seemed to light up when I wasn't looking for anything casual. He wanted me to stay the night (it was 6am by now)  just to cuddle (allegedly) and seemed pretty stuck to me, putting his head on my lap and stuff and said he was pretty sweet on me, and he didn't want to be too much in terms of horniness etc, and hes usually more repressed. Also apologised saying he was just very attracted to me.

He's away atm for a week and told me he wouldn't be able to stop thinking about this and when I was leaving he was like I'm not going to see you for awhile so I need something to keep me going *makes out* and that he can't wait to see me when I get back. He also said he'd like to see where this would go and the whole thing was very unexpected. I also heard him say I love you under his breath once (we have hung out twice.. so I know thats lust based).

I like this guy and I mean I think he likes me but I've been burned so many times and he has a reputation for being a bit of a player (albeit a good guy) and being very emotionally unavailable which seems to contradict his behaviour with me, hence the confusion. We have only hung out one on one twice. I mean it felt effortless and the time flew. But im so scared to trust the way he is being me because all I heard about him from his own male friends was emotional unavailability and it's the reason his last relationship ended.

He's texted me again while he's on holidays and I get the impression he's really looking forward to coming home to see me again. 

Should I put any stock in anything this guy is saying? It's just a lot, none of it feels fake but it's just intense. Should I just have sex with him to see if any of this is real or purely lust? I don't know how to approach this.

I'm not sure I have it in me for another guy to f me over but I like him too. I just know a lot of guys will do a lot of things for sex and I just dont know where that ends and actually liking someone begins for men. ",1,1753782936.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1mc70jj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightmares/comments/1mc70jj/dreamt_my_new_partner_was_my_abusive_ex/,Dreamt my new partner was my abusive ex,"I (28F) wrote partner (26M) for sake of a shorter title. I have been dating someone (unofficial at this moment and both of us have slept with a couple other people here and there) for a little over a month. We see each other quite often and have even gone out of town together, so it is *starting* to get a little more serious.

In November of 2023 I broke up with my extremely psychologically abusive ex of 2.5 years. She had BPD and more than likely NPD (narcissism, and no I do not say this lightly) as well. She would do things that hurt me, I would cry, and she‚Äôd just look at the floor or stare at me with nothing in her eyes ‚Äî no apology, no love. I could probably count on one hand the amount of times she used the words ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Äù throughout our relationship ‚Äî during which she did countless hurtful things like tell her friends I said stuff I never said or did things I never did, which led to them disliking me, telling me I should‚Äôve waited until she had coffee before telling her I felt suicidal after my dad died, making a scene at his memorial because I apparently made her look bad by quietly telling her not to worry about me drinking (I rarely drink) in front of my friends, etc. ‚Äî and it never felt genuine.

From mid-March to late April, I casually dated (emphasis on casual with this one) a man. A few weeks in, we had our first sleepover. That night, I had a nightmare that I was looking at him, turned my head the other way, then looked back and his head had turned into my ex‚Äôs. She was giving me that blank stare and I was frozen in terror. My therapist told me it was probably because I was scared this person would hurt me like she did, which he did not, but he did turn out to be a proper disrespectful ass a few weeks later and I ended things.

This morning, I woke up from a nightmare in which I thought I was in bed with the current guy when someone sitting by the bed asked us how things were going between us and when I turned to look at him, it was my ex instead, same blank stare. I‚Äôd woken up at around 6:30 am from construction outside my flat and saw Instagram messages from him saying ‚Äúomg I‚Äôm so sorry, did that unsend for you? I‚Äôm so embarrassed. My screen is so broken, I meant to send you this‚Äù (a video of his dog). I jokingly responded ‚Äúno it didn‚Äôt‚Äù initially thinking he‚Äôd tell me it was something silly but I fell back asleep shortly after and properly woke up at 9 to a message from him apologizing again. I quickly forgot if the dream was before or after my first wake-up, so I can‚Äôt tell if it was coincidence or if it was after that first text. For context, I saw terrible things I wasn‚Äôt supposed to see on both the aforementioned ex‚Äôs phone and an older violent abusive ex‚Äôs computer. Knowing the person I‚Äôm dating, who has not shown any red flags thus far, sent something he didn‚Äôt want me to see triggered the feelings I had after seeing what I saw on my exes‚Äô things. I know we‚Äôre not official yet, but it still had me in tears the second time I woke up and realized where my feelings were coming from.

I don‚Äôt have a therapist at the moment because I can only see the aforementioned one when I go to my home state so I‚Äôve no one to help me analyze this one. This guy always makes me feel desired, important, prioritized unlike the others even though we‚Äôre not exclusive yet, happy and safe. He‚Äôs got no red flags thus far but I‚Äôm scared that this is some sort of sign from my sub-conscious. I know he‚Äôs different from the others, but I can‚Äôt help but feel triggered and upset.

TL;DR the last time I had a nightmare like this, the situation with that person earlier this year ended badly. I‚Äôve never been very superstitious or spiritual but I feared that the dream was a sign from my gut that I should‚Äôve followed or just a coincidence. New partner is great but something (hopefully) small just triggered so much pain and I don‚Äôt know how to deal with the situation.",1,1753781817.0,Nightmares,0,1.0,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Emma Navarro vs. Rebecca Marino: A Match for the Books (or a Google Search)**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a tennis showdown that‚Äôs less *Wimbledon* and more *Why‚Äôs Rebecca Still Trying?* On Tuesday at the WTA Canadian Open, eighth seed Emma Navarro will face Canadian veteran Rebecca Marino in a second-round clash that‚Äôs as lopsided as a pancake at a steakhouse. Let‚Äôs break it down with the precision of a line judge and the humor of a tennis ball bouncing into a hot dog vendor‚Äôs cart.

---

### Parse the Odds: Why Navarro is the Favorite (Spoiler: Math)

The numbers don‚Äôt lie, and in this case, they‚Äôre screaming. Bookmakers have Navarro as a near-85% favorite, with odds hovering around **-900** (or 1.12 in decimal, which translates to ‚Äúyou‚Äôre probably watching the wrong match if you‚Äôre rooting for Marino‚Äù). Rebecca Marino, the 34-year-old Canadian journeywoman, is a **+500 underdog**‚Äîthe tennis equivalent of betting on a squirrel to win a marathon.

The spread? Navarro‚Äôs -5.5 games on the spread market. That means she‚Äôs expected to win by the same margin as a coffee addict in a Sudoku tournament‚Äî*dominant*. The total games line sits at **19.5-20.5**, with ‚ÄúUnder‚Äù favored, suggesting this won‚Äôt be a grueling five-set epic. More likely: Navarro will serve, Marino will flinch, and the clock will tick toward lunchtime.

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Form, and Why Marino is a Long Shot

Rebecca Marino is a tennis ghost story. She‚Äôs had just **three main-draw wins this year**‚Äîa record that makes a single-malt whiskey‚Äôs ‚Äúlimited edition‚Äù seem generous. Her 2025 campaign has been so sparse, she‚Äôs basically playing for keepsakes and the thrill of hearing her name announced. Meanwhile, Emma Navarro, the 20-year-old American, is a rising star with a **2-0 head-to-head** edge over Marino.

I‚Äôm a personal trainer and coach based in Kent with 8+ years of experience in small group PT, endurance coaching, and bootcamps. I currently run a community-focused setup from the local MUGA (multi use games area) and my home gym, but I‚Äôve outgrown the space and I‚Äôm working toward building a physical facility (something along the lines of Intent91 or Foundry).

My vision is to create a performance-focused training space that blends functional training, small group coaching, and a strong local community. Think: Barbells and racks, skiergs/rowers/assault bikes, Kettlebells/Sandbags/Slam balls/Dumbbells and battle ropes/sled. Minimal machines, to focus on actual coaching. 

I‚Äôm looking to connect with anyone who:

* Is based in Kent and interested in partnering on a physical space
* Has experience in fitness startup investment or similar ventures
* Is building something similar and would be open to sharing insights

Whether it‚Äôs advice, collaboration, or even just a coffee chat, I‚Äôd love to connect.

1mc6uou,https://www.reddit.com/r/airbnbhorrorstory/comments/1mc6uou/airbnb_oddities_fighting_against_impunity/,Airbnb oddities & fighting against impunity,"It is now been 2 months since I came back home, Brittany/ Bretagne after 7 years of living abroad (Scotland) and I am lucky enough to have found a job where I feel at ease and safe. It's a 2 hours and a half drive from my parents so unfortunately for the first month I had to consider my logistics and inevitably had to stay in few Airbnbs prior to co-habitate with friends from August. Going back home after letting go off your past traumas that were put into brackets from back home, and re-wiring your brain in a different culture, different language have developed a brand new me, brand new perspective somewhat less dark. But economical circumstances had made me go back home and so far it's been a tough ride. Although I keep positive because I actually love the job, colleagues are genuine and compassionate and so from last Friday until yesterday morning I stayed a quite goofy place, 20 minutes drive from my job. At first glance, the place feels 40 years old and I get that some people like ""√† la bonne franquette"" vibe. The place seemed more of a hostel rather than a actual residence. From day 1 a German couple have had complained about the hygiene of their room, no bed sheets but tones of ""sheeps"" under the bed... And had left the day after. The lady, one of the 2 hosts, have had asked my own opinion about the state of the house all the while cleaning some old tomato paste that have been neglected from the floor and added ""I can't always after people sh*t ! All the more so since it's a full house one here!"". Indeed there were 6 rooms... Which wasn't mention on the post of the place but given the spatial configuration of the house it feels crowded very quickly, almost claustrophobic. She then insisted that we should go get a drink one of the evenings; however I've had work most mornings... But that's not what shocked me the most. Behind her very sociable abilities and easy demeanor towards people and softness lay a almost perceptible uneasiness and wound. Her husband, the other host, had a very straightforward attitude and it seems like he appreciated beautiful young women... He had asked my colleague, who prior to me staying in the same room, if he could reach out with my number cause it would be ""easier to communicate"". Lol. The walls lack of serious insulation barriers and absorbent materials and I wasn't too sure if it was them but I could hear the door of the bathroom located next to my room clanking repeatedly at 5am.. but it wasn't the worse morning. Yesterday morning as I had to pack my suitcase and get ready for work I first jumped in the bathroom to brush teeth etc, and 2 minutes later saw Isa (the landlady) wanting absolutely to go in the bathroom so I gave way and went back next door, into my room. She seemed somewhat sad, and with a glimpse of worry in her eyes.
As my door stayed open I then saw.. quite unexpectedly her husband, the host, passing by completely naked... He looked at me a bit surprised but not much with a weird grin in his face so I abruptly close the door and locked it. Later, I decided to make myself a coffee in the kitchen and take all my food away from the fridge and he went downstairs put his hand on the counter and looked at me saying ""this stays between us"". While he opened his mouth I could smell the ethanol out of this breath. It was 9am it seemed like he had been drinking the whole night, and couldn't even speak articulately. He then became even more awkward than he usually is sober and have asked me how much I weighted - cause yeah I'm quite skinny, fighting years of anorexia in my younger age due to a trauma that had left indelible scar into my brain- and started talking shit. He had mentioned another renter, another girl,who allegedly was ""canon""(stunning) like me and he had a nightmarish year from Isa cause he had been taking the young lady kayaking behind her back... I started realising the kind of man he was. Thankfully there was another girl staying that I befriended with and who, as ill-at-ease about the situation as me, invited me to go to an event in town and we went back late in the evening on the Saturday. She was very pretty too but had shared with me her darkness and never I would have thought she went in hospital for a year for severe depression. We both have a developed sense of danger when it comes to pinpointing potential predator vibe. And we knew the energy was off at the place. Thankfully she had to leave the place at the same time as me that Monday morning. When I told him I was waiting to tell her bye (but also to make sure she's not left by herself in the place) he had made odd innuendoes and almost insinuated that I did something sexual with her. Uncomfortable, I waited til he went back upstairs to go ""sleep again"" and joined J. to help her pack her stuff until we got the F*CK out of there. He had went back downstairs instead of sleeping waiting outside for something, someone (?) all the while vacillating cause still drunk. After leaving the place I had then to go to work, also to dissociate from what had just happened, and after my shift had to drive 2h30 back at my parents... Unpacking my suitcase I had thought I left my favourite t-shirt I got from a very special place in NM I still had bound with and I started convulsing, again. The thought of having to go back there to take it back was unbearable and made me conflicted about the decision I had to take. Should I take it back or not.. because I had seen him naked and was in shock I allegedly wrapped it in my towel, but couldn't remember at all.. the shock had made me almost amnesiac. He may not have touched me or anything but this stirred up some dark past trauma that it provoked a seizure that unfortunately my parents witnessed... And that trigger pulled out all the pain I had accumulated in France. You don't choose where you're born. And I most definitely don't feel home here anymore... But it's ok. I am doing the shadow work. But I promised to myself is to finally speak out against pervese, for the sake of everyone. I have no more fear and I know for a fact France has still a long way to go to genuinely use its justice system against sexual predators. It is a very dark side that cursed my country of birth and I strongly feel it is my duty to fight it. Because I have felt everything x10000 since. I had started my life from scratch in another country to realise that yes creeps are EVERYWHERE, but they are judge differently from one country to another.The level of impunity in France is blatant. Especially for white and rich men. It is a fact and nobody is going to contradict me for that. But in this year of the snake I have faith that all the veils are being lifted and they can no longer hide behind their dirty bed sheets. I've been a ghost to this country for a while but I am back Joan of Arc vibe and will speak out against for the justice that needs to be restored and transparency to be examplary. You never truly leave your traumas behind when you take your suitcase and fly to another place but you have the power to face them, despite of the pain the may or may not self-inflict, but the power of speech and truth can destroy immoral gestures, habitus, and false convention.",1,1753781185.0,airbnbhorrorstory,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal 15 oz cup boasts a combination of practical features designed to enhance the drinking experience and provide long-lasting value. Understanding these features can greatly aid in selecting the right cup for your individual preferences.

**Material:** The vast majority of 15 oz cups are made from ceramic,glass,stainless steel,or plastic. Ceramic cups are known for their heat retention and aesthetic appeal, while glass offers a clear view of the beverage and doesn't impart any flavor. Stainless steel options are exceptionally durable and often insulated, making them ideal for keeping drinks hot or cold for extended periods. plastic cups are lightweight and frequently enough shatter-resistant,making them a good choice for outdoor use or environments where breakage is a concern.

**Handle Design:** the handle plays a crucial role in the comfort and usability of a 15 oz cup.Ergonomic handles, often featuring contoured designs or wider grips, provide a more secure and agreeable hold. Some cups feature larger handles that can accommodate multiple fingers. Consider the size and shape of your hand when evaluating handle designs.

**Insulation:** For those who value temperature retention, insulated 15 oz cups are an excellent choice.Double-walled construction, often found in stainless steel cups, creates a vacuum that minimizes heat transfer, keeping hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold for longer. Insulation is particularly beneficial for individuals who take their beverages on the go or prefer to sip slowly over an extended period.

**Durability:** The durability of a 15 oz cup depends largely on the material it's made from and the quality of its construction. Stainless steel cups are generally the most durable, followed by high-quality ceramic and thick glass. Look for cups that are resistant to chipping,cracking,and shattering,especially if they will be used frequently or in environments where they are likely to be exposed to impacts.

**Dishwasher and Microwave Compatibility:** Ease of cleaning and heating are important considerations for many users. Cups that are dishwasher safe simplify the cleaning process, while microwave compatibility allows for convenient reheating of beverages.Always check the manufacturer's instructions to ensure that a cup is suitable for use in the dishwasher or microwave.**Design and Aesthetics:** While functionality is paramount, the aesthetic appeal of a 15 oz cup can also contribute to the overall drinking experience. Cups are available in a wide range of colors, patterns, and styles, from minimalist designs to more ornate options.Consider your personal preferences and the overall aesthetic of your kitchen or office when selecting a cup.

## Core Benefits

Choosing the right 15 oz cup offers a multitude of benefits that go beyond simply holding your favorite beverage. These cups offer practicality, convenience, and even enhance the overall drinking experience.

This capacity is ideal for a variety of beverages,including coffee,tea,hot chocolate,and even soups. It is also suitable for individuals who prefer larger servings or those who want to avoid frequent refills.**Improved drinking Experience:** The material and design of a 15 oz cup can considerably impact the enjoyment of your beverage. Ceramic cups, for example, are known for their smooth texture and insulating properties, which help to maintain the temperature of your drink. Glass cups allow you to appreciate the color and clarity of your beverage, while stainless steel cups are durable and provide excellent temperature retention.

**Versatility for Different Settings:** 15 oz cups are versatile enough for use in a variety of settings, from the home to the office to outdoor activities.They are suitable for both hot and cold beverages and can be easily transported, making them a convenient option for on-the-go use.

## FAQs Section

Many consumers have questions when selecting a 15 oz cup. Here are answers to some of the most frequently asked questions.

**What material is best for keeping drinks hot?**
Stainless steel with double-walled insulation is generally considered the best material for keeping drinks hot for extended periods. ceramic also offers good heat retention, but it is not as effective as insulated stainless steel. Glass and plastic cups tend to lose heat more quickly.

**Are all 15 oz cups dishwasher safe?**
Not all 15 oz cups are dishwasher safe. It is important to check the manufacturer's instructions before placing a cup in the dishwasher. Some materials, such as delicate ceramic or certain types of plastic, may be damaged by the high temperatures and harsh detergents used in dishwashers. Hand washing is often recommended for these types of cups.

**How do I choose the right handle size and shape?**
Consider the size and shape of your hand when choosing a handle size and shape. Ergonomic handles that are contoured to fit the hand are generally the most comfortable. A handle that is too small or too large can be challenging to grip and may lead to spills. It is indeed also critically important to consider the weight of the cup when full, as a heavier cup may require a more significant handle.

**Can I use a 15 oz cup in the microwave?**
Not all 15 oz cups are microwave safe. Cups made from certain materials, such as metal or those with metallic accents, should never be used in the microwave. Ceramic and glass cups are generally safe for microwave use, but it is important to check the manufacturer's instructions to be sure. Plastic cups may also be microwave safe, but it is important to use caution as some plastics can leach chemicals into the beverage when heated.

I saw a man near the edge of a busy street he was moving slowly, tapping his cane, and I realized he was blind. He seemed to be drifting closer to the road, so I walked over and asked if he needed help.

The New York Mets and San Diego Padres are set to collide in a matchup that‚Äôs part baseball thriller, part statistical paradox, and 100% ripe for some lighthearted roasting. Let‚Äôs break down why the Mets are the smart bet‚Äîunless you‚Äôre a Padres fan, in which case, maybe bet on your team‚Äôs ability to hit home runs instead of your neighbor‚Äôs fence.

---

### Parsing the Odds: The Math Doesn‚Äôt Lie (Mostly)

The betting lines paint a clear picture: the Mets are the consensus favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.80** (implying a **55-56% implied probability** of winning). The Padres, at **2.05-2.08**, check in with a **48-49% chance**, which is about as exciting as a group project in a nap class.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: The Mets aren‚Äôt just favored because they‚Äôre the ‚Äúcooler jersey.‚Äù They‚Äôve won **65.3% of games when they‚Äôre the favorite**, a stat that screams ‚Äúreliable as your morning coffee shop that never runs out of espresso.‚Äù Meanwhile, the Padres‚Äô struggles against home runs (they allow the second-most in the NL) clash awkwardly with the Mets‚Äô league-leading slugging percentage. It‚Äôs like pairing a loaded cannon with a team that forgets to bring popcorn.

The total runs line is set at **8.0**, with even money on Over/Under. Given the Mets‚Äô top-3 team ERA (3.52) and Sean Manaea‚Äôs pinpoint pitching, expect this game to unfold more like a tense chess match than a fireworks show.

### Digesting the News: Power, Pitches, and a Sprinkle of Absurdity

The Mets are baseball‚Äôs answer to a Swiss watch: precise, powerful, and occasionally dripping with arrogance. They lead the NL in **slugging percentage** (.432), thanks to Juan Soto (25 HRs, 16 doubles) and Pete Alonso (whose home runs could double as emergency shelter). Their pitching staff? A collective sigh of relief for opposing batters‚Ä¶ wait, no, the opposite. The Mets‚Äô ERA is the best in the NL, meaning their pitchers are as welcoming as a locked ATM.

1mc6lwy,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_SwedishCheater/comments/1mc6lwy/my_cheating_background/,My cheating background,"This is where you find my story. How my relationship started, how I started cheating and how it evolved.

So, I met my wife in 2011 when we both started at the same university. We became a couple withing a year and stayed together ever since. She's cute, fun and caring and our sex life was great at the start. But as for many couples, things change. I have a quite high sex drive whereas my wife's has declined, which of course creates friction. 

I first noticed this 2 years into our relationship when my advances didn't lead to sex anymore. Just cuddling. Don't get me wrong - I love cuddling, but when you're horny AF cuddling becomes more of a torture than something nice. My frustration grew even further since I also realized that I'm dominant and wanted to explore rough sex, which again, my then gf wasn't interested in. Our relationship was perfect except our different needs, and we stayed together. My gf was at the time also not well in general so I saw it as my duty as a good bf to give her space and not put my own needs first. 

Fast forward to 2017. We've both graduated and are working in a big city in Sweden. Our sex life is still the same and I'm honesty going crazy, which has started to resent her for it. Again, our relationship is perfect in every other aspect, but not when it comes to sex and my own needs. This is when I take the first step. I create an account on a BDSM forum. Anonymous, of course. I start exploring and soon enough I'm chatting intensely with a cute, slim, young woman who seems to like the same things I do. This quickly evolves into sexting and flirting, and after a couple of weeks we book a date. At this point I'm going back and forth between excitement, arousal and utter panic since I know how wrong this is and the risk I'm taking. 

But - we end up meeting at a caf√© after work (told my wife I'm working late) and the sparks fly. Right there and then I know I won't back out. I fucking need this. I'm going to save the details of what happened after we finished our coffee, but rest assured that I had the best sex in a very long time. And I had officially become a cheater. The period after was filled with guilt, but what chocked me even more was how nothing changed. My wife had no idea and my guilt quickly faded. That's when I started feeling like I could do this again. 

My gf and I got engaged in 2020 and married in 2022, and I've cheated through it all. I've met anything from 20 year old sluts that find it hot to get fucked by a married man, to married mothers of 49 that are cheaters themselves. And I fucking love it. Over the years it my kinks and needs have evolved as well - I no longer cheat to have sex. At least not only because of that. I cheat because cheating is fucking hot. Because it's a rush. Because going behind my lovely wife's back and then coming home and telling her I love her and not having any consequences to my actions just feels amazing. 

So, that's me. Don't like it? Well grow a pair and fucking deal with it. 

My plan is to share both old experiences and new ones in the future. Hope you'll like them!

The St. Louis Cardinals (-168) and Miami Marlins (+240) clash at Busch Stadium in a matchup that‚Äôs less ‚ÄúWorld Series preview‚Äù and more ‚Äútwo broken sinks arguing over water pressure.‚Äù Let‚Äôs break this down with the precision of a umpire on espresso and the humor of a concessions stand during a rain delay.

---

**Parsing the Odds: The Math of Desperation**  
The Cardinals are favored at -168, implying a 62.5% chance to win (thanks, math!). Their 52.9% success rate as favorites suggests they‚Äôre the kind of team that shows up to work even when the coffee machine‚Äôs broken. The Marlins (+240, implying a 39.2% chance) have a 48.4% win rate as underdogs, which is like a gambler betting on ‚Äúlucky‚Äù socks‚Äîoccasionally works, mostly looks silly.

Offensively, the Cardinals average 4.4 runs per game (13th in MLB), while the Marlins, despite 445 total runs this season, rank 19th in scoring. Translation: St. Louis is a slow-cooker offense (steady, reliable, occasionally smells like burnt popcorn). Miami is a squirrel on espresso‚Äîhyperactive, sporadic, and likely to knock over your Gatorade.

Pitching? Both staffs are akin to sieves. The Cardinals‚Äô 4.22 ERA (22nd) and Marlins‚Äô 4.43 ERA (24th) are the MLB equivalents of a leaky roof in a monsoon. But Sonny Gray (Cardinals) and Sandy Alcantara (Marlins) are the difference between a steady drizzle and a hurricane. Gray‚Äôs got the precision of a surgeon‚Ä¶ if that surgeon occasionally forgot which tool they were using. Alcantara? He‚Äôs the ‚ÄúI-quit-social-media‚Äù pitcher‚Äîunpredictable, but hey, at least he‚Äôs not on Twitter ranting about the umpires.

**Digesting the News: Injuries, Idiocy, and Identity Crises**

Now they won‚Äôt stop.,"I woke up, rolled over, and hit snooze on my alarm. ""7:45 AM,"" it read. The brightness blinded me, the digital sun flashing across my vision, until I closed my eyes, and my phone turned off. The headache was insufferable. 



""Shit,"" I muttered. I was late for class, again.



My roommates had all moved out, and I was looking for potential people to move in. The place was getting too expensive to pay each month, and a new roommate would have helped drastically. I painstakingly got out of bed and slipped on my indoor shoes, an old pair of worn and scarred slippers, the red they once were fading and appearing more washed pink than anything resembling the strawberry tint they once glowed. Dragging my feet across the puke-stained carpet and down the stairs to the first floor, I reached for a mug and placed it underneath the coffee-maker's nozzle. A note was stuck to the top of the silver machine. I hadn't remembered seeing it before. I picked it up and read, with no hesitation.



""Careful :)""



I stood for minutes, just staring at the note, forgetting I had pressed the pour button before reading. The purely black liquid dripped from the mug onto my hand, and I dropped the note as it burned me, also spilling onto the note. I watched it disintegrate in front of my cup, in sugarless, milkless coffee. I shrugged it off, probably drunkenly placed it there as I had gotten extremely hungover the previous night, Sunday. I went about my day, not thinking about the note I had found earlier, and I shrugged it off, completely.



Until the next day



Another note, this time on my lamp. ""You Shouldn't Know."" I froze, to the point of shivering. Looking like a deer blinded by headlights, the text was underlined furiously. What would you do if you found notes in your home that you didn't place? I had nobody to turn to. I jumped up and started pacing around my house, checking every place someone, or something, could be. There were no signs of any intrusion, the door was locked, the windows too, and the attic was even shut - not that anyone would be able to get through it anyway, it was high up, and if you had dropped down, there would have been visible signs, damage to the floor. Fuck, I even checked my closet like you would if you were a child, scared of monsters. Except I was an adult, and I knew there were no monsters in this world. No amount of checking would bring anything up, there genuinely was nothing. Throughout the day, during lecture and at work, that note crept up in my mind like an unwanted memory from too long ago. An uninvited guest, just showing up at the worst time, at YOUR worst time. Truthfully it  spooked me. I tossed and turned that night in my bed, like angst had taken over my entire body, waiting for something to happen, until nothing did. I fell asleep. I woke up, before my alarm even went off, it was 5:45 AM. I clicked on my lamp and as I did there was a note, on the switch. 



""You Checked"" 

""Is this a game,"" I thought. Mentally grasping at straws trying to explain to myself why it was happening. Just like I did the previous night, I went through everything. This time, the living room carpet. It was stepped muddy. The green carpet resembled a grass patch right after rain, dirty and a stain in an otherwise perfectly clean house and room. Like a reject standing out in a busy crowd, an outlier amongst the norm. A note, against the fridge, like a mother would when you were younger.



""Y o u N e v e r L e a r n""

What the fuck, I muttered. Why was this happening? I couldn't take this anymore. I tore my house apart. My furniture was knocked over, plates shattered, the broken porcelain covering the ground like sea over sand during high tide. I went back to sleep, and the notes were gone. Everything was fine. I had no lectures, and took off work that day. Figured I deserved a break. For once in this never ending week. A repetitive cycle, it crushed me, though I would never admit it. 



The following day, my room was covered in notes. All stuck to the wall. Scribbles small but so much. I stood up, shaking, into my bathroom. The notes on the mirror all the same, ""You did this. Y o u m u s t f a c e i t."" I hit the mirror, my hands bled a dry, dark red substance, running all over my shaking hands as they trembled from pain. Inside another note.



""Meds 9:00!""

I stared.

I have been keeping track of my fasting for the last 18 days  I started fasting maybe 23 days ago . I get mostly 16-18 hour fast I did one 20 hour and one 25 hour fast . I been sticking to a 16:8 fasting schedule. 

Routine: when im ready to break my fast I been doing a shake with collagen peptides ,protein powder , 30 super food mix  , creatine , and PB fit protein powder just for flavor not full serving.

I will typically eat lunch a few hours after that then not eat anything again till dinner then begin my fast as soon as im done .

I have eliminated most snacking till I eat a meals which I think has been helping I use to snack a lot  more than I thought thats for sure .

I have been only drinking water ,black coffee and tea during fasting and during periods of eating I been doing portion control and low carb for the most part. Been trying to eat lots of protein and more vegetables.

I stopped at a coffee shop early in the morning, maybe 6 AM. Just a quick stop. When I came out, I saw this woman hunched over my car, peeling off the decals on my rear bumper. These weren‚Äôt some cheap stickers either they were custom, reflective anime decals I‚Äôd saved up for. One said ‚ÄúHentai with Senpai‚Äù (yeah, I know, cringe to some), and the others were just anime girls in swimsuits. Nothing explicit. Just stuff that makes me smile when I get in the car.
I approached her and calmly asked, ‚ÄúWhy are you doing that?‚Äù I wasn‚Äôt yelling. I wasn‚Äôt hostile. I genuinely thought maybe I parked in the wrong spot or something.
She looked at me like I was the problem and said, ‚ÄúThat stuff is disgusting. My kid shouldn‚Äôt have to see that kind of filth.‚Äù
I froze. Not because I was scared, but because I couldn‚Äôt believe she thought that justified damaging someone else‚Äôs property.
I told her the decals were expensive and asked her to please pay for what she damaged. I even offered to show her receipts. She just refused, flat-out. No apology. Nothing. The tone in her voice made it clear she thought she was entitled to vandalize my car because she didn‚Äôt approve of the content.
I called over the security guard. He told me to take it to the local community office. I don‚Äôt even live in that area. The coffee shop staff didn‚Äôt want to get involved either. She had her kid with her and kept repeating that she ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt want to escalate.‚Äù But it already was escalated the moment she ripped something off my car.
She walked off like nothing happened, still refusing to talk or take any responsibility. That‚Äôs when something in me snapped.
I saw which car she got into. Right before leaving, I pulled up in front of her, got out, and with the metal spoon I keep in my glovebox for coffee, I slammed the handle onto her hood. Not hard enough to total it but enough to leave a dent and a deep scratch. I looked her in the eye and said, ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt want to pay for mine? You can pay for yours.‚Äù
Her kid started crying. She looked stunned. I got back in my car and drove off. No cameras. No scene. Just a deep pit in my chest and a dented hood behind me.
I know it wasn‚Äôt the ‚Äúadult‚Äù thing to do. I know there was a kid there. And that part especially makes me feel kind of awful. But I also felt violated. Humiliated. Like I had no voice or control. All I wanted was to be treated fairly. She had every chance to make it right, and she refused.
So yeah. I acted out. And maybe I stooped low. But in that moment, it felt like the only way to make her understand how messed up what she did was.

1mc6gev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1mc6gev/extreme_insomnia/,Extreme insomnia,"Hi,

I think you might have encountered a similar question before. I hope you don't mind telling my story though.

I have been taking levothyroxine for years now. My hypothiroidism symptoms might have improved compared to before, but it's hard to tell. A few years ago it turned out I needed a higher dosis of the pills. I tried it and went back to my old dosis a few months after. I was suffering from extreme heat intolerance and sweating, while normally I was always cold and didn't sweat much. My doctor said it was fine.

Now earlier this year the doctor told me I should get back to the higher dosis. I reluctantly agreed, since  I certainly wasn't feeling great. A few months in I could say I was feeling better. Except for one thing: I was totally unable to sleep. At night I felt like I had drunk 10 cups of coffee. I only slept a few hours at night if I was lucky. Funnily enough this was no problem during the day for more than a week. I was feeling great. Eventually though I started to become exhausted.

I could only make an appointment with the doctor in more than three months. I thus let my blood get tested and decreased my dosis just a little bit by myself. Sleeping was a little better then, but I wasn't feeling like all the symptoms were improved like before.

Now a few weeks after that the insomnia is getting worse again. I sleep 4 hours per night or so. I'm going to crash soln and cannot go on like this much longer. 
Next week I can finally go to the doctor and I want to be prepared. I think the levithyroxin is working for me, but I have a severe side effect i.e. insomnia. This side effect is mentioned in the leaflet. Does that make sense? How would I best explain this to the doctor. The appointments are always rushed and I fear I might not be able to get through to the doctor.
I do want to take the medicine, but without this side effect. Would there be an alternative?",2,1753779667.0,Hypothyroidism,0,1.0,False

1mc6ctg,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1mc6ctg/hereditary_helped_me_realize_i_was_raised_in_a/,Hereditary helped me realize I was raised in a cult,"I'm new to this, sorry if I make mistakes

I (20 f) am now in my sophomore year of college. At the start of the semester, I met two film students in my history class (19 and 20 F), and we became friends quickly. They invited me over for their weekly movie night at their dorm building. Growing up, I didn't own a TV, so I never watched all these amazing films they introduced me to, my favorites being Wes Anderson's films. This went on for all of freshman year and the summer semester, some weeks watching films every night. I even started watching Films on my school laptop. About two months ago, (19 F) suggested we watch Hereditary. They had both seen it before, they loved the movie, and they explained to me that it was a horror film. We had watched a few other horror films, Nosferatu, and Dracula (BBC version, I think), both stood out to me.

We started hereditary (hereditary spoilers ahead), and immediately I loved it. At first, I thought the little girl would be the ""killer"", one of the impacts of Stephen King on me, but then it became super real because I have a severe allergy and have gone into anaphylaxis more than once. shocking, riveting, and just all around incredible experience. Apparently, I was nervously talking throughout the whole film, which they didn't mind because they had both seen it many times. About halfway through the film (I think), when Toni Collette's character was in the grocery store parking lot, and she ran into the witch, I was like ""Wait, pause the film, I think I recognise those mountains.""

They looked up where it was filmed because of how insistent I was that I recognised it. Sure enough, Hereditary was filmed in my hometown in Utah. This was a fun moment. We laughed, then kept watching the movie. We finished the film, it's still one of my favorites, and we started talking about how we needed to watch Midsommar next (still haven't seen it). Out of nowhere (20 f) says, ""So, do you have many cults back at home?"" jokingly.

I said, half-serious, ""No, and I wish people would stop accusing people of being in cults.""

They laughed, but for some reason pressed me further after a moment. We hadn't really discussed our religions, but I thought now was as good of a time as ever. I told them that I'm a fundamentalist, but not much else other than the fact that my family has been told that they're a part of a cult before, and it's really damaging. They seemed to drop it. We chatted a little bit more about the film, then went to bed (we all live in the same dorm building).

The next night I go over to (19 f's) dorm room, we were talking about watching Glee. My other friend and her non-platonic male friend were sitting on the bed, looking concerned. They told me to sit down. At that point, I was worried they were kicking me out of the group or something, but I sat. They asked me if I was really a fundamentalist, and I nodded. They asked me why I was at Uni, and thought it didn't align with my religion. I told them that my mother really encouraged me to get a degree so I could help support my family more when I was older. Most of my family didn't agree with me going to college, but I had a scholarship, and my mother really pushed for it. Then, they showed me dozens of FLDS news articles, personal accounts, and even the Wikipedia page. Most of it I didn't believe at first, I even argued about some things. They never used the word ""cult"", but they mainly emphasised that I grew up in an unsafe situation. We had a very long talk that lasted until about 3 AM. Looking back, I am so grateful to have such good friends who cared so much about me.

I internalised a lot and did more research on my own, but that night was filled with a lot of emotions and a lot of crying. They helped me realize that sometimes the government wants to help. The next day, we came up with a theory that my mother was trying to help me escape. I sent her a letter asking her to visit me, but I still haven't heard from her. Honestly, I'm worried if I'll ever see her again. Things have calmed down a little bit, we've been watching Abbott Elementary, and I'm really ashamed about the views I had before. I thought I was a sinner for watching these films at first, but I was just so desperate to make friends when I first came here. I'm glad I have them, and even though I haven't even spoken to them, I feel like I've lost my family.

Since being at Uni, I've gotten a (used) phone, I've listened to rap music, my favorite is Tyler the Creator, I've dyed my hair, I bought a pair of jeans, I watched anime, I drank matcha and coffee (maybe I'm not ordering right because I think they're gross), I used a tampon, watched youtube, I have cried a lot, I registered to v0te, and celebrated christmas. There is so much I have missed out on, even though sometimes it feels so wrong in the back of my head. I am thinking about studying abroad next semester, or maybe just playing it by ear. I am also thinking about majoring in film.

I'm not really sure what to do. My friends told me to post on here to ""get my thoughts and feelings out"", and it has actually helped so much just writing it. If there are any more horror films I should watch, I'm all ears. I don't want to share any personal details about them on the internet, but if anyone has any suggestions about how to talk to my family, or what to say, it would be helpful. There is a part of me that just wants to disappear and restart my life. I just wish I were born under different circumstances.",3,1753779281.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

I thought he was my soulmate. He's back home, and I live abroad, but we made it work. 

However, he started seeing someone 1 month after our breakup. I was devastated. But I took my time, did my therapy, got over it and started seeing someone myself 3 months later. We had both moved on, supposedly.

The new guy I was seeing was amazing, and I was almost falling in love with him, but we had our own complicated circumstances. 

A week ago, I ended things with this new guy, for irrelevant reasons now, and I was devastated, again (back to point 0). 

The next day I fly back home and I take the week crying, depressed. I make a tweet on Thursday that I haven't been to a bar that I used to go to with my ex (from last year) and that I feel weird about it. 

Long story short, he shows up, to that bar's street, but he doesn't approach me. He first sees me and I don't, then I see him and he doesn't. 

(he also ended things with his girl) 

Later that night he called me and we talked for 3.5 hours.
It was a very heartfelt conversation and we talked about everything and what went wrong in our relationship even.

\- How hard is it to commute to/from the airport?

My current plan is to do what the website says. Bus Number A29 (Hong Kong International Airport ‚Üí Po Lam) and then Bus 91M (Po Lam ‚Üí HKUST). Google says the entire trip would take around 1.5-2 hours, which is okay for me especially with how far the airport is. However, is it hard to get in those buses? Is the bus often crowded? I'm from the Philippines where public transportation is horrible but I know that HK has one of the best public transportation in the world. The trip to/from the airport should be pretty chill, right?

  
\- How do I get to the main shopping areas of HK?

Maybe around Tsim Sha Tsui or Admiralty. Should I take a bus or ride the MTR? Should I even bother to go to those places or just shop around Po Lam instead?

  
\- Food places / restaurant recommendations?

Just in case I get hungry, especially at night lol. Also, are there any convenience stores that are open 24/7?

  
\- What can I do within the campus during my free time?

Perhaps coffee shops, bars, maybe even a public library.",0,1753778120.0,HKUST,1,0.5,False

1mc61z0,https://www.reddit.com/r/VyvanseADHD/comments/1mc61z0/coffee_and_cannabis/,Coffee and cannabis‚Ä¶?,"So I have both a mild coffee addiction and a decade long cannabis addiction. I am on 20 mg Vyvanse since last Friday and while it is active I have zero cannabis cravings. Once it fully wears off the cravings return. I am trying to keep it to just one deep puff a night which doesn‚Äôt cause any heart rate issues. I actually had a really low heart rate before starting, which concerned my gp and she had me undergo an ekg before clearing me for receiving the prescription, so my current heart rate sitting at between 70 and 90 is an improvement from dipping into the lower 50s. 

Thing is I love my coffee and I have been unable to forgo it. What I have been doing is having my usual tall 14-16 ounce cup at around four hours after taking my Vyvanse and not having any more than that for the rest of the day. It makes me feel like a machine. I can get so much done and it gives me this freeing and optimistic feeling that staves off any potential anxiety I can have (I understand this may just be that initial high feeling which may go away with time so I‚Äôm being mindful of that). This is also not drastically increasing my heart rate either. I get a little bit jittery but it‚Äôs not so bad and not really any worse than my ~ 40 oz average a day before starting (how I managed to have a low heart rate despite this is beyond me) 

Anyway, my question is, does this sound a little extreme? I don‚Äôt know that this is sustainable and I‚Äôm worried I might crash at some point. I plan to wait a few weeks before taking my first 2 day break just to give my body a chance to adapt to the side effects and the take maybe weekly breaks after that. I do want to eventually stop or at least cut back the cannabis use but it‚Äôs been a struggle, I may look into meds that help with the cravings because I realize how much it‚Äôs been holding me back. I have a lot of chronic pain which is what got me hooked on cannabis in the first place, but on Vyvanse it doesn‚Äôt really seem to bother me much, for the first time in my life I can keep myself busy and also not focus on the pain and I don‚Äôt really notice it as much.

This one 'the **Haier HRS-682KS (602L)'** is huge. Side-by-side doors, fully convertible fridge space, and a matte black finish that honestly looks way more expensive than it is. It‚Äôs the kind of fridge that makes your kitchen feel grown-up.

I didn‚Äôt just scroll and pick this one at random. I did the research. I annoyingly cross-questioned my cousin who‚Äôs had it for a while. I‚Äôve seen it in action, touched it, opened every drawer (lol), and even judged how fast it cooled a warm Coke bottle.

Here‚Äôs my full, no-BS breakdown... from the features to the flaws to whether this one‚Äôs worth your money or just another fridge with a fancy label.

# Product Snapshot

* **Model**: Haier HRS-682KS
* **Capacity**: 602 Litres (perfect for joint families or serious bulk shoppers)
* **Type**: Side-by-Side Refrigerator
* **Star Rating**: 3 Star (energy-efficient for this size)
* **Technology**: Expert Inverter Compressor
* **Convertible?** Yes ‚Äî you can switch freezer to fridge
* **Cooling Type**: Frost Free
* **Finish**: Black Steel (chef‚Äôs kiss)
* **Price Range**: ‚Çπ62,000 ‚Äì ‚Çπ66,000

üëâ [Check Latest Price on Amazon + Today‚Äôs Offers](https://www.amazon.in/Haier-Refrigerators-Technology-HRS-682KS-Convertible/dp/B0B8ZMLRH4?tag=rahulbhatia-21)

# What Makes It Worth It?

# 1. Space. Like, A Lot of It.

The first thing you notice when you open it? Space. Like, actual usable space. No awkward squeezing, no rearranging ten items to get to one bottle of sauce....fits weekly groceries, leftovers, meal preps, chilled drinks, and even that cake box you normally have to jam in diagonally.

And if you don‚Äôt need a freezer this week? Flip the **freezer section into a fridge** using the convertible mode. Now you‚Äôve got a 600L all-fridge.

# 2. Looks Like It Belongs in a Show Kitchen

That **Black Steel finish** is *chef‚Äôs kitchen* level stuff. It‚Äôs minimal, matte, fingerprint-resistant, and so satisfying to clean.

You don‚Äôt need to hide it in a corner ... this fridge *wants to be seen*.

# 3. Smart Cooling with Low Power Bills

The **Expert Inverter Compressor** doesn‚Äôt just cool ... it *thinks*. It adjusts speed based on your usage, so the fridge works efficiently 24/7 without hogging electricity.

It also means:

* Quiet operation (seriously, it's whisper silent)
* Uniform cooling (no hot milk top shelf, cold bottom drama)
* Better food freshness

# 4. Storage That‚Äôs Actually Thought Through

No more weird small shelves that don‚Äôt fit Indian containers. You get:

* Wide shelves (with toughened glass)
* Large veggie drawers
* Jumbo door bins (2L bottles fit with ease)
* Spacious freezer zone (when needed)

It‚Äôs like someone at Haier finally asked: *‚ÄúWhat do Indians actually store in fridges?‚Äù* And then *did something about it*.

# What You Should Know Before Buying

* **No ice/water dispenser** If that‚Äôs important to you, this model skips it in favor of more internal storage. For many, it‚Äôs not a deal-breaker.
* **Needs big space to open fully** Like any side-by-side, you need clearance to open both doors properly. Measure your kitchen before buying.
* **No WiFi/Smart app controls** But honestly, I‚Äôve never needed to control my fridge from work.

# Price vs Value: Is It Worth ‚Çπ65,000?

Honestly? **Yes** ... and here‚Äôs why:  
You‚Äôre getting:

* A **602L fridge** that‚Äôs convertible
* **Power-saving inverter tech**
* Premium build and finish
* Side-by-side layout that‚Äôs perfect for big families
* And reliable Haier after-sales support

Competitor models from Samsung and LG with similar features will push ‚Çπ80K+ ... and some still won‚Äôt give you 100% fridge convertibility.

So if it‚Äôs under ‚Çπ65,000 on Amazon today, **grab it**.

# Final Thoughts

This is *not* a fridge for bachelors or couples who eat out five days a week.  
This is for:

* Families who *actually cook every day*
* Bulk grocery shoppers
* Meal-preppers
* Or anyone tired of cramped freezer trays and messy interiors

It looks premium, functions like a beast, and gives you space to breathe .... literally and mentally. I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone looking for a long-term upgrade that doesn‚Äôt feel overpriced.

1mc5ttx,https://www.reddit.com/r/GadgetGripesAndGlor/comments/1mc5ttx/does_the_cuisinart_elemental_food_processor_live/,Does the Cuisinart Elemental Food Processor Live Up to Its Reputation?,"The Cuisinart ECH-4SV, a 4-Cup Chopper Grinder in silver, has found its way into my kitchen, and I‚Äôve been putting it through its paces daily. Let's just say that when you carve out a little nook specifically for a gadget, you‚Äôre either extremely organized or this device is a keeper. With its compact design and advertised multifunctionality, it piqued my curiosity. Could it really handle my endless demands for chopping, grinding, and pureeing? I had to find out.

**Design and Build**  
The sleek silver finish of this chopper-grinder fits seamlessly into my kitchen aesthetics, blending functionality with style. It doesn‚Äôt dominate counter space, which is a win for smaller kitchens. The 4-cup capacity, while compact, is just right for prepping meals for two to three people or whipping up quick dips and sauces. The controls are simple‚Äîjust two touchpad buttons for chop or grind. Even on bleary-eyed mornings, I found them straightforward to use. The build quality, especially the sturdy stainless steel blade and the secure Bladelock system, gives confidence in the product‚Äôs durability.

**Performance in Daily Use**  
This is where it got interesting. From parsley to nuts, the chopper-grinder handled soft foods and hard ingredients with equal zeal. The auto-reversing SmartPower blade is not just marketing lingo; it genuinely provides sharp edges for delicate chopping (think onions or pureeing softer foods like avocados) while the blunt side proved powerful enough to grind coffee beans and spices. I crafted guacamole with silky smooth consistency and prepared chunky salsa without much fuss. However, I noticed that with tougher ingredients like carrots, the machine occasionally required manual intervention to redistribute the pieces.

[Check Cuisinart ECH-4SV price on Amazon.](https://kitchenchampions.com/p/b074mqfr55/)

**Ease of Cleaning**  
Cleanup is a task I despise, but this machine made it nearly painless. Every removable part is dishwasher-safe, and the small size means it won‚Äôt hog space in the appliance section of your dishwasher. For quick hand washes, the bowl and the blade rinsed easily without residue sticking behind. However, the lid‚Äôs crevices could occasionally trap bits of food, requiring a bit more attention.

**Strengths**  
- Compact and durable design fits perfectly in small kitchens.  
- Efficient blades with autopilot mode for handling soft and hard ingredients.  
- Dishwasher-safe parts keep cleanup minimal.  
- Simple two-button operation suits even the most non-technical user.  

**Flaws**  
- On heavy or tougher ingredients, processing can take longer or require manual adjustments.  
- The lid design occasionally traps ingredients, complicating cleaning slightly.  

**Competing Products**  
This device faces stiff competition in the small food processor niche, with brands like Ninja and KitchenAid offering similar models. While Ninja‚Äôs models gear more towards multi-functional blending and chopping in one unit, I found their build slightly bulkier. KitchenAid tends to drift toward slightly more expensive products in this category, and while stylish, they often lack the straightforward functionality of the Cuisinart. Where this model shines is its unique Bladelock system, which gave me peace of mind when pouring ingredients. While competitors may have fancier settings, none felt as balanced in terms of simplicity and efficiency for the price range.

**Price to Quality Ratio**  
What really hit home for me is how much you get for what you pay. It doesn‚Äôt boast the extravagant features of pricier models, but it also doesn‚Äôt try to be something it‚Äôs not. This chopper-grinder does what it says‚Äîconvenient, efficient, and reliable. If you‚Äôre on the lookout for a medium-capacity processor of good quality without burning a hole in your pocket, it more than delivers on its promises.

\- in fairness sa cebpac walang drama, walang aberya at on-time. good job! ang bait pa ng staff sa sydney hindi na pinansin yung overweight namin na handcarry lol. yung 8hr flight wala masyadong turbulence cguro dahil mas malaki yung plane.

\- sarap ng winter weather, June - July is their coldest. Masarap maglakad kahit maghapon hanggang gabi lol. hello 23k steps in one day? mani! haha. yung daily walking average namin dito naluma yung sa Japan haha.

\- sobrang ganda ng nature and coastal lifestyle, beautiful beaches within the city like Bondi, Manly, Brighton and so many coastal walks na jaw droppingly gorgeous na parang pang-wallpaper! Andami ding mga parks. 

\- loved the ferry rides/cruise to/from Circular Quay and Sydney Harbor lalo na sa gabi! 

\- delicious coffee and croissants! ibang level

\- laid-back european feel, every street nook and cranny is instagrammable lalo sa sa Fitzroy. sosyal feels! para ka ng nagpunta sa europe, or new york/brooklyn sa ibang part hehe

\- so many activities, street markets, events, and shows walang ubos hehe (we loved the TOy Story concert sa Opera House, Annie play sa Princess Theather, little food market sa melbourne, at small street markets naming napuntahan)",10,1753777083.0,FilipinoTravel,8,0.92,False

I use the Ultrahuman ring but my sleep patterns weren't all that great on the Apple watch either. The only reason I can think of is that I work out in the evening (pretty intense lifting, around 7PM), but my schedule doesn't really allow for morning workouts. Got a physical a few months ago and everything seemed fine so I'm not sure what else I can do. Any advice? Tired of always feeling tired ü´†",3,1753777007.0,sleep,0,0.81,False

1mc5ru2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1mc5ru2/his_regret_came_too_late/,His Regret Came Too Late,"Chapter 1‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãMy daughter froze to death because my husband thought I kidnapped his bastards.He tied her upside down to a utility pole. In the middle of a blizzard. And left her there all night.By the time I reached her, her tiny lips were blue, her lashes covered in frost, and her arms hung limp like a broken doll.I screamed her name‚Äîonce, twice‚Äîbut Kiara didn‚Äôt answer. My baby didn‚Äôt even flinch.I fell to my knees, clutching her frozen body, barely breathing as I whispered, ‚ÄúColsen, she‚Äôs your daughter too. How could you do this to her?‚Äù‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my child,‚Äù he snarled, ‚Äújust like Rafael and Brian. If you hate me, fine‚Äîbut why punish innocent kids? Where did you hide them, Elsie?!‚ÄùMy throat tightened. I didn‚Äôt know how to respond‚Äîbecause nothing I said would matter.So he did worse.He ordered someone to throw my already unconscious daughter into a frozen lake.I dragged her out with trembling hands, screaming until my voice cracked. But Kiara never woke up.At the hospital, the doctor shook his head. ‚ÄúThere's nothing we can do. Her organs have shut down. It‚Äôs too late.‚ÄùShe had just turned seven yesterday.And now she was gone. Not because of illness. Not because of fate. But because I married a man who thought his mistresses‚Äô children were worth more than our own.I took her lifeless body to the funeral home that night, then wandered back to the house to fetch her favorite doll.But the moment I opened the door, I heard laughter.There they were‚ÄîColsen‚Äôs ‚Äúmissing‚Äù sons‚Äîplaying happily in the living room.And Colsen?He was on the couch with her, arms wrapped around the woman who helped ruin everything.My head started spinning at the sight. My mind went completely blank.When Colsen noticed me, the grin on his face disappeared. ""Oh, you're back?"" he said flatly.He gave me a cold glance and added, ""Looks like the punishment worked. You must've been scared enough to return Rafael and Brian in the middle of the night. Since they're both fine, and Astrid is kind-hearted, I'll let this whole thing go.""I didn't respond. He narrowed his eyes and said with a chill in his voice, ""To keep the boys from going missing again, I'll be keeping them close from now on. Starting today, Astrid and her two sons will be living here too. You'd better drop whatever wicked ideas you've got and learn to get along.""Get along? What a joke.Kiara had just passed away, and he expected me to live under the same roof as his illegitimate twins, like nothing had happened.I clenched my fists, but my throat was too dry to speak.Seeing I was silent, he frowned and asked, ""Where's Kiara? What did you do with her? I shouldn't have tied her up like that, but you left me no choice. If you hadn't hidden my two sons, I wouldn't have gone that far. Kiara's always been a smart kid. I'm sure she'll understand.""Understand?But he had no idea that the sweet, gentle child who never gave him trouble was dead because of him. Killed by his own hands. Just thinking of Kiara made my chest feel like it was being torn apart.I looked at those two boys laughing on the slide, and fury exploded inside me. If it weren't for them, my daughter would still be alive!In a sudden rage, I lunged forward and grabbed both boys by the neck with all the strength I had.""Elsie Flynn! What are you doing?!"" Colsen rushed over and yanked me back violently, throwing me to the floor.""I thought you had changed, but you're still so cruel and full of hate! What did these boys ever do to deserve this from you?!""Astrid quickly wrapped her arms around the crying children and burst into tears. ""Elsie, it's all my fault. If you're angry, be mad at me. Please, just don't hurt them anymore...""""Colsen stared at me with a cold expression, his gaze sharp and cold.""Elsie, Astrid has always been kind and never tried to take anything from you. Why can't you just accept her?""My eyes burned with tears, and my heart felt like it was being torn apart. ""Colsen... do you even know... do you have any idea what you did to Kiara...""Before I could finish, I suddenly coughed up a mouthful of blood.The sorrow overwhelmed me, and I collapsed unconscious.Chapter 2‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãWhen I opened my eyes again, I realized I was locked inside the room. I reached into my pocket to call for help, but my phone was gone.Still in shock, I heard the door creak open slowly. Standing in the doorway, lit from behind, was Colsen.He walked over and stopped near the bed, speaking in a calm but serious tone, ""Elsie, it's normal for rich men to have more than one woman. Can't you be more understanding? No matter how many women are out there, you'll always be my legal wife. Kiara will always be my eldest daughter. No one can take your place. Why can't you accept that?""I looked at the man before me, crying silently. He felt like a stranger now, and it terrified me.We had fallen in love back in college. We married after graduation and had been together for over ten years.In the beginning, I gave him all my savings to help him get started. I stayed by his side as he grew from a broke student into a billionaire businessman.But just a year after he became successful, he had an affair. Everything he had promised me became meaningless.When I discovered he had another family, I lost control. I screamed, cried, and made a huge scene.I refused to divorce him because I didn't want the money we built together to end up in the hands of his illegitimate children. So I clung to the marriage certificate, refused to sign the divorce papers, and did everything I could to keep control of the company's finances. I promised myself I'd protect Kiara's inheritance‚Äîno matter what.But it was my refusal to let go that ended up causing Kiara's death.Now I finally see things clearly. I'm done fighting and making a fuss.In a raspy voice, I told him, ""Colsen, I won't argue anymore... I just want a divorce.""""You're stubborn!"" he snapped, his eyes darkening as he slammed his hand on the table. ""You still don't understand the situation! Since that's the case, stay in this room until you reflect on yourself. Once you realize your mistake, I'll let you out!""Then he turned and walked out, closing the door behind him with a loud bang.""No!"" I screamed, rushing to the door and banging on it. ""Colsen, open the door! I can't stay locked in here!""Kiara is still lying in the funeral home. I haven't even buried her yet. I can't be trapped here!""Open the door, Colsen!"" I shouted.But no matter how desperately I shouted, the only answer I got was the hollow echo of my own voice in the empty room.Chapter 3‚Äã‚Äã‚ÄãIt wasn't until later that night that the door finally opened again. Astrid came inside, holding a glass of water.She stood in front of me with a mocking smirk, her voice dripping with provocation. ""Elsie, just look at yourself. You look completely drained. No spark, no youth, no life left in you. No wonder Colsen chose me instead!""Her words didn't bother me anymore.I truly didn't care who Colsen chose to love.""Oh, right, did your daughter die?"" Astrid asked, sneering proudly. ""Honestly, I hid the twins on purpose to make you look like the bad one. And it was my idea to hang your daughter up in the freezing wind all night. I suggested it to Colsen. Who would've thought it'd work so well and kill that little brat in one go? She's just like you‚Äîweak and pathetic.""Elsie, the Breslin family business will soon belong to my kids! And I'll be the next Mrs. Breslin!""""Astrid!"" The second I heard her cruel words, I couldn't stay calm anymore.Furious, I ran toward her, grabbed her hair, and screamed like a mad woman, ""You vile woman! My daughter didn't do anything to you. Why did you hurt her?""""Ah!"" Astrid suddenly dropped to her knees with a loud thud and started begging with fake tears. ""Elsie, I'm sorry. I never should've gone after Colsen or destroyed your family. Please stop hitting me...""Then, the door burst open with a loud bang.Colsen stormed in, his face filled with rage. ""Elsie!""He marched toward me and slapped me hard across the face. ""Astrid came in to bring you water out of kindness. Instead of being grateful, you hit her? How could you be so cruel?""The blow knocked me over.My forehead hit the edge of the table, and a sharp pain followed. Warm blood started dripping down my face.But I didn't care about the injury. I stood up, pleading with him. ""Colsen, please let me go. Kiara froze to death because of you. Her body is still at the funeral home. She hasn't even been cremated. I can't let her leave this world without peace...""""Stop lying!"" Colsen's expression turned harsh. He glared at me and said coldly, ""You're heartless enough to curse your own child? Kiara was always healthy. There's no way she froze to death! You're just trying to run away!""But that night, the temperature was -20¬∞C. Kiara was only seven. How could she survive that kind of torment?""Colsen, I'm not making anything up. I can prove it with this death certificate..."" My hands were shaking as I pulled the document from inside my clothes.Astrid gave a cold laugh. ""Elsie, where did you get that fake certificate from? My friend got one made for two dollars, but yours looks way more convincing.""""You're terrible, Elsie!"" Colsen shouted, his face full of fury. He ripped the certificate from my hand and threw it at me.""You really faked something like this just to trick me? I'm warning you, my patience is running out! Keep this up, and Astrid will replace you as my wife for sure! All the family's money will go to her twins!""The sharp paper scraped across my face, cutting my skin and drawing blood.A wave of despair washed over me.Just then, a sudden clatter came from Kiara's room next door, followed by a strong scent of smoke.My heart tightened in alarm. ""What's going on out there?""Chapter 4‚Äã‚ÄãAstrid crossed her arms and spoke with tears in her voice, ""Elsie, Rafael, and Brian really like Kiara's room. Colsen said he'd clear out all of Kiara's stuff so they could move in. He also said she had too many useless toys, and the storage room couldn't fit them. So he told the nanny to burn everything.""""What are you saying..."" I gasped, completely stunned.I ran outside and shouted, ""Stop! Don't touch her things! Don't burn them!""Colsen's face turned cold as he shouted, ""Enough! Elsie, don't you get it? Letting Kiara keep all this junk will destroy her future! This is your fault! You spoiled her. Myla, burn everything!""""No, you can't do that..."" I rushed forward, trying to stop them, but Colsen yanked me back, holding me still.Astrid pretended to comfort me. ""Elsie, please trust Colsen. He only wants what's best for the kids.""In the end, all I could do was stand there, watching helplessly as Kiara's most beloved toys were swallowed by flames‚Äîreduced to ashes before my eyes. The fire roared, lighting up the room in a blaze of red, and all I could see was the burn in my eyes.I collapsed to my knees beside the ashes, sobbing.""I'm so sorry, Kiara. It's all my fault.""I couldn't keep you safe, and I couldn't protect your things either.""I'm a terrible mother.""Then I was locked up again. No matter how many times I banged on the door or pleaded, Colsen wouldn't let me out.I didn't eat or drink for three days. I just lay there, weak and crying for Kiara. The pain in my chest was endless, unbearable.On the third day, it was the twins' third birthday. Colsen threw them a grand, extravagant party.The sound of music and laughter downstairs made my pain feel even worse.As I sat in silence, the door burst open with a loud bang. Astrid came in with the twins.""Elsie, I brought you some cake,"" she said, proudly holding a plate of exquisite small cakes. ""Colsen made them himself! Can you believe it? A man who's never stepped foot in the kitchen actually baked for his kids. He dotes on the twins so much. Elsie, I bet you and your daughter never got to eat anything homemade by Colsen, right? What a shame, too bad your little girl never will...""I was so furious that I jumped up and smacked the plate right out of her hands. The white cream splattered all over Astrid's clothes.Her face turned red with rage as she raised her hand and slapped me across the face. ""Elsie, what are you even proud of? Do you still think you're the dignified Mrs. Breslin? Let me tell you, those days are over!""Then, all of a sudden, she shoved her younger son, Brian Breslin, with force.Brian lost his balance and toppled backward, hitting his head on the edge of the coffee table. Blood began to stream from the back of his head.He wailed in pain, his cries echoing through the room.Colsen rushed in, alarmed by the noise. ""Astrid, what's going on in here?""Astrid looked terrified as she held the injured Brian close, crying. ""Colsen, Brian was just trying to be kind. He brought Elsie a piece of cake. She didn't want it, fine. But she actually pushed him! Brian hit his head and now he's bleeding... My poor boy, what did he ever do to deserve this?""Her eldest son, Rafael Breslin, chimed in quickly, ""Daddy, that bad woman is so evil! She called Mommy a vile woman, threw her cake, and pushed Brian! She's so mean, you have to punish her for what she did!""""Elsie!"" Colsen's eyes darkened with fury as he suddenly raised his hand and struck me across the face.He grabbed me by the neck and shoved me hard against the edge of the window, his expression twisted with rage, eyes nearly blazing. ""Elsie, Astrid has always been gentle and always puts up with you. Why do you keep crossing the line? Looks like I've let you off too easily. That's why you act so full of yourself!""Apologize to Astrid. Right now!""My face burned, and it was getting hard to breathe. I felt like I was suffocating. But even then, I forced out a reply, ""I'll never... apologize!""""You won't learn your lesson until it's too late, huh?"" Colsen growled, his voice low and threatening. His teeth were clenched as he glared at me. ""If you don't apologize to Astrid, I'll throw you out this window. Are you scared now?""I laughed. Soft, bitter, unhinged.After being married for a decade and sticking together through so many ups and downs, this is how it ends.What a terrible ending.""You don't have to do it."" I whispered, my lips trembling.""I'll jump on my own.""",1,1753776937.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
