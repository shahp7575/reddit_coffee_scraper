1qsx75d,https://i.redd.it/4rknqzhrmvgg1.png,A slow-paced first solo travel — Baguio,"I posted 2 months ago about my plan to go & have a solo trip in Baguio. I just wanna say thank you so much to those who took their time to give great recos to me as those helped me a lot in picking the best things to do in Baguio.

It's inexplicable to say how much I enjoyed my slow-paced travel there. I wasn't really able to go to a lot of places & do all the things people here recommended but I am planning to go back in December & try going to other places I didn't get to visit.

Here's what I did:

Day 1
• Rest for about 2 hours before going out, then visited Cornelia St. Bistro House (I'm a lowkey swiftie and I enjoyed my time there until 6pm).
• I rode a jeepney to General Luna then walked to SM Baguio (I loved this experience, I was just wandering around).
• I had a nice sight-seeing activity in SM Baguio as that's the first time I saw the night view of Baguio from the top.
• I walked around the session road then I went to the night market before 9pm but vendors were still preparing that time.
• Once I was done eating, I decided to go back to my transient home and appreciate the city lights through my window. 🌌

Day 2
• I woke up a bit late. I wanted to wake up around 5am as I planned to go to Mt. Kalugong, but I woke up at around 6:30am. 😅
• At around 7:20, I was waiting for a jeep to the city proper (I realized my accomm. isn't really that near to the city proper but I loved it still as it's very peaceful & I won't trade the view from the window of my room for convenience).
• I was finally in Mt. Kalugong but the way up there was hard haha. I only walked, but it's possible to ride a van, I still loved the experience tho! ✨
• When I finally get there, ahhh.. I was ecstatic! 😭
• There were no other people in Kape-an aside from the owner/staff, so I enjoyed being there alone, but not lonely.
• I carefully climbed through the lime rock formations & enjoyed the view from there. (I didn't get to have a picture of me sitting on the rock as I was there solo, I only had selfies & of course, pics. of the view hehe).
• After taking my time there daydreaming, I went back down to go to the part of the place on the picture here & tried to take quick photos of me looking over the whole place (It was so hard to take pics. w/o anyone or even a tripod haha).
• I spent half of my day there, it was almost 1pm when I decided to go back & funny 'coz I was supposed to go to other places; instead, I slept all afternoon in my room after crying my heart out (My papa's 2nd death anniversary is on this day & I missed him).
• I prepared before going to the city proper & had a fancy dinner at the Cafe by the Ruins.
• I went to the night market to buy little souvenirs for my siblings, then went back to my accommodation, took a bath, then sleep.


Day 3
I woke up at 5am, got myself ready, then went to Mirador Heritage Ecopark.
• I took my time there again, I was just happy to roam around & take random pictures. Time flies! I was planning to go to the Yellow Trail in Camp John Hay, but I was already running out of time. 😔
• I ate & drink hot tea in Foam Coffee, but didn't get to finish my tea there as I bought bread & pastries from Victoria's Bakery, then went back to check-out from my transient home at 11am.
• I left my luggage at SM's tourist lounge, before heading to the bus terminal & booked an afternoon ticket to PITX.
• The only available seats were 16 (middle area), 23, & 24 (both at the back part of the bus). I chose seat 16 despite not knowing who the person next to me will be (also, i easily get dizzy & i usually take bonamine before riding a bus).
• It turned out, it was a guy who had read my reddit post before! Haha. He also went to Baguio alone and our vibes clicked immediately (well, not in a romantic way). We talked about a lot of diff. things, topics you won't even think about daily haha. We had a wholesome & genuine conversation, as if the universe wanted us to end our solo journeys with an enchanting encounter... and even I had to take another bus to finally be home, I was still thinking about everything I've experienced. I reminisced the whole journey with a longing, yet grateful heart.
I'll be back. 🤍

Thank you for reading until here! To those who are planning to go & have your solo travel, I don't know how much time you need to finally be able to do it, but even now, I am proud of you. 🙂",1,1769948891.0,phtravel,1,1.0,False

I’d thought about this for a lot of time and for a lot of things, not only coffee but anything that can be produced.

You see, I live in Dominican Republic, a third world country or in development if you fancy. We do have a Coffe culture in the sense that people like Coffe and live for Coffe but not in the sense to know about quality coffee or coffee even what’s to be considered a good Coffe.

Years ago I went to this highly rated cafeteria called Ciao and I found out their Espresso to be burn out BUT then again I live here and I’m Dominican so I don’t know if I’m correct. I even made a review on Google Maps and the owner answered me telling that I didn’t know shit on how a real espresso it’s make in Italy (he’s supposed to be Italian or have the heritage) but again precisely for living here in DR if I can identify one quality of coffee, I would said it should be its burned as that’s the major constant in our coffee culture, of course I don’t even know if in an espresso machine you can produce a burned cup, much less at the industrial level of this machines.

Anyway I went yesterday again, after a lot of years, and a little better knowledge because I’d tasted more espressos in my travels, no so many cities sadly, and the result was the same. The irony on this it’s that recently I’d discovered that in the place where I wash my car (a car wash) they made a lovely espresso which I tasted balanced, no so sweet but certainly not bitter or burned, just perfect and on point. I guess for now this would be my place to go.

Again, it would be so amazing to live in a society that has access to correct or perfected version of products.

If you know in San Juan Puerto Rico and/or Bogotá Colombia where I definitely can tasted how an espresso should taste, please leave it in the comments so I can go there in a couple of months.

Each hose has different designations in the service documentation; some list the outer diameter first, others the inner diameter. Could you please tell me how to read the size 03.0x1.50x160? I only understand that 160mm is the total hose length, but the rest isn't very clear. The problem is that the coffee machine now dispenses 45ml of coffee, while the specified 30ml is the correct size. I think the problem is that the previous owner installed the wrong size hose; it now 1.5x1.5x160.

Lately, I've been really drawn to the dramatic shadows and deep tones of a full-on **Literary Gothic** look, but I'm also deeply lazy and appreciate the slightly undone vibe of a **Chaotic Curator**. The challenge? How to mash up a brooding, shadowy eye with something I could wear to grab coffee without feeling like I needed a fog machine entrance. My aim wasn't perfection, but more like, ""Can I make this *feel* cool and interesting, even if it's not a Pinterest tutorial?""

Here's how my latest experiment in shadowy, lived-in drama went down:

*   **The Inspiration:** I was picturing those old, slightly faded portraits, or a well-loved copy of a Bronte novel – deep, muted tones, a hint of melancholy, but with a modern edge that says ""I just woke up like this, possibly in a very interesting old library."" Less ""perfectly blended smoky eye,"" more ""artfully smudged and deep-set.""

*   **The Goods I Used:**
    *   **Eye Primer:** Milani Eyeshadow Primer (around $7) – gotta have something to grip onto, even for a messy look.
    *   **Shadow Palette:** A well-loved dusty cool-toned brown from an old NYX Ultimate Shadow Palette (the one with the deep plums and grays, around $18). Specifically, a matte charcoal and a deep, almost black-brown.
    *   **Liner:** ColourPop Creme Gel Liner in ""Exit"" (a matte black, $7) for the waterline and tightline. And for smudging, a kohl pencil I found at a discount store for about $3 – literally no brand name, just a black stick.
    *   **Mascara:** Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara ($5) – because it's cheap, effective, and I don't mind getting it a bit messy.
    *   **Brow Gel:** e.l.f. Wow Brow Gel in ""Deep Brown"" ($5) – just enough to keep them somewhat defined, but not too sculpted.
    *   **Base:** Kept it super light. Just some L.A. Girl Pro.Conceal HD Concealer ($5) under the eyes and where needed, then a light dusting of whatever translucent powder was closest.

*   **The (Imperfect) Process:**
    1.  **Prep:** Primer on the lids, pulled up slightly towards the brow bone.
    2.  **The Shadow Base:** I took the deep, almost-black brown from the NYX palette on a fluffy brush and really worked it into my crease and outer corner, blending it upwards and outwards a bit. The key here was not to aim for a sharp edge, but a soft, blown-out cloud of color. Then, I layered the matte charcoal over the outer half of the lid and into the crease, focusing on building depth. I didn't fuss too much if it wasn't perfectly symmetrical.
    3.  **Smudged Liner:** This was the fun part. I ran the no-name kohl pencil along my upper lash line, then immediately took a small, flat brush and *really* smudged it out into the shadows, almost creating a smoky wing that wasn't a wing. I also ran it along the lower lash line and smudged that out too, connecting it to the upper shadow. This is where the **Chaotic Curator** vibe came in – embracing the imperfect, lived-in smudge.
    4.  **Waterline:** The ColourPop black liner went into the upper and lower waterlines to intensify things.
    5.  **Mascara:** A good few coats on top and bottom lashes.
    6.  **Brows:** A quick brush through with the e.l.f. gel.
    7.  **Rest of the Face:** Kept it minimalist to let the eyes be the focus. A touch of a neutral, sheer lip balm (like Vaseline Lip Therapy Rosy Lips, $2) and skipped blush or contour entirely.

*   **Time Invested:** Maybe 15-20 minutes? The smudging actually saved time because I didn't need to be precise.

**Real Talk & Lessons Learned:**
My first attempt at this specific combo felt a bit too heavy for a daytime look, almost like I'd forgotten to wash my makeup off from the night before (which, honestly, is a valid aesthetic sometimes). The key was realizing I needed to lighten up the *rest* of my face significantly and not overdo the inner corner with dark shadow. Also, the smudging is where the magic happens – don't be afraid to really dig in and mess it up a bit, then diffuse the edges with a clean brush. It gave it that ""I'm interesting, but also I don't take myself too seriously"" feel. It's not a sharply defined, 'gram-ready look, but it felt authentic and suited the mood I was going for. It really hammered home that even when aiming for a specific aesthetic, adapting it to your own comfort level and daily life is totally allowed, and often, more rewarding.

The 078 was really high acidity on settings 1-3.
I switched to the Femobook A4 and have got reasonable cups around 240 clicks. 

Two things I am experiencing that seem different to other people:
1. It takes multiple pumps to produce any resistance. 
I see a lot of people talking about one slow and controlled pump at the start, but it takes 3-4 pumps before I can do this slow and controlled saturating pump. Is this a fault with my unit or something others experience?

2. When the first droplets come out, the coffee come out as a ring around the edge. The whole surface does not produce droplets until the quicker pumps. 
Does this indicate I am going too fine?

for wanderers whose souls burn like the sun

There, there he stood
the bard, pouring a plethora
of what-ifs and might-bes,
and Athena, returning, bruised
still adorned with wisdom and beauty

Like a sun scorching his mind,
A different kind, a one of a kind
He admired, he desired
Trying to leave fear behind

""This is what I seek in my songs""
as he whispers, 
smiling even as her light burned his eyes,
still adoring
a being impossibly bright

Though the chances were slim,
he would persist
until Athena’s gaze fell upon him,
and the world he longed to give and nurture

For she is one of a kind, one of a kind
a star, a goddess blazing through the night
beyond songs, beyond plight,
more powerful than any doubts in his mind.

""I will become your eternaut,""
yearning you, beyond space, beyond time
beyond whatever may-bes
of a lifetime. ❤‍🩹",2,1769946974.0,pahungaw,2,1.0,False

But hot coffee?,"Since I don’t have an Aeroccino or any electric milk frother yet, I decided to buy a manual milk frother from IKEA for now. I also picked up Oatly Barista Edition, which was recommended by a Redditor I came across. For coffee, I’ve been using Sweet Vanilla capsules since I really like the flavor.

Before getting the frother and oat milk, I was honestly just mixing instant creamer powder into my coffee.

I mostly drink hot coffee, so here’s what I’m unsure about. Since my milk frother isn’t electric and the oat milk needs to be refrigerated, what’s the best way to do this?

A) Froth the milk while it’s cold (straight from the fridge), mix it into the coffee, then microwave everything to heat it up?

B) Microwave the milk first to warm it up, then froth it, and only after that add it to the coffee?

Or is there another method you’d recommend?

Any advice would be appreciated.",2,1769946924.0,nespresso,6,1.0,False

So l've decided that 2026 is the year I change that!

I enjoy deep, thoughtful conversations, long walks by the sea, discovering new cafés or food spots, artistic activities like pottery, and sharing simple moments of everyday life.

I'm more into good vibes, kindness, and authenticity than anything flashy.

I know late tonight 

Worked from home today—things were slow, but even on “days off,” I’m technically on duty. No complaints, though. I

 volunteered for this posting, and Wyatt gave me a house here that’s honestly large enough for a whole family. Kids would thrive in NewTown—the open spaces, the community, the fresh start. But that would require getting married first. No rush, no regrets so far.

It was a good day. No bad dreams after the council meeting. The nightmares have faded the last couple of nights—finally.

\[Pause in typing…\]

Lili, I’ve not had any bad dreams the last couple nights. I don’t need security after tonight. —Rachel… send.

Messaged Liz last night that I’d be sleeping in. No one from the council pinged before 0930 today—not her, not anyone else. I bet she said something to them. Keeping things calm for me.

Aino’s lucky to be awake at 0900 on weekdays. He’s a nice guy—definitely a nightlife person before all this happened. Not the type I go for, though. Dad always said: marry for the future, not the here and now. I do not see Aino as my future 

Liz -

Message at 1200 hrs hey . 

I said bring coffee 

I’m serious she ran here two minutes and she was in my front door . Hugging me . 

Also saying she has a package at her house from her dad . 

I told her bring it Saturday  

Liz and I both like Torres—she’ll be fun to hike with on Saturday. Looks like four of us now, with Lili joining.

Marcus ordered more items for a boat, plus some lead for… something on it. Lead’s hazmat, so shipping will cost extra. I’ll reach out to the logistics officer on the Internal Garden. (I hate that ship name—they really need to change it.)

Maybe Tornel can change it . 

Ping: Message from Sgt. Bauer. “They stay until Saturday morning. Will talk at the range.”

I don’t like arguing about it—just a few more days.

Been wondering where the Nori Navio is now. Such a clean ship. Miss that order sometimes.

Aino stopped by earlier. Said a young woman was shuttled to the capital for a doctor’s checkup. Then he told me to look at purchasing baby items today—stuff for a new mother. He tried not to call it stupid without saying it… men!!

He said he’s pretty busy and would like me to coordinate with the doctor.

Then he stole my BR coffee.

Whoopie—our first baby in NewTown! I hope the parents stay together. Maybe our first wedding as a couple here?

Wait—as Administrator (technically Mayor) of NewTown, Aino has the authority to perform wedding ceremonies. Anna would be so happy. Flowers—lots of flowers.

I wonder what her name is.

Have to meet with the doc soon. I’ll need a full list of everything he’ll need (or she’ll need).

I’m excited—want to tell Liz, but can’t yet. (Hey Liz, we’re having a baby! Haha.)

Aino didn’t give me the name, and I didn’t ask. It’s private until they’re ready. Once it’s public we have a future mother in town, maybe Aino will have the clock tower bell rung. I’ll suggest he check with the parents first.

Evidently the doc ordered test kits—with a noble doctor involved. I’m disliking titles more every day, even though I have one.

Maybe next council meeting we invite the doc. See what medical needs we can make free/available for women here. Liz might have room in a corner of her store—I’ll ask.

I say do away with everyone having the same  “Swallowtail” surname nonsense on Haego. Use Dad’s name or first surname: Newton for NewTown if they want. “Mr. & Mrs. John Michael Newton.”

Will ask at council meeting 

Not sure what Wyatt will say about marriage or relationships in general. He seems reserved when it comes up. Wonder if he’s even had a girlfriend.

Well, I’m tired and keep losing track tonight.

1. Clients come to the place (pop up on the bottom of the screen) you're playing and ask for items which you find on the screen. If you take a long time, they'd leave.
2. It's an item-search type of game like hidden exploration games.
3. It had a clue system: the first one was a question mark which reveals what the client is looking for. The other was a thermostat/thermometer thingy that would show snowflakes if you're far from the requested item or hot flames if close. There was a chicken dummy/doll thing I forgot what it did.

There are two places that I remember from the game. The first one is inside a cafe/coffee bakery-type shop. I remember you had to find seven cups of coffee. The second place was something like a newspaper stand covered with a bunch of articles – it had a blimp in the top left of the screen.

That's all I remember. Any takers? 😊

For students enrolling at the University of Melbourne (Parkville campus), the question of where to live is one of the most critical decisions they will make before arriving in Australia. The ""where to live"" debate usually narrows down to three distinct heavyweights: Carlton, the CBD (Central Business District), and Brunswick. Each of these suburbs offers a completely different slice of Melbourne life. Carlton is the traditional academic heartland with a village feel; the CBD offers high-octane city living in vertical towers; and Brunswick provides a bohemian, counter-culture escape for those seeking more space. To help incoming students decide, here is a detailed comparative breakdown of proximity, lifestyle, and cost for these top three contenders.

# Carlton

# Proximity to the University

Carlton is widely considered an extension of the campus itself. Geographically, it wraps around the eastern and northern borders of the University of Melbourne Parkville campus. Many [uhomes.com](http://uhomes.com) [student accommodation near University of Melbourne](https://en.uhomes.com/au/melbourne/the-university-of-melbourne-parkville-campus) are located in Carlton suburb, making the commute virtually non-existent for residents.

* Walking: Most housing in Carlton is located between 200 meters to 800 meters from the university gates. A walk to the Spot Building (Business/Economics) or the Melbourne Law School typically takes 5 to 10 minutes.

# Lifestyle

Carlton defines the quintessential ""Melbourne Uni experience."" It is leafy, historic, and deeply academic. The streets are lined with Victorian terrace houses, and the population is heavily skewed towards students and academics.

* Lygon Street: Known historically as ""Little Italy,"" this strip is the suburb's social lifeline. It is home to iconic institutions like Brunetti Classico, where students can be found studying over coffee and cake late into the night. Cinema Nova is another local staple, famous for offering discounted movie tickets on Mondays, making it a regular haunt for students.
* Study Culture: The area feels like a scholar's retreat. Lincoln Square and Argyle Square are popular green spaces where students read on the grass between classes.
* Intellectual Hub: The flagship Readings Bookstore on Lygon Street is a cultural landmark, often hosting book launches and serving as a quiet browsing spot for humanities students.

# Cost

Living in Carlton commands a premium price tag that sits above the Melbourne median, primarily due to its unbeatable location directly opposite the university. You are essentially paying for the luxury of walking to class. In 2025, a private room in a share house typically ranges from AU$300 to AU$420 per week, while a private studio or one-bedroom apartment generally costs between AU$480 and AU$650+ per week. While this rent is high compared to middle-ring suburbs, students often find it balances out by completely eliminating public transport costs from their monthly budget.

# CBD

# Proximity to the University

Living in Melbourne CBD means residing in the high-density grid immediately south of UniMelb campus. It is incredibly accessible but requires a slightly different commute.

* **Tram:** This is the primary mode of travel. A tram ride from Melbourne Central or Elizabeth Street (routes 19, 59) to the Haymarket stop takes approximately 8 to 12 minutes. It is within the Free Tram Zone until the edge of the campus, but technically the university stop is just outside the zone (though many students walk the last block).
* **Walking:** From the northern edge of the CBD (e.g., near Queen Victoria Market), it is a 15 to 20-minute walk to the main campus.

# Lifestyle

The CBD offers a high-intensity, vertical lifestyle. Melbourne never sleeps and is incredibly convenient for students who want to experience big-city living.

* **The Grid:** Life here happens in skyscrapers and laneways. Residents have immediate access to Melbourne Central and QV for shopping, as well as the State Library of Victoria, which is a legendary (albeit crowded) study spot for students.
* **Food & Nightlife:** You are steps away from Chinatown on Little Bourke Street for late-night dumplings at 2 AM, or Hardware Lane for cafe breakfasts.
* **Convenience vs. Noise:** The trade-off is noise and space. Students here swap a backyard for a balcony with a view, and quiet streets for the constant buzz of trams and construction. It is exciting but can be exhausting for those who value silence.

# Cost

Melbourne CBD is characterised by some of the highest rent-per-square-meter rates in Victoria. While the entry price might look similar to Carlton, you usually get significantly less floor space. Expect to pay between AU$320 and AU$450+ per week for a room in a shared inner-city apartment, often with high competition. Private studios or one-bedroom apartments typically start from AU$500 and can easily exceed AU$700 per week for buildings with amenities like pools and gyms. Beyond the rent, which is well above the state average, the daily cost of living can be deceptively high due to the constant temptation of nearby conveniences and slightly pricier city supermarkets.

# Brunswick

# Proximity to the University

Located directly north of Parkville, Brunswick is the ""cool older sibling"" of Carlton. It is slightly further away but well-connected.

* Tram: The Number 19 tram runs straight down Sydney Road directly to the university gates, taking about 15 to 20 minutes depending on traffic.
* Train: The Upfield train line (Jewell or Brunswick Station) gets students to Royal Park station (near the zoo and the western side of campus) in under 10 minutes.

# Lifestyle

Brunswick is gritty, artistic, and fiercely local. It lacks the polished, elite feel of Carlton but makes up for it with character and community.

* Sydney Road: This is the longest shopping strip in the southern hemisphere. It is an eclectic mix of Middle Eastern bakeries (like the famous A1 Bakery for cheap lunches), secondhand stores like Savers, and live music venues like The Retreat.
* Vibe: It attracts arts students, musicians, and those who prefer a ""bohemian"" atmosphere. It is less about studying in silence and more about socialising in beer gardens, browsing op-shops on weekends, and enjoying live bands.
* Amenities: Barkly Square is a convenient shopping centre that covers all the basics (Coles, Woolworths, Kmart), making daily life easy without needing to go to the city.

# Cost

Brunswick is widely regarded as offering the best value for money, sitting at a ""mid-level"" price point that is often more affordable than the inner-city average while offering more living space. Your rental dollar stretches further here; a private room in a renovated weatherboard house generally costs between AU$230 and AU$350 per week, and modern one-bedroom apartments range from AU$420 to AU$550 per week. Although you will need to budget for public transport fares (Myki), the lower baseline rent combined with access to affordable fresh food markets on Sydney Road makes it a financially smarter choice for students on a budget.

# Conclusion: Which is Better?

Ultimately, the choice between these suburbs comes down to your personal priorities and lifestyle preferences. If your main goal is absolute academic focus and a zero-commute lifestyle, Carlton is the unbeatable winner, offering a safe and scholarly village atmosphere right at the university's doorstep. For those who crave the high-energy excitement of big-city living with endless shopping and dining options, the CBD is perfect, provided you are willing to trade space for convenience. However, if you prefer a community-focused, artistic vibe with more room to breathe and better value for money, Brunswick offers the ideal balance of culture and affordability for University of Melbourne students.",1,1769945913.0,u_Choice-Unit1277,0,1.0,False

1qsw8j5,https://www.reddit.com/r/manchester/comments/1qsw8j5/honest_thoughts_on_quality_of_life_in_manchester/,Honest thoughts on quality of life in Manchester,"It’s just me? I started overthinking a lot about the quality of life here and in the country in general, the quality of life leaves a lot to be desired. The streets are very dirty, pavements are broken everywhere, and the local council doesn’t seem to fix anything. From around 5 pm it gets very dark, and the street lighting is poor and barely illuminates the streets.

In the UK you pay a very high council tax, but you don’t really see where it goes. Sometimes it feels like it’s mostly spent dealing with drunk people from pubs rather than on proper city maintenance. Vomit on the streets is a common sight, especially in busy areas.

Everything feels quite outdated. Many restaurants are actually quite dirty, but they use dim lighting so the dirt isn’t as noticeable. Prices are extremely high: a coffee and a pastry cost around £8–10, and a burger in an average place is £15–20. With the salaries here, maintaining a decent quality of life is very difficult.

Public transport… better to not wear any new trousers or touch anything, at the same time ridiculously expensive. Mm trains? What can I say? Better to take a flight anywhere in europe, it will cost you cheaper than visiting another city in Uk, but someone will jump mentioning the railcard as usual. Last time, we were 4, and we took a 1.5 hour uber drive, was cheaper.

In Manchester specifically, even in and around the city centre, pavements are in very poor condition. There are many homeless people, vomit on the streets, and even the hospital itself feels dirty. It also feels like this country is heavily focused on London, while other cities are largely neglected. People are literally camping out on the main streets, and it looks normal. I wish I could help them or being a volunteer in any council action about them.

I feel working paying taxes and getting nothing back, I hasda bad experience having a relapse on my illness, called an ambulance and literally they asked me to take a cab.

1qsw3w6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1qsw3w6/is_it_really_over_between_us/,Is it really over between us,"Hello everyone, this is my first time doing anything like this but yeah of course I’m looking for advice.

In mid September I \\\[20F\\\] met this guy \\\[25M\\\] through college, we chatted for about a week online before he asked me out to coffee on the 26th of September and after that we started seeing other consistently everyweek and talking/ texting every day . Today we’ have been seeing each other for 4 months.

In that time we’ve opened up quite a bit to each other  for me When I was younger I experienced horrific multiple sa experiences and grew up in an abusive household to which and made me really uncomfortable to any forms of intimacy. I was pretty open about it on maybe our 3rd date not in detail but just how it’s something I still struggle with. He opened up about his childhood trauma along with the recent passing of his dad in late 2024.

Since then I would say become very close, a lot of intimate  moments including cuddling, staying the night over his, and of course I ended up liking a lot of physical affection with him. We also have been on multiple dates including out to dinner mini golfing and bar hopping or just late drives in the car. He has my jumper he says he sometimes sleeps with an I have his shirt I wear to bed quite often. He spent Christmas with my family and even said he loved me and he could tell I had a lot of love him.

However, back at the start of the new year he started becoming distant and suddenly everything was could do and might do, and we stopped texting as much. There was one day where I asked if he there ware any days he was off and he left me on delivered for two days until I said if he could please tell what I’ve done wrong. He ended up telling me that it was totally not me and it’s him and he’s got a lot of stuff going on with his family right now and ended up saying he’s not Just in the right headspace to be in a relationship right now because it’s a bad time for him and I’m a nice girl and he doesn’t want to hurt me by not giving me answers to what I want but he still wants to see me.

I asked him what he wanted to do and he said to take a step back I asked what that meant to him and he said he still fine for texts and dates but he’s just not sure if he’s ready be in a relationship and he needs to work on the way he speaks to me because he knows there’s been quite a few times he said something that upset me. He said he doesn’t think we should he all wound up tonight and he’ll text me the next day he did. And he ended up even keeping me in the loop on what’s happening and IT IS a life changing event. Due to his mums new boyfriend his two younger siblings moved in with him however because one of them is under age so he’ll need to go through social work.

We kept in contact everyday and even last Thursday( not Thursday just passed) we met up for the first Time in a month and he said he was sorry he didn’t see me as much as he could’ve or wanted to. We ended up having coffee for 2 1/2 hours before he had to go back to check on his sister instead of kissing me goodbye like he usually does hugged me and I had to initiate the kiss and said hell shoot me a text. He never did until I asked if everything was was okay with his sister and responded 5 hours later. Both of those things felt out of character but I ignored it because both in the car and later on that night he said I should be able to come over soon it’s just he’s trying to create a calm environment.

Since Thursday he started leaving me on delivered for 8-14 hours a time, barely talking. again just a bit unusual for him. I ended up messaging on Monday and asked if he wanted to go for a coffee this week since college was off (he dropped out and kept his job) and he didn’t want to get back to me in 27 hrs (Tuesday night m) saying he forgot to text me back and he was out with his friends and we’re definitely going to do something soon.  his behaviour on Thursday and not taking to me much didn’t know what to think, I didn’t answer straight away because I didn’t want to send a huge paragraph asking what was wrong so I waited until Thursday morning and said I’m sorry for not texting back I was trying to think of what to say and I just asked if everything was okay between us because it feels different. He didn’t respond on Saturday ( yesterday) I just sent a message like “hey! Do you want to go for coffee again same as last time” I checked this morning before work (Sunday ) and he read the message but didn’t respond.

Everyone in my life says basically it’s his fault and the part I agree with - “why can’t he just text you”. I’m genuinely heartbroken and I feel like it’s my fault for not speaking to him for a day but everyone’s saying it’s not like it would’ve made a difference and I thought at the time it was the mature thing to do so I didn’t send a big rant about how how I all I wanted was him to look at me the same way he did back in December.

I have uni offers and I need to focus on my future but I want him to speak to me and I didn’t want anything before him and I don’t want anything but him, my friend says he’s leading me on and said that at the start too. I just don’t understand what’s happening, if we’re still seeing each other, or if he just wants to stop completely then why not just tell me instead of keeping me in the dark and how long I should have hope for?

Like part of me is like oh he’ll get back to me when he’s ready but what if he never does? Does that mean I didn’t meant anything to him? And again why could he not just tell me if he needs space, time or just wants to stop completely?

Thanks :)

Do you guys have any suggestions on how to make cookies spread more? Okay na sa lasa but unless you actually shape them to be flatter, may nakaumbok siya sa middle. Included a reference pic, though not 1 to 1 (the edges aren't that crispy on mine). No actual pic because my siblings eat them up quick. Second pic is the dough.

1qsw0vw,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1qsw0vw/dont_waste_time_by_searching_after_meaning_of/,"dont waste time by searching after meaning of life, because here that is","Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

To introduce myself: I'm 25 male from Europe, graduated secondary school in 2019. Since then I've studied two semesters of archaeology, got a 2 year degree in Communications and am currently in my third semester of a bachelor's degree in Business Law. In between I worked a variety of jobs, mostly retail, some in Marketing and a brief stint at the world's most notorious car rental place.

After getting out of a long term relationship and moving back in with my parents, I am now considering one last switch to a different career, this time for good I hope. Business Law just ain't for me and I feel like University is a drag, especially while working part time.



Things that have always interested me, and which I could see a career in, are the following: 

- Writing jobs. I am a decent writer and have been dabbling with fiction and journalistic writing all throughout my school time. Even held a gig at a HiFi magazine for a while writing product reviews, but the pay was abysmal.

- Photography. I've been on and off with street photography over the years and it's a 'seasonal' hobby of mine. 

- Watchmaking/Goldsmithing. I'm no good at it. But I spent a week at a goldsmith's shop to try it out and that was the only time I ever wanted to work late into the night. The guy basically had to pry me off the chair so he could close up shop.

- Graphics Design/Layouting. Been doing this ever since middle school but as with all my creative pursuits, I feel less than adequate and I am very much afraid I just won't be any good.



My general interests, in case a career field I haven't heard of mixes well with them:

- Cars. Especially classic, I taught myself basically everything you would need to maintain a car and fix, plus then some.

- Philosophy. A recent interest, mostly around the personal growth and the ways to lead a good and miral life.

- Fiction. Be it SciFi, Fantasy, Grimdark, you name it - I love them all.

- Miscellaneous. I collect watches and love hiking & travelling.



Now I need to add that I have a strong desire to 'make it' and be successful. Pursuing business law was a choice made out of the longing to have made it at the end, but I realized that it's just a world of hurt to study for this and I don't see myself being happy in this career long-term. I'd like to add that I'd be open to moving for a few years to pursue a career. Any suggestions, experiences or advice would be appreciated.",1,1769944887.0,careeradvice,0,1.0,False

Like a lot of us, I kept it all inside for way too long, and it made everything harder. I've realized how much human connection matters—sometimes just having someone to chat with over coffee, share a laugh, or even talk openly about the hard stuff can change things.
This is a casual, welcoming space in Tauranga for anyone feeling isolated, dealing with mental health ups and downs, or just wanting more real friendships. No pressure to dive deep if you're not ready—we can keep it light with coffee catch-ups, beach walks, park hangs, or whatever feels easy. The main thing is: you don't have to suffer alone. We're all in this together, and it's okay to be open about what you're going through.
Everyone's welcome—no judgment, no fixing required. Come as you are, stay as long as you like, and let's build some genuine connections one chat at a time.

1qsvy0i,https://i.redd.it/b0czy9ah5vgg1.jpeg,I haven't owned a SAK in 30 years. Last week I bought five. Send help.,"**The Origin Story** When I was ten, I was the king of the neighborhood with a red **Spartan** and a black **Huntsman**. I used them for everything—mostly just fidgeting until the springs probably screamed for mercy. Fast forward through three decades of ""adulthood,"" and Reddit has once again claimed my wallet. First it was LEGO, then vintage Matchbox cars, then Hi-Fi audio.

Last week, I was innocently researching Schmidt EasyFlow 9000 refills when I took a wrong turn into the world of EDC. I saw an **Alox** scale for the first time and... well, I blacked out. Five packages later, here we are. My wife is currently humoring me, but I think she’s mostly relieved I’m not buying another set of floor speakers.

**The Lineup (and my ""very logical"" justifications):**

* **Companion Slim (Bladeless) Alox:** My absolute favorite. It lives on the coffee table. I used the scissors to snip a loose thread yesterday, so it has already paid for itself in my mind. It’s the ultimate fidget toy for watching TV.
* **Bantam Alox:** My second favorite. It’s tucked into my wallet. If I’m honest, it will likely never see the light of day, but knowing it's there makes me feel 10% more prepared for a disaster that will never happen.
* **Pioneer X Alox:** This lives in my car’s center console. I won’t be performing any roadside repairs with it, but it’s great for testing the spring tension while sitting in standstill traffic.
* **Cadet Alox:** I bought this purely because you guys told me I had to. It’s currently suspended on a keychain inside my briefcase. It will probably never see the sun again, but it ""feels right"" knowing the briefcase is now tactical.
* **Ranger 55 Wood:** The outlier. It stays in my bedside table. I won't be doing any bushcrafting in the master bedroom, but the wood scales feel incredible. I've told myself the locking blade is for ""self-defense,"" as if I’m going to successfully fend off an intruder with a very polite Swiss saw.

**The Verdict** I have no real use for these. I work in an office. But the nostalgia is real, the Alox feels like jewelry, and the ""snap"" of the tools is just as satisfying as it was 30 years ago.

Am I done? Or is there a sixth one I’m ""missing"" that I’ll inevitably buy by Tuesday?",54,1769944853.0,victorinox,8,1.0,False

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Now that I'm back on the grid, I'm finding it really difficult to date, or even understand the whole concept of dating these days. I find it hard to break the ice with girls sometimes. wonder if it's just me, or if I've been out of the game for so long that I can't flirt anymore or come up with cheesy lines. genuinely don't know what women like these days or what they're looking for.

Dating apps are the worst. Everyone seems weird, fake, or wannabe, mostly just looking for hookups with unrealistic expectations. It honestly felt easier a few years back. You liked someone, sent a DM, talked for months, and then started dating. Or you just asked them out for coffee. Simple.

I personally feel that people nowadays have too many options and are exposed to constant overstimulation through Instagram, social media, and dating apps. Slowly, it feels like we're becoming numb, losing empathy towards others, and preferring distance over real connection

The whole ""If it doesn't work out, then...A,B,C""

Outside of church and work, I'm hearing women say this regarding other social circles as well, even within friendship circles, they feel they shouldn't be dating. I met a woman that's into the same geeky stuff I am, and when I asked her out (I knew her for a while before she divorced), she said she doesn't date within her social circles.

I'm also in a board game group, and when I asked this woman out from the group, she said she doesn't date within the group, if it doesn't work, that would mean not returning to the group to do what she enjoys.

Of course, you can say that about anywhere, but I think that's how online dating became so popular....you're not risking anything, you just meet for coffee/lunch whatever, if it doesn't work out, you go your separate ways and never see each other again.

Before online, if you dated from within your circles of any sort, you were risking it all for the sake of romance. If it didn't work out, friendships became severed, or the ability to enjoy the group will be omitted from your life.

So the system is throwing everything at us to keep us occupied and distracted and angry and frustrated and so on. 
I am more and more convinced that the solution to our dilemma is neutrality and letting go of everything we think is important and everything we think is us which includes our ego character personality wants desires needs all of that is temporary clothing for our eternal spirit which is ultimately beyond all of this when we get down to our true pure unadulterated essence none of this that happens here matters at all. 
Some of us have had a glimpse of what that feels like or we remember vaguely that that we are not the body the personality or even the mind. That in the space between thoughts and beyond the mind in that stillness and nothingness is our true home which is paradoxically more whole and expanded and powerful than we can comprehend in these flesh suits. I leave with you tonight this video from a channel I've been watching now for a while. There is a lot of truth in this video and I think it will resonate with many I don't know who is making this videos but I'm very grateful for them. 
It just resonates with me and for some reason this year 2026 I've been able to let go of a lot of attachments just in the last month which is really turned things around for me. 
Something is changing something is shifting in me that is making it much easier for me to just be.. to just be! 
Not needing to fill some gap with junk food or weed or coffee or a woman or waste hours thinking about the past or what might be the future anyway you get the point. 
I've become more neutral in a way where it's not that I don't care anymore but I've realized that being frustrated or angry or anxious or fed up just feeds the system with exactly what it wants from us. 
So the solution is simply to stop feeding the system and stop taking the bait. 
If we fight we just keep it going. 
If we just stop and I'm even talking about stopping thinking. 
Expanding the space between thoughts until all there is is space nothingness but that is not an empty thing it is a very full peaceful and powerful state that is hard to put into words cuz even language is a part of this system.

so im in a friend group with a girl (F18) and my best friend (M19) so this friend group started when me and my best friend met this girl ( lets name her R ), i liked her, she liked me, we we're flirting and having fun together ( she was my first kiss ) but didnt get into a relationship because neither one of us wanted to ( i didn't want to get into a relationship with her because she just got out of a 2 years relationship with a cheating ex )
but then she made it clear that she didn't like me anymore and just see me as a friend, i was okay with that but i we kept talking daily and all the time, then i noticed a shift in her behavior, she started to be bit distant and colder towards me, but started to treat my best friend, the same way she was treating me when we we're in the "" we like each other and having fun "" phase.

Anyways, that made me suspicious, and i thought there might be something going on between them, so i asked him multiple times and he denied it, saying "" i told you bro before, there is nothing between me and her, and you know she is still attached and love her ex, and im only staying friends with her just for the sake of the friendship i have with her"". and when i asked her, she threw a tantrum, saying there was nothing going on and she doesn't like anybody and not attracted to anyone, and he ( my best friend ) didnt even think about these types of things, and im overreacting, anyways, 2 days after that, she tells me shes putting limits for me and my best friends so nobody misunderstood and nobody would think she likes someone just by hugging them.

i respect that and didnt initiate any type of contact since she told me about the limits, but she kept calling every few days to hang out but since she told me about the limits i was stressed about losing her and i knew and she knew that i was attached to her.


during that time my best friend disappeared for two days and i went to his house to check up on him since he wasnt answering and he was going through some problems, we talked about his problems but then we started to talk about her, i told him how hurt i was and how i noticed few things and lies about her, and he agreed with me, but all of the suden he told me he will not speak to her again, and he actually didnt speak to her for a week and would show me any messages she sent to him.


few days later she called me and told me that she needs to talk to me and we need to meet now, i agreed and met her at the coffee shop, and she told me everything

She told me about how my best friend and she liked each other but there was nothing physical or sexual or anything just two people that like each other and also she said she didnt like how he ignored her since he disappeared, moreover,  she made it clear that she didnt like how i never initiated contact since the day she told me about the limits, and i replied to that by "" that was your decision and i respect that, i didnt want to make you uncomfortable or anything"", but she just nodded,

while we we're there her Ex ( thats a whole other story where we talked to her about not contacting him again but she still went back to him ) came with his friend and sat in the same table with us, and while i was talking to her, she turned to her ex's friend and joked about how he cheated on her 4 times and tried to kill her once.

anyways, i kept thinking about what she told me for a week before speaking to my best friend about it.


So when i confronted him, he first denied it, then confessed everything, how she told him "" i like you"" first ( she lied about that saying he liked her first ) and how would flirt with him, and he told me that they kissed multiple times. Turns out she played and used me and my best friend while still keeping contact and going out with her EX

Anyways we talked for 3 hours and exposed all her lies and i exposed all his lies and he didnt deny any this times and he said i will be completely honest about it, when i asked him why didnt he say anything before, he said he was scared and didnt know what to do especially he didnt want to worsen my health conditions ( i got diagnosed with Myocardite during the time she changed between me and him ), i didnt say anything to him and thanked him for telling me about it and left, but i kept thinking about everything, the times how i would be waiting for a reply while she was with my best friend, and the times i would ask him/her if there is something and they would lie to my face, but i didnt cut contact with him, i became a bit distant and quieter, but still would hang out with him, but everytime i do, she comes through my mind and my chest and heart would get heavy.


Now its been 3 weeks since i had that conversation with him, and 1 month since i last talked to her and i moved on from her, im no longer attached to her or waiting for her to text me and i no longer have the urges to text her ( i dont even want to see her or speak to her at all now ), i spent those weeks thinking about the whole situation, and i realized its not the physical/sexual contact they had or the relationship they had, but the lies, the disrespect, thats what have been hurting me, the times where they would have the audacity to lie to my face and then sleep like nothing happened ( keep in mind that both of them know that i hate lying the most ).


I became quieter and more distant that usual to everyone, and thats not me, im a joyful person who laughs and always positive.

I know im still young and would go through many other things in life.


But im struggling  to deal with the lies and how they disrespected me.


this is why im seeking help and advice from you guys, maybe some of you can give me some eye-opener advice on things i didn't see or know

Although not massive puzzles it opened my eyes to unusual puzzle pieces and how you need to throw all previously learned puzzling tactics out of the window. The amount of times I convinced myself that pieces were missing… they were not missing, I was just not seeing the fit! 

I started with the doughnut and tried my usual sorting method, and you can see by the coffee cup I was a bit more tactical. The challenge being that not all pieces that look like edge pieces are edge pieces, and vice versa, and the pattern you might expect on just one piece in fact is across two or more pieces. 

The pieces fit together really nicely and made fitting all those obscure pieces together even more satisfying. They are really robust once made too, you can hold them up and move them around very easily!

But somewhere, beyond the veil of this rigid reality, there is a version of us that breathes.

This is for that life

**Maybe in that life**, we don't have to say goodbye at the door. We meet, and the world doesn't pull us apart; it conspires to keep us together.

**Maybe in that life**, we fall in love like a landslide, sudden and inevitable. **We love with a ferocity that finally feels like peace.** We date on rainy Tuesdays, we make love until our souls are so tangled that I don't know where I end and you begin, and we never, not once, have to wonder if we’re allowed to stay.

**Maybe in that life**, we’d marry in a ceremony that feels like a secret, just us, a few witnesses, and a vow that doesn't feel like a heavy weight, but a wingspan.

**Maybe in that life**, we’d buy that house. A home filled with the smell of brewing coffee and the echoes of our laughter. We would cook together, flour on our clothes and wine in our glasses, and we’d dance in the kitchen to no music at all, just the rhythm of finally being home.

**Maybe in that life**, the house would grow loud. We’d have children who are echoes of **our love made bone and breath.** We would see ourselves in their eyes and watch them find loves of their own, passing on the fire we started. We’d have our ups and downs, our storms and our silences, but they wouldn't break us. They would just be the seasons of a life we actually got to live.

**Maybe in that life** ,we’d grow silver and soft, our faces etched with the history of us. And when the time came to leave, we wouldn’t be afraid. We’d close our eyes in a room full of photos and ghosts of laughter, passing away in the same breath, knowing we used up every drop of joy. A life lived so fully that death feels like nothing more than the final page of a very long, very happy book.

**But in this life... I have to let you go.**

I’ll keep this dream in my pocket like a lucky coin. I’ll look for you in the next world, and the one after that.

I’ll look for you until the universe finally gets us right.

**Wait for me there. I’ll come find you.**

My machine has 15 grind settings (1 finest to 15 coarsest). I have bought fresh dark roast beans from ""Moin Bohne"", they recommend using a fine grind.

With a grind setting of 4 (which works with supermarket lavazza non fresh beans fyi), and with the basket filled up to the correct quantity indicator (around 17g on a double basket), the machine chokes and doesn't let out a single drop of coffee.

I have to use grind settings of around 9 / 10, which are quite coarse - coarser than I've ever used with supermarket beans.

  
With these settings, the pressure remains in the optimal range and a coffee is extracted.

  
Considering the hardware - and I'm not buying a new machine now - what could I do to successfully get a finger grind of this coffee extracted? And do I even need it? Coffee tastes good.

I pictured myself constantly checking my bank account, eating instant noodles, and awkwardly trying to make friends in hostels. Turns out, my imagination was working overtime. My first solo trip wasn't just doable; it was way less intimidating and significantly more affordable than I ever imagined, proving that those ""it's too expensive/dangerous/lonely"" myths are mostly just noise.

Here's a quick rundown of what my first solo dive into Southeast Asia actually looked like:

*   **My Route & Timeframe:** I spent about 3.5 weeks crisscrossing a few spots.
    *   **Thailand:** Started in Bangkok (a few days to navigate the initial chaos and get oriented), then headed up to Chiang Mai for a solid week (exploring temples, taking a cooking class, visiting an ethical elephant sanctuary).
    *   **Vietnam:** Flew to Hanoi, explored for a few days, then did a memorable 2-day Ha Long Bay cruise.
    *   **Cambodia:** Ended in Siem Reap for a few days to soak in Angkor Wat at sunrise and sunset.
*   **Budget Breakdown (Roughly):** My biggest discovery was how far a little money could stretch.
    *   **Accommodation:** Consistently found decent hostel dorms for $8-$12/night. *Yep, that $10/night budget was totally real and not even hard to find.* Look for places with good common areas – that's where the magic happens for meeting people.
    *   **Food:** Street food and local eateries were my go-to. I easily ate delicious, filling meals for $2-$5. I maybe ""splurged"" on a sit-down meal or a nicer coffee once or twice a week, which would be $10-$15.
    *   **Transport:** Local buses, Grab (their version of Uber/Lyft), and walking kept costs low. Overnight trains in Thailand were great for covering distance and essentially saving on a night's accommodation. A typical city Grab ride might be $2-4.
    *   **Activities:** Many temples are free or low cost. Longer excursions like the 2-day Ha Long Bay tour ($80-120 depending on the boat/provider) or the Angkor Wat pass (~$37 for one day) were the bigger spends, but absolutely worth it. I averaged around *$30-40 per day overall* on the ground, not including international flights or flights between countries.
*   **Meeting People:** This was the biggest, most pleasant surprise. I connected with so many other solo travelers in hostel common rooms, on free walking tours, and even just waiting for a bus. Most were in the same boat, looking to share experiences. Shared meals, day trips, or just chatting over a local beer happened daily. *I was rarely actually alone unless I chose to be.*

Now, it wasn't all sunsets and cheap pad thai. There were moments that tested my comfort zone:

*   **The Initial Jolt:** Landing in Bangkok solo was a sensory overload – the heat, the smells, the sheer volume of people. For about 24 hours, I honestly thought, ""What have I done?"" But pushing through that initial overwhelm was key. Get a cheap massage, find some street food, and just *be*. It gets easier.
*   **A Little Sick Bay:** Yep, I had a minor bout of food poisoning in Vietnam. Not fun, but manageable. Stock up on rehydration salts and basic meds before you leave, and remember that local pharmacies are surprisingly helpful. It made me appreciate feeling good even more.
*   **Unexpected Friendships:** I arrived thinking I'd spend most of my time alone, maybe meeting a few people casually. Instead, I found myself traveling with new friends for days at a time, sharing stories and laughs. It taught me that genuine connections are everywhere if you're open to them, even if it's just for an afternoon.
*   **The Magic of Saying Yes (and No):** Learning to say 'yes' to spontaneous invites (like a group heading to a night market) and 'no' to things that didn't feel right (like another busy temple when I just wanted to chill) was a huge part of the experience. My plans shifted constantly, and that was totally fine. Flexibility is your best friend.

If you've been on the fence about your first solo trip, or if the thought of it seems too daunting or expensive, I'm here to tell you it's probably way more attainable and rewarding than you think. You don't need a massive budget or years of experience. Just a passport and an open mind.

I think it's the best watch in the world: cheap, cool design, parts easily replacable and very dependable. Same as many things built in the '90s and early 2000s. Things were modular, unique and built to last: old Nokias, low-consumption cars, etc. 

Today everything is streamlined, optimized, smart, and insanely complex. All the cars, smart phones, tvs look the same. While I admit that smart watches are fun, I think they are too complex for the simple task that they're fulfilling and are essentially unnecessary. This is a philosophical question, but I think comfort and omnipotence should not be the driving forces behind technology. It should be reliability and endurability. Things in my childhood and before were built to last. My mom has a coffee grinder that belonged to her mom. That thing is at least 60 years old and it never had to be replaced or mended! How cool is that? 

How cool are Casio watches or old Nokia phones? They had everything we needed at that time. I wish technology had slowed down or had come to a halt around 2000 and we could slowly adapt to it, play with it, learn how to repair it etc. People would learn to fix radios and classic cars instead of buying a new one that has chips in it everywhere and nobody knows what to do with them when they break down.

Not dating, not being a couple, talking a lot, running, doing gym together, having coffee etc. She used to keep some guy (call him X) around, seemed like some toxic/dependent stuff, him being unhappy and her just keeping him at arm's length.

I always found her very attractive and liked her, though she was somewhat weird. But it wasn't anything like crush.

During one deeper conversation we started talking about ""us""--it just happened. And then ... ""please, just hug me and kiss me."" I said ""right, you're a mind reader, I'm going to do it."" Damn, it felt so good and right... ""Do you mind X being around?""--the other guy. ""No,"" I said, but knew too well it's going to be either X or me, treating him as a weakling and easy to get rid of. And thought of her acting strange and not fair, given her religious views. Hoped that was only temporary.

It ended somewhat abruptly after a week, before xmas. No reason, dumped just like that, between my final exams and thesis deadline. After her saying she would support me and accept a bit of long/mid-distance relationship--I was about to leave and work abroad for a few months. It did hurt a lot.

Was she avoidant? All I know she couldn't (or didn't want to) explain her behavior. No apologies. And later I learned she had serious mental problems only months later, a nervous breakdown or so, and had to be hospitalized.

About a year or two passed and we met again, her being not as cute as previously, taking antidepressants etc., started talking me into another level of whatever kind of closer stuff; and I told her to get tf out of my life ... Which was rude and immature.

We met a week ago. She doesn't remember such details and still doesn't bother. We agreed it was strange and we blew it totally. We forgave each other and laughed, and it was possible for me to ask--did I act clingy/anxiously? No, apparently. Though the nightmare that followed the breakup was most likely my typical reaction: 

`dumped = worth nothing.`

The Verdict: The classic athletic look. This is my go-to ""airport fit"" or for grabbing a quick coffee. The silhouette is clean and sporty.

The Cons: The fabric feels a bit ""plasticky"" and synthetic rather than premium cotton. The proportions are also bizarre: the pants are comically long (dragging on the floor), while the waist is tight enough to cut off circulation.

2. Corteiz (CRTZ) Alcatraz Jacket
The Verdict: Perfectly nails the current UK drill/streetwear trend. The Alcatraz logo is sharp, and the technical shell look is elite for rainy days.

The Cons: The zipper hardware feels incredibly cheap—expect to struggle with it every time you zip up. It’s also strictly a windbreaker; it’s paper-thin with zero warmth, more for the ""aesthetic"" than actual utility.

W2C: https://weidian.com/item.html?itemID=7673178316

3. Chrome Hearts (CH) Gothic Tee
The Verdict: Heavyweight cotton with a great drape. The black-and-white gothic print looks hardcore and high-quality.

The Cons: The massive rubberized print on the back is a total sweat trap. It’s like wearing a layer of plastic film—zero breathability in the summer. Also, the neck hole is so small it’s like fighting a wrestler just to get your head through.

4. Summer Mesh Jersey
The Verdict: Weightless and incredibly breathable. This is a lifesaver for outdoor festivals or high-heat summer days.

The Cons: The mesh is dangerously ""honest."" It’s highly see-through; unless you want to flash the entire neighborhood, you’ll definitely need a tank top underneath.

5. Prada Triangle Badge Tee
The Verdict: The peak of ""Quiet Luxury."" The metal triangle badge is crisp and looks very premium.

The Cons: It’s a ruthless European slim fit. If you have even a hint of a ""dad bod,"" this shirt will broadcast it to the world. Also, the nylon pocket patch is a total lint magnet.

6. Corteiz Sleeveless Tee (Tank Top)
The Verdict: An absolute banger for the gym. The print placement and font are 1:1, giving off that perfect retro-street vibe.

The Cons: The armholes are cut comically deep. There is a high ""nipple slip"" risk if you’re doing anything other than standing perfectly still. Wear with caution in public!

So far I have a pair of shoes she picked out and wanted. I also plan to get a custom portrait of her and my grandmother (her mother) who passed just a few weeks ago. She also is a bit of a coffee addict so I’m thinking I’ll try get a voucher for her favourite coffee place. 

She genuinely doesn’t have much particular interests or hobbies. She likes normal things eg. crime shows but not anything she’s super passionate about or would want a gift of if that makes sense. She likes shopping and clothes but I feel like I want something more personal since it’s such a big birthday. She doesn’t really care for flowers etc and I get those for her as a spontaneous thing anyway.

I’d like an idea for something for us/her to do on the actual day. We were going to go for dinner with the family but some of them are away so it’s not possible. She’s already having a night out with her friends the weekend before.

Budget: up to 150 (I’m in college and only work weekends).

I looked at him and felt... nothing…
Not anger. Not love. Just this blank space where us used to live…
Seven years of marriage. Two kids. A mortgage. And we had become roommates who occasionally had sex.. The pizza was supposed to be our date night. But we sat on opposite ends of the couch, him watching sports, me scrolling Instagram, sharing a pepperoni in silence ...
I remember thinking: Is this it? Is this what we fought for?
That night, I cried in the bathroom. Not dramatic movie tears. Just... exhaustion ... The kind that comes from loving someone but forgetting how to like them.
The rule we laughed at
A friend told us about the 777 thing six months earlier. Every 7 days, a date. Every 7 weeks, a night away. Every 7 months, a real vacation.
We laughed. Who has time for that??.. We were busy. Successful. The kids needed us. The house needed us. Our careers needed us ….
We didn't need a rule. We needed ... what? I couldn't even name it.
But that pizza night broke something. Or maybe it broke something open. Because the next morning, I looked at him sleeping and realized I didn't want to lose him. I just didn't know how to find him again ...
The first real date
We started stupidly small Seven days later, we went to that diner we used to love. The one with the sticky menus and terrible coffee.
I wore jeans that weren't yoga pants. He shaved. We sat across from each other like strangers, awkward as teenagers.
What do you do all day??? I asked him.
He looked confused. You know what I do. I work…
No, I said. What do you do??? What makes you laugh? What pisses you off? I used to know.
And he told me. About his asshole coworker. About the project he's actually proud of. About how sometimes he sits in his car in the driveway for ten minutes before coming inside because he needs silence.
I hadn't asked in years. He hadn't offered.
The night away that changed everything
Seven weeks later,,, we left the kids with my mother. Drove two hours to a crappy motel with a broken ice machine. Cost $89.
We didn't have sex. We talked until 3 AM. About the miscarriage we never discussed. About how he felt like a paycheck to me. About how I felt invisible as just a mom.
The words hurt. But the silence afterward didn't. We held hands in the dark, listening to the highway outside, and I felt him come back. Not all at once. But piece by piece.
Why the number doesn't matter
Some people say rules kill romance. It should be natural, they say. Spontaneous.
Those people probably aren't drowning in laundry and deadlines and the thousand tiny betrayals of a busy life.
For us, the number was a lifeline. Not because seven is magic. Because we needed permission to prioritize us. We needed to count, because we had stopped counting each other as important.
Sometimes it's 5 days, not 7. Sometimes it's a lunch date, not dinner. The rule isn't the point. The remembering is.
What I want u to know
If you're reading this at 2 AM, wondering where he went - the man you married, the man who used to look at you like you were the only person in the room - he's still there ..…
You're still there.
But u have to hunt for each other. In the chaos. In the exhaustion. In the maybe tomorrow that becomes maybe next month that becomes maybe never.
Start with one date. One real conversation. One night where you remember why you chose this person.
The pizza isn't enough. The couch isn't enough. You need to leave the house, leave the roles, leave the everything else, and find each other again.
We almost didn't. That pizza night could have been the beginning of the end. Instead, it was the end of the beginning.
Now, seven months later, we're planning our first real trip. Just us. No kids. No agenda. I'm terrified and excited in equal measure.
Because loving him again means risking losing him again. But not loving him? That's a death I don't want to die.
When did you last really see your husband? Not the father, not the provider. The man. Tell me below ....
This 777 thing saved my marriage. I actually wrote down a detailed guide/framework of how we implemented it with all the awkward conversation starters to help a friend. If anyone is going through this and wants it, I'm happy to share.

1qsvdpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1qsvdpe/meds_feeling_tired/,"Meds, feeling tired","Hey everyone! So I am on Medikinet Adult since 22nd of january and I‘ts definitely been a Journey.

I got diagnosed in December at 23.

With 10mg I felt close to nothing so I gradually changed it to 20mg in the morning and 10 at noon. 

I have a problem that is also occurring while writing this post, i swear I yawned like 10 times already. I am soooo tired. I used to never be able to really “wake up” without coffee so I am so used to it by now. But when I do drink coffee it’s as if I don’t feel the effects of the medication. This is all really confusing to me because I thought coffee would maybe increase the effectiveness, not decrease it?? 

And the effects… I take medikinet adult (i can’t use the word for it bc it’s nit allowed in the sub but it’s those ones where 50% of it gets released later) . So I have read the effects should be there for 8 hours, for most it’s about 4-6 hours. With me I feel like after 1,5 hours I am productive for like 2 hrs, my mind is quiet and I have a sort of “inner peace” andI am still sort of tired. and then it’s back to completely tired and can’t stop yawning. The 10mg I take at noon doesn’t seem to help at all. I do not feel it in any way. I feel like it gives me peace and focus for 2 hours a day but takes the rest of mg day completely away from me because I can’t drink coffee. 

I live in Germany so it’s a nightmare to get an appointment with a psychiatrist. Mine told me I’d get one in a year. I don’t know what to do.",5,1769942923.0,ADHD,10,1.0,False

Digvijay never completely liked Rajat as Rajat is criminal obvi. He considered Rajat as friend. Rajat considered him as brother for no reason.

In BB when Dig entered, Rajat started cozying up to Dig cuz in his mind Dig is his support to victory but Dig was there to play his own game.

Rajat was gundagardi n abusive types in BB house which caused Dig to not like him zyada. He used to be with Rajat but majorly was seen with Shrutika and eventually karanveer mehra group. (When Shrutika was kicked out of that group).

One time Rajat saved Dig from elimination but it was unrequired as among the 6-7 ppl nominated Dig was in top 3 according to votes (announced by BB).

Then there was one task where they had to collect tea packets and Vivian Dzena's coffee packet was also part of that. Most packets jiske paas honge will win. Rajat was contender for captain so Dig collected and performed very well for Rajat. He also collected Vivian's coffee and gave to Rajat and told him to not give and gave dosti ki kasam. Rajat wanted alliance with Vivian as Vivian is top 3 walaa contestant so Rajat gave Viv his coffee back.

This upset Dig and he stopped talking to Rajat. But BB being biased started painting as if Dig is suddenly rejecting Rajat friendship for no reason after using him for immunity from nominations. Rajat also started saying this. 

Dig anyways wanted to cut off from that Gunda. Later Dig had fight with eisha where eisha told him to kiss/lick her ass and Dig pointed at Eisha's friend Avinash and told her to ask Avinash to do that. Eisha suddenly played woman card. Rajat who regarded Eisha as sister got physical with Dig. And this was end of their friendship.",22,1769942905.0,The50IN,7,0.86,False

Intention and context. Basically, if you are somewhere more or less social, a concert, sports, a random event and you hear someone mention an artist you like, a niche podcast, a show just jump in a little. Throw a comment in the situation. A question. Where do you know that artist from? Who was your favourite character. Some people respond some don’t. Your intention is important, i am just happy talking to random strangers. Sometimes you just have a small convo and move on. Sometimes you click and talk a bit longer. And then just ask them if they want to grab a coffee. Not even in a romantic sense. You text, you suggest a time. Boom, new friend. Or date.

Recently, I’ve been staying, at my partners place which has a lot more hard water than I do. Staying here has been contemporaneous with buying some really high-end coffees from Skylark as well as a new K7 grinder so I’ve been working with a lot of variables and practically shooting for the moon.

I decided to go for some bottled water and just bought the cheapest from lidl. I tried it, but didn’t notice any obvious improvement.. I did a little research and found that this water was evidently exceedingly bad and promptly found an alternative- in this case Aqua Pura- something available in the UK at most corner shops in 5 l jugs. The experience was night and day with a 96 anaerobic ferment. There was genuinely so much obvious fruit and sweetness and brightness- not even acidity per se- just a lot more flavour all around.

1qsv9jg,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlyGoodContent/comments/1qsv9jg/url使用where_monash_university_clayton_students_live/,URL使用：where monash university clayton students live,"# Where Should Students Live Near Monash University Clayton Campus?

Moving to Melbourne to study is a significant life event, and for students enrolling at Australia's largest university campus, finding the right base is crucial. The Monash University Clayton Campus is located about 20 kilometres southeast of the Melbourne CBD, which can be a long distance. While the campus itself is a self-contained hub, the surrounding suburbs each offer a distinctly different lifestyle, budget range, and commute experience. Whether prioritising a 5-minute walk to lectures or desiring a vibrant culinary scene on the weekends, there is a neighbourhood to suit every preference. Here is a detailed guide to the best places to live near Monash University Clayton Campus.

# Clayton

# Why Clayton?

Clayton is the most convenient and academically focused Melbourne suburb for students, effectively serving as Monash University's backyard. It allows residents to walk to class in under 15 minutes or take a quick ride on the campus bus loop, significantly reducing daily travel time and transport costs.

# Accommodation Options

* Clayton offers a variety of housing: older brick houses converted into student shares, modern townhouses, and dedicated student apartment blocks.
* Competition for [Monash University student accommodation](https://en.uhomes.com/au/melbourne/monash-university-clayton-campus) before the start of each semester is high due to proximity to campus, so booking early is essential.
* Melbourne rental platforms like [uhomes.com](http://uhomes.com) offers a wide selection of student housing options. Students can find **single rooms in shared houses** on streets like Beddoe Avenue or **private studios** in newer developments. [**uhomes.com**](http://uhomes.com) helps students secure Melbourne Clayton accommodation quickly and safely, providing verified listings, detailed property descriptions, and filters for price, distance, and facilities.

https://preview.redd.it/129uaqpq3vgg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5d460c2ea0ebc2860114fc3d94307a75a37e10cd

# Cost

Rent Range: A$250-400 per week

Due to the unparalleled convenience, landlords know they can charge a premium. While it is not the most expensive suburb in Melbourne, the rent-to-quality ratio can sometimes be skewed. Students often pay for the location rather than luxury. However, sharing a house with other students remains a cost-effective strategy compared to renting a one-bedroom apartment alone.

# Lifestyle

Clayton offers a practical, high-energy lifestyle. The area is anchored by Clayton Road, a strip packed with Asian grocers, budget-friendly eateries, and essential services. The Hong Kong Supermarket is a local staple for international groceries. Moreover, the addition of the M-City development has revitalised the area, introducing a Village Cinemas, Kmart, and a wide range of dining options. It provides students with entertainment without needing to travel to the city. The vibe is transient and academic-focused, bustling with students dragging suitcases or carrying architectural models.

# Ideal For

First-year students adjusting to a new country, students without a car, and those with heavy course loads who need quick access to campus facilities 24/7.

Why Use uhomes.com?  
[**uhomes.com**](http://uhomes.com) is a dedicated student housing platform that helps students **find, compare, and book verified rentals** in Clayton and across Melbourne city. It simplifies the search, highlights local amenities, and provides detailed cost and transport information, ensuring students make right decisions efficiently.

# Glen Waverley

# Why Glen Waverley?

Glen Waverley is a premium lifestyle destination known for its safety, cleanliness, and upscale amenities. It is situated approximately 10 minutes by car or a direct 15-minute ride on the 737 bus from Monash campus, offering a perfect balance of luxury living and accessibility.

# Accommodation Options

Housing here leans towards the higher end. Students will find luxury high-rise apartments, particularly near the train station and shopping centre, such as the Sky Garden development. There are also spacious, modern townhouses and family homes that offer homestay opportunities. The quality of housing is generally superior to that of the older stock found in Clayton.

# Cost

Rent Range: A$300-500 per week

Glen Waverley is one of the pricier suburbs in the region. Rents reflect the access to premium amenities, the safety of the neighbourhood, and the high demand from families wanting to live in the school zones. It is an investment in lifestyle and comfort.

# Lifestyle

The lifestyle in Glen Waverley revolves around ""The Glen"" shopping centre and the famous Kingsway dining precinct. Kingsway comes alive at night, offering a dense concentration of restaurants, bubble tea shops, dessert bars, and karaoke venues. It is a haven for foodies. Transport is convenient, with a direct train line to the city. Getting to Monash University requires a short drive or a trip on the 737 bus, which stops directly in the campus bus loop.

# Ideal For

Students with a higher budget, food lovers who enjoy late-night dining, and those who prefer a modern, safe, and bustling environment over a quiet suburban street.

# Oakleigh

# Why Oakleigh?

Oakleigh is a vibrant cultural centre famous for its European village atmosphere and major transport connections. It sits just 3 kilometres from campus, allowing students to reach the university via a short bus ride from the interchange or a quick train connection to Huntingdale station.

# Accommodation Options

The area features a mix of charming, older weatherboard houses with large backyards and a surging number of new apartment complexes near the train station. The new builds offer modern amenities and security, appealing to international students looking for low-maintenance living.

# Cost

Rent Range: A$250-450 per week

Oakleigh generally offers better value for money than Glen Waverley. While prices have risen due to its popularity, students can often find spacious rooms in share houses or reasonably priced modern apartments that cost less than similar properties in the CBD.

# Lifestyle

Culture is the defining feature here. Eaton Mall is a pedestrian-only strip that smells constantly of roasting coffee and charcoal meat. It is the perfect spot for brunch or late-night cakes at renowned venues like Nikos Cakes. The Oakleigh Central market also provides excellent fresh produce at competitive prices. Commuting to Monash is simple via the bus interchange (connecting to the 900 or 800 series buses) or a quick train ride to Huntingdale to catch the shuttle.

# Ideal For

Coffee aficionados, students who appreciate a strong community atmosphere, and those who want excellent train access to the rest of Melbourne.

https://preview.redd.it/j51zwstt3vgg1.jpg?width=1600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bbdaaf61566923ed936a3b02c0c20377695ffcc1

# Carnegie

# Why Carnegie?

Carnegie is a safe, leafy suburb that doubles as a major Asian food destination for the southeast. Located about 5 kilometres away, it offers a manageable 15-20 minute commute via the 626 bus or a train to Huntingdale station, followed by a university shuttle.

# Accommodation Options

Carnegie is known for its solid 1970s brick walk-up apartments, which are often more spacious and soundproof than newer builds. However, recent years have seen a boom in modern apartment developments along the railway corridor, providing plenty of inventory for renters.

# Cost

Rent Range: A$320-480 per week

As young professionals move into the area, prices have crept up. However, it remains affordable compared to inner-city suburbs. Share houses here are common and offer a good standard of living.

# Lifestyle

Koornang Road is the heart of Carnegie and is arguably one of the best food streets in the southeast. It features a dense collection of Korean, Thai, Japanese, and dumpling restaurants. The suburb also has both Woolworths and Aldi supermarkets within walking distance. Transport is excellent; students can take the train to Huntingdale station and switch to the express bus loop for university, or take the 626 bus.

# Ideal For

Foodies (especially Asian cuisine fans), students who want to mentally separate their home life from their university life, and those seeking a safe, friendly community.

# Notting Hill

# Why Notting Hill?

Notting Hill is a quiet, residential enclave situated immediately north of the university grounds. It is the closest option for Engineering and Science students, allowing them to walk to their specific faculties in 5-10 minutes, bypassing the busy central campus traffic entirely.

# Accommodation Options

The area is dominated by rental accommodation specifically built for students, including large townhouse complexes and studio apartments. It is quieter and less commercial than the other suburbs on this list.

# Cost

Rent Range: A$200-350 per week

Because it lacks a train station and a major high street, rents can be slightly lower or on par with Clayton. It offers good value for students who simply need a quiet place to sleep and study.

# Lifestyle

Notting Hill is peaceful and slightly industrial in parts. It lacks the bustling nightlife of Glen Waverley or the markets of Oakleigh. However, it is home to the Notting Hill Hotel (known as ""The Nott""), a historic pub that serves as a major social anchor for Monash students, particularly on Tuesday nights. Shopping usually requires a trip to nearby Brandon Park or Clayton.

# Ideal For

Postgraduate students, Engineering/Science students wanting a short walk to labs, and those who prefer a quiet environment free from distractions.

# Conclusion

Deciding where to live near Monash University Clayton involves weighing convenience against lifestyle. For pure proximity, Clayton and Notting Hill are unmatched. For a premium lifestyle with great food, Glen Waverley and Carnegie stand out. For a cultural village feel with great transport, Oakleigh is the top contender. By understanding the unique character of these suburbs, international students can find a home that supports both their academic goals and their personal well-being in Melbourne.",1,1769942525.0,OnlyGoodContent,0,1.0,False

The Verdict: That pink camo absolutely pops in the sunlight. It’s the perfect ""loud"" piece for summer festivals or beach days.

In social situations where I don't know people that well I find I am either listening, pretending that I am listening or thinking about how I can respond. In aim of being liked and making new friendships. When I do respond I feel awkward or abrupt in my response. I feel I am sooooo slow compared to most people in conversations or too fast when someone gives me the limelight. I will never take centre stage, I wait to be invited. 

I feel this especially around quick-witted people, almost an envy at how they lightly banter and respond humourously and confidently, but recently I have noticed this feeling around normal, surface level people and conversations. I havent grabbed the art of small talk or light banter. I dont know how to talk on the surface and yet I come alive in deep and meaningful conversations. 

How do people listen, know what to say and deliver what they want to say with light humour and ease?

---
Example: 

Yesterday I met a group of strangers for a coffee in my local area. With 2 girls, we realise we are politically aligned we speak the same language about life including what we care about, spirituality, art and then that we even love the same mints. One of the girls goes to cheers mint tins with me as a joke and I realise I've left her hanging for a few seconds too long before I cheers back. Bleurgh.

I notice my dopamine rising in my body at the chance of meeting a new friend, while also overplaying the awkward tin cheers in the back of my head... like ""I've already messed this up""

Later she asks if I have seen a film that we would both care about. Without even thinking I say ""yeah loved it""... Even though I haven't seen it ugh..  what??? Why did I do that. Then I try to make conversation about the film that is obviously just waffle, i havent seen it. I realise I can't take it back and replay that sitch over in my head.

I feel her lose interest in me, when I feel this with people I then do more to try win attention back. Then the conversation stops flowing and I feel myself retreat to my shell and stop trying. 
_____

I think this sitch is repeated and not sure if its just generally as a society that people have shorter attention spans. I'm highly empathetic and aware of energy and feel the slightest shift as a major blow.

I really just wanna connect with people but dont think I've figured out how to on the surface. Any tips from people who have suffered the same are greatly appreciated!",1,1769942239.0,socialskills,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

This feels a bit awkward to post, but here goes.

I’m a 29y, F, based in Lahore and was wondering if any girls here would be interested in a casual coffee meetup — nothing fancy, just a relaxed chat about life, girl stuff, work, relationships, or whatever comes up.

Most of my close friends have moved abroad, so it’s mostly just me here now, and it can feel a little lonely at times. I’m married, so it might be easier to connect with someone in a similar phase of life, but honestly I’m open — anyone kind, normal, and respectful is welcome.

I’m at a stage where I’m less interested in sparks that burn fast and more drawn to something steady, curious, and real. The kind of connection that feels calm but alive  like walking through the city late at night, not rushing anywhere, just talking.
I value emotional intelligence, consistency, and effort that doesn’t need to be announced. I’m attracted to people who are self-aware, grounded, and know how to hold space  for conversations, for silence, for another human being.
I’m into fitness and taking care of my body, but I’m just as focused on growth, healing, and building a life that feels aligned. I like routines, coffee walks, quiet mornings, and conversations that drift from light teasing into something deeper without forcing it.
I don’t need perfection. I care more about honesty, communication, and someone who knows what they want or at least isn’t afraid to explore it intentionally. I believe chemistry matters, but so does emotional safety. I want something that can grow, not something that keeps me guessing.

If you’re someone who enjoys depth, believes timing matters, and understands that real connection is built  not chased we might recognize something familiar in each other.

1qsv4h2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qsv4h2,The stereotypical image of the pyramids and Cairo is propaganda.,"Hello, I'm Egyptian. I just finished watching this YouTube video by a YouTuber named Connor from USA who has about a million followers. He made a video titled ""Scamming the Pyramids Scammers,"" but the video is completely different from the title. Connor's trip to Cairo started with him searching for his Airbnb. He met several people who welcomed him and treated him very nicely, but despite admitting this, he kept making fun of the country. Then in the morning, he ordered an Uber, and it's well known, even among us Egyptians, that Uber drivers aren't the best and might ask for extra money in general. But he kept promoting the idea that the Uber driver asked him for extra money because he was a tourist. Then he changed his name to Mohamed, but nothing changed. So this proves that this isn't a scam specifically against him, and it also proves that Connor thinks Egypt is Iran, that he treats us in such a ridiculous way. Do you understand what I mean? That person who calls Muslims muzelms.

then A random driver approached him on the street, offered him a ride, and actually drove him without any scams; he was a very nice person. However, Connor continued to treat him unkindly and unseriously, showing no respect to the driver.

His tour of the pyramids began with him entering through the new pyramid gate, which was clean, with clearly displayed prices (He complained that Egyptians have lower prices while tourists don't; he doesn't want to pay $14 to enter the pyramids, lol), restrooms, and free electric buses to transport visitors within the sites. He was then approached by several vendors who mostly offered him camel and horse rides. When he declined, they simply left him alone and were even respectful, greeting him warmly and welcoming him to Egypt. No one chased after him or bothered him; he himself admitted this.

Connor deliberately attempted to bribe an Egyptian police officer! To get him into trouble and gain views, but the officer was actually kind to him and showed him a good spot to take a picture. and refused to take any money from him and asked him not to film him, but Connor, with no regard for privacy, filmed him anyway. Although any reasonable person would call the money the officer refused a tip, Connor calls it a ""bribe."" I don't know if a tip only becomes a bribe within the context of the pyramids?

Connor repeatedly mocked the country and spoke sarcastically to locals, like telling the coffee vendor near the pyramids who asked him if he would upload the video to YouTube that he would become as famous as Mia Khalifa!

I just want you to understand that these videos that tarnish the image of Egypt and Egyptians on YouTube are propaganda. Imagine this YouTuber coming to Egypt, entering the pyramids, deliberately going to street vendors, cutting out all the good moments with the vendors, highlighting only one instance of a vendor trying to scam him, and then calling it Egypt. Do you think this is an honest YouTuber? I think this is sacm. I've seen tourists in Korea being physically threatened by scammers when they're photographed, and tourists in Europe—""First World"" countries like France and the UK—being harassed by scammers in public streets to collect fake donations, or even robbed on the subway! You'd never see any of this in Cairo or Egypt. Yet we are called ""Capital of scammers"".

I whatched another video of a woman whose trip to Egypt was wonderful, but she used a misleading title and thumbnail. The same thing happens with tourists from Latin America who put pictures of niqabs or Ai garbage in thumbnails. These are all forms of racism against us.

All respectful tourists are welcome in our country, but if you come here to mock us, we would prefer that you stay in your own country; that's better for both of us.",29,1769942044.0,ancientegypt,16,0.69,False
