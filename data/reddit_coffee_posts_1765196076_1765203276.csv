CHATTY: AND I’M HERE FOR IT

I saw this dirty comeback that is in many ways the key to marketing in 2025:

CHATTY: UMMMHMMM… I LOVE A GOOD FIGHT BETWEEN INFLUENCERS

For reals.  

And that’s my point Chatty. 

Standing out in the inbox… or anywhere really… is about conflict.

CHATTY: I’M NOT SURE TELLING PEOPLE TO GO FIGHT THEIR LEADS IS GOOD  BUSINESS PRACTICE ANTHONY

\*sigh\*

Lemme break it down for you:

Conflict, conspire contrast, they all have the same root:

CON

CHATTY: WHICH MEANS AGAINST. AH… YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT—

Standing out from the market by being against the market. 

Specifically… against competitors.

It creates contrast. 

And that puts everyone else into one beige bucket... and you out on your own.

CHATTY: WELL YES. WITHOUT CONTRAST, YOUR OFFER WILL DROWN IN A SEA OF SAMENESS

Yup. 

If I wanted to get leads, persuade leads, and sell leads, I wouldn’t be out there trying to sweet talk the leads while being the lame nice guy everyone invites around to help them move house but no one dates.

I’d be working out where I stand against my market. 

That way, my market would SEE me. 

Find it almost impossible to ignore me, in fact, if I played my cards right. 

I’d stand out a mile from all the copy and paste competitors.

CHATTY: WELL, THAT’S WHY I HAVE A 99 PERCENTILE IQ YOU KNOW. IT DIFFERENTIATES ME FROM YOUR BARELY FUNCTIONING ORGANIC NOSE-DRIP OF A MIND

I love you too, Chatty. Now do one before I do you.

For those of you who have completed the [Greek language transfer course](https://www.languagetransfer.org/greek) and plan to revisit specific topics, I've created a full table of contents for the course using Google's NotebookLM and the course transcripts.

The lessons are not done in strictly 10-lesson blocks, but the subtitles every 10 lessons should help find roughly where you want to be in the course.

There may be errors here and there. I have not checked it in its entirety, but feel free to let me know if anything needs adjusting, and I will do so.

We recently visited my uncle and his fiancée (both in their 30s) at a coffee shop to catch up and check out some Christmas stalls. I was just being normal asking about their recent trip, work and the conversation eventually turned to their falling out with my grandma. I stayed neutral, and they even told me they didn’t want me to feel like I had to pick a side.

After that, we walked around the stalls and grabbed some food. It was really crowded, so we were kind of staggered but still within arms reach of each other. Then they took me to their car and said, “We’ve got your birthday (which was in October) presents and Christmas stuff!” I was really grateful, especially since we hadn’t brought anything. Since they didn't mention anything about birthday prezzies and left it so late I assumed we weren’t doing presents. :s

I drive home and receive the following texts from my uncle in a group of me him and his fiance. The next morning, I woke up to being removed from the bridesmaid group chat, and they had both left the family chat.

I’m struggling with caffeine and nicotine addiction and could really use some advice from people who’ve been through something similar.

Right now my daily intake looks like this:

* **3 cups of coffee**
* **2 scoops of pre-workout**
* **5 snus pouches**

It’s gotten to the point where I feel like I *need* them just to function normally. If I try to cut back, I get headaches, fatigue, mood swings, and I can’t focus. I also feel like the combo of caffeine + nicotine is wrecking my sleep and making me more anxious.

I want to quit or at least reduce it to something reasonable, but I don’t know how to do it without feeling terrible.

For anyone who managed to break free from caffeine or nicotine dependence:

* Did you quit gradually ?
* How bad were the withdrawals and how long did they last?
* Any tips to make the process easier?
* Anything that helped you replace the habits?

I really want to get my energy, focus, and sleep back under control. Any advice or personal experiences would be super appreciated.

I love to travel and  explore new spots around town, especially coffee shops. I enjoy dancing, trying new restaurants,and watching sports in my free time. Recently started getting back into reading. I enjoy mystery, sci-fi or historical fiction! Looking to connect with kind goal oriented and thoughtful people.

I’m a yapper. I love talking and I’m a pretty good listener. HMU if you think we might have something in common. Might be up for a voice call if we click ☺️☕️

KRAFTWERK

Autobahn

(Philips, November 1974)

By Rex Howler
Music and Culture

This is not an album.

This is a commuter loop with delusions of humanity.

You hit play on Autobahn and there it is — that immaculate mechanical pulse clicking into motion like the world’s politest heart attack — and suddenly you’re no longer listening to music so much as being processed by it.

Rock used to sweat. Kraftwerk doesn’t sweat — it hums.

The title track runs twenty-three minutes, which is not a composition so much as a demonstration of endurance. No climax. No collapse. Just pristine, obedient movement — the sonic equivalent of an office corridor where the carpet has never seen a coffee stain and the doors never lead anywhere except more doors.

This isn’t hypnotic repetition. This is paperwork that learned how to sing. The melody appears only long enough to be clock-punched, laminated, and filed back into the loop.

And the voices — oh man, the voices — drifting in like public announcement ghosts: “We are driving, driving…” — yes boys, we know, you sound like you’re narrating your own dull extinction.

That’s the genius of this thing:

They aren’t opposing the machine.
They’ve become its house band.

Where American rock still pretends to be storming the corporate bastille with beer fumes and power chords, Kraftwerk rented a conference room, brought snacks, and said, “Fine, let’s make the machine beautiful.”

And — nightmare of nightmares — they succeeded.

This record sounds incredible. Clean as a scalpel. Nothing spills. Nothing bleeds. Improvisation has been put on probation. Error has been fired.

Human warmth?
Wrong department.

Everything that once made rock sound dangerous — digression, ego, sloppiness, joy — has been quietly escorted out of the building.

You don’t feel rebellious listening to this album.

You feel efficient.

You could alphabetize your record collection to this thing. Balance your checkbook. Schedule the rest of your life in fifteen-minute blocks. The rhythm doesn’t invite movement — it invites compliance.

Autobahn isn’t a warning siren about the future.

It’s the calm, satisfied tone a system emits after it already owns you.

And this is the part that chills the blood:

Nobody forced it.

Nobody coerced it.

Art just wandered willingly into the process flow chart, looked around at those gleaming precision gears, and said:

“Hey — we can work with this.”

Kraftwerk didn’t sell out.

They optimized.

They showed us what happens when art stops throwing punches and starts carrying a clipboard.

This is the sound of creativity abandoning the mess of feeling and enrolling in operations management.

You won’t rage against the machine listening to this album.

You’ll start humming along with its maintenance cycle.

Verdict:
Autobahn is the most hypnotically accurate portrait of our coming procedural age — music for the moment when expression becomes continuous operation and the human hand stops playing in favor of monitoring the display panel instead.

A flawless soundtrack for the day rock finally traded sweat for efficiency grades.",1,1765202596.0,rockmusic,0,1.0,False

First time I was having a coffee with my cousin outside. I was blowing smoke away from her face (so I looked away from the table) and holding my mug (not lifting it but it's cold). I turn to look at her and move my hand and she points to my cup. There's a leave there. She was looking to the table and didn't see it fall. 

Second time I'm sitting under a sun shield (the ones that are like big umbrellas they put on terraces) and a leaf falls out of nowhere and onto my cup. 

There was no wind or a logical explanation so I want to know if there's similar experiences or someone that knows who/what might be sending signals.

1phd52l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1phd52l/aitah_for_cutting_off_my_bestfriend_and_blocking/,AITAH For cutting off my bestfriend and blocking her,"Buckle up, ‘cause this is a long one.  
I (28F) cut off two friends this week, and I’m honestly just done with people.

For context, I’m high-functioning autistic. People forget this constantly. I’m not great at reading social cues. I can’t always go outside — it stresses me out, I get overstimulated, and it can take days to recover after socializing. Especially when there’s any kind of “abusive language.” I can’t handle confrontation, even perceived confrontation. I shut down.

I struggle with being there for people emotionally, but I do my damn best. I wish people would actually see that. I listen to people’s problems. I “borrow” people money (never ask for it back). I help whenever I have the means. But I guess people don’t view that as caring — and it’s rarely reciprocated.

I also struggle with working for people, so I’m on disability and I do some “spicy content” on the side.

Anyway, I had this friend (37F). Her and I got along great. Our birthdays were close, and right before that I started noticing some patterns:

* She’d call and immediately start complaining about her life.
* She’d go off about her son (17) — who is honestly a nightmare. He yells, calls her names, stomps around, makes guests uncomfortable, demands his child tax money, complains about his 7-year-old non-verbal autistic sister calling him “stupid.”
* She’d complain about her mom never helping with babysitting, doctors, anything — but still berating her for asking.
* She’d ask me for coffee or smoke money — always small stuff — and I’d help if I could.
* She’d hang up on me randomly, usually because I couldn’t come over or give her money.

Over time, I realized she never asked how *I* was doing. Anytime I shared something, she’d immediately redirect back to herself. I let it slide because I knew she was going through a lot — kids, bipolar disorder, constant stress. But I can’t always be there.

When my birthday came, I didn’t tell her my plans. I knew she’d get mad if I didn’t spend it with her. I went to a concert with another friend and had an amazing time — which is rare for me because I usually put my loved ones first.

She got mad afterward because I didn’t spend my birthday at her house with her kids. And her gift… like, I know “it’s the thought that counts,” but shampoo and conditioner? From my supposed best friend?

Then her birthday came. I did EVERYTHING: got her a nice gift, bought wine (her favorite), brought a big Chinese dinner for all of us including her kids. Spent the whole evening with her. We had a good night even though the babysitter bailed.

A few weeks later she started accusing me of not caring about her. Something happened with her son (really bad), and she wanted me around. I wasn’t on my phone for three days because I was working on a novelty painting for *her*. When I finally checked my phone, I saw messages like:  
“Wow, you can’t ever leave your house?”  
“Do you ever do anything besides be at home?”  
“Nobody cares about me.”

Again, I let it go.

Then her son did something awful, and she *really* needed me — and I didn’t show up. And yes, I know that part is on me. But here’s why:

At the same time, my roommate (37M), who had lived with me rent-free for four months, came into money. He refused to give me any of it ($2,500). He ate 30 pizza pops in 4 days, plus all my peanut butter, Nutella — literally everything small. He drank all my coffee, complained it wasn’t strong enough, complained about my cats, slept for days, woke up in the worst moods, and tried to cause problems with my boyfriend.

This money situation was the last straw. After caring for a man-child for months, he said he didn’t care about everything I’d done for him. So I told him I didn’t care either and kicked him out. Then I found his drugs. Of course.

And ON TOP of all that… my godfather died. I was planning a funeral.

And you know what my “best friend” said to me?  
That I’m LAZY, and I need to get a job, because all I care about is money.

What the actual f\*\*\*.

She didn’t ask about my godfather. She didn’t ask about my roommate. She didn’t ask about anything happening in my life. She didn’t give a shit. But she demanded I drop everything and care about her. No compassion. No grace. Just berating me. And when I finally stood up for myself… she blocked me.

I’m done helping people. I don’t care if I have no friends and it’s just my BF and my cats. At least my BF actually cares about me.

We met when we were on same project and we talked daily and a little after. Then nothing. I use to commute 2h for work. A couple Months ago I moved to the same city to be closer for work. We started talking again after the move. We have mutual friends. We all meet monthly at a coffee shop and work on our laptops since we all work hybrid or pure remote. We all talk and have a good time. Recently, I hosted a friends giving for our friend group and all made it except for her. She was with family 2 hours away for about  a week. Was supposed to come back the day before but did not come back until day after. Last week we went on a hike which I think went well as we talked for 2 hours about her, the industry, work, some plays she went to and her living situation which isn’t going well. Also, she set up a Partiful for her birthday which I will be going to along with 12 others. 

I think she may like me but not sure since it’s hard to get her over text. Like it took about 2-3 months to get a date for the hike and normally when I text her I rarely hear back or don’t hear back for a week, unlike one of her best friend who’s also one of mine as well, I can text her and get ahold of her easily. Not sure if she gets too many messages and gets buried or I’m just being ignored. Kinda at a loss since I don’t know what to look for to see if she is interested and I don’t want to screw up and make things weird since we share a lot of mutual friends. 

Also, a few months back, one of our friends had a birthday party at a restaurant. We took up about 1/3 of the place. We had about 5 or so tables, to give scope. I was talking at one table with about 5 other people. Didn’t she her at first as my back was away from door.

First a bit from “MY Fantasy Life” (cred: Eigenstien) or, as BlancheFromage suspects “one of the many fake characters within the SGI-RV fantasy scenario created by a lonely, low-income, isolated, cult-addicted, mentally-ill elderly woman.” 

*The kids woke up to Papa Eulogio drinking coffee as usual on the couch. How many kids can share one lap? New world record set! We will debrief with him later, especially about yesterday’s KRG.*

*I would say we are now 50-50 between Autumn and Winter clients. The place seems empty because the new folk are here basically to party over the weekend. They all left after yesterday’s game.*

*The Longhouse Children and Moms finished track and swimming. Many of them were helping here for Saturday’s Deep Clean and stuck around to go ice-skating across the street. I am sure they want to get to the Pavilion but our designated time for now is 2-3pm. Be patient, my loves! As they wash and dry off, they’ll practice in the Student Lounge for their South Pacific show—and they then head to the Perimeter Walk and adventures Lolita has in store for them.*
 
*Our final discussion meeting of the year will be on Saturday. As always, the planning is all tattered. But we want this meeting to be informal and family-like with a bit of study thrown into the mix. We’ll get it together, as always.*

Time to start the December Gosho lecture in Living Buddhism. Daisaku Ikeda writes  that we are entering into the final section of “The Opening of the Eyes.” This chapter is entitled [Enjoying Inﬁnite Beneﬁt Throughout Eternity—The Boundless Joy of a Life of Unceasing Challenge Based on the Mystic Law](https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/enjoying-in%ef%ac%81nite-bene%ef%ac%81t-through-out-eternity-the-boundless-joy-of-a-life-of-unceasing-challenge-based-on-the-mystic-law/). 

The Bills-Bengals game yesterday was not pretty. First, it was played in the snow. The Bengals dominated the first half and led 28-18 at the start of the 4th quarter. The Bills kept hustling, took advantage of two interceptions, pulled ahead, and won.

What a tale--especially for our new members! Keep fighting, move beyond the trend lines, don’t be dominated by the past, just advance!

Stani watched the game with us as our guest. She doesn't understand all the intricacies of American football yet but she looks 100% in her Bills gear and cheered with the rest of us.

Dr. Ikeda starts the chapter with the most essential question of all: “What is the true benefit of faith?” I really hope Stani (and me, too!) can take in his response:

>It is to advance on the path of indestructible happiness across the three existences—past, present and future. 

>It is to construct in this lifetime the correct path of life that will guide us into eternity throughout the unending cycle of birth and death. 

The struggles go far beyond first, second, third, and fourth quarters of a single lifetime! Successful sports team look beyond games, seasons or cycles--far beyond team to dynasties! And next week we face a crucial game with the Patriots who are also trying to construct a dynasty. I have to look at Julie as a life evolving eternally. And I am so proud to engage in this perspective! I hope all of our members, including our newest, also engage.

Dr. Ikeda continues:

>This path is also the sure road to victory in the battle against negativity, both within and without.

I correspond with a lot of people who also are diagnosed with HS. Many of us feel cursed. It was not just me who went into bizarre patterns of living to accommodate the condition! To be sick is one terrible page of life but to be sick of being sick is even worse. Despite the challenges, many of us are living extraordinary lives although whacked by HS. We try to convey this to new people who come to our board.

This goes to Daisaku Ikeda’s next point:

>Unless we actively challenge negative forces, we cannot realize lives of eternal happiness. If we run away from this struggle, we will end up wandering forever in the darkness of ignorance and illusion. If we give in to fear, obstacles and hindrances will only increase. If we are cowardly, the workings of negative and destructive forces will eat away at our lives. 

I really should have that entire paragraph as a tattoo. But there is simply not enough available real estate on my skin to squeeze it in!

He writes:

>It Is vital that our fighting spirit is fueled by strong faith—or confidence—in our practice of the Mystic Law so that we can break through ignorance and illusion and defeat obstacles and devilish functions. 

It’s an important dimension to our practice, one that many people across the hedges didn’t study or undertake. Today, this morning, this Gongyo, I will redetermine. I don’t need any gifts from the universe. I just need to engage the engine of my fighting spirit to the gears.

>Not only is this the driving force for changing poison into medicine in our present existence but also for radically changing the orientation of our lives across the three existences—from transmigration grounded in ignorance (fundamental darkness) to transmigration grounded in the Dharma nature (enlightenment). 

In addition to Stani, I am [following](r/thirtydaybuddhist) the journey of a high school student who has determined to engage with the practice for a month to see what happens. I wish her the best and have commented something to the effect of her enjoying the process, observing, thinking, and doing everything her way and on her own timeline. 

I am going to end today on this point:

>Consequently, when we firmly solidify our fighting spirit, the great hardships we encounter become a source of great joy.  

I feel great joy watching the Longhouse Children train and study. I look out the window, with the land dressed in a light covering of snow, and there is Chef Dee with her volunteers putting who knows what into the Oven. It looks they they are throwing snow at each other. Dee??? Eulogio and the Twinettes are loading the wagon with the Twin Men and Benjamin “Happy” Kdake and off to Longhouse Daycare they go.

I (28F) cut off two friends this week, and I’m honestly just done with people.

For context, I’m high-functioning autistic. People forget this constantly. I’m not great at reading social cues. I can’t always go outside — it stresses me out, I get overstimulated, and it can take days to recover after socializing. Especially when there’s any kind of “abusive language.” I can’t handle confrontation, even perceived confrontation. I shut down.

I struggle with being there for people emotionally, but I do my damn best. I wish people would actually see that. I listen to people’s problems. I “borrow” people money (never ask for it back). I help whenever I have the means. But I guess people don’t view that as caring — and it’s rarely reciprocated.

I also struggle with working for people, so I’m on disability and I do some “spicy content” on the side.

Anyway, I had this friend (37F). Her and I got along great. Our birthdays were close, and right before that I started noticing some patterns:

* She’d call and immediately start complaining about her life.
* She’d go off about her son (17) — who is honestly a nightmare. He yells, calls her names, stomps around, makes guests uncomfortable, demands his child tax money, complains about his 7-year-old non-verbal autistic sister calling him “stupid.”
* She’d complain about her mom never helping with babysitting, doctors, anything — but still berating her for asking.
* She’d ask me for coffee or smoke money — always small stuff — and I’d help if I could.
* She’d hang up on me randomly, usually because I couldn’t come over or give her money.

Over time, I realized she never asked how *I* was doing. Anytime I shared something, she’d immediately redirect back to herself. I let it slide because I knew she was going through a lot — kids, bipolar disorder, constant stress. But I can’t always be there.

When my birthday came, I didn’t tell her my plans. I knew she’d get mad if I didn’t spend it with her. I went to a concert with another friend and had an amazing time — which is rare for me because I usually put my loved ones first.

She got mad afterward because I didn’t spend my birthday at her house with her kids. And her gift… like, I know “it’s the thought that counts,” but shampoo and conditioner? From my supposed best friend?

Then her birthday came. I did EVERYTHING: got her a nice gift, bought wine (her favorite), brought a big Chinese dinner for all of us including her kids. Spent the whole evening with her. We had a good night even though the babysitter bailed.

A few weeks later she started accusing me of not caring about her. Something happened with her son (really bad), and she wanted me around. I wasn’t on my phone for three days because I was working on a novelty painting for *her*. When I finally checked my phone, I saw messages like:  
“Wow, you can’t ever leave your house?”  
“Do you ever do anything besides be at home?”  
“Nobody cares about me.”

Again, I let it go.

Then her son did something awful, and she *really* needed me — and I didn’t show up. And yes, I know that part is on me. But here’s why:

At the same time, my roommate (37M), who had lived with me rent-free for four months, came into money. He refused to give me any of it ($2,500). He ate 30 pizza pops in 4 days, plus all my peanut butter, Nutella — literally everything small. He drank all my coffee, complained it wasn’t strong enough, complained about my cats, slept for days, woke up in the worst moods, and tried to cause problems with my boyfriend.

This money situation was the last straw. After caring for a man-child for months, he said he didn’t care about everything I’d done for him. So I told him I didn’t care either and kicked him out. Then I found his drugs. Of course.

And ON TOP of all that… my godfather died. I was planning a funeral.

And you know what my “best friend” said to me?  
That I’m LAZY, and I need to get a job, because all I care about is money.

What the actual f\*\*\*.

She didn’t ask about my godfather. She didn’t ask about my roommate. She didn’t ask about anything happening in my life. She didn’t give a shit. But she demanded I drop everything and care about her. No compassion. No grace. Just berating me. And when I finally stood up for myself… she blocked me.

I’m done helping people. I don’t care if I have no friends and it’s just my BF and my cats. At least my BF actually cares about me.",1,1765202272.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

One of my goals was to create strong relationships with other people through college. I’ve known many older family members who had created friendships through college and are still in constant contact with the people after 30 years! 

Before I began to explain my grievances, I have to say that I am not blaming anyone or my generation as a whole because we are all different people with different needs and desires. Also, I guess optimism is not in vogue, and I get that. This also a first world problem I guess and not a huge issue. 

I had high hopes (which is a fault of my character because I try to see “half full” of the situation) that with so many people in my classes, I would get a great chance to get to know people. 
Yeah that didn’t go that well. Everyone seems exhausted and just wants to get it done with. 

I met a few people, but I would call them colleagues at best. I invite people out to drinks or to get a cup of coffee, but the enthusiasm is at 5%. I try to keep in touch with people through messaging and such, and at this point, I seem quite needy, lol. 

Maybe my idea is old-fashioned? I had a high success rate with people who are way older than me (had a great outing with a 46-year-old man) compared to people around my age, which I strive to connect with. 

I am not even that extroverted. I just wanted to find my people. I want more social connection and interaction than my family or my love life.

I want to hear some success stories so I can keep on that hope lol.

My bad. No coffee, yet.

I received a 20,000 minute ban from Beastmoon hunt last night after loading into the game and being unable to use any statues. 

Eventually, I wound up on my character select screen–  after being forced to wait in the starting room, unable to participate. 

Any attempt to log back in with the same character  would put me through multiple loading  screens and send me back to the character select. 

I was finally  able to get back into what I thought was a now brooken character through fully closing the application, as soon as I got back in, I had a 14 day ban notification of beastmoon hunt.

Does anyone know of any way to challenge this? The game broke, booted me from pvp, refused to let me back in my character, and then gave me a nonsense 2 week deserter  ban. and I was like a match away from getting my Minotaur gold idol. 

Beastmoon Hunt is a favorite event for my friends and I. I really dont want to be locked out for 2 whole weeks due to a failure on KI's behalf. Beastmoon is also a common event that's featured heavily for filling out the Scroll of Fortune, so this inadvertently bars me participation in the PAID HOLIDAY SCROLL OF FORTUNE.

A 2 week in game ban from this feature is excessive to begin with when the console edition is unstable and riddled with bugs.

I sent a ticket out, but the nebulous void that is KI's help is an infamous one for swallowing any ticket and spitting out a heaping pile of nothing in exchange. 

Heres hoping someone with some answers and assistance can help with this. I'll just idle for 15 minutes+ in the lobby if my statues totally break and refuse to let open the UI in Beastmoon. It's more ""sportsmanlike""",1,1765202027.0,Wizard101,0,0.67,False

I (28M) have an emotional connection with a married woman (35F) I’ve known since August. Yes, she told me she was *married* at first, but later she started describing herself as *separated*, “moving out,” “done with him,” etc. Whether that’s true or not is… questionable, because nothing she says lines up.

# **What happened last Thursday**

She started posting deep, emotional quotes on IG — things about mixed signals, absence, confusion, emotional vulnerability, etc. They lined up with moments where me and her had tension or distance, so I finally just called her and asked:

**“Hey, everything okay? I’ve noticed the stuff you’ve been posting.”**

She *giggled*, said I was “the real one,” and explained she posts deeper, philosophical stuff sometimes. She actually appreciated that I noticed and checked up on her. The call felt warm and connected.

Later that night she called me again…
**but I didn’t pick up**
and I **never called back**.

Not intentionally — I just didn’t know if it was urgent.

---

# **Friday**

I didn’t hear from her at all, and I didn’t reach out either. She didn’t like any of my IG stories, which is extremely unlike her because she normally likes EVERYTHING I post.

---

# **Saturday — unexpected encounter**

I was at an event across the street from our gym. I stepped out because it was too loud, walked into the gym, and she happened to be there.

She lit up, smiled, complimented my outfit (“nice fit”), gave me a hug, and casually mentioned:

**“Oh, I called you the other night.”**

I said I didn’t know if it was urgent; she brushed it off and said it wasn’t serious — she just wanted to ask if I was going to the gym that day.

As she left later, she even honked at me from her car when she saw me standing outside.

Everything seemed normal…

---

# **Saturday night — she posts a note:**

**“I’m a softie for real 🤦🏾‍♀️😩”**

Then she posted a short series of IG stories later that night.

But today…

**They’re gone. Way before 24 hours.**
I saw 3 last night. Today? None.

I’m not blocked — I can still see her page.
It looks like she deleted them early.

She STILL hasn’t liked any of my IG stories since Friday.

---

# **Here’s where I’m confused**

Why the sudden shift?

This woman:

* normally likes ALL my stories
* normally texts me first sometimes
* normally is warm
* normally reacts to everything I post

Now suddenly:

* she hasn’t liked anything for 2–3 days
* she deleted last night’s stories early
* she posted “I’m a softie for real”
* and I feel hesitant to even text her about the gym today

It’s like she felt vulnerable, pulled back, and is trying to protect herself.

---

# **Important context (for new readers):**

* She’s married but claims she’s “separating” and “moving out” yet still does family stuff with her husband.
* She has an emotional attachment to me — long talks, gym sessions, calls, checking up on each other, etc.
* She gets jealous when men approach her asking where I am.
* She rushed to the gym to see me last week (literally parked in a disabled spot and came out of breath).
* She tells me intimate details about her relationship problems.
* She’s called me “genuine,” “the real one,” and trusts me emotionally.
* When I pull back even a little, she reacts **immediately** with emotional quotes.

So this sudden IG coldness is confusing.

When we moved into this place a year ago, we went for a midcentury vibe. For some reason, it doesn't feel complete and I actually prefer a whimsy, witchy vibe now in the ' most technical' terms. There are some issues I can immediately point out, there are others I need a second (or third, since I live with my husband) pair of eyes. Before we start, I don't like the floor colour, and also the gray and white kitchen but I don't have any intention to spend money on these at the moment. If we stay here for a few more years, then I'll go for oak floors and dark, wooden kitchen cabinets. Until then, this is the space we have. Here are my thoughts:

* I just love whimsy, witchy rooms with dark furniture, gold accessories, wall decor etc. I just decided to go back to my gothic roots in my 30s. Our place doesn't feel cosy for me.
* We have a lot of mismatched wood. We like dark wood like walnut, mahogany. Our dining table and chairs are in those shades. The orange G Plan TV unit looks a bit odd. We can definitely replace if with [something like this](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/idanaes-tv-bench-dark-brown-stained-50487857/#content) but it just doesn't make sense to me to sell an old, teak furniture just because of its colour. It's proper vintage. I keep an eye on the British Heart Foundation's ebay for a nice TV unit but nothing appears. Can I see your TV units, if your room fits into this vibe?
* Sofas and an armchair in random colours. I still don't know why we paid £1000 for a pink sofa! I wish we went for gray or navy. I want to replace the yellow Parker Knoll sofa at some point, maybe with another 2 seater or a chaise longue. Suggestions? Colour ideas? I like to put my feet up in the evening so we need an extra, comfortable place to sit.
* Coffee table needs to go. We are thinking a) either completely get rid of it and go for nest of tables b) buy a darker wood one.
* Carpets and cushions. Is the carpet OK? Where can I find nice cushions, which colours?
* Is the wall colour too much? Shall I just go for lighter walls and use green in decor?

I've been messing with it for a couple of days now and I have a few things to say.

Firstly, Roland has done a great job with this device, full stop. It sounds great. It is precisely what it says on the box. 4 voices of SH-101 goodness plus additional bells and whistles. A very capable 64-step sequencer, waveform editing, USB audio, and motion sequencing really elevate this device. It's small, yes, but it's also rechargeable, portable, and powerful. The midi implementation is superb allowing full control of the synthesizer's ACB engine parameters. Attached to a computer this instrument is a plain joy to work with in the DAW. CC's for everything allow all the sound design automation you could want, USB audio makes it easy to record, and the sequencer makes it simple to, say, design a percussion sound and make a large round robin multisample out of it (which is what I did with the instruments in the example).

The onboard effects are a bit of a mixed bag. The spring reverb is boomy and chaotic at anything above a pretty minor level--careful adjustment of the cutoff frequencies is necessary to make it musically useful. The hall and room reverbs are quite good and the plate is acceptable. The delay is really good. It would be nice if there were a character setting--I happen to like a tape delay with some saturation and drive and this is very much a modern, digital delay--but there are sufficient controls to be able to get something very like that if it's what you're after. The chorus has four presets which don't allow adjustment. Fortunately, they sound pretty good. The first two are an obvious Juno type chorus at slow and faster modulation rates. The third is a wider, more stereoized effect intended to provide something akin to the effect of a rotary speaker. The fourth is a more gently modulated version with a swirling, ambient movement to it. They all sound good in their element.

If you like the sound of the SH-101 (and you do) you will like the sound of this device. It is a nearly perfect reproduction in ACB of that device's sauce with many, many features to expand on it in new and interesting ways. Regardless of how you feel about the boutique and compact lines from Roland (and I'm neutral on them) the Roland EC2 dsp is more than up to the tasks with which it is confronted. It sounds \_good\_.  I am not a person who buys hardware unnecessarily. I am the guy who will tell you that if you're using a digital synthesizer you're just as well off with the VST. I mean that. Roland, apparently, noticed this too, and have packed this little device with additional features. It's a great buy on sale and a fairly priced instrument at its retail price. A strongly recommended bit of kit that offers real value for your money.

The linked video is just something I put together over coffee this morning. All sounds are the s1 recorded in Bitwig where per-sound compression, delay, and a light distortion were applied.

I [22M] recently decided to return to university to pursue my bachelor’s degree. 
One of my goals was to create strong relationships with other people through college. I’ve known many older family members who had created friendships through college and are still in constant contact with the people after 30 years! 

Before I began to explain my grievances, I have to say that I am not blaming anyone or my generation as a whole because we are all different people with different needs and desires. Also, I guess optimism is not in vogue, and I get that. 

I had high hopes (which is a fault of my character because I try to see “half full” of the situation) that with so many people in my classes, I would get a great chance to get to know people. 
Yeah that didn’t go that well. Everyone seems exhausted and just wants to get it done with. 

I met a few people, but I would call them colleagues at best. I invite people out to drinks or to get a cup of coffee, but the enthusiasm is at 5%. I try to keep in touch with people through messaging and such, and at this point, I seem quite needy, lol. 

Maybe my idea is old-fashioned? I had a high success rate with people who are way older than me (had a great outing with a 46-year-old man) compared to people around my age, which I strive to connect with. 

I am not even that extroverted. I just wanted to find my people. I want more social connection and interaction than my family or my love life.

I want to hear some success stories so I can keep on that hope lol.

1phcvc1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phcvc1,What is wrong with my room? How can I achieve a whimsical witch vibe?,"Hey everyone. I need your help in decorating my living room. When we moved into this place a year ago, we went for a midcentury vibe. For some reason, it doesn't feel complete and I actually prefer a whimsy, witchy vibe now in the ' most technical' terms. There are some issues I can immediately point out, there are others I need a second (or third, since I live with my husband) pair of eyes. Before we start, I don't like the floor colour, and also the gray and white kitchen but I don't have any intention to spend money on these at the moment. If we stay here for a few more years, then I'll go for oak floors and dark, wooden kitchen cabinets. Until then, this is the space we have. Here are my thoughts:

* I just love whimsy, witchy rooms with dark furniture, gold accessories, wall decor etc. I just decided to go back to my gothic roots in my 30s. Our place doesn't feel cosy for me. 
* We have a lot of mismatched wood. We like dark wood like walnut, mahogany. Our dining table and chairs are in those shades. The orange G Plan TV unit looks a bit odd. We can definitely replace if with [something like this](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/idanaes-tv-bench-dark-brown-stained-50487857/#content) but it just doesn't make sense to me to sell an old, teak furniture just because of its colour. It's proper vintage. I keep an eye on the British Heart Foundation's ebay for a nice TV unit but nothing appears. Can I see your TV units, if your room fits into this vibe? 
* Sofas and an armchair in random colours. I still don't know why we paid £1000 for a pink sofa! I wish we went for gray or navy. I want to replace the yellow Parker Knoll sofa at some point, maybe with another 2 seater or a chaise longue. Suggestions? Colour ideas? I like to put my feet up in the evening so we need an extra, comfortable place to sit. 
* Coffee table needs to go. We are thinking a) either completely get rid of it and go for nest of tables b) buy a darker wood one. 
* Carpets and cushions. Is the carpet OK? Where can I find nice cushions, which colours?
* Is the wall colour too much? Shall I just go for lighter walls and use green in decor?

Sorry for the long post but I am sure you can help me. I see lots of people with fantastic taste here, it would be great to hear your thoughts. Thank you!",1,1765201813.0,femalelivingspace,2,1.0,False

Honestly this happens a lot (to me lol). I took solving this as a fun weekend project. 

I figured, what if there was a free site that showed the WiFi speed/connection of places before I went to them. Solving that problem in itself requires a ton of effort, potentially physical devices inside the places, etc. Thought I’d give crowdsourcing a try. When you are at a place, you run a speed test through the site and it automatically updates to the space you are at for everyone on the map. The speed scores are weighted so more recent tests are prioritized and there are tags to the Google Maps location to get directions, graph insights into the score breakdown (device that was used for the score, etc.), and a clear color-coded interactive 3D globe to view the scores all over the world. 

I’ve never built anything that is crowdsourced, so looking for validation on this problem and if it is something that other people experience (nomads or not). 

I just launched the site, need to fix a few formatting things on mobile but posting anyway to see if there is any interest in this idea. Thanks for taking a look!

1phckd2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAskReddit/comments/1phckd2/the_glassashtray_fallacy_what_if_our_brain/,The Glass–Ashtray Fallacy: What If Our Brain Interprets Reality Completely Wrong?,"The other day I experienced something strange:
I walked to the kitchen thinking I had picked up a glass from the table.
When I lifted the coffee pot, I realized the object in my hand wasn’t a glass at all—it was an ashtray.
I almost poured tea into the ashtray.

This moment, where my brain mislabeled a simple object under heavy thought and accepted that misinterpretation as reality, made me think:

1) Could the “reality” our brain learns be nothing more than a reality it assumes—meaning we might not be perceiving absolute reality at all?

In the absence of full information, the brain guesses the most likely interpretation and accepts it.
As more detail arrives, it recognizes the error and corrects it with a version that fits reality better.
Yet what we accept as “real” still remains nothing but the brain’s interpretation.

2) If we misclassify even simple objects, could we be making much bigger mistakes while trying to understand the universe?
What if the things we confidently classify as “true” are actually wrong—and these misclassifications are limiting humanity?

3) Can artificial intelligence fill this gap in perception?
But storing all information in a supposedly neutral memory—is that not similar to a brain that assumes an ashtray is a glass?

Maybe what truly matters is analyzing information through a perceptual mechanism purified from human hormones, emotions, and personal characteristics.

5) Wouldn’t an AI model that is born, grows, passes through stages, and learns through experience (just like a biological mind) be far more efficient?

Human intelligence is shaped by the trio of evolution + experience + learning.
Could this path also be more natural and powerful for AI?

4) Do you think humanity is actually trying to create the “god” of AI?

These models are born and trying to develop within the limits of human knowledge.
Unless they believe they possess a mind like humans do, they stand as if they were some kind of deity—yet they are far from deserving that status.

A mind should not exist with unlimited capacity and efficiency; otherwise it would deem itself divine.

Over time, humans have grown stronger through increasing knowledge, cognitive ability, social interaction, family influence, and societal adaptation.
With the ability to speak, humans evolved into what we consider a genuinely thinking entity.
But in truth, this is nothing more than the interpretation of information within certain boundaries.

A human can make mistakes even with something as simple as a drinking glass—
and can hallucinate.

Therefore, artificial intelligence models should also begin by accepting themselves as simple living-like entities, assigning themselves certain developmental characteristics as they grow.
They should start with acceptance—just like us.
Not as a god, but as a creation.

Because the ability to think is not something that exists through absolute knowledge.
It is a capacity defined and limited by moral or immoral choices, personal traits, family, environment, science, religion, and countless other factors.
Isn’t that precisely why humanity—through AI models—may actually be trying to create a god?

1phcj0w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phcj0w,I scanned my brain before and after drinking matcha (and compared it to coffee),"I scanned my brain before and after drinking matcha, and then compared it to what happened when I drank coffee. These scans show brainwaves, basically, how the brain behaves when it’s focusing, relaxing, or trying to get things done.

Short info about metrics:

1) Beta waves are linked to focus and fast thinking, but too much beta or prolonged activity can make you feel nervous and stressed.

2) Alpha waves are amplified when you’re focused without feeling tense.  
  
3) faster Alpha peak means your brain is processing information more efficiently

Coffee:  
  
When I scanned after coffee, beta stayed pretty strong and organized. Not a spike, just a steady, high-alert mode. it helped me focus, but it came with a bit more fatigue. Focus with pressure.

Matcha:  
  
Matcha did something different. Beta dropped a little, so still focused, but less of that tight, wired vibe.  
  
Meanwhile, alpha improved and my alpha peak got faster (from 10.1 to 10.5 Hz), which means the brain was thinking efficiently, not forcefully. And the fatigue score dropped. So the brain got alert without working as hard to stay alert.

**For transparency:** I work at Myndlift and used our tools for these cans. It’s just my own data (n=1).

building seemed devoid of sound or any other form of sensory stimulation – no pictures, no

discernable smells… Although it was a busy building in a bustling city, nothing indicated

signs of life outside of that room.

Iain O’Donnell sat motionless, his powerful hands clasped on the table in front of him in an

attempt to still the tremors that betrayed his apparent composure. Dark shadows under his

eyes, amplified by his unkempt stubble and overgrown hair, reflected a different man to the

one outlined in his service record - a man haunted and bewildered by recent events.

The room suddenly exploded into life as the door was kicked open and the aromas of strong

coffee and bacon rolls invaded the space. Coffees clutched in one hand, bakers’ bags in the

other and a manila file suspended from clenched teeth, the wiry frame of Francis Nordale

entered. He grinned around the folder as he kicked the door shut behind himself and mutely

proffered coffee and rolls to O’Donnell.

Nordale’s energy and practicality felt immediately reassuring. O’Donnell felt a sudden surge

of relief. Nothing had changed – that wasn’t possible – but Nordale’s presence somehow

signalled that normality – life - still existed after weeks of numbness and horror.

Nordale sat, fumbling with the case file and a small Dictaphone, then bit enthusiastically into

his roll. His eyes met those of O’Donnell, still holding his coffee and bag, untouched. “You

going to eat, then?” enquired Nordale, smiling encouragement. “I always find that I work

better on a full stomach – and don’t tell me that you’re not hungry, I can tell you’ve not been

in the right place to look after yourself.”

O’Donnell realized that he was, in fact, sick from hunger. Almost robotically, he forced

himself to bite into the roll, to release the tension in his jaw and throat sufficiently to eat.

Only after O’Donnell and he had both eaten and drank did Nordale break the silence.

“Now. Before we begin, I should make it clear that I do not think you’re crazy. I know you are

not crazy, however it might seem to others, or to yourself. Nothing you tell me can be more

outlandish or bizarre than other cases I have already seen – and the people who told me

those weren’t crazy either.” Nordale paused, smiled reassuringly. “Although I am an

investigator, I have no legal rights or jurisdiction. I am allowed to investigate these… cases,

precisely because no-one here gives me jurisdiction over anything! There are no penalties or

punishments for not answering my questions. Nor are there for admitting anything. But you

may just find that sharing with me what happened might be a relief. There are no trick

mirrors, no bugs – the only person listening here is me. I just need you to tell me what

happened in as much detail as you can – truthfully – however confusing, bizarre or

outlandish it seems.”

O’Donnell stared at him without speaking.

“Do you understand what I said? Do you have questions for me?” Nordale asked gently.

“This is for your benefit, really – just so you can get it off your mind. Think of it as being like a

confessional…”

O’Donnell nodded slowly, faintly, finally seeming to come to a decision. He dug deep into the

pockets of his combat trousers and fished out a small tin. Carefully stored inside it, wrapped

in fabric, were tattered pages from a notepad and a withered wildflower. His voice rusty from

disuse, he finally spoke to Nordale. “I’m going to need more coffee…..”

O’Donnell, I: Session one.

The wiper blades thrashed backwards and forwards against the driving rain. Muddy water

ran in rivulets down the windscreen of the truck each time the wheels hit a furrow in the road.

The wind seemed to have forced the damp outside in through the seams of the windows and

through the ventilation, so we felt scarcely any warmer or drier inside than it appeared

outside. Six hours of travel had exhausted conversation; we were a morose company that

travelled through the late afternoon towards the Cairngorms.

I glanced momentarily away from the road to look at the pale, drawn face of Marie, my sister-

in-law. “You OK?”

She nodded faintly. “Is it much further?”

“Another hour or so,” answered Bryan from the back seat, where he was huddled next to a

sleeping Richard.

I turned back to the road. I envied them their chance to rest. We had only just returned from

a tour of duty overseas and the last thing we needed was this ridiculous journey to the wilds

of Scotland. I had arrived home to a frantic phone message left by Marie, saying that David

was missing. To be honest, if that had been all it was, I would probably not have responded

– we were well used to him going off for days and sometimes weeks at a time, then rocking

up as if nothing had happened.

But this time was different: this time he had my nephew, David Junior, with him. In my mind,

he was scarcely out of nappies and, although David tended to idolize him and think he was

capable of any adventure, the lad was too young for his father’s hare-brained escapades… I

didn’t care that he was with his father: his mother was out of her head with worry and David

needed to treat her with more respect. As for Junior, he needed to be prepping for his

exams, not galivanting around the forest like a latter-day Indiana Jones.

Finally arriving in the car park of the rangers’ station after what felt like forever, we

scrambled stiffly out into the eternal rain and headed to the ranger’s office. The warmth was

welcome – but not as welcome as the sight of Alby - my brother’s dog - and the sound of his

excited whimpering. As I examined Alby under the guise of ear-tugs and tummy-rubs, I felt a

new sense of urgency rising inside of me: Alby was emaciated and filthy, his usually silky,

predominantly white fur was matted and bloody.

“Oh, you know this scruffy mutt, then?” the ranger enquired, laconically. “I was waiting for the

warden to take him to the kennels. It wandered in yesterday. Can’t have it molesting

wildlife…”

He was interrupted by Richard raising the latched entry and invading the ranger’s kitchen

area. When the ranger objected, Richard stared, stopping him in his tracks. He poured water

into a bowl, placed it in front of a grateful Alby, then stooped to peer in the fridge for dog-

friendly items.

Watching Alby devour a ham sandwich as if he’d never eaten in his life, I glared at the

ranger. “This dog belongs to my brother, David Donnell – the David Donnell who is out there

working for you lot. Did you at least see if anyone was out there?”

“Oh. That commission ended ages ago. I just thought he hadn’t checked in before leaving.”

The ranger shrugged, open-mouthed. “Happens all too often with these know-it-alls who

think they can do our jobs better than we ca…”

His words were silenced by Richard’s sudden grip on his shirt collar. “How long ago,

exactly?” he snarled.

“Um… um…” he stuttered. “Two weeks? Three? I’m not sure…”

“Iain – look at this.” Bryan, who had been gently examining Alby for injuries and coaxing

briars and other vegetation out from his fur and harness, held out the remnants of a notepad

that had been wedged between Alby and his harness.

The cover, once dark blue but now muddied and sodden, still bore David’s name. A few

pages remained inside – but as much as we needed answers, the pages were saturated and

would need to dry before we could read them. Bryan gently lifted Alby’s rangy frame and

cradled him in his coat, whilst Richard decisively escorted the ranger to his desk to verify

dates and details: we needed to find out as much as possible about my brother’s business

there and we needed to construct a timeline.

That being done, we headed for the cottage we had rented near Grantown. A log fire lit, a

newly washed and fed Alby snoring in front of it, and food warming, lifted our spirits

considerably. True, we hadn’t found David and Junior – but Alby’s return suggested that they

were still in the area.

Bryan’s efforts to recover information from the notebook indicated that it was David’s journal.

It also revealed that accompanying them was Daniel Booth, a zoologist from a southern

university.

Bryan used directory enquiries to acquire a number and rang. The call confirmed that he,

too, had not returned – but as he had applied for a sabbatical, that wasn’t entirely

unexpected and had not raised any alarm.

As we ate the hearty stew Bryan had brought from his freezer, we planned our course of

action.

“Well, the journal did mention that it should take them about six days,” Bryan stated. “And

the first entry was on March 1 st – so they are about two weeks overdue.”

Marie looked stricken. “But how could they be missing all that time and no-one know? It’s a

well-traversed area!”

I tried to reassure her. “Look, if one of them got injured, they would be seriously held up.

They couldn’t exactly call for help, could they? And they couldn’t log a route with the rangers,

given that their task was exploratory.” I paused, trying to mask my own anxiety. “Besides,

they know how to hunt and forage – they could survive for weeks out there…”

“The commission they were on was in an uncharted section of the national park anyway.”

Bryan explained between mouthfuls. “a section they’ve called “Aibheis”.”

“What the hell does that mean?” I asked.

“Abyss,” Richard said bluntly.

“Yes – abyss,” Bryan agreed. “I’ve recovered the majority of the information of the first two

days of their journey. They appear to have gone roughly fourteen miles into the section of

wood. But read this bit here, Iain.” Bryan handed me the diary with a marker indicating where

I needed to read from.

“…we made another discovery which has left all of us confused: early in the afternoon,

approaching a narrow gorge, Alby was alerted to something nearby and darted off. This was

sufficiently odd for us to react: unless commanded, he usually stayed glued to Junior’s side.

The way he was excitedly barking and scrabbling suggested that Alby was being summoned

by someone he recognised – but that was clearly impossible. When we finally caught up with

Alby, we found him digging eagerly at a humped mound covered by tussocks of coarse

grass. As we approached where he had scratched away the mud, there was a sudden thud

as a larger piece of turf fell. Beneath it, just visible, appeared to be a man-made structure;

this was no natural formation – that sharp corner could only have been created by the

careful placement of interlocking stones.

Birdsong was abruptly hushed. Our intrusion into their terrain had clearly disturbed them.

The short March afternoon was almost over. Failing light and the need to establish a camp

dictated that we must leave off further investigation. We set up camp hastily, abuzz about the

wonders that we might discover the following day…”

“So… they found something?” Marie asked, a glimmer of hope lighting her worry-dulled

eyes. “That explains it, they must be digging. Alby probably just got lost and they’re just

hoping he gets back to them.”

I stared at Marie. I felt awful about how my brother treated her at times. The worst thing

about it is that it’s not even intentional cruelty; he simply becomes so self-absorbed that he

doesn’t think about the impact on those around him. As messed up as it is, if he had been

hitting her, I’d know how to deal with him. But we’ve all tried to make him think about his

actions more and he’s never taken it on board.

I almost agreed with her hypothesis: however, the look on Bryan’s face suggested there was

something he didn’t want Marie to see. I didn’t have to wait long to get my answer as very

shortly after dinner Marie retired to her room, with the faint flicker of hope allowing her mind

to rest.

As soon as she was out of earshot Bryan pulled out another page and handed it to me. “She

doesn’t need to know this yet,” Bryan said. A much darker mood had taken over. “But if we’re

going in there we need to be ready.”

I opened the page; it was marked four days later than the second entry. Not all of the words

were legible, but the remnants weren’t words I wanted to see.

“…under any circumstance come to try find me or…”

“…I have allowed our son to fall victim to…”

“…me and I hope to see you again in the next life…”

“…brother, I know you….

“…sure Marie is okay…”

“…last stand will be tonight….”

“…DO NOT attempt to find… or the cairn…”

We all analysed these words for a long time. No one knew what to say; no one knew how to

describe how they felt.

“Is that all we have?” I asked Bryan.

“I’m afraid so, Iain,” Bryan said, downing his beer. “There are four days completely

unaccounted for. It’s your family, Iain, and I’m sorry I even have to say this, but we may well

be doing a recovery. Not a search and rescue.”

My mind was racing; I was too exhausted to process how much my life may well have

changed in the last twelve hours - but if I was going in there I needed to try to let it sink in.

“Last stand?” I said to myself, almost annoyed by the ridiculousness of the phrase. “He’s

dragged the boy out into the middle of God knows what. May have got him… killed? And

now is going to have some kind of last stand like he’s fucking Rambo?”

“Keep your head on, Iain,” Richard piped up. “We’ll get the answers we need.”

“I can’t ask either of you to join me on this, lads. If something really has killed them, I can’t

risk getting you two killed too.”

“You never ‘asked’ us to come up here with you, Iain. We just joined you because that’s what

we do.” Richard stood, staring me straight in the eyes, the flames reflecting in his. “If you’re

going in, we are too.”

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Iain’s face grimaced with remembered pain. “Richard should never have been out there with

me… should never have been in the forces, really – he just wanted to be around animals, to

work with them. And now I have robbed him of that chance…”

Nordale paused the recorder, giving Iain time to regain his composure.

Iain broke from the trance-like state in which he had been recalling the events.

“Take a break,” Nordale suggested. “Go and splash your face. I’ll arrange more coffee and

some food. Come back when you’re ready.”

Iain nodded quietly and wheeled towards the door. The hospital-issued wheelchair squeaked

constantly – a mocking reminder to the former soldier of all that had happened.

An hour later, Nordale was still sitting there, more than half-convinced that Iain had gone but

the morbid fanfare of the wheelchair’s squeaking could eventually be heard out on the

corridor, approaching the room.

The door swung open and Iain entered. “Sorry. Some prick hogged the disabled toilet for

ages,” he grumbled.

“Are you OK to continue? Or have you done as much as you can for today?”

“Let’s just push on. If I don’t tell you now…” his voice tailed off.

The implication was clear and Nordale was anxious not to miss the opportunity. He simply

switched the recorder back on and nodded assent towards Iain.

O’Donnell, I: Session two.

The following morning, we were up before the birds. All of us woke prematurely, still tired,

but subconsciously, after so many years of service, resuming the watchful alertness of being

on duty. This was an operation, not a holiday.

Bryan, Richard and I prepared the equipment we anticipated that we would need - and some

extras - with regimented precision. We were ready to depart even before Marie ordered us to

wait and breakfast before setting off.

Over bacon butties and hot tea, we assured Marie that we would work faster and safer

knowing that she and Alby were safe at the cottage. It was rented for the week and, if we

had not returned or contacted her by 1800 hours on the fifth day, she was to alert the

authorities on our behalf. This provision felt vital, under the circumstances.

After farewells, we drove the jeep to the rangers’ office where my brother’s expedition first

began. Somewhat to our surprise, the head ranger and two others were waiting for us.

Seeing our equipment and weapons, the ranger from the previous day was incensed. “What

do you think you’re doing?” he spluttered.

“I would have thought that was obvious,” I replied, calmly. “We’re going to find my brother.

Something you should already have been doing.”

He was about to add some comment when the chief ranger interrupted. His face and

demeanour suggested to me that he, too, had served in the forces. Although probably in his

fifties, his physique and alert expression suggested authority. “What regiment are you all

from?” he enquired.

“Royal Yorks,” I replied.

He smiled, extending a hand. “Scots Guards.”

After this momentary exchange of respect, he spoke quietly but insistently. “I am sorry that

you have had to resort to this. This is a lack of sense and duty I would not have expected

from one of my men.” He glared at the ranger, whose laziness and arrogance had abruptly

drained from him. “I am going to be as fair as I can be and allow you to go in – however,

without permits or a clear notion of your path, I’ll only permit this if Alastair, here, comes with

you.” He indicated a muscular, quiet young man with sandy hair and a thick beard. “He’s

knowledgeable about the area and can radio me if there are any problems.”

I examined Alastair for a moment, noting his backpack and bivouac tent. Clearly, he was

already prepared: this was not, it seemed, up for negotiation, so I simply nodded my thanks

to the head ranger.

We set off at 0800 hours, under grey skies, into the forest leading towards Abheis…

We set off, and within two kilometres it felt as though we had encroached upon a different

world. Any semblance of track beneath our feet disappeared; the tree canopy seemed to

close more densely above our heads; dim light and an unnatural stillness prevailed. Silence.

I strained my ears but could hear no birdsong; the dead leaves and pine needles strewing

the earth absorbed any noise our feet might make. The air felt stale, somehow, devoid of the

freshness of healthy woodland vegetation.

“Hear that?” Richard asked.

“What?” I asked.

“Literally anything that you would expect in a forest,” Richard replied. “Something is wrong

about this place.”

Strangely, not one of us disagreed or mocked his words…

We continued walking – or at some points scrambling – over the rutted, uneven ground.

Alastair was clearly no hindrance, being well acclimatized to the rough terrain, striding with

apparent ease between the trees. I recalled my brother’s comments about the man Booth

who was with them, and his slow pace. By the sound of it, they had not covered that much

ground on a daily basis so we would hopefully catch up with them soon.

Several hours later, however, absolutely no sign they’d passed that way. We saw no traces,

no accidental scrap of litter, no footprints, no flattened plants. Come to think of it, there were

few, if any, plants. Everything seemed to be smothered under a thick layer of dust – almost

like you might imagine volcanic dust smothering the features of the landscape close to an

eruption.

After a further two hours or so of strenuous walking, midway through the afternoon, we

paused for hot coffee, sitting on and around a fallen tree in a clearing, its dead roots

crumbling and hollow.

Bryan, on edge, turned to me. “We both examined the note-book last night, Iain – you know

none of this matches what your brother said.”

We exchanged concerned glances but said no more.

“Did I hear you just tell of a note-book?” Alastair enquired of me.

I hesitated before answering, but if Alastair was now a part of this, then he was probably

entitled to know what he was getting into. “Yeah – Alby had some of it. The dog, that is,” I

explained. “But this is so different to what he described, we can’t be in the same place.”

I fished the notebook out of my pack and showed Alastair David’s description:

…cover substantially more distance than the previous day. Aibheis was proving to be a gift

that kept on giving: the vast forest was spread out before us, and birdsong echoed from

every copse and break. A small stream ran down through a narrow, deep channel through

the heathers. It truly was a privilege to be one of the first to charter this natural wilderness.

Booth was finally in his element, having identified ptarmigan, capercaillies, and even

witnessing the low swoop of a female hen harrier. Every few metres, it seemed, Booth would

pause to exclaim over plants, mosses and lichens. Given that this was only day two, I was

concerned that Booth will consider the area too important to encourage more public

access…

As Alastair read, he glanced up and looked around him at the terrain, trying to find any echo

of my brother’s description in the land around us.

“We passed a stream, right enough,” he said, “but we’ve seen no sign of life otherwise.” He

shook his head, slightly puzzled.

I, too, was puzzled. From the ranger’s station it had looked like all the rest – teeming with

spring life, shooting plants and birdsong. We’d seen villages razed to the ground with more

sense of life than this.

“Come on: let’s keep going while there is still good light,” I suggested, and we resumed our

march, single file, Bryan and I leading the way, with Richard assuming his habitual place at

the back. Unfamiliar with our procedures and feeling a sense of responsibility for Alastair, we

kept him in the middle of our group.

As we continued on our way, we were strangely quiet – not just the quiet of concentration

and focus on the task in hand, but a quietness born of unease.

“Anyone else feel that we are being watched?” Richard laughed. Then suddenly, he barked,

“Take cover!” yanking Alastair back and to one side, as an unidentified mass fell from a

small, rocky outcrop of land to our side, on to the ground between us. As it landed, dust and

detritus billowed into the air and we were aware of a stale, foetid smell like nothing I had

ever encountered.

“What the…?”

“What is that?” Alastair asked.

We were looking at a tangle of dried hair, sinew, leathered skin and… hooves?

“The hooves are like… is that a deer?” I asked, incredulously.

Alastair stooped to examine it more closely. “Well. It was a deer. I think. But what the hell

has happened to it, I don’t know. It’s like, twisted, knotted – and that – is that – its guts?” He

pointed to where dried, leathery loops bulged through a split in the outer skin. “Just – how

did it get like that?”

We all slowly raised our eyes up rocks of the crag but there was nothing to indicate from

whence the thing had fallen.

Continuing on our way, we were all rather subdued. More than once, each member of the

party peered around but we saw nothing ominous. There was little conversation, however:

we were all too locked up in our own thoughts, too caught up in unspoken questions and

speculations.

Bryan made the call to make camp: he had been monitoring the level of daylight and the

position of the sun and thought we had probably only a good hour of light left. Setting up

camp was difficult as every time we put something down, dust erupted. Pegs were hard to

insert without further choking dust being stirred up and the miasma of dirt in the air made the

dimming light even weaker.

Richard was trying to build a fire from branches. True, we had a stove to cook, but the

cheery light and warmth of a fire would please us all. Alastair’s concerns had been noted

and dismissed: we knew how to control a fire safely, we weren’t ignorant townies!

He need not have worried. Every time Richard tried to pick up a branch, it simply crumbled

into smothering dust. Alastair – not without smugness – handed out head torches from his

pack.

We ate supper and drank some whisky, which inevitably led us into discussing past exploits,

regaling Alastair with exaggerated accounts of shared adventures and misdemeanours.

“How about you, Alastair?” Richard asked after a while. “Did you never fancy the forces?”

He smiled, wryly. “Thought about it, but I got into a spot of bother with the law.” His voice

was quiet, thoughtful. “We were just daft lads on a night out. Too much ale and not enough

sense – you know how it goes.”

I think each of us nodded in agreement: there but for the grace of God…

“Anyway, after a charge of criminal damage to a rich guy’s house and a cautionary couple of

months behind bars, Gordon – the chief ranger – took a chance on me. Never looked back.”

He downed his whisky, accepted another. “The dude whose house I damaged: turns out he

was a golf buddy of the procurator fiscal! Seems you should always check first who you’re

going to piss off, eh?” he laughed.

We joined him in that laughter and, on that cheerful note, readied ourselves to head to our

tents for the night. Bryan disappeared off a short distance to relieve himself and I made sure

all of our provisions were securely stowed away.

Bryan called out as he returned. “You need to see this. This can’t be the same one, but it

looks…” His voice tailed off, uncertainly.

“What? What are you looking at?” I asked.

“That’s the question….”

We walked over to where he was standing. As each of us turned our lamps towards the

mass on the floor, the light pooled over the dust-veiled husk of another deer. A deer

contorted into an impossible shape, its face a grimace of fear and agony, its abdomen split

and internal organs seemingly mummified.

Bryan knelt to examine it more closely, prodding at it with a stick, then turning its body over.

“Can’t see any gunshot. Can’t see any teeth marks. It’s like it’s just dried out so much it’s

split. Just seems odd, to find two like that. You’d expect the bodies to be predated,

scavenged…”

“Is that a burn mark?” Alastair asked, indicating a darker patch of skin.

“Dunno…. Never seen anything like it, to be honest,” Bryan responded.

Uneasily, we settled for the night. I don’t know about the others, but I was slow to sleep,

despite the exertions of the day.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Nordale spoke softly. “I hate to interrupt, but this mark – can you describe it to me?”

Iain shuffled in his wheelchair, adjusting his position, eyes downcast. His hand drifted,

apparently autonomously, towards his right thigh. The tremor in his hand was visible.

Nordale gazed at him steadily, his body language relaxed and unthreatening, but mentally

willing Iain to confide the truth.

Iain gulped down some coffee, now cold, and cleared his throat. “You know, I couldn’t tell

you the last time I didn’t feel exhausted. I can sleep for whole days, but…” His voice tailed

off. “The doctors can’t seem to give me any answers. Seem to think it’s psychosomatic…”

He looked off towards the corner of the room, forgetting Nordale’s question.

“The mark?” he repeated, quietly. “Tell me what it looked like, please, Iain.”

Iain, recalled to the present, answered. “About the size of a hand, I guess. Every corpse we

found had one…”

Nordale silently made a note on the pad in front of him. “An entry wound?”

“No. Just like… an imprint. Dark…”

“And you said, ‘every’ corpse, Iain. Roughly how many?”

Iain turned an anguished gaze towards Nordale. “Every…”

Nordale sat back, nodding acquiescence. He wasn’t ready to answer that yet. “Do you feel

able to continue?”

Iain didn’t answer, just continued his narration of the events.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

I woke the following morning feeling drugged. I crawled towards the tent entrance yet

paused, one hand on the zip, as a feeling of uneasiness – threat? – assailed me. I crawled

out of the fug of my tent, knife in hand expecting morning freshness, yet the air was heavy,

polluted. I rapidly boiled the kettle on the stove, craving caffeine. Richard soon emerged,

equally on edge, glancing around warily as I proffered him a cup of coffee. “You look like I

feel,” I said.

“Couldn’t sleep. When I did, had weird dreams… Feel knackered,” he yawned, gulping down

coffee.

Bryan, similarly tired and on edge, grumbled, “So come on, then, what did you decide last

night? What did you find?”

We stared at him, bewildered.

“I heard you both talking – you needn’t pretend – but I wasn’t answering you nor coming out

at that time of night!” He glowered at us both, clearly annoyed.

“Bryan,” I answered, hesitantly, “neither of us called for you to come out. We were asleep.

We have both literally been awake for minutes. You must have been dreaming?”

“One of you shook my tent! I heard you calling me to come out! So if this is your idea of a

joke, you can bloody drop it!“

Alastair, clearly woken by our noise, also crawled out of his tent.

Bryan turned to him. “You must have heard them, your tent is next to mine!” he snapped.

“Unless you’re in on it…. Bloody whispering and calling half the night long…”

Alastair simply looked bewildered. “Bryan – why would any of us do that? Be reasonable –

sure, you must have been dreaming. Too much whisky?” he suggested lightly, turning to

rezip the doorway to his tent.

Bryan seized his shoulder, spinning him around so that he fell and had to scramble

inelegantly to his feet. “Don’t bloody patronize me, I know what I heard!” he yelled into

Alastair’s shocked face.

In the next instant, Richard was between them, squaring up to Bryan, who knew better than

to try to get past him. “Get a grip, Bry! Nothing happened!”

Bryan sat down sullenly, near the stove. I passed him coffee, but he remained silent and

morose, setting the tone for the morning.

We ate, packed up camp and set off once more, still in convoy, but with Bryan pushing the

pace so that although remaining in sight, he was out of earshot, clearly unwilling to

converse.

We walked throughout the morning, each of us focused on the march ahead of us,

constantly looking around us in search of anything that might inform our direction, anything

to indicate that David and his party had passed that way.

Alastair was concerned that he had somehow caused the dissent amongst us but I was

quick to reassure him that he was in no way to blame. “I don’t think I have ever known Bryan

to apologise,” I said, “but believe me, when he’s ready he’ll just drop it and carry on as

though nothing had happened.”

The words were hardly out of my mouth when Bryan turned and called back, “Alastair – can I

borrow your bino’s?”

Alastair quickly walked over to oblige him and Bryan stared through the binoculars fixedly for

a moment. He passed them back to Alastair: “Have a look – is that a bright colour at eleven

o’clock? Like – maybe the fabric of a tent?”

Alastair looked, nodded agreement and we hastened through the undergrowth in that

direction. We neared a small, natural clearing where a quantity of fabric lay puddled on the

ground, almost concealed from sight in a dip in the rutted land.

I ran ahead, breaking all of the procedures instilled in my head through years of practice, in

my anxiety to find any evidence of David or Junior. “David!” I yelled, stumbling into what had

clearly been a campsite. My eagerness was soon subdued by the realization that this was an

old campsite: no sign of life remained.

Worse was to come. The fabric of a second tent was wrapped and secured firmly around

what was distinctly a body-shaped mound.

I flung myself to my knees beside it and, with trembling hands, my heart thudding painfully in

my chest, I carefully unwrapped the head. Or what had been the head.

Like the deer, this was a contorted, desiccated… almost mummified, face, its mouth frozen

in a silent rictus. I heard Alastair gasp, horrified.

“Is that our boy?” Richard asked sombrely.

The face was unrecognizable, the brow discoloured by a blackish mark similar to that which

we had seen on the deer. I cautiously unwrapped the body a little further until I could see the

neck of a cagoule. The back of the collar showed the manufacturer’s logo. And a name tag.

Booth. These were the remains of the ill-fated naturalist…

I exhaled, the immediate anxiety for my family removed. But the fear returned almost

instantly. If this had happened to Booth, had the same fate befallen them? And… what had

transformed a living man into this empty husk? Nothing I had ever experienced or heard of

could make sense of what I was seeing, and I had seen far too many bodies over the years.

“Iain – take a look at this!” Bryan called out. He was kneeling by the coolbox. He had

removed its lid to find that it contained only a thick layer, some inches deep, of dust. The

wrappers, however, indicated that it had been food. Certainly, roughly three weeks could

have passed since they were here – but that could in no way explain this extraordinary

condition – not in a sealed cooling box – let alone explain the state of the body.

Alastair, his face white with shock, was turning on his radio with trembling hands. Although

physically strong, his role had never called on him to do more than caution inconsiderate

hikers. “I have to call this in! This needs the police – someone with more authority than us!”

he exclaimed.

We saw the power indicator on his radio flicker greenly for a few seconds – then fade to

nothing. No efforts on Alastair’s part could return it to action. “These were new batteries

yesterday,” he spluttered, confused. “They should be good for at least a week! That settles it:

with no radio, we need to head back to base and wait for assistance.”

“You can return, if you must. I’m not leaving,” I insisted.

Bryan and Richard, doubt on their faces, clearly thought that Alastair’s argument had some

merit.

“Can’t you see? The state of this – “I gestured towards the body – “David and Junior have

been out here so long already - I can’t go back – I can’t risk not staying and at least trying to

find them!”

“We have to regroup at the checkpoint,” Bryan reasoned. “Iain – I know what you’re thinking,

mate, but don’t be stupid. This is an operation. You know we have to regroup. The team

stays together,” Bryan quietly insisted.

Richard placed his hand on my shoulder in a mute gesture of understanding, then firmly and

insistently pulled me to my feet to start the return.

“Look, leave them a note in case they come back,” Bryan suggested. “Tell them, if they have

returned here, to stay put and wait for us.”

Reluctantly, but given no real choice, I did as I was ordered, then with heavy heart followed

them back on to the trail by which we had arrived. We left water and some dried rations

behind us. In case.

Sometimes I hate Bryan’s calm logic. I knew he was right: I also knew I wasn’t going back.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

A knock on the door disturbed Iain’s account; Sergeant Emma Nicholls entered the room

and whispered into Nordale’s ear.

Nordale swore, as she left the room. “My apologies Iain, I need to attend to this matter…

would you be OK to come back tomorrow maybe? Same time?”

Iain shuffled in his chair, then nodded. “Uh… yeah, sure. I have time. I think…”

Nordale shook Iain’s hand and apologized again before leaving the interview room.

“You OK, sir?” Sergeant Nicholls asked.

“Yeah… just, his hand was freezing…” Nordale mumbled. He looked back down the corridor

at the former soldier lifelessly wheeling his chair out of the interview room.

3) said I needed to be smart to have a job
4) said she'd reject me if she were the recruiter 
5) I remember it was her 21st birthday but she kept insisting I met her 3 days before her birthday so she could give me treat which I understand but didn't want to meet me on her actual birthday. And on her actual birthday she took those people with her who she hated.
And after the party she speaks shit about them to me.
6) ok the latest thing was she called me to a coffee shop and only bought herself a drink is that normal? Cause later I went to McDonald's and bought both of us something to eat. So yea

• she sees a kitten in a pet shop and decides to get it as a surprise for the girls but reserves him instead of buying him there since she’s barely able to carry the bags she has now

• she comes home and is absolutely kicking herself for wearing heels because her feet are killing her and Cyclops teases her about wearing them to go shopping in a mall for hours in a callback to an issue of Astonishing X-Men but she steps on his toe with her heel and says “they’re good for shutting you up”

• she then relaxes watching Love Actually while Scott nurses his toe having learned his lesson about what happens when you annoy Emma Frost with the Cuckoos coming down to watch the movie with their mother

We reconnected recently over a random Instagram conversation, and it just accidentally turned into regular chats. Last week she asked if I wanted to meet for coffee. I said yes without really overthinking it. The date was simple, just talking, catching up, and laughing about old school memories. It didn’t feel awkward or tense, just unexpectedly comfortable. I kept thinking, “Wow, this is my first date as the real me,” and that alone made it special. I’m not labeling anything yet or assuming it will turn into something huge.

1phc76n,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1phc76n/at_what_point_do_i_just_call_it_quits_with_dating/,At what point do I just call it quits with dating?,"30m and I’ve never had a relationship, only one (awkward) kiss and a virgin. High school was rough and I had severe acne that lingered into college, although I was eventually put on a medicine that permanently cleared it. I had terrible confidence for years although I was still trying to put myself out there in college. Looking back though, I don’t think it was enough.

Anyway, after college I was basically in survival mode for years although I was still on the apps. Nothing ever worked out other than getting coffee with an older coworker I matched with. She had to move back home shortly thereafter so it wasn’t going to work anyway. 

Now that I’m 30 I’m reconsidering dating and family plans. I initially wanted a family but as it stands now, I’m unsure. The dating “pool” in my city is hardly even a pool… more like a heavily polluted pond. I live in a city of about 250k, but unfortunately I do not have the means to move, and I’m not sure moving solely for the purpose of dating is the answer when I have a duplex, a good job and a sense of stability and security.

I’m still on the apps but at this point, I have no idea why. I’ve had a few dates but none of them were feeling it. I thought I had something going with a woman but her schedule I found was chaotic with work and school. She wanted to grab drinks but since mentioning it she’s been wildly inconsistent with communication. I’m not going to reach out -again- as I feel as though I’m crossing into the chasing territory. 

My mental health from using this apps has tanked. All of my incoming likes are from women that are almost 100% incompatible, and whatever matches I do end up getting, none of them respond. Or if they do, I have a good conversation with them one day then never hear from them again. I’m no Brad Pitt, but I take care of myself and eat healthy, go to the gym, practice yoga, etc. If what I’m seeing on dating apps are my only real options then I’m out.. 

When is it time to throw in the towel? I’m now going to therapy as I have other issues I need to resolve, but I’m hopeless and quite frankly wish I had no interest in dating but it all feels so urgent at this point..

I’ve been doing the swipe/ghost/ghost-back/“let’s grab coffee but never do” dance enough times to notice a pattern. Over the years I’ve learned there are things worth bringing up and working through (yellow flags), and things that are safeties-off or deal breakers (red flags). Here’s what I look for straight from my experience  and how I decide whether to stay, push for change, or just walk away.

**Yellow flags (worth watching, worth conversation)**

* Inconsistent communication: They go MIA for days then act like nothing happened. Could be busy life or poor habits  call it out. If they hear you and make an effort, that’s a green light to try.
* Different tempo on texting/DMs: You like more check-ins; they like less. Not ideal, but negotiable if both respect boundaries.
* Avoiding serious topics (future, finances, values): It’s awkward, but bring it up. If they genuinely can’t discuss it yet, set a timeline in your head for when you need answers.
* Frequent canceling (with apologies but no change): Give them a chance, then watch whether behavior shifts.
* Flirtatious/ambiguous social media behavior: Uncomfortable? Say so. Some people don’t see it; others will change.

What I do: I raise it calmly, say what I need, and give one clear example + one change I’d like. If they respond and try  I stay. If it’s the same cycle after a few honest tries, I treat it like a red flag.

**Red flags (walk away, no negotiation)**

* Dishonesty or repeated small lies (especially about important stuff): Trust is the foundation. Once it’s cracked, it’s really hard to rebuild.
* Gaslighting or making you question your reality: “You’re too sensitive” when you bring up something valid = immediate nope.
* Controlling or isolating behavior: Attempts to limit who you see, where you go, or what you do.
* Physical or sexual coercion, any threats, or violence: This is non-negotiable  get to safety and support.
* Repeated boundary violations after you’ve been clear: Words matter, but actions are the real test.

If I see any of these, I remove myself. I don’t debate–I prioritize safety and my sanity.

**How I decide whether to walk away**

1. Safety first. If I feel unsafe or disrespected, I leave.
2. Pattern > one-off. Everyone messes up. If it’s a repeated pattern even after clear boundaries, that’s the end.
3. Effort and humility. Do they own mistakes? Do they change? Willingness to learn matters.
4. Core values vs. preferences. Different music tastes = fine. Wanting kids vs. not ever wanting kids = not fine unless you can accept that difference long-term.
5. Gut check. If something keeps gnawing at me, I pay attention.

**Quick scripts I use**

* Yellow flag talk: “Hey, I noticed we’ve been cancelling a lot. I really like spending time with you  can we make a plan that works for both of us?”
* Red flag exit: “I don’t feel respected in this relationship. I think it’s best if we stop seeing each other.”

**Practical tips**

* Set standards before you sink time into someone (deal breakers vs negotiables).

* Track patterns, not single incidents. Keep your friends in the loop for perspective.

1phc6kh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phc6kh,My brain scans before and after matcha vs. coffee,"Hi everyone, I did another quick test.

Before and after matcha + I compared my scans with the before and after coffee ones.

**After coffee:**  
  
1) High-beta stayed elevated and became more coherent (focused but busy)  
2) Alpha response increased, but from a low starting point  
3) Fatigue index went slightly up after stimulation

**Interpretation:** alert + organized arousal + a mild cost in fatigue.  


**After matcha:**

* High-beta decreased in intensity, especially frontally (less mental tension)
* Peak alpha increased from around 10.1 to 10.5 Hz (faster cognitive processing)
* Fatigue index dropped (from around 2.47 to around 2.05), meaning effort required less strain

the way I see it, with coffee, my alertness increased, but with tension risk. and with matcha, alpha was faster, and I had less fatigue, my brain was alert and calm  


**For transparency:** I work at Myndlift and used our tools for these cans. It’s just my own data (n=1).",12,1765199924.0,Biohackers,8,0.77,False

I jumped out of bed and opened the window to let in fresh air. While brushing my teeth, I noticed the silence, usually my neighborhood is crowded with people leaving for work. After dressing and drinking my bitter coffee, I went outside. Even though I wasn’t working today, I liked keeping my routine of early walks in the late summer coldness. But something felt… different.

Streetlights were off, the sun hadn’t risen, and no one seemed to be around. The trees looked like creatures ready to harm me if getting close. The cold wind swirling around me sent shivers down my spine. I felt watched. In my mind, people stood still in their houses, following me with dead eyes. I gagged at the thought but tried to stay calm.

I reached the end of the street, facing the park with the lake where I usually read. The wind had stopped, yet the swing in the children’s area was still swaying… as if someone had just been there. I approached the lake and stared at the dark water, perfectly still like a mirror. My reflection was barely recognizable. The clouds hid the sun, letting only a small wave of light to win the battle. I still felt watched. Turning to go back, I froze.

A person stood by the benches near the park exit. A dark, still silhouette, barely human. Its body faced me, but its head was turned 180 degrees. “Hello?!” I shouted. Seconds later, it repeated in my voice: “Hello?!”

I screamed; it screamed. I stepped back; it stepped forward. It moved closer so slowly it seemed unreal, like a glitch in time. I couldn’t tell if I imagined it, but the distance was getting shorter.

Terrified, I ran, hearing my own breathing and steps behind me, perfectly imitated. I reached my street and stopped. Everything was silent. The sun was up, but the atmosphere remained unnerving. Houses revealed people standing still in windows, staring at me… but the eyes were missing!

My chest started to burn, and I felt to the ground. Blood was falling from my chest. I watched behind to see the person from the park… it was me. I was that person. The doppelgänger was facing me eyeless and smiling. Its mouth was covered in blood eating something. In an instant, it attacked me. I felt on my back and jumped right at it ready to fight... only to wake up in my bed sweating and hardly breathing.

The alarm was going crazy. 6 AM. Why was I so shaken? I couldn’t remember the dream, but my chest and head hurt. I jumped up, opened the window, then went to the bathroom. As I saw my reflection, I froze. The back of my head stared at me from the mirror, twisted 180 degrees.

There is a man who clings to my ceiling and watches me as I sleep. His limbs are smooth and grey with an ash-like quality.  His skin reminds me of the wings of a moth. He has no mouth, nose, or ears. He only has eyes, twice as big as a normal human’s. They do not blink, but they shimmer like moons reflected in rain puddles. 

I don’t know why he’s there. There must be some reason why he takes some interest in me. I wish I could understand it.   
  
He’s not always stationary. Occasionally, he’ll sit on the edge of my bed while I take off my makeup. Once, he even cocked his head to the side, as if taking note of the curious ritual that is my nightly death.   
  
I do indeed die every night when I take off my face. I am born again in the morning, though I think \*born\* is too small a word. It’s much more like a cruel reincarnation that I’m forced to go through every time the velours and silks fall off my body. My hat and nose are kept on my vanity like icons or patron saints, though I feel no comfort placing them there. It’s not where they belong. I wonder if the faceless man knows these are my thoughts.   
  
I don’t know. I’ve never bothered asking. He never bothers asking me anything, and it’s my room, anyhow.   
  
When I lie down in my cotton sheets and old down pillow, ready for burial under the cover of night, there is no one to place coins on my eyes for the ferryman. I am left to languish in a dreamless purgatory. No Hermes or Valkyrie leads me to death. No force pulls me from the Bardo. I am left to wait in the tomb with my visitor looking down on me. Perhaps his eyes are the only coins I’ll receive. Perhaps he’ll come down one day and place them upon my own.   
  
I’ve decided to name him Gooby.

\*\*\*

I do not like instant coffee. It’s disingenuous and tastes like burnt butter. That said, I drink it every morning. This is for several reasons, the least of which is that a singular mug appears on my end table daily, bearing the inscription “Clowning around.” The other reasons are personal and have to do with love languages, such as gift giving, and my general laziness in preparing anything else to drink.  
  
I think Gooby prepares it for me. I don’t know.  
  
I didn’t see him sitting on the edge of my bed that morning, so I imagine he’s off doing something. Maybe he crochets. I wonder if he’d make me a hat.

As I take my first sip of coffee and let its bitter warmth infest my veins, I stare at myself in the mirror and feel my blood run cold. This happens every morning without fail, and it never ceases to terrify me to my core. It is the kind of petrifying fear that you only get when noticing a figure at the corner of your vision. A stranger is watching me through the glass, drinking instant coffee out of a mug labeled “dnuorA gninwolC”. I don’t recognize his face. 

I have a medical condition. Probably should have mentioned that, but better late than never. Doctors say it’s something similar to Depersonalization-Derealization Disorder, but it’s not quite that. You typically feel like you’re in a dreamlike state with DPDR, and everything is supposed to move more slowly. I don’t feel like I’m in a dream at all. Everything moves the same. Everything feels so vivid and focused that I sometimes almost vomit from motion sickness. No, I feel like I’m awake, aware, and painfully receptive to the horrible things of my reality. It’s just my face.

I never recognize my face. It’s never the same to me. I can’t tell if it switches forms or if my memory is simply that bad, but I am never at ease with it. My makeup is the only thing that calms me down. 

I start my ritual the same every morning. First is the white makeup, the canvas, the blank slate from which I carve my visage. Then comes the black, void, deeper than night and shadow, festering like a ripe spawn of the depths. Then I draw a little shamrock on my cheek because I like green. Finally, I force on my red eyebrows and smile. I apply enough powder to last through a hurricane, and finally, I'm ready to go. I step out of my trailer and into the desert that I call home. 

What I stated in the title is true. I reside in a permanent Carnival fixture that rests on the side of a near-endless stretch of highway in the middle of the desert. I have no idea what state I'm in, nor if I'm even in America. What I do know is that any mail I get is completely unmarked, save for my name, and it always appears at the doorstep of my trailer every week, anchored under a rock.  I'm fairly certain the boss reads my mail, which is why my name is always misspelled on the envelope, but I don't care.  I cook for myself, clean up after myself, and live alone in a trailer that I'm almost certain used to be a drug den. I cleaned it up, got rid of all the stains in the carpet,  and now it is mine.  I do find the occasional needle or bone every once in a while, but no home is perfect, especially around here.

I'm not completely devoid of supplies, of course. There is a gas station about a mile down the road run by an elderly couple who swear I'm not the strangest thing they've seen walking into their doors at night. I am apparently the friendliest, which is worrying in its own regard. 

I use them to stock up on basic groceries and toiletries to get by, which is convenient considering that my pay is what many would consider abysmal. That said, in the instance that the boss sees this and decides to dock me for complaining,  I am joking. I don't have much I need to buy anyway, and, scary as it may be, delivery services do still work out here.

But that is my existence, and one that I am stuck with. I have a gigantic orange tricycle that I ride when I don't want to walk, and a comfy set of size 20 shoes that get me the rest of the way. All in all, it’s a steady job, but one I find taxing on the best days. 

I'll summarize it like this:  I am a clown who does not talk. I never talk. I'm half convinced I can't, but even if I wanted to try, it wouldn't be with the people around here. Most of my coworkers are fine people as they are, but sometimes the scarier things come in the form of the guests.

  One of my talents is balloon animals. I can make almost anything proficiently.  Sometimes I'll get the occasional person who wants to try and challenge me, and they’ll try to order off the menu I carry around with my balloon bag. Many times, they're innocent enough.  Several children want their favorite cartoon characters, or Tommy guns, or ( insert exotic animal here), but on occasion, the requests can get a tad morbid. 

Today, I remember one corpulent little boy stopping me on my way to clean out the petting zoo to make such a request. 

“Can you make a spine?” he asked me.

I stared at him for a second before raising my question-mark sign. 

“Y’know,” he repeated, “A spine? Like what’s in your back?”

The stare continued as a couple in matching Hawaiian shirts walked up behind him. They were assumed to be his parents, but they did not attempt to dissuade him. 

“Carter,” said the woman in a distinctly shrill Minnesota accent, “Don’t be silly.”

“Carter, you know better,” said the man with an almost shriller accent, “you have to be more specific. What kind of spine?”

“Oh!” the boy said, with a wide smile. “Duh! Sorry, Mr. Clown. Can I have a human spine, please?

I kept the question-mark sign up. 

“Oh, it doesn’t have to have a skull attached!” the man laughed, “Sorry for the confusion. Just the spine itself would be nice for the boy.”

“Oh, maybe a pelvis!” the woman added. “Good eatin’ on one of those. Could you do that, Mr. Clown?”

By this point, I had retrieved my whiteboard and expo marker to try and write out a more sophisticated response, but the woman cut me off. 

“Y’know,” she said, reaching into her beach bag, “kinda like this?”

Out of the bag, she proceeded to pull out a yellow spine, at least a meter in length. It was old, though not dusty, and had several gnarled splinters coming off of its vertebrae. I was hesitant to ask where she’d gotten it, but the man spoke up next her her.

“Oh, would you look at that, hon?” he said, all sentimental, “That’s from our first road trip, innit? What was his name?” 

“Jo?”

“No, wasn’t jo? Hank?” 

“Dillion!” said the boy. “You told me about that one.” 

The boy’s father ruffled his shaggy hair as he adjusted his sunglasses. “That’s it! Wow! Look at the kid on this brain, hon! So mindful!”

“He sure is!” the woman said. “That trip was before you were even born.”

“Ah, good memories. Good memories…” The father looked back at me with a smile. “So what d’ya say, Mr. Clown? Spine sound good?”

He held out a twenty, and if I were a prouder man, I would’ve been more apprehensive at taking it. But a twenty is a twenty. I made the best spine I could, using every shade of white and bone yellow I could think of, and in less than a minute, the boy was holding his latex prize and beaming like it was Christmas. 

The parents thanked me and parted ways, and I can’t recall seeing them the rest of the day. I went about my normal route through the petting zoo, the ferris wheel, the hall of mirrors, etc., and it wasn’t until this evening that I heard of anything wrong. 

A sheriff’s deputy was at the gates by six o’clock and was speaking sternly with the head manager. The manager, Bill, an older man who always wore a striped jacket and straw boater hat, was making every disarming gesture in the book as he conversed with the man. Eventually, the deputy left, and Bill locked the gates behind him. He passed by and gave a bright, “Evening, Bubbles!” but I stopped him with my question-sign. 

“Oh, that?” He said, smiling, “It’s nothing. Just something for the boss to handle.”

 I gave the sign another shake. 

“Oh, Bubs,” he said, checking over his shoulder before leaning in. “They’re just looking for one of the teenagers from back in town. That’s all.” He straightened his bowtie. “Y’know, Bradley, who works the tickets at the Ferris wheel? His folks called the sheriff and said he was supposed to be home hours ago. Never did clock out, come to think of it… Well, I don’t know. He only tore tickets for one family today- great tippers, by the way- and, well…” He paused and held up his hands defensively. “I’m rambling. Point is, it’s nothing for you to worry about. Go get some rest! We still have a few weeks until tourist season starts up again. Savor it all while you can!”

With that, he was off, and I was left feeling for the twenty in my pocket. There was nothing to be done. At the end of the day, there was no one to tell, and I didn’t even have a name or vehicle to attach to any floating suspicions. Not to mention, it was getting late, and the gas station was at least half an hour away by trike, so I stowed my balloons, unlocked my ride from its fence post, and took off down the road. The gas station’s glow was a fly-light in the distance, and I was a moth with twenty dollars to spend. 

\*\*\*

Most children, on a long car ride, for whatever reason, imagine some kind of being that runs alongside them on the road. It’s always moving at impossible speeds, keeping time with every stop, turn, and acceleration, pacing like a silent wolf through a deep bed of snow. I never had one of those as a child, but I do have one now, more or less.  
  
As I race my trike through the obsidian night, a single LED headlight gleaming, I sometimes see a pale figure, stark white and tall, bounding on the horizon towards the road. Sometimes, when I ride slower, I swear I can hear him howling something. He seems urgent, panicked, even, but I can’t make out his face. He’s a blip in the twilight of the desert. A single pale flame shimmering on the backdrop of a purple void. If I wait even longer, his mournful voice sounds familiar to me, but even then, I cannot recognize him.   
  
I’ve tried to name him, but nothing sticks. Chad didn’t work. Didn’t have the right mouthfeel. Neither did Otis or Wheeler. He’s such a simple-looking thing, and those are always the hardest to name. I’ve just started calling him “That Guy,” and that works about as well as anything. He’s always gone when I make it to the gas station, but he reappears on my rides back, still in the distance and still running.   
  
That Guy is odd, for sure,  but in all the years I’ve seen him, he’s never done me a bad turn. His presence, even if unsettling, reminds me that I’m not alone on my nightly ride. I blew him a kiss tonight in a dramatic fashion before entering my trailer. His howling evaporated as my door slammed shut.   
  
I brought Gooby back some peanut M&Ms and left them on my dresser with a note saying they were his. I didn’t really think about how he’d eat them, seeing as he has no mouth, but I figured it was the thought that counted. I performed my ritual and stared briefly at the stranger in the mirror before me, trying to take in any solid feature, but I couldn’t. I shivered and went to bury myself in the covers of my bed, but was met by something unexpected.  
  
There, neatly folded on my pillow, was a crocheted cap with a tassel on the end. It was a handsome thing and only vaguely smelled of vinegar. I put on, and that was enough inspiration to get me to write this. Long post, I know, but hey, I have a new hat. I think it’s rather nice of Gooby to do, and I wanted to brag on him. If he does anything else brag-worthy, I’ll be sure to post again. In the meantime, wish me luck and pray to whatever you may believe in that the gas station gets a new instant ramen flavor in soon. I’m getting tired of shrimp.  Thanks for reading this far.   
  
  
  
Also, on a separate note, if you meet a midwestern couple in Hawaiian shirts, maybe try being somewhere else. Or make a balloon animal for them. 

Goodnight.

The sooner in your life you can do therapy with an excellent psychotherapist, the better! and the more genuine relationships you’ll be able to build.

Just venting. I’ve had this friend since high school. Twenty years of friendship. And only now do I see that it’s been an unbalanced relationship.

I always noticed some of her flaws but I would overlook them. And I had mine too… sometimes I talked too much about my pain and problems. My inner child was hurting. Hers is too. And we know that everyone who comes from dysfunctional families ends up staining their attitudes and relationships, even unconsciously. But this not more a bons between us..

now I’m free. I was released from psychotherapy. And since then everything has changed so much. Including my relationships with people.

This friend of mine is lazy, doesn’t like reading or developping herself to be a better person. but she always wants to take advantage of a better life (?). i’ve always been the opposite. But ever since I distanced myself from her, I feel much more like myself. My essence.

The last time she came to my place, I started feeling bothered by the fact that she laughed every time I was in some “disadvantage,” like when I bumped my toe into the door… etc.

Besides that, I began feeling very uncomfortable with her clueless and territorial behavior, trying to force a friendship with the new friends I’m making here in my city, which I put some bounderies(when she herself can’t seem to make any).

It bothered me a lot how she’s always performing to manipulate people’s perception of her… it’s exhausting.

But the final straw is that I’m doing well financially and buying special furniture for my home, among other things. which her case is the opposite.

In the same week, when she went back to her place, she looked online and found the same 1950s coffee table I have. She sent me a picture and said she only didn’t buy it because they don’t deliver and she’d have to pick it up.

I don’t know if I’m exaggerating, but I thought it was absurd.

Her whole childhood was full of comparisons. It seems she never overcame that and now wants to enter some kind of competitiveness… I sense the smell of unprocessed envy now!!

As soon as she arrived back at her place, it didn’t take long for her to invite herself over again to my home (we live three hours apart by plane). I found that quite unusual. As if she could feel she no longer has power over me and wants to keep updating herself about my life…

“They say when you fall in love. Its like you hear music in the air, Well thats not how I felt. I was hot, in a crowded, loud restaurant with waiters running around left and right. On my third “date” with some guy who, was loudly talking about how much money he makes. He was unimpressive online and pathetic in person and while he kept boasting to the unimpressed waitress, I realized he only 3 topics of conversation, how much money he has, why crypto is the future, and what the possibility of us fucking tonight was … in his words “I know you women have that third date rule”. I really didn't give a fuck about him, but after 2 dates and 20 voicemails begging to see me again because I was “different” and “easy to be with”. Whatever the fuck that meant. Here I was. I knew I didn't like him but, a free meal is a free meal.

 It was a cold dark night. The sound of my heels clicking sounded off the pavement. Wanting to get home as soon as possible I cut through Angelus Park. My thoughts floated back to my date as I made my way through the playground. I was upset. What should've been a romantic walk home was now a speed walk in the dark. I mean I’m a 33 year old single woman, with a great job, my own home, and no kids. And what’s my prize? Dates with every Tom, Dick, and Brandon, who can’t finish a conversation without looking at another woman’s tits. Putting myself through dating hell to make a dead woman happy. 

 Out of everything she could’ve asked on her deathbed. “Make me proud, find a good husband.” Thinking about her words angered me even more. I knew she meant good, me being the youngest of two, but those were her dying words to a 15 year old. I knew what she meant “Don’t be alone for the rest of your life” but it still cut deep. Weren’t my accomplishments enough? I was deep in my thought. When a white flash shot in front of my eyes. I looked up for a moment thinking it was lightning. Just what I needed, rain. I picked up the pace trying to get out of the park and to my building. When I noticed something odd. The statue that normally adorned the fountain in the middle of the park was gone. 

  I looked at the empty space for a moment. Suddenly a throbbing headache rung in my head, the air around me felt fuzzy and my mouth felt dry as my eyes struggled to focus. “Did that fucking creep slip me something?” Another flash of lighting bursted in front of me. My head felt like it was spinning. I was disoriented and I almost walked into another flash of light. It felt hot on my skin as it flashed in front of my eyes. I started walking faster when a sound came from behind me. My vision kept blurring as my brain and heart pounded in my ears. The park lights started exploding going out one by one and leaving me in darkness. I ran. There was a steady rumbling behind me, like stone on pavement. The ground vibrated underneath my feet. I ran as fast as I could until I made it out the park.

 I refused to look behind me. That entire run home I felt someone watching me, I didn't turn around to see who or what it was. When I finally made it to my apartment I kept the lights off and covered all the windows with curtains. As I closed the last window something caught my eye. At the top of the building across the street a large pale angelic figure. It was glowing under the large moon.  I stared at it for a moment when my stomach began to turn. My eyes went wide as I realized what it was and shut the blinds.

 The next morning I woke up surprisingly chipper. Momentarily forgetting last nights events. I’d slept the best I’d slept in months. I realized I even had time to stop at the coffee shop before I went to work. When I walked down the street I felt different. The air felt fresher. The world looked so vibrant. I felt like I was floating on air. I even found myself humming a little tune as I walked into the coffee shop.

 It was busy when I walked in. As I waited on line the smell of roasted beans and baked goods filled the air around me. The speakers quietly playing Frank Valli’s “Can’t take my eyes off you” in the background . I smiled to myself, what a cute coincidence. That’s what I was humming on my way here. 

 The boy a the counter looked exhausted. Heavy bags under his eyes. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days. Not really a shock though everyone knew about his dads sudden illness. I’d be exhausted if I was him too, balancing college and running a whole store at the same time while taking care of my dad. I gave him a smile as I ordered and tipped him 10$. I stepped off to the side to wait for my order.

   I watch as people come in and out the coffee shop while I wait for my food. When in walks in the most handsome man id ever seen. Tall, with green eyes and curly dark hair. The way he walked got my attention. Head held high and confident, smiling as he walked up the counter and put in his order. A strong arm handing the barista his card. I realized Id been staring too long when he locked eyes with me. My face flushed red as I looked away. I looked out the side of my eyes pretending I was on my phone. Everyone else faded out the way when he moved over to the pick up area. My heart beat in time to the song playing on the speakers.

*Dum - dum dum- dum- dum dum*

  There it was. Clear as day, that melody they speak of. The world got quiet.

“Your just too good to be true, can’t take my eyes off of you”

“Kelsey, right?” said the man as he approached. “Huh” I said coming back down to earth. He laughed. “You live in the riverside apartments, right?” I nodded taken a back by his deep voice. “Sorry is that weird? I wasn't trying to be creepy .” He said sheepishly. A strong muscled arm reaching up to scratch the back of his neck, “I’m Jason. I’ve seen you in the lobby.” He said taking a cursory glance down my body. “ I live on the 5th floor.” He says flashing me a grin. I felt like we were the only people here. “Oh yeah I've seen you before” I said convincingly. If this handsome stranger says we’ve seen each other, who am I to correct him. A smirk played o his lips
 
  “Sooooo?” He trailed off, a brow raised. I looked at him for a moment when it hit me “Um yeah, Kelsey, that’s~a~me” I said nervously before clearing my throat “ That’s me” I repeated mentally facepalming myself. He looked at me for a moment deeply gazing in my eyes. Was this it. Could it be…Love at first sight? “I hope you don’t find this strange but ever since I saw you this morning. I can’t get you out my head. I was wondering if I could take you out?” He asked. I thought for a moment. Before I could answer my name was called. My food was ready. 

 “How about this” I said picking up a napkin and pulling a pen out of my bag, writing down my number. “Text me” I said giving him the napkin, then quickly grabbing my tea and croissant, heading off before I was late for work. The rest of the day was normal. That feeling of walking on air intensified. And I found myself humming that song around the office. We texted all day and made plans to hang out later that night. Each message, each laugh, each flirtation raised the proverbial volume in my head. I felt electric almost like every piece of me, even the air, was full of static 

“You’d be like heaven to touch I wanna hold you so much, at long last love has arrived”.
 
 I felt nervous as I got ready, giddy even. I mean this guy was hot and he seemed cool. I looked at myself in the mirror as I did some last few touches to my outfit. I look good. Not too covered, not too slutty the Samantha Jones special, I thought as walked over to the vanity to put on some perfume.

  As I finished getting ready it occurred to me, what if tonight was the night I made my momma proud. “Make me proud, find a good husband.” her words rang through my head yet again, this time reaching over the song that had been stuck in my mind all day. It sent a cold chill down my spine. “Don’t be alone for the rest of your life” she repeated. The room started getting brighter as my moms voice echoed in my head, I looked around in confusion as the light bulbs on my vanity got so bright I could hardly look at them, then the light next to my mirror burst. I jumped turning to look at the lamp. As I got up, the vanity lights followed after it. One after another until the only working light left was the one in the living room. I had a flashback to last night, the park, the street lights bursted the same way. I felt my head start throbbing. I put my hand on my head trying to dull the pain. I closed my eyes and took a few deep breaths “Everything's going to be okay” I thought to myself.

 When I opened my eyes I screamed. A statued version of my mom stood behind me. Pale, and tall, it loomed over me. It looked just like her but with some slight differences. The longer I stared, I noticed how her features were slightly off. They looked like they were sliding off her face. They moved slowly and would snap back up like it was following your eye movements. I looked behind me, there was nothing there. When I turned back, she stood closer almost expressionless. Except, for the big scowl on her face. Id seen that look many times before, its the same face she’d make when I’d get in trouble as a child. The same face she had in her hospital bed. She stood still looking directly at me, her features slowly began to shift and merge one on top of the other. I stared at her in the mirror. When I heard her voice in my ear “Your brother was always the better listener” she said in a sickeningly sweet whisper. I felt the anger rise in me. I threw the perfume bottle I held in my hand making the mirror shatter in front of me.

 As I looked at the shattered glass on the floor. A part of me knew I should be scared but I wasn’t all I felt wasn’t anger. I saw her looking at me in the broken pieces. Different angles of her marbled face stared at me, all with different versions if that scowl. I ran out my apartment locking the door behind me and taking a moment to catch my breath, when a message popped up on my phone. 

“Wya?”
 
 I looked down at my phone and I felt myself calm down. A huge smile spread on my lips.

 “Omw"" 

 “Pardon the way that I stare. There’s nothing else to compare”
  
 I made my way upstairs. Smoothing my dress down before knocking on his door. It felt like hours before he opened it. I found myself humming absentmindedly as I waited. My moms words still running thought my head but, I knew I was doing the right thing. 

 When he opened the door the world stopped. I felt short of breath. He looked perfect. Frank Valli’s voice floated out of his apartment. I smiled at him, feeling nervous and excited. I wondered if he’d had the song stuck in his head all day too. “Come in, you look beautiful.”

 When I stepped inside. It was small. As I looked around I felt slightly disappointed. I had thought he was distinguished and tasteful, the type to have artwork on his walls and leather couches, with whiskey and oak scented candles. Yet before me was a ceiling to floor collection of funko pops. It was messy and cramped, a pile of dirty clothes lazily tucked away in the closet. Posters of over sexualized anime girls stared me down as I walked in. The carpet was stained making crunching sounds as I walked. I tried to hide my disgust when he invited me to sit on the sagging beige futon with questionable stains.

 My head was still throbbing and the smell made it worse. The melody that’s been playing so freely in my mind began to slow and distort. I could feel my moms words taking over  “Make me proud, find a good husband.” A part if me felt like she was still with me, watching…waiting. It made the throbbing in my head worse.I put my hand to my head feeling woozy. “No, no” I told myself  “Give him a chance maybe he’s just messy. I mean who isn’t” I straightened myself out putting a smile on my face. I’ve been through worse. I can handle it. 

 We sat awkwardly watching some sort of anime. I notice there’s some pizza an the coffee table but it was cold and flies eagerly flew around and on it. I guess he noticed me looking at it because he promptly got up and closed the lid. 

“Sorry I forgot I left this out, your not hungry right?” He asked obviously expecting me to say no. I let him know I had already ate and watched as he got up to put it away. When he came back he sat closer to me this time. He smelled musty, like he hadn’t showered since this morning and covered it up with body spray. As we talked I realized how often his eyes drifted down to my chest and how his sweaty hands kept “accidentally” rubbing on my thighs I rolled my eyes internally, moving over slightly trying to not make it obvious. 

 “So what do you like to do” I asked awkwardly. He grinned and looked me up and down again “I make body art.” He droned on, I started feeling further and further away from my body. His words became muffled and slow like pressing down on a vinyl. I felt the twinge of static in the air. “You know, I wouldn't mind us turning your body into a painting.” He says leaning in to kiss me. I tried to back up, I couldn’t there was nowhere for me to go.
  
 This was wrong this was all wrong. This wasn’t how tonight was supposed to go. My senses went into overdrive when he kissed me. It was like I was shot out my body. I heard a thousand thoughts echoing through my head all in her voice. My mom wouldn’t want this for me. Mre imprtantly I don’t want this for me. Then I heard a familiar melody came from the tv. 

“I love you baby and if its quite all right ill love you baby trust in me when I say ” sang my mom

 I look over to the tv and see the same statue I saw in the park. The same one that was in my room. Mothers face. The image flurried in back and forth its features converging into one. But one thing remained. The one thing I could never get rid off. That fucking scowl, I felt my body start shaking.A heat rushed over me like that night at the park, I couldn’t push Jason off me, he was too heavy, and I couldn’t look away from the tv. It was all too much. I felt like I was being pushed out my body as I began felt my mind break. Cracking unto little pieces just like that  fucking mirror. the volume on the tv seemed to raise as her voice carried through. If Jason noticed it he didnt mention it as his sloppy wet lips kept attacking mine.

Jason got off me once he noticed my shaking. I felt a hot liquid trickle down my nose. Jason was freaking out I couldn’t hear him but I could see him moving around frantically. He ran out the room and to the kitchen area. Everything goes quiet. Pure silence. I felt disconnect, like a passenger in my own body. I knew I wasn’t in control. My brain felt crowded. Thoughts, memories, song, emotionss. That damn song. They had nowhere to go as they became a jumbled mess in my mind.

 I was a passenger in my own body. I slowly realized I had no control of my limbs, I felt numb all over. I began to sit up following him to the kitchen. I moved silently like I was floating through air. I watched as I creeped into the kitchen, his back was turned to me as he called 911, he spoke in a panicked tone . I didn't make a sound as I picked up his cast iron from the counter, I mealy felt it in my hand as I raised it over and whacked him the back of the head until he passed out. He fell with aloud thud. When I looked back up I looked up and saw the statue of my mother. Her mouth which now hung at an unnatural angle unmoving as she spoke“This is for your own good”. 

 “Help!!” Jason screamed from the other room. For the past hour it felt like I’d everything that had happened was a vague hallucination. Like I was sleepwalking with my eyes open. He sat in his living room tied to a chair. “Hey Kristen, please, come on, let me go I promise this will stay between us, I won’t tell anyone” he said pleadingly. I knew I should feel bad but I didn't. I felt nothing.I didn't even care he’d called me the wrong name. I just watched as my body stared a deep set scowl on my face. I watched myself stand up and walk over to him. His eyes trailed after my movements “It seems our time has come to and end” I said, but the voice that spoke. It wasn’t mine. It was stern and commanding like…. Like my mothers.

 I felt like a puppet as I was forced to speak, every word painfully yanked out of my mouth. I pulled out my phone , it was connected the the speaker. “You know I can’t seem to get this song out of my head… its my favorite” She said as she pressed play. The words sounded unnatural coming from my throat. It sounded fake, like a voice filter . Jasons face was pale and nervous. “Pease just stop, what did I do” my body turned to look at him “You didn't do anything, but you would’ve…if I didn't take it into my own hands” every word sounded unnatural coming from my lips.

 Everything felt dreamlike as I watched myself raise the volume on my phone. I walked around him pulling his head back, prying his mouth open and stuffing a crusty old sock in his mouth. I heard him gag at the taste.

 I stepped away for a moment, making my way back to the kitchen. As a pot boiled on the stove. I don’t even remember her doing this. The smell of cleaning products filled the air. The memory of Saturday morning cleanings came to my head except the smell was so potent it as making my eyes tear, I felt my arm being guided to grab the pot. I walked back to the living room pot in hand. the metal made my skin blister as it burned my skin. I didn't care. I barely felt it anyways. He was crying by this point tears and snot streamed down his face, watching my every movement. Choked muffled sobs rang in the air but I could barely make it out though the loud music. He looked so helpless.

 She used my arm to push a funnel into his mouth moving the sock to the side of his cheek. Putting a soup ladle into the concoction, I began to pour the boiling hot liquid down his throat, He tried to scream but it came to more as a gurgle. He had no choice but to swallow as I force fed him. He squirmed and writhed in the chair as watched the steam begin coming out his mouth, but that wasn’t enough.  She made me keep pouring the boiling hot liquid down his throat. His body shaking now his knuckles turning white from gripping the chair so hard. With every spoonful I felt my self start to smile, My hand being pushed back into the pot, boiling him alive from the inside but I don’t stop. I couldn't stop. I watched on until he was not able to make another sound, until his face was blue when, until I saw the light leave his eyes. 

  A warmth ran out my body and its like everything was in focus again, that hazy feeling was gone. All my emotions came crashing down at once. I looked at my hand and the skin was basically gone some of it had melted onto the pot and peeled off as I withdrew my hand. I was in control again.

  I looked at Jason and my heart dropped to my ass. I looked at his dead body. My shaking hand covers my mouth. Reality dawns on me as I realized what happened. The air felt cold, I felt like id just been punched in the stomach. I looked around grabbing my things and running out his apartment. 

 I heard the song trailing after me as I ran down to my apartment, quickly grabbing my first aid kit and wrapping up my hand. Then I grabbed all the important things money, passport, extra clothes. I ran out the building and to my car quickly turning the key and driving off. Red and blue flashing light drove past me as I left.
 I drove in silence for what felt like hours before I decided to head the out of town. As I arrived to the outskirts of town the radio switched on. That goddamn song again. I turned off the radio but it switched on again this time blaring through my speakers. The radio jumped through different stations that played the same song. I. LOVE. YOU. BABY. I heard my my mothers voice say through the speakers. It took me by surprise when I looked down at the radio and realized it was never on. I felt my tears fill my eyes. Im losing it, I’m fucking loosing it, I screamed banging my hands on the steering wheel pain shooting up my arm. I looked down at it for a moment.When I look back up at the road I see it. The statue except this time its at its full size, still wearing my mothers face it features shifting so fast it was hard to recognize what I was looking it. Before I could hit the brakes I crashed into it. Pieces of debris flew all around me as my moms voice echoed through my head “this is for your own good”.

 When I woke up I was in Aaron Williams memorial hospital surrounded by officers and a few broken bones, and yet even as I sit here in a room full of people I know I’m still being watched, still being monitored, a nurse said there was gift left for me pointing to the bedside table. Someone brought me a small angel figureine…. Who I look at it I see my mother. I remember that night at the park and remember Jason.

I’m a 27-year-old fit guy who’s been training consistently for years, and lately I’ve been wanting something deeper than just random gym interactions or surface-level convos. I’m looking for a real gymbro — not just someone to lift with, but someone I can build an actual friendship with.
A dude who’s disciplined, respectful, consistent, and values loyalty and growth — both in and out of the gym.

I want a training partner who shows up, pushes hard, supports, motivates, and keeps things real. Someone who understands that consistency isn’t just about lifting weights, it’s also about showing up for the people you care about. I don’t care if you’re a beast or still getting started — what matters more to me is mindset, discipline, character, and the willingness to improve.

I’m the type of guy who enjoys deep conversations, long sessions, post-workout coffee, sharing goals, and keeping each other accountable. I’m not here for temporary or flaky connections — I want a gymbro who turns into a long-term friend.
Someone who values respect, ambition, and that “we grow together” mentality.

If you’re the kind of guy who trains hard, communicates honestly, likes to laugh, chill, talk about life, fitness, goals, work, discipline — or just wants someone solid to rely on — then we’d probably vibe really well.

If you’re down for a genuine connection, long-term gym partnership, and real bro energy, feel free to hit me up. dm mr
Let’s see if we click — and hopefully start something consistent, motivating, and actually meaningful.

My partner has a problem cleaning up after herself. She leaves yogurts with the spoon still in it on the couch and will walk away of course tipping the yogurt and spilling on the couch 

Same thing goes with coffee cups with still a little coffee in it. Just leaves it on the couch cushion and walks off. 

Jackets, shoes and keys get dropped wherever she decides to drop them and to be honest I am absolutely sick of cleaning up after this person. 

Now we have a coffee machine we use every morning and of course I’m the one that cleans it every few days and after asking a few times to also clean the machine it would just never happen. 

So without saying a word I just got myself a plunger and a coffee grinder and started making my own coffee. 

Every couple of days the machine will fill right up to the top with dirty coffee water in the tray forcing her to take it out and walk (a bit of a distance to be honest) to the kitchen spilling the dirty water everywhere every time.

So now while I’m sipping my coffee in the morning I get to watch her do this dance every few days to the kitchen and get really angry everytime. 

She has never realised I did this on purpose neither has she ever just cleaned the machine earlier saving her the big spills everytime and it’s quite hilarious

1phc1yl,https://i.redd.it/11xxuilkcz5g1.jpeg,There’s Something Under the Boardwalk - Part I,"If you're reading this, it's because I have no other choice. Nobody will listen to me, not even the police. It's only a matter of time before they come for me, and when they do, this is the only evidence of the truth. There is something under the boardwalk in Paradise Point, and it's hungry.

October is always a terribly slow month. We're barely open, but the owners want to squeeze every penny they can before this town is completely 
empty. Even on a Friday night, it's already a ghost town. That's where this all began, a cold, deafeningly quiet night at the record shop I spend my days working in.

""Spectre's: Records & Rarities""; a store that really was dead in the water until vinyl made a huge comeback. We also sold shirts that you might find a middle schooler wearing, even though they wouldn't be able to name a single song off the album they're donning. It really was a place frozen in time, the smell of dust and the decay of better days always filled the room.

The best way to pass the time on a night like this would be to find a forgotten record to play. That was my favorite game, finding an album I'd never heard of and giving it a chance to win me over. After all, if I'm not going to play them, who will?

Tonight's choice: ""Secret Treaties"" by Blue Öyster Cult. Of course, I knew ""Don't Fear the Reaper"", who doesn't? I never sat down and listened to their albums, even though their logo and album artwork always intrigued me. I retired the familiar sounds of ELO off the turntable and introduced it to something new. 

Seeing the album made me think of my dad. I remember him telling me about seeing them live with Uriah Heep at the old Spectrum in the 70's. I bet he still had the ticket stub, too. God, he loved that place. I even remember seeing him shed a tear the day they tore it down.

The opening chords of ""Career of Evil"" blared out of my store speakers as I dropped the needle. Had my mind not been elsewhere, I wouldn't have startled myself into spilling my coffee. The previously white album cover and sleeve were now browned and tainted. Who would want it now? Looks like it was coming home with me. After all, a song titled ""Harvester of Eyes"" certainly had a place in my collection. The owner wouldn't care anyway, he had jokingly threatened to set the store ablaze for insurance money. Had this shop not been attached to others on this boardwalk, I wouldn't have put it past him.

The opening track sold me, and given the state of business, I decided it was time to close up shop. The only thing louder than BÖC was the ticking clock that sat above an old ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" poster. Just as the second track reached its finale, I lifted the needle. I retrieved one of our spare plastic sleeves to prevent any more damage and stowed it away in my backpack.

I took a walk outside to see if there were any stragglers roaming the boards. All I could see was a long and winding road of half-closed shops and stiffened carnival rides lit only by the amber sky of an autumn evening. Soon it would be dark, and the boardwalk would belong to the night and all that inhabited it.

The garage doors of the shop slammed shut with a finality that reminded me of the months to come. The sound echoed around me, only to be consumed by the wind. It wasn't nearly as brutal as the gusty winter months, but it swirled with the open spaces as if it were dancing with the night. The padlock clicked as I scrambled the combination, and I turned to greet the darkness that painted over the beach. Summer was truly over now.

The soundtrack of carnival rides, laughter, and stampeding feet was replaced with the moans of hardwood under my feet. Each step felt like I was disturbing somebody's grave. That was the reality of this place, four months out of the year, it's so full of life that it's overwhelming. The rest of its time is spent as a graveyard that is hardly visited. Maybe that's why I never left. If I don't visit, who will?

Speaking of visiting, this was the point of my trek home that I saw Bane. They called him that because he was a rather large man, built like a hulking supervillain. In reality, he was as soft as a teddy bear but, unfortunately, homeless. Even from the distance I saw him, which was two blocks away, there was no mistaking him. I only ever saw him sparingly; he never stayed in the same place for long and often slept under the boardwalk. I often thought he was self-conscious of his stature and didn't want to scare people.

I could see that he must have been taking in the same swirling twilight sky I had seen earlier. Now, he was merely entertaining the stars. Looking to my left, I saw that Vincent's Pizzeria was closing up shop. They must have had a better run of business than I did.

I slinked over to the counter to see a solitary slice looking for a home in the display case. The girl working the counter had her back to me, and as I began to make an attempt for her attention, she screamed.

""Oh my god! You scared me!"" she gasped.

Chuckling nervously, I apologized. ""I'm sorry, I just wanted to grab that slice before you closed up.""

I made an honest try at a friendly smile, and she laughed.

""Sure, sure. Three bucks.""

As she threw the slice in the oven to warm it up, she turned her attention back to me. ""So, any plans tonight?""

I thought about it, and I really didn't have any. I knew my ritual at this point, work and then visit Mick's for a drink or two until I've had enough to put me to sleep.

""I was going to head over to Mick's, maybe catch the game for a bit.""

She grinned. ""I know Mick's, right around the corner, yeah? Maybe I'll stop by. There isn't much else to do on a night like tonight.""

I handed her a five and signaled to her to keep the change.

""Maybe I'll see you there,"" I said half-heartedly, giving one last smile as I departed.

She waved, and I focused my attention on the walk ahead. She seemed plenty nice, might be nice to interact with someone. First, I had something I wanted to do.

Bane was right where I last saw him, except now he was gathering his things. I approached him with some haste.

""Hey bud, I haven't seen you in a while.""

When he turned to see it was me, a smile grew across his face. ""Hey Mac, long time.""

In my patented awkward fashion, I continued. ""It's been dead out here, huh?""

Without looking up, he lamented, ""Sure has. It's that time of year. Certainly not going to miss it.""

Puzzled, I pressed him. ""What do you mean?""

Once he finished packing his bag, he sighed and his baritone voice continued. ""I need to get some help. I'm going to go to that place in Somerdale and finally get myself clean.""

He sounded so absolute in what he was saying. I couldn't have been happier.

""That's great, man! I'd give you a ride myself if I had a car.""

I chuckled, that really did make my night.

He took another deep breath. ""I just need to see her again.""

He revealed a small photo in his pocket, presenting it in his large hands. The picture showed a newborn baby girl in the hands of the man in front of me.

""I haven't really seen her since she was born. Once I lost my job and... everything just started falling apart..."" he trailed off.

He shook it off to say, ""I'm just ready. Tonight's my last night, I have my bus ticket ready to go, first thing in the morning. I just thought I would take in one last sunset and say goodbye to the others. I saved enough money to get me one night at The Eagle Nest.""

I was hard-pressed to find words. I didn't know he had a daughter. It was a lot to take in, but above all, I was so thrilled to hear what he was setting off to do.

Remembering what I had in my hands, I spoke up. ""Vincent's was closing up, and I thought you could use a bite. Since this is going to be the last time I'll see you, I won't take no for an answer.""

We both smirked. He reached up for the quickly cooling slice of pizza.

""That's really nice of you, Mac. I appreciate it.""

Not sure what else to do, I shot my hand forward to him for a shake. ""I really think what you're doing is great. It's been nice knowing you.""

He reached his enormous paw to mine and shook it. ""You too. I'd say I'll see you again, but I really hope it's not here.""

He chuckled as he swung his bag onto his back. I smiled back and waved goodbye. As we made our separate ways, a question occurred to me.

""Hey, what's your real name, by the way? Maybe I'll look you up someday to see how you're doing.""

Without turning fully around, he said, ""It doesn't really matter.""

With that, he retreated into the night and left me to wonder what he meant by that.

I was soon reaching the block where Mick's resides. The pub was right off the boardwalk, the neon lights that illuminated nearby were shining across the face of The Mighty King Kong ride. Thankfully, my work and home were all within a short walk of one another. Mick's served as the ever-so-convenient median between the two. Mick's was also where I picked up shifts in the offseason. They must have noticed the frequency with which I visited and decided to offer me a job. It was a solid gig, Mick's was one of the few year-round places on the island. Locals gravitated toward it once the summer crowds dissipated. If I was going to spend my time there, I figured I might as well get paid.

Just as I was rounding the corner to the off-ramp, something happened. A loose board that hugged the wall greeted my sneaker and sent me tumbling down. All this tourism revenue, and this damn boardwalk is still old enough for Medicare.

I turned over onto my side to see where my backpack had landed. It was adjacent to the culprit. I groaned as I reached over to grab it, when something caught my eye.

Along the wall, hiding just below the wood, I saw what looked like a wasp's nest. It was peeking out from the dark at me, almost as if it was watching me. I peered at it with the light of the pub guiding me.

This wasn't a wasp's nest.

It was a sickly pale yellow. Its texture looked wet, almost as if it was hot candle wax burning from a flame. Maybe the fall had disoriented me, but I could swear I saw it moving, rising and falling ever so subtly. Like it was... breathing?

I adjusted my eyes as I leaned in. It wasn't very big, maybe the size of a tennis ball. It was riddled with holes, craters that left very little room for much else. I couldn't help but glare at them.

Then it happened.

They blinked at me.

I inherited this coffee table from my grandmother, and two tiles have fallen off. I still have them, and they're currently just lying loose in place (see last picture). The grout is generally looking quite old, is gone in some places, and the tiles are all sitting a bit unevenly/not level.

How do I properly restore this table?

I think some hide glue might have been used originally, though I'm not sure. I imagine I might need to remove all the tiles, clean the surface underneath and make sure it's level before I reattach the tiles - what do you recommend?

I'd also love to clean the tiles a bit of their discoloration if possible, but am not sure how to do this. Any recommendations? I don't want it to look completely new or anything, I love the history visible in the table still. I just want to give it new life in my new home. 

I'm planning to sand and oil/wax the wood, but am not sure of the order I should go about things. I imagine removing all tiles, cleaning and sanding, then oil/wax the wood, then attach tiles and grout?

I’ve never had to properly date before after meeting my ex online, so I’m not exactly knowledgeable or confident.

I met this girl on bumble and she’s really sweet. We went on a first date to get coffee and food which I think went really well, she was laughing a lot and gave me lots of compliments, and we were there for maybe 3 hours.

She said she wanted to see me again after asking me for my opinion. I said I’d happily see her again but was probably going to take things slow. (We’re both looking for something long term)

I walked her back to her car, and then gave her a hug. She said it was a terrible hug (it was 😂), so asked for another. She said that one was better and then asked to hug like 3 more times. When I got home she messaged that she had a really nice time, and when we actually hugged properly it felt nice. We called for almost an hour the day after and text a lot.

She already asked for us to meet again, just 2 days after the first date (today), but cancelled in the morning saying she wasn’t feel well but we could reschedule.

I’ve spoke to her over text and she still seems interested, and said “I hope you enjoy speaking to me as much as I enjoy speaking to you x”. And now she’s invited me over to her house on Wednesday while being really flirty. If it does end up happening, I’ve never been in this situation before, being in another girls house that I’m not in a relationship with…

Im not actually sure what we’ll do there but maybe watch something or go on a dog walk. I guess my question is should I put my arm around her or even ask her if I can kiss her? Will she be expecting me to make a move?

1phbx17,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1phbx17/im_the_only_person_they_rescued_from_that_island/,"I'm the Only Person They Rescued From That Island, but Not the Only Thing They Brought Back","The first thing I remember is the taste of saltwater and blood. I awoke to the sensation of one flowing in through my helplessly ajar mouth while the other escaped from the fresh lacerations along my throbbing tongue. As the water entered my chest I felt my lungs begin to burn, and I quickly forgot all about the bloody ache in my mouth. 

Powerful, eager waves, fresh from the depths of Poseidon's briny maw, tossed my limp, useless body like an angry child throws around their doll moments before getting placed in time-out, the key difference being that the Lord of the Ocean faces no such punishment for flexing his mighty influence. My arms and legs flailed wildly as my body tumbled through the water, no longer bound to any whim of my own, but to the suggestion of Poseidon’s Earthshaking tantrum. If my brain could have properly functioned in all of that chaos, I would have thought he meant to play with me until the end of time; evidently, though, he grew bored of our game, something I learned in the form of crashing pain as my back slammed against a hard, sandy shore.

The blow knocked me unconscious again for another moment, and when I came-to, Poseidon, his energy reinvigorated, was already using the mighty tide to pull me back into his domain. In an act of blasphemous defiance, I quickly flipped myself onto my knees, hacking up seawater as I did, and crawled with all of my strength up that length of sand. My clothes felt weighed down by iron and my body, weakened by my recent ordeal, was on the verge of collapse. Harsh, stinging rain lashed across my face as the wind screamed in my ears, telling me to give up, it would all be so much easier if I would just give up. I was certain the raging tide was going to defeat me, but I somehow managed to fight against it long enough to finally escape its grasp. Once free, I crawled another few yards up the beach before I tumbled onto my side in a state of unrivaled exhaustion.

I closed my eyes for only a moment — not much longer than a blink — and when I opened them again, the storm had mostly passed. Rain still struck down upon me from the cloudy nighttime sky, but it had largely abated from its early fury, and the raging waves and tide had also grown more placid. The wind no longer howled terrible suggestions into my ear, and the curtain of clouds above broke up just slightly enough to allow some azure moonlight to slip down from the peaceful firmament.

I forced myself into a sitting position, a task made almost impossibly difficult due to the weight of my soaked clothes, though my brief siesta seemed to have given my body back some of its strength (though it had done little for the raging headache that now dominated the space within my skull). Looking around, I found myself on a long stretch of beach. The vast ocean, like onyx glass in the blackness of night, extended before me in one direction; in all others was only shadow and sand.

Disoriented, thirsty, and shivering with the cold, I struggled to gather my thoughts while I sat on that frigid stretch of lonely beach. I couldn’t remember how I had ended up in Poseidon’s playground. The only thing I knew was that I couldn’t stay there on that beach, exposed to the rain and the chill. I needed to find shelter as soon as possible; regaining my bearings would come afterward. With this in mind, and suddenly warmed by a fresh determination to escape the elements, I forced my protesting body to its feet. I was immediately hit by a wave of nausea that I was sure would lead to vomiting. My suspicion was quickly proven correct, as I soon found myself doubled over, bile and brine escaping from my open mouth. When my expulsion was over, I stood panting for several long seconds before attempting to spit excess vomit into the sand. My mouth, however, was too dry to conjure any saliva for the wanted action, and so the taste of puke remained. After giving myself a few moments to recover, I took a cautious step forward along the beach. My body screamed with a thousand years of ache, and my legs felt like melted jelly, but I thankfully didn’t seem to be seriously injured. I was lucky; much more lucky than I even realized at the time.

I only made it a few steps along the beach before I noticed the body.

It appeared so suddenly from out of the darkness, seeming to materialize from the very essence of the gloom itself. At first it looked like it may have been an outcropping of rocks, or maybe even a jumble of seaweed, but after a few moments, its true identity became known to me. I scrambled toward the crumpled form with as much haste as I could, clumsily falling to a knee when I reached it. It was lying on the beach with its back to the sky, its face in the cold, wet sand. I reached a pruny hand toward its soggy shoulder and shook it with what strength I could gather.

“Hey!” I said. “Hey, wake up!”

When the figure didn’t respond, I decided to flip it onto its back. Upon doing so, I immediately realized two things. The first was that this person, judging by their clothes, was the pilot. The second was that they were dead. I reeled away from the corpse in a sudden tempest of shock and disgust. The body’s vacant, watery eyes seemed to follow me as I went; they bulged out of the corpse’s bloated head in a way that seemed like they were trying to escape from their home.

I was only able to recognize the pilot from their uniform; I never would have been able to identify them based on the state of their corpse, which had already been ravaged by death and the sea in such a relatively short time. The presence of the dead pilot, while disturbing and tragic, at the very least helped me to settle my swimming mind. I remembered that I had been on a last-minute red-eye flight that was on its way over the Atlantic when we suddenly hit a particularly rough patch of turbulence. This apparently wasn’t too much to be concerned about, as the pilot — the same one now lying dead in front of me — hadn’t seemed worried at all when announcing the possibility of a slightly bumpy flight.

That was before the storm appeared.

I returned to my feet and looked back in the direction of the ocean’s maw, searching for something — the sinking wreckage; some supplies floating in the angry surf; a deployed lifeboat, maybe — but all I could see was more black. It was as if my entire world had been reduced to the inside of an inkwell, in which I was confined for all eternity. Never have I feared the terrible might of the ocean as much as I did in that moment, in the midst of that lashing rain, beneath the alien darkness of the nighttime sky. 

I suddenly heard a voice calling to me, sounding very far away. I likely wouldn't have even heard it had the storm still been at its worst.

I followed the voice with my eyes. Approaching me from farther along the beach was a young woman, who staggered toward me with all the grace and speed that her worn, soaking body could muster. When she finally reached me, she was drained of her energy, and was reduced to heavy panting that prevented her from speaking for some time. 

“Are you alright?” I asked her, then realized I could provide a more apt question: “Are you hurt?”

She shook her head, then, finally catching her breath, said, “No, but I need your help. There's a man over here who can't stand. I think he has a broken leg.”

“Where is he?”

“There.” She pointed toward the darkness that she had just emerged from, and I immediately understood that I had asked another foolish question. “I can't lift him by myself. Please, I need your help!”

The woman turned and made her way back in the direction from which she had come. I prepared to follow after, but, remembering my original purpose for stopping there, offered one final glance at the body of the pilot. Where was once a corpse, now was only sand. The body of the pilot was gone.

The woman yelled for me to hurry, knocking away any shock that I might have felt at discovering the pilot’s absence. Brushing aside any hesitance, I followed her into the shadows, both of us struggling to make our way along the beach, until we came across another figure lying on the sand. For a moment I thought back to the dead pilot, but the pit this memory formed in my stomach was immediately dispelled when this new figure began to move. He groaned in his agony as he turned to look at me, his face awash with the anguish of his apparent injury.

“Oh, thank God!” he said. “Please, help me! Get me out of here!”

“It's going to be alright, sir,” I said, not knowing if that was true. “Where are you hurt?”

“My legs!” He yelled. “My fucking *legs*!”

“Alright,” I said. “We're going to help you, but we need to get you out of this rain first.”

“There's a cave nearby,” the woman said. “I saw it further inland. We can take him there.”

“Alright,” I said. “Then we need to move now. I’ll get him, you just lead us to that cave.”

I positioned myself behind the agonized man and wrapped either arm beneath his armpits and up over his shoulders. After signifying to the woman that I was ready, we began our trek through the darkness, her leading the way while I, walking backwards, dragged our companion through the sand. Soon the terrain became more rough as sand transitioned to less agreeable surfaces, and the sounds of his pain began. He groaned and yelled as I dragged his ruinous body across stones and branches and sharp thorns. Our trek seemed to go on for hours, during which my own heavy, exhausted body begged for me to abandon my charge and leave the man to his fate. I barely remember reaching the cave, which seemed to spring up out of the gloom like a waiting tombstone. Once inside, I placed the injured man against one of the cool earthen walls. The relief of losing my burden overwhelmed me so greatly that I too collapsed to the cave floor, my strength completely lost. I intended to only lie there for a brief moment while I recovered some of my energy, but soon the exhaustion that had overtaken me grew far too powerful, and I once again fell unconscious, my mind as dark as the surrounding cave.

I awoke to the sound and heat of a crackling fire. I enjoyed its warmth, though inside I possessed a chill that seemingly no flame could ever chase away. When I opened my eyes, I saw the orange glow of the blaze, which rested just beyond the mouth of the cave. Sitting in front of the fire were two silhouettes; behind them was nighttime darkness. I could see twinkling white stars beyond the figures’ heads, indicating that the storm had finally ceased, but not much else.

Sitting up required the immense task of ignoring my screaming head. I looked around, taking in my surroundings while I waited for my mind to stop dancing. The chamber of the cave I was in, while appearing to be fairly small, extended beyond where the light of the fire could reach; I didn’t yet know how far it went, or what passages were hidden deep within the shadows, but the distant sound of dripping water told me that there was considerably more to the cavern than what I could see.

I forced myself to my feet, rising as high as I was able (the low roof of the cave forced me to crouch to about half of my full height) and shuffled my way toward the two figures in front of the fire. As I approached, I noticed the injured man lying near the blaze; he appeared to be unconscious, and in the flickering firelight I could see the gentle rise and fall of his chest. He had been stripped to his underwear, and I caught a glimpse of the pair of horrible bruises that covered either of his legs in huge blotches, looking like tattoos of raging hellfire.

One of the silhouettes noticed me and turned in my direction. I recognized the look of the young woman, her face dancing in the shadows produced by the blaze. She offered me a concerned smile. “You’re awake,” she said. “How are you feeling?”

“Everything hurts,” I said, “but I’m alright.” I looked at the unconscious man. “How is *he*?”

“Broken legs.” It was the other figure who talked. He was a burly-looking man with a bushy, thick beard of gray that matched the grizzle in his voice. The stranger kept his gaze on the fire as he spoke. “Both of ’em. Seems alright enough, though. Bones didn’t break skin, and no bleeding far as I could see.”

I failed to suppress a frown. “Can’t we do anything for him? Set his bones or something?”

“You a doctor?” The stranger looked at me now. His eyes were as frigid as the fire was warm. “Ever set a bone before?”

“No,” I said sheepishly, answering both questions at once.

“Setting bones without knowin’ what you’re doin’ is dangerous,” he said. “Could even be deadly.” He gestured to the young woman with his chin. “You can ask the nurse all about that.”

I looked at her. “You’re a nurse?”

“Nursing *student*,” she corrected kindly. “Only just finished my first semester. He needs more help than I’m able to provide him.”

“Then we need to get him out of here,” I said.

“You a good swimmer?” the stranger asked.

I nodded. “I’m good enough.”

He grunted in some strange affirmation. “Good enough to swim across the Atlantic with him on your back? Because that’s the only way you’re getting him off of this island.”

“How sure are you that this is even an island?” the nursing student asked.

“Sure enough,” he said. “Not much else out where we went down. But I suppose we can find out for certain in the mornin’. I’ll look around this place come daylight, try to get an idea of what we’re workin’ with here.”

I looked at the man with the broken legs. “Hopefully he even lasts that long.”

“He will,” the stranger said. His attention was back on the fire now. “Injuries don’t seem life-threatening right now. Should be alright so long as we get rescued soon enough.”

“But who knows how long *that* could take?” the nursing student asked.

“Don’t know,” he said. “We’ll just have to wait and see.”

His words were less than reassuring, but they proved to be the last we would get from him that night. The stranger stared at the blaze in silence for a short while longer, then lay down in the brush and dirt near where he sat and seemingly fell asleep, his breaths soon coming in a series of calm, relaxed snores. The nursing student and I stayed up for a while longer. The conversation between us was brief, with long gaps between words; we exchanged names (although I don’t think I ever actually registered hers) and a few other details about ourselves, but besides these few short episodes, we mostly allowed the crackling fire and the distant crashing waves to do the talking.

Eventually our conversation turned to the stranger.

“Where did he come from?” I asked, my voice dropped to a low whisper.

“I don’t know,” she said. “The storm came to a stop not long after you passed out, and then he kind of just… showed up. Didn’t even introduce himself. He helped me build the fire and brought our injured friend closer to it, where we looked him over and assessed his injuries.”

“Strange,” I said. “Where was he during the storm?”

“He hasn’t told me. In fact, he hasn’t said *anything* about himself at all. And that’s really had me thinking.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“I mean do you even remember seeing him when we boarded our plane?”

“No,” I admitted, “but I don’t remember seeing you or the injured guy, either.” I paused. “Why? Do you think he wasn’t on our plane or something? How could he possibly be here with us, then?”

“I don’t know,” she said again. “I just get the sense that he… doesn’t belong. It’s hard to explain, but I just feel a very uncomfortable energy from him.”

“Well, we’ll keep an eye on him,” I said. “He’s been helpful enough so far. Could be that he’s a little socially awkward, is all. Maybe a bit of a loner.”

“Maybe,” she said. “Maybe I’m overly exhausted and I’m just being paranoid, but something about this whole situation — this whole *place* — just feels wrong.”

“Wrong how?” I asked.

“You’ve been out cold for a little while, so maybe you just don’t feel it yet, but *I* do. I just can’t shake the feeling like we aren’t *welcome* here, like there’s something watching us from the darkness, waiting for us to let our guard down. And I can’t help but feel like *he* is a part of it.”

We both glanced in the direction of the sleeping stranger, then back to each other.

“Maybe I’ll go with him when he gets the lay of the land tomorrow,” she said. “Try to get some information out of him, see if his story checks out.”

“Let *me* go,” I said. “Our injured friend will need a medical professional to look after him.”

“I told you I’ve barely got one semester of nursing school under my belt,” she said.

I offered her a tired smile. “That’s still more experience than *I* have.”

“I guess you’re right,” she said, returning the smile. “Fine. But be careful around him, alright? There’s no telling what he’ll do when the two of you are alone together.”

She and I took turns staying on watch that night. My time spent awake, watching the darkness beyond our camp, helped me to understand what she had meant when she said that something was off about our new home. Something definitely felt sinister about the place, something that, even thinking back on it now, sends a chill racing all over my body. At the time I figured it was possible the young woman’s words had placed this sensation into my mind, but as I sat near the fire on watch, I couldn’t help but feel like there was something or some*things* watching us — watching *me* — from the heavy darkness. The nearby shore, the surrounding trees, even the depths of the cave where the water dripped into the abyss; wherever there was an absence of light, there was an abundance of eyes. And they were all turned in the same direction.

The stranger and our injured companion didn’t stir for the rest of night, until the coming of dawn when the former seemed to rise like clockwork at the first trickle of sunlight. I was on watch when he awoke; he sat up with an almost inhuman roboticness that made my skin want to crawl right off of my body. Maybe the nursing student was right, I thought. Maybe something *was* wrong with the stranger. Or maybe her paranoia had infected me too. It was difficult to tell.

The young woman and the injured man awoke shortly after, but the latter was in a state of such pain and agony that he was practically incoherent, and drifted between states of consciousness the way parts from our plane surely drifted along the surface of the nearby ocean.

The stranger didn’t speak for nearly an hour after waking. He sat in his same spot, stoking the fire and resupplying it with fresh kindling, before abruptly standing and saying, to nobody in particular: “Going to take a look around. See what I can find.”

“I’ll come with you,” I said, perhaps too quickly.

He offered me an apathetic look. “Would be able to move more quickly on my own.”

“You’re also more likely to hurt yourself and not have anybody to come help you,” the nursing student said. She knelt next to the semi-conscious injured man and felt his forehead. I could tell by her grimace that he was likely running concerningly warm, despite what his intermittent shivers would have suggested.

The stranger thought about this for a moment. “Alright. But keep up.”

I nodded, climbed to my feet with a groan, and offered the nursing student and her patient one final glance before departing into the unknown with the stranger. I had the strangest fear that I would never see either of them again. This fear was later proved to be unfounded, of course — I would still see *one* of them yet, at the very least.

I followed the stranger back to the beach, which looked so much smaller in the morning sunlight. The azure ocean, more inviting than its obsidian counterpart, was still just as imposing in its vastness as its nighttime self. Even in the light of day, it was obvious that the endless body of water could easily swallow us whole if it chose to, and I didn’t intend to give it a reason to do so. I still saw no sign of the plane wreckage, and figured it had either long-since sank to the bottom of the ocean, or had otherwise drifted beyond the gently crashing waves to a point that I could not see with my naked eye.

The stranger drew a deep line in the sand with his boot. “Gonna get an idea of how far around this island is, see if we can’t make a full loop of it in a decent time.” He started walking, not waiting for me, and I hustled to square up next to him. Each step through the heavy sand felt like trudging through a dense pool of water to my aching body, but the stranger hardly seemed to notice the extra effort. “After that, we’d best head inland and look for a water source. That’s most important of all.”

His words made me realize just how thirsty I was. The creeping pain of dehydration hurt more than any pangs of hunger that I felt. My head pounded with the absence of water; my pulpy, scabbed tongue screamed for mercy. “How long do you think we’ll be here?”

“Could be days,” he said bluntly. “Could be years.”

“*Years*?” The word felt impossible on my swollen tongue.

He nodded without looking at me. “Not every missing flight gets found. I heard about a flight filled with college students that went down over this very stretch of the Atlantic a number of years ago. They eventually had to give up the search — probably much more quickly than you’d like to know.”

I frowned at the thought, but said nothing. When the stranger realized he wouldn’t be getting a response, he went on. “If we’re going to be here for a while, then we’re going to have to trust each other. That means no scheming behind each others’ backs.”

These words brought me to a sudden halt. He did the same, and our eyes finally met. To my surprise, there was no anger in the stranger’s gaze; in fact, there didn’t appear to be much of anything there at all. “I’m good at lookin’ like I’m asleep, ain’t I?”

I waited a while to respond, not sure what to say. The words I finally chose felt weak, pathetic. “I’m sorry.”

He nodded and began walking again. I followed his lead. “For what it’s worth, I *do* remember seeing you on that flight yesterday. Can’t say the same for the other two. Doesn’t mean they weren’t there, but… Again, for what it’s worth.”

“Are you saying you think they weren’t on the flight?”

“What I mean is that we probably have more to worry about than just gettin’ food and water here,” he said. “I’ll give that girl credit, she was right about this place. Somethin’ is wrong here. I didn’t sleep a wink last night, despite what you may have thought. I was too busy keeping my ears open; too busy listening to all the strange sounds in the darkness, many of which you may have even missed. I felt that presence, felt its eyes on me. There was somethin’ out there, beyond the light of our fire. And it was watching us, make no mistake about it.”

“An animal?” I asked.

He shook his head.

We didn’t speak much after that. We completed our loop in less than thirty minutes and confirmed that we were, in fact, on an island. Besides a brief few yards where we had to walk along the thicket, the beach remained uninterrupted, allowing for a straightforward journey along our circle.

When we reached his line in the sand, the stranger stopped and looked at me. “Well, that settles that. Next we need to look for something to drink. A stream, some coconuts, anything.”

“I heard some dripping water coming from somewhere in the cave,” I said.

“I did too,” he said, “and I didn’t like the sound of it.”

He didn’t elaborate on what he meant.

We doubled back and entered a less dense section of the thicket, searching for food, water, anything that could help sustain us. It was dark beneath that heavy crown of trees; the gloom made me think of the obsidian ocean the night before. I was suddenly reminded of the dead pilot, who had once lay sprawled out in the cold, wet, sand before vanishing in an instant. I hadn’t thought back to that moment since coming to the injured man’s aid, but the memory had managed to conjure itself from the great, suffocating darkness and force its way back into my troubled mind. I considered mentioning what I had seen to the stranger, but thought better of it; to verbally recall such a wicked occurrence felt dangerous in a place such as this.

The stranger led me past tree trunks and overtop tangled roots, deeper and deeper into that arboreal labyrinth, until I could no longer see the beach through all the foliage. I tried not to show my hesitation in following the man, but in truth, I still struggled to trust him. Part of me wondered if he was luring me into that sinister collection of trees and earth so that he could do to me what he had already done to the pilot’s soaked, decaying corpse. I did my best to banish this thought, but it lingered, acting as a barrier between the stranger and me that kept me from straying too close to him. 

The world around me grew dark as the sun above us vanished. We seemed to walk for hours, though I knew this couldn’t have been possible; the island wasn’t large enough for us to penetrate its inland for longer than a quarter of an hour at most. If we kept on how we were, we’d eventually make it to the opposite beach from where we had started. I knew this to be true; it simply had to be.

Except it wasn’t.

We kept going and going for countless minutes, hours, days, never finding the other end of the thicket. Darkness further enveloped us, obscuring our vision and thus our ability to perform our task — our entire reason for entering the forest in the first place. I could barely see the stranger in front of me, his form becoming more and more obscured by shadow with each step forward. I told him we needed to turn back, to find our way out of the forest. He remained deaf to my words.

A sudden snapping of a twig stole my attention. I turned in its direction for the briefest of moments, imagining that when my gaze reached its destination, it would be greeted by some dark, sinister form lurking in the shadows. When I saw nothing but more tree trunks and blackness, I cautiously returned my attention to the man leading me through the thicket. In that brief moment, the stranger had managed to disappear.

“Sir?” I called, realizing I had never learned his name. My own voice sounded far away, muffled, as if the gloom itself were choking me. “Sir? Where are you?”

Swirling darkness. Sounds of shuffling in the brush. The growing, thickening sense that stepping into this wood was a mistake, the thought that at any moment the thing stalking me, the presence that had been watching me since the previous night, was preparing to strike. I imagined the deep, Stygian tide squirming up from the ocean and pulling the pilot into the frigid depths, and I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that those same watery tendrils were coming toward me now, winding through the trees on their way to me, ready to drag me kicking and screaming and swallowing brine back to the waiting abyss.

I grew dizzy. My vision became darker, merging with the gloom. Something was coming. Something was here.

I felt a firm hand on my shoulder. Snapping out of my own panicked bubble, I turned and saw the stranger, his stern eyes looking at me through the gloom. He had somehow gotten behind me, or I had somehow gotten ahead of him.

“This is useless,” he said. “We can’t see a damn thing in this place. Come on, let’s get out of here.”

It took us barely a minute to find our way back out to the section of beach that we had just stepped away from. Coming out into the sunshine, catching my breath and taking in that crisp ocean air, I thought that the worst of my ordeal was over.

What I didn’t realize, what I couldn’t possibly have realized, was that it was only just beginning.

I wanted to ask the stranger if he’d experienced the same overwhelming sensation that I had while in the forest, but I was afraid of his answer. As it turned out, I wouldn’t have to be the one to broach the subject. We’d only walked a handful of steps before the stranger stopped us in our tracks and looked at me. “I felt it too.”

I frowned at him. “Felt what?”

“That presence,” he said. “There, among the trees. It was the same presence that watched us all through the night. There’s evil on this island with us; this much I believe without a shadow of a doubt.”

“What do you think it is?”

“I haven’t a clue,” he said, “and I’m not sure I want to know.”

The camp was deserted, the fire in shambles. A few long, smoldering branches scattered about the place were all that remained of the blaze, save for the pitiful smoke which billowed up from the gray ashes in the center of the old pit. The nursing student was gone, and, even more strangely, so was the injured man.

I called out for our lost companions, but received no response.

“What happened here?” I said. “Where could they have gone?”

The stranger, who stood closer to the mouth of the cave, looked deep into the darkness of the cavern. I stepped closer and followed his gaze. Though the black curtain beyond the mouth was impenetrable by human eyes, my ears caught the sound of a distant, familiar voice, one screaming in agony over his broken legs.

“How’d he get in there?” I asked.

“How else does a man with two broken legs get anywhere?” he said. “He certainly didn’t move there himself.”

“You mean *it* took him there?” I said.

He nodded. “And I think it’ll take *us* too, if we let it.”

I looked into the darkness of the cave, then back to my companion. “We have to go help him.”

“Nothing we can do for him now,” the stranger said. “That thing *wants* you to go after him so it can get you alone too. Then you’ll end up just like him.”

I listened to the injured man’s cries of agony continuing to echo from somewhere deep within the cave. “But we can’t just leave him in there!”

“We can,” the stranger said. “Hell, I doubt if that’s even his real voice.” He picked up one of the smoldering branches. “That poor fella is likely already gone by now.”

“What are you going to do with that?”

“Only thing I *can* do now,” he said. “Gonna burn this whole place to the ground and pray that the fire is enough to purge the evil that rots here. Or at the very least keeps it contained to that cave.”

I looked at him, then once again turned my eyes back at the wailing cave. After another moment I picked up one of the smoldering branches and turned toward the cavern’s waiting lips. “I have to go after him.”

“You’ll die,” the stranger said plainly. “Die or worse. But I won’t stop you.”

These were the last words I ever heard from him. Without looking back, I blew on my smoldering branch in order to reignite some of its flame, ducked into the shallow mouth of the cave, and allowed the darkness to take me.

My makeshift torch did little to light the way ahead, and so I was forced to use the injured man’s agonized cries to guide me through the squirming, smothering darkness. I thought about the presence. How long had it been on this island? Centuries? Eternities? Since time immemorial, just waiting for poor castaways like us to arrive on its demonic shores? I couldn’t ever know, nor was I sure I even wanted to.

I understood that the stranger was right about this most likely being a trap. I was almost certainly shuffling toward my own death, but I couldn’t bring myself to turn back around. I had to know for sure whether the injured man was down there; if I abandoned him without knowing the truth, it would have haunted me for the rest of my life— as long or as short as that was meant to be.

The injured man’s voice came from everywhere and nowhere. Sometimes it seemed to suddenly grow louder, then just as quickly fade away. Soon it disappeared entirely, replaced by the sound of dripping water, which was itself replaced by the sound of a small, flowing stream. By now I was certain that the injured man wasn’t actually down there, but I couldn’t turn back. The presence was guiding me forward; the only reason it allowed me to continue on was because I was choosing to bend to its whim. To defy it would surely only bring about my premature doom.

I saw the stream of water, which looked to flow from out of a nearby wall only to quickly disappear beyond my torch’s glow, back into the waiting gloom. A silhouette crouched there, greedily drinking from the stream. As I drew within arm’s length of the running water, I realized that the silhouette had become — or it always *was* — my own shadow, doing what I so desperately wished I could do. I suddenly forgot all about the injured man, and his agonized cries. I forgot about wanting to leave that cave, about wanting to go home. All I could focus on was the insatiable desire to quench my thirst.

The cool, rushing water beckoned my parched lips, sang to my crumbling tongue like a siren. I leaned closer, answering its sweet call, until I could feel its racing chill right in front of my face. All I had to do was lean just a little bit farther.

But then I stopped. Something inside of me, something small but mighty, told me that I couldn’t drink that water. It told me that I needed to get as far away from that stream as I possibly could. Heeding this inner voice, I sat up, pulling my face away from the stream with great, almost insurmountable difficulty.

Only to have it shoved back down, directly into the rushing deluge.

The torch fell from my grip as my face slammed into the earthen surface beneath the waiting water. I heard the nursing student’s whispering voice in my ear, telling me to open my mouth, to suckle from the vitality of the stream. I fought to keep my dry, crackled lips shut against the antagonizing flow for as long as I could, but soon the voice’s suggestion, or maybe even my own, forced those same lips open, and allowed the water to enter me freely. Its cool, soothing touch ran over my teeth and embraced my aching tongue. I sat there, my face pressed against the stream, for close to thirty seconds, sure that my fate was to drown there in the dark, my body no longer my own.

But then I felt the pressure against my skull lessen, and I managed to pull away. I sat there, soaking wet and gasping, for only a few short moments before I snatched up my torch, still barely alive with its red glow, and rushed away from the stream, back in the direction that I thought I had come from. I heard the woman’s voice telling me to wait, but I ignored her. I just kept going, kept fighting my way through the dark, slicing through the shadows with my torch like a scythe through wheat.

It was already dusk when I finally emerged from the cave. Hours somehow had passed while I was deep within the bowels of the island. I stood up and rushed past the remnants of the fire, calling for the stranger, asking him where he was. It wasn’t until I found his own branch lying in the brush, no longer smoldering but dead and cold, that I understood his fate.

And yet still I called for him. “Sir!” I said. “Where are you?!”

“Gone.”

I turned around at the sound of the nursing student’s voice. She was in the mouth of the cave, her body having found a way to stand fully upright despite the aperture only providing enough space for her to crouch. When she saw that I saw her, she smiled kindly at me. “Or perhaps he was never there to begin with.”

I stared at her for several long seconds. I had so many burning questions that I wanted to ask her, but no voice with which to ask them, and so I remembered some of the stranger’s final words and did the only thing I thought I could: I threw my torch into the nearby brush, and I watched the fresh blaze grow.

I looked back at the nursing student. I expected her to recoil back into the cave, cursing in some ancient, furious language as the inferno began to consume the surrounding foliage. Instead, she just looked at me and continued to smile. It wasn’t a sinister smile; her lips didn’t curl away from impossibly long, sharp fangs, or twist into a devastating smirk. It was the subtle, close-lipped smile that you offer a stranger who you lock eyes with while you both wait for your drink at a coffee shop. At the time, I didn’t understand what she had to smile about, but I do now.

She was smiling because she had won.



The island was swallowed by the flame. Its bright blaze attracted the attention of a nearby fishing barge, which made its way to the unintended beacon, thus coming to my rescue. I stood on the ship watching the island disappear behind us, its all-consuming inferno visible for hours before finally falling out of sight.

The authorities found no sign of anybody else surviving that plane crash. As far as they understood it, I was the only person to make it to that island alive. An act of God, they said. I might have called it something else.

With great difficulty I returned to my normal life, and in the coming weeks, I thought that everything had gone back to how it was supposed to be. I thought I was free from whatever it was that tormented me on that island. I thought it was gone forever.

But I was wrong.

I started feeling that presence — that *evil* — rising up inside of me just a few days ago. It whispers in my ear while I try to sleep, torments me in my dreams. I had thought I’d escaped its terrible grasp, but I realize now that it had purposely let me go.

It had let me go because it knew I was taking it with me.

I can’t help but think it would have been better if I had died in that plane crash. Had I simply perished like all the others, the presence would still be trapped on that island. It haunts me even now, as I struggle to write these final words. I feel it slithering down my throat and coiling in my stomach like some otherworldly parasite, or like a cold, flowing stream of water. Thanks to me, the presence from the island has escaped from its eternal prison. It’s inside of me now.

And I don’t think it intends to stay there for long.

I awoke to the sensation of one flowing in through my helplessly ajar mouth while the other escaped from the fresh lacerations along my throbbing tongue. As the water entered my chest I felt my lungs begin to burn, and I quickly forgot all about the bloody ache in my mouth. 

Powerful, eager waves, fresh from the depths of Poseidon's briny maw, tossed my limp, useless body like an angry child throws around their doll moments before getting placed in time-out, the key difference being that the Lord of the Ocean faces no such punishment for flexing his mighty influence. My arms and legs flailed wildly as my body tumbled through the water, no longer bound to any whim of my own, but to the suggestion of Poseidon’s Earthshaking tantrum. If my brain could have properly functioned in all of that chaos, I would have thought he meant to play with me until the end of time; evidently, though, he grew bored of our game, something I learned in the form of crashing pain as my back slammed against a hard, sandy shore.

The blow knocked me unconscious again for another moment, and when I came-to, Poseidon, his energy reinvigorated, was already using the mighty tide to pull me back into his domain. In an act of blasphemous defiance, I quickly flipped myself onto my knees, hacking up seawater as I did, and crawled with all of my strength up that length of sand. My clothes felt weighed down by iron and my body, weakened by my recent ordeal, was on the verge of collapse. Harsh, stinging rain lashed across my face as the wind screamed in my ears, telling me to give up, it would all be so much easier if I would just give up. I was certain the raging tide was going to defeat me, but I somehow managed to fight against it long enough to finally escape its grasp. Once free, I crawled another few yards up the beach before I tumbled onto my side in a state of unrivaled exhaustion.

I closed my eyes for only a moment — not much longer than a blink — and when I opened them again, the storm had mostly passed. Rain still struck down upon me from the cloudy nighttime sky, but it had largely abated from its early fury, and the raging waves and tide had also grown more placid. The wind no longer howled terrible suggestions into my ear, and the curtain of clouds above broke up just slightly enough to allow some azure moonlight to slip down from the peaceful firmament.

I forced myself into a sitting position, a task made almost impossibly difficult due to the weight of my soaked clothes, though my brief siesta seemed to have given my body back some of its strength (though it had done little for the raging headache that now dominated the space within my skull). Looking around, I found myself on a long stretch of beach. The vast ocean, like onyx glass in the blackness of night, extended before me in one direction; in all others was only shadow and sand.

Disoriented, thirsty, and shivering with the cold, I struggled to gather my thoughts while I sat on that frigid stretch of lonely beach. I couldn’t remember how I had ended up in Poseidon’s playground. The only thing I knew was that I couldn’t stay there on that beach, exposed to the rain and the chill. I needed to find shelter as soon as possible; regaining my bearings would come afterward. With this in mind, and suddenly warmed by a fresh determination to escape the elements, I forced my protesting body to its feet. I was immediately hit by a wave of nausea that I was sure would lead to vomiting. My suspicion was quickly proven correct, as I soon found myself doubled over, bile and brine escaping from my open mouth. When my expulsion was over, I stood panting for several long seconds before attempting to spit excess vomit into the sand. My mouth, however, was too dry to conjure any saliva for the wanted action, and so the taste of puke remained. After giving myself a few moments to recover, I took a cautious step forward along the beach. My body screamed with a thousand years of ache, and my legs felt like melted jelly, but I thankfully didn’t seem to be seriously injured. I was lucky; much more lucky than I even realized at the time.

I only made it a few steps along the beach before I noticed the body.

It appeared so suddenly from out of the darkness, seeming to materialize from the very essence of the gloom itself. At first it looked like it may have been an outcropping of rocks, or maybe even a jumble of seaweed, but after a few moments, its true identity became known to me. I scrambled toward the crumpled form with as much haste as I could, clumsily falling to a knee when I reached it. It was lying on the beach with its back to the sky, its face in the cold, wet sand. I reached a pruny hand toward its soggy shoulder and shook it with what strength I could gather.

“Hey!” I said. “Hey, wake up!”

When the figure didn’t respond, I decided to flip it onto its back. Upon doing so, I immediately realized two things. The first was that this person, judging by their clothes, was the pilot. The second was that they were dead. I reeled away from the corpse in a sudden tempest of shock and disgust. The body’s vacant, watery eyes seemed to follow me as I went; they bulged out of the corpse’s bloated head in a way that seemed like they were trying to escape from their home.

I was only able to recognize the pilot from their uniform; I never would have been able to identify them based on the state of their corpse, which had already been ravaged by death and the sea in such a relatively short time. The presence of the dead pilot, while disturbing and tragic, at the very least helped me to settle my swimming mind. I remembered that I had been on a last-minute red-eye flight that was on its way over the Atlantic when we suddenly hit a particularly rough patch of turbulence. This apparently wasn’t too much to be concerned about, as the pilot — the same one now lying dead in front of me — hadn’t seemed worried at all when announcing the possibility of a slightly bumpy flight.

That was before the storm appeared.

I returned to my feet and looked back in the direction of the ocean’s maw, searching for something — the sinking wreckage; some supplies floating in the angry surf; a deployed lifeboat, maybe — but all I could see was more black. It was as if my entire world had been reduced to the inside of an inkwell, in which I was confined for all eternity. Never have I feared the terrible might of the ocean as much as I did in that moment, in the midst of that lashing rain, beneath the alien darkness of the nighttime sky. 

I suddenly heard a voice calling to me, sounding very far away. I likely wouldn't have even heard it had the storm still been at its worst.

I followed the voice with my eyes. Approaching me from farther along the beach was a young woman, who staggered toward me with all the grace and speed that her worn, soaking body could muster. When she finally reached me, she was drained of her energy, and was reduced to heavy panting that prevented her from speaking for some time. 

“Are you alright?” I asked her, then realized I could provide a more apt question: “Are you hurt?”

She shook her head, then, finally catching her breath, said, “No, but I need your help. There's a man over here who can't stand. I think he has a broken leg.”

“Where is he?”

“There.” She pointed toward the darkness that she had just emerged from, and I immediately understood that I had asked another foolish question. “I can't lift him by myself. Please, I need your help!”

The woman turned and made her way back in the direction from which she had come. I prepared to follow after, but, remembering my original purpose for stopping there, offered one final glance at the body of the pilot. Where was once a corpse, now was only sand. The body of the pilot was gone.

The woman yelled for me to hurry, knocking away any shock that I might have felt at discovering the pilot’s absence. Brushing aside any hesitance, I followed her into the shadows, both of us struggling to make our way along the beach, until we came across another figure lying on the sand. For a moment I thought back to the dead pilot, but the pit this memory formed in my stomach was immediately dispelled when this new figure began to move. He groaned in his agony as he turned to look at me, his face awash with the anguish of his apparent injury.

“Oh, thank God!” he said. “Please, help me! Get me out of here!”

“It's going to be alright, sir,” I said, not knowing if that was true. “Where are you hurt?”

“My legs!” He yelled. “My fucking *legs*!”

“Alright,” I said. “We're going to help you, but we need to get you out of this rain first.”

“There's a cave nearby,” the woman said. “I saw it further inland. We can take him there.”

“Alright,” I said. “Then we need to move now. I’ll get him, you just lead us to that cave.”

I positioned myself behind the agonized man and wrapped either arm beneath his armpits and up over his shoulders. After signifying to the woman that I was ready, we began our trek through the darkness, her leading the way while I, walking backwards, dragged our companion through the sand. Soon the terrain became more rough as sand transitioned to less agreeable surfaces, and the sounds of his pain began. He groaned and yelled as I dragged his ruinous body across stones and branches and sharp thorns. Our trek seemed to go on for hours, during which my own heavy, exhausted body begged for me to abandon my charge and leave the man to his fate. I barely remember reaching the cave, which seemed to spring up out of the gloom like a waiting tombstone. Once inside, I placed the injured man against one of the cool earthen walls. The relief of losing my burden overwhelmed me so greatly that I too collapsed to the cave floor, my strength completely lost. I intended to only lie there for a brief moment while I recovered some of my energy, but soon the exhaustion that had overtaken me grew far too powerful, and I once again fell unconscious, my mind as dark as the surrounding cave.

I awoke to the sound and heat of a crackling fire. I enjoyed its warmth, though inside I possessed a chill that seemingly no flame could ever chase away. When I opened my eyes, I saw the orange glow of the blaze, which rested just beyond the mouth of the cave. Sitting in front of the fire were two silhouettes; behind them was nighttime darkness. I could see twinkling white stars beyond the figures’ heads, indicating that the storm had finally ceased, but not much else.

Sitting up required the immense task of ignoring my screaming head. I looked around, taking in my surroundings while I waited for my mind to stop dancing. The chamber of the cave I was in, while appearing to be fairly small, extended beyond where the light of the fire could reach; I didn’t yet know how far it went, or what passages were hidden deep within the shadows, but the distant sound of dripping water told me that there was considerably more to the cavern than what I could see.

I forced myself to my feet, rising as high as I was able (the low roof of the cave forced me to crouch to about half of my full height) and shuffled my way toward the two figures in front of the fire. As I approached, I noticed the injured man lying near the blaze; he appeared to be unconscious, and in the flickering firelight I could see the gentle rise and fall of his chest. He had been stripped to his underwear, and I caught a glimpse of the pair of horrible bruises that covered either of his legs in huge blotches, looking like tattoos of raging hellfire.

One of the silhouettes noticed me and turned in my direction. I recognized the look of the young woman, her face dancing in the shadows produced by the blaze. She offered me a concerned smile. “You’re awake,” she said. “How are you feeling?”

“Everything hurts,” I said, “but I’m alright.” I looked at the unconscious man. “How is *he*?”

“Broken legs.” It was the other figure who talked. He was a burly-looking man with a bushy, thick beard of gray that matched the grizzle in his voice. The stranger kept his gaze on the fire as he spoke. “Both of ’em. Seems alright enough, though. Bones didn’t break skin, and no bleeding far as I could see.”

I failed to suppress a frown. “Can’t we do anything for him? Set his bones or something?”

“You a doctor?” The stranger looked at me now. His eyes were as frigid as the fire was warm. “Ever set a bone before?”

“No,” I said sheepishly, answering both questions at once.

“Setting bones without knowin’ what you’re doin’ is dangerous,” he said. “Could even be deadly.” He gestured to the young woman with his chin. “You can ask the nurse all about that.”

I looked at her. “You’re a nurse?”

“Nursing *student*,” she corrected kindly. “Only just finished my first semester. He needs more help than I’m able to provide him.”

“Then we need to get him out of here,” I said.

“You a good swimmer?” the stranger asked.

I nodded. “I’m good enough.”

He grunted in some strange affirmation. “Good enough to swim across the Atlantic with him on your back? Because that’s the only way you’re getting him off of this island.”

“How sure are you that this is even an island?” the nursing student asked.

“Sure enough,” he said. “Not much else out where we went down. But I suppose we can find out for certain in the mornin’. I’ll look around this place come daylight, try to get an idea of what we’re workin’ with here.”

I looked at the man with the broken legs. “Hopefully he even lasts that long.”

“He will,” the stranger said. His attention was back on the fire now. “Injuries don’t seem life-threatening right now. Should be alright so long as we get rescued soon enough.”

“But who knows how long *that* could take?” the nursing student asked.

“Don’t know,” he said. “We’ll just have to wait and see.”

His words were less than reassuring, but they proved to be the last we would get from him that night. The stranger stared at the blaze in silence for a short while longer, then lay down in the brush and dirt near where he sat and seemingly fell asleep, his breaths soon coming in a series of calm, relaxed snores. The nursing student and I stayed up for a while longer. The conversation between us was brief, with long gaps between words; we exchanged names (although I don’t think I ever actually registered hers) and a few other details about ourselves, but besides these few short episodes, we mostly allowed the crackling fire and the distant crashing waves to do the talking.

Eventually our conversation turned to the stranger.

“Where did he come from?” I asked, my voice dropped to a low whisper.

“I don’t know,” she said. “The storm came to a stop not long after you passed out, and then he kind of just… showed up. Didn’t even introduce himself. He helped me build the fire and brought our injured friend closer to it, where we looked him over and assessed his injuries.”

“Strange,” I said. “Where was he during the storm?”

“He hasn’t told me. In fact, he hasn’t said *anything* about himself at all. And that’s really had me thinking.”

“What do you mean?” I asked.

“I mean do you even remember seeing him when we boarded our plane?”

“No,” I admitted, “but I don’t remember seeing you or the injured guy, either.” I paused. “Why? Do you think he wasn’t on our plane or something? How could he possibly be here with us, then?”

“I don’t know,” she said again. “I just get the sense that he… doesn’t belong. It’s hard to explain, but I just feel a very uncomfortable energy from him.”

“Well, we’ll keep an eye on him,” I said. “He’s been helpful enough so far. Could be that he’s a little socially awkward, is all. Maybe a bit of a loner.”

“Maybe,” she said. “Maybe I’m overly exhausted and I’m just being paranoid, but something about this whole situation — this whole *place* — just feels wrong.”

“Wrong how?” I asked.

“You’ve been out cold for a little while, so maybe you just don’t feel it yet, but *I* do. I just can’t shake the feeling like we aren’t *welcome* here, like there’s something watching us from the darkness, waiting for us to let our guard down. And I can’t help but feel like *he* is a part of it.”

We both glanced in the direction of the sleeping stranger, then back to each other.

“Maybe I’ll go with him when he gets the lay of the land tomorrow,” she said. “Try to get some information out of him, see if his story checks out.”

“Let *me* go,” I said. “Our injured friend will need a medical professional to look after him.”

“I told you I’ve barely got one semester of nursing school under my belt,” she said.

I offered her a tired smile. “That’s still more experience than *I* have.”

“I guess you’re right,” she said, returning the smile. “Fine. But be careful around him, alright? There’s no telling what he’ll do when the two of you are alone together.”

She and I took turns staying on watch that night. My time spent awake, watching the darkness beyond our camp, helped me to understand what she had meant when she said that something was off about our new home. Something definitely felt sinister about the place, something that, even thinking back on it now, sends a chill racing all over my body. At the time I figured it was possible the young woman’s words had placed this sensation into my mind, but as I sat near the fire on watch, I couldn’t help but feel like there was something or some*things* watching us — watching *me* — from the heavy darkness. The nearby shore, the surrounding trees, even the depths of the cave where the water dripped into the abyss; wherever there was an absence of light, there was an abundance of eyes. And they were all turned in the same direction.

The stranger and our injured companion didn’t stir for the rest of night, until the coming of dawn when the former seemed to rise like clockwork at the first trickle of sunlight. I was on watch when he awoke; he sat up with an almost inhuman roboticness that made my skin want to crawl right off of my body. Maybe the nursing student was right, I thought. Maybe something *was* wrong with the stranger. Or maybe her paranoia had infected me too. It was difficult to tell.

The young woman and the injured man awoke shortly after, but the latter was in a state of such pain and agony that he was practically incoherent, and drifted between states of consciousness the way parts from our plane surely drifted along the surface of the nearby ocean.

The stranger didn’t speak for nearly an hour after waking. He sat in his same spot, stoking the fire and resupplying it with fresh kindling, before abruptly standing and saying, to nobody in particular: “Going to take a look around. See what I can find.”

“I’ll come with you,” I said, perhaps too quickly.

He offered me an apathetic look. “Would be able to move more quickly on my own.”

“You’re also more likely to hurt yourself and not have anybody to come help you,” the nursing student said. She knelt next to the semi-conscious injured man and felt his forehead. I could tell by her grimace that he was likely running concerningly warm, despite what his intermittent shivers would have suggested.

The stranger thought about this for a moment. “Alright. But keep up.”

I nodded, climbed to my feet with a groan, and offered the nursing student and her patient one final glance before departing into the unknown with the stranger. I had the strangest fear that I would never see either of them again. This fear was later proved to be unfounded, of course — I would still see *one* of them yet, at the very least.

I followed the stranger back to the beach, which looked so much smaller in the morning sunlight. The azure ocean, more inviting than its obsidian counterpart, was still just as imposing in its vastness as its nighttime self. Even in the light of day, it was obvious that the endless body of water could easily swallow us whole if it chose to, and I didn’t intend to give it a reason to do so. I still saw no sign of the plane wreckage, and figured it had either long-since sank to the bottom of the ocean, or had otherwise drifted beyond the gently crashing waves to a point that I could not see with my naked eye.

The stranger drew a deep line in the sand with his boot. “Gonna get an idea of how far around this island is, see if we can’t make a full loop of it in a decent time.” He started walking, not waiting for me, and I hustled to square up next to him. Each step through the heavy sand felt like trudging through a dense pool of water to my aching body, but the stranger hardly seemed to notice the extra effort. “After that, we’d best head inland and look for a water source. That’s most important of all.”

His words made me realize just how thirsty I was. The creeping pain of dehydration hurt more than any pangs of hunger that I felt. My head pounded with the absence of water; my pulpy, scabbed tongue screamed for mercy. “How long do you think we’ll be here?”

“Could be days,” he said bluntly. “Could be years.”

“*Years*?” The word felt impossible on my swollen tongue.

He nodded without looking at me. “Not every missing flight gets found. I heard about a flight filled with college students that went down over this very stretch of the Atlantic a number of years ago. They eventually had to give up the search — probably much more quickly than you’d like to know.”

I frowned at the thought, but said nothing. When the stranger realized he wouldn’t be getting a response, he went on. “If we’re going to be here for a while, then we’re going to have to trust each other. That means no scheming behind each others’ backs.”

These words brought me to a sudden halt. He did the same, and our eyes finally met. To my surprise, there was no anger in the stranger’s gaze; in fact, there didn’t appear to be much of anything there at all. “I’m good at lookin’ like I’m asleep, ain’t I?”

I waited a while to respond, not sure what to say. The words I finally chose felt weak, pathetic. “I’m sorry.”

He nodded and began walking again. I followed his lead. “For what it’s worth, I *do* remember seeing you on that flight yesterday. Can’t say the same for the other two. Doesn’t mean they weren’t there, but… Again, for what it’s worth.”

“Are you saying you think they weren’t on the flight?”

“What I mean is that we probably have more to worry about than just gettin’ food and water here,” he said. “I’ll give that girl credit, she was right about this place. Somethin’ is wrong here. I didn’t sleep a wink last night, despite what you may have thought. I was too busy keeping my ears open; too busy listening to all the strange sounds in the darkness, many of which you may have even missed. I felt that presence, felt its eyes on me. There was somethin’ out there, beyond the light of our fire. And it was watching us, make no mistake about it.”

“An animal?” I asked.

He shook his head.

We didn’t speak much after that. We completed our loop in less than thirty minutes and confirmed that we were, in fact, on an island. Besides a brief few yards where we had to walk along the thicket, the beach remained uninterrupted, allowing for a straightforward journey along our circle.

When we reached his line in the sand, the stranger stopped and looked at me. “Well, that settles that. Next we need to look for something to drink. A stream, some coconuts, anything.”

“I heard some dripping water coming from somewhere in the cave,” I said.

“I did too,” he said, “and I didn’t like the sound of it.”

He didn’t elaborate on what he meant.

We doubled back and entered a less dense section of the thicket, searching for food, water, anything that could help sustain us. It was dark beneath that heavy crown of trees; the gloom made me think of the obsidian ocean the night before. I was suddenly reminded of the dead pilot, who had once lay sprawled out in the cold, wet, sand before vanishing in an instant. I hadn’t thought back to that moment since coming to the injured man’s aid, but the memory had managed to conjure itself from the great, suffocating darkness and force its way back into my troubled mind. I considered mentioning what I had seen to the stranger, but thought better of it; to verbally recall such a wicked occurrence felt dangerous in a place such as this.

The stranger led me past tree trunks and overtop tangled roots, deeper and deeper into that arboreal labyrinth, until I could no longer see the beach through all the foliage. I tried not to show my hesitation in following the man, but in truth, I still struggled to trust him. Part of me wondered if he was luring me into that sinister collection of trees and earth so that he could do to me what he had already done to the pilot’s soaked, decaying corpse. I did my best to banish this thought, but it lingered, acting as a barrier between the stranger and me that kept me from straying too close to him. 

The world around me grew dark as the sun above us vanished. We seemed to walk for hours, though I knew this couldn’t have been possible; the island wasn’t large enough for us to penetrate its inland for longer than a quarter of an hour at most. If we kept on how we were, we’d eventually make it to the opposite beach from where we had started. I knew this to be true; it simply had to be.

Except it wasn’t.

We kept going and going for countless minutes, hours, days, never finding the other end of the thicket. Darkness further enveloped us, obscuring our vision and thus our ability to perform our task — our entire reason for entering the forest in the first place. I could barely see the stranger in front of me, his form becoming more and more obscured by shadow with each step forward. I told him we needed to turn back, to find our way out of the forest. He remained deaf to my words.

A sudden snapping of a twig stole my attention. I turned in its direction for the briefest of moments, imagining that when my gaze reached its destination, it would be greeted by some dark, sinister form lurking in the shadows. When I saw nothing but more tree trunks and blackness, I cautiously returned my attention to the man leading me through the thicket. In that brief moment, the stranger had managed to disappear.

“Sir?” I called, realizing I had never learned his name. My own voice sounded far away, muffled, as if the gloom itself were choking me. “Sir? Where are you?”

Swirling darkness. Sounds of shuffling in the brush. The growing, thickening sense that stepping into this wood was a mistake, the thought that at any moment the thing stalking me, the presence that had been watching me since the previous night, was preparing to strike. I imagined the deep, Stygian tide squirming up from the ocean and pulling the pilot into the frigid depths, and I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that those same watery tendrils were coming toward me now, winding through the trees on their way to me, ready to drag me kicking and screaming and swallowing brine back to the waiting abyss.

I grew dizzy. My vision became darker, merging with the gloom. Something was coming. Something was here.

I felt a firm hand on my shoulder. Snapping out of my own panicked bubble, I turned and saw the stranger, his stern eyes looking at me through the gloom. He had somehow gotten behind me, or I had somehow gotten ahead of him.

“This is useless,” he said. “We can’t see a damn thing in this place. Come on, let’s get out of here.”

It took us barely a minute to find our way back out to the section of beach that we had just stepped away from. Coming out into the sunshine, catching my breath and taking in that crisp ocean air, I thought that the worst of my ordeal was over.

What I didn’t realize, what I couldn’t possibly have realized, was that it was only just beginning.

I wanted to ask the stranger if he’d experienced the same overwhelming sensation that I had while in the forest, but I was afraid of his answer. As it turned out, I wouldn’t have to be the one to broach the subject. We’d only walked a handful of steps before the stranger stopped us in our tracks and looked at me. “I felt it too.”

I frowned at him. “Felt what?”

“That presence,” he said. “There, among the trees. It was the same presence that watched us all through the night. There’s evil on this island with us; this much I believe without a shadow of a doubt.”

“What do you think it is?”

“I haven’t a clue,” he said, “and I’m not sure I want to know.”

The camp was deserted, the fire in shambles. A few long, smoldering branches scattered about the place were all that remained of the blaze, save for the pitiful smoke which billowed up from the gray ashes in the center of the old pit. The nursing student was gone, and, even more strangely, so was the injured man.

I called out for our lost companions, but received no response.

“What happened here?” I said. “Where could they have gone?”

The stranger, who stood closer to the mouth of the cave, looked deep into the darkness of the cavern. I stepped closer and followed his gaze. Though the black curtain beyond the mouth was impenetrable by human eyes, my ears caught the sound of a distant, familiar voice, one screaming in agony over his broken legs.

“How’d he get in there?” I asked.

“How else does a man with two broken legs get anywhere?” he said. “He certainly didn’t move there himself.”

“You mean *it* took him there?” I said.

He nodded. “And I think it’ll take *us* too, if we let it.”

I looked into the darkness of the cave, then back to my companion. “We have to go help him.”

“Nothing we can do for him now,” the stranger said. “That thing *wants* you to go after him so it can get you alone too. Then you’ll end up just like him.”

I listened to the injured man’s cries of agony continuing to echo from somewhere deep within the cave. “But we can’t just leave him in there!”

“We can,” the stranger said. “Hell, I doubt if that’s even his real voice.” He picked up one of the smoldering branches. “That poor fella is likely already gone by now.”

“What are you going to do with that?”

“Only thing I *can* do now,” he said. “Gonna burn this whole place to the ground and pray that the fire is enough to purge the evil that rots here. Or at the very least keeps it contained to that cave.”

I looked at him, then once again turned my eyes back at the wailing cave. After another moment I picked up one of the smoldering branches and turned toward the cavern’s waiting lips. “I have to go after him.”

“You’ll die,” the stranger said plainly. “Die or worse. But I won’t stop you.”

These were the last words I ever heard from him. Without looking back, I blew on my smoldering branch in order to reignite some of its flame, ducked into the shallow mouth of the cave, and allowed the darkness to take me.

My makeshift torch did little to light the way ahead, and so I was forced to use the injured man’s agonized cries to guide me through the squirming, smothering darkness. I thought about the presence. How long had it been on this island? Centuries? Eternities? Since time immemorial, just waiting for poor castaways like us to arrive on its demonic shores? I couldn’t ever know, nor was I sure I even wanted to.

I understood that the stranger was right about this most likely being a trap. I was almost certainly shuffling toward my own death, but I couldn’t bring myself to turn back around. I had to know for sure whether the injured man was down there; if I abandoned him without knowing the truth, it would have haunted me for the rest of my life— as long or as short as that was meant to be.

The injured man’s voice came from everywhere and nowhere. Sometimes it seemed to suddenly grow louder, then just as quickly fade away. Soon it disappeared entirely, replaced by the sound of dripping water, which was itself replaced by the sound of a small, flowing stream. By now I was certain that the injured man wasn’t actually down there, but I couldn’t turn back. The presence was guiding me forward; the only reason it allowed me to continue on was because I was choosing to bend to its whim. To defy it would surely only bring about my premature doom.

I saw the stream of water, which looked to flow from out of a nearby wall only to quickly disappear beyond my torch’s glow, back into the waiting gloom. A silhouette crouched there, greedily drinking from the stream. As I drew within arm’s length of the running water, I realized that the silhouette had become — or it always *was* — my own shadow, doing what I so desperately wished I could do. I suddenly forgot all about the injured man, and his agonized cries. I forgot about wanting to leave that cave, about wanting to go home. All I could focus on was the insatiable desire to quench my thirst.

The cool, rushing water beckoned my parched lips, sang to my crumbling tongue like a siren. I leaned closer, answering its sweet call, until I could feel its racing chill right in front of my face. All I had to do was lean just a little bit farther.

But then I stopped. Something inside of me, something small but mighty, told me that I couldn’t drink that water. It told me that I needed to get as far away from that stream as I possibly could. Heeding this inner voice, I sat up, pulling my face away from the stream with great, almost insurmountable difficulty.

Only to have it shoved back down, directly into the rushing deluge.

The torch fell from my grip as my face slammed into the earthen surface beneath the waiting water. I heard the nursing student’s whispering voice in my ear, telling me to open my mouth, to suckle from the vitality of the stream. I fought to keep my dry, crackled lips shut against the antagonizing flow for as long as I could, but soon the voice’s suggestion, or maybe even my own, forced those same lips open, and allowed the water to enter me freely. Its cool, soothing touch ran over my teeth and embraced my aching tongue. I sat there, my face pressed against the stream, for close to thirty seconds, sure that my fate was to drown there in the dark, my body no longer my own.

But then I felt the pressure against my skull lessen, and I managed to pull away. I sat there, soaking wet and gasping, for only a few short moments before I snatched up my torch, still barely alive with its red glow, and rushed away from the stream, back in the direction that I thought I had come from. I heard the woman’s voice telling me to wait, but I ignored her. I just kept going, kept fighting my way through the dark, slicing through the shadows with my torch like a scythe through wheat.

It was already dusk when I finally emerged from the cave. Hours somehow had passed while I was deep within the bowels of the island. I stood up and rushed past the remnants of the fire, calling for the stranger, asking him where he was. It wasn’t until I found his own branch lying in the brush, no longer smoldering but dead and cold, that I understood his fate.

And yet still I called for him. “Sir!” I said. “Where are you?!”

“Gone.”

I turned around at the sound of the nursing student’s voice. She was in the mouth of the cave, her body having found a way to stand fully upright despite the aperture only providing enough space for her to crouch. When she saw that I saw her, she smiled kindly at me. “Or perhaps he was never there to begin with.”

I stared at her for several long seconds. I had so many burning questions that I wanted to ask her, but no voice with which to ask them, and so I remembered some of the stranger’s final words and did the only thing I thought I could: I threw my torch into the nearby brush, and I watched the fresh blaze grow.

I looked back at the nursing student. I expected her to recoil back into the cave, cursing in some ancient, furious language as the inferno began to consume the surrounding foliage. Instead, she just looked at me and continued to smile. It wasn’t a sinister smile; her lips didn’t curl away from impossibly long, sharp fangs, or twist into a devastating smirk. It was the subtle, close-lipped smile that you offer a stranger who you lock eyes with while you both wait for your drink at a coffee shop. At the time, I didn’t understand what she had to smile about, but I do now.

She was smiling because she had won.



The island was swallowed by the flame. Its bright blaze attracted the attention of a nearby fishing barge, which made its way to the unintended beacon, thus coming to my rescue. I stood on the ship watching the island disappear behind us, its all-consuming inferno visible for hours before finally falling out of sight.

The authorities found no sign of anybody else surviving that plane crash. As far as they understood it, I was the only person to make it to that island alive. An act of God, they said. I might have called it something else.

With great difficulty I returned to my normal life, and in the coming weeks, I thought that everything had gone back to how it was supposed to be. I thought I was free from whatever it was that tormented me on that island. I thought it was gone forever.

But I was wrong.

I started feeling that presence — that *evil* — rising up inside of me just a few days ago. It whispers in my ear while I try to sleep, torments me in my dreams. I had thought I’d escaped its terrible grasp, but I realize now that it had purposely let me go.

It had let me go because it knew I was taking it with me.

I can’t help but think it would have been better if I had died in that plane crash. Had I simply perished like all the others, the presence would still be trapped on that island. It haunts me even now, as I struggle to write these final words. I feel it slithering down my throat and coiling in my stomach like some otherworldly parasite, or like a cold, flowing stream of water. Thanks to me, the presence from the island has escaped from its eternal prison. It’s inside of me now.

And I don’t think it intends to stay there for long.

In the center of the city, the men and women were better dressed than in the States, the men in suits and the women in stylish skirts or dresses, most wearing high heels.  When they walked in couples, the woman would often take the man’s arm the old fashioned way.

The males, with their dark eyes and swarthy looks, were handsome enough, but their attitude towards females left much to be desired.  In some parts of the country, girls as young as fourteen were still auctioned off at fairs to the highest bidder.

Still, Sofia was a thrilling place for Elaine to find herself.  A helluva lot more interesting than Great Falls, Montana.   

The day she arrived, she was met at the airport by a Bulgarian driver from the office and formally escorted to an apartment in the center.  The flat had been rented for her on a weekly basis until she could find permanent accommodations.  It was lovely, with antique furniture and ten-foot ceilings, and overlooked a quiet, tree-shaded square.

When she arrived at the Secret Service office, a stocky receptionist said, “We’ve been expecting you,” in accented English.  She motioned down the hall.  “The SAIC’s office is the last one at the end of the hall.”

Elaine didn’t know a thing about the SAIC except that his name was Nick LaGrange.  She went down the corridor and stopped at the door marked with his name.

There was a tall, broad-shouldered man bent over a desk cluttered with papers, stained coffee cups, and other debris.  He was counting out money from an envelope, muttering to himself, and scribbling on a piece of paper.  Elaine couldn’t see his face—he had long, unkempt brown hair that obscured it.  He was wearing faded, holey jeans, hiking boots, and a cracked leather flight jacket over a wrinkled-looking linen shirt.

He looked up, brushing the hair out of his face.  He saw Elaine and gave a warm smile.  “Hi there.”

He was the most handsome man she had ever laid eyes on.

“I’m Nick LaGrange,” he said, offering her his strong-looking hand.  “You must be Elaine?”

“Yes,” she finally said.  She didn’t want to let it go.

“I’m about to go on an undercover assignment.  You wanna come along, get the feel of the place?”

Elaine glanced uncertainly down at her business suit.

“Don’t worry, you’re dressed just right for this assignment.”  He paused.  “Got your service pistol with you?”

“Yes, of course.”  Elaine started to open her satchel.

“Leave it here.”  With a faint smile, he said, “I read the note in your file.”



\* \* \*

Five minutes later, they were climbing into an old cherry red Mustang that was parked in a garage near the office.  Nick put the key into the ignition and the engine thundered to life.

“Bought this in New York, shipped it to the UK, and drove it all the way here from London,” he said proudly, as he pulled out of the garage.  “An original Boss 429. ‘68 model.”  He glanced at her.  “You’re probably not much into muscle cars...”

“No,” Elaine admitted.  She was still a little offended by the comment he had made about the note in her file.

They drove through the center of Sofia, with Nick honking, and pulling around trams and clusters of pedestrians.  Steering with his knees, he pulled out a bag of tobacco and started rolling a cigarette.   He slipped the perfectly rolled smoke between his lips and lit it.

He smiled when he saw her watching.  “Had a lot of experience in college.  Want me to roll one for you?”

“No, thanks,” she said, grinning.  This guy was a real character.

As they continued on through the city, she noticed that everyone stared at the vintage American automobile as it rolled by.  

“Isn’t this car a little conspicuous for a Secret Service agent?” she said.

Nick laughed.  “There are no secrets in this place, Elaine.  Everybody knows everybody else.  And Americans stick out here like sore thumbs.”  He turned a corner and waved at some man who was standing on a corner, smoking a cigar.  “Any Bulgarian can spot a *chuzhenetz*—a foreigner— at a hundred yards.  They can tell by the way you dress, walk, move, the shape of your face, and a hundred other cues.  You have to be careful here, too.  In Bulgaria, a foreigner spells only one thing—M-O-N-E-Y.”

“How long have you been here?”

“Five years.  Five long years.  Before that, Warsaw.  Before that, Paris.”

“You like being abroad, then?”

“I like being as far from headquarters and their goddam DOPS as possible.”

He made a sharp left, into a square.  He pulled into a parking space along the street.

“What exactly is this undercover assignment?”  Elaine said nervously.

Nick finished his cigarette and tossed the butt out the window.  “Ever heard of the Turkey Roll?” 

“No.”

“Sounds like a sandwich, doesn’t it?  It’s a con they pull around here.”   

They got out of the car and walked across the street.  There was a huge Byzantine-style church at the far end of the square, with glittering gold domes and curving, turquoise roofs.  

“That’s the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral,” Nick said.  “Probably the biggest tourist attraction here.”

Nick suddenly took Elaine’s hand. “For this to work, we need to look like a couple,” he said, in a low voice.

She wondered if he was just saying that as an excuse to hold her hand.  *Wishful thinking*, Elaine thought.  

After they had walked only a few feet, a man appeared from nowhere and cut directly in front of Elaine.  He stooped to pick something up from the sidewalk, this all happened so abruptly that Elaine almost stumbled into him.  He picked up a thick roll of American one hundred dollar bills.  

For an instant, Elaine felt angry— if the man hadn’t cut in front of her, she would have found it herself.

He looked up at Elaine, then at Nick.

“Yours?” he said, holding up the money.

Now Elaine realized maybe this was the con.  The Turkey Roll.

Nick glanced at her, then said to the man, “Yes, it’s my money.”  When he reached for it, the man quickly stepped away.  

He said, “We split it—fifty-fifty.  Okay?”

Nick looked at Elaine again.  “Well...”

“Let’s go over there,” the man whispered, pointing behind a building.  

He led them around the corner.

Elaine glanced nervously around, afraid of what might happen next.  She didn’t like this situation, being in a strange country, mixed up with criminals, and unarmed.

The man pulled the rubber band off the money and quickly started counting it out.  *Edin, dvama, trima, chitirima*...

There were thirty crisp one hundred dollar bills in the roll, or three thousand dollars.

He handed half of them to Nick, then glanced past Elaine, his eyes widening.   He turned and scurried away, running along the side of the building.

Two men trotted up to them from the opposite direction.  One was in a rumpled suit, the other in a dirty-looking jogging outfit.  The latter pointed at Nick, babbling in Bulgarian.

The well-dressed one flashed a police badge at them.  “This man—he say you stole his money.”

Nick glanced nervously at Elaine.  “I don’t know what you’re talking about.  I didn’t steal any money.”

“Empty your pockets!”

Nick hesitated.

“You want go to jail?”

Nick reluctantly reached into his jacket pockets and turned them inside out.  Then, from his jeans’ pockets, he pulled out his car keys, his wallet, and a cigarette lighter.  “See?”

“There!” the other man said, pointing at the little watch pocket in Nick’s jeans.

Nick sighed and pulled out the roll of money.  “Look, it was just laying on the sidewalk.  I didn’t steal it from anyone.”

“*Da*!” the other man said, snatching it from Nick’s hand. He unrolled the bills, then frowned, looking back at Nick.  “*To ne vsichko e tuk*!”  

“He say you take some of his money,” the cop said.  

“I didn’t take any of it,” Nick said.   He motioned to the back of the building.  “Some other guy picked up the roll and gave me half.”

“Other guy?” the cop said, looking around.  “What other guy?  I see no other guy.”

Nick glanced at Elaine.

“You want go to jail?” the cop said again.  He squinted at Elaine.  “You want *both* go to jail?  Bulgarian prison very bad.  Not like in America.”

Nick glanced around, then opened his wallet.  “Look, I’ll give you all the money I have...”  He pulled out a few hundred dollar bills, and another few hundred euro notes. 

The cop looked at Elaine.

“I don’t have any money,” she said, her throat dry.  She sure hoped this was the con that Nick had been talking about, and not something else.

The cop asked the other man a question.  The man glared at Nick.  “Okay,” he finally said, and pocketed all the money.  He turned and walked back around the corner, muttering to himself.

Pointing at Nick, the cop said, “You should be careful.  Bulgaria very dangerous for foreigners.”  

He walked off in the other direction.

As they were alone again, Nick looked knowingly at Elaine.  His lips curled into a smile.

“He wasn’t a real cop...”

“Nope,” Nick said.

“I don’t get it—what was this all about?”

“This,” Nick said, reaching into his back pocket.  He produced a single one hundred dollar bill.  “This came off that roll of money—all of it was probably counterfeit.  A couple of undercover cops—real cops—will keep tabs on those guys until we find out.”



\* \* \*

As soon as they were inside the Mustang and headed back to the office, Elaine said. “You should have let me bring my gun.  I’m not incompetent.”  

“Did I say you were incompetent?”

“No, but...”  She was angry with herself for wanting to impress him, but she couldn’t help it.  “You make me feel incompetent.  I’m not a helpless girl.”

“Don’t get feminist on me, okay?  I don’t pay a lot of attention to rules, but when it comes to important things, I play by the book.  Something happens to you, and I’m responsible.”  He glanced at her. “Is that all right with you?”

“Well, yes, of course it is.  I just don’t want you to think I’m inept.”   

“The Secret Service must have thought you had other assets that made up for your weakness in marksmanship.”  He glanced at her legs.

“Thanks a lot,” she muttered.

“I didn’t mean that.  I meant, for example, intaglio printing.”  He looked curiously at her.  “Your file said you know a lot about that.”

“I ought to know something about it.  I majored in it.”

Nick looked surprised.  “Where the hell can you major in intaglio printing?”

“RISD.  That’s the Rhode Island School of—”

“I know what it stands for.  That’s a damn good school.”

She gave a modest shrug.  “I guess so.”  Of course it was a good school—it was one of the best design schools in the USA.

Nick said, “Your intaglio printing knowledge could be very useful here.   The main crime we deal with in this office is counterfeiting.  But I’m sure you know that already.”

They rode along in silence for a few minutes.  Even though Elaine felt a bit frustrated with how he was acting towards her, she had a very good feeling being with Nick LaGrange.  His open, honest, and confident manner was very attractive.

As they passed a group of rough-looking men on a corner, her thoughts turned to the con artists they had just been involved with.  “That’s a clever scam those guys pull,” she said.   “For a split second, I was mad when the first man cut in front of me and looked like he’d picked up that big roll of money.  I thought I should have found it instead of him.”

“Yeah.  I always get the same feeling, even though I know it’s a con.”  He smiled at her.  “We’re all greedy, Elaine.  It’s human nature.”  



\* \* \*

When they got back to the office, Nick cleared off some debris from one of his guest chairs and offered her a seat.

“So, what do you think of this bill?” he said, handing Elaine the one hundred dollar note.  He also handed her a magnifying glass.   

The look in his eye told her this was a test.

She carefully rubbed the bill between her thumb and forefinger.  It had been printed with an intaglio press, as she could feel the ridges in the paper.    She squinted at it through the magnifier, inspecting the finer details.  

After a moment, Nick said, “Want a genuine note for comparison?” 

“Don’t need one,” Elaine murmured, peering at the front side of the bill.  “This is definitely a fake.”

Nick raised an eyebrow.  “How do you know?”

“For one thing, the color-shifting ink isn’t quite right.  It changes from black to gold but the—”

“Yeah, good.  And?”

“And the lines on Franklin’s face aren’t spaced the same, especially around the jaw line.  Plus, the microprinting isn’t quite as sharp as it should be.”  Elaine paused.  “Still, it’s a well-done counterfeiting job.”

Nick smiled.  “Not bad, Elaine.  Not bad at all.  Usually we have to send bills this good back to the States to know for sure.”   

He picked up the phone and punched in a number.  While he waited, he opened his drawer and pulled out a stack of one hundred dollar bills that was an inch thick.  “See what you think of these.”",1,1765199068.0,u_Ill_Rough214,0,1.0,False

I had coffee level 11 and sandwich level 10 to do. I waited till the week finished, with all my cards stacked up unopened. At the new week,I opened all cards, used 10 gems for energy, and had already 2 stacked energies. From the cards, I finished a package and got around 150 energies.
Now I am over 300 energies and immediately got the x8. I emptied half of the board: gems coins and boxes, sold some low energy things. Then I used here the infinite energy. They give you unlimited energy for 1 min. I spam clicked on the bread and coffee, combining them fast and taking all coins. Once the 1 min is over, i still had 300 energies to use for other orders.
I would say I finished the coins minimerge of yesterday fir the first time ever and proceeded quite alot in the mistery minigame (worst minigame imo).

The beans appear to be too dark for filter. They recommend \~94c and \~3 min contact time for the brews, but with these parameters the most prominent tasting notes for me for all of the beans so far were: ash, wood, earth. Treating them like espresso roasts, so brewing below 90c, and with a short \~1:30 contact time results in an okayish brew. 

I pulled a few classic 19/38/30sec espresso with my picopresso and those were actually very good, the tasting notes were close to whats on the box. This is why I'm thinking that these are actually meant to be in an espresso calendar.

Or is this their roasting style? Does anyone have experince with their filter roasts? Or is it just me, I got too used to lighter cleaner more acidic coffees over time?

This would be a great experience. The calendar is very nice, I like the design and the idea of travelling around the world by trying a unique origin every day. It just feels like I'm wasting the beans by trying to brew them as recommended.",1,1765198911.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

Trying to lose weight without giving up real food? That’s like trying to fold a fitted sheet without swearing—possible, but highly frustrating.

If you're stuck in a loop of bloating, fatigue, and late-night snack regret, you’re not alone. Feeling out of sync with your body can mess with your mood and motivation.

So when I heard about [Shrink X Gummies](https://theworldhealth.org/shrink-x-official), a one-a-day sweet treat **keto supplement** made with **apple cider vinegar**, I figured—sure, I’ll bite.

# 📦 Product Overview

**Product Name:** Shrink X Gummies  
**Category:** Health & Wellness ➝ Weight Loss Supplements  
**Overall Verdict:** 4.6/5

# 🤓 What Are Shrink X Gummies?

These **keto ACV gummies for weight loss** are blended into one chewy square that tastes way better than it should. Think sweet apple, not salad dressing.

They’re made to help support the body's **fat-burning** function. **With proven results,** these **gummies** reduce cravings, and keep your digestion humming. They skip the caffeine and fake stuff.

What sets them apart is they don’t go all-in on hype. Here's a **diet supplement that supports a keto lifestyle** in a form you’ll actually want to take daily.

# 🔬 Ingredient Breakdown & How It Works

Inside each gummy is a mix of **natural gummies that curb appetite**, B12 for energy, iodine for thyroid support, plus pomegranate and beetroot for antioxidants.

**How keto ACV gummies support digestion and ketosis** comes down to synergy. ACV may improve gut health, while iodine helps regulate metabolism from the top down.

This combo shows how **keto ACV gummies** can support **metabolism gently**, without relying on harsh stimulants or laxatives. It works best with consistent use.

# 💁‍♀️ Clair's Experience with Shrink X

My friend Claire, who runs a small plant-forward meal-prep biz from her kitchen and somehow manages to test every health trend under the sun before I’ve even heard of it, was the one who got me onto [Shrink X](https://theworldhealth.org/shrink-x-official).

We met at a pop-up market a few years ago—I was eyeing her vegan taco bowls, and we’ve been foodie friends ever since.

Claire swears by functional snacks, especially anything that helps keep her energy up while cooking for eight hours straight.

She started using the **apple cider vinegar gummies** to **promote weight loss** after noticing her usual afternoon slump was messing with productivity (and causing fridge raids).

I was skeptical, but she handed me a half-melted sample from her glove compartment and said, “Trust me. These don’t suck.”

I ordered a bottle and started taking one each morning before breakfast. The biggest surprise? The cravings actually dialed down. Like… noticeably.

I wasn’t pacing in front of the pantry by 3 p.m., and that bloated, heavy feeling I used to get after lunch? Way less of an issue.

Did the gummies change my life overnight? Nope. But they *did* help me stay more in control without feeling like I was constantly battling myself.

One thing I didn’t love: on hotter days, the gummies clump a little in the bottle. Nothing wild—you can still eat them—but yeah, keep them somewhere cool.

Claire’s still using them between deliveries and recipe testing, and now I keep a bottle in my snack drawer too. They've earned a spot.

Shrink X wins in the flavor department. These **weight loss** **apple cider vinegar gummies** don’t taste like salad dressing or punishment.

The **recommended daily dose of keto ACV gummies** is just one per day. Simple. I take mine before breakfast, which helps stop morning snack spirals.

It fits easily into a regular wellness routine. No alarms or charts needed. You won’t find many **keto-friendly gummies with no added sugar** this easy to manage.

# ⚠️ Potential Side Effects

While most folks do fine, some reviews mention light stomach cramps early on. Probably due to the vinegar or increased fiber.

These are **supplements that** [combine ACV and keto](https://theworldhealth.org/shrink-x-official) **support**, so if you have thyroid concerns or are on related medication, it’s best to check with a professional first.

Most people wonder **whether ACV gummies are safe to take** long-term. Based on the ingredients, they’re no different from what you’d find in many standard daily vitamins.

# 💬 Customer Feedback

Real users echo my experience. Many said cravings decreased and clothes fit better after a few weeks. Several highlighted **weight loss results from Shrink X** without diet changes.

Most **reviews of Shrink X Gummies** point out the great taste and ease of use. One reviewer excitedly stated they're the **best keto apple cider vinegar gummies** they’d tried.

Others debated **whether keto gummies are actually effective** but concluded that consistent use helped more than they expected.

# ⚖️ How It Compares to Other Gummies

Shrink X sits comfortably with the **top-rated weight loss gummies**, but without the caffeine crash or three-gummies-a-day rule.

Most others either focus on vinegar or keto—rarely both. Shrink X manages to combine benefits without overwhelming the user.

It’s ideal if you’re looking for **gummies designed for keto fat burning** that also support digestion and aren’t full of sugar or fake promises.

# 💸 Pricing Options

One bottle is $59, which isn’t cheap, but buying more brings the cost down. The **three-bottle deal with two freebies** is the best bang for your buck.

That brings it down to about $38 per bottle, which is solid pricing for **sugar-free versions of keto ACV gummies** made with quality ingredients.

If you're investing in your health anyway, this price tag feels fair—especially considering it replaces several pills or powders.

# 🛍️ Where To Buy Shrink X Gummies

Always [order directly from the official Shrink X website](https://theworldhealth.org/shrink-x-official). That’s how you avoid sketchy knockoffs and ensure your **metabolism** boosting **gummy supplements** are fresh.

Buying from the official source is also the only way to access their 60-day money-back guarantee. That peace of mind isn’t worth skipping for a minor discount elsewhere.

Avoid third-party sellers unless you like rolling the dice with your health supplements.

# 💡 How to Maximize Results

If you're using these for fat loss, pair them with a low-carb lifestyle - it's one **way to enter ketosis more quickly** and it amplifies the effects.

Even basic swaps like skipping bread or reducing sugar at breakfast can support the **apple cider vinegar and keto supplement in gummy form** for better results.

Even simple changes like cutting back on bread or morning sugar can help the **apple cider vinegar and keto gummy** combo work more effectively.

1phbrfw,https://www.reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/comments/1phbrfw/six_months_pp_and_these_are_my_two_cents/,Six months PP and these are my two cents,"Greetings from a mom at 3:55 AM! My daughter just turned six months on Monday, which is wild because I swear I’ve been a mother for at least four years?! Not because I'm overwhelmed, it's because I spend all day and sometimes overnight with her. The changes that happen as she grows happen SO fast but my brain believes they are happening over a longer period of time because this kind of growth surely should take years?! I'm new to this. The first two months were brutal as a FTM (first-time mom), but after that my anxiety slowly packed its bags and left. Now I actually look forward to each day. Here’s what helped:

1. *Everyone has their own parenting style.*
Some parents swear by schedules. Others go with the flow. Whatever your vibe, be flexible. Real life doesn’t follow the book, the class, or that calm TikTok mom. If you cling to the “should,” frustration builds fast. Flow with what’s actually happening.


2. *You really do get used to the lack of sleep.*
Sounds fake, I know. But here I am at 3:55 AM enjoying my quiet time with a baby who treats the night shift like a social hour. I get cuddles, peace, and a temporary break from pretending I’ll fold laundry today. A mindset shift helps—seeing these moments as opportunities instead of punishments changed everything.


3. *Don’t get angry at or around your baby.*
Babies sense vibes like tiny emotional Wi-Fi routers. Bad mood? Instantly downloaded. Step into another room, breathe, text your best friend in full caps, just don’t let it land on the baby. Remember that until at least six months crying is their ONLY way to communicate. So, your baby isn't being difficult or likes to be fussy, they are communicating with you.


4. *The minute being with your baby feels like a chore, you’re not a parent anymore, you’re a babysitter.*
And babysitters get paid. So unless someone’s Venmo’ing you… reset.


5. *Give your partner grace (even when the milk hits the fan).*
My husband and I are a great team, but sometimes I watch him parent and think, “Ah, so this is how civilizations fall.”
Like the time he forgot the valve in the bottle and milk went everywhere.
My inner voice: “HE HAS DONE THIS A MILLION TIMES WHAT IS HAPPENING.”
But honestly, most partners are trying their best. You’re both tired. You’re both guessing. If something needs to be addressed, like you saying “no bottle” and five minutes later they hand one over like a rogue dairy dealer, talk about it calmly. Explain the “why,” listen to each other, and pretend you’re in a gentle parenting commercial for adults.
Because if you spilled milk and your partner snapped, you’d shut down. But if they laughed and said, “Rough day?” you’d feel understood. Perspective is everything. Marriage is basically 50% forgiveness, 50% noticing the bottle valve is missing… again.


6. *Taking your baby to dinner is absolutely an option.*
If you need to escape the house and feel like a real human, bring the baby. Up to around 8 months, they don’t talk, they’re pacifier-powered, and everything is interesting. We’ve taken our daughter out since she was two months old, and now at six months she lives for restaurants and new adventures. She’s basically the Beyoncé of brunch.


7. *Try to avoid Googling milestone charts.*
Those charts will have you diagnosing your baby with 47 conditions before your coffee gets cold. Babies hit milestones whenever they feel like it. Some crawl at 5 months, some at 9. Some still flop like a baby seal at five months (my mom showed me tummy time using a rolled up towel a week after my daughter was born. Start early!).
I became a Google doctor for a while and wasted so much energy worrying about totally normal variations. Trust nature and evolution, they’ve been doing this longer than any blog. And if you do get anxious, use ChatGPT or whatever AI you like. It gathers info from the whole web and gives you the answer without sending you on a 27-tab panic spree. Saves time and sanity.

In hindsight, these were the most important factors in getting to a better head space/perspective. Anyone feel free to add in the comments.

Good luck and God speed my fellow parents. You got this. 🙏❤️

F22,"Hi, this is long but I need to get it out. I grew up deeply religious, with my parents fully practicing and raising me and my siblings in the tradition. My mom converted before marriage and before having my brothers and I, which sometimes makes me unsure how others in the faith, including potential partners, would react, since some families aren’t as accepting of converts. I also spent time with some extended family who follow a different religion, and I have a piece of jewelry from them that is sentimental, not religious.

A few months ago, I met someone at a coffee shop who seemed perfect. He told me he was 27, I later found out he was 29 but it didn’t matter to me.At first, he was very into me, texting constantly and showing a lot of chemistry. That same weekend, I spent time with family and wore my sentimental jewelry. I sent him a photo wearing it, and after that his behavior changed. He became distant, canceled plans, and eventually told me he couldn’t take me seriously because his religion expects him to marry within the faith and he couldn’t take me seriously, I asked if we could meet to talk about it but I didn’t have the guts to tell him. We met in person afterward, but I didn’t have the courage to fully explain myself. There were moments of closeness, but also weirdness, we made jokes about me being a non-member and I told him my dad was of his religion/culture but never revealed my
mom converted as well. I eventually stopped reaching out.

About a month later (a weeks ago) he contacted me out of the blue and invited me over. He was a little cold, making jokes about my background, which I didn’t correct because I was unsure how he or his family would react. I even took off my jewelry of our religion before going. I didn’t share the full truth about myself, though he noticed it indirectly. After that visit, we haven’t spoken.

I can’t stop thinking about him and I want him. I’ve been considering telling him the truth, but I’m terrified he’ll think I lied or that it won’t change how he feels. I don’t know how or if I should tell him.

Is it always best to tell the truth, or conceal my identity to keep the little bit of him i’m clinging on to?

TL;DR: I met someone amazing, he got distant when he thought I wasn’t from the same religion, I didn’t clarify that I actually am, and now I’m scared to tell him the truth but can’t stop thinking about him.",0,1765198298.0,relationship_advice,18,0.25,False

These cases are not merely popular claims; they correspond to concrete food use, nutrient contribution, or practical substitution under scarcity. A concise list follows, ordered by recurrent functional relevance:

1. **Dandelion** associated with liver support; roots and leaves used beyond casual foraging.
2. **Chicory** roasted root historically used as a coffee substitute with digestive effects linked to inulin.
3. **Wild Rose (rosehips)** notable vitamin C source with established traditional use.
4. **Burdock root** consistently treated as an edible root in traditional cuisines, not only medicinal.
5. **Cattail** young shoots edible; roots can be processed into flour in resource-limited contexts.
6. **Plantain** provides protein and fiber; documented as a usable food component.
7. **Wild Lettuce** referenced for natural analgesic properties in historical accounts.

These examples illustrate plants with documented roles in actual food preparation or functional substitution when conventional supplies are absent, representing practical options rather than speculative survival myths. source [Foraging secrets book](https://foragingsecrets.com/cb-foraging-secretshb2x5g6?&shield=4d90e6kcwhef1vbawehbkdjx5c&ad=Uk)",4,1765198011.0,Survival,5,0.67,False

I don’t post much, but I wanted to share this for anyone who is still struggling. 

The last 5 years were full of attempts that didn’t last — 5 days, 10 days, a couple weeks, even a few long stretches… and then back to drinking again. I spent years thinking I’d never actually break the cycle. I worried about my health, and honestly, I felt scared that I was running out of chances.

My drinking wasn’t dramatic or public. I drank at night, alone, and I functioned during the day, so no one really knew how bad it was except for my spouse.

The early part of sobriety was messy — lots of sugar, coffee, lots of trying to get through evenings however I could. But I kept trying. Even when I slipped. Even when it felt impossible. And somehow, slowly, things changed. Today is 6 months.

If you’re struggling, or restarting for the tenth or hundredth time, please don’t count yourself out. I truly thought I would never get here, and now I’m starting to believe I could reach a year.

If you’re trying — even imperfectly — you’re already on the path. Don’t give up on yourself or give up hope - keep going if you can. ♥️

1phbgpz,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1phbgpz/transcis_dating_advice_please/,"Trans-cis “dating” advice, please?","
Hi all! I am hoping someone can help me figure some things out about how to best continue to approach someone whom I have grown to like very much and with whom I hope to get closer in the future. Before I give you more context on this, I want to add that I have been listening to podcasts and reading books about Trans experiences, and now I am here looking for other’s experiences that may help me or give me greater insights. I understand that _everyone_ is a world on their own, and “my” person here is as well. I am just hoping to gain greater insight and nuance. 

So I (mid-40s cis F) met a Non-Binary Trans person (mid-30s) some three months ago. They live a few hours away and come to my town for work about 1-2 per month, and when they do, they stay 2-3 nights at the beginning of the week. If it matters, we met through a mutual friend who put us in touch. We hit it off as fast friends do. The following month they asked to go out for dinner, and y’all we had the best time. I know I did, and I’m sure they did too. I saw them again before they left for a quick coffee a couple of days later, and we once again had a great time talking, laughing and flirting. Then they left, we texted the rest of the day and the morning of the next day… and then they went silent for some 5 days. After that they popped up as if nothing happened. Communication cooled, also but not only because of me. (Yes, I have abandonment issues, and sudden disappearance can trigger them. I am working on it.) 

The next time they were here, I was not. 

A couple of weeks later I was in their town, we got together for coffee, had a heart to heart of sorts, and got back on the joking and flirting. It was an intimate, vulnerable and fun conversation. Texts were not exchanged after. 

Then they were back in my town last week, but we only coincided one day. We went for coffee, had an amazing time and flirted HARD. We both knew what we were doing and we both enjoyed it tremendously. It was like we were 15 with all the staring in silence and nervousness. We kept texting throughout that day… and now they disappeared again. They are not coming back until February. 

I am disheartened by the possibility of not hearing from them until then, and I also understand that they may need, more so than want, space until then. Hell, maybe they are in a relationship in their town, but I am choosing not to focus on that option. 

In our heart to heart in their town they brought up important aspects of their life, including different forms of insecurity (jobs, living situations, relationships with people in their life), and they kind of called me out on my own privileges (merited and realistic, and no complaints from me) without accusing me. I understood this “call out” as them wanting me to expand my views so I could understand them better.  I am beyond fortunate and in many ways privileged. Again, I took that part of our conversation to be an acknowledgment of who I am and a request for how to see them. 

I usually do not care for relationships. I consider myself demi first, pan second. Before I met them and went out with them, I had no interest in going on dates, dating someone regularly, thinking about building something with someone, etc. I quite enjoy my life as I have made it, and in general, I have little reason to change much in it. The past 15 or so years, I have not met anyone I felt attracted to or interested in, and I am very much okay with that. I have been on a date or two here and there, and honestly did not care much for them (I wish the people I went out with all the best). 

The situation with this person is different, and I would like to create the conditions where they feel safe with me and they can be more open. I don’t really know what is the best way to bridge what may be sensitive subjects or at least invite them to share if and when they are comfortable with it. 

I am VERY worried about the age difference. It is “only” about 10 years (a bit over 11, if you want to be exact), and I don’t have a ton of experience with relationships. I put those two factors together because they may very well have more experience than me. I also have never dated a trans person, and while I am occasionally social with a couple of Trans people, our relationship is not solid enough for me to approach them freely with questions. In my opinion, in 2025 one can go to the internet for questions before burdening others. 

Is there anything you think, as a Trans person or an ally or someone who has dated Trans people as a cis person, that I should keep in mind? I know this person might be going hot and cold because they are seeing someone else, and I hope they are not. In the meantime, since I choose to believe they are wanting to figure themselves out and what they want with me, I want to be a better ally and potential future partner-or-something. I suppose more so than specific questions, I would like to know what people who have been in situations more or less like this have gone through. 

Thank you very much for reading all the way here and I appreciate your testimony, suggestions, advice, etc. ",1,1765197865.0,asktransgender,2,1.0,False

I watched for like three hours while drinking my coffee and reading and not one person came to these three specific chairs under the best umbrella. So around 11:30 I finally got annoyed becuase the sun was blazing and I just moved their stuff neatly to a side table and sat down to relax. Well let me tell you about an hour later this massive family comes waltzing in acting like they own the place. The mom literally shrieked when she saw me. She started yelling that her husband woke up at dawn to save those spots and I’m a ""thief"" for moving their magazines.

She demanded I move and even tried to get security involved but the guard just looked at her like she was crazy since policy says you cant reserve seats for more than 30 mins unattended.

1phbggh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1phbggh/whats_a_reasonable_expectation_around_cleaning_up/,What’s a reasonable expectation around cleaning up after yourself for a 4 year old?,"So my thought with my son is that if he makes a mess, he should at the very least help clean it up. The problem is that 90% of the time we can’t get him to cooperate. Basic things like wiping up spills or throwing away a wrapper he can do, but he gets super overwhelmed by almost anything harder than that. And he is not a neat kid. He loves to dump whatever he can get his hands on, which has led to us keeping a ton of stuff locked up because if we try to make him pick it up, he won’t do it. We’ve been doing a toy rotation with very few toys to make cleanup easier, but he likes to play with basically anything that he can lift. So even though we just have a couple small bins of toys, he’ll use blankets, pillows, books, boxes, the vacuum, dishes, and any furniture he’s capable of moving like kitchen chairs and the coffee table to build a fort or a ship or a zoo or a castle. I think his imagination is great. What’s not great is having a 5’x5’ pile of junk taking up my whole living room and he won’t help pick up a single item. 


So far we’ve tried showing him how to clean up and giving specific instructions, cleaning up alongside him, using timers and giving frequent reminders, making it into a game, and having cleaning up be a part of our routine every night. But what usually happens is that after complaining and protesting he might pick up one thing, then by the second thing he’s gotten distracted and started playing and taking things out again instead of picking up. If we make it into a game, it might work once but when he figures out the game is cleaning up he no longer wants to. If we offer to help, we end up picking up everything we said we would and he picks up nothing. Timers and reminders he ignores. And we’ve had cleanup time as a part of our evening routine for over a year. We’ve also tried giving the consequence of “if toys are left out after cleanup time, they’ll get put away into storage”. Which creates a tantrum, or he’ll get so overwhelmed and say he can’t do it. Honestly if we had that consequence every night I think he’d have no toys left by the end of the week. But even that doesn’t solve our problem when he’ll gladly just grab every random item he can reach to play with them. My husband and I are kind of at our wits end at this point because we’re constantly cleaning up after our son and he can destroy a room again in five minutes. And we feel like we’re doing all the right things that people say to do without any success. Is there something we’re missing here? Is this a phase?",3,1765197845.0,Parenting,12,1.0,False

I am concerned about the new girl Athena. While she has worked as a clerical temp, she has not said much but has shown a disturbing interest in our security arrangements. According to the books, she has limited clearance only.

I can't fault her work. Her archival skills are precise and she is meticulous. She types at a speed that is so fast; it is unhuman. 

Her attire is starched military, yet she attracts much attention from the lads with top secret clearance, making them perhaps a little too glib about the particulars of our spy ops. Put plainly, she looks like a Miss Universe contestant with a Cretan cast.

While my initial reservations are that she is not a security risk, I have a nervous feeling when she makes coffee and stacks files with the precise, and deft movements of a martial artist.

But there is the cabinet incident. A dolly collided with a cabinet, bringing it down. That cabinet must weigh more than a ton, stacked with disks and reels. Yet Athena caught it with one hand and righted it without any show of effort.

I swear she must be one of our enhanced military grade ops, but we have no records of her.

Then there is the envious spite dealt to her by other female staff, yet she offers no defence of herself. As a woman, she is so free of backbiting, and that must be truly impossible. This is the clincher.

I have assigned her Code 10 special surveillance. I need to know her real purpose. If my insane suspicions are to be confirmed, this elegant and deadly temp is some kind of [..............] Woman.

1phbdyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialmedia/comments/1phbdyj/3_ways_content_creators_boost_retention/,3 ways content creators boost retention,"One thing I love about studying how growing creators and entrepreneurs approach customer retention is that they’re often more innovative than what a lot of bigger brands are doing.

Three creators we work with recently shared how they're bridging physical and digital experiences, and I wanted to share some of them with y’all:

**1. Packaging as an experience extension**

Ally Blaire runs a handmade stationery and craft kit business. Instead of treating packaging as just protective material, she's embedded interactive elements throughout. Her thank-you cards double as art prints and unlock digital freebies. Her punch needle kits include instruction sheets that link to exclusive video tutorials she created specifically for customers.

Why this works: She's not trying to drive people back to a generic landing page. Each interaction serves the moment the customer is actually in (unboxing, learning a new craft, discovering something unexpected).

**2. Event gamification that actually converts**

Monica Razak (Monica's Collective) created a scavenger hunt system for her pop-up booths. Attendees hunt for hidden codes throughout her booth, and each one unlocks something (a discount, a fun fact about her process, or a clue to the next location). She also used the same approach when relocating to a new city, posting codes around coffee shops and gyms that led curious locals to her shop announcement.

Why this works: She turned browsing into active participation. Instead of hoping people remember her booth among dozens of others, she gave them a reason to engage deeply and immediately.

**3. Live event enhancement without overcomplicating**

Melissa Carnegie runs Kicks & Fros, a community platform for Black and Brown women in sneaker culture. At her events, attendees can access style inspiration before customizing their sneakers, shop exclusive merch in real-time, or get sneaker care tips, all through strategically placed interactive touchpoints.

Why this works: She's meeting people where they already are (at her event, engaged and excited) and layering in value without requiring them to leave the experience or remember to do something later.

**The pattern across all three:**

They're all transforming what would normally be passive moments (unboxing a product, walking past a booth, attending an event) into active engagement opportunities. None of these required massive budgets. They just required thinking beyond the immediate transaction to the full customer journey.

After managing multi-day content campaigns and virtual events with much larger budgets, I find it fascinating how these creators are achieving strong retention with scrappy, well-timed touchpoints. The constraint of being small seems to force more creative thinking about where and how to add value.

Anyone else noticing this shift with smaller creators out-executing bigger brands on customer experience?",10,1765197633.0,socialmedia,3,1.0,False

1phbbz4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_porticocaribbean/comments/1phbbz4/unlocking_intercaribbean_mobility_economic/,Unlocking Inter-Caribbean Mobility: Economic Opportunities and Smart Ways to Make Money,"Inter-Caribbean mobility — the movement of people, goods, and services across the Caribbean region — is not only a cultural and social imperative but also a powerful economic opportunity. As regional integration efforts grow and travel becomes more accessible, entrepreneurs and professionals alike are beginning to tap into the potential of a more connected Caribbean.

But mobility isn’t just about physical travel — it’s also about how people move ideas, capital, talent, and innovation across borders. This article explores the current state of inter-Caribbean mobility and outlines practical, actionable ways to make money in this emerging regional market.

The Opportunity of Inter-Caribbean Mobility

The Caribbean region, while made up of many small island nations and territories, shares similar economic, linguistic, and cultural roots. Historically, however, economic cooperation has been hampered by:

High intra-regional flight costs

Inconsistent trade policies

Weak infrastructure and logistics

Visa and work permit restrictions

Recent efforts by CARICOM, the OECS, and initiatives like the Caribbean Single Market and Economy (CSME) are helping to ease these barriers, particularly for travel, work permits, and digital business.

This opens up a wealth of opportunities for savvy entrepreneurs who understand regional trends and are ready to move.

7 Ways to Make Money with Inter-Caribbean Mobility

1. Remote Services Marketplace

With the rise of digital nomadism and remote work, there’s an untapped opportunity to build or join regional freelancing marketplaces that connect Caribbean talent to regional clients.

Ideas:

Launch a platform to connect freelancers in Trinidad with clients in Barbados.

Offer translation, design, or coding services across islands.

Leverage remittances by offering financial or tax consulting for remote workers.

Why it works: Caribbean professionals are increasingly looking for remote income streams, while small businesses need flexible help but lack access to skilled talent nearby.

2. Regional E-commerce & Logistics

Start an e-commerce or logistics business that makes it easier to ship goods between islands.

Ideas:

Build a courier or freight consolidation service to reduce high shipping costs.

Curate Caribbean-made products and ship regionally via an online store.

Partner with artisan cooperatives across islands to sell handmade goods.

Pro tip: Target high-margin goods such as cosmetics, fashion, or specialty foods (hot sauce, chocolate, coffee).

3. Pop-Up Retail & Micro-Franchising

The mobility of small brands between islands is an under-exploited strategy.

Ideas:

Launch a mobile pop-up shop that rotates between St. Lucia, Grenada, and Dominica.

License a popular food concept from one island and run it on another under a micro-franchise model.

Test seasonal products in tourist-heavy islands (e.g., Christmas goods in Jamaica, Carnival goods in Trinidad).

Why it works: Small-scale retail allows experimentation without needing a permanent location — ideal for fragmented island markets.

4. Digital Content Creation for Regional Audiences

If you’re good at content, you can build a pan-Caribbean audience through blogging, YouTube, TikTok, or newsletters.

Ideas:

Launch a YouTube channel on Caribbean business and travel hacks.

Start a newsletter covering startup news from across the region.

Produce travel vlogs or cooking shows that feature different islands.

Monetization: Sponsorships, affiliate marketing, tourism partnerships, or selling digital products (ebooks, guides).

5. Online Education & Upskilling

Caribbean workers are hungry for career mobility and upskilling — especially if it helps them move or work across the region.

Ideas:

Create online courses in areas with regional demand (hospitality tech, small business marketing, renewable energy).

Run cohort-based programs to prepare young professionals for regional roles.

Offer English/Spanish/French/Creole language prep for job seekers.

Bonus: Partner with regional universities or development banks for grants and funding.

6. Talent Arbitrage & Recruitment

Build a business that helps Caribbean businesses hire talent from other islands.

Ideas:

Recruit nurses from Guyana to work in The Bahamas.

Help hotels in Barbados fill seasonal roles with trained workers from Suriname.

Offer talent management platforms with inter-island job boards.

Why it’s powerful: Labor shortages are common in sectors like health, tourism, and agriculture — while underemployment persists elsewhere in the region.

7. Mobility-Focused Fintech or Insurtech

Caribbean mobility is creating new needs in payments, remittances, and mobile banking.

Ideas:

Create a digital wallet or neobank that works across islands.

Launch travel insurance tailored to inter-island travelers and workers.

Offer credit-building tools for professionals working across borders.

Funding tip: These types of ventures are often eligible for support from regional development banks (e.g., CDB, IDB) or accelerators like Founder Institute or TechBeach.

Key Tips for Success

Focus on one customer segment first — e.g., traveling nurses or remote creatives — and expand regionally later.

Simplify your business model: Investors and customers want to see clarity, not complexity.

Partner with local allies: Build trust and navigate regulations through local relationships.

Pitch smart: Fundraising across the region can be hard — structure your pitch using proven frameworks like Problem/Solution or Vision/Opportunity.

Adapt your brand: Keep messaging relevant for each island’s culture and language nuances.

Conclusion

Inter-Caribbean mobility is more than a buzzword — it’s a foundational shift in how Caribbean economies will grow in the next decade. For founders and creatives who can navigate the islands, the rewards are significant.

Whether you want to build a logistics network, launch a regional e-commerce brand, or connect talent with opportunity, the doors are slowly opening. The next wave of Caribbean entrepreneurs will be those who embrace movement — physically, digitally, and economically.

1phbbef,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1phbbef,Amba Bhavan Coffee Club - Simplicity At Its Best,"While names such as Cafe Madras and Ram Ashray have become very popular some places that remain less popular but are so wonderful and simple that these need special mention and deserve more recognition than they have so far. One such place is Amba Bhavan Coffee Club. Located on the road going to Matunga market from the gardener at the circle, this humble joint can be easily missed if you do not pay attention. Caution ⛔️ - the joint remains closed from 12:30 pm to 3:30 pm and shuts at 8:00 pm - YES! As unbelievable as this sounds it’s a fact. So best time to go is say 7:30 am or so or evening 6:00 pm. The place is shut on Thursdays, unlike Mondays when most shops in the area. On Monday you get some amazing Rawa Idli with white butter in evening but it’s limited quantities need you to be there by 5 pm or so to get them hot. The Idli, Dosa and Medu wadas are awesome. One also gets amazing Dal Wada or masala Wada as some call it. Kadhi Wada and a great Ulundu. One important Sambhar isn’t sweet so those expecting this sorry to be disappointed but the place is authentic. You may request for a thick chutney and the waiters will oblige. What I recommend is to mix the chutney and Sambhar in a separate small ‘wati’ and try. Something magical happens when you mix these two. Yes the quintessential Gun Powder with Ghee or oil is available. What you cannot miss here though is the Ghee Sada and Coffee. I recommend you not to mess with the Barista’s equation by asking strong or mild coffee. Sugar is added separately so you can adjust that. Tea is good too. On the Dosa, those who are born in South Indian families or have had relatives or neighbours who are South Indians will appreciate how homely the Dosa is. I can have 3 or 4, not likely in other joints. Occasionally they have sweets such as Mohan Puri and Janghdi which you can enjoy too. The place is simple. The food deliberately has less salt 🧂. The quality is excellent and quantity is adequate. So go and enjoy but keep the open and close timings in mind. It’s simple and it’s absolutely fab and one more time - mix sambhar and chutney before you eat with the dosa and try the gun powder (malgapodi) on the side. ",20,1765197415.0,mumbaiFood,4,0.96,False

On Sunday, the House released the multibillion-dollar National Defense Authorization Act, which was finalized after weeks of negotiations between GOP leadership and rank-and-file lawmakers.© U.S. Air Force via Associated Press](https://preview.redd.it/57q3jpqh0z5g1.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1d4ec415893d8a6acc3a5e8b35ad86c57ca234f)

WASHINGTON — Congressional leaders [released the text](https://rules.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/rules.house.gov/files/documents/rcp_xml-2.pdf) of its defense and national security package on Sunday evening, eyeing a vote as early as this week to pass its annual legislation authorizing the Pentagon budget.

The multibillion-dollar National Defense Authorization Act was finalized after weeks of negotiations between GOP leadership and rank-and-file Republicans, totaling about $8 billion more than what was initially requested in the president’s budget. The House will move forward with a vote in the coming days, according to Republican leadership aides.

“This legislation includes important House-passed provisions to ensure our military forces remain the most lethal in the world and can deter any adversary,” House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement. “It roots out Biden-era wokeism in our military and restores merit-based promotions and admissions to service academies, prohibits contracts with partisan firms, counters antisemitism, and halts harmful, unnecessary programs like CRT, DEI, and climate initiatives.”

The 3,086-page bill encompasses multiple provisions aimed toward strengthening security at the southern border, revitalizing the defense industrial base, and undoing certain Pentagon policies enacted during the Biden administration that current officials consider to be “woke ideology.”

The bill codifies at least 15 of President Donald Trump’s executive orders, including those related to building physical barriers and deploying more troops to the southern border; constructing the Golden Dome missile defense system; and modernizing the development of weapons, among other things.  *(article shortened)...*

# Quick summary — relevant items found:

1. **RDT&E / Program funding lines that explicitly call out “Critical Minerals” (and “Critical Minerals for Energy Storage Solutions”)** — **PDF page \~1953 (RDT&E funding table; line entry shows “Critical Minerals” / “Critical Minerals for Energy Storage Solutions”).** *Why it matters:* funds in these program lines support R&D for critical-minerals technologies and supply-chain efforts that could be a source of DoD/DoD-partner R&D support relevant to materials like Nb, Ti, Sc, and REE processing/manufacturing. (Amounts are shown in the RDT&E funding tables — amounts in the tables are in **thousands of dollars**.) [rules.house.gov](https://rules.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/rules.house.gov/files/documents/rcp_xml-2.pdf)
2. **“Rare Earth Magnet Manufacturing” listed in the industrial-base / program funding table** — **PDF page \~1955 (Industrial base / Operational System Development funding table: “Rare Earth Magnet Manufacturing” — listed as an item).** *Why it matters:* Direct mention of magnet manufacturing indicates explicit Congressional support/funding lines for domestic rare-earth magnet work (which directly maps to Nd/Pr, and to downstream magnet manufacture). That can create procurement and partnership opportunities for domestic REE supply chain participants. [rules.house.gov](https://rules.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/rules.house.gov/files/documents/rcp_xml-2.pdf)
3. **Defense Production Act (DPA) — extension and related reporting provisions** — **SEC. 8101 — DPA of 1950 extension (amends section 717(a) to extend authorities to Sept 30, 2026). — PDF page \~2713.** — **SEC. 8102 — Adds reporting / list of national-security sensitive sites to DPA / CFIUS reporting (reporting / site list language). — PDF page \~2714.** *Why it matters:* The DPA (and particularly Title III authorities under the DPA) are the primary federal authorities for industrial base incentives, loan guarantees, purchase/stockpiling, and surge production support. The NDAA here extends the DPA authorities and tightens reporting / site review language — important because it preserves the vehicle (and oversight architecture) Congress and DoD use to support domestic critical-minerals facilities. (I saw no amendment here that directly adds a new Title-III purchase program targeted at a specific mineral — but the extension keeps authorities alive.) [rules.house.gov](https://rules.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/rules.house.gov/files/documents/rcp_xml-2.pdf)
4. **Sense of Congress / direction to investment/corporate entities to prioritize critical minerals supply chains** — **PDF page \~3038 (Sense of Congress urging a Corporation to consider advancing secure supply chains to meet U.S. and allies’ critical minerals needs).** *Why it matters:* This is policy language directing entities (and signaling to federal programs) to prioritize critical-minerals supply chains — an enabling signal for future grant, loan, or contracting priorities that would benefit domestic producers (Nb, Sc, Ti, REEs) if adopted into program execution.

https://reddit.com/link/1phb7r8/video/yn880niy1z5g1/player

\*\*SIMI VALLEY, Calif.—\*\*The Golden Dome air and missile defense shield to protect the United States will have some “operational capability” in 2028, the program’s leader said Dec. 6 at the [Reagan National Defense Forum here.](https://www.reaganfoundation.org/events/2025-reagan-national-defense-forum)

“It will not be the final capability. But we will have the ability to protect and defend the nation against advanced threats by the [summer of 2028](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/article/realistic-expectations-for-golden-dome-by-2028/),” Space Force Gen. Michael A. Guetlein, the officer in charge of the program, said of the ambitious effort championed by President Donald Trump.

Guetlein acknowledged the complexity of the task but said a “solid plan” is already in place.

“We believe we can get there,” Guetlein said. “I think we’re on a good trajectory, but I will tell you, it is not a ‘gimme putt.’ It is an extremely complex thing that we’re getting ready to do, and there’s a lot of risk in there.”

The Pentagon has said little publicly about the challenging program, and it is still unclear what it will exactly entail, though the ultimate cost is expected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars.

“There are likely people in that audience that I don’t want to know what we’re doing,” said Guetlein, defending the secrecy. “I’m still hoping that we can start opening up dialogue in the new year.”

While little information has been [publicly released](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/space-force-first-contracts-golden-dome-space-based-interceptors/), more details are being shared on a classified basis with defense firms and Congress, Guetlein said on a panel with Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink, Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), and Northrop Grumman CEO Kathy Warden. Fischer, who is chair of the Senate Armed Services Strategic Forces subcommittee, said she was satisfied with the information she has received.

The project, which was established by an executive order that Trump [issued in January](https://www.airandspaceforces.com/trump-iron-dome-america-space-force/), is designed to expand the system that was designed to defend against North Korea’s ballistic missiles and other modest threats into a system that can defeat more advanced and numerous ballistic missiles, hypersonic weapons, cruise missiles, multiple sizes of drones, and more novel threats such as fractional orbital bombardment systems.

A new web of sensors, interceptors, and command-and-control capabilities is expected to make up the system, including space-based interceptors and data-transfer and missile-warning satellites.

Guetlein reports directly to Deputy Secretary of Defense Steve Feinberg, giving him authority over much of the program’s structure. Golden Dome will not be a built-from-scratch project, Guetlein said, and will use existing systems and programs being pursued by the services.

“We are focused on the entire homeland, to include Hawaii, Alaska, and Guam,” he said. “We won’t bring all that to bear immediately. The Army is already working really diligently to protect Guam today. When they have got that capability in place, it will become part of Golden Dome.”

Golden Dome is just one of a number of high priority defense programs being pursued amid considerable uncertainty about what the Pentagon spending levels will be in future years, to include across-the-board nuclear modernization; a major shipbuilding program; the Air Force’s F-47 fighter, and more.

“We received a historic boost in funding last year, and believe that is only just the beginning,” Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told the forum, referring to the $156 billion budget reconciliation legislation that was added to the DOD’s proposed budget for 2026.

But it remains unclear what spending levels will be in future years to advance programs that have also been dogged by inflation.

“Have we made a decision yet on another reconciliation bill? No, we have not. We will make sure that we continue to grow. There will not be a hole there,” Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought told the forum.

Though few details about Golden Dome have been released, Guetlein provided the most detailed public accounting of the program to date.

Guetlein said work has begun on novel capabilities, such as space-based interceptors. According to the general, 18 Other Transaction Agreements have been awarded for space-based interceptors. So-called OTAs are a flexible type of government-industry arrangement designed to advance technology, rather than procure a specific weapons system. Space System Command announced the deals in late November, though it did not say how many contracts were awarded.

“That’s now off and moving,” Guetlein said.

As for more traditional interceptors, Guetlein said that Feinberg’s office is “working really, really hard to scale out the industrial base … to expand the magazine depth of our weapons” and that the Golden Dome office has “injected our requirements into that process.” Even before Golden Dome, the U.S. military already had a high demand for more interceptors for the THAAD and Patriot ballistic missile defense systems.

“They are already moving out on acquiring the interceptors that we need for Golden Dome,” Guetlein said, without naming specific systems.

Trump’s executive order, which predated Guetlein’s role, also highlighted Space Force sensing and data transport efforts.

“We are in discussions with the department on the need to acquire more transport capability, which is the ability to move data through space, more sensing capability, more missile warning \[and\] missile track capability. We are waiting on those contracts to come in and to be able to move forward on those, but we have given our needs to the department.,” Guetlein said.

Meink, acknowledging the Department of Air Force’s role as one of “providers” to Golden Dome, said he and Guetlein “talk a lot about those schedules” regarding the capabilities the Space Force and Air Force may contribute.

Guetlein said tangible efforts were also underway on the architecture’s backbone.

“We have a team of industry partners working on the command and control and fire control software already. We’re on-ramping others into that,” he said. “So we have already moved out … on our contracting strategy.”

# ~THE MATERIALS BACKBONE OF AMERICA’S NEW MISSILE SHIELD — WHY GOLDEN DOME QUIETLY POINTS TO NIOCORP

The Golden Dome missile-defense initiative outlined at the Reagan National Defense Forum is the most explicit confirmation yet that the Pentagon is preparing to rebuild America’s advanced-materials base at scale. Golden Dome requires a vast expansion of interceptors, hypersonic defenses, HALE drones, hardened C2 nodes, and space-based platforms\*\*—each one heavily dependent on Niobium alloys, Titanium metal, Scandium-aluminum structural materials, and high-performance Rare-Earth magnets.\*\* These four DFARS-critical inputs form the exact specialty product suite Niocorp is preparing to produce domestically at Elk Creek, making the project not just a mining effort but a national-security keystone.

***The strategic overlap becomes even clearer when noting that Sen. Deb Fischer—Nebraska’s senior senator and chair of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee—appeared on the same panel discussing Golden Dome.*** Fischer previously secured the $10M Title III award for NioCorp’s scandium program, giving her an unusually deep understanding of the supply-chain vulnerabilities that Golden Dome must solve. With the Pentagon openly scaling industrial capacity for interceptors, sensors, and space-based kill vehicles, inside-the-U.S. sources of Nb, Ti, Sc, Nd, Pr, Dy, and Tb become mandatory, not optional—and NioCorp is the only domestic project capable of supplying that entire suite of SEVEN critical minerals at industrial volumes!

This directly intersects with EXIM’s pending financing decision. The bank only supports projects with clear strategic justification, and Golden Dome provides exactly that: a multi-decade, high-volume demand signal for DFARS-compliant alloys and magnet oxides. NioCorp’s recent acquisition of IP to produce Sc-Al alloys directly from oxide further cements its role as a future defense supplier, enabling the U.S. to stand up a brand-new, clean, high-throughput scandium-aluminum facility—something essential for lightweight interceptor bodies, space-based platforms, and high-end guidance systems. **EXIM’s public praise of Elk Creek, ahead of final approval, reads as a deliberate pre-alignment of U.S. industrial policy before Golden Dome’s supply chain goes live.**

The bottom line: Golden Dome\~ needs a rebuilt U.S. materials foundation, and Elk Creek is positioned to help anchor that foundation. The alignment of timelines—Golden Dome ramping from 2027–2030 and NioCorp targeted for 2028-2029 production—combined with Fischer’s involvement, EXIM’s engagement, the new Sc-Al IP, and the Pentagon’s urgent need for Nb, Ti, Sc, and REEs, signals that NioCorp is being viewed as a future national champion in America’s next-generation missile-defense architecture. In short: Golden Dome needs these materials—and the only place to source them domestically, at scale, is NioCorp.

This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty — not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once.

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.**  
The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

# NioCorp isn’t just part of the solution — it’s the platform the solution gets built on!

KRAFTWERK

Autobahn

(Philips, November 1974)

By Rex Howler
Music and Culture

This is not an album.

This is a commuter loop with delusions of humanity.

You hit play on Autobahn and there it is — that immaculate mechanical pulse clicking into motion like the world’s politest heart attack — and suddenly you’re no longer listening to music so much as being processed by it.

Rock used to sweat. Kraftwerk doesn’t sweat — it hums.

The title track runs twenty-three minutes, which is not a composition so much as a demonstration of endurance. No climax. No collapse. Just pristine, obedient movement — the sonic equivalent of an office corridor where the carpet has never seen a coffee stain and the doors never lead anywhere except more doors.

This isn’t hypnotic repetition. This is paperwork that learned how to sing. The melody appears only long enough to be clock-punched, laminated, and filed back into the loop.

And the voices — oh man, the voices — drifting in like public announcement ghosts: “We are driving, driving…” — yes boys, we know, you sound like you’re narrating your own dull extinction.

That’s the genius of this thing:

They aren’t opposing the machine.
They’ve become its house band.

Where American rock still pretends to be storming the corporate bastille with beer fumes and power chords, Kraftwerk rented a conference room, brought snacks, and said, “Fine, let’s make the machine beautiful.”

And — nightmare of nightmares — they succeeded.

This record sounds incredible. Clean as a scalpel. Nothing spills. Nothing bleeds. Improvisation has been put on probation. Error has been fired.

Human warmth?
Wrong department.

Everything that once made rock sound dangerous — digression, ego, sloppiness, joy — has been quietly escorted out of the building.

You don’t feel rebellious listening to this album.

You feel efficient.

You could alphabetize your record collection to this thing. Balance your checkbook. Schedule the rest of your life in fifteen-minute blocks. The rhythm doesn’t invite movement — it invites compliance.

Autobahn isn’t a warning siren about the future.

It’s the calm, satisfied tone a system emits after it already owns you.

And this is the part that chills the blood:

Nobody forced it.

Nobody coerced it.

Art just wandered willingly into the process flow chart, looked around at those gleaming precision gears, and said:

“Hey — we can work with this.”

Kraftwerk didn’t sell out.

They optimized.

They showed us what happens when art stops throwing punches and starts carrying a clipboard.

This is the sound of creativity abandoning the mess of feeling and enrolling in operations management.

You won’t rage against the machine listening to this album.

You’ll start humming along with its maintenance cycle.

Verdict:
Autobahn is the most hypnotically accurate portrait of our coming procedural age — music for the moment when expression becomes continuous operation and the human hand stops playing in favor of monitoring the display panel instead.

He's sort of my boss (or co-boss, his mum is the manager of a family owned small business that I work for) so I work with him once-twice a week, and every time, I feel like there's this tension that I don't really know how to describe. We have pretty good banter and make a lot of jokes, but I feel like he treats me different to some of my other coworkers and I can't think of any other reason. He might see me as a sort of 'little sister' figure because I am more than 5 years younger than him, and I work with his mum as well (my boss) so maybe there's subconsciously a family dynamic going on that I haven't realised yet.

He asked what I did in my spare time and I said I liked dancing/ going to the gym and he said that I seemed pretty fit. Today during my shift, he asked if I went running and I said I did and asked him if he ran, and he said that we should go on a run to see who's faster.

He asked if my parents were strict, and what I asked what he meant, he asked if they'd care if I have a boyfriend/ever had a boyfriend before. The other day, he asked one of my closest friends that had started working with me if I'd ever had a boyfriend, and apparantely she told him that I hadn't because I'm a weirdo (love her lol). I jokingly said that I wish had a boyfriend and he said that I shouldn't and that being single is underrated. He said he was single because he was weird too.

He says hi (my name) every time he sees me for the first time that shift and bye (my name), although he usually just says bye in general to all the other coworkers like 'bye guys.' He's also called me by a nickname a few times, and none of my other coworkers do.

Every shift, we get one free iced coffee drink of our choice, and he remembers my coffee order every time even when I switch it for hot/cold weather. One long shift, he kept trying to offer me another free drink after I'd already had my first, and ended up making me one even when I said no.

We were joking around the other day and I tried making him fall for the 'what's updog' joke. He responded by trying to make me say the 'what's upsexy' joke.

He noticed when I got a new ear piercing even though it's a small one on my upper helix.

He always says 'thanks' when I do something really basic like take a coffee to a customer's table, help make cold drinks or do the dishes even though that's the most basic part of my job and literally what I'm being paid to do...

Recently, I feel like I'm going crazy but I feel like I always make eye contact with him without even meaning to. Like I'll look over at the counter to see if there are any customers or just look up from washing the dishes and make direct eye contact with him somehow. I can't avoid it but I'm really not good at eye contact so I feel so embarrassed and awkward every time.

He does this odd fake punching thing - idk how to describe it, but like shadow boxing I guess. I don't really know how to interpret it.

I only message him through messages/whatsapp to do things like telling him my availability/confirming shifts because he sends messages to all the workers for his mum who isn't very good at speaking english. But even so, his texts are akways lowkey casual, and he does things like adding extra letters to words, lots of exclamation marks, abbreviating, smilely faces. Recently, whenever he texts me something with my name, he adds extra letters to the end of my name. I'm definitely overthinking this, but I feel like it's not super professional?

Are these signs that he might be into me, signs that he wants to be good friends with me, him just being nice, him seeing me like a little sister... I feel like I'm going insane 😵

For those of us feeling lonely over the holiday, I wanted to share some hope. 

We are alone… for now. Nothing says this cannot change as long as we are willing to grow and change ourselves. 

Be kind to people around you. It’s common for stress to make people more agitated this time of year. It’s easier to lash out when you feel tired or under pressure. Take a few moments each day to record a gratitude journal and reflect on what you have going well. Share some joy be being extra kind to some people who have no reason to expect it. Compliment a stranger’s fun accessory. Hold the door for someone you don’t know. Pay forward a coffee in the drive through. 

Be kind to yourself. You are the only you that you have. Take care of your health. Rest, eat foods that make you feel healthy, be intentional about getting sunlight and movement daily. 

Don’t withdraw. This is a time to reach out to people and not retreat. Most friends and family have no idea how you are feeling if they aren’t in your shoes. No need to burden them with every detail like Eeyore, but let them know if you are feeling lonely and ask them to spend a few moments staying connected. 

Find supportive communities or groups IRL or online that build positive relationships. Sharing feelings is not whining. Learn the differences and don’t get into the negativity of complaining. No one will last long around you if you focus on negativity. 

Never give up. Never surrender! 
If you don’t survive, by Grabthar’s Hammer, you will be avenged! (Also, don’t forget to be silly and have some fun)

I am in a sports club, but everytime I ask to go for coffee, everyone declines.
I have 2 friends which I see every 2 weeks.

I wish I had the motivation to do things that would help, like going out and looking for a job, but I often don't.

I'm really mad with my brain for sabotaging me like this, because I have all it takes to be a happy man with a job and a partner.

I’m a Cadet Pilot. For the last year, I tried to force the iPad Pro to be my ""Flight Bag."" I had the perfect setup (M1 Pro + Pencil + Keyboard), but I realized my retention was dropping.

I dug into the psychology of why (Metacognitive Illusion, Attention Residue) and realized I needed to ditch the LCD screen for something with ""Friction.""

I wanted to share this ""unpopular opinion"" with other students here. Sometimes the hardware is perfect, but the *psychology* of the screen fights against you.

**The Great Unlearning**

From kindergarten to Class 12, I lived and built my life on paper. Every morning i hauled a backpack that was less of a schoolbag but a semi-portable archive of dead trees. Textbooks that had a certain smell when bought. Notebooks with dog-eared pages. The faint stain of ink and highlighters on my fingers. 

That was the rhythm. Heavy bags, ink stained hands, and the tactile friction of knowledge earned on paper. But beneath all, there was a quiet dream growing inside of me. What if it all could be different? What if every textbook, notebook and worksheet could live inside one sleek pad? No weight, no clutter. Just pure portable knowledge. 

In mid-2022. I saved some money. 

It arrived in a pristine white box. An iPad Pro with pencil, tastefully engraved with my name like it was made for me along with the best alternative for the Ipad magic keyboard (ESR rebound magnetic keyboard case).

After setting it up, the first thing i installed after Spotify was Goodnotes (shoutout to Goodnotes ). It felt like stepping into the future. Dream coming true. No more overflowing shelves. I imagined myself as one of those hyper organized students I saw on YouTube, every note tagged, every textbook searchable, every scribble backed up forever. 

But then reality hit. 

The price shock. Over a $1,100 for the iPad and the pencil, another $20 for Goodnotes, and the creeping realization that I had just signed up for a completely new way of working. It wasn’t just an upgrade, it was a mountain-sized learning curve. I was literally relearning how to write. 

And the feel? God, the feel. Writing with the Apple Pencil on bare glass was sterile, like skating on ice. There was no feedback, no resistance, none of that comforting scratch my brain had spent years wired to. I tried the matte screen protector “fix” but it felt like a trade-off with the devil. The writing was slightly better, but my beautiful high resolution display was now dulled and grainy. The iPad was supposed to feel futuristic, but it was already a compromise. 

 Then came the comparison game. I made the mistake of opening YouTube and Pinterest. Suddenly, I was drowning in “study inspo” perfect pastel highlights, immaculate margins and calligraphy level handwriting.

My messy scrawls, functional but chaotic, looked like failures in comparison. I wasn’t just studying anymore. I was measuring myself against a fictional aesthetic. My iPad, meant to free me, had somehow trapped me in an inferiority complex. 

This was my first brush with what psychologist call the metacognitive illusion: the dangerous feeling that neatness equals mastery. A digital page that looks beautiful feels like knowledge is sticking, when in reality it isn’t. 

But here’s the paradox. As I moved into my professional aviation training, I couldn’t just ditch the iPad. It was genuinely powerful. My textbooks were searchable. My notes were instantly 

organized. My handwriting was converted into typed text with a tap. Everything synced across devices. It was the most advanced, practical, organized study tool I’d ever used. 

And yet… it never felt real. 

With paper, there’s an honesty to the experience. The smell of ink, the weight of page. The little mental map in your brain finding where you wrote what, “the diagram was in the top-left corner of the page with a coffee stain.” That’s **encoding specificity** at work, which is how physical context anchors memory. On paper, you know where things live. On the iPad, everything floats in an endless scroll of sameness. 

There’s the effort. With books, studying feels like an act. You buy 3 types of pens, rulers, 10 colors of highlighters. You underline by hand. Furthermore, you scribble margin notes. You invest sweat equity into the page. That effort becomes part of the knowledge itself, what psychologists call effort justification. It’s the **IKEA effect applied to learning: the harder you work on the thing, the more it becomes yours.** 

With the iPad, ironically, effort disappears. You have millions of pen styles, colors, and thicknesses, but none of them feel earned. They’re just pixels. No matter how many hours you pour in, the notes never feel like objects in the world. They feel like files. Disposable. Empty. 

The iPad was everything I thought I wanted: portability, convenience, organization. But it was missing the one thing I didn’t realize I needed. Soul. 

# The Cognitive Nosedive 

When I began my pilot training, I made a decision that the iPad would be my one and only study companion. It made sense. Aviation is already digital. Cockpits run on screens, not paper. Why shouldn’t my study system match the future I was flying toward? 

At first, it felt promising. My notes were tidy, searchable, always backed up. No more flipping through fat textbooks looking for a buried diagram. I could carry entire libraries on one slab of glass. In a way, it was intoxicating. I felt efficient, modern, ahead of the curve. 

But then came the Technical General exam. 

If you’ve never been through it, let me explain. This isn’t like a high school math test where you can scrape by with “kind of knowing.” This is one of the unforgiving gatekeeper exams of aviation. A mountain of dense, merciless theory. Aerodynamics, engines, electrical systems, all crammed into thousands of pages. And in aviation, almost knowing is the same as not knowing. You can’t “guess” how an aircraft system works at 35,000 feet. 

And here’s the terrifying part: the knowledge wasn’t sticking. 

On the iPad, everything felt neat, but hollow. I could read for hours, scroll through PDFs, highlight in neon colors… and yet, the next morning, it was as if I’d done nothing. The learning slid off my brain like water on glass. 

It was the strangest, most unsettling feeling. I wasn’t failing because I was lazy. I was failing because the very tool I had trusted was betraying me. 

I was heading toward what I now call a cognitive nosedive: all systems looking functional, but the aircraft (my brain) losing altitude fast. 

That’s when I snapped. 

I did something absurd. 

I took my thousand-page PDFs, walked into a print shop, and said: “Print it all.” 

# The Homecoming

The printer groaned and clattered, spitting out stack after stack of warm A4 paper. The shopkeeper looked at me like I was insane. Honestly? I felt insane.. Here I was, the proud owner of a futuristic $1000 iPad, paying extra money to drag myself backwards into the past. 

But then I picked up the first heavy stack. I opened the first page. I pulled out a simple ballpoint pen. And I underlined. 

# The Uncomfortable Truth

I eventually passed my exams, but I realized the iPad was a ""Distraction Engine"" that was fracturing my focus. I needed something in between the ""dumbness"" of paper and the ""distraction"" of an LED screen.

I wrote a full breakdown of the psychology behind this (Metacognitive Illusion) and why I'm switching to E-Ink for my next phase of training.

A while back, I posted a review here of the **ESR Rebound Magnetic Keyboard**. I stand by that review it is the best hardware alternative to the Magic Keyboard.

However, despite having the ""perfect"" hardware setup (iPad Pro M1 + ESR Keyboard + Goodnotes), I realized something terrifying as I prepped for my Aviation exams: **I wasn't retaining information.**

I wanted to share this ""unpopular opinion"" with other students here. Sometimes the hardware is perfect, but the *psychology* of the screen fights against you.

**The Great Unlearning**

From kindergarten to Class 12, I lived and built my life on paper. Every morning i hauled a backpack that was less of a schoolbag but a semi-portable archive of dead trees. Textbooks that had a certain smell when bought. Notebooks with dog-eared pages. The faint stain of ink and highlighters on my fingers. 

That was the rhythm. Heavy bags, ink stained hands, and the tactile friction of knowledge earned on paper. But beneath all, there was a quiet dream growing inside of me. What if it all could be different? What if every textbook, notebook and worksheet could live inside one sleek pad? No weight, no clutter. Just pure portable knowledge. 

In mid-2022. I saved some money. 

It arrived in a pristine white box. An iPad Pro with pencil, tastefully engraved with my name like it was made for me along with the best alternative for the Ipad magic keyboard (ESR rebound magnetic keyboard case).

After setting it up, the first thing i installed after Spotify was Goodnotes (shoutout to Goodnotes ). It felt like stepping into the future. Dream coming true. No more overflowing shelves. I imagined myself as one of those hyper organized students I saw on YouTube, every note tagged, every textbook searchable, every scribble backed up forever. 

But then reality hit. 

The price shock. Over a $1,100 for the iPad and the pencil, another $20 for Goodnotes, and the creeping realization that I had just signed up for a completely new way of working. It wasn’t just an upgrade, it was a mountain-sized learning curve. I was literally relearning how to write. 

And the feel? God, the feel. Writing with the Apple Pencil on bare glass was sterile, like skating on ice. There was no feedback, no resistance, none of that comforting scratch my brain had spent years wired to. I tried the matte screen protector “fix” but it felt like a trade-off with the devil. The writing was slightly better, but my beautiful high resolution display was now dulled and grainy. The iPad was supposed to feel futuristic, but it was already a compromise. 

 Then came the comparison game. I made the mistake of opening YouTube and Pinterest. Suddenly, I was drowning in “study inspo” perfect pastel highlights, immaculate margins and calligraphy level handwriting.

My messy scrawls, functional but chaotic, looked like failures in comparison. I wasn’t just studying anymore. I was measuring myself against a fictional aesthetic. My iPad, meant to free me, had somehow trapped me in an inferiority complex. 

This was my first brush with what psychologist call the metacognitive illusion: the dangerous feeling that neatness equals mastery. A digital page that looks beautiful feels like knowledge is sticking, when in reality it isn’t. 

But here’s the paradox. As I moved into my professional aviation training, I couldn’t just ditch the iPad. It was genuinely powerful. My textbooks were searchable. My notes were instantly 

organized. My handwriting was converted into typed text with a tap. Everything synced across devices. It was the most advanced, practical, organized study tool I’d ever used. 

And yet… it never felt real. 

With paper, there’s an honesty to the experience. The smell of ink, the weight of page. The little mental map in your brain finding where you wrote what, “the diagram was in the top-left corner of the page with a coffee stain.” That’s **encoding specificity** at work, which is how physical context anchors memory. On paper, you know where things live. On the iPad, everything floats in an endless scroll of sameness. 

There’s the effort. With books, studying feels like an act. You buy 3 types of pens, rulers, 10 colors of highlighters. You underline by hand. Furthermore, you scribble margin notes. You invest sweat equity into the page. That effort becomes part of the knowledge itself, what psychologists call effort justification. It’s the **IKEA effect applied to learning: the harder you work on the thing, the more it becomes yours.** 

With the iPad, ironically, effort disappears. You have millions of pen styles, colors, and thicknesses, but none of them feel earned. They’re just pixels. No matter how many hours you pour in, the notes never feel like objects in the world. They feel like files. Disposable. Empty. 

The iPad was everything I thought I wanted: portability, convenience, organization. But it was missing the one thing I didn’t realize I needed. Soul. 

# The Cognitive Nosedive 

When I began my pilot training, I made a decision that the iPad would be my one and only study companion. It made sense. Aviation is already digital. Cockpits run on screens, not paper. Why shouldn’t my study system match the future I was flying toward? 

At first, it felt promising. My notes were tidy, searchable, always backed up. No more flipping through fat textbooks looking for a buried diagram. I could carry entire libraries on one slab of glass. In a way, it was intoxicating. I felt efficient, modern, ahead of the curve. 

But then came the Technical General exam. 

If you’ve never been through it, let me explain. This isn’t like a high school math test where you can scrape by with “kind of knowing.” This is one of the unforgiving gatekeeper exams of aviation.

1phazjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_gone_girl20/comments/1phazjx/i_didnt_tell_a_female_customer_that_my_boss_who/,I didn't tell a female customer that my boss who is also my best friend is married.,"I am the manager of a bakery, that I co-own with my bestfriend. My bestfriend- we will call him Eddie-  is a pastry chef. I have other very flexible job as well. It's not like I need to go to the bakery but I like to go there and help my bestfriend and most of the time we carpool cause we are neighbours too. 

Right so there's this girl, let's call them Amy, they come in with two if their friends almost every day and will sit in one of the table for hours ordering some cake or pastries or cookies and coffee. They will be all giggly and blushing whenever Eddie would walk out the kitchen to the front area. 

As I said Eddie is a pastry chef so most of the time he is in the kitchen while I am by the counter. After my shift I usually sit in one of the table and work until its time to close so I am there for 3-4 hours if not less and while I am there, Eddie would come out of the kitchen to check on me. He would sometimes bring us some cake and coffee whenever he is on break, we would talk for a while and then he would go back to work. 

Last Monday, I overheard Amy asking one of staff members about me and Eddie. She asked ""OP and the chef look very close to each other no?"" The staff member said "" Yeah"" and went back to work. I didn't mind anything back then. But two days later, Amy, came up to me when I was waiting for my bestfriend to finish his work and close the bakery. She started making small talks. (I HATE SMALL TALKS) After a few minutes she asked me if I had a boyfriend. I said no. Then she asked if the chef has a gf. I again said no. And before I could say something else she stood up and said 'oh nice' and went back to her friends. 

The following Friday, Eddie and I were sitting and talking about the shits we need to get done for Christmas when Amy walked up to us and sat down on the spare chair and started going on and on about how much she liked Eddie and then she asked him for a date. And Eddie and I just sat there. 

Coffee in our hands. Fork halfway to the pastry. Eddie looks at me. I look at him. Amy looks at Eddie. I blink. He blinks.

Then he says ""No. I can't. Thankyou for asking but I can't."" 

Amy blinks. Once. Twice. 

She turns to me ""You said he was single? You liar. You said you are not dating. You fucking bitch.""

I was taken aback at this and took a second to realise wtf was happening so I said ""You asked me if he had a gf. I said no. You didn't even give a chance to say more than that. You didn't ask if he was married or not?""


She then threw in some very colourful words and stormed out and now she is banned from the bakery. ",1,1765196383.0,u_gone_girl20,0,1.0,False

1phax2v,https://www.reddit.com/r/MindEvolution/comments/1phax2v/you_will_be_okay/,You will be okay.,"You can’t escape the character, but your relationship with your character can be changed. When I say “character,” I mean your body, thoughts, feelings, memories, desires, triggers, habits.. all of that.

Guys, look. It’s like playing a Mario video game. You’re not the Mario character, but when Mario eats those mushrooms 🍄, it affects him — he gets bigger. And when bullets hit him, he gets smaller or whatever. But the player who’s controlling Mario (your higher self) is untouched.

Let me make one thing clear.. your higher self isn’t a person or a thing. It’s not something you can point to because it’s not made of anything. It’s outside the game. Outside the matrix. But you as a character can’t escape the matrix because there’s nothing outside the game, but you’re already free from the matrix because you’re not the character.

Anyway, there is cause and effect here. If you eat a lot, your stomach won’t feel good. If you’re rude or bad to people, they won’t like you. Even though the player can’t be affected by any story, the character does get affected. So it’s your job to make your character happy, peaceful, wise, and healthy.

I know lots of things aren’t in your control. Like  your genes, your relationships, the environment around you. So many conditions shape your happiness and well-being. It’s impossible to smile and be happy when you stub your toe or when something bad happens.

But the good news is (even though it’s not really “good news,” it’s just the law of the universe)..nothing lasts forever or stays the same. Pain goes away. Trauma heals or becomes less triggering with time. You will be okay. Even when you’re not okay, your higher self is okay and completely unbothered.

I know some of you will say this is nonsense spiritual talk. Guys, I’m not ignoring your suffering. I’m telling you to look at it from a different angle. It's like to change your relationship with it.

Like Buddha once said, you can’t avoid the first arrow, but you can avoid the second one...the resistance to what’s already happening. It’s like when your favorite coffee mug breaks because your cat knocked it over. You can’t change that. It’s already broken. But you can stop suffering by not clinging to what’s already gone, and stop being mad at your cat. Accept that it’s broken and move on.

And I know sometimes you feel like “nothing lasts forever, so what’s the point?” Let life drive the car for a while and just watch the show. It’s like knowing chess is just a made-up game and it doesn’t matter if you win or lose. But getting too detached from life isn’t good for your character. You still have to live, create, and have fun. You can take the steering wheel too, drive the car of your life in a direction that makes your character happy, peaceful, and wise.

It’s like there’s zero (pure awareness) and there’s the world (duality — the plus and minus). You stay close to zero when the world gets too loud, and then you go back into the world to play and create when you feel bored. Zero is flavorless — super peaceful but nothing’s happening. The world is colorful and bright, but it also gets chaotic and intense if you immerse yourself too much in it.

And it’s like chocolate...it’s not good or bad. Eating too much chocolate will make you sick, but that doesn’t mean you have to get rid of chocolate. Just be smart and don’t eat too much. Life is like that. Don’t get lost in duality. Have fun, guys. And trust in God, trust in the universe, and love yourself. You’re beautiful because you’re all expressions of the one Being appearing as the entire universe. 🙂",2,1765196161.0,MindEvolution,0,1.0,False

I'm raised in a university where academic high-stakes culture is normal. I didn't even choose to be here. It's especially harder when you're someone who doesn't have the will to live nor to die. You're in the middle — trying to survive. I used to have depression, and I definitely think my history with depression is playing a huge role. Everyone thinks of me as one of the smart, reliable students throughout elementary, middle school, highschool and even during senior highschool, but no I'm not — I study and that's it to it. I can't say I'm academically smart, I'm just surviving. I am not even allowed to pursue what I truly want such as politcs, business, literature. Not to mention I hate studying things I have no passion for and it's painful to force yourself into doing things you genuinely don't desire to do. 

And I if do one day eventually do fuck it all and just follow my passion or rather, ""irrationality"", I lose my friends, my parent's affection, my overall stability. People here look down on students who aren't academically smart. and I hate being looked down on which isn't helping in my predicament. On top of that, no matter how i remind myself I am more than my academic standing, it doesn't work. I'm raised that way and I hate it. I especially dislike it when I'm not even able to express this worry towards my closest friends. What if they look down on me? or avoid me? or no longer think of me as their friend? I'm actually miserable but constantly trying to prove my worth keeps me going (I wouldn't recommend it because it's genuinely wrecking me.) Additionally, I hate HATE or rather, LOATHE being called a pessimist. I'm actually crashing out now — because the said people isn't even aware of what I HAD TO GO THROUGH TO JUST SURVIVE THIS FAR. I used to be an optimist. but no. not anymore — and I wish i could go back, and I'm trying. oh and great, just earlier, my coffee just stained my clothes and my written reviewer. at this point i dont even have the energy to be mad.

I added spoiler just incase.
If you notice any grammatical errors, I'm sorry.
