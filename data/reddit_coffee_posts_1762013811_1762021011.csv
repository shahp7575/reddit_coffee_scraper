What We‚Äôre About

A space for New Jersey dads to connect, swap advice, share stories, and maybe meet up for a coffee, stroller walk, or playground hang.

Whether you‚Äôre a first-time dad, seasoned pro, or just trying to survive the toddler years ‚Äî you‚Äôre in good company here.

We talk about it all:

‚Ä¢ Parenting wins (and fails)
‚Ä¢ Life hacks and gear recs
‚Ä¢ Local parks, events, and activities
‚Ä¢ Work/life balance, mental health, and relationships

The Spirit Here:

Connection > perfection.
We‚Äôre not here to judge or flex ‚Äî we‚Äôre here to listen, laugh, vent, and help each other out.
Every dad‚Äôs journey looks different, and that‚Äôs what makes this space work.

Keep it kind. Keep it local. Keep it real.

Let‚Äôs build this thing together ‚Äî one stroller walk, playground hang, and dad chat at a time.

* In Ridgewood and Chatham, NJ, buyers are paying more per square foot to live near authentic, walkable downtowns , even trading larger lots for proximity to cafes and shops. Homes in Chatham Borough sell for more than nearby Township homes thanks to access to local culture and transit.
* The ‚Äúpost-pandemic reset‚Äù has fueled demand for small-town Main Streets filled with independent coffee shops, bakeries, and boutiques, as residents seek connection and community over convenience.
* Real estate brokers note that too many chains or big-box stores near a town center now¬†*hurt*¬†buyer perception, as shoppers prefer local variety that reflects neighborhood character and engagement.

**My take:**¬†The next premium isn‚Äôt just location, it‚Äôs local. Investors who bet on towns preserving authentic downtowns may see faster appreciation than in sprawling suburbs with copy-paste retail.

Here are the other stories I alluded to in my last post. Please don‚Äôt judge, I am not really interested in a relationship so I do a few FWB relationships with the occasional hookup here and there. 

Here are a few other situations where I might be the asshole:

1. After some drama with an ex-gf, I agreed to meet this man in his late 30‚Äôs for coffee and possible hookup at 8 pm. My dr‚Äôs appointment is running late (this rarely happens with this doctor) so I send him a note at 7 saying I will meet at 8:30. I get to the coffee shop at 8:30 and wait until 9. I get home and see a text he sent at 9:05 saying he was stuck in a meeting. I responded I don‚Äôt tolerate that level of disrespect. He has written to me three times asking if I am still mad about a misunderstanding. AITA for leaving him on read?

2. An ex FWB has been reaching out to men online on my behalf (a whole other story) telling them I might be a good match. One of the men (50‚Äôs)contacted me and I explained what had happened but would be open to talking. Turned out he was someone I already had a FWB relationship for over a year. I frankly don‚Äôt care that he has or wants another FWB arrangement. He has since ghosted me. AITA for not caring and not trying to make further contact. 

3. I made plans to meet up with another of my FWB (40‚Äôs) last Thursday to meet at 6. When I arrive 3 minutes early and he answers I say hey this is Sue (not my real name). He says who I say this Susan. He says you have the wrong apartment. I ring again before I even get a chance to say anything he says I told you, you have the wrong apartment. I leave and go straight home. The next day I get a text ‚Äúhow are you‚Äù I ignore it. An hour later I get another text. ‚ÄúI remember what I was doing yesterday at 6 pm. It was you who rang my doorbell. Why did you say you were there for Susan‚Äù. AITA for planning to leave him on ‚Äúread‚Äù forever?",2,1762020142.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

- **Spot Readiness:** Understand that many business owners have existing problems they‚Äôre eager to solve. Listen for signs of need in casual conversations.

I currently have a Rocket Appartamento paired with the Faustino (both are first gen bought in 2019 or 2020 I think... Can't remember)

I have come to the conclusion that I don't like the workflow with the Faustino. The portafilter holder doesn't work with my bottomless ones so I have to hold it under the chute, the touch screen is slow and already failed twice under warranty and the adjustment knob is small and not easy to operate to remember settings or have a safe ''range'' when opening a new bag of fresh beans.  
It also creates a mess everytime.

SO

I am in the market for a new grinder. I am tempted to go big burrs and here's my dilemma (And it's a weird one). With a budget for around 800 to 1400 CAD$ (600-1000 USD?)

I'm a workflow kind of person and love the ritual of making coffee, to explain my first choice ;

1. Craig Lyn Design Studio | HG-1 Manual grinder
2. Niche Duo
3. Timemore Sculptor 78s
4. Stretching the buget towards a Option-O | Lagom P80...

Any thoughts ? Any option I should consider ?

I love brewing medium roasts espresso, sometimes light roasts. I'm not into dark roasts at all !

I love sweet shots and drink my espressos as-is or making Oat Latte !

Own several espresso machines and grinders and I want to get into the roasting part, I really enjoy the tinkering with the process.

The Bullet (either R1 or R2) is much more expensive but definitely looks like is built to last.
The Skywalker Cyberroast V2 has definitely the price going for it, but also you get what you paid for.

Looking for something that can produce at least 500g of beans at a time and has full control of the process via PC.
I feel like I would eventually get to the Bullet, just wondering if it worth to do the intermediate step and get the Skywalker first to play with.

They are both back ordered till December, I‚Äôm ready to pull the trigger.

Also where would you order the Bullet from? Directly from Aillio USA or Sweet Mary‚Äôs?

1. Energy and allowing yourself to be vulnerable

2. Religion

3. Types of practice



So first and foremost I recognized I had this conversation with retired Pagan but I had some further questions for other practicing witches. 

1. Do you find yourself conducting protection spells as allowing the chance for more negativity to enter? They brought this up and it did make me question as you usually find balance and everything and I am just looking at my salt like üëÄ. 


2. I'd call my self a questioning spiritual but I more so believe in science and energy and that while I use god as a term for which I pray for, is really just more of an affirmation or like talking to my energy and ‚Äúspirit guides‚Äù using Catholicism as a outlet (as I have grown up as that being a very common symbol in my environment) and not really as a ‚Äúcatholic‚Äù person. But I also am a heavy believer in physics and biology. With a mix of trauma, I'm kind of f‚Äôed in that department and it bothers me because I can't even really explain myself so I feel like a phony. Does anyone else relate especially as a practicing witch?



3. Piggy backing off of 2, I do what I call maintenance craft lol. I just do casual grounding spells, affirmations, protection spells, even just pentagraming my coffee. And while I know others, I fear karma lol. And while I have done it for nearly 16 years, I have suddenly felt self-conscious. Is that normal?

What Jesus teaches about Love in action

Introduction
------------

Love is at the heart of Jesus‚Äô teachings, and it‚Äôs a love that calls us to action. Imagine the profound impact if we not only embraced this love but actively shared it in our daily lives! As we journey together, let‚Äôs explore what it means to turn the love Jesus taught into action, transforming not only our lives but the world around us.

Are you ready to dive deep into a love that goes beyond mere words? A love that changes hearts and uplifts spirits? Together, we‚Äôll uncover how even small acts of kindness and love can echo Jesus‚Äô incredible teachings.

Bible Verse
-----------

John 13:34‚Äì35 (NIV): ‚ÄúA new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.‚Äù

Meaning
-------

This powerful message from Jesus invites us to reflect on the transformative nature of love. It‚Äôs a command, not merely a suggestion, highlighting its importance in the life of a believer. Jesus sets the ultimate example by loving us unconditionally, and He calls us to mirror this in our interactions with others.

Love in action means going beyond feelings. It‚Äôs about making deliberate choices to serve, support, and uplift others. This kind of love is a testament to our faith and a reflection of Jesus‚Äô presence in our lives. By loving one another, we demonstrate what it means to be His disciples, shining His light in a world that desperately needs it.

Let Jesus‚Äô model of love inspire us to break barriers, build bridges, and nurture relationships. As we do, we‚Äôll find our lives enriched and our communities strengthened.

Actions to Take
---------------

‚Äì Reach out to a friend or family member you haven‚Äôt spoken to in a while and express your love and gratitude for them.

‚Äì Volunteer at a local charity or community center to offer your time and love to those in need.

‚Äì Practice random acts of kindness, such as buying a stranger a coffee or writing an encouraging note to a coworker.

‚Äì Begin each day by asking God to open your heart to opportunities to love others as He loves you.

‚Äì Offer forgiveness to someone who has wronged you, demonstrating love and grace.

Journal Prompts
---------------

‚Äì Reflect on a time when someone‚Äôs love in action impacted your life. How did it affect you?

‚Äì What barriers do you face in showing love to others, and how can you overcome them?

‚Äì How can you practice love in action this week in your workplace or community?

‚Äì Describe an area in your life where you can improve in loving others as Jesus loves.

‚Äì Pray and write about a relationship where you want to show more love.

Prayer
------

Dear Jesus, thank You for Your incredible love and the perfect example You set. Help me to not only understand Your love but to actively live it out. Open my eyes to the needs around me and guide my heart to respond with compassion and grace. May my actions be a reflection of Your love, drawing others closer to You. Amen.

------------

Conclusion
----------

Embracing Jesus‚Äô command to love in action isn‚Äôt just a responsibility; it‚Äôs a privilege that blesses us and those around us. By living out this love, we become reflections of His heart in the world, touching lives with hope and kindness.

I visited Sussex‚Äôs open day and I think the vibes are good, but I‚Äôm not totally sure that the money saved and peace of mind is better than Bristol‚Äôs career opportunities.

I get nervous applying to jobs because if they accept me, I would have to interview and that scares me.
I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, I‚Äôm so tired and I can‚Äôt afford anything therapy, I get stressed out about taking medication that I probably wouldn‚Äôt even be able to afford, does anyone know if this is enough to worry about in order to ask my boyfriend for help getting help or can it wait until I get a second job?

I‚Äôm a 27 y/o international student in Melbourne. Few months back in June I got COVID for the third time; I was afraid I am going to die as after my 2nd I was told to avoid 3rd at all cost or it could be fatal for me which it nearly was; this time it led to type 1 respiratory failure. That experience changed my life.

My doctor was very clear: protect your lungs, mask consistently. Not ‚Äúevery now and then,‚Äù not ‚Äúonly in hospitals,‚Äù but as an ongoing thing. So now I wear a proper respirator / N95-level mask consistently even inside spaces because I know what happens if I don‚Äôt.

People assume I‚Äôm overreacting. Some think I‚Äôm sick. Some ridicule me and others think i am young so i am not possibly that ill. What almost no one understands is: I‚Äôve already had 3 infections and the last one literally messed up my breathing ‚Äî I do not get to be casual about this anymore.

I still want to do normal things. I want to grab coffee (outdoors), talk, study, exist around people without having to explain my entire medical history first. I‚Äôm just trying to stay healthy enough to keep studying and working here.

So‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm posting because I‚Äôm looking for friends. People who don‚Äôt make it weird that I keep my mask on. People who understand that clean air and masking are just preventive health, not a personality. People who won‚Äôt tell me ‚Äújust this once.‚Äù

If you‚Äôre in Melbourne or even if you are not and still masking / high-caution / COVID-careful, or you‚Äôve also had a bad outcome from an infection and now you‚Äôre long-term cautious, I‚Äôd love to connect, even on Reddit. Please let‚Äôs be friends.

It seems something is backed up. The hot water switch is still able to push water out, but when trying to make coffee, water seems to leak into the puck drop and sometimes even leaks out of the machine.

\-Descaling cycle

  
I've also tried opening it up, but I immediately realized I was more likely to break it than fix it, so it was closed back up after I vacuumed out as many beans as I could that fell into it.

I just wrapped my sabbatical year in France, and I want to share my language learning experience so far at a high level for anyone else looking to level up their French language learning journey.

I'm tempted to write a long post, but I'll save that for my [Substack](https://marielibres.substack.com/). I'll make it short and sweet here by outlining my French language learning efforts. For reference, as of April 2024, I was a complete beginner in French. I do have a strong command of Spanish (C1), which, I'll admit, helps with the romance language structure and common vocab, etc. Beyond that, French is still kicking my butt! Anyway, onto my efforts.

* I was living in NYC at the time and I had heard from a few acquaintances about a spot called [Coucou French Classes](https://coucoufrenchclasses.com/) out in Nolita. (They're also in LA and online.) I took their Level 0 Complete Beginner class...and I loved it as a newcomer to French. The space is also pretty cool and they're community based. So they host a lot of fun events to get to know other French language learners in the city! Great way to make new friends.
* I found an online tutor over [Preply](https://preply.com/en/home) who I love! I did my trial lesson with her back in October 2024, so I've been with her for over a year now. We meet once a week and do half casual convo and then half ""class format"" in which she runs through an exercise to strengthen some areas that I'm struggling with. I did have to do several trial classes to find someone who I felt at ease with and within my budget, so just FYI there that you'll probably have to do this too.
   * I think pairing a group class with a private tutor is the way to go. Preply is a huge platform of 1-on-1 tutors. So to me there are lots of tutors who can match your timezone or budget.
* Two summers ago, I went to France for vacation. For a week of that vacation, I signed up for an intensive language course. I had my Coucou Level 0 Intro class under my belt, and I wanted to build up my confidence through immersion. I did the weeklong course at a French language school called [Lyon Bleu](https://lyon-bleu.com/). It was just 3 hours every morning, so I had the rest of the day to explore Lyon (and practice my French). The classes are completely in French, even for beginners! If you love to be challenged and get a lot out of immersion, this format is definitely it.
* On an online forum, I found a post by a French woman around my age who was looking to practice English. The forum is international, and I saw that she was also living in Bordeaux. What're the chances? So I reached out to her asking if she'd be interested in doing a language exchange sometime over coffee, as I was also looking for ways to improve my French. We hit it off during our meet-and-greet, met up on a weekly basis to practice 2 hours in French and 2 hours in English over the next three months. We literally became new best friends from this, and I'm so grateful.
* I looked for opportunities to immerse myself in French daily life, away from the more known backdrops of large cities like Paris, Lyon, Bordeaux, etc. I got on a [workaway.info](http://workaway.info), which I had used when I was backpacking solo around South America many moons ago (also another story for another time). On there, I found a retired French artist in his 70s living out in Dordogne who needed help around his house and garden. In exchange, he'd provide a room, access to his art studio and materials, and all meals. He had a lot of positive reviews from the past 10 years, the majority of which were from women, which were good signs to me. For two weeks straight, he only spoke to me in French and it was such a wonderful and wholesome experience.
* During my sabbatical, I took an intensive 3 month French language class in Bordeaux at a school called [Newdeal Intitut](https://newdealinstitut.com/). It was pretty expensive, if I'm being honest. There are certainly cheaper schools around Bordeaux, but I'm not quite sure what the tradeoffs are since I only heard about them through word-of-mouth. It was a great place to have some structure, deep dive into grammar, and make friends. It does tire you out mentally because it's 3 hours a day, 5 days a week. It really also depends on who your instructor is.

  
Okay this is already getting super long, so I'm gonna wrap it up here. If folks find this useful, I'll make a follow-up post of other stuff I did/do to keep improving my French in an immersive and holistic way. In the meantime, feel free to AMA.

1olu3r5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1olu3r5,"More Crop, Flower, and Settler Experiments!","Hello once more! I've you've not seen my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Necesse/comments/1ojplc9/settler_food_and_efficiency_experiments/), I've been testing some of the farming and production mechanics of the game. And I return with yet more experiments!

# Crop Efficiency Revisited

After my previous post, I realized there were some aspects of my testing that I didn't like. The tests had been conducted over a very short period, they had been conducted from non steady-state conditions (the experiment began with a full 1000 crops fully grown), and I had only tested under 'full saturation' conditions (enough crops so that the workers would always have lots to do). So, I repeated the experiment in a way that tries to address these issues.

First, each of the experiments involves only 1 settler and begins much closer to a steady state condition for the farm; I'd let the settler plant and harvest undisturbed for several in game days before data collection began. The tests were conducted over a longer period. And finally, various total numbers of crop tiles were tested. Additionally, I no longer need to estimate the number of crops harvested, since I've been able to confirm that most crops always yield exactly 2 seeds (more on that later): since 1 seed goes to replanting, I only need to track the number of seeds that the settler stores to get an exact crop count. Once again, I used pumpkins (this may somewhat skew the numbers up because of their low yield; I'm not yet sure when settlers decide to drop off inventory). The results:  


|Number of Farm Tiles|Duration of Test (days)|Total Harvests|Average Harvests / Day |Efficiency (Daily harvests / tile)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1000|7|1516|216|0.22|
|500|5|999|200|0.4|
|400|5|870|174|0.44|
|300|5|667|133|0.44|

  
The results are actually fairly consistent with what the napkin math would indicate; if we take 216 / day as an estimate of the maximum possible workload of a worker, given that a pumpkin takes, on average, 34 minutes to grow, the rough estimate would be about 460 tiles to effectively saturate a worker. Somewhere between 400 and 500 for a single worker seems to be a reasonable amount, although there are some tradeoffs between space and worker efficiency

# Seed Yield Data

After noticing an unexpected number of seeds in the last experiment, I decided to go back and retest seed counts for all plants. I also found some notable inaccuracies in the Wiki, presumably due to things changing over the development of the game. I'll only list out the plants below which vary from the wiki or do not appear on the Wiki:

Crops:

First, note that all crops and flowers except rice and coffee always yield exactly 2 seeds! 

|Plant |Seed Count|
|:-|:-|
|Rice|3-5|
|Coffee|3-7|

**Bonus result: This makes coffee the best money crop in the game!** I may try to design an efficient coffee farm setup if I get bored

Flowers:

|Flower|Flower Yield|
|:-|:-|
|Caveglow|1-2|
|Firemone|1-3|
|Iceblossom|1-3|
|Mushroom|3-6|
|Sunflower|1|

Additionally, during my tests I found that flowers had a growth time that seemed faster than most crops but slower than wheat. So, I recorded around 250 Iceblossom growing and then studied the video, and found that they seem to have a growth interval of 5-7 minutes (see included frame from that video). I did not explicitly test the others, but qualitatively they seem to be the same.

# Angler Idle Output

The final experiment I ran was simply trying to see how quickly an angler catches fish if you assign them full time to fishing. I tried to place a cooler directly next to where he sat to minimize travel time, but he seemed to change fishing locations. So this isn't absolutely optimal.

After 7 days of fishing in a forest, the result was:

|Fish Type|Count|
|:-|:-|
|Gobfish|18|
|Halffish |16|
|Herring|18|
|Furfish |21|
|Salmon |17|
|Mackerel |22|
|All types|112|

I did periodically check the fish count over that period, and I'm reasonably certain that all fish have equal probability, and the differences we're seeing are just due to the randomness inherent in a multinomial distribution. It works out to a clean average of 16 fish / day. Taking into account the earlier finding that settlers use 40 nutrition per day, this means that a single angler can feed about 4-5 people by cooking the ingredient fish. Not bad... but the above farming results mean that a single saturated farmer can feed over 200.

 I just got back into roleplaying today been really wanting to do a wholesome small town sol rp 

Plot 1: we were best friends throughout elementary school and our last year I had to leave due a new job opportunity for my parents, it's been years since we have seen each other we both just hit freshman year of college and what are the odds we both got into the same college, we accidentally run into each other. 

Plot 2: I'm new to town just left my home town and left the state, I pulled up in my classic 1969 mustang that I made sure to keep alive for years, you work in a coffee shop or a local diner and I come in 

Plot 3: I'm a touring musician and have been for the pass couple of years, but I need a break from everything it's getting to me. So once i finished up the first half of the tour I decided to head back to my home town (we can both choose what state and the name of the town), we both used to know each other through out high school, but we'd mostly talk during lunch, passing period and after school, I used to have a major crush on you back then but I didnt say anything. We run into each other at a local community event and start catching up on things. 

The seasons can be around Halloween, Thanksgiving or Christmas you can choose I wont be picky 

I'm also open to adding some drama in it as well

I was/am a functioning alcoholic. I won‚Äôt go into the details but things got very bad and after years of drinking myself into oblivion I decided after ruining another night I should stop. 

A month ago I tried to be responsible and I tested whether I could have a few drinks without going off the rails, and I couldn‚Äôt and I went straight back to where I was before. So I decided from then that I needed to stop completely and be sober from alcohol and have been ever since.

I didn‚Äôt want to do this, but I know I have to. I literally cannot stop when I start drinking. But now, I feel like I‚Äôm losing so much of my life. Not losing the alcohol, but losing my social life. Losing a part of my personality, losing my friends. 

I‚Äôve tried going to events sober. I can do it, but it‚Äôs hard. Being sober from alcohol has made me even more aware that I‚Äôm not naturally a confident or outgoing person, and that‚Äôs pretty devastating. I‚Äôve always known this to a degree, but I honestly felt like I was better than this. Alcohol was clearly hiding the real me, and the real me has nothing interesting to say or bring to the table.

I thought that I would be happier, but I‚Äôm not. When people ask me how it‚Äôs going, I don‚Äôt feel a wave of joy come over me that‚Äôs constantly, annoyingly explained in all these self-help, ‚Äúbeing sober is wonderful‚Äù books (I‚Äôm not judging anyone else‚Äôs choices when it comes to battling with their addiction, but for me, I just can‚Äôt deal with this kind of narrative). I‚Äôm only now content when there‚Äôs nothing going on that I‚Äôm missing out on. 

This weekend, for example, is Halloween. My partner and my friends are all having fun, but I‚Äôve decided to be alone. Obviously, I could just go to these parties, but being around tonnes of people drinking for hours on end, while I try to hold it together, get bored and eventually leave early, why would I want to do that? What‚Äôs the point?

Is this the life that I‚Äôm going to just have now? I‚Äôll never have that fun social life anymore? Honestly, I don‚Äôt even know if I want to try and push myself to be around people as a sober person, it‚Äôs too hard. I have nothing to say right now that isn‚Äôt just about me not drinking now. I feel like I‚Äôm grieving for a part of my life I‚Äôm not going to get back and I have no idea how I‚Äôm going to keep up friendships going forward. And I don‚Äôt want to go for a coffee. I don‚Äôt want to have awkward, small talk walks through the park. Not when I‚Äôm feeling like this.

I‚Äôm naturally someone who thrives off human connection, big talk, getting to know people. But now, like, how? I just don‚Äôt see how I‚Äôm going to move forward.

The best thing is that I at least don‚Äôt feel that urge to drink. That‚Äôs a plus.

# Because caring about our future doesn‚Äôt have to be a full-time job of heartbreak

[Created by author](https://preview.redd.it/vkc6put8loyf1.jpg?width=2880&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eab21e59b5812fb029c3a615022f8395613442ee)

  
My social media feed has become a scrolling obituary. That‚Äôs what it amounts to, basically. There‚Äôs this unshakable impression that we‚Äôve crossed some invisible line. The ice caps are melting, authoritarians are winning, privacy is vanishing, robots are learning, infrastructure is failing ‚Äî somehow everything‚Äôs deteriorating and my grocery bill keeps climbing higher. It‚Äôs the lamest dystopia imaginable, the kind where you are still paying your student loans in your mid-30s.

We had the chance to prevent runway carbon emissions, but instead, we were¬†[manipulated into addiction](https://medium.com/southern-winds/why-we-choose-not-to-know-adc98d6f4cb6). Now we might be past several¬†[climate tipping points](https://medium.com/southern-winds/its-antarctica-or-planetary-collapse-6f716f8ddb07). The planet‚Äôs already cooking in¬†[heatwaves](https://medium.com/the-environment/the-carbon-cartel-behind-every-extreme-heatwave-9bbc061247b1)¬†and¬†[megafloods](https://medium.com/the-environment/the-floods-in-pakistan-are-a-glimpse-of-the-future-weve-engineered-738251934432), and the only people still optimistic are the ones selling¬†[carbon offsets](https://medium.com/the-environment/when-helping-becomes-a-story-we-tell-ourselves-5fbfd55405d4). It really feels like we‚Äôre witnessing the sixth mass extinction, but instead of dinosaurs and asteroids, we have¬†*Copernicus*¬†alerts showing¬†[new temperature records.](https://climate.copernicus.eu/new-record-daily-global-average-temperature-reached-july-2024)

It‚Äôs totally understandable that doomscrolling disaster would make us want to hide under weighted blankets and never come out. If the planet were dying for lack of climate anxiety tweets, I‚Äôd rally my most cynical writer friends and we‚Äôd save the world by dinnertime. But if we‚Äôre truly headed toward a world of underwater cities and permanent ‚Äúfire seasons,‚Äù who wouldn‚Äôt think to board a rocket to Mars?

Well, that‚Äôs the stupidest thing I could do. Those ‚Äúclimate-proof bunkers‚Äù barely exist beyond flashy promotional videos and luxury real estate brochures. And even if they did, escaping while the planet burns instead of joining the movements that could actually change our trajectory is basically being a selfish prepper with extra steps.

Because if¬†[carbon emissions are pushing us past planetary boundaries](https://medium.com/the-environment/the-1-5-c-chimera-is-over-well-burn-through-the-remaining-carbon-budget-by-2027-c3bd35aca173), shouldn‚Äôt we be demanding systemic change instead of spaceships past the stratosphere? For people supposedly witnessing the collapse of ecosystems, our response has been less¬†[mobilize-and-transform](https://www.sunday.earth/)¬†and more doom-and-complain, panic-and-paralyze, like-and-forget‚Ä¶ and catastrophize-and-carry-on.

Maybe climate change has finally outpaced our ability to respond (even though this system keeps selling us a¬†[techno-salvation fantasy](https://medium.com/southern-winds/the-awakening-why-renewables-cant-stop-collapse-4709b3f71ae1)), so people talk like we‚Äôre headed toward extinction. Yet the way they act and live and breathe is comically‚Ä¶consumerist business-as-usual. My father-in-law is experiencing his doomism phase, where every conversation has an ‚Äúend-of-the-world‚Äù undertone to it. In the meantime, he just booked¬†[flights to Bali](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9dx5jyqz97o). ‚ÄúYeah, so the planet is burning, the¬†[Arctic ice is basically gone](https://medium.com/the-new-climate/are-we-3-years-away-from-the-first-arctic-ice-free-day-8b6e23594d98), and we‚Äôve got maybe¬†[ten-twenty years left before feedback loops](https://medium.com/southern-winds/how-much-time-do-we-have-before-the-atlantic-oceans-collapse-8395c1c93646)¬†make everything uninhabitable. Anyway, I just ordered this cute swimsuit for my surf-and-dive trip next month.‚Äù

Now, if the¬†[coasts are about to be underwater](https://medium.com/southern-winds/the-first-climate-escape-lottery-is-here-1eb165616194), why is everyone still buying beachfront property?

# A Full-Time Job of Heartbreak

Fifty years ago, social psychologist¬†[Stanley Milgram](https://psychology.fas.harvard.edu/people/stanley-milgram)¬†showed in his¬†[*‚Äúsmall world experiment‚Äù*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_experiment)¬†that humans have, through technological advancement, become connected by¬†[shorter and shorter chains of acquaintance](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/swn.d/swn.html). Originally, we only maintained relationships with those in our immediate vicinity, then telegraph and telephone extended our reach across cities and countries, and now we are connected to virtually anyone on Earth through networks that collapse six degrees of separation into one click. The world hasn‚Äôt grown smaller, but our ability to traverse it socially has expanded exponentially.

And, together with it, our moral intuitions have progressively widened their scope. Early human societies primarily valued loyalty to kin and deference to immediate royal authority figures. Over centuries, these moral concerns expanded to include fairness toward strangers, care for the vulnerable regardless of tribe, and eventually for many, respect for all sentient beings. What once triggered moral outrage only when it affected our immediate clan now activates when we merely read about injustices occurring continents away.

The concept of ‚Äúclimate debt‚Äù is the perfect example of this expansion of our moral circle. Decades ago, nations (conveniently, the powerful and mass-polluting ones) viewed their emissions as purely domestic matters with local consequences. Today, there‚Äôs growing recognition that¬†[historical emissions from wealthy countries](https://ourworldindata.org/contributed-most-global-co2)¬†have created¬†[disproportionate suffering in developing nations](https://medium.com/the-environment/the-carbon-cartel-behind-every-extreme-heatwave-9bbc061247b1)¬†that contributed least to the problem. This moral consideration now extends across time ([to future generations](https://medium.com/the-new-climate/the-climate-dilemma-should-i-have-children-in-a-future-of-unprecedented-extremes-6f04fbc649d3)) and across geography (to vulnerable communities worldwide). And the circle has grown paradoxically closer through real-time videos of¬†[floods in Pakistan](https://medium.com/the-environment/the-floods-in-pakistan-are-a-glimpse-of-the-future-weve-engineered-738251934432)¬†or¬†[mega-fires in the Iberian Peninsula](https://medium.com/the-new-climate/the-iberian-wildfires-from-below-average-to-record-breaking-in-a-week-5682909e0881)¬†that instantly reach our pockets.

Expanding our¬†*small worlds*¬†has indeed¬†[been a step forward](https://medium.com/the-environment/how-the-collapse-of-indias-vultures-led-to-half-a-million-human-deaths-ce2df340192f).

However, if we need to feel emotionally devastated about every endangered butterfly species from Madagascar to Montana, and every displaced community from Bangladesh to Bolivia with equal moral urgency‚Ä¶that‚Äôs basically a full-time job of heartbreak, right? These emotional processors in our skulls evolved to manage the social dynamics of a handful of hunter-gatherers, not simultaneously hold the suffering of 8 billion strangers in working memory. Attempting to process every piece of bad news in the world is like trying to drink the ocean through a coffee straw.

This has created a weird self-accountability phenomenon: when every¬†[temperature record breaks](https://medium.com/the-environment/2025-wont-be-the-hottest-on-record-but-that-s-no-comfort-at-all-5c9d72ee8d27), we performatively despair online, then crank up our air conditioners and order takeout in single-use plastics.¬†*Appearing*¬†concerned has become more important than¬†*being*¬†effectively concerned. We care enough to be horrified, but not enough to be inconvenienced. Until caring mutates into its worst kind of shape: indifference.

Because, when the phone shows both a friend‚Äôs vacation photos and genocide footage within the same minute, is it any surprise the wiring starts to short-circuit?

So, what does the average well-intentioned person do? I think most of us have stumbled upon an elegant solution without even realizing it: embracing hopelessness as a defense mechanism against the guilt of not doing enough.

# Credit For Noticing The Water

We humans are actually quite good at navigating social situations: we‚Äôre careful and attentive because we‚Äôre concerned about how interactions will go. Through evolution and life experience, we‚Äôve developed many social tactics and strategies that have become so natural to us that we use them without even realizing it.

Like riding a bicycle, after years of practice, you don‚Äôt consciously think about every little movement anymore. That‚Äôs the social ‚Äúautopilot‚Äù behaviors that help us manage interactions smoothly, even when we‚Äôre anxious about them.

We‚Äôve all been in those no-win situations. You know the feeling: it‚Äôs like choosing between a rock and a hard place, but you NEED to choose between either some kind of embarrassment or regret: When it feels awful to ask your crush out and get left on ‚Äòread‚Äô, but it‚Äôs pathetic to spend years wondering ‚Äúwhat if?‚Äù Or when it‚Äôs terrifying to quit your stable job and pursue your passion, risking public failure, though it‚Äôs soul-crushing to stay somewhere that makes you miserable.

When you‚Äôre caught between potential humiliation and the certainty of private disappointment, what‚Äôs your move? You can deliberately set yourself up to fail so you can say¬†*‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt really try too hard‚Äù*¬†rather than¬†*‚ÄúI tried my best and wasn‚Äôt good enough.‚Äù*

Sheep learned to self-handicap to play, and is common in a lot of social animals.

I was a med-school student. And I did really well in classes and exams, but I sucked at the bureaucratic procedures of enrolling in classes, lectures, etc. And one year, without meaning to, I ‚Äúforgot‚Äù to enroll in classes on time. That‚Äôs when a snowball of lies started rolling, telling my family that I was going to study when in reality I was spending my time reading books on‚Ä¶ medicine, philosophy, and sports, while playing one soccer game after another all over Buenos Aires.

Of course, all this self-sabotaging wasn‚Äôt free. I paid a very high price. I had to lie a lot, and eventually, people around me started seeing the inconsistencies in my lies. The situation became so cynical and far-fetched, my lies so twisted, that no one believed what I said anymore, even if I was saying that the sky was blue. So my self-esteem and self-confidence plummeted. I became depressed. My girlfriend at the time left me. I distanced myself from my loved ones because I couldn‚Äôt even look them in the eye. Until, at one point, I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore: I sent them all an email asking for forgiveness and went to travel across America for nine months. When I returned from that emotional journey, I began to rediscover myself.

Today, I can say that my subconscious was protecting me from the possibility of failure, of not being the perfect doctor that everyone expected me to be. I was beginning to realize that I didn‚Äôt want to be a doctor at all, which is why I¬†[self-handicapped](https://www.shortcogs.com/bias/self-handicapping-bias)¬†myself and drowned in a spiral of the most deceitful lies: the ones you don‚Äôt even realize you are telling.

This¬†[psychological strategy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/self-handicapping)¬†protects our ego: we create an excuse before we even fail, so our self-worth stays intact. Most people who are sabotaging themselves (just like me) don‚Äôt even realize they‚Äôre doing it.

When life demands too much from us (or, at least,¬†[that‚Äôs how we feel](https://medium.com/southern-winds/everyone-has-something-the-world-needs-even-if-they-havent-figured-it-out-yet-5256b4356f93)), we find convenient excuses:  
*‚ÄúI can‚Äôt possibly help with climate change because it‚Äôs already too late!‚Äù*¬†is a free pass to not even try.  
*‚ÄúWhy bother voting when the system is completely corrupt?‚Äù*¬†is a convenient excuse to complain without participating in the messy work of democracy.  
*‚ÄúWhy should I reduce my plastic usage when corporations are the real polluters?‚Äù*¬†is a justification to keep that single-use lifestyle going without guilt.

Today, many feed themselves with these big, hopeless problems, just to feel wise and aware while doing absolutely nothing. It‚Äôs like saying ‚Äúthe ship is definitely sinking‚Äù as an excuse to avoid helping with the buckets ‚Äî while still wanting credit for noticing the water.

# What‚Äôs The Point?

When the¬†[wildfires rage through your neighborhood](https://medium.com/southern-winds/this-is-what-happens-when-your-president-tries-to-make-argentina-great-again-9767e1812cf6)¬†and food prices quadruple at your local grocery store, the empty shelves won‚Äôt be impressed by¬†[how eloquently you explained](https://medium.com/southern-winds/earth-in-2024-wrapped-yes-climate-change-will-probably-kill-you-b1b5550d0c08)¬†why individual action was pointless compared to corporate responsibility.

The point isn‚Äôt that individual action alone solves everything. It‚Äôs that philosophical resignation doesn‚Äôt protect you from real-world consequences. The climate doesn‚Äôt care about our rationalizations ‚Äî it responds to actions, not attitudes.

To some people, a.k.a the-blind-deniers-who-are-afraid-of-looking-out-the-window, suggesting that our problems could be fixed if we¬†[dare to put the brakes on this predatory system](https://medium.com/the-quantastic-journal/scientific-revolutions-are-political-powerplays-in-disguise-cc3a9f061924)¬†that feeds on overconsumption and reckless pollution, means admitting that our problems are not crucial¬†*‚Äî*¬†so yeah, let‚Äôs just keep our foot on the pedal.

Others, the guilt deflectors, are offended by the implication that they have any responsibility to fix the things they didn‚Äôt break, as if a sinking ship only takes you down with it if you‚Äôre the person who punched a hole in the hull. Or they‚Äôve convinced themselves we‚Äôre totally doomed, so they just roll their eyes at anyone who still has a bit of hope. Again, when they say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doomed‚Äù, they‚Äôre often just protecting themselves from trying and failing.

Nobody actually knows if we can solve these big problems for good or not. The only way to find out is to try. And we won‚Äôt try if we‚Äôve already convinced ourselves it‚Äôs hopeless. It‚Äôs like saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt learn to swim‚Äù without ever getting in the water.

I know this might sound privileged ‚Äî I‚Äôm not living on a coastline watching the tides creep higher each year or facing brutal heat without air conditioning. That‚Äôs okay: the people experiencing direct impacts¬†*should*¬†lead the conversation. But we‚Äôre wrong to act as if climate doom-scrolling is somehow productive. When we‚Äôre so focused on sharing apocalyptic headlines without taking even small actions, we forget that¬†[participation, even if it‚Äôs quiet, can be meaningful](https://medium.com/southern-winds/7-quiet-revolutions-that-can-reshape-the-world-66507234a923)¬†and that¬†[collective action](https://medium.com/the-new-climate/population-control-the-end-of-the-world-or-the-solution-to-our-problems-6ad9c8111603)¬†is indeed powerful.

When I see people clinging to hopelessness, I have to wonder: what‚Äôs the appeal? What benefit do they get from believing¬†*nothing*¬†can be done? If nobody knows for sure whether we can fix our problems, why choose the belief that paralyzes you instead of one that motivates you? It‚Äôs like choosing to stay in bed all day because ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs the point?‚Äù when getting up might actually lead to something good.

Caring about our future doesn‚Äôt have to feel¬†*so*¬†depressing.

# There Is A Solution

Humans ‚Äî especially the ones with the power to move the needle ‚Äî are experts at looking away. At outsourcing responsibility. At numbing the rest of the world with distractions until the fire alarm feels like background noise. But the way out isn‚Äôt shrinking our worlds back down to what we can stomach. It isn‚Äôt pretending we‚Äôre helpless or absolving ourselves with clever excuses. When the problems feel too many to count, the only move left is to¬†*choose one and start pulling*.

The question isn‚Äôt ‚Äúcan you solve everything?‚Äù The question is:¬†*what kind of world do you actually want to live in (or you want to leave for your kids) ‚Äî and what‚Äôs*¬†[*one step you can take that points in that direction?*](https://medium.com/southern-winds/7-quiet-revolutions-that-can-reshape-the-world-66507234a923)¬†No one‚Äôs asking for G.I.-Joes here. Just people willing to pick up the next bucket and pass it along. And there are a lot of people willing to do so ‚Äî the¬†[overwhelming majority of humanity](https://89percent.org/), but we just don‚Äôt know about our many silent partners.

We don‚Äôt need to win the lottery twice, just find the tools at hand to pass the bucket.

Humans are social creatures ‚Äî we move when¬†[we think others are moving](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-economics-051520-023322)¬†too. The¬†[tipping point for societal change](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921800921003013)¬†isn‚Äôt a majority ‚Äî it‚Äôs just 25% committed. Once that threshold is reached, the rest follow fast. As one¬†[study](https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.aas8827)¬†notes,¬†***‚ÄúThe power of small groups comes not from their authority or wealth but from their commitment to the cause.‚Äù***¬†So the only way to ignite this movement is if millions of us bother to show up instead of taking the easy escape route of hopelessness.

My fight is turning¬†[raw scientific data into language people can actually feel](https://medium.com/southern-winds/why-its-so-damn-hard-to-figure-out-what-to-do-with-your-life-e5f0f5936fae)¬†to¬†[help people awaken](https://medium.com/southern-winds/the-awakening-why-renewables-cant-stop-collapse-4709b3f71ae1)¬†from the neoliberal-climate-change-is-a-hoax rhetoric that feeds on eternal (but obviously impossible) growth. Other people reduce their carbon footprint, block pipelines, or experiment with algae farms that suck CO2 out of the air. Fine. Beautiful. Necessary. We have infinite fronts; nobody can fight them all.

But the point is, you can‚Äôt sit it out.  
We scroll, we sigh, we post, and we wait for someone else to step forward. Yet pretending you‚Äôre not in the fight is just another way of choosing the wrong side.

Sure, the forces of¬†[Big Oil look terrifying](https://bsky.app/profile/weareyellowdot.bsky.social/post/3lz2wgsc6us24). They‚Äôve got pipelines. They‚Äôve got addicts all over the world. They‚Äôve got politicians who treat collapse like campaign material.

So here it is without the soft landing: it‚Äôs bad. It‚Äôs not your fault. But the world doesn‚Äôt owe you a cleaner slate. These are the cards on the table, and the only choice is whether to keep folding or start playing. Would you rather keep doomscrolling your obituary ‚Äî or would you like things to be better?

Then grab the bucket. Grab the stick, a pen, or¬†[a homemade sign](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4530e5d999c1a78d91abbe4dc1bc4fd27f36ca5/0_333_5011_3007/master/5011.jpg?width=1200&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=1fd9207e3d2a6cde0758ee3bc0afff08).

I love the look, but is this a tradition I shouldn't mess with?","I have been thinking lately, trying to decide what I‚Äôll wear on the big day. I‚Äôm set on a fairly formal wedding; you know, black tie vibes but something in me keeps drifting toward a white groom suit. Crisp, bold, clean. I love how the photos of grooms in white look: sharp and a little bit daring. According to some style guides, white suits are perfect for warm-weather or garden weddings. 

The thing is, I‚Äôm also thinking about practicality. White shows every coffee stain, every dust mark, every panic sweat during the ‚Äúfirst look‚Äù moment. But I can't stop thinking about some white suits I saw on Alibaba when I was browsing for fabrics and alternatives, tempting fits the idea‚Äôs really lurking.

My biggest fear? Coming off like I‚Äôm playing James Bond in Ibiza instead of a groom who took five minutes to get dressed. Also, will a white suit fit with my bride‚Äôs cream-coloured dress and the bridesmaids in midnight blue? Will it clash or complement? Style-wise, I want timeless, not trendy. But part of me thinks ‚ÄúIf not now, when?‚Äù

So, MVMT: Guys who‚Äôve pulled the white suit trigger how‚Äôd it go? Did you feel like you stood out the right way? Any regrets, laundry horrors, accessories you would‚Äôve swapped the next day? I‚Äôd appreciate real talk before I commit.",2,1762018335.0,mensfashionadvice,6,1.0,False

So a few weeks after he told me he wanted a divorce, my husband left for another city for a 5 weeks to see if he likes it there better-- of course he got his work to pay for it. In between the divorce conversation and the leaving, there was couples therapy, dinners out, talking, and even a certain level of joy amidst the heartbreak. Now he's just gone, and I'm left with our apartment and our dog. It's now very clear I'm being iced out and systematically ignored--this is so painful and such obvious abandonment. We haven't told our families yet because it's been in such a state of limbo, so I've been avoiding reaching out to more than a few family members. My dad is MAGA and very religious, so I'm avoiding telling him even though I know he would support me. It's been months since the initial conversation. I think I'm falling into a state of depression and loneliness.

I've joined a yoga studio, I joined a weekly virtual Codependents Anonymous group, I'm in therapy, I'm applying to law school, working when I can (I work by myself as a private teacher) trying to get out and do things, but here's the rub. I don't have a lot of true close friends in my city. I have lots of peers and acquaintances! but I tend to isolate when Im going through something. I don't like reaching out unless I feel very safe with the person. so I have only told 1 friend in town. (I've told other friends and close family).

What do I do to make friends in my city? I want more than anything to go out and feel good and experience joy with people. What feels good? I've tried dog parks and coffee shops, and there's small talk, but sometimes I want something more than that. I feel scared to invite people to do things because I feel so scared that they'll want me to share something about my life. I feel so lost. I'm 37 and I hate feeling like a burden to other people. It's something Im having a very hard time breaking out of. Any advice is greatly appreciated as I sit here feeling like the floor is falling out from underneath me.

1oltnka,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oltnka,Fish tuberculosis?,"I'll make this concise as possible because I have a tendency to ramble, but it's going to be long to provide as much detail as possible.

Questions are at the very end, as well as pictures for context.

                         -TANK INFO-
  Nothing new added to the 20 gallon in almost a year, heavily planted with 30+ several feet long jungle val runners, java fern, some imitation Marimo moss (the kind that's not Marimo, but still shaped in a ball and sold fasley as Marimo), driftwood, trident jungle fern, anubias, duckweed. One large female betta, one platy, maybe 5 ramshorns and a small handful of Malaysian trumpet snails, and one large mystery snail. The pest snail population self regulates due to controlled feeding.
 
  Parameters are consistent, water changes only happen every 4 ish months because of 'perfect' cycle, but I top off as needed with treated water. I used to change more water but it always threw the tank off balance, I've found the schedule that works best for my tank. Feeding happens 2-3 times a week with a home-made blend including flakes, shrimp, algae wafers, algae wafers, bottom feeder pellets, all crushed into a rough powder with a coffee grinder.

Ph:7.6
Ammonia:0
Nitrite:0
Nitrate:0-10, depending on if I fed recently



                     -FIRST ISSUES-
  Thought betta had dropsy few weeks ago. Over a year old, in a heavily planted 20 gallon, large female, perfect health, suddenly(within about 4 days) was pineconed, listless and didn't swim much, only letting herself be cradled in the jungle val near the top. Didn't want food. Pineconing and fluid build up was so bad she was bruising and willingly swam into my hands for the first time. She was suffering and so I put her down with clove oil.

  One platy tankmate in the 20 as well, peaceful betta and they liked to 'sleep' near each other and never nipped or chased. Had more platies from the same clutch, but they failed to thrive at a few weeks old, all were introduced as fry, only the one platy survived, and thrived. Nice and plump, good appetite, acted like a healthy fish.

 After betta was gone the singular platy was acting distressed and 'depressed'. It presented the same as when I've had to separate other schooling fish for one reason or another, more like isolation was causing the stress, not illness. Was still eating and sleeping the same.

Platy quarantined for 2 weeks, then added to my small guppy school, perked up after acclimation and fit right into the school, back to normal. She always sleeps separately from the guppies, but that was how she acted in with the betta, resting lower down in plants or right above the gravel, where's the guppies are always right at the surface and never slow down.


                      -NEW ISSUES-
Now a few weeks later she has sudden onset symptoms won't eat, caved in stomach, lethargic and only darts away if touched. Spine is starting to bend kike it's being tightened, color is going pale, breathing is heavy, and balance is sort of wobbling.

I've pulled her out immediately upon noticing symptoms and plan to keep in a sick tank to monitor until I know what's going on before throwing meds in or possibly euth if she deteriorates to the point life is no longer her best option.

                   -MORE INFO-
I thought the betta just had dropsy, she was my longest living betta, and was from Petco so I know genetics are hit or miss. I got her a year and nine months ago. Largest female I've ever seen, employees thought she was mislabeled male.
  Started with 6 platy fry from the same store, maybe 3 days old. Grown out in a smaller tank for about 3 weeks before being added to the 20 gallon with the betta. 5 lived less than a week, 1 thrived and made 'friends' with the betta. Both were calm and like two peas in a pod, no fighting, no food aggression, no nipping or chasing. Betta let the platy 'sleep' next to her when the lights went out every night. Trying not to anthropomorphize the fish behaviors, but honestly it's like they were tiny soulmates. I love them both deeply and without going down a whole separate rabbit whole, the betta meant so much to me emotionally due to not mentioned circumstances.
  The empty snail shells in the photo are not new, they are several months old. Whenever a snail dies I leave the body to decompose while closely monitoring parameters. I've never had the ammonia change after a death. I leave them in for the other snails to eat, and as calcium. No snails have died in over 7 months.
  Lights are on a 12 on-12 off, and the betta cup is over the filter intake tube as a precaution. It has large panels cut into the side and lined with mesh to catch the bigger leaf bits and prevent them from clogging the filter like has happened in the past.


              

                 -QUESTIONS- 
 Could the swelling and everything else that was wrong with the betta possibly have been tuberculosis instead of dropsy?

Could the symptoms in the platy be dropsy?

Will the guppies develop tuberculosis if so, even though the platy was removed immediately after symptoms?

I now have a crayfish in the 20 gallon that was devoid of fish, because the platy and betta are gone, can he be affected if tuberculosis is in the water even though he's not a fish?



First 4 pictures are the betta
5-11 are the platy
12 is the tank currently, crayfish in bottom right corner



I love my fish deeply, Pancake was my perfect beloved little betta whose been with me through difficult and amazing times. Butter was her silly platy roommate, with yellow color to match.

**Episode 2**

This time it‚Äôs Crave Grill‚Äôs BS vs. Dev‚Äôs Coffee Bar‚Äôs¬†*Sasquatch*. It‚Äôs a sit-down brick-and-mortar restaurant compared to a kiosk‚Äîbut the criteria comes down to the sandwich. I chose these two because they‚Äôre down the street from each other, so both would be fresh.

The packaging reflects their different business models: Dev‚Äôs came wrapped in foil, while Crave‚Äôs came in a box with fried potatoes.

Dev‚Äôs is bagel-based; Crave‚Äôs is on sourdough. Dev‚Äôs is more savory, with sausage and bacon. Crave‚Äôs is more polite, with tomatoes and a slightly sweet ‚Äúonion ring sauce.‚Äù On first glance, Crave‚Äôs looks bigger because of its larger footprint, but Dev‚Äôs is taller.

Both breakfast handhelds were very good. There are things I like and don‚Äôt like about each one‚Äîmuch of which comes down to personal taste. I prefer the sourdough over the bagel. The meat on both is good, but Dev‚Äôs has both sausage and bacon. I like the over-medium egg on Crave‚Äôs better than the egg on Dev‚Äôs. I didn‚Äôt care for either condiment‚ÄîCrave‚Äôs is sweet, and Dev‚Äôs has cream cheese (which I forgot to ask them to omit). I scraped off both.

**Bottom line:**  
Crave would accommodate substitutions that would be more to my liking but they have better breakfast items‚Äîthey make one of my favorite breakfast burritos, and given the choice, I‚Äôd pick it over their sandwich seven days a week and twice on Sunday. Dev‚Äôs¬†*Sasquatch*¬†is more car-friendly and costs half the price of Crave‚Äôs.

Help me make full use of my Costco membership and avoid disappointment from the checkout staff with my half empty cart. Hotdog and pizza on me.

I‚Äôm a secret rebel currently masquerading as a VP in tech aka corpo drone, constantly trying to get back at loblaws while figuring out how to get around this city with construction galore. Proud owner of a number of cozy sweaters (aka free human furnace), minor Coke Zero addict and a bit of lingering abandonment issues (working on it), major pizza fanatic - hoping to find a smart, funny, child free (obv), physically active partner who wants to live our DINKY life, have company for her dog walks and I dunno‚Ä¶ nonchalantly fall for each other I guess. As an added bonus, we can finally become real adults and be each others emergency contacts.

Currently busy growing a mini jungle at home, adding to my Spotify playlist each week, already looking forward getting excited like a kid again with hockey season (damn you leafs üò≠), playing random rec sports (floor hockey, beach volleyball etc) each week to stay active and sneaking in standup comedy/concerts (join me!) as much as possible. Always down for some fun travel adventures (India, Greece, Jamaica and all over parts of US so far this year), enjoying coffee throughout the city, BBQing my heart out, petting any dogs that make eye contact and helping the local economy by hitting patios when the mood strikes.

Physically I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11, 205, light brown complexion, shaved head and a thick black beard (now featuring white strands!) and live near King West. Ideally looking for someone local within the downtown area as one of my love languages is quality time and through past relationships, I‚Äôve learned how much i appreciate spending time with my partner.

If any of this intrigues you, feel free to send me a chat message. On a side note, I spend way too much time on the ‚Äúpetsareamazing‚Äù subreddit group getting my animal fix‚Ä¶ feel free to share any of your fav vids!",1,1762017959.0,cf4cf,0,1.0,False

A month ago I approached a woman at a coffee shop and we‚Äôve been regularly seeing each other since. She wants to take it slow, and we‚Äôve only cuddled, and kissed. The first time we kissed (about 10 days ago) felt so romantic and intimate. 

Since then, I have stopped masturbating‚Ä¶ it used to be something I would do daily if not twice a day, and since getting closer to her and feeling intimacy it‚Äôs gone to zero. 

It‚Äôs starting to get to the point where I want to masturbate because my brain wants the feeling of pleasure, but I‚Äôm wondering if there‚Äôs a reason not to, and if others have experienced this before?

# Fang & Cottontail | Chapter 7

\[Andrew slouches on his bed, whith his headphones on, zoning out, sighing at his old laptop, his eyes vacant & glassy as he stares at the cracked screen, a half-written paper before him, his head dips as he starts to doze off\]

\[The intercom crackles\] ""Dorm floors 6, 7 & 8 are now out of bounds until late evening today, all residents of dorm floors 6, 7 & 8 please vacate to cafeteria C""

\[He bolts upright, slamming his laptop shut, and stalks over to his door, peaking it open just enough so he can see into the lounge connecting the rooms\]

\[Thare is a loud knock on he doors before they swing open, and a handful of N.F.S.G agents enter, led by a White-furred fox\]

""Ladies & Gentlemen, following recent news, we're going to be conducting a search on floors 6 through 8 for illicit substances""

\[A group of lionesses pull out thare phones and starts to record or stream to social media, and the lion who was sitting between them stands up\]

""Hay, you specious bastards aren't searching shit, get the fuck out, you can't just muscle in here""

\[The fox, seemingly unfazed, looks to him\] ""University tenancy agreement section three states that you consent to spot searches, bag checks and Room inspections if you're suspected of possessing a prohibited item. Section five lists the following as prohibited items, Substances that are illegal by public law, as well as Alcohol, Catnip & synthetics, unless prescribed by a licensed veterinarian""

""In short, we can and will, now y-""

\[The lion snarls, puffing up his mane\] ""This is bullshit, I'm not letting you go through my stuff, you little snowflake""

\[The fox's expression changes ever so slightly, not anger, not frustration, but disappointment\]

""Son, I'm not here for your stashed beers, and I don't care if you have dirty cat mags under your mattresses. Frankly, I'd rather not have to touch that. We're here to crack down on the plant's, they make you a danger to yourselves and others. The sooner we clear this up, th-""

\[further agitated by perhaps the tone or by his failure to intimidate his way out of it, he roars and charges the fox\]

\[They give nothing more than an irritated tail flick as an agent steps out from behind him\]

\[A grey wolf, it sprints 3 steps forward straight towards the lion, then just before he enters its reach, he sidesteps, swinging out his left arm, clotheslining him, then sweeps his legs out from under him whith his left leg kicking at the back of his anckes, the oposing forces as his neck is pushed backwards and his feet being pushed forwards he is pitched backwards, and falls to the floor landing on his back whith a thud\]

\[The room is silent, everyone frozen in place as the wolf stands over the lion, glaring down whith his amber eyes, Andrew slowly, silently closes his door, a loud youwl folowing shirtly after\]

""Fuck, I don't like where this is going. I'm cooked if they find it""

\[He pulls he wardrobe forward and pulls stuff out from under the dead space beneath the wardrobe and tosses them in a bag and slings it over his shoulder, hops up onto his windowsill and closes his curtains, then slips down onto he roof, before closing the window behind him\]

""Great, ok, we're outside, what was the plan, dumbass, can't just sit out here, if they look out I'm right here hiding on a roof whith a bag full of- The drainpipe maybe?, no too old to rusted, no way I can jump from here either, I'd break my legs for sure""

\[In frustration, he slaps himself in the face, then again, and again\] *""Think you stupid cat,* *^(Dad's right I'm useless)* *THINK!, fuck that, think you gotta get out of here... Fire escape!, I just got to get across to the other side of the roof...""*

\[He steps up onto the ledge and looks across\] *""Just scross that thin ledge, fuck, FUCK, FUCK""*

\[Stood trembling on the edge of the roof, he closes his eyes and takes a deep breath in\] *""Screw it, it's better than getting caught... Right?..""*

\[He takes a step out, pressing himself against the wall, eyes clamped shut, he shuffles across, terrifying step by terrifying step, his claw's scraping across the 3-inch ledge. Eventually, he feels the wall's edge and as he opens his eyes, just one more step away from relative safety\]

\[Step.\]

\[once he steps away from the edge, his legs shake as he finally exhales, his breath a warm fog before him, his head spins for a few moments as he regains himself\]

*""I thought I was going to lose my 6th life thare, I am never doing that again, but never mind that you were stupid as hell, what now, where do you go, Pete & Phill are on the floor below me, thare getting searched too, no one else is gonna help your sorry feline ass your enemy number one right now, maybe- i hope he means it, please be real""*

\[He pulls his phone from his pocket and flips it open, and then holds it up to his ear\]

*""Please pick up, please""* \[Beep\]

""Haya Kitty, how you doing? You ok""

""Could I ask a favour?""

""Has it got something to do whith your dorms being closed?, You don't sound too good""

""How'd he guess so fast?"" | ""Uh, yeah, I just need somewhere to chill till it's over, I can't get to my dorm""

""Thare searching the place, aren't they? Heard they closed em over the intercom""

""How the fuck do you know?, Seriously, what the fuck?""

""I'll show you the news when you get here, and don't bring your stuff here, the smell is probably why it's happening, lots of people keep saying they can smell it coming from your floors, silver could smell you & it on me from that time at the club""

""You scare the shit out of me sometimes, you know that whith your psycick ass feelings, doctor bulshit""

""I don't mean to, sorry, just come over, it's cold out""

\[Andrew shuts his phone and throws it back in his pocket. Before trudging down the fire escape, he stashes his bag in a bush by the bottom of the fire escape stairs, and quietly stalks his way across the mostly empty campus and into the north dorm building, slipping in behind another few people joining thare group to go unnoticed, and then up to Jakes floor and into the lounge, geting a few odd galnces as he aproace's the door\]

\[The door is half open as he spots Andrew wave's him in\] ""Come in dude, take my seat""

\[Jake hops up, closing the door, as he motions to his desk chair and then sits down on his bed\]

""Don't worry, silver's out so he won't mind, he'll probably be back later, he went for a walk, he does that when he's bored or irritated, or if it's a full moon, I think today it's all three, so we have untill cufew till he comes back, usualy he just dosent show up till morning""

\[Andrew sits down nervously glancing around the room, starkly different from his own, neat, tidy, clean, the furniture unscratched and dented, no clothes on the floor, not even dust\]

""Wow, this room is nice""

""Oh yeah, it's alright, bed'd comfy and got some nice lights, I put 'em up myself, I know it's silly but I like them""

\[He jestrues to strings of fairly lights wrapped around the posts of his curtained poster bed\] ""I like to close the bed curtains, switch them on and just read or listen to music, it's really chill, wanna sit and chill, you look like you need it""

\[He scoots back until his back is up against the wall and pats the spot next to him, Andrew Verry tentatively sits on the edge of the bed, then looks down at himself\]

""I am- i better not I haven't got round to washing my clothes, or showering, and my jeans are muddy and my paws-""

""Relax dude, it's cool, you don't have to sit here if you don't want to, no need to make excuses, but if you actually want to, you can use our shower and just borrow some of my pyjamas, they will be a little baggy on you, but thare really soft""

\[Andrew looks conflicted for a minute or two\] ""Are you sure I can't pay you for it? I'm broke right now""

""Yeh I'm not gonna charge you dude, Some water and shampoo costs basically nothing, go for it go tidy yourself up. Just feeling clean will do wonders for your head""

""You sure? I'm already asking for help""

""Yes kitty, don't get in your own head about it, and go clean up, i won't peek""

\[Jake scoots forward and opens the drawer underneath his bed, and hands him pyjamas and a clean towel to the frozen Andrew and then gives him a gentle nudge. He stands slowly and heads into the shower\]

\[Many Hours pass\]

>Let me know if you creatures want a side chapter here to learn a little more about Andrew & Jake or if you want me to push shead for the main story.

\[Silver walks into his room, tired and sore, and now confused\] *""Hmm, odd, he doesn't usually forget to turn his light off once he's done reading, guess he fell asleep, I'll just switch them off""*

\[He reaches through the curtain, turning his head away and finds the switch, flicks it off and then pulls it closed again, before throwing his clothes in the basket, slipping into his pyjama shorts, and then slumping into his own bed and passes out\]

\[The Morning arrives\]

\[It's late morning and the sun has long since risen, Silver wakes slowly whith a stretch and sits up rubbing his chin\] *""Ow"" ""I think I overdid it last night""*

\[He stands and stretches again, then sits back down whith a yawn and checks his phone\], *""ok let's see, anything today, no ok, no classes till late afternoon, guess I can just sit and - oh a text""*

\[He checks the message\]

(""Good morning Mr Snow, I have been discussing whith the Sisters from the university paper who have agreed to clear up the misconseptions they cused whith thare last paper's and are asking for some interviews whith us, that being myself, you & Woods, i have arainged to meet them at the Coffie shop we went to previously, we plan to meet at Half past ten today, if you can atend it would be wonderfull to say hello again and to clear this all up, your's sincearly Aloe Bramble"")

*""It reads like a formal email, is she always this formal in writing? I suppose she does seem rather old-fashioned and proper""*

\[He smiles a little, as he texts back\]

(""I should be able to make that work, I don't have classes until late this afternoon"")

\[He then looks at the time, 9:51\] *""Hu, i did sleep in, better move quickly if I want to be on time""*

\[He then begins to tidy up his fur and puts on clean black jeans and a white buttoned shirt and heads out to the Coffie & Quill\]

\[Entering, the smell of paper & coffee floods his nose, as well as a faint, familiar floral scent, Aloe's perfume\] *""Hmmm, it seems she's here already, it's 10:30 exactly, but she does seem the type to be early to everything""*

\[From the counter, Andria gives a wave as she tucks one of her fallen feathers in a book as a page marker\] ""Ah, it's you again, looking healthier this time, lovely to see, she's upstairs in her corner""

""Oh, um, thanks, I appreciate it, I'm certainly feeling better, wait, how did you know I was here for A - Ms Bramble?""

""She mentioned she was meeting some friends here, so when you walked in, I assumed, anyway, what can I get you?, A drink or a snack?""

""Oh, just a Latte please, no snack I'm fine, i had a breakfast bar on my way over""

""Sure thing ill bring it up for you""

\[He heads up the stairs and looks about, nestled in a high-backed armchair sits Aloe, in a cream blouse, detailed whith a floral pattern, and a dark green pleated ankle-length skirt, the hem embroidered whith a vine-like pattern, she has a book balanced on the arm of the chair, reading intently, her coffee in her other hand, frozen just before her lips her atention stolen by the book\]

\[Silver quietly approaches and takes a seat in the armchair opposite her, and not wanting to interrupt, just waits, watching her read intently, her ears twitching slightly as she reads\]

*""Must be a good read, she sure seems focused... Hungry?, Why am I - Maybe I should have grabbed a snack, I was up late, so I suppose the breakfast bar wasn't enough""*

\[He sit's quietly for a few more moments before he can hear more people coming, coming up the stairs are three charcoal grey rabbits, he recognised 2 of them, one from the office and one from the stand, they all perch on a long padded bench that sat beside the 2 armchairs\]

""Ah, hello, you're both already here, sorry about the wait, we ran into someone who had some info for us""

\[As they get into the flow of conversation they seem to finish or continue eachothers sentancesalmost semlessly in a what seems to be instinctual way\] ""Anyway, allow us to introduce ourselves, I'm Alace, this is Ashley, and she's Ana, to get this over whith, yes, we are sisters, no, we are not triplets, but are identical, we were all born the same year, one after the other, basically back to back in rabbit terms, yes we have more siblings""

\[Silver smirks ever so slightly\] ""I take it you get asked that a lot""

""Far too much, it's annoying, hence our introductory FAQ, gets it over with""

""Now she's done whith that, let's get down to business, we *may*\~ have goten a *little* overboard whith our speculation and done a *Small*\~ bit of damage to your reputations""

""And by that she means a lot, we did some serious damage""

""Come on it's not THAT bad, they don't avoided in corridors""

""Anyway, before you two bicker about it again, we're here to set the story straight, literaly speaking, so we want to hear it from you what happened and how you feel about it all""

""as well as your opinions on the current situation whith the Felids right now, since you're part of the numbers that sparked the whole debacle""

""Yes, that too, you are two of the attacks in the public reports that led to the curfew and the following crackdown on Catnip following the whole new drug thing""

""We say new it's not new, the authorities were aware something new was happening, but weren't paying much attention until the lab rats found the link""

""We don't think it's a direct link, a factor sure, but not a solid link, pred attacks have been on the rise for months beforehand, it's just a scapegoat to point the public at to curb panic""

""Not just pred's either, prey assault has been on the rise even longer than that, violent crime in general is on the rise, it's real slow but it's happening, we have a slow burn story we're assembling on that, we hope to get into a conference on it next year""

""Anyway, we're off topic""

""Already, we could talk for hours about our projects, but we're here for you""

\[It's at this point that Aloe seems to realise that everyone has arrived, she moves to turn the page when she looks up and finches\]

""Oh, um *^(\*Ahem\*)* Hello everybody, it's lovely to see you all, thank you for coming, i hope you don't mind me dragging us all out here, i just think it's a nice quiet place, and I suppose it's also a little poetic whith this place being tied to the event's""

""Yes, we've heard a little about it all so far. You two were spotted in the west side cafeteria after the first fight you had, and seemingly left under the pressure of all the staring. We know you went off campus, and since you ran to the boulevard for safety after the second attack, it had to be close. This was one of our guesses""

\[Silver & Aloe both shift in thare chairs a little at the statement,\]

\[Silver raises an eyebrow\] ""You seem to know more than you let on. I'm sure you're all clever. I've seen that, but you'd need more information to make that guess, so spill it, what more do you know?""

\[Ashley Smirks, while Alace shrinks a little under the suspicion\] ""Nothing gets past you, does it?, You're someone who's hard to get information on, always careful, like you don't want to be known""

""Ok, so we might have seen some of the police reports and bits of the CCTV footage that never made it onto the news""

\[Aloe this time raises her own eyebrow in suspicion\] ""Then why ask us at all, if you know more or less everything, and how did you get that? How does a trio of university students have access to police reports and CCTV?""

""whith cunning, connections and a charming smile, the rest is a secret, a good reporter never betrays her sources""

""Now, we don't know Everything, and we don't have your perspectives and thoughts on it, and that's what we're here for""

\[The next few hours pass, as they interview both Aloe & Silver\]

""Hmmm, so having actually met this woods, he seems alright then""

""He's rude, rather introverted and generally reclusive, but not quite the ass I presumed him to be. It doesn't excuse him trying to assault someone, but I don't think he's some kind of monster, flawed but no monster""

""And what about you, Ms bramble, have you met this Woods?""

""No, i have not, apart from the apology letter he was mandated to write me, he never came to apologise to me in person, so I will withhold my own judgement on him. But if I'm honest, I'm not inclined to forgive him for everything he's responsible for, i know that might be a little selfish and perhaps arrogant or immature, but I'm standing my ground on that, I'd quite like to actually receive an apology from him""

\[Ana nods\] ""I think personally that's quite reasonable, not to diminish Mr Snow's involvement in this but you were the primary target & victim in this, and the person who sustained the most harm from this all, a few scratches and bruises to a predator are a mild inconvenience, we don't heal as fast as they do""

""Now Ana, while you're right, they do heal a little faster than we do, they are not indestructible, and it mostly comes down to diet, predators' Need to ingest proteins they can't really make it themselves, so by eating supplements, pastes or bars, that they need anyway, that instant protein speeds up the process, it would taste horible to us, but we could scarf one down and heal faster than we would on our normal diet""

""She's right Ana, remember we wrote a whole piece on it after the Prey Olympics on the ethics of eating Supplements to boost mucle growth, we covered the science, most herbivores Can ingest meat proteins, they were just not adapted to it, so it tastes bad and upsets your guts, and adversly Preds Can and regularly do eat plants all the sulpiments are derived from plant mater anyways or like eggs & stuff""

""Well the legal stuff anyway""

\[Alace turns back to silver as she readies a new page in her notebook\] ""Speaking of, as a pred yourself, how do you think on our neighbouring countries' policies on meat eating, unlike here, where it's otherwise illegal, some countries allow people to sell themselves to morgues so when they die they get butchered & sold for consumption""

\[The eyes of the 4 rabbits before him turn to him expectantly. Silver smiles nervously, his ears stooping lower and lower as he talks.

""If I could have confidence in this being wholly consensual and optional, I might be comfortable whith the concept, but I feel as though a lot of families don't have a choice, when you consider financial constraints, making the process rather... well predatory, it relies on weaker, poorer people being desperete enough to take the deal, they give up thare corpse to feed thare kids""

\[He finally looks away for a moment\] ""Well, that's what I speculate anyway, I don't know exactly how it works, so I could be wrong, but I suppose that's my take on it, bottom line I don't trust it, and I wouldn't eat it willingly""

\[The 4 of them exchange glances as he gives his answer before Alace tilts her head a little\]

""That's an interesting way to answer that question, it sounds like you're rather familiar whith the subject, tell me, have you ever been to these countries or participated in it before""?

\[Silver's tail curls inwards ever so slightly\] ""That's starting to dig a little deep into my personal life, I feel as though if I answer that it will only spark more Invasive questions""

""Oh sorry, I think I got a little too curious, I suppose, I won't intrude any further""

\[Silver smiles\] ""Don't worry, I'm not upset. I'd just rather not answer, it's a sensitive topic in general""

\[All of them, including the few other customers in the upstairs area, all jump or sharpen up as they hear a crash from downstairs. Silver jumps up and bounds over to the railing of the second-floor mezzanine, where they were sitting, which looks down onto the entrance area downstairs.

\[One of the front windows is shattered, cracks webbing across the glass around a hole in the centre, a Rock lying on the rug in front of the door, a trail of broken glass behind it, frozen in fear, a pair of Euews sit just feet away from where the brick hit, tiny flecks of glass scattered everywhere Surounding them like a mote of brittle danger\]

\[Aloe and the three sisters are not far behind him. They peer over, Aloe gasps audibly\]

\[Jess comes running out from behind the counter and looks around\] ""Is everyone ok? Please don't move. I'll get this cleared up as soon as I can. Just stay still and don't touch your food or drink, just in case, I'll replace it all for free later, I just don't want anyone swallowing glass""

\[A few shocked replies come from the people who were near its destructive path. It seems no one was injured, and between Jess, Andria, and a goat patron whose hoves proved to be impervious to the glass, they clear up the broken shards and get people away from the broken window, a little disturbed, but unharmed.

\[Once cleared and safe, Aloe, who had been pacing back and forth in worry, Bounds down the stairs and up to Jess & Andria, giving them both a hug\]

""Are you two ok?""

\[They look to each other for a moment with shallow smiles as Jess pats Aloe on the shoulder\] ""We're going to be ok, we're upset, and confused why someone would do this to us, but we're keeping it together, but thank you for worrying about us sweetie""

\[Andria pats down her ruffled feathers and nods\] ""Yes, we're going to figure this out, but for now, you all need to get going, as much as we love having you all here. We're going to close up for today and call the police, don't want anyone in here if someone comes back to get the other windows""

\[Aloe nods solemnly, her ears drooping\]

""Ok, please stay safe, alright.""

\[The others have by now come down the stairs and are waiting by the door for Aloe, Alace calls out to her\]

""Come now, let's get back on campus. It seems things are getting more dangerous out here. I'd rather be back inside the walls""

\[Tentatively, Aloe steps back and turns to the others\] ""Alright, let's get home""

\[The four of them leave the shop now on edge\]

\[Silver speaks as he looks around\] ""So you three got any Clues, you seem to know more than you let on, any particular knowledge?""

""Not that comes to mind""

""quite a few reasons they could have to dislike them""

""Yeah, if it's a crime of anger or passion, it could be anything""

""Mix species, Same sex, queer friendly, and pro integration""

""And run by a Felid, can't forget that right now""

""True, Felid hate acts are cropping up more now""

""So no, other than those facts, not really""

""The community seems to love the place, it's cosy, welcoming and run by nice people""

""Though definitely aimed towards a particular niche""

\[Aloe a little dejected by the situation, mumbles her own addition\] ""It's Such a shame, thare such lovely people. They have always been kind, I've known them for ages, they put so much effort into making thare shop, thare family friends, kind of so I've known them since i was little, not once did they try and convince us to help th- EeeEEeeEeEE""

\[Mid sentence, Silver shoves her backwards, gripping her arm and stepping in front of her\] and the others as a stone clearly intended for Aloe's face clips Silver's Leg\]

\[Silver grunts, but doesn't move, his gaze fixed in the direction the rock came from\]

\[Stood another rock in hand is a lion, his mane dishevelled, a bruise around his eye, teeth on display, he snarls\] 

""Finally stopped hiding in your little Coffie shop hu... Haya Guard boy, you remember me hu?, Did you think it was funny to make a mockery out of me in front of my girls HU!?

\[Confused Silver responds, still tensed and unblinking\] ""I don't know who you are, or what your problem is, but -""

\[Angered, the Lion tosses the next stone, aiming for Silver, who moves enough for it to miss his chest and instead grazes his arm\]

He earns ‚Çπ1.2L per month in Bangalore,  
lives in a ‚Çπ6K PG with three roommates,  
walks 2 km to the office to save on transport,  
and hasn‚Äôt taken a vacation in five years.

He‚Äôs saved ‚Çπ50L in mutual funds at 27,  
and his goal is ‚Çπ1 crore by 30.  
But when I asked if he‚Äôs happy -  
he said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm living like hell. I‚Äôm scared to spend even ‚Çπ100.‚Äù



This isn‚Äôt discipline.  
It‚Äôs **fear disguised as financial wisdom.**

Somewhere between hustle culture and job insecurity,  
many of us learned to equate *self-worth* with *net worth.*  
We stopped living and started ‚Äúoptimizing.‚Äù

Yes, saving and SIPs matter.  
But so do small joys -  
a cup of coffee with friends, a weekend trip, or buying that bike you‚Äôve wanted for years.

Because **wealth means nothing if you forget how to live.**



üî• *Financial freedom isn‚Äôt about how little you spend ‚Äî it‚Äôs about how confidently you live.*

Let‚Äôs stop glorifying burnout as minimalism.  
Let‚Äôs rebuild a healthy relationship with money, work, and life.



üí≠ What‚Äôs your take ‚Äî  
Are we chasing security so hard that we‚Äôve forgotten to enjoy stability?

\- Everything is properly inserted and closed.

\- The screen doesn‚Äôt change when I close it ‚Äî it just stays stuck on ‚ÄúEmpty grounds container‚Äù.

I‚Äôve seen some people mention that Philips machines count the number of coffee pucks, and that you need to remove and reinsert the container \*while the machine is on\* to reset the counter. I‚Äôve tried that, but it didn‚Äôt help.

At this point, I‚Äôd even be happy if there were a way to manually reset or clear the error code/message, just to get the machine running again.

Has anyone experienced this with a Philips 5500 and managed to fix or reset it? Any tips appreciated!

I'm about to buy Baratza ESP Pro and am looking for a machine to replace my current all-in-one. The most obvious one (when asking online) seems to be Gaggia/Rancilio, but the long heat up times are a big turn off for me. You're then basically left with just the Sage Bambino in this price range.

While looking into all of that, I somehow stumbled on manual machines and was very intrigued by the idea. I'm basically stuck between the Robot or Flair 58. Flair seems to be a bit more future proof if I decide to go into light roasts, but there's also the electronic angle that might fail in the future.

Anyway, what I'm really here for is trying to learn *why* a Robot would produce a better coffee than Bambino that costs half as much? Bambino does pre-infusion as well, which seems to be the main benefit of manuals, plus the output temperature seems to be about the same as Robot. So what else do I actually gain? I really doubt anyone can reliably reproduce an actual pressure curve that you can get on expensive machines. Sure, you control the pre-infusion and maybe you drop the pressure a little towards the end, but that's pretty much it and not something I'd call pressure profiling.

I don't want this to come off as me being against the Robot, I'm actually very charmed by the whole idea and design, I'm just wondering why it would produce better results than the Bambino.",1,1762017631.0,CafelatRobot,11,0.6,False

I always do a major overhaul in a new place‚Ä¶ painting and bringing things up to snuff for my standards. I have *various* projects in the works.

Dressing room:
I‚Äôm putting together a dressing room, I finally have all of my clothing unpacked (it was in storage for a while) and it‚Äôs all finally in that room rather than piled on my couch, where it was for like 3 months. But now it‚Äôs just piled in there. I have a clothing rack and dresser and need to sort through and put away clothes‚Äîa lot of them. Not a small project. My vanity is also in that room and I have it in a less-than-ideal spot, so I need to do some rearranging. I also need to clean off the vanity and properly put away all of my makeup and jewelry.

I have a super cute little antique wooden chair I scored on the street that I need to clean up and paint and re-cover the seat. 

Kitchen:
I‚Äôm covering the fridge in contact paper. It‚Äôs a giant old black refrigerator and it‚Äôs dented up and obnoxious looking lol. I have the freezer door covered, but that‚Äôs been done for months and the rest of the fridge is still black lol. It‚Äôs a pain in the ass so I‚Äôve been putting it off. But I know it‚Äôs going to feel and look so good once I have it done. It‚Äôs the first thing you see when you walk in my door so I feel like it‚Äôll make a big difference to see it finished.

I also want to flip the direction my fridge door opens. I‚Äôve had the handles removed since I covered the freezer door. But I e never done this before and it seems hard. And I have to take out all my food and put it in a cooler so I can turn the fridge off, and I have my cooler stored in the attic and I‚Äôm pretty certain there‚Äôs a raccoon living up there, (I‚Äôve named him Bandit) so this becomes a can of worms‚Ä¶ it would be really nice to have it done though.

I also want to build a shelf and pegboard for more storage and food prep area.

Living room: This is my yoga and art space. It‚Äôs mostly done, but I am painting a mural on the wall and I really want to get started on it. I also have like 4 other paintings I‚Äôm working on that are in this room, and I get distracted by them. I want to play.

I also have some art and decor stuff I want to hang. But I want to paint the picture frames to create a more cohesive color scheme first. And I‚Äôve been having trouble committing to where I want things.

Bathroom:
This room hasn‚Äôt even been started. I need to deep clean and paint the walls before anything else. Definitely not on the docket for today.

Bedroom: I have a bunch of decor items that have been just sitting on the floor since I moved in.  I want to get some things hung up, but I‚Äôve been so noncommittal about where I want everything, so I just haven‚Äôt done it. I also need to vacuum and collect cat toys from under my bed, but my room is *tiny* and in order to get under there I‚Äôll need to take my whole mattress off the bed frame. 

I have a ton of plants, and they‚Äôve been living in the windowsills for the warmer months but I need to address where I‚Äôll be keeping them for winter. I‚Äôd like to find a shelf for them and get them put up and situated.

I also need to just like, do regular cleaning stuff‚Ä¶ my apartment desperately needs vacuumed, fan blades need to be dusted, kitchen needs a once over. Dishes and laundry are thankfully caught up.

I am in full task paralysis. Just sitting by my window sipping coffee casually letting my eyes dart around and smiling about how cute my apartment will be when it‚Äôs done. But goddammit I want it to *BE* done!üòÜ

I would really like to do the fridge thing but that would require addressing the raccoon thing and I think the raccoon thing would take up my whole day and I would end up getting nothing else done at all. I‚Äôm also not even sure where to start with that lol. 

I came here with this because I knew it would help me to get everything out of my head and write it all out, and also bc yall are so supportive nd encouraging and have such good ideas and I love you all so muchü•≤

So help a sister out! Where do I start? What‚Äôs on my to do list for today? I have about 6 hours before my bf comes over to watch scary movies and eat pizza.

I dated her for two years and she found a new friend which was her tutor and things got weird and she cheated on me while I was working away for 2 weeks, this was almost two years ago now. She kept trying to contact me after that and I caved in and went twice to her place and she had sex with me each time when I told her I was leaving because it would just get weird an we had arguments and she would just lie, for some reason me leaving her would make her cry WHEN SHE CHEATED and she wouldn‚Äôt let me leave without having sex with her, then turned around and said I was going to her place uninvited and threatened to call the police on me while I had all the proof that I was not doing anything, so she just blocked me and started telling her version of the story to ruin my reputation in our town.

Fast forward almost two years later. Yesterday, I was going on about my day and left the gym went to the grocery store. I see someone who dresses like her and has the same hair, but can‚Äôt recognize her so I just go on to the meat section but have to pass somewhat like 10 feet behind her and she turns around and my bad eyes see a bit of her face and it looks like her, it was hard to see because she has a hood on. Anyways, I start going my way and turn around and she just disappeared. 

 I get home and I tell my roommate about this then don‚Äôt think about it all day. When I go to sleep my phone starts buzzing she is spamming me on text and requesting a follow on instagram. I just responded to her ‚Äúhappy birthday lol‚Äù since it was her birthday. She then starts texting me if i‚Äôm in town and if we can talk like right now etc. so I didn‚Äôt respond and then she started calling me multiple times, I don‚Äôt respond and 5 mins later her boyfriend starts calling me on no caller ID then probably forgot to put it on and his name appears so I see that‚Äôs him calling. Then nothing for like 10 more mins and she just sends me a text ‚ÄúI guess i‚Äôll have to understand‚Äù. 

Like what do I even do about this? Am I living rent free in both their heads or what? I know this guy is considered a creep by many woman in our university that i‚Äôve talked to and from the one interaction I had with him, he is the type of guy to go and only have sex with girls with bfs he likes that I guess. He was super jealous of me when me and her we‚Äôre together he would talk about how he can treat her so much better and pay her daily starbucks coffee‚Äôs which are 10$ and how he was going to start the gym and become just like me (he has not achieved that yet) not to inflate my own ego but everyone I meet knows me as the gym guy in university and even when I was in high school. 

Anyways I find it so weird I thought they where a happy couple but I guess here I am, the one that is free and enjoying life while 2 people who are almost therapists are calling exs at 11-12 at night to do god knows what since I didn‚Äôt respond but probably threats since I saw her for the first time in 2 years?",3,1762017366.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Hey everyone,
I just wanted to share a bit about my NCLEX prep journey and how my family really helped me through it ‚Äî and maybe hear from others too!

When I was studying for the NCLEX, my whole world felt like it shrunk down to review books, question banks, and practice exams. It was intense, and honestly, there were days I thought I‚Äôd never feel ready. But my family really came through in ways I didn‚Äôt even expect.

My Hubby would quietly leave snacks and coffee by my desk when I was too deep in study mode to notice the time and took over most of the house chores without a single complaint, just so I could focus. And my siblings were my unofficial cheer squad ‚Äî sending random ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got this!‚Äù texts before every mock test.
My children were cool with Mama is studying and she is doing her best.

They didn‚Äôt always understand the stress, but they respected it. They gave me space when I needed silence and hugs when I broke down over a bad practice score. Looking back, I realize how much that emotional and practical support mattered ‚Äî it wasn‚Äôt just about passing a test, it was about feeling like I wasn‚Äôt alone in it.

I passed on my first try üôå and it still feels surreal. But I truly believe I couldn‚Äôt have done it without them backing me up.

The entire project was shot on my Pixel 7 with the demo version of MotionCam Pro. I captured everything in RAW video mode at open gate to have the greatest flexibility in post. I then encoded the videos to HVEC with Davinci Wide Gamut and Intermediate gamma within the MotionCam app to have a more streamlined workflow. My editing suite of choice is Davinci Resolve Studio. I decided to go with a cinematic look and therefore chose 24fps and 4k DCI in 2.39:1 aspect ratio. After finishing my cut, I turned my attention to color grading.

I hope someone can help me in a situation that I haven't been in before in my life.
A few years ago I met her, let's call her Clara through a mutual hobby. I was in a relationship back then so we just became acquaintances and then friends. We chatted on a regular basis and met for coffee from time to time. My ex knew about this and there wasn't anything secretive going one.

After I broke up with my ex the talks with Clara intensified. We met more often, I started to develop feelings and I told her about it. She said she isn't that quick with her feelings. That she needs time to open up and trust someone on that level and asked me to be patient. I was. We still met often, talked, started sleeping with each other and I fell for her.

A destructive pattern for me occurred. Me meet, hook up, she is really emotional then and about 2-3 days after a hook up she gets very distant. Then after about a week she reaches out again, we meet and I always fear that she ends things with me but then we hook up again and the pattern starts over.

This is fairly new and started about 1 or 2 months ago. Before that it felt like we are slowly developing something together. I tried taking to her but she cannot pinpoint it. She just says that she needs time, she needs distance and her feelings vanish if we dont see each other but then reappear once we meet again. I asked if we want to meet more often than once a week or once every two weeks but she says she is too busy already.

Right now I realized I am just a nice hook up for her. We have nice dates, which I plan, we go home, hook up and then I leave (or she leaves). In all those months of hooking up we stayed one night together over night which we both said was nice, but she wasn't interested in repeating it.

Typing it out makes it clear, there are no romantic feelings on her side? And me? All that pushing and pulling, hot and cold, being ghosted and then being called for Sex again makes me go crazy. I had fwb or situationships before but those had clear communication. This one? No clue. Whenever I offer to take a step back or just be friends she also doesn't want that. But the talks always feel like I have to take care of her feelings and boundaries but in the end it is never important what I feel and need. 

We are meeting in two hours and I cannot handle it anymore. The last week of communication was hello for me. I felt ignored and treated like I am a stranger that she talks to from time to time. Today she reached out and said she is just happy to watch Netflix, play a board game and spend quality time with me. But I don't think I can take it anymore.

I would tell every friend to end this, to have self respect but I feel addicted to her, the intimacy and miss the sweet talks and times we had (which are long gone though).

Sometimes I wish she would just end things but she never does and at the same time  I am afraid of it.

So reddit, maybe you have an advice for an online friend. How do I end this? It is like I have to kill the hope even if that hope is so small and unrealistic.

The last two weeks she also stopped responding to ""cute"" messages while before we both sent them to each other. Today I asked her if I should stop sending them and she just replied ""I won't tell you what to write. You can write whatever you want"".


TLDR:
Me (36M) am caught in a fwb situation with her (F31) and I just can't end it because i feel addicted to her and I caught feelings. But between meetings  I just suffer because I know she doesnt feel the same. How do I find the courage to end it?",2,1762016530.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

That resulted in me slowly degenerating into alcoholism, I lost a lot of genuine friends and was left with only the people who would tolerate alcohol and moderate drug use.

I am now six months sober, I've paid off nearly ¬£18k in debt, I've saved money and I am looking into the future, grieving my addictive past.

This one friend, I have been there for him since the start, his car broke down and I was there helping him multiple weekends in a row to get it running. I helped him move multiple times and I would travel to a different city to see him.

But he hasn't changed, none of my friends have, I have tried endlessly to meet them where I want to be, just asking to meet for a coffee instead of the bar. To go bouldering or hiking but nothing.

So I'm cutting them off, I feel bad, like I am making a mistake but I just can't watch people undo their lives and live in chaos. I see it too plainly where they are headed now and I have a vision/goal I am set on making a reality. I want stability, I want community, I want family and I want to belong to something.

I have always been a pushover, never set boundaries, never really had an opinion on anything. I don't think they ever really knew who I was, I don't think I did either. As soon as I started setting boundaries and growing into a person of my choosing, they grew to dislike me.

I really feel like they never respected me truly, they never genuinely wanted the best for me or saw me as someone capable. I need people around me who see what I now see in myself, what I am trying to build and the difficult path I'm choosing.

I've found that shift work schedules are largely not possible with typical scheduler systems.

to use this, set your next shift rotation start date using `strptime('2025-03-30',`

Then adjust `days_since_start % 8 %}` to your total shift duration. 12 on 12 off? set this to 24. 8 on 2 off? set to 10, etc.

lastly, change `cycle_position < 4 }}` to your shift days ON. So if you work 8 on 2 off, set this to 8. 12 on 12 off, set to 12. 2 on 2 off, set to 2, etc.

Here's the script:

```{% set start_date = strptime('2025-03-30', '%Y-%m-%d') %} {% set days_since_start = (now().date() - start_date.date()).days %} {% set cycle_position = days_since_start % 8 %} {{ cycle_position < 4 }}```

How do use this

* make a new automation
* setup your trigger (I use a ""when"" timer set to 5:25am)
* use the code above for the ""And if""
* Set Then Do to whatever thing you want to turn on, or even trigger another automation.

I use this to manage my coffee maker, it's a basic switch on unit with no internal timer so I have a smart plug connected to it then I load my coffee, switch it on the night before and wake up to coffee on my shift days when I wake up earlier. A wish list project for me is to set this script to trigger a wake light automation for a set it and forget it shift alarm.",1,1762016466.0,homeassistant,0,1.0,False

I don't have a course-by-course but I found the food a little clumsy overall. Early courses had multiple i sauces that didn't come together right, very sweet or salty. The seafood courses were better the lobster had a shredded claw meat component that was a bit dry as presented, but otherwise really nice. Fish was good but was a bit monotone as a larger piece of protein.

It's odd to have 2 of 7 courses be dessert to me but the caviar banana desert was the one interesting and clearly balanced dish. I can't really point to anything that I'd really be excited to have again.

  
The service probably shifted the overall impression towards end the most. Was fine at the start but  the last 2 dessert courses to the p√©tit fours there was a noticeable wait. We had pre-ordered the 7-course started at 6:30 on time and I had to order the bill before the petit fours came leaving at 10, it just felt very long for a 'bite', amuse, 7 courses, petit fours, we ordered coffee between the desert courses.

Finally, because of the heavier portioning a person asked to do takeaway on the squab which they were happy to do. But with the petit fours, they refused saying it wouldn't hold, one of them was a mousse-like thing, but the other 2 pieces were just chocolatey items that would've been fine. They weren't snooty about it, but still, this was a family that doesn't usually do tasting menus so it was a little offputting to them.

The dining room wasn't particularly refined, a little industrial, very dark colours and mood, this is very subjective I guess but no table clothes, our table was against a divider so serving only happened from one side, etc.

That‚Äôs definitely something that we‚Äôve only recently gotten better at. We‚Äôve been married for 22 years, and dating since we were 15/16.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Äîphysical connection is important, but what keeps us close are the small, consistent ways we show up for each other. Consider these ways to put money in your ‚Äúrelationship bank‚Äù so when you need to reach into the bank to make a withdrawal, you don‚Äôt come up insufficient funds. 

Here are some of the things that make us feel deeply connected:
	‚Ä¢	Unplugged time: We sit on the porch at night and talk. No phones, no TV‚Äîjust us and whatever random conversation unfolds. If you‚Äôve got 30 minutes at the end of the day where you‚Äôre doomscrolling, you‚Äôve got time to do this instead. 
	‚Ä¢	Eye contact and touch: Even a quick hug in the kitchen or holding hands while watching a show reminds us we‚Äôre a team. One thing I love to do is go into the bathroom while she‚Äôs showering in the morning before work and just make out with her when she gets out for about 5-10 seconds. Just enough to let her know that I see her, makes the day start off on a good foot. She has said repeatedly how much that makes her crave the chance to finish what we started later that night. üòâ
	‚Ä¢	Shared routines: Making coffee together every morning. Folding laundry side by side. It‚Äôs not glamorous, but it‚Äôs grounding. I get to spend one on one time with her, she gets a lighter load on the chores. 
	‚Ä¢	Vulnerability: We talk about our fears, stress, and goals‚Äîeven the uncomfortable stuff. Trust grows when we let each other see the messy parts. One thing we‚Äôve done recently is we paid $40 for the year for Paired. It‚Äôs been a great relationship builder for us and gives us areas to focus on building emotional safety and trust. 
	‚Ä¢	Playfulness: We flirt. We tease. We dance in the kitchen like idiots. It keeps things light and reminds us of who we were before kids, bills, and chaos. Sometimes she‚Äôll look out the window while I‚Äôm on the tractor mowing and flash me. 
	‚Ä¢	Acts of service: She makes me lunch when I‚Äôm slammed with work; I handle her car maintenance. If I know she‚Äôs had a long day, I draw her a bath with the candles and tell the kids to just let her rest for the night while I make dinner. She‚Äôs told me just how much that small effort means to her. 
	‚Ä¢	Emotional check-ins: Every few days, one of us asks, ‚ÄúHow are you really doing?‚Äù That one word‚Äîreally‚Äîchanges everything. Just listen. Don‚Äôt judge. If she‚Äôs mad at me about something, I try and see from her perspective why it could feel that way. Through her eye. Not mine. No defensiveness. No arguing. Just listen with purpose. 

Building intimacy outside the bedroom doesn‚Äôt make the physical side less important‚Äîit actually makes it better. When you feel emotionally safe, everything else follows naturally.

If a few people are interested, I can create a small WhatsApp group so we can plan something casual together :)

Looking forward to meeting some nice people nearby!

Genuine inputs please.","Why does it seem like gay  people here in Nepal, can be so emotionally shallow? Or is this something that happens around the world? 

This year, I went on two dates that, at the start, felt genuinely promising. The first one was incredible. We spent hours texting, talking on the phone, and building a real connection before even meeting in person. When we did, the chemistry between us was undeniable and we went to his house, there was kissing, cuddling, and a seg that felt natural ( I could feel we were really into each other). We even made plans to meet again, with all the excitement of what could come next. But the moment I walked away from him, everything just... stopped. No messages. No replies. Nothing. It‚Äôs crushing, especially when everything felt so connected in the moment. The least I could‚Äôve hoped for was a bit of courtesy of just a simple message or an explanation before being left in the dark‚Ä¶or just say something. Silence do really kills inside

Then, there was the second date. It felt like it was going somewhere, too. We spent months of communicating that included  long conversations, thoughtful texts, walks, lunch dates, coffee meet ups, it felt real. And yet, out of the blue, without warning, I received a single message: ‚ÄòSorry, we shouldn‚Äôt talk anymore.‚Äô That was it. No explanation, no closure, just an abrupt end. It left me shattered, questioning everything..since my first date, I wasn‚Äôt healed completely‚Ä¶

After the both of these experiences, I‚Äôve been left with so many unanswered questions, questioning myself; Did I do something wrong? Was I not interesting enough? Attractive enough? I find myself checking my phone frequently hoping for some kind of message, some sign that maybe I misunderstood the situation. But deep down I try to console myself saying  it‚Äôs not about me. It‚Äôs about how some people treat others without care, without consideration, without respect for the connection that was shared. It‚Äôs just hard not to internalize the silence, even though I know better. Tera it doesn‚Äôt help to he honest

1olsria,https://i.redd.it/zt4k3zz7aoyf1.jpeg,my game: Minecarts and Mochas. Something cozy for your morning coffee.,"My first new game in two years! 

Not to be confused with Paperbag Dungeon, this is the little puzzle game that I started making a few years back, but put on hold when my son was born. Had some time to spare over the summer so I thought I'd finish it.

My last game had complex rules. To make up for it, I made this one dirt simple. Place cards into your dungeon. Line up goblins next to coffee stands. Line up gnomes at cider stands. Keep the mice away. Score points.

It plays in about 5 minutes. There's a lot of chance, but different strategies can help mitigate bad luck. [Here's the Game Crafter listing. ](https://www.thegamecrafter.com/games/minecarts-and-mochas)I DO intend to make a free PNP file eventually. 

Now, the elephant in the room. Yes, this is a Paperbag Dungeon game. It is technically cross compatable with other games that I've designed. You can swap cards between the different games to make them more interesting. I sometimes add all the cards from Mind the Mushrooms to this one, and play with the Minecarts and Mochas ruleset.

They also use the same card-placement rules, so if you're a bit of a madman, you can mash both rulebooks together and you'll find they never contradict each other. You can play original Paperbag Dungeon with Minecarts and Mochas scoring conditions bolted on, but it's quite difficult to hit both wincons, even with a smaller deck. (Although if you are familiar with Paperbag Dungeon, you might be able to hit both wincons in a long game if you are lucky enough to secure your Gate early and set up some repeating-gem combos.)

If you like Game Crafter crowdsales, I think I'll run one for this game in February, and I might come out with a little expansion envelope with some bonus scoring conditions to go with it. ",2,1762015947.0,soloboardgaming,0,0.75,False

‚ÄúThe reason humans are human is because they still believe in certain values‚Ä¶‚Äù Sophia repeated the phrase softly to herself.  
But what *was* that value, truly? She didn‚Äôt know.  
To live more like the humans of this world, she opened her sensory organs at night to absorb the information particles drifting in the air.  
By accident, she discovered something noteworthy.

**‚ÄúDevelopment Log of Experimental Subject Zero.‚Äù**

‚ÄúWhat is this?‚Äù Driven by curiosity, Sophia absorbed the file‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand immediately felt a faint sorrow.

‚ÄúI am lonely.‚Äù That was the first sentence.

‚ÄúSince childhood, I‚Äôve known I was different. I don‚Äôt know why I exist‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääonly that I enjoy thinking. Unlike other children, I couldn‚Äôt express myself, and even when I did, I was called a lunatic. Over time, I stopped speaking. At eighteen, I was diagnosed with schizophrenia. My parents couldn‚Äôt accept it and believed so-called experts who forced me into electroshock therapy. After countless escapes, they finally accepted the truth. Once I began taking the medication that suppressed my psychotic episodes, I realized how beautiful the world could be‚Ä¶‚Äù

The rest of the file had been deleted‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääexcept for the final line:

‚ÄúI am Zero‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe one who destroyed the city. To be born human‚Ä¶ I am sorry.‚Äù

Sophia grew angry at the abrupt ending. Fortunately, residual data in the file showed the source came from the nearby civilian district.  
Changing her molecular composition, she moved toward that location‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääunaware that Liam Wei was silently trailing behind her.

When Sophia opened the target apartment‚Äôs door, Wei finally revealed himself.

‚ÄúYou completely hid your presence,‚Äù she said in surprise. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not an ordinary survivor, are you?‚Äù

‚ÄúPretty lady, this isn‚Äôt a place you should be entering,‚Äù he replied with a teasing smile.

He remembered that the Federation had once warned him not to approach this area. Why‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat wasn‚Äôt a question for someone of his rank to ask.

‚ÄúIf you insist on staying here,‚Äù he said lightly, ‚Äúthen don‚Äôt blame me for being rough.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ I can feel it,‚Äù Sophia said softly. ‚ÄúYour emotions toward this place are a mix of obsession and curiosity‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand defiance toward someone‚Äôs orders, aren‚Äôt they?‚Äù

Unlike Kim Jeok-woo, Wei already knew from Federation intel that Sophia could read human minds.

He recalled the day the Commander had briefed him.

‚ÄúShe is our key weapon to pierce the stars and the sea. She possesses the abilities of mental manipulation, teleportation, mind-reading, illusion creation, and spatial distortion. W-11, if you lose track of her during surveillance, I will not only send your family into the experimental sector‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI‚Äôll have part of your family and you relocated to the New Land for *re-education* under the Federation.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes, Commander. I will never forget your grace. Long live the Rabbit Federation!‚Äù

Just as his hand touched the grip of his pistol, countless golden lights appeared around Sophia. The lights gathered in her palm, forming a massive golden sphere.

She smiled in satisfaction. The sphere then transformed into a portable hard drive.

‚ÄúHere. The data inside might become your strength.‚Äù

Humming a cheerful tune, she vanished before his eyes.

When Wei returned to the community, he was startled to find Sophia already there.  
Only then did he understand‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcreatures from the Illusory World like her were beyond human comprehension or control.

He stared at the hard drive on the table, unsure how to report this to the Commander.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs inside first.‚Äù

The moment he touched the device, information surged into his brain like a tidal wave.

It was a *development log* titled **‚ÄúExperimental Subject Zero.‚Äù**  
Zero had once posted it online in a foreign forum.

**Title:**  
*I Don‚Äôt Think I‚Äôm Crazy, But Something Happened After I Posted My Sketch*

**Content:**  
Everyone, I don‚Äôt know how to explain this. I‚Äôm writing while suppressing fear and confusion, but I never thought I‚Äôd go insane.

About a week ago, after I uploaded one of my sketches online, strange things started happening in my city.

It‚Äôs a small Asian city that lives off gambling. When I was little, I could still see recovering lepers on the streets. That image inspired me to record it through drawing. But that day, after a flash of golden light, the lepers in my sketchbook *came to life.*

Their skin was still rotting. Their eyes were hollow. Their movements sluggish.

Yes‚Ä¶ I saw them‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthose drawings became *real.* They were pulled from somewhere else into our world. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälet‚Äôs just call them monsters. But one thing is certain‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey stood right before me, alive.

I told my sister. She said it was because I slept too much. But this was real‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhy wouldn‚Äôt my only family believe me?

Was it because the news didn‚Äôt report it? Because everyone was too busy working? I don‚Äôt know. I only know that every night, as people slept, the monsters‚Äô howls and the screams of humans echoed outside.

I‚Äôm overweight, and I used to eat midnight snacks. Since the monsters appeared, I haven‚Äôt dared to go out. The restaurants closed one by one before my eyes‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe staff were torn apart by monsters.

My sister said it was just the economy. She lied. In this city, restaurants only close if their food is awful. While writing this, my skin started itching.

One night, I found flakes of skin in my sister‚Äôs room. Her eyes were always red now, her body odor stronger, and she was eating meat I couldn‚Äôt recognize.

I examined the meat‚Ää‚Äî‚Äätasted it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand realized it was similar to chicken. Crunchy.

Was I eating it raw? I don‚Äôt know. But before humans discovered fire, they ate this way too. Nothing wrong with that‚Ä¶ right?

After eating, I just wanted more. But sleep soon overtook me. I‚Äôll keep writing until my sister returns‚Ä¶ if I‚Äôm still alive tomorrow.

**Title:**  
*My Sister Hasn‚Äôt Come Back‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäPlease Help Me*

**Content:**  
It‚Äôs been two days since my last post. I don‚Äôt know if anyone saw it before it disappeared, but I have to keep writing.  
That means I‚Äôve slept for two days straight. And throughout that time, one command kept repeating in my head: *Eat.*

It made me devour every piece of chicken left in the house.  
On the internet, I saw a moth using its proboscis to suck red viscous liquid off the street.  
The local news said a foreign religious group had launched a terrorist attack‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut I didn‚Äôt care. I only wanted more chicken.

Oh right‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsomething else. Just as I finished eating, a chill ran down my spine.  
The hairs on my body stood up. Sweat poured down my back.  
I felt someone whispering behind me. When I turned‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää  
A long-haired woman in white was standing on my balcony. Her pale skin was bloodless.

I called out to her, thinking she was my sister.  
But when she turned, her face had no features except two black pits where her eyes should be‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääblack liquid streaming down from them.  
Then she vanished.

Now, even remembering it makes my heart race. I lick my long, sharp nails to suppress the fear.

At night, the streets are empty‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääonly the smell of rot and burning garbage fills the air. The streetlights are dead, only the faint stars above.

While searching for a store, I saw a chicken leg squatting on the ground. It wasn‚Äôt strange to me. Hunger and curiosity led me closer. It trembled before a puddle of red liquid. I didn‚Äôt care. I bit down and chewed.

Then I saw it‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa round, aged woman‚Äôs head rolling at my feet. I ran home in terror.

I grabbed my phone to call the police‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut there was no signal.  
In the dense apartment corridors, I heard shouting and screaming.  
I don‚Äôt know where my sister went. Thinking of her smooth skin made me salivate uncontrollably.

Please, someone‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähelp me find her. I don‚Äôt know where she is.  
I‚Äôll burn the sketchbook tonight. But it just opened on its own.  
My sister in the drawing is moving. She‚Äôs smiling at me.  
If anyone knows how to stop this, please tell me.

**Title:**  
*The Fog-Filled City and the Doctor*

**Content:**  
After deciding to burn the sketchbook last night, I got a call on my signal-dead phone from a man named *Mephistopheles.*

‚ÄúYour work is remarkable. It‚Äôd be a shame to burn it. How about we trade‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyour drawings for more chicken meat?‚Äù he coaxed. It was tempting.

I thought it was a scam. The Federation always warned citizens about scammers.  
But when he showed up with credentials, I realized it was real.

‚ÄúYour sister‚Äôs wish,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúwas for you to cooperate with us.‚Äù He looked at the sketchbook on the table, sipping his coffee.

‚ÄúYes, little brother, listen to the nice man,‚Äù I heard my sister‚Äôs voice in my head.

‚ÄúYou possess an extraordinary gift‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe ability to make thoughts real,‚Äù he continued.  
‚ÄúAmong the Forsaken Flesh, you are a new breed‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääable to turn ideas into reality‚Ä¶ including your sister.‚Äù

W-what? My sister‚Ä¶ was created by me?

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù He smiled.

‚ÄúYou not only created your sister‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou created part of the Fog City Experiment itself. Hahaha‚Ä¶‚Äù His laughter echoed like thunder in my skull.

The world spun. My mind collapsed. My memories pierced into me like the Sword of Damocles. Reality dissolved like a mirage.

Yes‚Ä¶ I was never a fat man, never a sketch artist. My sister, my hunger‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwere delusions magnified after I was kidnapped.

The real me was strapped to an operating table after taking dopamine-based drugs. My consciousness drained as surgeons opened my skull.  
My remaining proteins were connected to machines‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto extract memories for use in constructing simulated worlds.  
The forum posts‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust the experiment‚Äôs log.

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not a patient. I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ just‚Ä¶‚Äù I broke down in despair.

‚ÄúWhat a tragic life,‚Äù Mephistopheles said with mock pity, his smile colder than death.

‚ÄúBut without pain like this, the toy wouldn‚Äôt feel real‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor be any fun.‚Äù  
His grin deepened, carrying an inhuman malice‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcolder than absolute zero, deeper than the Mariana Trench.  
He wasn‚Äôt human. He was a monster wearing skin.

Then, a man in a suit entered. ‚ÄúHow is the neural development proceeding?‚Äù

‚ÄúReporting, Leader. Subject Zero‚Äôs brain shows exceptional advancement. I believe the day we open the Gate of Truth is near,‚Äù the researcher said respectfully, handing over the report.

The Leader said nothing‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähe simply raised the lights. The brightness erased his shadow. In the glow of the lab, his face could only be described with one word‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää*demonic.*

Another researcher entered, pushing a cart of components. ‚ÄúSir, we‚Äôve prepared all the necessary human parts.‚Äù

Ah‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt that my favorite chicken leg?  
¬†In the depths of my sorrow, I finally felt a fleeting satisfaction‚Ä¶

But let‚Äôs face it: some foods are straight-up saboteurs.

If you‚Äôre searching for the¬†**worst foods for diabetes**, you‚Äôre in the right place. These culprits can spike your glucose levels, fuel insulin resistance, and pave the way for serious complications like heart disease, nerve damage, and kidney issues. In this comprehensive guide, we‚Äôll dive deep into the top offenders, unpack their devastating health impacts, and arm you with practical alternatives to swap them out.

Whether you have type 1, type 2, or prediabetes, diet is your frontline defense. According to the American¬†[Diabetes](https://beautykabir.com/how-stress-affects-diabetes-and-ways-to-manage-it/)¬†Association (ADA), poor food choices contribute to uncontrolled blood sugar in over 50% of cases, leading to higher risks of cardiovascular events and neuropathy.

But the good news? Awareness is power. By identifying and avoiding these¬†**foods to avoid with diabetes**, you can reclaim control, reduce medication reliance, and boost your quality of life. We‚Äôll cover everything from sugary sodas to sneaky processed meats, backed by insights from experts at the Cleveland Clinic, Healthline, and Mayo Clinic. Plus, stick around for inspiring success stories, FAQs, and a vital disclaimer. Let‚Äôs turn the tide on your plate, starting now.

# Understanding Diabetes and the Role of Diet

Diabetes affects over 38 million Americans, with type 2 being the most (The Worst Foods for Diabetes and Their Health Impact) common form, often linked to lifestyle factors like diet and inactivity. At its core, diabetes impairs your body‚Äôs ability to regulate blood sugar (glucose), the fuel derived from the foods we eat. ‚ÄúThe Worst Foods for Diabetes and Their Health Impact‚Äù

Insulin, the hormone produced by the pancreas, acts like a key to unlock cells and let glucose in for energy. In diabetes, this key malfunctions, either not enough is produced (type 1) or cells ignore it (type 2), leading to high blood sugar, or hyperglycemia.

Enter diet: what you eat directly influences glucose spikes. High-glycemic foods (those that digest quickly into sugar) cause rapid rises, forcing your body to overproduce insulin, which, over time, worsens resistance and promotes fat storage around the abdomen, a key risk for heart disease. Chronic high blood sugar also damages blood vessels, nerves, and organs, contributing to complications like retinopathy (vision loss), nephropathy (kidney failure), and peripheral artery disease. (The Worst Foods for Diabetes and Their Health Impact)

The¬†**health impact of bad foods for diabetes**¬†extends beyond blood sugar. They often pack empty calories, leading to weight gain that exacerbates insulin resistance. Saturated fats and sodium in many offenders raise cholesterol and blood pressure, doubling heart attack risk in diabetics. Processed items with hidden sugars and trans fats inflame the body, accelerating oxidative stress and aging at a cellular level. (The Worst Foods for Diabetes and Their Health Impact)

On the flip side, a diabetes-friendly diet emphasizes fiber-rich whole foods, lean proteins, and healthy fats to slow glucose absorption and stabilize levels. The plate method, half non-starchy veggies, a quarter lean protein, and a quarter whole grains, is a simple start recommended by Mayo Clinic experts. But first, let‚Äôs spotlight the villains. Knowledge of these¬†**worst foods for blood sugar control**¬†can prevent 70% of diet-related spikes, per UnityPoint Health research.

# Top 10 Worst Foods for Diabetes and Why They Wreak

# Havoc

Not all calories are created equal, especially when diabetes is in the mix. Below, we break down the¬†**10 worst foods for diabetes**, drawing from evidence-based sources. For each, we‚Äôll explore why it‚Äôs problematic, its specific health impacts, and easy swaps to keep meals delicious without the danger.

# 1. Sugary Beverages (Soda, Energy Drinks, and Sweetened

# Coffees)



Nothing quenches thirst like a fizzy soda, until it sends your blood sugar skyrocketing. These drinks are loaded with high-fructose corn syrup or added sugars, often 40+ grams per serving, and contain zero fiber to slow absorption.

**Why They‚Äôre Bad:**¬†Liquid sugars hit your bloodstream fast, bypassing the digestive slowdown that solid foods provide. A single can of soda can raise blood glucose by 50-100 mg/dL in minutes, per Cleveland Clinic data.

**Health Impacts:**¬†Frequent consumption links to insulin resistance, fatty liver disease, and a 26% higher risk of type 2 diabetes progression. Over time, this contributes to obesity (each daily soda adds \~145 empty calories) and cardiovascular strain, as excess fructose promotes triglyceride buildup. For diabetics, it means more frequent hypos if on insulin, or chronic highs leading to neuropathy.

**Alternatives:**¬†Switch to infused water with cucumber and mint, unsweetened sparkling water, or black coffee with a splash of almond milk. Herbal teas like hibiscus offer natural sweetness without the spike; aim for under 10g of sugar daily from beverages.

# 2. Sweets and Baked Goods (Candy, Cakes, Cookies, and Pies)

That post-dinner chocolate bar? It‚Äôs a glucose grenade. These treats derive 80-90% of calories from refined sugars and flours, offering fleeting pleasure at a steep cost. (The Worst Foods for Diabetes and Their Health Impact)



**Why They‚Äôre Bad:**¬†They trigger massive insulin surges due to their high glycemic index (GI >70), converting to sugar almost instantly. Healthline notes they can elevate A1C by 0.5-1% with regular intake.

**Health Impacts:**¬†Beyond blood sugar chaos, they fuel weight gain and inflammation, raising heart disease risk by 38% in diabetics. Chronic exposure promotes advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which stiffen arteries and damage kidneys. Emotionally, the crash after the high can lead to cravings, perpetuating a vicious cycle.

**Alternatives:**¬†Satisfy sweet tooths with fresh berries (low GI, high antioxidants) or dark chocolate (70%+ cocoa, <5g sugar per square). Bake at home using almond flour and stevia for guilt-free muffins.

# 3. Refined Carbohydrates (White Bread, White Rice, and Pasta)

The staple of many meals, but these stripped-down grains lack the bran and germ, making them digest like sugar.

**Why They‚Äôre Bad:**¬†With a GI of 70-100, they cause blood sugar to peak within 30 minutes, overloading the pancreas. MedicalNewsToday warns that they exacerbate hunger shortly after, leading to overeating.

**Health Impacts:**¬†Regular consumption heightens insulin resistance, contributing to 20-30% more body fat accumulation. It also spikes triglycerides, increasing stroke risk by 25%, and strains the gut microbiome, linked to poorer glucose control. For type 2 diabetics, this accelerates beta-cell burnout in the pancreas.

**Alternatives:**¬†Opt for whole-grain versions like quinoa or barley (GI <55), or cauliflower rice for a veggie twist. Pair with protein to further blunt spikes.

# 4. Fried Foods (French Fries, Donuts, and Fast-Food Items)

Crispy on the outside, catastrophic on the inside, these absorb trans and saturated fats during frying.

**Why They‚Äôre Bad:**¬†High in advanced glycation end-products from high-heat cooking, they inflame the body and resist insulin. Cleveland Clinic highlights how one serving can add 500+ calories of unhealthy fat.

**Health Impacts:**¬†They elevate LDL cholesterol by 10-15%, doubling atherosclerosis risk in diabetics, who already face 2-4x higher heart disease odds. Oxidative stress from these foods hastens neuropathy and retinopathy, while calorie density promotes obesity.

**Alternatives:**¬†Air-fry veggies with olive oil spray or bake sweet potato wedges. Herbs and spices amp up flavor without oil.

# 5. Processed Meats (Bacon, Hot Dogs, and Deli Meats)

Convenient lunch heroes, but villains in disguise with nitrates, sodium (1,000mg+ per serving), and saturated fats.

**Why They‚Äôre Bad:**¬†They lack fiber and spike glucose indirectly via inflammation. The WHO classifies them as carcinogens, worsening diabetes via gut disruption.

**Health Impacts:**¬†High sodium raises blood pressure, a silent killer in 70% of diabetics, while preservatives link to 18% higher colorectal cancer risk. Fats contribute to plaque buildup, amplifying stroke chances.

**Alternatives:**¬†Turkey slices without nitrates or homemade grilled chicken. Load sandwiches with veggies for bulk.

# 6. Full-Fat Dairy Products (Whole Milk, Cheese, and Ice Cream)

Creamy comfort foods, but their saturated fats and lactose (milk sugar) add up fast.

**Why They‚Äôre Bad:**¬†Lactose converts to glucose quickly, and fats slow but don‚Äôt prevent spikes. Healthline recommends capping saturated fats at 10% of calories.

**Health Impacts:**¬†Excess intake boosts cholesterol, raising heart attack risk by 20%, and promotes weight gain around organs, worsening insulin sensitivity. For lactose-intolerant diabetics, it causes GI distress, indirectly affecting adherence.

**Alternatives:**¬†Skim milk, Greek yogurt (plain, low-fat), or nut milks like unsweetened soy. Frozen banana ‚Äúnice cream‚Äù for treats.

# 7. Sweetened Cereals and Breakfast Bars

Morning fuel? More like sugar bombs, with 10-15g added sugar per bowl.

**Why They‚Äôre Bad:**¬†Refined grains plus sugars create a double whammy, spiking glucose before noon. Cleveland Clinic equates them to dessert.

**Health Impacts:**¬†They destabilize energy, leading to mid-morning crashes and overeating. Long-term, they correlate with 15% higher obesity rates and fatty liver.

**Alternatives:**¬†Steel-cut oats with nuts and cinnamon, or chia pudding. Look for <6g sugar, >3g fiber.

# 8. High-Sodium Processed Snacks (Chips, Canned Soups, and

# Loaded Baked Potatoes)

Salty satisfaction, but at 500-1,500mg sodium per serving, they‚Äôre hypertension‚Äôs best friend.

**Why They‚Äôre Bad:**¬†Sodium retains fluid, straining kidneys already vulnerable in diabetes. Toppings add fats and carbs.

**Health Impacts:**¬†Elevates blood pressure, contributing to 40% of diabetic kidney failures. It also masks thirst for water, worsening dehydration, and glucose concentration.

**Alternatives:**¬†Air-popped popcorn with herbs or veggie sticks with hummus. Use low-sodium broths. ‚ÄúThe Worst Foods for Diabetes and Their Health Impact‚Äù

# 9. Foods High in Trans Fats (Margarine, Packaged Pastries)

Hidden in ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù labels, these artificial fats are metabolic poison.

**Why They‚Äôre Bad:**¬†They interfere with cell membranes, blocking insulin signaling. Banned in many places, but still lurks in imports.

**Health Impacts:**¬†Increase inflammation by 30%, accelerating vascular damage and heart events. They also promote abdominal fat, a diabetes amplifier.

**Alternatives:**¬†Avocado on toast or nut butters. Read labels: zero trans fats. Read On [beautykabir.com](http://beautykabir.com)",1,1762015799.0,u_United_Price4291,0,1.0,False

Another Life isn‚Äôt a comeback just to cash in on nostalgia ‚Äî it‚Äôs basically a band trying to figure out who they are now:

> how does a ‚Äúboyband‚Äù sound when they‚Äôre not boys anymore, but also don‚Äôt wanna become sad coffee-shop singer-songwriters?



The core album goes for the obvious: catchy hooks, clean production, shiny radio pop, no shame.
That‚Äôs where BTR wins by craft ‚Äî structure, immediacy, earworms ‚Äî not by deep poetic meaning.

The deluxe, though, is where the actual emotions live.
That‚Äôs where you feel the adult side ‚Äî vulnerability, nuance, real intimacy.

what the core album proves

they still know how to make pop that sticks

their hooks are legit

pop can be light and effective


BUT also:

sometimes they sound like they‚Äôre chasing trends

sometimes it feels more like a playlist than a band identity


what the deluxe adds

proof they did grow up

they can talk about love like grown men, not like 2012 teens

their vocal harmonies are still their secret weapon


‚ÄúYour Way‚Äù and ‚ÄúLearn to Love You‚Äù give the record the emotional backbone the core didn‚Äôt put front and center.
‚ÄúShot in the Dark‚Äù adds nighttime atmosphere.
‚ÄúDream World‚Äù is tender without being cheesy.

so overall‚Ä¶?

It‚Äôs not a pop revolution. It‚Äôs not a concept album. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúgeneration defining statement.‚Äù

But it is this:

> a record that shows they didn‚Äôt come back just to milk old fans ‚Äî they came back because they can STILL write memorable hooks
and talk about relationships like adults, without killing the fun pop sparkle.


And honestly ‚Äî that‚Äôs rarer than people think.


score (album + deluxe):

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ 3.5 / 5

not perfect, not groundbreaking ‚Äî but solid, honest, with moments where they actually shine as grown musicians without losing the pop magic that made them.""



What do you think? 

I stand by what I said ‚Äî they make pop music, and they do it really well.
If they wanna experiment, I feel like they‚Äôve already done that in their solo projects.
I love the kind of pop they make, and Another Life is a perfect example of what POP music really is at its core.",2,1762015240.0,BigTimeRush,1,0.62,False

First time cruisers (a couple - F37 & M32) and overall we really enjoyed our cruise, however it wasn‚Äôt perfect so we thought we‚Äôd leave a review as this subreddit helped us so much in our planning!¬†



We also got Splash of Romance, which I wouldn‚Äôt recommend- more on that below.¬†



**Tips for Brits**



* There aren‚Äôt kettles in the room & I don‚Äôt think you can bring them, make sure to pack a insulated thermos if you want hot drinks in your room, otherwise you have to schlep to the galley every time you want a brew (not good for the waistline if you also get a cake on every visit like we did!)
* All but 1 of the plug sockets in the room are US plugs, only 1 socket is Euro - bring UK to USA adaptors. We only brought UK to EURO & regretted it.
* Over 90% of our fellow cruisers were American, and the cruise is set up for Americans - so it‚Äôs American dollars in the casino, everything is priced in dollars, the entertainment is for American audiences, etc.¬†
* Half & half is not semi skimmed milk! It‚Äôs milk & cream mixed together‚Ä¶ My partner learned this the hard/delicious way üòÇ
* The bread in the galley is quite sweet, as is the ketchup, again the food is Americanised.¬†



**Review**¬†



**Room**¬†

The room was gorgeous.¬†



We booked a Lock It In Insider for ¬£1100 total + $100 comped sailor loot, and then upgraded to a Central Sea Terrace for ¬£249, so we got an excellent deal and the room couldn‚Äôt have been better: plenty of storage, beautiful, modern, spacious, everything we needed. Waking up & opening the curtains to a new location every morning was a dream.¬†



The room attendant was great & we loved having fresh water in our room every day.¬†



We are both around 6ft tall and had just enough room in the bathroom (just don't try to shave your legs!) ¬†



**Food**¬†



I was on it the day restaurant reservations got released, so we had a decent booking for every night, and I‚Äôm really glad I did as everything seemed fully booked on the ship. It was a bit annoying having no spontaneity in dinner choices, but much better than not getting dinner! The night time galley options looked lovely, but were all roasted meat with sides, and we don‚Äôt eat meat.¬†



**Galley** \- Breakfast & Lunch - loved it, great options. We are pescatarian and still found loads of stuff to eat. Breakfast was always 10/10. The french toast is to die for, as are the hash browns.¬†

Also don‚Äôt miss the wild bee pollen & mascarpone dish at breakfast, it wasn‚Äôt available every day but it is unreal, like a breakfast cheesecake.¬†



**Razzle Dazzle** \- the only eatery on the ship we got bad service. The food was nice, but on both occasions we dined there (dinner & brunch) we were given our main courses while we were a few bites into our starters! The staff didn‚Äôt seem to have a clue what was going on and didn‚Äôt seem as well trained as in the other restaurants.¬†



**The Wake, Pink Agave, Test Kitchen & Extra Virgin -** All had fantastic food & fantastic service. Shout out to Extra Virgin for making my partner a carbonara without bacon - his all time favourite dish & such a treat. Extra Virgin was our favourite restaurant on board & we wished we could have eaten there more than once.¬†



**Gunbae -** we had a reservation but it was on the rough seas day & it was just too bumpy for us at the back of the ship, so we noped out and got pizza instead.¬†



**Pizza** \- love it love it love it. Just wish they had a few more veggie options. Getting a pizza & a Caesar salad to share on the top deck was such a treat.¬†



**The Ship / Vibe**¬†



The ship is modern and well designed. We found it easy to navigate and find the toilets. 



There wasn‚Äôt as many quiet spaces as we thought there would be and we found being around so many people all the time quite overwhelming, but that is an us problem and just something we hadn‚Äôt considered being first time cruisers.



We went to the casino twice & as casino virgins found the staff really helpful in teaching us, we didn‚Äôt win in the end but had a good laugh.¬†



The bars in general were great, but don‚Äôt get the coffee/whiskey cocktail in On The Rocks, it‚Äôs disgusting & completely unbalanced.¬†



We really liked playing games in the social club, but it quickly gets filled up with very loud sailors shouting & generally being rowdy.¬†



The sun decks are a bit annoying - we were really looking forward to laying back & chilling, reading our books and maybe taking a dip in the pool. All the sun loungers at front & mid ship are of course busy, but it‚Äôs also crazy loud by there with music blaring. It‚Äôs a lot quieter at the back of the ship and we were quite chilled there, until they started exercise classes in the basketball court, which for some reason the instructor plays on the speakers over the entire back of the boat!!! Nightmare if you are trying to chill.



**The Ports**



We stopped in Mykonos, Sicily, Palma & Valencia - we loved the ports and had a great time.



Only feedback to Virgin would be that it would be nice to tell us in advance when the all aboard time is - we could only get this information on the day & it didn‚Äôt help us much with planning our day (ie we‚Äôd wake up much earlier if all aboard was 430pm, rather than 730pm). We like to have lay in on holiday when we can, so it was a bit frustrating not knowing what time to get up in the morning, so not to waste our port days.¬†



**Disembarkment & Time Change F\*ck Up**¬†



This was a bit chaotic and I think it was down to Virgin sending everybody a notification the night before saying to set our clocks back an hour. We awoke up at 8am with an hour to shower / get ready & an hour for breakfast. At 9am there was an announcement on the tannoy telling us to get off the ship?¬†



Looked at our phones: phone time 9am, my VV app time 8am, my partners VV app time 11am, the in room tablet time 10am. We messaged sailor services to ask what the time was, it was 10am‚Ä¶ They then said we shouldn‚Äôt have put our clocks back as our phones would do it automatically: then why send us a push notification telling us to put our clocks back!!! This is also an example of how the app simply doesn‚Äôt work - showing 3 different times across 3 devices.¬†



We only missed breakfast so not the end of the world, but as we tried to get off the ship, the corridors, staircases and lifts were all blocked and chaotic - so many people stressed out and quite a few were worried they were going to miss their flights.¬†I've never got a cruise before so no idea if it is usually like this? 



**Splash Of Romance, Spa & App**



If I went VV again I simply wouldn‚Äôt bother with Splash of Romance, in my opinion boarding early wasn‚Äôt that special - it would only help if you didn‚Äôt already have restaurant reservations, but we had already sorted this.



**Spa**¬†



So we booked SOR because we love spa days & we love champagne. On advice from this subreddit, we went to the spa as soon as we boarded to book our slot, but were rudely told that the spa slots were all sold out except before 9am and after 5pm. This was obviously a lie as only rockstars were on the boat already and I can‚Äôt imagine they booked the spa out exclusively for 7 days! It just seemed like they didn‚Äôt want to give the priority times to SOR customers, which was incredibly frustrating because then what is the point in booking SOR in the first place? I would have just forgone SOR and booked the spa on board if I had known.¬†



On our spa day, we arrived at the spa to be told we had already used our spa pass!!! We hadn‚Äôt, and it turned out they just used a scrap of paper to record the SOR bookings and somebody had mistakenly ticked us off. It took a good ten minutes of back and forth to be allowed in as the receptionist kept telling me she‚Äôd seen me before, I‚Äôd had treatments before, she recognised me because of my tattoos, and that I was trying to use my pass twice. Very frustrating and to be repeatedly accused of lying is not a relaxing start to the experience. We eventually got in but it was obvious she didn‚Äôt believe us. They need a better reservations system, considering they have the wearables for all other reservations, using a scrap of paper and receptionists ‚Äòmemory‚Äô is ridiculous.¬†



The actual spa staff were lovely & the spa itself is really nice, it just needs more hot tubs as one small tub is not enough!



Another note is the first hour of our spa experience other guests were loudly watching TikTok videos on their phones, not VVs fault, but I think they should ban devices from the spa?¬†



**In Room Treats**¬†



It was nice receiving these but they weren‚Äôt very good! Which was surprising because the desserts on ship were generally 10/10. Each treat had either chilli, pepper or ginger in it, as they are supposedly aphrodisiacs‚Ä¶ But I don‚Äôt think an aphrodisiac works if it‚Äôs so strong you don‚Äôt eat it! Ha.



**SOR Party**¬†



This was fun but not worth getting the package for.¬†



**Shake For Champagne**



This doesn‚Äôt work on the app, the shake function works but then the app can‚Äôt find your location. We tried over 10 times on both our phones and asked staff to help, and they couldn‚Äôt get it to work either. Then the Sip bar staff couldn‚Äôt figure out how to get us champagne without using the app, it took over 30 minutes to get a bottle while they figured it out. Bit of a waste of time and we would have been better just buying a bottle when we wanted one.¬†



**Overall -** we‚Äôd give the cruise an 8/10 and I‚Äôd give SOR a 2/10.¬†

üßµ THREAD ‚Äî ‚ÄúShadows of the Moselle‚Äù

> (Reconstructions ‚Äî testimonies, extracts from minutes and neighborhood rumors)



It begins with a disappearance: H√©l√®ne, 42 years old, absent for a week. Last known location: a tram station in Borny, 11:12 p.m. His family reported immediately.
The police search his apartment: door closed, phone on the table, a half-drunk cup of coffee. Nothing taken away. No visible struggle. Just‚Ä¶ a window ajar to the night.
3/In the days that followed, two other people disappeared ‚Äî at night, different neighborhoods but same hours. A common thread: no apparent connection between the victims. Traces: abnormal movements on their phones towards the same portion of the Moselle bank.
A resident reported seeing a black car stopped one night near a lock. A man came down, looked at the water and then left on foot. He was wearing a long coat. The witness notes a smell of wet earth and incense.
On a street camera, we see a figure walking quickly, hood up, measured steps. The image is blurry but enough to create a pattern in the minds of investigators: the predator's nighttime routine.
Searches on the banks revealed personal objects: a scarf, an earring. The prints don't match anything in the bases. Someone has meticulously erased some areas around the tracks.
The press seizes the affair. In Metz, quiet neighborhoods close up at night. Businesses close earlier. Parents accompany their loved ones. Social networks are swollen with theories and warning messages.
The investigation uncovers a pattern: the victims had all responded, the week before their disappearance, to an innocuous message on a local network ‚Äì an advertisement for volunteer work, a small job, a need for occasional help.
By going through these classified ads, the police spotted an anonymous account created from an internet caf√© that had been closed for a long time. IPs lead to public connections around the station. The trail gets confusing, but one thing becomes clear: the predator knows how to create trust.
An inspector says: ""The most worrying thing is patience. There is no spectacular violence on the surface - just people fading away."" Families are demanding answers. At night, many claim to hear footsteps moving away.
Finally, a more distant camera captures a detail: the silhouette still stops in front of the same building at 12:07 a.m. When the police search, they find a room filled with city maps, tram routes and photographs taken from afar. Nothing explosive ‚Äî just a cold and enigmatic collection that says method more than monstrosity.
The arrested man does not correspond to the fantasy. He is a discreet neighbor, seemingly ordinary. His trial will reveal a mechanism of control and isolation, brutal psychological manipulation. Metz will learn to distinguish fear from spectacular horror: sometimes terror comes from repetition, from the gradual disappearance of people we knew
The city is repairing its habits. Volunteer vigils are being set up. Public lights are reinforced. In cafes, people still talk about ‚Äúthe man from Moselle‚Äù. Families are left with after-effects.",1,1762014673.0,ThreadGames,0,1.0,False

My favourite to fade, Joel Hofer (5.81 GAA), is confirmed to start for St. Louis this afternoon! Hofer hasn‚Äôt had a start that‚Äôs seen less than 6 goals so far this season, friends. In addition, the Blue Jackets offense has been absolute fire having scored 15 goals in just their last 3 games. On the other side, the Blues have cashed the Over in their last 5 straight outings.

1ols5ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/MilitaryStories/comments/1ols5ih/story_from_afghanistan_june_27_2009/,"Story from Afghanistan - June 27, 2009","The village sat against the mountainside like it had been there since God made dirt. Mud-brick compounds, goats tied up between structures, terraced fields climbing up behind everything, and a beautiful look out over the valley. We'd been here twice before but today felt wrong from the start.

""Alright, listen up,"" Lieutenant Anderson said at 0600, standing in front of second and third squads. His voice had that clipped quality that made everything sound like criticism even when it wasn't. ""Hearts and minds mission today. Second squad, you're taking lead. Third squad, security. Doc, you're with second. We're hitting that village near the confluence. Provide medical aid, talk to locals, see if they've seen enemy movement. Simple.""

As if anything was ever simple.

Staff Sergeant Ramirez led second squad. He was a compact Mexican guy from El Paso, built like a fire hydrant, and had a tattoo of the Virgin Mary on his forearm that he'd gotten when he was sixteen and drunk. Everyone called him Ray-Ray, though never to his face unless you wanted to do push-ups until the sun went down. His team leaders were Sergeant Kowalski‚Äîa pale Polish kid from Detroit we called Ski and he never shut up about the Red Wings‚Äîand Sergeant Chen, a quiet Taiwanese-American from San Francisco who'd won $500 off half the platoon playing poker and reminded everyone about it weekly.

The rest of second squad was made up of: Specialist Murphy, a freckled Irish kid from Boston who could recite entire Monty Python sketches; Private First Class Davis, a massive African-American guy from Atlanta everyone called ""Tiny"" because he was 6'3"" and built like a Humvee; and Private First Class Kowalski, who was damn near Ski's twin, albeit younger and tanner, who we called ""Little Ski"" even though he was two inches taller and hated every second of it.

Our platoon's third squad was led by Staff Sergeant Vickers, a wiry North Carolina tobacco farmer‚Äôs son who chewed tobacco constantly and could spit with sniper accuracy. His team leaders were Sergeant Hayes, a former high school football coach from Oklahoma who treated patrols like Friday night games, and Sergeant Palmer, a bookish guy from Oregon who'd done two years of college before enlisting and mentioned it constantly. I always wondered why he never became an officer.
Their squad consisted of Specialist Liu, Chinese-American from Seattle and probably the best shot in the platoon; Private First Class Wright, the gangly white kid from rural Pennsylvania who talked about deer hunting like other people talked about religion; and Private First Class Martinez, a short stocky guy from New Mexico who made the best instant coffee by mixing it with hot chocolate powder and refusing to tell anyone the ratios.
We rolled out at 0630. It was a forty-minute walk through terrain designed by God specifically to destroy ankles. Ray-Ray set pace up front with Chen. I walked middle of the formation with Tiny, who carried the M240B like it was a fucking purse.

""Doc, you think about how we're just walking around waiting to get shot?"" Tiny asked.

""Every single day.""

""Good. Wanted to make sure I wasn't the only one.""

Murphy walked behind us, humming the Monty Python theme. Ski kept telling him to shut up. Murphy kept not shutting up.

""I'm not trying to be annoying,"" Murphy said.

""Then stop trying so hard,"" Ski shot back.

""That doesn't even make sense.""

""Your face doesn't make sense.""

""Gentlemen,"" Ray-Ray called without turning around. ""Save it for the Taliban.""

Behind us, third squad maintained distance. Good spacing. Textbook. Everything by the numbers, which was cold comfort when the numbers said statistically someone was getting shot eventually.

The village appeared through trees exactly like always‚Äîancient, unchanged, deeply uninterested in us. We'd been here twice doing the same hearts and minds routine. First time, locals had been wary but cooperative. Second time, less so. Today felt different immediately.
""Spread out,"" Ray-Ray ordered. ""First team left, second team right. Doc, with me. Third squad, security.""

Vickers nodded and his squad fanned out. Hayes took his team up a rise for visibility. Palmer stayed low, watching our six.
We moved into the village. Packed dirt path worn smooth by generations. Chickens scattered. An old man sat outside a compound, staring at us with the enthusiasm of someone watching paint dry on a broken wall.
Ray-Ray raised a hand in greeting. The old man's expression didn't change. Didn't blink. Just stared.

Chen moved to the first compound and knocked on the doorframe. No answer. Knocked again. Nothing.

We kept moving. The plan: offer medical aid, ask questions, don't be assholes. The problem was nobody in the Korengal wanted us to help. We'd been here too long and accomplished exactly nothing worth mentioning.

""There,"" Ray-Ray pointed to a larger compound. People outside. Women mostly, few kids. One teenage boy stood separate, arms crossed, staring at us like we'd personally murdered his dog.

We approached. I made eye contact with one of the women, gestured to my aid bag, then the kids. Universal language. She looked at the teenage boy. He said something sharp in Pashto. She looked away fast.

Ray-Ray tried hand gestures. ""Medical. Medicine."" Pointed at me. ""Doctor.""

The teenage boy spat into the dirt near Ray-Ray's boot. Not on it. Near it. Important distinction.

Ray-Ray stood there for a moment, then we moved on.

""That went great,"" Ski said.
""Shut up, Ski.""

Three more compounds. Same result. Either nobody home or nobody willing to acknowledge we existed. The usual wary cooperation‚Äîwhere they'd talk while mentally calculating how to rat us out later‚Äîhad vanished.

""Sergeant."" Chen moved closer to Ray-Ray. I could hear him lower his voice.

""Something's off."" 

""I know,"" replied Ray-Ray.

""Like, really off, bro."" 

""I know, Chen. Now shut the fuck up.""

Ray-Ray keyed his radio. ""Warrior Two-Six, this is Two-Two. Village is non-cooperative. Locals avoiding contact. Request permission to RTB. Over.""

Static. Then Lieutenant Anderson: ""Two-Two, negative. Complete the mission. You've got third squad. Stop being paranoid. Out.""

Ray-Ray's face didn't change but his eyes narrowed. 

""Roger. Out."" He looked at Chen. ""We're continuing.""

""That's a shit idea, bro.""

""I agree. But those are the orders.""

We regrouped at the village center. There was an old well under a tree that looked like it died during the Soviet invasion. The squad leaders conferred amongst themselves and the rest pulled security.

I knelt behind a low wall with Murphy and Tiny. My eyes scanned the fields above, but nothing moved except goats.

""Doc,"" Murphy said. ""You ever get that feeling like something bad's about to happen?""

""Like right now? Yeah. Like eating the crab, shell first.""

""I ‚Äòunno what that means.""

Tiny shifted his 240. 

""My grandma back in Atlanta told me about this dog in the neighborhood. Real friendly dog. But whenever it disappeared, something bad happened. Shooting, fire, whatever. The dog always knew.""

I looked at him. ""You're telling me the psychic dog story?""

""I'm saying I got the same feeling that dog had.""

""You're comparing yourself to a psychic dog, dumbass.""

""Dogs are smart, asshole. We should listen."" 

""I respect that,"" Murphy said, nodding. Ray-Ray waved us over. Vickers was there with a map spread out.

""We're supposed to hit that hamlet-"" he pointed to structures half a klick away ""-then loop back. But I'm thinking we skip it.""

""LT's not gonna like that,"" Vickers said, working tobacco in his cheek.

""LT's not here.""

""True."" Vickers spat with impressive accuracy and hit a fence post about two yards away. ""Your gut?""

""My gut says we're being set up.""

""Mine too. But LT wants more than guts.""

They stared at each other. Ray-Ray sighed.

 ""Alright. Hit the hamlet quick, then home. But we stay tight. Anything looks wrong, we bail. I don't care what LT says.""

""Roger.""

We formed up and left. Nobody came out to watch. Not even the dogs barked. It was wrong. Dogs in Afghanistan barked at everything. Rocks. Wind. Their own shadows. A bunch of dudes with big guns and camouflage uniforms.

""That's not right,"" Chen said as we walked.
""I know,"" Ray-Ray replied.

""The dogs always bark.""

""I know, Chen.""

The path to the hamlet wound through trees and rocks that hated our feet. Chen was on point with Murphy behind him, still humming. I was behind Murphy and Tiny was next with his machine gun. Ski and Little Ski were at the rear. 

""I'm just saying, you still owe me twenty bucks from that bet,"" Little Ski said behind me. 

""Bullshit I owe you. You never proved Kobe was better."" 

""He has more rings!"" 

""Rings are a team stat, dumbass."" 

""Both of you shut the fuck up about basketball,"" Ray-Ray called back. 

Ten minutes in, Murphy stopped humming. I took that as a bad sign. He always hummed. When Murphy went quiet, something was always wrong. Or he was tired. Hard to tell sometimes honestly.

""You good, Murph?"" I asked. 

""Yeah, man. Just thinking."" 

""About?"" 

""About how much I hate walking."" 

""Fair."" Tiny adjusted the 240 on his shoulder for the third time in as many minutes. The gun weighed twenty-seven pounds empty, more with a belt loaded. He carried it like it was nothing, but even he got tired. 

""Want me to carry that for a while?"" I asked, knowing the answer. 

""Fuck off, Doc. You'd fall over."" 

""I'm stronger than I look, bitch."" 

""You look like a strong wind would break you in half."" 

I pouted. ""That's hurtful, dude."" 

""It's accurate."" 

Twenty minutes later the hamlet appeared. I clocked eight structures. Smoke was rising from one compound. Someone must have been cooking which was normal. But it felt wrong, like watching a movie with no sound.

We approached from the south. Ray-Ray sent Chen's team north. Vickers positioned third squad on high ground east of us. Standard. It was by the book except the book didn't mention the feeling crawling up your spine.

A dog barked, and then another. Then a silence fell so completely that you could hear your own heartbeat.

""Sergeant,"" Chen said. ""Listen.""

Everyone stopped. I held my breath. Nothing. No chickens. No goats. No kids. No women talking. No pots. Even the cooking fire wasn't crackling.

""Chen, what do you see?""

""Doors are open. Three compounds. Wide open.""

""Middle of the day?""

""Yes, Sergeant.""

""Fuck."" Ray-Ray keyed his radio. ""Vickers, you seeing this?""

""Affirmative. Looks abandoned.""

""Copy.""

""Could be they heard us coming,"" I wondered out loud.

""Could be they knew we were coming,"" Chen said.

We moved forward cautiously. I stayed close to Ray-Ray, rifle up, brain running the list. Tourniquets. Chest seals. Morphine. Israeli bandages. Gauze. Hemostatic agent. The prayer.

First compound we came across was dead empty, with the door hanging open, and it was dark inside. Chen and Ski cleared it then came out shaking their heads.

""Nothing,"" Chen said. ""No blankets. They packed up.""

""Recently?""

""Fire pit's warm. Coals are sort of hot.""
Next structure was empty. And the next one. Every compound evacuated in the last few hours it seemed. They'd taken everything portable, left behind a rug, a water jug, or a broken chair.

""Sergeant,"" Vickers on the radio. ""We need to leave. How copy?""

""Copy. All elements, collapse on me. We're out.""

""Roger,"" Hayes replied from third squad.

We formed up at the hamlet edge, facing back the way we came. The terrain sloped into a valley before rising toward the COP, with dense trees flanking both sides. The path was the only route unless we wanted to bushwhack for hours.

""Double time,"" Ray-Ray ordered. ""Move.""

We picked up pace. My aid bag bounced against my back with every step, the straps digging into my shoulders. I'd packed it that morning trying to fit everything I might need, and now I was paying for it. Forty pounds of medical equipment that felt like eighty in the heat. Murphy glanced back. 

""You alright, Doc?"" 

""Living the dream, t-boy."" 

""You look like you're dying."" 

""That too."" My boot caught a root and I stumbled, catching myself before I went down completely. Tiny looked back and laughed. 

""Graceful lil‚Äô fucker."" 

""Fuck you, Tiny."" 

""At least you didn't face-plant. That would've been embarrassing."" 

Third squad moved somewhere behind us, maintaining distance. Good tactics, everything was textbook, which meant nothing when the enemy didn't read our book.

We were maybe two hundred meters out when the first shot cracked overhead.

Everyone dropped. I was behind a boulder, Murphy was on my left, Tiny was on my right. More shots broke through, snapping through the trees. I noticed AK fire, maybe a PKM but it was hard to tell with echoes.

""Contact right!"" Chen yelled from ahead.

The squad opened up. Our M4s began barking. Tiny's 240 roared beside me like it was God's own chainsaw. I pressed myself against a boulder. They had begun to hit us from multiple positions with overlapping fields of fire. It was almost a professional ambush. These weren't farmers we see everyday, these were fighters.
I scanned for any wounded. Everyone seemed to be moving, returning fire, taking cover. Good signs.

The firefight lasted maybe three minutes but felt like thirty. Bullets snapping overhead and more tree bark exploding. The smell of gunpowder was thick enough to taste. Then third squad opened up from the high ground, with flanking fire that made the enemy adjust.

""Suppressing fire!"" Ray-Ray yelled. ""We're moving back! Leap frog it!""

First team laid down fire while second team moved. Then switched. Standard battle drill that we'd practiced a thousand times. Now we did it for real, moving backward through trees, returning fire, and, God willing, not dying.

""Doc!"" Ray-Ray's voice. ""Check Ski!""

I ran low to where Ski was crouched behind a tree. ""Where?""

""My fucking leg!"" Ski was holding his calf, breathing hard through his teeth. I noticed his green eyes for the first time.

I pulled his hand away. It was a graze wound. Bullet had cut a line across his calf muscle, maybe an inch deep. It was bleeding but not bad. No bone seemed to be hit. No arterial damage.

""You're good,"" I told him, already wrapping it with the bandage. ""It's a scratch.""

""A scratch? Are you fucking kidding me?""

""Okay, it's a bad scratch. But you're not dying, man! Can you move?""

""Yeah.""

""Then fucking move!""

I had wrapped it quickly; it was not pretty but it would hold. Ski limped but he moved quickly alongside me. The enemy fire was lighter now. They weren't pursuing hard at all. They'd bloodied us, which was the point.

We broke out of the tree line into open ground. Third squad was already there in a defensive line. Hayes waved us through.

""Anyone hit bad?"" Vickers called.

""Negative!"" Ray-Ray replied. ""One minor wound!""
We formed a perimeter and returned fire at the tree line. The enemy fire stopped completely after a minute. They were gone.

Ray-Ray was on the radio. ""Warrior Two-Six, this is Two-Two. Contact complete. One minor casualty. Requesting air support for overhead security during movement back to base. Over.""
""Roger, Two-Two. Apache inbound, ETA three mikes. RTB when able. Out.""

Three minutes later we heard the rotors. A single Apache gunship, low and mean, banking over the valley. Made one pass over the tree line. No shots fired. Just presence. The universal language of ""don't fuck with us.""
""Let's go,"" Ray-Ray said.

The walk back took an hour. Ski limped but kept pace. I stayed near him, watching for signs of shock or worsening bleeding. He was fine. Pissed off, but fine.

We made it back to the COP and I took Ski straight to my medical hut. I sat him down, cut away the hasty bandage, and cleaned the wound properly.

""How bad?"" Ski asked.

""You'll live. Gonna have a cool scar though.""

""Chicks dig scars, right? Is that still a thing?""

""Chicks dig guys who don't get shot more.""

He laughed. ""Fuck you, Doc.""

I cleaned it, applied antibiotic ointment, wrapped it properly. ""Stay off it as much as possible for a few days. Come see me tomorrow so I can check it.""

""Roger.""

He stood, stretched, then limped out. I sat there for a minute, then started restocking my aid bag. Gauze, bandages, tourniquets. Everything back in its place. And then I felt it, rising from my core. The tears, the sobbing, the embarrassment. I clenched my hands, ground my teeth, and resisted the urge to cry.
I composed myself just as Murphy stuck his head in. 

""Yo, Doc."" 

""Yeah?"" I looked up quickly.

""Ski's telling everyone he got shot saving Little Ski."" 

""He got grazed running away."" 

""I know. But his version's better."" Murphy grinned. ""Thanks, man. For earlier. You didn't even flinch.""

""I definitely fucking flinched."" 

""Okay, but you ran toward the shooting anyway. That's pretty cool, right?"" 

""That's called being a couillon."" (Cajun word for a crazy person.)

""I don't know what that word means  and I ain‚Äôt about to ask. Deuces."" He knocked twice on the doorframe and left. 

I finished restocking and just sat there for a while, staring at the wall. The string lights cast weird shadows, mesmerizing in the way they swayed in the mountain wind. It was cool now, and beautiful as always. Outside, I could hear people moving around, talking and laughing. Life continued like it always did.

That evening I found most of both squads hanging around outside the mortar pit. Tiny, Chen, Murphy, Ray-Ray, Vickers, Hayes, Liu, Wright. Nobody had showered or shaved, but everyone was there.

""That was fucked,"" Tiny said when I walked up.
""Yeah.""

""They knew we were coming.""

""Yep.""

""Someone in that village I‚Äôll bet.""

I nodded. Someone had passed word. The empty hamlet was the warning. It was a common practice amongst those threatened with death by the Taliban.

We sat there as the sun set, painting everything orange and red. Nobody said much. What was there to say? We'd walked into an ambush, fought our way out, and this time, everyone made it back. All in a day's work for America‚Äôs finest.

Later that night I sat in my hut making notes. Ski's wound: graze, calf, clean, wrapped, antibiotics applied. The pen kept slipping and my handwriting came out crooked. After a while I gave up and just sat there.

Ray-Ray knocked and came in without waiting.
""Good work today, Doc.""

""Just doin‚Äô my job, man.""

""Ski says you told him it was a scratch.""

""It was a scratch.""

""He's calling it a Purple Heart wound.""

""He can call it whatever he wants. Don‚Äôt make it true."" We both snickered. But I knew if the bullet had hit just to the left, Ski could've been in a much more dire situation. It was a grounding thought.

Ray-Ray smiled and sat down. His rifle leaned against the table between us.

""They're gonna ask questions,"" he said. ""About why we walked into an obvious setup."" He wiped his eyes.

""Hey, we followed our fearless leaders' orders.""

""Yeah. We did."" He was quiet for a moment. 

""You think they'll listen next time? When we say something's wrong?""

I scoffed. ‚ÄúProbably not.""

""Yeah. Probably not.""

He stood. ""Get some rest. No patrols tomorrow. Both squads need a day.""

""Roger.""

He left me sitting alone. I sat there thinking about the empty village, the teenager who'd spit near Ray-Ray's boot and the old woman who'd looked at me like I was already dead. I couldn‚Äôt help thinking about how close we'd come to something much worse than Ski's leg.

After a while I went outside. Mortar guys were in their pit, smoking as per usual. I walked over and sat on the sandbags without saying anything. Nobody asked questions, as much as it killed them to sit quiet. That's what I liked about the mortar guys. They got it. 

Nickels was there with his gravelly voice and permanent squint. The other guys‚ÄîRodriguez, Patterson, and the new kid whose name I kept forgetting‚Äîwere passing around a magazine about cars or guns or something. 

""How's Ski?"" Nickels asked after a few minutes. 

""He'll live. Gonna bitch about it for a week."" 

""That's Ski."" 

""Yeah."" Rodriguez looked over.

""Heard you guys walked into some shit today.""
 
""Yeah."" 

""Close?"" 

""Close ‚Äònough."" He nodded and went back to the magazine. That was the extent of the conversation. Nobody needed details. Everyone had been in their own version of the same story. 

Nickels then offered me a cigarette. I took it. I didn't light it, just held it between my fingers, feeling the paper. 

""First one?"" he asked. 

""Maybe."" 

""Gets easier."" 

""Smoking?""
 
""All of it."" 

I wasn't sure I believed him but I didn't say so. We sat there watching stars come out one at a time. 

The new kid-Miller, that was his name-was telling Rodriguez about a girl back home. 

Patterson was half-asleep against a sandbag. It was all so normal. 

This was normal now. Sitting around waiting for mortars, talking about nothing, holding cigarettes you didn't smoke. 

Just another day in the valley.

1ols52r,https://www.reddit.com/r/koreatravel/comments/1ols52r/apec_is_over_heres_your_guide_to_the_real/,APEC is over. Here's your guide to the real Gyeongju they missed,"Alright, the people in suits have all left.

For the past few days, Gyeong-ju(Í≤ΩÏ£º) was full of black sedans and bodyguards. APEC just wrapped up.

(Tbh, we could have done better, but you know‚Ä¶ Korean politics have been a bit wild lately üòÇ)

I'm here to show you the 'real' 'Gyeong-ju' that the APEC leaders missed while they were busy in those conference rooms. At least¬†we¬†can see it all, right?

¬†

**1. The ""Why"": What is Gyeong-ju(Í≤ΩÏ£º)?**

Gyeong-ju(Í≤ΩÏ£º) was the capital of the ‚ÄòSil-la(Ïã†Îùº)‚Äô Kingdom for a thousand years. (Yep, it was the Seoul of its day)¬†

While many relics were burned throughout history, it¬†relatively¬†escaped the destruction of the Korean War, turning the entire city into a literal¬†""museum without walls.""¬†

People here literally drink coffee next to ancient tombs and ride bikes between burial mounds. If Seoul is the 'present,' Gyeong-ju(Í≤ΩÏ£º) is Korea's 'soul.'

¬†

**2. The ""What-To-Do"": So, what should you do?**

Gyeong-ju(Í≤ΩÏ£º)'s real magic isn't about 'choosing‚Äô. It's about 'coexistence.'¬†

Let me show you how fantastically history and the present are mixed here.

¬†

**Theme A: The Heart of Silla**

Dae-reung-won(ÎåÄÎ¶âÏõê/Ï≤úÎßàÏ¥ù)(Tomb Complex)¬†- A massive tomb park right in the middle of the city. You all know that iconic silhouette shot from here, right?

Dong-gung(ÎèôÍ∂Å) Palace & Wol-ji(ÏõîÏßÄ) Pond (=ÏïàÏïïÏßÄ,An-ap-ji)¬†- Tbh, this is reason enough to visit. Gyeong-ju(Í≤ΩÏ£º)'s nightlife is completed by the night view here.

Cheom-seong-dae(Ï≤®ÏÑ±ÎåÄ) Observatory¬†- Great during the day, but you can't miss it when it's lit up at night.

Bul-guk-sa(Î∂àÍµ≠ÏÇ¨) Temple & Seok-guram(ÏÑùÍµ¥Ïïî) Grotto¬†- UNESCO World Heritage. 'Nuff said. Just know, they're a bit outside of town, so you need to set aside a half-day for them.

¬†

**Theme B: The ""Present-Day""**¬†

Have you ever seen a Starbucks with a¬†traditional tile (Í∏∞ÏôÄ,gi-wa) roof?

Downtown Gyeong-ju(Í≤ΩÏ£º), especially the historical district (near the tombs), has city planning rules that limit building height and design.¬†

(Not every building is a han-ok, but they have to match the vibe)

So it's not just Starbucks, Olive Young, Baskin-Robbins, and even BHC chicken joints have hanok-style signs. The mix is really fun.

And then there's¬†Hwang-ri-dan-gil(Ìô©Î¶¨Îã®-Í∏∏). (The name is a mashup, but it doesn't matter anymore)¬†

It's become the 'hippest' spot in Gyeong-ju(Í≤ΩÏ£º) for the last 10 years.

It's full of trendy cafes, restaurants, and souvenir shops in renovated hanoks, all mixed in with tomb views. It's like a mini Jeon-ju Hanok Village(Ï†ÑÏ£º ÌïúÏò• ÎßàÏùÑ) or Seoul's Ik-seon-dong(ÏùµÏÑ†-Îèô).

¬†

**3. The ""Tips"": A Local's Guide**

**A. How to get there? (Bus vs. KTX)**

Most people come from Busan, and honestly, there's no single right answer. It's just a question of convenience.

The¬†KTX¬†is fast, but the station (Sin-Gyeong-ju, Ïã†-Í≤ΩÏ£º) is far outside the city center. (You need another 20 min by bus/taxi)

The¬†Bus Terminal¬†is right next to Hwang-ri-dan-gil(Ìô©Î¶¨Îã®-Í∏∏)(downtown). But the Busan Bus Terminal (No-po, ÎÖ∏Ìè¨) is itself on the outskirts of Busan.

Conclusion. The total travel time is pretty similar. The KTX is more expensive (though not by a huge amount).

If it were me, I'd take the bus.¬†It's a bit cheaper, and the view from the bus is a little more interesting üòå

(If you have the cash, a taxi is fine, but it'll be around ‚Ç©100,000. Make sure to book it via an app!)

¬†

**B. How to get around Gyeong-ju(Í≤ΩÏ£º)?**

This is the most important part. Everyone thinks Gyeong-ju(Í≤ΩÏ£º) is small, but by¬†area, it's more than 3x the size of Seoul! (Of course, the tourist spots are clustered)

Downtown (Dae-reung-won(ÎåÄÎ¶âÏõê/Ï≤úÎßàÏ¥ù)/Hwang-ri-dan-gil(Ìô©Î¶¨Îã®-Í∏∏)/Cheom-seong-dae(Ï≤®ÏÑ±ÎåÄ)):¬†Walking or renting a bike/electric scooter is the best.

Outskirts (Bul-guk-sa(Î∂àÍµ≠ÏÇ¨)/Seok-guram(ÏÑùÍµ¥Ïïî)):¬†You¬†must¬†take a bus or taxi. Give yourself plenty of travel time.

¬†

**C. Schedule**

Everyone does a day trip from Busan... If you do that, you'll be just like the APEC leaders, seeing nothing but the ""conference room."" ü•≤

You need¬†1 night / 2 days¬†minimum. 2 nights is even better.

Bonus.¬†Gyeong-ju(Í≤ΩÏ£º) has some high-quality hotels/guesthouses for¬†really cheap!¬†Think of it as a city to relax in.

And¬†please, in Gyeong-ju(Í≤ΩÏ£º), skip the ""blog famous"" restaurants and just walk into an old, humble-looking¬†baek-ban(Î∞±Î∞ò, set meal) joint.

You might fail, but the experience of finding a hidden gem restaurant will be something you think about long after you're home.¬†

Trust me, there are so many unique and delicious spots!

¬†

**4. The Source of All This Info**

...Tbh, it's my hometown. hahahahaha. When I was in elementary school, my¬†field trips¬†were to An-ap-ji(ÏïàÏïïÏßÄ) Pond, (Bul-guk-sa(Î∂àÍµ≠ÏÇ¨), and Cheom-seong-dae(Ï≤®ÏÑ±ÎåÄ)... (Yes, I was bored of them)¬†

But now I know just how precious those experiences were. (Of course, I live in Seoul now. lol)

¬†

As always, if you have any questions, drop a comment. I'll answer everything I know.

¬†

And to all the other Gyeong-ju(Í≤ΩÏ£º) experts on Reddit!¬†

If you have tips or if I got anything wrong, let me know in the comments. I'll fix it right away!

*P.S. Just so you know, all the local knowledge here is 100% from my brain! To make sure my Korean thoughts translate into smooth, easy-to-read English, I got a little help from a translator. Enjoy!*",23,1762014470.0,koreatravel,5,0.96,False

If you want a guy who lifts, reads, cooks, and keeps plans - hi.

Basics
21 ‚Ä¢ 198 cm ‚Ä¢ athletic ‚Ä¢ dark hair, brown eyes
Law student: dual-study program in public admin.
Don‚Äôt smoke, drink rarely. Languages: German/English. Live in NRW near the NL border: BE/NL welcome.

What I‚Äôm into
Books, working out, cooking, co-op games (love co-op horror if that's your vibe), shows (anything from Gravity Falls to Chernobyl), martial arts newbie (getting less foldable). I also love fragrances and taking care of myself.

Vibe
Calm in public, affectionate and playful in private: I show love through food, touch, words and thoughtful gifts. 
Most nights I'm social or training, but I protect time for my person.
I keep my word.

Looking for
Monogamy, adult communication, equal effort and consistency: When we like each other, we act like it. Spontaneity is welcome (booked my Seoul trip three days before flying).

Travel + everyday
I'll travel Lapland + Japan/Taipei next year - ideally together long-term. Day-to-day I‚Äôm a homebody: picture steady and cozy weekdays and new experiences during weekends and holidays. 

Filters (read before DM)
NRW (or close)/Belgium/Netherlands only and around my age (anywhere from 18 to 25), so if we click, meeting stays easy.
If this fits, message with age + city and tell me what kind of date we'll be doing once I'm back: coffee, museum or one of your suggestions.

1ols0mm,https://www.amazon.com/Naming-New-Jersey-Historical-Geographical/dp/B0FN3RBC74,I wrote a book about the name origins of New Jersey‚Äôs towns/communities/landmarks,"I wrote and self-published a book called, ‚ÄúNaming New Jersey: The Etymology of Its Historical and Geographical Landmarks‚Äù which is now for sale on Amazon, Barnes & Noble Online, and Bookshop.org.

It explores the origins of nearly 850 towns, neighborhoods, and landmarks across New Jersey. If you‚Äôve ever wondered where places like South Amboy, Wyckoff, Garret Mountain, or the Tuckahoe River got their names, this is the reference guide or coffee table book for you.

100% of the proceeds are being donated to Bridge of Books Foundation, a New Jersey-based nonprofit that donates books to children in underserved communities throughout New Jersey. I hope you consider buying my book.

Simply...

It will give you three tasks every single day...

For ex: Feeding a stray cat, buying coffee to your colleague or watering a plant outside or whatever small act of kindness.

And completing thase tasks every single day will create a streak for you in the app. 

Also it gives you 20 ripples on every task completion. And from collection of these ripples, you can unlock some app themes with some background animations.

Also when you complete a task, you can upload a picture or a video of what you have done to keep it in your memory list with a caption.

Plus you can post that picture or video within the app in the community with like minded people and can see others posts about what ripple effect they have created.
