**☕️ The Morning Cup of Coffee no. 596 ☕️**



With sunrise sneaking in at 5:29 AM, how is anyone supposed to sleep? I shuffle out of bed, let the dog out, and move through my slow morning rhythm. My bones creak their usual protest as I fill the coffeemaker with fresh grounds and water. It sputters and sighs to life, filling the air with that rich, earthy scent that feels like comfort itself.

That first mug gets me started, steadying the mind before the day begins: emails, paperwork, and endless to-dos. A refill or two keeps me company through the afternoon while I dive into the creative work that truly wakes me up. By the afternoon, maybe a final pour to toast another day well spent.

So tell me, what’s in your mug today? Do you take it black, sweet, creamy, or with a little weekend “kick”? What small ritual starts your day on the right note?

1ohp0n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cats/comments/1ohp0n8/behavioural_help_needed_my_cat_is_peeing_on_my/,Behavioural Help Needed: My Cat is Peeing on My Dog's Bed,"I'm looking for behavioural advice:  
  
My cat is peeing on only a dog bed in my home office. She doesn't pee on any other dog beds in the house. In fact, she likes to sleep on all of the other ones. This is stressing out my dog because she's used to spending her days with me in my office, and now she can't lay in there with me (she has bad arthritis, so she won't lay on the floor).

**How can I get the cat to stop peeing on the dog's office bed?** 

Facts:

* I adopted the rescue cat nearly 5 months ago. She started off restricted to the home office until she was comfortable and ready to expand to other rooms.
* I've had my rescue dog already for 8 years. 
* The cat sleeps on all of my dog's other beds in the house. 
* The cat and dog get along well. (They like to nose kiss greet every time they see each other, the cat smells the dog's paws when she gets back from a walk, they play together to a limited extent, they will lay next to each other when sharing the couch but not cuddle together)
* The cat has two other litter boxes (one is 1m from the office). They are both scooped 2x a day and completely cleaned 1x a week.
* The cat doesn't have accidents anywhere else in the house.
* The cat waits until I leave the room to pee on the dog bed.
* The cat already has a nice bed in a basket on my desk in the window that she loves and sleeps in (when she's not sleeping on my lap) if I am in the office. 

  
What I've tried:

* Vet visit in case of medical problem
* Putting the cat's food on the office dog bed (she just peed next to the bowl). 
* Only putting the dog's bed out if I am in the room (if I leave the room even for a minute to get a coffee, my dog will follow me, and the cat will take that moment to pee on the bed).
* Cleaning the bed with enzyme cleaner
* Swapping the bed for a blanket (she pees on this too). 

Please help my dog get to sleep in my home office again. Thank you!

This post is for people who have reached a point in feeling more overwhelmed than happy in being a barista.

Overall, I’ve had a positive experience at the shop I work at. I’m always bubbly at work; you’d never think I’d be unhappy as a barista, but deep down I feel so incredibly exhausted. Speaking to quite literally around 100+ people every day while maintaining a customer service personality and being in rushes for hours a day, multiple times a day, with a measly 15-30m break as if that could ever be enough time to rest, both socially, mentally and physically.

Attempting to meet the demand of a society where people would rather purchase a simple coffee or tea at the crack of dawn or late in the evening versus making it in the comfort of their own homes or in community feels maddening. It’s no one’s fault of course; I like to go out for coffee as well. It just feels like a balance is missing and baristas are to bear it. I’m looking for new work in not enjoying coffee life any longer. Being a barista helped me grow in great ways, but also opened my eyes to consumerism.

I'm just an Indian guy who met a beautiful Taiwanese girl from yunlin county her name was Mian-cha and I fell for her so bad that couldn't forget her even after 2 years of no conversation 
So it starts like we met on Omegle and everything was casual and we talked and talked for days and we became so comfortable with each other 
She used to tell me about her her family and how her day was and I used to do the same 
Apparently we used to talk all night altho different timezones but she used to stay awake just so we can talk on video calls 
She even told her friends about me altho I never knew if it was all a joke or she really meant that 
She always used to text me and we used to be on call when she used to go to go to her classes she even told me that she wanted to join the taiwan ocean university 
After a few months I never saw her on my Instagram chat she probably got into her dream university and forgot me 
Well u got into my college too but I still can't stop thinking about her for some reason
Life is really strange ..... I really hope i find her in some other point of my life where we could sit together probably ask her for a coffee date which I always wanted to ask her talk about how life treated us

With sunrise sneaking in at 5:29 AM, how is anyone supposed to sleep? I shuffle out of bed, let the dog out, and move through my slow morning rhythm. My bones creak their usual protest as I fill the coffeemaker with fresh grounds and water. It sputters and sighs to life, filling the air with that rich, earthy scent that feels like comfort itself.

That first mug gets me started, steadying the mind before the day begins: emails, paperwork, and endless to-dos. A refill or two keeps me company through the afternoon while I dive into the creative work that truly wakes me up. By the afternoon, maybe a final pour to toast another day well spent.

So tell me, what’s in your mug today? Do you take it black, sweet, creamy, or with a little weekend “kick”? What small ritual starts your day on the right note?

1ohoy4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1ohoy4v/i_feel_hopeless_ganging_up_at_the_office/,I feel hopeless - Ganging up at the office,"29(F) took three weeks of PTO, and while I was gone, I got promoted — which was exciting, but also meant I really needed to show up and take things seriously when I got back. Instead, I came back to a weirdly hostile office.

For context, there are only four of us in the office: me, a coworker, our supervisor, and the secretary. The secretary has always been difficult — she constantly forgets to do things, drops the ball on scheduling, calls out sick, and generally avoids taking responsibility. She’s been in trouble before, but she smiles through everything and somehow never faces real consequences. Me and our supervisor know this but she's bffs with my one coworker.

When i got back from my time off, I’d asked her to put in a rush order and schedule a meeting — both basic things — and she messed up both. I had asked her in advance if it was okay for her to do this or if I was overstepping by asking because she usually acts like its such a chore (i was basically begging), so I decided to schedule the follow-up meeting myself. I was curt with her — not rude, just professional and to the point — because honestly, I’m so tired of her constant smiling and acting like nothing’s ever her fault. It’s frustrating because when she drops the ball, *I’m* the one who ends up looking bad or scrambling to fix it.

Before my trip, I’d been trying hard to fit in and avoid drama. My office of four has this culture of “ganging up” on people — once they decide someone’s the problem, it becomes a group sport — and I didn’t want that to happen to me. So I’d spend hours chatting and gossiping with them (usually initiated by the secretary) just to keep the peace. It easily ate up 2–3 hours of my day.

When I came back, I had so much to catch up on that I decided to just focus. I wore my headphones, kept my head down, said hello, smiled — but I didn’t linger to chat. From the outside, I probably looked tired or quiet, but that’s all.

Now the atmosphere has shifted completely. The secretary and my coworker whisper and laugh together, make passive-aggressive comments like, “Wow, I wish I was as laser-focused as you,” or “She’s too busy for us now,” and take long coffee breaks without me. They message each other during meetings and glance my way, smirking — it’s the exact pattern they used when they froze out another coworker before. The secretary bumps into my desk and even does small tasks like opening boxes on my desk lol and I'm so close to my breaking point.

I even asked one of them if I’d done something wrong, and she said no but kept smiling... you know? I got so hurt that I ended up crying in front of her, which I’m mortified about- I'm so anxious about losing this job and never being happy in the office that when it felt so good to be here but then completely changed I was heartbroken, not to be dramatic.

Now I dread going to work. It’s such a small office that there’s no escaping it. I’m just trying to do my job, stay focused, and live up to my new role, but it feels like I’m being punished for not talking or for having any emotion at all, I feel like I'm not obligated to laugh with anyone but I just thought people would normally be okay with a shift in attitude like that right? Like why would anyone be mad for you being quiet? We went from happy friends to this overnight.

I feel isolated and anxious all the time. I don’t want to get dragged into drama, but I also can’t handle this anymore. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? Is it just me??? I'm so so depressed....

My boss likes me though.",1,1761595505.0,workplace_bullying,1,1.0,False

Just wondering if anyone here uses a Qantas Pay (Qantas Money) account for everyday spending. I’m thinking about transferring my weekly spending money every Monday into it and using the card for groceries, petrol, coffee and other regular stuff.

Is it actually worth it for earning Qantas Points or are the earn rates too low to bother?
Also curious if there are any hidden fees or catches when using it in Australia compared to overseas.

Would love to hear from anyone who’s been doing this for a while. Is it a solid way to build points or just marketing fluff?

* **Oak-panelled Tudor rooms**
* **Jacobean wall paintings**
* **Victorian and Georgian additions**
* **Breaker’s Yard**, a playful outdoor space with upcycled art and community gardens

It’s a place where history meets activism, and where every room tells a different story.

# What to See (and Snap!)

* **The Linenfold Parlour**: Intricate woodwork and moody lighting
* **The Painted Staircase**: A dramatic ascent through centuries
* **Breaker’s Yard**: Quirky installations and colorful murals
* **The Courtyard Garden**: A peaceful spot for portraits and reflection

# When to Visit

Sutton House is open **Fridays and Sundays from 11am to 4pm**. You can explore at your own pace or join a **guided tour**:

* **Fridays**: Tours at 11am, 1pm, and 2:30pm
* **Sundays**: Tours at 12pm, 1:30pm, and 3pm

**Booking is recommended for tours**, though a few walk-up tickets are available.

With sunrise sneaking in at 5:29 AM, how is anyone supposed to sleep? I shuffle out of bed, let the dog out, and move through my slow morning rhythm. My bones creak their usual protest as I fill the coffeemaker with fresh grounds and water. It sputters and sighs to life, filling the air with that rich, earthy scent that feels like comfort itself.

That first mug gets me started, steadying the mind before the day begins: emails, paperwork, and endless to-dos. A refill or two keeps me company through the afternoon while I dive into the creative work that truly wakes me up. By the afternoon, maybe a final pour to toast another day well spent.

So tell me, what’s in your mug today? Do you take it black, sweet, creamy, or with a little weekend “kick”? What small ritual starts your day on the right note?

1oholgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1oholgv/for_anyone_in_the_thick_of_it_right_now/,For anyone in the thick of it right now,"Just wanted to post something for anyone having one of *those* days. The kind where that little voice in your head starts trying to make deals with you. We've all been there.

Here's something I've learned about that voice: **It's not you**. It's just the ghost of an old habit. It’s got no real power. Every time you feel that pull and just take a deep breath instead, you're literally starving that ghost and building up the real you.

Think of it this way: cravings aren't you being weak. They're like ""healing notifications"" from your body. That uncomfortable feeling is proof that your body is fixing itself and kicking the junk out. It's a good sign!

Seriously, just for a second, **picture yourself a few months down the road**. Imagine waking up and not even thinking about it. Imagine the feeling of taking a full, clean breath. Tasting your morning coffee and it tasting a hundred times better. That’s not some fantasy. That’s where you’re headed. Every hour you win is another step on that path.

So when that next craving wave hits, don’t wrestle with it. Just look at it and go, ""Oh, hey, it's that old junk program running again."" Take one slow, deep breath, and as you breathe out, **just let it go**. Just watch it drift away.

Remember: you're not losing a crutch. You're gaining your freedom.

Keep going. You're doing it.

1oholfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/comments/1oholfk/happy_danya_stories/,Happy Danya Stories,"I want to share these happy memories with anyone in the community who missed them (or just wants to reminisce). Danya has discussed each of them multiple times over the years. Sources in the linked podcasts. 

1. Daniel took a gap year after high school to focus on chess, and that year he played in the US championship. He had a tough tournament, but afterwards he flew straight from St. Louis (with the same people he had just played against) to play with the US team in the World Team Championships. It was during the match against the Russian team in that tournament that he played one of the greatest games of his career against Jakovenko (peak number 5 world rating). His career-first victory over a super GM saved the match for the US team, and appears to be one of the chess-playing achievements that Naroditsky was most proud of. This game was also covered in the [recent episode of the C-Squared Podcast](https://youtu.be/UwVnSKtiHa4?si=Fk6tXqP41vkIEJhn).
Regarding being afraid of losing points in the US championship and tournaments in general, he said: ""You can't derive happiness from results alone. It's the games that I remember, those moments when you sacrifice the queen against Wesley. That's what I'm gonna be telling my grandkids about, not the fucking 10 points I gained in some tournament""

2. In college, Danya wasn't sure what he wanted to do with his career. At Stanford, most history majors went to law school or into consulting. Danya didn't get a consulting internship, possibly because his entire resume was just chess-related. Meanwhile, his best friend Peter was consistently trying to recruit him to move to Charlotte and work with him at the Charlotte chess center. That request was repeatedly denied, and Daniel even enrolled in a master's program in the history department at Stanford, seemingly leaning towards pursuing alternative career paths instead of chess. 
However, this all changed after an hours-long conversation with a non-chess friend, who pointed out to Danya that it really seemed like he wanted to go to Charlotte. That inspired him to take the risk and move to NC, with the intention of teaching chess mostly and streaming on the side. There, he seemed to really flourish and enjoy the flexibility of teaching and streaming chess. It seems like during that time period, he had found his purpose in life and was truly living his dream. Relatably, he [talked with GothamChess](https://youtu.be/2LkzFyUJwb8?si=Y8XRbUUc1AH_8quQ) about staying up later and later into the night and early morning, but still (usually) managing to get up for lessons or commentary commitments the next day. He even drank a black coffee at 8 PM during that interview.

3. Speaking of flourishing, Danya's priorities shifted more (but not all the way) from teaching towards streaming as his social media presence grew in popularity. As I suspect most people are already aware, one watershed moment was coaching MoistCr1TiKaL (Charlie) in the PogChamps tournament, where he predicted Charlie's mate in 6 against xQc and earned his ""prophet"" nickname. Speaking again to [C-Squared](https://youtu.be/rXzJKYKHXjw?si=LuKD3TuLypn5FOWM), he emphasized that he wasn't merely teaching Charlie traps, but that it was actually main line preparations that just happened to pay off perfectly. He also has described this moment as one he would tell his grandkids about.

Of course, there are so many more amazing Naroditsky stories to share. I also really enjoyed watching back [commentary highlights](https://youtu.be/0CgThFMomKA?si=_djnkEmiFmuIrDq6) and [team chess with Robert Hess](https://www.youtube.com/live/49OkOZwwGVo?si=vwHV6mqsC72p4rHW) (as recommended by Fabi on C-Squared).

I hope you can tell their size by the spoon and cup and plate. 

Lunch: genuinely the best sandwich in the universe. Once again I didn’t know about this subreddit then so you cannot properly see the size compared to my hands. The sandwich has sourdough bread. Pesto spread on the top and pumpkinseed pesto spread on the bottom. (The caffe had the sandwhich labeled as vegan, so I assumed no cheese in the pesto?) Arugula, romaine, yellow bell peppers, beetroot (assumed pickled) carrot (assumed pickled) alfalfa sprouts and that’s it! I assumed about 800cals but I’m not the best when it comes to sandwich assumptions.

Dinner: pesto pasta. Can you tell I love pesto. Sorry once again for no hand for comparison. I know pesto is high cals but hey, I’m addicted and it was my bday. It was made with olive oil, basil, pine nuts and extra sharp Parmesan. 

Thank you if you try assume things. My bday was months ago but still wondering, especially about cookies and sandwich since they were too good I’ll probably have to have them again. Sorry for no hand comparison once again. Have a great day!",2,1761594636.0,caloriecount,1,1.0,False

1ohofpj,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1ohofpj/has_anyone_gone_full_nerd/,Has anyone gone full nerd?,"Coffee extraction reminds me of the exposition in photography. 3 variables: F-stop, ISO and shutter time versus grind size, brewing temperature and total contact time.

You can end up with identical exposures with many different sets of values: e.g. 1/1000 shutter time, ISO 400, F2.8 is equal to 1/250 shutter time (2 full steps brighter), ISO 200 (1 full stop darker) and F4 (1 full stop darker). However, not all sets of values that amount to optimal exposure give you an optimal photo… a slow shutter time e.g. can introduce motion blur and high ISO leads to grain.

So, how would this work with extraction? How many seconds of longer/shorter contact time would equate to one full stop? How many microns of finer/coarser grind size is one full stop? How many degrees Celsius of hotter/colder brewing temperature is one full stop? Stop increments need to be such that [X] stops towards a higher extraction with 1 or 2 of the variables can be perfectly counterbalanced by [same X] stops towards a lower extraction with the remaining 2 or 1 variable(s). 

Has anyone gone full nerd and found out the extraction stops? If so, what is the useful upper and lower limit of each variable taste wise? In what ways does the taste of the resulting cup differ between the different combinations of optimal extraction? And if no-one has gone full nerd yet, would anyone volunteer as tribute?

Beans: Same medium-light roast

1ohoc15,https://i.redd.it/opyqqpftjpxf1.jpeg,26,"🎂 Year 26 🎂 today is my birthday.

I didn’t think I’d make it to 26.
Almost a year ago, everything in my world shattered. I finally told my mom about the sexual harassment I had been living with from my stepdad because I couldn’t take it anymore. I thought she would protect me… instead, she kicked me and my daughter out.

We were suddenly homeless — no clothes, no beds, no stability. She didn’t believe me, and from that moment on, she did everything she could to destroy me. I lost my career, had to drop out of nursing school, and she even tried to get my daughter taken from me by calling CPS over and over. She took me to eviction court after kicking me out, and then to court again for grandparent visitation — and she won. I feel like I can never truly escape her.

I’ve never felt pain like this — to have your own mother turn on you, to be betrayed by the one person who was supposed to keep you safe. There were nights I didn’t want to wake up. I honestly didn’t think I would survive this year.

But somehow, here I am. Still standing, still trying.
I work hard every day, but no matter how much I do, it feels like it’s never enough. All I wanted today was a small birthday — a coffee, a little takeout, and a cake with my daughter, because she was so excited to celebrate me. But even after working a shift on my birthday, we’re still in the negative. I feel like a failure most days, like I can’t give her the life she deserves.

This has been the hardest year of my entire life.
But I’m still here. And even though I’m tired, and broke, and still healing from things no one should ever have to go through — I’m here. And I guess that means I made it. 💔💜

I’m not posting this for pity — I just wanted to be real and share how far I’ve come from where I was. If anyone out there is going through something they think they can’t survive, please hold on. You’re not alone. We’re stronger than what tried to break us. 💜

If anyone wants to help me out or just make my day, these are my links. I just need some light in the darkness. I don’t remember the last time I got something nice for myself or my daughter no matter how much I’m trying😭❤️🙏

These were **MY** instructions today - I am a Kaiser Permanente patient in Northern Colorado.

I’m scheduled for extensive foot surgery on November 10. I'm 60 and in good health except for my weight. 

Yesterday, I spent some time reviewing past posts to figure out when I should stop taking my Zepbound and found lots of varying and conflicting information.

Today I had my pre-surgery consultation with the anesthesiology nurse and she told me that they are no longer recommending that patients stop their GLP-1 medications before surgery - that I am to continue as per usual.  These were the instructions (copied and pasted):

*You are taking a GLP-1 agonist (ie, Ozempic®, Wegovy®, Mounjaro®) for diabetes or weight loss. One of the ways it works is by delaying gastric emptying (food empties slower from the stomach). We do not want anything in your stomach on the day of surgery so a clear liquid diet must be started to help reduce the risk of complications such as aspiration.*

*Please follow these guidelines:*

*1. A clear liquid diet listed below MUST be started if you have used any form of a GLP-1 for weight loss or diabetes within 6 weeks of surgery.*

*2. Stop eating solid foods on 11/8/25 at 7:00 p.m. (two days before your procedure date) and start drinking ONLY clear liquids from the list below.*

*3. 10 hours before your scheduled CHECK-IN TIME for surgery, limit the liquids to only water, apple juice (no pulp), and Gatorade®. (ONLY WATER if diabetic).*

*4. 2 hours before your scheduled CHECK-IN TIME for surgery, stop ALL liquids.*

*Your surgery could be cancelled if you do not follow food and drink guidelines.*

I've been pulling shots side by side between the Spiritello & the Slayer experiencing the differences. The lever is much more forgiving, seemingly finding a way to make every shot taste great regardless of the grind & prep. The Slayer is a bit more picky. Over the next while I'll compare the Titus to the Weber grinders and figure out what I'm going to do. My goal is to sell both Webers & just keep the Titus. It should easily meet my needs but for now it will be fun to see how the grinders compare. I plan to keep both the Slayer & the Spiritello & end my journey here, just enjoying great espresso.

Its just exhausting lol I want to eat so many things but my diet becomes like. Eggs. Eggs. More boiled eggs. Beans. Beans. Eggs.

Before I realized I had an outbreak yesterday I got coffee and donuts, I haven't had donuts in so long and was excited to try it then realized I couldn't without making the pain flare so its all just put away for whenever the flare dies down.

If I had more ingredients, and didnt have other disabilities impairing me from cooking more, I could have a more diverse lysine diet but unfortunately I am stuck with very simple foods. It gets the job done but oh my god the boredom! Immediately after eating the eggs the sore calmed down but its so, so boring.

Anyone else really struggle w keeping their diet lysine rich? I was thinking that I guess its a positive thing to have something that forcibly limits my sugar intake.

The part when she sing, you can hear it in the silence and there’s like that silent moment before the next lyric, is just it makes me wanna cry sometimes because love does come in those small packages of like every day that you spend with your person. The beauty and how even having coffee in the morning and the ritual of being with your partner and just the love that comes from that. I just really love that song.

We developed a personal relationship over a few years. We texted semi regularly. We hung out on campus every other week for coffee or to share a meal. I ALWAYS viewed her as my little sister or perhaps a daughter figure. That means that I shared with her personal stuff as she shared with me like mental health struggles. We hugged goodbye on occasions. Still most of our exchanges (95%) in texts and in person were academic in nature which was the basis of our relationship to begin with (it started as mentor-mentee and shifted to what I thought of as family/friend). The other 5% is banter, jokes, sharing music or movies. We both texted one another about once a week or so. It never got romantic or sexual, ever. 

But...one day she got weird and asked for space. I obliged. After a few months of no contact she came to see me at school and basically told me that she thought she had fallen in love with me. She felt so much guilt and shame. Of course I did not reciprocate feelings (because I don't share them!!!). I was of course very sad about this outcome because she was family to me. I told her that as far as I was concerned I was not bothered by it and that perhaps we could continue being in each others lives with stricter boundaries. She said she would think about it, but said it was just so hard for her emotionally to be around me. She gave me a goodbye hug (which mind you I did not expect nor did I consent to!). And that was that.

I just got hit with a complaint from the title IX office alleged sexual misconduct. What's strange is that we never had anything like sexual conduct besides the occasional hugs goodbye. The list of complaints are as follows:

1. That I contacted her via text, email, in person and talked to her about personal matters.
2. That I had physical contact with her at times (this must be the hugs).
3. That I talked to her friend about us (a friend of hers and I talked about what was going on with her--I think her friend suspected that the complainant had developed feelings).
4. That I invited the complainant to spend time with me both on campus and outside and occasionally bought her meals.

I'm just utterly confused about how 1-4 could count as sexual harassment or misconduct or whatever. I'm just stupefied. Is my title IX officer nuts or is there something here?",2,1761593789.0,SupportForTheAccused,0,1.0,False

Married for 3. We just had our first baby. My husband is the love of my life. With that being said, we have had the same argument for years now and I’m not sure what else I can do. 

For years, I have confronted him on how selfish he can be with his time & plans. I have always been lenient, I trust him completely- so it’s not that. But it kinda feel likes every time he gets an inch he takes 10 miles. I let him go golf for 6 hrs, he then asks if he one of his friends can come over to game the rest of the day. He goes to bars with all his cousins, instead of coming home after I finish work- he spends most of the day out and then thinks that I’ll be content with a one hour dinner once he’s back. I don’t want to be left as the last option. Him thinking that a dinner is sufficient is so frustrating. 

Also, the new problem we have is the way I answer things. But then again, I feel like it’s obvious? Example: I tell him I want a coffee, he tells me he’ll get me one- but then it’s 2 in the afternoon, I’m already overwhelmed with work and he goes down to take a nap while the baby is with my mom (I am working, he is currently staying home with the baby which I also know is a full time job) -Right before falling asleep he says “do you want me to go get you a coffee now?”. Mind you, he’s laying in bed, eyes shut, ready to fall asleep. And I tell him that no it’s fine, but no..it’s not fine.

I’m a piano and tech enthusiast, and I just finished developing **PianoMotion**, an Android app (totally free and free of ads!) that lets you play **any piano MIDI file wirelessly via Bluetooth** on your acoustic player piano (Yamaha Disklavier, Steinway Spirio, Bösendorfer CEUS, PianoDisc, QRS, …) no more need of DKC-900 or DKC-850...

📥 **Download the APK here:** [PianoMotion on GitHub](https://github.com/KevinChopin/PianoMotion)

How it works:

1. Plug a **Bluetooth MIDI adapter** (Yamaha MD-BT01, CME WIDI Master, or any compatible model) into your piano’s MIDI ports.
2. Connect your phone via Bluetooth.
3. Load any piano MIDI file.
4. Press **play** – watch your piano perform!

**Why I made it:**

There are very few accessible apps that truly unlock the magic of these instruments. I wanted to create something **simple, free, and ad-free**, so anyone could enjoy their piano, no matter its age.

I built **PianoMotion** because it was frustrating to see manufacturers either **offer only poor-quality apps** for their pianos or **abandon older instruments entirely**, pushing you to buy a new one without proper software support. With PianoMotion, you can **play your favorite MIDI tracks, record your own performances, revive old Disklavier floppy disks**, (and soon even **sing along while your piano plays the backing**!). NB: App is currently in French but English version is coming soon.

Features:

* 🎵 Play MIDI files wirelessly via Bluetooth
* 🎹 Record and replay your own performances
* 🔜 Soon: “Voice + MIDI” mode – sing while your piano plays
* 💖 Completely free and ad-free

**Try it & Give Feedback**

I’d love for everyone to try PianoMotion. Your bug reports, suggestions, and feature ideas are what will help make this app better and more enjoyable for the piano community.

despite the cleanliness and finesse of washed coffees, i still crave the body and boldness of a naturally processed coffee, just not always the flavors associated with it. essentially, my palate wants the flavor and nuance that comes from a washed coffee, but the feel/texture of a natural, as well as the intensity of flavor (no flavors in particular, just the intensity). i am struggling to find a balance between these in my cup, and i was wondering if any of you had some advice for my brewing.
i currently use a v60, zp6 grinder, brew with a 1:18 ratio, with a water temperature of about 95-96C. my zp6 setting usually stays between 5.5-6, often lying on 5.8 for most coffees. i do a double bloom, a very gentle wet wdt after the second bloom, and a single final pour after these. for a while, this was making perfect cups for me, but i gradually have noticed some astringency in my cups, as well as a lack of the flavor intensity i am looking for. i seem to be getting more tannins in the cup rather than the flavors you would want from a pourover coffee. i have tried grinding coarser, using lower temps, and switching up my flow rate and heights, but i am struggling to find a balance that fully works for me.
what would you suggest i focus on? is there anything you would change about my recipe, or are there any factors i should be focusing more on than others? my cups taste pretty great for the most part, but i am very particular, and i want to really dial in my recipe and technique to make my coffee as great as possible without wasting coffee on less-than-ideal cups. i want to make the most of my coffee, especially since i only buy so much at a time. thank you for any and all advice, and sorry if this was all long-winded.

tldr; i want more flavor intensity out of my washed coffees while maintaining clarity, but without pulling bitterness. i am struggling to find a balance. think a black tea consistency instead of a white or green tea.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

Somewhere in there, a fifth headmate made themselves known, and since then things have been incredibly quiet.

Coffee, the most active of us aside from myself, has been almost entirely silent for over a week, Ruby, who fronts for the longest aside from myself, had only fronted once and only for a handful of minutes, and Fae has been entirely absent. I’ve been told that it’s normal for things to go quiet for a bit, but them being all collectively gone for so long has me worried. Should I be? Is something going on?

For a bit more context, our fifth was, as far as we can tell, very chill. They spoke about things being fuzzy before they gave me back the front, and that was about it (kinda going off of what my friends told me, I don’t have specifics)",1,1761593489.0,plural,2,1.0,False

Now, he may run for Congress in RI","Victor Mellor, the Florida businessman who took part in the Jan. 6, 2021, march to the U.S. Capitol to protest an election result he still does not believe – and who has traveled more recently at retired Army Gen. Michael Flynn's side on his ""Reawaken America"" tour – has set his sights on a Rhode Island congressional seat.

The ""likely"" candidate for the 2nd Congressional District seat currently held by Democrat Seth Magaziner rented a modest house on Burnett Road in Warwick and registered to vote in Rhode Island on Oct. 9, according to city election officials.

A Woonsocket native who has lived in Florida for the last 30 years, Mellor, 56, will be eligible to vote in Rhode Island on Nov. 8, after the minimum 30-day residency.

Jan. 6 one of 'Top 5' moments in his life

Mellor told The Journal during a recent get-together over coffee at Gregg's in Providence that he and his 20-something-year-old son made it inside the Capitol on Jan. 6. When he looks back, he said, the day ranks among the ""Top 5"" moments in his life, after the birth of his children and his new grandchild.

""When you watch the media, you think it's just the big violent riot, just clashing everywhere, and that's not what happened. We're standing out in front of the rotunda and we're singing the national anthem ... families .... a lot of kids, a lot of old people, a lot of immigrants.

""It was just one of them moments in life, [and] I've done a lot of cool things,"" Mellor said. ""And Jan. 6 was [in the] top five of the emotional feelings you have for being part of something.""

Asked why he wants to run for a congressional seat from Rhode Island, Mellor told The Journal, ""We just need to retake our country. And I'm sorry, the socialist wing of the Democratic party just has to go. It has to go.""

""I can afford to do anything. I can go do anything else, but I'm choosing to do this because I got little guys"" – two children under age 10 – ""and I'm going to help change the country for them.""

Magaziner's response

Magaziner's response to Mellor's likely GOP challenge: He's ""completely focused"" now on making ""life more affordable for Rhode Islanders by fighting for health care funding and opposing tariffs that are raising the costs of groceries.""

But, ""The stakes are high. No one who attacked the Capitol on January 6th should represent Rhode Island in Congress.""

Stepping back

Mellor sees all Democrats as ""vulnerable"" and Magaziner particularly so because of the relatively narrow margin of his wins in Rhode Island's 2nd Congressional District, including his 50.4%-to-46% win over Cranston's former Republican mayor, Allan Fung, in 2022.

Mellor said that he, unlike Magaziner's past opponents, can bring in big names and big money – and spend whatever it takes of his own money – to win the seat, and bring along any other Rhode Island candidates who want to stand with him.

""I'm not afraid of a fight,"" he said. ""I'll be the guy that takes all the arrows for all these other Republicans to stand up. One hundred percent.""

Does that mean he's going to help finance some other campaigns?

""One hundred percent,"" he said. ""This is going to be a statewide ... a full gamut up, down ballot all the way. Yes.""

But it is not yet fully clear why Mellor has zeroed in on blue state Rhode Island as a launching pad for his first run for elective office after making a name for himself in Florida as an anti-vaxxer, a close ally of another native Rhode Islander – former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn – and as the owner/builder of The Hollow.

What is The Hollow?

The Washington Post has described ""The Hollow"" in Venice, Florida, as ""Florida's playground for the far-right.""

Mellor smiled at a mention of the headline – and doesn't actually dispute it – but he adamantly disputes any suggestion that The Hollow, which includes a shooting range, is a militia training ground.

He said The Hollow started as a gathering place for parents upset that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had lifted mask-wearing requirements during COVID but their local school board had not.

""There was 30-some-odd mom groups that were created to help fight the mask mandates. ... I just brought everybody to The Hollow ... [and days later] we did a massive mask exemption signing with medical doctors.""

""Nobody was going to doctors anymore. They didn't trust them. I wasn't bringing my kids to the pediatricians either, because they were pushing masks and they were pushing the shots,"" Mellor said.

He said this led to his role in creation of the ""freedom-based"" We The People Health and Wellness Center.

""One of the prerequisites of working there [was] you had to be fired by the establishment,"" said Mellor, who as an avowed anti-vaxxer applauds U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s focus on his concerns.

Friendship with Michael Flynn

Mellor said the events at The Hollow also put him on Flynn's radar.

They became friends. Mellor says he's traveled with Flynn as his de facto, but unpaid, chief of staff and helped produce his movie, ""Flynn,"" which Mellor subtitles: ""Deliver the truth, whatever the cost.""

Flynn was briefly President Donald Trump’s first-term national security advisor. He subsequently pleaded guilty to charges of lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his conversations with a Russian diplomat during the presidential transition in late 2016.

He then sought to withdraw his guilty plea. The Justice Department moved to dismiss the case. A judge agreed after Flynn was pardoned by Trump.

Mellor is counting on new investigations to expose government campaigns against Trump and Flynn, dubbed ""Crossfire Hurricane"" and ""Crossfire Razor.""

""And that's all playing out right now ... [with] all the indictments that have started coming down and will continue to come down.""

On Jan. 6: 'I believe we were rightfully there'

Mellor has acknowledged being at the U.S. Capitol during the Jan. 6 protest.

""I believe we were rightfully there,"" he told USA TODAY during a ""States of America"" video interview.

While he was never charged, he told The Washington Post that he viewed those who were charged with having ""assaulted officers, trapped lawmakers and vandalized the home of Congress as 'political prisoners.'""

""I have all these videos. And it was peaceful,"" he said. ""... One of my videos [shows] another patriot bending over, picking up a piece of garbage and throw[ing] it in the trash can.""

""When we were standing out front and no violence, no nothing, and they start lobbing flash bangs at us,"" he said, referring to stun grenades. Asked who ""they"" were, he said the police. He is counting on a new congressional investigation to expose what happened that day.

When asked if he had ever been arrested, Mellor said he was charged with domestic violence in 1994, but the charges were dropped.

What changes does he want to see in elections?

Among the many things he would like to see: an executive order prohibiting the use of mail ballots and voting machines, and leaving the responsibility for counting paper ballots to the precincts where they were cast.

""Obviously, you have your emergency ballots and your overseas,"" he said. Beyond that, ""it's a corrupted system.""

Other things he'd like to change in Rhode Island, the US

""You can't even come to school in Rhode Island unless you have your shots,"" Mellor said. His response when asked if that should be revoked: ""Absolutely. One hundred percent. The evidence is there.""

Rhode Island's ""current energy policies are disastrous. They don't work. They're super expensive, and all it's doing is raising the cost of living for regular Rhode Islanders. .... Offshore wind specifically. And the solars don't help much either. It's not worth the investment.""

Mellor said he would also ""definitely get rid of the transgender policies in the school system... I would get rid of the catering towards it ... If I could, I'd [also] get rid of the DEI '1619' policies and let's get back to a traditional ... ABCs ... The educational system in Rhode Island is beyond broken.""

On what Mellor calls his ""listening tour"" of Rhode Island over the last several months, he said: ""I've not met a single person that says, 'Hey, Rhode Island education's great.' But I'm not going to have a whole lot to do with that until I control federal dollars.""

He said Flynn was drawn to him because his activities in Florida illustrated Flynn's motto: ""Local action, national impact.""

It is not yet clear if the leaders in the state's super-minority party – the GOP – see Mellor as a potential help or distraction. State GOP Chair Joe Powers has not yet responded to Journal inquiries.

Either the cafés are blasting music like it’s a club, or they have these 10 random outdated books nobody actually touches.

Surat Reads is for people who just wanna read, vibe, and connect — nothing fancy.
We can pick a quiet spot, meet up, read together, maybe even exchange books or talk about what we’re reading lately.
I want this to be a small community where book people in Surat can finally find their people.

1ohnwpr,https://tipstor.net/why-this-lightweight-backpack-is-every-nomads-secret/,Why This Lightweight Backpack Is Every Nomad’s Secret,"There’s a certain breed of traveler who can make chaos look graceful. Airports, train stations, overnight buses across Southeast Asia. All handled with a smirk, a half-empty bottle of water, and the right backpack. Not just any backpack, though. The lightweight laptop travel backpack has become the unsung hero of global wanderers and caffeine-fueled nomads, the ultimate travel hack for anyone who treats movement as a way of life.

The beauty of this thing lies in its precision. It’s not trying to be fancy. It doesn’t scream luxury or pretend to be “adventure-ready.” It’s just built right. It fits up to a 15-inch laptop and an 11-inch tablet without bulging like a stuffed burrito. There’s room for cables, chargers, notebooks, and those inevitable airport snacks that somehow become dinner. And at under USD 50 on Amazon, it’s a steal compared to those overpriced designer impostors that crumble at the first sign of rain.

The water-resistant fabric is a quiet rebellion against the travel gods. Rainstorm in Lisbon? Coffee spill in an overcrowded café in Hanoi? No problem. The backpack shrugs it off with the indifference of a seasoned road warrior. Inside, the compartments are engineered with the same thoughtfulness you’d expect from someone who’s missed a few flights and learned the hard way how to pack efficiently. Each pocket has purpose. Each zipper knows its role. It’s a 100% commitment to sanity in a world where your boarding pass can disappear in three seconds flat.

This isn’t just a bag. It’s an act of self-preservation. Travelers who rely on it aren’t out to impress anyone. They’re out to survive the unpredictable. From the frenzied streets of Bangkok to the sterile calm of Zurich’s terminals, it adapts. The breathable padding keeps shoulders from mutinying during long layovers, while the streamlined design keeps you from looking like an extra in a post-apocalyptic movie.

The lightweight laptop travel backpack is the quiet MVP of modern exploration. The kind of gear that doesn’t just carry your stuff. It carries your freedom. Travelers who know, know. Those who don’t are probably still wrestling with a wheeled carry-on in a cobblestone alley somewhere in Rome. And that’s fine. But for the rest, this is the best travel hack. The difference between dragging your life and carrying it with style.

1ohnvr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ohnvr4/i_work_at_a_café_and_an_older_regular_made_me/,I work at a café and an older regular made me uncomfortable,"Hey everyone, I am a student and work at a local café where we’re encouraged to make small talk with customers. A lot of our regulars are older people and seniors, and over time I’ve gotten to know quite a few of them. Most of them are really sweet they’ll ask about my day, share stories, sometimes even invite me to barbecues or small gatherings. It’s always been friendly and wholesome.

There’s one older gentleman let’s call him D who comes in regularly. He’s always been polite and kind, so I’ve treated him the same way I treat other regulars. A few days ago, he asked if I’d like to grab a coffee after work. I honestly thought he meant it in the same friendly way others have just a casual chat.

But then yesterday, he messaged me saying he was “the guy who asked me out”, and that made my stomach drop. I suddenly realized he might’ve meant it romantically. He’s at least 50–60 years older than me.

Now I feel really uncomfortable. I’ve been ignoring his messages and making excuses not to meet. I even thought maybe I should just go for a quick coffee out of politeness, but the more I think about it, the more uneasy I feel.

I don’t want to be rude he’s a regular and I still see him at the café but I also don’t want to give him the wrong idea or make myself unsafe.

How should I handle this? Should I just tell him directly I’m not interested? Or keep ignoring and hope it stops?

I feel really stupid for not realizing sooner, but I genuinely thought he saw me the way other older regulars do like a daughter or friend.

I was hoping to see if anyone had any tips on troubleshooting

I have a delonghi La specialista maestro EC9665M, bought in 2021

Recently we have noticed there is leaking around the portafilter when brewing.  I bought a few gasket rings to replace and made sure it was flush and everything installed correctly.  It still leaks at the back end of the portafilter, during mid brew and a few minutes afterwards.  

I have checked to make sure there were no cracks in the gasket apparatus. I adjusted my grinds multiple times with no success.

I run a de-scale and clean the coffee outlet monthly.

Anyone have any thoughts on how to troubleshoot?

Thanks in advance

I wrote this on a whim at the spur of the moment so its mostly just a summary of expenses with some commentary based on what I remember.

I wrote a money diary previously, you can look at my post history to find it. I no longer DJ around town because it requires way too much networking/schmoozing/partying and with my 9-5 I mostly feel like cozying up at home and going to bed early these days.

Background: I have a bachelor's degree in physics. My dad gave me $300/mo in college, totaling about $15,000.

Job: Analyst in O&G. My job is super boring looking at numbers all day, sending out reports, and filing regulatory reports. I got laid off from my remote job in January, got a new job in March that is 100% in office and I forgot how much a commute + gym makes me so tired at the end of the day. But yay I have health insurance for only $50/mo! I max out my 401k ($2606/mo) so my paychecks NET 2x per month = $2530. I already maxed out my IRA for this year.

Cash Assets: $265k IRA + $15K brokerage + $5k CD + $8K HYSA + $20k 401K = $313k

Rental Income: in 2020 the landlord of the condo I was renting decided to retire and sell his properties so I bought it for $95K with $20k down, 3.75% interest. Its now worth approx. $125k and I owe probably about $60k. It basically breaks even or at a slight loss after maintenance and vacancy but I keep it as a future snowbird property when I retire in hopefully 10 years and move partially back to the cold Midwest state I am from. Mortgage + HOA + HVAC maint is $1110 and I rent it out for $1395. Last week I spent $700 on a new dishwasher, washing machine, and repairs to the downstairs neighbor after an appliance leaked.

House: purchased in 2021. Cost $285K, put $20K down, 2.75% interest, worth approx. $330K, owe approx. $250k

Car: unfortunately my old beater was totaled last year so I had to buy a new car. 2022 Toyota for $26k cash. I hope this car also lasts me at least 20 years!

DEBT: $5.5K on a 0% interest credit card until Aug 2026: $1500 is from a cross country road trip we took this last summer, $2k in medical expenses for my IPL eye treatments, $1000 is a ""time share preview year"" I purchased for fun when we stayed at a time share resort. The rest is some dental work and groceries.

Expenses:

$1830 Mortgage PITA (includes $55 PMI)  

$180ish Electric average (varies between 80 to 280)  

$40-ish natural gas. 

$55-ish water although it was 100 last month because I left the outdoor spigot on oops!  

$20 sewer line insurance. 

$15 HVAC maintenance plan for 2x per year cleaning/checkups. 

$200 car insurance: full coverage for 2 people plus a $1MM Umbrella policy. 

$40 pet insurance for dog. 

$43 gym membership; plus a one time yearly fee of $55. 

$4 Hulu/Disney black Friday deal baby. 

$5 PBS. 

$7 Sirius Radio. 

$13 Spotify. 

$11 B12 supplement subscription. 

$15 Youtube; I think there may be a way to combine this with google storage for a cheaper total monthly fee that I will look into.
  
$35 Internet. 

$40 Ad-hoc donations. Last month was PBS, this month was a coworker's family funeral expenses and a friend's cancer fundraiser, and next month will probably be to buy groceries for my best friend who relies on SNAP to feed her kids. I often use my Boost to send flowers and food to friends who are ill/have surgery.  

$200/year Mint Mobile. 

$20/year Google storage. 

$85/year Britbox; not sure I will renew since I have PBS, but I love my period dramas and detective mysteries. 

$30/year Kroger Boost (normally 60 but they gave me a discount coupon this year)  

$14/year Amazon recently offered me a year for $14, so I thought I'd try it to have access to all the movies and tv shows I want to see, but I've since discovered you still have to pay to rent most of them! What a ripoff! I will not be renewing! Prior to this I was using the free shipping that my Dad shared with me, but they are doing away with that, and I will definitely be boycotting them going forward.

I aim to add at least $500 to savings every month.

My boyfriend of 5 years, Novio lives with me but is currently unemployed again for going on 5 months and not paying bills. He normally contributes $1k for rent/utilities/groceries/insurance.

Diary:

Saturday: Spent several hours flipping heavy logs in my backyard from a tree I had cut down to dolly them out of the yard. The power company cut it down for free since it was on a power line. Called my dad to ask him to come over (he lives 1 hour away) at some point in the future to chainsaw up the tree trunk. I'm sure I will buy him lunch. Frugal win! Novio broke his hand recently so he stayed inside and made burgers for lunch. My friend called me last minute to ask if I wanted to go to Ren Fest with her tomorrow so she doesn't have to go alone. I am trying to save money but decide YOLO and say yes. I went to the thrift store and buy some clothes, house decor, and a few items of clothing for Novio to wear to ren fest since he's not a costume guy, but he will wear something if I get it for him. Got him a green hooded vest to pair with some harem pants I got him previously. I used a 40% off coupon and spent $40. Bought my ren fest ticket for $30. Novio paid for his own ticket. He asks me if I will buy him some skittles on the way home lol so I stop at the grocery and get a big bag for $2.70. Tired from the yardwork so we just cuddle the pets and watched some movies: My Name is Bruce and Ash Vs Evil Dead. Its a tricky balance act to get the pets in their preferred spots on Mamma without touching each other, or they will erupt in chaos. Perrito and Thing 1 cannot even stand to look at each other or all hell will break loose, so there is a pillow wedged between them to block their sight. No one cuddles with Novio because he is Not The Mamma. I cracked open one of my Aldi pumpkin ciders. I'm not usually a fan of pumpkin spice anything because I am allergic to cinnamon, but this mostly tastes like sweet hard cider with a hint of allspice.

Sunday: Walked Perrito for an hour. He lives for this, but he is an old chihuahua with back problems so  we only go once in awhile. Gave my friend $20 for gas and tolls. Brought a refillable water bottle, granola bars, and Perfect bar in my bag for the Fest to save some coin (turkey legs are $23 this year!). We went to the burlesque show which my friend paid for previously. She wouldn't accept any money from me, but I found a reflexology massage punch card in my wallet with one massage left and gave it to her (worth approx. $30 previously purchased). Felt like I was fading after hours of walking so I had a glass of coke at the show and tipped the server ($5). I had some bites of my friend's turkey leg and Novio's sausage on a stick, and ate my snacks. Said hi to some friends working and performing. $10 for 2 entries to the medieval torture museum. 17k steps! I dressed up as a mushroom fairy with LED wings for the Fairy theme, and used some white clown makeup to dot my face.  

Monday: Very exhausted from this weekend. I always pack leftovers and homemade cold brew for lunch, but didn't prepare anything due to my busy weekend. Bought a trenta iced coffee at Starbucks with some bonus points I had been saving, drank 1/4, and scavenged emergency desk and freezer meals I keep at work. Slept an hour in my car at lunch. Went home and vegetated. Novio grilled skirt steak fajitas. Watched Ash vs Evil Dead.

Tuesday: Woke up with a terrible sore throat. Oh that's why I was so worn out yesterday. Got a notification some supplements (L-theanine and probiotics) shipped from Amazon subscribe and save. I am slowly working on finding replacements for ordering from Amazon so this is way less than I used to order. $37. My usual breakfast is that I dump 2 packets of gf brown sugar instant oatmeal in a jar, add water, and its ready to eat when I get to work. Work, slept in my car at lunch, feeling better so went to yoga at my gym in the evening. Picked up some items from my Buy Nothing group. A turkey rack for my roasting pan and a disco ball wine bottle cork. Novio made ground beef tacos and homemade pinto beans for Taco Tuesday. More Evil Dead.

Wednesday: Go to change the litter robot and realize I am out of cat litter. $108 Chewy order for world's best lotus scented corn litter. Expensive little shits. Literally. Work, short power nap in my car at lunch, and went swimming at the gym afterwards. Novio made a roast chicken and rice for dinner. He took the car to help his cousin with something so I watched Ripper Street and read a few chapters of All Creatures Great and Small before bed.

Thursday: Finally finished my Starbucks iced coffee! Wasted some time at work looking at doorbell cameras. I live near a sketchy part of town so I have to deal with people trying to squat in the vacant property and lot next door, theft, asking for money, etc. The one I want is $90 on Amazon but I'm trying to avoid them so I find the same one at local Microcenter but its $120! I try to decide if its worth an extra $30 to boycott Amazon. I leave it in my cart and don't buy it yet since I just splurged on a special pillow, silk pillowcase, and organic tea leaves last week as my monthly ""splurge"". Shoutout to David's Organic Teas for reasonably priced organic leaves. One of my favorite amazon replacement companies. Also, I discover my dashcam I just recently installed stopped working, but Novio offers to look at the fuse box installation before I call the company for help. He is very handy and has saved me thousands of dollars on plumbing, construction, and car repairs. Ordered groceries for delivery tomorrow to take advantage of the Boost rebate and extra fuel points. If I spend $175 each week for 3 weeks, they give me $70 back. $166 for chuck roasts, apple cider, burgers, fruits, veggies, lactose free milk, gf pizza, beef bacon, beans, razors, charcoal, gf oatmeal packets, gf sourdough, frozen gf burritos for work, cat food, pop and snacks for my delivery drivers, and a giant pumpkin to take pictures with Perrito. Today I actually felt rested! So I went to the gym at work on my lunch break. 70! Pushups PR!, barbell squats, and recline bike. Novio made burgers for dinner. I walk Perrito, more Evil Dead episodes, and strategic cuddling.

My absurdly expensive Pillow Cube arrived and I eagerly try it out and it works great! No ""neck crunchies"" in the morning! That's what I call it when I wake up on a flat deflated pillow and my painful neck cracks loudly several times when I move it back into place.

Friday: Mornings are always chaotic trying to feed 3 terrors and pack my breakfast and lunch. Today I brought a water bottle full of cold brewed black tea. Trying to cut down on my coffee consumption. Novio drives me to work so he can borrow my car for a job interview. The dash cam randomly starts working again! I ate my leftover burger early and I'm feeling snacky so on my lunch break I take a long walk to the grocery and buy imitation crab, laughing cow, a HUGE container of organic blueberries, and a cucumber. $15. Its gorgeous out but I underestimate how humid it is for an hour walk and arrive back super sweaty. I roasted a turkey I got on sale last week for .99/lb. We'll eat some and use the rest for homemade dog food. Only the best for Prince Perrito! Novio dropped me at home and drove to 2 Autozones to return a defective car part and find the correct one for me. I dragged him out to Noche Caliente at a bar with a huge outdoor patio and live bands, he bought 2 drinks but 1 was half price. I went to bed but Novio stayed up all night making a flyer for a friend's cancer fundraiser.

Saturday: Bicycled to gym and swam. Made turkey pozole for lunch. Novio and I drove to his parents so that he can help his dad and son fix and borrow their second car. His car died years ago but we both worked remotely at the time so we just shared my car until now. Gas $16. Boost gives me $1 off per gallon. His mom made Mexican rice, beans, ground beef and potatoes. Drove home through a huge storm and saw a lot of stranded drivers sitting in flood waters. We had to go around one part through a parking lot.

Sunday: Picked up some glass mushroom containers from Marketplace, $20. I was really worn out from the previous day and it took all of my being not to treat myself to my favorite takeout and coffee. Took a nap, picked up a bookcase from Buy Nothing, had to buy new bungee cables to attach it to my roof rack. Had to drive back to his parents to pick up the car after his son fixed the catalytic converter. $10.



Total: $463.7. Pretty typical week except for the festival and litter, but I often have some sort of small home maintenance or pet expense. We eat out only 1x per month

1ohntmq,https://getjumper.io/?ref=nikita,This is how you make a FCP add-on. 👏,"I've been using FCPX (now FCP) for about 15 years, and I love it. Yes, there are things I wish existed that don’t, and yes, there are things that can be better or different to make it easier, but as a professional in this industry, I don't see myself leaving this app anytime soon. From feature films to short vertical videos, FCP has been an incredible tool.
Recently, I've been editing a documentary, 4TB of archival footage shot on multitudes of cameras from iPhone to digitized DVR tapes, all from the last 30 years. Most of the metadata is wrong, and organization on the drive is nonexistent. Over 300 hours of footage. In addition to that, there is also the fact that this documentary is in 3 different languages, with people switching between them mid-conversation. I speak all three, so understanding it is not a problem for me, but digging through things is exhausting.
Earlier this year, I was looking for a tool that could help transcribe this for me, and I found Jumper. And I have to tell you - I have subscribed immediately after the demo and have not targeted it in the last 3 months of use. It is mind-blowing. 
The tool does the following: it integrates into your NLE and scans your library. What I expected was that it would look at the metadata, maybe some keywords, maybe analyze a bit of English to help me search for clips with a bit more context than FCP's native search. OMG, this blew my mind.

The app analyzed every frame of the 300+ hours of footage, and I can just type things like ""woman holding a mug of coffee"" or ""palm tree with a car parked under it,"" and it immediately finds the clip and the place in it where that is shown. Purely from looking at the frames. Incredible, but wait. IT SCANNED FOR LANGUAGE! It transcribed every piece of dialogue in every one of three languages that I needed, and I can just search phrases, and it gives me the exact points of where people talk about whatever it is I search for.
And even more - all of this is done on the device, so none of the processing requires the internet. It all stays on the device too, so it never leaves your computer. It also gives you full transcriptions to download, so I can take a long interview take with a subject in one language, get their transcription, translate it in whatever translation tool I want, and send the English version to a client or an assistant who might want to read the entire thing and pick important parts.

Another part that absolutely convinced me is the purchase option. Not a subscription (though that’s also an option), but the ability to buy and own this software is something so rare lately that it is incredible to see.

Sorry for the long post, but this really blew me away to the point where I immediately requested an affiliate link so I could share this with people. I never promote things that I don’t personally use, but I just had to with this one. So if this sounds like something you might need, please give these guys a try. It’s truly incredible.

TL:DR - incredible tool that analyzes your footage, gives you transcription and visual search, all kept on device with a single payment option to own.

Part of me still thinks it’s wrong—like I’m exposing something that was never meant to be read.

However, the cops gave me the journal, stating that I was listed as David’s emergency contact. It was found in the passenger seat of his car the night he was discovered. Pages half-burned, some soaked in whiskey, others covered in what looked like ash and blood.

I almost threw it away. God knows I wanted to.

But curiosity… or guilt, maybe… made me read it.

The first few entries were just ramblings—David blaming himself for the fire, talking about his wife, Hailey, and their kids. But then things got dark.

He wrote about hearing voices, seeing them in mirrors, and smelling smoke that wasn’t there. The further I read, the more his writing changed—becoming sloppier, more fragmented, and paranoid.

The last couple of entries however were written like he got his sanity back compared to the entires before.

And that’s what you’re about to read,

I don’t know if what he described was real or if it was all in his head.

However, after what I saw when I returned to the house…

I’m not so sure anymore.



Apirl 12, 2015

“I can remember it like it was yesterday—every vivid moment, every smell, every sound—all of it permanently fixed in my head.” I groaned, taking another shot of whiskey.

“Dude, it’s been five years since the accident. When will you let the past be the past and move on?” Mason replied, tone flat, eyes dull from hearing this speech too many times.

I took two more shots before answering. “If you’re trying to cheer me up, you’re doing a fucken shit job at it.” I slammed the glass down. “I lost everything in that damn fire, Mason. Everything I cared about. My wife, Hailey… my kids, Thomas and Emily.”

Mason sighed and turned toward me, pity softening his expression. “Come on, David. Is this how they would’ve wanted you to live? A jobless drunk, sleeping in your car?”

I stared down at the sticky countertop, the reflection of the neon beer sign rippling in spilled liquor. “You think I don’t ask myself that every night?”

The bar hummed with low chatter and distant laughter, but for me it was all white noise—just ghosts pretending to be people.

“I’m just trying to help David. We’ve been friends since kindergarten; there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for you.”

Mason stood up and pulled out his wallet, placing cash under his glass, and handed me two hundred-dollar bills.

“Use this money wisely, man, please, don’t just spend it on more alcohol or drugs.”

He gives me one last look and pats my shoulder before exiting the bar, leaving me sitting at the counter alone.

The rain was cold when I finally left the bar. It hissed on the asphalt, soaking through my jacket. My car sat where I always parked it—alone, under a flickering streetlight that made the wet metal glisten like oil. I climbed in, the seat creaking, the stale smell of whiskey and sweat filling the air.

On the dash, the photo stared back at me: Hailey’s smile, Thomas’s missing front tooth, Emily clutching her stuffed rabbit. I reached out, thumb tracing Hailey’s cheek.

“I miss you,” I whispered.

Something shifted in the back seat—just a faint rustle.

I turned quickly—nothing but shadows and my worn blanket. I exhaled, laughing to myself. “Too much whiskey again.” But the air carried a smell that didn’t belong there.

Burnt wood.

I froze.

That smell… that damn smell.


It started as a whisper in my sleep.

“David…”

I woke up sweating and with a pounding headache. The car windows were fogged from the inside. Outside, fog hugged the lot like a ghost. I wiped the glass with my sleeve—and froze.

Written in the condensation were the words:

WHY DID YOU LEAVE US?

The letters bled down the glass as I blinked, melting like ash in water.

I scrambled out, flashlight in hand, scanning the lot. No one there. The fog moved like breath, curling and folding around me. I could swear I heard children laughing—a sound both sweet and wrong, echoing too close.

When I got back in, the photo was gone.

My hands shook as I searched the seat, the dash, and under the floor mat. Nothing. Then, from behind me, a voice whispered through the dark:

“Dad?”

I spun around. Empty. The air reeked of burnt plastic.

I drove all night, too afraid to stop.



April 13, 2015

“Man, you look like hell,” Mason said the next morning. We sat in the diner, coffee steaming between us.

“I didn’t sleep,” I muttered.

He leaned back, studying me. “You’ve gotta stop doing this to yourself. The fire wasn’t your fault.”

I looked up sharply. “Wasn’t it? I told Hailey I’d fix that damn outlet. I told her I’d be home early. I wasn’t.”

“David, stop,” Masons expression changed looking more serious. “There was nothing you could’ve done David, it wasn’t your fault. This could have happened to anyone.”

I looked up at Mason holding back tears “I was at work when it started. The wiring caught. The whole damn house went up in minutes. The fire chief said they didn’t even make it out of the fucken hallway.”

Silence stretched between us. Mason rubbed his temple, searching for words that didn’t exist.

“If you  keep chasing their ghosts, and you aren’t careful, you’ll end up joining them,” he said finally.

Maybe that’s what I wanted.



Apirl 18, 2015

Nights bled together. I stopped seeing people, stopped calling Mason. The bottle became my companion. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw them—the house, the flames licking the windows, Hailey’s silhouette at the stairs.

Then, one night, I woke to the sound of humming.

It was her voice. Soft, gentle. The lullaby she used to sing to Emily.

“Go to sleep, my little star…”

My breath hitched. “Hailey?”

The air shimmered in front of me. A faint outline formed—her shape in the driver’s seat beside me, skin pale, eyes empty. She turned, smiling that same perfect smile that once melted my heart.

“Come home, David.”

I blinked—and she was gone.

But in the passenger seat, lying where she’d been, was the photo from before… edges charred, her face blackened by soot.



Apirl 19, 2015

Today, I drove to what was left of our home. I hadn’t been there since the funeral.

The property was overgrown, and the mailbox rusted and bent. The skeleton of the house still stood, hollow and black. The roof had caved in years ago. I stepped inside, each board groaning beneath my boots.

The air was damp, thick with mildew and something else… something sweet and rotten.

Every step echoed. The wallpaper peeled in strips, revealing smoke-stained studs beneath.

Then I heard it.

A child’s laughter—light, muffled, coming from upstairs.

“Thomas?” I whispered, half believing.

I climbed the charred steps, the wood soft and crumbling under my weight. The hallway stretched longer than I remembered.

At the end, Emily’s room.

Her door was open.

Inside, the walls were scorched black, and the ceiling was half-collapsed. In the corner, her stuffed rabbit sat upright, untouched by time, one glass eye missing.

And behind it, scrawled across the wall in black soot:

“COME HOME, DAD.”

My stomach turned. I backed away—and heard the floor creak behind me.

“David.”

Her voice again. Close this time. Warm.

I turned—and saw Hailey standing at the end of the hall. Her face was blistered, skin cracked and oozing, but her smile… that smile was the same.

“You came back,” she said softly. “We missed you.”

I couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe. She stepped closer, bare feet leaving wet ash prints on the floor.

“Hailey… what—what are you?”

“We’re waiting, David.” Her voice distorted, breaking apart into static. “You said you’d never leave us.”

Behind her, two small shapes appeared. Thomas and Emily. Their eyes were hollow pits, skin pale and split.

Thomas held out his hand, the skin of his arm peeling like paper. “Dad… come play.”

Emily giggled, her teeth black and cracked. “Stay with us, Dad.”

My heart slammed against my ribs. “No—no, you’re not real—”

The walls groaned. Flames erupted down the hallway, crawling like living things. Smoke filled my lungs.

Hailey’s voice grew deeper, layered with something inhuman. “It’s time to come home.”

I stumbled backward, tripping over debris. The floor split beneath me, heat searing my legs. I screamed as the world became fire.

The house was alive—breathing, burning, consuming. The walls pulsed like veins, the ceiling dripped molten tar.

They closed in around me.

Hailey’s charred hand reached through the smoke, gripping my wrist with impossible strength. Skin sloughed off her fingers, exposing bone, but she held fast.

“Stay, David,” she whispered. “It’s better here. You don’t have to hurt anymore.”

Her eyes were black pits glowing from within, twin furnaces of grief and rage.

Thomas and Emily circled me, laughter warping into shrieks. The air screamed.

I felt something break inside me—something human
.
“Okay,” I whispered. “I’ll come home.”

Her grin widened.

Flames swallowed us whole.


That’s where David’s journal ends. 

They found the car the next morning, parked in front of the house's ruins. Engine still running. Inside, the front seat was empty except for a journal, a bottle of whiskey, and a single photograph on the dashboard.

Three faces smiled back, edges burned away until only one remained clear: David’s.

The police report called it a suicide. I identified the body later—half-burned, found in the basement of the old house.

Locals say if you drive down Sparrow Lane late at night, you’ll see the glow of fire flickering through the trees. Some say they hear laughter.

Others say it’s crying.

And a few claim that if you listen closely enough…

You can still hear a man whispering inside the flames,

“I’m home.”

If you don't know him already check out his amazing instagram and YouTube channel!

To give you an idea, this build took about 3-4 hours (excluding drying time)

Things i will change for my next build:
-Only coffee stir sticks, not lollypop sticks.
-Use a finer texture paste.
-Don't use cheap craft-store paint, damn that sucks monkeyballs.

1ohnn7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ohnn7l/aita_for_not_being_supportive_of_my_friend_after/,"AITA for not being supportive of my friend after her family ""shunned"" her?","Hi everyone! I'm writing this thinking that I'm not wrong, but would love to get a different perspective in case I'm missing something. My friend (f23) met with me for coffee and shared her recent family drama, but I literally cannot feel (super) bad for her because it seems like it was her fault.

Her older sister (f31) had come to visit which she had been super excited for. They were super close and she had practically raised my friend before she moved abroad and started a life there. My friend has lamented that life made it difficult for them to remain close, so a month with her was incredible. Now imagine my surprise when a week into the one month visit, my friend tells me that she wants to meet for coffee and potentially needs to crash at my place for the month.
Her sister came with her (I think?) 2 year old child. My friend has been childfree since we were teens and while I've also been critical of having kids, I do love to see and interact with them. My friend didn't know her sister was bringing her baby and that's immediately where the tension started from. When their family went to the airport, my friend was completely shell shocked that her sister came in with extra baggage and a baby strapped to her chest. From what she told me, she questioned her sister about why she brought the baby, how she could feel comfortable doing a long haul flight with said child, and bring them into the house knowing she doesn't feel comfortable around them all within a week. Mind you, she lives in her parents house which her sister is now also staying in. Her sister felt uncomfortable and was booking a hotel nearby instead, but when their parents found out, they had a huge fight and told my friend that if she has a problem with their grandchild being here, she can get out of their house.

I know it's an unfortunate situation for her, but I literally cannot see how she doesn't see herself being in the wrong. Why would she harrass he sister for bringing her daughter? Where did she think the baby was going to go? Why didn't she even ask her sister if she'd bring the baby? When I asked her that, she said she doesn't ask her sister about her niece because she's childfree and doesn't care. I was an asshole here because I said that seems to do with her being a child hater, but I digress. Her parents kept her sister's room the same too, so it's not like she was subjected to a crying baby on her head either (their rooms were down the hall from each other). She's not giving me a clear answer to what the real issue of her sister bringing her neice was other than that she didn't expect it. I feel like she's being ungrateful for the opportunity she has to spend with her sister and I just can't tell her whatever she wants to hear, so now she's upset that I'm not being a good friend when she needs comfort. If I am wrong, please help me see the other side if there is one.",3,1761592564.0,AITAH,14,0.72,False

My bf is trying to quit nicotine right now. First it was cigarettes a couple of years ago then nicotine vapes and now its the Zone pouches. Long story short, what got us into a fight was when he filled my Keurig reservoir up to the very brim and then tried to BLOCK me from grabbing the reservoir not just once but twice. In the midst of fighting one of us knocked over a bottle of wine that was next to the coffee maker and unfortunately it landed on his foot which made him even angrier where he smacked me in the face and yelled at me, basically telling me it was all MY fault and why can't I just shut up when he's quitting nicotine. Am I the a hole that should have just said fine, whatever to how full the Keurig was or other stupid stuff that he does??

1ohna9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1ohna9m/am_i_being_gaslit/,Am I being gaslit?,"So my husband and I moved from the south back to my home state in the PNW. We sold his property and as he has been an ocean boy he wanted to come back to my state. So during the course of getting ready my parents had us come back to their home and we have been with them for 3 months looking for work which is more plentiful here then where we were in the south. My husband just started a pest control job which pays very well but we are having to wait for his first paycheck. Me, I have been hired and waiting for the background check to come through at a coffee shop kiosk in a grocery store but with the promise to train me to be a barista trainer. This works out perfect because my husband gets the company car on Tuesday and I have ours. We did, before, apply for EBT benefits and got the max for two people, yes it was used up in October and have been having to hang on and when I mentioned this to my father he said that it was ok and he would help...no biggie....right...WRONG.

This morning as I am getting my husband's lunch together and making him breakfast and it's 5:30AM, my father starts going after some gnat traps my husband put and I told him they have been working. Then he accuses me of drinking all of the milk  in a gallon jug from Costco which has another twin in the fridge, I told him I had a glass and I'm lactose intolerant so I have to be careful about how much dairy I consume. Not even a ""good morning"" and he left. 

Now, he calls my mother to complain about me, how we haven't paid rent in 3 months, how he's been footing the food when they had told us to save the money from the sell of the property and how we blew through it when we didn't. We paid bills and had some living expenses that we paid using the money from the sell. When I responded that we would be moving out and it's probably best we not see each other they called me bipolar and compared me to my insane, narcisstic grandmother. My mother yelling at me that I'm not listening to her like I'm still a child not a woman close to 40. I just don't know what they are going to complain about later on that they said they were fine about. God, we need to get out of here, that paycheck can't come soon enough. Everything we do is under judgement and it just feels like too much. We have been helping them around the house but apparently they want more. I heard my mother say everyone thinks I'm crazy including my husband and I burn bridges, I feel like I'm being gaslit.

I just wish I knew what to do.",1,1761591772.0,TrueOffMyChest,2,1.0,False

As the title says, I am looking to connect with new friends for online chat. All that I ask is that you be around my age, within reason. Oh and also, if you have any shared interests, that would be an added bonus as well.

I have recently moved to a new area, and being very socially anxious and introverted, I tend to not go out a lot. My interests include movies and shows, horror and sci-fi, like to watch the formula one and football. I'm also in the process of trying to muster up the motivation to start reading again.

Coffee doesn’t usually wake me up, it’s just a nice morning ritual. 

This morning while on FT with my good friend (and fellow POTSie), I started having symptoms. Out of curiosity, I decided to add more salt to my cuppa just to see what would happen.

I definitely added too much (it has a slight, but noticeable, salty taste). But oh my god. I feel awake—*actually* awake—for the first time in I don’t know how long. 

TLDR: if you’re willing to drink slightly salty coffee. I highly recommend it. I feel like I could fight god and win",8,1761591688.0,POTS,7,1.0,False

I am a pretty active guy and take NO-Xplode (pre-workout powder) before I hit the gym. I noticed that I rarely get headaches during the day where I'm drinking coffee throughout the day. 

Putting that together, lately, when I've been feeling an attack coming on, I take a full scoop of NO-Xplode and it the results have been amazing. It's not a guarantee, and there are other downsides to an immediate shot of 225 mg caffeine at once, but I'll be damned if it hasn't helped me wildly. 

I have a high tolerance for caffeine, so ymmv. May start with half a scoop. Otherwise, this cycle is the first time I started taking melatonin to sleep through the night and that helps me sleep with the extra caffeine in my body and sleep through the night without getting a headache. 

Triptans, verapamil, etc. haven't worked for me in the past. I think this will be my only treatment moving forward barring another medicine to try: shrooms, oxygen, caffeine, melatonin. 

I've had mixed, or at least hard to determine, results with vitamin D, but it's pretty harmless to try. 

Sidenote: I nap a lot, but a nap during a cycle is a surefire way to get a headache. I don't wanna be a hypocrite, but please try to get a consistent sleep schedule when you have headaches. ",1,1761591324.0,clusterheads,5,1.0,False

I have been searching for a while for a nice quality, midrange brown leather hobo/""mom bag,"" smaller than a diaper bag but bigger than my usual everyday purses. I returned a few other options along the way, but I think I've found what I have been looking for in The Horse's Lou bag in Coffee. I have their Friday bag in the same color and am very happy with the color and quality, so when I saw this one come out for preorder, I was pretty quick to place one. It arrived last week and I got to wear it out and about on a visit to Brooklyn with my toddler this weekend. 

The size was perfect for me and while I didn't use the crossbody option, I love that it can be switched between shoulder bag and crossbody using the same strap. I feel like that versatility makes it so much more functional and also aesthetically more timeless! I don't have any super high end luxury bags, but for the price I find the Horse's leather super soft and pretty. I LOVE the slouchiness of it, which happens immediately when worn as a shoulder bag. 

The strap was very comfortable on my shoulder, never fell off, and honestly I didn't even notice the extra weight though I usually wear a smaller bag with less in it. One thing is the strap may be less comfortable than a thicker more solid strap on a bare shoulder in summer, because of the way it adjusts, but the adjustability seems worth it to me. 

I didn't experience any of the problems with smell with either of my horse bags that others have mentioned. I am not sure why it seems to affect some orders and not others.

1ohmwny,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeyondZ/comments/1ohmwny/how_git_version_control_works/,How Git Version Control Works,"# Introduction

Git — the world’s most popular and powerful version control system — has transformed how developers collaborate and manage source code. But before Git, most of us relied on a simple (and chaotic) method to track changes — by creating multiple copies of files like:

>

We’ve all been there — juggling dozens of file versions, getting confused about which one works, and struggling to remember *why* a file was changed. This old-school approach made it nearly impossible to manage projects efficiently.

That’s where **Git** saves the day. It’s a distributed version control system that allows developers to track every change, revert mistakes, collaborate seamlessly, and maintain a clean history of project evolution.

In this article, we’ll go beyond commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` — and explore **how Git actually works under the hood**, from states to internal architecture.

So grab your coffee, sit back, and let’s uncover the magic behind Git.

# A Quick Introduction to Git

In simple terms, **Git takes snapshots** of your project at different points in time. Every time you save (or commit) your changes, Git records a snapshot and assigns it a **unique SHA-1 hash** — a secure 40-character identifier.

You can later view, compare, or revert to any snapshot as needed. This mechanism creates a reliable “timeline” of your project’s evolution.

# The Core Concept: Git File States

At its core, Git operates through **three main file states** — *Modified*, *Staged*, and *Committed*.  
If you include a remote repository (like GitHub), you can think of it as **four states**, since files may also exist remotely.

To make this clearer, let’s use a simple real-world analogy.

# Imagine creating a photo album:

1. You **take photos** (but haven’t yet added them to the album).
2. You **select and arrange** the best ones on a table, ready to paste.
3. You **glue them** into the album and write captions describing each moment.

This process perfectly mirrors how Git manages files!

# 1. Modified State

You’ve made changes in your files, but haven’t saved them to Git yet.  
These files live in your **working directory**, and Git is not yet tracking these modifications.

It’s like clicking new photos — you’re still deciding which ones are worth keeping. You can freely edit, delete, or redo your work at this stage.

# 2. Staged State

When you run `git add`, you tell Git to **prepare these files for a commit**.  
They move into the **staging area**, where Git takes a snapshot of their current version.

You can still make further edits, and re-add updated files to the stage.  
This stage is like laying out printed photos beside your album — they’re ready to go, but not yet glued.

# 3. Committed State

Finally, running `git commit` saves the staged snapshot into the **Git directory** (the `.git` folder).  
This is like gluing your photos into the album and writing a short caption — the **commit message** — describing what changed and why.

>

# File Locations in Git

Each state corresponds to a different file location in Git’s internal structure.

|**State**|**Location**|**Description**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Modified|Working Directory|The files you’re editing locally.|
|Staged|Staging Area|Temporary storage for files ready to commit.|
|Committed|Git Directory (`.git`)|Permanent history of all commits.|

Let’s look at these areas in detail:

# 1. Working Directory

This is your project’s main folder — the one you open in VS Code or any IDE. It contains all editable files. Don’t confuse it with `.git`; that’s Git’s own system directory.

# 2. Staging Area

Also known as the *index*, the staging area lives inside the `.git` folder. It stores information about files queued for the next commit.

# 3. Git Directory

This is Git’s brain. It contains all committed files, branches, and version metadata. Whenever you clone a repository, this is what gets copied.

# Git Workflow: Step-by-Step

Here’s how the Git workflow looks in action:

1. `git clone` — Copies the remote repository to your local machine.
2. Edit or create files in the working directory.
3. `git add <file>` — Moves changes to the staging area.
4. `git commit -m ""message""` — Saves changes permanently to the local repository.
5. `git push` — Uploads your commits to the remote repository.

# Understanding git fetch, git merge, and git pull

When syncing with remote repositories, three commands are key:

* `git fetch`: Downloads changes from the remote repository to your *local repository*, but does **not** update your working directory.
* `git merge`: Merges fetched updates into your local workspace.
* `git pull`: Performs both `fetch` and `merge` in one step.

So why not always use `git pull`?  
Because running `git fetch` first lets you **review differences** before merging. You can use:

* `git diff HEAD` — To compare local commits with the fetched ones.
* `git diff` — To compare staged vs. working directory changes.

This helps prevent unwanted overwrites or merge conflicts.

# Git Internals: Inside the .git Directory

When you initialize a Git repository (`git init`), a hidden folder named `.git` is created. This directory stores all data and metadata that Git uses to track your project.

Inside `.git`, you’ll find these key components:

|**Component**|**Description**|
|:-|:-|
|`objects/`|Git’s database — stores compressed, hashed file contents (blobs, trees, commits).|
|`refs/`|Stores pointers (references) to commit objects, such as branches and tags.|
|`HEAD`|A file that points to the current branch’s latest commit.|
|`config`|Contains repository-specific configuration settings.|

# Git Plumbing Commands (Under the Hood)

Most Git users interact with **porcelain commands** like `git add` and `git commit`.  
But under the hood, Git relies on **plumbing commands** — the low-level building blocks.

Here’s what happens behind the scenes:

1. When you stage a file (`git add`), Git creates a **blob** — a binary representation of your file’s contents — and assigns it a **SHA-1 hash**.
2. Multiple blobs form a **tree**, representing the directory structure.
3. A **commit** object references the tree, stores author information, commit message, and parent commit.

This chain of blobs, trees, and commits forms the **entire project history**.

# Visualization

    Working Directory  →  Staging Area  →  Local Repository  →  Remote Repository
       (edit)                 (add)             (commit)             (push)
    

Each commit is a snapshot — not a diff — and Git efficiently compresses and stores only what’s needed.

# Conclusion

Git is more than a version control system — it’s a time machine for your code.  
From creating lightweight snapshots, using SHA-1 hashes, to managing commits through a smart reference system, Git’s architecture ensures both speed and reliability.

By understanding how Git actually works under the hood, you’ll not only become more confident with commands but also gain the ability to debug issues, resolve merge conflicts smartly, and manage projects at scale.

1ohmvjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZakBabyTV_Stories/comments/1ohmvjb/cold_carry/,Cold Carry.,"We pulled a man out of snowmelt below a slide path in central Idaho. Storm had just come off the ridge and left the creek high, cloudy, and cold enough to sting through rubber. He was in to his waist. Pants in ribbons. No boots. Lips the wrong color. He was trying to walk crosscurrent like the bank existed where he wanted it, not where it was.

We figured he slipped. He hadn’t.

We got him into spike. A meadow with tents knotted together by guyline, a stove that coughed more than it heated, gear laid on tarps to pretend it would dry. He wouldn’t give a name. He sat where we told him and watched the tent wall. He kept saying the same line: it spared me. Same tone every time, like reciting a policy he didn’t write.

We tried food. Jerky first. Then a tin mug of stew. He shoved the crate hard enough to rattle the lantern pole and yelled at the steam, not at us. Said if he ate, the ridge would hear.

Our EMT put a hand on his wrist and counted while the rest of us watched the zipper because watching anything felt better than listening. Pulse fast, steady. Skin cold, chest warm on the cheap thermometer. We blamed the lantern heat for the lack of breath fog. We blamed a lot of things on the lantern.

When the crew hiked to flag a new line, I stayed. Med tent. Lantern turned down. Rain ticking on the mesh like a clock you don’t want to own. The stove snapped once and went quiet.

He talked.

He said he and two friends went up for a high lake that sits in a rock bowl. Three nights. Fishing when the wind let them. Quiet when it didn’t. They sang old songs low the third night because the fire made a circle and quiet made a bigger one outside it.

Something answered.

Not echo. Echo comes back the same shape. This didn’t. It waited. Then returned the tune bent the wrong way, like it learned it while it was gone and preferred its version.

He wouldn’t call it anything except “the Hushed One.”

He said it learned their steps. Who unzipped which tent. Who left to piss and how long it took. Who opened the bear can and how quiet he tried to be. It didn’t rush. It took them when the dark felt thicker than canvas.

Mark went first. They followed a drag through needles to some whitebark and found his call whistle hanging from a twig. When he blew it, the note pulled inward. He tried again and felt the air come back at his face.

Javier went the next night. He swore he heard humming while it carried him across broken rock. Not Javier’s tune. The notes backward on purpose.

By morning he was alone. No insects, no birds. The lake lay flat like metal. He said even the small ripples near shore looked printed there, not moving with the rest.

He ran. Cut his hands on talus. Sliced a knee open bad enough he could see white and wrapped it in a shirt. Drank snowmelt until his stomach cramped. Food hurt his teeth like someone pressed on them from inside. He stuffed tissue in his ears and still felt a thought push at him from the back of his mouth: stop moving, kneel, let the cold finish it.

Then it spared him.

Dawn at the skyline. He said something unfolded out of stone. Not big. Just wrong where it should have been right. Shoulders under a hide that didn’t sit like a hide. A mouth that opened in the throat. No sound. A thought placed inside his head like a stamp pressed down hard:

You’re already carrying me.

He watched me to see if I’d laugh. I didn’t.

“You don’t get it,” he said. “It doesn’t have to follow anymore.” He pressed his palm to his chest like he was trying to stop a leak. “It sits here.”

We set a cot. We zipped the tent and pinned the sliders with a safety pin the way we do when we really don’t want porcupines getting into someone’s snacks. We left him with water and a blanket.

Before dawn, he was gone.

No cut guyline. No torn mesh. Zipper still pinned through both sliders. No prints inside. Blanket damp like fog had been poured into it. On the canvas there was a darker body shape that wasn’t quite his shape. Under the cot: eight pebbles in two neat rows of four. He hadn’t had pockets to carry them in.

We searched. Wind wiped most sign. In places the ground was soft enough to hold small things. There we found lines where fingertips had dragged like a brush. Four marks. A pause. Four more. The spacing wrong for hands. The stride wrong for feet. Those marks ran upslope onto old, polished rock and ended where the rock ended. Not a place so much as a feeling: as if the hill had already made up its mind and didn’t need to show work.

We broke the meadow into a clock. Each of us took a slice to the timber. Twice I heard my name from the wrong place, in my voice. The radio coughed and returned the end of an hour-old call: “—opy.” The second time it added “copy” before I said it, like I was late to my own sentence.

At dusk, fog came down off the ridge in a straight line and laid across camp like someone rolling carpet. The chow fly snapped once. The stove popped and then went quiet. The lantern hissed and kept hissing after we turned it down.

I checked the area around mess and found two things.

One: a coil of paracord half unwound and frayed as if worked by dull teeth or nails.

Two: wet handprints on the cooler lid. Not full palms—just five cold ovals, spaced too wide. Bare. The marks went thirty steps into brush and quit like the ground forgot how to take impressions.

We raised the trail cams to nine feet, set the sensitivity up, turned off sound to save cards, then turned it back on because silence didn’t seem like a good plan. We doubled watch. Logged times.

Two nights later we lost a sawyer.

Walt stepped out to piss. He didn’t come back.

We found him strung in a dead snag like laundry. Chest hollowed. Jaw intact. Tongue gone. No drag marks. No spray where there should have been. The ground under him looked undisturbed except for what we disturbed by standing there trying to make our faces do the work our hands couldn’t.

We radioed the district and the sheriff. We didn’t say theories. We said location and what we could verify. They told us to shut it down, mark the approach closed, and we could come in the morning. It was not said like a question.

The cameras showed gray bars from 2:07 to 2:14 AM. Audio sounded like breath through a tube. Those seven minutes matched the gap between the time Walt left and when we realized he was gone. On the frame after, the thermal picked up a tall cold column just outside the sensor range.

Behind it, almost touching its wrong shadow, stood the river man.

Smiling too wide. Shoulder blades lifted under the skin like something had grown sideways.

We broke camp fast. No speeches. No guesses we’d have to explain in daylight. Packed and moved while the fog stood in the lanes looking like distance.

I stayed to collapse the last cache. Last person in the meadow. Quiet in that heavy way ground gets after people leave, when the shape of the noise we made still hangs there without us.

I opened the bear box because you open it when you leave. You check, then you latch it so the next person doesn’t think you were lazy.

He was inside.

Not hiding. Folded into the corner like he had seen someone else do it first. Both hands in his mouth to the knuckles. Working the webbing like he could pull a seam and let something through. Fingers chewed raw. Skin lifting around the nails.

His lips moved. No words. A tune taken apart and fed back in. He paused on the same bent note each time, like waiting for a second voice.

I didn’t move.

He looked up once.

The message didn’t come by sound. It arrived in the head-bone spaces: ear, teeth, the little shelves behind the nose where weather settles.

You don’t have to be outside anymore.

Then he wasn’t there.

No step. No zipper. No air shift. Just a box again. Metal. Wet hide smell. My breath didn’t fog. The metal under my hand felt warm for a moment and then remembered to be cold.

That night I scrubbed my hands and black silt came out from under each nail. Fine stuff. River slow. I hadn’t been in the river since morning.

Next day I pulled the hinge pin and let the lid drop because doing something felt safer than doing nothing. On the walk out, the trail had one extra bend. I’ve hiked that drainage a dozen times. The bend was new to me and not to anyone else.

I wrote the report simple. Dates. Times. Weather. Who was on what task. I left out the line about hearing my name in my voice because it looks like a joke when you see it on paper. I left out the part where we counted eight pebbles in two rows because I couldn’t write a reason an adult would do that. I left out the smell in the bear box that wasn’t quite meat and wasn’t quite rot because it won’t print.

Since then, nights run different.

Around three—the clock on the stove is wrong, so it might be two-fifty-eight or three-twelve, but it feels like three—it puts weight on the porch boards. Not a knock. Not steps. Just weight. The wood answers. Long. Low. It doesn’t try the knob. It stands and listens to the house list what hurts.

First time, I held my breath and counted. Twenty. Thirty. The boards kept talking. Air still moved in my chest when I stopped pulling it. The part that scared me came later, when I realized I had matched the slow rhythm without meaning to.

I leave the radio on low now. Static between stations. For three nights the static braided into a shape that wasn’t quite a tune and wasn’t wind either. My name sat in it. My voice, after I’d already stopped speaking. I turned the dial and found nothing but the same shape on other numbers.

The bathroom mirror fogs when the heat is off. Five long ovals track down the glass like someone reminding me how to count to a number that matters only to them. In the morning there’s grit under my nails and a thin mineral track under the window where wet air pooled.

Food goes down easier if it’s cold. Coffee too, once the steam is gone. Heat sounds loud now. I know that sentence doesn’t make sense unless you’ve noticed it yourself. When I hold my hand near the kettle, it feels like I’m waving at someone who lives at a distance.

Neighbors’ dog won’t come up my stairs. Hair up, mouth shut. He looks past me at nothing and backs into the truck with his nails skittering on the liner. His owner laughs like it’s a trick the dog learned from YouTube. The laugh stutters on itself for half a second and then snaps back into place. I don’t mention it. People hear what they’re looking for.

I tried packing to move. Books first. Then the box of things from fire seasons that makes you feel like your life fits in a bin: maps, a compass you trust more than your phone, a whistle that means “come to me now” because it’s the only command that matters. Tape came off the roll with that dry sticky sound and turned into a single bent note that lodged behind my nose. I set down the knife and realized I had dragged four parallel scratches into the cardboard. Four. Pause. Four. The same two rows as the pebbles.

The kitchen window is old and wavy. At night it shows the porch like a memory. Sometimes the glass shows height where there isn’t any outside. A hanging-coat shape with shoulders wrong. The inside of the glass fogs. I wipe a circle. For a breath the air tastes like snow. When the fog comes back there are five cold ovals in it. A hint of a sixth where no heel should land. I leave it. In the morning, white drip lines dry along the sill like chalk.

Pipes sing in the walls when the house cools. They always have, but now there’s a single note that holds until I answer it under my breath. It stops when I do. It starts again if I don’t notice fast enough. I tested this three nights in a row. I don’t recommend doing that.

I went back to the station once to sign off a box of Walt’s things for the district to deliver. I thought that was the right thing to do. The cardboard was new. It still had that dust that makes your hands feel like you’re wearing someone else’s skin. I signed what I had to sign. On the way out I looked at the dry board where someone had written NOTES in big letters and underlined it twice. No one had written anything under it. The room felt like it was waiting for someone to set a metronome.

Two rangers drove out with me the next week to pull the cams so they wouldn’t get snowed under. We had to log it. We had to show we’d done the work. We parked at the closure and hiked in on a cold day that didn’t look like weather but was. The fog sat lower than our mouths. The cameras came down easy. The cards went into a Pelican case because that’s what you do with things that have to arrive unchanged.

On the way back we passed the place where the fingertip marks had run out. I didn’t point. The rangers didn’t ask. We all stared at the ground like there was something there to be found and didn’t find it. The trail felt shorter in, longer out. The Pelican case knocked my hip every third step. The cadence synced with my breath even though I tried to make it not.

I sleep worse at home now and somehow wake up with more energy than I should have. I don’t like how that sentence reads. I don’t like saying it out loud. People think you’re bragging when you say you need less sleep. I’m not.

My mouth is dry in the morning like I’ve been talking all night without words. The inside of my cheeks have small raw places where teeth have pressed. I keep biting my tongue gently, checking it’s still there. It is. I know that’s not the part that matters.

Once, around three, I thought I heard the hinge in the bear box. I live a long way from that box. Sound travels stupid in mountains, but it doesn’t travel through memory. I stood up anyway and went to the window. The porch boards had that slight bow I can spot now. Not a person’s bow. Weight more spread out than feet. The porch jittered in the glass like heat coming off a road.

I left the house one night and walked the lane to the stop sign and back to hear how gravel sounds when you aren’t trying to be quiet. It rained a little. The rain made its own timing. I matched it without thinking and stopped when I noticed. I stood still a long time in the drizzle wondering whether stillness is even my decision anymore.

Every once in a while the fridge motor stops and I can hear my own swallow. There’s a hitch in it now. I listen too closely and hear some other swallow answer in the same room, just not in air.

I haven’t seen the river man again. Not standing where people stand. But the few pictures I still have from that spike on my phone—not the cams, the casual pictures—sometimes flicker when I open them. The flicker is small. A change in the grain. I screen-recorded it to see if it would catch. It didn’t. The screen recording plays normal. The phone knows what to ignore.

I leave one light on at night because it makes the rest of the dark pick a side. The bulb hums if I listen. I try not to listen. It’s the only advice I can write down that looks like a thing a person would say. Don’t listen. Keep your hands busy. Keep your mouth empty. Heat your food or don’t; picking is the trap. Drink water. If you hear your name, ignore it, even if it sounds like you. Especially then.

I don’t keep the whistle on a hook anymore. It’s in a drawer. When I opened the drawer last week, the air in there felt cold in a way that hurt my teeth, and the whistle had a film on it like it had been breathed on and left shut.

I went to the lake on a map one day and stared at the contour lines until they blurred. The bowl has a name you can find if you want to walk long enough. I’m not writing it. Maps are only helpful until they aren’t.

You can tell yourself this is stress. You can tell yourself losing someone you shared meals with puts sounds in your head that don’t belong there. Both are true. Both are useful. You can make coffee at midnight and hold the mug with two hands and blow on it like it keeps you in the category you’ve always been in: person, alone, house, inside the weather, not the other way around.

There’s a section of porch rail I keep sanding smooth and it never stays that way. Every week or so it’s rough again in a pattern that looks like an elbow leaned there too long. I haven’t leaned there. I don’t let anyone else onto the porch. The rail remembers anyway.

I changed the screws in the door strike so they bite deeper into the stud. I installed a deadbolt you can turn without a key because you should be able to lock and unlock something without asking permission. These are human solutions and they matter for human problems. They help until they don’t.

I thought about leaving a plate of food once. Cold meat, because that’s what it seems to like. I didn’t. That’s a line I can keep. It’s a small line, but small lines count when the big ones feel like they belong to a different job.

When I get out of bed at night and put my feet on the floor, the boards talk back. They always have. Now they say more than I want to know. The timing the house keeps on its own matches what waits outside. I have stopped standing exactly on the seams.

I still don’t know what to do with the sentence he gave me: you don’t have to be outside anymore. It reads like comfort. It is not. It’s a trade. Outside wears your clothes for a while. Inside learns to wait.

At three, the boards take weight again. No knock. No voice. Just the house answering and the slow count that happens whether I decide to count or not.

It does not ask to be let in.

It waits until my breathing matches.

1ohmujw,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1ohmujw/cold_carry/,Cold Carry.,"We pulled a man out of snowmelt below a slide path in central Idaho. Storm had just come off the ridge and left the creek high, cloudy, and cold enough to sting through rubber. He was in to his waist. Pants in ribbons. No boots. Lips the wrong color. He was trying to walk crosscurrent like the bank existed where he wanted it, not where it was.

We figured he slipped. He hadn’t.

We got him into spike. A meadow with tents knotted together by guyline, a stove that coughed more than it heated, gear laid on tarps to pretend it would dry. He wouldn’t give a name. He sat where we told him and watched the tent wall. He kept saying the same line: it spared me. Same tone every time, like reciting a policy he didn’t write.

We tried food. Jerky first. Then a tin mug of stew. He shoved the crate hard enough to rattle the lantern pole and yelled at the steam, not at us. Said if he ate, the ridge would hear.

Our EMT put a hand on his wrist and counted while the rest of us watched the zipper because watching anything felt better than listening. Pulse fast, steady. Skin cold, chest warm on the cheap thermometer. We blamed the lantern heat for the lack of breath fog. We blamed a lot of things on the lantern.

When the crew hiked to flag a new line, I stayed. Med tent. Lantern turned down. Rain ticking on the mesh like a clock you don’t want to own. The stove snapped once and went quiet.

He talked.

He said he and two friends went up for a high lake that sits in a rock bowl. Three nights. Fishing when the wind let them. Quiet when it didn’t. They sang old songs low the third night because the fire made a circle and quiet made a bigger one outside it.

He said it learned their steps. Who unzipped which tent. Who left to piss and how long it took. Who opened the bear can and how quiet he tried to be. It didn’t rush. It took them when the dark felt thicker than canvas.

Mark went first. They followed a drag through needles to some whitebark and found his call whistle hanging from a twig. When he blew it, the note pulled inward. He tried again and felt the air come back at his face.

Javier went the next night. He swore he heard humming while it carried him across broken rock. Not Javier’s tune. The notes backward on purpose.

By morning he was alone. No insects, no birds. The lake lay flat like metal. He said even the small ripples near shore looked printed there, not moving with the rest.

He ran. Cut his hands on talus. Sliced a knee open bad enough he could see white and wrapped it in a shirt. Drank snowmelt until his stomach cramped.

He stuffed tissue in his ears and still felt a thought push at him from the back of his mouth: stop moving, kneel, let the cold finish it.

I changed the screws in the door strike so they bite deeper into the stud. I installed a deadbolt you can turn without a key because you should be able to lock and unlock something without asking permission. These are human solutions and they matter for human problems. They help until they don’t.

I thought about leaving a plate of food once. Cold meat, because that’s what it seems to like. I didn’t. That’s a line I can keep. It’s a small line, but small lines count when the big ones feel like they belong to a different job.

When I get out of bed at night and put my feet on the floor, the boards talk back. They always have. Now they say more than I want to know. The timing the house keeps on its own matches what waits outside. I have stopped standing exactly on the seams.

I still don’t know what to do with the sentence he gave me: you don’t have to be outside anymore. It reads like comfort. It is not. It’s a trade. Outside wears your clothes for a while. Inside learns to wait.

At three, the boards take weight again. No knock. No voice. Just the house answering and the slow count that happens whether I decide to count or not.

It does not ask to be let in.

It waits until my breathing matches.

1ohmrnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1ohmrnn/we_havent_met_since_we_finally_kissed/,We haven’t met since we finally kissed?,"So I (28F) started hanging out with a guy (34M) I met through mutual friends about 6 weeks ago. We had an amazing connection, but kept it friendly (except some flirting) all 6 times we met, my attraction grew for him during this time.  It was about a 50/50 split in terms of initiating plans, maybe slightly more from my side.

Then at the end of the 6th meeting he kissed me, and I was glad we waited that long. It was cute and natural and he said how happy he was.

One thing I noticed is he doesnt seem to be a planner, at all.  He asked me to meet last minute a few days after we kissed, but it didn’t work out from his side and then I got sick. Then both of us were very busy the next 5 days (although I would have been up to fit in even a brief coffee since he was going away) before he had to go on a week long work trip that he just returned from a few days ago.

Nothing is in the diary. Yet he enthusiastically texts me not every, but probably most days. I don’t want to be the one to initiate right now, as I’m trying to understand if he’s interested or not. He talks like he is, our connection is wonderful, but without the action of seeing eachother in person I’m left uncertain and tbh quite anxious since we haven’t met since we kissed now 3 weeks ago.

Back around 2008-2012, I bought this little figure that came inside a fizzy egg kind of toy, I had to ask my mother to go grab a coffee so I could ask for a glass of water, It was in Brazil but I doubt it was a national thing. It was a blind box you could get either a pirate, robot, or ninja figure. It is very round and the head pops off and you can put a small trinket inside, no idea why did they do that though.

Some years ago, maybe five or more, I came across a really old English written post about someone that had pulled out a robot and was seaching for the name of the toy like me. They never answered my reply and I ended up forgetting about it.

Any help is appreciated.

""Running Up That Hill"" is not one of those songs, yet because of the Stranger Things connection is a popular addition.  Which is why I present:

#Songs of for a Kate Bush Halloween Playlist

**The Obvious Ones**

- Hammer Horror (I put this on a Halloween playlist - we called them mix tapes back then - even before The Dreaming came out)
- Get Out My House
- Waking the Witch (I was happy to see this was a pretty popular one when I googled ""Halloween Playlist"" and ""Kate Bush"")

**Ones Involving Ghosts, etc.**

- Wuthering Heights
- The Man With The Child In His Eyes
- Watching You Without Me
- Snowed In At Wheeler Street

**The Ones Involving Death And Destruction**

- The Kick Inside
- Coffee Homeground
- The Wedding List
- Army Dreamers
- Breathing
- Pull Out The Pin
- Experiment IV

I know ""Blow Away"" and ""Moments of Pleasure"" involve death but not a Halloween-type death so they don't work.

**Misc. That Have A Halloween Feel**

- Babooshka (Yeah, I know, but this was on a few Halloween playlists I found.  Obviously someone out there thinks it fits)
- Running Up That Hill (see opening paragraph)
- Rocket's Tail
- Mother Stands for Comfort

This is NOT meant to be an exclusive list.  If you can think of any other Kate songs that fit, please mention them in the comments!

Just curious if anyone has experimented and seen it helps at all. I have a child with tics and have heard coffee can help calm the mind for them (I know it makes me calm and sleepy)  but worried how if at all it will affect tics .

Edit to add

I drank coffee from kinder and up. So the age thing to me sounds like a cultural expectation. My elders gave me to drink coffee with milk and a little sugar each morning. 

There is more caffeine in soda and other drinks given to kids. We literally just drink water and milk at our house. 

Only kept back the coffee because I didn’t really get around to it and then years later I have 0 experience with tics and heard it may trigger more so hope that helps people see where I’m coming from. I don’t think a cup of coffee is bad for kids but I choice not to give it for above concerns. I also don’t do juices or any soft drinks at all as a rule. Juice is a special rare treat at my house.

But during those ten minutes, I noticed something that most others don't - in the way you talk, the way you hold yourself, and the general demeanor that you put forth. It's no surprise that many others don't pick up on it - you're *very* good at hiding what's inside. But to a trained eye and ear like my own, you couldn't be more clear about what you crave.

See, you're the type of woman most wouldn't suspect - you're fierce, stubborn, determined, liberal - and you quickly rose to a prominent leadership position at your own company. You're often the one giving orders at work or making the decisions when you're with friends and family, and you're the go-to party planner in your circle - it seems you have a desire for control and organization that simply cannot be matched.

But in those ten minutes, I knew that couldn't be more wrong.

Maybe it's my personality or my charm, possibly my confidence or abrasiveness, but while chatting with you, I didn't see that confident, stubborn, feminist that everybody says you are - I saw a woman who had trouble making eye contact with me, who couldn't help but giggle somewhat nervously, who clearly yearned and craved for something more, something different - far different from her every day life.

When we parted that night, I made a decision about your future - that you're going to be my submissive, obedient, free-use slut.

Later that week, I managed to snag your phone number from my coworker. And when I texted you, it didn't surprise me that you didn't seem to question how I got your number - instead, it seemed like you were expecting it, craving it. You couldn't be obvious about it, though - you had this feminist facade you had to keep, after all. But I knew where we were heading - I made that decision *long* ago.

So when I called and asked you to meet up for coffee at a shop near my place to discuss a business opportunity, I knew you would gladly accept. And when I told you to wear something flattering, I got the snarky response I expected - with a tone of playfulness to it, of course.

It's now around six in the evening and I'm sitting in the coffee shop wearing my favorite suit - a navy blue one with a white, button-up, long-sleeve shirt, and a blood-red tie and brown leather shoes to complete the look. The suit is tailored to fit my muscular, 6'1"" frame and broad muscles, just tight enough to show a hint of the muscles underneath. My large hand slides through my short, soft, brown hair as my blue eyes scan the scenery in front of me. I slide my hand to my rugged jaw, feeling the beginnings of a five o'clock shadow starting to form.

I open up the newspaper in front of me and take a look at the business section while I take a sip of my favorite coffee - a Caribbean blend. Served black, of course.

Day after surgery, I was on all liquids.  Then came the fun:

Breakfast - chosen for me.  Scrambled eggs, sausage, blueberry muffin, oatmeal with butter & sugar, fruit cup, coffee, juice.  8/10.  Way too much food!  I ate the fruit, the oatmeal and 1/2 the eggs and sausage.  Was so sad to waste the muffin, as it was house baked and smelled delicious.

Lunch - Lentil ""Shepherd's Pie,"" dinner roll, cooked cinnamon apples, hot tea. Yeah, yeah, 10/10.  The pie, rather potage, was so full of veggies and tasted so rich.  The mashed potatoes were real, with lumps and all!  The apples were surprising, as I normally don't care for them.  The tea was *hot* and washed everything down well.

Supper - baked fish with rice and green beans. Peach and blueberry crumble, hot tea.  8/10.  The rice wasn't seasoned, so was a bit bland.  The fish was overcooked, but okay.  The lemon and dill made up in taste what was lacking in texture.  The beans were really good.  The crumble, though...10/10 for that.  I would have inhaled that if it were possible; so good!

I love my subject and also like to delve in philosophy. Absurdism sounds good to me currently and would love to explore it more alongwith other thoughts. RPG games are my type but  I barely get any time to play. Festivals have got me feeling pretty lonely and reminds me of the emptiness I feel all the time. Not on good terms with my family and a messed up upbringing had left me with clinical anxiety and deep sense of loneliness and melancholy. Still I try to do my best everyday to live and love. ""Should I kill myself or drink a cup of coffee?"" 😂. I would love to share that love with someone. Mutual respect and communication are a rare sight. I'd love to talk to someone who has an idea about how to be respectful and communicate effectively. We may not understanding each other perfectly at all the times, that's okay, as long as we are respectful and care for each other. So yeah, that's it ig, hoping to connect and see where it goes . ｡⁠◕⁠‿⁠◕⁠｡
Take care! You're precious!

Stringing me with your chosen words? Three sixty-five for me to ask is what it took

Did it mean anything for you? If not, I’ll set it aside on the corner of my coffee nook

Truth be told, this is not a demand or an ultimatum

For in life, this is what most people refer to as the “bare-minimum”

In a repeating motion, back and forth like a silent pendulum

In literary form, deprived of any insight into oneself or without speculum

Trapped in a box and just acted out a scene, like a performer who only does mime

Three sixty-five without even a phone call and when I asked, it felt as if I had committed a crime

For so long it felt like I was just given scraps from someone else’s cash and dime

1ohmbwo,https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongo/comments/1ohmbwo/pokémon_go_a_quantitative_approach_updated/,"Pokémon GO: A Quantitative Approach updated, hardback now available","A few months ago, I posted a preview of my book [Pokémon GO: A Quantitative Approach](https://goldandappelpub.com/pgo-quantitative.html). I got lots of feedback both positive and negative; both were appreciated, and I believe I've acted on all objections raised. I've just released version 1.0.1, fully up to date with recent releveling, all move updates for Season 24, and all Pokémon released during *Tales of Transformation*. I've further augmented the text with details regarding regional forms, higher resolution images, more graphs, more tables, anticipated Mega forms from Z-A, Adventure Effects, Party Power, Timed Incubators, Gold and Silver Bottle Caps, Lucky Trinkets, lists of fastest attack cycles, lists of most powerful attack cycles, lists by bulk for each League, and dozens of minor corrections. Several community members directly contributed fixes; I'd especially like to thank M-Alshamsi for his expert contributions improving math layout.

Additionally, almost all tables are now programmatically generated from a single database, facilitating automatic updates on game changes and unit testing.

The book covers the entire game's mechanics, including grinding for XP, Stardust, items, Energies, and  Pokémon, the world and timeline of PGO, friends, gifts, routes, buddies, parties, Team GO Rocket, mechanics of spawning and catching, probabilities of Shiny Pokémon, type relations, fast and charged attacks, TMs, form changes and evolution, Shadows and purification, trading, effectively searching, battle mechanics for PvP, raids, and Max Battles, tactics, team selection, and even simulation. Presentation always emphasizes axioms and the mathematical buildup of theory. Go beyond checking websites for ""the meta"" and blindly ordering IVs; PGO: AQA gives you the tools necessary to build winning teams no matter the changes to attack stats and availability. Stop asking the same dumb questions over and over.

I'm confident that even the most experienced PGO player will learn something from this book.

The PDF is (and always will be) completely free. For the first time, a printed edition is available for purchase. I contracted a local printer with whom I've worked before, and they're churning out beautiful full-color hardbacks. I expect the vast majority of people to use the free electronic version, but if you'd like an attractive artifact (and to support my work), please do purchase a copy. If you buy before 2025-11-10, I'll even cover shipping! I've only ordered 100 copies, so get yours quick.

Thanks to everyone who supported this endeavor, and/or supports it going forward!

Some FAQs to head off questions:

\* Q: Doesn't the game change too rapidly to be summarized in a printed book? A: It certainly does if one is merely providing lists of ""best"" Pokémon etc. The theory behind team selection and mechanics is pretty timeless, though, and that's what's emphasized here. Honestly, though, the PDF is kept fully up to date with shifting details, and is better for searching; the book is something you can read in bed, or keep on a coffee table.

\* Q: Why is the price ($60) so high? A: Color printing and hardback binding is not cheap, and I do not expect to sell very many copies. The PDF is not only free, it's [open source](https://github.com/dirty-south-supercomputing/technicalreports/tree/master/006-pgo)!

\* Q: What did you use to make this? A: [LuaTeX](https://www.luatex.org/), [GNU GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/), and about 30 small C++ programs, all on a Debian Linux workstation. Also about 200 hours.

\* Q: Who are you? A: nick black aka u/sosodank aka americanpion. I started playing March of this year (2025), and found the existing documentation lacking. I set out to document the game completely in one place, with a focus on the PvP element.

I wanted to write a story about overcoming these traumas, and I hope I succeeded.



We dove from the cave mouth into blackened waters. Moonlight wafted in like shafts of silver as we swam through those cold shores. Despite the chill, my body was invigorated. I felt more powerful than I’d ever had before, and Damien beside me swam like he was born for it. His body turned and flowed with the rhythm of the sea lions and Kelp that surrounded us. I hurried to keep his pace as he gracefully swept onwards to the edges of the shallows. I gasped for air, breaking the tension of that water, fighting the salt filling my lungs. Heaving, I let myself float at the surface, water lapped at my sides as I gazed at those constellations above. Andromeda hanging above me like a wisp in the night. 

Splashing “Hey there, you doing alright?” 

“I’m just catching my breath” I replied.

“You don’t need that anymore” Damien replied, I felt his arm gently pushing me downward, orienting me to face him, “You can breathe in the water now” 

We plunged downward, skirting rocks and Kelp as we went. I found more speed than I had ever known in the kicking of my legs as we swam along. I ran out of breath, but I tried to inhale anyway. Coldness crept along my neck, deep into my chest. I found myself sinking, suddenly adjusting my course as my buoyancy faded away. “I’m doing it!” I almost exclaimed, only for bubbles to emerge from my lips.

We passed coral in so many colors, illuminated by moonlight, little crabs and leopard sharks shyly dashed away from our pursuit. I looked ahead to see Damien, determined, his feet kicking with a strength I could not match, turning to watch me as I caught up with him. He took my hand and turned back into that darkness, pulling me with him as we continued onwards. 
Under us, I could see the rocks forming strange geometric patterns, like the stones of Machu Picchu, each intricately carved and arranged to fit together so precisely. A road under the water, carved from seastone, guiding our path towards that destination. 
That awful fate I was gleefully swimming towards.

A dropoff emerged, blackness engulfed any fantasies awakened in my desperate mind. An icy current swept around me, filling me with that chill of the unknown. The ocean floor descended away from us, and I knew we must go down. 

Damien stopped and turned to me. I faced him, those dark eyes I gazed into so many times, so many romantic nights and sleepy mornings. I saw light sparkle behind them, like the rays of a Sunday morning, with nothing to do and nowhere to go, under sheets of cheap cotton, and the smell of burnt coffee on the stove. But it wasn’t sunlight, his skin was glistening. And as I watched, chromatophores erupted around those darkened eyes, his skin radiating with a fractal rhythm that left me mesmerized. As I watched, I understood, his thoughts beamed directly into my mind, this was his language. The language of the sea, and for the first time, I understood him. We have to go down now Jack, follow close.

We descended into that deep blackness, following the road as we passed rocks, coral and kelp. Small crabs and elegant anemones darted shyly away at our approach, and the waters held me like a gentle hug. I noticed the pressure didn’t seem to affect me as my body was saturated with that ocean water, it felt like air, like I was flying rather than swimming, to whatever doom or tragedy awaited me. I wonder how much further it is, I thought to myself as we steadily made our way.

Damien turned again, over his shoulder. It's still a ways away, the Temple is up ahead.

Can you hear my thoughts? I thought

Yes, we all can, it’s how we communicate down here. I can use my skin, but initiates only have their minds. 

Will your uncle be able to hear me too?

Yes Jack, that’s going to be our only advantage.

We were approaching the bottom of that deep ravine, and gentle lights emerged from the depths up ahead. They were foggy at first, just a soft glowing of blue and green, but as we drew closer I could see the light was coming from ornately decorated lamps of bioluminescent coral. They were shaped almost as though carved, in strange structures that could not have been naturally formed. They must have grown them like bonsai trees.

A great looming monolith was emerging up ahead. It was dark in those cold waters, like the flat head of a massive leviathan. I was horrified by that presence, a fear took hold deep in my chest, like needles scraping across my ribs back and forth. Damien seemed to notice, as he pulled me to the side, off of the road into a dark crevice formed by the seastone and coral lining our path.

Jack, this is important. The only way we can win is if I challenge him directly. It’s called (Untranslatable) and our law decrees that a representative from the land must be there as witness. You are my witness, and he is not going to like that. He’ll be bound to complete the duel, and he shouldn’t be allowed to touch you, but he may attack you mentally.

What do you mean?

My uncle is very skilled with psychic manipulation. He can force his way into your mind, and he’s probably going to.

Probably?

You aren’t allowed to take part in the duel, but you also don’t have the psychic experience of a Deep One, that means you can distract him, by thinking. They won't count it as interference.

You mean… like what? I should just think really hard at him?

Exactly, think about numbers, songs, memes on the internet, anything. Just keep it random, and think as loud as you can. I know how it sounds, but if you do it enough you can distract him, that’s how I’ll catch him off guard.
He swam closer to me, This isn’t your fight Jack, I know you’re part of this, but I need to be the one to kill him. It’s my duty to my people.

Uncertainty rippled its way through my body, Okay. Let's go.

He pulled me from the crevice into the shadow of that monolithic structure. As we swam closer I could see its complexity in more detail, whirling shapes converging across its surface, strange to the eye, natural looking, but unlike any stones or plants I had ever seen before. We moved upwards to its peak, which was ringed by those strange bioluminescent lamps, and a simple stone altar at its center. I could see that this structure continued onwards, past the circle of lights, forming an intricate, raised road leading towards a large cave in a hillside off in the distance. As we approached I saw the shapes of Deep Ones darting around its entrance. Flickering conversations from that chromatophore skin. Big, dark eyes turning to face me as we passed. They looked nothing like Damien, these people were naked, their heads were bald, and their eyes bulged from soft skin, fins fanning from the cheekbones of their faces. One took a bite of a fish as we passed, and I saw that their teeth were razor sharp, perfect for tearing flesh from bone under the water. Their limbs seemed long, much longer than mine, and their fingers had webbing. Their feet were flattened, like paddles on a diver, and a sail of fin emerged from their backs, flexing and folding as they twisted in the water. Sails sharp like spines, delicate, like the tissue of a bat’s wing between its clawlike fingers. 

A Deep One approached us, a long and elegant spear in his hand, flickering the fins around his face towards Damien, what is your business here (Untranslatable)?

I am here to see my uncle, (Untranslatable). 

The King is not taking audiences at this time.

He will for me. Damien reached into his jacket pocket, and pulled a small token from it. A small hand mirror, it looked old, tarnished silver. An antique of some kind, possibly Victorian. The trinket was strangely familiar, like a memory I didn’t know I had. It was powerful, sentimental, I felt the weight of loss and heartbreak emanating from its surface. The Deep One he was talking to glanced at me, some unreadable expression on his face, before moving to the side allowing us to pass.

Damien pulled me into the mouth of the cave. We passed huge, carved whalebones that loomed over us like we were entering the belly of a beast, before the cave opened up, moonlight peering in through an oculus in the ceiling. The walls of this cave were smooth, and painted with extremely detailed murals of dozens of massive shapes. Each was covered in those strange fractal patterns, with long tendrils forming unusual symmetries along their vertical axis. It took me a long moment of absorbing those shapes before they formed into bodies, and I realized I was looking at figures, dozens of figures. Each seated on thrones of waves, each posed in different positions. They looked ancient, and the styles of their renderings reminded me of the ancient arts from Mayan, Hindu, African, and Pacific Islanders. They were simultaneously elegant and simple while unimaginably complex, and I was so fascinated that I could have stared for hours, if it wasn’t for the oppressing shadow at the end of the room. Damien was swimming forward with determination, into the center where that beam of light struck his forehead from the oculus above. He grasped the hand mirror as his skin lit up with those undulating patterns, powerfully declaring I know what you did, Uncle, I challenge you to (Untranslatable).

From the depths, a deep thrumming resonated. It was rhythmic, and powerful, sending pulses of current through me like I was inside a great beast that was laughing. Powerful lights erupted like green embers in a fire pit. They flashed rapidly and electric, illuminating with rapid bursts a form so much larger than I had anticipated. All at once his message was spoken: I always knew you had a traitor's heart, just like your father.

Fight me then, in the old way you love so much. This ends tonight, one way or another.

No lights came from those shadows, instead, a set of ruthless jaws, large as my whole body emerged into that shaft of white moonlight, grinning, followed by eyes bulging from their sockets. Huge fins followed behind as his whole head was illuminated, and it just kept creeping forward. Slowly, that head drew closer to Damien, that sickening grin widening at the approach, with seemingly no body attached. He relished in the anticipation he built as he leered down at Damien, who suddenly seemed so small in comparison, stopping only a foot's distance away. I recoiled as that mouth opened wide, his jaw hinging like a snake's unfathomably far, and I panicked in the water when I saw Damien floating there stone cold and expressionless. Like a bolt of lightning, a message flared outwards from deep in that throat, pulsing down that massive tongue and illuminating rows of teeth like daggers. I accept.

I was knocked back by the full force of a current churned by his massive body as he rapidly snaked past us and out of the cave. I only had a moment to catch his shape as it disappeared into the tunnel behind us, his neck was long, like an enormous snake. A huge torso and legs followed after, arms like tree branches and legs like the tails of sharks. I tumbled in the water, disoriented as the current pulled me from the cave, but Damien caught me before my fumbling body was lost into the abyss.

Are you alright?

That… thing, is your uncle?

Yes, and it’ll be me soon if we win. Do you understand?

I do.

Good, just stick to the plan, don’t fall for his tricks. That’s what they are, just tricks. 
Remember that.

Damien?

Yes?

How can I silence myself? If I don’t want him to hear me?

Observations, just observe. Nobody listens to that.

Okay.

You’ll be okay Jack, I promise, we’re going to fix this.

Deep Ones were gathering around us, flashing anxiety and concern amongst each other as we raced down that road back towards the plateau we had passed earlier. The form of the king was only a shadow in the distance growing larger as we charged forward. I caught movement from the corner of my eye as Damien tugged me along by my upper arm, only a hand disappearing behind a rock, but I had no time to question it as we were rapidly approaching that ring of illuminated coral, and that altar in the center. Across that circle, his uncle rose into his full form. A giant of a man, with fins like a shark framing the sides of his body, arms outstretched with palms upward, curled into harsh claws. His body was as large as an Orca, his face grinning with malice, as he swept it long around the outer edge. His neck is long enough to span the whole arena, I thought with a shudder. 

Tonight, He shall dine on King’s blood! He declared, My traitor of a nephew has challenged me to (Untranslatable). May his blood nourish our great master.

Damien was handed a long spear, its tip was three pronged, and each point wove its way around the shaft like twisting snakes. It looked to be made of some strange alloy I had never seen before, yellow and slightly green, with a luster that was almost mirror-like. I was pushed to follow him into the circle and fear ran cold through my body as I realized that this was their way. I had to witness the duel at its heart. I had to stand at the altar. 

Damien and his Uncle circled the ring. Their skin lighting up with rage, violence, and destruction. Duty and vengeance was undulating in waves all over Damien's face, while Power and honor struck like lighting across the Kings. And then he charged. 

Those jaws flashed wide and fast over my head, cracking like a whip on nothing as Damien twisted away, his spear darting like a needle in the water towards that neck, only grazing three scales off its shaft. The king roiled around, snapping at his legs, as Damien turned in the water to face him again, kicking with all the ferocity of a shark breaching the surface. The king twisted, lunging again, but Damien vaulted over his head, straddling his neck for another blow. Thunderous sounds crept closer behind me, and I turned just in time to dart away from the torso of that massive creature as it clawed over the altar. I could see with clear detail the outlines of each muscle in those thick and engorged arms, ribs built with chevrons sliding over stone like a snake over a treebranch. I turned back to watch them and was caught dead-on staring into that roiling surface of the king's face. You are nothing! You bring blasphemy upon our waters! Weakness, just like your father. My mind started racing, and the fisher king turned to me. I have to think of numbers, songs, memes. Noise music from those random shows I wound up at in the city. The King seemed to hesitate for just a moment, so I thought harder. Noise, loud, chaotic, screeching noise, it was working. The sound of subway brakes on a hot day in Manhattan, fire alarms, V8 engines firing up. Motorcycles. 

The king turned away, darting through the water like a Tiger Shark, he twisted his neck around Damien’s waist, cinching it tight to hold him there. But just as the trap was set, Damien wriggled free, clawing up his neck like he was climbing a tree branch and poising the spear for a strike. Damien’s spear flashed forward, right into the eye of the beast. He twisted away, wrenching it out of Damien’s hand. Blood flowing in small clouds from the wound under his webbed fingers. The king wailed with a thunderous roar that rattled through my body, before he turned to me with malice on his face.

I was rendered dumbstruck, arms limp at my sides as images flashed before me, thoughts taking shape deep inside my mind. Betrayal, genocide, rape and murder. Torture, pain, guilt, shame, endless waves upon waves of grief swept through my body. It hurt, it hurt deep in my stomach, like the pangs you get when your home is wrenched away from you, the pain of a lover’s abandonment. My shoulders tensed up as my numb hands gripped my skull, trying so hard to look away, but those thoughts kept coming. They turned into rage. The fury of torturing those who wronged you, watching their blood boil into steam in front of you, plucking them one fingernail at a time, until there’s nothing left. Nothing left to blame. 

A cloud of red gently wisped its way in front of my eyes, blood. My blood, was I bleeding? 

You think you’re so special don’t you? Words flooded me with the force of a tsunami. You are weak, degenerate, your blood is full of filth and rot. I can smell it. 

My head ached, I felt so tired, so frustrated, so angry. I twisted that rage into vengeance. Maybe you’re having a stroke, old man. 

The king swept a behemoth arm, swatting Damien like a fly. He spun away into the water, and for a brief moment I was defenseless as that goliath turned to me with thousands of eyes sinking into view across that endless pattern of skin. You are slave to fetish desires, you crave flesh, control of flesh, consuming flesh. You are selfish deep in the bowels of your soul, you know nothing of true transcendence, yet you peddle it like a whore. He spoke and his words rang with thousands of memories. My memories. Cigarettes in the rain, after a night with a stranger. My old apartment, cold and empty. Damien’s rage, my surgery scars, the crack in the ceiling over the mattress I called a bed. A roach on my computer screen, fat as my thumb, interrupting a brief escape from short lifetimes of corrupting loneliness. 

Damien was back, darting through the water behind the king as he tortured me with his mind. I saw him poised for a charge, but the King twisted and grabbed Damien by the leg, slamming him hard into the stone. He pushed Damien down into that rock with all of his weight as he leered back at me. Forcing images through my mind, I could feel the scraping of talons on the inside of my skull. I could feel the pillow pressing into my head, the eyes on that face I would not name, the razor’s rake across my arms. I could feel the way I bashed my skull into the subway walls, alone, at midnight, on a Tuesday. 

My body seized, I spasmed in the water, choking on the horror of that man, that creature from my past. 

You speak of freedom, of change, like it’s noble, but all I see is mutation, dilution, decay. I am the blood of the deep, unbroken since the dawn. You? You are just a miserable pile of denial and delusions. You think you can be something you’re not, vanity, corruption. You think you can change? You think you can defy your most basic nature?

If it was my nature, then why did I kill myself? Why did I jump from that window? Why did I walk into traffic? We can always change Who we are but never What we are. I came to terms with that years ago. Did you?

The king sneered, releasing Damien from the stone. Damien emerged, and lunged for him again, that spear digging into his neck. A wound the King didn’t even feel as he craned that massive face closer towards me, sneering and flashing those electric shapes into my eyes. I felt dazed but unamused, the longer I looked the more it reminded me of that techno rave on Ketamine with my friends.

You may fight against your nature but you will only know suffering, a suffering you cannot imagine. A suffering unholy and eternal, it will corrupt you, it will destroy you. Everything you thought you were will turn to ashes in your mouth. And you will watch it happen, every aching second of that decay, as it infects you down into the core of your being. Then he was bombarding me with all of his rawest emotion. Anger, so much anger. Rage, hot and electric, it sent energy coursing through my muscles, like a fever had taken over me. Under it was power, self righteousness of the most infectious kind. A belief so strong that the King was correct, he was the only true follower to Dagon, only he knew his teachings, his hunger, the most intimately. That hunger, that endless, starvation that the Deep Ones all knew. Starvation that I knew, most intimately. I had felt that anger before, that loss, that deep sense of self righteous fury. I had bashed my head against walls alone in a subway, so lost to the world and consumed by that anger, with no object to release it upon. Starvation, starvation for safety, for belonging, starvation so ravenous I would do anything, consume anyone, to satisfy it with no avail. I was familiar with all of this, so I looked deeper. I peered under the surface into that mind.

Grief. Horrible, putrid, festering grief. Oceans deep and endless, salty and barren of life. Emptiness. Like the shores of the dead sea, where even corpses don’t rot, but dessicate into nothing but dust on waters too sick to drown in. That was a grief I knew all too well. Suffering, just endless relentless suffering. 

You once believed in freedom. Is this what she would want?

The king bellowed, laughing in the water. You are too weak, too naive to know, child. You do not know suffering, so let me show you.

Then those talons raked along the inside of my skull again. My vision went dark, as fear rippled through me, within me, like ice crystals forming around my heart. The world was gone, and I floated there naked, every muscle aching with pain. The man, the man I won’t name stood there approaching me, and he was angry. I panicked, thinking I could run, but that will to escape dissipated like fog on a mirror. I could not leave, I could not run. I had no choice but to obey him. I had no choice but to submit to him. I felt that familiar numbness flooding my bones, as those hands grasped me by the arms. I felt that hollowness again, that endless emptiness consuming me once again. I could do nothing to stop him, this was going to happen. All I could do was satisfy him, as best I can, and try to pull myself together for the next time he wants me. I had to suffer, I had to comply, I had to destroy myself to satiate this man, this monster, who I called a lover.

And then, the mirage changed.

His face rippled like the reflection of a babbling brook, a man stood before me, his eyes were soft and full of love. His touch was gentle and leading. He smelled like lavender, and his face looked like Damien, He couldn't understand you. But I can, I know that freedom you seek, and I can give it to you.

In my hand, there was a mirror. An ornate, silver mirror, Victorian I think. I looked into its reflection, and there was the sweetest smile, framed with elegant curves of spun gold. Crystalline eyes lidded with beautiful long lashes, lips pink and flush with a cupid's bow so perfect. It was her, it was the one. I was the one. 

I looked back at that man, Damien but different-older, wiser, kinder. Someone who understood lifetimes lost. Who knew true monstrosity inside and out. I could rule. I could stand beside him, a queen so great and terrible as to make the sea quake in love and fear of me-my power and my beauty. 

His thoughts gripped me like chains, deep inside my ribs into that part of me that declared who I was. They raked across my bones with a soreness I knew all too well. That soreness in my feet from uncomfortable shoes, that soreness in my chest from flattening my breasts too tight. My hand clenched on the mirror. Fire raced through my veins as I shattered it between white knuckles, No!

The pieces drifted down slowly, each reflecting a fragment of the real me. Every messy, flawed, lumpy part of me. My scars, my hair, my tattoos, my piercings. Jack, short for nothing. Only Jackie for Cat, and family. 

I'm not her, I declared, raising my head to meet him. She's gone

His face rippled before me, rage burning behind those eyes. His features assembled into a shape I cannot stand. A shape I cower in front of. Something I can never bravely stand to face. His energy rippled with the memories of what he thought of me, what I was supposed to be for him. And he grabbed me tight. Wrenching my clothes from my body, forcing me down into that position. 

I stopped existing. My mind reacting to something I could never handle. I was nothing, and I was everything, and nothing mattered anymore. I was the current in the water, the algae on the rocks, the fish in their schools. Jack no longer existed, all that was left was an idea, an idea of life, an idea of existence, so removed, so beyond. My body was numb, my mind was empty, and Jack was gone, in his place, there was just a body. A body I could see hovering dead in the water before me.

I could still see the face I would not name as he abused me, but I had stopped caring. That was just a body, that was just history, a story. I saw the face of Damien’s uncle and understood. Loneliness, grief, pain turned into rage, and I felt sympathy. Nothing matters anymore when you become nothing, but everything matters all of a sudden when you become everything. I was the King, and I felt his loss, his pain. It was mine, I experienced it, just as intimately as the rain on my eyelashes.

Is this what Eleanor wanted, William? I asked, with a child’s voice, curious and worried. Wishing for people to stop hurting. Would this have made her happy?

A bellow ripped through the waters as his face emptied of all its shapes. He swung around, whipping Damien away with an arm before he raised his right hand high above his head. My arm raised too, where it floated in front of me. When I became nothing, I also became him, and he had become me. That arm swung through the water with the force of a century of pain following with it, and all I could do was accept it, as my body did the same with every ounce of that ferocity before me. 

And then I got slammed.

I felt my skull rock with the force of that blow, not from the left but from the right. All at once I had been knocked to the side by something soft. The blow from the king never met my skin, all that was there were hands. Hands that I’d recognized.

I found my balance in the fog of my vision as I saw that it was Alex. He was shirtless, splayed across the altar, with a massive gash cut across his back. Shoulder to hip, the claw of the king had sliced him open, his blood poured out of him in thick clouds, coating the altar and thrumming through the water. 

A rumbling started in the earth.

Dry Blood, Dry Blood, Dry Blood.

The Deep Ones around me were all thinking it, with increasing levels of panic as that rumbling began to shake the silt from the floor. I rushed to Alex and tried to wake him, pressing my fingers to his neck only to find three deeply cut gashes on either side, healed over with the waters of that spring. He was out cold, with eyes open, limp in my arms. 

HE IS AWAKENING! Cried the King, rising to his complete height, HE IS HERE TO EXACT VENGEANCE UPON OUR TRAITORS!

I gazed up in horror as the quaking earth beneath my feet churned and rumbled, silt giving way to massive scales underneath. Scales that looked like stone, twisting and writhing above muscles too massive to determine. All at once the floor dropped away from us, and we floated there in utter stillness. All was silent in the darkness of that night, as we waited for the answer to what was happening.

I looked around to the Deep Ones surrounding us, a perfect circle, all flickering with fear, anticipation, and resolve. They were holding their breath, just as I was, with Alex dying in my arms. I looked to the King where he stood. Damien floated not far away, spear limp in his arm, as his head shot back and forth between me and his uncle, not sure what to do.

Then it happened. Jaws from the deep. Teeth the size of buildings, open so wide I couldn’t even see their depths. They approached so fast there was no hope to react, and they slammed hard around the body of the King, echoing a crack so loud I felt it rattle my joints in their sockets. The King was dead, just like that. Not by Damien, rage or vengeance, but by a bigger fish. 

In an instant, the Deep Ones mobilized. A song rang out like the cries of a widow mixed with the moans of great whales as they rushed forward in huge schools towards that face. A face so big it was lost to the depths before I could see its entirety. My eyes darted around, trying to comprehend what had happened as dozens of Deep Ones produced knives from their bags, slicing them across their own necks and bleeding in thick clouds into the waters. That sonorous cry echoing with thousands of voices, gutteral, moaning. Desperate. The jaws opened again, swallowing a crowd of bleeding people in one gulp, like a whale feeds on Krill. I could feel the current picking up with the vacuum that mouth was making. 

Alex was wrenched away from me. A Deep One had grabbed him, I tried to fight back but I was taken by the shoulders and dragged after him by another. We dove deep into the water, racing so hard I could feel my skin pulling on my face with the intensity of the current. They brought us behind a large rock, and Damien quickly appeared next to me.
You have to go, now! He’s woken up.


Who?


Dagon — It’s happening. I’m turning into him. Damien gripped his head as the water around him seemed to writhe. His muscles spasmed and elongated, the shape of him rearranging. His neck stretched; old teeth loosened and floated away, shoved aside by new, razor replacements. He shivered as the first spurt died down, then turned to me with raw, open panic. Jack — I don’t want to be a monster.
Then don’t, I said, steadying his face in my hands. His eyes bulged; cheekbones rumbled under my palms as needle-fine spines pricked my fingers and fins unfurled along his shoulders. Don’t be monstrous. Be you.
Argh — fuck, yeah, you’re right. He twisted, shoulders bunching while new muscle knotted at the base of his throat and pushed his head forward. Hair floated free from his scalp; gills seamed open in his neck. His skin rippled with colors so bright they glowed. Behind us, the Deep Ones shifted like a tide. Let them take you, Jack. I trust them.
What are you going to do?

His hands pulled away, his eyes glowed silver as they gazed deep into my soul. Flashing lights flickered around them like rings of white flames, a thousand eyes dark and peering within endless spirals of inferno. I understood. 

We raced back to the shore, Alex was out but alive in the arms of the other Deep One as I was dragged along by his panicked friend. They didn’t speak to us, only anxiety brimmed along the surface of that undulating skin. When the water was chest deep, they left me to carry Alex back to shore, as the sky was just starting to brighten in the early hours of the dawn. His body grew heavier as the water swept away, and my shaking arms struggled to support his weight. After a few steps I gave in, sweeping my arm between his legs and heaving him over my shoulders to make the trek inside the sea cave. 

His wound healed rapidly with the help of the spring water, I held him on my knees as I poured it over his wound. Those slices on his neck tightened as his skin started to dry around them. We laid there in silence for hours. As Alex came to, I found myself gripping him tighter, holding him close to my body like he would disintegrate if I let go. Finally he spoke, but he started coughing, a river of water spluttered out of him and I had to thump his back to get him to compose himself, 

“Wha- What happened?” He asked, hoarsely.

I tried to speak but then I started spluttering. All of the salt rushed out of me like vomit on a bad night of drinking. I tried to speak again but the air caught in my chest and I was coughing all over. Finally, I answered, “You woke Dagon.”

“How?”

“You bled, you bled for me, and your blood woke the beast”

Alex sighed, plopping down like his muscles just gave out, “Ahh, I guess the blood of a monster woke the monster” He murmured into my chest.

“Yeah I guess so.”

“What about his uncle?”

“Dagon ate him.” 

“Serves him right”


“Yeah” I chuckled tiredly.

We emerged from that cave as the sun was high in the sky. It was quiet, like the early morning on a Sunday. No cars in the streets, no people on the sidewalks. It was empty, but for a few people every third or fourth block. The news later would explain that about ten percent of all coastal populations just walked into the water and vanished overnight. It was a phenomenon nobody could explain. Some said it was the rapture, others mass hysteria. Some cried about occult worship, others blamed vaccines. Panic and fear swept up by the talking heads babbling on the screen, speculations of how this will impact trade and global disputes. But those empty streets felt peaceful, quiet, and safe as we made our way back to Alex’s house, collapsing on Alex’s couch, and raiding Alex’s fridge. 

“Why did you do it, Alex?” He took a moment to think.

“I can’t have my tranny becoming just another statistic Jackie”

“You could have died.”

“I could have died lots of times, at least this time it meant something.”

“I think you caused millions of people to disappear""

“Oh well. What can you do?” Alex dropped his head back onto the couch where he sat, “What do you think happened to them?”

I curled up next to him, letting my exhausted body rest in his space when I spoke, “They went to go put him back to sleep, they know how. It takes all of them.”

“Huh.” Alex replied, gazing up at the ceiling. Rain began to patter on the window next to us as the sky darkened on that lingering memory.

Alex remains my closest friend. He’s messy, and he’s weird, but I trust him with the deepest fibers of my being. Cat was discharged a month after that battle. She still can’t say what happened to her, but I don’t need her to. She got attacked, hollowed out, violated. The same way I did. And she recovered. She found herself again, despite enduring a loss as deep as losing one’s self. She lives at home now, with us, with brand new iron bars on the window. Mom and Dad are selling the house though, there’s only so much you can do.

The slices in my neck closed when they dried out, but they always itch when it rains. I don’t like swimming anymore, but I go to the ocean every once and a while, to think about memories, my dreams. I still dream of predators in the night, I still feel that aching sense of the dead king underneath everything- like he became part of me. Some small quiet part of me that hurts all the time, cries and screams about the pain I’ve been through, but I shush it down. I sing to it. I don't dream alone anymore, I don’t face my monsters by myself. In my dreams, I have someone with me, a friend. Someone who’s there for me during my worst times, who won't run away when things get hard. A friend I can trust, standing next to me, as I face that beast I will not name. Sometimes I gaze into those waves, finding dark eyes peering back at me, pale heads bobbing in the water. And I know that this is over, and that nothing will ever be truly over.

But I like to know American style.
I lived with my MIL at her home after we moved from Japan.
My husband is American and I am Japanese.
We brought our 3-month-old baby with us.
We have just started like with our first baby.
While being there we didn't pay anything for her for 3 months.
While us being Japan we neither pay anything my parents for 3 months.
My parents paid the apartment for us for 3 months total of 6 months.
After 3 days of flying from Japan, MIL, Husband, our baby and me drove to Florida for 13 hours to see her parents.
My baby still didn't have routine to sleep at night and I was so tired from moving to different country.
On the way, my husband asked me  if I am overwhelmed by being in English language environment.
MIL cut me off and said she should be fine.
I wanted to talk but she has often cut me off and I started to not talk much while she was there.
And on the way to Florida in the car,our baby was crying so hard and MIL told me that it is because I had a mug of coffee this morning even though I was on breastfeeding.
In Florida at her parents home, I was crying.After so much things we had had done and she was so cold on me.My husband said that she was just jokes.
The days were difficult but I was trying to fit on her life.
One day she told in front of my husband, husband’s niece and our baby about Japanese people were so weid I never seen people like that in my life.She didn't like to seat with Japanese people in the train while she was in Japan.
In Japan she kept complaining about Japan.
I was very sad but I couldn't tell it.
The day she kept telling the word  *Japanese people * even my husband stopped her and the niece closed her ears because her and my husband raised their voices.
And eventually she said that we are just enjoying this conversation to the niece.
I told my husband I felt sad.

While living together she decided our plan to do on my husband day off without asking us and one time we said can not do on the day and she was angry.
For 3 months I needed to hide my sadness and got crazy feelings in stressful situations.
There are so many things that I was uncomfortable with what she said or ignore and her facial expression towards me.
Should I have said something No or please don't do it to her directly?
My English skill stopped me saying something against her and I was so scared of her.
We were with her for 3 months.
Now we have moved to our place for 2 months it's far from MIL.
2 weeks ago she came here and my baby cried at her. She said that she is crying because I didn't show the video of her singing.
It passed 1 month and half from moved out from MIL.
I was looking for my job and trying to use to be in new area so didn't have enough time with caring my baby.
I thought why all reasons her crying is because of me. I couldn't tell her though.
I don't want to talk with her anymore because bad memories flashed back each time when she texted and affect my life. I like to enjoy my baby little time.
I was patient while being with her because I wanted to have a good relationship and didn't want to break it and appreciated her that let us being there but I was getting so depressed.
Throughout time with her, she asked me something were only few.
When she thought I bought new swimsuit but I don't buy any cloths or fan stuff because I am not working. The suimsuit was from Japan.
We never been to restaurant or anything like that.
I cook every single of day.Do laundry and hung cloths myself.

## ***Flight Risk pt.2***

*A Memoir*

---  

## **Chapter 5: Engines of Desire**

You never forget the first time someone looks at you like you might *actually* get off the ground.

For me, that someone was **Chelsea Dwyer** — the only girl in our graduating class who could rebuild a carburetor *and* quote Jane Austen without irony. She had a way of listening that made you feel like every stupid thing you said was part of a larger, unspoken plan.

When I told her I wanted to fly for a living, she didn’t laugh.   She didn’t ask why.  
She just said, “Then you better start acting like it.”

That was the moment I fell in love — not with her, not yet, but with the idea that someone else might believe I was built for something more than gravity.

### **Propulsion**

We met again the summer after graduation.  
She was working at her dad’s auto shop, elbow-deep in engine grease and disapproval.  
I was changing oil for Tony’s uncle, pretending the smell of jet fuel was close enough to the real thing.

Every day at lunch, she’d sit across from me in the back lot, unwrapping her sandwich like it was a ritual. We’d talk about engines, the physics of combustion, how power needed resistance — how flight was just a prettier word for controlled explosion.

“You know,” she said once, “people think pilots are dreamers. But they’re not. They’re engineers of chaos.”

I nodded, pretending to understand, but all I could think was how sunlight hit the grease on her wrist like it was something sacred.

### **Taxiing**

By August, we were inseparable.  
Late-night drives to the county line, sharing stories we didn’t know how to finish.  
I told her about my first crash, about Jack Elliot, about how I’d once believed flying could fix me.  
She told me about her dad — ex–Air Force, all bark and medals, still furious she didn’t join up.

“He thinks being a pilot’s a man’s job,” she said, kicking at the gravel.  
“Funny,” I said. “My mom thinks it’s a *real* job.”

We laughed, but underneath it, we both knew we were running on borrowed time.  
Small towns have a way of folding you back into the dirt if you don’t take off fast enough.

### **First Flight**

One Saturday, she showed up at the hangar holding two pairs of goggles and a grin that could’ve jump-started a dead heart.  
“Tony says the trainer plane’s working again,” she said.   “And his uncle’s gone till Monday.”

I don’t remember saying yes.  
I just remember the sound — the slow, uneven cough of the engine turning over, the rattle of metal trembling with possibility.

We taxied down the strip, her hand on the throttle, mine on the yoke.  
Wind peeled against the fuselage.  
The nose lifted.  
And for three perfect seconds, we weren’t touching the ground.

It wasn’t flight — not technically. We didn’t clear the trees.  
But for someone like me, three seconds was eternity.  
Three seconds was proof.

When the plane sputtered back down, we laughed so hard I thought I’d choke on my own joy.  
And somewhere in that laughter, I realized:  
I wasn’t alone in wanting to defy gravity anymore.

**Voiceover (older me):**  
*That’s the thing about love — it’s just another kind of lift.   But every lift has drag. You can’t have one without the other.*

### **Descent**

Her father found out two days later.  
He didn’t yell — that would’ve been easier.  
He just looked at me like I’d vandalized something sacred.

“You think you’re a pilot?” he said, voice even, measured.  
“You’re a boy with a death wish and a borrowed machine. Don’t mistake adrenaline for purpose.”

I wanted to argue.  
Wanted to tell him that purpose was the only thing keeping me alive.  
But the words got stuck in my throat like bad air.

Chelsea didn’t talk to me for a week after that.  
And when she did, her voice was soft, like the static at the end of a radio transmission.

“I still believe in you,” she said.  
“But maybe believing’s the problem.”

**Voiceover (older me):**  
*Funny thing about engines — they don’t stall because of the air. They stall because they’ve burned through everything that keeps them running.*

That was the last summer before life started landing punches faster than I could dodge them.  
The last time I looked up and thought the sky was on my side.

## **Chapter 6: Jack Elliot Lives!**

You ever meet your hero and realize he’s human?  
It’s like watching a bird hit a window in slow motion — you’re horrified, but you can’t look away.

Jack Elliot was *my guy.*  
Saturday mornings, cereal bowl in hand, I watched him barrel-roll through cardboard clouds, the wind machine cranked so high his toupee looked like it had its own wings.

He was the reason I believed in escape velocity — the idea that you could punch your way out of gravity with enough guts and optimism.

So when the county fair announced “**JACK ELLIOT: LIVE AND IN PERSON!**” I nearly cried.  
Never mind that “live” turned out to mean “still breathing,” and “in person” meant “in folding chair.”

### **Grounded Legends**

He was sitting under a tent that smelled like fried dough and lost childhoods.  
The once-glorious silver flight suit had faded to something between duct tape and despair.  
Beside him, a handwritten sign: *$10 for a photo, $5 if you bring your own camera.*

I waited in line behind a handful of dads pretending they were doing it for their kids.  
When it was my turn, I shook his hand — it was warm and trembling, the grip of someone who’d spent a lifetime signing autographs for people who’d stopped believing.

“Mr. Elliot,” I said, voice cracking. “You made me want to fly.”

He smiled the way old men do when they know exactly what you mean but wish you didn’t.

“Kid,” he said, “wanting’s the easy part.”

That should’ve been the end of it.  
A handshake, a picture, a story to tell.  
But something in me — the same broken compass that made me believe the sky owed me something — couldn’t stop there.

### **The Hangar Talk**

Later that night, I found him by the airstrip, sitting on a cooler, chain-smoking menthols and staring at the stars like they were taunting him.

“You ever still fly?” I asked.

He laughed. A sound like sandpaper on metal.  
“Son, they don’t let you near a cockpit when your liver’s clocked out before you have.”

We sat in silence for a minute. The fair lights hummed in the distance.

“I wanted to be you,” I said quietly.

He turned to me — eyes glassy, voice flat.  
“Don’t. Be you instead. The trick isn’t flying, it’s knowing when to land.”

Then he stubbed out his cigarette and walked off to his trailer, his silhouette shrinking until it vanished completely.

### **Post-Flight Depression**

That night I lay awake, the ceiling fan slicing through the dark.  
Jack Elliot wasn’t supposed to die. Not really.  
But that’s what heroes do, eventually — they land, whether they mean to or not.

And me?  
I couldn’t even get off the damn ground.

I started drinking more. Working less.  
Chelsea tried to pull me back into orbit, but I was already drifting.  
I told myself it was just turbulence — a rough patch before the climb.  
But deep down, I knew I was stalling.

**Voiceover (older me):**  
*The first time you fly, you think you’re invincible. The first time you fall, you realize you’re not even insulated.*

By the end of that summer, Jack Elliot’s autograph was fading on my wall.  
The ink smudged from the humidity, or maybe just from the truth setting in.

Dreams don’t die all at once.  
They just start landing in smaller and smaller pieces until you mistake the wreckage for reality.

---  

## **Chapter 7: The Sky is Closed**

If you want to know what rock bottom feels like, it’s not the crash that gets you.  
It’s the silence after — the kind of quiet that hums louder than any engine.

I stopped going to the hangar that fall.  
Stopped shaving, stopped pretending to be busy.  
It’s funny — you can spend your whole life chasing altitude, and when you finally level off, all you see is how far there still is to fall.

### **Static**

Chelsea was the first to go.

I don’t blame her.  
She tried to keep me from nosediving — sat with me in the half-dark of my apartment, hands wrapped around cold mugs of coffee, her eyes searching for the version of me that still believed in something.

“You’re not broken, Danny,” she said once. “You’re just… idling.”

But idling’s still burning fuel.  
I had nothing left in the tank.

One night she left the key on the counter, next to my grandfather’s photo, and whispered, “It's not flying if you never land.”

The door clicked shut, and the silence that followed was deafening.

### **Terminal Conditions**

Work dried up.  
Tony stopped calling.  
Even my mom stopped asking when I’d take the aviation exam again — as if by not mentioning it, she could erase the dream entirely.

I spent most of my days at The Runway Bar — a dive so dim you couldn’t tell if it was day or night.  
I’d sit in the back, nursing a beer until it was as flat as I felt, listening to other people’s engines hum on the highway.

That’s when I realized — I’d traded one addiction for another.  
Flight had always been my high.  
Now it was nostalgia.

**Voiceover (older me):**  
*They don’t tell you how heavy gravity gets when you stop fighting it. It’s like the ground’s been waiting its whole life to collect the debt.*

### **Grounded**

The night everything really came apart, there was a storm — one of those unrelenting, sideways rains that makes even the brave hide under eaves.

I’d been drinking since noon, tracing rings on the counter with my glass.  
The TV behind the bar flickered — some news story about layoffs at the local plant.

And there, in the background, a shot of Chelsea’s dad shaking hands with the new foreman.  
I laughed. Out loud.  
Because of course he was fine. Of course he landed on his feet. Men like that always do.

But that laugh — it wasn’t funny. It came out wrong. Like a cough through broken lungs.

When I stumbled outside, the rain hit my face like punishment.  
I looked up — tried to see stars through the storm — but the clouds were solid, immovable.

That’s when the thought hit me, clear as the first time I saw a plane lift off:  
*Maybe the sky’s closed for me.*

### **Ground Zero**

The next morning, I woke to sunlight bleeding through the blinds.  
My head was pounding, but my hands — they were steady.

And in that hangover clarity, something shifted.  
If I couldn’t fly, maybe I could *fix* what was broken.

Not the dream — that was gone.  
But maybe the *reason* I chased it.

Because the truth wasn’t that I wanted to defy gravity.  
I just didn’t want to feel so small underneath it.

That was the day I decided to go back to the airstrip.  
Not to fly. Just to see if the sky would still have me.

---  

**Voiceover (older me):**  
*When you stop chasing the horizon, it doesn’t disappear. It waits. Patient. Distant. Like an old friend who knows you’ll circle back eventually.*

---  

## **Chapter 8: Paper Planes**

You don’t plan on getting better.  
You just run out of ways to stay broken.

It started small — a visit to the airstrip just to look, to see if the place still smelled like oil and ozone and hope. It did.  
The hangar door groaned when I pushed it open, like it recognized me and wasn’t sure it was happy about it.

Dust motes drifted in the sunlight. Old posters peeled from the wall — safety checklists, outdated air charts, a yellowed photo of a pilot with a grin too wide for his face.
For a second, I thought it might’ve been me.

### **Paper Planes**

I saw myself there — maybe twelve — folding scraps of notebook paper into gliders.  
I threw one. It nose-dived instantly.

“Gotta crease the wings sharper,” I said before I could stop myself.  
I'd look up, suspicious but curious.  
“You a pilot?”

I almost laughed.  
“I was trying to be,” I said. “Still am, I guess. Just…   grounded.”

I folded the next sheet like muscle memory — perfect symmetry, crisp lines, the way my father taught me before I ever touched a control yoke.

When I threw it, it sailed — smooth, level, true — gliding across the hangar and landing right on the nose of a rusted Cessna.

Dumb kid’s eyes went wide.  
“Dude!” he said, reverent.  
And for the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel like a fraud.

### **Repairs**

The old mechanic, Mr. Carlucci, was still around.  
He shop looked like a pile of rags that had learned to swear.  
“You still chasing ghosts?” he asked when he saw me.

“Just visiting,” I said.

He grunted. “Ghosts appreciate maintenance. Grab a wrench.”

That’s how it started this time.  
One plane — small repairs, hydraulic lines, instrument panels, the kind of work that keeps your hands busy enough to let your heart thaw in peace.

Sometimes the memory showed up again.  
He’d ask questions that reminded me how it was at that age:  
“How fast can this one go? How high? Ever seen the ocean from up there?”

And I’d answer, not as the dreamer I used to be, but as someone finally learning to tell the truth.

“I heard once it’s not about how high, it’s about how long you can stay steady before the world pulls you back.”

### **A Letter Never Sent**

One evening I found Chelsea’s old scarf in the glove compartment of a trainer plane.  
I must’ve left it there after one of our late-night test runs.  
It still smelled faintly like her — soap, coffee, maybe regret.

I took it home, sat at the kitchen table, and wrote her a letter I never mailed:

> *Chelsea,*  
>
> *I used to think flight was freedom. Turns out, it’s forgiveness. The sky doesn’t care how long it takes you to come back — it just waits.*
>
> *If I ever make it up there again, I’ll wave. Not because I made it, but because you helped me try.*

I folded it into a paper plane and set it on the windowsill.
Didn’t throw it. Didn’t need to.

### **Paper Wings**

Days turned into weeks, weeks into a kind of rhythm.  
Fix. Fly. Land. Sleep.  
I wasn’t chasing the sky anymore — I was *working* with it.

One night, Mr. Carlucci's nephew Leo asked me what kept me going.

I thought about Jack Elliot, about Allison, about every stupid hill I’d died on just to prove I could climb.

“Hope,” I said finally. “And old habits.”

**Voiceover (older me):**  
*People think flight’s about the air. But it’s really about the ground — the promise that it’ll still be there when you fall.*

---  

That was the beginning of the rest of my life — the part no one writes movies about.  
The quiet takeoffs. The soft landings. The peace of knowing you don’t need to break the sound barrier to be moving forward.

---  

## **Chapter 9: The Last Offer**

You don’t expect your redemption to come wearing a polo shirt and wraparound sunglasses.  
But that’s how mine arrived — in the form of **Rick Delaney**, former barnstormer, airshow promoter, and full-time human megaphone.

He found me at the hangar one morning, hands covered in grease, mid-lecture about carburetors to a group of bored teens.  
“You get your license yet, hotshot?” he asked without preamble.

I wiped my hands on a rag. “Barely. Why?”

“I got a gap in the lineup for Sunday’s AirFest. One of the stunt guys busted his landing gear in Dover this past weekend. I need a local with some flair and no fear.”
He paused, scanning me. “Figure that’s you?”

Leo, standing nearby, dropped his wrench.  
“You’re not gonna let him *fly*?” he said, like it was his business to risk.

I laughed. “Kid, I done more than test hops these years.”

Rick shrugged. “Then it’ll be a comeback story. People love those. Local boy storms the sky. One flight. Fifteen minutes. You in or not?”

The silence that followed felt like pressure in my ears — that soundless moment before takeoff when the world holds its breath.

---  

### **Preparation**

That night, I sat in the cockpit of the trainer — the same one I’d rebuilt bolt by bolt.  
Hands on the controls, heart in my throat.

Every memory came roaring back — the doctor saying I wasn’t built for coordination, girlfriend fathers saying I wasn’t built for responsibility, the crashouts, the almosts, the grounded years.

But under all that noise, something else hummed.  
A low, steady voice that sounded suspiciously like my own:  
*You were never flying to prove them wrong. You were flying to remember who you are.*

---  

### **The Morning Of**

Airshow day.  
Blue sky like polished glass. The kind of weather you don’t get twice.

Crowds lined the fences, kids with foam gliders, and old vets with binoculars beside them.

Rick slapped me on the back. “You nervous?”

I grinned, half terrified, half alive.  
“Only of not landing on my feet.”

He laughed. “That’s the spirit.”

As I climbed into the cockpit, I saw my reflection in the canopy — older, lined, a few ghosts behind the eyes, but still that same idiot dreamer who once believed he could touch the clouds and make them stay.

---  

### **Takeoff**

The engine caught on the first turn — a sound like an omen and forgiveness.  
Wheels rolled, tarmac blurred, horizon lifted.

Then — air.  
Real, weightless, clean air.

Every nerve lit up like a city grid at night.  
The controls answered my fingers with the intimacy of old lovers.

Down below, the crowd was just color and motion.  
Up here, it was only sky.

**Voiceover (older Danny):**  
*They say flying is freedom. But it’s not. It’s the moment you stop running — from gravity, from guilt, from yourself — and finally trust the fall.*

---  

### **The Pass**

The first loop was shaky — muscle memory meeting muscle doubt.  
The second, smoother.  
By the third, I was laughing — actually laughing — over the headset, breathless, stupid, alive.

Rick’s voice crackled over radio:  
“Nice form, rookie. Don’t get cocky.”

“Wouldn’t dream of it,” I said.

And then I saw her.  
Chelsea, down below, beside the crowd barrier.  
I don’t know how long she’d been standing there, but when she raised her hand — a small wave, tentative — the doubt inside me ceased.

The loop I made next wasn’t for the crowd.
One was for her.

---  

### **Landing**

Every flight has to end.  
Even the perfect ones.

Wheels kissed the runway — smooth, quiet, clean.  
Applause from the crowd blurred into white noise and heartbeats.

Leo was the first to reach me, breathless.  
“You *did it!*”

I smiled, climbing out, legs trembling. “Yeah, kid. Next time it could be you.”

Rick offered a handshake. “You ever want to do this again…”

I stopped him. “No,” I said gently. “I think this one was the flight.”

He nodded — like he understood the kind of peace you don’t mess with.

---  

**Voiceover (older Danny):**  
*For as long as I can remember, I wanted to be a pilot.  
Turns out, I was — I just wasn't official.*

---  

## **Chapter 10: Descent and Horizon**

The sky looks different when you’re not chasing it.  
It’s quieter, for one. Less promise, more presence.

I sit on a bench near the airfield every Saturday morning. The same place I used to stand trembling with a clipboard, counting down the seconds to taxi clearance.   Now I just watch.

The airshow’s smaller these days. Drones share the sky with the Cessnas and Pitts Specials. Half the pilots weren’t even born when I took my last loop. And yet, when the engines start their morning growl, something in my chest still answers — an old reflex, like a song you flinch at without realizing.

Leo’s one of them now.  
He flies for the Coast Guard, though he comes back on holiday sometimes for the old-timers’ fly-in. Says he can’t unlearn what I taught him — ""Listen to the wind, not the instruments.”

He laughs when he says it, but I see the care behind his hands on the yoke. The same reverence I had. The same madness, maybe.  
That hunger to belong somewhere just above the world.

---  

**Voiceover (older Danny):**  
*Funny thing about flying — people think it’s about escape velocity and dips. But it’s not. It’s about learning the shape of gravity. The weight of being alive, and the grace it takes to carry it well.*

I watch the new pilots taxi out, little dots of motion and noise and hope.  
Engines rise, tires lift, the ground lets go.

For a moment, they hang there — caught between the earth that made them and the sky that’s still deciding if it wants them.

Every time, I whisper the same thing:
“Hold steady. Don’t fight it. Trust the fall.”

---  

The bench creaks when I stand. The day’s already warming up. I take one last look at the horizon — the line I spent a lifetime chasing, only to find it waiting quietly behind me the whole time.

I start toward the hangar.
The garage door’s half open, and sunlight cuts through the dust just right — turning the air gold.

In the corner, under a tarp, sits my old trainer plane.
Wings folded, patient.
It looks like it’s sleeping.

I rest my hand on the fuselage. The metal’s cool, like it always was.

“Nuff good, old girl,” I murmur.

Then I flick off the light, step into the sun, and let the door close behind me — slow, gentle, final.

---  

**Voiceover (older Danny):**
*Maybe I never really learned to fly.
Maybe I just learned to fall gracefully.
Either way, it was beautiful while it lasted.*

Sounds like a scam, right? I thought so too.

One afternoon, I gave it a shot while waiting for my coffee to cool. No phone, no music, no thinking, just sitting there. At first, I was in a panic. My hands were shaking. My mind was filled with fast running thoughts. I wanted to read a text, open a new page, do anything.

Soon, however, I could see that my mind was organizing itself. Minor issues, chaotic ideas, and small choices were all just coordinated. I didn’t feel like it was the right time to do something. I didn’t feel like it was the right time to charge my batteries. But I felt that it was time for me to do something without the burden of mental heaviness.

The most amazing thing? At the end of the day, I found myself smiling at a problem I usually get stressed out about. Just a tiny shift, but it was as if a window had cracked open in my brain.

Am I missing anything?,"Hey everyone! My buddy (34) and I (35) are coming into town a day early for a bachelor party, which means we’ve got Halloween night totally open to explore Buffalo. We’re both social, friendly, and down for anything that feels local - good food, good people, and a few (okay, several) adult beverages.

We land around noon on 10/31 and have a rental car, so we’re thinking of starting the trip strong with wings. Wingnutz in Williamsville is calling our name, it seems like one of those “gotta check it off the list” kind of places, even if the wings are a little overpriced. After that, we’re planning what we call a “bang-bang” (double lunch, for those who know the term). Kelly’s Korner is on the list since we’ll already be north, but we’ve also read a ton about Nine-Eleven Tavern. What do you locals think, worth the driving around, or better to double up somewhere else after Wingnutz?

Once we’re full and happy, we’ll probably need a little digestive walk. Any favorite waterfront parks for a stroll this time of year? We’re also planning to hit a dispensary before heading downtown to check into the Wyndham Garden and rest up a bit. I’ve seen Public Flower and East Leaf mentioned here. Not looking for the cheapest, just somewhere that takes care and pride in what they do.

After a power nap, we’re throwing on our Halloween costumes (we’re going as tourists - very on brand, I know) and heading out for happy hour. Beltline Brewing looks like a great starting point, but we’re also eyeing Big Ditch, Other Half, or Southern Tier. We love breweries, but we’ve also got Gene McCarthy’s, Adolf’s, and Gabriel’s Gate bookmarked in case we want to mix wings with beer instead. Any thoughts on a good route there?

Later in the night we’d like to do a little bar hopping. We’ve heard Nietzsche’s will have a show and are curious about that. Fattey’s and Founding Fathers are on the radar too, but we’d love more neighborhood bar suggestions, the kind of spots that will feel like Buffalo on Halloween.

Saturday is pretty much planned once the rest of the crew arrives, but we’ll have the morning open. Thinking about grabbing donuts, is Fry Baby the go-to? Or should we do coffee and donuts at Public Espresso? Totally open to other coffee or donut spots, especially if they’re near a nice place to walk. Delaware Park looks beautiful, but if there’s another park or even a cool old cemetery worth seeing, I’m all ears.

1ohm1un,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_somethinggoeshere2/comments/1ohm1un/i_got_kidnapped_by_aliens_and_barely_escaped_i/,I got kidnapped by aliens and barely escaped. (I got a DUI for crashing a flying saucer),"Now, before you go running your mouth about how this is the craziest thing you ever heard, the kind of story that leaks out of a bar at 2 AM, let me remind you: I fought the Goat Man of Hickory Ridge and lived. I didn't just fight him; I practically gave him a two-piece combo. I also personally detonated a whole nest of cannibal mole-men, which registered three counties over. So when I tell you I got abducted by real-deal, big-headed gray aliens, crash-landed their spaceship in Miller’s perfectly good cornfield, and then got slapped with a DUI by Deputy Henderson, you don't just believe me. You pay attention.

But I’m getting ahead of myself, a habit of mine that tends to cost me bail money.

It started about a month after I’d vaporized the mole-men. Things were on the upswing. My eyebrows, which had been nothing but a couple of charred, nervous specks, were finally growing back. I was tired of looking like a hard-boiled egg that had just experienced a constant, existential revelation. My ribs only screamed when I sneezed, and my busted knee only sounded like a rusty hinge with a vendetta about half the time now, instead of all the time. That, my friends, is progress.

What wasn't progress was the endless, slow-motion parade of government types crawling all over Hickory Ridge, ever since I’d set off what the news was calling 'minor seismic activity'. Minor, my ass. I blew up enough mountain tunnels and methane pockets to register on seismographs clear down to where the pavement ends, and they called it minor.

First, you had the USGS people with their ridiculous tripods and their fancy clipboards, taking readings and constantly scratching their heads like they’d just discovered dirt. Then the Department of Natural Resources folks, poking around like nervous squirrels, asking about ""potential sinkholes.""

Then, on a Tuesday morning, Jethro Culpepper, the County Engineer, showed up at my door. He had a hard hat perched on his head and a clipboard held like a religious text. He looked like his whole day, maybe his whole life, was about to curdle.

""Mr. Roberts?"" he said, staring down at his forms.

""That's me. Don't worry, the house isn't on fire right now.""

""I'm here to inspect your property,"" he continued, flat as a pancake. ""We’ve had multiple reports of structural instability in this area"".

I knew why. My house was sitting about five degrees off level. If you stood far enough back, it looked like a tired old dog that was thinking really hard about lying down for a nap.

""Yeah, well, ground shifts,"" I shrugged. ""Nature does what it wants. She’s a fickle mistress"".

Jethro just walked the perimeter, taking measurements with that official, disgusted air. Every few minutes, he’d stop, look at something on his level, and say, ""Well, that's not good"". He said it when he checked the foundation, the door frame, and especially when he looked at the southeast corner, which had practically taken a four-inch nose-dive into the earth.

""How not good are we talking?"" I asked, trying to sound casual.

He took off the hard hat, wiped his forehead with the back of a hand, and gave me the look. You know the one. The doctor look. The one where they’re about to tell you the bad news is terminal.

""Mr. Roberts,"" he sighed, the sound like air escaping a bicycle tire, ""your house is undermined. The ground beneath it is unstable, like wet oatmeal. This structure could collapse or shift further at any moment. My recommendation, a non-negotiable one, is that you evacuate immediately until proper repairs can be made.""

Translation: You're officially and spectacularly screwed, Billy Bob.

""Evacuate? Where in the hell am I supposed to go?""

""That’s not really my department,"" he chirped. ""I'm just here to assess the structural integrity, not your life choices.""

I looked at the house. It was a dump, sure, but it was my dump. I'd lived there fifteen years. I wasn't about to bail on it because some desk jockey with a clipboard said the dirt was feeling shifty.

""What if I shore it up?"" I said.

""Shore it up?""

""Yeah. Prop it up. Make it level again. Like a bar stool with a folded coaster.""

He looked at me like I’d just suggested fixing a compound fracture with duct tape and a prayer.

""Mr. Roberts, we are talking about structural engineering here. You’d need a proper foundation repair, possibly pilings driven deep into stable ground, and a licensed contractor. That is not something you can just prop up with a stick and some optimism.""

""But what if I could, though?""

He sighed again. ""If you can genuinely demonstrate that the structure is stable and level, and that it’s not going to shift further, then I suppose I could sign off on it. But you'll need professional help, and that's going to run you several thousand dollars at minimum.""

Several thousand dollars. I had exactly two hundred bucks in my checking account and a coffee can of singles and fives under the bed. That was not happening.

Jethro left. Said he’d be back in a week to check, and if I hadn't magically stabilized the side of a mountain, he’d have to officially condemn the property.

I stood there in my crooked kitchen, which was trying to dump me out the back door, and tried to figure out what the hell I was going to do. Then I remembered. The shed. The old hydraulic jack I used to lift my Army surplus deuce and a half truck, before the transmission decided it wanted to sound like a blender full of pebbles.

It took a sweaty half hour of digging it out from under old tarps and rusty implements of destruction. The jack was a greasy, dust-caked monster, but when I pumped the handle a few times, it still hissed and lifted.

I dragged it to the low-riding southeast corner, got down on my hands and knees in the damp dirt, positioned it under the main support beam, and started pumping. It was slow motion and pure agony. Pump. Nothing. Pump. Pump. Then a creak, a protesting groan from the house’s very soul. I kept at it until the house felt like it had shifted a few inches. Good enough for now.

I cracked open a beer, sat right down on my porch steps (which were now mostly level), and took a long, satisfied look at my work. Jethro could take his licensed contractors and his ""several thousand dollars"" and shove the whole bureaucratic mess right up his clipboard.

I knew that jack wasn't going to hold forever. But forever was a long time. I figured I'd deal with that specific catastrophe when it became a more immediate, less beer-friendly problem.



Curtis Curtis owned the general store. Yes, that’s his real name. His mother thought she was a clever wordsmith; Curtis still hasn't forgiven her. The store was beautiful in its simplicity: it sold everything you absolutely needed and nothing you didn’t. That meant beer, cigarettes, questionable beef jerky, motor oil, ammo, and canned goods that had been sitting on the shelf so long they were probably older than some of the customers.

I was stocking up on essentials: a case of beer, three bags of jerky (the teriyaki kind), and a few packs of spicy peanuts. Curtis was behind the counter, fully immersed in The Hickory Ridge Tell-All, which was less a newspaper and more a certified, government-grade rumor mill someone printed at the library.

""You seen the lights?"" Curtis asked, not even bothering to look up. 

""What lights?"" I asked.

""Lights in the sky. Been happening the past few nights. Folks are getting their panties in a twist.""

I dumped my supplies on the counter. ""Folks are always talking, Curtis. This is Hickory Ridge.""

He folded the paper and pointed to the screaming headline: STRANGE LIGHTS OVER HICKORY RIDGE: EARTHQUAKE AFTEREFFECTS OR SOMETHING MORE?.

""Probably drones,"" I said, dismissive as always. ""The government loves flying drones around, spying on people’s barbecues and bad decisions.""

""That's what I think,"" Curtis nodded, instantly agreeing. ""They been watching us ever since that earthquake.""

I didn't say anything. Hard to keep a poker face when you’re literally the earthquake.

The door swung open, and in shuffled Sleepy Jones. Sleepy was the other official town drunk, Ezekiel being the third. Sleepy lived in a beat-up camper behind the church, blew his disability check on the cheapest bottom-shelf vodka, and had a solid reputation for saying things that were either profound or completely, irrevocably insane.

""Curtis,"" Sleepy slurred, his eyes red and watery, ""You got any of them little, personal bottles?""

""I got pints,"" Curtis said, producing a bottle of vodka from under the counter. Sleepy paid with a sweaty wad of crumpled ones and a handful of loose change.

""You boys talking about the lights?"" Sleepy asked.

""Yeah,"" Curtis said. ""Billy Bob here thinks it’s drones.""

Sleepy turned to look at me, a deep, unsettling sincerity in his bloodshot gaze. ""It ain't drones.""

""What is it, then?"" I asked.

""UFOs. I saw one last night. Big bright light, hovering over the ridge. And I swear, I saw something get pulled up into it.""

""Pulled up?"" I repeated.

""Sucked up. Like a vacuum cleaner for the cosmos. There was this black bear, a big son-of-a-gun, just wandering around, and that light came down and whoosh, up it went.""

Curtis rolled his eyes so hard I thought they might get stuck. ""Sleepy, you were drunk.""

""I'm always drunk,"" Sleepy countered, taking a swig. ""Don't mean I didn't see it.""

""Uncle Rufus used to see lights,"" I offered. Both Curtis and Sleepy stopped and stared at me.

""Your Uncle Rufus was legally insane,"" Curtis stated.

""Yeah, but he was right about some things,"" I countered. ""He said the government was watching us, and look, he was right about that. Maybe he was right about the UFOs.""

Sleepy nodded, taking another pull from his pint, suddenly reverent. ""Your uncle was a smart man.""

""He also thought lizard people ran the DMV,"" I said, trying to reintroduce reality.

""Do they not?"" Sleepy asked, genuinely confused.

I grabbed my beer and jerky and left before the conversation could achieve escape velocity.

When I got home, I noticed right off that something was off. The door didn’t just stick; it fought me. I had to hit it with my shoulder just to make the latch catch.

The jack had failed.

I walked around to the southeast corner and, sure enough, the hydraulic jack was lying flat on its side in the dirt, completely defeated. The whole house had slumped again, settling back to its five-degree angle of tired misery.

""Goddammit,"" I muttered.

I dragged the jack back under and grabbed three rough cinder blocks. I figured if I jacked the house up and slid the blocks under the beam, that would spread the weight out better than just the tip of the jack. It took an hour of agonizing work: Jack it, slide a block, adjust, jack it again, slide another. By the time I was finished, the house looked level enough to fool a blind man in a heavy fog.

I cracked another beer and admired my crude, perfect handiwork. ""Good enough,"" I declared to the woods.

It wasn't. I knew it wasn't. But it would hold until the next inevitable crisis.

That night, I tried to sleep, but the earlier tilt had totally messed up my inner sense of level. Even lying flat, I felt like I was constantly rolling off the bed. After two hours of fighting my own pillow, I gave up, grabbed a beer, and went out to the porch.

The sky was clear and cold enough to see your breath, and the stars looked sharp as tacks. I sat down, sipped, and looked up. I figured I’d stay up a while. Keep an eye on the sky. See if Sleepy’s UFO was coming back to vacuum up another bear.

I stayed up two nights straight watching the sky. All I saw was one airplane and maybe a blurry satellite.

On the third night, exhaustion won. I fell asleep around two and woke up at dawn with a beer can glued to my hand and a crick in my neck that felt like somebody’d replaced my spine with a rusty chain. The house hadn’t helped. One of the cinder blocks had cracked like cheap porcelain, and everything was tilted again. Trying to sleep felt like being tied to the deck of a boat in a violent storm. After a few beers, it felt worse.

So I kept the vigil. Stayed up. Watched the sky. Drank beer. Waited.

On the fourth night, around eleven, I was three beers deep when I saw it. A light. Not a plane. Not a satellite. Big, bright, and moving in ways that absolutely nothing man-made ought to move. It came from the east, completely silent, a pale greenish-white glow. It stopped dead, hung there for maybe ten seconds, then darted across the sky like a frantic cockroach before shooting off toward the northwest ridge. It disappeared behind the trees.

I knew that ridge. Two miles out there’s a cave. Wide as three garage doors, a dozen yards deep. Me and my cousin Darrell used to dare each other to go inside when we were kids, but we never made it far before chickening out.

That was where the light had gone. And that cave? That was exactly the kind of place a UFO might choose to hide its shiny, silent self.

I started gathering my supplies. Flashlight: the heavy-duty Maglite. Rope: thirty feet, just in case. Weapon: the big, reliable crowbar. Sustenance: Teriyaki beef jerky. Courage: Six tallboys of beer.

No gun. The Goat Man had taken care of my last one. But the crowbar had worked just fine on the mole-men, so I figured it would work on little green (or gray) men, too. How tough could they be, anyway?.

I slung the pack over my shoulder and headed out. The moon was fat and full, so bright I barely needed the flashlight. Ten minutes in, I cracked the first beer. Just to take the edge off the reality of what I was doing. Halfway there, the trail suddenly looked different at night, so I stopped for the second.

Around one in the morning, something moved in the black curtain of trees to my left. Big and dark. I froze, lifting the flashlight, sweeping the powerful beam across the gloom.

Nothing.

Then I heard it. A bleat. Faint, distant, but I knew that sound like my own name.

The Goat Man.

I stood stone still, crowbar raised like a silver cross, my heart hammering so hard I thought it would blow a gasket. If he came out of those trees right now, I was in absolutely no shape for a rematch.

Nothing moved. Just that one lonely, mournful bleat, and then silence. Might've been him. Might've been a dream. Might've just been the beer starting to kick in. I decided to not stick around and find out which.

By the time the sky turned that weary, hopeful gray, I’d finally reached the base of the ridge. My knee was grinding like a coffee mill full of gravel, and my legs felt like cooked noodles, but I was there.

The cave entrance was exactly where I remembered it. Wide and low, a dark, hungry mouth cut into the gray limestone. The air rolling out of it was cool and damp, carrying that sharp, wet mineral smell that belongs only to the deep earth.

I cracked the third beer, took a long, resolute pull, and stepped inside.

Time to meet some aliens.

The cave entrance was massive up close: thirty feet wide, fifteen feet high at the center. I clicked on the Maglite. The air temperature dropped twenty degrees immediately. The limestone walls were slick and smooth in some spots, rough and pitted in others. My footsteps echoed.

The smell hit me about twenty feet in. Chemical and sharp. Like if you mixed bleach with burning plastic and left it out in the sun. Something was definitely in here.

I moved slow, sweeping the beam. The chemical stink got stronger, coating my mouth.

And then I walked face-first into something that simply wasn't there.

The impact knocked me backward. I dropped the flashlight; it clattered, spinning, sending a frantic, jerking beam of light across the walls.

""Son of a bitch!"".

I grabbed my nose, checked for blood. Nothing broken, but it felt like a hornet’s nest had detonated in my face. I picked up the flashlight, pointed it forward.

Still nothing. Just empty, dark cave.

I reached out. My fingers brushed something smooth and bitterly cold. It felt like metal pretending to be air.

I followed it with my hand. It curved, a wide, gentle arc. I was tracing the outline of something impossibly huge. A ship. Invisible. Cloaked. Whatever aliens use to hide their shame.

Then came the noises. Not quite human voices. High-pitched chirps mixed with deep clicks and electronic warbles that went right into my jaw and made my teeth ache.

Outside the cave. Getting closer.

I killed the light instantly and pressed myself flat against the cold, gritty wall, breathing shallow and trying to become part of the rock. My heart was hammering like a trapped bird trying to escape my ribs.

Then, a tapping. Click-click-click. Footsteps, but definitely not human ones.

Three figures stepped out of the night and into the cone of light from the cave entrance.

They were gray. Maybe four feet tall, thin as a stack of broom handles. Their heads were enormous, looking ridiculously too big for their spindly bodies. They had huge, terrifying black eyes that took up half their faces. No noses, just two little slits. Their mouths were barely there, like an afterthought. The skin had a weird texture, smooth but not quite, like powdered rubber.

They moved with these fast, unsettling little jerks, like broken stop-motion puppets trying to walk. They stood there, squeaking at each other in that horrible, dental-drill language. One held a little gadget full of blinking lights. He pointed it toward the cave mouth, got a green blink, and started walking toward the invisible ship.

A chunk of the air beside them simply opened up. Just gone. A soft, eerie blue light spilled out. No door. No seam. Just pure, waiting light.

I waited until all three disappeared inside. The opening was still there. Still glowing.

I crept closer, peeked in. The corridor stretched maybe fifty feet, lined with that soft blue glow and dark walls. It looked bigger on the inside. Way bigger.

No time like the present, as my Uncle Rufus would always say right before he did something regrettable.

I ducked my head and climbed in.

The floor felt weirdly springy under my boots. The air was hot and thick with that chemical smell. The mechanical hum of the ship filled the space, with a chorus of beeps and hisses underneath it. Deeper inside, the gray bastards were still talking.

I moved slowly, trying not to make my boots squeak. The hall branched off in a few directions. I picked one at random.

That's when I started seeing the rooms.

The first room had a window. Inside, a man was strapped to a tilted table. Awake. His eyes were wide and glassy, staring at nothing. Little floating metal bugs worked over him, all legs and tiny drills and needles. One jabbed something thin into his stomach. His back arched, his skin stretched tight. The needle sank deeper. His eyes rolled up white. His mouth opened, but no sound came out.

The floating thing withdrew the needle. Something dark dripped from the tip. Another metal bug moved in, extending a different tool; this one had tiny, rotating blades. It lowered toward the man's abdomen.

I spun away from the window before the spinning blades could touch him. My stomach was doing a violent, slow-motion roll.

The next room held a woman. Her chest was split wide open, ribs clamped apart by metal spreaders. I could see her heart pounding frantically. She was breathing. Shallow, rapid breaths. Her eyes were open, staring at the ceiling, but she was alive. Awake. Feeling everything.

Three aliens stood around her with glowing tablets, poking at her exposed, pulsing organs with metal rods. One of them reached right inside her chest cavity and lifted something. Examined it. Her breathing hitched, becoming labored and desperate. They put it back. Started poking something else.

""Jesus Christ,"" I whispered, the name tasting like acid on my tongue.

I kept moving, because if I stopped, I was going to puke or scream or both, and either way, I’d be next.

The third room. Bones on a table. Human bones, half-cleaned. Strips of flesh still hanging off them. In the corner, a flannel shirt and a pair of boots.

I pressed my forehead against the cold wall and tried to force my lungs to work right. I had to get the hell out of this nightmare.

The halls twisted. I passed enormous tanks with shapes floating inside them, bubbling green fluid surrounding what might have been people once. Another room held a sound that was screaming so high and steady it no longer sounded human. I kept my head down and didn't look.

A smaller room sat ahead. Darker and quieter. No tables. No aliens. Maybe a storage closet. I slipped inside, and the door hissed and contracted shut behind me. I let myself breathe for the first time in an hour.

A screen glowed in the corner. It showed the world outside. But it wasn't the cave rock. It was space. Below me, blue and curved and shining, was the entire planet Earth.

""Well, I’ll be damned,"" I said, the words barely a rasp. ""Guess Uncle Rufus was only half crazy. Earth’s round after all"".

I sat down against the wall. Pulled a beer from my pack and cracked it open. This was it. I was in space. On an alien ship. Probably about to be dissected or probed or turned into some kind of weeping experiment. Might as well have a beer.

I finished the first one. Opened the second.

The door slid open. A gray alien stood there, holding one of those blinking devices. It looked at me. I looked at it. Its huge, dead-black eyes didn't blink, not once.

For three long seconds, nothing happened.

Then it made a sound. A warbling squeal that started low and climbed until it felt like it was trying to stab right through my eardrums.

I threw the beer can directly at its oversized head.

The can thunked off its skull, spraying cheap beer everywhere. The alien stumbled back, squealing like a stepped-on cat with a head cold. I was already sprinting down the hall, crowbar gripped tight in one hand, my boots squeaking on the rubberized floor.

Behind me came more squealing. More clicks. I guess the jackass called for backup.

I ran blind through a maze of twisting corridors. Left. Right. Left again. Every hallway looked the same as the last.

Something zipped past my head and hit the wall. The spot where it hit instantly started smoking, melting, the metal turning black and bubbling like a nasty wound.

I looked back. Three of them now. Running in that jerky, broken way. Holding those devices pointed right at my back. Ray guns. Actual, honest-to-God little ray guns, straight out of the B-movie late shows I used to watch as a kid.

Another shot sizzled past, close enough to singe my hair and make me smell like burnt popcorn. I dove through the next open door, stumbled into another hallway that was sloping down. My knee and lungs were screaming fire, but I kept running.

The corridor opened into a much larger space. I stumbled out into what had to be a hangar bay. And scattered around were smaller ships. Little flying saucers, maybe fifteen feet across, sitting on landing struts like shiny, squat bugs.

Escape pods? I figured one of them was my ticket out of this madhouse.

I heard the warbling behind me. Closer now. I ran to the nearest saucer, slapped a panel on the side, and started pressing everything. Just mashing my hand against the smooth surface. The panel next to me lit up. A door hissed and slid open in the side of the saucer.

The aliens rounded the corner. Four of them. Moving toward me. Raising those stupid ray guns.

I flipped them the bird with enthusiasm and dove inside the saucer.

The cockpit was tiny. One seat, restraints, a curved console covered in glowing buttons and alien hieroglyphs. A screen showed the hangar outside. Through that screen, I could see the aliens at the doorway, raising their weapons. One stepped inside the hangar.

I started mashing buttons. All of them. Slapping them like a man trying to kill an angry wasp with his palm. Lights flashed. The console beeped. The restraints snapped tight around me, crushing my ribs.

The aliens were inside the hangar now. Three of them. Moving toward the seat. One raised its ray gun for a clear shot.

I slammed the biggest button I could find, a round bastard glowing neon orange, like it wanted to be hit.

The engine fired.

It felt like getting instantly run over by a truck made entirely out of gravity. My head slammed back, my vision went completely white. The saucer screamed forward. The aliens scattered like bowling pins. The hangar walls blurred into a streak. An energy field was blocking the exit, but the saucer punched through it anyway, like tissue paper.

Suddenly, I was outside. Space. Stars spinning like drunken carnival rides.

The saucer stabilized, drifting forward. Behind me, the mother-ship shrank. Then, smaller, angrier saucers started launching. Coming for me.

""Oh hell,"" I said.

I looked at the panel. There had to be something. Some kind of go-faster button. But every button was covered in alien scribbles. No way to know what anything did.

The pursuing saucers were getting closer. Small silver dots growing into metal fists.

I started hitting buttons again. Random buttons. Desperate, panicked buttons. The saucer lurched hard left. Then it dove. Dropping toward Earth so fast, the screen around the edges started glowing an angry, terrified red.

Something exploded behind me. I didn't care what.

The Earth was filling the entire screen now. I could see the curve flattening out as we got lower. I could see the atmosphere, a thin blue line of salvation that I was about to hit like a thrown rock.

The saucer shook violently, like a washing machine full of broken bricks. Fire streamed across the screen. The air inside grew instantly hot enough to sweat through my flannel shirt.

The chasing saucers finally broke off. Either they couldn't handle the atmosphere, or they decided I was too much trouble for a routine abduction.

The fire on the screen faded. The shaking got worse, a sickening rattle. Through the screen, I could finally see the landscape. Mountains. Trees. Rivers. All rushing up at me way too fast.

I started slapping buttons again. Pure, frantic hope. The saucer finally responded, angling up, but we were still dropping. Fast. I could see individual trees now. A road. A barn.

I hit more buttons. One of them did something glorious. The saucer suddenly slowed, like somebody’d stomped on the universe's brake pedal. The stop nearly tore me in half.

We were still dropping. Still moving too fast. But slower now.

The screen showed a field. Corn. Rows and rows of it.

The corn was rushing up fast. Too fast.

The crash threw me against the restraints so hard I actually saw cartoon stars and birds. The saucer bounced, skipped, tore up dirt and cornstalks, flipped twice with a deafening screech of metal, and then stopped upside down. Alarms were screaming a high, frantic note, and smoke poured out of every seam.

I hung there for a minute, doing a painful, slow inventory. Everything hurt. My ribs, my back, my neck, that old busted knee. But I could move my fingers. Could move my toes. I could breathe, even though it felt like inhaling ground glass.

The restraints finally released, and I fell onto what was now the ceiling, landing in a heap of pure, exhausted agony. The door was above me. I crawled toward it, pushed. It opened halfway, then jammed. I had to kick it the rest of the way with a desperate grunt.

Fresh air hit me. Cool and clean. Smelled like dirt and corn and home.

I crawled out, fell onto the dirt, and just lay there, staring up at the sky. It was dawn. Pink and orange streaks across the horizon. Birds were singing a stupid, cheerful song. Somewhere in the distance, a rooster was crowing about the morning.

I'd made it.

That’s when I heard the siren.

I sat up. A police car was coming down the dirt road, lights flashing that sad, familiar red and blue. It pulled up about fifty feet away, and Deputy Henderson got out.

Henderson was about my age. Played football two towns over until he blew out his knee. He’d been working for the sheriff for maybe five years, and he took his job with a terrifying seriousness.

He walked toward me, hand resting on his gun, looking from me to the smoking saucer half-buried in Miller's cornfield.

""Billy Bob?"" he said, his voice flat with disbelief. ""That you?""

""Hey, Henderson,"" I gasped.

""What in the living hell happened here?""

I looked at the saucer. Looked at Henderson.

""I crashed,"" I stated.

""I can see that, Billy Bob. What is that thing?""

""UFO,"" I said simply.

Henderson stared at me. Then at the saucer. Then back at my beer-soaked face.

""You're telling me you crashed a UFO in Miller's corn field?""

""That's about the size of it,"" I nodded.

""Have you been drinking?"".

That's when I remembered the empty beer cans still rattling around in my pack.

""I mean, technically yes,"" I explained, ""but that's not why I crashed. I crashed because I don't know how to fly a stolen alien spacecraft, and I was being chased by other alien spacecraft, and the controls are all in a language that looks like dentist tools, so I just started hitting random buttons.""

Henderson walked closer, sniffing the air with professional disgust.

""How much have you had to drink?""

""I don't know,"" I frowned. ""Four beers? Five? But that was over the course of like six hours, and most of it was before I even got on the ship.""

""Uh-huh,"" Henderson said, pulling out his radio.

""Dispatch, this is Henderson. I'm gonna need a supervisor out at Miller's field off Route 9. We got a… situation here.""

Henderson looked at me. Looked at the smoking saucer. ""Just get someone out here,"" he repeated into the radio.

He put the radio away and pulled out his handcuffs.

""Billy Bob Roberts,"" he announced, his voice taking on a heavy, official tone, ""I'm placing you under arrest for driving under the influence.""

""I wasn't driving,"" I protested. ""I was flying.""

""Operating a vehicle while intoxicated, then.""

""It's not a vehicle! It's an interstellar spacecraft!""

""It's got a motor, and it moves, that makes it a vehicle in this county,"" he insisted. ""Turn around.""

""Henderson, you have to listen to me! There are real aliens up there! They've got a ship in orbit, and they are abducting people and cutting them open, and I barely escaped with my life! This is bigger than a DUI!""

""Turn around, Billy Bob.""

""I'm serious! They had a poor lady getting cut up, and God knows what else! This is real!""

Henderson grabbed my arm, spun me around with professional force, and cuffed me tight.

""You have the right to remain silent,"" he said, the metal cold on my wrists. ""I strongly suggest you use it.""

He led me back to his patrol car and shoved me into the back seat. Through the window, I could see the saucer. Smoke was still rising from it, and half of Miller’s cornfield was completely torn up around it.

""You're gonna test that thing, right?"" I said. ""You're gonna get scientists out here, not just drunk-driving investigators?""

""I'm sure someone will take a look at it,"" Henderson said vaguely.

""They're gonna find out it's alien technology! They're gonna see I'm telling the absolute truth!""

Henderson didn't say anything. He just put the car in gear and started driving away from the cornfield.

I leaned my head against the plastic window. My ribs hurt. My head hurt. I was going to jail.

For crashing a flying saucer.

After escaping from orbit.

Uncle Rufus would’ve been so, so proud.

They kept me in the county jail for three days while they ""investigated."" By investigated, I mean they gave me a breathalyzer that came back at .08, which Henderson cheerfully informed me was exactly at the legal limit. I tried to explain that there’s probably no legal limit for operating a stolen alien spacecraft, but Judge Karlson failed to find that bit funny.

Judge Karlson was about a hundred years old, wore glasses so thick you could swim in them, and had already seen me in her courtroom twice before. She did not like me.

""Mr. Roberts,"" she said, looking over her spectacles. ""Do you have anything to say for yourself before I lower the boom?""

""Your Honor,"" I told her, as earnestly as I could manage, ""I was abducted by aliens. They took me into space. I escaped by stealing one of their ships. I crashed it. That is the whole story, Your Honor.""

""And you'd been drinking,"" she added, heavy on the disapproval.

""Yes, ma'am, but not while flying the craft,"" I countered. ""The drinking was before. It was… liquid courage, the best kind,"" I added.

She was not amused.

""Mr. Roberts, I’m fining you fifteen hundred dollars for DUI, suspending your license for six months, and mandating you attend alcohol awareness classes every Saturday for the next three months.""

""Yes, ma'am,"" I sighed.

""And Mr. Roberts?"" she added, her voice dropping a notch. ""The next time you want to go chasing UFOs, perhaps do it sober?""

They let me out that afternoon. Carol, my neighbor who had kindly agreed to post my bail, picked me up. She didn't say much on the drive back. She just shook her head and sighed the kind of sigh that says a whole, multi-chapter paragraph about disappointment.

When she dropped me off, I stood in my yard looking at my house. It was off-level again. The cinder blocks had shifted while I was gone, naturally.

I went inside, grabbed a beer, and sat down on my crooked porch.

The UFO situation bothered me. Not the abduction part. Not the crash. The fact that nobody believed me.

They’d gone out to Miller’s field, alright. The sheriff’s office, state police, and even some FAA folks. They’d looked at the saucer, taken pictures, scraped samples of alien gunk, then covered it with a tarp, loaded it onto a flatbed truck, and hauled it away. Henderson said they were calling it ""experimental aircraft"". Said the investigation was ongoing. Said I should probably just forget about it.

But what was I supposed to do? The government had the spacecraft. I didn't have proof. And even if I did, who in God’s name would believe Billy Bob Roberts?

The sun was setting over Hickory Ridge, painting the quiet woods in orange and purple. Crickets chirped, and the far-off rumble of trucks on Route 9 was a comforting, familiar sound. Somewhere up there, circling in the stars, those gray bastards were still watching. Still grabbing folks when they felt like a little afternoon dissection.

But that wasn't my immediate problem anymore. I'd escaped. I'd survived. I'd even given them the finger on my way out.

My ribs still hurt like a son-of-a-gun from the crash. Dr. Patel said I’d cracked at least two of them and that I was lucky I hadn't punctured a lung. He’d also told me my liver numbers were ""alarming"" and that I should really cut back on the drinking.

I took another long sip of beer.

The jack under my house let out a long, protesting groan. One of these days, that whole desperate setup was gonna collapse completely. But not today.

I finished my beer, cracked open another one. My knee popped like cheap fireworks. My ribs ached. My mouth still had those new, interesting gaps where I'd lost teeth.

But I was alive. And I had stories.

A light moved across the sky. Just a satellite, probably. Or maybe it was them.

I raised my beer to the stars. ""Come back anytime, boys,"" I said out loud, my voice carrying in the dark. ""Next time, I'll be ready""

Somewhere in the woods, something bleated. The Goat Man, probably.

I smiled. Hickory Ridge was a strange, messy place. Goat-men in the woods. Mole-men in the tunnels. Aliens in the sky. And me, Billy Bob Roberts, right in the middle of it all, constantly getting my ass kicked and living to tell the increasingly unbelievable tale.

The house groaned again, a sick, settling sound. I'd have to fix that mess tomorrow.

But tomorrow was tomorrow. Tonight, I had beer, I had a porch, and I had the simple, rock-solid satisfaction of knowing I’d escaped from actual aliens.

1ohlzd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ohlzd7/my_wife_packs_my_lunch_every_morning_and_i_feel/,My wife packs my lunch every morning and I feel weirdly guilty going out with coworkers,"My wife started packing my lunch about 6 months ago. She works from home and I guess she just started doing it one day and it became our thing. She gets up a little earlier, makes me coffee, packs this really nice lunch with like actual thought put into it. Sometimes theres a little note in there which honestly makes my whole day.

The thing is, my coworkers go out to lunch probably 3 times a week. Before this I'd go with them all the time, no big deal. But now when they ask I feel this weird guilt? Like my wife put effort into making me food and I'm just gonna let it sit in the fridge and go drop $15 on chipotle instead.

Last week I went out with them twice and I literally took my lunch home both days and ate it for dinner. My wife noticed and asked why I wasn't eating the lunches and I tried to explain but it came out weird. She laughed and said I should just go out when I want, that she doesn't mind. But I DO mind somehow? Like it feels wrong now.

The logical part of my brain knows its also saving us money which is nice since were trying to build up our savings, but thats not even really why I feel bad. I just dont want her to think I dont appreciate what shes doing because I really do. Its become one of my favorite parts of being married to her honestly.

Anyone else have something like this where your spouse does something thoughtful and it accidentally made you feel obligated in a good way?",118,1761588855.0,Marriage,44,0.95,False
