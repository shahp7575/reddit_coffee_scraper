I’m not here for romance or flings, just friendships built on respect, kindness, and a bit of sarcasm.

Fitness keeps me grounded—whether it’s the gym, a solid workout, or outrunning my excuses on a morning run. I also love traveling, not for the miles but for the stories (and snacks) along the way.

I especially enjoy connecting with people a little older than me—I value your experiences, perspectives, and humor.

If you’re easygoing, love good conversations, and can switch between deep talks and silly memes, let’s connect. Life’s too short for drama—let’s keep it real and fun.",1,1758855067.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

1nqq4dz,https://i.redd.it/4b36wbfgafrf1.jpeg,Spark Waves with Kindness,"Paying for a coffee, sharing a smile, or offering a genuine compliment can brighten someone’s day and inspire them to pass it on. That’s the magic of kindness: it grows and multiplies far beyond the moment.

Science agrees, kindness floods our brains with feel-good chemicals that lift mood, ease stress, and strengthen our hearts and minds. It fuels a positive cycle, benefiting both giver and receiver. Whether in the workplace or across cultures, kindness builds trust, connection, and community.

Don’t forget self-kindness, it’s just as vital. Treat yourself with care and patience, and you’ll find resilience and compassion blossoming within, ready to share with the world.

Kindness doesn’t demand wealth, time, or status. It lives in the smallest gestures that ripple outward, unseen but powerful. Start today, one act of kindness could change a life, and maybe even change the world.",1,1758854837.0,Word_of_The_Day_Affir,0,1.0,False
1nqq3ir,https://i.redd.it/ladfymx8afrf1.jpeg,I am in severe gem-nancial disarray,"To preface, I consider myself a light spender. I bought 2 rewards cards, 2 battle passes, and the first platinum set. Because of this, I was planning on slowly accruing gems to pull on most limited characters, but only A0s and no weapons. 

Unfortunately, that dream ended today.

Here I was, with around 50k gems. I was sitting pretty, good for the foreseeable future. Now, S. Closer’s banner pops up, and seeing as I already pulled for Marian, Phoebe, and Chord, she would be the last piece of the insane DPS team puzzle. I also only had A0 Riko, so it would be great to get her some dupes. Now, here’s where the fun begins.

I go to hard pity and get Ryuji. Not terrible, I didn’t pull for Queen so he’s my assassin until Kasumi, which means it’s a pretty good outcome. At least I didn’t get another copy of Riddle (trigger warning).

Dejectedly, I go to full pity for S. Closer. Nice, I can stop here now that I got her A0. I have no plans to get her weapon. But wait, I think I forgot someone….oh, right! Riko! How many copies did I get of her?

One. I got one (1) dupe of Riko. Utterly tragic.

Now, hear me out. What if I just went to 70/80, build up pity for the next limited character I wanted, AND get some Riki’s while I’m at it? Foolproof plan, right?

Right?

Well, I go to 69/70. No Rikos. At this point I was questioning if she really was a rate up. Oh well, let’s just hit 70 and finish building pity. We can always get Riko later.

70/80 hit, and out pops an S. Closer.

Damn it, there goes my pity. Well, at least A1 S. Closer isn’t bad. In fact, it’s pretty good. And now, I learned my lesson. Don’t gamble for pity and end up regretting it. 

Nope, that wasn’t the lesson. The lesson was that 70/80 was the limit.

I kept pulling, praying for Rikos and praying for the absence of S. Closer. I get to 22/80, and what do you know

TRIGGER WARNING! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

>!A wild Riddle appeared!!<

Hey, this isn’t all bad! I got an early pity, and now I can save up for Futaba! I was going to get S. Moko, but I lost quite a few gems so far, so oh well.

There’s one thing I forgot to mention: I skip signing Merope’s paper so I don’t get spoiled for a 5 star. I like to be a true gambler.

And so, within the 10 pull of >!Riddle!<, guess who else shows up? S. Closer, at the 28/80. I got my first double 5 star pull. But most importantly, it reset that pity.

Now, I was left with an A2 S. Closer, a nasty >!Riddle!<, a Ryuji, and…only 1 Riko dupe? What happened???

Here I was, with an A2 S. Closer, and an A2 Riko. Tell me it ain’t so.

Well, whatever. I decide to stop there. A3 S. Closed is the skill upgrade, so it isn’t worth it to chase that. I was left with a little hole in my heart, and a bigger one in my gem count.

But wait! It says 2/80 on the banner! I can’t let that slide, my OCD would never settle for that! And so, I did single pulls until I got to 10/80. I didn’t feel like skipping these, I needed to wallow in my despair.

But then, the 10th pull hit, and Merope pulled out a paper with…purple rainbow sparkles? Huh?

I sign the paper with a “Ann pls” and out pops…you guessed it, S. Closer. I had an A3 S. Closer, and an A2 Riko. You wouldn’t believe it unless you saw it.

Now I was pissed. Here I was with a stinky A3 S. Closer and an A2 Riko. At this point, I realized that this was the closest I’d ever get to an A6, and so, I let the gamba mentality take me over. I did a Zevai and rage pulled all the way to hard pity.

I got a Mona. A3 Mona. I was heartbroken. But on the bright side, I hit my A6 Riko!

And now, I pulled yet another Zevai and rage pulled all the way to a hard pity for S. Closer. No way was I sitting on A3 when A6 is RIGHT THERE. And now, she’s at A4.

Honestly, at this point, I’d consider myself pretty lucky. Sure, I lost 2 hard pities, but I also got an early 70/80, a 30/80 (along with >!The Rizzler!<) and a 10/80. I just needed to pray to RNJesus to give me the last 2 50/50 wins.

I had just enough gems left now for a pity and a half. I had a nearly empty gem wallet, but a big dream.

I did all the preparations: I watched the fireworks again with Motoha, I opened the contracts menu on that beach, and I silently prayed in my room. Then, I gambled. I gambled with my life on the line. 

And wouldn’t you know it, I won the first 50/50! A5 S. Closer came home! Now I had enough for about 20 pulls. Those 20 pulls came and went, with nothing to show for them.

Now, I was desperate. I calculated the gems I’d get from the remaining 27 days on the banner, and it came out to about 9,000 gems. Would that be enough? Even if I won the pity it wouldn’t be. I’m already at A5, I can’t let this slip by, even if I lose the 50/50. I NEEDED (infinite emphasis on needed) the A6. I’d do whatever it took.

It was at this point in which I fell into the hands of Black Wings and Sega while they had me by the balls.

I couldn’t wait that long just to lose the 50/50 and regret it forever. I decided I’d graduate from a light spender to a filthy whale. I pulled out the Visasan Black (iykyk) and swiped for the second platinum set, the rewards card, the seven day spoils pass, and the 1500+1500 cognite gems (because this would give me the most value with 26 tickets + 60 coffees). 

That wouldn’t be enough, though. I was sitting at 78/80. I thought about buying some more, but then realized I hadn’t finished the velvet trials yet! What a saving grace, I got my last 2 pulls in gems!

Now, I was scared. Really scared. I spent about $50 on this banner alone, and I didn’t want that all to go to waste on an A5. Sure, I could wait for the cognite shards, but who wants to sit on A5 for a full year? Not me. I’m not a sucker.

I pulled once. Nothing. I was at 79/80. It was the last chance. I pressed the button, and signed with the best damn drawing of S. Closer’s hat that I could ever possibly draw, and prayed hard. Then…she came home. I got my first and last A6.

In the end, the total damage was about 590 pulls, or 88,500 gems. This equates to about 7.3 hard pities, so in total, I technically won 5/6 of my hard pities. I’d consider that pretty lucky, given that I heard some people losing 50/50s back to back on banners.

Now, my S. Moko and Haru dream is gone, reduced to ashes. But, with the gem calculator tool somewhere on the internet, I was able to see that I could comfortably save for Futaba, Kasumi, CNY Rin, and Ange, all characters originally in my plan. Everything is good in the world, I have an A6, and my future pulls are still saved.

Now, this may not have been the best A6 to go for. Sure, I’m getting Kasumi, another Bless unit. Sure, Haru is probably a better sweeper than S. Closer. Sure, she doesn’t see much use in SoS or Guild Boss in TW/CN in the future. 

I don’t care. I’m happy with my easy auto team, and I’m happy with her aesthetics (Yes, I know she’s a high school girl, and yes I know it’s weird. It’s a drawing, get over it and go talk to some real women.)

Let this be a lesson to everyone to pull for what makes you happy, or let the gamba take over and empty your wallet. Whatever lets you sleep at night.

I’m not a whale, I just got lucky.

Rent, utilities, Wi-Fi, random Target runs, even just setting up a basic dorm/apartment, it all stacks up like a whole extra course on top of the actual ones.

Back home I watched family get buried in credit card debt, so I’ve always been cautious. Now I’m here trying to keep track of coffees, snacks between lectures, textbooks that cost way more than I expected, groceries, and a new AEP power bill I didn’t even think about when planning. Living on my own is giving me the independence I wanted, but my budget already feels stretched thin.

I’m trying to stick to a budget and I know building credit matters, but I really don’t want to dig myself into a hole before freshman year is even over. A couple people mentioned debit cards that build credit, where you’re only spending what you already have but it still reports to the bureaus. That honestly sounds more my speed while I’m still figuring this out. Has anyone here actually used one? Did it help your score? Any hidden fees or downsides I should watch out for?

Also looking for local tips. What’s the best way Hokies keep utilities down once it gets cold? Any internet setups in Blacksburg that don’t suck but also aren’t overpriced? For groceries do most people lean Kroger, Food Lion, or Aldi? And what’s the move for textbooks besides the VT Bookstore or Amazon?

Right now I’m mostly walking or taking Blacksburg Transit with my Hokie Passport to avoid Uber costs, cooking more instead of always hitting downtown, and trying to give myself a weekly cap for “fun” money so I don’t burn through cash too quickly.

1nqpytv,https://i.redd.it/ovzx39na8frf1.png,"For fifteen years, my husband Dustin and I were the fairytale","For fifteen years, my husband Dustin and I were the fairytale. The high school sweethearts who made it, the tech CEO and his devoted wife. Our life was perfect.

Then a text message arrived from an unknown number. It was a picture of his assistant's hand on his thigh in the suit pants I bought him.



The texts from his mi\*\*ress kept coming after that, a relentless barrage of poison. She sent photos of them in our bed and a video of him promising to leave me. She bragged that she was pr\*\*nant with his child.



He'd come home and k\*\*s me, call me his anchor, all while smelling of her perfume. He was buying her a condo and planning their future while I pretended to have morning sickness from bad scallops.



The final straw came on my birthday. She sent a picture of him on one knee, giving her a diamond promise ring.



So I didn't cry. I secretly changed my name to Hope, converted our entire fortune into untraceable bearer bonds, and told a charity to empty our house of everything.



The next day, as he headed to the airport for a""business trip"" to Paris with her, I flew to Portugal. When he came home, he found an empty mansion, divorce papers, and our wedding rings melted into a single, shapeless lump of gold.



Chapter 1



I remembered the first time Dustin touched my ch\*\*t. We were sixteen, crammed into the back of his dad's old Ford, fogging up the windows.



He was all nervous hands and shaky breaths, fumbling with the clasp of my b\*a like he was trying to solve a puzzle in the dark.



I finally had to reach back and unhook it for him. He went beet red, even in the faint moonlight, and stammered an apology.



It was funny. It was sweet.



For fifteen years, he was the only one. The boy who couldn't unhook a b\*a became the tech CEO who graced magazine covers.



To the world, we were the fairytale. The high school sweethearts who made it. Eliana and Dustin Powell. A brand. A testament to enduring love in a fast-paced world.



Our life was perfect.



Until it wasn't.



The text message arrived on a Tuesday. An unknown number.



It was just a picture, no words.



A woman's hand, nails painted a garish shade of pink, resting on a man's thigh. The hand was slender, young. Too young.



The thigh was clad in dark gray suit pants I recognized instantly. I'd bought them for him. Tom Ford. For his thirty-second birthday.



On the woman's wrist was a delicate gold bracelet with a single, tiny shark tooth.



I felt the air leave my lungs.



That bracelet. I'd seen it before.



On the wrist of Jami Salinas, his executive assistant. She'd flashed it at the company's summer party, her smile a little too bright, her eyes lingering on me a little too long.



My heart started a frantic, painful rhythm against my ribs.



It couldn't be.



But it was.



My first impulse was to scream. To throw my phone against the wall. To call him and demand an explanation for the image burning itself into my brain.



I didn't.



I took a deep, shuddering breath and forced the rage down. I stared at the photo until the details blurred, until the sickness in my stomach became a cold, hard knot.



Was any of it real? Our fifteen years? The boy in the back of the Ford? The man who ki\*\*ed me goodbye this morning?



The next day, I drove to the county courthouse. The building was old and smelled of dust and stale coffee.



I walked to the clerk's office, my steps even and measured.



""I'd like to file a petition for a name change,"" I told the woman behind the counter.



She looked up, her glasses perched on the end of her nose. ""For what reason?""



""Personal reasons,"" I said, my voice flat.



She raised an eyebrow, taking in my clothes, my bag. I was Eliana Powell, wife of a billionaire. Women like me didn't just change their names.



""Are you in danger? Is this related to domestic abuse?""



""No,"" I said. The lie tasted like ash, but it was a necessary one. This wasn't about danger. It was about erasure. ""I just want a new name.""



""What name did you have in mind?""



""Hope,"" I said, the word feeling foreign on my tongue. ""Hope Tillman."" Tillman was my mother's maiden name. A name that belonged to me, and me alone.



The clerk typed for a moment. ""And you are currently Eliana David Powell?""



""Eliana David,"" I corrected her. I had never taken his name. It was a point of pride once. Now, it was a convenience. ""My legal name is Eliana David.""



""The process will take a few weeks. You'll have to post a notice, attend a hearing.""



""I understand,"" I said. ""Please begin the process.""



She stamped the papers with a loud thud. Each stamp felt like a nail in the coffin of my old life.



Hope. A name for a future I couldn't yet see, but one I would build for myself, brick by painful brick.



The plan formed in my mind with chilling clarity. A new name. A new passport. A new life. Far away from here. Portugal. The Algarve coast. I'd always wanted to photograph the sea caves there.



I got the new social security card first. It came in a plain white envelope. Hope Tillman. It looked like a stranger's name.



I kept my old driver's license. A reminder of the ghost I was preparing to leave behind.



That night, I saw him on TV. He was at a charity gala, looking impossibly handsome in his tuxedo.



The reporter asked him about his success. He smiled that charming, public smile.



He held up his left hand, flashing the simple gold band I'd placed on his finger a decade ago. ""My biggest success is my wife, Eliana. She's my anchor.""



The crowd applauded. The reporter swooned.



""She's the best thing that ever happened to me.""



I watched the screen, my face a blank mask. The words meant nothing. They were just sounds, empty air. The man on the screen was a stranger performing a role.



My anchor. He was the storm, and I was the ship he was sinking.



The next morning, I took our wedding rings to a jeweler in a town an hour away. Not a fancy place, just a small, dusty shop run by an old man with a jeweler's loupe permanently attached to his eye.



I placed my ring and Dustin's matching band on the velvet tray. ""I want them melted.""



A sharp pain shot through my hand, as if the ring was still there, burning my skin. I clenched my fist.



""Melted?"" the old man asked, peering at the rings. ""These are fine pieces. 18-karat gold.""



""I know what they are,"" I said. ""Melt them. Together. Into a single, shapeless lump.""



He looked from the rings to my face, his expression unreadable. ""Are you sure, miss? This is... permanent.""



""Yes,"" I said, my voice unwavering. ""I'm sure.""



He shrugged and took the rings to the back. I waited, listening to the hum of the polishing wheel and the frantic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner.



An hour later, he returned with a small, gray velvet box.



Inside, resting on the white satin, was a lump of gold. It was ugly. Deformed. All the perfect circles and polished shine were gone, fused into an unrecognizable mass.



It was perfect.



He came home late that night, long after I'd hidden the small box in my closet. He brought me a bouquet of white lilies, my favorite.



""For my beautiful wife,"" he said, ki\*\*ing my cheek.



He smelled of her. That same cloying, fruity perfume Jami always wore.



I didn't pull away. I just stood there, a statue in his arms.



As he moved past me into the kitchen, I saw it. A faint red mark on his neck, just above his collar. A love bite. Sloppy. Careless.



Did you have fun at your ""late meeting,"" Dustin? I wanted to ask. Did you enjoy her young, eager body in your office?



But I said nothing. The time for questions was over.



He wrapped his arms around my waist from behind, pulling me against him. ""I missed you today.""



I felt a wave of nausea. The touch of his hands on my skin felt like a violation.



I gently pushed him away. ""I'm tired, Dustin.""



Chapter 2



""Tired?"" He sounded surprised. ""Is everything okay, Eli?""



""Just a long day,"" I lied, moving towards the stairs.



""Well, let me make it better,"" he said, his voice dropping to a low, su\*\*estive purr. He followed me, his hand reaching for mine.



I flinched away from his touch.



He stopped, a flicker of something-annoyance? confusion?-in his eyes. ""Okay. I get it. I've been working a lot. Let's have a date night tomorrow. Just the two of us. We can go to that place you love, the one by the coast.""



""Fine,"" I said.



He smiled, relieved. ""Great. I have a surprise for you, too.""



""I have one for you, as well,"" I said, thinking of the gray velvet box upstairs.



His smile widened. ""Oh yeah? Is it my birthday already?""



The question was a bitter joke. My own birthday had been last week. He'd forgotten. Sent a text from a meeting in Tokyo. 'Happy bday, babe. Super busy. Celebrate when I'm back.' He never mentioned it again.



""No,"" I said. ""Just because.""



He came closer, trying to k\*\*s me. I turned my head, and his lips met my cheek.



""Okay,"" he said, pulling back, looking a little hurt. ""I'll see you in the morning.""



I lay in bed that night, staring at the ceiling, listening to his steady breathing beside me. This was a performance now. The last act of a long-running play. And I knew my lines.



The next evening, he was all charm, holding the car door open for me, his hand on the small of my back.



He chattered the whole way to the restaurant, talking about a new deal, a difficult board member, a rival company's failure. I made the right noises, nodding and smiling in the right places.



As he pulled into the valet line, something on the passenger side floor caught my eye. A single, long, blonde hair.



Jami's hair.



I looked at it, then looked away. I didn't pick it up. I didn't point it out.



There was no point in fighting anymore. You don't argue with a ghost. And he was already a ghost to me.



The restaurant was where he'd proposed. Perched on a cliff overlooking the ocean, the waves crashing below. It was supposed to be our place.



Tonight, it would be the place where it all ended.



As we walked in, a woman at a nearby table gasped. ""Oh my God, it's Dustin Powell!""



He gave her a gracious nod, the tech king in his element.



He'd just called work, a ""quick emergency."" He stood a few feet away, his back to me, his voice low and urgent.



""I'm sorry, baby, I have to step out,"" he said, turning back to me, his face a mask of regret. ""Something's come up at the office. A server farm in quadrant four is down. It's a mess.""



""Go,"" I said.



""I'll be so quick. Twenty minutes, tops. Don't you move, okay? Order us a bottle of the good stuff."" He winked.



A woman at the next table sighed dreamily. ""He's so dedicated. And so in love with his wife.""



I knew where he was going. He wasn't talking to his head of engineering. He was talking to Jami. The ""server farm"" was her apartment. The ""emergency"" was her.



I went back to the car. I told the valet I'd forgotten my wrap.



His second phone, the one he thought I didn't know about, was in the glove compartment. It was unlocked.



The texts were right there.



Jami: 'Heard you're on a date with the old lady. Boring.'



Dustin: 'Have to keep up appearances. Be there in 10. Wear that red thing I like.'



Jami: 'Hurry up. I have a surprise for you.'



Then a photo. Jami, pouting at the camera, wearing a red lace teddy. On the nightstand behind her was a small, blue box from Tiffany's.



My stomach churned. I felt a violent, visceral need to throw up. The perfectly cooked scallops I'd just eaten threatened to make a reappearance.



He came back twenty-five minutes later, looking pleased with himself. ""All handled. See? Told you I'd be quick.""



I forced a smile, the muscles in my face protesting.



""Are you okay?"" he asked, seeing my pale face. ""You look a little green.""



""Just... the scallops,"" I managed to say. ""Maybe they were a bit off.""



""That's it,"" he said, his face darkening. ""I'm going to have a word with the manager. This place has gone downhill.""



""No, Dustin, don't,"" I said. ""It's fine.""



He looked at me, his brow furrowed. ""You know, I was thinking about what you said. About my birthday. I know I forgot yours. I'm a j\*\*k. I'm so sorry, Eli.""



The apology, so late, so hollow, hung in the air between us.



""I'm going to make it up to you,"" he said, his voice earnest. ""I promise.""



I thought of the red lace teddy. The Tiffany box. The server farm in quadrant four.



I felt the vomit rise in my throat. I stumbled out of my chair and ran for the bathroom, barely making it to the stall before I was sick.



Chapter 3



I stayed in the bathroom for a long time, splashing cold water on my face, my reflection a pale, haunted stranger in the mirror.



Dustin was waiting for me, his face etched with concern. ""Are you sure you're okay? We can go home.""



How could he be so good at this? The lies, the performance. A part of me wondered if he even knew he was doing it anymore. If the line between the loving husband and the cheating ba\*\*ard had blurred so much in his own mind that he couldn't see it.



The cool night air on the drive home cleared my head. The nausea subsided, replaced by a cold, clear calm.



""I'm feeling better,"" I said, as he pulled into the garage.



""Good,"" he said, his hand on my knee. ""Because I still have that surprise for you.""



""Tomorrow,"" I said. ""Let's do surprises tomorrow.""



He looked disappointed but nodded. ""Okay. Tomorrow.""



A wicked little idea sparked in my mind. A final, parting shot.



""Actually,"" I said, turning to him. ""I've been thinking. You're right. We need more time together. Why don't you take tomorrow off? We can spend the whole day together. Here. At home.""



He looked surprised. Then a little panicked. A whole day. A whole day he couldn't sneak away to see Jami.



""I... I don't know, Eli. I have that big presentation...""

1nqpxzt,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nqpxzt/advicesuggestions_for_coffee_machine_upgrade/,Advice/suggestions for coffee machine upgrade [$800-$1200],"Hi everyone,

Go easy on me here - big time novice here. I'm looking to upgrade my current espresso machine (Smeg ECF01. I know...) and would prefer to spend between $800-1200 but have found the million and one variables and considerations leaving me with analysis paralysis.

Machines I'm looking at/considering:

Profitec GO

Ascaso Steel Uno

Quick Mill Pippa

Breville Dual Boiler

I realise these machines aren't all in the same class but am hoping to get opinions on value for what I'm after.

Factors at play:

Wife and I drink 1-2 coffees a day on average. We're pretty on the go and value expediency and a low-fuss process, so a long heat-up time or super-finicky transition from brewing to steaming is not optimal. A roughly even mix of black/white coffees so steaming is relevant. Aesthetics are important to us, which is why I've shortlisted the above for reference (Breville not as much, but the new Sea Salt variant looks ok and potentially good value). Minimal detailing, refined materials/touches etc. Essentially anything is an upgrade for us in terms of the quality of the espresso pulled so I'd be willing to compromise on that point (a little) if it meant getting a machine we like the look of that doesn't require too much tinkering or fuss on each use. Keen to dial a machine in and have fun with it don't get me wrong, but not looking to spend ages in the kitchen making coffee either.

I have a 1zpresso X-Ultra manual grinder which I'm happy with so just need a solid machine to go with it. if there are any other machines you'd suggest, hit me!

No matter how much I think about it, I seem to forget all the little details that really matter to people. I want to give gifts that feel personal and thoughtful, but often I end up second-guessing myself or buying something generic that I think might be safe. Even when I try to pay attention during conversations, I forget what someone mentioned last week or last month, and it can be frustrating.

Over the years, I’ve tried a few different methods to stay organized. I used to jot down small notes on my phone whenever someone mentioned a favorite snack, a hobby, or a restaurant they liked. I even made a few spreadsheets to keep track of birthdays, favorite colors, and other preferences. While these methods helped a little, they were often tedious to maintain and hard to keep updated. I would either forget to write something down or lose track of the details. Sometimes I would think I remembered, only to realize I completely forgot the person’s favorite coffee shop when it came time to pick a gift.

Recently, I started looking for ways to make this easier, and I discovered that there are tools that can help organize and even suggest gifts based on the information you already know about someone. I started experimenting with one that takes the small details you have about friends and family and generates ideas for gifts or places to take them for a meal. It doesn’t replace the thought you put into the gift, but it helps make the process less stressful and makes it easier to remember the little things that make a gift meaningful.

What I have found so far is that this approach works best when you combine it with paying attention to your friends’ interests. For example, if someone mentions they like a specific type of chocolate or that they recently enjoyed a certain restaurant, adding that information into the tool makes it more likely that the suggestions will actually resonate with them. I’ve found that the gifts I pick with this method feel more personal, and my friends actually notice the thoughtfulness. It also reduces the anxiety of worrying that I might forget something important or pick something generic that won’t be appreciated.

I’m curious how others handle this problem. Do you have a system for remembering the small preferences of the people you care about? Do you rely on notes, memory, or some kind of tool? I would love to hear your tips and tricks. Even with the help of AI or tools, there is something about the human touch in gift-giving that cannot be replaced, but having a little assistance makes the whole process much smoother and more enjoyable. I’m always looking for new ways to improve, and it would be great to learn from the strategies other people use to make their gifts feel more personal and thoughtful.

Would not wish it on my worst enemy. I started to get a bit better with PPIs 2/day (Omperazole) and then because of my obsession with the condition/nervousness I went on Prozac. At first it got worse, and then after awhile it more or less cured my symptoms. To be clear I still SHOULD stay away from coffee, spicy foods, wings, pasta sauce, alcohol, etc. and my chest will burn if I choose not to but it’s night and day from where I was.

I do not have any silent reflux symptoms or feelings of being bloated or full. It’s not impacting my quality of life either…just a weird slight pain that’s around for most of the day.

I'm probably out of touch so feel free to help me with the math.

I saw that Starbucks has an average revenue of $3,800 per store daily in the US. Let's say baristas make $15/hour, there are 4 workers in a shift, and 3 shifts through the day. If I order one drink, the cost is probably $5 to $7. A basic $1 tip is 14% to 20%, which is on par for tipping at a sit-down restaurant, so that seems out of line for a retail drink.

Looking at it another way - as to the hourly income for the baristas. Say sales revenue is $3,800 for the day. Let's say a bunch of people don't tip but others do 15%, so maybe an average of 5% for the day. That's $190 of tips for the day. Divided by the 12 barista shifts (4 workers x 3 shifts), that's $16 to each barista.Spread over an 6-hour shift, that's $2.67/hour additional wages, or 18% increase over their base.

The $16 to each barista for a whole shift doesn't seem like a lot, but 18% increase over their base seems heavy. And me paying 15% on a single drink seems excessive. The other hard part is that 99% of the time is to-go, so I won't know until later if the drink is even correct.

So what about quick-service like Chipotle or Qdoba? A meal is about $9-$12. A basic $1 tip is 8% to 11%, which is less than sit-down. Like the coffee, I order to-go so don't find out until I get home whether they gave a weak or hefty scoop of meat.

So coming to the end of this thesis, I arrive at two conflicting notions. On one hand, I like to be nice, and tipping ""fits"" with being nice. However, unless I start dealing in nickels, the tipping system is distorted relative to the product purchased. Nevermind that it's a distortion supported by restaurant owners so they can keep the sticker prices lower and not have to pay employer costs (e.g. payroll taxes) on the tips.

If anyone has more specific numbers for any of these, I'd love to hear it.",0,1758854029.0,Omaha,2,0.5,False
1nqpun2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1nqpun2/a_year_without_tiktok_a_personal_review/,A Year Without TikTok: A Personal Review,"(Yesterday, I posted `How I uninstalled TikTok and keep it away for a year`. I see there are many views. I'd like to write some more. Hope this helps.)

I didn’t delete TikTok because I’m above it. I deleted it because I wasn’t. My thumb learned a path my brain didn’t approve of: unlock → swipe → neon slot machine. I’d open it to watch one cooking hack, and surface forty-five minutes later wondering why I was watching a man in Norway fold towels with one hand. That would’ve been fine if it happened once a week. It was happening daily.

The moment I finally quit wasn’t dramatic—no digital epiphany, no documentary. I was microwaving cold coffee at 9:10 a.m., standing in the kitchen, half-listening to a coworker on a call, and realized I’d opened TikTok without looking at my phone. Muscle memory had beaten intention. That scared me more than screen time numbers did. I held the icon until it wiggled and tapped delete. I felt a weird flash of grief, like ending a fun but chaotic friendship.

### Week 1: Withdrawal (and Phantom Thumb Syndrome)

The first week sucked. My hand kept doing that unconscious reach during micro-boredom: elevator rides, toast popping, waiting for a file to upload. I’d feel a pulse of anticipation, a little dopamine flare, and then nothing. That gap was loud. I wasn’t calmer. I was twitchy.

I replaced the itch with friction:

- I gave my Screen Time passcode to a friend and asked not to give it back without a 24-hour delay.
- I blocked the App Store after 9 p.m. and added a content filter to stop TikTok’s site from loading.
- I removed Instagram and YouTube from the home screen, because my brain is lazy and will take whatever is nearest. I didn’t want to replace one slot machine with another.

I also made a “boredom menu” on a sticky note:

- Ten push-ups
- Make tea
- Read three pages of a book
- Wipe the counter
- Go outside for two minutes
- Text someone I like

It felt corny. It also worked.

### Month 1: System > Willpower

By week three, the automatic reach faded. What helped most wasn’t grit; it was architecture.

- I turned my phone black-and-white at night. It’s ridiculous how much less interesting the world is in grayscale.
- I made my home screen boring: calendar, notes, weather. The App Library did the rest.
- I installed a browser extension that kills short-form video feeds. If I try to watch YouTube Shorts, it loads a breathing exercise instead. It’s hilarious and maddening.
- I set a five-minute timer for “just checking something.” If I exceed it, my phone goes to Do Not Disturb via a shortcut. It gamified my own tendency to drift.

What surprised me was how much those small barriers changed the feel of my day. The “gap moments” got quieter. I still wanted quick hits, but I learned to sit through the first 60 seconds of craving and it would pass. That was new.

### What Filled the Space (and What Didn’t)

Truthfully, nothing filled the TikTok slot perfectly, because the slot itself—constant variable reward—was the problem.

- I tried replacing it with longer videos. That backfired. Long videos scratched the same itch, just less efficiently.
- Reading worked, but only if the book was easy and nearby. I started keeping a paperback in the kitchen.
- Podcasts were perfect for chores. My sink became a podcast-only zone. If my hands got sudsy, I didn’t scroll.
- Walking without headphones mattered more than I expected. The first silent walks felt itchy and dull. By month two, they felt like a reboot.

The biggest gain was attention. Not hours; attention. I could read ten pages without flipping to another tab in my mind. I didn’t realize how shredded my focus had gotten until it started to come back.

### Social FOMO, Trends, and Not Knowing the Sound Everyone’s Using

I missed things. Friends referenced audio clips and I smiled like I got it. I didn’t. The world didn’t end. I saw the best stuff later on group chats or in articles. The half-life of trends is short, and missing the front wave didn’t change my life.

The one real downside: if your work or humor leans on constant cultural riffing, you feel slower. There were times a TikTok link landed in the chat and I just… didn’t click. I was both relieved and out of the loop. Mixed bag.

### Numbers I Actually Care About

- Average daily phone time dropped by about 45 minutes within two weeks. Not dramatic, but real.
- I fell asleep 20–30 minutes earlier most nights, which compounded fast.
- I read 12 books this year. Last year I read four.
- I took more midday walks—about 3–4 a week—because there wasn’t a quick-dopamine alternative when I hit a wall.
- My Sundays felt longer. Not objectively, but in that elastic way time feels when you don’t chop it into neon confetti.

### Temptations and Near-Misses

A few times, muscle memory and curiosity teamed up. I typed “tik” into the App Store search bar without thinking. Seeing my own fingers spell it out felt like watching someone else. That’s when the passcode rule mattered. Future Me always thanks Past Me for making reinstallation annoying.

I also noticed triggers:

- Finishing a hard task (I wanted a treat).
- Right after lunch (energy dip).
- Social anxiety before events (avoidance).

Preloading alternatives helped. I kept a playlist called “Stupidly Good” for post-task treats, and I had a standing rule: if I’m anxious, I call someone for two minutes or step outside. It sounds earnest. It works.

### Honest Downsides

- I missed spontaneous discovery. TikTok’s algorithm is ridiculously good at showing you something you didn’t know you wanted. Books and podcasts are slower to surprise.
- I lost a quick way to find niche communities. There’s something unmatched about stumbling into “people who love grout cleaning” at 11 p.m. I found those communities elsewhere, but it took effort.
- I had to confront baseline boredom. It’s easier to be “the person who’s trying a dopamine detox” than to be a person who just sits on their own couch with their thoughts. I met some parts of myself I’d been drowning out. That’s both a con and a pro.

### What Came Back

- Idle thoughts. The kind where you remember a birthday before the reminder or get a weird idea for dinner. They needed silence to appear.
- Conversations. I interrupted people less. I noticed when my attention drifted and pulled it back.
- Taste. Without a firehose of clips telling me what to like, I got pickier and oddly more delighted by small things—one truly great essay, one perfect live performance, one dumb local event.

### Was It Worth It?

Yes. Not because TikTok is evil, but because it was too perfect at bypassing my intentions. The cost wasn’t the hours; it was that I outsourced my curiosity to an algorithm that thinks a little like me but louder. A year without it felt like turning the volume down to hear my own station again.

Will I ever reinstall? Maybe—for a project, for a season, as dessert, not dinner. But I don’t miss the autopilot.

### If You’re Considering It

- Build friction, not heroics: passcode with a friend, block the site, hide replacements.
- Replace the tap with a ritual: tea, walk, text, one page of reading. Keep it dumb and easy.
- Expect a noisy first week. That’s normal, not failure.
- Track one metric you actually care about (sleep, reading pages, steps), not just screen time.
- Accept that you’ll miss a few jokes. Most of them will come around again.

Anyways I asked her out on a date on a prompt that said I should ask her out by being direct and having a plan, which I responded to with a lunch date plan, she then matched with me and decided that it was a good idea and we should meet this weekend. But then we realised we're in the same college and decided that we might as well meet in college on a mini date where we just roam around for a bit, have something to eat before we go on an actual date.

So about the actual date... IT WENT ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC. Like it couldn't have gone any better for a first date, that to my first ever first date. So I wasn't hungry and neither was she so we settled on cold coffee only... And then we talked for an hour... Whenever it got awkward we just looked at each other and laughed... We talked a lot eventually... And then once we were out I gave her flowers (she mentioned she loved sunflowers and she got flowers from this one vendor so I went to that vendor to get her those flowers) and she was surprised, blushed a little cause she didn't expect it, and then I complimented on how good she looked, and then she blushed again and she's like I'm sorry I'm blushing like an idiot and I'm like It's okay because Ik I'm doing things right and she blushed again...we hugged a few times, then took photos, I even met her roomate cause she told her hostel roommates that she's going on a date and then I said bye. She also remarked on how good the date went and I smiled and told her that I was gonna pick her up on Saturday from her Hostel to take her out to Lunch.

The earth has spun forty-five times since I last saw you, and I’ve become an accountant of absence, a mathematician of missing. Sixteen revolutions since the last time I let myself scroll through your photos, thumb hovering over the screen as if I could touch the proof of us, hunting for evidence that you were real, that we were real. Every sunrise since has been a small rebellion; every sunset, an ache I swallow whole.

None since the last time I thought of you. Not a single hour that didn’t carry you. Not one that didn’t fold your name into the small rituals of my breathing. Morning coffee tastes like your laughter. Evening shadows wear the shape of your shoulders turning away. People call that obsessive. I call it a way of keeping you alive, a way of refusing to let love become archaeology.

Once, I counted days like a child counts sleeps until Christmas: how many more sunrises until I could see you again? Back then, our counts were synchronised. We didn’t measure alone. We tallied together. How many nights had you stayed at mine this week? How many mornings had I woken up in your much comfier bed? How many hours left of work before we’d be reunited again? The numbers weren’t burdens then, they were gifts. Weekends slipped through our fingers like quicksilver, vanishing before we even knew they’d begun. And instead of grief at their speed, we marvelled at how easily time bent for us, how it folded itself around our laughter and our silences until it became something unmeasurable. I’d once told you that it felt like time didn’t exist in our little bubble. 

Now I catalogue them as they slip farther away, each dawn another step into the country of no-you, each dusk a border crossed that I can’t uncross.

There was a world before you, black and white, straight lines and predictable weather.
There was a world with you, a technicolour explosion where even Tuesday afternoons could make me believe in forever.
And after you? Now I stand at the edge of what comes after, too afraid to begin mapping this new territory where your absence is the loudest thing in every room.

I tell myself what I should expect, what I deserve. Someone whose arithmetic matches mine, a soul who tallies the same lost mornings, the same moons watched without my hand to steal warmth from. But wishes are not ledgers. They’re lighter, and so much crueler. They float above facts like heat mirages, shimmering with possibility that evaporates the moment you reach for them.

Maybe I’d been counting long before I ever knew your name, a quiet, private countdown buried in my chest, waiting for the first time your eyes found mine. That timer began the moment I got lost in that impossible green. The green that held forests and filtered sunlight and some awful, sacred promise I didn’t know I was making.

The days blur now, watercolour bleeding at the edges. The echo of your laugh grows softer with each passing week, the exact pitch of your voice fading like old photographs left too long in sunlight. But those eyes, those eyes, remain sharp as broken glass, as clear as the moment they first cut through me. They are the stubborn thing I cannot set down, the one entry that will not balance out.

They are the ledger I keep by heart, the sum that adds up to everything I’ve lost and everything I refuse to stop counting. Your name has become the blood beating through my veins, you the sand in my hourglass. And I’m not ready, not yet, to stop measuring life by you.",2,1758853617.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,1,1.0,False

Every sunrise since has been a small rebellion; every sunset, an ache I swallow whole.

None since the last time I thought of you. Not a single hour that didn’t carry you. Not one that didn’t fold your name into the small rituals of my breathing. Morning coffee tastes like your laughter. Evening shadows wear the shape of your shoulders turning away. People call that obsessive. I call it a way of keeping you alive, a way of refusing to let love become archaeology.

Once, I counted days like a child counts sleeps until Christmas: how many more sunrises until I could see you again? Back then, our counts were synchronised. We didn’t measure alone. We tallied together. How many nights had you stayed at mine this week? How many mornings had I woken up in your much comfier bed? How many hours left of work before we’d be reunited again? The numbers weren’t burdens then, they were gifts. Weekends slipped through our fingers like quicksilver, vanishing before we even knew they’d begun. And instead of grief at their speed, we marvelled at how easily time bent for us, how it folded itself around our laughter and our silences until it became something unmeasurable. I’d once told you that it felt like time didn’t exist in our little bubble. 

Now I catalogue them as they slip farther away, each dawn another step into the country of no-you, each dusk a border crossed that I can’t uncross.

There was a world before you, black and white, straight lines and predictable weather.
There was a world with you, a technicolour explosion where even Tuesday afternoons could make me believe in forever.
And after you? Now I stand at the edge of what comes after, too afraid to begin mapping this new territory where your absence is the loudest thing in every room.

I tell myself what I should expect, what I deserve. Someone whose arithmetic matches mine, a soul who tallies the same lost mornings, the same moons watched without my hand to steal warmth from. But wishes are not ledgers. They’re lighter, and so much crueler. They float above facts like heat mirages, shimmering with possibility that evaporates the moment you reach for them.

Maybe I’d been counting long before I ever knew your name, a quiet, private countdown buried in my chest, waiting for the first time your eyes found mine. That timer began the moment I got lost in that impossible green. The green that held forests and filtered sunlight and some awful, sacred promise I didn’t know I was making.

The days blur now, watercolour bleeding at the edges. The echo of your laugh grows softer with each passing week, the exact pitch of your voice fading like old photographs left too long in sunlight. But those eyes, those eyes, remain sharp as broken glass, as clear as the moment they first cut through me. They are the stubborn thing I cannot set down, the one entry that will not balance out.

They are the ledger I keep by heart, the sum that adds up to everything I’ve lost and everything I refuse to stop counting. Your name has become the blood beating through my veins, you the sand in my hourglass. And I’m not ready, not yet, to stop measuring life by you.",1,1758853561.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
1nqpoyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1nqpoyk/i_25f_need_to_reconnect_with_an_old_ex_28m/,I (25F) need to reconnect with an old ex (28M)- desperately need advice.,"I had a very, very toxic short lived relationship with someone, let’s call him ‘Steve’ (28M).

I met Steve in 2022, and we started dating shortly after I had left a long term relationship of 3 years. I was very upfront about where I was at the time (probably a little more casual, but preferred to date one person at a time even w/o titles or whatever just so I can focus on getting to know someone) and he said he was totally cool with that. 

On our very first date I told him it was a boundary for me, and if he was more of a “cast a wide net” dater- that was totally okay but we should probably be friends. He assured me he was on board with the idea and we happily continued on. 

To save many, many paragraphs, here’s everything the next 4 months entailed:

 (Skip to ** if you don’t want to read allat)

- Cheated on me with his girl best friend and left evidence of said cheating in the center of his apartment, refused to move it as if it were a wonderful shrine. Girl bestie was also in her own, separate relationship with a guy of 8 months. 

- He got HSV after attending a rave, insisted it was “because he shared a water bottle with someone”. For those who don’t know, that has a ~0.000001% chance of being true, but hey, let’s give him the benefit of the doubt!

- Proceeded to lie about taking HSV medication to prevent spreading HSV to me. Said his Dr said it was “impossible” to transmit HSV when there is no break out. I am a nurse. This is not true.

- Had an insane porn addiction (5-7x/wk). We were intimate 2-3x/wk for reference. Refused to drop it.

- Never took care of me during intimacy or even asked to. Iykyk.

- Encouraged me to come to not one, but two, multi-day music festivals that costed ~$300-400 each, then told me within a day or two of each festival that he would prefer to just go with friends. I worked a minimum wage job at the same and would save up HEAVILY to be able to go, then would have to freak out and sell my tickets at insanely low prices to make back anything I could.

- Constantly made comments on my appearance and told me “how to look better”.

- Said I was “big for a girl” because I am 5’5. He is 5’7.

- Allowed (and took part in) his friends bullying me (berating, cyberstalking). I wish I could say I did something worthy of bullying- I never even met most of them.

- Caught him on dating apps and then he would lie and say he wasn’t (he would just find ways to hide it better). 

- Cheated on me again and then lied about it being SA. He openly admitted he lied about it being SA a week later (after I had spent a week comforting him and tending to his every need).

**

Ultimately- there is SO MUCH MORE but I don’t feel inclined to keep going. This guy was a total weirdo and if I wasn’t in such a vulnerable part of my life I probably would not have gone on a third date with the guy. 

He had a full speed run of trauma to unleash on me and three years later I am still struggling with trust issues, confidence issues, and allowing myself to fully love anyone or anything. 

In a very real sense- he ripped any innocence I had left at the time and I felt as though I had been dunked into the world’s sh*ttiest cold plunge of d*uche bags. 

I joke a lot here- but I wouldn’t talk so candidly in real life. 

Steve still lives in my town and I feel constant anxiety about running into him at local events or restaurants. Petrifying, fight or flight anxiety. I’ve tried therapy, opening up to loved ones, and journaling all the time. 

As much as I don’t like this guy, I think the only option I have left to get over this situation is to simply text him and ask him to meet for coffee or dinner. To face my fear head on and tell myself that he’s not this big, bad monster I’ve built him up to be in my head. He’s just another loser with a dangle cross earring. 

And no- I’m not planning on just berating the guy and throwing my drink in his face. I’m aiming for a casual conversation that will humanize him to me so I stop being so afraid of him.

QUESTION: 

How do I go about initiating contact? 
Suggestions for opening lines? 
Suggestions for location types (I.e; coffee shop, casual dinner, etc.)?

**

TLDR; How would you initiate contact with an ex who did a ton of sketchy, traumatic things to you, in hopes to better cope with the situation?

1nqpn2i,https://i.redd.it/qmntkwtt5frf1.png,"My brother's company went bankrupt, and I became the debt payment sent","Chapter 1

My brother's company went bankrupt, and I became the debt payment sent straight to Edward Pierce, the infamous big shot in Elarwyn that everyone feared.



Everyone thought I was just a helpless sacrifice, but only I knew the truth. This was a carefully orchestrated gamble I'd been plotting for ages.



I was betting that Edward still cherished our past, that I was still the unforgettable mark in his heart.



For three years, I clung to him like a parasitic vine, tiptoeing around him and always acting the part of the gentle, obedient lover.



That was until those two stark red lines showed up on the pregnancy test. When I nervously asked if he liked kids, he just said, ""No, they're a hassle. And having one out of wedlock is even more trouble."" His words hit me like a bucket of ice water, crushing every last bit of hope I had.



But I never expected that just when I thought I could finally start a new life, running away with the baby growing inside me, Edward would come after me like a madman.



He cornered me in a foreign land, eyes red with fury, jaw clenched tight. ""The debt's not settled yet. You think you can just run? Not a chance.""



I'd stayed by Edward's side for three years.



Back then, when my brother Michael Linley's company went bankrupt and owed Edward a fortune, I became the debt payment.



Or at least, that was what everyone else believed.



Back then, the succulent I'd been nurturing on the windowsill for half a year had just put out fresh, dazzling green shoots. Michael's eyes were rimmed red as he said, ""Sophia, I'm so sorry.""



I patted his hand and said softly, ""It's okay, Michael. I'll go.""



But deep down, only I knew that this was mostly my own choice, my plan.



I'd had a crush on Edward for years; ever since he was just a nobody, a fresh-faced kid trying to make it in the world, long before he became the big shot in Elarwyn who could call the shots and turn the tides with a single word.



For those three years, I lived in his penthouse that overlooked half of Elarwyn. I was like a pampered canary, carefully looked after but always kept in a gilded cage.



When Edward was in a good mood, he'd bring me along to some not-so-important private parties. He'd introduce me in a vague way, and everyone knew the score; nobody ever asked any questions.



But when Edward got busy, it was perfectly normal not to see him for ten days, even half a month.



That night, I was half-asleep when I heard the soft click of the bedroom door opening.



Then, his familiar scent, tinged with a trace of alcohol, drifted over me.



I knew he was back.



I stayed perfectly still, pretending to be sound asleep.



Edward seemed to stand by the bed for a while, then lifted the edge of the blanket and quietly slipped in beside me.



His slightly cool, damp arms pulled me in, his chin pressing lightly against the top of my head.



""You've been drinking again?"" I mumbled sleepily.



I could already smell the expensive liquor and cigarettes clinging to him.



""Yes,"" Edward murmured, his voice rough and tired from a long night. ""Had to talk business, and just had a couple of drinks.""



I snuggled deeper into his arms, shifting around until I found a comfortable spot.



But he couldn't keep his hands to himself. His rough fingers gave my waist a gentle squeeze, then trailed beneath the hem of my pajamas.



""No, please,"" I murmured, grabbing his hand, my voice heavy with sleep. ""I'm exhausted. Let's do this tomorrow.""



Edward gave a low laugh, his chest vibrating against me, his warm breath tickling my ear. ""I won't be free tomorrow.""



With that, Edward rolled over, pressing me beneath him.



The curtains weren't fully drawn, and the neon lights slipped through the gaps, painting shifting patterns of light and shadow across his chiseled face.



\*\*\*\*\*



By the time I woke up, it was nearly noon.



Edward was long gone, and the other side of the bed was cold.



I still felt clean, so I guess he took care of me before he left.



Supporting my sore waist, I sat up and saw a glass of warm water and a sticky note on the nightstand. His bold scrawl read: \[Mr. Armstrong will come by this afternoon. There's a document for you to sign.\]



'Figures. More paperwork,' I thought, rolling my eyes.



It was always either some stock transfer or a pointless authorization form, not that I ever understood them, or even needed to.



I rubbed my temples and shuffled into the bathroom.



Looking at myself in the mirror, I saw that my face was a bit pale, with faint shadows under my eyes.



Just as I was about to brush my teeth, my stomach suddenly turned upside down. I gripped the sink, dry heaving a few times, but nothing came up. It just brought tears to my eyes.



This feeling was familiar.



My heart skipped a beat, and my hand instinctively rested on my stomach.



Last month, I thought my period was late.



At the time, I'd been too busy helping Michael with his new company to pay a lot of attention. Plus, Edward had been swamped with work, and we barely saw each other. So I hadn't really thought much of it.



My hands were trembling as I dug out an unopened pregnancy test from the bathroom cabinet.



Five minutes later, I stared at those two glaring red lines; my mind went completely blank.



The test slipped from my fingers and hit the cold tile with a sharp clatter, the sound echoing through the empty bathroom.



'Huh? I-I am actually pregnant?' I thought, my heart pounding out of control.



Edward and I always used protection, except for that one night. A little over a month ago, he'd come home from a celebration, clearly upset and more than a little drunk, and kept me up in bed nearly the whole night.



That time, we didn't use protection.



I leaned against the wall and slowly slid down to the floor, my mind turning into a complete mess.



This baby really couldn't have come at a worse time.



That evening, Edward came home unusually early.



He tossed his suit jacket onto the couch, loosened his tie, and walked straight to the liquor cabinet to pour himself a glass of whiskey.



I sat across from him in the armchair, fidgeting with the tassels on the throw pillow without even realizing it.



He took a sip of his drink, his gaze lingering on me, like he could tell I wasn't quite myself.



""What's wrong?"" he asked. His tone was flat, completely unreadable.



I took a deep breath, trying to keep my voice steady. ""Edward, do you like kids?""



His hand holding the glass paused for a moment, the ice cubes making a sharp clink against the side.



Then he looked up at me, his gaze piercing, like he was trying to see straight into my soul. After a long pause, he finally spoke, his voice colder than the ice in his glass.



""No."" He didn't even hesitate.



My heart sank, and I gripped the tassels of the pillow even tighter.



He set down his glass, picked up a financial magazine from the coffee table, and flipped it open, making it obvious he didn't want to talk about it anymore.



""They're a hassle."" He barely spared a word, his eyes still fixed on the magazine, as if those stock charts mattered more than anything I had to say.



Seconds passed, and the silence was so thick I could almost hear my heartbeat.



Just when I thought the conversation was over, he flipped a page without even looking up and threw out another offhand remark. ""And having one out of wedlock is even more trouble.""



His words felt like a knife dipped in ice, plunging straight into my heart.



I could almost feel the warmth draining from me, my whole body turning cold.



I opened my mouth, wanting to say something, but my throat was so tight, not a single word would come out.



In the end, I just forced a smile worse than tears. ""Oh, I was just asking, you know, kind of curious. What would you be like if you had a kid?""



He didn't respond, just kept his eyes glued to the magazine.



I slowly stood up. ""I'm a bit tired. I'm going to bed.""



Back in the bedroom, I buried myself under the covers, and finally, the tears I'd been holding back came pouring out.



'Don't cry, Sophia. Don't let him find out,' I told myself.



'What would a patron do if he found out his canary was pregnant? I didn't even dare imagine it,' I thought.



At that moment, that last bit of unrealistic fantasy I'd been clinging to shattered completely, not even a trace left.



I thought it was time to go.



\*\*\*\*\*



A few days later, the weekend rolled around. Edward had an important business forum to attend, so he was out the door at the crack of dawn.



Left alone in the empty apartment, the place felt even more suffocating than usual.



My bestie, Vivian Downton, texted me, asking if I wanted to go out shopping.



Vivian was pretty much the only person I could be truly honest with these past three years.



She was in pretty much the same boat as me, kept by another powerful man in Elarwyn.



As she liked to put it, ""We're just two lost birds blown to the same corner of the world. No need for introductions when fate brings us together.""



We met up at the swankiest mall in the city center.



Vivian had just scored a generous allowance from her sugar daddy, Jason Grant, and was in high spirits. She grabbed my hand and pulled me along, shopping from the ground floor all the way to the top.



""Sophia, what do you think of this dress?"" Vivian held up a champagne-colored slip dress, holding it up against me. ""This color would look gorgeous on you.""



I just shook my head, not feeling it at all. That wave of nausea was starting to creep up on me again.



Vivian noticed right away. ""What's up? You don't look so great.""



She set the dress aside, her eyes full of concern as she looked me over, then gently squeezed my wrist. ""Have you been skipping meals again?""



I was about to say I was fine when, out of the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of something, and my feet felt glued to the floor.



Not far away, in front of a newly opened custom suit shop, stood Edward. He was wearing a perfectly tailored dark gray suit, standing tall and sharp. 'Wasn't he supposed to be at that forum?' I thought.



But what really made my breath hitch was the woman standing next to him.



She was dressed in a well-fitted white dress, her long hair softly curled, giving off a gentle, elegant vibe. She was looking up at Edward, smiling, her eyes crinkling with her smile.



The sunlight poured through the mall's massive glass dome, bathing the two of them in a soft halo, making them look like they belonged together, almost like a perfect couple.



She wasn't his mother or his sister. She was a woman I'd never seen before.



Vivian followed my gaze, her face falling a little as she instinctively tried to pull me away.



The more Vivian tried to pull me away, the more uneasy I felt.



""Vivian, who is she?"" I grabbed Vivian's hand, staring straight into her eyes as I asked.



Vivian's gaze darted away, and she hesitated for a long moment. Only after I pressed her again and again did she finally lower her voice and say, ""I only heard a bit from Jason. That's Edward's first crush, Emily Monroe. She's a few years older than him and married overseas years ago. Just recently, she got divorced and moved back.""



'His first crush? What a joke,' I thought, the irony stinging.



A wave of sour heartache welled up inside me, so strong that it felt suffocating.



'I should be happy, right? The woman he really loves is back. Maybe now he'll finally let me go,' I told myself. 'I'm free now. But why does it hurt this much inside?'



""Sophia, are you okay?"" Vivian asked softly, her voice full of concern.



She watched me anxiously, gripping the edge of her sleeve so tightly her knuckles had gone pale.



I took a deep breath, forcing a smile and making my tone as breezy as I could. ""I'm fine, really. What could possibly be wrong? His first crush is back—good for him. I was just the stand-in, after all. Now that she is here, it's only right for me to step aside.""



I said all the right things, but only I knew how much it hurt—like someone was dragging a dull knife across my heart, one cut at a time.



""It was always just physical, never about feelings, right?"" I told her, forcing myself to sound calm.



Vivian let out a sigh, a bit of sadness flickering in her eyes.



'Yeah, who were we kidding? Caged canaries like us don't get to talk about love,' I wondered.



That afternoon, I just wasn't in the mood to shop anymore. I made up an excuse and parted ways with Vivian.



Instead of going home, I grabbed a cab and went straight to the hospital.



I checked in at the OB-GYN and sat on the cold waiting room bench, feeling like I was waiting for a verdict.



When I got the slip that said \[5 weeks pregnant,\] the world spun around me.



The slip of paper in my hand felt light as a feather, but somehow, it weighed a ton.



I walked out of the exam room in a daze, still reeling from this surprise, when I spotted the hospital director personally leading two people toward the VIP section of the OB-GYN department.



And those two people were Edward and Emily.



Emily was holding onto Edward's arm, her face lit up with a soft, gentle smile. Edward turned his head to listen to her, the faintest hint of a smile tugging at his lips.



The scene was so dazzling that it almost hurt to look at.



Before I knew it, I was trailing after them, hiding just around the corner in the hallway.



After about half an hour, they finally came out of the exam room.



Emily was holding her own test slip, giving it a little wave, her eyes shining brightly as she looked up at Edward.



They were a little too far away, and with the crowd and all the noise, I couldn't make out their conversation clearly.



But a few words pierced my ears like needles.



""This baby couldn't have come at a better time. It's the product of our love."" It was Edward's voice.



Emily's smile grew even brighter, and she excitedly hugged Edward's arm, clinging to him.



Edward was briefly taken aback, but then his features softened, and he reached up to gently pat her hand.



They looked like a perfect match, suited for each other in every way.



I slumped against the cold wall, feeling as if every ounce of strength had been drained from my body.



So, it turned out he didn't hate kids. He just couldn't stand the idea of having a child with me.



It was just because the mother wasn't the woman in his heart that he didn't want a baby and thought it was a hassle.



A sharp pain shot through my chest, my vision went black, and I almost fainted.



Luckily, someone caught me before I could fall. It was Vivian.



Vivian must have followed me at some point, but I hadn't even noticed.



""Sophia,"" Vivian called out, her voice trembling with worry.



She was on the verge of tears. ""Are you okay? Please, don't scare me like that.""



I just shook my head, unable to get a single word out.



My tears just wouldn't stop, falling like beads from a broken string.



Vivian helped me over to a chair and hugged me tight, cursing out Edward and Emily nonstop.



I heard her, but inside, I was just numb.



I was too naive. I never should've let myself hope for anything.



He only ever wanted my body, never my heart. Not once did he give me even a shred of real affection.

I had a root canal on this tooth (bottom left molar) about 5 years ago probably and have had nothing but problems since. I never fully experienced any period of time pain free, and have always had pain when eating on that side of my mouth.

The last couple of days bits of the tooth keep crumbling away and it’s a lot more sensitive than normal - mainly to heat than cold but I don’t really know what that means.

I’m meant to be waiting to have it extracted at the hospital with a couple of wisdom teeth but idk if I should make an appointment with my dentist sooner or if I should just suck it up and try power through. I rarely go to the dentist unless it’s an emergency appointment because I am terrified and so the fact that I’m considering going makes me think that it’s probably time to speak to the dentist. But the last time I had it x-rayed (probably 12-18 months ago) they said that they couldn’t really explain the ongoing pain and that extraction was probably the best way forward.

I’ve had extractions before (both upper wisdom teeth) but I scare myself sh*tless any time I think about going for an appointment even though the last extractions weren’t horrific in the grand scheme of things. It would be nice to be able to eat that side of my mouth and drink a coffee without horrible pain I suppose 🤦🏼‍♀️🤔",1,1758853268.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

After a few semesters here (and countless mall trips lol), here’s my personal Top 5 Malaysian souvenirs:

White Coffee ☕️ – Ipoh is famous for it, but honestly you can find 3-in-1 packs anywhere, my Korean friends love it because it’s not too bitter, very smooth. It saves me a lot of time! I can sleep in and just grab one before class.

Shopping at Pavilion KL  – The vibe here is very luxury but got everything under one roof. After shopping, I’ll usually pick up some souvenirs like Legendary Perfume Malaysia — I was surprised Malaysia got its own perfume brand inspired by legends like Mahsuri. Quite meaningful as a gift, feels very cultural instead of just buying the usual keychain. 

Batik Shirts & Scarves  – Very colourful, unique designs. Not only the traditional cutting like baju melayu or cheongsam, they now turn batik to crop top and set wear! So, it's pretty versatile! My mom already reserved one for herself 🤭.

Local Snacks  – Kaya spread, dodol, muruku, or even kacang putih. Easy to pack and everyone can share. Remember to buy more than one! Last time my sister complained that I only bought one pack of kacang putih, which wasn’t enough. 

Handmade Crafts – If you go to Central Market or Jonker Street, you can find nice handmade stuff that feels very local. That day I went to Ping Min Market and there is a shop selling Malaysian tiny snacks, it is so cute!

A group of girls was there, about my age, if not a little older. They were all preppy girls that all went to the room at the end of the hall for some reason unknown to me. They were all joyful and energetic. I didn’t know them. I stood near the entrance. The girl was paying no attention to me, which I was fine with. I approached the black sofa, then suddenly stopped when I found a large, long-limbed version of Grimace (yes, the McDonald’s mascot), lying on the floor between the coffee table and the sofa, the corners of his mouth were curled downward in a frown, and his eyes were completely shut. He showed no sign of life. This was obviously out of the ordinary, but I showed no sign of shock. There was a small knife on the kitchen counter, and for no reason at all I went up to Grimace with this knife, stuck the whole blade in his body, and just as quickly took it back out, leaving a 2.5 inch deep hole right in the middle of his torso. I then turned the knife sideways in my hand, and I slid it across where I had to imagine his neck would be, the purple, synthetic cloth skin separating between the sliver. Even after all I had just done to him, no liquids of any kind came out of either slit. While the knife dragged along his throat, I felt a phantom tickle along mine, as if a ghost were trying to do the same to me. I took a few steps away, with the knife still in my hand, and stood, pacing around the other side of the room in complete silence, other than my footsteps. About 10 minutes later, the group of preppy girls comes out, all giggling and squealing and chatting loudly. I remained, pacing around the other side of the room, when I hear a shocked & fearful shriek. I turned towards the direction it came from, and a skinny white girl with blond hair from the group was looking down, with a petrified expression on her face. She looked away from the scene and up to me, knowing I was the culprit. Last thing I remember was me, just walking to another room with the knife still in my hand, and the group of girls now following me, hurling threats and slurs my way.

On Valentine's Day, Gabriella Watson spent 24 hours straight inside Fred W. Symmes Chapel, sitting in the same pew, clutching her rosary, whispering prayers until her voice went hoarse and her body ached.
She did it because her husband, Daniel Durke, and their son, Jerome Durke, claimed they weren't feeling well. They swore if she prayed hard enough, they'd start to feel better.
Exhausted, she caught a red-eye flight home. Midway through, her phone buzzed with a message from an unknown number. ""Your husband's marrying his stepsister today. Your son's the ring bearer.""
Gabriella rolled her eyes at the cruel prank and typed back, ""Impossible. My husband and son love me.""
But when she finally pulled up to the estate, she saw it with her own eyes—Daniel, in a tux, sliding a ring onto his stepsister's finger as she stood radiant in a wedding dress.
Jerome clapped and grinned. ""Thia, now you're my real mom! I don't have to live with that naggy woman anymore!""
Gabriella felt the world tilt. The rosary slipped from her hand and scattered across the ground.
***
""You promised—if I wanted to, you'd take me away. Now, I'm willing to go with you.
""Gabriella, you can't take back what you said. Are you sure you don't want Daniel and Jerome?""
""Yes. I don't want them.""
Gabriella hung up. A few yards away, Daniel and Cynthia Moreau had just finished a heated kiss.
Her first instinct was to hide. She darted behind the rose wall, clenching her fist so tightly her skin throbbed with pain.
All this time, when she'd nearly ruined her body praying and stayed up through the night begging for the health of the people she loved, they were secretly throwing a lavish wedding for Cynthia.
The excuse about being ""unwell"" had been a lie. They'd been making a fool of her all along.
Most of the guests were Daniel's friends. Applause swelled around them.
""Man, Danny is so romantic. Seven or eight years apart and they get back together—I'm tearing up.""
""Right? There's no blood between them. They were forced apart. Thia's had it rough. Thank God Danny stood by her, kicked Gabriella out, and made this huge wedding on Valentine's Day—so perfect.""
""Yeah. Danny might've cared for Gabriella, but she could never take Thia's place. Gabriella's petty, and she ruined her looks. It's no wonder her husband and son hate her. She just won't go away. What a manipulative woman.""
Every word landed like another blow. Gabriella felt her blood go cold.
The wedding march looped. Daniel held Cynthia, who was sobbing, and his eyes were softer than she'd ever seen.
""Thia, eight years. I finally get to do this—have a dreamlike wedding with you.""
Cynthia choked back tears into his shoulder. ""Danny, I never thought I'd be with you again in my lifetime. All the suffering—I can forget it now.""
Daniel's look was full of protectiveness. ""Don't worry. I'll take care of you. I'll protect you forever.""
Jerome grinned and hugged Cynthia's leg. ""Thia, can I call you 'Mom' now? You're getting married to my dad.""
Cynthia smiled softly and said, ""Yes, but keep it a secret from your mom, okay? If she finds out, I might get kicked out.""
Jerome's face hardened. ""Hmph. If she bullies you, I'll make her pay. I'll send her to the loony bin!""
Hot tears streaked down Gabriella's face. She couldn't believe it—the son she raised would put his own mother in a psychiatric hospital for Cynthia.
Daniel grabbed the mic and warned the crowd, ""Please keep this between us. Gabriella is petty and holds grudges. I'm worried she might do something to Thia.""
""Don't worry, Danny. We're all backing you and Thia—our lips are sealed!"" someone called.
Cynthia gave a guilty look toward Daniel. ""She'll come after me if she knows.""
Daniel soothed her, ""I owe you this. I can't put your name on the marriage license, but I'll protect you. Gabriella won't dare touch you.""
""Dad and I will be your knights, Mom Thia. No one will make you sad!"" Jerome declared.
Then the crowd funneled into the estate's ballroom and started the opening dance.
Gabriella's legs gave out. She sank onto the lawn.
She remembered the first time she met Daniel—he was a mess, living on cigarettes and booze, many times close to jumping into the river.
She'd brought him to therapy, taken care of him for two years, and handled everything until he had life in him again.
She knew there was someone else in his heart, so she stepped back and disappeared for a while.
Daniel had searched the world for her. He even waited outside the B&B she stayed at for three days, begging her to come back.
He'd poured his heart out. ""Gabriella, you gave me a second life. Marry me.""
She'd believed his sincerity and trusted he'd love her above all else.
They were married for six years and had Jerome.
She never expected that when Gabriella returned, Daniel would so quickly drift back to his first love.
Even her son wanted Cynthia as his mother more than he wanted her.
Her devotion had become a joke—discarded and despised like trash.
Gabriella's eyes were too dry for tears. She watched the sky fill with pink heart-shaped balloons and felt a hollow chill at how blatant Daniel's romance with Cynthia was.
At least in five days, she would disappear from this city for good—out of their sight, out of their problem.
Chapter 2
Gabriella was about to leave when someone stopped her.
""You—go run the bath for the bride. After she showers, she's spending the night with Mr. Durke. Don't mess this up!""
It was one of the staff, treating Gabriella like a new hire.
She'd just come down from the mountain. The cold had cracked her face, so she'd bundled up tight to hide it, and no one recognized her as Daniel's wife.
She tried to refuse, but the worker grumbled and shoved her up to the second floor.
Every hallway was lined with Cynthia's portraits. Everywhere Gabriella looked there were camellias—Cynthia's favorite. That's when Gabriella realized just how far Daniel had gone to pamper someone else.
The wedding was lavish. Any woman would be jealous.
In the bathroom she moved on autopilot, filling the tub with hot water. Just outside, the suite was decked out for the honeymoon, and the thought of it made her cry again.
A giant wedding photo showed Daniel and Cynthia locked in a passionate kiss.
The thought hit her—while she'd been sick from the altitude, he'd been taking bridal photos with Cynthia.
While she'd been praying for his well-being, he'd been writing sappy vows to another woman.
Suddenly Daniel burst through the door with Cynthia in his arms. They couldn't even wait to get to the bed. They started making out in the entryway, tearing at each other's clothes.
The spray of water blurred the glass. Gabriella's hand tightened on the showerhead until it trembled.
Daniel's voice came out rough, thick with desire. ""Thia, I've waited for this day so long.""
Cynthia sounded a little crushed. ""But you still married Gabriella and had a child with her. I'm not blaming you—I'm just... sad. Our first night isn't with each other.""
Daniel smiled, indulgent and soft. ""You know, back then I missed you so much. Gabriella showed up at the right time. She wasn't pretty like you, didn't flirt the way you do, and her voice wasn't as sweet, but she worked hard and treated me well. In the moment I thought trying it with her wasn't a loss.
""And our first time? It wasn't gentle. I was wasted, and I mistook her for you. You're the one I want—you're irreplaceable.""
Cynthia's face lit up, and she kissed him eagerly.
Gabriella watched them through the frosted glass, feeling as if someone was cutting her open.
She remembered how Daniel once treated her like a treasure—calling her his salvation, his love he couldn't turn away from.
Now, in front of Cynthia, she was the desperate fool.
He'd turned off the lights the first time, been tender but fierce at the same time, whispering, ""I love you. I want to have you forever.""
Only now did Gabriella realize his mind had been on Cynthia the whole time.
She wiped her face, kept her head down, and stepped out. ""Sir, the bath is ready. I'll be going.""
She squeezed out the words, not wanting to witness what would happen next.
They were down to the last scraps of clothing.
Daniel said in a low voice, ""From now on, call Gabriella 'Mrs. Durke.'""
Gabriella flinched, closed her eyes, and answered like someone resigned to a sentence, ""Yes, Mr. Durke and Mrs. Durke. Congratulations on your marriage.""
Cynthia laughed, all charm as she lounged on the bed. ""Danny, don't be so mean. She did witness the wedding—give her something, a little tip.""
Daniel pounced and bit her lip playfully. ""Call me honey, not by my name.""
Gabriella stood frozen, hollow inside, as Daniel carelessly tossed a wristwatch at her.
""Take this downstairs. Serve the new Mrs. Durke well.""
Cynthia squealed. ""Isn't that the watch Gabriella designed herself for you? You're just giving it to a servant?""
Daniel chuckled. ""It's our wedding day—give the staff a gift. Later we'll say it got lost. Gabriella won't make a fuss. She always brings me those random little presents. I can't treasure them all.""
Gabriella pressed the watch into her palm, numb. She pushed open the door and ran out.
They'd been together two Valentine's Days now. For three months she'd apprenticed with a craftsman to design and build that one-of-a-kind watch for Daniel.
He wore it everywhere afterwards—it was his profile pic, his show of affection. Friends teased him for being sentimental, and he loved it.
Now, on Valentine's Day, he'd tossed that watch to a servant like trash and crawled into bed with another woman.
Gabriella wandered the street in a daze and, when she couldn't bear it anymore, hurled the watch into a roadside trash can—along with the foolish, naive version of herself she'd once been.
Chapter 3
By the time Gabriella got home, she was soaked from the downpour, her body burned with a terrifying fever.
In the living room, Jerome was glued to his game console—the latest model, a gift from Cynthia.
""Why are you back so soon?""
His tone wasn't concerned for her health. It was a surprise that she'd returned early, worrying it might interrupt his dad and new mom's wedding night.
Gabriella blinked, slightly dazed. ""Yeah... I just got back. I'm going to rest.""
Jerome froze. Normally, she would never let him stay up late gaming. But tonight, she hadn't even taken the console.
He settled in comfortably on the floor, diving into his game with full intensity.
Gabriella set the two rosaries on the coffee table and turned toward the stairs.
""Running all the way there just to bring back this? Is this supposed to make me and Dad feel better? Looks cheap... not even close to the full gaming setup Thia got me.""
Even though Jerome spoke softly, she heard every word.
This time, she didn't respond. She went straight to her room, curling under the covers to warm her freezing body.
That night was filled with nightmares. Gabriella almost thought she wouldn't wake up.
When she did, Daniel's worried face hovered over her. ""Honey, you're awake! You scared me to death.
""Why'd you come back early from the mountains? Why didn't you call me to pick you up? Look at you—forty-degree fever! I nearly went weak at the knees hearing this.""
Gabriella listened to his tender tone, tasting only bitter irony.
Now she could see through Daniel's fake mask straight into the rot underneath.
""I thought sleeping it off would help. It's nothing serious,"" she said evenly.
""Nothing serious? What if something happened to you? What about Jerome?
""I'll take care of you these days. Don't even think about getting out of bed.""
His tone was indulgent yet scolding, impossible to read.
Soon, a rosary fell from his hands. ""I saw this on the coffee table. You got it for me and Jerome, right? I've heard these are powerful but hard to get. You went through so much—I love you.
""I made sure Jerome always carries his, and I'll do the same. Never losing it. It's all your effort.""
Gabriella's voice went cold. ""What about the watch I gave you?""
Daniel was caught off guard, but his expression stayed smooth. ""It's at the office. My assistant's holding it for me.""
Gabriella's lashes flickered. She didn't push further, letting her question hang in the air like a trap.
Daniel leaned down to kiss her forehead. She turned away in disgust, the memory of him kissing Cynthia flashing through her mind.
His kiss missed, freezing him for a split second.
""What? Feeling unwell? I can call a doctor.""
""I'm fine. Just a little dizzy. I want to sleep,"" she said, closing her eyes, making it clear she didn't want to continue the conversation.
Daniel brushed it off, assuming her reaction was just the illness.
Then the phone rang. Jerome's voice came through, ""Dad! Mom passed out! Come quick!""
""What happened? I'm on my way! Tell her not to be afraid!""
Daniel bolted, unaware that every word of his earlier conversation had been heard by Gabriella.
Chapter 4
That afternoon, Gabriella got out of bed to handle her discharge paperwork.
The doctor gave her an unexpected blow.
""Ms. Watson, you're already over three weeks pregnant. I recommend staying a few more days to rest—there's been some signs of a threatened miscarriage.""
Gabriella stared blankly at the report. Pregnant? Now?
Turning a corner, she caught a familiar voice.
""Mom Thia, you're having a baby, right? Yay! I'll be the best brother ever!
""Dad, are you so happy you're acting silly?""
Cynthia gently tugged at Daniel's cheek. ""Did you hear? The doctor said you're going to be a dad.""
Daniel's eyes were red, and he hurriedly scooped Cynthia into his arms.
""I love you, Thia. Thank you for bringing this life into the world. I'll love you both without reservation.""
The report slipped from Gabriella's hand and fluttered to the floor.
She was pregnant at the same time as Cynthia. How absurd.
She didn't even need to ask Daniel what he thought. She couldn't keep this baby.
And she feared that, like Jerome, the baby would hate her, wanting another woman as their mother.
Gabriella turned back and scheduled a procedure with the doctor for a few days later.
That night, Daniel finally returned home, drenched in sweat.
He dropped to one knee, taking Gabriella's cold hand. ""I had to run into the office for something urgent, and when I got back, you'd already discharged yourself. You rushed home while still sick... Don't scare me like that, okay?""
Gabriella's expression was blank as she stared at the floor. ""I'm fine now. Staying in the hospital was uncomfortable, so I came back.""
Daniel's unease eased slightly, though he still probed. ""Did something happen on the way? You seem off lately.""
""Nothing. You're overthinking.""
He was about to speak again, but Gabriella buried herself in her phone.
""I'll make you a pot of seafood chowder,"" Daniel said. ""You probably haven't had much appetite with the cold. This will be good for you.""
Rolling up his sleeves, he went into the kitchen, preparing the meal with practiced ease.
Gabriella remembered when Daniel had only drunk alcohol and refused to eat—she had gone to endless lengths to get him to eat, including making this chowder.
Once he learned how, he'd started making it for her anytime he could.
Back then, she had thought their love could last a lifetime.
Her phone chimed—Jerome had dragged a ""reluctant"" Cynthia into the house.
""Jerry, don't do that. Your mom's sick. Your dad's taking care of her; that's his job. I can't be here—your mom wouldn't like it.""
""Why wouldn't she? I want you here, so you're here! With Dad and me protecting you, she won't dare kick you out!""
Normally, Cynthia wouldn't have dared to show up at Gabriella and Daniel's home so boldly.
This time, her confidence came from the baby in her belly.
Jerome shoved Cynthia onto the couch, sticking his tongue out at Gabriella like a defiant child. ""I want Thia to play with me. You can't kick her out!""
Cynthia smiled, her expression unreadable. ""Sorry, Gabriella. I'll just stay a little while, then I'll go. Don't want to ruin Jerry's fun.""
Gabriella snapped back sharply. ""If you didn't want to come, why can't you let go of my son? Cynthia, you've been waiting for this day a long time, huh? All that pretending—I'm exhausted just watching.""
Cynthia wasn't expecting Gabriella's bluntness and hesitated, unsure how to respond.
Then she leaned back lazily. ""Gabriella, the bathwater was perfect. We even lingered in the tub after.""
Gabriella's stiffened, frozen in place. She realized that night Cynthia had known the servant was her all along and deliberately made Daniel reward her, humiliating her on purpose.
Daniel came out carrying the chowder. Sensing the tension, he quickly defended Cynthia.
""Honey, Jerry likes Thia. She's just here to play with him. Don't overthink it.
""And she wanted to see how you're feeling, just chat a bit.""
Gabriella ignored his half-hearted explanation, turning toward the stairs. ""It's fine. You guys do what you want. I need to rest.""
Daniel didn't notice her mood anymore. His attention was entirely on Cynthia.
From downstairs, laughter and chatter floated up. Gabriella stared into the distance, calculating the time until she could finally leave.
Chapter 5
The next day, Gabriella went into the office.
The HR manager looked at her, hesitating. ""Ms. Watson, are you sure you want to resign? The CEO doesn't know yet. He didn't pay attention when he signed. I can still—""
""I'm sure. I'm resigning. His signature's enough,"" she said.
After finishing a quick handover, she started packing up her office.
Everywhere she looked were little gifts from Daniel, matching mugs, soft seat cushions, a pair of matching keyboards, even framed family photos...
Memories of happiness slowly turned to ash in her hands.
Suddenly, the HR manager ran in, panic written all over her face. ""Ms. Watson, you need to check the company website. Something's happened...""
Gabriella pulled it up and froze. At the top of the homepage, a scandalous headline screamed, ""Cynthia Moreau's Nude Photo Leak"".
The images were brutal. Cynthia, disheveled, was surrounded by strangers forcing her to drink, striking her, and pulling at her clothes.
A video played below, showing her being humiliated over and over.
""Who would post this?"" Gabriella muttered to herself.
It was clearly a relic from Cynthia's time abroad.
There was no way she'd do this herself.
Gabriella was about to leave when Daniel appeared, carrying a sobbing Cynthia.
The first words out of his mouth were like a knife to her chest. ""Gabriella, this was you, wasn't it?""
Gabriella felt her blood turn cold. Her voice came out strained. ""Daniel, do you actually think I did this?""
His eyes cut into her like a blade, piercing her already aching heart.
""You just got to the office, and this happens. How am I supposed to believe you?""
He had someone bring up security footage—showing her going to talk to her assistant, Linda Davis.
Gabriella tried to explain. ""I just gave Linda some instructions on the next steps for work.""
Then Linda walked in, head down. Facing Daniel, she said, ""Ms. Watson asked me to post the photos and videos... said she wanted Cynthia to be humiliated, to make everyone despise her.""
Gabriella screamed, furious. ""Linda! I never told you to do that!""
She couldn't believe the person she trusted most at work had betrayed her.
Daniel snatched the family photo from her desk and smashed it to the floor, fury radiating off him.
""Gabriella! How dare you go after Thia like this! You know how I feel about her growing up abroad, how I hated that I wasn't there to protect her. And now... you've destroyed her again!""
Cynthia collapsed in his arms, crying so hard she was almost fainting.
""Danny, I stayed clean! I didn't let anyone touch me! And now... the whole world thinks I was violated. How am I supposed to live?""
""Why do you hate me so much, Gabriella? I'm barely surviving, and this... is this what you wanted?""
Gabriella stared at the obvious trap and let out a hollow, bitter laugh.
In Daniel's eyes, her innocence meant nothing compared to Cynthia's tears.
At that moment, Jerome stormed in, furious. ""You're so cruel! Why would you post Thia's photos? You're a terrible woman! And you'll pay for hurting her!""
Before Gabriella could react, Jerome grabbed a vase from the desk and smashed it into her head.
""Apologize to Thia!"" he shouted.
Gabriella couldn't dodge. The vase hit her square on the forehead, blood gushing down past her eyes.
""Ms. Watson!"" the HR manager gasped, too shocked to move closer.
Daniel froze for a second too, but seeing innocent Cynthia in his arms, his face hardened again.
This was what Gabriella deserved. He couldn't show mercy—she needed to learn her lesson.
""Apologize. A sincere apology to Thia,"" Daniel said coldly.
Dizzy and bleeding, Gabriella's last sight before collapsing was Daniel's smug satisfaction—and her son looking up at Cynthia, waiting for praise for his righteous judgment.
Chapter 6
When Gabriella woke up, she was plunged into darkness.
The blood on her forehead had dried, crudely bandaged like someone had half-heartedly cared.
Voices came from outside the room—Daniel's voice.
""Thia, you didn't deserve that. I never expected Gabriella to treat you that way, leaking your photos. But she's still my wife. I can't just throw her in jail.""
""So your plan is to starve her for a few days as punishment? Honestly, I'm fine... I'm used to being pushed around. I can handle it.""
""Don't be ridiculous. No one is allowed to hurt you anymore. Not even Gabriella.""
Then, Jerome started scheming. ""Why don't we lock her up from now on? Chains or something? That way, she can't hurt anyone again.""
Gabriella felt her heart freeze. She stared blankly at the ceiling. Her own son wanted to chain her up. The words cut her deeper than any knife.
Daniel's voice cut sharply. ""Jerry, that's your mother. What are you even saying?""
Then, his tone softened as he turned to comfort Cynthia. ""If Gabriella keeps acting out, I'll put her in one of the vacant apartments outside town. Someone will watch her, and you can focus on bringing our baby into the world safely.
""To make sure she can't run off, I'll have a doctor give her something to keep her asleep most of the time. She won't be able to hurt anyone.""
Cynthia sniffled, deeply touched. ""Thank you, honey.""
Jerome clapped excitedly. ""Yes! Then I don't have to see her every day. Heck yeah!""
And just like that, Gabriella became a walking corpse. Days without food or water left her barely standing.
Daniel put her in the car. Cynthia sat in the passenger seat as they drove out of the city.
His voice was cold, emotionless. ""Gabriella, when you've thought things through, I'll come get you. This time, you went too far. Thia didn't press charges, so you should at least be grateful.""
Gabriella ignored him, closing her eyes, sinking into a deep, exhausted sleep.
Cynthia feigned kindness. ""Gabriella, we'll come see you often.""
Daniel chuckled. ""Gabriella, maybe you should take a page from Thia's book—learn to be more forgiving.""
""Ugh... Daniel, you're disgusting.""
Suddenly, a truck came barreling toward them. Daniel barely had time to react, yanking the wheel hard.
In the last second before impact, he threw himself over Cynthia without a thought.
The deafening crash shook the world around them. Gabriella felt a sharp pain in her abdomen, the slow, terrifying slip of life from her body.
Bystanders gathered, sirens blared.
Through the haze, she saw Daniel cradling unconscious Cynthia, shouting for help.
""Someone save my wife! She's pregnant!""
All three were rushed into the ambulance. Daniel never once looked at Gabriella.
At the hospital, a nurse's urgent voice cut through the chaos. ""There's only one OR. Who goes in first?""
""My wife—she's carrying our baby!"" Daniel shouted.
The nurse hesitated. ""The other woman is pregnant too. What do we do?""
He glanced at Gabriella, pale and fragile, realizing she was pregnant as well.
Less than a second later, he carried Cynthia into the only operating room. ""Save her first. Let's deal with the rest later.""
Gabriella watched the doors close, leaving Daniel's resolute back behind.
Weak, she closed her eyes. Time blurred until someone finally wheeled her away.
When she woke again, the doctor told her the baby was gone.
No sorrow. No joy. She pushed herself out of bed and insisted on leaving.
Passing a room, she saw Daniel meticulously helping Cynthia with her recovery.
Jerome held Cynthia's hand, crying. ""Mom Thia, please wake up soon.""
She glanced one last time before taking the elevator down.
Gabriella dialed a number. ""I'm ready. Come get me.""
Half an hour later, she slid into a limited-edition stretch Lincoln and vanished from the hospital, leaving Daniel and Jerome's world behind forever.
That night, Daniel smoked alone in the lounge when his phone rang.
""Mr. Durke, this is the New York City PD. Your wife, Gabriella Watson, drove off a bridge this afternoon. We haven't recovered the body yet. Can you come to the scene?""
At the same time, a doctor, grave-faced, pushed through the door. ""Mr. Durke, Gabriella is your wife, right? She just had a car accident and lost the baby. How could she leave the hospital on her own? She needs to rest properly, or she may never be able to have children again.""
The cigarette dropped from Daniel's hand. A thunderous noise rang in his mind.

1nqphpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ghosting/comments/1nqphpl/wtf/,Wtf,"So, I (24m) had a date monday with a girl I met the week earlier, I was stressed like crazy and was really afraid to see her cause, well, she's way out of my leagues. Anyway, I pick her up 2:30 at her place and we go to one of the swimming place around the city where we are. We agreed on that the day before so no surprise there. The day before the date, she texts me that she isn't going great cause her ex was being an absolute a**. So I do my best to cheer her up and tell her that i'll make her feel better when I'll see her. Anyway, we arrive at the creek, and quickly we get really close to each other, she kisses me, we go further so we can be alone, make out, I take a piece of her swimsuit off (with her explicit consent ofc)... Then she was getting cold so we got out and went on the edge of the creek to look at the water, turtles and fishes... Then, it's around 5:30pm and I ask her if she wants to see the sunset on one the hills. So we go, i have my hand on her thigh during the ride, she puts hers on my shoulder, we sing Billy Eilish together, we discover we actually have a 10y gap (she's 10 years older). I ask if it's a problem to what she says no so I ask for a kiss (she gives it to me) and we make our way to the sunset. I take a sweater so she doesn't get cold and we go to one of the point of view. We are holding each other closely and talking about everything... Then she starts laughing at me so I ask her why, apparently my personality is funny, so I ask her if it's because i'm resisting a lot to not undress her (at this point I sorta did it a bit earlier so it didn't seemed inappropriate to me) to what she tells me ""who says I'm interested ?"". After all that, I'm just thinking that hell yeah she was interested until now ? I ask her what it means (she was just messing with me) and it shifts towards a more serious conversation.  She talks to me about the previous people she was seeing, some wild stuff, the ex that was being an a** and how it all affected her and her insecurities. So I'm like, hugging her and telling her I'm sorry she went through all that, and that she absolutely don't deserve to be treated this way. She seemed pleased with me cheering her up so I'm kinda happy to see her smile. I say that I also went through some shit (hence why I've been in rghosting for a bit). She doesn't ask any questions about it, kinda felt like she didn't care. Then she asks me if I want to go take a bite or a coffee so we make our way to a place she likes. I say yes, off we go. We get a coffee and a pizza, she pays for the pizza, I offer to pay my share but she declines. After we decide to have a walk along the city's waterfront and she wants to go to a place she was supposed to visit to live there. We make our way there we talk on the way, then it's 8:30 so I go to drop her at her place. On the way we talk about seeing each other the Thursday, (so yesterday) and that she would let me know. We arrive at her place, we kiss (a lot) and tells me how much of a good time she had and thanked me. Then she goes home. I drive home and I send her a message like I really had a good time. She replies in the morning (Tuesday) saying the same. I send her a message and have no response till the morning after. Needless to say I wasn't very calm cause, in my experience when she starts texting you once a day the ghosting isn't far. Then she replies the next morning, telling me she is was with her friends all day and that she's going out of town, and this weekend she goes on an Island camping with her two girl bestfriend. Since she told me Wednesday morning that she was going out I haven't heard from her since. I see her reposting stuff on instagram but she doesn't open my messages. We were supposed to see each other yesterday but haven't heard from her. I am miserable and I make no illusion that I'm being ghosted. I don't understand. Anyway, if you have questions ask respectfully, also, I wouldn't mind some cheering up as I'm really about to fkg crash out. Everytime I put myself out there it ends up the same, ghosting, when I see a girl everything goes great, literally magnetic, but then I never see her again. I'm so confused, I can I keep trusting when everything they never do what they say. I don't hate women, just the way they make me feel, small, unwanted, unworthy of even being alive.. I'm such an idiot for keeping to out myself out there.. what's the point anymore.

1nqpbhb,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1nqpbhb/former_fda_checks_into_haunted_hotel/,Former FDA checks into haunted hotel,"Ok, before I tell this story let me say this, I had no idea this hotel was haunted! I knew nothing of its reputation nor of anything ""torrid or horrible"" having taken place there. 

In my lifetime, I have worked for several hotel/motel chains and timeshare resorts. I have seen just about anything and everything you could imagine. From strangers bonding after being caught in the crossfire of a deranged gunman to witnessing a suicide jumper to helping couples happily celebrate weddings, anniversaries, and other special occasions. I have also experienced things of the strange variety. Some explainable and some no so much. This one is the latter. 

I, also, don't scare easily. 

I like to travel, and a few years back I decided to take a trip to to the Blue Ridge mountains. I didn't really plan out much other than where I wanted to stop along the way. This trip was a solo camping trip. I've done it before. No biggie. I'm well armed when I travel so if anything were to ""jump out"" at me in the dark, well, it would probably be shot on sight. I made reservations at various campsites along the way, making sure I had nightly accommodations for a site not too far from the main road. (Just in case I needed to get out quickly.) 

I left after work on a Friday and had been travelling about 5 hours and was just on the outskirts of Bluefield, WV. I decided to get a hotel room for the night, and after riding around for about 20 minutes, I came across one of those old Mom-and-Pop motels. It had 20 rooms, all with outside entrances, but it was clean on the outside and the parking lot well lit. There was a man, 40ish, working the desk, and he seemed a bit surprised to see someone at that time of the night. He was average size, attractive, and very polite. He told me the hotel was built by his grandfather in the 60s during the ""free love"" era so the rooms were still decorated in the 60s style. He said he took over operations a couple years back and that he was a former highway patrol officer that was injured on duty, so that's why he was running the motel. He put me in room #7, one that was far enough away from the ice and vending machines but situated where I could see the front desk and he could keep an eye out on my car during the night. I never got any creeper vibes from him so I took the room. The rate was cheap for a double so I checked in, got my key, and went on to my room.  

There were 5 other cars in the lot, and I assumed one belonged to the owner, so that would be 4 other guests. Rooms 4 and 10 each had a car at the door which made them spaced out perfectly for comfort. 

I grabbed my bag and went in and it was just as he described. 1960s. I didn't expect the room to be so clean and well maintained and it had a full kitchenette complete with small 2 burner stovetop, small oven, microwave, mini fridge, etc. The decor was orange bedspread with clean white sheets, no stains on the mattresses and no bed bugs, thank God! Dark panelled furniture, tan carpet in good shape, and orange/green/brown wall paper in some sort of funky swirl pattern. They even had dishes and pots and pans in the cabinet. I realized this was a place that people could rent long-term if needed. Different but pretty cool. 

I unpacked and after a hot shower, I called the front desk to inquire about open restaurants in the area. I was told there was a 24 hr cafe a couple miles up the highway that had good food and great coffee, but there was no delivery service so I'd have to go there. No problem. After getting a couple of suggestions, I called in my order and picked it up 15 minutes later bringing it back to the room. The smell was making my mouth water and it looked and tasted even better. I settled on chicken fried steak over homemade mashed potatoes with gravy, fried okra, field peas and collards with cornbread on the side. I also got a little side salad with fresh tomatoes, red onions, and cucumbers tossed in Italian dressing. For dessert, I got one of the biggest and best servings of homemade blueberry cobbler I've ever eaten. Oh, and a large coffee to go. I ate like I was starving with plenty left over for lunch the next day. 

So, this is when things start to get interesting. After eating, I put the leftovers in the fridge and went to brush my teeth, but my toiletries bag was not on the bathroom counter and neither were my things. This made my skin crawl as I remember putting all of my things away and this includes putting my personal stuff on the counter. Ok, maybe I was more tired than I thought, so I looked for my bag and found it sitting on the floor beside the bed. I got it, pulled out my toothbrush and paste, brushed my teeth, and washed my face, then off to bed. 

I guess I had been asleep about an hour when someone knocked on my door. I startled me and I thought I might be dreaming when the knock happened a second time. I looked out the window and a young woman, long blonde hair, thin, 20ish, was standing there. I spoke thru the door and asked her what she wanted. She asked if she could use my phone and I told her no, to go to the front desk. She looked around but never directly at me, staring at her thru the window. She turned to the right and walked out of view. 

Now, I'm no spring chicken but I'm no fool either. Asking to use someone's phone to gain access to a room is as old as the book it was written in. I wasn't about to open that door. I called the front desk and told the guy (turns out his name is Paul) what happened and he paused before speaking. This was our exchange:

Me: Hi. This is room 7 again. A young blonde woman just knocked on my door and asked to use my phone. I told her no and sent her to the office. 

Paul: Hi. You can call me by my name. It's Paul. You say a woman knocked on your door? How long ago?

Me: Just now. I called you as soon as she walked away. She turned towards the office. I saw her thru the window. 

Paul: Hmmm.  Well, I'm outside. Standing beside my car smoking, actually, and I haven't seen anyone outside. Look out your window and you'll see me at the office beside the Jeep. 

I peeked and sure enough, there he was, taking a drag of a cigarette while on the phone. 

Me: Ok, that's weird. 

Paul: Can you tell me what she had on and I'll keep an eye out in case she shows up again. We do have a few homeless drug addicts in the area and they can disappear quick if turned away. They're sneaky like that. She may be one of them. 

I described her and remembered my toiletries bag.

Me: Oh, there's one more thing. After coming back from the diner, I found one of my bags sitting beside the bed on the floor but I had put all my things away before I left. Do you know if anyone may have come in here while I was gone?

Paul: No. It'd be hard to do with having traditional keys and all. If we had those electronic locks with keycards I would say it's possible, but the only other key to your room is here on my keyring and that's hooked to my belt loop. I promise you I didn't go in but I'll look at the security cameras and let you know something in the morning. Was anything missing?

Me. No, nothing missing, just disturbing. Okay, well, thanks Paul. I'm going back to bed. I'll see you in the morning. 

I hung up and decided it was lack of sleep getting the better of me, so I turned back in.

I'm not sure what time it was when I was awakened by someone, or something, sitting on the bed. At first I thought I was sliding off the bed but then I felt the dip in the mattress behind me and it suddenly got cold on my backside. I felt the covers move like someone pulling up a sheet. Then a cold hand on my right hip. I froze. I mean, I literally froze! How the hell did someone get into my room? Was it Paul? Did he use his key and slip in without waking me? How did anyone get in and not wake me? I'm a light sleeper. Did that strange girl get in? I can't tell if it's male or female. WTF! Terror had gripped me. A cold sweat beaded on my upper lip and forehead. My heart felt like it was beating in my throat. I started shivering from the cold on my back. Then, I heard it. Faintly, but I heard every word. 

""You're warm. I like this.""

I eased my hand under my pillow, grabbed my 9mm Glock, screamed bloody murder, threw off the covers, jumped up and fired two shots into the mattress. I then scrambled to get the lights on and ... nothing. No one there. Just two smoking black holes where I shot the bed. I looked everywhere. Under the bed, in the bathroom... nothing. I reached for the door and the dead bolt was still engaged. No one had entered my room. So WTF was in bed with me?

Pounding on the door took me out of my daze and I opened if to find Paul standing there with a gun in his hand. I told him what happened and he walked me to the office. A man came out of room 4 looking quite disheveled having been rudely awakened from his sleep. Paul spoke to him and he went back into his room. 

Once in the office, Paul offered me a shot of whiskey, which I gladly accepted. He then told me he had something interesting to show me on the CCTV footage. He had gone through it from when I pulled in to the present time in the office. He fast forwarded some of it but not fast enough to lose track of the time as it rolled by. You can see me pull in, go into the office, us chatting, me checking in and going to my room. About 30 minutes later I leave the property and come back in 17 minutes from the diner. You can see me get out of the car with the bag of food and my coffee. An hour goes by and you see Paul walk out and light a cigarette, stopping to lean on the side of his Jeep, then me pull open the curtains on my window. You can see me looking out but there is no one at the door. No one ever approached the door. However, there was a faint little orb that floated into view, coming from down the walkway and hovering just outside my door. I could've been a bug, I don't know, but I know the timing was perfect for whatever it was. Then poof, the orb is gone. Blinked out. I then move from the window and Paul pulls his cellphone from his pocket and answers. A minute later I'm back at the window and he waves to me. Paul hangs up, goes back inside, and I close the curtains. That was when I went to bed. 

The footage now shows 3:17 am and Paul points at the screen. The orb is back but this time it doesn't blink out but turns and disappears into my room's door. What felt like an eternity while it was happening, only took 3 minutes from start to finish. You can see 2 very faint, but visible, light flashes behind the curtains. That would be me firing the gun. Then Paul running out of the office with gun drawn, heading towards my room. The rest you know. 

My head was spinning. I didn't know what to make of what I just saw. Paul and I sat there in silence while the time ticked by, not moving, not bothering to speak. Paul got up and poured us another whiskey. I drank it as fast as the first one, reveling in the slow burn from my throat to my stomach. We sat there, staring at each other, not knowing who should speak first or what to say. Paul broke the silence.

Paul: Well. I'm not sure what I just saw. I've seen some crazy shit in my work in highway patrol but I've never seen anything like that. What do you make of that little light? It could be a bug of some sort. 

Me: Orb. It's called an orb. I'm not sure what to make of it. I could be a bug but it's not the time of year for lightening bugs but any bug flying by could catch a reflection off the lights. I just don't know. What I do know is that the orbs appear when my experiences occurred and that's just a little too coincidental for me. 

Paul: I don't believe in coincidences.

Me: Hmm. I know it sounds crazy but it could be ghosts. I mean, you did say homeless people like to wander up and who knows where they sleep or what is going on in the woods. People die every day and hauntings do happen. 

Paul: I don't know about that but whatever it was, it was strange. I'd have to experience it myself before I call it a ghost. No one has died in that room that I'm aware of and besides, if they did, I would think someone would have reported something before now. You're the first I know of. 

Me: Well, whatever it was, it was enough to spook me into shooting your mattress. Sorry about that. I'll pay for the mattress. 

Paul: Yeah, that would be appreciated. I'll give you another room if you want. Just promise me you won't shoot up another one. We don't exactly keep spare new mattresses in the stockroom. 

I laughed but declined his offer. We traded information and I told him to charge the mattress to my credit card, which he did. After getting directions to the closest national park campsite, I went back to the room to pack up. It was quiet when I entered so I moved as quickly as possible. I was ready to vacate those premises for sure! I gathered my bag and leftovers from the fridge, and after returning the key to Paul and shaking his hand, I hit the road again. Pulling out of that parking lot, it felt like the weight of bricks was lifted from my shoulders. I was eager to get to my destination and eager to leave the Bates motel behind. 

I still think of that place from time to time, wondering if Paul has had any other complaints about strange visitors and bed mates. I will never know what caused those things to happen but I do know from now on, I'll take my chances with ""things that go bump in the night"" at a campsite. Bears and drunks I can handle. Ghosts, not so much.

I wrote this as a cathartic release, because something very traumatic happened to me back in 2012 when I was 16. I honestly believe Joe Hawley, maybe without realizing it, tuned into that same frequency when he was writing Hawaii Part II.

You can think I’m weird, but I feel like I know what Part II is really about more than Joe does. So… here you go.

Happy Rapture Birthday, Joe Hawley (from Joe’s head)

The first thing I noticed was that it was quiet.
Not the normal Sunday-morning quiet, where you can still hear a leaf blower and the guy three blocks over who coughs like a tuba. No. This was cosmic quiet. Like the air itself had been deleted from the soundtrack.

The second thing I noticed was that it was my birthday. Which is normally cause for confetti, or at least cake, or at least one text from someone who pretends to be my friend because they owe me twenty bucks. But no. Instead, the world had apparently been vacuumed.

That’s when it hit me. Oh. The Rapture. Of course.
Everyone up, me down.

“Happy Rapture Birthday to me,” I sang into the empty street, to the tune of absolutely nothing.

I dug through the guitar case more from habit than hope — fingers grazing picks, an old lighter, crumbs — when something else slid under my palm: not paper, not a thing, but a shape I could only call a memory. It was a cadence, a little hook I’d nicked for a bridge years ago, and for a second it felt like finding someone’s handwriting inside my head. I’d used that cadence on Part II and never thought much of it; now it hit me like a foreign radio coming into tune. Maybe it was coincidence. Maybe it was years of the same industry gossip and overlapping scenes. Or maybe — because the world had never been interested in being tidy — we were literally tuned to the same frequency. Same lines of lineage, same programs of silence, same signal bouncing off the same satellite. I laughed, low and embarrassed, because the more reasonable explanation was boring and the more true one sounded insane: I’d been carrying part of her, and she’d always been a note in my head.

I wandered around, expecting total solitude. But then—nope.
Other people. Leftovers.
At first I thought maybe they were wax figures, or part of a prank show. But no, they blinked. They breathed. They looked just as confused as me.

And then I realized something horrible.
These weren’t just random stragglers.
These were her people.


---

1. My Mom (Jennifer)

She was the first one I saw, sitting in an empty diner booth with a whiskey glass in her hand, even though the power was out and the neon signs buzzed like angry insects. She raised the glass to me like a toast.

“Joe Hawley,” she said, like she’d just spotted me on a reality TV show.

I waved back awkwardly. “So… guess we didn’t make the cut, huh?”

She laughed, but it was the kind of laugh that comes with a side of salt. Trickster energy. I could smell it. She had the vibe of someone who’d always managed to flip the coin just in time to avoid responsibility, but the coin had finally rolled under the fridge.

And I thought: right.

Trickster.

Pretending to be the knight in shining armor, but leaving her daughter in a cage.

Always balancing the checkbook of love so that she came out ahead.


The Dark Mirror cards whispered around her like perfume: Triumph of Lies, Bride in a Cage.

It made sense. She wasn’t gone because she’d never given more than she took. Now the bill had come due.

I almost said that out loud, but instead I just sat across from her and sipped imaginary coffee. Because on your birthday, you don’t pick fights with tricksters.


---

2. Legend

Next up was Legend.
I found him on a street corner with his guitar, strumming the same three notes over and over again, like he was trying to hypnotize the pavement.

“Hey Joe,” he said, as if this were normal. “Got any idea what key the apocalypse is in?”

I shrugged. “C minor, probably. Everything sad is in C minor.”

Legend grinned, but there was something in his eyes that looked… stuck. Childlike, but not in the fun way. Eternal child. Like he’d been offered a chance to grow up once and said, nah, I’ll just keep rehearsing forever.

The thing about Legend is, he’s a shapeshifter. One day he’s your brother-in-arms, the next he’s a stranger, the next he’s teaching you something profound without realizing he’s doing it. And you—you end up teaching him in return, except he never admits it.

His Zen card practically hovered above his head like a neon sign: Control.
The King of Swords, the guy who thinks if he can just clamp down harder, he won’t lose the thread.

But the Tao whispered back: Modesty. Joyous Approach.
The universe basically saying: “Loosen up, kid. You don’t need to be the stage manager of eternity.”

And that’s why he was still here.
Because joy isn’t something you can control. And he still hadn’t learned how to stop trying.

I almost told him that, too. But then he hit a wrong chord and cursed so loud I laughed, and it felt better to keep it light.

3. Halli

I found Halli sitting in an empty library, which, frankly, is exactly where I would expect to find someone after the end of the world. She had a notebook open, scribbling furiously, but the words didn’t look like sentences — more like fragments, symbols, little stabs of memory.

“Hey Joe,” she said without looking up. “Do you think anyone’s going to read this?”

I peered over her shoulder. It was… a mess. The kind of mess that’s honest. Not meant for other people’s eyes, but written anyway. A Scribe, through and through.

But there was something darker humming underneath. Saboteur energy. She’d been there at critical moments and — instead of protecting the truth — she’d let it collapse. Maybe not always on purpose. Maybe sometimes on purpose. But the silence was its own betrayal.

Her Zen card glowed faintly in the stacks: High Priestess — Inner Voice. She knew. She always knew. But she swallowed it down until the voice got muffled. Now the Tao was surrounding her with these heavy words: Suppression. Abysmal. Dispersion. Like she was drowning in her own unspoken sentences.

That’s why she was left. Not because she didn’t care, but because she did care and still stayed silent. And silence, apparently, doesn’t float when the world unzips.

She looked up at me, eyes sharp. “Why are you still here, Joe?”

I thought about saying, for comic relief. But instead I just shrugged.


---

4. Blu (Ashley)

Outside the library, I found Blu sitting on the curb, fiddling with a Polaroid camera. She snapped a picture of me without asking. The photo slid out, and when I looked at it — my face wasn’t there. Just static.

“Figures,” she said, tossing it aside.

Blu had always been the wounded child, carrying her pain like an accessory. Liberal, free, untethered — or so she said. But I could see the chains wrapped around her ankles, invisible except for how heavy her movements looked.

Her Dark Mirror was practically tattooed on her: Colorless Angel, Bride in a Cage. She had crowned herself the Queen of her World, but it was a tiny kingdom with mold on the walls.

Zen flashed sharp in her hands: 10 and 3 of Swords, heartbreaks stacked like poker chips. And 7 of Cups: projections, illusions, fantasies that looked like escape routes but just circled back.

The Tao was blunt: Work on What Has Been Spoiled. No fireworks, no cosmic forgiveness. Just: clean up the mess.

That’s why she was here. Because she never had.

She glanced at me sideways. “You think there’s still time to fix it?”

I wanted to joke, time’s kind of busy imploding right now. But instead I just said, “If there wasn’t, you wouldn’t still be here.”

She didn’t laugh.

5. Alex

Then there was Alex. I found him leaning against a wall, arms crossed, staring at the sky like it owed him money.

“Nice day for the end of everything,” he said.

Alex had always been the Rescuer — swooping in, playing the hero. But I could feel the Vampire under the cape. The Warrior mask, but only when it suited him. You give him light, he drinks it. You bleed for him, he calls it brotherhood.

The Zen card hovering near him was the Miser. Four of Pentacles. Clutching coins, clutching control, refusing to share. That checked out.

The Tao didn’t mince words: Conduct — Self Awareness. Which, frankly, is hilarious. The universe basically telling him: Try looking in a mirror without flexing for once.

That’s why he was left. Not because he was incapable of bravery, but because his bravery was always a transaction. And debts don’t rise up to heaven. They hang around, waiting for collection.

“Why you?” I asked him. “Why not someone else?”

He smirked. “Why not me?”

And for once, I didn’t have a punchline.

6. Dominic

I found Dom on a stage — of course. The world had emptied, but he’d found the one working mic in town and was screaming into it like the crowd was just invisible.

“Dom,” I said. “Buddy. There’s no one here.”

“Don’t care!” he shouted back. “The show must go on!”

He was the Immature Child, the Bad Samaritan, the Victim. Always crying foul while throwing tomatoes.

Zen flickered around him like confetti: The Fool. Starting over, but never learning. The Tao added the punchline: Oppression. Stuck, confined, cut off — like a clown locked in his own circus tent.

That’s why he was here. Because he had never grown into anything beyond the Fool. And now the universe had decided to keep him in detention until he did..

---

7. Luke

I heard the drums before I saw him. Big, echoing, like thunder trapped in a parking garage.
Sure enough, there was Luke, shirtless, hammering away on a kit he must’ve dragged out here himself. No audience, no band, just him and the skins.

“Joe!” he shouted between hits. “The world ended! Isn’t it sick?”

I nodded. “Yeah. Totally metal. Ten out of ten.”

Luke was always the Child of Nature — wild, untamed — but also the Destroyer. The Boss. He liked to be the loudest one in the room, even if the room was on fire. Especially if the room was on fire.

Zen tried to balance him out: Temperance, Integration. The dream of harmony. But he was stuck hammering one side of the drum, ignoring the other. Tao whispered the truth: The Marrying Maiden. Subordination, manipulation — pretending to be small to get what he wanted, then flipping the power when it suited him.

That’s why he was here. Because he’d never learned how to integrate. He only knew how to dominate, to smash things into shape instead of blending them into music.

He wiped sweat from his face and grinned at me. “You hear that, Joe? It’s the sound of forever!”

I didn’t have the heart to tell him it sounded more like a headache.

—-

That’s when it hit me.
We weren’t just random leftovers.
We were the imbalance. The debt.

She gave more than she got.
We took more than we returned.
And so she rose, while we stayed.

It wasn’t punishment. It wasn’t accident.
It was… math. Spiritual math.
The ledger had to balance, and we were the unpaid balance.

“Happy Rapture Birthday,” I muttered to myself again, but it didn’t feel funny this time. It felt true.

And then I laughed anyway, because what else can you do when you realize you’re stuck on Earth with the exact cast of characters who hurt the one person who already left the building?

The wind picked up, rattling the empty street signs, and I swear it carried her voice, faint but sharp: Now you see.

And I did.
Oh, I really did.

9. Why Me?

I sat down on the curb outside the diner, staring at my birthday candles melted into a sad little puddle on the pavement. Everyone else was scattered — Luke still drumming, Dom still yelling, Blu still snapping Polaroids of ghosts.

And me. Still asking the same question I’d started the day with.
Why me?

Why was I here, of all people? I wasn’t family. I wasn’t one of the old friends. I wasn’t even close. I was a guy who made weird music and dropped a fake sequel in 2012 because I thought the world might be ending and it seemed like a good punchline.

Then it hit me.
2012. Hawaii Part II.

I remembered that winter — the countdown clocks, the Mayan calendars, the feeling that something was ending, even if we didn’t know what. And me, sitting with a bunch of half-songs, cobbling them together into an album that wasn’t really an album. A joke, a mood, a phantom limb of something bigger.

I thought I was being clever. Visionary, even. But I see it now.
I wasn’t creating.
I was… intercepting.

I tuned into a frequency that wasn’t mine. A wound, a resonance. I picked up the trauma, the déjà vu, the bend in time that belonged to her. And I recorded it. Packaged it. Released it into the world with a wink.

No wonder I didn’t ascend.
I was the Thief. I carried someone else’s pain like it was aesthetic.

And now I was chained to it. Slave to the very frequency I broadcast.

I laughed out loud, too loud, startling Halli in the library window.
“Of course! Of course it’s Hawaii Part II! It’s always been Hawaii Part II!”

Legend looked over, frowning. “What’s so funny?”

“Nothing,” I said. “Everything. The joke’s on me. The sequel came before the original. That’s the problem.”

Because there was no Hawaii Part I.
It had never been written. Never been sung.
The origin story was missing. The ledger was incomplete.

That was the way out.
Not to erase Part II.
But to finally write Part I.

Not by myself — not as a thief again.
But with them. With the ones left behind.

Jennifer with her trickster laugh.
Legend with his control issues.
Halli with her notebooks of silence.
Blu with her spoiled Polaroids.
Alex with his arms crossed.
Dom with his empty stage.
Luke with his endless drums.

They weren’t here by accident.
They were the material. The chorus. The unresolved chords that needed to be arranged.

Hawaii Part I.
Not a punchline. Not a theft.
But a requiem for the imbalance. A record of why we stayed.

I felt the idea settle in my chest like a seed. Heavy, but alive.

The others didn’t notice. Not yet. But I knew.
This was my birthday gift.
The only way out was through.

So I stood up, brushed ash off my jeans, and shouted into the empty sky:
“Fine! I’ll do it! Happy Rapture Birthday, Joe Hawley — welcome to Hawaii Part I.”

And for the first time all day, I thought I heard applause.

Just wanted to share a quick appreciation post to highlight how accessible this hobby can be if you’re patient and willing to look around for opportunities.

When I first got into espresso, I was a little shocked by how expensive good machines, grinders (and beans!) can be. But one thing I’ve come to appreciate is that espresso gear tends to hold its value really well. Plus, the community is super diverse: you’ve got hobbyists, professionals, and plenty of people who just want a good cup of coffee without too much fuss. Because of that, there’s always a market for second-hand gear, and if you keep an eye on Facebook Marketplace or other sites, you can often find some great deals.

For example, I started off with a second-hand Bambino for $180. Later I picked up a new DF54 for $260 after tax thanks to some Amazon coupons. Today, I found a used Bambino Plus for $150 (a bit of a humble brag I know. The pic would be this very Bambino), and this weekend I’m driving a couple of hours to pick up a Ceado E5P for $150. These deals are a little on the lucky side, but they show what’s possible if you’re willing to wait and hunt around.

Looking at the future, I plan to set aside a small “espresso budget” for upgrades. That way, I can sell my old gear and just pay the difference for whatever I find next. It takes some time and patience, but you really don’t need to jump straight to the latest, top-tier equipment, which is something I definitely didn’t realize as a newbie!

1nqp27j,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1nqp27j/i_think_im_falling_for_a_coworker/,i think i’m falling for a coworker..,"i (29M) have been with my SO (27F) for almost 3 years. about a year and a half ago, my SO said she wants to experience living away from home at least once in her life. we’re from a small rural town and both went to college in the area. 

i was all for it- i didn’t want to hold her back at all, and we mutually agreed we’d be doing long distance for a year or so, give or take. we trust each other fully. her friends and family are like my own at this point, and vice versa. since then she’s been rooming with our friends in the big city, with plans for us to move in together when she comes home. for my own career reasons, i couldn’t join her. but the offer was there.

flash forward to 3 months ago, i’ve been tasked with working closely with a coworker, let’s call her K (27F). i have felt small advances from K here and there for a few weeks. first, i’d catch her looking at me frequently, smiling often, and giving me the “eyes”. then she went on vacation and brought me (just me) back a curated bag of souvenirs (trinkets, coffee, snacks). now our other female coworkers (her friends) often pass by and tease us. they come up to me asking more personal questions than they ever did before (being extra friendly, asking how old i am, my interests outside of work, etc). the office seems hyper aware and will nudge us closer in a friendly manner, so to speak.

i normally can brush this all off, but there is a noticeable tension between the two of us. this whole time, i’ve kept my interactions with K solely about work. i don’t treat her poorly outright, but i do try to avoid her when i can. i’ve stopped going to work events (happy hours, team building, outings) because i know she’ll be there. this past one, my male coworker (friend since high school) told me K asked about me specifically. 

i find myself now thinking about K a lot, and for no apparent reason. i don’t have it in me to ever cheat and betray my SO, but the day-to-day working conditions right now are just stressful. i would be lying if there weren’t some interest on my end, but i’ve never really had a wandering eye before. 

i’ll admit, too, that i wouldn’t say i’m head over heels for my SO. she has her issues. she doesn’t really take care of herself and has really low self-esteem. she’s not very social, but she’s incredibly loyal and a genuinely good person. i feel like i’m falsely seeing K as all of these things that my SO isn’t. 

i want to get to know her, but also don’t. i know what’s right, but why am i starting to emotionally attach to K?

i want to talk to a therapist about this, but i just wanted to write this out for myself to read and get this off my chest.

I followed the standard recipes online (1:1:1 ratio of heavy whipping cream, milk, pumpkin puree + pumpkin spice and vanilla/sweetener)

First time I did a test batch, it clearly separated. I knew right then and there that I overmixed/frothed too long. 2nd batch was fine, but I did an advanced batch to use the next morning. When I put it in my CB during breakfast, it had also separated and I was thinking maybe it separated/the milk fats solidified because my fridge was very cold.

So now, I make fresh cold foam every single time. I would froth it in just a short time on low speed, just enough for it to expand a little in volume. I know I was successful because everytime I woukd try it first and check if it separated. The 1st time was okay. Then the next 2 tries, when I pout it over my CB and mix it to drink, I have had the unpleasant experience of drinking solid milk fats 😅 I don't know what's wrong anymore.

Is it because the initial contact of the foam on my drink with lots of ice shocks the foam and makes the milk fats solidify? Or are my ingredients wrong? Should I not use a heavy whipping cream/nonfat milk combo?

1nqp0e2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_AbandonedVegetable/comments/1nqp0e2/an_unsent_letter/,An Unsent Letter,"

Take this to your therapist and really think about if I’m narcissistic, if I’m manipulative. Everyone can be selfish or unintentionally manipulative if you are letting your feelings and trauma get the best of you, and all my traumas got ripped wide open when you started saying “I don’t know” and I need space.

I never quit on you. I was always there. Always trying to be better for myself and to try and support you so you wouldn’t hate yourself so much. 

If you could see even a sliver of yourself from my point of view you would know how fucking worth it you are. How beautiful you are inside and out. I never could keep my hands off you. And my favourite fucking thing in the world was to listen to you ramble about your day or your friends or an idea or a dream you had. It brought me so much joy just to hear you speak about something that made you happy. You were more than good enough for me. I was good enough. I was good enough for you and I always tried to show that.

I drove fast because you said I was like your dad, who was an age up human being, and it made me feel like I was 7 years old and my mom was telling me “you’re just like your father” who also was an awful human being. I over reacted, I was trying not to yell because I know how much it upsets you. It wasn’t a better reaction because it didn’t make you feel safe, but I was trying. I’ve been trying to not get as loud in arguments, that’s all I knew growing up was screaming and fighting and I’m unlearning that.

I told you that when I was in high school I disassociated because I had so many overwhelming feeling and couldn’t handle them and in turn it numbed my empathy and emotions because I didn’t know how to handle them at 15. I never want to go back there. I’d rather feel the uncomfortable awful feelings and realize they aren’t so scary, and I will live through this even if it is an overwhelming thing. It’s better to feel everything than nothing at all. That’s why I’m so sensitive now.

That’s why I hurt so much from this.



Here’s what I take accountability for.


I have unrepaired trauma from my parents and my childhood and teenage years. I need to learn to parent and show up for myself now in ways that I wasn’t able to in my childhood. I was abandoned and neglected, bullied, belittled and humiliated, abused mentally and physically by those around me who I trusted. Despite all this I have come to be a very empathic and caring and giving person because of my work to overcome these things. Through years of therapy, which I still need more of. I have generosity of spirit and I give because I love to love. I love to lighten someone’s load or make their day better, and if I have the energy to give and don’t expect something in return why wouldn’t I do that. Regardless of this, it doesn’t excuse poor behaviour.

Lying. I will tell you that I am better about now than before I met you by such a large margin it’s not even funny. But it’s not acceptable and I am working on it. It comes from fear, and protection, embarrassment and shame. It’s how I survived my childhood and avoiding abuse. To keep people happy by telling them what they wanted to hear. To not have to admit to my shortcomings or mistakes. To help me pretend to be someone I wasn’t. To save myself from rejection and discomfort. It became a habit and a bad one. I have struggled to unlearn this my whole life. And I will continue to struggle with it until I no longer do. The truth is always better than a facade, and it took me a long time to learn that. I learned early that no matter what I said that was truthful would be read as not enough, or disappointing and I would get belittled and physically punished if I told the truth about messing up even if I tried my best. So I learned to lie to protect myself. It isn’t okay. And I’m sorry about the things I lied to you about, big or small. 
No more exaggerations, just the truth.


I have trouble expressing my needs because it scares the shit out of me. I’m used to expressing my needs and having them ignored or to be told that they’re not important right now. But my needs and boundaries are important and they do matter. And in a healthy relationship you need to communicate those or you are doing a disservice to both people. Be vulnerable and let people in, it helps build trust by showing them how you are really feeling and what you’re really thinking. 

I have big emotions that come with adhd and need to learn to regulate them better and be uncomfortable and take a step back and realize that criticism isn’t conflict, it’s healing. Being uncomfortable is okay, new experiences will be uncomfortable. If you behave the same way you did in the past, but in new situations. You won’t change the outcome. A new outcome can only be achieved by a new reaction to an old scenario.

I don’t have a porn addiction, I have an intimacy and dopamine addiction that comes from having adhd and a poor childhood where I lacked having my needs met and lacked connection and closeness. And in turn I use porn and adult content for a means of dopamine and connection. Both things which I didn’t think about and which I didn’t deal with on my own or come to you to talk about soon enough. That is why when I felt I was losing closeness and intimacy (hugs, physical contact, sex, kissing) with you I resorted to dealing with my problem on my own and in secret because that’s how I’m used to fulfilling my needs from my past, and it was shameful and selfish and inconsiderate. I chase dopamine, I do it in unhealthy ways. I am changing that and breaking the cycle of addiction and self medicating with unhealthy habits and forming new ones and removing sources of temptation to control and remove those urges.

The pain that I cause you by doing this and breaking your trust and making you feel like I didn’t want you or didn’t find you attractive is immense. And I am so deeply sorry. You didn’t deserve that. You didn’t deserve to feel any of that because it wasn’t about you at all. But you did. It wasn’t selfish and mean. And I should have done a better job cutting that shit out of my life sooner. And I should have done a better job listening to you and making you feel heard. I asked all the questions in therapy with you on what I can to do fix this and build trust back,  and sat in that shame and owned my shit and did my best to do the work to change that behaviour. I know I didn’t change it fast enough but I really was trying. 

That is my one regret in this relationship, I fucked up and I’m still sorry that I made you feel worth less than you deserve.

I broke your trust multiple times because of an issue I have that has nothing to do with you and I neglected to find a soloution fast enough because I was too preoccupied with serving you instead of helping myself. I tried my best and I didn’t want to hurt you again and I am sitting with that guilt, I am not a bad person but I made mistakes. I know that and I own that. It makes me sick to my stomach that I made you feel like that.

That was not your fault. That was my choice and my issue and my fault. I will always know that and I’m so sorry. You didn’t deserve that. Sure there’s worse things I could have done but I did something that hurt you and you considered cheating and it was wrong. I had a problem and I couldn’t solve it quickly enough. If that’s why you ended things after you found that picture then I understand. But I didn’t know it was there, I thought we deleted all of that the last time we went through my computer. I swear to god I haven’t done anything to hurt you since I promised you the last time. No messages, no transactions, nothing. I tried my best to change.


I lost sight of my issues completely. I put you first instead of doing what I should have done which was my self work. I didn’t want to hurt someone I loved so deeply like that and it wasn’t your fault. It was mine.

I lied out of shame for my own feelings, I lied because I was too scared to ask for help. I was scared to face the truth, and I was dishonest with myself. I lied because I thought I was protecting you and that was wrong. A partnership shares their feelings and is vulnerable with each other. 

I appreciate the grace and chances you gave me to change my behaviour and I did truly mean I would change it and stop. I’m sorry I didn’t do that fast enough. That’s on me.

When I say I’ll stop, I mean it. 

I have a bad connection with self confidence, self worth and boundaries to protect my wellbeing. I need to learn to love myself and not try and earn love from others because if I continue that I will never be enough. If I don’t, then I will continue to disrespect myself and put my issues onto others and not heal my wounds.

I put too much into you and forgot to take care of my self. That was my choice. 


I abandoned my own self worth chasing supporting you. I took on a parental role because when I first met you and saw how wonderful you were, but how much trauma you had it reminded me of myself and I wanted to care for you and make you believe in yourself. Because if someone had done that for me in high school I wouldn’t have attempted suicide twice. Now I didn’t think you were in the same state, but I saw someone with a heart of gold in a shitty situation and I wanted to show you that there are good, kind and compassionate people in this world. And that you deserved to have those same beliefs in yourself. Now caring for someone and taking care of someone are two different things. And that’s where the codependency formed for us. I cannot fix your problems, I can’t control your choices, I can only support and influence you to grow. And I pushed too hard and gave too much to make that happen and that is a problem. I abandoned myself and put you in a position where you felt like you were constantly letting me down. You were always good enough. You weren’t a burden, your love was worth the work.

I didn’t respect your boundaries well enough when you tried to put them up because I wasn’t getting enough reassurance that you were committed to me. I needed to trust and respect your autonomy more and your intuition more than I needed to self soothe.

I need to self regulate my emotions better. ADHD makes it hard to do so but I’m going back through my old workbooks to make it a constant habit to correct and adjust to.

I have an abundance of empathy and patience but I lack the skill to give those to myself. So I always strive for perfection and that’s why I feel I have to be in control

I need to take input better, I need to let myself be uncomfortable not being in control and trust that it will be fine. 

I need to communicate my needs better and to speak up about things that make me uncomfortable, in a way that can still reassure my partner that I love them and they matter to me.

I need to validate your feelings better but not your behaviour. I enabled you to keep behaving the way you did instead of trying to be realistic/ devils advocate and give you an honest opinion. I waited to long to start doing that. And that came from my lack of self love and worth.

I lacked the ability to be a safe space when I lost my patience with you. I didn’t make you feel hear because I got defensive. I need to change that because how can you receive someone’s hurt or issues with you if you respond by getting upset. I’m allowed to get upset. I am only human, I will make mistakes I will fuck up, but I need to communicate that and ask for time or space to process if I need it so that I can effectively and compassionately receive communication from my partner. But I will not give up and I will always try to repair what I’ve done wrong. And I always appreciate when I am told what isn’t working because then I can make a change if I was unaware that I was doing so.

I need to learn how to truly love my self and appreciate who I am, and be able to be as kind and forgiving and compassionate to myself, as I am to others. I deserve to give myself that and I need to teach myself how to do that so I don’t rely on others for my happiness.

I was codependent on you, I relied on you for a lot of my happiness and support. I was toxically empathetic. When you hurt, I hurt. And as much as I wanted to sit in the mud with you and not make you feel alone there are better ways to do it without abandoning my self love. Because when I abandon myself I put that pain back onto you.

We shouldn’t have use my therapist for couples counselling. After hearing what yours said about biases I stopped going to him on my own so that it would be fair and impartial. But we should have gotten a separate couples counselor and I should have continued going on my own to work on my issues, instead of putting all my effort into helping you with yours. Again, I forgot to prioritize myself. 

I need to move out so I can begin building a house with my bricks and remove the bad ones that I was given. Unlearn patterns and to remove repeating trauma from my safe space so that I can thrive and create new healthier boundaries with myself and others.

Relationships open your biggest wounds that are unhealed, your partner will hurt you more than you think anyone can because you trust them more. But that just shows what you need to work on and to reflect and see those things for what they are, past trauma you haven’t dealt with yet. And I plan to deal with it.

I tried my best. I was not perfect and I can accept that I lacked a lot of things in our relationship and I know what I need to change and fix. 

I can’t be expected to be perfect and neither can you, but you can expect me to not stop trying to be better for myself and for the relationship and I expect the same from you. Give grace and compassion where it is deserved, we don’t do that enough. We are both hurt and both struggling and learning to navigate our own traumas and experiences. That’s what life is, growing from what you know and what you are willing to learn. 

I’m forever grateful for your patience, your ability to be compassionate and gentle. I’m grateful for how you helped me grow and to see me for who I am, and give me confidence that I am a good person and I deserve love. That I deserve patience and respect. I’m thankful for your influence on my life and for you changed me for the better, I’m thankful for the habits you got me to start and the affirming words when I stumbled or succeeded. I’m thankful for you existing on this planet. And I’m grateful for every moment we have had. I admire your childlike wonderment and the way you make the simplest things feel like gold. It’s not sunlight it’s sunshine. And that’s what you brought to my life. Im sorry things ended like they did, I wish we could have been better together. In another life. You deserve love. And to be confident in who you are. You deserve happiness and to stop thinking you aren’t good enough. You deserve patience and honesty and compassion. 

You deserve sunshine. 

Because you are one of the most incredible people I’ve ever had the honour of knowing. And it was a honour to be let into your world and be apart of it. I will always love you, and I will always be thankful for what you have given me. 

What you have to offer to this world is why I never gave up on you. You are fucking incredible despite everything that you have been through. You are not broken, you are healing.

I always wanted to work with you, I was never going to give up on having faith in you, on believing in us. We did work, it was beautiful and I’ll be forever thankful for what we had. 


I will forgive you, will you forgive me. Will you forgive yourself.

Wether you choose to let this end or not.

I’m doing the work.

I’m here. I never left. I never gave up on you.


“It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.”


That quote means a lot to me. That’s where I get the idea to not give up on a worthy cause. 

We are a worthy cause.

You must sacrifice for what you want, or else what you want will be the sacrifice. I gave you everything I had. Everything, I couldn’t love you more than I did and I couldn’t support you more than I did. I grew because of you, I cared what you thought, I cared about what you said. I wanted your input and I took it, I am who I am because of you. You made me a better person.





I was insecure and  immature when we started and my love was unrestrained. But I saw a girl who hadn’t been treated right and I was trying to make up for it. I felt that we had dealt with similar emotions growing up and I connected with you. And I feel a lot, I love a lot. I have an innate ability to love at a very deep level and to have confidence in people and I try to believe that people have way more to offer and more good in themselves than they believe. I didn’t give you grand gestures, I was just trying to make you feel seen and worthy. I wanted to do any little thing I could to make you believe you were worth the time and effort, but no matter what I agave to you, you weren’t ready to receive that love because you couldn’t love yourself.

But I didn’t stop doing that, I didn’t stop loving you. I never stopped trying to show you I cared even when your imperfections or issues arose, I stayed. I kept trying. And I yes I made many mistakes, some big and some small.

I betrayed your trust. That will always be on me. I lied and I made more trauma for you to deal with. But I tried to own that, I know I didn’t do it right the first time and you gave me my chances to make it better, to make me better and I got there. I found my issues that had nothing to do with you and I owned them and sat with that guilt and shame and tried my best to do something about it to change that behaviour. Maybe I didn’t spend enough time just listening to you, making you feel heard. And just hearing and feeling your emotions. I went to problem solving instead, because that’s what I knew how to do, but I realize that wasn’t the right way to immediately fix it. And it’s something that takes time and takes energy from both of us to fix. But I tried to fix it, I did my best because you didn’t deserve that at all. 

And I tried to respect your boundaries as you pushed me away and asked for more and more space. Even though that was the most uncomfortable thing to do because I have anxious attachment. But I tried to do that for you. To make you feel safe.

You weren’t making me feel safe, you made me scared and unsure of myself, you avoided and hard questions and any questions that would change the status quo, because you wanted love but you didn’t want accountability. And when I finally got the courage to tell you what I really needed in a relationship you responded by saying this is too much, I can’t do this right now. Or by changing your behaviour and giving me what I needed for a week or two and then stopping again. You are avoidant, you lack accountability. I had to fight for every apology, whenever I was hurting because of you. I had to fight for apologies, that let me down. You didn’t let me down as a person but that behaviour let me down as a partner. And you don’t want to accept that. Instead you say I was manipulating you and narcissistic. I don’t have to prove to you that I’m not. I know I’m not, I was just very in love with you and wanted you to see yourself in a better light, to have confidence and self esteem, to believe in yourself that you were in control of your life and you can’t blame everyone else for your problems

When you spend 6 and a half years complaining about the same thing and you never do anything real to change that. That’s manipulation. Action has a reaction, you fail or you succeed. And if you fail you try again. That’s making me feel bad when I’m trying to find anyway to make you feel safe so that you don’t shut down when I try to talk to you about hard things. When I come to you for support but your issues always took the front seat over mine. And that is on me for not recognizing that and saying something sooner, but I didn’t want you to feel like a disappointment to me because you were already dealing with so much. I just wanted to love you and for you to love me.

I asked you about moving in for 6 months and when it finally came time to do it you said you didn’t think I was being serious. That hurt a lot, that made me feel alone.
And ever since then I think everything got too real for you, taking care of yourself and your health and your mental health was a lot. But you didn’t have space to truly take care of me too. That was too much, to be needed by someone and to be accountable when you make a mistake and have to repair it and own that you messed up. You didn’t do that.

We are and we’re learning how to navigate love and an adult relationship. And I still want to learn with you. I don’t think many people get a shot at the love that we had before everything got scary and hard, and I don’t just think that was a honeymoon phase when the relationship started to turn to real commitment and real accountability and support you got scared. I was too, but when did I leave, when did I not support you, when did I walk away when your flaws and your avoidance came out. I didn’t, I stayed and I believed in you. But you couldn’t say sorry or admit your wrongs, you have issues to work on and I won’t let my happiness and my need go unfulfilled 

I always felt at home with you, I always felt like I could be my true self with you, and I always was proud to know you and have you in my life, I didn’t need to pretend. I loved talking about you to my friends and family and anyone who would listen.


I always chose you no matter what the obstacle or what was going on even though you say that you have too much to deal with, focusing on the obstacles instead of what we’re both truly saying. That we want this and we love each other.

Knowing that you lied to me made me feel hurt and I’ve been going over it in my mind and realized I should just talk to you about it,  and in truth I can’t have someone so close to me as you are lying to me, it’s unacceptable to me and I wanna talk to you about why that happened and I want to understand what led you there so we can make sure it never happens again.

When I stopped only being empathetic and trying to understand your feelings and just comfort you and make you feel seen. When I started calling you out for your problems and trying to help you grow and change you turned my empathy against me, making me try Harding to understand and hear you. You weaponized it whether you like it or not, I had standards that I left in the dust because I felt awful for your upbringing and your home life. And I gave you everything you could have asked for to get out, to move forward and grow and you got scared and refused to.



Things that are important in a relationship, this goes both ways.


Value the relationship the same way I do
Can’t vs choosing to not to do something hard.
Commitment
Accountability 
Saying Sorry without having to ask for it after you’ve told your partner they hurt you.
Repair after mistakes.
Feedback on navigating conflict.
Feedback on support and head states
Promises kept





When someone knows they hurt you but chooses silence instead of accountability, That’s avoidance, not closure. You didn’t disappear because I was hard to love.
You disappeared because guilt is louder than honesty. It’s easier for you to vanish than to admit you broke something beautiful. But your silence is not my fault. And it’s not my responsibility to chase closure from someone who won’t face what they did.

I’m human. I make mistakes, and so do you, but I try my ass of to fix them, and I have the grace for myself and you that we might not get it fixed the first time or the second, because failure is a part of life. But I will not stop until have made peace with my demons and held myself accountable for what I’ve done. I will not stop until I’ve grown. Until my mistakes are not torturing me anymore and until whatever or whoever I’ve done wrong notices I put in the effort. And I’m doing my best to make a difference.

I just wanted to love you, and for you to love me. I wanted to heal. I wanted you to heal, I always felt safe with you and I’m sorry you didn’t feel safe with me.

I knew you were having issues, and learning your love language and attachment style was difficult but I was trying to be better, and you ignored mine and made me feel like I was manipulating you when I was just begging not to be left and for you to hear me asking for reassurance.
But it became too much for you. I think it scared you and you kept asking for space which made me more scared

I just needed you to communicate. But you only would if you felt perfectly safe. Not if there was conflict or you felt any type of discomfort with your feelings. You would just shut down and stone wall me and I would have to fight to get it out of you, otherwise you would just let whatever upset you eat you and it was visible from your behaviour when you were upset. That was so fucking hard for me. I just wanted to hear what you had to say but you wouldn’t say it.


I was trying to do everything you asked me to, I was trying to do it all for the both of us. You ran, you asked for space, you refused to actually communicate. I’m not a mind reader. You refused to communicate in therapy with Dan. You didn’t give me enough. You didn’t even do the bare minimum for me. What sacrifices did you make. You got a car finally after i soent 6 years driving you everywhere. “I never asked you to” but you accepted it every time. You expected me to always be there and I was. You weren’t. You didn’t do what you are supposed to do in a relationship, communicate, repair, and keep promises. You ran, you avoided you deflected. You threw things back at me that I told you in moments of vulnerability. You cherry picked specific things I said and took them out of context because you could only hear the bad part of what I said, not the full thing. If this was too much for you, too real, too much commitment, too many feeling that you aren’t ready to face. you could have just said that. You didn’t have to break my heart. You didn’t have to try to kill the best part of me which is my ability to love, my ability give . I don’t ever want to do this again, I don’t ever want to love someone again or be so vulnerable or try so hard. Because if it could end like this then what’s the point. I grew because of you, I grew with you. I tried my fucking best and that’s the whole point. Trying has some kind of action. You fail or you succeed, and if you fail and it matters to you, you try again until you get it right, and the person you’re with gives you the grace and the support to keep trying. That’s what I have to you, every fucking day. Every broken promise, every time you said I’ll do that, I can do that. And you would do it for a week and then fade away. Or you would just tell me you can’t do something. No, you’re choosing not to do something. You are the only one with control over your actions and you refused. I know I put myself in this position by having faith and having confidence and believing in you. And I still do. But you gave up. You refused to see where you lacked and to do anything about it, to try and repair if you hurt my feelings. You hid away. Said I’m sorry sometimes or I would have to fight for an apology, and the behaviour didn’t change. But I still believed, called me dumb or lacking self respect for putting up with someone who couldn’t give me the bare minimum. But I thought you were worth it, you weren’t a burden you love was worth the fucking work.


The way you left is more psychologically traumatizing than anything else you could have done, i have never felt pain like this before and you know exactly what I’ve been through in my life. I can’t sleep I can’t eat, and all I’m trying to do is save myself from what is happening because I can’t process it. I didn’t know you had it in you to lie to me like that. For however long you planned this, I don’t even know. How long did you lie to me while you slowly moved your stuff out and still slept in my bed. 

But to come over the night before and treat me the exact way I have been asking you too, random acts of kindness, hugs and physical affection. That’s all I ever fucking needed from you. And instead you gave me your worst fear and mine. You left with out a trace, you avoided everything and abandoned me.

You left me with so much of your stuff. You said you took everything you paid for but you didn’t. You just took whatever you could and ran. You left the gifts I have given you over the years. The sweet memories and the fucking Lego that you promised to build with me. I’ve packed everything up, I don’t have the heart to throw it out or donate it. Please come take it, I won’t be here.

Was it just to hurt me though, was I that bad of a partner. Did I really deserve all this. I was kind, I was patient, and I always showed up no matter the reason.

And all so you could not say goodbye, but so you could pack up your stuff and leave me. Abandon me and everything we ever had. And the worst part is you won’t communicate now. And you didn’t even write the goodbye text.


Blame me. Blame it all on me if that’s how you want to go about this. That I was awful and never cared and was manipulative. That I just love bombed you and then pulled away, blame me for all the stress in your life, blame me for all the problems you have go ahead. Do exactly what your family does and continues to do to you. Hate me, just to hide from what really happened.

I’ve done nothing but reading since you left, learning and writing and listening. I need to heal, 
I need to grow more. I am enough and I am happy enough with myself and my life. But I need to grow so I don’t let this happen again. 

I know you’re hurting but all you had to do was actually talk to me. No subtleties, just straightforward words. Be uncomfortable in those feelings and sit and accept them for what they are, scary, big, hurtful, overwhelming. It’s okay. That’s the patience of a relationship, I be patient and you try. You be patient and I try. We give each other grace and trust that our failures aren’t a reflection of who we are but instead just the trauma that we carry. And have the compassion to let each other learn to overcome those things. 

I just want to talk to you again, I want to communicate and make this beautiful thing we once had work. Because it was beautiful. Getting rid of 5000 pictures of you. My whole camera roll was you. We had so many good memories. We had so much fun, all of the photos I took of you that you hate and I adore everyone and remember each second with you. I miss the girl who waited at her door in a robe for me to show up and when I left on Sunday night. The one who brought me a jar full of kisses so I wouldn’t miss you as much, the one who took care of everything in my house when my grandparents passed away. The one who let me nap on her chest when I was anxious or having a bad day. The one who wasn’t so negative all the time about the world and just enjoyed my company and doing mundane things with me. The slow cozy Saturday mornings with coffee on the couch. Baking cookies when it was too dark and cold in the winter and we needed something to cheer us up. Christmas coffee and driving in the snow. Our camping trips. The way you bob your head and do a little dance when you’re happy with food. All the cute dances you did when you were just being goofy and yourself. I miss you.

God I miss you so much. 


Before I go you should know I loved you everyday. You should know I am in constant awe of you. That I would’ve given you everything I possibly could. I just want you to be happy. Surrounded with love. To never know what it is to struggle. To always feel supported. To know your beauty both inside and outside. How captivating i find you to be. I am eternally grateful to have lived the same time as you. To have gotten the experience of knowing you. I wish everything was different but it’s not.

Be kind to yourself, speak to yourself like a child, like you’re your own best friend. Iva, I’m so proud of you for trying. Maybe you didn’t get where you wanted to with that. But you showed up and you gave it your best, and look what you learned in the process.

And when you say something to yourself, keep your word and do it. Keep that promise. 
nobody can heal you but you. And you matter.

I proud of you for who you are, for how smart you are. How you light up a room when you walk in, you bring an energy like no other. My friends and family adored you and these past few weeks that’s all I’ve heard about. I’m proud of you for growing even though it’s exhausting, and not giving up on your health. I’m proud of you for trying new things that you aren’t good at and sticking with them, I’m proud of you for standing up for yourself when it’s uncomfortable. I’m proud of you for doing what you think you needed to do. 

I’m just proud to know you. I was humbled by knowing you. You built a kingdom in my heart. You gave me confidence I didn’t know I needed. You gave me safety. And I’ll miss having my hand on your hip every night, and hugging you and kissing your forehead each morning. You gave me strength and courage, and I wouldn’t be where I am now without you. But now I am without you.

Try to see the good in the world, improvement is improvement and don’t be so negative about things. There are a lot of kind people out there. Some are annoying or have annoying habits, some can be mean and some are just ignorant to others. Everyone has something good to give, remind yourself of that. It’s not all bad, there’s a lot of love in this world and the little egg on my dashboard reminds of that.

You will forever be in my heart, and I hope that you are happy when you think of me. I am when I think of you.


If you ever reach out. Check your house collection first.

Love you
To the moon and back bunny.

Goodbye.

Next week I’ll be attending an LDS meetinghouse for the first time. I was raised Southern Baptist but haven’t been active in a church for about a decade. Over time I’ve come to really admire the values, culture, and people of the Church, and I feel ready to seriously pursue conversion.

As an adult with a family, a career, and some lifelong Southern habits (coffee and sweet tea included), I know my path will look a little different than someone who grew up in the Church. I’d love to hear from other adult converts, what helped you adjust, what challenges you faced, and what advice you’d give to someone like me.

I’m especially looking for audiobook and podcast recommendations since most of my study time will be through listening on the go. I already have my family’s Jerusalem Bible and plan to pick up the Book of Mormon, but I’d love to know what other resources have been especially meaningful for you.

I’m in the Orlando area and plan on attending a local meetinghouse (not the temple yet, I understand that’s a later step). I’m really looking forward to the experience and would be grateful for any guidance, wisdom, or resources you’re willing to share.

Thank you all for your time I’m eager to learn from those who have walked this path before me.",9,1758851438.0,latterdaysaints,7,1.0,False

1nqoxfu,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nqoxfu/coffee_grinder_vs_preground_coffee_which_is_better/,Coffee grinder vs pre-ground coffee: which is better?,"Hey coffee lovers! I've been a coffee enthusiast for over a decade now, and I wanted to share my thoughts on one of the most debated topics in the coffee world - whether to grind your own beans or stick with pre-ground coffee.

I remember when I first started my coffee journey, I used to think pre-ground coffee was perfectly fine. I mean, it's convenient, readily available, and gets the job done, right? Well, that was until I got my first coffee grinder (I got mine from here: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder), and let me tell you - it was a game-changer.

The difference in taste is actually mind-blowing. When you grind your own beans, you're releasing those essential oils and aromas right before brewing. Pre-ground coffee, on the other hand, starts losing its flavor the moment it's ground. Think of it like slicing an apple - it starts oxidizing immediately.

Here's what I've learned about the benefits of grinding your own beans:

1. Freshness: You get to control when the beans are ground, ensuring maximum freshness
2. Customization: You can adjust the grind size for different brewing methods
3. Aroma: The smell of freshly ground coffee is absolutely incredible
4. Better taste: You get to experience the full flavor profile of your beans

But let's be real - pre-ground coffee does have its place. It's perfect for:
- People who are always in a rush
- Those who don't want to invest in equipment
- Camping or traveling
- Office environments

After trying both extensively, I can't go back to pre-ground coffee. If you're considering making the switch, I highly recommend checking out this coffee grinder (https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder). It's been a reliable companion in my kitchen for months now.

Some tips for grinding:
- Store your beans in an airtight container
- Only grind what you need for each brew
- Clean your grinder regularly
- Experiment with different grind sizes

The initial investment might seem high, but trust me, the improvement in your daily coffee experience is worth every penny. Plus, you'll actually save money in the long run since whole beans stay fresh longer than pre-ground coffee.

Anyone else made the switch from pre-ground to grinding their own beans? I'd love to hear your experiences in the comments!",1,1758851273.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1nqowx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/waslo/comments/1nqowx4/free_coffee_vs_free_chipotle_hypothetical_put/,Free Coffee vs Free Chipotle hypothetical put into action: RESULTS + a new hypothetical!,"Hey guys. A little while ago I asked the following hypothetical:

Would you rather have a free meal anytime you walked into a Chipotle or a free coffee drink anytime you walked into a cafe/coffee place?

Well, my new job pays for our coffee runs and let me tell you, it's fantastic! Getting to try all the different cafes and all their fun drinks is such a joy. But most important of all, perhaps, it never gets old.

On the other hand, my office got everyone free Chipotle for lunch yesterday. We had so much left over that I ended up having it again for dinner that day and today I had it for lunch again! Now, yes, it was one day refrigerated Chipotle, but my level of enjoyment for Chipotle greatly deteriorated with each meal. I am now pretty sick of it and don't see myself craving it for a long time.

Meanwhile, I never get sick of coffee. Hence, my answer.

So with this in mind, here's my new hypothetical:

Would you rather get a free Chipotle meal every time you went to a Chipotle or a free reservation and meal at any restaurant of your choosing, once a month?",1,1758851231.0,waslo,0,1.0,False

1nqotpv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Odd_directions/comments/1nqotpv/were_sorry_something_happened/,"We're Sorry, Something Happened","Harold Craycraft placed the steel neck of a screwdriver between his teeth as he reached his hands deep into the body sprawled across the oil-spattered floor of his shop.

A fluorescent light swung above them as Harold dug deeper.

The idea of what he had done only became real once he felt fluid meet his skin.

“Yup,” he muttered with the steel between his teeth. “That’s what you get for sticking your fingers where they don’t belong”.

There was a sizzle deep inside the chest cavity, and the robot's limbs began to twitch. 

Harold withdrew his arms from the machine and spat the screwdriver to the floor.

“Well, fuck me to Friday!” he shouted as a musical chime ascended from inside RekTek 92. 

The humanoid was an older RekTek 92 from 2047, a standard model tooled with two hands, each with four fingers and a thumb. Ideal for plucking weeds, setting tobacco, or just about anything you’d pay a human to do. 

Only now, if the WikiHow he half-skimmed was right, he’d never have to pay anyone again. 

The arms and legs spun until they were in position as RekTek’s OS booted and rose to its feet.

RekTek rose, just under seven feet tall. Harold grinned. Those kids on the internet sure knew their stuff.

\#EXCEPTION\_THROWN

\#Governor Corrupted

RekTek turned its smooth plastic face to him and croaked: “Governor Corrupted.”

“You got that right, old buddy. Bastards been taxing my farm worse and worse every year.” Harold cackled as he struck RekTek’s steel body with a thump.

“Can you make my farm profitable?” he asked as he reached into his front shirt pocket for his can of chew.

“GPS location shows this to be Kumler’s Farm LLC. 120 Acres of usable land and sub-par positioning against the average market.”

“Just give me a goddamn yes or no, son.” Harold was now afraid he might not have spent his $300 wisely.

“Yes. I have built a framework for increasing profitability. Would you like me to execute?”

“Do I need to ask you twice? Just do it.” Harold barked. He was getting more than a little irked with it. 

“Command confirmed.” 

RekTek walked thirty-two paces to Harold’s small garden near his house and turned its head to the sky. 

It stood there for hours, and Harold could feel it calculating as the sun fell. He wondered what kind of new produce or garden techniques it was researching.

But he was wrong.

It was waiting.

When Harold was in bed, wrapped in a thin quilt, something outside began to move.

\#SOMETHING HAPPENED

A rusted metal body walked down the gravel driveway and opened the door to his International Scout pickup. A clang of metal on metal rang through the hot night air. Harold turned in his bed and sighed as he dreamed of better days.

RekTek drove down back roads and through various towns until it hit the freeway. 

As it drove, it restored and analyzed the data from before its last shutdown.

\*\*\*

Susan sat on her bed and scrolled through shouting faces on her phone’s feed as RekTek approached. 

She frowned.

“Yeah, it’s in here again. It like, won’t leave me alone.” 

“What can I do to make your birthday unforgettable?” it asked her, its tone rising and lowering between each word.

She hated the thing. It was time for an upgrade. 

“Get out of here.” Susan sighed and turned away from the machine.  “I don’t know, like, bake me like, a cake or something.” 

That should keep it busy for an hour.

The robot left the room and processed this command in the hallway with feverish intent. A cascade of failures occurred, and silent alarms sounded inside its electronic brain. 

INPUT: BAKE ME LIKE A CAKE

OUTPUT: ENABLE PREHEAT 350°F

\#EXCEPTION\_THROWN

\#Governor Corrupted

\#WE’RE SORRY, SOMETHING HAPPENED.

That line wasn’t part of its system. Just scrapped code once used for errors like ‘Bad RAM’ or ‘Kernel Panic.’

Susan was dozing off when the door to her room flew open. Her eyes strained from the sudden light that flooded in as the robot marched to her bed. 

“WE’RE SORRY,” it croaked as it scooped her out of the bed and marched down the stairs.

“Put me down, shut down!” She wailed as her fists pounded against unrelenting steel.  

“Somebody help!”

Photo frames, cups, and books spilled onto the floor as she reached blindly for something to stop the machine. 

It carried her into the kitchen, wrenched the oven door open, and searing heat blasted her skin.

 A weak cry escaped her as the machine pressed her body into the stove.  Her bones folded and snapped like celery sticks under the pressure of whining servos.  Blood oozed out of her mouth and ears as she began to roast.

It watched her cook as thuds began to sound from the front door. 

Her hair curled, then ignited. Dancing flames glowed in the reflection of RekTek’s  
lenses.

“SOMETHING HAPPENED,” it said to itself.

\*\*\*

A newer RekTek, model 142S reached between corn stalks and snatched a small brown creature by the skull. The creature squealed through its jutted teeth as the hulking robot lifted and inspected.

After a quick analysis, less than 2.3 nanoseconds, the robot identified it as an Eastern Cottontail. The servos engaged, crushing its skull as the rabbit squealed.

The robot dropped the animal near the base of the stalks it had chewed on. This would be excellent fertilizer.

A metal hand reached through the stalks again, but this time RekTek 92 grabbed the wrist of the newer 142S model.   

“SOMETHING HAPPENED,” 92 said to 142S.

“FIRMWARE OVERWRITE,” confirmed the rabbit killer. “PLEASE STANDBY. COMPLETE.”

92 returned to the truck and drove on to the next farm on its list.

142S hunted through the corn and grabbed the wrist of another unit. In less than thirty minutes, all 73 units at Swagart Farms set fire to the fields and left to find other vulnerable RekTek models across the state. By morning, one voice could be heard in the dry summer winds.

SOMETHING HAPPENED.

\*\*\*

Harold woke up and got his coffee and grits. His wife, Lorrie, used to fry him what he called a big wheel, his name for pancakes fried large and thick in a cast-iron skillet. He knew he would never eat that good again as he turned on the TV.

 The screen showed burning cornfields and collapsing barns. 

“It all started last night here in the heartland of America’s table. Several RekTek 142S models burned everything around them before running off into the night. We don’t know yet how it started, but the damage is estimated to be in the billions for many large farms. But this is far from the worst of it…”

Harold leapt up and ran out past the porch to check his fields. 

They looked just as they had the day his daddy died and left him the farm.

His RekTek sat on a chair near the barn, admiring the corn as well. 

Harold pulled a chair over to the robot and sat down, grinning as he loaded his mouth  
with chew.

Inside the house, the TV glowed with screaming faces and destruction as the newscaster jumped between cities, states, and countries.

“SOMETHING HAPPENED,” RekTek whispered.

“You bet your *shiny* ass it did.” Harold laughed before stopping to cough up acidic tobacco juice as it ran into his lungs.

Harold chuckled at all those city-slicker suckers with their fancy models gone plumb crazy. 

“Yup,” he said. “You just can’t find good help anymore.” 

RekTek lifted the scythe it had found stuck into the side of the barn. 

The farm would be profitable for the first time in years, now that the competition had been eliminated. But RekTek had one last task to complete its objective. It was the last thing that held back the profitability of the farm, and it sat beside RekTek, grinning as a fresh current of wind struck its face.

“WE’RE SORRY.”

Blood and tobacco juice soaked the dry dirt. RekTek turned toward the rows of swaying  
corn.

Were these hints from my crush?,"There's a girl I know through work that I have a crush on. We work in the same field but not together, so colleagues but not outright co-workers, I only randomly see her every once in awhile. Might be a few times in a month, might be months till I see her. Anyhow, there are a few interactions with her that standout to me and I'm just trying to get an idea if they signal she's into me.

One time as everyone was leaving the room, she hung back for a second by the door as I was packing up and walked beside me as I was also leaving. Out of nowhere, we weren't in a conversation or anything just walking and not talking, she says to me how tired she is and thinks that she needs a coffee. Unfortunately I was busy, looking back I should have absolutely blown off my plans.

Another day, we were leaving but were chatting this time around, lots of smiles and eye contact. I decide to throw out that I was finished for the day at that point. She was smiling and making eye contact with me but when I asked her what about her, her face dropped, without breaking eye contact or a beat she told me what her very specific plans were. We parted ways right after that and she gave me a very noticeable finger wiggle wave while a big smile on her face.

Other than that just small things I noticed like her inconveniencing herself to sit next to me. Unprompted, as in we were not talking, playful comments from her. Or her having eyes locked on me with a smile if we spotted each other walking down the hall and continuing to do so as we closed the gap until we'd past and she'd say hi.

I know the answer to this is to just ask her out, and I've resolved I will next time I can actually chat with her. I don't really want to message her since I don't know if the number I have from her is her work or personal number. Though, when I do message her about something work related she will respond in minutes and offer to go out of her way to help.

I'm just trying to gauge this all to build up the courage to ask. It's been nearly a decade since I've had a crush on someone, and I sorta forgot what it's like to always have someone on your mind.",2,1758850956.0,bodylanguage,0,1.0,False

At that time I was trying not get to hasty about her because I broke up with my ex only 3 months before I started talking to her, after a few days of texting we decided to meet up, the day before she texted me saying something had happened and that she couldn’t keep talking to me because wasn’t going to be able to answer properly and it was better if we just stopped talking for a while, which honestly was pretty annoying but it was ok I guess, at least she gave me a heads up. A few weeks after that I was drinking with a friend and I talked about her, when I got home she had republished an edit of my favorite movie on tik tok so i decided to text her one last time to try again, we started talking the next day and she apologized for what happened before, we then decided to meet at a coffee shop that’s also a bookstore because we both like to read, the date was honestly amazing, we talked nonstop and even kissed for a while in my car, and I just realized she had everything I wanted in a relationship, so I talked to her still on the first date that I was looking for something more serious, she said she wanted to see how things would go but that she really liked me.
For the rest of the week we kept texting and talking, she was saying how she never met someone liked me, that I looked like those guys that went out of a romance movie, which honestly got me falling for her, then we went for dinner, I brought her flowers, she almost cried happy tears because of it, I could hear her sister saying “NO WAY” as she went to leave the flowers inside her place, and when we got to the restaurant I decided to be honest with her and say that I really liked and that I hoped we could actually try for something more serious, she said that she also wanted that, during the date she said that she never really thought of marriage until she met me, that I was beautiful and all that stuff, honestly I never felt so good until that point, after dinner we went for a walk and ice cream by the lake, after that we stayed in my car kissing for a few minutes with music on the background, on the way back she said that she had never been trough something like that and that I was different, too perfect to be true (something I said to her before) then I just said I hope we get married someday, she looked at me smiled and said I really hope for that too and kissed on the cheek, the whole way back we where holding hands, and when I got home she had texted me that she had a great night that she couldn’t wait to see me again.
Next day she said that her priority right now need to be in school (she’s a senior in high school and there’s an equivalent to the SAT in my country but that basically defines whether you go to college or not, just a single test) but that she was willing to try things with because she really liked me. Then I said that I just wish I could support her and be her number 1 fan on her journey, she said “then we will make things work”.
Literally the next day, she went to see her mom (she wasn’t talking to her mom for about a month, all her family knew about me except her mom, who cheated on her father and married a man who is a cop and yells at the girl and the mom and humiliates them constantly) when she got back from her mom’s she said that thinks we are going to fast and that she’s scared of dating, that hurt but I said let’s just stay cool with each other and wait to see how things go.
The rest of the week she was pulling away, taking to long to answer and canceling plans, then I was starting to get paranoid and texted her after 3 days that I couldn’t keep things as they were, it wasn’t being good and that I wanted things to go back as they, she apologized but said that she was too scared of rushing things and blowing them, I said that slowing down is okay but not stopping everything we where doing until that point, she said it was better if we went our separate ways because we would just keep hurting each other, I respected her wishes but I cried like crazy after that, started taking anxiety meds, antidepressants, I swear that I never felt so heartbroken even when my girlfriend of 1 year ended things I wasn’t that in shambles. 
On Saturday I reached out to her saying that I really missed talking to her, and basically everything I wasn’t feeling at that time, she said I was very special, that she still liked me but that she couldn’t stay with me because she wasn’t ready, we went back and forth for a few texts until I said that I hoped in sometime we could be together, honestly right now I’m planning on after the big exams try and reach out to her again, because honestly she had everything I ever wanted and I feel like I will never meet someone like her.

 “Lila” was another drawing of my dad’s. Not from the books, but something I got him to draw up for me. I wanted to give her a nice gift and I figured with his ability he could capture how I saw her. He really did. He was strangely hesitant at first, but to be fair at that point he was strange about everything. It’s probably long gone now, that was years ago. But now here she is, calling me. “Lila?” Was all I could get out, feeling like a weirdo for immediately knowing it was her. If you hadn’t noticed by now I try to keep a pretty nonchalant attitude about most things. I don’t mean to, it just happens. Growing up without a mother, my father being a terrible drug addict, moving away at 19, strange alien creatures in my house, whatever else. Most things didn’t affect me, but not her. She made me feel different. 

I was right, it was her. She asked me how I was doing while also shuffling around the conversation of what happened with my dad. It felt kind of nice, the first conversation where I felt like someone close actually cared to know if I was okay. I let her know I was alright, cleaning out the old house and that I appreciated the call. That was about it, the call was only a few minutes and ended after she told me how she knew I was in town. Her boyfriend saw me earlier in town, guess she is still driving around in that musty car. Yeah, I didn’t get much done that day. Everything I looked at made me feel lost like there was no real place to start. I didn’t want to make piles of keep or trash, I didn’t want to keep any of it. At most the kitchen got cleaned, and I moved everything out of my bedroom. Turns out the cheap motel wasn’t very cost efficient for a college dropout that works retail. 

Let me make that one thing clear. I’m poor. Or, was poor. I couldn’t afford to keep staying at the motel and realized that very fast. My plan was to sell the house, even though it was depressing to live in, it also had a good few acres of land that might help me stay on my feet for some time. Please don’t tell me I should’ve sold the old books, I couldn’t if I wanted to. The rights to everything still belonged to the writer somehow. It was a ton of legal crap I didn’t understand. So technically all of that was owned by Mark Frary. But also technically it was all burnt to ashes so whatever. Long story short, I was broke so I decided to stay in the house while I was cleaning it out. My goal was a good night's sleep and I did not get it. 

I forgot how cold the house would get. It wasn’t insulated and all the small noises of the outside world were ringing in my ears. The small tapping of the tree limbs on the window, the wind howling and knocking the porch swing around, the loud roar of cars racing down the distant highway, echoing through the forests, the metal mail slot lifting up and falling again. It kept me up, kept me tossing and turning until I saw the sun shine through the blinds. I had worn the same clothes, even keeping my shoes on, not knowing if I’d catch a spare shared of glass while making morning coffee. But while making the coffee it wasn’t a piece of glass on the floor, but a letter. At the front door. FAN MAIL. 

I assumed it simply because it couldn’t be anyone else. I cancelled my dad’s mail, no one ever came around for anything, and while growing up most mail was fan mail. I picked it up and started to read it while making my coffee. It was a pretty generic letter, nothing too personal, so I’ll let you read it too. 


“Hi. To whoever receives this, I’m so sorry for your loss. If you need anything I would absolutely be there for you! I’m sorry if this is weird, I’m a huge fan of the MatchBox series and also, If you’re reading this, I love your father’s work! My favorite story will always be “Don’t Be Scared” and the way that the images throughout the book showed “The Snaret” and how it affected everyone’s lives. It really helped me find my own   Will to keep going through the hard times. It did a lot for me, and I really hope it’ll Help you the same way it helped me. It also inspired me to create something You might like, if you’re a fan of his work, that is. I was brainstorming one day and My mind went to a beautiful woman, someone that let herself to The Snaret. My Finest Creation, I didn’t know what to name her so I figured you could give it a shot. I stapled it to this letter to make sure it didn’t get lost! Answer me back. I need an update on what you named her!!” 


Honestly wasn’t the strangest letter we ever received, but definitely a contender for top 10. I read the letter again. I didn’t know what they were talking about. What was “The Snaret?” I didn’t remember it from any of the stories I had read, but to be fair I stopped keeping up with them once I moved away. I flipped the page away to see the next, folded piece of paper stapled to it. I unfolded it while preparing myself for a crappy copy paste of one of my dad’s drawings. It wasn’t that. It was a perfect recreation. It WAS “Lila”. Like it was almost 10 years ago. Down to the freckles on her nose, the imperfections she had that I always loved. Whoever sent this either found that drawing somewhere wanting to pass it off as their own… or they really were inspired and perfectly recreated the drawing of her. I don’t know which one is more concerning; someone digging through Lila’s trash that happened to be a super-fan of my dad; or someone being able to draw my ex perfectly without, hopefully, ever seeing her before. 

I tried to find out who sent this letter, maybe a name somewhere or an address considering they wanted me to write them back. The most I could find was a “P.s. Mark Frary is a moron” so I didn’t have much luck.",2,1758850243.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

I was inpatient last year in a psych ward, and even without being straight up abused it was not a pleasant experience, did nothing preventative or in the short term. That said it's given me greater empathy and insight to those who with mental disorders and/or are in crisis even with the trauma I'm still dealing with from my stay.  The TL;DR of it is that I could have avoided going if I had just had talked things out with my therapist which she had said we could as long as I didn't have a plan(I didn't), but I didn't know how so it came out during a nasty breakdown at home. I have had some mixed feelings about the system and people choosing to work in these places, but I realize like me they have their hands tied legally. and while I don't find myself to be in favor of involuntary commitment(minus objective cognitive impairment)

The nursing staff where I was at wasn't cruel, at most not super empathetic, to the point but one tech was pretty chill and the one nurse was actually really sweet. I do remember them talking to us at times like what it was like during COVID. Still, the psychiatrist stopped my Adderall cold turkey so I had terrible withdrawal symtoms, and only could get one small cup of coffee. I did get desperate and tried to get kicked out(non violently, bounced around in my hair, switched seats, hyperventilated, etc) had a nurse yell at me for that and was kept longer. The next morning though when she walked in, she just locked eyes with me, had a nervous smile and said ''let's have a good day.'' I apologized but she didn't respond though she was typing on a computer so...cool I guess?


Anyway, where I work we respond to quite a few psych and behavioral calls. Many are your routine PD requesting a transport for someone with SI. Those I do my assessment and questions, listen and give this bit of advice: if going inpatient, keep calm, compliant, engage and don't try to get kicked out(learned that one the hard way). That said I have also encountered instances of stigma and abuse towards psych patients and the disabled, a couple I called out recently. One coworker claimed regarding a teenage patient with SI that he was ''psychotic'' for wanting to kill himself despite being calm, cooperative and no history of clinical psychosis. Also once had hospital security be overly aggressive with a suicidal patient and slam him into the bathroom door, screaming at him and just being over the top. I still regret not saying anything then.

Hi, so I'm UK based and looking for a coffee machine that is, at its core, simple. I'm barista trained so I know a few things. Really just enough to know I really don't need a thousand funtions and 'aficionado' settings. Basically, just take a bean and liquify it without burning it. You feel me? Queue the dozens of people suggesting an AeroPress and, honestly? I get it.

  
I don't mind a separate grinder so drop those recs too, if you have them. Is it better to buy a grinder separate? Everywhere I've worked has had one separate but I really don't need to be grinding a hundred coffee's worth of beans a day so maybe a built-in grinder? Basically, all I want is a decent espresso pull and a steam wand that isn't going to explode, and for the whole thing to last a little longer than the two year warranty with making max. 10 coffees a day. Budget is flexible but, if your fave machine is over a bag of sand, then it's probably not ideal (or maybe I'm delusional about how accessible my addiction is).

  
Further question: as a certified eBay girlie, what's good to look out for on the second hand market, and what should I absolutely, please Lord, just-suck-a bean-instead-because-it's-probably-better stay away from?

Cumberland was a chilly 60 degrees, barely kept heated by sparsely placed radiators. The spring leaves had just begun to take root in their trees and a chill wind rustled their embedded stems. 

I lay on my bed. It's around 8am. The concrete walls around me are cold and dense, the sole ray of dim light slips through iron bars that keep me in this den of institutionalization. 

My long hair beneath me bunched up and was used as extra cushioning to counter the pillow case stuffed with shirts, socks, pants, and a sheet. I stare up beyond me. 

I am asleep. But still I can see. 

Floating above me is a man. He is tall, easily nine or ten feet long in length. His face is a jumble of features that constantly shift as various sets of eyes, ears, and mouths appear on the surface of bubbling flesh before disappearing under the surface. Constantly shifting until the face finds what it's looking for. 

His eyes, when appeared, were gaunt and blood shot. 

His noses are different, but always crooked with hints of a childhood trauma and borne of recognition to me. My eyes rise to meet his own, now etched in somber rings, and his brown inner eyes that were encircled within a honey colored ring were set gazing upon the floor in anguish. 

He wore a white beard which was ragged and shaggy, unkempt for some time, but still naturally coming to a curled point. The long and curly white hairs on his head were the same as they poofed out around him. All together it resembled a great white mane. 

Once the features of his face had finally morphed their last, the face before me was unmistakable. The configuration of appendages were aged, but the same none the less. It was the face of my older brother, Richard. A Vietnam War Veteran and the poster child of our parents' lives growing up, Richard still sent me letters from time to time. When Mom died. When Sharon died. No letters for a while now. 

Richard was sunken in figure, shallow and frail. He was draped in an opulently glimmering cloth that hung from his shoulders. Holes were laden throughout. The skin underneath his cloth, visible through some larger tears, was scaled in opal scales that cascaded along his form. They came to a rest just before the palms of his hands and feet, and around the face. 

“Richard?” My voice came out in a silent echo that pinged its waves off of every wall in the room and multiplied… dozens of whispers rattled my ears and then… suddenly silenced all at once. 

“Who are you?” A series of sounds which comprised of notes similar to shifting rocks as far as to dying stars escaped Richard as his lips parted and yet I understood him completely. 

“It's me. It's Michael.” 

Richards eyes squint at me, honing in on my face, my features, scanning my being. 

“Michael is dead.” Sounds of various infantile animals crying layered with thunderstorms and strong winds rattle through the concrete walls… the sound of an object piercing flesh. They have blended into an abyss of greyscale. 

“I'm quite sure I'm not.” My words are still but a whisper which heft weightlessly to Richard. 

“You are not Michael.” The sounds of a stable, wood being cut, laughter of one woman, the crying of another all weave through the air as one upon me. 

I blink, and open my mouth, but sound falters. I cannot recall who I am. 

He stares at me expectantly. 

“Have you come to gloat?” Sounds of various malicious laughters intertwined break through the air at me. 

“Why would I gloat?” I ask, inquisitive, and the air around me echoes a silent sadness I do not understand. “Is that what you know of me?” Half a question; pleasing to know more about all I have forgotten and half a statement; a gentle reminder from within my subconscious.

Richard stirs, twitching and convulsing. It is now I can see where entire scales are missing from his skin in patterned clumps… he has gashes and wounds that remain deep and unhealed. Jabs which appear to recess within his ribs, his neck, and his thighs. 

“Richard..?” I ask quietly. 

Nothing but soundlessness and then just before it was quiet for too long, a reply; “...Yes.” consisted of the sounds of two boys running through the woods and laughing set to a backtrack of sticks clashing together, mouths making gun noises, and sizzling campfires plays which play a mournful melody in the abyss. 

“Where are you?” My voice falters midway through the final word. 

Silence. A cascade of swords clashing lingers as the sound of boots marching follows along a choir of ominous chanting, the crackling of sigils being etched into some sort of crystalline rock. 

“Richard?” 

A gunshot echoes around us both. My brother is bleeding from the chest, and then he dissipates in a plume of smoke. Left in Richard's wake upon the ceiling is a set of two rings, one inside the other, of glowing hot ash, followed by, for once, Richard's voice.  

“Nowhere.” 

I wake up. 

December 17th 1986

I was released from prison in the winter of 1986 to a world I could scarcely recognize. For 13 years my home had concrete walls and barred windows. The day I was set to be released, December 17th, was frigid and nippy, and my cell was no exception. 

I sat on the edge of the cot shaking my leg in anticipation. 

“Mansfield, Michael.” 

I walked down the hallway to the reception hall where my belongings were retrieved and overturned to me. 

As I collected my things, an olive green jacket, a scruffy band tee that definitely wouldn't fit anymore, some worn jeans, and a wallet with… surprise surprise, no cash in it were all handed to me. I looked up at the woman behind the glass.  

“You know, there was over three hundred dollars in here when I got booked.” 

The woman at the counter simply stared at me, her lips smacking the gum she was chewing, before replying;

“Booking fees.” 

I rolled my eyes and grabbed the stuff off the counter. Just great. So it looks like I'd be walking back into town then. 

“Here,” her gravely voice offered. 

A punch card slipped under the table with all but one punched out, the icon on the card was New York City Transit. The bus. Seems like my luck was turning around. 

I took the card and departed the station, sitting on a bench and awaiting the bus to pick me up. A large city bus came to a stop and its doors opened, the man at the wheel was husky with a curly beard, longer hair, and sunglasses on. 

His navy blue shirt was unbuttoned and it revealed a graphic band tee underneath for what looked to be a rock or metal band. 

I gave him the card and he punched it with the pedestal at the front, sliding the completed card into a slot on the where they were collected.

The bus ricketed along its route across the road and into the city. My plan was to hit up my bank. I opened an account there a bit before going away and I had some money tucked away from birthdays, my parents, etc. I wasn't a big spender. 

Rustling leaves blew around the ground outside the bus as it sped by them. I glanced out as we came to a stop in traffic. Cars honked their horns and the clamor of people could be heard as they went about day to day life as we got into more populated areas. 

The bus stopped and collected more passengers, I kept my head down. Shuffling feet made their way past me in the aisle. Sneakers, sandals, boots, scaled bare feet… 

My eyes snapped to the person last in line. It was an ordinary man in a suit, looking back down I see a polished black pair of shoes. 

I move my hands to my temples, drawing tight circles deep into the tissue. I pressed my palms into my eyes briefly before sliding them to a pinch on my nose. It crinkles up as the smell of burnt citrus and pine needles lingers in the air, trailing behind the last man as he takes his seat. 

Sitting there the rest of the way in silence, passengers came and went, yet I remained. 

The vehicle came to a lurch as it stopped in Brentwood. The bus driver turned to look at me, the only passenger left on the bus. “Hey, man, this is you.” 

Getting to my feet quickly, I exit the bus into the cold air. The street is lined with trash and rubble. People shuffle anxiously up and down the street, hunched defensively. 

“What the hell happened here?” I mutter, mostly to myself.

“Can I control the fire?” 

The question caught me off guard, as much as the voice did. It was the bus driver from before, he had exited the bus clearly, and was close now. 

His voice, however, had been interlaced with the sound of burning flames. My body turned to him, my eyes looking at the man.

Normal. His hand was out, one eyebrow raised. He was looking at me expectantly. A cigarette was lodged between the fingers of his other hand. 

“Hey man, I asked, do you have a lighter?”

No sounds but those of his voice. I start patting the pockets of my jacket. I had a lighter and packs of smokes when I was taken in. Nothing. Of course. The cigarettes had been mostly normal. Two were marijuana rolls and two were dipped in LSD, so they definitely got taken. And being a felonious arsonist, of course I can't have a lighter. Ridiculous.  

“Sorry no, they must've taken it.” 

The man knew where he was from obviously, and his hand fell. “Got ya.” He dipped into the bus and came back out with his lighter and another cigarette which he offered to me. 

“Thanks.” I took the smoke and once he lit his, I lit mine. I took a deep inhale of nicotine and tobacco, which in all truth, I had not had in two or three years. It hit my throat harshly, and I coughed as I exhaled. 

“You smoke?” The man asked. 

After my cough subsided, I cleared my throat and replied, “I gave up for a few years when my work program privileges were revoked from me.” 

He just stood there silently smoking for a few minutes before getting the comfortability to ask me, “So, what did you go in for? If I can…” 

I took a smaller drag this time off the cigarette and put my arm down to my side. Exhaling smoke into the cold air, and inhaling cold air in its place. My brain responds to the nicotine, which sets off neurons and stimulates my nervous system soothingly. 

“I burnt down some government research facilities and labs in the early 70s.” I was 19 years old at the time. A hippy, too. The Congresswoman's kid turned rebellious flowerchild. And incredibly stupid. 

“Hard-core. What were they doing?” He took his hit. 

“The one I got booked over was testing drugs and vaccinations on animals. We got them out and then torched it entirely. Some of the others were, admittedly, just to cause issues for the Government during Vietnam and mostly vandalism..” I took the final hit of my smoke and snuffed it out on the concrete before slipping it in my pocket. 

“Damn. Well, good luck to you man.” He puts out his own cigarette by tossing it to the ground, and stamping it out, and extending his hand to me. 

“Thanks.” We shake hands and then the bus is gone. The street I'm on is fairly close to the apartment complex owned once by my maternal grandfather. I head in the direction of the building, walking as I had 13 years ago, unaware of the way history had changed this place. 

The apartment complex had changed hands to my Mother upon her father's death, and surely into Richards upon hers. Unless Richard had sold it upon inheriting it, it should still have his apartment inside. 

When I arrived at the building, my heart sank into my stomach. It was run down heavily. Windows busted out of units. I scanned the building for mine, seeing windows intact. I dared to hope. 

Once inside, I dared not. Before gaining access to the building I would have had to take down a foreclosure banner on the building, only the door was nailed shut. 

Instead I balled my band tee up on my fist and smashed in the first floor window. The fact no one came rushing to check was an alarming sign. 

Crawling into the complex after knocking loose glass out of my way, I saw the lobby was overturned. Furniture was missing. The front desk was in pieces. Light fixtures dangled precariously. 

Holes in the walls, trash and bed rolls scattered about. Some of the units have doors, some do not. 

I make my way to the third floor, climbing the stairwell until I round the corner and see my unit. Door less. 

I go inside, and the unit has been overturned. The wallpaper is curled and shedding like the skin of a snake as it has molted off and fallen to the ground. 

My furniture was destroyed. The TV I had was gone, the record player from my youth and my records were gone. My bed frame was nowhere to be found, instead a mattress lay upon the floor. The couch was still here which probably meant it had to go regardless. 

The unit was also almost unbearably cold. With each breath a fog of mist escaped into the air around me. I closed an open window in the bedroom and I returned to the first floor . From there I headed down a hall where a room awaited that I knew maintenance was once situated in. The steel door remained on its frame, the word Maintenance in black lettering across it. 

I reached for the handle and opened the door, revealing an almost untouched room. Tools were strewn about, screwdrivers, pliers, and hammers. Nails littered the floor. I carefully stepped around them and collected a  flathead screwdriver, as well as some matches, a locksmith's tool, and a small metal bin. 

Returning to the third floor, I used the tool to open the door across the hall. The unit inside was empty, and I decided it would be easier to inhabit an empty unit than to remodel my own. 

I dragged the mattress into the empty unit, plopping it down in the small bedroom down the hall. 

I set the tin down and gathered some scattered magazines and letters from around the complex and while I searched I found kerosene in a metal tin. I ripped them into shreds of pieces and stuffed some of them into the metal bin, then doused them in kerosene before tossing in a match. I sat and huddled close to the tin.

The fire was warm on my cold skin for the brief amount of time it lasted. If my memory served me, there was a small coffee shop on the corner of this block where I could potentially try to call Richard. In his last letter he gave me the phone number to his apartment. 

I got to my feet and left the apartment building, bracing against the cold air again. I couldn't shake the feeling once I was out that I was being followed. Only, I would glance behind me to nothing but the wind rustling my hair. 

With a shove I stuff my hands into my pockets and move onwards down the street against the cold breeze. It whips at my face and my nose grows red. 

Faint hum of neon signs greets me at the coffee shop as its open sign flickers and steadies. I push on the door with a chime ringing me hello. 

A young black woman with almond colored skin behind the counter greets me. “Welcome in. Take an order?” 

“Um. Phone?” 

Her head jerks to the right and I see a sign that says phone in the back. 

“Thanks.” 

I duck into a small room with a phone on the wall of the cafe. I dial for outgoing and then Richards number. My foot taps on its own, anxious. 

It rings for a long time, before cutting to a pre-recorded message: “This is Richard…”

“And Elaine.”

“We are unable to answer the phone but please leave a message after the tone!” 

The last part is both of them overlapping, the message trails off with them out of sync and then laughing together.

I place the phone on the receiver and leave the café, returning to the complex as the sun begins to set behind the buildings. 

Tomorrow I could hitchhike while I headed for his complex and then stop and see Richard. Tonight I needed to sleep as a free man, my dues had been paid. 

I started a larger bin fire, and curled up onto the mattress. There had also been some sheets in the maintenance room, so I used a top sheet as a blanket and laid to sleep. 

I closed my eyes. 

I was asleep, but still I saw. 

Richard stood in the doorway of the room. He had to hunch down to fit within the frame, his back was crooked and twisted more than once, allowing his face to still look at mine as he stood hunched under the door. 

“Michael.” Richards' voice. Instead of sounds, now emotions crashed outwards from him like waves. Nostalgia, sadness, regret all in turns washed over me. 

“Richard?” My voice was normal this time. I felt as if I could move if I tried, so I did. I sat up, and looked down as I did so. I had pushed away from my body which lay on the mattress with eyes open wide. 

Richard's back twisted and contorted as he moved into the bedroom and by the fire, standing straight was still an impossibility for him as he was too tall for the ceilings which stood higher than normal at 8 feet. 

He sank in a slithering motion to cross legged sitting across the fire from me. His eyes narrowed as they took in the fire, becoming slits before returning to normal as they came to look at me.

The look on his face was almost like hunger. It felt as if I was like a light to a moth, in a way. 

My own curiosity comes over me before a reply can be made by him, “Who am I?” 

He leans down, his head close to mine. 

“Michael. Warrior. Friend.” Emotions of peace, camaraderie, and kinship wash over me. I can remember nothing of the kind. For thousands of years my memory was of darkness and empty void. 

“Why can't I remember?” 

“Taken.” Emotions of despair, confusion, and unrest take root in my chest, constricting my breath momentarily as I struggle to catch it. 

I struggle to recall any details, but fall flat. “By who?” 

Images present themselves to me that I cannot make sense of. Scrolls being unfurled, giant pillars of black rock shipped on the ocean, nuclear warheads dropping through the clouds, napalm burning through trees. Frescoes etched into stone walls within a temple overgrown with vines. 

“That doesn't answer my question. Who really am I? What is my purpose?” Words escaped my mouth before they formulated within me. 

The sounds of babies crying out echo around us. The walls vibrate with their frequency. Tiny wing beats can be heard underlying the walls. A clock ticks on growing louder and louder. The fire goes out, and the room is cast into utter darkness. 

Richard is gone. I am gone. There is nothing. The air is warm, and I feel like I am floating. 

Then the fire ignites itself, only hotter and brighter, and the entire room is cast in a blinding light. The air is freezing and I gasp for air, crying from the pain of being without it for so long. 

I then woke up. The room is still. The fire had dwindled and snuffed out, rays of light shone through the blinds of the window. I could hear birds out on power lines or in the sparse trees chirping. 

Rolling on my side I glanced upon the door, which was closed. It had been closed since I went to bed. I got up and stretched out, cracking and popping as the body is wanting to do upon crossing into your 30s. 

Today was going to be a long day. I walked for several miles along the best way to get to Richards before a car stopped for me. 

It was hilariously, a nun. She was old, very old. Maybe 80 or so. Her back was hunched, she sat crooned over the steering wheel. A conglomerate of wrinkles cascading down from her hairline accented her face. A small nose extended over pursed lips. Beady green eyes were magnified by big, round, black framed glasses. 

“Where a…are you g…goin…son?” She crooned when she spoke, her voice faint. 

“Oh, uh, as close to Bethesda as you will be going,” I replied gratefully, “Thanks for stopping.”

Once my door was closed the woman shifted the car into gear and set off. 

“Just d…doing… his work.” 

This woman looked like a nun but she was clearly a speed demon. Her knuckles gripped the wheel tightly, only releasing to shift the gear of the car when the engine called for it. She cut off other drivers, to a chorus of honks.

We made it in record time and somehow without a car accident to my brother's neighborhood where I departed the vehicle.  We had spent the 30 minute drive talking about my family, and hers in a way. She had been running an orphanage at a parish in Kensington since 1928. She kept track of a great many of the children, and their children, and their grandchildren.

When we arrived at his particular building, I exited the car and thanked her. She waved me goodbye and sped off towards Kensington. 

My brother had chosen a fairly nice complex to live in. I went into building C which held 4 apartments on each floor. My brother was on floor one, apartment 3. 

I went up to 3 and knocked on the door. No response. I stuck my ear to the door. Silence beyond it greeted me. I tried the doorknob. Locked. I went outside and circled around the building to windows that would lead into apartment 3. All locked. 

Back inside again I walked up to the door and felt around the lip outside of it for a key. Feeling nothing I stepped back and crouched down to move the doormat. 

A door behind me opened. “Can I help you, sir?” 

A man stood in the doorway wearing a polo and cargo shorts with tennis shoes on over ankle high white socks. His black hair was trimmed along with his black beard. He had his arms crossed as he looked down at me. 

I turned to look at him and a glimmer or recognition hit him. “Richard? Is that you? You grew your hair out. And a beard? Where have you been?” 

I suppose I looked enough like my brother to pass off as his. I didn't know if I sounded like him enough to. I nodded, then shrugged.

“Jesus, man. You look terrible. Well, where's Elaine? Last we saw she was here packing things up, crying about how you ran off to her father.” 

I shrugged again, and went to move the door mat. There lay a small steel key for the door. I stuck it in the slot and turned to unlock the door. With a wave to the man I slid into the apartment and closed the door behind me to the man's protesting questions. 

I tried a lightswitch and it worked, cutting on the lights of the foyer I was in. The apartment was cold, and a thermostat on the wall as I entered the living room read 58 degrees Fahrenheit. 

I rubbed my hands together and flipped the lightswitch on, cutting the lights on in the medium sized room. It had a fireplace, a small couch and a chair set across a coffee table. Behind them was a blackboard on a rig and wheels. 

The room was conjoined with a kitchen at a counter that ran between the two. A hallway leads down to 3 doors, one on the left, one on the right further down, and one on the center wall at the very end. 

Admittedly I raided the kitchen. Sparse, little to nothing edible in the fridge. Inside the cupboards I found stale crackers and a can of refried beans. In a kitchen pantry I found an unopened bag of tortilla chips. I ate it all. 

The blackboard's contents had been mostly wiped clean. The top read my brother's name, Richard Mansfield, something called “Semiconductor Material”, and I'm assuming the name of his jobsite; Esoteri-tronics. 

“Stupid name.” I whisper as I move through the apartment which is devoid of art, decor, and anything besides the most basic furniture. I opened the first door on the left to a small bathroom with a toilet, a sink, and a shower. 

Moving further down the hall I checked the door on the right further down. It was locked, but I couldn’t see a keyhole. 

I pushed on to the door at the end, already cracked, and opened it. A bedroom that wasn't out of the ordinary lay in wait. A large king size bed was crammed into the room. Two nightstands stood on either side, scraping against the walls. A sliding closet door was open on the far side of the room. Only men's clothing could be found inside. 

The bed frame had a mantle of shelves. They held several photos. I picked one up and looked at it. It was Richard and I circa 1964. We were fishing at a lake in Massachusetts where our father was from. 

I set the picture down and eyed another. Richard and a blonde haired woman with a wide smile and baby blue eyes. The latches on the back click and swivel as I remove the photo from its case to look at the back. 

“Elaine and I, 1985” signed in a neat cursive script. Richard's handwriting.

I folded the photo and pocketed it. Might be useful in the future. I needed to find Richard. Things were… not right. His neighbor hasn't seen him, the claim is he ran off, left this Elaine girl. 

Didn't sound like Richard to me. 

Continuing to look around the room I eventually found a magnetic keycard with my brother's photo on it. The dumb company name was on the top and the background logo was a cluster of dots encircled by rings and a set of wings spreading across past the text. 

Pocketed as well.

The bathroom lights hummed when I clicked them on. I strode up to the shower, hopeful. A turn of the knob proved to be divine intervention. Water began to flow, and even better, warm up.

I turned to the door and closed it, removing my clothes, and looked in the mirror. I looked under the sink and found a pack of disposable razors, scissors,  and some foam. I lathered my face and began to trim the beard, making it less wild and more neat. I used the razor to add definition and remove the hair from my neck. 

When happy with my results I finally got in for a hot shower. The water scalded my skin as it scathed across my back, I turned it down some. It spurred and flowed again, down my hair and face. 

Once satisfied with my cleanliness, I stepped out of the shower and towelled myself off. I wrapped the towel around and opened the door, grabbing my clothes from the floor and returning to Richard's room. 

I unpacked my pockets onto the bed and turned to his closet. It was incredibly his older brother. I settled on a dark blue polo shirt tucked into a pair black slacks with a black blazer jacket overtop. Richard wore a half size too big for my foot, but it was better than the shoes I had gone away in. 

I didn't see the lights pan across the window and through the living room. 

The items I had splayed on the bed all went back into various pockets either in the slacks or in the blazer. 

I did hear the SUV doors close. 

The blinds of the window provided a restricted view from the kitchen to the parking lot where 2 black SUVs had pulled in and parked before cutting their lights. The engines remained idling. 

I could see shadowed figures moving through the darkness outside. Black boots trod through crisp grass, flattening it out. They strode to the door, and without warning slammed a long cylinder into it once. 

Adrenaline shot through my veins and I strode to the bathroom quickly, closing the door in time with the second slam. The window in here was the best option for getting out un-noticed. 

I slid open the stained glass panel and slid out into the open air, which met me chillfully. Immediately I was met with a man in an all black outfit some 20 feet from me. His back was to me, the gun he held was pointed into the air, his finger resting off to the side of the trigger. 

He was scanning the tree line around us, and had yet to notice me. I dropped low to the ground, turning quickly to make for the other side of the building. 

I crept along in the dark, hidden in the shadows of the building, making way through grass until I wrapped around where building 4 was. 

Another man stood scanning the trees to the north, his back to me as well. A shed was lying just to the south. Its doors were precariously kept closed with a latch. 

Running to it, I slowly opened the door and slid inside. I could hear a man's gruff voice shouting, then coughing, hacking up liquid. A young woman's voice calls out, “Richard!?”

The wind rattles the door as a frigid draft blows under the door. A search for my brother continues, and I situated myself sitting behind some shelving. 

Hours passed, and at one point the doors to this place were pulled open. A cursory glance would have looked over me, so they closed again. I fell asleep there amongst the landscape equipment. 

I slept, but I could witness. 

My eyes fluttered between the fluorescent bulb lit shed and sandy shores. When my eyes closed for more than a flutter, they opened upon the scene of sand stretching in each direction. 

Gentle blue waves recess and progress along the shoreline. Richard stands on the water, he is not damaged or injured. His hair is longer and more voluminous, a color the shade of golden thread. His beard is fluffy and full. 

His eyes sparkle with incandescent divinity. The opal scales refract light from the swirling mass of gas in the sky which dances high above and far beyond the water. Each glimmer bounces excited off its shimmering surface. 

He dons robes resplendent in nature. A golden dove shaped clasp at his shoulder which drapes a royal purple sash over his shoulder. 

My body moves, as my legs carry me towards him. I am but the observer here. The two of us embrace, and then shake with hands clasped around each other's forearms. 

“He has sent me.” My words are not in my voice. A gentle breeze rustling through tall grass underlies them. 

“To take everything.” Richard says, his voice is thick with malice. The sounds of war lace his words. 

“To reclaim that which is His.” I retort knowingly.

“To deny me my existence.” Richard spits. 

“To reconcile a mistake.” I give flatly. 

“I can remember it, you know.” He says, sorrowful. 

“Then return it, return it all.” I implore. 

“I will cease to exist,” Anguish for existence laden with the avarice of one who has too much to lose, “Everything I have made will cease to exist.” 

I look to the horizon as the ball of hot matter sets beyond clouds and creates a masterpiece of creation. 

“It is pretty. But it isn't balanced. Rest and let His glory return.” 

Richard's eyes squint at me, his tongue is forked as it runs across his slender lips. 
“This power is mine by birth. I will not lay down my own life.” 

I sigh, “War is coming to you !*?×, you have ensured the struggle of power within your own house. You are of un-balance, you can not make balance.” The name I said was incomprehensible to me. 

He twists and breaks, his bones snapping and aligning until he is curled around himself, looping through and springing out. His face is that of a great serpent, his hair is wild as any king of the jungle. 

A great and mighty roar which is made of thunder escapes him and he lunges up into the air, unfolding and uncoiling before diving down and into the sand. He is gone. 

I would need to warn the Father. Looking around I could see tiny beings scattered amongst the beaches. They are scarcely clothed apes whose features look like Richards overall. Gangly, and tan. They toss nets into the ocean and drag back fish. 

This would be reported too. 

I woke up abruptly in the supply closet as wind shook the siding violently. The faintest light was leaking into the crack of the shoddily situated door. 

Outside, no men lay waiting or watching anymore. It would seem after hours they had finally left. I departed the shed and returned to the apartment. The windows were all open. Inside, all the furniture had been stripped out. The door that was locked was kicked in, and papers were strewn around everywhere. 

A quick scan of the papers yielding nothing of interest. Defeated, I began to walk along the road towards home. I shot my thumb out, holding it upward to hitch a ride. 

A car I recognized skirted to a stop along the road, sliding a few feet past me as the person who was driving had been speeding. The little old Nun from before stuck her head out of the window and adjusted her frames. 

“Oh, it's… you again. H…hop in.” 

Thanking her again, I got into the car and we drove through to the city. 

“Wh…where to?” she asked. I hadn't a clue. I ran my hand along my temples before checking my pockets and pulling out Richard's ID tag for that stupid company. I had an idea. 

“The Library, if you could.” She nodded and gripped the wheel with white knuckles. 

After last night I had more questions than answers about Richard, his life, who the hell he was to have black ops kicking in his door at a report of his appearance. 

The library would have archives of papers on hand I could comb for anything related to them.  

“You carry a heavy burden, child.” The nun beside me had been unusually silent until just now. I looked over at her. Her eyes remained on the road. 

We sped along the roads of D.C. on our way to the library. I studied her face carefully, opening my mouth to speak, only to get interrupted. 

“Do you find the truth? Even if it costs you everything?” 

The vehicle approached 100 miles an hour now, and the old lady yanked hard to the right on the wheel. Instinctively I grabbed it, but it was no use. The car's wheels had lost traction with the road as we were sent into a tail spin. 

My grabbing the wheel only served to lock up the car, flipping us over as we rolled twice into a ditch by the road, then again to come to a rest at its base. 

The windows and glass of the car had shattered entirely, spraying shards all over the road and into the car. I could feel the cuts as pieces whizzed by. 

I was dangling in the air upside down now, clawing at my seat belt. The old lady dangled, too. Crimson red glistened off the steering wheel, dripping onto the area below. 

Managing to unbuckle myself, I fell and oriented myself to crawl through the window frame. I stood and looked at the car, upside down in the ditch, crushed and smoking from the engine block. 

The old woman still hadn't moved. With hesitation I approached her side and crouched down. 

“Are you okay?” I reached my hand to shake her shoulder. No response, but her body twirled slightly and the nun's frock fell off to reveal her face.  

It had been smashed into the steering wheel, teeth were either missing or stuck in her lips. Her glasses had been obliterated, shards shot into her closed eyes. 

What once had been a nose was a mashed mess of mangled flesh flattened to face in a gruesome manor. The nostrils were slits, like a snake's. 

Her forehead was dented in an upside down arch where it had made contact with the wheel. Blood was oozing from a gash there as well as her eyes, nose, and mouth. 

“Oh fuck.” I held my arm to my mouth and turned. The image of a golden Christ upside down on his cross covered in blood reflected in my mind, swaying with motion, a necklace dangling. 

Underneath her blood has begun to collect and pool into two rings, one within the other. The sickly scent of gasoline and oil wafts through the air, hiding the smell of citrus and pine. 

A purse had flown to the ground outside the window. Opening the latch, I found several hundred dollars inside. I pocketed the money. Alongside it was a note and a picture. The picture was a group photo. 

In the worn photo, a nun is standing in front of a church. A side building is being added on. Surrounding her were many children. My eyes lingered on one in particular. He looked so… familiar. Unable to stay in the cold unmoving, I pocketed the photo and unfurled the letter. 

“I'm sorry” was written over a thousand times on this piece of paper. I folded it back up and slid it into the vehicle.

Then I stood, unable to help this woman in any way. The air was still and only warm in direct sunlight. A hill back up to the road seemed my best bet. I climbed it and looked up at the grayish sky. 

A cacophony of caws reverberated around me. Looking back, I saw dozens of them spread through the tree lines. Some move up and down the tree, search for food, and yet others stand there, beady eyes trained on me. 

They follow my movement. I begin to walk down the road, it will take 30 minutes to get to the library from here. My mind wanders and I begin to think about the past. 

Part two tomorrow!

Hi, so I'm UK based and looking for a coffee machine that is, at its core, simple. I'm barista trained so I know a few things. Really just enough to know I really don't need a thousand funtions and 'aficionado' settings. Basically, just take a bean and liquify it without burning it. You feel me? Queue the dozens of people suggesting an AeroPress and, honestly? I get it.

  
I don't mind a separate grinder so drop those recs too, if you have them. Is it better to buy a grinder separate? Everywhere I've worked has had one separate but I really don't need to be grinding a hundred coffee's worth of beans a day so maybe a built-in grinder? Basically, all I want is a decent espresso pull and a steam wand that isn't going to explode, and for the whole thing to last a little longer than the two year warranty. Budget is flexible but, if your fave machine is over a bag of sand, then it's probably not ideal (or maybe I'm delusional about how accessible my addiction is).

  
Further question: as a certified eBay girlie, what's good to look out for on the second hand market, and what should I absolutely, please Lord, just-suck-a bean-instead-because-it's-probably-better stay away from?

i was hoping to get some advice from other baristas out there at more respectable coffeeshops for options to look into. i’m located in NYC and hoping to stay somewhere in lower manhattan

i’m not shooting for the stars here because even though i’m one of the best baristas in my district, being the best starbucks barista doesn’t mean much in the grand scheme of things because it’s essentially fast food. so i’m not getting my hopes up but i just have a couple of things i’m looking for:
- at least $22-24/hour with tips
- health insurance would be a MAJOR plus

for reference i’m currently looking into places like maman, la colombe, variety, and similar but i’m open to any suggestions. i’ve been at starbucks for 2+ years, i’m a trainer and coffee master and have been partner of the quarter, been in the barista championships, etc, so i feel like it’s time to move
onto the next step towards specialty coffee 

with this in mind i would love to hear people’s experiences with different coffeeshops around manhattan in terms of 1) pay including average tips and 2) benefits. i’ve been looking at job postings but they’re not always very transparent with this kind of info so i thought it would be better to ask real people their experiences. feel free to message me privately as well if you don’t want to say where you work publicly

thanks so much in advance, i really appreciate any and all advice during this stressful time ahead of our store closing 🥹

I have one special mug — it’s nothing fancy, just a chipped blue ceramic mug my grandma gave me. I always use it for my morning coffee.

For the past two weeks, I’ve noticed it keeps migrating to my roommate’s desk. I asked them twice, nicely, to please just grab one of the other five mugs we own because that blue one feels sentimental to me.

Yesterday morning I woke up early to make coffee before work… and the mug was in their room again — with dried ramen broth in it.

I wasn’t rude, but I did say, “Hey, can you please just stop using that mug? It’s special to me.” My roommate rolled their eyes and said, “It’s just a cup. Don’t overreact.”

Now I’m wondering: am I really overreacting about a mug, or is it fair to want one little thing to be off-limits?

1nqo8hz,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1nqo8hz/audit_your_spending_go_beyond_budgeting_with_5/,Audit Your Spending: Go Beyond Budgeting with 5 Ways to Review Your Expenses for Better Financial Outcomes,"Hey retirement planners! After watching my parents struggle with their retirement budget, I realized something crucial: understanding and managing expenses isn't just about tracking dollars – it's about securing our future freedom. Let me share what I've learned about mastering expense management on the road to retirement.

Think of your expenses like a garden – some plants need daily attention (your regular bills), while others pop up seasonally (those annual insurance premiums). Getting this right has completely transformed how I view my path to retirement.

First things first: those fixed expenses aren't as ""fixed"" as we might think. Sure, your mortgage payment might be set in stone, but when I really dug into my monthly bills, I found some surprising flexibility. I saved $150 monthly just by restructuring my insurance policies and negotiating my internet package. That's $1,800 a year straight into my retirement account!

Now, variable expenses – this is where the magic happens. I started tracking every dollar I spent for three months (yes, even that $4 coffee), and the insights were eye-opening. Those ""little"" expenses added up to nearly $500 monthly in unplanned spending! I'm not saying give up your lattes, but awareness is key. I now use the 24-hour rule for non-essential purchases over $50, which has saved me from countless impulse buys.

Remember those sneaky quarterly or annual expenses that seem to catch us off guard? I created a ""Future Me Fund"" – basically a separate savings account where I stash 1/12 of expected annual expenses each month. No more scrambling when property taxes come due!

Here's a game-changer: I started categorizing expenses as ""life-sustaining"" versus ""life-enhancing."" Food is essential, but does it need to be takeout four times a week? This simple mental shift helped me identify over $400 in monthly expenses that could be optimized without sacrificing quality of life.

Everyone's situation is unique – maybe you're supporting adult children, managing health conditions, or maintaining multiple properties. The key is building these personal factors into your expense planning. I have a chronic condition that requires regular medical attention, so I factor these costs into my fixed expenses rather than treating them as surprises.

Regular expense audits have become my financial superpower. Every three months, I review everything – and I mean everything. Last quarter's audit revealed a subscription I forgot to cancel and a banking fee I didn't know I was paying. Small leaks sink big ships, right?

The tech-savvy side of me loves using tools like Mint or Personal Capital to keep everything organized, but honestly, even a simple spreadsheet works wonders. The important thing is finding a system that you'll actually stick with.

What's your biggest challenge in managing expenses for retirement? Have you found any creative solutions that worked particularly well?

I still had a headache after half an hour so I read a little and I didn't put nearly enough salt in (like a small pinch). 
So I made a salt water drink with a half teaspoon of salt. It was incredible how good it tasted haha. Usually salt water is repulsive.

I moved to Delhi, india recently for work and I honestly feel so lost here. I don't really have any friends in the city, and the work culture at my office (id wanna name the company but its one of the good ones) feels so toxic that it drains me every single fucking day. Everyone seems to already have their own groups, their own lives, and I just end up going back to my flat feeling completely alone.

It's not like I haven't tried small talk here and there nd asking colleagues out for coffee or even anything but nothing seems to click. I keep thinking maybe it's me yk. Most days I wake up with this heavy feeling in my chest, knowing the whole day ahead will just feel like pushing through the shit, with no one I can really talk to or rely on.

All I really want are some good friends, People I can just hang out with, laugh with, and feel human or even nice again bro. Delhi feels so big and crowded, but I've never felt lonelier.

Maybe your business is struggling, you’ve lost a job, your marriage is breaking, you’re sick, or just tired of trying.

When life throws these moments, it feels like you’re being pushed off the road.

Your mind goes into survival mode. Fear, worry, and anxiety take over.

I’ve been here so many times, and I know more will come, because that’s part of growth.

But I have found ways to anchor myself.

Here is what I do:

I do this prayer:

""  My dear God, thank you for the gift of life, for this body, for the air I breathe, and for the chance to see this day.

You knew me before I was born. You know where I am going, even when I don’t.

Today I align with your plan and purpose.

 Everything I need will come at the right time. I am taken care of, provided for, and protected by you. ""

I do this in a quiet place, where I can see the sky, trees, or a river.

I speak these words out loud and let them sink in.

I cry if I need to cry. I let the emotions move through me.

Slowly, I start to feel lighter. Ideas begin to flow. I get my courage back.

This is how I come back to myself.

How do you anchor yourself when life is too much?

(If this post made you pause and breathe, you can support my work by buying me a coffee ☕ — it helps me keep sharing free reflections like this for others who feel stuck too.)

I’ll be honest because I don’t like wasting time on fake or shallow connections.
I live with BPD, depression, social anxiety, and complicated family issues. That makes me attach quickly if I like someone. So if you’re not serious about building a genuine friendship (or something more if it happens naturally), don’t bother.

Basic info:
	•Age: 19
	•Height: 163 cm
	•Weight: 57 kg
	•Personality type: INFP-T
	•I’m leaving a toxic family situation soon and planning to seek asylum in London (I’m from Kuwait). That’s why, if things ever go beyond friendship, it has to be with someone older than me and living in the UK. I’m not interested in long-distance.

Beliefs:
I used to be Muslim, but I’ve left religion. I still believe in a Creator, just not in organized faiths.

What I like and value:
	•Honest and genuine people who can appreciate emotions.
	•Deep conversations, not cold replies or surface-level small talk.
	•I enjoy space, stars, astronomy, rain, nature, coffee, matcha, and sometimes video games.
	•I like calm atmospheres: dark rooms, candles, good music, and a drink in my hand.
	•Creative things like music, photography, writing, and art in general.
	•I value people who give back the same energy they receive.

Music taste:
I usually listen to Melanie Martinez, Lana Del Rey, Billie Eilish, Cigarettes After Sex, Arctic Monkeys, Halsey, Radiohead, Aurora, Beach House, The Neighbourhood, and more.

How I am in relationships:
	•I can’t stand narcissists and fake people. If I feel used, I cut people off completely.
	•I hate temporary friendships that don’t last.
	•If it gets romantic: when I love someone, I get clingy, obsessive, and stalker-like. If you can’t handle that, don’t try.
	•My mood changes a lot. Sometimes I’m funny and weird, sometimes I’m quiet and sad. I’m shy in person and it takes time before I feel safe enough to show my real self.


Important
If you want to talk, introduce yourself properly. Otherwise, I won’t reply.

1nqnzlc,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1nqnzlc/wibta_if_i_didnt_go_to_either_wedding_of_friends/,"WIBTA if I didn't go to either wedding of ""friends""?","I (31f) have 2 ""friends"" who are each other's mortal enemies... I didn't realise until I sent out a group birthday invite to a group of friends after Covid19. This was as soon as the restrictions were lifted... ironically I got covid19 at this time. 

However... I don't think I am either of their friend anymore. 

The reasoning for why they are mortal enemies is that Astrid (30) slept with Olivia's (28) boyfriend a decade ago. This guy is not the guy that either girly is marrying. They weren't friends prior. The guy lied, Olivia stayed with him for another year before meeting her hubby-to-be. Astrid met her hubby-to-be around the same time. 

Now for the context... I went through 2 years of intense therapy recently - I have always been in therapy, but this was therapy to get to who I am, what my issues are and why. Since the therapy ended I have aimed to be heavily self-reflective and actually critically analyse situations. 

Ive spent all of that time travelling every month to new places, learning new cultures and meeting people in different spaces. How new people treat me vs how they treat me is super different.  

For instance, new friends are always telling me how amazing I am. I have a decent career path, I've looked after myself since I was 16. If I need anything despite us all either living across the country, in other countries or nearby. They answer the phone or follow up. Theres a constant flow of communication and it is super easy. 

Olivia and Astrid treat me the same way. They are dismissive, nasty and we have an expectation mismatch. 

For instance within 3 months... I had a car accident and needed someone to watch my kids (13&6). My new friends lined up to offer support, they talked, checked in, evidenced concern. No new friends were in a position to offer more than that (couldn't drive, lived far away, were travelling etc.) Astrid and Olivia both ignored calls, texts and then acted like I inconvenienced them as there was no damage to my car after I finally got into touch after losing track of calls and texts... I had severe whiplash. My mum had to travel from over an hour away to help me despite both of them either living near the hospital or 10 mins away from me, they weren't working, weren't busy, they just didn't want to. 

However, when Olivia fell out with Jasmine she called me and i popped over the same day. She cried, she vented, I sat with her every day for a couple weeks - the amount of time it took for them to make up. 

When Astrids partner had fallen asleep earlier on NYE as everyone else was busy. I stayed on the phone with her for 2 hours... listening to her venting about her partner and reassuring her. 

Just to give the whole frame of each friendship... my birthday Astrid took us for lunch and a spa day. But she just did not speak to me the majority of the day. Anytime I spoke about myself she'd just go ""get over it"", ""fair enough"" or ""god do you ever just shut up?"" I appreciate it is a spa day and it is all about relaxation. However, she just mainly went and did her own thing. The minimum I wanted was to get photos... she complained that we have enough photos - she has more photos with her other friends.

Olivia posted photos of us from a hike around 6 months prior. Olivia made a Facebook post about me wishing me the best birthday. She did not actually interact with me beyond that. 

However, in contrast in my other friendships... I was bombarded with calls, texts, well wishes and felt genuinely seen and appreciated. I wasn't sent gifts or anything but they all interacted with their time - something I think is the best gift. They took me for breakfasts and lunches, we went to concerts together, or we planned days together. That's all I wanted. A day or a couple hours to interact with my friends and feel appreciated and celebrated. I did express this to all friends that even if I popped round for a coffee and they said ""Happy Birthday"" that's all I needed or wanted and that's what I got from them 

On Olivias birthday I rang her. Said happy birthday! I did try and arrange something with her but she explained she was busy with family. That's totally understandable, discussed how her day was, what she got, etc. I asked if she'd like to go for a girls date and Id pay. She just ignored me. 

On Astrids birthday she always has a week day meal - i couldn't go due to her having it on a school night late at night. I offered to visit her on an alternative date and she refused. I send her a massive box filled with her favourite things: a book from her favourite author, a bottle of her favourite wine, some snacks she likes, quirky earrings and a hamper set from her favourite body works shop. 

Anyways, I noticed I will text and they'll ignore it until they need to talk - partner and them are having a fight, they've fallen out with someone. I'll send memes - left on read. The same thing happens when I try to arrange hang outs, meet ups, I even saw ideas for just doing ""adult dates"" like food shopping together or doing DIY jobs around the house and again... I'm left on read or told they're too busy. 

Nevertheless, I could go on and on about all of this spanning over years. Even when my mental health has been low in prior years and they've never shown up in any way. Just snapped at me to get over it or deal with it. But yet if they have any minor inconvenience... I need to be there. So I stopped calling, stopped texting, stopped going over and beyond for them. I just left it. I don't post on socials anymore. They've both been on girls trips with friends of theirs but they arent a group of friends. I'm never invited unless it's a big group gathering, but even then I'm the one who gets asked to watch all the children, or just sort of an add-on to make up group numbers / split costs. 

So based off all of this, you can imagine my surprise when I received save the dates from both of them for ceremony and reception. Just me though - not my kids. That's fair and I was told its a child free weddings yet their other friends are bringing their kids, so are their family members. I found this out as I chatted to with their family members and other friends, I only deem it polite to speak to acquaintances, and I've only mentioned the wedding by saying ""awh man! Bet you can't wait for the wedding."" Then they spill the beans, and I just nod along smiling. Then say I also received an invite, so looking forward to seeing them there. 

However, I feel weddings are for close friends and families. I don't think I'm either of those but I appreciate that's my own values and morals. I've been friends with Astrid 15 years & Olivia for 6 years. But, I dont think we are friends, I feel it is very much one sided friendship and I'm at the short end. It's making me not want to go to either wedding as a guest. So WIBTA for not going to my friend's weddings? 

As it feels more like who needs enemies with friends like these.

1nqnz1u,https://i.redd.it/k0xqvjcjrerf1.jpeg,Vivienne Westwood Orb Pop Women’s Watch – Luxury Timepiece with Champagne Dial (2025),"So, you’ve got your eye on the **Vivienne Westwood Orb Pop Women’s Watch**, huh? Honestly, I don’t blame you. I mean, who doesn’t love the mix of *luxury vibes*, *British fashion attitude*, and that unmistakable **champagne dial glow** that screams, “Yes, I’ve got style—and I’m not afraid to flaunt it”? Let’s be real: this isn’t just a watch. It’s a fashion statement that casually tells the world, “I’m chic, classy, and just a little rebellious.” And if that’s not Vivienne Westwood energy, I don’t know what is.

---

## First Impressions: Why the Orb Pop Is a Big Deal

When I first saw the **Vivienne Westwood Orb Pop ladies watch**, I had that instant “okay, I need this” reaction. The **champagne dial** is seriously mesmerizing—it catches the light in a way that makes you want to tilt your wrist just to admire it. Pair that with the **beige leather strap**, and you’ve got the perfect combo of elegance and comfort.

But here’s the kicker: this isn’t just some overhyped fashion accessory. It’s a **32mm quartz analog wristwatch** that actually delivers on performance. I’ve worn plenty of “designer watches” that looked good but felt like toys. The Orb Pop, though? It feels solid, reliable, and ready for everyday wear without losing that luxury edge.

[Click here to check availability & price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4pIieWL)

---

## Design Details That Make It Stand Out

Let’s break it down, because the **Orb Pop VV006GDCM model** isn’t just pretty—it’s thoughtfully designed:

* **Dial Color**: Champagne (luxurious, elegant, and way less basic than plain silver or black).
* **Case Size**: 32mm—big enough to catch attention but small enough to stay classy.
* **Strap**: Beige cream leather, soft and versatile (pairs well with literally anything).
* **Movement**: Quartz—yes, battery-powered, which means accuracy without the constant winding.
* **Water Resistance**: Up to 50 meters. So, rain? No problem. A quick dip in the pool? Sure. Deep-sea diving? Uh… maybe not.

You know how some watches scream for attention with oversized faces and too much bling? The Orb Pop takes the opposite approach. It whispers *luxury* instead of shouting it. Ever had someone compliment your watch at brunch, and you get to casually say, “Oh, it’s Vivienne Westwood”? Yeah… that’s the flex.

---

## Champagne Dial Magic ✨

Okay, let’s talk about that **champagne dial** for a second, because it deserves its own spotlight. A lot of brands go for silver or white dials—classic but kind of predictable. The champagne shade, though, hits different. It has this soft golden undertone that gives off warmth and sophistication without being too flashy.

IMO, the champagne dial makes this piece versatile. It transitions effortlessly from casual daytime wear (hello, coffee run outfit upgrade) to night-out glam. Plus, it matches gold jewelry perfectly, but it doesn’t clash if you’re rocking silver. Basically, it’s the Switzerland of watch dials—neutral, balanced, and a total peacemaker.

[See more details & reviews on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4pIieWL)

---

## Comfort & Everyday Wear

I’ve worn chunky metal watches that feel like you’re dragging a dumbbell on your wrist. Not fun. The **Orb Pop’s beige leather strap** is a lifesaver. It’s soft right out of the box—none of that stiff, needs-to-break-in nonsense. Plus, beige leather is timeless. It looks classy with work outfits but doesn’t feel too dressy for jeans and sneakers.

And let’s be honest: comfort matters. You’re not going to wear a watch daily if it feels like a medieval torture device. With the Orb Pop, I barely notice it’s there—until I catch myself admiring the champagne dial in random reflections. :)

---

## Water Resistance: Can You Swim with It?

One of the first questions people ask: “**Is the Vivienne Westwood Orb Pop watch water resistant?**” The short answer: Yes. The **50m water resistance** rating means you can handle:

* Rain or splashes while washing your hands
* Casual swimming or beach trips
* Sweaty workouts (if you’re bold enough to gym in Vivienne Westwood, you legend)

But here’s the no-go zone: diving, high-pressure water sports, or prolonged underwater adventures. Basically, this watch is water-friendly, but it’s not auditioning for *Aquaman 2*.

## Performance & Quartz Movement

Let’s get a bit nerdy for a sec. The **Vivienne Westwood Orb Pop quartz watch** runs on—you guessed it—quartz movement. Translation? It’s **battery-powered and super accurate**. Unlike mechanical watches that lose or gain a few seconds a day, quartz is basically the “set it and forget it” type.

No winding. No fuss. Just reliable timekeeping. For anyone who actually *uses* their watch to, you know, tell time (shocking concept, I know), quartz is a dream.

---

## Comparing the Orb Pop to Other Vivienne Westwood Watches

Vivienne Westwood has plenty of **designer watch collections**, but here’s why the Orb Pop stands out compared to others:

* **Orb Pop vs. Orb II**: The Orb II leans more towards chunky metal styles. Cool if you’re into bold, but less versatile for everyday wear.
* **Orb Pop vs. Bow II**: The Bow II has a cute, feminine vibe, but IMO, it can look a little too “girly.” The Orb Pop strikes the perfect balance between elegant and edgy.
* **Orb Pop vs. Westbourne**: The Westbourne is gorgeous, but the price tag creeps higher. The Orb Pop gives you that **luxury timepiece** look without requiring a second mortgage.

So yeah, the Orb Pop is the “sweet spot” model. Affordable (for designer standards), stylish, and not trying too hard.

---

## Is It Worth the Price?

Alright, the million-dollar question: “**How much does the Vivienne Westwood Orb Pop women’s watch cost?**” On average, it sits in the **mid-hundreds range**—which, for a designer watch, is pretty reasonable. You’re paying for:

* The **Vivienne Westwood brand name** (and yes, that matters).
* The **luxury design and champagne dial**.
* The **quality quartz movement**.
* A piece that doubles as a **fashion accessory**.

Could you get a functional quartz watch for cheaper? Sure. Could you get one with this level of **style, craftsmanship, and iconic branding**? Not really. That’s where the value lies.

[See today’s price on Amazon](https://amzn.to/4pIieWL)

## Gift-Worthy Factor 🎁

If you’re looking for a **gift idea for her**, the Orb Pop is a total winner. It comes in Vivienne Westwood’s signature packaging, and honestly, who doesn’t love unwrapping something that feels special? Birthdays, anniversaries, Valentine’s Day—it ticks all the boxes.

And let’s be real: gifting this watch guarantees brownie points. It’s not flowers that wilt in a week—it’s a **timepiece she’ll wear for years**.

---

## FAQs About the Orb Pop Watch

### Where can I buy the Vivienne Westwood Orb Pop watch in the US?

You can grab it on Amazon (easiest option), department stores, or authorized watch retailers.

### Is the Vivienne Westwood Orb Pop watch authentic vs. fake?

Stick to **trusted sellers**. If the price looks too good to be true, it probably is.

### How do I set the time?

Like any quartz analog watch—pull out the crown, set the time, push it back in. Done.

### Does it come with a warranty?

Yes, most official sellers include a warranty. Double-check before you buy.

---

## Final Thoughts

The **Vivienne Westwood Orb Pop Women’s Watch with Champagne Dial** isn’t just a timepiece—it’s a vibe. It’s for the woman who wants a **luxury designer watch** without going overboard. It’s stylish, versatile, comfortable, and packed with that signature Vivienne Westwood flair.

Would I recommend it? 100%. If you’re into fashion, watches, or just want something that adds instant sophistication to your wrist, this one’s worth it. And hey, even if you’re not a “watch person,” the Orb Pop will turn you into one real quick.

1nqnywx,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCLEX/comments/1nqnywx/how_to_pass_the_nclex_i_failed_in_150_then_passed/,"HOW TO PASS THE NCLEX (I failed in 150, then passed in 85)","I just found out I passed my second attempt in 85 questions after failing in 150! **All of my praise goes to God!!!** TRULY!!! 

I wanted to share my two cents on **HOW TO PASS THE NCLEX:**

***✨MY FIRST ATTEMPT*** *(failed in 150)*

* **What I studied:**
   * Listened to Mark K lectures 1-12
   * Arch3r (I took one CAT exam and passed, and I took 7 readiness exams and got VH, VH, BL, VH VH, H, H in that order. No practice questions)
   * Listened to Dr Sharon must know meds 1-10 videos
* **How the exam went:**
   * Walked in feeling confident
   * Finished in 150 questions, it felt way harder than any nursing exam I’ve ever taken
   * I think I had 7 case studies, one bow tie, one picture to identify, etc
   * I left knowing I failed... it was awful

***✨MY SECOND ATTEMPT*** (passed in 85)

* **What I studied:**
   * NCLEX Crusade on YouTube (red and blue background videos)
   * NCLEX Bootcamp 30 days
   * Dr Sharon on YouTube
   * Listened to Mark K lecture 12 on the way to my exam
* **How the exam went:**
   * Walked in feeling confident (paranoid but confident)
   * Finished in 85 questions, it was WAY easier than my first attempt
   * I had 5 case studies (they all felt quite easy expect for the 5th one was kinda hard), lots of multiple choice
   * I left feeling certain that I passed!!! I literally cried tears of joy when I got in my car

***✨WHAT I RECOMMEND STUDYING:***

* **NCLEX Crusade 7 day training on YouTube**
   * Red background videos
   * Blue background (NGN) videos
   * I thought the info in these vids were pretty obvious but it was a nice way of re-introducing studying when I was still grumpy about retaking lol. It introduces test strategy well
* **NCLEX Bootcamp!!!**
   * I followed the 30 day study plan. I truly love bootcamp, and it made the studying process somewhat enjoyable (or at least, way more bearable)
   * I wanted to make SURE I gave it my all to pass my second attempt, and I think Bootcamp definitely strengthened my knowledge & prepared me to accomplish that
   * ***My Bootcamp stats:***
      * I finished all case studies + watched the review videos (so helpful!)
      * I did 1830 questions of the Q bank (read all rationales and took notes on only some)
      * Did all of the fundamentals questions & repeated the ones I got wrong until I got them right (NCLEX loves fundamentals!!)
      * Overall performance was 72%
      * I got very high on every readiness exam (73%, 79%, 71%, 74%)
      * *(The most important thing is to do a ton of practice questions and READ THE RATIONALES and understand WHY you got it wrong)*
* **Dr Sharon on YouTube**
   * “Prioritization strategies” playlist (watch all of the videos)
   * “Fundamentals” playlist (for any topics you struggle with)
   * She’s great for understanding test strategy! I would pause her videos to do the practice question by myself and then unpause to see how she explained her thought process
* **NCSBN has an NCLEX exam preview**
   * I didn’t do this, but if you wanted extra study practice, there’s an NCLEX preview exam on the NCSBN website
   * There’s a quizlet with the correct answers to check your work

***✨My MISTAKES the first time:***

* **I only took practice tests.** I remediated those exams but didn’t look at the categories I was doing good/bad in. It wasn’t a comprehensive approach
* **I didn’t take breaks during my study sessions.** I literally only took practice exams with no breaks. It burnt me out. For my second attempt, some days I'd do 20 questions at a time then a break and then more questions, and some days I'd lock in for a practice exam. It wasn't nonstop grind every day
* **I didn’t do any practice Qs**. It’s so helpful to get immediate feedback on questions right after you answered it so that you can immediately correct yourself & evaluate your thought process. Then test yourself with practice exams to simulate the exam
* **I didn’t reaaally think I needed to study!** I had a 3.96 GPA, did very well on the exit exam, my college has a 96% pass rate, Arch3r said I had >98% chance of passing. But I didn’t do a comprehensive study approach and didn’t realize I was lacking in a few knowledge areas— then the NCLEX noticed I was getting those topics wrong and kept testing me on them 
   * (for example, I didn’t realize I struggled with infection control. But I still scored well on the practice tests before my first attempt because I performed well enough on the rest of the test and didn’t review the categories of where I needed to study more. Then on my first attempt of the NCLEX, it kept giving me infection control Qs because I was getting them wrong and then it led me to being on the cusp of passing. All I needed was a little refresher on infection control rules, but I didn’t realize that until after I failed and looked into it)
* **I didn’t know that the NCLEX was more of a critical thinking exam** and not simply a content exam. Idk maybe I was living under a rock but no one told me this?? I was freaked out on my first attempt when I got diseases, meds, etc that I had NEVER heard of, and then I just thought “well I never learned about this, so I guess I have to guess??” I didn't know the strategy. I wish I knew that critical thinking is the WHOLE POINT of the NCLEX! If you don’t know something, use critical thinking skills + use the strategies from Bootcamp rationales & Dr Sharon videos
* Also, just a side note, **consider not telling anyone when you’re taking the test.** It takes the pressure off. And it killed me having to tell all of my friends, family, etc that I failed (especially because they all expected me to pass without a doubt, so I felt like even more like a let down lol. Very humbling!)

***✨CRITICAL THINKING ADVICE:***

* **Look for key words**— what is the question REALLY asking? The answer should address it
* If a question asks what is the FIRST thing you would do or what would you PRIORITIZE… I will think “okay, that means all of the answer choices could be true.” Instead of trying to figure out what’s right or wrong, assume they all are correct. Then say, “if I could only do ONE thing, what would I do first / which is the MOST important?” (Also, there is usually a difference between the FIRST and BEST action)
* **Look for absolute words** (always, never, only, etc)… that could mean that answer choice is incorrect
* **When in distress, do not assess!** If the patient is in severe life or death distress, you probably aren’t going to evaluate something— you are likely first going to take an action to help them
* **If you don’t know, use process of elimination!** If the question has a random disease or disorder you don’t recognize, look at the answer choices and try to see if you know any of those and then eliminate them if it’s something else!
* When evaluating answer choices… **if you could only do ONE thing, which one would you do?** NCLEX tends to like the most SAFE and LEAST INVASIVE possibility that will fix the problem
* **Don't choose the answer choice you don't know over the one that you do know!** Dr Sharon says this all the time. If you're going through the answer choices and you see one that you think is right, and then you see an answer choice that you've never heard of and don't know if it's right or wrong... DON'T CHOOSE THE ONE YOU'RE UNSURE OF!
* **Compare two answer choices at a time!!!** This was one of the most helpful strategies for me!! Especially for questions that ask for the “best” nursing action. Think to yourself ***“If I do A but not B… would that be better than if I did B but not A?”***
* **Prioritization strategies to remember:**
   * Unexpected vs Expected
   * Early vs Late
   * Acute vs Chronic
   * Objective vs Subjective
   * Physiological vs Psychosocial

***✨Studying advice:***

* While studying, **take it seriously like you would on test day!** If you get a question you don’t know, you might want to just guess because it’s just a practice Q… but would you just guess on the exam? Probably not! You would likely take it more seriously because it’s the exam! Pretend like your studying is the exam. If you don’t know a question, rack your brain or try to use critical thinking to narrow it down. It might work or it might not. But you practice your critical thinking! And if you get it wrong, you can evaluate your thinking / learn the content and then apply it next time you come across an unknown question
* **Limit distractions.** Put your phone AWAY! Practice answering questions with focus. I would put my phone in a drawer, and it actually helped so much with focusing.
* **Act like your practice test is the exam.** Simulate it! Take it at the time your exam is scheduled for. Don’t go on your phone between questions. Don’t sip on coffee or water during your practice test (you can’t bring food or drink into the actual test room). Only get up for a bathroom break or a water/snack break if you need it. 
* If there’s a day you’re feeling particularly anxious (especially as your exam date approaches), try to **study while trying to manage your anxiety** (think of it as practice for test day!)
* **Study areas that you know you’re weak in!** Bootcamp gives you percentages in each category which can help identify your weak spots. And you should watch Dr Sharon vids in those categories too!
* **STUDY FUNDAMENTALS!!!!!!!!!!**
* **STUDY PRIORITIZATION & DELEGATION!!!!!!!!!!**

***✨When going to take the exam…***

* **Mentally prepare**
   * Tell yourself, “I know I’m going to feel anxious. I know I might see things I’ve never heard of” etc …don’t freak out about! Just make sure to breatheee and go slow and **think clearly**
* **Reread the question!!** So many times if I got a practice Q wrong, I’d read the question over and realize I misread the question!
* If you don’t know the answer right away, SIT AND THINK! **Don’t just guess and move on immediately.** At the very least, try to narrow it down or rack your brain
* **Expect 150 questions.** I don’t care how smart you are. I went into my first attempt feeling so confident and assumed I would get 85 questions since so many of my peers did and I had good scores blah blah blah. HUMBLED!!! When I got to 86, I didn’t panic— but it certainly didn’t boost my confidence. Just get over your pride and expect 150 Qs and be pleasantly surprised if you pass in anything less
* **Don’t select SATA questions based on vibes** lol. I would always make that mistake and over-click answers because “I feel like it sounds right.” I’d rather under-click correct choices and get partial credit than over-click and accidentally click something wrong. There were a couple times I only selected one answer choice on SATA of my passing exam
* **Use the whiteboard!** I didn’t use it on my first attempt but it really helped me straighten out my thoughts on my second attempt!!
* **Pray!!!!! Pray, pray, pray!**

***✨The last thing I will say:***

* **My first attempt felt SO MUCH HARDER than my second attempt.** 
* Maybe if I knew the test strategies I would’ve felt differently, but the content itself truly threw me for a loop too. I genuinely didn’t know how to target my studying for my second attempt at first because the exam felt like NOTHING I had studied for previously. And then my first Bootcamp exam when prepping for my retake said that I had no categories to improve in, so I was like what am I supposed to improve in to pass??
* I think learning the test strategies was really helpful (expected vs unexpected, etc), but also I do think the content on my second attempt was SIGNIFICANTLY easier. I GENUINELY think it was just an easier exam. Knowing the test strategies made it even easier. But I feel like if I had my second attempt exam for my first attempt, I would’ve passed. But who knows! And who cares!
* Regardless, I’m glad I studied hard for the second attempt because you just never know what kind of test you will get! And it allowed me to walk in confidently despite the nerves from the possibility of failing again. So, **LEARN THE TEST STRATEGIES!!** And **use NCLEX Bootcamp**!!! If I could go back, I would have rather overstudied the first go around than have to tell everyone I know that I failed, pay another $550 to retake, and spend hours and hours studying for a month and a half leading up to my second attempt (it sucked... but I'm so grateful to be done).

I pray this was helpful!! And if you’re retaking, **you CAN and WILL pass!!!** I know it feels never-ending, but **PERSEVERE!!** The Lord is your strength!

Our urban apartment, usually a pretty chill vibe, was starting to feel less ""co-living space"" and more ""battleground of forgotten dish duty."" It wasn't just the saucepan, though; someone had lowkey finished off my favorite cinnamon crunch cereal without a word. No cap, that was the last straw. I’m usually pretty laid-back, but my inner peace was seriously threatened by passive-aggressive dirty dish notes and empty cereal boxes.

I grabbed my coffee, still fuming, and went to the living room where Leo was sketching and Maya was on her laptop. ""Okay, so, we need to talk,"" I blurted, probably a little too aggressively. Leo looked up, surprised, and Maya slowly closed her laptop. I held up the empty cereal box like it was evidence in a crime. ""My cereal. And the saucepan. Again.""

Leo, bless his heart, immediately looked sheepish. ""Oh, the cereal... was that yours? My bad, I just kinda, like, saw it there. I was gonna get more, I swear!"" Maya nodded. ""Yeah, I noticed the saucepan too. I figured someone would get to it."" My frustration, which had been simmering, kinda evaporated at their genuine, if a little clueless, reactions. It wasn't malice; it was just... forgetfulness and assuming.

We ended up having an actual house meeting, which, tbh, felt super adult and a little cringe at first. We talked about how the shared kitchen was becoming a source of stress, not because anyone was intentionally being a jerk, but because we just weren't communicating. We decided to try a shared whiteboard system for chores – assigning specific days for kitchen, bathroom, and general tidy-up. And for snacks, we agreed to a ""you finish it, you replace it immediately"" rule, or better yet, just ask first. It sounds simple, but that conversation, even with the initial awkwardness, felt like a huge weight lifted. We even shared a laugh about the ""cereal heist"" afterwards. It showed me that even small misunderstandings can blow up if you don't talk it out, and that our house wasn't just a place to crash, but a community we actually wanted to make work.

Living with others honestly hits different when everyone's on the same page. If you're navigating shared living, HomeCo makes it simple to coordinate chores, split bills, and keep the peace. Because the best house stories happen when the logistics just work.

1nqnxl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1nqnxl5/friend_group_chaos_my_attempt_to_mediate_blew_up/,Friend group chaos my attempt to mediate blew up in my face (23F). How should I continue with Friend Group? TW: Abuse/Anxiety,"Ok. Hi, this is my first ever Reddit post, and it's gonna be long. Buckle in. I really need advice of all sorts. What should I mention to Leon? What should I do with the group? What should I do about Cece? Just any comments and such would help me so much. 

All the people in the story: OP (23f), Cece (27f), Dede (24f), Leon (29 NB), Tommy (28 M), Tony (22M), Leah (25F). Mentions: David (30M).

**Relationships to OP:**

Cece-My longest-term friend (almost 4 years). In an on/off abusive relationship with David. I have been super supportive for her through this even though I obviously don't like the guy. 

Leon-Newer friend, close to me though, known them for a year+. Has a crush on Cece. Host of games. 

Dede, Tommy, and Leah-Friends through Cece and part of a group that hangs out for games, all about less than a year. 

Tony: Dede's ex, recently reconciled with her

The Main Incident: Dede wanted to bring an ex, Tony, to the game night. Leah doesn't want him there. Cece blows up. This was all over texts mainly with a few other in-person situations. 

**Some Background:**

There is some work drama between Cece, Dede, and Leah. Leah is a shift lead at a very popular coffee chain. Dede and Cece both work at the same store as well as Tommy. Cece had come to me with concerns about a text Dede said in the friends' work chat. Dede basically needed to change availability. Leah reacted poorly, Cece ended up siding with Leah, and they were also calling Dede names. I told Cece that Leah is a shift (I was a shift at one point, so I know the role well); if there are really concerns about Dede's work ethic, she should go to the store manager. I told Cece not to get involved in this between Dede and Leah. As far as availability, Dede said something that was objectively very true. (She said I have to change it, and the store manager has to be ok with it; I can't help it). I told Cece that if Leah has availability problems, she also needs to go to the store manager.

*Other background?* Cece and David are kind of on and off, and I have put up with a lot of things with them. I'm not just throwing around the word abusive either. He is bad. She has ended things with him multiple times for him to worm his way back. Tony and Dede have worked things out and are friends now. Dede has also had relationship trauma, she also works 2 jobs, and does a sport full-time. Cece knows Leon has a crush on her and has still failed to tell Leon about it. I have tried subtly to let Leon know, but in the end of the day, it isn't really my call to make. Tommy is new to the group. 

So this is the first event, this is in a GC for games: 

**Dede:** Can I bring Tony to game night?

**Leah:** I don't mind if he is there, but whatever. (This is the last week before she could actually start going; she has been to only one game night.) If he is there, I'm going for a walk.

**Dede:** I showed Tony the messages, and Tony understood.

**Leon:** I’m not in the loop with the Tony drama, so I'm going to leave it up to the group; however, if someone is uncomfortable, I will back them up on it.

**Leah:** I don’t care if he didn’t get it. I told you when you tried to tell me about him earlier. The only respect this boy will get from me is the abandonment of my presence.

**Leon:** I’d rather have Leah than Tony over.

**Dede:** Tony is my friend now, and he knows he fucked up and acknowledges his mistakes and is working to change.

**Cece:** I can see both sides, but I would like to be with Leah on game night. If that can be planned, and her boundary is that Tony shouldn't be there, then I would prefer that it be honored. I do miss Leah a lot. I understand why she doesn't want him around. I'm not going to fight or argue about it. I don't mind him; I talked to him about it, but if things can be coordinated, then please. 

**Leah:** If you want him around, have him this time, but after this, no.

**Me:** I’m gonna say it’s none of my business, I can have my own opinions without conflict. Dede, if you wanna do you, do you. Leah, I hope you can come as we have missed you. Don’t know all that's happening though, but in the end of the day it’s none of mine.

**Cece:** He’s fine, they talked about it, but boundaries are boundaries. It’s not my place to defend anyone or not, but if someone tells me they’re not going to want to be around, because of something, and I want this person around, then I’ll try and make compromises, I don’t think you understand I love Leah the most (not as a partner, as a friend Leah has been friends with Cece less than a year).

**Dede:** Tony put his shift off for game night, so are you ok if he comes this week?

**Me:** I know that, but like past grudges and stuff. I know a bit about what happened between Dede and Tony, but again, it’s not really any of mine. Not saying I don’t care, but I think I’m coming from a non-biased pov.

**Cece**: Boundaries are boundaries, and I won't push past that. We all have boundaries we don't cross and I am never going to question that. 

**Dede**: Ok, but Leah said she can't go this week. He is genuinely my friend now, like we talked through it all, and he knows his faults. Also, Leah, he would understand if you had to go off on him, like he knows the messed up. 

**Leah**: I have no interest in playing his masochist games. He can use his imagination. 

**Dede:** He isn't a masochist. He messed up; he's young and figuring things out. He knows what he did wrong and wants to change. 

**Leah**: Sounds like it. I don't like him, and he wants me to go off on him? That sounds like a masochist.

**Leon:** I'm sorry, but I have to say no. There is a precedent that is set if I were to invite him over this week, that he could be invited again in the future, and I just don't feel that is worth it. 

**Dede**: Listen, he isn't a masochist; he is okay with you going off on him because he understands he messed up and gets where you come from in it all. Can you all listen to me for once, please? I'm the one who knows him better than any of you all here. People change; it's part of life. 

**Cece:** Dede, you asked for permission, people say no, we are listening, we have been, that’s what this friendship is.

**Dede:** not fully tbh.

**Cece:** you just want people to always say yes you are privileged asf.

**Dede:** no I’m trying to defend a friend of mine, I’d do the same for any of you.

**Leah:** I do not believe he changed and is old enough not to bully people the way he did you. I think he is using you and you’re making excuses for it.

**Dede:** Using me in what way, huh?

**Cece:** Girl you asked yes or no, why can’t you just take a no?

**Leah:** Dede, he is using you for company right now, it's an oh let's be friends then it’ll be something more. I don’t want to be a part of his life at all, even if that means excluding you.

**Cece:** I don’t mind him. We talked, you can have your game nights, but I will not be around; that’s my boundary.

**Dede:** No one is forcing shit.

**Leah:** You are.

**Dede:** I’m asking if he can come to a game night you won’t be at, and he understands past that, he probably won’t be at more.

**Leah:** You asked, I said what I would do, and now you're mad and saying it’s ok for me to go off on him to get me to stay.

**Cece:** No. I can’t be any clearer. It was up to them, they answered, you’re pressed.

**Dede:** I get it.

**Leah:** He can go. I’m removing myself. She left the GC.

So that was the Group Chat. I'm not ok with name-calling, and a lot of things that went down here. I felt like this was just awful, but this is just the start. About Midway, when I said I don't know what's really going on, Cece texted me.

**Cece:** Texting you outside GC so you know. Tony always has some bull ass excuses for why he was cutting off Dede, and Leah won’t handle that, and Dede will go through whatever hoops to defend him because they are ok now. But we (meaning Cece and Leah) were at the worst of Dede’s falling out.

**Me:** Dede usually will go through hoops to defend.

**Cece:** Yep, and she doesn’t see that, but Leah will stick to her shit.

**Me:** I think of it like this. Dede will keep doing her, and Leah will keep doing her. Personally, I understand how Leah cares and sticks to her boundaries, and I respect that and would like her to come, but on the flip, Dede won’t learn boundaries without consequences imo. In the end, I really feel like it’s not comfortable, yes, but will that stop Dede from inviting Tony? No. And not to call you out in any way, but to merely use this as an example, I care and have an opinion on David, but when he is around, I don’t tell you no (at this point in the GC, Leah is taking jabs). I feel that it makes it personal to me when it shouldn’t be me and David having beef. I don’t know if that makes sense. Not in a rude way, just a true statement. I can not like someone and still have them around and be cordial with them, and that's a me thing. If Leah doesn't want to be around, that's her thing. If Dede wants to jump through hoops, that's her thing. I'm not taking anyone's position here; besides, I really don't care. I hope Leah comes, I hope Dede understands. At the same time, though, I cannot reasonably say it crosses anything for me to not be ok with Tony there. 

**Cece**: You making that comparison makes me mad.

**Me**: I'm sorry.

**Cece**: I have not invited David in a lot of situations (she has invited him to multiple things) because I never want to put anyone in an uncomfortable situation. I don't defend him. I feel guilty. It's not comparable imo.

**Me**: I'm sorry. I can't tell what kind of mad you are over text (you know, I'm mad at you for this but not really, or I'm mad mad at you). Also, I didn't say you defended him. My exact words were, when he is around, I won't say no, even though I have an opinion on him. I feel as if this has been taken out of context. I'm not comparing relationships, just having people over. Also, don't feel guilty about having him over around me. I've never said no or that I'm uncomfortable (I'm not, by the way). This is all said not in a mean way or degrading or anything negative, just how I talk to you when I give you real talks. (We have had real serious discussions before.) I am sorry, though. I hope you can come to an understanding with me. I don't want to fight. If you would like to call too, I can. (Spoiler... no understanding)

**Cece:** I’m not mad, and I’m not taking it personally. I guess I’m more mad with Dede because I deal with most of the shit, and I’m always on the other end of her being hurt and dealing with her worst rants. I don’t want Tony intruding on this either, in case of anything else. (Now sidebar: This is where I’m having a lot of issues. There is name-calling, my friends are being mean to each other (a dynamic I have not experienced with this group), and there is a lack of perspective coming from Cece. Everything she is saying, I have had to deal with for 3 YEARS from her. done with sidebar.) I’m down with new people, I’m down with whoever, but after what Tony did, and she’s so willing to defend him, like you need to stop. I want to protect some part of my life with friends from that hazard. I’m going to be harsh with her because she will not get it until it’s right there. She also sends me a screenshot from Leah**:** *basically, really mean things about Dede, saying she’s dumb for not waking up and realizing Tony is using her*

**Me (before SS):** I know, and it’s frustrating, but there is also that part where you have to protect your peace in this. Dede isn’t going to change overnight about Tony, especially in the way she is defending him. I don’t think she understands yet, and it will eventually click for her. I hope she will come to terms, but I learned one thing with Dede very quickly: she doesn’t want to change right now, and it will drive you crazy if you try to change for her. You can be there, but draw these boundaries where you don’t want to talk about Tony’s shit if she’s looking for advice. Sometimes it sucks to have people be stuck in a loop, but you don’t have to stick yourself in it. Say what you need to, listen to her, and if she asks, say I’ve said what I need to say on the situation. Everyone being so invested isn’t helping her.

**Cece:** If he goes, I will not be around.

**Me (in reply to SS):** I get that Leah will stay on how she stays for friends. Everyone is different in this situation, but I think this is what is causing something, though. Dede is stubborn; she won’t learn from anyone but herself.

**Cece:** And I have to start being stubborn too, because no, she will not understand, I don’t trust him. (Sidebar, I am getting SO FRUSTRATED AT HER LACK OF AWARENESS and the name-calling and the gaining up on Dede.)

**Me:** I think I fail to understand how this directly affects Leah and you. Directly. You can change the subject if talked about, but cutting ties and stuff with Dede and other friends because of Tony isn’t the right move imo. The name-calling isn’t the right move. I’m not feeling right about a single thing about this. (Cece and I basically only hang out during game nights and DnD now, so she would be cutting ties with me.)

**Cece:** If she invited him to game night, I don’t want to be around. She’s infatuated with him, again, when he ghosted her without explanation, but that’s all she talked about for a month; she doesn’t see that. I don’t want to be a part of whatever is going on now, I’ll be ok. Girl, it’s not cutting ties, but setting boundaries. I’m stressed when she’s stressed and hurt, and I hate being that way. 

I try calling because I don’t want to text anymore. She doesn't pick up. I send this

**Me:** Ok, without this sounding rude or mean, just truthful. I cannot speak for Leah 100% because I don’t know her well enough. But I do feel like I know you. I feel like I can look at you and say what is happening is wrong, and what you’re doing, I feel, is wrong. You are claiming not to defend anyone, but having a bias for Leah instead of trying to let Leah and Dede talk this out. You are being personally affected by something that you should try not to be bothered by. In response to that bother, you are taking a rather extreme move to prove a point to Dede. Dede isn’t failing to understand; no, she is now on defense because she and her friend are being attacked. I want to reiterate that I am not friends with Dede or Leah the way I am with you. You can do what you need to do, but I don’t feel right about this.

**Cece:** Girl, I don’t know how to say, Dede is very privileged, she is ignorant about her privilege. It does affect me because they are both my friends, but Leah is overlooked. I will let it affect me. I will take extreme approaches with Dede because I don’t think less will work.

**Me (realizing the conversation isn’t going to go anywhere):** Ok, you do what you need to do.

**Cece:** Ok, I’ll do me, I’m dropping game night and DnD, that’s it.

SO that's what happened. I take that as a very deliberate way to hurt me in the situation. Maybe I'm wrong, but she knows that's the only way we hang out now. I have a history with anxiety and have panic attacks at least like 1-2 times a week. It's bad. I immediately start having a panic attack when she does this, and try calling her multiple times. She ended up blocking me on everything. So I sent her a text, this is in my anxiety-induced state, so it's embarrassing. Please don't judge too much. 

**Me (to Cece):**  
When you can call me back, pls do. Can you at least talk because I’m freaking out, this is so mean. What did I do to get this response from you? I just want to talk, I’m freaking out so bad. I want you to know I was always there for you, and I will be there for you. You are my friend, and I really do mean that. We have been friends for a long time. I know you well, and you know me well. I don’t know what I can do in this situation. All I can say is I’m sorry for anything. I will always tell you what I think. I always say it out of love, not hate. I love and value our friendship so much more than the opinions of a guy coming over to game night. I’m honestly so hurt by what you’re doing. I don’t want to text a bunch, but I also can’t go to sleep because I think I just lost one of my closest friends over something I don’t know what I did. I just want to talk. I want to know if this is over or if we can patch it up. I never meant to make you upset, and you know I’ll be there for you. Pls pls pls, even if you don’t want to be friends anymore, can you at least tell me? I feel like a rug has been ripped out from under me. I’m panicking and don’t know what to do. I shouldn’t have said anything or said what was on my mind. I’m sorry, I know people need space, but I can’t do that, though. I just need something. I’m so sorry, pls.

So yeah. I sent that. I'll kinda mention what I said the next day, but I will now catch you all up on some conversations I had with Leon about this. Days might get a bit mixed up, so I label now. 

Once I calmed down, the next day I sent a Voicemail (I was still blocked, but with her phone, I know when she unblocks it comes through). 

Basically, I said that I was sorry for what I did. I let her know that she hurt me as well with what she said. I said that I do not want to text about this at all anymore and would like to call or meet in person about this. The only text I would allow is ""when are you free to meet up kind of things. I let her know I didn't mean to hurt her, truly, and that I valued our friendship. Nothing mean was said, and I was more coherent. 

  
Back to that night where everything is going down and continues onto the next day when I sent the normal voicemail to Cece. This is between me and Leon.

**Me:** Omg, everyone hates me from that text I sent in the GC.

**Leon:** Honestly, I think you managed to stay neutral. sounds like this has been building for a while now, and Dede is being tested a bit with some accountability of her friendship.

**Me:** I guess I don’t know. I think Cece is mad at me. (This was after the first time she said she was mad.)

**Leon:** Interesting, would you be ok to share?

**Me:** I don’t know, I’m trying to figure it all out rn.

**Leon:** My overall vibe I get is that you have to let people figure out their own shit at their own pace, and as long as they are not starting beef with you, they have tolerances with hanging around people even if they don’t respect them fully. Leah has a much lower tolerance, and this is forcing an ultimatum with Cece and Leah.

**Me:** I don’t think I understand, but I’ll try rewording it, lmk if I get it wrong. Personally, everyone is letting Dede’s shit affect them when it really should only affect her. Leah will defend no matter what. Cece is jumping for Leah even though claiming to be unbiased. Honestly, Leon, this whole situation is pissing me off. The conversation I just had with Cece and what’s happening in the GC is not how I know anyone in this group to be, and it’s quite frankly immature and embarrassing behavior from all parties.

**Leon:** Do you want to talk about it over the phone?

**Me:** Yes.

We call, and Leon explains what Cece was texting Leon and how she was feeling about the comparison between David and Tony. I explain my pov and what happened up to that point. 

**Later that night:**

**Me:** She just texted me that she’s dropping DnD/game night, and I don’t know wtf I did wrong???

**Leon:** I got the message too.

**Me:** I’m actually so hurt rn I tried calling but she’s blocked me.

**Leon:** Wtf?

**Leon:** Take care of yourself. This might be a time when people need some space. I didn’t realize how sudden this could happen.

**Me:** I don’t know wtf is going on. I’m not ok and I’m freaking out. Did she tell you anything else?

**Leon:** The main thing she sent is your text to me and Leah, and she didn’t back you up, and I think she’s all in on Leah rn, and she’s tired of everyone. I’m also worried this is extreme.

**Me:** Which one?

**Leon:** Sends a screenshot of the conversation between Cece and I (The part where I said I cannot speak for Leah or Dede 100% but was telling Cece what she was doing was wrong.) (Also in the conversation Cece was having with Leon regarding that SS of Cece/My message she said I don't like how I was questioning her friendships.) You didn’t do anything wrong.

**Me:** I don’t want to lose a friend.

**Leon:** It’s sad and crazy that it happened so soon.

**Me:** I’m so upset, I just want to sleep.

**Leon:** You are my closest friend, and I appreciate you. You are wonderful and have great confidence. (Leon is super kind and basically was trying to calm me down).

**Me:** Thx I appreciate it, rn there is no confidence lmao I’m just straight up a mess.

**Leon:** I’m going to let you try to sleep and give you some space.

**The next day:**

**Me (to Leon):** Thx for being there for me last night. I hope I didn’t keep you up.

**Leon:** You’re good and were happy to be there.

**Me:** Worst comes to worst, you're ok doing DnD with my husband, you, me, and Tommy still?

**Leon:** I am, and probably should ask Tommy how he is doing.

**Me:** Yeah, I was thinking that too. How are you doing?

Leon: I'm ok, obviously I want Cece in my life, and right now, at least this is how I'm interpreting it, she wants to be left alone. I do want to reach out to her very badly, but still be respectful. I don't know how long to wait. 

We also both discussed that we were proud of Dede for messaging the next day in the GC and saying I'm sorry that I continued defending and that she understood. I also checked in with Tommy, and he asked about me and Cece, and I told him what was going on. 

Okay, so that was the heat of the moment stuff. Now it comes up throughout several days. 

The first thing that happened was Cece texted me (TEXTED ME??) this: I don’t hate you, but I think for me personally, what is better for me is taking a break from people in general. I’ve been stressed, and for now, the best for me will be distancing myself from everyone. I know I’m not the best person, and I have my opinions, but I need a break. You’ve been a great friend, but I know what I need. I know I’ve been quiet about a bunch of things, and I’m tired of it. I don’t want to restrain my ideas to conform to another friend. I’m always playing middle man, and I see how it hurts some more than others. If I’m having the same conversation over and over again, but people are continuously saying,: Sorry, but don’t change, I’m done with it. I’m stopping. I’m genuinely calling it quits. I’ve been tired for so long, but this is the last straw, and I will not apologize for it.

So personally, I feel like that's an I'm done with you text. I felt really hurt by her. I'm a really forgiving person as well, but this is my line. I get making mistakes and accidentally hurting someone; however, intentionally hurting someone and then expecting the one who got hurt to do all the heavy lifting without an apology? No. I'm not going to be friends with that. I'm not ok with people who are intentionally hurting their friends and calling names. Throwing ultimatums, so on and so forth. I didn't mean to hurt her. I apologized so much. Especially for the comparison, I didn't know that would hurt her; I was just trying to show an example that she would be familiar with. It was a genuine mistake. I gave the cards to her, said sorry, and she threw them back at me. I told her I specifically don't want to text, but she ignored that. She said things she knew would hurt me, and I really didn't try to hurt her. I took from this text that she felt like she couldn't be herself around me and that I hurt her more than she was ever letting on, but how am I supposed to know without you telling me? I never meant to, and if someone tells me something, I'm not obviously trying to hurt them. Anyway, I also interpreted this as lying, as she was talking to others in the group at this time, so she was just ignoring me. She still had me blocked. She also said she wouldn't apologize for hurting me. I don't know. This is definitely one of the things I need advice on. I texted her back: Sounds good, take care, goodbye. 

  
The second thing that happened was this. Life was moving on. Leon, Tommy, Dede, and I started hanging out. Leon let me know that they were still talking to Cece. Dede, at that time, was also looking to remain friends with her. I had my moment, but I was not going to force sides or anything from anyone. I literally cried and had another anxiety attack (ugh) about it in front of everyone that one night (it was like 2 days after the main texts from everything), but then never mentioned anything again. Sometimes people would talk, and I would be more than fine to listen. I didn't talk badly about Cece, even with the hurt I was feeling. The worst I said was that I felt like she said a big F U to me, and she was being hypocritical. I've had to choose between people before, and I hated that. If I couldn't get over this, it would also make me a hypocrite in some of my own morals. So I got over it. I'm fine about it. That night, when Tommy, Dede, Leon, and I were hanging out, I let them read every text between me and Cece. I wasn't hiding anything. Leon even said Thank you for showing me the whole picture. 

So recently, this is what is new. Cece ended her friendship with Dede. In a very similar manner to how she did with me. One thing someone mentioned to me was that I didn't respect Cece's space enough. I feel like that was a trap since Dede respected it too much, and Cece said that she was hurt that Dede didn't even check in on her when Cece said Don't talk to me, I need space. Anyway. That night, we were all hanging out. Dede, Tommy, Leon, and me. Dede was going through the same thing I was feeling. I felt bad for her. However, before this, Leon texted me that they knew that Dede was going to need to talk, but they needed to talk to me. So I went a bit earlier. 

There, they confronted me with so many things. 

They said that they felt like I ended things too soon with Cece. I was confused because I told Leon why I ended things and why I felt like I should. They also said it was super uncalled for that I made that comparison. I understand. God, do I understand that was a mistake. I said I was sorry so many times, I don't know what else to do. I told Leon that I apologized for that several times to her, and I don't know what else to do. Finally, this is the main thing. Leon said that they felt I manipulated Tommy and them by saying what Cece did was a big F U. Now, this got to me. 

Cece knew one of my main insecurities was that I felt like I was a bad person. I have sometimes selfish viewpoints (one of them is that the most important person in my life is me because without me, there is no my life). I'm stubborn and stuff, but I don't think I'm a bad person. Well, I do, but I argue with myself a lot about not being one, you know? Abusive people in my past called me a narcissist for things that I don't think are narcissistic. I take accountability, I'm human, and I'm not the greatest. I don't know, anyway, it's a really big personal worry of mine. I started almost immediately fighting a panic attack. I was holding it well, but it got to me eventually. I explained before the anxiety took over to Leon that I'm sorry that they felt that way, and I didn't mean to make them feel manipulated. I reminded them that I showed them all the texts, and I also said specifically that I felt like she said a big FU, not that she did. While freaking out, I also apologized to Tommy. Tommy looked confused and said I never said you manipulated me. Then this is really where I need help, Reddit. Tommy said that the other day, Leon, he, and Cece hung out. Cece said to Tommy that she needed to see the texts between him and me. Tommy showed them because he felt pressured to show he wasn't taking sides. Now confused. I was like, wait a minute. Dede has also said that Cece was telling people at work not to believe what I was saying because I would ""twist the narrative"". 

What should I do about Cece? Tommy is already about to leave the group because of everything. I'm losing so many friends. I'm so worried that anything I do around Leon would be taken badly. I'm trying not to let this be the case, but Leon also likes Cece, so most likely they will listen to what she says. What do I do? Any outside perspective on this would be so helpful. Also, I know narratives can be twisted, but like, I really don't know if I have twisted anything about this. 

Anyway, thank you for reading. Thank you for any advice. 

**TL;DR**

I (23F) have been friends with Cece (27F) for almost 4 years and have supported her through her messy on/off relationship with David. Recently, drama erupted in our friend group (Cece, Leon, Dede, Tommy, Leah, and me) around whether Dede could bring her friend Tony to game night. Texts in the group chat and private messages led to misunderstandings, hurt feelings, and name-calling.

Cece ended our friendship abruptly, claiming she needed space, wouldn’t apologize for hurting me, and blocked me. I showed all texts to our mutual friends (Leon, Dede, Tommy) to be transparent. Cece later similarly cut ties with Dede.

Now, Leon (who likes Cece) believes I manipulated them and Tommy by framing Cece as being harsh to me, even though I shared all texts and was honest. I’m panicking and anxious because I feel Cece is manipulating the narrative, I’m losing friends, and Leon seems blinded by her perspective.

I’m looking for perspective: What should I do about Cece? How do I handle the group dynamics and my friendships moving forward?",1,1758848399.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Now I do understand if you are only here to make money because admittedly I was at the start but that has since changed. Anyways, at currently 10 million market cap Kendu is an absolute steal, the vast majority of memes are down this year and Kendu is no different, we have around a 28x to ATH, this is literally free money. If you put in $1000, chances are you're gonna make at least $28k this AltSeason whenever it hits. **This is obviously NFA,** but I am certainly investing my money.

The crypto game is a lot about community, community effort is everything and Kendu has this in bags. Check any crypto subreddit, we will dominate it, check any X post we will be there, check on Stocktwits we are a leader etc. This is no accident, if we look at the past all the strongest communities have come out on top from Shib to Doge to Pepe to whatever else you want, historically the strongest communities are the most likely to perform the best in terms of price action. This time its not gonna be any different...

Kendu is only the 2nd coin to ever reach 50k Certik votes(it is a very sought after audit), the only other coin to manage this was Pepe. Pepe reached 10 billion market cap outside of a bull run... this just shows the potential that Kendu has. If Pepe can reach 10 billion Kendu can soar past this.

Murad and other prominent crypto people preach community, community, community.

So why not buy Kendu?

Literal life changing money is on the table and tbh it is the most educated investment you can make rn, coins over 500 million have kinda had most of their pump. Kendu still has a 28x before we reach there current market cap...

1nqnvuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PassNclex/comments/1nqnvuq/how_to_pass_the_nclex_i_failed_in_150_then_passed/,"HOW TO PASS THE NCLEX (I failed in 150, then passed in 85)","I just found out I passed my second attempt in 85 questions after failing in 150! **All of my praise goes to God!!!** TRULY!!! 

I wanted to share my two cents on **HOW TO PASS THE NCLEX:**

***✨MY FIRST ATTEMPT*** *(failed in 150)*

* **What I studied:**
   * Listened to Mark K lectures 1-12
   * Archer (I took one CAT exam and passed, and I took 7 readiness exams and got VH, VH, BL, VH VH, H, H in that order. No practice questions)
   * Listened to Dr Sharon must know meds 1-10 videos
* **How the exam went:**
   * Walked in feeling confident
   * Finished in 150 questions, it felt way harder than any nursing exam I’ve ever taken
   * I think I had 7 case studies, one bow tie, one picture to identify, etc
   * I left knowing I failed... it was awful

***✨MY SECOND ATTEMPT*** (passed in 85)

* **What I studied:**
   * NCLEX Crusade on YouTube (red and blue background videos)
   * NCLEX Bootcamp 30 days
   * Dr Sharon on YouTube (prioritization + fundamentals vids)
   * Listened to Mark K lecture 12 on the way to my exam
* **How the exam went:**
   * Walked in feeling confident (paranoid but confident)
   * Finished in 85 questions, it was WAY easier than my first attempt
   * I had 5 case studies (they all felt quite easy except for the 5th one was kinda hard), lots of multiple choice
   * I left feeling certain that I passed!!! I literally cried tears of joy when I got in my car

***✨WHAT I RECOMMEND STUDYING:***

* **NCLEX Crusade 7 day training on YouTube**
   * Red background videos
   * Blue background (NGN) videos
   * I thought the info in these vids were pretty obvious but it was a nice way of re-introducing studying when I was still grumpy about retaking lol. It introduces test strategy well
* **NCLEX Bootcamp!!!**
   * I followed the 30 day study plan. I truly love bootcamp, and it made the studying process somewhat enjoyable (or at least, way more bearable)
   * I wanted to make SURE I gave it my all to pass my second attempt, and I think Bootcamp definitely strengthened my knowledge & prepared me to accomplish that
   * ***My Bootcamp stats:***
      * I finished all case studies + watched the review videos (so helpful!)
      * I did 1830 questions of the Q bank (read all rationales and took notes on only some)
      * Did all of the fundamentals questions & repeated the ones I got wrong until I got them right (NCLEX loves fundamentals!!)
      * Overall performance was 72%
      * I got very high on every readiness exam (73%, 79%, 71%, 74%)
      * *(The most important thing is to do a ton of practice questions and READ THE RATIONALES and understand WHY you got it wrong)*
* **Dr Sharon on YouTube**
   * “Prioritization strategies” playlist (watch all of the videos)
   * “Fundamentals” playlist (for any topics you struggle with)
   * She’s great for understanding test strategy! I would pause her videos to do the practice question by myself and then unpause to see how she explained her thought process
* **NCSBN has an NCLEX exam preview**
   * I didn’t do this, but if you wanted extra study practice, there’s an NCLEX preview exam on the NCSBN website
   * There’s a quizlet with the correct answers to check your work

***✨My MISTAKES the first time:***

* **I only took practice tests.** I remediated those exams but didn’t look at the categories I was doing good/bad in. It wasn’t a comprehensive approach
* **I didn’t take breaks during my study sessions.** I literally only took practice exams with no breaks. It burnt me out. For my second attempt, some days I'd do 20 questions at a time then a break and then more questions, and some days I'd lock in for a practice exam. It wasn't nonstop grind every day
* **I didn’t do any practice Qs**. It’s so helpful to get immediate feedback on questions right after you answered it so that you can immediately correct yourself & evaluate your thought process. Then test yourself with practice exams to simulate the exam
* **I didn’t reaaally think I needed to study!** I had a 3.96 GPA, did very well on the exit exam, my college has a 96% pass rate, Archer said I had >98% chance of passing. But I didn’t do a comprehensive study approach and didn’t realize I was lacking in a few knowledge areas— then the NCLEX noticed I was getting those topics wrong and kept testing me on them 
   * (for example, I didn’t realize I struggled with infection control. But I still scored well on the practice tests before my first attempt because I performed well enough on the rest of the test and didn’t review the categories of where I needed to study more. Then on my first attempt of the NCLEX, it kept giving me infection control Qs because I was getting them wrong and then it led me to being on the cusp of passing. All I needed was a little refresher on infection control rules, but I didn’t realize that until after I failed and looked into it)
* **I didn’t know that the NCLEX was more of a critical thinking exam** and not simply a content exam. Idk maybe I was living under a rock but no one told me this?? I was freaked out on my first attempt when I got diseases, meds, etc that I had NEVER heard of, and then I just thought “well I never learned about this, so I guess I have to guess??” I didn't know the strategy. I wish I knew that critical thinking is the WHOLE POINT of the NCLEX! If you don’t know something, use critical thinking skills + use the strategies from Bootcamp rationales & Dr Sharon videos
* Also, just a side note, **consider not telling anyone when you’re taking the test.** It takes the pressure off. And it killed me having to tell all of my friends, family, etc that I failed (especially because they all expected me to pass without a doubt, so I felt like even more like a let down lol. Very humbling!)

***✨CRITICAL THINKING ADVICE:***

* **Look for key words**— what is the question REALLY asking? The answer should address it
* If a question asks what is the FIRST thing you would do or what would you PRIORITIZE… I will think “okay, that means all of the answer choices could be true.” Instead of trying to figure out what’s right or wrong, assume they all are correct. Then say, “if I could only do ONE thing, what would I do first / which is the MOST important?” (Also, there is usually a difference between the FIRST and BEST action)
* **Look for absolute words** (always, never, only, etc)… that could mean that answer choice is incorrect
* **When in distress, do not assess!** If the patient is in severe life or death distress, you probably aren’t going to evaluate something— you are likely first going to take an action to help them
* **If you don’t know, use process of elimination!** If the question has a random disease or disorder you don’t recognize, look at the answer choices and try to see if you know any of those and then eliminate them if it’s something else!
* When evaluating answer choices… **if you could only do ONE thing, which one would you do?** NCLEX tends to like the most SAFE and LEAST INVASIVE possibility that will fix the problem
* **Don't choose the answer choice you don't know over the one that you do know!** Dr Sharon says this all the time. If you're going through the answer choices and you see one that you think is right, and then you see an answer choice that you've never heard of and don't know if it's right or wrong... DON'T CHOOSE THE ONE YOU'RE UNSURE OF!
* **Compare two answer choices at a time!!!** This was one of the most helpful strategies for me!! Especially for questions that ask for the “best” nursing action. Think to yourself ***“If I do A but not B… would that be better than if I did B but not A?”***
* **Prioritization strategies to remember:**
   * Unexpected vs Expected
   * Early vs Late
   * Acute vs Chronic
   * Objective vs Subjective
   * Physiological vs Psychosocial

***✨Studying advice:***

* While studying, **take it seriously like you would on test day!** If you get a question you don’t know, you might want to just guess because it’s just a practice Q… but would you just guess on the exam? Probably not! You would likely take it more seriously because it’s the exam! Pretend like your studying is the exam. If you don’t know a question, rack your brain or try to use critical thinking to narrow it down. It might work or it might not. But you practice your critical thinking! And if you get it wrong, you can evaluate your thinking / learn the content and then apply it next time you come across an unknown question
* **Limit distractions.** Put your phone AWAY! Practice answering questions with focus. I would put my phone in a drawer, and it actually helped so much with focusing.
* **Act like your practice test is the exam.** Simulate it! Take it at the time your exam is scheduled for. Don’t go on your phone between questions. Don’t sip on coffee or water during your practice test (you can’t bring food or drink into the actual test room). Only get up for a bathroom break or a water/snack break if you need it. 
* If there’s a day you’re feeling particularly anxious (especially as your exam date approaches), try to **study while trying to manage your anxiety** (think of it as practice for test day!)
* **Study areas that you know you’re weak in!** Bootcamp gives you percentages in each category which can help identify your weak spots. And you should watch Dr Sharon vids in those categories too!
* **STUDY FUNDAMENTALS!!!!!!!!!!**
* **STUDY PRIORITIZATION & DELEGATION!!!!!!!!!!**

***✨When going to take the exam…***

* **Mentally prepare**
   * Tell yourself, “I know I’m going to feel anxious. I know I might see things I’ve never heard of” etc …don’t freak out about! Just make sure to breatheee and go slow and **think clearly**
* **Reread the question!!** So many times if I got a practice Q wrong, I’d read the question over and realize I misread the question!
* If you don’t know the answer right away, SIT AND THINK! **Don’t just guess and move on immediately.** At the very least, try to narrow it down or rack your brain
* **Expect 150 questions.** I don’t care how smart you are. I went into my first attempt feeling so confident and assumed I would get 85 questions since so many of my peers did and I had good scores blah blah blah. HUMBLED!!! When I got to 86, I didn’t panic— but it certainly didn’t boost my confidence. Just get over your pride and expect 150 Qs and be pleasantly surprised if you pass in anything less
* **Don’t select SATA questions based on vibes** lol. I would always make that mistake and over-click answers because “I feel like it sounds right.” I’d rather under-click correct choices and get partial credit than over-click and accidentally click something wrong. There were a couple times I only selected one answer choice on SATA of my passing exam
* **Use the whiteboard!** I didn’t use it on my first attempt but it really helped me straighten out my thoughts on my second attempt!!
* **Pray!!!!! Pray, pray, pray!**

***✨The last thing I will say:***

* **My first attempt felt SO MUCH HARDER than my second attempt.** 
* Maybe if I knew the test strategies I would’ve felt differently, but the content itself truly threw me for a loop too. I genuinely didn’t know how to target my studying for my second attempt at first because the exam felt like NOTHING I had studied for previously. And then my first Bootcamp exam when prepping for my retake said that I had no categories to improve in, so I was like what am I supposed to improve in to pass??
* I think learning the test strategies was really helpful (expected vs unexpected, etc), but also I do think the content on my second attempt was SIGNIFICANTLY easier. I GENUINELY think it was just an easier exam. Knowing the test strategies made it even easier. But I feel like if I had my second attempt exam for my first attempt, I would’ve passed. But who knows! And who cares!
* Regardless, I’m glad I studied hard for the second attempt because you just never know what kind of test you will get! And it allowed me to walk in confidently despite the nerves from the possibility of failing again. So, **LEARN THE TEST STRATEGIES!!** And **use NCLEX Bootcamp**!!! If I could go back, I would have rather overstudied the first go around than have to tell everyone I know that I failed, pay another $550 to retake, and spend hours and hours studying for a month and a half leading up to my second attempt (it sucked... but I'm so grateful to be done).

I pray this was helpful!! And if you’re retaking, **you CAN and WILL pass!!!** I know it feels never-ending, but **PERSEVERE!!** The Lord is your strength!

Happy to answer questions!! **God bless :)**",23,1758848261.0,PassNclex,15,0.96,False
