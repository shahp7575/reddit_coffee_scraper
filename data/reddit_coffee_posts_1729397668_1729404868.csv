One popular choice is **chicory root coffee**, known for its rich, roasted taste similar to coffee. It’s naturally caffeine-free and is often blended with dandelion root for added health benefits.

Other alternatives include **mushroom-based drinks**, offering earthy flavors and potential cognitive benefits.

Last but not least **Postum**, a grain-based drink made from wheat and molasses, popular in caffeine-free diets. Each option gives you that coffee-like ritual without the caffeine kick.

It stars's off as something minor but he escalates things to the point that I need to get phisically away from him because i feel sufocated and he won't stop, I have told him during our arguments to drop it multiple times, to stop it because the argument is going nowhere but he wont, or he will stop for a short time than starts again. 

The only way to stop him is to walk away.

I've told him what is bothering me but it doesn't register, after our last argument he told me that he does not know what he has done wrong so i explained him that:

-  the way he reacts to disagreements scares me to the point I don't feel safe with him anymore

- that I don't like how our arguments escalate

-that I don't like  the way he buldoses everything to get his way

- how he won't give me room to tell my side

- how when i get my chance to say anything he won't listen because after a few minutes we circle back to things I have allready explained

- how he won't stop even when I ask him to repetadley

- how it freaks me out the way he says one thing that bothers me and a few minutes later he claims he never said that or that i missunderstood


He claimed that he does not starts argument, he's just telling his side,

How the last fight we had was because i missunderstood things

He haven't done anything to make me fewl unsafe

That I am reacting this way because of my perfectionism and he can not be perfect

How he is ignoring everything about me that scares him, dislikes or wants to be different

But he understands how he can be suffocating because he hes been told this hundreds of times before and it's just the way he is.



I feel that there is something seriously wrong with him, even with his last text and that I shoult stay away from him because it will get worse.


The reasons for our arguments escalated too it started off small ( from how i should drink my coffee, a prank he pulled that i didn't liked to talking to me with contempt ( dealbreaker) and lying ( also dealbreaker)

Another thing to mention is that he had an severly traumatic childhood where physical violence and emotional abuse were the norm, with narcisictic parents who were constantly figuring eachother and both took their frustrations out on him ... I guess this plays a part in the way he reacts and i feel sory for him, but I'm afraid he's repeating the same behaviours.

No accidents and no disruption, all she would do was lay down and sleep until me and my girlfriend would come back home.

All of a sudden, at around the 9 month mark, she completely forgot all of her good behavior traits and turned to a disruptive mess when we would leave her alone. She will pee, poop or even chew up furniture if she's left alone.

We ended up having to cage her when we were gone, where she would behave well and sleep until we're back. But, after some time, we figured it would be safe to let her out.

**Boy, were we wrong.**


If she's not peeing/pooping in the house, she's chewing up the rug. If we spray the rug with anti-bite spray, she chews the coffee table. If we spray the coffee table, she pees/poops in the house. If we take her out to potty before we leave... well I'm sure you can guess what she does.

We can't win, and we don't understand why. Is this just a common phase she's going through or are we doing something wrong? Any pointers will be greatly appreciated!",1,1729404429.0,Goldendoodles,0,1.0,False

1g7s4kq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FilipinoCanadians/comments/1g7s4kq/the_filipino_diaspora_are_an_extension_to_the/,The Filipino Diaspora are an extension to the larger Filipino society ,"With this post I am going to attempt to put an end to the debate between the Filipino Diaspora (us) versus the Filipino Mainlanders (them). 

The question that comes to everyone's mind is: **Can the Diaspora claim to be true Filipinos?** No, they can't but neither can Mainlanders because arguably the ""true Filipino"" doesn't exist. 

With over 160+ dialects and 7000 islands with tribes as diverse as fish in the Pacific Ocean, it's impossible to define what ""true Filipino"" actually means. ""True"" presupposes accuracy to a singular primary source, but if there are over 160+ dialects and possibly thousands of tribes, which of these are truer over the other? What is the primary source? All of them? Impossible.

Filipino identity is neither monolithic nor hegemonous. Cebuanos barely speak Tagalog in Cebu but are proficient in English, does that make them less or more Filipino?

So I propose we use ""pure Filipino"" as opposed to ""true Filipino"" to create a realistic metric that may be used to gauge just how Filipino one is. Purity of identity doesn't mean lesser or more, it just considers how much of the identity is either fused or filtered. ""True"" also insinuates ""fake"" which to me sounds ridiculous and pretentious.

If we can accept the mandala model as a spectrum then we establish the Philippines as the center of the mandala. Pure means Filipinos living in the Philippines. That's the center. The farther out from the radius from the center one goes the less pure the Filipino. 

Again this doesn't mean lesser or more Filipino, it just assumes how much external influence can affect the purity of the identity. 

Take for example coffee. Black coffee is pure coffee. Add some milk or cream or sugar. Does that make coffee lesser or more? Neither, I'd argue. It just transforms the purity. For even the most polished coffee afficionados can claim a French Latte tastes better than an Italian Cappuccino. Who's right? Why not both?

The Diaspora must acknowledge a fused or filtered identity due to outside pressures to accept this model. Again, the emphasis is on purity not to an engage a lesser or more, better or worse, just an acknowledgement of the transformation of the purity.

Using myself as an example, I was born in Africa, lived in the Philippines for 2 years, and lived pretty much my entire life in Canada. External influences are plenty, so I can no longer I'm a ""pure"" Filipino due to so many foreign pressures affecting my upbringing. I'm a Filipino fused with other cultures so I'm a ""type of Filipino"" just not ""pure"". My proximity to the center of the mandala would be outreaching.

Anyway, I hope this comforts those in the diaspora questioning their identity. Please remember you are a Filipino, might not be the same as a Mainlander Filipino, but a ""type of Filipino"" is still Filipino. Don't ever let anyone tell you you're not.

1g7s4if,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g7s4if/i_have_mentally_checked_out_of_my_relationship/,I have mentally checked out of my relationship,"I 21F have been dating this guy 22M for nearly 3 years. It was an absolute whirlwind romance, it felt like I had found my soulmate. No one knew me like he did. I have never just instantly clicked with someone so fast before. We lived together for a brief moment in time before he went back to school full time and an apartment on just my income was not going to be possible where we live. 

The issues arise after we stop living together. We both had to move in with our respective parents. I would say we are ""mid distance"" about an hour each way. It was an issue before we lived together where if I wasn't the one making plans and planning dates things wouldn't happen, and that was a conversation we had and the behavior changed and he made an effort. But last time I brought up that I'm the only one that makes plans his reasoning is he's ""busy"" I understand college is difficult but, I work 2 full time jobs, (about 84 hours a week between both jobs) each with a very flexible schedule so I can come and go as I please. (I'm a hairdresser) my second job is super close to where he lives. maybe 20 mins with traffic, I have asked multiple times if he would like to meet up to get coffee or see each other before I go into work, I have offered to pay and pay for his gas out to come see me. Still nothing. The other day it took him 12 hours before he texted me a single word. He did not have class, he was on his phone I could see he was online in other social media apps but it took him 12 hours to even text me hello and even then it was after I had to start the conversation. It hurts feeling like I'm the only one putting in effort.

I am so mentally checked out because it has been like this for months and I can't deal with being with someone that doesn't seem like they want me. But at the same time I am so absolutely in love with him and I want to help him with school and be there for him through everything. I don't think I could do that as just his friend. In the same breath I can complain about how tired I am of feeling like an after thought I can proclaim my love for this man. I know we need to break up because the relationship is no longer healthy I just needed to get this out of my brain. thank you. I apologize for any grammatical errors I am currently sleep deprived.

1g7s4bd,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPGdesign/comments/1g7s4bd/working_on_a_j_and_eastern_horror_rpg_thoughts_on/,"Working on a J and Eastern Horror RPG, thoughts on the system thus far","I've been thinking a lot about creating my own RPG, and with the lack of a J-Horror RPG, I started coming up with some ideas and writing out a skeleton for the rule set.

I've been playing TTRPGs pretty much my entire life, to include such games as DnD, Pathfinder, Shadowrun, Call of Cthulhu, Free Leagues Alien, All Flesh Must be Eaten, Toon, Star Wars, FF Star Wars, and have bought the rule books for dozens of other game out of curiosity and a hope of running them. Also I've been exposed to more games thanks to the wonder of YouTube.

Moving back to Eastern and Japanese Horror, one of the most important aspects is the sense of impending doom. This is hard to create in a genre of games designed around the players being heroes who will always succeeded. To capture this sense, I plan to give players limited resources that will slowly tick down as the session and game go on.

The first resource is the Core Characteristics, Mind, Body, and Soul, that double as health points. Stealing from Warhammer, I plan to use a d6 dice pool where each die is evaluated separately and certain results are successes. Higher the Characteristic, lower the result need to be. Taking from Alien, any success counts as a successful check and extra successes can be spent on ""Stunts"". Characteristics of 0 will need a 7+, 1-2 needs 6+, 3-4 need 5+, and =>5 need 4+ to succeed. There are three damage types, corresponding to each Characteristic, meaning that as the players take damage, passing checks will get more difficult. If a Characteristic hits 0, any more damage is allocated to the next Characteristic (Mind ->Body->Soul->Mind). If all three hit 0, the character is dead.

The second resource is Luck, an independent stat to the Characteristics based loosely on the Call of Cthulhu's Luck system, allowing players to manipulate the world/game, add dice to the dice pool and reroll dice after a check is made. Each time they use their Luck, the stat lowers and can't be replenished until the start of the next session (unless the GM says otherwise).

Thirdly is Energy which appeared in Obscure and the new Arkham Horror RPG. Energy is a fixed amount of points players get at the start of each session, and can be replenished in game by taking rests or drinking coffee. Players may add a number of dice to the dice pool equal to the number of Energy they spend. Spend three energy, they get three extra dice to the check. If they go into the negative, they spend Negative Energy and add Stress Dice to the pool vice normal dice.

Finally, briefly touched on is Stress. Taken from Alien, Stress is a stat that will slowly climb. When building a dice pool, players add a number of Stress Dice equal to their current Stress level, which can make passing a check easier. However, rolling a natural 1 on a Stress Die means something bad is going to happen, such as running out of ammo, flashlight batteries dying, the car not starting or suddenly stopping, a monster appearing, ETC. The player will also need to make a panic test where they roll 1d6+current Stress level, and if its a 7+ their character panics and they lose control of the character for a short time.

There is more (Attributes, skills, ETC) but I'm looking for feed back on the core system. Will this create the sense of pending doom like I think it will, or is it simply too much and I need to cut back a little. Could this system even work, or how might I modify it to get the feel I'm going for?",0,1729403907.0,RPGdesign,0,0.33,False

We were always connected in deep love. Didn't have to see her to feel her always with me. Total acceptance. When she died also I couldn't go to the funeral as she had planned it to behappy and I would have cried all through it. Fuck I'm stupid. I've had more than one beautiful connected love that is always there. I still and forever have her in me, I can feel her, she wrote me ""My love for you is unconditional. I don't try to explain it. It just is. I love you"". Of course i have that letter. Talking to her son about her celebration on the phone, he spoke of how she loved ladybugs, and he came home to a house full of them. As we talked, a real ladybug, not Chinese beetle, landed on my coffee cup on the coffee shop table. I photographed it, told him and he said, you were always special to her. Damn damn damn another beautiful person gone. I love you Anita. You knew more about ne than I did. Your love was so pure you smiled and let me do as I pleased, secure in the knowledge that we are always connected, even after physical death I feel you and know. I love you,  but ou know that as instantly I feel it, you do too. You know. Wherever you are I fel it too. Dear God thanks for that love.",1,1729403633.0,Unsent_Unread_Unheard,0,1.0,False
1g7s06s,https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/1g7s06s/star_control_origins_meh/,Star Control Origins; Meh,"Star Control Origins is a reimagining of Star Control 2: The Ur-Quan Masters (""Free Stars: The Ur-Quan Masters"", which is the free fan modification), and I'm disappointed. The changes don't add value, and the basic game play loop is dull.

The Ur-Quan Masters is a 1992 science fiction, 2D physics, story-driven, resource management, arcade simulator. You captain a single space ship recovered from an archeological dig, and return to Earth to find it locked inside an alien prison shield, with only a few people in an orbiting space station. Why did this happen? Who did this? How do we stop it? The game is to explore, gather resources, learn information, use this information to seek out aliens, new planets, new star systems, new capabilities, and rescue Earth. The main gameplay sections are:
-Solar System Map: Each solar system has planets and moons, and maybe a hostile factions' space ships. Navigate to a known destination, while avoiding threats.
-Planetary Map: Each planet or moon has resources, and a variety of threats. Gauge your in-game, and out of game, capabilities, whether it is worthwhile to risk landing on a planet, or whether the dangers are too great. Once on the planet, dodge hazards, and seek out the most valuable resources.
-Space Battle Map: When you encounter a hostile space ship, select a ship in your fleet, and battle it on a 2D map in real time. Damage and lost resources are persistent, and managing resources on long explorations is essential.
-Hyperspace and Galaxy Map: There is a huge map with hundreds of stars, and each star with it's own orbiting bodies. Some stars have valuable plot or resource items; while others don't. The map is open, even at the beginning of the game, but more distant locations are risky, or infeasible to reach, in terms of fuel and hostile locals.

Each mini game ties into the larger resource management game. Each conversation provides hints and clues of where to go next, and each exploration into the unknown gives both risk and reward. 

Then there's some crap parts. The game really needs to be played with pen and paper; and you probably want some graph paper and a ruler as well. The resource gathering mini game can become grindy.

Star Control: Origins tries to do the same, but it's falling flat for me, and here are the first few reasons.

- The first alien that I met, told me that I was special, and gave me the keys to a network of hyperspace gates. (In Ur Quan Masters, this encounter was unique, and required solving a minor mystery. In Origins, we've barely started scratching the surface, barely started the exploration aspect of the game, and we're given a solution, prior to introducing a mystery.)

- Every alien that we meet gives us a significant amount of resources. Ships? Cool. Fuel? Pump it. This felt odd from an in-game universe perspective.

- The resource gathering mini game has shifted from a 2D representation, with a map, to a 3D representation with no map. The gameplay loop in the Ur-Quan Masters was to review the resources on the planet, review the threats, identify a landing spot and a route, and then execute that route. Maybe you can gather everything, or maybe only a few very valuable resources are worth gathering, due to the threat to your landers. This was an active mini game. In Origins, there's no selection of landing spot, and no map, and the gameplay loop seems to be driving a tiny car over an oddly 3d planet race course, and when a glowing resource dot appears, to turn towards it. It's similar, but not nearly as engaging. There's no planning skill, there's less risk management engagement, and there's no way to plan and execute a route, as the information simply isn't available. If something pops up, you turn towards it. There is a new game of 'landing' your vehicle, which (would be great if there were skill in managing fuel, managing landing location etc) oddly implemented different controls than while controlling the landing vehicle.

- The Solar System map doesn't retain any inertial movement. The solar system map in Ur-Quan Masters was in a small way a training tool for the ship combat mini-game, and learning to maneuver well was pretty cool. In Origins, there's no ship inertia, and ships quickly decelerate to motionless. This means that navigating in a solar system is easier, less engaging, and also gives a negative training transfer once the new ship combat mini game begins. There's inertia in ship combat, but not in the solar system.

I think that the 'modern' game that echoes Ur-Quan Masters similarly is Subnautica; there is fear in the unknown. With Origins, it seems that much of the fear, and mystery have been removed.

I plan to keep playing, but I am disappointed that a number of items seem to be strictly worse than the precursor, and the items in Origins which received attention (The coffee cup that our manager on Earth has on their desk has animated steam! There's a slick 3D to 2D graphic when you exit hyperspace! The lander mini game has 3D plants!) are not relevant.

If you've played Origins, what are your thoughts, especially after the first few hours?
If you played Origins, but haven't played Star Control 2: Ur-Quan Masters, what did you think of Origins?",3,1729403392.0,patientgamers,1,1.0,False

We know of each other this year lang through instagram pero our interactions lang was react sa story or konting kulit with a few sexual innuendos kasi ma-thirst trap siya sa ig stories niya haha! A few months after, I tried to shoot my shot kasi he's really cute! Wala akong maaya for a midnight coffee run tapos I saw his ig story na nasa labas siya so I asked if he's free pero (apparently late post pala yun 😭) he declined kasi he was about to sleep lol. Pero sabi niya if I want daw we can go out to have dinner the next day. So napaisip-isip ako na maybe he's interested also

So okay g ako. Sabi niya he will be going to the gym pa and bilang magkalapit naman kami ng bahay, I offered to drop him off. Then a few hours after I picked him up again to have our dinner na. 

Our conversation was super smooth. We talked about our life, work, family – never a dead air with him! We drove around and I chose the longer route home kasi ayoko pa siya umalis. While going home we asked about how we felt today – we both said it was a fulfilling ""date"". So we agreed to have a second date.

As a law student, kain oras ko talaga. May class pa ng Saturday. So technically, Sunday na lang free ko. I was studying one time in a coffee shop and he wanted to drop by since its near his place and he did. He bought me dinner. He wasn't afraid to be touchy sakin while I was studying. Nandun lang siya sa tabi ko naglalaro ng ML 😂 So okay, is he really interested???

Eto ka na nga – I understand naman he's a very busy person because of work (medyo mataas yung position niya). I told him na I want to get him more pero sabi niya hindi siya makwento sa chat or online, mas gusto niya sa personal. Gets ba ko ng gen z na babad sa internet at kung mag-update may picture pa na kasama HAHA Di rin siya ma-reply or minsan seen pa nga ako. Which I totally understand! And mas madaldal talaga siya in person tbh 😂 

Please give me some advice how do I keep the ""dating fire"" burning? Sobrang ma-update naman siya sa ig story niya. Like ok pumunta ka ng tagaytay di ko alam or umattend ka ng birthday party pero di ko alam or ok uminom ka with friends di ko alam. Gets ba? A simple update would be appreciated. Pero wala talaga sakanya. 🥶 Ayoko mag-mukhang needy kaya di rin ako ma-reply sakanya haha kasi I always believe in this mantra na I resonate the energy what they give to me.

I legitimately thought I might just be ovulating or something because I had never experienced it to that level but when it lasted two weeks I was like ok this is just different. He is different from my typical type. A lot rougher and more masculine and just hot but hot to another level where I feel like I am an animal or something… he is also a super nice guy and very respectful. We went out for coffee and had a great time and he didn’t try anything physical which was so amazing and made the tension even better for me!! I don’t want to do anything too soon because I love the tension and really do want to get to know him better because I think we would get along… I guess we also both have adhd so I know we could be prone to a fast flame that burns out just as quickly.

So I've been having bad stomach issues for a few weeks, and I have gained 11lbs in weight in the space of 3 weeks. 

I'm suffering from constipation. I normally poop several times a day, but I had been doing once for a few weeks, and they were not properly formed. Type 5-6. I was in pain where I needed to poo more, but it wasn't coming out

For a couple of weeks, I have been drinking green tea, espresso coffee shots, having gut cleanse tablets, dgl liquorice tablets, chewing ginger, drinking apple cider vinegar etc to try and help, and it has been helping me. I've also taken laxatives a couple of times too. 

On Monday this week, I decided to cut out wheat and dairy temporarily to see if it made a difference. 

I've suffered with bloating since I was a teenager, and have issues with IBS, but I also have two forms of kidney disease too, and have been on a number of tablets over the years. I know that this is nothing to do with my kidney condition. 

But for the last few weeks, I have had the bloating worse than ever, blinding headaches, severe dizziness, constipation, diarrhea, my stomach feels lumpy, feeling the cold even more than usual, nausea, appetite is lower etc.  

I'm still going to the gym, and exercising as much as I was before. I've cut my portions, and it's not helping with the weight issue. I've been exercising when I've been dizzy, which I know is not sensible. 

I should mention that I have previously lost nearly 11 stone in weight naturally too. 

I'm just posting asking for advice, because I'm scared. Somebody suggested to me that it could be SIBO. ",1,1729402744.0,SIBO,0,1.0,False

The death of King Ludwig II | Cambridge University Library
www.x.com/saintgothic/status/1847665126947901911
He disappeared while out for a walk with his physician Dr. Gudden and his corpse was discovered a few hours later. The death was officially declared to be suicide by drowning, but the circumstances of his death remain open to question.
The day after his imprisonment, Ludwig II was found dead in Lake Starnberg
Official cause of death: Suicide by drowning
Circumstances: Ludwig and Dr. Gudden disappeared while out for a walk and were found dead in the water a few hours later
Questions: The official cause of death has been disputed because Ludwig was a strong swimmer, the water was shallow, and there was no water in his lungs. The death also doesn't explain the mysterious death of Dr. Gudden
Deposition: Ludwig was deposed and taken into custody on June 12, 1886, after the government declared him insane due to his refusal to act rationally
Burial: Ludwig was buried in the crypt of St Michael's Church in Munich
Ludwig II's artistic and architectural legacy includes many of Bavaria's most important tourist attractions
King Ludwig II of Bavaria died in mysterious circumstances in Lake Starnberg on June 13, 1886, along with his physician, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden

Ludwig II was a romantic idealist who spent his time in his own fantasy world and devoted himself to artistic and architectural projects. He hired theatrical set designers instead of architects, and used his own private royal revenues to build his castles

Neuschwanstein
A dream escape with turrets and a lavish interior featuring images of knights, dragons, and damsels in distress

Constitutional monarchies differ from absolute monarchies (in which a monarch is the only decision-maker) in that they are bound to exercise powers and authorities within limits prescribed by an established legal framework.
“Humanity is enslaved” is the message to cue the end times
Constitutional monarchy, also known as limited monarchy, parliamentary monarchy or democratic monarchy, is a form of monarchy in which the monarch exercises their authority in accordance with a constitution and is not alone in making decisions
With the unification of Germany into the German Empire in 1871, the kingdom became a federated state of the new empire and was second in size, power, and wealth only to the leading state, the Kingdom of Prussia
The Kingdom of Bavaria (German: Königreich Bayern [ˈkøːnɪkˌʁaɪ̯ç ˈbajɛɐ̯n]; Bavarian: Kinereich Bayern [ˈkɪnəˌraɪ̯xˈb̥ajɛɐ̯n]; spelled Baiern until 1825) was a German state that succeeded the former Electorate of Bavaria in 1806 and continued to exist until 1918.

Did you know her? Because I did. It wasn't just a personal use debt. Ron was a low lwvel dealer. Faye convinced Ron to get a meeting to get more product to move. She convinced the higher ups her and Nicole had access to all of Ojs pals, and Jason's elite group from Jackson's where he worked. They knew people who had weekend-long parties and bought 5k in coke at one time for them. They knew plenty of ppl with 5k a month coke habits. She convinced them to front her, Nicole, and Ron a kilo, and a month later, they would pay the mob 100k. They would retail it for 200k and split the profit 3 ways, 33.3k each. Once they did it for a year, they could open a coffee shop and a restaurant. Her and Nicole took product to Cabo but nobody paid them for it in the end. That happened at 2 more parties. Ron was still peddling at clubs but he wasn't moving it quickly enough. Faye and Nicole started using. They were running out of time and got an extension, and one more based on a lie that OJ would come up with money if need be. The mob went to OJ. That is why he and Nicole were fighting. The kids told police ""Mommy was fighting with her friend Faye and crying on the phone earlier"" the morning after the murders. It was over the money owed to the mafia . Faye said she went into hiding because of OJ. She went into hiding because the mob was after her for the debt. Why would she hide from a superstar in jail??? Had she been at Nicole's, she would be dead too.She released a book 4 months after Nicole was killed to get enough money to pay the mafia. She blamed OJ in the book to throw everyone off her scent. The mafia told OJ Nicole was dead. He went to see for himself in disbelief. He brought a knife in case the mafia was there and cut himself on it. He took off his glove to check pulses of Nicole and Ron. He freaked out and ran. They used knives because gunshots in Brentwood would be noticed immediately. Faye didn't even know Nicole but a year or so. She was a skank and a junkie whose husband and boyfriend kicked her to the curb. Faye is the cause of the deaths and ruining OJs life. The mafia threatened OJ with the lives of his adult kids to keep quiet. Oj is an arrogant asshole for beating Nicole, but he didn't kill her.

1g7real,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1g7real/i_still_reel_about_this/,I still reel about this,"I bought an old mini van in 2022. I wish I could’ve bought something better but I’m fucking poor. Who cares. The van has had a few problems but overall in decent shape. There was an electrical issue so I pulled over into a neighborhood as it sputtered out the day before Thanksgiving. I legally parked and knew exactly where I was, unfortunately I parked in front of the wrong house. 

Since it was a holiday weekend i couldn’t get a tow to come for 4 days. Me and my boyfriend would come back to check on it, try to jump it/start it etc. This boomer who happened to live in the house I was near kept bothering me about what I was doing, that I was in his “spot” (nope, legal street parking) and that he was going to call the cops. We told him that it was broken down and that we were trying to move it, including the tow pursuit. 

He’d say EVERYTHING with an aggressive smile. He filmed us. He told us we were hindering their lives. One of the days we went to check on the van I decided to clean it up since it was going to a shop. I’m literally bent over grabbing coffee cups and he taps my fucking backside to get my attention. What the fuck. I tell him to leave me alone. He starts yelling at me that he and his wife don’t like that I’m in front of their house. I tell them the van is not starting. Mother fucker literally saw us try and jump-start it. “When is the tow coming? I need a time. What’s your name? I’m calling the cops! I bet this is stolen, I don’t believe you.” I tell him to leave me alone.

The evening the tow came he came outside before they arrived. My boyfriend tells him to fuck himself and mind his business. Guy says “I’VE BEEN IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD FOR 45 YEARS!!!” Cool? His wife is standing outside, and being the mega-Karen she is says “Well, HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO YOU GUYS TOO!” Wtf?

1g7rdw2,https://www.reddit.com/r/questionablecontent/comments/1g7rdw2/hypotheticals_for_my_ideal_future_of_the_comic/,"Hypotheticals for my ideal future of the comic, because I have literally nowhere else to put them:","Okay, so all of these are in the premise of this being more aligned with the old tone of the comic, just updated (So we still have conflict, dark jokes, etc, just with updated understandings of the world.), which means we'll be reworking a chunk of characters, and changing others. 

The biggest thing I'm gonna start with is **characterizations**, mostly of the characters that feel like they need more refining or anything interesting plotwise. No particular order other than more effort/less effort at bottom.

**Dora**: Being with Tai no longer magically fixes her issues with jealousy, insecurity and neuroticism. She's still not sure about dating, but initially looks past it because of how intense Tai came on glosses over her worries for the early part of their honeymoon stage. Her and Tai cause more friction with Marten as well, this becomes its own plot point.

**Tai**: As we know, Tai in-comic is generally kind of an awful person, but it's glossed over for humor, or because she's tiny and cute, or just because she's a girl. She actively tries to break up polycules, sleeps around a lot, ogles and comments on womens bodies. Very into weed/partying and hooking up. This is not someone that Dora would realistically be into, and not things I feel she'd be able to look past as she realizes more of it. She's like a tiny lesbian version of Sven in some ways. We play into that more, Marten is no longer actually chill with Tai constantly pining after Dora while they're together, but brushes it off more to keep the peace because she's worming her way into his friend group. Vents to Faye about it while drunk, she's initially insensitive but then not because she realizes it is really bothering him that she's doing it and he has no clue what to do. Either she gets outed as a shit person in a massive arc, or she gets a redemption arc. Either way her and Dora are NOT endgame, redemption would likely come in the form of conflict with Marten, then a former polycule and the group becoming aware of all of this. Cue the breakup after a confrontation when Dora realizes Tai is exactly the type of person she wouldn't wanna be with, and heated interactions with Marten as it comes out just how much he kept from Dora about Tai thirsting after her while they were together. Tai ends up self reflecting when ousted from her only real group of friends because she just kind of glommed onto Marten's friend group. Either  that or we don't see her again. If she gets redeemed she eventually ends up on a sabatical from dating/hookups Ala Sven, may or may not have an endgame, don't have one in mind for her. 

**Marten**: Actually do something with the fact people kept telling him to grow a spine and being assholes to him for no reason. Make him conflict avoidant and not chronically chill and mellow about everything. Haha, okay is no longer a genuine response. He stands up to Faye about Padma/that breakup and he and Faye have a bit of roughness before mending it. Generally speaking keep him as the cute indie boy who isn't super macho, but with the early comics darker humor and sarcasm.

**Faye:** Keep her rougher edges even as she opens up more. Sarcastic, slightly rude. I like most of Fayes arc, so I don't have a ton of critique for her. I'd have her deal with some potentially fizzled/unfizzling feelings for Marten post-Dora breakup and friction. Because he's developing and developing a bit more backbone/less conflict avoidant. I do like her with Bubbles, eventually. I think their arc was genuinely done pretty well (aside from deus ex yay newfriend) but I want more conflict re: marten/faye not happening and being that huge cause of insecurity for Dora. 

**Hannelore:** Unpopular opinion, I genuinely like tannelore. I don't think she'd be okay with getting tanned though, given her health worries/skin cancer potential. Design-wise though, it works for her. She remains neurotic post soul-searching. A little more functional. We get glimpses of these mini plots to break up the more serious drama happening in the A plot. She starts seeing a new psychologist when she gets back. We get some comedy out of Hannelore adjusting to some new meds, various coping mechanisms, etc. 

**Claire**: Second unpopular opinion, I really like Claire AND Clinton AND their mom. Not in the way they exist now because all personality has been squeezed out. I like messy claire, uptight claire, very into planning claire. Kind of a buzzkill, but is really sweet at heart. Giant nerd. Surprisingly funny/quick witted. Master of sibling bullshit. I want more of that- less sweet oh so perfect Claire, more of her mess. I'm not sure yet where she'd fit in, if she'd be endgame for Marten, but I like her a lot. Also she doesn't cut her hair. Every trans girl I've ever met IRL who grew their hair out would stab themselves before they cut off their hair when it gets to the length Claire had it. 

Also it just looked better long. The bob cut she got is fugly. Justice for her long curls.

Claire gets to be messy and neurotic. I don't know if Cubetown still exists in this rewrite, or if I'd completely shift it away from that kind of thing. I'm leaning towards the second and restructuring what Cubetown is and \*where\* it is located to keep the comic human focused as opposed to having 100000000 AI characters. I can keep similar plot beats but it being a more local but secret place gives me more room to play with Claire's plot regarding it. I'd keep her as a barista longer. 

Coffee of Doom stays as the 'asshole coffee shop' too. I feel like them calling it out/dropping it was just a big middle finger saying 'I don't care about anything that gave this comic any kind of character' 

**Clinton**: fuck the entire Elliot/Brun/Clinton plot. The tol/smol thing makes me want to claw my eyes out, and it was badly written conflict. Have Clinton fucking things up with Brun make Elliot's crush on him fizzle out, but if you must, have Clinton pine about it, struggling a bit with his sexuality still. Make him crack a joke about how Marten isn't his type, etc. 

  
**Liz**: Full character overhaul, she exists in the cubetown rewrite/localization arc but completely redesigned. She no longer looks like a legal loli and resembles a young adult who happens to be short. Her arms have more obvious robotic elements. Keeps most of her conflict in her being brought on younger and completely floundering due to how much shit is just not being handled. 

**Moray**: no longer exists. this character only happened because Jeph has a slime girl fetish.

1g7raf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChineseMedicine/comments/1g7raf2/i_have_some_questions_about_the_ways_different/,I have some questions about the ways different foods interact with my body and balance. (22F),"  I seem to be particularly prone to coldness and poor circulation, separate from health issues because my blood pressure is fine(78/115), my iron and ferritin are fine, my calcium and Vitamin D are fine, my B12 is fine, my EKG came back fine. But even a slight DAILY deviation from a specific way of eating brings these symptoms on. And returning to it that DAY immediately erases the symptoms from existence. It is both fascinating and annoying.
     
     
  Caffeine(coffee, chocolate, certain teas, energy drinks, soda), gluten(wheat, rye, barley, oats(even GF oats)), beans(soy, tofu, peas, kidney beans, canellini beans), sugar(all syrups, granulated/powdered sugar, etc.), and plant-derived oils(canola, soybean, peanut, corn, olive) all make me really cold and even make my fingernails and toenails kind of blue/purple.
      
       
  And yes, I did go to the doctor for this - 3x. It is why they took an EKG and my iron. Everything came back fine to my dismay, then I found out just eating a f-ton of red meat fixes it for some reason. I kind of want an answer but the doctors don't have one and asking them gets me weird looks and a speech about a ""balanced diet"". Is it balanced if it makes me feel ill? I don't think so.
       
      
  And it is different from physical coldness as even an 80°F environment is not enough to warm me up. They also make my heart race, they make me tired(within 2 hours of consumption), I get headaches, joint pain, my eyes and skin become more dry, my skin can look kind of grey/dull, my gums hurt(not for medical reasons, my dentists think I am insane because my mouth is fine), and I get dizzy if I eat too much(more than a quarter of a palm worth in a day). My body is very strict with these foods. It has decided they are bad. Very bad foods.
       
       
  Now red or purine rich meats(beef, lamb, venison, goat, pork, offal) all do the opposite. Spicy foods(garlic and peppers) and exercise also do this, to a slightly lesser extent. But they make me feel warm, separate from environment as I can hang out in a 20°F blizzard in a t-shirt and be perfectly fine. They also make my heartbeat relax, they make me feel alert, my eyes and skin get very wet and clear/bright, and they make me feel great. I feel in an ideal state if I make these most of my diet and I exercise a good bit every day. 
      
       
  But with a small caveat for the red meat(not the spicy foods or the exercise). If I eat a lot of it I start to feel overwhelmed. But something refreshing like a small salad, a cucumber, some fruit, some lemon juice, some vinegar, immediately fixes that. Basically a small apertif allows me to feel balanced after eating 3000 calories worth of beef in a single meal. 
        
         
  Now I do have perfectly balanced foods. Poultry, all fish, eggs, honey, all dairy(milk, cheese, yogurt) and vegetables(squash, greens, potatoes, carrots, taro, turnips, beets, etc.) make me feel okay. I don't feel particularly hot, cold, dizzy, alert, like my heart is pounding, or like I am in an energized state. I just feel neutral and look neutral if I eat these foods. I can easily eat these foods everyday without feeling awful or great. If I eat poultry or fish offal(liver, heart, eyes, feet, marrow, etc.) they do end up slightly warmer.
 
 
  Fruit, corn, rice, nuts, seeds, honey, most spices(cinnamon/oregano/mint/cloves/cardamom/onion/ginger), coconut, fermented foods(beer/wine/kimchi/sauerkraut) etc. don't really have a place. They don't have an obvious warm/cold/neutral stance.
 
 
  Also my libido is always high. It doesn't seem to change one way or another. ",2,1729400373.0,ChineseMedicine,2,1.0,False
1g7r9zn,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1g7r9zn/youre_more_blessed_to_give_than_to_receive/,You’re more blessed to give than to receive,"I(F) have this super close friend (F) na coteacher ko rin sa isang school. I knew her since college and we are on the same circle ng barkada kaya I can really say na we are super close. We are on a school setup na 2 teachers and nasa isang classroom, parang coteaching ba, we we’re like this for almost 5 years na. Magkaiba nga lang kami ng item bc I am 4 steps higher than her. Performer ang lola niyo sa school mga mi, kaya napromote. 

Patagal ng patagal, napapansin ko na parang nagiging dependent na siya sakin. Like sa lesson logs, nag aantay lang siya na bigyan ko siya copy. Even sa worksheets. Nag aantay lang siya na magpprint ako ng maraming copies and kukuha na lang siya. I can barely see her exert effort in terms sa lesson namin. I get naman na baka nasanay siya na ako yung gumagawa, pero hello? Ni minsan di sya nagkusa na gumawa or magprint ng sarili niyang worksheets. Lahat sakin galing.

Eto pa. Since nasa region kami na minsan ay late ang sahod, may times talagang nashoshort kami. Di naman sa pagmamayabang pero may nabubunot pa ako may nagkecrave ako ng something or may gusto akong bilhin. Aware siya dito kasi alam niyang may pera ako minsan. And itong si friend, panay parinig na parang gusto niyang kumain ng ganyan. Ako naman, since gusto ko rin kumain, bibili ako. Pero kung isa lang bibilhin ko (which is for me lang), baka sabihin niyang madamot ako. Kaya ending, bumibili ako ng dalawa. In short, nililibre ko siya. Maraming times to nangyayari na kapag meron akong binibili, dapat meron din siya. Para wala siyang masabi. 

Kaso dumating sa point na napapatanong nalang ako sa sarili ko na bakit puro ako nalang? Lahat ng nasa classroom namin, HALOS GAMIT KO LAHAT. Decorations (idea ko and gastos ko), coffee essentials na nakikigamit siya (mine), idea ko rin ang mag request ng printer and school supplies sa office, kitchen essentials para sa aming mini kitchen sa akon din. In short parang umaasa lang siya sakin. Even bond paper na equally binibigay sa teachers, inaasa pa niya sakin eh meron din naman siya.

Lately parang natatauhan na ako eh. Bakit kelangan na ako lahat? Di naman sa nagbibilang ako pero never ko pa siya nakitang mag effort man lang para sa classroom namin. Di ako madamot na tao, kasi palagi din naman nagsheshare ng blessings ang mga kapatid ko pag meron sila, kaya mahilig ako magshare. Kaso minsan parang sobra na ata. Parang ang hirap sa coteacher ko na mag extend ng kung anong meron siya. One time nakita ko siya na kumakain ng food na binili niya, pero never niya akong inalok. Inaantay kong alukin ako, pero never niya ginawa. Hahaha mygosh. Samantalang ako lahat ng meron ako shared sa kanya. Again, di ako nanunumbat ha. Parang out of place lang kasi minsan yung pagiging madamot niya. 

Di na ako nagtaka bakit nung teacher’s day, wala siyang natanggap. Samantalang ako nakareceive ako ng gifts kahit kokonte lang ang pupils namin.

Ayoko lang din kasi talaga icall out yung ugali niya kasi baka sumama ang loob. Iniiwasan ko lang na mag away kami dahil nasa iisang classroom kami, ang hirap na naman na di magpansinan everyday. Ayun lang, sguro next time i’ll keep my things with me and control na rin yung shineshare ko with her. ",1,1729400323.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

Last year, I started the patch birth control (bc) and during my shift I threw up. Then It happened again at work when I restarted the patch a few months later. Ive since Stopped the patch entirely. But every time I walked into the hospital for a while I got nauseous.
Flash forward like 6 months later, and I randomly throw up and gotta poop at the end of my shift. I was just sitting for a patient, so nothing was happening to make me queasy. I blamed it on too much coffee. then ….another time I made it out of my entire shift and threw up outside. 
I’ve had things to explain most events like the bc, too much coffee, but now I’m just wondering if my body is just repulsed by the hospital lmao. I’m an aid. I’m not queasy. And I didn’t think I was afraid of my job. I love my job and am going the medical field route.

I agree to meet him next day as I had no plans and was new to the area, thought it would be cool to meet a local. He asked to meet for coffee. 

At first it was fine, he asks me one or two questions. But then soon it becomes all about him, he talks about all the outdoorsy activities he does and I notice he doesn't ask me anything about me. He goes to pet the kittens in the cafe. The cafe workers (two dudes) come around and he starts chatting them up. 

He talks to them so much that they sit down and it was like all three dudes (two cafe workers plus date guy) in conversation with each other around the table, while I am sitting in the other corner of the couch, can't even get a word in. Every time, I talked it felt like I was breaking the social protocol and was not supposed to speak. At one point, one of cafe workers (one of the two dudes) ask me a question, to try to include me. The date guy steer discussion towards themselves again. By then it has been a while of no one talking to me or including me in the conversation, almost 30 mins. 

I gulp down my coffee and get up to return my cup. When I come back, they are still talking to each other and date guy is pretending I am not there. I take out my phone from my bag and try to look up other areas to explore. At this point, I see date guy looking at me. I try to get a word in but it takes me a while as the cafe worker keeps going on and on to the date guy. I finally break through and say, I am going to head out and explore the area. I see the date guy and cafe worker both seem a bit weirded out that I am leaving as if I was not ignored this whole time. I introduce myself to the cafe worker who reluctantly gives me his name and looks at date guy before he does. I tell them both that it was nice meeting them and walk out. 

As I am walking, shortly afterwards, I get a text from date guy saying sorry and that the cafe worker crashed our date. I decide to not send a reply. All I have to say is, no one crashed our date, he is the one who wanted to talk to these other random stranger dudes instead of the girl he asked out on a date. 

He is a good looking man and will get other women to date. I, too had 50+ matches from just unpausing my profile for an hour when I matched with him. I will too have the opportunity to go on a thousand more shitty dates in my life. But I will not be the woman that he disrespects, someone who just sits there waiting around for him while he ignores. I think I offset the dynamic when I walked away, and the dudes probably didn't chat for much longer after I left, as they no longer had a woman sitting around for them to ignore.

So I’ve just started my devotion and just started my spiritual/witchcraft journey I set up her altar 4 days ago I only have a small pocket sized statue right now but I plan on getting her a bigger statue as soon as money allows but I completely cleansed my appearance with insense before I brought her home then I cleansed the statue with some Florida water before I brought her home and wiped her down with some tequila then some lavender oil after I set up her altar her altar is facing east nd is ontop of my wooden dresser facing my Bed (I live in a studio apartment so that’s kinda the only option) I have a cotton altar cloth a red goblet type cup with water some frankincense and a few candles (I didn’t have any actual Santa muerte candles so I’m using regular white vocation candles that I carved sculls into until I can get proper candles) I did an “activation prayer” right after I set up the altar “Oh Most Holy Death, I invoke you so through your image you may free me from all danger, material or from bewitch- ment and through this sacred flame you may purify my body from all disgrace and malediction and that in turn love and abundance may come.” I prayed that a total of 9 times Then I gave her some offerings some sea shells some little crystals a few liters pins and other little nicknacks I put a small hourglass on there since that is a symbol of hers as well as a little scale of justice over the last few days I’ve been giving her little things every day I gave her some candy an apple a cupcake some Pepsi and some coffee every morning I have been getting up at 9am exactly and lighting an incense and lighting her candle and praying “ our lady of the holy death santisima muerte beloved of my heart come to me in my times of need defend me from all illnesses and grant me a long and healthy life oh holy mother hear my prayers” I say that 9 times then close with a amen then smother the candle then after I get home from work I will light it again talk to her about my day play some Mexican music dedicated to her and smoke a cigarette with her then I let her candle burn until it’s time to go to sleep I feel like overall I’m doing a pretty good job but I’ve still yet to get any signs that she is present no weird unexplained things happening no bubbles in the water no dreams (no dreams what so ever not even just regular dreams)or visions nothing at all her coffee has gone down about a half an inch but I don’t know if that’s just evaporation or not but I just don’t know if I’m doing something wrong or if I’m just being impatient but I’m getting worried that maybe she just doesn’t like me lol I was thinking maybe when I go to the botanica to get her a bigger statue and a proper candle maybe I should get some mugwort to try to open myself up to more dreams but other than that am I doing everything right?

1g7qtix,https://i.redd.it/qszphm4j9uvd1.jpeg,I cracked the code to amazing vegan allergy friendly ice cream,"Sweet sticky rice! Consistency like the best store-bought ice cream you've ever had. I am food intolerant with a lot of things, so I had to get creative. I have thrown out so many pints for being grainy or just the wrong texture.

Here's how to do this: 

You need sweet sticky rice, not just sticky rice or sushi rice. First, steam a couple cups of rice. Using a rice steamer is helpful. You're going to want to use a lot less water for this rice, so like one and 1/3 cup water per Rinsed cup of rice.

I blend everything in a ninja blender, but you can put it in whatever blender you have. 2 cups of cooked sticky rice into the blender. 

2 cups (or use your best judgment) of whatever plant-based milk you want. I use rice milk. Obviously, you can use cow milk if it doesn't bother you.

A tablespoon or maybe slightly more of a vegan butter. Butter doesn't bother me, so I used regular butter. 

I'm not strictly vegan, so I added a scoop of collagen and a scoop of grass fed gelatin to two of my pints and none in the third to compare, and honestly, it's the same consistency either way. I like to use these items because it adds a bit of healthiness to the pint because I am not able to use protein powder.

Blend well. No need to strain. Taste it to make sure all the rice got blended. That's it! That's your base. Now you can flavor it however you want. 

A couple things: 

1. Stronger flavors are better for this. I made coffee, Ginger pumpkin spice, and vanilla. You can taste the rice ever so slightly in the vanilla, but it's not bothersome. It's actually pretty good.

2. It's a little bit sticky when you are taking it out of the pint or picking it up with your spoon, but the stickiness doesn't offend the palette, just feels like really creamy ice cream.

I'm probably not the first one to do this, but I could not find any creami recipes using rice as a base, so I don't think a lot of people do this. 

Also, rice is one of those starches that loses calories once you freeze or refrigerate it. Not quite remembering how many, but I think rice has half the calories or more than half once you freeze or refrigerate it, so that's also good. Please let me know if you try it.",23,1729398462.0,ninjacreami,6,0.93,False

1g7qs4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/1g7qs4y/messy_passive_aggressive_roommate_how_do_i_ask/,"Messy, passive aggressive roommate; how do I ask her to move out?!","In the 6 months I have lived with my (24f) current roommate (24f), so many small things have happened that have added up to make it a really uncomfortable living situation. I walk on eggshells around her and I can't bring up even minor issues like laundry or dishes without her either blowing up and screaming or just blatantly ignoring me.

I met her through a Facebook roomate page for my area that I have had success with before since I didn't have any friends at the time that were looking for a new place. We seemed to have a lot of similar interests and lifestyles, and she seemed really sweet and genuine, so I decided to go for it. The only issue I identified was that she was currently between jobs, however she had a written offer and showed me bank statements and credit scores to prove that she would be able to afford the rent for at least a year. So, she seemed responsible.

However, since she moved in, it's been kind of a nightmare. When she moved in, she left several of her boxes and disassembled furniture in the common space for over a week, basically making the space unusable. When I asked her about it, she claimed she was missing some parts to assemble the furniture, and needed to go over to her boyfriends storage unit to get the rest. Moving is stressful and I didn't want to cause more stress for her, so I let it slide, and she resolved it after a couple days, but didn't move it out of the way in the meantime (important to note, I was working 80hr weeks and didn't have much time to use the common space anyways).

She poops with the bathroom door open. She doesnt use laundry detergent to wash her clothes, she uses fabric softener instead. She can be clumsy and occasionally spills drinks and food on the carpet, and does not clean it up (I asked her about it the first few times it happened, and she claimed not to have realized, so she either has severe adhd or is lying and just doesnt care). She cooks extremely greasy and oily food, and does not clean up the stove or air fryer after use. When she washes the pots and pans, they are still coated in grease and I have to rewash them so I can use them. She leaves wet soggy food in the sink. She leaves food in the fridge for weeks to rot. She caused a small fire in my $500 breville toaster oven and essentially broke it, at which point I had to buy a new one and asked her not to cook anything greasy in it in order to avoid the issue repeating, which she ignored. I asked her not to use it anymore, and she still uses it when I'm not home. She leaves shoes, clothes, bags, and random climbing gear all over the common spaces for days and doesn't clean it up unless asked. After getting a new job, she constantly complained that she wanted to quit because it was boring and she wanted to find something else she enjoyed more, but she works from home and she maybe logs on to work for an hour total every day. 

She never told me when she would have people over, and her boyfriend started staying the night for literally 5 nights out of the week every week, and I told her I was uncomfortable with this since I didn't know him, and want to able to exist in my space without there constantly being guests over. We had agreed before we moved in to let each other know beforehand if we were having guests and for how long, and I reminded her of this, and she agreed to only have him over a max of 3 days a week and let me know as soon as she knew if she was having people over. I of course gave her this same courtesy.

A few months ago, she brought home a GIANT meat dehydrator and wanted to store it on the kitchen counter full time, despite claiming she would only need to use it once a month or less for backpacking meals during the summer. It took up so much space that it made the counters unusable for food prep, and when we discussed it, she suggested putting it on the dining room buffet next to my espresso machine, which I told her I wasn't comfortable with since I used that space to prep my espresso and cocktail drinks and needed usable counter space. When I left for work, she moved it there anyways. When I came home and asked her about it, she claimed that there was nowhere else she could store it and it shouldn't be a big deal, and she had just as much of a right to use the space as I did. I tried to explain to her that yes, she has just as much of a right to use the common space, but not to make the space unusable or an inconvenience for me as a result, and we needed to find a solution that worked for both of us. She got incredibly nasty and rude, and continuously interrupted me to the point that the convo was completely useless. I was shocked by her reaction to such a small and easily fixable issue, but since she became so hostile, I decided to end the conversation and asked her if she would revisit it with me when we were in a better headspace. She stormed out of the apartment and didn't return for 24 hours. In that time, I found a space in the pantry where it would fit and made sure it would be accessible if she ever needed to pull it out to use. I asked her if this would work when she came back, and she claimed to be fine with it, and then proceeded to yell at me about how I never gave her the benefit of the doubt, pestered her about ""every little thing"" and had no right to dictate the way she lived. I was again surprised, since this has never been my intention, and apologized if anything I had mentioned had come across the wrong way, and asked how she would prefer I communicate housekeeping issues, and I thought we worked it out. We were obviously less comfortable with each other after this giant blow up, but we had both agreed to communicate issues in a different way and make more of an effort to keep common areas clean and usable, so I figured it would resolve itself and we'd move on. Nope.

She has since completely stopped talking to me. When I say hello in the morning, she ignores me. She doesn't respond to texts about my friends, family, or boyfriend coming to visit, and then gets upset that I didnt tell her anyone was coming, and is rude to my guests. She does not let me know until 15 minutes beforehand when she has people coming over (either for several hours or overnight). Sometimes, she just doesn't mention it, and when I come home, she has guests. Its usually the boyfriend, who I really have no issues with, he is a cool guy and we get along fine and chat whenever he is around about hiking/coffee/concerts or whatever, the issue is the lack of communication from her, and she almost seems upset that I talk to her boyfriend at all? I have a long term boyfriend and have never been interested, let alone flirted with him, but she acts like I am. However, I will always be polite and friendly towards guests, and do what I can to make people comfortable when they visit, even if they arent my guests. 

She does not contribute to keeping the apartment clean at all anymore, doesn't clean up after herself at all, leaves food open everywhere, and the list goes on. I don't want to live like that, so I clean up after her when I can. She is now nasty and blatantly rude to any guests of mine that come over, and makes the space uncomfortable for everyone else.

This Friday, I came home to find him there unannounced, clothes and random belongings everywhere. They seem to have had sex on my couch, and smoked weed inside the apartment. The smell permeated out into the halls, so while I didn't see them smoke outright, it was incredibly obvious. This is the first time I've noticed it, but I wouldn't be surprised if it had happened before. I went to ask her to clean it up, and she proceeded to rush into the bathroom where her boyfriend was pooping and scream ""I told you she would say something!"" I saw this man taking a dump on the toilet. She laughed, and she shut the door in my face. He came out later and apologized for the mess, and cleaned up after them both, obviously embarrassed about the situation. No apology from her.

This was my last straw. I'm so fed up. I don't want to live with her anymore, but I want to stay. I lived here for 2 years with a previous roommate who moved to another city to take her dream job. I have a life here, a dogwalker I love, friends close by, cheap rent for a spacious apartment, and it would just be a pain to move since all the common space furniture and kitchen stuff is mine. I honestly enjoy living with other people and would like to try and find a new roommate.

Am I right to ask her to find another place to live? What would be the best way to ask that of her? Our lease ends in February. I honestly don't want extra drama, and I don't see any point in starting a blame game and pointing fingers and listing out all the reasons above. ",2,1729398303.0,badroommates,0,1.0,False
